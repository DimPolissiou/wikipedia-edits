The ITN makes particular use of [[Lagrange points]] as locations where [[trajectories]] through [[Outer space|space]] can be redirected using little or no energy. These points have the peculiar property of allowing objects to [[orbit]] around them, despite lacking an object to orbit.

However, a small number of exact solutions exist, most notably the five orbits referred to as \"[[Lagrange point]]s\", which are orbital solutions for circular orbits in the case when one body is significantly more massive.\n\nThe key to discovering the Interplanetary Transport Network was the investigation of the nature of the winding paths near the Earth-Sun and Earth-Moon Lagrange points. They were first investigated by [[Jules-Henri Poincar\u00e9]] in the 1890s. He noticed that the paths leading to and from any of those points would almost always settle, for a time, on an orbit about that point.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Marsden |first=J. E. |first2=S.

For any two bodies in which one body orbits around the other, such as a star/planet or planet/moon system, there are five such points, denoted {{L1}} through {{L5}}. For instance, the Earth\u2013Moon {{L1}} point lies on a line between the two, where gravitational forces between them exactly balance with the centrifugal force of an object placed in orbit there. These five points have particularly low [[delta-v]] requirements, and appear to be the lowest-energy transfers possible, even lower than the common [[Hohmann transfer orbit]] that has dominated orbital navigation since the start of space travel.\n\nAlthough the forces balance at these points, the first three points (the ones on the line between a certain large mass, e.g. a [[star]], and a smaller, orbiting mass, e.g. a [[planet]]) are not stable [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] points. If a [[spacecraft]] placed at the Earth\u2013Moon {{L1}} point is given even a slight nudge away from the equilibrium point, the spacecraft's trajectory will diverge away from the {{L1}} point. The entire system is in motion, so the spacecraft will not actually hit the Moon, but will travel in a winding path, off into space. There is, however, a semi-stable orbit around each of these points, called a [[halo orbit]]. The orbits for two of the points, {{L4}} and {{L5}}, are stable, but the halo orbits for {{L1}} through {{L3}} are stable only on the order of [[month]]s.\n\nIn addition to orbits around Lagrange points, the rich dynamics that arise from the gravitational pull of more than one mass yield interesting trajectories, also known as [[low energy transfers]].<ref name=\"Conley, C. C 1968\"/> For example, the gravity environment of the Sun\u2013Earth\u2013Moon system allows spacecraft to travel great distances on very little fuel,{{citation needed|reason=From LEO, 3.2 km/s suffices for escape. To reach Sun earth L1, 3.1 km/s needs to be invested. the fuel savings isn't that great|date=November 2015}} albeit on an often circuitous route.\n\n==Missions==\nLaunched in 1978, the [[ISEE-3]] spacecraft was sent on a mission to orbit around one of the Lagrange points.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Farquhar |first=R.

After the primary mission was completed, ISEE-3 went on to accomplish other goals, including a flight through the [[geomagnetic]] tail and a comet flyby. The mission was subsequently renamed the [[International Cometary Explorer]] (ICE).\n\nThe first low energy transfer using what would later be called the ITN was the rescue of [[Japan]]'s ''[[Hiten]]'' lunar mission in 1991.<ref>{{cite book |last=Belbruno |first=E. |date=2004 |url=http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/7687.html |title=Capture Dynamics and Chaotic Motions in Celestial Mechanics: With the Construction of Low Energy Transfers |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location= |isbn=9780691094809 |access-date=2006-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202074354/http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/7687.html |archive-date=2014-12-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Another example of the use of the ITN was [[NASA]]'s 2001\u20132003 [[Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis mission]], which orbited the Sun\u2013Earth {{L1}} point for over two years collecting material, before being redirected to the {{L2}} Lagrange point, and finally redirected from there back to Earth. The 2003\u20132006 ''[[SMART-1]]'' of the [[European Space Agency]] used another low energy transfer from the ITN. In a more recent example, the [[China space program|Chinese]] spacecraft [[Chang'e 2]] used the ITN to travel from lunar orbit to the Earth-Sun {{L2}} point, then on to fly by the asteroid [[4179 Toutatis]].\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Gravity assist]]\n*[[Gravitational keyhole]]\n*[[Orbital mechanics]]\n*[[Interplanetary spaceflight]]\n*[[Hill sphere]]\n*[[Horseshoe orbit]]\n*[[Halo orbit]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Sources and notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www2.esm.vt.edu/~sdross/papers/AmericanScientist2006.pdf \"The Interplanetary Transport Network\"] by [[Shane D.

After the primary mission was completed, ISEE-3 went on to accomplish other goals, including a flight through the [[geomagnetic]] tail and a comet flyby. The mission was subsequently renamed the [[International Cometary Explorer]] (ICE).\n\nThe first low energy transfer using what would later be called the ITN was the rescue of [[Japan]]'s ''[[Hiten]]'' lunar mission in 1991.<ref>{{cite book |last=Belbruno |first=E. |date=2004 |url=http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/7687.html |title=Capture Dynamics and Chaotic Motions in Celestial Mechanics: With the Construction of Low Energy Transfers |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location= |isbn=9780691094809 |access-date=2006-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202074354/http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/7687.html |archive-date=2014-12-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Another example of the use of the ITN was [[NASA]]'s 2001\u20132003 [[Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis mission]], which orbited the Sun\u2013Earth {{L1}} point for over two years collecting material, before being redirected to the {{L2}} Lagrange point, and finally redirected from there back to Earth. The 2003\u20132006 ''[[SMART-1]]'' of the [[European Space Agency]] used another low energy transfer from the ITN. In a more recent example, the [[China space program|Chinese]] spacecraft [[Chang'e 2]] used the ITN to travel from lunar orbit to the Earth-Sun {{L2}} point, then on to fly by the asteroid [[4179 Toutatis]].\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Gravity assist]]\n*[[Gravitational keyhole]]\n*[[Orbital mechanics]]\n*[[Interplanetary spaceflight]]\n*[[Hill sphere]]\n*[[Horseshoe orbit]]\n*[[Halo orbit]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Sources and notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www2.esm.vt.edu/~sdross/papers/AmericanScientist2006.pdf \"The Interplanetary Transport Network\"] by [[Shane D.
