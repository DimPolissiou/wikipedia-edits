Across his spell with the two clubs, Werner claimed the domestic records for being the youngest player to reach 50, 100, 150 and 200 appearances in the [[Bundesliga]], although the former two milestones were broken by [[Kai Havertz]], and is the youngest player to have scored two goals in a single top-flight match in Germany.\n\nWerner was a prolific goalscorer at youth international level where he scored 34 goals in 48 appearances across the various age group levels. He made his senior debut for [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in 2017 and in the same year helped his nation claim the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]] where his return of three goals earned him the tournament's Golden Boot award.\n\n==Club career==\n===VfB Stuttgart===\nAn academy graduate of [[VfB Stuttgart]], Werner represented the club at various youth levels. During the 2012\u201313 season, he was promoted to the U-19 side despite only being sixteen-years old at the time.

An important migration from North Africa across the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] also appears to have occurred before the formation of the Natufian.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}.\n\n==Historical period==\nIn historical times, there has been a period of North African influence in southern Europe, especially western-southern [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] and parts of [[Southern Italy]] (namely Sicily), during various [[Muslim conquests]]. The genetic effect of this period on modern European populations is the subject of discussion (see below). In more recent history, the peoples of Europe and Africa came into contact during the [[European exploration of Africa|exploration]] and [[colonization of Africa]] and as a consequence of the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref name=\"malyarchuk2005\">{{Harvcoltxt|Malyarchuk|Czarny|2005}}</ref>\n\n==Assessing African genetic contributions in non-Africans==\nThe evolutionary forces that contribute to patterns of human genetic variation include new [[mutations]], [[natural selection]], [[sexual selection]], [[genetic drift]], [[population bottleneck]]s, [[founder effects]], [[isolation by distance]], [[genetic admixture]] and barriers to [[gene flow]]. The most influential factors affecting human genetic variation are [[founder effects]] and [[isolation by distance]].<ref name=\"ramachandran\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramachandran S, Deshpande O, Roseman CC, Rosenberg NA, Feldman MW, Cavalli-Sforza LL | title = Support from the relationship of genetic and geographic distance in human populations for a serial founder effect originating in Africa | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 44 | pages = 15942\u20137 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16243969 | pmc = 1276087 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0507611102 | ref = harv | bibcode = 2005PNAS..10215942R }}</ref><ref name=\"handley\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Handley LJ, Manica A, Goudet J, Balloux F | title = Going the distance: human population genetics in a clinal world | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 23 | issue = 9 | pages = 432\u20139 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17655965 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2007.07.002 | ref = harv | url = https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_B0CA510362E4.P001/REF.pdf }}</ref>\n\n[[Founder effect]] occurs when a population is established by a small number of individuals who have departed from a much larger population. Several generations after the population has expanded, individuals will still possess the limited gene pool of the founders. Therefore, founder effects result in a loss of [[genetic diversity]]. Genetic evidence suggests that the Out of Africa migration involved only small numbers of individuals. The African migrants carried a small subset of the prehistoric African genetic diversity, resulting in a founder effect on the non-African population. As humans spread across the globe populating Europe, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas, there were several founder effects. As a result of these [[serial founder effect]]s, genetic diversity tends to decrease with distance from Africa.<ref name=\"ramachandran\"/><ref name=\"handley\"/>\n\nThe other major factor contributing to patterns of human genetic variation is \"[[isolation by distance]]\". According to this model, populations that live near one another are more likely to exchange mates than populations that live farther apart. As a result, populations that live near one another are genetically more similar than populations that live far apart.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" width=\"280px\"\n|+''' Percentage genetic distances among major continents based on 120 classical polymorphisms{{Citation needed|reason=please provide citation for where the data in this table came from|date=February 2010}} '''\n!               ||Africa\t||\tOceania\t|| East Asia\t||\tEurope\n|-\n|Oceania\t||\t24.7    || \t\t||\t        ||\n|-\n|East Asia\t||\t20.6\t||\t10\t||\t        ||\n|-\n|Europe\t        ||\t16.6\t||\t13.5\t||\t9.7\t||\n|-\n|America\t||\t22.6\t||\t14.6\t||\t8.9\t||\t9.5\n|}\n[[Genetic distance]] is a measure used to compare the genetic relationship between populations. It is based on the principle that populations that share similar frequencies of a trait are more closely related than populations that have different frequencies of a trait. The genetic distance between two populations increases linearly with the geographic distance between them, due to [[isolation by distance]] and serial founder effects.<ref name=\"ramachandran\"/><ref name=\"handley\"/> [[Genetic admixture]] increases the genetic diversity of a population. When admixture occurs between populations, the genetic distance between the two populations is reduced.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Cavalli-Sforza|1997}} applied genetic distance measures to various populations around the world to infer phylogenetic relationships (see Table on the right). All non-African populations are more closely related to one another (i.e. short genetic distance) than they are to African populations. This is consistent with a founder effect on the non-African population in that only a few individuals participated in the initial Out of Africa migration. The largest genetic distances observed are between Africa and Oceania and between Africa and the Americas. This is consistent with the isolation by distance and serial founder effects.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Cavalli-Sforza|1997}} suggests that the genetic distance between Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe is anomalously lower than it would be if the two populations had been evolving independently. The study suggests that the lower genetic distance between Europe and Africa can be explained by genetic admixture.\n\n===Defining African admixture===\nGenerally, markers and lineages used to characterize African admixture are those that are believed to be specific to Africa. There are also DNA polymorphisms that are shared between populations native to [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europe]], [[West Asia]], [[North Africa]] and the [[Horn of Africa]], such as the [[Y chromosome|y-chromosomal]] haplogroup [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] and the [[mitochondria]]l haplogroup [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M1]].<ref name=\"malyarchuk2005\"/><!---Note there are many more shared than these, some are or recent Eurasian origin in North Africa--->\n\nWith regard to the paternal haplogroup E1b1b and maternal haplogroup M1, derivatives of these clades have been observed in prehistoric human fossils excavated at the [[Ifri n'Amr or Moussa]] site in [[Morocco]], which have been [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon-dated]] to the Early [[Neolithic]] period (ca. 5,000 BC). Ancient DNA analysis of these specimens indicates that they carried paternal haplotypes related to the [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b1b1a]] (E-M81) subclade and the maternal haplogroups [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U6a]] and [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M1]], all of which are frequent among present-day communities in the Maghreb. These ancient individuals also bore an autochthonous Maghrebi genomic component that peaks among modern [[Berbers]], indicating that they were ancestral to populations in the area.

The introduction of African markers could be due to the Phoenician colonization at the end of the second millennium B.C. or to the more recent Arab conquest (8th\u20139th centuries A.D.).\n\n===Sickle cell trait===\nSickle cell genes of African origin have been detected in Europe, mostly in the Mediterranean region. The [[sickle cell trait]] is associated with resistance to [[malaria]]. Individuals with one copy of the sickle cell gene, [[heterozygotes]], have higher resistance to malaria than individuals with no sickle cell genes. In regions affected by malaria, the fertility of sickle cell heterozygotes will be higher than average. Individuals with two copies of the sickle cell gene, [[homozygotes]], will be affected by [[sickle cell disease]] and historically have had lower than average fertility. The sickle cell trait is thus an example of [[heterozygote advantage]] which is subject to [[balancing selection]]. When the sickle cell trait is introduced into a region affected by malaria, balancing selection will, on one hand, act to increase the frequency of the trait to counter malaria. On the other hand, if the frequency of the trait in the population becomes high enough so that homozygotes with sickle cell disease become common, balancing selection will act to limit the spread of the trait. Therefore, in regions affected by malaria, the sickle cell trait is maintained at intermediate frequencies relative to the incidence of malaria.\n\nIn Africa, malaria is believed to be one of the most important factors that contributed to restricting population growth in prehistoric times. Sickle cell mutations are believed to have occurred independently at least five times. Four variants are of African origin and one of Indian/Arabian origin. The African variants are referred to as Cameroon, Senegal, Benin and Bantu. The emergence of the sickle cell trait would have contributed to population expansion, with the emergence of farming into tropical regions where malaria was endemic.\n\nArcheological and historical evidence suggests that malaria has been endemic in the\nMediterranean regions of Europe in historical times.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sallares R, Bouwman A, Anderung C | title = The spread of malaria to Southern Europe in antiquity: new approaches to old problems | journal = Medical History | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 311\u201328 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 16021928 | pmc = 547919 | doi = 10.1017/s0025727300007651 | ref = harv }}</ref> In eastern Mediterranean regions\u2014such as Italy, Greece, Albania, and Turkey\u2014the Benin haplotype is the most frequent sickle cell variant.

Some recent studies have focused on corroborating current genetic data with the archeological evidence from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.<ref name=lancaster/> The [[Natufian culture]], which existed about 12,000 years ago, has been the subject of various archeological investigations, as it is generally believed to be the source of the European and North African Neolithic.\n\nAccording to a hypothesis stated by {{Harvcoltxt|Bar-Yosef|1987}}, the [[Natufian culture]] emerged from the mixing of two Stone Age cultures:  (1) the [[Kebaran]], a culture indigenous to the Levant, and  (2) the [[Mushabian culture|Mushabian]], a culture introduced into the Levant from North Africa'''\u2020'''. It is suggested that the Mushabian culture originated in Africa, given that archeological sites with Mushabian industries in the Nile Valley predate those in the Levant'''\u2020'''. The Mushabians would have then moved into the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] from the Nile Delta bringing with them their technologies'''\u2020'''. {{Harvcoltxt|Bar-Yosef|1987}} states: \"the population overflow from Northeast Africa played a definite role in the establishment of the Natufian adaptation, which in turn led to the emergence of agriculture as a new subsistence system\".\n\nA study by {{Harvcoltxt|Brace|Seguchi|Quintyn|Fox|2006}} analysed human remains from the Natufian culture.\nAccording to the study, there is evidence of Sub-Saharan influences in the Natufian samples. They argue that these influences would have been diluted by the interbreeding of the Neolithic farmers from the Near East with the indigenous foragers in Europe. {{Harvcoltxt|Ricaut|Waelkens|2008}} associate the Sub-Saharan influences detected in the Natufian samples with the migration of [[E1b1b]] lineages from Northeast Africa to the Levant and then into Europe.\n\nAccording to the most recent ancient DNA analyses conducted by Lazaridis et al. (2016) on Natufian skeletal remains from present-day northern Israel, the Natufians in fact shared no evident genetic affinity to sub-Saharan Africans.

An important migration from North Africa across the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] also appears to have occurred before the formation of the Natufian.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}.\n\n==Historical period==\nIn historical times, there has been a period of North African influence in southern Europe, especially western-southern [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] and parts of [[Southern Italy]] (namely Sicily), during various [[Muslim conquests]]. The genetic effect of this period on modern European populations is the subject of discussion (see below).

Several generations after the population has expanded, individuals will still possess the limited gene pool of the founders. Therefore, founder effects result in a loss of [[genetic diversity]]. Genetic evidence suggests that the Out of Africa migration involved only small numbers of individuals. The African migrants carried a small subset of the prehistoric African genetic diversity, resulting in a founder effect on the non-African population. As humans spread across the globe populating Europe, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas, there were several founder effects. As a result of these [[serial founder effect]]s, genetic diversity tends to decrease with distance from Africa.<ref name=\"ramachandran\"/><ref name=\"handley\"/>\n\nThe other major factor contributing to patterns of human genetic variation is \"[[isolation by distance]]\". According to this model, populations that live near one another are more likely to exchange mates than populations that live farther apart. As a result, populations that live near one another are genetically more similar than populations that live far apart.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" width=\"280px\"\n|+''' Percentage genetic distances among major continents based on 120 classical polymorphisms{{Citation needed|reason=please provide citation for where the data in this table came from|date=February 2010}} '''\n!               ||Africa\t||\tOceania\t|| East Asia\t||\tEurope\n|-\n|Oceania\t||\t24.7    || \t\t||\t        ||\n|-\n|East Asia\t||\t20.6\t||\t10\t||\t        ||\n|-\n|Europe\t        ||\t16.6\t||\t13.5\t||\t9.7\t||\n|-\n|America\t||\t22.6\t||\t14.6\t||\t8.9\t||\t9.5\n|}\n[[Genetic distance]] is a measure used to compare the genetic relationship between populations. It is based on the principle that populations that share similar frequencies of a trait are more closely related than populations that have different frequencies of a trait. The genetic distance between two populations increases linearly with the geographic distance between them, due to [[isolation by distance]] and serial founder effects.<ref name=\"ramachandran\"/><ref name=\"handley\"/> [[Genetic admixture]] increases the genetic diversity of a population. When admixture occurs between populations, the genetic distance between the two populations is reduced.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Cavalli-Sforza|1997}} applied genetic distance measures to various populations around the world to infer phylogenetic relationships (see Table on the right). All non-African populations are more closely related to one another (i.e. short genetic distance) than they are to African populations. This is consistent with a founder effect on the non-African population in that only a few individuals participated in the initial Out of Africa migration. The largest genetic distances observed are between Africa and Oceania and between Africa and the Americas. This is consistent with the isolation by distance and serial founder effects.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Cavalli-Sforza|1997}} suggests that the genetic distance between Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe is anomalously lower than it would be if the two populations had been evolving independently. The study suggests that the lower genetic distance between Europe and Africa can be explained by genetic admixture.\n\n===Defining African admixture===\nGenerally, markers and lineages used to characterize African admixture are those that are believed to be specific to Africa. There are also DNA polymorphisms that are shared between populations native to [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europe]], [[West Asia]], [[North Africa]] and the [[Horn of Africa]], such as the [[Y chromosome|y-chromosomal]] haplogroup [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] and the [[mitochondria]]l haplogroup [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M1]].<ref name=\"malyarchuk2005\"/><!---Note there are many more shared than these, some are or recent Eurasian origin in North Africa--->\n\nWith regard to the paternal haplogroup E1b1b and maternal haplogroup M1, derivatives of these clades have been observed in prehistoric human fossils excavated at the [[Ifri n'Amr or Moussa]] site in [[Morocco]], which have been [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon-dated]] to the Early [[Neolithic]] period (ca. 5,000 BC). Ancient DNA analysis of these specimens indicates that they carried paternal haplotypes related to the [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b1b1a]] (E-M81) subclade and the maternal haplogroups [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U6a]] and [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M1]], all of which are frequent among present-day communities in the Maghreb. These ancient individuals also bore an autochthonous Maghrebi genomic component that peaks among modern [[Berbers]], indicating that they were ancestral to populations in the area. Additionally, fossils excavated at the [[Kelif el Boroud]] site near Rabat were found to carry the broadly-distributed paternal haplogroup [[Haplogroup T-M184|T-M184]] as well as the maternal haplogroups [[Haplogroup K (mtDNA)|K1]], [[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)|T2]] and [[Haplogroup X (mtDNA)|X2]], the latter of which were common mtDNA lineages in Neolithic [[Europe]] and [[Anatolia]]. These ancient individuals likewise bore the Berber-associated Maghrebi genomic component. This altogether indicates that the Late Neolithic Kelif el Boroud inhabitants were ancestral to contemporary populations in the area, but also likely experienced gene flow from Europe.<ref>{{cite biorxiv|last1=Fregel |display-authors=etal |year=2017 |title=Neolithization of North Africa involved the migration of people from both the Levant and Europe|biorxiv=191569}}</ref>\n\nOther lineages that are now found in Africa and Europe may have a common origin in Asia (e.g. Y haplogroups [[haplogroup R1 (Y-DNA)|R1]], and some paternal haplogroup [[haplogroup T (Y-DNA)|T]] and [[haplogroup U|U]] subclades).

The authors suggest that this pattern indicates that most of the Sub-Saharan L lineages entered Iberia in prehistoric times rather than during the slave trade. According to {{harvcoltxt|Pereira|Cunha|Alves|Amorim|2005}}, the Sub-Saharan lineages found in Iberia matched lineages from diverse regions in Africa. They suggest this pattern is more compatible with a recent arrival of these lineages after slave trading began in the 15th century. According to the study,  alternative scenarios that invoke much older and demographically more significant introductions ({{Harvcoltxt|Gonz\u00e1lez|Brehm|P\u00e9rez|Maca-Meyer|2003}}) or that claim a substantial role of the Roman and/or Islamic periods on the introduction of Sub-Saharan lineages seem unlikely. {{Harvcoltxt|Casas|Hagelberg|Fregel|Larruga|2006}} extracted DNA from human remains that were exhumed from old burial sites in [[Al-Andalus]], Spain. The remains date to between the 12th and 13th centuries. The frequency of Sub-Saharan lineages detected in the medieval samples was 14.6% and 8.3% in the present population of [[Priego de Cordoba]].

The introduction of African markers could be due to the Phoenician colonization at the end of the second millennium B.C. or to the more recent Arab conquest (8th\u20139th centuries A.D.).\n\n===Sickle cell trait===\nSickle cell genes of African origin have been detected in Europe, mostly in the Mediterranean region. The [[sickle cell trait]] is associated with resistance to [[malaria]]. Individuals with one copy of the sickle cell gene, [[heterozygotes]], have higher resistance to malaria than individuals with no sickle cell genes. In regions affected by malaria, the fertility of sickle cell heterozygotes will be higher than average. Individuals with two copies of the sickle cell gene, [[homozygotes]], will be affected by [[sickle cell disease]] and historically have had lower than average fertility. The sickle cell trait is thus an example of [[heterozygote advantage]] which is subject to [[balancing selection]]. When the sickle cell trait is introduced into a region affected by malaria, balancing selection will, on one hand, act to increase the frequency of the trait to counter malaria. On the other hand, if the frequency of the trait in the population becomes high enough so that homozygotes with sickle cell disease become common, balancing selection will act to limit the spread of the trait. Therefore, in regions affected by malaria, the sickle cell trait is maintained at intermediate frequencies relative to the incidence of malaria.\n\nIn Africa, malaria is believed to be one of the most important factors that contributed to restricting population growth in prehistoric times. Sickle cell mutations are believed to have occurred independently at least five times. Four variants are of African origin and one of Indian/Arabian origin. The African variants are referred to as Cameroon, Senegal, Benin and Bantu. The emergence of the sickle cell trait would have contributed to population expansion, with the emergence of farming into tropical regions where malaria was endemic.\n\nArcheological and historical evidence suggests that malaria has been endemic in the\nMediterranean regions of Europe in historical times.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sallares R, Bouwman A, Anderung C | title = The spread of malaria to Southern Europe in antiquity: new approaches to old problems | journal = Medical History | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 311\u201328 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 16021928 | pmc = 547919 | doi = 10.1017/s0025727300007651 | ref = harv }}</ref> In eastern Mediterranean regions\u2014such as Italy, Greece, Albania, and Turkey\u2014the Benin haplotype is the most frequent sickle cell variant.

Some recent studies have focused on corroborating current genetic data with the archeological evidence from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.<ref name=lancaster/> The [[Natufian culture]], which existed about 12,000 years ago, has been the subject of various archeological investigations, as it is generally believed to be the source of the European and North African Neolithic.\n\nAccording to a hypothesis stated by {{Harvcoltxt|Bar-Yosef|1987}}, the [[Natufian culture]] emerged from the mixing of two Stone Age cultures:  (1) the [[Kebaran]], a culture indigenous to the Levant, and  (2) the [[Mushabian culture|Mushabian]], a culture introduced into the Levant from North Africa'''\u2020'''. It is suggested that the Mushabian culture originated in Africa, given that archeological sites with Mushabian industries in the Nile Valley predate those in the Levant'''\u2020'''. The Mushabians would have then moved into the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] from the Nile Delta bringing with them their technologies'''\u2020'''. {{Harvcoltxt|Bar-Yosef|1987}} states: \"the population overflow from Northeast Africa played a definite role in the establishment of the Natufian adaptation, which in turn led to the emergence of agriculture as a new subsistence system\".\n\nA study by {{Harvcoltxt|Brace|Seguchi|Quintyn|Fox|2006}} analysed human remains from the Natufian culture.\nAccording to the study, there is evidence of Sub-Saharan influences in the Natufian samples. They argue that these influences would have been diluted by the interbreeding of the Neolithic farmers from the Near East with the indigenous foragers in Europe. {{Harvcoltxt|Ricaut|Waelkens|2008}} associate the Sub-Saharan influences detected in the Natufian samples with the migration of [[E1b1b]] lineages from Northeast Africa to the Levant and then into Europe.\n\nAccording to the most recent ancient DNA analyses conducted by Lazaridis et al. (2016) on Natufian skeletal remains from present-day northern Israel, the Natufians in fact shared no evident genetic affinity to sub-Saharan Africans. The authors also state that they were unable to test for affinity in the Natufians to early North African populations using present-day North Africans as a reference because present-day North Africans owe most of their ancestry to back-migration from Eurasia.<ref name=\"Lazaridis2016\"/><ref>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/06/16/059311.full.pdf (Quote:\u201dHowever, no affinity of Natufians to sub-Saharan Africans is evident in our genome-wide analysis, as present-day sub-Saharan Africans do not share more alleles with Natufians than with other ancient Eurasians (Extended Data Table 1).\u201d)</ref> The Natufians carried the Y-DNA (paternal) haplogroups [[Haplogroup E-Z827#E-Z830 (E1b1b1b2)|E1b1b1b2(xE1b1b1b2a,E1b1b1b2b)]] (2/5; 40%), [[Haplogroup CT|CT]] (2/5; 40%), and [[Haplogroup E-P2|E1b1(xE1b1a1,E1b1b1b1)]] (1/5; 20%).<ref name=\"Lazaridis2016\">{{cite biorxiv |last=Lazaridis |display-authors=et al.|first=Iosif|date=17 June 2016|title=The genetic structure of the world's first farmers|biorxiv=059311}} -- [http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/suppl/2016/06/16/059311.DC1/059311-1.pdf Table S6.1 - Y-chromosome haplogroups]</ref><ref>Lazaridis, Iosif et al.

It incorporated all the improvements that had been previously suggested for those classes \u2013 its shape was streamlined throughout, and having a capacity of {{convert|360000|ft3|m3|abbr=on}} it was significantly larger than that of the \"Coastals\". Six [[ballonet]]s of {{convert|128000|ft3|m3|abbr=on}} in total were provided; equivalent to 35.5% of the total volume.<ref name=W67/>\n\nAttached to the envelope were four fins. The smaller top fin was merely for stabilizing purposes; while the larger other three were identical in size and shape, and carried the [[rudder]] and [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevator]]s. The [[aluminium]] fuel tanks were initially situated above the top ridges of the envelope, but its varying shape caused the aluminium fuel lines to fracture and consequently the tanks were later placed inside the envelope.<ref name=W68>Whale (2008), p.68.</ref>\n\n===Cars===\nThe first examples of the type were equipped with two enclosed cars slung from the underside of the envelope \u2013 a control car, and to the rear an engineers' car (power or engine car), joined by an exposed wooden walk-way suspended on cables.\n\nThe control car was rectangular in cross-section, {{convert|35|ft|m|abbr=on}} long<ref name=NSClass>[http://web.mac.com/whatisart/iWeb/NS11/North%20Sea%20Class%20Airships.html \"North Sea Class Airships\".] Retrieved on 30 March 2009.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618003938/http://web.mac.com/whatisart/iWeb/NS11/North%20Sea%20Class%20Airships.html |date=18 June 2010 }}</ref> and {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} high, and was constructed from a frame of light steel tubing braced with diagonal wires.<ref name=W68/> The forward portion was clad in [[duralumin]], and the remainder covered with fabric laced to the framework. Duralumin sheeting was chosen instead of aluminium as it is not affected by the combined action of sea air and water. Windows and portholes provided both light for the crew, and afforded a good field of view.<ref name=\"HoA\"/>\n\nThe forward section of the control car was extensively glazed, and formed the pilot's cabin which housed all the flight controls, navigating instruments, [[engine telegraph]]s and [[voice pipe]]s. Behind this was the [[wireless telegraphy]] cabin, while the living and sleeping accommodation for the 10-man crew was located at the rear of the car.<ref name=\"HoA\"/><ref name=W68/> In addition to the radio equipment, the wireless operators' compartment carried [[Signal lamp|Aldis lamp]]s as well as [[international maritime signal flags]]. The latter could be lowered from the control car, and were effective for communicating with foreign vessels.<ref name=NSClass/>\n\nThe engineers' car housed the controls for the engines, and gave access to a flanged hotplate for cooking that was attached to one of the engine exhaust pipes.<ref name=W68/><ref name=NSClass/> Two [[dynamo]]s and batteries provided power for the ship's electrical systems which included lights, telephones and signalling lamps etc.<ref name=W68/>\n\n===Propulsion===\nThe type was initially fitted with a pair of {{convert|250|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Rolls-Royce Eagle]] engines mounted one either side of the power car in streamlined enclosures. Each drove a {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}} diameter four-bladed propeller on independent shafts through an elaborate transmission system.<ref name=NSClass/><ref name=NSspecs/>\n\n===Armament===\nA maximum of six {{convert|230|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs could be carried as well as up to five machine-guns. Similar to the Coastal and C-Star class airships, one gun was mounted on a platform on top of the envelope which was reached through a climbing shaft.<ref name=NSClass/>\n\n===Crew===\nThe normal crew comprised two watches of five \u2013 necessary for extended patrols \u2013 and consisted of a Captain and Second Officer, a [[Coxswain]] and Second coxswain, two W/T Operators, two Engineers and two Air Gunners. The Captain was in overall command of the vessel, and was assisted by the Second Officer in navigating, maintaining height, and regulating gas pressure. The Coxswain was responsible for the rest of the crew, and for the care and maintenance of the ship whilst on the ground. He or the Second Coxswain steered the vessel in flight from a position at the very front of the control car. During patrols, the Air Gunners took on the duties of look-outs and also acted as cooks.<ref name=NSClass/>\n\n==Development==\n\n===Testing and problems===\nThe first example, ''N.S.1'', carried out initial flight trials on 1 February 1917. Preliminary trials were regarded as being satisfactory; the ship achieving a speed of {{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and proving easy to handle. Two further flights were carried out in March, the second of which was a longer cross-country round trip from Kingsnorth to [[Maidenhead]], [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], [[Guildford]], and back to Kingsnorth again. Following the success of this flight, ''N.S.1'' transferred to [[RNAS Pulham]], [[Norfolk]], on 18 April 1917 for more extensive trials. Minor snags encountered during flights over the next few weeks were ironed out, and it was then decided to carry out a full-scale endurance test taking place on 5 June. However, just over 16 hours into the flight, the [[universal joint]] on one of the propeller driveshafts broke and the ship returned to Pulham. Then, on 26 June, she again took to the air at 06:00 and remained aloft until 07:22 on 28 June \u2013 a flight duration of {{nowrap|49 h 22 min}} during which she covered {{convert|1536|mi|km}} and encountered only minor technical problems. At that time, this was a record for a British airship of any type.<ref name=NS3/>\n\n''N.S.2'''s early trials at Kingsnorth were also satisfactory, but during an endurance trial on 27 June similar to that of ''N.S.1'', she became unmanageable when she lost gas and was wrecked in an attempted landing near [[Stowmarket]], [[Suffolk]].<ref name=NS3/>\n\n''N.S.3'' made an 11-hour non-stop flight on 22 July 1917 to her operational base at RNAS [[East Fortune]] following trials in June at Kingsnorth. She was joined there on 6 September by ''N.S.1'', and by ''N.S.4'' from Kingsnorth on 15 October. ''N.S.5'' set off for East Fortune on 12 December, but both engines failed within sight of her destination, and she drifted with the wind for about {{convert|10|mi|km}} before they could be restarted. However, since both engines continued to be troublesome it was decided to make a \"free balloon\" landing, but she was damaged beyond repair during the attempt.<ref name=NS3/>\n\n===Modifications===\nThe Rolls-Royce engines together with their method of installation and complex transmission continually presented problems. They were connected to the propellers via long, heavy driveshafts that were only lightly supported, thus placing undue strain on the transmission system and invariably causing the universal joint nearest the propeller to fracture.<ref name=NS3/><ref name=W68/>\n\nThe Kingsnorth design team hastily set about redesigning the power car and transmission gear, and at the same time, staff at East Fortune were also looking into ways of improving the design. Kingsnorth considered the idea of replacing the Rolls-Royce engines with {{convert|240|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Fiat]] units having a direct drive to the propellers; while East Fortune's Engineering Officer, Lt.Cdr. A. S. Abell, [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNVR]], together with Flt.Cdr. J. S. Wheelwright, [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|DSC]] (Captain of ''N.S.3''), came up with the idea of raising the control car to the same level as the engineers' car; form them into a single fully enclosed unit that measured {{convert|85|ft|m|abbr=on}} in length and tapered to the stern,<ref name=W68/> and fit the propellers directly onto the engine crankshafts.

It incorporated all the improvements that had been previously suggested for those classes \u2013 its shape was streamlined throughout, and having a capacity of {{convert|360000|ft3|m3|abbr=on}} it was significantly larger than that of the \"Coastals\". Six [[ballonet]]s of {{convert|128000|ft3|m3|abbr=on}} in total were provided; equivalent to 35.5% of the total volume.<ref name=W67/>\n\nAttached to the envelope were four fins. The smaller top fin was merely for stabilizing purposes; while the larger other three were identical in size and shape, and carried the [[rudder]] and [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevator]]s.

Duralumin sheeting was chosen instead of aluminium as it is not affected by the combined action of sea air and water. Windows and portholes provided both light for the crew, and afforded a good field of view.<ref name=\"HoA\"/>\n\nThe forward section of the control car was extensively glazed, and formed the pilot's cabin which housed all the flight controls, navigating instruments, [[engine telegraph]]s and [[voice pipe]]s. Behind this was the [[wireless telegraphy]] cabin, while the living and sleeping accommodation for the 10-man crew was located at the rear of the car.<ref name=\"HoA\"/><ref name=W68/> In addition to the radio equipment, the wireless operators' compartment carried [[Signal lamp|Aldis lamp]]s as well as [[international maritime signal flags]]. The latter could be lowered from the control car, and were effective for communicating with foreign vessels.<ref name=NSClass/>\n\nThe engineers' car housed the controls for the engines, and gave access to a flanged hotplate for cooking that was attached to one of the engine exhaust pipes.<ref name=W68/><ref name=NSClass/> Two [[dynamo]]s and batteries provided power for the ship's electrical systems which included lights, telephones and signalling lamps etc.<ref name=W68/>\n\n===Propulsion===\nThe type was initially fitted with a pair of {{convert|250|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Rolls-Royce Eagle]] engines mounted one either side of the power car in streamlined enclosures. Each drove a {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}} diameter four-bladed propeller on independent shafts through an elaborate transmission system.<ref name=NSClass/><ref name=NSspecs/>\n\n===Armament===\nA maximum of six {{convert|230|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs could be carried as well as up to five machine-guns. Similar to the Coastal and C-Star class airships, one gun was mounted on a platform on top of the envelope which was reached through a climbing shaft.<ref name=NSClass/>\n\n===Crew===\nThe normal crew comprised two watches of five \u2013 necessary for extended patrols \u2013 and consisted of a Captain and Second Officer, a [[Coxswain]] and Second coxswain, two W/T Operators, two Engineers and two Air Gunners. The Captain was in overall command of the vessel, and was assisted by the Second Officer in navigating, maintaining height, and regulating gas pressure. The Coxswain was responsible for the rest of the crew, and for the care and maintenance of the ship whilst on the ground. He or the Second Coxswain steered the vessel in flight from a position at the very front of the control car. During patrols, the Air Gunners took on the duties of look-outs and also acted as cooks.<ref name=NSClass/>\n\n==Development==\n\n===Testing and problems===\nThe first example, ''N.S.1'', carried out initial flight trials on 1 February 1917. Preliminary trials were regarded as being satisfactory; the ship achieving a speed of {{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and proving easy to handle. Two further flights were carried out in March, the second of which was a longer cross-country round trip from Kingsnorth to [[Maidenhead]], [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], [[Guildford]], and back to Kingsnorth again. Following the success of this flight, ''N.S.1'' transferred to [[RNAS Pulham]], [[Norfolk]], on 18 April 1917 for more extensive trials. Minor snags encountered during flights over the next few weeks were ironed out, and it was then decided to carry out a full-scale endurance test taking place on 5 June. However, just over 16 hours into the flight, the [[universal joint]] on one of the propeller driveshafts broke and the ship returned to Pulham. Then, on 26 June, she again took to the air at 06:00 and remained aloft until 07:22 on 28 June \u2013 a flight duration of {{nowrap|49 h 22 min}} during which she covered {{convert|1536|mi|km}} and encountered only minor technical problems. At that time, this was a record for a British airship of any type.<ref name=NS3/>\n\n''N.S.2'''s early trials at Kingsnorth were also satisfactory, but during an endurance trial on 27 June similar to that of ''N.S.1'', she became unmanageable when she lost gas and was wrecked in an attempted landing near [[Stowmarket]], [[Suffolk]].<ref name=NS3/>\n\n''N.S.3'' made an 11-hour non-stop flight on 22 July 1917 to her operational base at RNAS [[East Fortune]] following trials in June at Kingsnorth. She was joined there on 6 September by ''N.S.1'', and by ''N.S.4'' from Kingsnorth on 15 October. ''N.S.5'' set off for East Fortune on 12 December, but both engines failed within sight of her destination, and she drifted with the wind for about {{convert|10|mi|km}} before they could be restarted. However, since both engines continued to be troublesome it was decided to make a \"free balloon\" landing, but she was damaged beyond repair during the attempt.<ref name=NS3/>\n\n===Modifications===\nThe Rolls-Royce engines together with their method of installation and complex transmission continually presented problems. They were connected to the propellers via long, heavy driveshafts that were only lightly supported, thus placing undue strain on the transmission system and invariably causing the universal joint nearest the propeller to fracture.<ref name=NS3/><ref name=W68/>\n\nThe Kingsnorth design team hastily set about redesigning the power car and transmission gear, and at the same time, staff at East Fortune were also looking into ways of improving the design. Kingsnorth considered the idea of replacing the Rolls-Royce engines with {{convert|240|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Fiat]] units having a direct drive to the propellers; while East Fortune's Engineering Officer, Lt.Cdr. A. S. Abell, [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNVR]], together with Flt.Cdr. J. S. Wheelwright, [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|DSC]] (Captain of ''N.S.3''), came up with the idea of raising the control car to the same level as the engineers' car; form them into a single fully enclosed unit that measured {{convert|85|ft|m|abbr=on}} in length and tapered to the stern,<ref name=W68/> and fit the propellers directly onto the engine crankshafts. These and other minor measures provided the crew with more room and improved their comfort; increased top speed through reduced air resistance (the redesigned car was more aerodynamic and positioned closer to the envelope); resulted in a reduction in weight; and improved reliability due to the abolition of the troublesome transmission shafts.<ref name=W69/> In January 1918, the [[Admiralty]] granted permission for these modifications to be undertaken at both Kingsnorth, and at East Fortune where the work was completed by the beginning of March.<ref name=NS3/>\n\nMainly due to the lack of a suitable alternative, official interest continued in the NS class despite the early reliability problems and the loss of two examples during their first months of service, and a further six were subsequently ordered in November 1917.
