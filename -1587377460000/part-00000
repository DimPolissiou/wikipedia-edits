Settlers moving from urbanized or relatively settled areas in the East faced the risk of mental breakdown caused by the harsh living conditions and the extreme levels of isolation on the prairie. Symptoms of prairie madness included depression, withdrawal, changes in character and habit, and violence. Prairie madness sometimes resulted in the afflicted person moving back East or, in extreme cases, [[suicide]].\n\nPrairie madness is not a clinical condition; rather, it is a pervasive subject in writings of fiction and non-fiction from the period to describe a fairly common phenomenon. It was described by Eugene Virgil Smalley in 1893: \"an alarming amount of insanity occurs in the new Prairie States among farmers and their wives.\"<ref name=\"The Americans\">{{cite book|last = Boorstin|first = D.|date = 1973|title = The Americans: The Democratic Experience|url = https://archive.org/details/americansdemocra00boor|url-access = registration|location = New York|publisher = Random House|pages=[https://archive.org/details/americansdemocra00boor/page/120 120\u2013125]}}</ref><ref name=\"Insane in the Plains\">{{cite news|last = Rich|first = N.|date = 2017-07-12|df = dmy-all|title = American Dreams: O Pioneers! by Willa Cather|url = https://www.thedailybeast.com/american-dreams-o-pioneers-by-willa-cather|newspaper = The Daily Beast|accessdate = 2019-10-26}}</ref>\n\n== Causes ==\nPrairie madness was caused by the isolation and tough living conditions on the Prairie. The level of isolation depended on the topography and geography of the region. Most examples of prairie madness come from the Great Plains region. One explanation for these high levels of isolation was the [[Homestead Acts|Homestead Act of 1862]]. This act stipulated that a person would be given a tract of 160 acres if they were able to live on it and make something out of it in a five-year period. The farms of the Homestead Act were at least half a mile apart, but usually much more.<ref name=\"The Americans\" /> There was little settlement and community on the Plains and settlers had to be almost completely self-sufficient.\n\nThe lack of quick and easily available transportation was also a cause of prairie madness; settlers were far apart from one another and they could not see their neighbors or get to town easily. (In many areas, towns were usually located along the railroads and 10-20 miles apart -- close enough for people to bring their goods to market within a day's travel, but not close enough for most people to see town on more than an infrequent basis. This particularly applied to women who were often left behind to tend to family and farm while the men went to town.) Those who had family back on the East coast could not visit their families without embarking on a long journey. Settlers were very alone. This isolation also caused problems with medical care; it took such a long time to get to the farms that when children fell sick they frequently died. This caused a lot of trauma for the parents, and contributed to prairie madness.\n\nAnother major cause of prairie madness was the harsh weather and environment of the Plains, including long, cold winters filled with blizzards followed by short, hot summers. Once winter came, it seemed that all signs of life such as plants, and animals had disappeared. Farmers would be stuck in their houses under several feet of snow when the blizzards struck, and the family would be cramped inside for days at a time.<ref name=Underwood>{{cite book|last = Meldrum|first = B.

Others tried to adapt to the entirely new way of life, and abandoned the old ways, but still fell victim to madness. Some coping mechanisms to escape the emotional trauma of moving to the prairie was to continually move around to new locations, or to move back East.<ref name=\"Underwood\" />\n\nImmigrants were particularly at risk for prairie madness. Immigrant families not only had to suffer from isolation, but the settlers who lived in their area often had different languages and customs. As such, this was an even further separation from society. Immigrant families were also hard-hit by prairie madness because they came from communities in Europe that were very close-knit small villages and life on the prairie was a terrible shock for them.<ref name=\"The Americans\" />\n\nThere is a debate between scholars as to whether the condition affected women more than men, although there is documentation of both cases in both fiction and non-fiction from the nineteenth century. Women and men each had different manifestations of the disease, women turning towards social withdrawal and men to violence.<ref name=\"Underwood\" />\n\n== Symptoms ==\n[[File:DSCN5051 greatplainswestofkearney e.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Great Plains west of [[Kearney, Nebraska]]]]\nSince prairie madness does not refer to a clinical term, there is no specific set of symptoms of the affliction. However, the descriptions of prairie madness in historical writing, personal accounts, and Western literature elucidate what some of the effects of the disease were.\n\nThe symptoms of prairie madness were similar to those of [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. The women affected by prairie madness were said to show symptoms such as crying, slovenly dress, and withdrawal from social interactions. Men also showed signs of depression, which sometimes manifested in violence. Prairie madness was not unique from other types of depression, but the harsh conditions on the prairie triggered this depression, and it was difficult to overcome without getting off of the prairie.<ref name=\"Underwood\" />\n\nIn extreme cases, the depression would lead to mental breakdown. This could lead to suicide. There are theories that the suicides caused by prairie madness were typically committed by women, and performed in an exhibitionist fashion. Prairie madness did not typically lead to suicide, and this is depicted more in fictional stories than it is seen in the historical record.<ref name=\"Underwood\" />\n\n== Decline ==\nPrairie madness virtually disappears from the historical and literary record during the 20th century.

Counterclockwise: Jabberjaw (drums), Bubbles (keyboard), Biff (guitar), Shelly (tambourine) and Clamhead (bass).]]\n* '''Jabberjaw''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]])&nbsp;\u2013 Jabberjaw is an air-breathing, [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[great white shark]] whose voice and mannerisms were similar to [[Curly Howard]] of [[The Three Stooges]]. Jabberjaw found it hard to get respect in a society where \"shark ejectors\" ([[robot]]s that would guard various buildings or cities against sharks being allowed to enter) were commonplace.  These robots, as well as unpleasant treatment from others, frequently prompt him to utter some variation of his catchphrase (borrowed from the [[comedian]] [[Rodney Dangerfield]]): \"''I don't get no respect!''\"  He has the unique ability to change his shape or adapt himself to act like various objects such as a trampoline, parachute, jack, throw rug, etc., either to get himself and the gang out of a jam, or just to hide.\n* '''Biff''' (voiced by [[Tommy Cook (actor)|Tommy Cook]])&nbsp;\u2013 Biff is an athletic, handsome, brown-haired young man who is the band's [[guitar|guitar player]] and level-headed leader who books all the gigs.  In many episodes, his hair is drawn black.  His main catchphrase is ''\"Jumpin' jellyfish!\"'' (occasionally, ''\"Hoppin' halibut!\"'')\n* '''Shelly''' (voiced by [[Patricia Parris|Pat Parris]])&nbsp;\u2013 Shelly is a dark-haired young woman who plays [[tambourine]] for The Neptunes. She is attractive and intelligent, but haughty, vain and abrasive (like ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats']]'' [[Josie and the Pussycats (comics)#Alexandra Cabot and Sebastian|Alexandra]]) and considers herself to be the star of the band. While she holds a great deal of disdain for Jabberjaw (or \"''Blubberhead''\" as she calls him), she does have some grudging fondness for him deep down and occasionally shows it.\n* '''Bubbles''' (voiced by [[Julie McWhirter]])&nbsp;\u2013 Bubbles is a young woman with blonde, curly hair who plays [[Electronic keyboard|keyboard]] for The Neptunes. She is extremely ditzy and dimwitted, has a cute giggle, similar to ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats']]'' [[Josie and the Pussycats (comics)#Melody|Melody]]. Shelly sometimes nicknames her \"''Ding-a-Ling''\" or \"''Bubblehead''\". Whenever she volunteers to help, she usually ends up messing it up.\n* '''Clamhead''' (voiced by [[Barry Gordon]])&nbsp;\u2013 Clamhead is a young man who plays [[Double bass|bass]] for The Neptunes. His catchphrases are crying out \"''Abba-abba-abba!''\" and \"''Wowee-wow-wow-wow!''\" (or some variation, commonly featuring the word \"zowie\") whenever he gets excited. Clamhead is Jabberjaw's best friend.<ref>America Toons In: A History of Television Animation By David Perlmutter page 154</ref>\n\n==Broadcast history==\nSixteen 30-minute episodes of ''Jabberjaw'' were produced, which aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Saturday Morning from September 11, 1976, to September 3, 1977, and rebroadcast for a second season of reruns on Sunday Morning from September 11, 1977, to September 3, 1978.

Counterclockwise: Jabberjaw (drums), Bubbles (keyboard), Biff (guitar), Shelly (tambourine) and Clamhead (bass).]]\n* '''Jabberjaw''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]])&nbsp;\u2013 Jabberjaw is an air-breathing, [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[great white shark]] whose voice and mannerisms were similar to [[Curly Howard]] of [[The Three Stooges]]. Jabberjaw found it hard to get respect in a society where \"shark ejectors\" ([[robot]]s that would guard various buildings or cities against sharks being allowed to enter) were commonplace.  These robots, as well as unpleasant treatment from others, frequently prompt him to utter some variation of his catchphrase (borrowed from the [[comedian]] [[Rodney Dangerfield]]): \"''I don't get no respect!''\"  He has the unique ability to change his shape or adapt himself to act like various objects such as a trampoline, parachute, jack, throw rug, etc., either to get himself and the gang out of a jam, or just to hide.\n* '''Biff''' (voiced by [[Tommy Cook (actor)|Tommy Cook]])&nbsp;\u2013 Biff is an athletic, handsome, brown-haired young man who is the band's [[guitar|guitar player]] and level-headed leader who books all the gigs.  In many episodes, his hair is drawn black.  His main catchphrase is ''\"Jumpin' jellyfish!\"'' (occasionally, ''\"Hoppin' halibut!\"'')\n* '''Shelly''' (voiced by [[Patricia Parris|Pat Parris]])&nbsp;\u2013 Shelly is a dark-haired young woman who plays [[tambourine]] for The Neptunes. She is attractive and intelligent, but haughty, vain and abrasive (like ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats']]'' [[Josie and the Pussycats (comics)#Alexandra Cabot and Sebastian|Alexandra]]) and considers herself to be the star of the band. While she holds a great deal of disdain for Jabberjaw (or \"''Blubberhead''\" as she calls him), she does have some grudging fondness for him deep down and occasionally shows it.\n* '''Bubbles''' (voiced by [[Julie McWhirter]])&nbsp;\u2013 Bubbles is a young woman with blonde, curly hair who plays [[Electronic keyboard|keyboard]] for The Neptunes. She is extremely ditzy and dimwitted, has a cute giggle, similar to ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats']]'' [[Josie and the Pussycats (comics)#Melody|Melody]]. Shelly sometimes nicknames her \"''Ding-a-Ling''\" or \"''Bubblehead''\". Whenever she volunteers to help, she usually ends up messing it up.\n* '''Clamhead''' (voiced by [[Barry Gordon]])&nbsp;\u2013 Clamhead is a young man who plays [[Double bass|bass]] for The Neptunes. His catchphrases are crying out \"''Abba-abba-abba!''\" and \"''Wowee-wow-wow-wow!''\" (or some variation, commonly featuring the word \"zowie\") whenever he gets excited. Clamhead is Jabberjaw's best friend.<ref>America Toons In: A History of Television Animation By David Perlmutter page 154</ref>\n\n==Broadcast history==\nSixteen 30-minute episodes of ''Jabberjaw'' were produced, which aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Saturday Morning from September 11, 1976, to September 3, 1977, and rebroadcast for a second season of reruns on Sunday Morning from September 11, 1977, to September 3, 1978.

These co-reactants are often referred to as hardeners or curatives, and the cross-linking reaction is commonly referred to as curing.\n\nReaction of polyepoxides with themselves or with polyfunctional hardeners forms a [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]]ting [[polymer]], often with favorable mechanical properties and high thermal and chemical resistance. Epoxy has a wide range of applications, including metal coatings, use in electronics/electrical components/LEDs, high tension electrical insulators, paint brush manufacturing, [[fibre-reinforced plastic|fiber-reinforced plastic]] materials, and [[adhesive]]s for structural and other purposes.\n\n== Epoxy resins (prepolymers and monomers) ==\nMost of the commercially used epoxy monomers are produced by the reaction of a compound with [[Hydroxy group|acidic hydroxy groups]] and [[epichlorohydrin]]:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis epoxide Epichlorohydrin.svg|400px|First the hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by dehydrohalogenation.]]\n:<small>First a hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by [[dehydrohalogenation]].</small>\n\nEpoxy resins produced from such epoxy monomers are called [[Glycidol|glycidyl]]-based epoxy resins. The hydroxy group may be derived from [[aliphatic diol]]s, [[polyol]]s (polyether polyols), [[phenolic compounds]] or [[dicarboxylic acid]]s. Phenols can be compounds such as [[bisphenol A]] and [[novolak]]. Polyols can be compounds such as [[1,4-Butanediol|1,4-butanediol]]. Di- and polyols lead to diglycid polyethers. Dicarboxylic acids such as hexahydrophthalic acid are used for diglycide ester resins. Instead of a hydroxy group, also the nitrogen atom of an [[amine]] or [[amide]] can be  reacted with epichlorohydrin.\n\nThe other production route for epoxy resins is the conversion of [[Aliphatic alkene|aliphatic]] or [[cycloaliphatic alkene]]s with [[peracid]]s:<ref name=\"Ullmann\" /><ref name=\"KunstChem\">[[Wolfgang Kaiser (Chemiker)|Wolfgang Kaiser]]: ''Kunststoffchemie f\u00fcr Ingenieure.'' 3.

Bisphenol A-based resins are the most widely commercialised resins but also other [[Bisphenol|bisphenols]] are analogously reacted with epichlorohydrin, for example [[Bisphenol F]].\n\n:[[File:Diglycidether.svg|400px|Synthesis of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether.]]\n:<small>In this two-stage reaction, epichlorohydrin is first added to bisphenol A (bis(3-chloro-2-hydroxy-propoxy)bisphenol A is formed), then a bisepoxide is formed in a condensation reaction with a stoichiometric amount of sodium hydroxide. The chlorine atom is released as [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl), the hydrogen atom as of water.</small>\n\nHigher molecular weight diglycidyl ethers (n \u2265 1) are formed by the reaction of the bisphenol A diglycidyl ether formed with further bisphenol A, this is called prepolymerization:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether higher Mw.svg|600px|Synthesis of bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether with a high [[molar mass]].]]\n\nA product comprising a few repeat units (''n'' = 1 to 2) is a viscous, clear liquid; this is called a liquid epoxy resin. A product comprising more repeating units (''n'' = 2 to 30) is at room temperature a colourless solid, which is correspondingly referred to as solid epoxy resin.\n\nInstead of bisphenol A, other bisphenols (especially [[bisphenol F]]) or brominated bisphenols (e. g. [[tetrabromobisphenol A]]) can be used for the said [[epoxidation]] and prepolymerisation. [[Bisphenol F]] may undergo epoxy resin formation in a similar fashion to bisphenol A. These resins typically have lower viscosity and a higher mean epoxy content per gram than bisphenol A resins, which (once cured) gives them increased chemical resistance.\n\nImportant epoxy resins are produced from combining [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[bisphenol A]] to give [[bisphenol A diglycidyl ether]]s.\n[[File:Epoxy prepolymer chemical structure.png|thumb|300px|Structure of bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether epoxy resin: ''n'' denotes the number of polymerized subunits and is typically in the range from 0 to 25]]\nIncreasing the ratio of bisphenol A to epichlorohydrin during manufacture produces higher molecular weight linear polyethers with glycidyl end groups, which are semi-solid to hard crystalline materials at room temperature depending on the molecular weight achieved. This route of synthesis is known as the \"taffy\" process. More modern manufacturing methods of higher molecular weight epoxy resins is to start with liquid epoxy resin (LER) and add a calculated amount of bisphenol A and then a catalyst is added and the reaction heated to circa {{convert|160|C|F}}. This process is known as \"advancement\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5521261.pdf |title=Epoxy resin mixtures containing advancement catalysts |website=freepatentsonline.com |language=en |access-date=2018-08-29}}</ref>  As the molecular weight of the resin increases, the epoxide content reduces and the material behaves more and more like a [[thermoplastic]]. Very high molecular weight polycondensates (ca. 30 000 \u2013 70 000 g/mol) form a class known as phenoxy resins and contain virtually no epoxide groups (since the terminal epoxy groups are insignificant compared to the total size of the molecule). These resins do however contain hydroxyl groups throughout the backbone, which may also undergo other cross-linking reactions, e.g. with aminoplasts, phenoplasts and [[isocyanate]]s.\n\nEpoxy resins are polymeric or semi-polymeric materials or an [[oligomer]], and as such rarely exist as pure substances, since variable chain length results from the polymerisation reaction used to produce them. High purity grades can be produced for certain applications, e.g. using a distillation purification process. One downside of high purity liquid grades is their tendency to form crystalline solids due to their highly regular structure, which then require melting to enable processing.\n\nAn important criterion for epoxy resins is the epoxide group content. This is expressed as the \"'''epoxide equivalent weight'''\", which is the ratio between the molecular weight of the monomer and the number of epoxide groups.\nThis parameter is used to calculate the mass of co-reactant (hardener) to use when curing epoxy resins. Epoxies are typically cured with [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] or near-stoichiometric quantities of hardener to achieve the best physical properties.\n\n===Novolac===\n[[File:Epoxyphenol-Novolak.svg|thumb|General structure of epoxyphenol novolak with ''n'' usually in the range from 0 to 4. The compound is present in the form of various [[Structural isomer|constitutional isomers]].]]\n\nNovolaks are produced by reacting [[phenol]] with [[methanal]] (formaldehyde). The reaction of [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[novolak]]s produces novolaks with [[Glycidol|glycidyl residues]], such as epoxyphenol novolak (EPN) or epoxycresol novolak (ECN). These highly viscous to solid resins typically carry 2 to 6 epoxy groups per molecule. By curing, highly cross-linked polymers with high temperature and chemical resistance but low mechanical flexibility are formed due to the high functionality of these resins.<ref name=\"Ullmann\">{{cite journal |author = Ha Q. Pham, Maurice J.

These are highly viscous to solid resins with typical mean epoxide functionality of around 2 to 6. The high epoxide functionality of these resins forms a highly crosslinked polymer network displaying high temperature and chemical resistance, but low flexibility.\n\n=== Aliphatic ===\nThere are two common types of aliphatic epoxy resins: those obtained by epoxidation of double bonds (cycloaliphatic epoxides and epoxidized vegetable oils) and those formed by reaction with epichlorohydrin (glycidyl ethers and esters).\n\n[[File:Diepoxyester.svg|thumb|Structural formula of [[3,4-Epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3\u2019,4\u2019-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate]]]]\n\nCycloaliphatic epoxides contain one or more aliphatic rings in the molecule on which the oxirane ring is contained (e.g. [[3,4-Epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3\u2019,4\u2019-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate|3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3',4'-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate]]). They are produced by the reaction of a cyclic alkene with a [[peracid]] (see above).<ref>L. Hammerton, ed. by Rebecca Dolbey: ''Recent Developments in Epoxy Resins.'' RAPRA Review Reports, 1996, {{ISBN|978-1-85957-083-8}}, S.&nbsp;8.</ref>  Cycloaliphatic epoxides are characterised by their aliphatic structure, high oxirane content and the absence of chlorine, which results in low viscosity and (once cured) good weather resistance, low dielectric constants and high [[Glass transition|T<sub>g</sub>]]. However, aliphatic epoxy resins polymerize very slowly at room temperature, so higher temperatures and suitable accelerators are usually required. Because aliphatic epoxies have a lower electron density than aromatics, cycloaliphatic epoxies react less readily with nucleophiles than bisphenol A-based epoxy resins (which have aromatic ether groups). This means that conventional nucleophilic hardeners such as amines are hardly suitable for crosslinking. Cycloaliphatic epoxides are therefore usually homopolymerized thermally or UV-initiated in an electrophilic or cationic reaction. Due to the low dielectric constants and the absence of chlorine, cycloaliphatic epoxides are often used to encapsulate electronic systems, such as microchips or LEDs. They are also used for radiation-cured paints and varnishes. Due to their high price, however, their use has so far been limited to such applications.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nEpoxidized vegetable oils are formed by epoxidation of [[unsaturated fatty acids]] by reaction with peracids. In this case, the peracids can also be formed in situ by reacting carboxylic acids with hydrogen peroxide. Compared with LERs (liquid epoxy resins) they have very low viscosities. If, however, they are used in larger proportions as [[reactive diluent]]s, this often leads to reduced chemical and thermal resistance and to poorer mechanical properties of the cured epoxides. Large scale epoxidized vegetable oils such as epoxidized soy and lens oils are used to a large extent as secondary plasticizers and cost stabilizers for [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]].<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nAliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins of low molar mass (mono-, bi- or polyfunctional) are formed by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with aliphatic alcohols or polyols (glycidyl ethers are formed) or with aliphatic carboxylic acids (glycidyl esters are formed). The reaction is carried out in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide, analogous to the formation of bisphenol A-diglycidyl ether. Also aliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins usually have a low viscosity compared to aromatic epoxy resins. They are therefore added to other epoxy resins as [[reactive diluent]]s or as [[adhesion promoter]]s. Epoxy resins made of (long-chain) polyols are also added to improve tensile strength and impact strength.\n\nA related class is cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, which contains one or more cycloaliphatic rings in the molecule (e.g. 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate). This class also displays lower viscosity at room temperature, but offers significantly higher temperature resistance than the aliphatic epoxy diluents. However, reactivity is rather low compared to other classes of epoxy resin, and high temperature curing using suitable accelerators is normally required. As aromaticity is not present in these materials as it is in Bisphenol A and F resins, the UV stability is considerably improved.\n\n=== Halogenated ===\nHalogenated epoxy resins are admixed for special properties, in particular brominated and fluorinated epoxy resins are used.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nBrominated bisphenol A is used when flame retardant properties are required, such as in some electrical applications (e.g. [[printed circuit board]]s). The tetrabrominated bisphenol A (TBBPA, 2,2-bis(3,5-dibromophenyl)propane) or its diglycidyl ether, 2,2-bis[3,5-dibromo-4-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)phenyl]propane, can be added to the epoxy [[formulation]]. The formulation may then be reacted in the same way as pure bisphenol A. Some (non-crosslinked) epoxy resins with very high molar mass are added to engineering thermoplastics, again to achieve flame retardant properties.\n\nFluorinated epoxy resins have been investigated for some [[High-performance plastics|high performance applications]], such as the fluorinated diglycidether 5-heptafluoropropyl-1,3-bis[2-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)hexafluoro-2-propyl]benzene. As it has a low surface tension, it is added as a wetting agent (surfactant) for contact with glass fibres. Its reactivity to hardeners is comparable to that of bisphenol A. When cured, the epoxy resin leads to a thermosetting plastic with high chemical resistance and low water absorption. However, the commercial use of fluorinated epoxy resins is limited by their high cost and low T<sub>g</sub>.\n\n===Diluents===\nEpoxy resins diluents are typically formed by glycidylation of aliphatic alcohols or polyols. The resulting materials may be monofunctional (e.g. dodecanol glycidyl ether), difunctional (butanediol diglycidyl ether), or higher functionality (e.g. trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether). These resins typically display low viscosity at room temperature (10-200 mPa.s) and are often referred to as [[reactive diluent]]s. They are rarely used alone, but are rather employed to modify (reduce) the viscosity of other epoxy resins. This has led to the term \u2018modified epoxy resin\u2019 to denote those containing viscosity-lowering reactive diluents.\n\n===Glycidylamine ===\nGlycidylamine epoxy resins are higher functionality epoxies which are formed when aromatic amines are reacted with epichlorohydrin. Important industrial grades are triglycidyl-''p''-aminophenol (functionality 3) and ''N'',''N'',''N''\u2032,''N''\u2032-tetraglycidyl-bis-(4-aminophenyl)-methane (functionality 4). The resins are low to medium viscosity at room temperature, which makes them easier to process than EPN or ECN resins. This coupled with high reactivity, plus high temperature resistance and mechanical properties of the resulting cured network makes them important materials for aerospace composite applications.\n\n==Curing==\n[[File:VernetzteEpoxidharze.svg|thumb|320px|right|Structure of a cured epoxy glue. The triamine hardener is shown in red, the resin in black. The resin's epoxide groups have reacted with the hardener and are not present anymore. The material is highly [[crosslink]]ed and contains many OH groups, which confer adhesive properties.]]\nIn general, uncured epoxy resins have only poor mechanical, chemical and heat resistance properties. However, good properties are obtained by reacting the linear epoxy resin with suitable curatives to form three-dimensional cross-linked thermoset structures. This process is commonly referred to as curing or gelation process.<ref name=\"onepetro.org\">Hakiki, Farizal et al. (2015).

SPE/IATMI Asia Pacific Oil & Gas Conference and Exhibition, 20\u201322 October, Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia. doi: [https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-176457-MS 10.2118/176457-MS]</ref> Curing of epoxy resins is an [[exothermic reaction]] and in some cases produces sufficient heat to cause thermal degradation if not controlled.\n\nCuring may be achieved by reacting an epoxy with itself (homopolymerisation) or by forming a [[copolymer]] with polyfunctional curatives or '''hardeners'''. In principle, any molecule containing a reactive hydrogen may react with the epoxide groups of the epoxy resin. Common classes of hardeners for epoxy resins include amines, acids, acid anhydrides, phenols, alcohols and thiols. Relative reactivity (lowest first) is approximately in the order: phenol < anhydride < aromatic amine < cycloaliphatic amine < aliphatic amine < thiol.\n\nWhile some epoxy resin/ hardener combinations will cure at ambient temperature, many require heat, with temperatures up to {{cvt|150|C}} being common, and up to {{cvt|200|C}} for some specialist systems. Insufficient heat during cure will result in a network with incomplete polymerisation, and thus reduced mechanical, chemical and heat resistance. Cure temperature should typically attain the [[glass transition]] temperature (Tg) of the fully cured network in order to achieve maximum properties. Temperature is sometimes increased in a step-wise fashion to control the rate of curing and prevent excessive heat build-up from the exothermic reaction.\n\nHardeners which show only low or limited reactivity at ambient temperature, but which react with epoxy resins at elevated temperature are referred to as '''latent hardeners'''. When using latent hardeners, the epoxy resin and hardener may be mixed and stored for some time prior to use, which is advantageous for many industrial processes. Very latent hardeners enable one-component (1K) products to be produced, whereby the resin and hardener are supplied pre-mixed to the end user and only require heat to initiate curing. One-component products generally have shorter shelf-lives than standard 2-component systems, and products may require cooled storage and transport.\n\nThe epoxy curing reaction may be accelerated by addition of small quantities of [[accelerant|accelerators]]. Tertiary amines, carboxylic acids and alcohols (especially phenols) are effective accelerators. Bisphenol A is a highly effective and widely used accelerator, but is now increasingly replaced due to health concerns with this substance.\n\n===Homopolymerisation===\nEpoxy resin may be reacted with itself in the presence of an anionic catalyst (a Lewis base such as tertiary amines or imidazoles) or a cationic catalyst (a Lewis acid such as a boron trifluoride complex) to form a cured network. This process is known as catalytic homopolymerisation. The resulting network contains only ether bridges, and exhibits high thermal and chemical resistance, but is brittle and often requires elevated temperature for the curing process, so finds only niche applications industrially.\nEpoxy homopolymerisation is often used when there is a requirement for UV curing, since cationic UV catalysts may be employed (e.g. for [[UV coating]]s).\n\n===Amines===\nPolyfunctional primary amines form an important class of epoxy hardeners. Primary amines undergo an [[addition reaction]] with the epoxide group to form a hydroxyl group and a secondary amine. The secondary amine can further react with an epoxide to form a tertiary amine and an additional hydroxyl group. Kinetic studies have shown the reactivity of the primary amine to be approximately double that of the secondary amine. Use of a difunctional or polyfunctional amine forms a three-dimensional cross-linked network.\nAliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic amines are all employed as epoxy hardeners. Amine type hardeners will alter both the processing properties (viscosity, reactivity) and the final properties (mechanical, temperature and heat resistance) of the cured copolymer network. Thus amine structure is normally selected according to the application. Overall reactivity potential for different hardeners can roughly be ordered; aliphatic amines > cycloaliphatic amines > aromatic amines, though aliphatic amines with steric hindrance near the amino groups may react as slowly as some of the aromatic amines. Slower reactivity allows longer working times for processors. Temperature resistance generally increases in the same order, since aromatic amines form much more rigid structures than aliphatic amines. Aromatic amines were widely used as epoxy resin hardeners, due to the excellent end properties when mixed with a parent resin. Over the past few decades concern about the possible adverse health effects of many aromatic amines has led to increased use of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amine alternatives. Amines are also blended, adducted and reacted to alter properties and these amine resins are more often used to cure epoxy resins than a pure amine such as TETA. increasingly, WATER BASED polyamines are also used to help reduce the toxicity profile among other reasons. \n[[File:N1,N1'-(ethane-1,2-diyl)bis(ethane-1,2-diamine) 200.svg|thumb|150px|Structure of [[Triethylenetetramine|TETA]], a typical hardener. The amine (NH2) groups react with the epoxide groups of the resin during polymerisation.]]\n\n===Anhydrides===\nEpoxy resins may be cured with cyclic anhydrides at elevated temperatures. Reaction occurs only after opening of the anhydride ring, e.g. by secondary hydroxyl groups in the epoxy resin. A possible side reaction may also occur between the epoxide and hydroxyl groups, but this may suppressed by addition of tertiary amines.\nThe low viscosity and high latency of anhydride hardeners makes them suitable for processing systems which require addition of mineral fillers prior to curing, e.g. for high voltage electrical insulators.\n\n===Phenols===\nPolyphenols, such as bisphenol A or novolacs can react with epoxy resins at elevated temperatures ({{cvt|130|-|180|C|disp=comma}}), normally in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting material has ether linkages and displays higher chemical and oxidation resistance than typically obtained by curing with amines or anhydrides. Since many novolacs are solids, this class of hardeners is often employed for [[powder coating]]s.\n\n===Thiols===\nAlso known as mercaptans, thiols contain a sulfur which reacts very readily with the epoxide group, even at ambient or sub-ambient temperatures. While the resulting network does not typically display high temperature or chemical resistance, the high reactivity of the thiol group makes it useful for applications where heated curing is not possible, or very fast cure is required e.g. for domestic DIY adhesives and chemical [[rock bolt]] [[Anchor bolt|anchors]]. Thiols have a characteristic odour, which can be detected in many two-component household adhesives.\n\n==History==\nCondensation of epoxides and amines was first reported and patented by Paul Schlack of Germany in 1934.<ref>P.

Castan's work was licensed by [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals|Ciba]], Ltd. of Switzerland, which went on to become one of the three major epoxy resin producers worldwide. Ciba's epoxy business was spun off as Vantico in the late 1990s, which was subsequently sold in 2003 and became the Advanced Materials [[strategic business unit|business unit]] of [[Huntsman Corporation]] of the United States. In 1946, Sylvan Greenlee, working for the Devoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds Company, patented resin derived from bisphenol-A and epichlorohydrin.<ref>{{cite patent |country= US |inventor= Sylvan Owen Greenlee |assignee= DeVoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds |number= 2456408 |gdate= 1948-12-14 |title= Synthetic drying compositions }}</ref> Devoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds, which was active in the early days of the epoxy resin industry, was sold to [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Chemical]]; the division involved in this work was eventually sold, and via a series of other corporate transactions is now part of [[Hexion Inc.]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://epoxyflooringtech.com/history-of-epoxy-resin/|title=History of Epoxy Resin|website=epoxyflooringtech.com}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nThe applications for epoxy-based materials are extensive and include coatings, [[adhesive]]s and [[composite material]]s such as those using [[carbon fiber]] and [[fiberglass]] reinforcements (although [[polyester]], [[vinyl ester resin|vinyl ester]], and other [[thermosetting polymer|thermosetting]] [[resin]]s are also used for glass-reinforced plastic). The chemistry of epoxies and the range of commercially available variations allows cure polymers to be produced with a very broad range of properties. In general, epoxies are known for their excellent adhesion, chemical and heat resistance, good-to-excellent mechanical properties and very good [[Insulator (electrical)|electrical insulating]] properties. Many properties of epoxies can be modified (for example [[silver]]-filled epoxies with good [[electrical conductivity]] are available, although epoxies are typically electrically insulating). Variations offering high thermal insulation, or thermal conductivity combined with high electrical resistance for electronics applications, are available.<ref>{{cite book|last=May |first=Clayton A. |title=Epoxy Resins: Chemistry and Technology|publisher=Marcel Dekker Inc|location=New York|date=1987-12-23|edition=Second|page=794|isbn=0-8247-7690-9}}</ref>\n\nAs with other classes of thermoset polymer materials, blending different grades of epoxy resin, as well as use of additives, plasticizers or fillers is common to achieve the desired processing or final properties, or to reduce cost. Use of blending, additives and fillers is often referred to as '''formulating''' (see: [[formulation]].\n\n=== Paints and coatings ===\nTwo part epoxy coatings were developed for heavy duty service on metal substrates and use less energy than heat-cured [[powder coating]]s. These systems provide a tough, protective coating with excellent hardness. One part epoxy coatings are formulated as an emulsion in water, and can be cleaned up without solvents.\n\nEpoxy coatings are often used in industrial and automotive applications since they are more heat resistant than latex-based and alkyd-based paints. Epoxy paints tend to deteriorate, known as \"chalking out\", due to UV exposure.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bayliss |first= D.A. |title= Steelwork corrosion control |year= 2002 |publisher= Spon |location= London |isbn= 978-0-415-26101-2 |pages= 13.6.6 Chalking |edition= 2nd |author2=Deacon, D.H.}}</ref>\n\n[[Polyester]] epoxies are used as [[powder coating]]s for washers, driers and other \"white goods\". [[Fusion bonded epoxy coating|Fusion Bonded Epoxy Powder Coatings]] (FBE) are extensively used for corrosion protection of steel pipes and fittings used in the oil and gas industry, potable water transmission pipelines (steel), and concrete reinforcing [[rebar]]. Epoxy coatings are also widely used as [[Primer (paint)|primers]] to improve the adhesion of automotive and marine paints especially on metal surfaces where [[corrosion]] (rusting) resistance is important. Metal cans and containers are often coated with epoxy to prevent rusting, especially for foods like tomatoes that are [[acid]]ic.\n\nEpoxy resins have several flooring applcations. They are used for protection again mechanical wear, chemical attack and thermal stressing in places such as industrial facilities, car parks or retail establishments. They can also have decorative applications, such as [[terrazzo]] flooring, chip flooring, and colored aggregate flooring.\n\nEpoxies were modified in a variety of ways, Reacted with fatty acids derived from oils to yield epoxy esters, which were cured the same way as alkyds . Typical ones were L8(80% linseed, D4 (40% Dehydrated castor oil). These were often reacted with styrene to make styrenated epoxy esters, used as primers. Curing with phenolics to make drum linings, curing esters with amine resins and pre-curing epoxies with amino resins to make resistant top coats. \nOne of the best examples was a system of using solvent free epoxies for priming ships during construction, this used a system of hot airless spray with premixing at the head. This obviated the problem of solvent retention under the film, which caused adhesion problems later on.\n\n=== Adhesives ===<!-- [[Epoxy adhesive]] redirects here -->\n[[File:Titan epoxy.jpg|thumb|right|Special epoxy is strong enough to withstand the forces between a [[surfboard]] fin and the fin mount. This epoxy is waterproof and capable of [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]] underwater.

These high-performance adhesives are used in the construction of aircraft, automobiles, bicycles, boats, golf clubs, skis, snowboards, and other applications where high strength bonds are required. Epoxy adhesives can be developed to suit almost any application. They can be used as adhesives for wood, metal, glass, stone, and some plastics. They can be made flexible or rigid, [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]]/colored, fast setting or slow setting. Epoxy adhesives are better in heat and chemical resistance than other common adhesives. In general, epoxy adhesives cured with heat will be more heat- and chemical-resistant than those cured at room temperature.

Such epoxies are commonly used in [[optics]], [[optical fiber|fiber optics]], and [[optoelectronics]].\n\nRecent  developments are coatings for onshore, marine and offshore protection, as well as shipping containers. Traditionally solvent-borne, solvent-free or high-solids, state of the art products are waterborne epoxy systems to protect customers' metal assets from corrosion. This includes waterborne epoxy resin system for making zinc-rich primers.\n\n=== Industrial tooling and composites ===\nEpoxy systems are used in industrial tooling applications to produce [[Molding (process)|molds]], master models, [[laminate]]s, [[casting]]s, [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], and other industrial production aids. This \"plastic tooling\" replaces metal, wood and other traditional materials, and generally improves the efficiency and either lowers the overall cost or shortens the lead-time for many industrial processes. Epoxies are also used in producing fiber-reinforced or composite parts. They are more expensive than polyester resins and [[vinyl ester resin]]s, but usually produce stronger and more temperature-resistant [[thermoset polymer matrix]] composite parts.\n\n[[File:Nicholas-doherty-pONBhDyOFoM-unsplash.jpg|thumb|Offshore Wind Farm]]\n=== Wind turbine composites ===\nEpoxy resins are used as bonding matrix along with glass or carbon fiber fabrics to produce composites with very high strength to weight characteristics, allowing longer and more efficient rotor blades to be produced. In addition, for offshore and onshore wind energy installations, epoxy resins are used as protective coatings on steel towers, base struts and concrete foundations. Aliphatic polyurethane top coats are applied on top to ensure full UV protection, prolong operational lifetimes and lowering maintenance costs. Electric generators, connected via the drivetrain with the rotor blades, convert mechanical wind energy in usable electric energy, and rely on epoxies electrical insulation and high thermal resistance properties. The same applies to transformers, bushings, spacers, and composites cables connecting the windmills to the grid In Europe, wind energy components account for the largest segment of epoxy applications, about 27% of the market.<ref name=socio2013>[https://epoxy-europe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Epoxy_Socioeconomic_Study_Main_Findings_August-2017.pdf Epoxy Resins Committee > Socioeconomic Analysis] 2013</ref>\n\n===Leisure and marine===\nHigh strength and weight reduction are the main performance criteria for manufacturers of sport components. Skis, snowboards, surf and kite boards are fiber reinforced epoxy applications. Epoxy resin systems in combination with multi-axial, unidirectional, woven fabrics and variety of core materials play also a key role to manufacture high performance boats, yachts and commercial and military vessels. \n[https://www.thoughtco.com/composite-materials-in-boats-820410/ composite boats]\n\nEpoxies are sold in hardware stores, typically as a pack containing separate resin and hardener, which must be mixed immediately before use. They are also sold in boat shops as repair resins for marine applications. Epoxies typically are not used in the outer layer of a boat because they deteriorate by exposure to [[UV]] light. They are often used during boat repair and assembly, and then over-coated with conventional or two-part polyurethane paint or marine-varnishes that provide UV protection.\n\nThere are two main areas of marine use. Because of the better mechanical properties relative to the more common [[polyester resins]], epoxies are used for commercial manufacture of components where a high strength/weight ratio is required. The second area is that their strength, gap filling properties and excellent adhesion to many materials including timber have created a boom in amateur building projects including aircraft and boats.\n\nNormal [[gelcoat]] formulated for use with [[polyester]] resins and vinylester resins does not adhere to epoxy surfaces, though epoxy adheres very well if applied to polyester resin surfaces. \"Flocoat\" that is normally used to coat the interior of polyester fibreglass yachts is also compatible with epoxies.\n\nEpoxy materials tend to harden somewhat more gradually, while polyester materials tend to harden quickly, particularly if a lot of catalyst is used.<ref>Hakiki, F., Nuraeni, N., Salam, D.D., Aditya, W., Akbari, A., Mazrad, Z.A.I. and Siregar, S. [http://archives.datapages.com/data/ipa_pdf/2015/ipa15-se-025.htm Preliminary Study on Epoxy-Based Polymer for Water Shut-Off Application]. Paper IPA15-SE-025. Proceeding of The 39th IPA Conference and Exhibition, Jakarta, Indonesia, May 2015.</ref> The chemical reactions in both cases are exothermic. Large quantities of mix will generate their own heat and greatly speed the reaction, so it is usual to mix small amounts which can be used quickly.\n\nWhile it is common to associate polyester resins and epoxy resins, their properties are sufficiently different that they are properly treated as distinct materials. Polyester resins are typically low strength unless used with a reinforcing material like glass fibre, are relatively brittle unless reinforced, and have low adhesion. Epoxies, by contrast, are inherently strong, somewhat flexible and have excellent adhesion. However, polyester resins are much cheaper.\n\nEpoxy resins typically require a precise mix of two components which form a third chemical. Depending on the properties required, the ratio may be anything from 1:1 or over 10:1, but in every case they must be mixed exactly. The final product is then a precise thermo-setting plastic. Until they are mixed the two elements are relatively inert, although the 'hardeners' tend to be more chemically active and should be protected from the atmosphere and moisture. The rate of the reaction can be changed by using different hardeners, which may change the nature of the final product, or by controlling the temperature.\n\nBy contrast, polyester resins are usually made available in a 'promoted' form, such that the progress of previously-mixed resins from liquid to solid is already underway, albeit very slowly. The only variable available to the user is to change the rate of this process using a catalyst, often Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone-Peroxide ([[MEKP]]), which is very toxic. The presence of the catalyst in the final product actually detracts from the desirable properties, so that small amounts of catalyst are preferable, so long as the hardening proceeds at an acceptable pace. The rate of cure of polyesters can therefore be controlled by the amount and type of catalyst as well as by the temperature.\n\nAs adhesives, epoxies bond in three ways: a) Mechanically, because the bonding surfaces are roughened; b) by proximity, because the cured resins are physically so close to the bonding surfaces that they are hard to separate; c) ionically, because the epoxy resins form ionic bonds at an atomic level with the bonding surfaces. This last is substantially the strongest of the three. By contrast, polyester resins can only bond using the first two of these, which greatly reduces their utility as adhesives and in marine repair.\n\n=== Aerospace ===\nIn the aerospace industry, epoxy is used as a structural matrix material which is then reinforced by fiber. Typical fiber reinforcements include [[glass]], [[carbon]], [[Kevlar]], and [[boron]].\nEpoxies are also used as a structural [[glue]]. Materials like [[wood]], and others that are 'low-tech' are glued with epoxy resin. Epoxies generally out-perform most other resin types in terms of mechanical properties and resistance to environmental degradation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://netcomposites.com/guide/resin-systems/epoxy-resins/ |title=Epoxy Resins |website=netcomposites.com |language=en |access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\nGlider and small aircraft designers considered epoxy based composites in an early date.

The use of composite leaf springs in particular in light trucks increases the cargo load. [https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/composite-leaf-springs-saving-weight-in-production-suspension-systems/ Composite LEaf Springs]  50 % mass reduction is achievable when replacing steel for the manufacture of coil springs by fiber reinforced Epoxy.  New generation, in particular of electrically driven cars, require chassis and other significant load bearing structures made from CFRP. But, mass-production requires adequate automotive manufacturing. Traditionally, the poly-addition reaction of epoxy with curatives is more time consuming than metal forming or unsaturated polyester cure. But fast processing and higher thermo-mechanical resistance is required. In numbers, coming from low double digit minutes for cure to single digits and increasing the thermo-mechanical resistance from 130\u00b0C to 180\u00b0C and higher.

Such epoxy resin formulations are relevant to the electrical and electronics industry in voltage ranges from 400 kV down to  >1V.The purpose of the products is to insulate, protect or shield the environment from electric current or the devices from the environment. Formulated bisphenol-based epoxy resins, cured with dicarboxylic anhydrides or amines are used for indoor applications. Cycloaliphatic epoxy resins, preferably 1,2-Cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, bis(2,3-epoxypropyl) ester, in combination with cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic anhydrides and silanised silica flour are the base for outdoor-resistant electrical insulation, e.g. production of insulators, bushings, instrument transformers.\nMost common processing technologies are Vacuum Pressure Impregnation for power generators, Vacuum Casting and Automatic Pressure Gelation  for medium voltage equipment and potting under vacuum for e.g. ignition coils and small transformers or potting under ambient pressure for e.g. capacitors.\n\nEpoxy resins are applied using the technology of [[resin dispensing]].\n\n===Electronics===\n[[File:Hybridcircuit.jpg|thumb|An epoxy [[conformal coating|encapsulated]] [[hybrid circuit]] on a [[printed circuit board]].]]\nIn the electronics industry epoxy resins are the primary resin used in overmolding [[integrated circuit]]s, [[transistor]]s and [[hybrid circuit]]s and making [[printed circuit boards]]. The largest volume type of circuit board\u2014an \"[[FR-4]] board\"\u2014is a sandwich of layers of glass cloth bonded into a composite by an epoxy resin. Epoxy resins are used to bond copper foil to circuit board substrates, and are a component of the solder mask on many circuit boards. Since these applications require self-extinguishing properties, flame retardant epoxy resins or epoxy formulations with flame retardant additives are utilized.\n\n=== Petroleum and petrochemical ===\nEpoxies can be used to plug selective layers in a reservoir which are producing excessive brine.

The epoxy resin market is dominated by the Asia-Pacific region. China is the major producer and consumer globally, contributing to almost 50% of the global resin global capacity in 2018. The global market is made up of approximately 50\u2013100 manufacturers of basic or commodity epoxy resins and hardeners. In Europe, the largest markets for epoxy resins are Germany, Italy, France and the UK.\n\nThese commodity epoxy [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]] mentioned above typically do not sell epoxy resins in a form usable to smaller end users, so there is another group of companies that purchase epoxy raw materials from the major producers and then compounds (blends, modifies, or otherwise customizes) epoxy systems from these [[raw material]]s. These companies are known as \"formulators\". The majority of the epoxy systems sold are produced by these formulators and they comprise over 60% of the dollar value of the epoxy market. There are hundreds of ways that these formulators can modify epoxies\u2014by adding [[mineral]] fillers ([[talc]], [[silica]], [[alumina]], etc.), by adding flexibilizers, [[viscosity]] reducers, [[colorant]]s, thickeners, accelerators, [[adhesion]] promoters, etc. These modifications are made to reduce costs, to improve performance, and to improve processing convenience. As a result, a typical formulator sells dozens or even thousands of formulations\u2014each tailored to the requirements of a particular application or market.\n\nThe raw materials for epoxy resin production are today largely [[petroleum]] derived, although some plant derived sources are now becoming commercially available (e.g. plant derived glycerol used to make [[epichlorohydrin]]).\n\n== Health risks ==\n\nThe primary risk associated with epoxy use is often related to the hardener component and not to the epoxy resin itself. Amine hardeners in particular are generally [[corrosive]], but may also be classed as [[toxic]] or [[carcinogenic/mutagenic]]. Aromatic amines present a particular health hazard (most are known or suspected carcinogens), but their use is now restricted to specific industrial applications, and safer aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amines are commonly employed.\nAnother group of hardeners which have come into the regulatory focus over recent years are dicarboxylic anhydrides, namely Hexahydropthalic-Anhydride (HHPA) and Methyl-Hexahydrophthalic-Anhydride (m-HHPA). Both substances have been identified under REACH as substances of equivalent concern due to the potential risk of respiratory sensitization. This SVHC identification implies that both substances are listed on the REACH candidate list for further regulatory measures.\nLiquid epoxy resins in their uncured state are mostly classed as [[irritant]] to the eyes and skin, as well as toxic to aquatic organisms. Solid epoxy resins are generally safer than liquid epoxy resins, and many are classified non-hazardous materials. One particular risk associated with epoxy resins is sensitization. The risk has been shown to be more pronounced in epoxy resins containing low molecular weight epoxy diluents.[21] Exposure to epoxy resins can, over time, induce an [[allergic reaction]]. Sensitization generally occurs due to repeated exposure (e.g. through poor working hygiene or lack of protective equipment) over a long period of time. Allergic reaction sometimes occurs at a time which is delayed several days from the exposure. Allergic reaction is often visible in the form of [[dermatitis]], particularly in areas where the exposure has been highest (commonly hands and forearms). There is some incidence that use of epoxy resin systems may cause sensitizer-induced occupational asthma in some exposed workers. However, this may apply to specific application technologies, e.g. spray application, insufficient use of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and the use of volatile components, e.g. amine-based curing agents. Most epoxy resins have due to their high(er) molecular weight a low vapor pressure, thus do not vaporize easily.  \n[[Bisphenol-A]], which is a major building block to manufacture Bis-A- epoxy resins, has been identified as an endocrine disruptor for human health and the environment under REACH. The concept of endocrine disruption is not without controversy within the scientific community. Substances which are typically quoted in the context of endocrine disruption are xeno- and phytoestrogens, i.e. substances which mimic the effects of the human female sex hormone estrogen. The strength of a physiological response to natural estrogen or xenoestrogen is dependent on the affinity to bind to estrogen receptors on the cell surface of target organs or tissues. Human estrogen has a high binding affinity to estrogen receptors and thus elicits a physiological response at very low concentrations at nanomolar or sub-nanomolar level.\nXeno- or phytoestrogens however, have a much lower binding affinity to the estrogen receptors and as such require a much higher concentration to elicit a similar physiological response as natural estrogen. The uptake of such concentrations via food ingestion does not seem plausible for most xenoestrogens such as BPA, as it would require ingesting vast quantities of canned food stuffs or beverages to induce an appreciable effect. Consequently, the risk of adverse effects for BPA exposure via a normal diet is considered to be relatively insignificant.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Thermosetting polymer]]\n* [[Thermoset polymer matrix]]\n* [[Plastic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220105252/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm Epoxy Resin health hazards] (California Department of Health Services) 21 April 2008 @ [[Wayback Machine]] [https://epoxi.es/2HfHeiX https://web.archive.org/web/20080421095718/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm]\n* [http://pslc.ws/macrog/epoxy.htm The chemistry of epoxide], simple to understand\n\n<!-- LocalWords: catalyzing epoxies -->\n\n[[Category:Organic polymers]]\n[[Category:Adhesives]]\n[[Category:Synthetic resins]]\n[[Category:Thermosetting plastics]]\n\n[[da:Kunstharpiks]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the thermoset plastic materials|the chemical group|epoxide}}\n{{citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:FiveMinEpoxy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A syringe of \"5-minute\" epoxy glue, containing separate compartments for the epoxy resin and the hardener.]]\n[[File:Epoxide_generic.png|thumb|Structure of the epoxide group, a reactive functional group present in all epoxy resins.]]\n'''Epoxy''' refers to any of the basic components or [[Curing (chemistry)|cured]] end products of '''epoxy resins''', as well as a colloquial name for the [[epoxide]] functional group.<ref name=\"May2018\">{{cite book |author=Clayton May |title=Epoxy Resins: Chemistry and Technology (Second Edition) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1XlaDwAAQBAJ&pg=RA2-PA64&lpg=RA2-PA64&focus=viewport&vq=%22Epoxies+are+the+resins+most+commonly+employed%22&dq=may+Epoxy+Resins:+Chemistry+and+Technology+Second+Edition,+%22Epoxies+are+the+resins+most+commonly+employed+for+electrical+and+electronic+applications%22#v=onepage&q=%22Epoxies%20are%20the%20resins%20most%20commonly%20employed%22&f=false |date=11 May 2018 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-351-44995-3 |page=65 |quote=Epoxies are the resins most commonly employed for electrical and electronic applications.

These co-reactants are often referred to as hardeners or curatives, and the cross-linking reaction is commonly referred to as curing.\n\nReaction of polyepoxides with themselves or with polyfunctional hardeners forms a [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]]ting [[polymer]], often with favorable mechanical properties and high thermal and chemical resistance. Epoxy has a wide range of applications, including metal coatings, use in electronics/electrical components/LEDs, high tension electrical insulators, paint brush manufacturing, [[fibre-reinforced plastic|fiber-reinforced plastic]] materials, and [[adhesive]]s for structural and other purposes.\n\n== Epoxy resins (prepolymers and monomers) ==\nMost of the commercially used epoxy monomers are produced by the reaction of a compound with [[Hydroxy group|acidic hydroxy groups]] and [[epichlorohydrin]]:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis epoxide Epichlorohydrin.svg|400px|First the hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by dehydrohalogenation.]]\n:<small>First a hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by [[dehydrohalogenation]].</small>\n\nEpoxy resins produced from such epoxy monomers are called [[Glycidol|glycidyl]]-based epoxy resins. The hydroxy group may be derived from [[aliphatic diol]]s, [[polyol]]s (polyether polyols), [[phenolic compounds]] or [[dicarboxylic acid]]s. Phenols can be compounds such as [[bisphenol A]] and [[novolak]]. Polyols can be compounds such as [[1,4-Butanediol|1,4-butanediol]]. Di- and polyols lead to diglycid polyethers. Dicarboxylic acids such as hexahydrophthalic acid are used for diglycide ester resins. Instead of a hydroxy group, also the nitrogen atom of an [[amine]] or [[amide]] can be  reacted with epichlorohydrin.\n\nThe other production route for epoxy resins is the conversion of [[Aliphatic alkene|aliphatic]] or [[cycloaliphatic alkene]]s with [[peracid]]s:<ref name=\"Ullmann\" /><ref name=\"KunstChem\">[[Wolfgang Kaiser (Chemiker)|Wolfgang Kaiser]]: ''Kunststoffchemie f\u00fcr Ingenieure.'' 3.

Bisphenol A-based resins are the most widely commercialised resins but also other [[Bisphenol|bisphenols]] are analogously reacted with epichlorohydrin, for example [[Bisphenol F]].\n\n:[[File:Diglycidether.svg|400px|Synthesis of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether.]]\n:<small>In this two-stage reaction, epichlorohydrin is first added to bisphenol A (bis(3-chloro-2-hydroxy-propoxy)bisphenol A is formed), then a bisepoxide is formed in a condensation reaction with a stoichiometric amount of sodium hydroxide. The chlorine atom is released as [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl), the hydrogen atom as of water.</small>\n\nHigher molecular weight diglycidyl ethers (n \u2265 1) are formed by the reaction of the bisphenol A diglycidyl ether formed with further bisphenol A, this is called prepolymerization:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether higher Mw.svg|600px|Synthesis of bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether with a high [[molar mass]].]]\n\nA product comprising a few repeat units (''n'' = 1 to 2) is a viscous, clear liquid; this is called a liquid epoxy resin. A product comprising more repeating units (''n'' = 2 to 30) is at room temperature a colourless solid, which is correspondingly referred to as solid epoxy resin.\n\nInstead of bisphenol A, other bisphenols (especially [[bisphenol F]]) or brominated bisphenols (e. g. [[tetrabromobisphenol A]]) can be used for the said [[epoxidation]] and prepolymerisation. [[Bisphenol F]] may undergo epoxy resin formation in a similar fashion to bisphenol A. These resins typically have lower viscosity and a higher mean epoxy content per gram than bisphenol A resins, which (once cured) gives them increased chemical resistance.\n\nImportant epoxy resins are produced from combining [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[bisphenol A]] to give [[bisphenol A diglycidyl ether]]s.\n[[File:Epoxy prepolymer chemical structure.png|thumb|300px|Structure of bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether epoxy resin: ''n'' denotes the number of polymerized subunits and is typically in the range from 0 to 25]]\nIncreasing the ratio of bisphenol A to epichlorohydrin during manufacture produces higher molecular weight linear polyethers with glycidyl end groups, which are semi-solid to hard crystalline materials at room temperature depending on the molecular weight achieved. This route of synthesis is known as the \"taffy\" process. More modern manufacturing methods of higher molecular weight epoxy resins is to start with liquid epoxy resin (LER) and add a calculated amount of bisphenol A and then a catalyst is added and the reaction heated to circa {{convert|160|C|F}}. This process is known as \"advancement\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5521261.pdf |title=Epoxy resin mixtures containing advancement catalysts |website=freepatentsonline.com |language=en |access-date=2018-08-29}}</ref>  As the molecular weight of the resin increases, the epoxide content reduces and the material behaves more and more like a [[thermoplastic]]. Very high molecular weight polycondensates (ca. 30 000 \u2013 70 000 g/mol) form a class known as phenoxy resins and contain virtually no epoxide groups (since the terminal epoxy groups are insignificant compared to the total size of the molecule). These resins do however contain hydroxyl groups throughout the backbone, which may also undergo other cross-linking reactions, e.g. with aminoplasts, phenoplasts and [[isocyanate]]s.\n\nEpoxy resins are polymeric or semi-polymeric materials or an [[oligomer]], and as such rarely exist as pure substances, since variable chain length results from the polymerisation reaction used to produce them. High purity grades can be produced for certain applications, e.g. using a distillation purification process. One downside of high purity liquid grades is their tendency to form crystalline solids due to their highly regular structure, which then require melting to enable processing.\n\nAn important criterion for epoxy resins is the epoxide group content. This is expressed as the \"'''epoxide equivalent weight'''\", which is the ratio between the molecular weight of the monomer and the number of epoxide groups.\nThis parameter is used to calculate the mass of co-reactant (hardener) to use when curing epoxy resins. Epoxies are typically cured with [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] or near-stoichiometric quantities of hardener to achieve the best physical properties.\n\n===Novolac===\n[[File:Epoxyphenol-Novolak.svg|thumb|General structure of epoxyphenol novolak with ''n'' usually in the range from 0 to 4.

RAPRA Review Reports, 1996, {{ISBN|978-1-85957-083-8}}, S.&nbsp;8.</ref>  Cycloaliphatic epoxides are characterised by their aliphatic structure, high oxirane content and the absence of chlorine, which results in low viscosity and (once cured) good weather resistance, low dielectric constants and high [[Glass transition|T<sub>g</sub>]]. However, aliphatic epoxy resins polymerize very slowly at room temperature, so higher temperatures and suitable accelerators are usually required. Because aliphatic epoxies have a lower electron density than aromatics, cycloaliphatic epoxies react less readily with nucleophiles than bisphenol A-based epoxy resins (which have aromatic ether groups). This means that conventional nucleophilic hardeners such as amines are hardly suitable for crosslinking. Cycloaliphatic epoxides are therefore usually homopolymerized thermally or UV-initiated in an electrophilic or cationic reaction. Due to the low dielectric constants and the absence of chlorine, cycloaliphatic epoxides are often used to encapsulate electronic systems, such as microchips or LEDs. They are also used for radiation-cured paints and varnishes. Due to their high price, however, their use has so far been limited to such applications.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nEpoxidized vegetable oils are formed by epoxidation of [[unsaturated fatty acids]] by reaction with peracids. In this case, the peracids can also be formed in situ by reacting carboxylic acids with hydrogen peroxide. Compared with LERs (liquid epoxy resins) they have very low viscosities. If, however, they are used in larger proportions as [[reactive diluent]]s, this often leads to reduced chemical and thermal resistance and to poorer mechanical properties of the cured epoxides. Large scale epoxidized vegetable oils such as epoxidized soy and lens oils are used to a large extent as secondary plasticizers and cost stabilizers for [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]].<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nAliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins of low molar mass (mono-, bi- or polyfunctional) are formed by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with aliphatic alcohols or polyols (glycidyl ethers are formed) or with aliphatic carboxylic acids (glycidyl esters are formed). The reaction is carried out in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide, analogous to the formation of bisphenol A-diglycidyl ether. Also aliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins usually have a low viscosity compared to aromatic epoxy resins. They are therefore added to other epoxy resins as [[reactive diluent]]s or as [[adhesion promoter]]s. Epoxy resins made of (long-chain) polyols are also added to improve tensile strength and impact strength.\n\nA related class is cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, which contains one or more cycloaliphatic rings in the molecule (e.g. 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate). This class also displays lower viscosity at room temperature, but offers significantly higher temperature resistance than the aliphatic epoxy diluents. However, reactivity is rather low compared to other classes of epoxy resin, and high temperature curing using suitable accelerators is normally required. As aromaticity is not present in these materials as it is in Bisphenol A and F resins, the UV stability is considerably improved.\n\n=== Halogenated ===\nHalogenated epoxy resins are admixed for special properties, in particular brominated and fluorinated epoxy resins are used.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nBrominated bisphenol A is used when flame retardant properties are required, such as in some electrical applications (e.g. [[printed circuit board]]s). The tetrabrominated bisphenol A (TBBPA, 2,2-bis(3,5-dibromophenyl)propane) or its diglycidyl ether, 2,2-bis[3,5-dibromo-4-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)phenyl]propane, can be added to the epoxy [[formulation]]. The formulation may then be reacted in the same way as pure bisphenol A. Some (non-crosslinked) epoxy resins with very high molar mass are added to engineering thermoplastics, again to achieve flame retardant properties.\n\nFluorinated epoxy resins have been investigated for some [[High-performance plastics|high performance applications]], such as the fluorinated diglycidether 5-heptafluoropropyl-1,3-bis[2-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)hexafluoro-2-propyl]benzene. As it has a low surface tension, it is added as a wetting agent (surfactant) for contact with glass fibres. Its reactivity to hardeners is comparable to that of bisphenol A. When cured, the epoxy resin leads to a thermosetting plastic with high chemical resistance and low water absorption. However, the commercial use of fluorinated epoxy resins is limited by their high cost and low T<sub>g</sub>.\n\n===Diluents===\nEpoxy resins diluents are typically formed by glycidylation of aliphatic alcohols or polyols. The resulting materials may be monofunctional (e.g. dodecanol glycidyl ether), difunctional (butanediol diglycidyl ether), or higher functionality (e.g. trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether). These resins typically display low viscosity at room temperature (10-200 mPa.s) and are often referred to as [[reactive diluent]]s. They are rarely used alone, but are rather employed to modify (reduce) the viscosity of other epoxy resins. This has led to the term \u2018modified epoxy resin\u2019 to denote those containing viscosity-lowering reactive diluents.\n\n===Glycidylamine ===\nGlycidylamine epoxy resins are higher functionality epoxies which are formed when aromatic amines are reacted with epichlorohydrin. Important industrial grades are triglycidyl-''p''-aminophenol (functionality 3) and ''N'',''N'',''N''\u2032,''N''\u2032-tetraglycidyl-bis-(4-aminophenyl)-methane (functionality 4). The resins are low to medium viscosity at room temperature, which makes them easier to process than EPN or ECN resins. This coupled with high reactivity, plus high temperature resistance and mechanical properties of the resulting cured network makes them important materials for aerospace composite applications.\n\n==Curing==\n[[File:VernetzteEpoxidharze.svg|thumb|320px|right|Structure of a cured epoxy glue. The triamine hardener is shown in red, the resin in black. The resin's epoxide groups have reacted with the hardener and are not present anymore. The material is highly [[crosslink]]ed and contains many OH groups, which confer adhesive properties.]]\nIn general, uncured epoxy resins have only poor mechanical, chemical and heat resistance properties. However, good properties are obtained by reacting the linear epoxy resin with suitable curatives to form three-dimensional cross-linked thermoset structures. This process is commonly referred to as curing or gelation process.<ref name=\"onepetro.org\">Hakiki, Farizal et al. (2015).

SPE/IATMI Asia Pacific Oil & Gas Conference and Exhibition, 20\u201322 October, Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia. doi: [https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-176457-MS 10.2118/176457-MS]</ref> Curing of epoxy resins is an [[exothermic reaction]] and in some cases produces sufficient heat to cause thermal degradation if not controlled.\n\nCuring may be achieved by reacting an epoxy with itself (homopolymerisation) or by forming a [[copolymer]] with polyfunctional curatives or '''hardeners'''. In principle, any molecule containing a reactive hydrogen may react with the epoxide groups of the epoxy resin. Common classes of hardeners for epoxy resins include amines, acids, acid anhydrides, phenols, alcohols and thiols. Relative reactivity (lowest first) is approximately in the order: phenol < anhydride < aromatic amine < cycloaliphatic amine < aliphatic amine < thiol.\n\nWhile some epoxy resin/ hardener combinations will cure at ambient temperature, many require heat, with temperatures up to {{cvt|150|C}} being common, and up to {{cvt|200|C}} for some specialist systems. Insufficient heat during cure will result in a network with incomplete polymerisation, and thus reduced mechanical, chemical and heat resistance. Cure temperature should typically attain the [[glass transition]] temperature (Tg) of the fully cured network in order to achieve maximum properties. Temperature is sometimes increased in a step-wise fashion to control the rate of curing and prevent excessive heat build-up from the exothermic reaction.\n\nHardeners which show only low or limited reactivity at ambient temperature, but which react with epoxy resins at elevated temperature are referred to as '''latent hardeners'''. When using latent hardeners, the epoxy resin and hardener may be mixed and stored for some time prior to use, which is advantageous for many industrial processes. Very latent hardeners enable one-component (1K) products to be produced, whereby the resin and hardener are supplied pre-mixed to the end user and only require heat to initiate curing. One-component products generally have shorter shelf-lives than standard 2-component systems, and products may require cooled storage and transport.\n\nThe epoxy curing reaction may be accelerated by addition of small quantities of [[accelerant|accelerators]]. Tertiary amines, carboxylic acids and alcohols (especially phenols) are effective accelerators. Bisphenol A is a highly effective and widely used accelerator, but is now increasingly replaced due to health concerns with this substance.\n\n===Homopolymerisation===\nEpoxy resin may be reacted with itself in the presence of an anionic catalyst (a Lewis base such as tertiary amines or imidazoles) or a cationic catalyst (a Lewis acid such as a boron trifluoride complex) to form a cured network. This process is known as catalytic homopolymerisation. The resulting network contains only ether bridges, and exhibits high thermal and chemical resistance, but is brittle and often requires elevated temperature for the curing process, so finds only niche applications industrially.\nEpoxy homopolymerisation is often used when there is a requirement for UV curing, since cationic UV catalysts may be employed (e.g. for [[UV coating]]s).\n\n===Amines===\nPolyfunctional primary amines form an important class of epoxy hardeners. Primary amines undergo an [[addition reaction]] with the epoxide group to form a hydroxyl group and a secondary amine. The secondary amine can further react with an epoxide to form a tertiary amine and an additional hydroxyl group. Kinetic studies have shown the reactivity of the primary amine to be approximately double that of the secondary amine. Use of a difunctional or polyfunctional amine forms a three-dimensional cross-linked network.\nAliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic amines are all employed as epoxy hardeners. Amine type hardeners will alter both the processing properties (viscosity, reactivity) and the final properties (mechanical, temperature and heat resistance) of the cured copolymer network. Thus amine structure is normally selected according to the application. Overall reactivity potential for different hardeners can roughly be ordered; aliphatic amines > cycloaliphatic amines > aromatic amines, though aliphatic amines with steric hindrance near the amino groups may react as slowly as some of the aromatic amines. Slower reactivity allows longer working times for processors. Temperature resistance generally increases in the same order, since aromatic amines form much more rigid structures than aliphatic amines. Aromatic amines were widely used as epoxy resin hardeners, due to the excellent end properties when mixed with a parent resin. Over the past few decades concern about the possible adverse health effects of many aromatic amines has led to increased use of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amine alternatives. Amines are also blended, adducted and reacted to alter properties and these amine resins are more often used to cure epoxy resins than a pure amine such as TETA. increasingly, WATER BASED polyamines are also used to help reduce the toxicity profile among other reasons. \n[[File:N1,N1'-(ethane-1,2-diyl)bis(ethane-1,2-diamine) 200.svg|thumb|150px|Structure of [[Triethylenetetramine|TETA]], a typical hardener. The amine (NH2) groups react with the epoxide groups of the resin during polymerisation.]]\n\n===Anhydrides===\nEpoxy resins may be cured with cyclic anhydrides at elevated temperatures. Reaction occurs only after opening of the anhydride ring, e.g. by secondary hydroxyl groups in the epoxy resin. A possible side reaction may also occur between the epoxide and hydroxyl groups, but this may suppressed by addition of tertiary amines.\nThe low viscosity and high latency of anhydride hardeners makes them suitable for processing systems which require addition of mineral fillers prior to curing, e.g. for high voltage electrical insulators.\n\n===Phenols===\nPolyphenols, such as bisphenol A or novolacs can react with epoxy resins at elevated temperatures ({{cvt|130|-|180|C|disp=comma}}), normally in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting material has ether linkages and displays higher chemical and oxidation resistance than typically obtained by curing with amines or anhydrides. Since many novolacs are solids, this class of hardeners is often employed for [[powder coating]]s.\n\n===Thiols===\nAlso known as mercaptans, thiols contain a sulfur which reacts very readily with the epoxide group, even at ambient or sub-ambient temperatures. While the resulting network does not typically display high temperature or chemical resistance, the high reactivity of the thiol group makes it useful for applications where heated curing is not possible, or very fast cure is required e.g. for domestic DIY adhesives and chemical [[rock bolt]] [[Anchor bolt|anchors]]. Thiols have a characteristic odour, which can be detected in many two-component household adhesives.\n\n==History==\nCondensation of epoxides and amines was first reported and patented by Paul Schlack of Germany in 1934.<ref>P.

Castan's work was licensed by [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals|Ciba]], Ltd. of Switzerland, which went on to become one of the three major epoxy resin producers worldwide. Ciba's epoxy business was spun off as Vantico in the late 1990s, which was subsequently sold in 2003 and became the Advanced Materials [[strategic business unit|business unit]] of [[Huntsman Corporation]] of the United States. In 1946, Sylvan Greenlee, working for the Devoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds Company, patented resin derived from bisphenol-A and epichlorohydrin.<ref>{{cite patent |country= US |inventor= Sylvan Owen Greenlee |assignee= DeVoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds |number= 2456408 |gdate= 1948-12-14 |title= Synthetic drying compositions }}</ref> Devoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds, which was active in the early days of the epoxy resin industry, was sold to [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Chemical]]; the division involved in this work was eventually sold, and via a series of other corporate transactions is now part of [[Hexion Inc.]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://epoxyflooringtech.com/history-of-epoxy-resin/|title=History of Epoxy Resin|website=epoxyflooringtech.com}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nThe applications for epoxy-based materials are extensive and include coatings, [[adhesive]]s and [[composite material]]s such as those using [[carbon fiber]] and [[fiberglass]] reinforcements (although [[polyester]], [[vinyl ester resin|vinyl ester]], and other [[thermosetting polymer|thermosetting]] [[resin]]s are also used for glass-reinforced plastic). The chemistry of epoxies and the range of commercially available variations allows cure polymers to be produced with a very broad range of properties. In general, epoxies are known for their excellent adhesion, chemical and heat resistance, good-to-excellent mechanical properties and very good [[Insulator (electrical)|electrical insulating]] properties. Many properties of epoxies can be modified (for example [[silver]]-filled epoxies with good [[electrical conductivity]] are available, although epoxies are typically electrically insulating). Variations offering high thermal insulation, or thermal conductivity combined with high electrical resistance for electronics applications, are available.<ref>{{cite book|last=May |first=Clayton A. |title=Epoxy Resins: Chemistry and Technology|publisher=Marcel Dekker Inc|location=New York|date=1987-12-23|edition=Second|page=794|isbn=0-8247-7690-9}}</ref>\n\nAs with other classes of thermoset polymer materials, blending different grades of epoxy resin, as well as use of additives, plasticizers or fillers is common to achieve the desired processing or final properties, or to reduce cost. Use of blending, additives and fillers is often referred to as '''formulating''' (see: [[formulation]].\n\n=== Paints and coatings ===\nTwo part epoxy coatings were developed for heavy duty service on metal substrates and use less energy than heat-cured [[powder coating]]s. These systems provide a tough, protective coating with excellent hardness. One part epoxy coatings are formulated as an emulsion in water, and can be cleaned up without solvents.\n\nEpoxy coatings are often used in industrial and automotive applications since they are more heat resistant than latex-based and alkyd-based paints. Epoxy paints tend to deteriorate, known as \"chalking out\", due to UV exposure.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bayliss |first= D.A. |title= Steelwork corrosion control |year= 2002 |publisher= Spon |location= London |isbn= 978-0-415-26101-2 |pages= 13.6.6 Chalking |edition= 2nd |author2=Deacon, D.H.}}</ref>\n\n[[Polyester]] epoxies are used as [[powder coating]]s for washers, driers and other \"white goods\". [[Fusion bonded epoxy coating|Fusion Bonded Epoxy Powder Coatings]] (FBE) are extensively used for corrosion protection of steel pipes and fittings used in the oil and gas industry, potable water transmission pipelines (steel), and concrete reinforcing [[rebar]]. Epoxy coatings are also widely used as [[Primer (paint)|primers]] to improve the adhesion of automotive and marine paints especially on metal surfaces where [[corrosion]] (rusting) resistance is important. Metal cans and containers are often coated with epoxy to prevent rusting, especially for foods like tomatoes that are [[acid]]ic.\n\nEpoxy resins have several flooring applcations. They are used for protection again mechanical wear, chemical attack and thermal stressing in places such as industrial facilities, car parks or retail establishments. They can also have decorative applications, such as [[terrazzo]] flooring, chip flooring, and colored aggregate flooring.\n\nEpoxies were modified in a variety of ways, Reacted with fatty acids derived from oils to yield epoxy esters, which were cured the same way as alkyds . Typical ones were L8(80% linseed, D4 (40% Dehydrated castor oil). These were often reacted with styrene to make styrenated epoxy esters, used as primers. Curing with phenolics to make drum linings, curing esters with amine resins and pre-curing epoxies with amino resins to make resistant top coats. \nOne of the best examples was a system of using solvent free epoxies for priming ships during construction, this used a system of hot airless spray with premixing at the head. This obviated the problem of solvent retention under the film, which caused adhesion problems later on.\n\n=== Adhesives ===<!-- [[Epoxy adhesive]] redirects here -->\n[[File:Titan epoxy.jpg|thumb|right|Special epoxy is strong enough to withstand the forces between a [[surfboard]] fin and the fin mount. This epoxy is waterproof and capable of [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]] underwater. The blue-coloured epoxy on the left is still undergoing curing.]]\n\nEpoxy [[adhesive]]s are a major part of the class of adhesives called \"structural adhesives\" or \"engineering adhesives\" (that includes [[polyurethane]], [[Acryloyl group|acrylic]], [[cyanoacrylate]], and other chemistries.) These high-performance adhesives are used in the construction of aircraft, automobiles, bicycles, boats, golf clubs, skis, snowboards, and other applications where high strength bonds are required. Epoxy adhesives can be developed to suit almost any application. They can be used as adhesives for wood, metal, glass, stone, and some plastics. They can be made flexible or rigid, [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]]/colored, fast setting or slow setting. Epoxy adhesives are better in heat and chemical resistance than other common adhesives. In general, epoxy adhesives cured with heat will be more heat- and chemical-resistant than those cured at room temperature. The strength of epoxy adhesives is degraded at temperatures above {{convert|350|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}.<ref name='jjmorena'>{{cite book|last=Morena |first=John J |title=Advanced Composite Mold Making|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Co.

Such epoxies are commonly used in [[optics]], [[optical fiber|fiber optics]], and [[optoelectronics]].\n\nRecent  developments are coatings for onshore, marine and offshore protection, as well as shipping containers. Traditionally solvent-borne, solvent-free or high-solids, state of the art products are waterborne epoxy systems to protect customers' metal assets from corrosion. This includes waterborne epoxy resin system for making zinc-rich primers.\n\n=== Industrial tooling and composites ===\nEpoxy systems are used in industrial tooling applications to produce [[Molding (process)|molds]], master models, [[laminate]]s, [[casting]]s, [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], and other industrial production aids. This \"plastic tooling\" replaces metal, wood and other traditional materials, and generally improves the efficiency and either lowers the overall cost or shortens the lead-time for many industrial processes. Epoxies are also used in producing fiber-reinforced or composite parts. They are more expensive than polyester resins and [[vinyl ester resin]]s, but usually produce stronger and more temperature-resistant [[thermoset polymer matrix]] composite parts.\n\n=== Wind turbine composites ===\nEpoxy resins are used as bonding matrix along with glass or carbon fiber fabrics to produce composites with very high strength to weight characteristics, allowing longer and more efficient rotor blades to be produced. In addition, for offshore and onshore wind energy installations, epoxy resins are used as protective coatings on steel towers, base struts and concrete foundations. Aliphatic polyurethane top coats are applied on top to ensure full UV protection, prolong operational lifetimes and lowering maintenance costs. Electric generators, connected via the drivetrain with the rotor blades, convert mechanical wind energy in usable electric energy, and rely on epoxies electrical insulation and high thermal resistance properties. The same applies to transformers, bushings, spacers, and composites cables connecting the windmills to the grid In Europe, wind energy components account for the largest segment of epoxy applications, about 27% of the market.<ref name=socio2013>[https://epoxy-europe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Epoxy_Socioeconomic_Study_Main_Findings_August-2017.pdf Epoxy Resins Committee > Socioeconomic Analysis] 2013</ref>\n\n===Leisure and marine===\nHigh strength and weight reduction are the main performance criteria for manufacturers of sport components. Skis, snowboards, surf and kite boards are fiber reinforced epoxy applications. Epoxy resin systems in combination with multi-axial, unidirectional, woven fabrics and variety of core materials play also a key role to manufacture high performance boats, yachts and commercial and military vessels. \n[https://www.thoughtco.com/composite-materials-in-boats-820410/ composite boats]\n\nEpoxies are sold in hardware stores, typically as a pack containing separate resin and hardener, which must be mixed immediately before use. They are also sold in boat shops as repair resins for marine applications. Epoxies typically are not used in the outer layer of a boat because they deteriorate by exposure to [[UV]] light. They are often used during boat repair and assembly, and then over-coated with conventional or two-part polyurethane paint or marine-varnishes that provide UV protection.\n\nThere are two main areas of marine use. Because of the better mechanical properties relative to the more common [[polyester resins]], epoxies are used for commercial manufacture of components where a high strength/weight ratio is required. The second area is that their strength, gap filling properties and excellent adhesion to many materials including timber have created a boom in amateur building projects including aircraft and boats.\n\nNormal [[gelcoat]] formulated for use with [[polyester]] resins and vinylester resins does not adhere to epoxy surfaces, though epoxy adheres very well if applied to polyester resin surfaces. \"Flocoat\" that is normally used to coat the interior of polyester fibreglass yachts is also compatible with epoxies.\n\nEpoxy materials tend to harden somewhat more gradually, while polyester materials tend to harden quickly, particularly if a lot of catalyst is used.<ref>Hakiki, F., Nuraeni, N., Salam, D.D., Aditya, W., Akbari, A., Mazrad, Z.A.I. and Siregar, S. [http://archives.datapages.com/data/ipa_pdf/2015/ipa15-se-025.htm Preliminary Study on Epoxy-Based Polymer for Water Shut-Off Application]. Paper IPA15-SE-025. Proceeding of The 39th IPA Conference and Exhibition, Jakarta, Indonesia, May 2015.</ref> The chemical reactions in both cases are exothermic. Large quantities of mix will generate their own heat and greatly speed the reaction, so it is usual to mix small amounts which can be used quickly.\n\nWhile it is common to associate polyester resins and epoxy resins, their properties are sufficiently different that they are properly treated as distinct materials. Polyester resins are typically low strength unless used with a reinforcing material like glass fibre, are relatively brittle unless reinforced, and have low adhesion. Epoxies, by contrast, are inherently strong, somewhat flexible and have excellent adhesion. However, polyester resins are much cheaper.\n\nEpoxy resins typically require a precise mix of two components which form a third chemical. Depending on the properties required, the ratio may be anything from 1:1 or over 10:1, but in every case they must be mixed exactly. The final product is then a precise thermo-setting plastic. Until they are mixed the two elements are relatively inert, although the 'hardeners' tend to be more chemically active and should be protected from the atmosphere and moisture. The rate of the reaction can be changed by using different hardeners, which may change the nature of the final product, or by controlling the temperature.\n\nBy contrast, polyester resins are usually made available in a 'promoted' form, such that the progress of previously-mixed resins from liquid to solid is already underway, albeit very slowly. The only variable available to the user is to change the rate of this process using a catalyst, often Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone-Peroxide ([[MEKP]]), which is very toxic. The presence of the catalyst in the final product actually detracts from the desirable properties, so that small amounts of catalyst are preferable, so long as the hardening proceeds at an acceptable pace. The rate of cure of polyesters can therefore be controlled by the amount and type of catalyst as well as by the temperature.\n\nAs adhesives, epoxies bond in three ways: a) Mechanically, because the bonding surfaces are roughened; b) by proximity, because the cured resins are physically so close to the bonding surfaces that they are hard to separate; c) ionically, because the epoxy resins form ionic bonds at an atomic level with the bonding surfaces. This last is substantially the strongest of the three. By contrast, polyester resins can only bond using the first two of these, which greatly reduces their utility as adhesives and in marine repair.\n\n=== Aerospace ===\nIn the aerospace industry, epoxy is used as a structural matrix material which is then reinforced by fiber. Typical fiber reinforcements include [[glass]], [[carbon]], [[Kevlar]], and [[boron]].\nEpoxies are also used as a structural [[glue]]. Materials like [[wood]], and others that are 'low-tech' are glued with epoxy resin. Epoxies generally out-perform most other resin types in terms of mechanical properties and resistance to environmental degradation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://netcomposites.com/guide/resin-systems/epoxy-resins/ |title=Epoxy Resins |website=netcomposites.com |language=en |access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\nGlider and small aircraft designers considered epoxy based composites in an early date.

New generation, in particular of electrically driven cars, require chassis and other significant load bearing structures made from CFRP. But, mass-production requires adequate automotive manufacturing. Traditionally, the poly-addition reaction of epoxy with curatives is more time consuming than metal forming or unsaturated polyester cure. But fast processing and higher thermo-mechanical resistance is required. In numbers, coming from low double digit minutes for cure to single digits and increasing the thermo-mechanical resistance from 130\u00b0C to 180\u00b0C and higher.

Such epoxy resin formulations are relevant to the electrical and electronics industry in voltage ranges from 400 kV down to  >1V.The purpose of the products is to insulate, protect or shield the environment from electric current or the devices from the environment. Formulated bisphenol-based epoxy resins, cured with dicarboxylic anhydrides or amines are used for indoor applications. Cycloaliphatic epoxy resins, preferably 1,2-Cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, bis(2,3-epoxypropyl) ester, in combination with cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic anhydrides and silanised silica flour are the base for outdoor-resistant electrical insulation, e.g. production of insulators, bushings, instrument transformers.\nMost common processing technologies are Vacuum Pressure Impregnation for power generators, Vacuum Casting and Automatic Pressure Gelation  for medium voltage equipment and potting under vacuum for e.g. ignition coils and small transformers or potting under ambient pressure for e.g. capacitors.\n\nEpoxy resins are applied using the technology of [[resin dispensing]].\n\n===Electronics===\n[[File:Hybridcircuit.jpg|thumb|An epoxy [[conformal coating|encapsulated]] [[hybrid circuit]] on a [[printed circuit board]].]]\nIn the electronics industry epoxy resins are the primary resin used in overmolding [[integrated circuit]]s, [[transistor]]s and [[hybrid circuit]]s and making [[printed circuit boards]].

Since these applications require self-extinguishing properties, flame retardant epoxy resins or epoxy formulations with flame retardant additives are utilized.\n\n=== Petroleum and petrochemical ===\nEpoxies can be used to plug selective layers in a reservoir which are producing excessive brine.

The epoxy resin market is dominated by the Asia-Pacific region. China is the major producer and consumer globally, contributing to almost 50% of the global resin global capacity in 2018. The global market is made up of approximately 50\u2013100 manufacturers of basic or commodity epoxy resins and hardeners. In Europe, the largest markets for epoxy resins are Germany, Italy, France and the UK.\n\nThese commodity epoxy [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]] mentioned above typically do not sell epoxy resins in a form usable to smaller end users, so there is another group of companies that purchase epoxy raw materials from the major producers and then compounds (blends, modifies, or otherwise customizes) epoxy systems from these [[raw material]]s. These companies are known as \"formulators\". The majority of the epoxy systems sold are produced by these formulators and they comprise over 60% of the dollar value of the epoxy market. There are hundreds of ways that these formulators can modify epoxies\u2014by adding [[mineral]] fillers ([[talc]], [[silica]], [[alumina]], etc.), by adding flexibilizers, [[viscosity]] reducers, [[colorant]]s, thickeners, accelerators, [[adhesion]] promoters, etc. These modifications are made to reduce costs, to improve performance, and to improve processing convenience. As a result, a typical formulator sells dozens or even thousands of formulations\u2014each tailored to the requirements of a particular application or market.\n\nThe raw materials for epoxy resin production are today largely [[petroleum]] derived, although some plant derived sources are now becoming commercially available (e.g. plant derived glycerol used to make [[epichlorohydrin]]).\n\n== Health risks ==\n\nThe primary risk associated with epoxy use is often related to the hardener component and not to the epoxy resin itself. Amine hardeners in particular are generally [[corrosive]], but may also be classed as [[toxic]] or [[carcinogenic/mutagenic]]. Aromatic amines present a particular health hazard (most are known or suspected carcinogens), but their use is now restricted to specific industrial applications, and safer aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amines are commonly employed.\nAnother group of hardeners which have come into the regulatory focus over recent years are dicarboxylic anhydrides, namely Hexahydropthalic-Anhydride (HHPA) and Methyl-Hexahydrophthalic-Anhydride (m-HHPA). Both substances have been identified under REACH as substances of equivalent concern due to the potential risk of respiratory sensitization. This SVHC identification implies that both substances are listed on the REACH candidate list for further regulatory measures.\nLiquid epoxy resins in their uncured state are mostly classed as [[irritant]] to the eyes and skin, as well as toxic to aquatic organisms. Solid epoxy resins are generally safer than liquid epoxy resins, and many are classified non-hazardous materials. One particular risk associated with epoxy resins is sensitization. The risk has been shown to be more pronounced in epoxy resins containing low molecular weight epoxy diluents.[21] Exposure to epoxy resins can, over time, induce an [[allergic reaction]]. Sensitization generally occurs due to repeated exposure (e.g. through poor working hygiene or lack of protective equipment) over a long period of time. Allergic reaction sometimes occurs at a time which is delayed several days from the exposure. Allergic reaction is often visible in the form of [[dermatitis]], particularly in areas where the exposure has been highest (commonly hands and forearms). There is some incidence that use of epoxy resin systems may cause sensitizer-induced occupational asthma in some exposed workers. However, this may apply to specific application technologies, e.g. spray application, insufficient use of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and the use of volatile components, e.g. amine-based curing agents. Most epoxy resins have due to their high(er) molecular weight a low vapor pressure, thus do not vaporize easily.  \n[[Bisphenol-A]], which is a major building block to manufacture Bis-A- epoxy resins, has been identified as an endocrine disruptor for human health and the environment under REACH. The concept of endocrine disruption is not without controversy within the scientific community. Substances which are typically quoted in the context of endocrine disruption are xeno- and phytoestrogens, i.e. substances which mimic the effects of the human female sex hormone estrogen. The strength of a physiological response to natural estrogen or xenoestrogen is dependent on the affinity to bind to estrogen receptors on the cell surface of target organs or tissues. Human estrogen has a high binding affinity to estrogen receptors and thus elicits a physiological response at very low concentrations at nanomolar or sub-nanomolar level.\nXeno- or phytoestrogens however, have a much lower binding affinity to the estrogen receptors and as such require a much higher concentration to elicit a similar physiological response as natural estrogen. The uptake of such concentrations via food ingestion does not seem plausible for most xenoestrogens such as BPA, as it would require ingesting vast quantities of canned food stuffs or beverages to induce an appreciable effect. Consequently, the risk of adverse effects for BPA exposure via a normal diet is considered to be relatively insignificant.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Thermosetting polymer]]\n* [[Thermoset polymer matrix]]\n* [[Plastic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220105252/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm Epoxy Resin health hazards] (California Department of Health Services) 21 April 2008 @ [[Wayback Machine]] [https://epoxi.es/2HfHeiX https://web.archive.org/web/20080421095718/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm]\n* [http://pslc.ws/macrog/epoxy.htm The chemistry of epoxide], simple to understand\n\n<!-- LocalWords: catalyzing epoxies -->\n\n[[Category:Organic polymers]]\n[[Category:Adhesives]]\n[[Category:Synthetic resins]]\n[[Category:Thermosetting plastics]]\n\n[[da:Kunstharpiks]]\n", "name_user": "HGChemEng", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWind turbine composites:Foto was added", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxy"}

Bound on the east and south by its [[natural border]]s, the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian mountain range]], historical Transylvania extended westward to the [[Apuseni Mountains]]. The term sometimes encompasses not only Transylvania proper, but also parts of the historical regions of [[Cri\u0219ana]] and [[Maramure\u0219]], and occasionally the Romanian part of [[Banat]].\n\nThe region of Transylvania is known for the scenery of its [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] landscape and its rich history. It also contains major cities such as [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Bra\u0219ov]], [[Sibiu]], [[T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]], [[Alba Iulia]], and [[Bistri\u021ba]].\n\nThe [[Western world]] commonly associates Transylvania with [[vampire]]s, thanks to the dominant influence of [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel ''[[Dracula]]'' and the many films the tale inspired.<ref name=\"query.nytimes.com\">{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DE143BF931A1575BC0A965958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Travel Advisory; Lure of Dracula In Transylvania | date=1993-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icromania.com/infoTransylvania.asp |title=Romania Transylvania |publisher=Icromania.com |date=2007-04-15 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Main|Historical names of Transylvania}}\nThe earliest known reference to Transylvania appears in a [[Medieval Latin]] document of the Kingdom of Hungary in 1075 as {{lang|la|ultra silvam}}, meaning \"beyond the forest\" ({{lang|la|ultra}} meaning \"beyond\" or \"on the far side of\" and the [[accusative case]] of {{lang|la|sylva}} ({{lang|la|sylvam}}) \"woods, forest\").

The [[Principality of Transylvania (1711\u20131867)|Grand Principality of Transylvania]] was reintroduced 54 years later in 1765.\n\nThe [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian revolution]] against the Habsburgs started in 1848. The revolution in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] grew into a war for the total independence from the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg dynasty]]. [[Julius Jacob von Haynau]], the leader of the Austrian army was appointed plenipotentiary to restore order in Hungary after the conflict. He ordered the execution of [[The 13 Martyrs of Arad|The 13 Hungarian Martyrs]] of [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] and Prime Minister [[Lajos Batthy\u00e1ny|Batthy\u00e1ny]] was executed the same day in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]]. After a series of serious Austrian defeats in 1849, the [[Austrian Empire|empire]] came close to the brink of collapse. Thus, the new young emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] had to call for Russian help in the name of the Holy Alliance. Czar Nicholas I answered, and sent a 200,000 men strong army with 80,000 auxiliary forces. Finally, the joint army of Russian and Austrian forces defeated the Hungarian forces. After the restoration of Habsburg power, Hungary was placed under martial law. Following the Hungarian Army's surrender at Vil\u00e1gos (now [[\u0218iria]], Romania) in 1849, their revolutionary banners were taken to Russia by the Tsarist troops, and were kept there both under the Tsarist and Communist systems (in 1940 the Soviet Union offered the banners to the Horthy government).\n\nAfter the [[Ausgleich]] of 1867, the Principality of Transylvania was once again abolished.

Elected representatives of the [[Romanians|ethnic Romanians]] from Transylvania, Banat, Cri\u015fana and Maramure\u015f backed by the [[Hungarian\u2013Romanian War|mobilization of Romanian troops]], proclaimed [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Union with Romania]] on 1 December 1918.

These other provinces had all joined with the Kingdom of Romania a few months earlier. In 1920, the [[Treaty of Trianon]] established new borders, much of the proclaimed territories became part of Romania.

Other faiths also are present, including [[Jews]] and [[Muslims]]. Under the [[Habsburgs]], Transylvania served as a place for \"religious undesirables\". People who arrived in Transylvania included those that did not conform to the [[Catholic Church]] and were sent here forcibly, as well as many religious refugees. Transylvania has a long history of religious tolerance. This has been ensured by its religious pluralism. [[Christianity]] is the largest religion in Transylvania. Transylvania has also been (and still is) a center for Christian denominations other than [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], the form of Christianity that most Romanians follow.

Bound on the east and south by its [[natural border]]s, the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian mountain range]], historical Transylvania extended westward to the [[Apuseni Mountains]]. The term sometimes encompasses not only Transylvania proper, but also parts of the historical regions of [[Cri\u0219ana]] and [[Maramure\u0219]], and occasionally the Romanian part of [[Banat]].\n\nThe region of Transylvania is known for the scenery of its [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] landscape and its rich history. It also contains major cities such as [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Bra\u0219ov]], [[Sibiu]], [[T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]], [[Alba Iulia]], and [[Bistri\u021ba]].\n\nThe [[Western world]] commonly associates Transylvania with [[vampire]]s, thanks to the dominant influence of [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel ''[[Dracula]]'' and the many films the tale inspired.<ref name=\"query.nytimes.com\">{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DE143BF931A1575BC0A965958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Travel Advisory; Lure of Dracula In Transylvania | date=1993-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icromania.com/infoTransylvania.asp |title=Romania Transylvania |publisher=Icromania.com |date=2007-04-15 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Main|Historical names of Transylvania}}\nThe earliest known reference to Transylvania appears in a [[Medieval Latin]] document of the Kingdom of Hungary in 1075 as {{lang|la|ultra silvam}}, meaning \"beyond the forest\" ({{lang|la|ultra}} meaning \"beyond\" or \"on the far side of\" and the [[accusative case]] of {{lang|la|sylva}} ({{lang|la|sylvam}}) \"woods, forest\").

The revolution in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] grew into a war for the total independence from the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg dynasty]]. [[Julius Jacob von Haynau]], the leader of the Austrian army was appointed plenipotentiary to restore order in Hungary after the conflict. He ordered the execution of [[The 13 Martyrs of Arad|The 13 Hungarian Martyrs]] of [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] and Prime Minister [[Lajos Batthy\u00e1ny|Batthy\u00e1ny]] was executed the same day in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]]. After a series of serious Austrian defeats in 1849, the [[Austrian Empire|empire]] came close to the brink of collapse. Thus, the new young emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] had to call for Russian help in the name of the Holy Alliance. Czar Nicholas I answered, and sent a 200,000 men strong army with 80,000 auxiliary forces. Finally, the joint army of Russian and Austrian forces defeated the Hungarian forces. After the restoration of Habsburg power, Hungary was placed under martial law. Following the Hungarian Army's surrender at Vil\u00e1gos (now [[\u0218iria]], Romania) in 1849, their revolutionary banners were taken to Russia by the Tsarist troops, and were kept there both under the Tsarist and Communist systems (in 1940 the Soviet Union offered the banners to the Horthy government).\n\nAfter the [[Ausgleich]] of 1867, the Principality of Transylvania was once again abolished.

Stock raising, [[agriculture]], [[wine]] production and fruit growing are important occupations. Agriculture is widespread in the [[Transylvanian Plateau]], including growing cereals, vegetables, viticulture and breeding cattle, sheep, swine, and poultry.

Since the [[Protestant Reformation]], different Christian denominations have been coexisting in this religious melting pot, including [[Romanian Orthodox]], [[Romanian Greek Catholic Church|Romanian Greek Catholic]], other [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic]], [[Lutheran]], [[Reformed]], and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] branches. Other faiths also are present, including [[Jews]] and [[Muslims]]. Under the [[Habsburgs]], Transylvania served as a place for \"religious undesirables\". People who arrived in Transylvania included those that did not conform to the [[Catholic Church]] and were sent here forcibly, as well as many religious refugees. Transylvania has a long history of religious tolerance. This has been ensured by its religious pluralism. [[Christianity]] is the largest religion in Transylvania. Transylvania has also been (and still is) a center for Christian denominations other than [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], the form of Christianity that most Romanians follow. As such, there are significant numbers of inhabitants of Transylvania that follow [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholicism]], [[Romanian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholicism]] and [[Religion in Romania#Protestantism|Protestantism]].<ref name=\"poperamet\">Earl A.

One of the predominant early symbols of Transylvania was the coat of arms of [[Sibiu]] city. In 1596 [[Levinus Hulsius]] created a coat of arms for the imperial province of Transylvania, consisting of a shield [[Division of the field|party per fess]], with a rising eagle in the upper field and seven hills with towers on top in the lower field. He published it in his work \"Chronologia\", issued in [[Nuremberg]] the same year. The seal from 1597 of [[Sigismund B\u00e1thory]], prince of Transylvania, reproduced the new coat of arms with some slight changes: in the upper field the eagle was flanked by a sun and a moon and in the lower field the hills were replaced by simple towers.<ref>Dan Cernovodeanu, ''\u0218tiin\u021ba \u0219i arta heraldic\u0103 \u00een Rom\u00e2nia'', Bucharest, 1977, p. 130</ref>\n\nThe seal of [[Michael the Brave]] from 1600 depicts the territory of the former [[Dacia|Dacian kingdom]]: [[Wallachia]], [[Moldavia]] and Transylvania:<ref name=\"Coat of arms of Dacia medieval\">{{cite web|title=Coat of arms of Dacia (medieval)|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/ro-dacia.html|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409102552/http://www.fotw.net/flags/ro-dacia.html |archivedate=9 April 2014}}</ref>\n* The black eagle ([[Wallachia]])\n* The [[aurochs]] head ([[Moldavia]])\n* The seven hills (Transylvania).\n* Over the hills there were two rampant lions affronts, supporting the trunk of a tree, as a symbol of the reunited [[Dacia|Dacian Kingdom]].<ref name=\"Coat of arms of Dacia medieval\"/>\n\nThe [[Transylvanian Diet|Diet]] of 1659 codified the representation of the privileged nations in Transylvania's [[coat of arms]].
