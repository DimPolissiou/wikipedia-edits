Whilst a vast majority of Islamic sects and scholars embody the belief that Astrology is fundamentally forbidden as per the authorities encapsulated in the Quran and Hadith, there remain some scholars which take the view that abstract forms of astrology have permeated in the worldly realm and that there thus exists a means by which the celestial beings have had some role in influencing historical events.\n\n__TOC__\n\n== Origins of Astrology in Islam ==\n[[File:Kit\u0101b-al-Daraj-page0013.jpg|thumb|Kitab al Daraj; An early Islamic work evidencing the prominence of Astrology in early Islam.]]\nThe earliest traces of Muslim individuals and therefore an Islamic stance against that of Astrology stems from individuals such as Abd al Jabbar.

They formalized their group in 1968, and played for [[WYMT-TV#History|WKYH-TV]]  before moving to [[Berea, Kentucky]].  In the years since, the group has played in 50 [[U.S. state]]s, at renowned venues across the US, and on nationwide television.  Initially sponsored by the [[United States Department of State]], the McLains performed in 63 total nations.  From 1978\u20131987, the band hosted an annual family-friendly [[list of bluegrass music festivals|bluegrass festival]] in [[Bighill, Kentucky]].\n\nThe McLain Family Band developed their sound by ear, with naught but their patriarch having [[classically trained|classical training]].  [[Music review]]ers and [[ambassadors of the United States]] alike spoke of the band's authenticity and heartfelt approach to music.  In 2013, the [[International Bluegrass Music Association]] awarded the McLain Family Band with their Distinguished Achievement Award.\n\nSome McLain songs are originals, some are bluegrass and [[country music]] [[standard (music)|standards]], and some were specifically commissioned [[classical music|classical]] pieces: the first bluegrass band to combine those genres.  The core of the band has always been the progeny of Raymond K. McLain, but the group has expanded and contracted over the years.

They formalized their group in 1968, and played for [[WYMT-TV#History|WKYH-TV]]  before moving to [[Berea, Kentucky]].  In the years since, the group has played in 50 [[U.S. state]]s, at renowned venues across the US, and on nationwide television.  Initially sponsored by the [[United States Department of State]], the McLains performed in 63 total nations.  From 1978\u20131987, the band hosted an annual family-friendly [[list of bluegrass music festivals|bluegrass festival]] in [[Bighill, Kentucky]].\n\nThe McLain Family Band developed their sound by ear, with naught but their patriarch having [[classically trained|classical training]].  [[Music review]]ers and [[ambassadors of the United States]] alike spoke of the band's authenticity and heartfelt approach to music.  In 2013, the [[International Bluegrass Music Association]] awarded the McLain Family Band with their Distinguished Achievement Award.\n\nSome McLain songs are originals, some are bluegrass and [[country music]] [[standard (music)|standards]], and some were specifically commissioned [[classical music|classical]] pieces: the first bluegrass band to combine those genres.  The core of the band has always been the progeny of Raymond K. McLain, but the group has expanded and contracted over the years.  Some members have worked on their own projects when the family band wasn't touring; at least a half-dozen albums attest to that.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nDr. Raymond Francis McLain ({{Birth based on age at death|76|1981|05|02}}{{spaced en dash}}May 2, 1981) was president of [[Eureka College]], [[Transylvania University]], and [[The American University in Cairo]] during his career in academia,<ref name=\"1981-05-04 Tuscaloosa News\" /> while his wife Beatrice \"Bicky\" Kane McLain (1906\u20132004)<ref name=\"AllMusic: McLain Family Band\" /> was the director of the Center for Southern Regional Folklife Studies at the [[University of Alabama]] from 1966\u20131976.<ref name=\"2004-04-16 Tuscaloosa News\" />  Raymond Francis and Bicky had two children: daughter Rosemary (a \"[[singer-songwriter|singer/songwriter]] and artistic pioneer in the [[rubber stamp]]ing industry\"),<ref name=\"1981-05-04 Tuscaloosa News\" /><ref name=\"2004-04-16 Tuscaloosa News\" /> and son Raymond Kane McLain (1928\u20132003).<ref name=\"AllMusic: McLain Family Band\" />\n\nRaymond Kane combined the passions of his parents; he majored in [[music theory]] at [[Denison University]] and did graduate work in [[folk music]] studies at [[Harvard University]] and the [[University of North Carolina]] before moving to [[Hindman, Kentucky]] in 1954 where he became the director of [[Hindman Settlement School]].  While at Hindman, Raymond Kane developed an interest in [[bluegrass music]]; he introduced his three eldest children\u2014Raymond Winslow, Alice, and Ruth\u2014to the genre, and the four of them began playing together.<ref name=\"Berea College: MFB Records Guide\" />\n\nRaymond Kane married Betty Winslow in 1952,<ref name=\"2017-09 MFB:50YOM ch0\" /> and founded the band at her encouragement in 1968.<ref name=\"AllMusic: McLain Family Band\" /><ref name=\"Symphony of the Mountains\" />  Performing under the name Bluegrass State,<ref name=\"2011 Crowe on the Banjo: CH6\" /> the [[quartet]] initially performed on a weekly [[WYMT-TV#History|WKYH-TV]] [[television show]] for two years.<ref name=\"2017-09 MFB:50YOM ch0\" />  On December 31, 1968, the family's Hindman home burned to the ground; all seven family members and their instruments survived,<ref name=\"2018-10-01 Kentucky Monthly\" /> and in 1970, the family moved to [[Berea, Kentucky]].<ref name=\"Berea College: MFB Records Guide\" />\n\n===Performing===\n<!-- domestically -->The band performed in all 50 [[U.S. state]]s, and particularly in [[Alaska]] during the winters where \"people really needed music.\"<ref name=\"2018-10-01 Kentucky Monthly\" />  Stateside, the band also stood before audiences at the [[Speed Art Museum]], [[Carnegie Hall]], the [[1982 World's Fair]],<ref name=\"Berea College: MFB Records Guide\" /> the [[Lincoln Center]]<ref name=\"Symphony of the Mountains\" />, the [[John F.

Please note figures are rentals not total gross.</ref>\n}}\n'''''At Long Last Love''''' is a 1975 American [[jukebox musical|jukebox]] [[musical film|musical]] [[comedy film]] written, produced, and directed by [[Peter Bogdanovich]]. It stars [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Cybill Shepherd]], [[Madeline Kahn]], and [[Duilio Del Prete]] as two couples who each switch partners during a party and attempt to make each other jealous. Featuring 18 songs with music and lyrics by [[Cole Porter]], Bogdanovich was inspired to make a musical with the composer's songs after Shepherd gave him a book of his songs. All of the musical sequences were performed live by the cast, since ''At Long Last Love'' was meant by Bogdanovich to be a tribute to 1930s musical films like ''[[One Hour With You]]'', ''[[The Love Parade]]'', ''[[The Merry Widow (1934 film)|The Merry Widow]]'' and ''[[The Smiling Lieutenant]]'' that also filmed the songs in the same manner.\n\n[[20th Century Fox]] rushed the film's release, only allowing for two test screenings before the final version premiered at [[Radio City Music Hall]]. Despite a few decent published opinions from [[film critic|critic]]s like [[Roger Ebert]], ''At Long Last Love'' faced mostly horrendous initial reviews that mainly targeted the lead actors' performances of the musical numbers; and very low box office returns, only making less than half of its $5.14 million budget. The critical reception was so negative that Bogdanovich printed newspaper ads apologizing for the film. Apart from a 1981 [[videocassette]] release, ''At Long Last Love'' didn't have an official home media release for many years, so the only available versions of the film were through bootleg TV, VHS recordings, and 16mm prints. This was until the early 2010s; Bogdanovich's 121-minute 1979 default version of the film was issued to [[Netflix]] in 2012, and the \"Definitive Director's Version,\" which was 90 seconds longer, was released on Blu-ray in 2013.\n==Plot==\nFour socialites unexpectedly clash: heiress Brooke Carter runs into the Italian gambler Johnny Spanish at the race track while playboy Michael O. Pritchard nearly runs into stage star Kitty O'Kelly with his car. Backstage at Kitty's show, it turns out she and Brooke are old friends who attended public school together. The foursome do the town, accompanied by Brooke's companion Elizabeth, who throws herself at Michael's butler and chauffeur Rodney James.\n\nThe four friends change partners at a party, where Brooke and Michael step outside behind Kitty and Johnny. In an effort to make the others jealous, Kitty, Johnny, Brooke, Michael, Elizabeth and Rodney begin their romance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Michael Oliver Pritchard III\n* [[Cybill Shepherd]] as Brooke Carter\n* [[Madeline Kahn]] as Kitty O'Kelly\n* [[Duilio Del Prete]] as Johnny Spanish\n* [[Eileen Brennan]] as Elizabeth\n* [[John Hillerman]] as Rodney James\n* [[Mildred Natwick]] as Mabel Pritchard\n* [[M.

Cole Porter lyrics are less sentimental than, say, Gershwin and more abrasive... Gershwin was the greater musician. But Cole was a better lyricist and I was more interested in lyrics than music.\"<ref name=\"burt\"/> When he heard the lyrics for \"I Loved Him\", with its reversal of emotion and wry lyric, he decided to use that as the finale and \"worked back from there\".<ref name=\"burt\"/> The film was originally called ''Quadrille'', and was equally weighted between the four lead characters.<ref>Bogdanovich--Will 'Nickelodeon' Be His Last Picture Show?: Bogdanovich--What Went Wrong?

Resisting the urge to shoot another film in black and white, Bogdanovich had it art-directed as \"Black and White in Color\".

Please note figures are rentals not total gross.</ref>\n}}\n'''''At Long Last Love''''' is a 1975 American [[jukebox musical|jukebox]] [[musical film|musical]] [[comedy film]] written, produced, and directed by [[Peter Bogdanovich]]. It stars [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Cybill Shepherd]], [[Madeline Kahn]], and [[Duilio Del Prete]] as two couples who each switch partners during a party and attempt to make each other jealous. Featuring 18 songs with music and lyrics by [[Cole Porter]], Bogdanovich was inspired to make a musical with the composer's songs after Shepherd gave him a book of his songs. All of the musical sequences were performed live by the cast, since ''At Long Last Love'' was meant by Bogdanovich to be a tribute to 1930s musical films like ''[[One Hour With You]]'', ''[[The Love Parade]]'', ''[[The Merry Widow (1934 film)|The Merry Widow]]'' and ''[[The Smiling Lieutenant]]'' that also filmed the songs in the same manner.\n\n[[20th Century Fox]] rushed the film's release, only allowing for two test screenings before the final version premiered at [[Radio City Music Hall]]. Despite a few decent published opinions from [[film critic|critic]]s like [[Roger Ebert]], ''At Long Last Love'' faced mostly horrendous initial reviews that mainly targeted the lead actors' performances of the musical numbers; and very low box office returns, only making less than half of its $5.14 million budget. The critical reception was so negative that Bogdanovich printed newspaper ads apologizing for the film. Apart from a 1981 [[videocassette]] release, ''At Long Last Love'' didn't have an official home media release for many years, so the only available versions of the film were through bootleg TV, VHS recordings, and 16mm prints. This was until the early 2010s; Bogdanovich's 121-minute 1979 default version of the film was issued to [[Netflix]] in 2012, and the \"Definitive Director's Version,\" which was 90 seconds longer, was released on Blu-ray in 2013.\n==Plot==\nFour socialites unexpectedly clash: heiress Brooke Carter runs into the Italian gambler Johnny Spanish at the race track while playboy Michael O. Pritchard nearly runs into stage star Kitty O'Kelly with his car. Backstage at Kitty's show, it turns out she and Brooke are old friends who attended public school together. The foursome do the town, accompanied by Brooke's companion Elizabeth, who throws herself at Michael's butler and chauffeur Rodney James.\n\nThe four friends change partners at a party, where Brooke and Michael step outside behind Kitty and Johnny. In an effort to make the others jealous, Kitty, Johnny, Brooke, Michael, Elizabeth and Rodney begin their romance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Michael Oliver Pritchard III\n* [[Cybill Shepherd]] as Brooke Carter\n* [[Madeline Kahn]] as Kitty O'Kelly\n* [[Duilio Del Prete]] as Johnny Spanish\n* [[Eileen Brennan]] as Elizabeth\n* [[John Hillerman]] as Rodney James\n* [[Mildred Natwick]] as Mabel Pritchard\n* [[M.

For the first time in many years he watched it himself, and for the first time in years, he liked what he saw. But it was not his cut.\n\nIt was discovered that a longtime studio editor named Jim Blakely had secretly assembled another version of the film (running approximately 121 minutes) which more closely resembled Bogdanovich's shooting script and first preview cut. He quietly substituted it as the default version as early as 1979, and that was the version made available to Netflix.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/motion-captured/posts/peter-bogdanovich-screens-new-cut-of-at-long-last-love-and-tells-story-behind-it|title=Peter Bogdanovich screens new cut of \u2018At Long Last Love\u2019 and tells story behind it|date=2012-01-09|newspaper=UPROXX|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-31}}</ref> The director has gratefully acknowledged Jim Blakely, who died before anyone learned what he had done.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/06/at-long-last-the-definitive-version-of-at-long-last-love-131623/|title=At Long Last: The Definitive Version of \"At Long Last Love\" {{!}} IndieWire|last=Bogdanovich|first=Peter|website=www.indiewire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}</ref>\n\nAfter finding out how it happened, Bogdanovich called Fox to say he liked that version. He made some refinements, including 90 seconds of restored footage, bringing the final running time to 123 minutes. The studio released it as the \"Definitive Director's Version\" on Blu-ray disc in June 2013, resulting in more positive reviews than the theatrical version received.\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1975]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0072665|At Long Last Love}}\n* {{tcmdb title|67740|At Long Last Love}}\n* {{allmovie|84072|At Long Last Love}}\n* {{mojo title|atlonglastlove|At Long Last Love}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|at_long_last_love|At Long Last Love}}\n* [[Roger Ebert]]'s [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19750101/REVIEWS/501010302/1023 review] at the ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' website\n\n{{Peter Bogdanovich}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:At Long Last Love}}\n[[Category:1975 films]]\n[[Category:1970s musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:1970s romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic musical films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about actors]]\n[[Category:Films about music and musicians]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Bogdanovich]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Frank Marshall]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1930s]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Jukebox musical films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Peter Bogdanovich]]\n", "name_user": "Milladrive", "label": "safe", "comment": "Corrected verb tense", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_Long_Last_Love"}
