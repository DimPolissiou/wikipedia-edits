This is typically reached through offer and an acceptance which does not vary the offer's terms, which is known as the \"[[mirror image rule]]\". An offer is a definite statement of the offeror's willingness to be bound should certain conditions be met.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of Irish Contract Law|last=Enright|first=M\u00e1ir\u00e9ad|publisher=Clarus Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> If a purported acceptance does vary the terms of an offer, it is not an acceptance but a counteroffer and, therefore, simultaneously a rejection of the original offer. The [[Uniform Commercial Code]] disposes of the mirror image rule in \u00a72-207, although the UCC only governs transactions in goods in the USA. As a court cannot read minds, the intent of the parties is interpreted [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]] from the perspective of a [[reasonable person]],<ref>DiMatteo L. (1997). [http://www.cisg.law.pace.edu/cisg/biblio/dimatteo5.html The Counterpoise of Contracts: The Reasonable Person Standard and the Subjectivity of Judgment]. ''South Carolina Law Review''.</ref> as determined in the early English case of ''[[Smith v Hughes]]'' [1871]. It is important to note that where an offer specifies a particular mode of acceptance, only an acceptance communicated via that method will be valid.<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|10|1973|litigants=George Hudson Holdings Ltd v Rudder (1973) 128 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 387 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n\n<!--  Commented out: [[File:Parkingticketcontract.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Unilateral contract of adhesion on timekeeping ticket dispensed by vending machine at parking lot entrance {{pufc|Parkingticketcontract.jpg}}]] -->\nContracts may be [[wikt:Bilateral|bilateral]] or [[unilateral]]. A bilateral contract is an agreement in which each of the parties to the contract makes a [[promise]]<ref>[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/promise promise legal definition of promise. promise synonyms by the Free Online Law Dictionary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  or set of promises to each other. For example, in a contract for the sale of a home, the buyer promises to pay the seller $200,000 in exchange for the seller's promise to deliver title to the property. These common contracts take place in the daily flow of [[commerce]] transactions, and in cases with sophisticated or expensive [[condition precedent|precedent]] requirements, which are requirements that must be met for the contract to be fulfilled.\n\nLess common are unilateral contracts in which one party makes a promise, but the other side does not promise anything. In these cases, those accepting the offer are not required to communicate their acceptance to the offeror. In a reward contract, for example, a person who has lost a dog could promise a reward if the dog is found, through publication or orally. The payment could be additionally conditioned on the dog being returned alive. Those who learn of the reward are not required to search for the dog, but if someone finds the dog and delivers it, the promisor is required to pay. In the similar case of advertisements of deals or bargains, a general rule is that these are not contractual offers but merely an \"invitation to treat\" (or bargain), but the applicability of this rule is disputed and contains various exceptions.<ref>Feinman JM, Brill SR. (2006). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=943315&download=yes Is an Advertisement an Offer? Why it is, and Why it Matters]. ''Hastings Law Journal''.</ref> The High Court of Australia stated that the term unilateral contract is \"unscientific and misleading\".<ref>Wilmot et al, 2009, ''Contract Law'', Third Edition, Oxford University Press, page 34</ref>\n\nIn certain circumstances, an [[implied contract]] may be created. A contract is [[implied in fact contract|implied in fact]] if the circumstances imply that parties have reached an agreement even though they have not done so expressly. For example, John Smith, a former lawyer may implicitly enter a contract by visiting a doctor and being examined; if the patient refuses to pay after being examined, the patient has [[Breach of contract|breached a contract]] implied in fact. A contract which is [[implied in law contract|implied in law]] is also called a [[quasi-contract]], because it is not in fact a contract; rather, it is a means for the [[court]]s to remedy situations in which one party would be [[Unjust enrichment|unjustly enriched]] were he or she not required to compensate the other. [[Quantum meruit]] claims are an example.\n\n===Invitation to treat===\n{{Main|Invitation to treat}}\nWhere something is advertised in a newspaper or on a poster, the advertisement will not normally constitute an offer but will instead be an [[invitation to treat]], an indication that one or both parties are prepared to negotiate a deal.<ref>''[[Partridge v Crittenden]]'' [1968] 1 WLR 1204</ref><ref>[http://www.lexisnexis.com.wwwproxy0.library.unsw.edu.au/au/legal/search/casessubmitForm.do ''Harris v Nickerson'' (1873) LR8QB 286]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>''Household Fire Insurance v Grant'' 1879</ref>\n\n[[File:Carbolic smoke ball co.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|The Carbolic Smoke Ball offer]]\nAn exception arises if the advertisement makes a unilateral promise, such as the offer of a reward, as in the famous case of ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co]]'',<ref>{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co]] |parallelcite=[1893] 2 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 256 |year=1892 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=1 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> decided in [[Victorian era|nineteenth-century England]]. The company, a pharmaceutical manufacturer, advertised a smoke ball that would, if sniffed \"three times daily for two weeks\", prevent users from catching the [[Influenza|'flu]]. If the [[Panacea (medicine)|smoke ball]] failed to prevent 'flu, the company promised that they would pay the user [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]100, adding that they had \"deposited \u00a31,000 in the Alliance Bank to show our sincerity in the matter\". When Mrs Carlill sued for the money, the company argued the advert should not be taken as a serious, [[legally binding]] [[Offer and Acceptance|offer]]; instead it was a [[gimmick|\"mere puff\"]]; but the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] held that it would appear to a [[reasonable man]] that Carbolic had made a serious offer, and determined that the reward was a contractual promise.\n\nAlthough an invitation to treat cannot be accepted, it should not be ignored, for it may nevertheless affect the offer.  For instance, where an offer is made in response to an invitation to <span lang=\"simple\">treat</span>, the offer may incorporate the terms of the invitation to treat (unless the offer expressly incorporates different terms).  If, as in the ''Boots case'',<ref>[http://legal.thomsonreuters.com.au/product/AU/files/720502512/pharmaceutical_society_of_great_britian_v_boots_cash_chemists.pdf ''Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v.

Until the announcement is made any bidder may retract his bid.\"\n\n====Electronic contracts====\nEntry into contracts online has become common. Many jurisdictions have passed e-signature laws that have made the electronic contract and signature as legally valid as a paper contract.\n\nIn India, E-contracts are governed by the Indian Contract Act (1872), according to which certain conditions need to be fulfilled while formulating a valid contact. Certain sections in information Technology Act (2000) also provide for validity of online contract.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Linstone|first1=Harold A.|title=Understanding Electronic Contracts - The Indian Law of Contract|url=http://www.nalsarpro.org/CL/Modules/Module%201/Chapter3.pdf|website=Nalsar Pro|accessdate=3 April 2018|date=9 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn some U.S. states, email exchanges have become binding contracts. New York courts in 2016 held that the principles of real estate contracts to apply equally to electronic communications and electronic signatures, so long as \u201cits contents and subscription meet all requirements of the governing statute\u201d and pursuant to the Electronic Signatures and Records Act (ESRA).<ref>{{cite web|title=''Stonehill Capital Management LLC v.

For example, in ''[[Rose & Frank Co v JR Crompton & Bros Ltd]]'', an agreement between two business parties was not enforced because an \"honour clause\" in the document stated \"this is not a commercial or legal agreement, but is only a statement of the intention of the parties\".\n\nIn contrast, domestic and social agreements such as those between children and parents are typically unenforceable on the basis of [[public policy]]. For example, in the English case ''[[Balfour v. Balfour]]'' a husband agreed to give his wife \u00a330 a month while he was away from home, but the court refused to enforce the agreement when the husband stopped paying. In contrast, in ''[[Merritt v Merritt]]'' the court enforced an agreement between an estranged couple because the circumstances suggested their agreement was intended to have legal consequences.\n\n===Consideration===\n{{Main|Consideration}}\nA concept of English common law, [[consideration]]  is required for simple contracts but not for special contracts (contracts by [[deed]]).  The court in ''Currie v Misa'' <ref>''Currie v Misa''  (1875)  LR 10 Ex 893</ref> declared consideration to be a \u201cRight,  Interest,  Profit,  Benefit, or Forbearance,  Detriment,  Loss,  Responsibility\u201d. Thus, consideration is a promise of something of value given by a promissor in exchange for something of value given by a promisee; and typically the thing of value is goods, money, or an act. Forbearance to act, such as an adult promising to refrain from smoking, is enforceable '''only''' if one is thereby surrendering a legal right.<ref>''Wade v Simeon'' (1846)  2 CB 548</ref><ref>''White v Bluett''  (1853)  2 WR 75</ref><ref>Bronaugh R.

''William & Mary Law Review''.</ref>\n\nIn ''Dunlop v. Selfridge'' Lord Dunedin adopted Pollack's metaphor of purchase and sale{{clarify|date=April 2018}} to explain consideration.

Atiyah, 'Consideration: A Restatement' in ''Essays on Contract'' (1986) p.195, Oxford University Press</ref> However, [[legislation]], rather than judicial development, has been touted as the only way to remove this entrenched common law doctrine. [[Lord Denning|Lord Justice Denning]] famously stated that \"The doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a side-wind.\"<ref name=\"High Trees\">{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd]] |year=2007 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=1329 |parallelcite=[1947] [[Kings Bench|KB]] 130 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> In the United States, the emphasis has shifted to the process of bargaining as exemplified by ''[[Hamer v. Sidway]]'' (1891).\n\nCourts will typically not weigh the \"adequacy\" of consideration provided the consideration is determined to be \"sufficient\", with sufficiency defined as meeting the test of law, whereas \"adequacy\" is the subjective fairness or equivalence. For instance, agreeing to sell a car for a penny may constitute a binding contract<ref>''[[Chappell & Co Ltd v. Nestle Co Ltd]]'' [1959] 2 All ER 701 in which the wrappers from three chocolate bars was held to be part of the consideration for the sale and purchase of a musical recording.</ref> (although if the transaction is an attempt to avoid tax, it will be treated by the tax authority as though a market price had been paid).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/frequently-asked-questions-on-gift-taxes#2|title=Frequently Asked Questions on Gift Taxes|website=www.irs.gov|access-date=2016-05-26}}</ref> Parties may do this for tax purposes, attempting to disguise gift transactions as contracts. This is known as the ''peppercorn rule'', but in some jurisdictions, the penny may constitute legally insufficient ''nominal consideration''.

For example, in the early English case of ''Eastwood v. Kenyon'' [1840], the guardian  of a young girl took out a loan to educate her. After she was married, her husband promised to pay the debt but the loan was determined to be past consideration. The insufficiency of past consideration is related to the ''[[pre-existing duty rule]]''. In the early English case of ''[[Stilk v. Myrick]]'' [1809], a captain promised to divide the wages of two deserters among the remaining crew if they agreed to sail home short-handed; however, this promise was found unenforceable as the crew were already contracted to sail the ship. The pre-existing duty rule also extends to general legal duties; for example, a promise to refrain from committing a tort or crime is not sufficient.<ref>''Collins v. Godefroy'' (1831) 1 B. & Ad. 950.</ref>\n\n==Capacity==\n{{Main|Capacity (law)}}\nSometimes the capacity of either [[natural person|natural]] or [[Legal person|artificial]] persons to either enforce contracts, or have contracts enforced against them is restricted. For instance, very small children may not be held to bargains they have made, on the assumption that they lack the maturity to understand what they are doing; errant employees or directors may be prevented from contracting for their company, because they have acted ''[[ultra vires]]'' (beyond their power). Another example might be people who are mentally incapacitated, either by disability or drunkenness.<ref>see for a discussion of the position in English law, the [[Capacity in English law#lackofcapacity intoxication2016-07-24|article on Capacity in English law]]</ref>\n\nEach contractual party must be a \"competent person\" having legal capacity. The parties may be natural persons  (\"individuals\") or [[Legal personality|juristic person]]s (\"[[corporation]]s\"). An agreement is formed when an \"offer\" is accepted. The parties must have an [[intention to be legally bound]]; and to be valid, the agreement must have both proper [[Formalities in English law|\"form\"]] and a lawful object.  In [[England]] (and in [[jurisdiction]]s using English contract principles), the parties must also exchange \"[[Consideration in English law|consideration]]\" to create a \"mutuality of obligation,\" as in [[Semble#law|Simpkins v Pays]].<ref>[http://contracts.uslegal.com/elements-of-a-contract/ Elements of a Contract - Contracts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn the United States, persons under 18 are typically [[Minor (law)|minor]] and their contracts are considered [[voidable]]; however, if the minor voids the contract, benefits received by the minor must be returned.

Representations, which are often precontractual, are typically less strictly enforced than terms, and material misrepresentations historically was a cause of action for the [[tort of deceit]]. Warranties were enforced regardless of materiality; in modern United States law the distinction is less clear but warranties may be enforced more strictly.<ref name=West&Lewis2009/> Statements of opinion may be viewed as \"mere puff\".\n\nIn specific circumstances these terms are used differently.

English courts may weigh the emphasis or relative knowledge in determining whether a statement is enforceable as part of the contract. In the English case of ''Bannerman v White''<ref>''Bannerman v White'' [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1861/713.pdf <nowiki>[1861]</nowiki> EngR 713]; (1861) 10 CBNS 844, Court of Common Pleas (United Kingdom).</ref> the court upheld a rejection by a buyer of hops which had been treated with sulphur since the buyer explicitly expressed the importance of this requirement. The relative knowledge of the parties may also be a factor, as in English case of ''Bissett v Wilkinson''<ref name=\"Bissett v Wilkinson\">''Bissett v Wilkinson'' [1927] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 177.</ref> where the court did not find misrepresentation when a seller said that farmland being sold would carry 2000 sheep if worked by one team; the buyer was considered sufficiently knowledgeable to accept or reject the seller's opinion.\n\n===Standard terms and contracts of adhesion===\n[[Standard form contract]]s contain \"[[Boilerplate clause|boilerplate]]\", which is a set of \"[[one size fits all]]\" contract provisions. However, the term may also narrowly refer to conditions at the end of the contract which specify the governing law provision, venue, assignment and delegation, waiver of jury trial, notice, and [[force majeure]]. Restrictive provisions in contracts where the consumer has little negotiating power (\"contracts of adhesion\") attract [[consumer protection]] scrutiny.\n\n===Implied terms===\nA term may either be express or implied.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/implied-terms-in-a-contract-definition-explanation.html|title=Implied Terms in a Contract: Definition & Explanation - Video & Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|website=study.com|access-date=2018-09-14}}</ref> An express term is stated by the parties during negotiation or written in a contractual document. Implied terms are not stated but nevertheless form a provision of the contract.\n\n====Terms implied in fact====\nTerms may be implied due to the factual circumstances or conduct of the parties. In the case of ''[[BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings]]'',<ref name=\"BP Refinery\"/> the UK [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]], on appeal from Australia, proposed a five-stage test to determine situations where the facts of a case may imply terms. The classic tests have been the \"business efficacy test\" and the \"officious bystander test\". Under the \"business efficacy test\" first proposed in ''[[The Moorcock]]'' [1889], the minimum terms necessary to give business efficacy to the contract will be implied. Under the officious bystander test (named in ''[[Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd v Shirlaw]]'' [1940] but actually originating in ''Reigate v. Union Manufacturing Co (Ramsbottom) Ltd'' [1918]), a term can only be implied in fact if an \"officious bystander\" listening to the contract negotiations suggested that the term be included the parties would promptly agree. The difference between these tests is questionable.\n\n====Terms implied in law====\n[[Statute]]s or [[common law|judicial rulings]] may create implied contractual terms, particularly in standardized relationships such as employment or shipping contracts. The Uniform Commercial Code of the United States also imposes an [[implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing]] in performance and enforcement of contracts covered by the Code. In addition, [[Australia]], [[Israel]] and [[India]] imply a similar good faith term through laws.\n\nIn England, some contracts (insurance and partnerships) require [[Uberrima fides|utmost good faith]], while others may require [[Good faith (law)|good faith]] (employment contracts and agency). Most English contracts do '''not''' need any good faith, provided that the law is met. There is, however, an overarching concept of \"[[legitimate expectation]]\".\n\nMost [[Country|countries]] have statutes which deal directly with sale of goods, lease transactions, and trade practices. In the United States, prominent examples include, in the case of products, an implied [[warranty]] of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, and in the case of homes an implied warranty of habitability.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, implied terms may be created by:\n* Statute, such as the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]], the [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]] and the [[Hague-Visby Rules]];\n* Common Law, such as ''[[The Moorcock]]'',<ref>''[[The Moorcock]]'' (1889) 14 PD 64.</ref> which introduced the \"business efficacy\" test;\n* Previous Dealings, as in [[J Spurling Ltd v Bradshaw|''Spurling v Bradshaw'']].<ref>{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[J Spurling Ltd v Bradshaw]] |year=1956 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=3 |parallelcite=[1956] 2 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 121 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n* Custom, as in ''[[Hutton v Warren]]''.<ref>''[[Hutton v Warren]]'' [1836] M&W 466.</ref>\n\n====Terms implied by custom====\nA term may be implied on the basis of custom or usage in a particular market or context.

While a contract is being performed, it is called an [[executory contract]], and when it is completed it is an executed contract.

Void contracts cannot be ratified by either party. Voidable contracts ''can'' be ratified.\n\n===Misrepresentation===\n{{Main|Misrepresentation}}\nMisrepresentation means a false statement of fact made by one party to another party and has the effect of inducing that party into the contract. For example, under certain circumstances, false statements or promises made by a seller of goods regarding the quality or nature of the product that the seller has may constitute misrepresentation. A finding of misrepresentation allows for a remedy of rescission and sometimes damages depending on the type of misrepresentation.\n\nIn a court of law, to prove misrepresentation and/or fraud, there must be evidence that shows a claim was made, said claim was false, the party making the claim knew the claim was false, and that party's intention was for a transaction to occur based upon the false claim.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Knapp|first=Charles|title=Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials|last2=Crystal|first2=Nathan|last3=Prince|first3=Harry|publisher=Aspen Publishers/Wolters Kluwer Law & Business|year=2007|isbn=|edition=4th|location=|pages=659}}</ref>\n\nThere are two types of misrepresentation: fraud in the factum and fraud in inducement. Fraud in the factum focuses on whether the party alleging misrepresentation knew they were creating a contract. If the party did not know that they were entering into a contract, there is no meeting of the minds, and the contract is void. Fraud in inducement focuses on misrepresentation attempting to get the party to enter into the contract. Misrepresentation of a material fact (if the party knew the truth, that party would not have entered into the contract) makes a contract voidable.\n\nAssume two people, Party A and Party B, enter into a contract. Then, it is later determined that Party A did not fully understand the facts and information described within the contract. If Party B used this lack of understanding against Party A to enter into the contract, Party A has the right to void the contract.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Bix|first=Brian|title=Contract Law: Rules, Theory, and Context|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=44-45}}</ref>\n\nThe foundational principle of \u201ccaveat emptor,\u201d which means \u201clet the buyer beware,\u201d applies to all American transactions.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Bix|first=Brian|title=Contract Law: Rules, Theory, and Context|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=44-45}}</ref> In [[Laidlaw v.

Common law has identified three types of mistake in contract: common mistake, mutual mistake, and unilateral mistake.\n*'''Common mistake''' occurs when both parties hold the same mistaken belief of the facts. This is demonstrated in the case of ''[[Bell v. Lever Brothers Ltd.]]'',<ref>''[[Bell v. Lever Brothers Ltd.]]'' [1931] ALL E.R. Rep. 1, [1932] A.C. 161</ref> which established that common mistake can only void a contract if the mistake of the subject-matter was sufficiently fundamental to render its identity different from what was contracted, making the performance of the contract impossible.<ref name=\"Svanosi v McNamara\">see also {{cite AustLII|HCA|55|1956|litigants=Svanosi v McNamara |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.</ref> In ''Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd'', the court held that the common law will grant relief against common mistake, if the test in ''Bell v.

Each believes they are contracting to something different. Courts usually try to uphold such mistakes if a reasonable interpretation of the terms can be found. However, a contract based on a mutual mistake in judgment does not cause the contract to be voidable by the party that is adversely affected. See ''[[Raffles v Wichelhaus]]''.<ref>''[[Raffles v Wichelhaus]]'' (1864) 2 Hurl. & C. 906.</ref>\n*'''Unilateral mistake''' occurs when only one party to a contract is mistaken as to the terms or subject-matter. The courts will uphold such a contract unless it was determined that the non-mistaken party was aware of the mistake and tried to take advantage of the mistake.<ref>[[Smith v. Hughes]] [1871].</ref><ref name=\"Taylor v Johnson\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|5|1983|litigants=[[Taylor v Johnson]] |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.</ref> It is also possible for a contract to be void if there was a mistake in the identity of the contracting party. An example is in ''Lewis v Avery''<ref>{{cite BAILII|court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=4 |year=1971 |litigants=Lewis v Avery |parallelcite=[1971] 3 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 907 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> where [[Lord Denning|Lord Denning MR]] held that the contract can only be voided if the plaintiff can show that, at the time of agreement, the plaintiff believed the other party's identity was of vital importance. A mere mistaken belief as to the credibility of the other party is not sufficient.\n\n===Duress and undue influence===\n{{Main|Duress (contract law)|Undue influence}}\nDuress has been defined as a \"threat of harm made to compel a person to do something against his or her will or judgment; esp., a wrongful threat made by one person to compel a manifestation of seeming assent by another person to a transaction without real volition.\"<ref>[[Black's Law Dictionary]] (8th ed. 2004)</ref> An example is in ''[[Barton v Armstrong]]'' [1976] in a person was threatened with death if they did not sign the contract. An innocent party wishing to set aside a contract for duress to the person need only to prove that the threat was made and that it was a reason for entry into the contract; the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] then shifts to the other party to prove that the threat had no effect in causing the party to enter into the contract.

However, the agreement was unenforceable as it was intended to \"stifle a criminal prosecution\", and the bank was forced to return the payments made by the husband.\n\nIn the U.S., one unusual type of unenforceable contract is a personal [[employment]] contract to work as a spy or secret agent. This is because the very secrecy of the contract is a condition of the contract (in order to maintain [[plausible deniability]]). If the spy subsequently sues the government on the contract over issues like salary or benefits, then the spy has breached the contract by revealing its existence. It is thus unenforceable on that ground, as well as the public policy of maintaining [[national security]] (since a disgruntled agent might try to reveal ''all'' the government's secrets during his/her lawsuit).<ref>''[[Tenet v. Doe]]'', {{ussc|544|1|2005}}.</ref>  Other types of unenforceable employment contracts include contracts agreeing to work for less than [[minimum wage]] and forfeiting the right to [[workman's compensation]] in cases where workman's compensation is due.\n\n===Remedies for defendant on defenses===\n\n====Setting aside the contract====\nThere can be four different ways in which contracts can be set aside. A contract may be deemed '[[void (law)|void]]', '[[voidable]]', '[[unenforceable]]' or 'ineffective'. Voidness implies that a contract never came into existence. Voidability implies that one or both parties may declare a contract ineffective at their wish. Kill fees are paid by magazine publishers to authors when their articles are submitted on time but are subsequently not used for publication. When this occurs, the magazine cannot claim copyright for the \"killed\" assignment. Unenforceability implies that neither party may have recourse to a court for a remedy. Ineffectiveness implies that the contract terminates by order of a court where a public body has failed to satisfy [[public procurement]] law. To [[Rescission (contract law)|rescind]] is to set aside or unmake a contract.\n\n==Disputes==\n===Procedure===\n{{Main|Civil procedure}}\nIn many countries, in order to obtain damages for breach of contract or to obtain specific performance or other equitable relief, the aggrieved injured party may file a civil (non-criminal) lawsuit in court.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Farnsworth|first1=E.

Likewise, in the United States, an aggrieved party may apply for injunctive relief to prevent a threatened breach of contract, where such breach would result in irreparable harm that could not be adequately remedied by money damages.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rowan|first1=Sol\u00e8ne|title=Remedies for Breach of Contract: A Comparative Analysis of the Protection of Performance|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199606603|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TofAQAAQBAJ|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Arbitration====\nIf the contract contains a valid [[arbitration]] clause then, prior to filing a lawsuit, the aggrieved party must submit an arbitration claim in accordance with the procedures set forth in the clause. Many contracts provide that all disputes arising thereunder will be resolved by arbitration, rather than litigated in courts.  <ref> www.russolaw-llc.com </ref>\n\nArbitration judgments may generally be enforced in the same manner as ordinary court judgments, and are recognized and enforceable internationally under the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention]], which has 156 parties. However, in New York Convention states, arbitral decisions are generally immune unless there is a showing that the arbitrator's decision was irrational or tainted by [[fraud]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=A.A.|title=Circumventing the Supremacy Clause - Understanding the Constitutional Implications of the United States' Treatment of Treaty Obligations through an Analysis of the New York Convention|journal=San Diego International Law Journal|date=2005|volume=7|page=491|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/sdintl7&div=24&id=&page=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome arbitration clauses are not enforceable, and in other cases arbitration may not be sufficient to resolve a legal dispute.

In the absence of a [[choice of law clause]], the court will normally apply either the law of the forum or the law of the jurisdiction that has the strongest connection to the subject matter of the contract. A choice of law clause allows the parties to agree in advance that their contract will be interpreted under the laws of a specific jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Common Contract Clauses|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/contract_clauses.html#choice-of-law-and-forum-clause|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=10 October 2017|date=22 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nWithin the United States, choice of law clauses are generally enforceable, although exceptions based upon public policy may at times apply.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Healy|first1=James J.|title=Consumer Protection Choice of Law: European Lessons for the United States|journal=Duke Journal of Comparative & International Law|date=2008|volume=19|page=535|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1284&context=djcil|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref> Within the European Union, even when the parties have negotiated a choice of law clause, conflict of law issues may be governed by the [[Rome I Regulation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32008R0593|website=Eur-Lex|accessdate=10 October 2017|date=17 June 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Choice of forum====\nMany contracts contain a [[forum selection clause]] setting out where disputes in relation to the contract should be litigated. The clause may be general, requiring that any case arising from the contract be filed within a specific state or country, or it may require that a case be filed in a specific court. For example, a choice of forum clause may require that a case be filed in the U.S. State of California, or it may require more specifically that the case be filed in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County.\n\nA choice of law or venue is not necessarily binding upon a court. Based upon an analysis of the laws, rules of procedure and public policy of the state and court in which the case was filed, a court that is identified by the clause may find that it should not exercise jurisdiction, or a court in a different jurisdiction or venue may find that the litigation may proceed despite the clause.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://guides.lib.monash.edu/commercial-law/contract-law|title=Commercial law: Contract law|last=|first=|date=|website=Monash University|access-date=}}</ref> As part of that analysis, a court may examine whether the clause conforms with the formal requirements of the jurisdiction in which the case was filed (in some jurisdictions a choice of forum or choice of venue clause only limits the parties if the word \"exclusive\" is explicitly included in the clause). Some jurisdictions will not accept an action that has no connection to the court that was chosen, and others will not enforce a choice of venue clause when they consider themselves to be a more [[forum non conveniens|convenient forum]] for the litigation.<ref>See, e.g., {{cite journal|last1=Mullenix|first1=Linda A.|title=Another Choice of Forum, Another Choice of Law: Consensual Adjudicatory Procedure in Federal Court|journal=Fordham Law Review|date=1988|volume=57|page=291|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/flr57&div=20&id=&page=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome contracts are governed by multilateral instruments that require a non-chosen court to dismiss cases and require the recognition of judgments made by courts having jurisdiction based on a choice of court clause. For example, the [[Brussels regime]] instruments (31 European states) and the [[Hague Choice of Court Agreements Convention]] (European Union, Mexico, Montenegro, Singapore), as well as several instruments related to a specific area of law, may require courts to enforce and recognize choice of law clauses and foreign judgments.\n\n===Remedies===\n{{Main|Breach of contract}}\nIn the United Kingdom, breach of contract is defined in the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]] as:  [i] non-performance, [ ii] poor performance, [iii] part-performance, or [iv] performance which is substantially different from what was reasonably expected.  Innocent parties may repudiate (cancel) the contract only for a major breach (breach of condition),<ref>[[Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd]] [1962] 1 All ER 474; see also {{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1951|litigants=Associated Newspapers Ltd v Bancks |parallelcite=(1951) 83 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 322 |courtname=auto}}.</ref><ref>The Mihailis Angelos [1971] 1 QB 164</ref> but they may always recover compensatory damages, provided that the breach has caused foreseeable loss.\n\nIt was not possible to sue [[the Crown]] in the UK for breach of contract before 1948. However, it was appreciated that contractors might be reluctant to deal on such a basis and claims were entertained under a [[petition of right]] that needed to be endorsed by the [[Home Secretary]] and [[Attorney-General]]. S.1 [[Crown Proceedings Act 1947]] opened the Crown to ordinary contractual claims through the courts as for any other person.\n\n====Damages====\n{{Main|Damages}}\nThere are several different types of damages.\n*Compensatory damages, which are given to the party injured by the breach of contract. With compensatory damages, there are two [[heads of loss]], consequential damage and direct damage. In theory, compensatory damages are designed to put the injured party in his or her rightful position, usually through an award of expectation damages.\n*Liquidated damages are an estimate of loss agreed to in the contract, so that the court avoids calculating compensatory damages and the parties have greater certainty. Liquidated damages clauses may be called \"penalty clauses\" in ordinary language, but the law distinguishes between liquidated damages (legitimate) and penalties (invalid). A test for determining which category a clause falls into was established by the English House of Lords in ''[[Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage & Motor Co Ltd]]''<ref>{{cite BAILII |year=1914 |court=UKHL |num=1 |litigants=[[Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage & Motor Co Ltd]] |parallelcite=[1915] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 79 at 86 per Lord Dunedin |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n*Nominal damages consist of a small cash amount where the court concludes that the defendant is in breach but the plaintiff has suffered no quantifiable pecuniary loss, and may be sought to obtain a legal record of who was at fault.\n*Punitive or exemplary damages are used to punish the party at fault; but even though such damages are not intended primarily to compensate, nevertheless the claimant (and not the state) receives the award.  Exemplary damages are not recognised nor permitted in some jurisdictions.  In the UK, exemplary damages are not available for breach of contract, but are possible after fraud.  Although vitiating factors (such as misrepresentation, mistake, undue influence and duress) relate to contracts, they are not contractual actions, and so, in a roundabout way, a claimant in contract may be able to get exemplary damages.\n\nCompensatory damages compensate the plaintiff for actual losses suffered as accurately as possible.  They may be \"expectation damages\", \"reliance damages\" or \"[[restitution]]ary damages\".  Expectation damages are awarded to put the party in as good of a position as the party would have been in had the contract been performed as promised.<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|36|1954|litigants=Bellgrove v Eldridge |parallelcite=(1954) 90 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 613 |date=20 August 1954 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>  Reliance damages are usually awarded where no reasonably reliable estimate of expectation loss can be arrived at or at the option of the plaintiff. Reliance losses cover expense suffered in reliance to the promise. Examples where reliance damages have been awarded because profits are too speculative include the Australian case of ''[[McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission]]''<ref name=\"McRae v Commonwealth\"/> which concerned a contract for the rights to salvage a ship. In ''Anglia Television Ltd v. Reed''<ref>[1972] 1 QB 60</ref> the English Court of Appeal awarded the plaintiff expenditures incurred prior to the contract in preparation of performance.\n\nAfter a breach has occurred, the innocent party has a duty to mitigate loss by taking any reasonable steps.  Failure to mitigate means that damages may be reduced or even denied altogether.<ref>The [[Uniform Commercial Code|UCC]] states, \"Consequential damages... include any loss... which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise.\" UCC 2-715.In English law the chief authority on mitigation is ''British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co v Underground Electric Railway Co of London''[1912] AC 673, see especially 689 per Lord Haldane.</ref> However, Professor Michael Furmston <ref>M.P. Furmston, ''Cheshire, Fifoot & Furmston's Law of Contract'', 15th edn (OUP: Oxford, 2007) p.779.</ref> has argued that \"it is wrong to express (the mitigation) rule by stating that the plaintiff is under a duty to mitigate his loss\",<ref>M.P. Furmston, ''Cheshire, Fifoot & Furmston's Law of Contract'', 15th edn (OUP: Oxford, 2007) p.779 n.130.</ref> citing ''Sotiros Shipping Inc v Sameiet, The Solholt''.<ref>''Sotiros Shipping Inc v Sameiet, The Solholt'' [1983] 1 Lloyd's Rep 605.</ref> If a party provides notice that the contract will not be completed, an [[anticipatory breach]] occurs.\n\nDamages may be general or consequential. General damages are those damages which naturally flow from a breach of contract. Consequential damages are those damages which, although not naturally flowing from a breach, are naturally supposed by both parties at the time of contract formation. An example would be when someone rents a car to get to a business meeting, but when that person arrives to pick up the car, it is not there. General damages would be the cost of renting a different car. Consequential damages would be the lost business if that person was unable to get to the meeting, if both parties knew the reason the party was renting the car. However, there is still a duty to mitigate the losses. The fact that the car was not there does not give the party a right to not attempt to rent another car.\n\nTo recover damages, a claimant must show that the breach of contract caused foreseeable loss.<ref name=\"Hadley v Baxendale\"/><ref>See also ''Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corp Ltd'' (1987) 9 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 310.</ref> ''[[Hadley v Baxendale]]'' established that the test of foreseeability is both objective or subjective.  In other words, is it foreseeable to the objective bystander, or to the contracting parties, who may have special knowledge?  On the facts of this case, where a miller lost production because a carrier delayed taking broken mill parts for repair, the court held that no damages were payable since the loss was foreseeable neither by the \"reasonable man\" nor by the carrier, both of whom would have expected the miller to have a spare part in store.\n\n====Specific performance====\n{{Main|Specific performance}}\nThere may be circumstances in which it would be unjust to permit the defaulting party simply to buy out the injured party with damages. For example, where an art collector purchases a rare painting and the vendor refuses to deliver, the collector's damages would be equal to the sum paid.\n\nThe court may make an order of what is called \"specific performance\", requiring that the contract be performed. In some circumstances a court will order a party to perform his or her promise (an order of \"[[specific performance]]\") or issue an order, known as an \"injunction\", that a party refrain from doing something that would breach the contract. A specific performance is obtainable for the breach of a contract to sell land or real estate on such grounds that the property has a unique value. In the [[United States]] by way of the [[13th Amendment to the United States Constitution]], specific performance in personal service contracts is only legal \"''as punishment for a crime whereof the criminal shall be dully convicted''.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution | url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxiii.html | accessdate = 2008-10-10}}</ref>\n\nBoth an order for specific performance and an injunction are discretionary remedies, originating for the most part in [[Equity (law)|equity]]. Neither is available as of right and in most jurisdictions and most circumstances a court will not normally order specific performance. A contract for the sale of real property is a notable exception. In most jurisdictions, the sale of real property is enforceable by specific performance. Even in this case the defenses to an action in equity (such as [[Laches (equity)|laches]], the ''bona fide'' purchaser rule, or [[unclean hands]]) may act as a bar to specific performance.\n\nRelated to orders for specific performance, an injunction may be requested when the contract prohibits a certain action. Action for injunction would prohibit the person from performing the act specified in the contract.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of contract law|Roman law}}\n\nWhilst early rules of trade and barter have existed since ancient times, modern laws of contract in the West are traceable from the industrial revolution (1750 onwards), when increasing numbers worked in factories for a cash wage.  In particular, the growing strength of the British economy and the adaptability and flexibility of the [[English law|English common law]] led to a swift development of English<ref>as opposed to Scottish law</ref> contract law, while the more rigid civil law in Europe lagged behind.<ref>In 1789, while the French were engaged in their revolution, the English law was busying itself in defining the rules of auctions: see [[Payne v Cave]]</ref> Colonies within the British empire (including the [[United States|USA]] and [[Dominion|the Dominions]]) would [[Reception statute|adopt the law]] of the mother country.  Civil law countries (especially Germany) later developed their own brand of contract law.  In the 20th century, the growth of export trade led to countries adopting international conventions, such as the [[Hague-Visby Rules]] and the [[United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods|UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods]],<ref>Willmott, L, Christensen, S, Butler, D, & Dixon, B 2009 ''Contract Law'', Third Edition, Oxford University Press, North Melbourne</ref> to promote uniform regulations.\n\n[[File:Bill of sale Louvre AO3765.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Bill of sale]] of a male slave and a building in Shuruppak, [[Sumer]]ian tablet, circa 2600 BC]]\nContract law is based on the principle expressed in the [[Latin]] phrase ''[[pacta sunt servanda]],'' ( \"agreements must be kept\").<ref>[[Hans Wehberg]], ''[[Pacta Sunt Servanda]],'' [[The American Journal of International Law]], Vol. 53, No. 4 (Oct., 1959), [http://www.trans-lex.org/129500 p.775.]; Trans-Lex.org [http://www.trans-lex.org/919000 Principle of Sanctity of contracts]</ref> The common law of contract originated with the now-defuct writ of [[assumpsit]], which was originally a [[tort]] action based on reliance.<ref>Atiyah PS.

In common law jurisdictions such as  England and the United States, a high degree of freedom is the norm. For example, in [[Law of the United States|American law]], it was determined in the 1901 case of ''[[Hurley v. Eddingfield]]'' that a physician was permitted to deny treatment to a patient despite the lack of other available medical assistance and the patient's subsequent death.<ref>Blake V. (2012). [http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2012/05/hlaw1-1205.html When Is a Patient-Physician Relationship Established?]. ''Virtual Mentor''.</ref> This is in contrast to the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], which typically applies certain overarching principles to disputes arising out of contract, as in the [[French Civil Code]]. Other legal systems such as Islamic law, socialist legal systems, and customary law have their own variations.\n\nHowever, in both the [[European union]] and the United States, the need to prevent discrimination has eroded the full extent of freedom of contract. Legislation governing equality, equal pay, racial discrimination, disability discrimination and so on, has imposed limits of the full freedom of contract.<ref name=Bernstein/> For example, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] restricted private racial discrimination against African-Americans.<ref>Douglas D.

Common examples include [[contract of sale|contracts for the sale]] of [[professional service|services]] and goods (both wholesale and retail), [[construction law|construction contracts]], [[Contract of carriage|contracts of carriage]], [[software license]]s, [[employment contract]]s, [[insurance policy|insurance policies]], sale or lease of land, and various other uses.\n\nAlthough the [[European Union]] is fundamentally an economic community with a range of trade rules, there is no overarching \"EU Law of Contract\". In 1993, [[Harvey McGregor]], a British barrister and academic, produced a \"Contract Code\" under the auspices of the English and Scottish [[Law Commission]]s, which was a proposal to both unify and codify the contract laws of England and Scotland. This document was offered as a possible \"Contract Code for Europe\", but tensions between English and German jurists meant that this proposal has so far come to naught.<ref>... indeed the Code was neither published nor adopted by the UK, instead being privately published by an Italian University</ref>\n\n==Contract theory==\nContract theory is the body of legal theory that addresses normative and conceptual questions in contract law. One of the most important questions asked in contract theory is why contracts are enforced. One prominent answer to this question focuses on the economic benefits of enforcing bargains. Another approach, associated with [[Charles Fried]], maintains that the purpose of contract law is to enforce promises. This theory is developed in Fried's book, ''Contract as Promise.'' Other approaches to contract theory are found in the writings of [[legal realism|legal realists]] and [[critical legal studies]] theorists.\n\nMore generally, writers have propounded [[Marxist]] and feminist interpretations of contract.  Attempts at overarching understandings of the purpose and nature of contract as a phenomenon have been made, notably [[Relational contract|relational contract theory]] originally developed by U.S. contracts scholars [[Ian Roderick Macneil]] and Stewart Macaulay, building at least in part on the contract theory work of U.S. scholar [[Lon L. Fuller]], while U.S. scholars have been at the forefront of developing economic theories of contract focussing on questions of [[transaction cost]] and so-called '[[efficient breach]]' theory.\n\nAnother dimension of the theoretical debate in contract is its place within, and relationship to a wider [[law of obligations]]. Obligations have traditionally been divided into contracts, which are voluntarily undertaken and owed to a specific person or persons, and obligations in [[tort]] which are based on the wrongful infliction of harm to certain protected interests, primarily imposed by the law, and typically owed to a wider class of persons.\n\nRecently it has been accepted that there is a third category, restitutionary obligations, based on the [[unjust enrichment]] of the defendant at the plaintiff's expense. Contractual liability, reflecting the constitutive function of contract, is generally for failing to make things better (by not rendering the expected performance), liability in tort is generally for action (as opposed to omission) making things worse, and liability in restitution is for unjustly taking or retaining the benefit of the plaintiff's money or work.<ref>Beatson, ''Anson's Law of Contract'' (1998) 27th ed.

This is typically reached through offer and an acceptance which does not vary the offer's terms, which is known as the \"[[mirror image rule]]\". An offer is a definite statement of the offeror's willingness to be bound should certain conditions be met.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of Irish Contract Law|last=Enright|first=M\u00e1ir\u00e9ad|publisher=Clarus Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> If a purported acceptance does vary the terms of an offer, it is not an acceptance but a counteroffer and, therefore, simultaneously a rejection of the original offer. The [[Uniform Commercial Code]] disposes of the mirror image rule in \u00a72-207, although the UCC only governs transactions in goods in the USA. As a court cannot read minds, the intent of the parties is interpreted [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]] from the perspective of a [[reasonable person]],<ref>DiMatteo L. (1997). [http://www.cisg.law.pace.edu/cisg/biblio/dimatteo5.html The Counterpoise of Contracts: The Reasonable Person Standard and the Subjectivity of Judgment]. ''South Carolina Law Review''.</ref> as determined in the early English case of ''[[Smith v Hughes]]'' [1871]. It is important to note that where an offer specifies a particular mode of acceptance, only an acceptance communicated via that method will be valid.<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|10|1973|litigants=George Hudson Holdings Ltd v Rudder (1973) 128 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 387 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n\n<!--  Commented out: [[File:Parkingticketcontract.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Unilateral contract of adhesion on timekeeping ticket dispensed by vending machine at parking lot entrance {{pufc|Parkingticketcontract.jpg}}]] -->\nContracts may be [[wikt:Bilateral|bilateral]] or [[unilateral]]. A bilateral contract is an agreement in which each of the parties to the contract makes a [[promise]]<ref>[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/promise promise legal definition of promise. promise synonyms by the Free Online Law Dictionary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  or set of promises to each other. For example, in a contract for the sale of a home, the buyer promises to pay the seller $200,000 in exchange for the seller's promise to deliver title to the property. These common contracts take place in the daily flow of [[commerce]] transactions, and in cases with sophisticated or expensive [[condition precedent|precedent]] requirements, which are requirements that must be met for the contract to be fulfilled.\n\nLess common are unilateral contracts in which one party makes a promise, but the other side does not promise anything. In these cases, those accepting the offer are not required to communicate their acceptance to the offeror. In a reward contract, for example, a person who has lost a dog could promise a reward if the dog is found, through publication or orally. The payment could be additionally conditioned on the dog being returned alive. Those who learn of the reward are not required to search for the dog, but if someone finds the dog and delivers it, the promisor is required to pay. In the similar case of advertisements of deals or bargains, a general rule is that these are not contractual offers but merely an \"invitation to treat\" (or bargain), but the applicability of this rule is disputed and contains various exceptions.<ref>Feinman JM, Brill SR. (2006). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=943315&download=yes Is an Advertisement an Offer? Why it is, and Why it Matters]. ''Hastings Law Journal''.</ref> The High Court of Australia stated that the term unilateral contract is \"unscientific and misleading\".<ref>Wilmot et al, 2009, ''Contract Law'', Third Edition, Oxford University Press, page 34</ref>\n\nIn certain circumstances, an [[implied contract]] may be created. A contract is [[implied in fact contract|implied in fact]] if the circumstances imply that parties have reached an agreement even though they have not done so expressly. For example, John Smith, a former lawyer may implicitly enter a contract by visiting a doctor and being examined; if the patient refuses to pay after being examined, the patient has [[Breach of contract|breached a contract]] implied in fact. A contract which is [[implied in law contract|implied in law]] is also called a [[quasi-contract]], because it is not in fact a contract; rather, it is a means for the [[court]]s to remedy situations in which one party would be [[Unjust enrichment|unjustly enriched]] were he or she not required to compensate the other. [[Quantum meruit]] claims are an example.\n\n===Invitation to treat===\n{{Main|Invitation to treat}}\nWhere something is advertised in a newspaper or on a poster, the advertisement will not normally constitute an offer but will instead be an [[invitation to treat]], an indication that one or both parties are prepared to negotiate a deal.<ref>''[[Partridge v Crittenden]]'' [1968] 1 WLR 1204</ref><ref>[http://www.lexisnexis.com.wwwproxy0.library.unsw.edu.au/au/legal/search/casessubmitForm.do ''Harris v Nickerson'' (1873) LR8QB 286]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>''Household Fire Insurance v Grant'' 1879</ref>\n\n[[File:Carbolic smoke ball co.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|The Carbolic Smoke Ball offer]]\nAn exception arises if the advertisement makes a unilateral promise, such as the offer of a reward, as in the famous case of ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co]]'',<ref>{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co]] |parallelcite=[1893] 2 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 256 |year=1892 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=1 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> decided in [[Victorian era|nineteenth-century England]]. The company, a pharmaceutical manufacturer, advertised a smoke ball that would, if sniffed \"three times daily for two weeks\", prevent users from catching the [[Influenza|'flu]]. If the [[Panacea (medicine)|smoke ball]] failed to prevent 'flu, the company promised that they would pay the user [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]100, adding that they had \"deposited \u00a31,000 in the Alliance Bank to show our sincerity in the matter\". When Mrs Carlill sued for the money, the company argued the advert should not be taken as a serious, [[legally binding]] [[Offer and Acceptance|offer]]; instead it was a [[gimmick|\"mere puff\"]]; but the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] held that it would appear to a [[reasonable man]] that Carbolic had made a serious offer, and determined that the reward was a contractual promise.\n\nAlthough an invitation to treat cannot be accepted, it should not be ignored, for it may nevertheless affect the offer.  For instance, where an offer is made in response to an invitation to <span lang=\"simple\">treat</span>, the offer may incorporate the terms of the invitation to treat (unless the offer expressly incorporates different terms).  If, as in the ''Boots case'',<ref>[http://legal.thomsonreuters.com.au/product/AU/files/720502512/pharmaceutical_society_of_great_britian_v_boots_cash_chemists.pdf ''Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v.

Until the announcement is made any bidder may retract his bid.\"\n\n====Electronic contracts====\nEntry into contracts online has become common. Many jurisdictions have passed e-signature laws that have made the electronic contract and signature as legally valid as a paper contract.\n\nIn India, E-contracts are governed by the Indian Contract Act (1872), according to which certain conditions need to be fulfilled while formulating a valid contact. Certain sections in information Technology Act (2000) also provide for validity of online contract.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Linstone|first1=Harold A.|title=Understanding Electronic Contracts - The Indian Law of Contract|url=http://www.nalsarpro.org/CL/Modules/Module%201/Chapter3.pdf|website=Nalsar Pro|accessdate=3 April 2018|date=9 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn some U.S. states, email exchanges have become binding contracts. New York courts in 2016 held that the principles of real estate contracts to apply equally to electronic communications and electronic signatures, so long as \u201cits contents and subscription meet all requirements of the governing statute\u201d and pursuant to the Electronic Signatures and Records Act (ESRA).<ref>{{cite web|title=''Stonehill Capital Management LLC v.

For example, in ''[[Rose & Frank Co v JR Crompton & Bros Ltd]]'', an agreement between two business parties was not enforced because an \"honour clause\" in the document stated \"this is not a commercial or legal agreement, but is only a statement of the intention of the parties\".\n\nIn contrast, domestic and social agreements such as those between children and parents are typically unenforceable on the basis of [[public policy]]. For example, in the English case ''[[Balfour v. Balfour]]'' a husband agreed to give his wife \u00a330 a month while he was away from home, but the court refused to enforce the agreement when the husband stopped paying. In contrast, in ''[[Merritt v Merritt]]'' the court enforced an agreement between an estranged couple because the circumstances suggested their agreement was intended to have legal consequences.\n\n===Consideration===\n{{Main|Consideration}}\nA concept of English common law, [[consideration]]  is required for simple contracts but not for special contracts (contracts by [[deed]]).  The court in ''Currie v Misa'' <ref>''Currie v Misa''  (1875)  LR 10 Ex 893</ref> declared consideration to be a \u201cRight,  Interest,  Profit,  Benefit, or Forbearance,  Detriment,  Loss,  Responsibility\u201d. Thus, consideration is a promise of something of value given by a promissor in exchange for something of value given by a promisee; and typically the thing of value is goods, money, or an act. Forbearance to act, such as an adult promising to refrain from smoking, is enforceable '''only''' if one is thereby surrendering a legal right.<ref>''Wade v Simeon'' (1846)  2 CB 548</ref><ref>''White v Bluett''  (1853)  2 WR 75</ref><ref>Bronaugh R.

''William & Mary Law Review''.</ref>\n\nIn ''Dunlop v. Selfridge'' Lord Dunedin adopted Pollack's metaphor of purchase and sale{{clarify|date=April 2018}} to explain consideration. He called consideration 'the price for which the promise of the other is bought'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of Irish Contract Law|last=Enright|first=M\u00e1ir\u00e9ad|publisher=Clarus Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Dublin 8|pages=75|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn colonial times, the concept of consideration was exported to many common law countries,{{which|date=April 2018}} but it is unknown in Scotland and in civil law jurisdictions.<ref>Scots lawyer [[Harvey McGregor]]'s \"[[Contract Code]]\", a [[Law Commission]]-sponsored proposal to both unite and codify English and Scots Law, proposed the abolition of consideration.</ref>  Roman law-based systems<ref>e.g. In Germany, \u00a7 311 BGB</ref> neither require nor recognise consideration, and some commentators have suggested that consideration be abandoned, and [[estoppel]] be used to replace it as a basis for contracts.<ref>e.g. P.S. Atiyah, 'Consideration: A Restatement' in ''Essays on Contract'' (1986) p.195, Oxford University Press</ref> However, [[legislation]], rather than judicial development, has been touted as the only way to remove this entrenched common law doctrine. [[Lord Denning|Lord Justice Denning]] famously stated that \"The doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a side-wind.\"<ref name=\"High Trees\">{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd]] |year=2007 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=1329 |parallelcite=[1947] [[Kings Bench|KB]] 130 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> In the United States, the emphasis has shifted to the process of bargaining as exemplified by ''[[Hamer v. Sidway]]'' (1891).\n\nCourts will typically not weigh the \"adequacy\" of consideration provided the consideration is determined to be \"sufficient\", with sufficiency defined as meeting the test of law, whereas \"adequacy\" is the subjective fairness or equivalence. For instance, agreeing to sell a car for a penny may constitute a binding contract<ref>''[[Chappell & Co Ltd v. Nestle Co Ltd]]'' [1959] 2 All ER 701 in which the wrappers from three chocolate bars was held to be part of the consideration for the sale and purchase of a musical recording.</ref> (although if the transaction is an attempt to avoid tax, it will be treated by the tax authority as though a market price had been paid).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/frequently-asked-questions-on-gift-taxes#2|title=Frequently Asked Questions on Gift Taxes|website=www.irs.gov|access-date=2016-05-26}}</ref> Parties may do this for tax purposes, attempting to disguise gift transactions as contracts. This is known as the ''peppercorn rule'', but in some jurisdictions, the penny may constitute legally insufficient ''nominal consideration''. An exception to the rule of adequacy is money, whereby a debt must always be paid in full  for \"[[accord and satisfaction]]\".<ref>\"Pinnel\u2019s Case\" (1602)  5 Co Rep 117a</ref><ref>\"Jorden v Money\"\t(1854) 5 HLC 185</ref>{{refn|{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Foakes v Beer]] |court=UKHL |year=1884 |num=1 |parallelcite=(1884) [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 605 |courtname=auto}}.

For example, in the early English case of ''Eastwood v. Kenyon'' [1840], the guardian  of a young girl took out a loan to educate her. After she was married, her husband promised to pay the debt but the loan was determined to be past consideration. The insufficiency of past consideration is related to the ''[[pre-existing duty rule]]''. In the early English case of ''[[Stilk v. Myrick]]'' [1809], a captain promised to divide the wages of two deserters among the remaining crew if they agreed to sail home short-handed; however, this promise was found unenforceable as the crew were already contracted to sail the ship. The pre-existing duty rule also extends to general legal duties; for example, a promise to refrain from committing a tort or crime is not sufficient.<ref>''Collins v. Godefroy'' (1831) 1 B. & Ad. 950.</ref>\n\n==Capacity==\n{{Main|Capacity (law)}}\nSometimes the capacity of either [[natural person|natural]] or [[Legal person|artificial]] persons to either enforce contracts, or have contracts enforced against them is restricted. For instance, very small children may not be held to bargains they have made, on the assumption that they lack the maturity to understand what they are doing; errant employees or directors may be prevented from contracting for their company, because they have acted ''[[ultra vires]]'' (beyond their power). Another example might be people who are mentally incapacitated, either by disability or drunkenness.<ref>see for a discussion of the position in English law, the [[Capacity in English law#lackofcapacity intoxication2016-07-24|article on Capacity in English law]]</ref>\n\nEach contractual party must be a \"competent person\" having legal capacity. The parties may be natural persons  (\"individuals\") or [[Legal personality|juristic person]]s (\"[[corporation]]s\"). An agreement is formed when an \"offer\" is accepted. The parties must have an [[intention to be legally bound]]; and to be valid, the agreement must have both proper [[Formalities in English law|\"form\"]] and a lawful object.  In [[England]] (and in [[jurisdiction]]s using English contract principles), the parties must also exchange \"[[Consideration in English law|consideration]]\" to create a \"mutuality of obligation,\" as in [[Semble#law|Simpkins v Pays]].<ref>[http://contracts.uslegal.com/elements-of-a-contract/ Elements of a Contract - Contracts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn the United States, persons under 18 are typically [[Minor (law)|minor]] and their contracts are considered [[voidable]]; however, if the minor voids the contract, benefits received by the minor must be returned.

Representations, which are often precontractual, are typically less strictly enforced than terms, and material misrepresentations historically was a cause of action for the [[tort of deceit]]. Warranties were enforced regardless of materiality; in modern United States law the distinction is less clear but warranties may be enforced more strictly.<ref name=West&Lewis2009/> Statements of opinion may be viewed as \"mere puff\".\n\nIn specific circumstances these terms are used differently.

The United Kingdom has also contrived the concept of an \"intermediate term\" (also called innominate), first established in ''[[Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd]]'' [1962].\n\n===Representations versus warranties===\nStatements of fact in a contract or in obtaining the contract are considered to be either [[warranty|warranties]] or representations.

ContractsProf Blog.</ref>\n\nStatements in a contract may not be upheld if the court finds that the statements are subjective or promotional [[puffery]]. English courts may weigh the emphasis or relative knowledge in determining whether a statement is enforceable as part of the contract. In the English case of ''Bannerman v White''<ref>''Bannerman v White'' [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1861/713.pdf <nowiki>[1861]</nowiki> EngR 713]; (1861) 10 CBNS 844, Court of Common Pleas (United Kingdom).</ref> the court upheld a rejection by a buyer of hops which had been treated with sulphur since the buyer explicitly expressed the importance of this requirement. The relative knowledge of the parties may also be a factor, as in English case of ''Bissett v Wilkinson''<ref name=\"Bissett v Wilkinson\">''Bissett v Wilkinson'' [1927] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 177.</ref> where the court did not find misrepresentation when a seller said that farmland being sold would carry 2000 sheep if worked by one team; the buyer was considered sufficiently knowledgeable to accept or reject the seller's opinion.\n\n===Standard terms and contracts of adhesion===\n[[Standard form contract]]s contain \"[[Boilerplate clause|boilerplate]]\", which is a set of \"[[one size fits all]]\" contract provisions. However, the term may also narrowly refer to conditions at the end of the contract which specify the governing law provision, venue, assignment and delegation, waiver of jury trial, notice, and [[force majeure]]. Restrictive provisions in contracts where the consumer has little negotiating power (\"contracts of adhesion\") attract [[consumer protection]] scrutiny.\n\n===Implied terms===\nA term may either be express or implied.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/implied-terms-in-a-contract-definition-explanation.html|title=Implied Terms in a Contract: Definition & Explanation - Video & Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|website=study.com|access-date=2018-09-14}}</ref> An express term is stated by the parties during negotiation or written in a contractual document. Implied terms are not stated but nevertheless form a provision of the contract.\n\n====Terms implied in fact====\nTerms may be implied due to the factual circumstances or conduct of the parties. In the case of ''[[BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings]]'',<ref name=\"BP Refinery\"/> the UK [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]], on appeal from Australia, proposed a five-stage test to determine situations where the facts of a case may imply terms. The classic tests have been the \"business efficacy test\" and the \"officious bystander test\". Under the \"business efficacy test\" first proposed in ''[[The Moorcock]]'' [1889], the minimum terms necessary to give business efficacy to the contract will be implied. Under the officious bystander test (named in ''[[Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd v Shirlaw]]'' [1940] but actually originating in ''Reigate v. Union Manufacturing Co (Ramsbottom) Ltd'' [1918]), a term can only be implied in fact if an \"officious bystander\" listening to the contract negotiations suggested that the term be included the parties would promptly agree. The difference between these tests is questionable.\n\n====Terms implied in law====\n[[Statute]]s or [[common law|judicial rulings]] may create implied contractual terms, particularly in standardized relationships such as employment or shipping contracts. The Uniform Commercial Code of the United States also imposes an [[implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing]] in performance and enforcement of contracts covered by the Code. In addition, [[Australia]], [[Israel]] and [[India]] imply a similar good faith term through laws.\n\nIn England, some contracts (insurance and partnerships) require [[Uberrima fides|utmost good faith]], while others may require [[Good faith (law)|good faith]] (employment contracts and agency). Most English contracts do '''not''' need any good faith, provided that the law is met. There is, however, an overarching concept of \"[[legitimate expectation]]\".\n\nMost [[Country|countries]] have statutes which deal directly with sale of goods, lease transactions, and trade practices. In the United States, prominent examples include, in the case of products, an implied [[warranty]] of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, and in the case of homes an implied warranty of habitability.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, implied terms may be created by:\n* Statute, such as the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]], the [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]] and the [[Hague-Visby Rules]];\n* Common Law, such as ''[[The Moorcock]]'',<ref>''[[The Moorcock]]'' (1889) 14 PD 64.</ref> which introduced the \"business efficacy\" test;\n* Previous Dealings, as in [[J Spurling Ltd v Bradshaw|''Spurling v Bradshaw'']].<ref>{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[J Spurling Ltd v Bradshaw]] |year=1956 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=3 |parallelcite=[1956] 2 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 121 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n* Custom, as in ''[[Hutton v Warren]]''.<ref>''[[Hutton v Warren]]'' [1836] M&W 466.</ref>\n\n====Terms implied by custom====\nA term may be implied on the basis of custom or usage in a particular market or context.

While a contract is being performed, it is called an [[executory contract]], and when it is completed it is an executed contract. In some cases there may be [[substantial performance]] but not complete performance, which allows the performing party to be partially compensated.\n\n==Defenses==\n[[Vitiating factors in the law of contract|Vitiating factors]] constituting defences to purported contract formation include:\n* [[Mistake (contract law)|Mistake]] (such as ''[[non est factum]]'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawhandbook.sa.gov.au/ch10s02s05.php|title=Are you bound once you sign a contract?|last=|first=|date=11 December 2009|website=Legal Services Commission of South Australia|publisher=|access-date=10 October 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Capacity (law)|Incapacity]], including mental incompetence and infancy/minority\n* [[Duress#In contract law|Duress]]\n* [[Undue influence]]\n* [[Unconscionability]]\n* [[Misrepresentation]] or fraud\n* [[Frustration of purpose]]\nSuch defenses operate to determine whether a purported contract is either (1)&nbsp;void or (2)&nbsp;voidable. Void contracts cannot be ratified by either party. Voidable contracts ''can'' be ratified.\n\n===Misrepresentation===\n{{Main|Misrepresentation}}\nMisrepresentation means a false statement of fact made by one party to another party and has the effect of inducing that party into the contract. For example, under certain circumstances, false statements or promises made by a seller of goods regarding the quality or nature of the product that the seller has may constitute misrepresentation. A finding of misrepresentation allows for a remedy of rescission and sometimes damages depending on the type of misrepresentation.\n\nIn a court of law, to prove misrepresentation and/or fraud, there must be evidence that shows a claim was made, said claim was false, the party making the claim knew the claim was false, and that party's intention was for a transaction to occur based upon the false claim.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Knapp|first=Charles|title=Problems in Contract Law: Cases and Materials|last2=Crystal|first2=Nathan|last3=Prince|first3=Harry|publisher=Aspen Publishers/Wolters Kluwer Law & Business|year=2007|isbn=|edition=4th|location=|pages=659}}</ref>\n\nThere are two types of misrepresentation: fraud in the factum and fraud in inducement. Fraud in the factum focuses on whether the party alleging misrepresentation knew they were creating a contract. If the party did not know that they were entering into a contract, there is no meeting of the minds, and the contract is void. Fraud in inducement focuses on misrepresentation attempting to get the party to enter into the contract. Misrepresentation of a material fact (if the party knew the truth, that party would not have entered into the contract) makes a contract voidable.\n\nAssume two people, Party A and Party B, enter into a contract. Then, it is later determined that Party A did not fully understand the facts and information described within the contract. If Party B used this lack of understanding against Party A to enter into the contract, Party A has the right to void the contract.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Bix|first=Brian|title=Contract Law: Rules, Theory, and Context|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=44-45}}</ref>\n\nThe foundational principle of \u201ccaveat emptor,\u201d which means \u201clet the buyer beware,\u201d applies to all American transactions.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Bix|first=Brian|title=Contract Law: Rules, Theory, and Context|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=44-45}}</ref> In [[Laidlaw v.

Advertisements utilizing \"puffing,\" or the practice of exaggerating certain things, fall under this question of possible false claims.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|last=Bix|first=Brian|title=Contract Law: Rules, Theory, and Context|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=44-45}}</ref>\n\n===Mistake===\n{{Main|Mistake (contract law)}}\nA mistake is an incorrect understanding by one or more parties to a contract and may be used as grounds to invalidate the agreement. Common law has identified three types of mistake in contract: common mistake, mutual mistake, and unilateral mistake.\n*'''Common mistake''' occurs when both parties hold the same mistaken belief of the facts. This is demonstrated in the case of ''[[Bell v. Lever Brothers Ltd.]]'',<ref>''[[Bell v. Lever Brothers Ltd.]]'' [1931] ALL E.R. Rep. 1, [1932] A.C. 161</ref> which established that common mistake can only void a contract if the mistake of the subject-matter was sufficiently fundamental to render its identity different from what was contracted, making the performance of the contract impossible.<ref name=\"Svanosi v McNamara\">see also {{cite AustLII|HCA|55|1956|litigants=Svanosi v McNamara |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.</ref> In ''Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd'', the court held that the common law will grant relief against common mistake, if the test in ''Bell v. Lever Bros Ltd'' is made out.<ref>{{cite BAILII|court=EWCA |division=Civ |year=2002 |num=1407 |litigants=Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd] |courtname=auto}}.</ref> If one party has knowledge and the other does not, and the party with the knowledge promises or guarantees the existence of the subject matter, that party will be in breach if the subject matter does not exist.<ref name=\"McRae v Commonwealth\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|79|1951|litigants=[[McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1951/79.pdf (1951) 84 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 377] |courtname=auto |date=}}.</ref>\n*'''Mutual mistake''' occurs when both parties of a contract are mistaken as to the terms. Each believes they are contracting to something different. Courts usually try to uphold such mistakes if a reasonable interpretation of the terms can be found. However, a contract based on a mutual mistake in judgment does not cause the contract to be voidable by the party that is adversely affected. See ''[[Raffles v Wichelhaus]]''.<ref>''[[Raffles v Wichelhaus]]'' (1864) 2 Hurl. & C. 906.</ref>\n*'''Unilateral mistake''' occurs when only one party to a contract is mistaken as to the terms or subject-matter. The courts will uphold such a contract unless it was determined that the non-mistaken party was aware of the mistake and tried to take advantage of the mistake.<ref>[[Smith v. Hughes]] [1871].</ref><ref name=\"Taylor v Johnson\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|5|1983|litigants=[[Taylor v Johnson]] |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.</ref> It is also possible for a contract to be void if there was a mistake in the identity of the contracting party. An example is in ''Lewis v Avery''<ref>{{cite BAILII|court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=4 |year=1971 |litigants=Lewis v Avery |parallelcite=[1971] 3 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 907 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> where [[Lord Denning|Lord Denning MR]] held that the contract can only be voided if the plaintiff can show that, at the time of agreement, the plaintiff believed the other party's identity was of vital importance. A mere mistaken belief as to the credibility of the other party is not sufficient.\n\n===Duress and undue influence===\n{{Main|Duress (contract law)|Undue influence}}\nDuress has been defined as a \"threat of harm made to compel a person to do something against his or her will or judgment; esp., a wrongful threat made by one person to compel a manifestation of seeming assent by another person to a transaction without real volition.\"<ref>[[Black's Law Dictionary]] (8th ed. 2004)</ref> An example is in ''[[Barton v Armstrong]]'' [1976] in a person was threatened with death if they did not sign the contract. An innocent party wishing to set aside a contract for duress to the person need only to prove that the threat was made and that it was a reason for entry into the contract; the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] then shifts to the other party to prove that the threat had no effect in causing the party to enter into the contract. There can also be duress to goods and sometimes, 'economic duress'.\n\nUndue influence is an equitable doctrine that involves one person taking advantage of a position of power over another person through a special relationship such as between parent and child or solicitor and client. As an equitable doctrine, the court has discretion. When no special relationship exists, the question is whether there was a relationship of such trust and confidence that it should give rise to such a presumption.<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|41|1936|litigants=[[Johnson v Buttress]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/41.pdf (1936) 56 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 113] |courtname=auto |date=17 August 1936}}.</ref><ref>See also {{cite AustLII|VicRp|29|1982|litigants=Westmelton (Vic) Pty Ltd v Archer and Shulman |parallecite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.</ref><ref>''Odorizzi v.

However, the agreement was unenforceable as it was intended to \"stifle a criminal prosecution\", and the bank was forced to return the payments made by the husband.\n\nIn the U.S., one unusual type of unenforceable contract is a personal [[employment]] contract to work as a spy or secret agent. This is because the very secrecy of the contract is a condition of the contract (in order to maintain [[plausible deniability]]). If the spy subsequently sues the government on the contract over issues like salary or benefits, then the spy has breached the contract by revealing its existence. It is thus unenforceable on that ground, as well as the public policy of maintaining [[national security]] (since a disgruntled agent might try to reveal ''all'' the government's secrets during his/her lawsuit).<ref>''[[Tenet v. Doe]]'', {{ussc|544|1|2005}}.</ref>  Other types of unenforceable employment contracts include contracts agreeing to work for less than [[minimum wage]] and forfeiting the right to [[workman's compensation]] in cases where workman's compensation is due.\n\n===Remedies for defendant on defenses===\n\n====Setting aside the contract====\nThere can be four different ways in which contracts can be set aside. A contract may be deemed '[[void (law)|void]]', '[[voidable]]', '[[unenforceable]]' or 'ineffective'. Voidness implies that a contract never came into existence. Voidability implies that one or both parties may declare a contract ineffective at their wish. Kill fees are paid by magazine publishers to authors when their articles are submitted on time but are subsequently not used for publication. When this occurs, the magazine cannot claim copyright for the \"killed\" assignment. Unenforceability implies that neither party may have recourse to a court for a remedy. Ineffectiveness implies that the contract terminates by order of a court where a public body has failed to satisfy [[public procurement]] law. To [[Rescission (contract law)|rescind]] is to set aside or unmake a contract.\n\n==Disputes==\n===Procedure===\n{{Main|Civil procedure}}\nIn many countries, in order to obtain damages for breach of contract or to obtain specific performance or other equitable relief, the aggrieved injured party may file a civil (non-criminal) lawsuit in court.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Farnsworth|first1=E. Allen|title=Legal Remedies for Breach of Contract|journal=Columbia Law Review|date=November 1970|volume=70|issue=7|pages=1145\u20131216|jstor=1121184|doi=10.2307/1121184}}</ref>\n\nIn [[England and Wales]], a contract may be enforced by use of a [[claim (legal)|claim]], or in urgent cases by applying for an [[interim injunction]] to prevent a breach. Likewise, in the United States, an aggrieved party may apply for injunctive relief to prevent a threatened breach of contract, where such breach would result in irreparable harm that could not be adequately remedied by money damages.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rowan|first1=Sol\u00e8ne|title=Remedies for Breach of Contract: A Comparative Analysis of the Protection of Performance|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199606603|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TofAQAAQBAJ|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Arbitration====\nIf the contract contains a valid [[arbitration]] clause then, prior to filing a lawsuit, the aggrieved party must submit an arbitration claim in accordance with the procedures set forth in the clause. Many contracts provide that all disputes arising thereunder will be resolved by arbitration, rather than litigated in courts.\n\nArbitration judgments may generally be enforced in the same manner as ordinary court judgments, and are recognized and enforceable internationally under the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention]], which has 156 parties. However, in New York Convention states, arbitral decisions are generally immune unless there is a showing that the arbitrator's decision was irrational or tainted by [[fraud]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=A.A.|title=Circumventing the Supremacy Clause - Understanding the Constitutional Implications of the United States' Treatment of Treaty Obligations through an Analysis of the New York Convention|journal=San Diego International Law Journal|date=2005|volume=7|page=491|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/sdintl7&div=24&id=&page=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome arbitration clauses are not enforceable, and in other cases arbitration may not be sufficient to resolve a legal dispute. For example, disputes regarding validity of registered IP rights may need to be resolved by a public body within the national registration system.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Arbitration in Intellectual Property?|url=http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/arbitration/why-is-arb.html|website=WIPO|publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref> For matters of significant public interest that go beyond the narrow interests of the parties to the agreement, such as  claims that a party violated a contract by engaging in illegal anti-competitive conduct or committed civil rights violations, a court might find that the parties may litigate some or all of their claims even before completing a contractually agreed arbitration process.<ref>See, e.g., {{cite journal|last1=Edwards|first1=Harry T.|title=Judicial Review of Labor Arbitration Awards: The Clash Between the Public Policy Exception and the Duty to Bargain|journal=Chicago-Kent Law Review|date=1988|volume=64|issue=1|page=4|url=http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2709&context=cklawreview|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n=====United States=====\nIn the United States, thirty-five states (notably not including New York)<ref>New York Civil Procedure Law and Rules \u00a7 7501, et seq.</ref> and the District of Columbia have adopted the [[Uniform Arbitration Act]] to facilitate the enforcement of arbitrated judgments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Uniform Arbitration Act (1956 Act or 2000 Act)|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uniform/vol7#arbit|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nCustomer claims against securities brokers and dealers are almost always resolved pursuant to contractual arbitration clauses because securities dealers are required under the terms of their membership in self-regulatory organizations such as the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (formerly the NASD) or [[NYSE]] to arbitrate disputes with their customers.

In the absence of a [[choice of law clause]], the court will normally apply either the law of the forum or the law of the jurisdiction that has the strongest connection to the subject matter of the contract. A choice of law clause allows the parties to agree in advance that their contract will be interpreted under the laws of a specific jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Common Contract Clauses|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/contract_clauses.html#choice-of-law-and-forum-clause|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=10 October 2017|date=22 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nWithin the United States, choice of law clauses are generally enforceable, although exceptions based upon public policy may at times apply.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Healy|first1=James J.|title=Consumer Protection Choice of Law: European Lessons for the United States|journal=Duke Journal of Comparative & International Law|date=2008|volume=19|page=535|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1284&context=djcil|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref> Within the European Union, even when the parties have negotiated a choice of law clause, conflict of law issues may be governed by the [[Rome I Regulation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32008R0593|website=Eur-Lex|accessdate=10 October 2017|date=17 June 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Choice of forum====\nMany contracts contain a [[forum selection clause]] setting out where disputes in relation to the contract should be litigated. The clause may be general, requiring that any case arising from the contract be filed within a specific state or country, or it may require that a case be filed in a specific court. For example, a choice of forum clause may require that a case be filed in the U.S. State of California, or it may require more specifically that the case be filed in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County.\n\nA choice of law or venue is not necessarily binding upon a court. Based upon an analysis of the laws, rules of procedure and public policy of the state and court in which the case was filed, a court that is identified by the clause may find that it should not exercise jurisdiction, or a court in a different jurisdiction or venue may find that the litigation may proceed despite the clause.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://guides.lib.monash.edu/commercial-law/contract-law|title=Commercial law: Contract law|last=|first=|date=|website=Monash University|access-date=}}</ref> As part of that analysis, a court may examine whether the clause conforms with the formal requirements of the jurisdiction in which the case was filed (in some jurisdictions a choice of forum or choice of venue clause only limits the parties if the word \"exclusive\" is explicitly included in the clause). Some jurisdictions will not accept an action that has no connection to the court that was chosen, and others will not enforce a choice of venue clause when they consider themselves to be a more [[forum non conveniens|convenient forum]] for the litigation.<ref>See, e.g., {{cite journal|last1=Mullenix|first1=Linda A.|title=Another Choice of Forum, Another Choice of Law: Consensual Adjudicatory Procedure in Federal Court|journal=Fordham Law Review|date=1988|volume=57|page=291|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/flr57&div=20&id=&page=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome contracts are governed by multilateral instruments that require a non-chosen court to dismiss cases and require the recognition of judgments made by courts having jurisdiction based on a choice of court clause. For example, the [[Brussels regime]] instruments (31 European states) and the [[Hague Choice of Court Agreements Convention]] (European Union, Mexico, Montenegro, Singapore), as well as several instruments related to a specific area of law, may require courts to enforce and recognize choice of law clauses and foreign judgments.\n\n===Remedies===\n{{Main|Breach of contract}}\nIn the United Kingdom, breach of contract is defined in the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]] as:  [i] non-performance, [ ii] poor performance, [iii] part-performance, or [iv] performance which is substantially different from what was reasonably expected.  Innocent parties may repudiate (cancel) the contract only for a major breach (breach of condition),<ref>[[Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd]] [1962] 1 All ER 474; see also {{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1951|litigants=Associated Newspapers Ltd v Bancks |parallelcite=(1951) 83 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 322 |courtname=auto}}.</ref><ref>The Mihailis Angelos [1971] 1 QB 164</ref> but they may always recover compensatory damages, provided that the breach has caused foreseeable loss.\n\nIt was not possible to sue [[the Crown]] in the UK for breach of contract before 1948. However, it was appreciated that contractors might be reluctant to deal on such a basis and claims were entertained under a [[petition of right]] that needed to be endorsed by the [[Home Secretary]] and [[Attorney-General]]. S.1 [[Crown Proceedings Act 1947]] opened the Crown to ordinary contractual claims through the courts as for any other person.\n\n====Damages====\n{{Main|Damages}}\nThere are several different types of damages.\n*Compensatory damages, which are given to the party injured by the breach of contract. With compensatory damages, there are two [[heads of loss]], consequential damage and direct damage. In theory, compensatory damages are designed to put the injured party in his or her rightful position, usually through an award of expectation damages.\n*Liquidated damages are an estimate of loss agreed to in the contract, so that the court avoids calculating compensatory damages and the parties have greater certainty. Liquidated damages clauses may be called \"penalty clauses\" in ordinary language, but the law distinguishes between liquidated damages (legitimate) and penalties (invalid). A test for determining which category a clause falls into was established by the English House of Lords in ''[[Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage & Motor Co Ltd]]''<ref>{{cite BAILII |year=1914 |court=UKHL |num=1 |litigants=[[Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage & Motor Co Ltd]] |parallelcite=[1915] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 79 at 86 per Lord Dunedin |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n*Nominal damages consist of a small cash amount where the court concludes that the defendant is in breach but the plaintiff has suffered no quantifiable pecuniary loss, and may be sought to obtain a legal record of who was at fault.\n*Punitive or exemplary damages are used to punish the party at fault; but even though such damages are not intended primarily to compensate, nevertheless the claimant (and not the state) receives the award.  Exemplary damages are not recognised nor permitted in some jurisdictions.  In the UK, exemplary damages are not available for breach of contract, but are possible after fraud.  Although vitiating factors (such as misrepresentation, mistake, undue influence and duress) relate to contracts, they are not contractual actions, and so, in a roundabout way, a claimant in contract may be able to get exemplary damages.\n\nCompensatory damages compensate the plaintiff for actual losses suffered as accurately as possible.  They may be \"expectation damages\", \"reliance damages\" or \"[[restitution]]ary damages\".  Expectation damages are awarded to put the party in as good of a position as the party would have been in had the contract been performed as promised.<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|36|1954|litigants=Bellgrove v Eldridge |parallelcite=(1954) 90 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 613 |date=20 August 1954 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>  Reliance damages are usually awarded where no reasonably reliable estimate of expectation loss can be arrived at or at the option of the plaintiff. Reliance losses cover expense suffered in reliance to the promise. Examples where reliance damages have been awarded because profits are too speculative include the Australian case of ''[[McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission]]''<ref name=\"McRae v Commonwealth\"/> which concerned a contract for the rights to salvage a ship. In ''Anglia Television Ltd v. Reed''<ref>[1972] 1 QB 60</ref> the English Court of Appeal awarded the plaintiff expenditures incurred prior to the contract in preparation of performance.\n\nAfter a breach has occurred, the innocent party has a duty to mitigate loss by taking any reasonable steps.  Failure to mitigate means that damages may be reduced or even denied altogether.<ref>The [[Uniform Commercial Code|UCC]] states, \"Consequential damages... include any loss... which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise.\" UCC 2-715.In English law the chief authority on mitigation is ''British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co v Underground Electric Railway Co of London''[1912] AC 673, see especially 689 per Lord Haldane.</ref> However, Professor Michael Furmston <ref>M.P. Furmston, ''Cheshire, Fifoot & Furmston's Law of Contract'', 15th edn (OUP: Oxford, 2007) p.779.</ref> has argued that \"it is wrong to express (the mitigation) rule by stating that the plaintiff is under a duty to mitigate his loss\",<ref>M.P. Furmston, ''Cheshire, Fifoot & Furmston's Law of Contract'', 15th edn (OUP: Oxford, 2007) p.779 n.130.</ref> citing ''Sotiros Shipping Inc v Sameiet, The Solholt''.<ref>''Sotiros Shipping Inc v Sameiet, The Solholt'' [1983] 1 Lloyd's Rep 605.</ref> If a party provides notice that the contract will not be completed, an [[anticipatory breach]] occurs.\n\nDamages may be general or consequential. General damages are those damages which naturally flow from a breach of contract. Consequential damages are those damages which, although not naturally flowing from a breach, are naturally supposed by both parties at the time of contract formation. An example would be when someone rents a car to get to a business meeting, but when that person arrives to pick up the car, it is not there. General damages would be the cost of renting a different car. Consequential damages would be the lost business if that person was unable to get to the meeting, if both parties knew the reason the party was renting the car. However, there is still a duty to mitigate the losses. The fact that the car was not there does not give the party a right to not attempt to rent another car.\n\nTo recover damages, a claimant must show that the breach of contract caused foreseeable loss.<ref name=\"Hadley v Baxendale\"/><ref>See also ''Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corp Ltd'' (1987) 9 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 310.</ref> ''[[Hadley v Baxendale]]'' established that the test of foreseeability is both objective or subjective.  In other words, is it foreseeable to the objective bystander, or to the contracting parties, who may have special knowledge?  On the facts of this case, where a miller lost production because a carrier delayed taking broken mill parts for repair, the court held that no damages were payable since the loss was foreseeable neither by the \"reasonable man\" nor by the carrier, both of whom would have expected the miller to have a spare part in store.\n\n====Specific performance====\n{{Main|Specific performance}}\nThere may be circumstances in which it would be unjust to permit the defaulting party simply to buy out the injured party with damages. For example, where an art collector purchases a rare painting and the vendor refuses to deliver, the collector's damages would be equal to the sum paid.\n\nThe court may make an order of what is called \"specific performance\", requiring that the contract be performed. In some circumstances a court will order a party to perform his or her promise (an order of \"[[specific performance]]\") or issue an order, known as an \"injunction\", that a party refrain from doing something that would breach the contract. A specific performance is obtainable for the breach of a contract to sell land or real estate on such grounds that the property has a unique value. In the [[United States]] by way of the [[13th Amendment to the United States Constitution]], specific performance in personal service contracts is only legal \"''as punishment for a crime whereof the criminal shall be dully convicted''.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution | url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxiii.html | accessdate = 2008-10-10}}</ref>\n\nBoth an order for specific performance and an injunction are discretionary remedies, originating for the most part in [[Equity (law)|equity]]. Neither is available as of right and in most jurisdictions and most circumstances a court will not normally order specific performance. A contract for the sale of real property is a notable exception. In most jurisdictions, the sale of real property is enforceable by specific performance. Even in this case the defenses to an action in equity (such as [[Laches (equity)|laches]], the ''bona fide'' purchaser rule, or [[unclean hands]]) may act as a bar to specific performance.\n\nRelated to orders for specific performance, an injunction may be requested when the contract prohibits a certain action. Action for injunction would prohibit the person from performing the act specified in the contract.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of contract law|Roman law}}\n\nWhilst early rules of trade and barter have existed since ancient times, modern laws of contract in the West are traceable from the industrial revolution (1750 onwards), when increasing numbers worked in factories for a cash wage.  In particular, the growing strength of the British economy and the adaptability and flexibility of the [[English law|English common law]] led to a swift development of English<ref>as opposed to Scottish law</ref> contract law, while the more rigid civil law in Europe lagged behind.<ref>In 1789, while the French were engaged in their revolution, the English law was busying itself in defining the rules of auctions: see [[Payne v Cave]]</ref> Colonies within the British empire (including the [[United States|USA]] and [[Dominion|the Dominions]]) would [[Reception statute|adopt the law]] of the mother country.  Civil law countries (especially Germany) later developed their own brand of contract law.  In the 20th century, the growth of export trade led to countries adopting international conventions, such as the [[Hague-Visby Rules]] and the [[United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods|UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods]],<ref>Willmott, L, Christensen, S, Butler, D, & Dixon, B 2009 ''Contract Law'', Third Edition, Oxford University Press, North Melbourne</ref> to promote uniform regulations.\n\n[[File:Bill of sale Louvre AO3765.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Bill of sale]] of a male slave and a building in Shuruppak, [[Sumer]]ian tablet, circa 2600 BC]]\nContract law is based on the principle expressed in the [[Latin]] phrase ''[[pacta sunt servanda]],'' ( \"agreements must be kept\").<ref>[[Hans Wehberg]], ''[[Pacta Sunt Servanda]],'' [[The American Journal of International Law]], Vol. 53, No. 4 (Oct., 1959), [http://www.trans-lex.org/129500 p.775.]; Trans-Lex.org [http://www.trans-lex.org/919000 Principle of Sanctity of contracts]</ref> The common law of contract originated with the now-defuct writ of [[assumpsit]], which was originally a [[tort]] action based on reliance.<ref>Atiyah PS.

In common law jurisdictions such as  England and the United States, a high degree of freedom is the norm. For example, in [[Law of the United States|American law]], it was determined in the 1901 case of ''[[Hurley v. Eddingfield]]'' that a physician was permitted to deny treatment to a patient despite the lack of other available medical assistance and the patient's subsequent death.<ref>Blake V. (2012). [http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2012/05/hlaw1-1205.html When Is a Patient-Physician Relationship Established?]. ''Virtual Mentor''.</ref> This is in contrast to the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], which typically applies certain overarching principles to disputes arising out of contract, as in the [[French Civil Code]]. Other legal systems such as Islamic law, socialist legal systems, and customary law have their own variations.\n\nHowever, in both the [[European union]] and the United States, the need to prevent discrimination has eroded the full extent of freedom of contract. Legislation governing equality, equal pay, racial discrimination, disability discrimination and so on, has imposed limits of the full freedom of contract.<ref name=Bernstein/> For example, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] restricted private racial discrimination against African-Americans.<ref>Douglas D. (2002). [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&context=facpubs Contract Rights and Civil Rights]. ''Michigan Law Review''.</ref> In the early 20th century, the United States underwent the \"[[Lochner era]]\", in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] struck down economic regulations on the basis of freedom of contract and the [[Due Process Clause]]; these decisions were eventually overturned, and the Supreme Court established a deference to legislative statutes and regulations that restrict freedom of contract.<ref name=Bernstein>Bernstein DE. (2008). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1239749 Freedom of Contract]. George Mason Law & Economics Research Paper No. 08-51.</ref> The US Constitution contains a [[Contract Clause]], but this has been interpreted as only restricting the retroactive impairment of contracts.<ref name=Bernstein/>\n\n==Commercial use==\nContracts are widely used in [[commercial law]], and form the legal foundation for transactions across the world. Common examples include [[contract of sale|contracts for the sale]] of [[professional service|services]] and goods (both wholesale and retail), [[construction law|construction contracts]], [[Contract of carriage|contracts of carriage]], [[software license]]s, [[employment contract]]s, [[insurance policy|insurance policies]], sale or lease of land, and various other uses.\n\nAlthough the [[European Union]] is fundamentally an economic community with a range of trade rules, there is no overarching \"EU Law of Contract\". In 1993, [[Harvey McGregor]], a British barrister and academic, produced a \"Contract Code\" under the auspices of the English and Scottish [[Law Commission]]s, which was a proposal to both unify and codify the contract laws of England and Scotland. This document was offered as a possible \"Contract Code for Europe\", but tensions between English and German jurists meant that this proposal has so far come to naught.<ref>... indeed the Code was neither published nor adopted by the UK, instead being privately published by an Italian University</ref>\n\n==Contract theory==\nContract theory is the body of legal theory that addresses normative and conceptual questions in contract law. One of the most important questions asked in contract theory is why contracts are enforced. One prominent answer to this question focuses on the economic benefits of enforcing bargains. Another approach, associated with [[Charles Fried]], maintains that the purpose of contract law is to enforce promises. This theory is developed in Fried's book, ''Contract as Promise.'' Other approaches to contract theory are found in the writings of [[legal realism|legal realists]] and [[critical legal studies]] theorists.\n\nMore generally, writers have propounded [[Marxist]] and feminist interpretations of contract.  Attempts at overarching understandings of the purpose and nature of contract as a phenomenon have been made, notably [[Relational contract|relational contract theory]] originally developed by U.S. contracts scholars [[Ian Roderick Macneil]] and Stewart Macaulay, building at least in part on the contract theory work of U.S. scholar [[Lon L. Fuller]], while U.S. scholars have been at the forefront of developing economic theories of contract focussing on questions of [[transaction cost]] and so-called '[[efficient breach]]' theory.\n\nAnother dimension of the theoretical debate in contract is its place within, and relationship to a wider [[law of obligations]]. Obligations have traditionally been divided into contracts, which are voluntarily undertaken and owed to a specific person or persons, and obligations in [[tort]] which are based on the wrongful infliction of harm to certain protected interests, primarily imposed by the law, and typically owed to a wider class of persons.\n\nRecently it has been accepted that there is a third category, restitutionary obligations, based on the [[unjust enrichment]] of the defendant at the plaintiff's expense. Contractual liability, reflecting the constitutive function of contract, is generally for failing to make things better (by not rendering the expected performance), liability in tort is generally for action (as opposed to omission) making things worse, and liability in restitution is for unjustly taking or retaining the benefit of the plaintiff's money or work.<ref>Beatson, ''Anson's Law of Contract'' (1998) 27th ed. OUP, p.21</ref>\n\nThe common law describes the circumstances under which the law will recognise the existence of rights, privilege or power arising out of a promise.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Chinese Slave trade.jpg|A contract from the [[Tang dynasty]] that records the purchase of a 15-year-old slave for six bolts of plain silk and five Chinese coins\nFile:Heiratsbrief Gottfried Werner von Zimmern Apollonia von Henneberg 1521 img02.jpg|German marriage contract, 1521 between {{Interlanguage link multi|Gottfried Werner von Zimmern|de}} and Apollonia von Henneberg-R\u00f6mhild\nFile:Insurance Contact 2.jpg|[[Thomas Boylston]] to [[Thomas Jefferson]], May 1786, Maritime Insurance Premiums\nFile:Insurance contract.jpg|[[Fire insurance]] contract of 1796\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==<!-- Please respect alphabetical order -->\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Arbitration clause]]\n*[[Bill of sale]]\n*[[Conflict of contract laws]]\n*[[Contract awarding]]\n*[[Contract farming]]\n*[[Contract management]]\n*[[Contract of sale]]\n*[[Contract theory]] (economics)\n*[[Wikt:contracting|Contracting]]\n*[[:Category:Contract clauses|Contractual clauses]] (category)\n*[[Design by contract]]\n*[[Document automation]]\n*[[Electronic signature]]\n*[[Estoppel]]\n*[[Ethical implications in contracts]]\n*[[Force majeure]]\n*[[Further assurances]]\n*[[Gentlemen's agreement]]\n*[[Good faith]]\n*[[Implicit contract theory|Implicit contract]]\n*[[Indenture]]\n*[[Information asymmetry]]\n*[[Invitation to treat]]\n*[[Legal remedy]]\n*[[Letters of assist]]\n*[[Meet-or-release contract]]\n*[[Memorandum of understanding]]\n*[[Negotiation]]\n*[[Option contract]]\n*[[Order (business)]]\n*[[Peppercorn (legal)]]\n*[[Perfect tender rule]]\n*[[Principal\u2013agent problem]]\n*[[Quasi-contract]]\n*[[Restitution]]\n*[[Smart contract]]\n*[[Social contract]]\n*[[Specification (technical standard)]]\n*[[Standard form contract]]\n*[[Stipulation]]\n*[[Tortious interference]]\n*[[Unjust enrichment]]\n*[[Voidable contract]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===By country===\n{{div col|colwidth=50em}}\n*[[Australian contract law]]\n*[[Sharia]]\n*[[Law of obligations (Bulgaria)]]\n*[[English contract law]]\n*[[German contract law]]\n*[[Indian contract law]]\n*[[South African contract law]]\n*[[United States contract law]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Library resources box}}\n*Ewan McKendrick, ''Contract Law - Text, Cases and Materials'' (2005) Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-927480-0}}\n*P.S.

Many Cuban expatriates have followed family and friends to the U.S. and built a \"Second Havana\" in Miami.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Makeup of the lobby==\nThe Cuban-American lobby is usually seen to be anti-Castro and recognizing the Cuban government as repressive, although it has become much more moderate since the late 1990s. However, the most influential organizations and politicians within the political sector of the lobby are still conservative. They advocate for punitive maintenance of the embargo.

Less influential organizations advocate for an easing or lifting of the embargo before or regardless of whether Cuba changes its government structure and policies.\n\nThe academic circles within the lobby, though not monolithic in opinion, generally believe that the U.S. and Cuba should more readily exchange scientific information and advances. Some organizations within the intellectual wing of the Cuba lobby advocate for travel as a human right, and have affected change on U.S. travel policies towards Cuba.<ref name=\"Horowitz\">https://{{cite journal |last1=Horowitz |first1=Irving Louis |date=Autumn 1998 |title=The Cuba Lobby Then and Now |journal=Orbis |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=553\u2013563 |doi=10.1016/S0030-4387(98)80005-7 }}</ref>\n\nBusiness interest lobbies often advocate for lifting the embargo so as to increase trade between the two nations. They believe trade with Cuba would be beneficial for the U.S. economy, and usually point more to financial than humanitarian reasons for their stance.<ref name=\"Horowitz\"/> Lobbies outside the Cuban-American community have also advocated for liberalization of trade between the two nations, most notably the agribusiness lobby.<ref name=\"Canberk\"/>\n\n==Political influence==\nIn the 1980s, most Cuban expatriate interest groups were only active in southern Florida. These groups were splintered and their voice was poorly organized. The lobby became more powerful after many organizations pledged to change the inner workings of Cuban government, as powers within the U.S. government shared the same objective. The [[Reagan administration]] strongly supported the [[Cuban American National Foundation]] (CANF), which formed the month the president took office.<ref name=\"Haney\"/> The lobby built institutional ties with the administration through their ideological sameness, giving conservative Cuban-American groups growing influence and increasingly early access to information through the 1980s.<br>Organizations within the lobby have affected public policy by collaborating with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers. One of the most notable collaborations occurred in 1992 between the Cuban American National Foundation and Democrat [[Robert Torricelli]]. Torricelli, whose liberal views on the embargo characterized his early career, sought election campaign funds from the CANF. He adopted a stronger anti-Castro, pro-embargo stance, secured CANF funds, and was reelected to Congress.<ref name=Canberk/> Torricelli subsequently sponsored the [[Cuban Democracy Act]], often referred to as the Torricelli Act, which was signed into law by [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992.\n\nThe conservative lobby\u2019s influence waned when [[Jorge Mas Canosa]], founder of the Cuban American National Foundation, died in 1997. The international custody case of [[Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez]], which lasted from November 1999 to June 2000, also had negative effects on conservative influence within the Cuban-American community.

The group constituting this exodus was young and much more moderate than earlier groups. This demographic is one of the most geographically concentrated of immigrant groups in the United States. Many Cuban expatriates have followed family and friends to the U.S. and built a \"Second Havana\" in Miami.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Makeup of the lobby==\nThe Cuban-American lobby is usually seen to be anti-Castro and recognizing the Cuban government as repressive, although it has become much more moderate since the late 1990s. However, the most influential organizations and politicians within the political sector of the lobby are still conservative. They advocate for punitive maintenance of the embargo. It should be lifted, then, only if Cuba moves toward democratization and greater respect for human rights, shifts towards a more capitalist economy and makes strides in economic privatization.<ref name=\"Haney\">{{cite journal |last1=Haney |first1=Patrick J. |date=June 1999 |title=The Role of Ethnic Interest Groups in U.S. Foreign Policy: The Case of the Cuban American National Foundation\n |jstor=2600759|journal=International Studies Quarterly |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=341\u2013361 |doi= 10.1111/0020-8833.00123}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/www/regions/wha/cuba/democ_act_1945.html |title= Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 |publisher= U.S. Department of State |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120805204524/http://www.state.gov/www/regions/wha/cuba/democ_act_1992.html |archivedate= August 5, 2012 }} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/895774495 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/895774135 cite #3 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template.

Less influential organizations advocate for an easing or lifting of the embargo before or regardless of whether Cuba changes its government structure and policies.\n\nThe academic circles within the lobby, though not monolithic in opinion, generally believe that the U.S. and Cuba should more readily exchange scientific information and advances. Some organizations within the intellectual wing of the Cuba lobby advocate for travel as a human right, and have affected change on U.S. travel policies towards Cuba.<ref name=\"Horowitz\">https://{{cite journal |last1=Horowitz |first1=Irving Louis |date=Autumn 1998 |title=The Cuba Lobby Then and Now |journal=Orbis |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=553\u2013563 |doi=10.1016/S0030-4387(98)80005-7 }}</ref>\n\nBusiness interest lobbies often advocate for lifting the embargo so as to increase trade between the two nations. They believe trade with Cuba would be beneficial for the U.S. economy, and usually point more to financial than humanitarian reasons for their stance.<ref name=\"Horowitz\"/> Lobbies outside the Cuban-American community have also advocated for liberalization of trade between the two nations, most notably the agribusiness lobby.<ref name=\"Canberk\"/>\n\n==Political influence==\nIn the 1980s, most Cuban expatriate interest groups were only active in southern Florida. These groups were splintered and their voice was poorly organized. The lobby became more powerful after many organizations pledged to change the inner workings of Cuban government, as powers within the U.S. government shared the same objective. The [[Reagan administration]] strongly supported the [[Cuban American National Foundation]] (CANF), which formed the month the president took office.<ref name=\"Haney\"/> The lobby built institutional ties with the administration through their ideological sameness, giving conservative Cuban-American groups growing influence and increasingly early access to information through the 1980s.<br>Organizations within the lobby have affected public policy by collaborating with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers. One of the most notable collaborations occurred in 1992 between the Cuban American National Foundation and Democrat [[Robert Torricelli]]. Torricelli, whose liberal views on the embargo characterized his early career, sought election campaign funds from the CANF. He adopted a stronger anti-Castro, pro-embargo stance, secured CANF funds, and was reelected to Congress.<ref name=Canberk/> Torricelli subsequently sponsored the [[Cuban Democracy Act]], often referred to as the Torricelli Act, which was signed into law by [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992.\n\nThe conservative lobby\u2019s influence waned when [[Jorge Mas Canosa]], founder of the Cuban American National Foundation, died in 1997. The international custody case of [[Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez]], which lasted from November 1999 to June 2000, also had negative effects on conservative influence within the Cuban-American community. The rise of moderate and liberal influence within the community are often partially attributed to Canosa\u2019s death and Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s repatriation into Cuba.<ref name=Canberk/><br>While still influential, the Cuba lobby appears to be weakening due to dissenting opinions within groups.<ref name=\"Lindsay\">{{cite web\n |url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/getting-uncle-sams-ear-will-ethnic-lobbies-cramp-americas-foreign-policy-style/\n |title=Getting Uncle Sam's Ear: Will Ethnic Lobbies Cramp America's Foreign Policy Style\n |last=Lindsay\n |first=James M.\n |date=December 2002\n |website=Brookings.edu\n |publisher=Brookings\n |access-date=February 10, 2018\n |quote= }}/</ref> Younger Cuban-Americans are more likely to be open-minded regarding relations between the two countries and the lifting of the embargo.\n\nRising influence of moderate voices allowed room for the agribusiness lobby to push for reforms that softened the embargo.

Also, brick and mortar casinos are reluctant to promote poker because it is difficult for them to profit from it. Though the [[Rake (poker)|rake]], or time charge, of traditional casinos is often high, the [[opportunity cost]]s of running a poker room are even higher. Brick and mortar casinos often make much more money by removing poker rooms and adding more [[slot machine]]s. For example, figures from the Gaming Accounting Firm [[Joseph Eve, Certified Public Accountants|Joseph Eve]] estimate that poker accounts for 1% of brick and mortar casino revenues.<ref name=Joseph /> [[File:PokerTableOpenSource.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Screenshot of [[open-source]] [[PokerTH]] table]]\n\nOnline venues, by contrast, are dramatically cheaper because they have much smaller overhead costs. For example, adding another table does not take up valuable space like it would for a brick and mortar casino. Online poker rooms also allow the players to play for low stakes (as low as 1\u00a2/2\u00a2) and often offer poker [[Freeroll (poker)|freeroll]] tournaments (where there is no entry fee), attracting beginners and/or less wealthy clientele.\n\nOnline venues may be more vulnerable to certain types of [[fraud]], especially [[collusion]] between players. However, they have collusion detection abilities that do not exist in brick and mortar casinos. For example, online poker room security employees can look at the [[hand history]] of the cards previously played by any player on the site, making patterns of behavior easier to detect than in a casino where colluding players can simply fold their hands without anyone ever knowing the strength of their holding. Online poker rooms also check players' [[IP address]]es in order to prevent players at the same household or at known [[open proxy]] servers from playing on the same tables. Digital [[device fingerprinting]] also allows poker sites to recognize and block players who create new accounts in attempts to circumvent prior account bans, restrictions and closures.\n\n== History ==\nFree poker online was played as early as the late 1990s in the form of [[IRC poker]]. [[Planet Poker]] was the first online card room to offer real money games in 1998. The first real money poker game was dealt on January 1, 1998. Author [[Mike Caro]] became the \"face\" of Planet Poker in October 1999.\n\nThe major online poker sites offer varying features to entice new players. One common feature is to offer tournaments called satellites by which the winners gain entry to real-life poker tournaments. It was through one such tournament on [[PokerStars]] that [[Chris Moneymaker]] won his entry to the [[2003 World Series of Poker]]. He went on to win the main event, causing shock in the poker world, and beginning the [[poker boom]]. The 2004 World Series featured three times as many players as in 2003. At least four players in the WSOP final table won their entry through an online cardroom. Like Moneymaker, 2004 winner [[Greg Raymer]] also won his entry at the [[PokerStars]] online cardroom.\n\nIn October 2004, [[Sportingbet]], at the time the world's largest publicly traded online gaming company (SBT.L), announced the acquisition of [[Sportingbet|ParadisePoker.com]], one of the online poker industry's first and largest cardrooms. The $340 million acquisition marked the first time an online card room was owned by a public company. Since then, several other card room parent companies have gone public.\n\nIn June 2005, [[PartyGaming]], the parent company of the then-largest online cardroom, PartyPoker, went public on the [[London Stock Exchange]], achieving an [[initial public offering]] market value in excess of $8 billion. At the time of the IPO, ninety-two percent of Party Gaming's income came from poker operations.\n\nIn early 2006, PartyGaming moved to acquire EmpirePoker.com from [[Empire Online]]. Later in the year, [[bwin]], an Austrian-based online gambling company, acquired PokerRoom.com. Other poker rooms such as [[PokerStars]] that were rumored to be exploring initial public offerings have postponed them.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2095-2136074,00.html Pokerstars reveals hand with plans for \u00a31bn float] [[The Times]]</ref>\n\nAs of March 2008, there are fewer than forty stand-alone cardrooms and poker networks with detectable levels of traffic.

The pandemic is believed to have directed both professional and recreational players who normally prefer live poker to online platforms due the indefinite closure of most casinos and other live gaming venues worldwide, with even many [[Underground poker|unlicensed venues]] shutting down. In addition, the sudden dearth of live entertainment options due to the widespread disruption of the sports and entertainment schedules around the world is believed to have resulted in more than the usual number of casual players turning to online poker as an alternative. Many operators reported traffic of double or more the previous volume, depending on the time of day.\n\n==Legality==\nFrom a legal perspective, online poker may differ in some ways from online casino gambling. However, many of the same issues do apply. For a discussion of the legality of online gambling in general, see [[online gambling]].\n\nOnline poker is legal and regulated in many countries including several nations in and around the [[Caribbean Sea]], and most notably the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, the [[North Dakota]] House of Representatives passed a bill in February 2005 to legalize and regulate online poker and online poker card room operators in the state. The legislation required that online poker operations would have to physically locate their entire operations in the state. Testifying before the state Senate Judiciary committee, Nigel Payne, CEO of Sportingbet and owner of Paradise Poker, pledged to relocate to the state if the bill became law.<ref>{{cite web |first=Tom |last=Rafferty |url=http://www.bismarcktribune.com/articles/2005/03/09/news/topnews/top01.txt |title=Bismarck Tribune |publisher=Bismarck Tribune |date=2005-03-08 |accessdate=2009-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060408122500/http://www.bismarcktribune.com/articles/2005/03/09/news/topnews/top01.txt |archivedate=2006-04-08 }}</ref>\n\nThe measure, however, was defeated by the State Senate in March 2005 after the U.S. Department of Justice sent a letter to North Dakota attorney general [[Wayne Stenehjem]] stating that online gaming \"may\" be illegal, and that the pending legislation \"might\" violate the federal [[Federal Wire Act|Wire Act]]. However, many legal experts [[Online gambling#General legal issues|dispute the DOJ's claim]].\n\nIn response to this and other claims by the DOJ regarding the legality of online poker, many of the major online poker sites stopped advertising their \"dot-com\" sites in American media. Instead, they created \"dot-net\" sites that are virtually identical but offer no real money wagering. The sites advertise as poker schools or ways to learn the game for free, and feature words to the effect of \"this is not a gambling website.\"\n\nOn October 13, 2006, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] officially signed into law the [[SAFE Port Act]], a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] aimed at enhancing security at U.S. ports.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/business/2006/10/13/safe-ports-act-biz-logistics-cx_rm_1013ports.html |title=Bush Signs Safe Port Act |publisher=Forbes |date=2006-10-13 |accessdate=2009-03-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018043515/http://www.forbes.com/business/2006/10/13/safe-ports-act-biz-logistics-cx_rm_1013ports.html|archivedate=2006-10-18}}</ref> Attached to the Safe Port Act was a provision known as the [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006]] (UIGEA). According to the UIGEA, \"unlawful internet gambling\" means to place, receive, or otherwise knowingly transmit a bet or wager by means of the internet where such bet is unlawful under any law in the State in which the bet is initiated, received, or otherwise made. Thus, the UIGEA prohibits online gambling sites from performing transactions with American financial institutions. As a result of the bill, several large publicly traded poker gaming sites such as [[PartyPoker]], [[Cassava Enterprises|PacificPoker]] and [[bwin]] closed down their US-facing operations.

First, there is the [[rake (poker)|rake]]. Similar to the [[Vigorish|vig]] paid to a [[Bookmaker|bookie]], the rake is a fee paid to the [[Casino|house]] for hosting the game. Rake is collected from most real money [[Cash game|ring game]] pots. The rake is normally calculated as a percentage of the pot based on a sliding scale and capped at some maximum fee. Each online poker room determines its own rake structure. Since the expenses for running an online poker table are smaller than those for running a live poker table, rake in most online poker rooms is much smaller than its brick and mortar counterpart.\n\nSecond, hands played in pre-scheduled multi-table and impromptu [[sit and go|sit-and-go]] [[poker tournament|tournaments]] are not raked, but rather an entry fee around five to ten percent of the tournament buy-in is added to the entry cost of the tournament. These two are usually specified in the tournament details as, e.g., $20+$2 ($20 represents the buy-in that goes into the prize pool and $2 represents the entry fee, de facto rake). Unlike real casino tournaments, online tournaments do not deduct dealer tips and other expenses from the prize pool.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thedailypoker.com/online-poker/how-online-poker-rooms-profit/ | title=How online poker rooms profit? | publisher=The Daily Poker |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205065713/http://www.thedailypoker.com/online-poker/how-online-poker-rooms-profit/|archive-date=2008-12-05 |access-date=2017-02-13 }}</ref>\n\nThird, some online poker sites also offer side games like [[blackjack]], [[roulettes]], or side bets on poker hands where the player plays against \"the house\" for real money.<ref>{{cite web|title=Side Games|url=http://www.mergegaming.com/side-games.html|publisher=Merge Gaming|accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref> The odds are in the house's favor in these games, thus producing a profit for the house. Some sites go as far as getting affiliated with [[online casino]]s, or even integrating them into the poker room software.\n\nFourth, like almost all institutions that hold money, online poker sites invest the money that players deposit. Regulations in most jurisdictions exist in an effort to limit the sort of risks sites can take with their clients' money. However, since the sites do not have to pay interest on players' bankrolls even low-risk investments can be a significant source of revenue.\n\n==Integrity and fairness==\n===Randomness of the shuffle===\nMany critics question whether the operators of such games - especially those located in jurisdictions separate from most of their players - might be engaging in fraud themselves.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pokernews.com/news/2013/11/todd-witteles-discusses-poker-fraud-alert-cheating-more-16878.htm | title=Todd \"DanDruff\" Witteles Discusses PokerFraudAlert, Cheating in Poker & Much More | publisher=Pokernews | date=26 November 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2014 | author=Holloway, Chad}}</ref>\n\nInternet discussion forums are rife with allegations of non-random card dealing, possibly to favour house-employed players or \"[[computer game bot|bot]]s\" (poker-playing software disguised as a human opponent), or to give multiple players good hands thus increasing the bets and the rake, or simply to prevent new players from losing so quickly that they become discouraged. However, despite [[anecdotal evidence]] to support such claims, others argue that the rake is sufficiently large that such abuses would be unnecessary and foolish. Attempts at manipulative dealing could face a risk of third party detection due to increasingly sophisticated tracking software that could be used to detect any number of unusual patterns, though such analyses are not generally available in the public domain.\n\nMany players claim to see lots of \"bad beats\" with large hands pitted against others all too often at a rate that seems to be a lot more common than in live games. However, this could be caused by the higher hands per hour at on-line cardrooms. Since online players get to see more hands, their likelihood of seeing more improbable bad beats or randomly large pots is similarly increased.\n\nMany online poker sites are certified by major auditing firms like [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] to review the fairness of the [[random number generator]], [[shuffle]], and payouts for some sites.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENMVgzDt1MEC&pg=PA23|title=Winning at Internet Poker For Dummies|last=Harlan|first=Mark|last2=Derossi|first2=Chris|date=2011-04-27|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=|isbn=9781118070000|location=|pages=23|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Insider cheating===\nInsider [[cheating]] can occur when a person with trusted access to the system (e.g. an employee of the poker room) uses their position to play poker himself with an unfair advantage. This could be done without the knowledge of the site managers.\n\nPerhaps the first known major case came to light in October 2007, when [[Absolute Poker]] acknowledged that its integrity had been breached by an employee, who had been able to play at high stakes while viewing his opponents' hidden \"hole\" cards.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21381022 |title=Online poker cheating blamed on employee |publisher=NBC News |date=2007-10-19 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> The cheating was first brought to light by the efforts of players, whose saved histories of play showed the employee was playing as only someone who could see their opponents' cards could.<ref>{{cite web|last=Levitt |first=Steven D. |url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/how-not-to-cheat/ |title=How Not to Cheat - Freakonomics Blog - NYTimes.com |publisher=Freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2007-09-20 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, [[UltimateBet]] became embroiled in a similar scandal, with former employees accused of using a [[backdoor (computing)|software backdoor]] to see opponents' cards. UltimateBet confirmed the allegations on May 29.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26563848 |title=Poker site cheating plot a high-stakes whodunit |publisher=NBC News |date=2008-09-18 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> The [[Kahnawake Gaming Commission]] announced sanctions against UltimateBet as a result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokernews.com/news/2008/09/kahnawake-announces-ultimate-bet-sanctions.htm |title=Kahnawake Gaming Commission Announces Sanctions on UltimateBet: Russ Hamilton Named |publisher=Pokernews.com |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>\n\n===Collusion===\nMore mundane cheating involves collusion between players, or the use of multiple accounts by a single player. Collusion is not limited to online play but can occur in any poker game with three or more players. Most poker rooms claim to actively scan for such activity. For example, in 2007, [[PokerStars]] disqualified [[TheV0id]], the winner of the main event of the [[World Championship of Online Poker]] for breaching their terms of service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/2892-poker-stars-wcoop-main-event-winner-disqualified|title=Card Player Magazine |publisher=Cardplayer.com |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>\n\n==Differences compared with conventional poker==\nThere are substantial differences between online poker gaming and conventional, live gaming.\n\nOne obvious difference is that players do not sit right across from each other, removing any ability to observe others' reactions and [[body language]]. Instead, online poker players learn to focus more keenly on opponents' betting patterns, reaction time, speed of play, use of check boxes/auto plays, opponents' fold/flop percentages, chat box, waiting for the big blind, beginners' tells, and other behavior [[Tell (poker)|tells]] that are not physical in nature. Since poker is a game that requires adaptability, successful online players learn to master the new frontiers of their surroundings.\n\nAnother less obvious difference is the rate of play. In brick and mortar casinos the dealer has to collect the cards, shuffle, and deal them after every hand. Due to this and other delays common in offline casinos, the average rate of play is around thirty hands per hour. However, online casinos do not have these delays. The dealing and shuffling are instantaneous, there are no delays relating to counting chips (for a split pot), and on average the play is faster due to \"auto-action\" buttons (where the player selects his action before his turn). It is not uncommon for an online poker table to average ninety to one hundred hands per hour.\n\nThere are many ways in which online poker is considerably cheaper to play than conventional poker. While the rake structures of online poker sites might not differ fundamentally from those in brick and mortar operations, most of the other incidental expenses that are entailed by playing poker in a live room do not exist in online poker. An online poker player can play at home and thus incur no transportation costs to get to and from the poker room. Provided the player already has a somewhat modern computer and an Internet connection, there are no further up-front equipment costs to get started. There are also considerable incidental expenses once on a live poker table. In addition to the rake, [[gratuity|tipping]] the dealers, chip runners, servers and other casino employees is almost universally expected, putting a further drain on a player's profits. Also, whereas an online player can enter and leave tables almost as he pleases, once seated at a live table a player must remain there until he wishes to stop playing, or else go back to the bottom of the waiting list. [[Food]] and [[beverage]]s at casinos are generally expensive even compared to other hospitality establishments in the same city, let alone compared to at home, and casino managers feel little incentive to provide any complimentary food or drink for poker players.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nIn the brick and mortar casinos, the only real way a player can increase his earnings is to increase his limit, likely encountering better opponents in the process. In the online world, players have another option: play more tables. Unlike a traditional casino where it is physically impossible to play at more than one table at a time, most online poker rooms permit this. Depending on the site and the player's ability to make speedy decisions, a player might play several tables at the same time, viewing them each in a separate window on the computer display. For example, an average profit around $10 per 100 hands at a low-limit game is generally considered to be good play. In a casino, this would earn a player under $4 an hour. After dealer tips, the \"winning\" player would probably barely break even before any other incidental expenses. In an online poker room, a player with the same win rate playing a relatively easy pace of four tables at once at a relatively sluggish 60 hands per hour each earns about $24/hour on average. The main restriction limiting the number of tables a player can play is the need to make consistently good decisions within the allotted time at every table, but some online players can effectively play up to eight or more tables at once. This can not only increase winnings but can also help to keep a player's income reasonably stable, since instead of staking his entire bankroll on one higher limit table he is splitting his bankroll, wins and losses amongst many lower limit tables, probably also encountering somewhat less skilled opponents in the process.\n\nAnother important difference results from the fact that some online poker rooms offer online poker schools that teach the basics and significantly speed up the learning curve for novices. Many online poker rooms also provide free money play so that players may practice these skills in various poker games and limits without the risk of losing real money, and generally offer the hand history of played hands for analysis and discussion using a [[Poker tools|poker hand converter]]. People who previously had no way to learn and improve because they had no one to play with now have the ability to learn the game much quicker and gain experience from free-money play.\n\nThe limits associated with online poker range down to far lower levels than the [[table limit]]s at a traditional casino. The [[marginal cost]] of opening each online table is so minuscule that on some gambling sites players can find limits as low as $.01\u2013$.02. By comparison, at most brick and mortar establishments the lowest limits are often $1\u2013$2.\n\nFew (if any) online poker sites allow action to be taken \"in the [[Poker terms#D|dark]]\", while this is usually allowed and applied by players in real gaming houses. It is also not uncommon for online poker sites to not allow a player the option of showing their hand before folding if they are the giving up the pot to the last remaining bettor. This practice is also typically allowed in casinos.\n\n===Currency issues===\nOne issue exclusive to online poker is the fact that players come from around the world and deal in a variety of currencies. This is not an issue in live poker where everyone present can be expected to carry the local currency. Most online poker sites operate games exclusively in [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]], even if they do not accept players based in the United States. There are two methods by which poker sites can cater to players who do not deal with U.S. dollars on a regular basis.\n\nThe first method is to hold players' funds in their native currencies and convert them only when players enter and leave games. The main benefit of this method for players is to ensure that bankrolls are not subject to [[exchange rate]] fluctuations against their local currencies while they are not playing. Also, most sites that use this method usually apply the same exchange rate when a player cashes out of a game as when he bought in, ensuring that players do not expend significant sums simply by entering and leaving games.\n\nThe other method is to require players to convert their funds when depositing them. However, some sites that use this policy do accept payments in a variety of currencies and convert funds at a lower premium compared to what [[bank]]s and [[credit card]] companies would charge. Others only accept payment in U.S. dollars. One benefit of this method is that a player who constantly \"tops up\" his chip stack to a constant level (some poker rooms have an optional feature that can perform this function automatically) does not have to worry about rounding issues when topping up with a nominal sum \u2013 these could add up over time.\n\nPlayers may also make use of [[Digital wallet|ewallets]], virtual wallets that will allow players to store their funds online in the currency of their choice. This allows them to deposit at poker sites without worrying about further currency conversion.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pokerfuse.com/features/comment-analysis/ach-and-ewallets-provide-deposit-solutions-for-online-gaming-sites-in-new-jersey-05-12/ | title=ACH and eWallets Provide Deposit Solutions for Online Gaming Sites in New Jersey | publisher=Pokerfuse | date=5 December 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2014 | author=Gentile, Michael}}</ref>\n\nMany online poker sites, particularly those that serve the United States, began adopting [[cryptocurrencies]] in 2013 as a means of bypassing the [[UIGEA]]. The majority of these poker rooms accept deposits in [[Bitcoin]] and then convert them to U.S. dollars, performing this process in reverse when paying out winnings. There also exist cryptocurrency-only operators who denominate their games in Bitcoin or fractions of a bitcoin, avoiding [[fiat currencies]] entirely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://professionalrakeback.com/bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-provide-payment-processing-solutions-for-online-gaming-sites|title=Cryptocurrencies Provide New Processing Channels for Online Gambling Operators|author=Singh, Michael|publisher=ProfessionalRakeback|date=29 January 2017|accessdate=5 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Poker tools===\n{{main|Poker tools}}\nVarious types of useful [[poker tools|software applications]] are available for online play. Such tools include hand database programs that save, sort, and recall all hand histories played online. Scanning the active tables for known players and displaying previous statistics from hands with those players next to their name(known as a Heads up display or HUD) is a common feature of these programs and is allowed by most sites. Other programs include hand re-players and odds, equity or variance calculators. Some software goes as far as to provide you with quizzes, or scan your previously played hands and flag likely mistakes.\n\n==Bonuses==\nMany online poker sites offer incentives to players, especially new depositors, in the form of bonuses. Usually, the bonuses are paid out incrementally as certain amounts are raked by the player. For example, a site may offer a player who deposits $100 a bonus of $50 that awards $5 every time the player rakes $25. To earn the full $50 bonus sum, the player would have to [[Rake (poker)|rake]] $250 in total.\n\nIn addition, several online cardrooms have developed VIP programs to reward regular players. Poker rooms often offer additional bonuses for players who wish to top-up their accounts. These are known as reload bonuses.\n\nMany online rooms also offer [[rakeback]] and some offer poker propping.\n\nSee the [[Online casino#Bonuses|online casino]] article for more on general information on bonuses.\n\n== Compatibility ==\nOnline poker rooms typically operate through a separate piece of software. This may be cross-platform, for example using a [[Java applet]] or [[WebGL]], allowing the program to run equally well on various computer systems such as [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[macOS]]. However, many online poker rooms offer downloadable programs designed only for Microsoft Windows which require a compatibility layer such as [[Wine (software)|Wine]] to run on [[Macintosh]] or [[Linux]] computers. Some sites do make available clients that run natively on Mac or Linux.\n\nSome poker rooms have started offering poker on portable devices ([[mobile phone]]s, [[smart phone]]s, [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s). The functionality of mobile online poker software is much the same as computer-based clients, albeit adapted to the interface of mobile devices. The player must be able to receive a WiFi or cell phone signal in order to play.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Computer poker players]]\n*[[:Category:Poker companies|Poker companies]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n<!--========================({{No More Links}})============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

It has been partly responsible for a huge increase in the number of poker players worldwide. Christiansen Capital Advisors stated online poker revenues grew from $82.7 million in 2001 to $2.4 billion in 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/56438 |title=Going All In For Online Poker |publisher=Newsweek |date=2005-08-15 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> while a survey carried out by DrKW and Global Betting and Gaming Consultants asserted online poker revenues in 2004 were at $1.4 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto062720050064003754 |title=Financial Times: Online Poker 2004 revenues and 2008 forecast |publisher=Us.ft.com |date=2003-08-28 |accessdate=2009-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520074854/http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto062720050064003754 |archivedate=2009-05-20 }}</ref> In a testimony before the [[United States Senate]] regarding Internet Gaming, Grant Eve, a Certified Public Accountant representing the US Accounting Firm [[Joseph Eve, Certified Public Accountants]], estimated that one in every four dollars gambled is gambled online.<ref name=Joseph>{{cite web|last=Eve|first=Grant|title=Grant Eve Testimony 111711 - United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs|url=http://www.indian.senate.gov/hearings/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&pageid=9698|work=The Future of Internet Gaming|accessdate=11 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nTraditional (or \"[[brick and mortar]]\", B&M, live, land-based) venues for playing poker, such as [[casino]]s and poker rooms, may be intimidating for novice players and are often located in geographically disparate locations. Also, brick and mortar casinos are reluctant to promote poker because it is difficult for them to profit from it. Though the [[Rake (poker)|rake]], or time charge, of traditional casinos is often high, the [[opportunity cost]]s of running a poker room are even higher. Brick and mortar casinos often make much more money by removing poker rooms and adding more [[slot machine]]s. For example, figures from the Gaming Accounting Firm [[Joseph Eve, Certified Public Accountants|Joseph Eve]] estimate that poker accounts for 1% of brick and mortar casino revenues.<ref name=Joseph /> [[File:PokerTableOpenSource.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Screenshot of [[open-source]] [[PokerTH]] table]]\n\nOnline venues, by contrast, are dramatically cheaper because they have much smaller overhead costs. For example, adding another table does not take up valuable space like it would for a brick and mortar casino. Online poker rooms also allow the players to play for low stakes (as low as 1\u00a2/2\u00a2) and often offer poker [[Freeroll (poker)|freeroll]] tournaments (where there is no entry fee), attracting beginners and/or less wealthy clientele.\n\nOnline venues may be more vulnerable to certain types of [[fraud]], especially [[collusion]] between players. However, they have collusion detection abilities that do not exist in brick and mortar casinos. For example, online poker room security employees can look at the [[hand history]] of the cards previously played by any player on the site, making patterns of behavior easier to detect than in a casino where colluding players can simply fold their hands without anyone ever knowing the strength of their holding. Online poker rooms also check players' [[IP address]]es in order to prevent players at the same household or at known [[open proxy]] servers from playing on the same tables. Digital [[device fingerprinting]] also allows poker sites to recognize and block players who create new accounts in attempts to circumvent prior account bans, restrictions and closures.\n\n== History ==\nFree poker online was played as early as the late 1990s in the form of [[IRC poker]]. [[Planet Poker]] was the first online card room to offer real money games in 1998. The first real money poker game was dealt on January 1, 1998. Author [[Mike Caro]] became the \"face\" of Planet Poker in October 1999.\n\nThe major online poker sites offer varying features to entice new players. One common feature is to offer tournaments called satellites by which the winners gain entry to real-life poker tournaments. It was through one such tournament on [[PokerStars]] that [[Chris Moneymaker]] won his entry to the [[2003 World Series of Poker]]. He went on to win the main event, causing shock in the poker world, and beginning the [[poker boom]]. The 2004 World Series featured three times as many players as in 2003. At least four players in the WSOP final table won their entry through an online cardroom. Like Moneymaker, 2004 winner [[Greg Raymer]] also won his entry at the [[PokerStars]] online cardroom.\n\nIn October 2004, [[Sportingbet]], at the time the world's largest publicly traded online gaming company (SBT.L), announced the acquisition of [[Sportingbet|ParadisePoker.com]], one of the online poker industry's first and largest cardrooms. The $340 million acquisition marked the first time an online card room was owned by a public company. Since then, several other card room parent companies have gone public.\n\nIn June 2005, [[PartyGaming]], the parent company of the then-largest online cardroom, PartyPoker, went public on the [[London Stock Exchange]], achieving an [[initial public offering]] market value in excess of $8 billion. At the time of the IPO, ninety-two percent of Party Gaming's income came from poker operations.\n\nIn early 2006, PartyGaming moved to acquire EmpirePoker.com from [[Empire Online]]. Later in the year, [[bwin]], an Austrian-based online gambling company, acquired PokerRoom.com. Other poker rooms such as [[PokerStars]] that were rumored to be exploring initial public offerings have postponed them.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2095-2136074,00.html Pokerstars reveals hand with plans for \u00a31bn float] [[The Times]]</ref>\n\nAs of March 2008, there are fewer than forty stand-alone cardrooms and poker networks with detectable levels of traffic.

On the other hand, PokerStars paid $1 billion in fines immediately.\n\nIn 2014, PokerStars became the largest publicly traded company in the industry of poker when businessman David Baazov initiated a takeover bid costing $4.9 billion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrenheitner/2014/06/19/how-a-4-9-billion-purchase-of-pokerstars-could-change-online-poker-in-america/|title=How A $4.9 Billion Purchase Of PokerStars Could Change Online Poker In America|last=Heitner|first=Darren|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-06-11}}</ref>\n\nThe [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] has resulted in a massive increase in online poker traffic. The pandemic is believed to have directed both professional and recreational players who normally prefer live poker to online platforms due the indefinite closure of most casinos and other live gaming venues worldwide, with even many [[Underground poker|unlicensed venues]] shutting down. In addition, the sudden dearth of live entertainment options due to the widespread disruption of the sports and entertainment schedules around the world is believed to have resulted in more than the usual number of casual players turning to online poker as an alternative. Many operators reported traffic of double or more the previous volume, depending on the time of day.\n\n==Legality==\nFrom a legal perspective, online poker may differ in some ways from online casino gambling. However, many of the same issues do apply. For a discussion of the legality of online gambling in general, see [[online gambling]].\n\nOnline poker is legal and regulated in many countries including several nations in and around the [[Caribbean Sea]], and most notably the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, the [[North Dakota]] House of Representatives passed a bill in February 2005 to legalize and regulate online poker and online poker card room operators in the state. The legislation required that online poker operations would have to physically locate their entire operations in the state. Testifying before the state Senate Judiciary committee, Nigel Payne, CEO of Sportingbet and owner of Paradise Poker, pledged to relocate to the state if the bill became law.<ref>{{cite web |first=Tom |last=Rafferty |url=http://www.bismarcktribune.com/articles/2005/03/09/news/topnews/top01.txt |title=Bismarck Tribune |publisher=Bismarck Tribune |date=2005-03-08 |accessdate=2009-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060408122500/http://www.bismarcktribune.com/articles/2005/03/09/news/topnews/top01.txt |archivedate=2006-04-08 }}</ref>\n\nThe measure, however, was defeated by the State Senate in March 2005 after the U.S. Department of Justice sent a letter to North Dakota attorney general [[Wayne Stenehjem]] stating that online gaming \"may\" be illegal, and that the pending legislation \"might\" violate the federal [[Federal Wire Act|Wire Act]]. However, many legal experts [[Online gambling#General legal issues|dispute the DOJ's claim]].\n\nIn response to this and other claims by the DOJ regarding the legality of online poker, many of the major online poker sites stopped advertising their \"dot-com\" sites in American media. Instead, they created \"dot-net\" sites that are virtually identical but offer no real money wagering. The sites advertise as poker schools or ways to learn the game for free, and feature words to the effect of \"this is not a gambling website.\"\n\nOn October 13, 2006, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] officially signed into law the [[SAFE Port Act]], a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] aimed at enhancing security at U.S. ports.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/business/2006/10/13/safe-ports-act-biz-logistics-cx_rm_1013ports.html |title=Bush Signs Safe Port Act |publisher=Forbes |date=2006-10-13 |accessdate=2009-03-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018043515/http://www.forbes.com/business/2006/10/13/safe-ports-act-biz-logistics-cx_rm_1013ports.html|archivedate=2006-10-18}}</ref> Attached to the Safe Port Act was a provision known as the [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006]] (UIGEA). According to the UIGEA, \"unlawful internet gambling\" means to place, receive, or otherwise knowingly transmit a bet or wager by means of the internet where such bet is unlawful under any law in the State in which the bet is initiated, received, or otherwise made. Thus, the UIGEA prohibits online gambling sites from performing transactions with American financial institutions. As a result of the bill, several large publicly traded poker gaming sites such as [[PartyPoker]], [[Cassava Enterprises|PacificPoker]] and [[bwin]] closed down their US-facing operations.

First, there is the [[rake (poker)|rake]]. Similar to the [[Vigorish|vig]] paid to a [[Bookmaker|bookie]], the rake is a fee paid to the [[Casino|house]] for hosting the game. Rake is collected from most real money [[Cash game|ring game]] pots. The rake is normally calculated as a percentage of the pot based on a sliding scale and capped at some maximum fee. Each online poker room determines its own rake structure. Since the expenses for running an online poker table are smaller than those for running a live poker table, rake in most online poker rooms is much smaller than its brick and mortar counterpart.\n\nSecond, hands played in pre-scheduled multi-table and impromptu [[sit and go|sit-and-go]] [[poker tournament|tournaments]] are not raked, but rather an entry fee around five to ten percent of the tournament buy-in is added to the entry cost of the tournament. These two are usually specified in the tournament details as, e.g., $20+$2 ($20 represents the buy-in that goes into the prize pool and $2 represents the entry fee, de facto rake). Unlike real casino tournaments, online tournaments do not deduct dealer tips and other expenses from the prize pool.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thedailypoker.com/online-poker/how-online-poker-rooms-profit/ | title=How online poker rooms profit? | publisher=The Daily Poker |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205065713/http://www.thedailypoker.com/online-poker/how-online-poker-rooms-profit/|archive-date=2008-12-05 |access-date=2017-02-13 }}</ref>\n\nThird, some online poker sites also offer side games like [[blackjack]], [[roulettes]], or side bets on poker hands where the player plays against \"the house\" for real money.<ref>{{cite web|title=Side Games|url=http://www.mergegaming.com/side-games.html|publisher=Merge Gaming|accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref> The odds are in the house's favor in these games, thus producing a profit for the house. Some sites go as far as getting affiliated with [[online casino]]s, or even integrating them into the poker room software.\n\nFourth, like almost all institutions that hold money, online poker sites invest the money that players deposit. Regulations in most jurisdictions exist in an effort to limit the sort of risks sites can take with their clients' money. However, since the sites do not have to pay interest on players' bankrolls even low-risk investments can be a significant source of revenue.\n\n==Integrity and fairness==\n===Randomness of the shuffle===\nMany critics question whether the operators of such games - especially those located in jurisdictions separate from most of their players - might be engaging in fraud themselves.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pokernews.com/news/2013/11/todd-witteles-discusses-poker-fraud-alert-cheating-more-16878.htm | title=Todd \"DanDruff\" Witteles Discusses PokerFraudAlert, Cheating in Poker & Much More | publisher=Pokernews | date=26 November 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2014 | author=Holloway, Chad}}</ref>\n\nInternet discussion forums are rife with allegations of non-random card dealing, possibly to favour house-employed players or \"[[computer game bot|bot]]s\" (poker-playing software disguised as a human opponent), or to give multiple players good hands thus increasing the bets and the rake, or simply to prevent new players from losing so quickly that they become discouraged. However, despite [[anecdotal evidence]] to support such claims, others argue that the rake is sufficiently large that such abuses would be unnecessary and foolish. Attempts at manipulative dealing could face a risk of third party detection due to increasingly sophisticated tracking software that could be used to detect any number of unusual patterns, though such analyses are not generally available in the public domain.\n\nMany players claim to see lots of \"bad beats\" with large hands pitted against others all too often at a rate that seems to be a lot more common than in live games. However, this could be caused by the higher hands per hour at on-line cardrooms. Since online players get to see more hands, their likelihood of seeing more improbable bad beats or randomly large pots is similarly increased.\n\nMany online poker sites are certified by major auditing firms like [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] to review the fairness of the [[random number generator]], [[shuffle]], and payouts for some sites.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENMVgzDt1MEC&pg=PA23|title=Winning at Internet Poker For Dummies|last=Harlan|first=Mark|last2=Derossi|first2=Chris|date=2011-04-27|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=|isbn=9781118070000|location=|pages=23|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Insider cheating===\nInsider [[cheating]] can occur when a person with trusted access to the system (e.g. an employee of the poker room) uses his position to play poker himself with an unfair advantage. This could be done without the knowledge of the site managers.\n\nPerhaps the first known major case came to light in October 2007, when [[Absolute Poker]] acknowledged that its integrity had been breached by an employee, who had been able to play at high stakes while viewing his opponents' hidden \"hole\" cards.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21381022 |title=Online poker cheating blamed on employee |publisher=NBC News |date=2007-10-19 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> The cheating was first brought to light by the efforts of players, whose saved histories of play showed the employee was playing as only someone who could see their opponents' cards could.<ref>{{cite web|last=Levitt |first=Steven D. |url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/how-not-to-cheat/ |title=How Not to Cheat - Freakonomics Blog - NYTimes.com |publisher=Freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2007-09-20 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, [[UltimateBet]] became embroiled in a similar scandal, with former employees accused of using a [[backdoor (computing)|software backdoor]] to see opponents' cards. UltimateBet confirmed the allegations on May 29.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26563848 |title=Poker site cheating plot a high-stakes whodunit |publisher=NBC News |date=2008-09-18 |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> The [[Kahnawake Gaming Commission]] announced sanctions against UltimateBet as a result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokernews.com/news/2008/09/kahnawake-announces-ultimate-bet-sanctions.htm |title=Kahnawake Gaming Commission Announces Sanctions on UltimateBet: Russ Hamilton Named |publisher=Pokernews.com |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>\n\n===Collusion===\nMore mundane cheating involves collusion between players, or the use of multiple accounts by a single player. Collusion is not limited to online play but can occur in any poker game with three or more players. Most poker rooms claim to actively scan for such activity. For example, in 2007, [[PokerStars]] disqualified [[TheV0id]], the winner of the main event of the [[World Championship of Online Poker]] for breaching their terms of service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/2892-poker-stars-wcoop-main-event-winner-disqualified|title=Card Player Magazine |publisher=Cardplayer.com |accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>\n\n==Differences compared with conventional poker==\nThere are substantial differences between online poker gaming and conventional, live gaming.\n\nOne obvious difference is that players do not sit right across from each other, removing any ability to observe others' reactions and [[body language]]. Instead, online poker players learn to focus more keenly on opponents' betting patterns, reaction time, speed of play, use of check boxes/auto plays, opponents' fold/flop percentages, chat box, waiting for the big blind, beginners' tells, and other behavior [[Tell (poker)|tells]] that are not physical in nature. Since poker is a game that requires adaptability, successful online players learn to master the new frontiers of their surroundings.\n\nAnother less obvious difference is the rate of play. In brick and mortar casinos the dealer has to collect the cards, shuffle, and deal them after every hand. Due to this and other delays common in offline casinos, the average rate of play is around thirty hands per hour. However, online casinos do not have these delays. The dealing and shuffling are instantaneous, there are no delays relating to counting chips (for a split pot), and on average the play is faster due to \"auto-action\" buttons (where the player selects his action before his turn). It is not uncommon for an online poker table to average ninety to one hundred hands per hour.\n\nThere are many ways in which online poker is considerably cheaper to play than conventional poker. While the rake structures of online poker sites might not differ fundamentally from those in brick and mortar operations, most of the other incidental expenses that are entailed by playing poker in a live room do not exist in online poker. An online poker player can play at home and thus incur no transportation costs to get to and from the poker room. Provided the player already has a somewhat modern computer and an Internet connection, there are no further up-front equipment costs to get started. There are also considerable incidental expenses once on a live poker table. In addition to the rake, [[gratuity|tipping]] the dealers, chip runners, servers and other casino employees is almost universally expected, putting a further drain on a player's profits. Also, whereas an online player can enter and leave tables almost as he pleases, once seated at a live table a player must remain there until he wishes to stop playing, or else go back to the bottom of the waiting list. [[Food]] and [[beverage]]s at casinos are generally expensive even compared to other hospitality establishments in the same city, let alone compared to at home, and casino managers feel little incentive to provide any complimentary food or drink for poker players.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nIn the brick and mortar casinos, the only real way a player can increase his earnings is to increase his limit, likely encountering better opponents in the process. In the online world, players have another option: play more tables. Unlike a traditional casino where it is physically impossible to play at more than one table at a time, most online poker rooms permit this. Depending on the site and the player's ability to make speedy decisions, a player might play several tables at the same time, viewing them each in a separate window on the computer display. For example, an average profit around $10 per 100 hands at a low-limit game is generally considered to be good play. In a casino, this would earn a player under $4 an hour. After dealer tips, the \"winning\" player would probably barely break even before any other incidental expenses. In an online poker room, a player with the same win rate playing a relatively easy pace of four tables at once at a relatively sluggish 60 hands per hour each earns about $24/hour on average. The main restriction limiting the number of tables a player can play is the need to make consistently good decisions within the allotted time at every table, but some online players can effectively play up to eight or more tables at once. This can not only increase winnings but can also help to keep a player's income reasonably stable, since instead of staking his entire bankroll on one higher limit table he is splitting his bankroll, wins and losses amongst many lower limit tables, probably also encountering somewhat less skilled opponents in the process.\n\nAnother important difference results from the fact that some online poker rooms offer online poker schools that teach the basics and significantly speed up the learning curve for novices. Many online poker rooms also provide free money play so that players may practice these skills in various poker games and limits without the risk of losing real money, and generally offer the hand history of played hands for analysis and discussion using a [[Poker tools|poker hand converter]]. People who previously had no way to learn and improve because they had no one to play with now have the ability to learn the game much quicker and gain experience from free-money play.\n\nThe limits associated with online poker range down to far lower levels than the [[table limit]]s at a traditional casino. The [[marginal cost]] of opening each online table is so minuscule that on some gambling sites players can find limits as low as $.01\u2013$.02. By comparison, at most brick and mortar establishments the lowest limits are often $1\u2013$2.\n\nFew (if any) online poker sites allow action to be taken \"in the [[Poker terms#D|dark]]\", while this is usually allowed and applied by players in real gaming houses. It is also not uncommon for online poker sites to not allow a player the option of showing their hand before folding if they are the giving up the pot to the last remaining bettor. This practice is also typically allowed in casinos.\n\n===Currency issues===\nOne issue exclusive to online poker is the fact that players come from around the world and deal in a variety of currencies. This is not an issue in live poker where everyone present can be expected to carry the local currency. Most online poker sites operate games exclusively in [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]], even if they do not accept players based in the United States. There are two methods by which poker sites can cater to players who do not deal with U.S. dollars on a regular basis.\n\nThe first method is to hold players' funds in their native currencies and convert them only when players enter and leave games. The main benefit of this method for players is to ensure that bankrolls are not subject to [[exchange rate]] fluctuations against their local currencies while they are not playing. Also, most sites that use this method usually apply the same exchange rate when a player cashes out of a game as when he bought in, ensuring that players do not expend significant sums simply by entering and leaving games.\n\nThe other method is to require players to convert their funds when depositing them. However, some sites that use this policy do accept payments in a variety of currencies and convert funds at a lower premium compared to what [[bank]]s and [[credit card]] companies would charge. Others only accept payment in U.S. dollars. One benefit of this method is that a player who constantly \"tops up\" his chip stack to a constant level (some poker rooms have an optional feature that can perform this function automatically) does not have to worry about rounding issues when topping up with a nominal sum \u2013 these could add up over time.\n\nPlayers may also make use of [[Digital wallet|ewallets]], virtual wallets that will allow players to store their funds online in the currency of their choice. This allows them to deposit at poker sites without worrying about further currency conversion.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pokerfuse.com/features/comment-analysis/ach-and-ewallets-provide-deposit-solutions-for-online-gaming-sites-in-new-jersey-05-12/ | title=ACH and eWallets Provide Deposit Solutions for Online Gaming Sites in New Jersey | publisher=Pokerfuse | date=5 December 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2014 | author=Gentile, Michael}}</ref>\n\nMany online poker sites, particularly those that serve the United States, began adopting [[cryptocurrencies]] in 2013 as a means of bypassing the [[UIGEA]]. The majority of these poker rooms accept deposits in [[Bitcoin]] and then convert them to U.S. dollars, performing this process in reverse when paying out winnings. There also exist cryptocurrency-only operators who denominate their games in Bitcoin or fractions of a bitcoin, avoiding [[fiat currencies]] entirely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://professionalrakeback.com/bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-provide-payment-processing-solutions-for-online-gaming-sites|title=Cryptocurrencies Provide New Processing Channels for Online Gambling Operators|author=Singh, Michael|publisher=ProfessionalRakeback|date=29 January 2017|accessdate=5 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Poker tools===\n{{main|Poker tools}}\nVarious types of useful [[poker tools|software applications]] are available for online play. Such tools include hand database programs that save, sort, and recall all hand histories played online. Scanning the active tables for known players and displaying previous statistics from hands with those players next to their name(known as a Heads up display or HUD) is a common feature of these programs and is allowed by most sites. Other programs include hand re-players and odds, equity or variance calculators. Some software goes as far as to provide you with quizzes, or scan your previously played hands and flag likely mistakes.\n\n==Bonuses==\nMany online poker sites offer incentives to players, especially new depositors, in the form of bonuses. Usually, the bonuses are paid out incrementally as certain amounts are raked by the player. For example, a site may offer a player who deposits $100 a bonus of $50 that awards $5 every time the player rakes $25. To earn the full $50 bonus sum, the player would have to [[Rake (poker)|rake]] $250 in total.\n\nIn addition, several online cardrooms have developed VIP programs to reward regular players. Poker rooms often offer additional bonuses for players who wish to top-up their accounts. These are known as reload bonuses.\n\nMany online rooms also offer [[rakeback]] and some offer poker propping.\n\nSee the [[Online casino#Bonuses|online casino]] article for more on general information on bonuses.\n\n== Compatibility ==\nOnline poker rooms typically operate through a separate piece of software. This may be cross-platform, for example using a [[Java applet]] or [[WebGL]], allowing the program to run equally well on various computer systems such as [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[macOS]]. However, many online poker rooms offer downloadable programs designed only for Microsoft Windows which require a compatibility layer such as [[Wine (software)|Wine]] to run on [[Macintosh]] or [[Linux]] computers. Some sites do make available clients that run natively on Mac or Linux.\n\nSome poker rooms have started offering poker on portable devices ([[mobile phone]]s, [[smart phone]]s, [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s). The functionality of mobile online poker software is much the same as computer-based clients, albeit adapted to the interface of mobile devices. The player must be able to receive a WiFi or cell phone signal in order to play.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Computer poker players]]\n*[[:Category:Poker companies|Poker companies]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n<!--========================({{No More Links}})============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
