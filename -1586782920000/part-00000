The craft was launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on April 11, 1970, but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module (SM)|service module]] (SM) failed two days into the mission. The crew instead looped around the Moon, and returned safely to Earth on April 17. The mission was commanded by [[Jim Lovell]] with [[Jack Swigert]] as [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) pilot and [[Fred Haise]] as [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] (LM) pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for [[Ken Mattingly]], who was grounded after exposure to [[rubella]].\n\nA routine stir of an oxygen tank ignited damaged wire insulation inside it, causing an explosion that vented the contents of both of the SM's oxygen tanks to space. Without oxygen, needed for breathing and for generating electric power, the SM's propulsion and life support systems could not operate. The CM's systems had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for reentry, forcing the crew to transfer to the LM as a lifeboat. With the lunar landing canceled, mission controllers worked to bring the crew home alive.\n\nAlthough the LM was designed to support two men on the lunar surface for two days, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in Houston improvised new procedures so it could support three men for four days. The crew experienced great hardship caused by limited power, a chilly and wet cabin and a shortage of [[potable water]]. There was a critical need to adapt the CM's cartridges for the [[carbon dioxide]] removal system to work in the LM; the crew and mission controllers were successful in improvising a solution. The astronauts' peril briefly renewed interest in the Apollo program; tens of millions watched the splashdown in the [[South Pacific Ocean]] on television.\n\nAn investigative review board found fault with preflight testing of the oxygen tank and the fact that [[Teflon]] was placed inside it. The board recommended changes, including minimizing the use of potentially combustible items inside the tank; this was done for [[Apollo 14]]. The story of Apollo&nbsp;13 has been dramatized several times, most notably in the 1995 film ''[[Apollo&nbsp;13 (film)|Apollo&nbsp;13]]''.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1961, U.S. President [[John F.

But the accident could have damaged the SPS, and the fuel cells would have to last at least another hour to meet its power requirements, so Kranz instead decided on a longer route: the spacecraft would swing around the Moon before heading back to Earth. Apollo&nbsp;13 was on the hybrid trajectory which was to take it to Fra Mauro; it now needed to be brought back to a free return. The LM's [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS), although not as powerful as the SPS, could do this, but new software for Mission Control's computers needed to be written by technicians as it had never been contemplated that the CSM/LM spacecraft would have to be maneuvered by the DPS. As the CM was being shut down, Lovell copied down its guidance system's orientation information and performed hand calculations to transfer it to the LM's guidance system, which had been turned off; at his request Mission Control checked his figures.<ref name = \"Cass 2\">{{cite web|last=Cass|first=Stephen|title=Houston, we have a solution, part 2|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution-part-2|date=April 1, 2005|website=IEEE|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=297\u2013298}} At 61:29:43.49 the DPS burn of 34.23&nbsp;seconds took Apollo&nbsp;13 back to a free return trajectory.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=369}}\n\n[[File:Mare Moscoviense AS13-60-8648.jpg|thumb|The Apollo&nbsp;13 crew photographed the Moon out of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]].]]\nThe change would get Apollo&nbsp;13 back to Earth in about four days' time{{snd}}though with splashdown in the [[Indian Ocean]], where NASA had few recovery forces. Jerry Bostick and other [[Flight controller#FDO|Flight Dynamics Officers]] (FIDOs) were anxious both to shorten the travel time and to move splashdown to the [[Pacific Ocean]], where the main recovery forces were located. One option would shave 36 hours off the return time, but required jettisoning the SM; this would expose the CM's heat shield to space during the return journey, something for which it had not been designed. The FIDOs also proposed other solutions. After a meeting involving NASA officials and engineers, the senior individual present, [[Manned Spaceflight Center]] director [[Robert R.

The craft was launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on April 11, 1970, but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module (SM)|service module]] (SM) failed two days into the mission. The crew instead looped around the Moon, and returned safely to Earth on April 17. The mission was commanded by [[Jim Lovell]] with [[Jack Swigert]] as [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) pilot and [[Fred Haise]] as [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] (LM) pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for [[Ken Mattingly]], who was grounded after exposure to [[rubella]].\n\nA routine stir of an oxygen tank ignited damaged wire insulation inside it, causing an explosion that vented the contents of both of the SM's oxygen tanks to space. Without oxygen, needed for breathing and for generating electric power, the SM's propulsion and life support systems could not operate. The CM's systems had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for reentry, forcing the crew to transfer to the LM as a lifeboat. With the lunar landing canceled, mission controllers worked to bring the crew home alive.\n\nAlthough the LM was designed to support two men on the lunar surface for two days, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in Houston improvised new procedures so it could support three men for four days. The crew experienced great hardship caused by limited power, a chilly and wet cabin and a shortage of [[potable water]]. There was a critical need to adapt the CM's cartridges for the [[carbon dioxide]] removal system to work in the LM; the crew and mission controllers were successful in improvising a solution. The astronauts' peril briefly renewed interest in the Apollo program; tens of millions watched the splashdown in the [[South Pacific Ocean]] on television.\n\nAn investigative review board found fault with preflight testing of the oxygen tank and the fact that [[Teflon]] was placed inside it. The board recommended changes, including minimizing the use of potentially combustible items inside the tank; this was done for [[Apollo 14]]. The story of Apollo&nbsp;13 has been dramatized several times, most notably in the 1995 film ''[[Apollo&nbsp;13 (film)|Apollo&nbsp;13]]''.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1961, U.S. President [[John F.

Each member of the prime crew spent over 400 hours in simulators of the CM and (for Lovell and Haise) of the LM at KSC and at Houston, some of which involved the flight controllers at Mission Control.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=104}} Flight controllers participated in many simulations of problems with the spacecraft in flight, which taught them how to react in an emergency.<ref name = \"Cass 1\" />  Specialized simulators at other locations were also used by the crew members.{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=104}}\n\nThe astronauts of Apollo 11 had minimal time for geology training, with only six months between crew assignment and launch; higher priorities took much of their time.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|p=100}} Apollo 12 saw more such training, including practice in the field, using a CAPCOM and a simulated backroom of scientists, to whom the astronauts had to describe what they saw.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|pp=103\u2013104}} Scientist-astronaut [[Harrison Schmitt]] saw that there was limited enthusiasm for geology field trips. Believing an inspirational teacher was needed, Schmitt arranged for Lovell and Haise to meet his old professor, [[Caltech]]'s [[Leon Silver|Lee Silver]]. The two astronauts, and backups Young and Duke, went on a field trip with Silver at their own time and expense. At the end of their week together, Lovell made Silver their geology mentor, who would be extensively involved in the geology planning for Apollo&nbsp;13.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|pp=107\u2013111}} [[Farouk El-Baz]] oversaw the training of Mattingly and his backup, Swigert, which involved describing and photographing simulated lunar landmarks from airplanes.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|p=134}} El-Baz had all three prime crew astronauts describe geologic features they saw during their flights between Houston and KSC; Mattingly's enthusiasm caused other astronauts, such as Apollo 14's CMP, Roosa, to seek out El-Baz as a teacher.{{sfn|Phinney|2015|pp=141\u2013142}}\n\nConcerned about how close Apollo 11's LM, ''Eagle'', had come to running out of propellant during its lunar descent, mission planners decided that beginning with Apollo&nbsp;13, the CSM would bring the LM to the low orbit from which the landing attempt would commence. This was a change from Apollo 11 and 12, on which the LM made the burn to bring it to the lower orbit. The change was part of an effort to increase the amount of hover time available to the astronauts as the missions headed into rougher terrain.{{sfn|Harland|1999|p=53}}\n\nThe plan was to devote the first of the two four-hour lunar surface [[extravehicular activity|extravehicular activities]] (EVAs) to setting up the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP) group of scientific instruments; during the second, Lovell and Haise would investigate Cone crater, near the planned landing site.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=363}} The two astronauts wore their spacesuits for some 20 walk-throughs of EVA procedures, including sample gathering and use of tools and other equipment. They flew in the \"[[Vomit Comet]]\" in simulated microgravity or lunar gravity, including practice in donning and doffing spacesuits. To prepare for the descent to the Moon's surface, Lovell flew the [[Lunar Landing Training Vehicle]] (LLTV).{{sfn|Apollo 13 Press Kit|1970|p=105}} Despite the fact that four of the five LLTVs and similar Lunar Landing Research Vehicles crashed during the course of the Apollo program, mission commanders considered flying them invaluable experience.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Eric M.|title=Lunar Landing Training Vehicle NASA 952|date=April 29, 2006|accessdate=July 20, 2019|url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/LLTV-952.html|publisher=[[NASA]]|work=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal}}</ref>\n\n== Experiments and scientific objectives ==\n[[File:Lovell and Haise geology training (S70-20253).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lovell (left) and Haise during geology training in Hawaii, January 1970]]\n\nApollo&nbsp;13's designated landing site was near [[Fra Mauro (crater)|Fra Mauro crater]]; the [[Fra Mauro formation]] was believed to contain much material spattered by the impact that had filled the [[Imbrium basin]] early in the Moon's history. Dating it would provide information not only about the Moon, but about the Earth's early history. Such material was likely to be available at [[Cone (crater)|Cone crater]], a site where an impact was believed to have drilled deep into the lunar [[regolith]].{{sfn|Harland|1999|pp=51\u201353}}\n\nApollo 11 had left a [[seismometer]] on the Moon, but the solar-powered unit did not survive its first two-week-long lunar night.

The cask placed around the capsule for transport to the Moon was built with heat shields of graphite and of beryllium, and with structural parts of titanium and of [[Inconel]] materials.

Normally this was done once daily; this additional stir would [[Thermal destratification|destratify]] the contents of the tanks, making the pressure readings more accurate.<ref name = \"journal Houston\" /> The Flight Director, Kranz, had Liebergot wait a few minutes for the crew to settle down after the telecast,{{sfn|Houston, Heflin & Aaron|2015|p=207}} then Lousma relayed the request to Swigert, who activated the switches controlling the fans,<ref name = \"journal Houston\" /> and after a few seconds turned them off again.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|p=292}}\n\n{{Listen|filename=Apollo13-wehaveaproblem.ogg|title=Houston, we've had a problem.|description=Swigert and Lovell reporting the incident on April 14, 1970 [2:59] \"[[Houston, we've had a problem]]\"|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nNinety-five seconds after Swigert activated those switches,{{sfn|Houston, Heflin & Aaron|2015|p=207}} the astronauts heard a \"pretty large bang\", accompanied by fluctuations in electrical power and the firing of the attitude control thrusters.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=368}}{{sfn|Orloff|2000|pp=152\u2013157}} Communications and telemetry to Earth were lost for 1.8&nbsp;seconds, until the system automatically corrected by switching the [[directional antenna|high-gain]] [[Unified S-band|S-band]] antenna, used for translunar communications, from narrow-beam to wide-beam mode.{{sfn|Accident report|p=4-44}} The accident happened at 55:54:53 (03:08 UT on April 14, 10:08 PM EST, April 13). Swigert reported 26&nbsp;seconds later, [[Houston, we have a problem|\"Okay, Houston, we've had a problem here,\"]] echoed at 55:55:42 by Lovell, \"Houston, we've had a problem. We've had a Main&nbsp;B Bus undervolt.\"<ref name = \"journal Houston\" />\n\nLovell's initial thought on hearing the noise was that Haise had activated the LM's cabin-repressurization valve, which also produced a bang (Haise enjoyed doing so to startle his crewmates) but Lovell could see that Haise had no idea what had happened. Swigert initially thought that a [[meteoroid]] might have struck the LM, but he and Lovell quickly realized there was no leak.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|p=293}} The Main Bus&nbsp;B undervolt meant that there was insufficient voltage flowing from the SM's three power cells (fueled by hydrogen and oxygen piped from their respective tanks) to the second of the SM's two power distribution systems. Almost everything in the CSM required power. Although the bus momentarily returned to normal status, soon both buses A and B were short on voltage. Haise checked the status of the fuel cells, and found that two of them were dead. Mission rules forbade entering lunar orbit unless all fuel cells were operational.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=293\u2013294}}\n\nIn the minutes after the accident, there were several unusual readings, showing that tank{{nbsp}}2 was empty and tank{{nbsp}}1's pressure slowly falling, that the [[Apollo Guidance Computer|computer on the spacecraft]] had reset and that the high-gain antenna was not working. Liebergot initially missed the worrying signs from tank{{nbsp}}2 following the stir, as he was focusing on tank{{nbsp}}1, believing that its reading would be a good guide to what was present in tank{{nbsp}}2; so did controllers supporting him in the \"back room\".  When Kranz questioned Liebergot on this he initially responded that there might be false readings due to an instrumentation problem; he was often teased about that in the years to come.<ref name = \"Cass 1\">{{cite web|last=Cass|first=Stephen|title=Houston, we have a solution|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution|date=April 1, 2005|accessdate=August 30, 2019|website=IEEE}}</ref> Lovell, looking out the window, reported \"a gas of some sort\" venting into space, making it clear that there was a serious problem.{{sfn|Houston, Heflin & Aaron|2015|p=215}}\n\nSince the fuel cells needed oxygen to operate, when Oxygen Tank{{nbsp}}1 ran dry, the remaining fuel cell would shut down, meaning the CSM's only significant sources of power and oxygen would be the CM's batteries and its oxygen \"surge tank\". These would be needed for the final hours of the mission, but the remaining fuel cell, already starved for oxygen, was drawing from the surge tank. Kranz ordered the surge tank isolated, saving its oxygen, but this meant that the remaining fuel cell would die within two hours, as the oxygen in tank{{nbsp}}1 was consumed or leaked away.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=293\u2013294}} The volume surrounding the spacecraft was filled with myriad small bits of debris from the accident, complicating any efforts to use the stars for navigation.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|p=299}}  The mission's goal became simply getting the astronauts back to Earth alive.<ref name = \"Cass 2\" />\n\n=== Looping around the Moon ===\n[[File:Direct Abort Trajectory - Lunar Landing Symposium, MSC Jun66.jpg|left|upright=1.2|thumb|This depiction of a direct abort (from a 1966 planning report) contemplates returning from a point much earlier in the mission, and closer to Earth, than where the Apollo&nbsp;13 accident occurred.]]\n[[File:NASA-Apollo13-ViewsOfMoon-20200224.webm|thumb|left|260px|NASA - Apollo 13 Lunar Mission - Views Of The Moon (2:24)]]\nThe lunar module had charged batteries and full oxygen tanks for use on the lunar surface, so Kranz directed that the astronauts power up the LM and use it as a \"lifeboat\"<ref name = \"Cass 1\" />{{snd}}a scenario anticipated but considered unlikely.{{sfn|Lovell & Kluger|2000|pp=83\u201387}} Procedures for using the LM in this way had been developed by LM flight controllers after a training simulation for Apollo 10 in which the LM was needed for survival, but could not be powered up in time.<ref name = \"Cass 2\" /> Had Apollo&nbsp;13's  accident occurred on the return voyage, with the LM already jettisoned, the astronauts would have died,<ref name=\"LM-ALSEP\">{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1970-029C|title=Apollo 13 Lunar Module/ALSEP|website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|accessdate=October 31, 2009}}</ref> as they would have following an explosion in lunar orbit, including one while Lovell and Haise walked on the Moon.<ref name = \"Yahoo 50th\" />\n\nA key decision was the choice of return path. A \"direct abort\" would use the SM's main engine (the [[Service Propulsion System]] or SPS) to return before reaching the Moon. But the accident could have damaged the SPS, and the fuel cells would have to last at least another hour to meet its power requirements, so Kranz instead decided on a longer route: the spacecraft would swing around the Moon before heading back to Earth. Apollo&nbsp;13 was on the hybrid trajectory which was to take it to Fra Mauro; it now needed to be brought back to a free return. The LM's [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS), although not as powerful as the SPS, could do this, but new software for Mission Control's computers needed to be written by technicians as it had never been contemplated that the CSM/LM spacecraft would have to be maneuvered by the DPS. As the CM was being shut down, Lovell copied down its guidance system's orientation information and performed hand calculations to transfer it to the LM's guidance system, which had been turned off; at his request Mission Control checked his figures.<ref name = \"Cass 2\">{{cite web|last=Cass|first=Stephen|title=Houston, we have a solution, part 2|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution-part-2|date=April 1, 2005|website=IEEE|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=297\u2013298}} At 61:29:43.49 the DPS burn of 34.23&nbsp;seconds took Apollo&nbsp;13 back to a free return trajectory.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=369}}\n\n[[File:Mare Moscoviense AS13-60-8648.jpg|thumb|The Apollo&nbsp;13 crew photographed the Moon out of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]].]]\nThe change would get Apollo&nbsp;13 back to Earth in about four days' time{{snd}}though with splashdown in the [[Indian Ocean]], where NASA had few recovery forces. Jerry Bostick and other [[Flight controller#FDO|Flight Dynamics Officers]] (FIDOs) were anxious both to shorten the travel time and to move splashdown to the [[Pacific Ocean]], where the main recovery forces were located. One option would shave 36 hours off the return time, but required jettisoning the SM; this would expose the CM's heat shield to space during the return journey, something for which it had not been designed. The FIDOs also proposed other solutions. After a meeting involving NASA officials and engineers, the senior individual present, [[Manned Spaceflight Center]] director [[Robert R. Gilruth]], decided on a burn using the DPS, that would save 12&nbsp;hours and land Apollo&nbsp;13 in the Pacific. This \"PC+2\" burn would take place two hours after [[pericynthion]], the closest approach to the Moon.<ref name = \"Cass 2\" />  At pericynthion, Apollo&nbsp;13 set the record (per the ''Guinness Book of World Records''), which still stands, for the highest absolute altitude attained by a crewed spacecraft: {{convert|400171|km|sp=us}} from Earth at 7:21&nbsp;pm EST, April 14 (00:21:00&nbsp;UTC April 15).{{sfn|Glenday|2010|p=13}}{{NoteTag|The record was set because  the Moon was nearly at [[apogee|its furthest from Earth]] during the mission.

The SM was jettisoned less than half an hour later, allowing the crew to see the damage for the first time, and photograph it.

The resulting fire quickly increased pressure inside the tank and the tank dome failed, filling the fuel cell bay (SM Sector{{nbsp}}4) with rapidly expanding gaseous oxygen and combustion products. The escaping gas was probably enough by itself to blow out the aluminum exterior panel to Sector{{nbsp}}4, but combustion products generated as nearby insulation ignited would have added to the pressure. The panel's departure exposed the sector to space, snuffing out the fire, and it probably hit the nearby high-gain antenna, disrupting communications to Earth for 1.8&nbsp;seconds.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|pp=372\u2013373}} The sectors of the SM were not airtight from each other, and had there been time for the entire SM to become as pressurized as Sector{{nbsp}}4, the force on the CM's heat shield would have separated the two modules.

Nonetheless, the switches Beech used were not rated for 65 volts.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=374}}\n\nAt NAR's facility, Oxygen Tank&nbsp;2 had been originally installed in an oxygen shelf placed in the [[Apollo 10]] service module, SM-106, but which was removed to fix a potential [[electromagnetic interference]] problem and another shelf substituted. During removal, the shelf was accidentally dropped at least {{convert|2|in|cm|0|order=flip|sp=us}} because a retaining bolt had not been removed. The probability of damage from this was low, but it is possible that the fill line assembly was loose and made worse by the fall. After some retesting (which did not include filling the tank with liquid oxygen), in November 1968 the shelf was re-installed in SM-109, intended for Apollo&nbsp;13, which was shipped to KSC in June 1969.{{sfn|Accident report|pp=4-19, 4-21}}\n\nThe [[Terminal countdown demonstration test|Countdown Demonstration Test]] took place with SM-109 in its place near the top of the Saturn&nbsp;V and began on March 16, 1970. During the test, the cryogenic tanks were filled, but Oxygen Tank&nbsp;2 could not be emptied through the normal drain line, and a report was written documenting the problem. After discussion among NASA and the contractors, attempts to empty the tank resumed on March 27. When it would not empty normally, the heaters in the tank were turned on to boil off the oxygen. The thermostatic switches were designed to prevent the heaters from raising the temperature higher than {{convert|80|F|C|order=flip}}, but they failed under the 65-volt power supply applied. Temperatures on the heater tube within the tank may have reached {{convert|1,000|F|C|order=flip|-1}}, most likely damaging the Teflon insulation.{{sfn|Accident report|p=4-23}} The temperature gauge was not designed to read higher than {{convert|85|F|C|order=flip}}, so the technician monitoring the procedure detected nothing unusual.

The heaters were retained since they were necessary to maintain oxygen pressure. The stirring fans, with their unsealed motors, were removed, which meant the oxygen quantity gauge was no longer accurate. This required adding a third tank so that no tank would go below half full.{{sfn|Gatland|1976|p=281}} The third tank was placed in Bay{{nbsp}}1 of the SM, on the side opposite the other two, and was given an isolation valve that could isolate it from the fuel cells and from the other two oxygen tanks in an emergency, and allow it to feed the CM's environmental system only. The quantity probe was upgraded from aluminum to stainless steel.{{sfn|Apollo 14 Press Kit|1971|pp=96\u201397}}\n\nAll electrical wiring in Bay{{nbsp}}4 was sheathed in stainless steel.

It was written and produced by Jackson, [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]]. The track was sent to [[contemporary hit radio]] in the US on May 23, 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked to several radio stations. It is an upbeat [[electropop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song with a syncopated drum loop and [[bassline]]. Based on a previously discarded poem Jackson wrote, the lyrics are about her film character's love for [[The Nutty Professor (character)|The Nutty Professor]].\n\nThe track received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised its upbeat sound and Jackson's [[breathy voice]]. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three consecutive weeks, becoming the singer's ninth US chart-topper. It was Jackson's 19th single to be certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), making her only the third singer, after [[Madonna]] and [[Whitney Houston]], to achieve this feat. The song peaked at number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming Jackson's 15th single to reach the top 10 in the UK. It also peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain.\n\nThe [[Joseph Kahn]]-directed music video resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. It features an [[AIBO]], a prototype of the [[Acura CL]]-X, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a tilting platform. Production of the video costed over $2.5 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2.5|2000|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), making it one of the [[list of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos of all time]]. To promote the single, Jackson performed it on British television program ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and at the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards]]. The song was also performed during four of the singer's concert tours, and her 2019 Las Vegas residency, [[Janet Jackson: Metamorphosis]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=562 916-2|location=New York City}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Action Jackson|magazine=[[USA Weekend]]|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T9cDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA181#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Janet at the Crossroads|last=Norment|first=Lynn|magazine=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|volume=41|number=1|page=181|date=November 2000|access-date=April 12, 2020}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

Jackson wrote further lyrics for the song during the same night Jam came up with the melody alongside drum programmer Alex Richburg.<ref name=\"Bronson\"/> After an early version of the song was created, Jackson requested Jam and Richburg to add more instrumentation, however Jam decided to record from [[Broadcasting#Recorded and live forms|live to tape]] after Richburg left the studio.<ref name=\"Keyboard\">{{cite magazine|last=Rule|first=Greg|date=November 2000|title=Jimmy Jam: Inside Flyte Tyme studios|magazine=[[Keyboard (magazine)|Keyboard]]|volume=26|issue=11|pages=32-40|issn=07300158}}</ref> Initially conceived as a \"slow melody\", Jam chose to increase its [[tempo]].<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\nTwo different choruses were written by Jam and Jackson; Jam wrote \"Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you\" while Jackson wrote \"Doesn't really matter\". They decided to use Jackson's chorus, and include Jam's chorus towards the end of the track. Jackson presented three songs to Segal on May 12, 2000, three days prior to his set deadline for the soundtrack.

It then pans from a panoramic nighttime city view to a scene of Jackson singing from her bed in a confined apartment. During this scene, the AIBO and various objects in her room are shown, including a television displaying ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'', and a pair of [[moon shoes]]. Jackson then grabs a beverage from her fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four of her friends knock at her door and Jackson leaves with them. They dance through the apartment block hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform.\n\nDuring the song's breakdown, they perform a choreographed dance routine on the tilting platform. The scenes are intercut with Jackson drawing an orange swirl and the AIBO watching the film in her apartment. Various people are also seen drawing orange swirls. In the next segment, Jackson is shown in the passenger seat of a car driving through a tunnel, as scenes from ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' appear as a reflection in the front window. The video concludes with a [[slow motion]] shot of Jackson falling backwards onto her bed and the AIBO resting in front of her.\n\n===Reception===\nWriting for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson praised the music video for deviating from the standard \"lip-synch/film snippet formula\" used among pop videos at the time, stating that it \"stands on its own\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/klumpsuncensored.shtml|title=Nutty Professor II: The Klumps \u2013 Uncensored Director's Cut (2000)|website=DVD Movie Guide|last=Jacobson|first=Colin|year=2000|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> Rod Stafford Hagwood of the ''Sun-Sentinel'' included \"Doesn't Really Matter\" among several videos which set fashion trends and increased the popularity of \"bright colorful clothes\" among youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-08-08/lifestyle/0008070457_1_colors-young-women-video|title=What Are The Coolest Kids Wearing This Fall?

It was written and produced by Jackson, [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]]. The track was sent to [[contemporary hit radio]] in the US on May 23, 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked to several radio stations. It is an upbeat [[electropop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song with a syncopated drum loop and [[bassline]]. Based on a previously discarded poem Jackson wrote, the lyrics are about her film character's love for [[The Nutty Professor (character)|The Nutty Professor]].\n\nThe track received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised its upbeat sound and Jackson's [[breathy voice]]. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three consecutive weeks, becoming the singer's ninth US chart-topper. It was Jackson's 19th single to be certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), making her only the third singer, after [[Madonna]] and [[Whitney Houston]], to achieve this feat. The song peaked at number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming Jackson's 15th single to reach the top 10 in the UK. It also peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain.\n\nThe [[Joseph Kahn]]-directed music video resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. It features an [[AIBO]], a prototype of the [[Acura CL]]-X, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a tilting platform. Production of the video costed over $2.5 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2.5|2000|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), making it one of the [[list of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos of all time]]. To promote the single, Jackson performed it on British television program ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and at the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards]].

Jackson then grabs a beverage from her fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four of her friends knock at her door and Jackson leaves with them. They dance through the apartment block hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform.\n\nDuring the song's breakdown, they perform a choreographed dance routine on the tilting platform. The scenes are intercut with Jackson drawing an orange swirl and the AIBO watching the film in her apartment. Various people are also seen drawing orange swirls. In the next segment, Jackson is shown in the passenger seat of a car driving through a tunnel, as scenes from ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' appear as a reflection in the front window. The video concludes with a [[slow motion]] shot of Jackson falling backwards onto her bed and the AIBO resting in front of her.\n\n===Reception===\nWriting for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson praised the music video for deviating from the standard \"lip-synch/film snippet formula\" used among pop videos at the time, stating that it \"stands on its own\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/klumpsuncensored.shtml|title=Nutty Professor II: The Klumps \u2013 Uncensored Director's Cut (2000)|website=DVD Movie Guide|last=Jacobson|first=Colin|year=2000|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> Rod Stafford Hagwood of the ''Sun-Sentinel'' included \"Doesn't Really Matter\" among several videos which set fashion trends and increased the popularity of \"bright colorful clothes\" among youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-08-08/lifestyle/0008070457_1_colors-young-women-video|title=What Are The Coolest Kids Wearing This Fall?
