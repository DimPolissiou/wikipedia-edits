Mertz Library''' is a [[research library]] located at the [[New York Botanical Garden]] in [[the Bronx]], New York City. Founded in 1899 and renamed in the 1990s for [[LuEsther Mertz]], it is the United States' largest botanical library, and was the first library whose collection focused exclusively on botany.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 3\" />\n\nThe library contains large collections of books relating to botany and horticulture, and are used for studies in fields such as history, anthropology, landscape and building design, architectural history, ethnobotany, economic botany, urban social history, and environmental policy. The library contains current scholarly books and serials, as well as many rare and historically important works.\n\nThe library building was designed in 1896 by [[Robert W. Gibson]] in the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]] style and constructed in 1898-1901. The structure, originally known as the '''Museum Building''' and later known as the '''Administration Building''', is four stories tall and contains a facade of gray-[[Buff (colour)|buff]] brick with buff [[terracotta]]. A sculptural fountain called the ''Fountain of Life'', as well as a tree-lined [[Avenue (landscape)|avenue]] called the Tulip Tree Allee, is located outside the front entrance. In 2009 the library building, fountain, and avenue were made a [[New York City designated landmark]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Establishment ===\nAn act of the [[New York State Legislature]], passed in 1891, set aside land within [[Bronx Park]] in the north-central part of [[the Bronx]] for the creation of the [[New York Botanical Garden]] (NYBG) on the condition that a board of directors raised $250,000 for the site.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1891|title=An act to provide for the establishment of a botanic garden and arboretum|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433090742150&view=1up&seq=537|journal=Laws of the State of New York Passed at the Sessions ... 114th Session|volume=|pages=523\u2013525|via=HathiTrust}}</ref><ref name=\"NYCL p. 2\">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|2009|ps=.|p=2}}</ref> Prominent civic leaders and financiers agreed to match the City's commitment to finance the buildings and improvements.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 2\" /> By May 1895, sufficient funds had been raised,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1896/05/10/archives/botanical-garden-plans-prof-brittons-lecture-before-the-gardeners.html|title=BOTANICAL GARDEN PLANS; PROF.

Mertz Library''' is a [[research library]] located at the [[New York Botanical Garden]] in [[the Bronx]], New York City. Founded in 1899 and renamed in the 1990s for [[LuEsther Mertz]], it is the United States' largest botanical library, and was the first library whose collection focused exclusively on botany.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 3\" />\n\nThe library contains large collections of books relating to botany and horticulture, and are used for studies in fields such as history, anthropology, landscape and building design, architectural history, ethnobotany, economic botany, urban social history, and environmental policy. The library contains current scholarly books and serials, as well as many rare and historically important works.\n\nThe library building was designed in 1896 by [[Robert W. Gibson]] in the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]] style and constructed in 1898-1901. The structure, originally known as the '''Museum Building''' and later known as the '''Administration Building''', is four stories tall and contains a facade of gray-[[Buff (colour)|buff]] brick with buff [[terracotta]]. A sculptural fountain called the ''Fountain of Life'', as well as a tree-lined [[Avenue (landscape)|avenue]] called the Tulip Tree Allee, is located outside the front entrance. In 2009 the library building, fountain, and avenue were made a [[New York City designated landmark]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Establishment ===\nAn act of the [[New York State Legislature]], passed in 1891, set aside land within [[Bronx Park]] in the north-central part of [[the Bronx]] for the creation of the [[New York Botanical Garden]] (NYBG) on the condition that a board of directors raised $250,000 for the site.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1891|title=An act to provide for the establishment of a botanic garden and arboretum|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433090742150&view=1up&seq=537|journal=Laws of the State of New York Passed at the Sessions ... 114th Session|volume=|pages=523\u2013525|via=HathiTrust}}</ref><ref name=\"NYCL p. 2\">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|2009|ps=.|p=2}}</ref> Prominent civic leaders and financiers agreed to match the City's commitment to finance the buildings and improvements.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 2\" /> By May 1895, sufficient funds had been raised,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1896/05/10/archives/botanical-garden-plans-prof-brittons-lecture-before-the-gardeners.html|title=BOTANICAL GARDEN PLANS; PROF.

{"title_page": "London Metropolitan Archives", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:London Metropolitan Archives front.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.4|London Metropolitan Archives: main building and entrance]]\nThe '''London Metropolitan Archives''' ('''LMA''') is the principal local government [[archive|archive repository]] for the [[Greater London]] area, including the [[City of London]]: it is the largest [[county record office]] in the United Kingdom. It was established under its present name in 1997, having previously been known as the '''Greater London Record Office'''. It is administered and financed by the [[City of London Corporation]].\n\nThe archive is based at 40 Northampton Road, [[Clerkenwell]], London. It attracts over 30,000 visitors a year and deals with a similar number of written enquiries. LMA's extensive holdings amount to over 72 miles of records of local, regional and national importance. With the earliest record dating from 1067, the archive charts the development of the capital into a modern-day major world city.\n\n==History==\nLondon Metropolitan Archives in its current form is essentially an amalgamation of four separate bodies. The first three were the London County Record Office, the London County Council Members Library and the Middlesex County Record Office, which merged in 1965 to form the Greater London Record Office and History Library (GLRO). The GLRO was rebranded as London Metropolitan Archives in 1997, and took over the former [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]] Record Office (CLRO) in 2005.\n\n===London County Record Office===\nUntil 1889, London was still the area within the walled city; to the south of the river was [[Surrey]] and [[Kent]] and to the north of the city's limits was [[Middlesex]]. These areas, however, had become densely populated and, given the sphere of influence of the city, traditional boundaries were no longer practical. The County of London was created and controlled by the newly formed [[London County Council]], which took over many of the duties of its predecessor the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]]. It was the records of these bodies and similar groups such as the [[London School Board]] and [[Metropolitan Asylums Board]] that would form the nucleus of the London County Record offices holdings, which were based at County Hall on the south bank of the [[River Thames]].\n\nAs well as the official records that the council generated, they also began to accept deposits of records fundamental to London's history, such as copies of memorials from the Middlesex deeds register, diocesan and parish records and records of charities such as the [[Foundling Hospital]]. Under the [[Public Records Act 1958]], the record office became recognised as a place of deposit for public records.\n\nSince the creation of the London County Council there had been a record keeper in the Clerks Department who held custody of the documents. By the 1930s they had established individual departmental record rooms staffed by record assistants working under the general supervision of the Record Keeper. Finally in 1953 the position of Head Archivist and Librarian was created.\n\n===London County Council Members Library===\n\nThe library was originally that of the members of the London County Council and reflected their interests. Situated in the same building as the London County Record Office, the library was added to with books on the history and topography of London. The library also included a rich collection of maps, prints, drawings and photographs.\n\n===Middlesex County Record Office===\nNo single act or resolution marked the beginning of the Middlesex County Record Office. Like most other county record offices it developed naturally from the duty of the [[Clerk of the Peace]] to preserve certain records from the [[Quarter Sessions]], together with other records such as enclosure awards and plans of public utilities. The first significant period in the formation of the county record office was in the early 1880s when a special committee was appointed by the [[justices of the peace]] to consider and report on the accommodation provided for the storage of the \"old records\" of the county. On behalf of the committee, [[John Cordy Jeaffreson]], an inspector of the [[Historical Manuscripts Commission]], sorted the records covering 1549\u20131820 into 87 classes comprising more than 10,000 volumes and nearly 5000 rolls. The more modern records from post-1820 were given a separate room.\n\nThe formation of the London County Council in 1889 had seen the County of [[Middlesex]] much reduced in size. In 1893 when the Middlesex sessions papers were to be moved from the sessions house in [[Clerkenwell]] (an area that was previously Middlesex but now London) an argument broke out between the two [[county councils]] as to who should have responsibility for the material. This protracted dispute lasted some five years, with a high court judge eventually deciding in favour of Middlesex.\n\nAround the same time, a [[Middlesex County Council]] act empowered the council to spend money preserving, arranging, indexing, classifying and publishing such records of the county that may be in the public interest. In 1913 the new [[Middlesex Guildhall]] at [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] opened and was equipped with specially constructed muniment rooms, with an assistant to arrange and supervise their transfer from temporary storage. It was not until 1923 that a full-time graduate assistant was placed in charge of dealing with things such as document repair, storage issues, written enquiries, production of documents for public researchers and receipt of any gifts or deposits.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the work of the county record office expanded steadily, with the appointment of a County [[Archivist]], first in a part-time capacity (Colonel [[William Le Hardy]]), then full-time from 1957. By then, the archive had also moved to new premises at 1 Queen Anne's Gate Buildings, Dartmouth Street. In 1960 the record office was appointed an official place of deposit by the [[Lord Chancellor]] under section 4 (1) of the [[Public Records Act 1958]]. After this, the archive increased its holdings, with significant deposits of [[petty sessions]], coroners, Boards of Guardians and other official material. By this time, the record office had acquired an extensive reference library on the topography of Middlesex, as well as a great number of maps, prints and photographs.\n\n===The Greater London Record Office ===\n[[File:London Metropolitan Archives repository.JPG|thumb|right|1990s repository block]]\n\nUnder the Local [[London Government Act 1963]], which came into effect on 1 April 1965, the administrative counties of London and Middlesex together with their respective county councils were abolished. They were replaced by the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) which administered a much wider area known as [[Greater London]]. The formation of Greater London also meant that some areas that had been previously part of [[Kent]], [[Surrey]], [[Essex]] and [[Hertfordshire]], were also now included. However, to minimise confusion, it was agreed that records from these areas should remain within their ancient county.\n\nThe Greater London Council took over responsibility for the established record offices of the counties of London and [[Middlesex]], as well as the former member's library of the London County Council. Together, these became the Greater London Record Office (GLRO) and Library. Although administratively united, the new archive continued to exist at two separate sites, with Middlesex material still held at Dartmouth Street and London material at County Hall (the record office being approximately where the [[London Aquarium]] is now situated). The two archives finally came together in 1979, when the Dartmouth Street site was sold by the GLC, and both archives were housed at County Hall.\n\nIn 1982 the GLRO moved to adapted premises at 40 Northampton Road, Clerkenwell. This site was a former print works, home to the Temple Press. The Press had moved from nearby Roseberry Avenue in August 1939, and continued to use the site until the end of the 1960s.\n\nThe Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, and since that date the archives have been administered by the [[City of London Corporation]]. In the early 1990s work started on a new block adjacent to the site in Northampton Road. This extension conformed to [[BS 5454|archival storage standards]], with [[mobile shelving]] and environmental controls.\n\n===London Metropolitan Archives ===\n[[File:London Metropolitan Archives.jpg|thumb|right|upright|End of repository block, displaying the [[Coat of arms of the City of London|City of London coat of arms]]]]\n\nThe GLRO was renamed the London Metropolitan Archives in 1997.<ref>[https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/london-metropolitan-archives/about/Documents/archive-preservation-and-conservation-policy.pdf \"Archive Preservation and Conservation policy\"], City of London Culture, Heritage and Libraries Department, London Metropolitan Archives, p. 3.</ref>\n\nIn 2005 the archives of the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]] Records Office were moved to the London Metropolitan Archives (LMA) while the Guildhall underwent a vast refurbishment programme. The City of London Corporation is the local government authority for the City of London, the area often referred to as the Square Mile. These archives include the earliest material currently held at LMA, dating from 1067. The archive contains the official records of how the City was governed and developed, through bodies such as the [[Court of Aldermen]] and Court of Common Council and many other official departments like the Chamberlains (which dealt with people being given the freedom of the city). It also contains a large number of records of organisations which the City of London Corporation are responsible for such as the [[City of London Police]], a number of courts and many of the major London markets.\n\nIn 2006 LMA merged with the City of London Libraries and Guildhall Art Gallery to form the City of London Department of Libraries, Archives and Guildhall Art Gallery. Within this department, LMA sits in an administrative group with the [[Guildhall Library]] (a major historical reference library for London, holding printed books, manuscripts and map and print collections), the [[Guildhall Art Gallery]] and [[Keats House]] based at [[Hampstead]], the London home of the poet [[John Keats]]. The department also includes three lending libraries and the City Business Library.\n\n==Collections==\n\nThe records held at the London Metropolitan Archives have been arranged in 17 major classes, of which a number are detailed below. Not all collections are available for consultation. Uncatalogued collections can be made available only by prior appointment made at least 48 hours in advance of the intended visit. Some material is restricted or closed because it contains sensitive information relating to named individuals, other records may require written permission from the depositor before you can view them.\n\n===Associations===\nLMA holds records of many associations all with very different purposes. A large number of records are associations with political purposes such as the London Labour Party, London Liberal Party as well as regional branches of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. The records of associations also include a number of trade unions including the [[National Union of Teachers]] London and Middlesex branches, the Transport Salaried Staff Association and the Union of Post office Workers. Within the field of education there are records of The National Education Association and the London Head Teachers Association.\n\nRecords of pressure groups and campaigning organisations such as the National United Temperance Council and the Royal Society for Checking the Abuses of Public Advertising are also held. One of the larger series of records held are those belonging to the Public Morality Council. Formed in 1899 to combat vice and indecency in London, its members included representatives of all the major religions as well as leaders in education and medicine. The council continued until 1969 concentrating latterly on opposition to sexual immorality and pornography particularly with regards to theatre, cinema, radio and television.\n\nA number of the records relate to groups promoting the arts, sport and recreation. Of particular note are the records of the [[Royal Society of Portrait Painters]], though consultation of these archives, are subject to obtaining written permission. Other records include the Artists League of Great Britain, and The Royal Choral Society. On a more sporting theme, there are records of the London Schools Football Association, the National Amateur Rowing Association and the [[Ramblers Association]].\n\n[[File:Peabody Buildings 1863.jpg|thumb|right|The first block of [[Peabody Trust|Peabody dwellings]] in [[Commercial Street (London)|Commercial Street]], [[Spitalfields]]: a wood-engraving published in 1863, shortly before the building opened]]\nThe Associations series includes the archives of the [[Peabody Trust]]. The trust has its origins in a donation of \u00a3500,000 made by the American philanthropist, [[George Peabody]], for the benefit of the people of London, the city where he had spent most of his adult life. The donation was put into the hands of trustees who were to ensure that it was used to \"ameliorate the condition of the poor\" of London. It was agreed that cheap, clean housing would best fulfil the intention of the gift, and that the Trust would provide an alternative to the [[Model Dwellings Companies]] who operated on a private, less [[philanthropic]] basis. The first housing estate was opened in [[Spitalfields]] in 1864 and consisted of 57 dwellings and 9 shops. Further block estates were built in [[Southwark]], [[Lambeth]], [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], [[Islington]] and [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]].<ref>[http://www.peabody.org.uk/about-us/history/the-early-years-1865-1875.aspx Peabody Trust Peabody Trust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084008/http://www.peabody.org.uk/about-us/history/the-early-years-1865-1875.aspx |date=2011-07-21 }}</ref> The collection includes registers of tenants, photographs, plans and administrative and financial records.\n\n===Businesses===\n\nLMA holds many archives from businesses that operated in the London and Middlesex areas. These are arranged alphabetically by the name of the company. One of the major collections in the series is that of the Predecessors of [[Transport for London|London Transport]]. These include a number of railway companies, particularly the [[Metropolitan Railway]] and many of the London Omnibus Companies, as well as the records of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]], which unified services in the London area for the first time and ran from 1933 to 1948.\n\nAnother important collection is the archives of [[Thames Water]] Predecessors. The archive comprises the records of major institutions that supplied water to the metropolis between 1582 and 1974. Up to 1902 the work was largely carried out by private companies operating under increasing public control as time went on. The records of each company have been catalogued separately except in cases where takeover occurred. The companies include London Bridge Waterworks Company and the [[New River Company]]. In 1902 all the smaller private institutions were taken over by the [[Metropolitan Water Board (London)|Metropolitan Water Board]], which assumed supply responsibilities for an area covering {{convert|576|sqmi|km2}}. The surviving records include corporate material such as board minutes and legal papers, accounts, staff records, engineering and technical files, plans, photos and property records.\n\n[[J. Lyons and Co.]] was founded in 1886 as a catering business for exhibitions in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Glasgow]], Paris and London. By 1894 it had become a public company and it rapidly established a chain of teashops, corner houses and restaurants. This is one of the most intriguing business collections deposited, for as well as all the usual corporate records such as management, finance and administration, the collection is particularly strong in what may be termed ephemera. There are hundreds of photographs starting from as early 1887, a few films and videos, a large collection of press cuttings, advertisements, menus, lithographs and even a [[Nippy]]'s uniform.\n\nBrewers have supplied the metropolis with beer for at least five centuries and by 1700 around 200 common brewers existed. As the industry evolved through acquisitions and competitive means, a hierarchy developed. By 1830 a few large companies dominated, supported by a base of smaller concerns. Several London brewers joined the ranks of England's greatest industrial enterprises and the LMA holds archives of six of those major companies. These include [[Truman, Hanbury, Buxton & Co]] Ltd, [[Courage]], Barclay & Simonds Ltd, [[Watney Combe & Reid|Watney, Combe, Reid, Ltd]], latterly Watney Mann Ltd, and [[Whitbread & Co Ltd]]. The surviving records include administrative and financial records, staff records, property records photographs and ephemera.\n\n===Charities===\n[[Image:Charterhouse Hospital, engraved by Toms, c.1770..jpg|thumb|right|The [[London Charterhouse|Charterhouse]]: an engraving of c.1770]]\nLMA's holdings of charities records date from the early 17th century and include notable foundations such as Archbishop Tenison's Grammar School, the [[Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy]] and [[Sutton's Hospital]] (Charterhouse) which was founded by [[Thomas Sutton]] in 1611 for the benefit of distressed gentlemen and the education of poor boys. Many of the charities are concerned with housing, education and medicine. One of the major collections is that of the [[Charity Organisation Society]], now known as the Family Welfare Association which was formed to make sure that charitable organisations did not overlap with each other in terms of what they were trying to achieve.\n\nAmongst the many archives of housing associations held, are records of the [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]]. The [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]] was the vision and accomplishment of [[Henrietta Barnett]] who together with her husband Canon [[Samuel Augustus Barnett]] set about creating an estate where the working classes could live within pleasant surroundings. The land near [[Hampstead]] was purchased via the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust that she had formed. A total of {{convert|323|acre|km2}} were purchased for \u00a3140,000 by 1907. The idea was that the estate would be aesthetically pleasing consisting of low-density housing and thoroughly planned with a mix of buildings and nature. The community would be served by a range of local amenities including churches, libraries, schools, an institute of education and shops. Henrietta wanted to bring different classes together in one area. Unfortunately though the houses may have been more modest, they were still too expensive for many working-class people. Increased building costs and the shortage of local employment meant that the suburb would become largely middle-class. By 1936 building was virtually complete and the suburb was home to some 16,000 people. The collection is particularly valuable to those interested in the history of planned settlements, architecture and the life and work of [[Henrietta Barnett]]. The archive consists of records of suburb organisations and recreational societies, education institutions and approximately 10,000 plans and 10,000 photographs.\n\nAmong the records of charities are those of the [[Foundling Hospital]], established by Royal charter in 1739 by [[Thomas Coram]] as a refuge for abandoned children. It was the sole institution responsible for taking in illegitimate children in the London area for a period of well over 120 years. Coram had been appalled by the number of dead and dying babies on the streets of London. Admission to the new hospital was at first limited because of lack of funds. Infants were to be less than two months old and in good health. Once a child had been admitted they were baptised and given a new name and boarded out to a dry or wet nurse in the country. On reaching the age of three, they were returned to the hospital to receive basic schooling before eventually being apprenticed out to trades or service or enlisted in the armed forces. From 1760 the mother was required to submit a written petition detailing her circumstances: these documents provide a valuable resource for social history. Other documents include records of the lives of the children, nursing methods, apothecaries' prescriptions, and inspectors' reports. Some parts of the collection have been returned to the Coram family, while more modern files concerned with the [[Berkhamsted]] site are at [[Hertfordshire Archives and Local Studies]].\n\n===City of London Corporation===\n[[File:Thomas Canynges, Lord Mayor 1456\u20131457, in aldermanic robes (c 1450) by Roger Leigh.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Watercolour portrait of [[Thomas Canynges]], [[Lord Mayor of London]] 1456\u20137, held at LMA]]\nThe records that were formerly held by the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]] Record Office and now held at the LMA have been re-catalogued and are now arranged in two distinct sections.\n\nRecords with the prefix COL are the administrative and corporate records of the [[City of London Corporation]]. Included in this section are the repertories, journals and letter books from the courts of [[Aldermen]] and [[Court of Common Council|Common Council]], records of those receiving the [[freedom of the City of London]] from the Chamberlains department as well as numerous plans from the planning and surveyors departments.\n\nRecords with the prefix CLA are deposited collections from organisations and bodies that operate in close association with the City of London Corporation. This series includes records of many of the bridges across the [[Thames]] and particularly [[Tower Bridge]], many markets including [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]], [[Billingsgate]], [[Spitalfields]] and [[Leadenhall]], and a number of courts such as [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] and Guildhall Justice Rooms and Southwark coroner's court. Records of particular interest in this series are the records of the City of London Sessions, these include criminal trials held before the London jury at the [[Old Bailey]]. Another series of particular interest are the records of the [[City of London Police]]. Archives include warrant books, over 95% of all personnel files as well as material relating to the [[Houndsditch murders]] and letters sent to the force concerning [[Jack the Ripper]] and the [[Whitechapel murders]].\n\n===Court records===\n\nThe court records held at LMA are dominated by one of the finest collection of quarter session records known to exist in the country. The records of the [[Middlesex]] and [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] Sessions cover both the judicial and administrative functions of the [[Justices of the Peace]] covering the period 1549\u20131971. These include sessions of gaol delivery for the Middlesex area, held at the [[Old Bailey]] until 1834. Until the 1870s and 1880s the Middlesex Justices were not only responsible for judicial matters in their area, they were also responsible for many of the functions now under the control of local governments. Such roles and responsibilities included county bridges, prisons, lunatic asylums and [[Feltham Industrial School]]. The deposited records also include Land and Hearth tax assessments, electoral registers, licensed victuallers, recognizance's, building surveyors returns, enclosure awards and maps and plans of numerous public undertakings such as canals, docks and railways.\n\nLMA also holds a number of records of the former Inner London police courts. While many of these courts date from the 18th and 19th centuries, the surviving records often only start in the early 20th century. Included in the same section are records of [[petty sessions]], [[magistrates]]' courts and [[county courts]] for London and Middlesex. Some magistrates' courts in the London area are not covered and hold no records of the Crown Courts. Perhaps the most popular series of records in this section are the records of [[coroner]]'s courts. These include the Middlesex area prior to 1889, the London and Middlesex areas from 1889 onwards and the Greater London area after 1965. Unfortunately the survival rate of coroner's records is only about 10%. They are also subject to a closure period of 75 years as opposed to the 30 years on other court records.\n\n===Diocesan records===\n\nThe records of the [[Diocese of London]] have been split between the LMA and the [[Guildhall Library]]. The LMA has records concerning the Consistory Court of London and the Archdeaconry Court of Middlesex. These records include probate material up to 1858, Tithe maps, Bishops Transcripts and Matrimonial and Testamentary Cause Papers.\n\nTo the south of the [[River Thames]], LMA holds records of the [[Diocese of Winchester]] including probate and marriage bonds and allegations from the Archdeaconry Court of Surrey as well as probate from the Commissary Court of Surrey. The LMA also has records of the [[Anglican Diocese of Southwark|Diocese of Southwark]], the Diocese of Guilford and the south-east London part of the [[Diocese of Rochester]].\n\n===Families and estates===\nEstate records held at the LMA include the [[Duke of Bedford]]'s [[Covent Garden]] Estate with many of the records relating to the development of the market. Other major estate records in this series are those of the [[Marquess of Northampton]] at [[Clerkenwell]] and Canonnbury and the Maryon-Wilson estates in [[Hampstead]] and [[Charlton, London|Charlton]]. Notable family collections include those of the [[Marquess of Anglesey]], the Clitherow family of Brentford and the [[Earl of Jersey]], whose papers include correspondence with prominent politicians and literary figures; however, these papers can only be viewed after obtaining written permission from the Head Archivist. The families and Estates series also includes records of over 80 manors, including those owned by [[Charterhouse School]] and [[St Thomas' Hospital]], which covers land extending from Essex to [[Wiltshire]] and [[Yorkshire]].\n\n===Hospitals and health authorities===\n[[File:hanwell asylum.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|right|[[St Bernard's Hospital, Hanwell|London County Asylum]] at Hanwell]]\nLMA holds records for over 80 hospitals and local regional health authorities within the south-east area. The hospital records range from county asylums such as [[St Bernard's Hospital, Hanwell|Hanwell Asylum]] and [[Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum]] to major teaching hospitals like [[Guy's Hospital]] and [[St Thomas' Hospital]] and specialist hospitals like [[Moorfields Eye Hospital]] and Queen Charlotte's Hospital, right down to much smaller local hospitals. Anybody wishing to find out what hospital records are held at the LMA would do well to first consult the hospital records database on the national archives website. The collection of records is not arranged alphabetically as many different hospitals may be covered by one particular management trust, therefore it is worth asking at the reference room desk and they will direct you to the particular binder that you need. It is also worth consulting the 3 leaflets on hospital records that the archive had produced, namely No. 9 \u2013 Sources for the history of nursing, which details the [[Florence Nightingale]] collection among the records of [[St Thomas' Hospital]] \u2013 No. 13, a general guide to hospital records, and No. 15, which is concerned with patients' records. All patients' records among the hospitals collections are subject to data protection laws and may be closed access depending on their date.\n\n===Jewish organisations===\n\nA great number of the Anglo-Jewish community's archives have been deposited at the London Metropolitan Archives, including records of the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]], the Office of the Chief Rabbi, the [[Beth Din]], the federation of Synagogues and the [[United Synagogue]]. The collections contain only a small number of sources useful to those studying their Jewish Family History, particular sources are the records from the Jewish Temporary Shelter and those of the Jewish Free School which is said to have educated one third of all the Jewish community in London. The majority of records from the various Jewish Organisations are concerned with subject and policy decisions and most require written permission from the depositor before access can be granted.\n\n===London local authorities===\n\nTwo very important series of records have been classified under the heading London Local Authorities. The first of these, are the records of the [[Boards of Guardians]] of the [[Poor Law Unions]] for London and [[Middlesex]]. Poor Law Unions were formed as a result of the new [[English Poor Laws|Poor Law]] amendment act of 1834, when neighbouring parishes joined together to pool their resources, each of these unions would be administered by a Board of Guardians. The records consist primarily of general minutes of the board, administrative records including details of staff, settlement examinations, orders of removal, [[workhouse]] and [[wikt:infirmary|infirmary]] records and school records. The records are arranged by each individual board although the amount of surviving material varies from board to board. The majority of material is from the period 1850 to 1930.\n\nThe other major collection in this series, are the records of the Middlesex Deeds Register. By  the [[Middlesex Registry Act 1708]] a registry was established for the registration of all [[deed]]s, [[Conveyancing|conveyances]], [[Will (law)|wills]], [[encumbrance]]s etc., affecting freehold land and leased land for periods of 21 years or more, within the ancient county of Middlesex. In 1862 the national land register was introduced on a voluntary basis. In 1899 it became compulsory for land in the new area of North London that was formally Middlesex to be registered nationally. This dramatically reduced the amount of entries to the Middlesex Deeds Register, though it continued to serve the outer part of Middlesex until 1938 when all land within Middlesex had to be registered through the national land register. Deeds and documents brought to the registry were copied onto pieces of parchment called memorials and then bound into large volumes or registers. The documents are not complete copies of the originals and certain information such as covenants and other restrictions may be missing. Information entered includes date of the transaction, names of the parties and a description of the property. From the mid-19th century this also often included a plan of the property.\n\n===London-wide elected bodies===\nAs well as the archives of the [[London County Council]], [[Middlesex County Council]], [[Greater London Council]], [[Inner London Education Authority]] and the [[London Residuary Body]], the LMA also hold records of their 19th- and 20th-century predecessors such as the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]], [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers]], [[London School Board]] and the [[Metropolitan Asylums Board]]. The records of these bodies are as broad as the functions of modern local government, with documentation on education, housing, health services, welfare, transport, building regulations, drainage, culture and leisure. Many of the different bodies include a series of indexed committee minutes, which often prove to be a valuable starting point when attempting to access the records.\n\n===Maps===\n\nThe LMA has an extensive collection of maps numbering over 15,000. Many of the maps are split up amongst the various different collections for example tithes maps found amongst the diocesan records and enclosure maps found amongst court records. Fortunately there is a single card catalogue that combines all of the maps from the various collections and has listed them by the area they cover. Twenty of the most popular maps held by the LMA are accessible in the map cabinet in the reference room. These include the first edition of the [[Ordnance Survey]] for London 1867\u201370 and the Second World War Bomb damage maps.\n\n===National records===\n\nIncluded in this series are records of the [[British Waterways Board]] particularly concerning the [[River Lea]], plans of National Schools in Middlesex and the London Region of [[English Heritage]] that took over many of the files and plans of the former [[Greater London Council]] Historic Buildings Division. Also featuring in the series of National Records are the archives of [[Wandsworth (HM Prison)]] and [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)]]. Of the two prisons the Wandsworth records are much more extensive, including administrative and staff records, photographs and prisoners records from 1879. For Wormwood Scrubs the majority of records concern prisoners and begin in 1917.\n\n===Non-established religions===\nThe majority of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] records at LMA relate to the [[Congregationalist]], [[Baptist]], United Reformed and [[Methodist]] churches, circuits and missions dating predominantly from the 19th and 20th centuries. Some records of a few German churches are held, and some recent marriage registers from a [[Salvation Army]] citadel, a [[Seventh-Day Adventist]] church, the [[Kingdom Hall]], Wandsworth and a [[Sikh]] [[Gurdwara]]. As well as [[baptism]], marriage and [[burial]] records from individual nonconformist churches, records of several nonconformist organisations such as the London Congregational Union and the New Bunhill Fields Burial Ground are held. The LMA holds no [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] records, which are usually retained by the individual church.\n\n===Parishes===\n\nLMA holds records of more than 700 [[Anglican]] churches in the London and [[Middlesex]] areas. The types of records held vary from [[parish]] to [[parish]], with some parishes only depositing registers of [[baptisms]], marriage and [[burials]]. Other parishes, however, have deposited a great deal more and the types of records include [[vestry]] minutes, [[churchwarden]] accounts, parish [[poor rate]] and early [[workhouse]] material, parish magazines, plans, photographs and other ephemera.\n\nFor those interested in parish records, researchers should be aware that for certain areas of London, the LMA will not be the likely place records would be deposited. For those interested in the parish registers of the ancient City of London within the walls, these will be found at the Guildhall Library. Similarly churches within the ancient city of Westminster will deposit their records at the City of Westminster Archives. This will include parishes such as [[St Martin in the Fields (parish)|Saint Martin in the Fields]], Saint James Piccadilly, [[St Clement Danes (parish)|Saint Clement Danes]] and Saint George Hanover Square. The final areas that would not deposit their records at the LMA are the modern London Boroughs that prior to the formation of the Greater London Council in 1964 would have been part of the former counties of Essex, Kent and Surrey. For each of these areas researchers should consult either their local borough archive or the respective ancient county record office.\n\n===Photograph collection===\n[[File:Boundary Street 1890.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boundary Estate|Boundary Street]], [[Shoreditch]], photographed in 1890, shortly before it was redeveloped in a slum clearance scheme: from the LMA collections]]\nThe LMA photograph collection contains almost half a million photographs covering the history and topography of London, especially the inner London area. The majority of photos were taken for official purposes by and for the London County Council and Greater London Council. The collection is arranged in two sections. The first section is arranged by alphabetically by subject covering everything from Abbeys to Zoological Gardens. Particularly well covered are subjects such as schools, housing estates, parks, bridges, churches, cinemas, theatres, hospitals, pubs and areas of war damage. The second section is arranged alphabetically by modern London borough and then alphabetically by address.\n\n===Prints and drawings===\n\nThe prints and drawings collection is similarly arranged to the photograph collection, with a greater focus on the inner London areas. It is also arranged both topographically and by subject. Most of the prints and drawings date from the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\n===Video===\nThe LMA holds many films produced by bodies including London Transport, the Greater London Council and the Corporation of London. Some of these films are accessible on YouTube.\n\n==The library==\nThe LMA library started as the library of the former members of the London County council. It contains over 100,000 volumes and specialises in all aspects of London life, the growth and development of the area, its history and organisation of Local Government. The library is purely a reference library. A search of the archive's stock of records can be done online by accessing the LMA website and navigating the londonGenerations search tool.\n\nAlthough many records (in particular the parish registers of Greater London) are stored on microfiche, there is a digitisation programme which is ongoing. The aim is to digitally store parish records, Poor Law documents, and school admission records up to 1911. An estimated 77 million people will be referenced by these documents.\n\nIt will be possible for visitors to view this data at no cost on terminals in the library. It will likewise be possible to view this data at home via the internet for a fee, via the website ancestry co uk, with the first stage going live in early 2009.\n\nAccording to a leaflet from the LMA (made available in September 2008):\n\n:It is anticipated that the full digitisation and indexing programme will include: Parish baptisms, marriages and burials; Bishops' transcripts; Parish Poor Law records; Boards of Guardians records; Diocesan marriage bonds and allegations; Non-conformist baptisms, marriages and burials; School admission and discharge registers; Electoral registers, overseers returns and poll books; Land Tax records; Wills; City of London Freedoms; Middlesex Sessions - Transportation Contracts; Consistory Court of London Matrimonial and Testamentary Papers.\n\nDigitised parish records went online on 16 September 2009, as an alternative to microfiche searches. Digitised electoral rolls, for the period 1835 to 1965, went online on 11 January 2012.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|London Metropolitan Archives}}\n*{{official|https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/london-metropolitan-archives/Pages/default.aspx}}\n\n{{London history}}\n\n{{Coord|51|31|31.49|N|0|6|26.95|W|scale:1563_region:GB|display=title}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Archives in London]]\n[[Category:Genealogical libraries]]\n[[Category:History organisations based in London]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Islington]]\n[[Category:County record offices in England]]\n[[Category:City archives]]\n[[Category:City of London Corporation]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:London Metropolitan Archives front.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.4|London Metropolitan Archives: main building and entrance]]\nThe '''London Metropolitan Archives''' ('''LMA''') is the principal local government [[archive|archive repository]] for the [[Greater London]] area, including the [[City of London]]: it is the largest [[county record office]] in the United Kingdom. It was established under its present name in 1997, having previously been known as the '''Greater London Record Office'''. It is administered and financed by the [[City of London Corporation]].\n\nThe archive is based at 40 Northampton Road, [[Clerkenwell]], London. It attracts over 30,000 visitors a year and deals with a similar number of written enquiries. LMA's extensive holdings amount to over 72 miles of records of local, regional and national importance. With the earliest record dating from 1067, the archive charts the development of the capital into a modern-day major world city.\n\n==History==\nLondon Metropolitan Archives in its current form is essentially an amalgamation of four separate bodies. The first three were the London County Record Office, the London County Council Members Library and the Middlesex County Record Office, which merged in 1965 to form the Greater London Record Office and History Library (GLRO). The GLRO was rebranded as London Metropolitan Archives in 1997, and took over the former [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]] Record Office (CLRO) in 2005.\n\n===London County Record Office===\nUntil 1889, London was still the area within the walled city; to the south of the river was [[Surrey]] and [[Kent]] and to the north of the city's limits was [[Middlesex]]. These areas, however, had become densely populated and, given the sphere of influence of the city, traditional boundaries were no longer practical. The County of London was created and controlled by the newly formed [[London County Council]], which took over many of the duties of its predecessor the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]]. It was the records of these bodies and similar groups such as the [[London School Board]] and [[Metropolitan Asylums Board]] that would form the nucleus of the London County Record offices holdings, which were based at County Hall on the south bank of the [[River Thames]].\n\nAs well as the official records that the council generated, they also began to accept deposits of records fundamental to London's history, such as copies of memorials from the Middlesex deeds register, diocesan and parish records and records of charities such as the [[Foundling Hospital]]. Under the [[Public Records Act 1958]], the record office became recognised as a place of deposit for public records.\n\nSince the creation of the London County Council there had been a record keeper in the Clerks Department who held custody of the documents. By the 1930s they had established individual departmental record rooms staffed by record assistants working under the general supervision of the Record Keeper. Finally in 1953 the position of Head Archivist and Librarian was created.\n\n===London County Council Members Library===\n\nThe library was originally that of the members of the London County Council and reflected their interests. Situated in the same building as the London County Record Office, the library was added to with books on the history and topography of London. The library also included a rich collection of maps, prints, drawings and photographs.\n\n===Middlesex County Record Office===\nNo single act or resolution marked the beginning of the Middlesex County Record Office. Like most other county record offices it developed naturally from the duty of the [[Clerk of the Peace]] to preserve certain records from the [[Quarter Sessions]], together with other records such as enclosure awards and plans of public utilities. The first significant period in the formation of the county record office was in the early 1880s when a special committee was appointed by the [[justices of the peace]] to consider and report on the accommodation provided for the storage of the \"old records\" of the county. On behalf of the committee, [[John Cordy Jeaffreson]], an inspector of the [[Historical Manuscripts Commission]], sorted the records covering 1549\u20131820 into 87 classes comprising more than 10,000 volumes and nearly 5000 rolls. The more modern records from post-1820 were given a separate room.\n\nThe formation of the London County Council in 1889 had seen the County of [[Middlesex]] much reduced in size. In 1893 when the Middlesex sessions papers were to be moved from the sessions house in [[Clerkenwell]] (an area that was previously Middlesex but now London) an argument broke out between the two [[county councils]] as to who should have responsibility for the material. This protracted dispute lasted some five years, with a high court judge eventually deciding in favour of Middlesex.\n\nAround the same time, a [[Middlesex County Council]] act empowered the council to spend money preserving, arranging, indexing, classifying and publishing such records of the county that may be in the public interest. In 1913 the new [[Middlesex Guildhall]] at [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] opened and was equipped with specially constructed muniment rooms, with an assistant to arrange and supervise their transfer from temporary storage. It was not until 1923 that a full-time graduate assistant was placed in charge of dealing with things such as document repair, storage issues, written enquiries, production of documents for public researchers and receipt of any gifts or deposits.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the work of the county record office expanded steadily, with the appointment of a County [[Archivist]], first in a part-time capacity (Colonel [[William Le Hardy]]), then full-time from 1957. By then, the archive had also moved to new premises at 1 Queen Anne's Gate Buildings, Dartmouth Street. In 1960 the record office was appointed an official place of deposit by the [[Lord Chancellor]] under section 4 (1) of the [[Public Records Act 1958]]. After this, the archive increased its holdings, with significant deposits of [[petty sessions]], coroners, Boards of Guardians and other official material. By this time, the record office had acquired an extensive reference library on the topography of Middlesex, as well as a great number of maps, prints and photographs.\n\n===The Greater London Record Office ===\n[[File:London Metropolitan Archives repository.JPG|thumb|right|1990s repository block]]\n\nUnder the Local [[London Government Act 1963]], which came into effect on 1 April 1965, the administrative counties of London and Middlesex together with their respective county councils were abolished. They were replaced by the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) which administered a much wider area known as [[Greater London]]. The formation of Greater London also meant that some areas that had been previously part of [[Kent]], [[Surrey]], [[Essex]] and [[Hertfordshire]], were also now included. However, to minimise confusion, it was agreed that records from these areas should remain within their ancient county.\n\nThe Greater London Council took over responsibility for the established record offices of the counties of London and [[Middlesex]], as well as the former member's library of the London County Council. Together, these became the Greater London Record Office (GLRO) and Library. Although administratively united, the new archive continued to exist at two separate sites, with Middlesex material still held at Dartmouth Street and London material at County Hall (the record office being approximately where the [[London Aquarium]] is now situated). The two archives finally came together in 1979, when the Dartmouth Street site was sold by the GLC, and both archives were housed at County Hall.\n\nIn 1982 the GLRO moved to adapted premises at 40 Northampton Road, Clerkenwell. This site was a former print works, home to the Temple Press. The Press had moved from nearby Roseberry Avenue in August 1939, and continued to use the site until the end of the 1960s.\n\nThe Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, and since that date the archives have been administered by the [[City of London Corporation]]. In the early 1990s work started on a new block adjacent to the site in Northampton Road. This extension conformed to [[BS 5454|archival storage standards]], with [[mobile shelving]] and environmental controls.\n\n===London Metropolitan Archives ===\n[[File:London Metropolitan Archives.jpg|thumb|right|upright|End of repository block, displaying the [[Coat of arms of the City of London|City of London coat of arms]]]]\n\nThe GLRO was renamed the London Metropolitan Archives in 1997.<ref>[https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/london-metropolitan-archives/about/Documents/archive-preservation-and-conservation-policy.pdf \"Archive Preservation and Conservation policy\"], City of London Culture, Heritage and Libraries Department, London Metropolitan Archives, p. 3.</ref>\n\nIn 2005 the archives of the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]] Records Office were moved to the London Metropolitan Archives (LMA) while the Guildhall underwent a vast refurbishment programme. The City of London Corporation is the local government authority for the City of London, the area often referred to as the Square Mile. These archives include the earliest material currently held at LMA, dating from 1067. The archive contains the official records of how the City was governed and developed, through bodies such as the [[Court of Aldermen]] and Court of Common Council and many other official departments like the Chamberlains (which dealt with people being given the freedom of the city). It also contains a large number of records of organisations which the City of London Corporation are responsible for such as the [[City of London Police]], a number of courts and many of the major London markets.\n\nIn 2006 LMA merged with the City of London Libraries and Guildhall Art Gallery to form the City of London Department of Libraries, Archives and Guildhall Art Gallery. Within this department, LMA sits in an administrative group with the [[Guildhall Library]] (a major historical reference library for London, holding printed books, manuscripts and map and print collections), the [[Guildhall Art Gallery]] and [[Keats House]] based at [[Hampstead]], the London home of the poet [[John Keats]]. The department also includes three lending libraries and the City Business Library.\n\n==Collections==\n\nThe records held at the London Metropolitan Archives have been arranged in 17 major classes, of which a number are detailed below. Not all collections are available for consultation. Uncatalogued collections can be made available only by prior appointment made at least 48 hours in advance of the intended visit. Some material is restricted or closed because it contains sensitive information relating to named individuals, other records may require written permission from the depositor before you can view them.\n\n===Associations===\nLMA holds records of many associations all with very different purposes. A large number of records are associations with political purposes such as the London Labour Party, London Liberal Party as well as regional branches of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. The records of associations also include a number of trade unions including the [[National Union of Teachers]] London and Middlesex branches, the Transport Salaried Staff Association and the Union of Post office Workers. Within the field of education there are records of The National Education Association and the London Head Teachers Association.\n\nRecords of pressure groups and campaigning organisations such as the National United Temperance Council and the Royal Society for Checking the Abuses of Public Advertising are also held. One of the larger series of records held are those belonging to the Public Morality Council. Formed in 1899 to combat vice and indecency in London, its members included representatives of all the major religions as well as leaders in education and medicine. The council continued until 1969 concentrating latterly on opposition to sexual immorality and pornography particularly with regards to theatre, cinema, radio and television.\n\nA number of the records relate to groups promoting the arts, sport and recreation. Of particular note are the records of the [[Royal Society of Portrait Painters]], though consultation of these archives, are subject to obtaining written permission. Other records include the Artists League of Great Britain, and The Royal Choral Society. On a more sporting theme, there are records of the London Schools Football Association, the National Amateur Rowing Association and the [[Ramblers Association]].\n\n[[File:Peabody Buildings 1863.jpg|thumb|right|The first block of [[Peabody Trust|Peabody dwellings]] in [[Commercial Street (London)|Commercial Street]], [[Spitalfields]]: a wood-engraving published in 1863, shortly before the building opened]]\nThe Associations series includes the archives of the [[Peabody Trust]]. The trust has its origins in a donation of \u00a3500,000 made by the American philanthropist, [[George Peabody]], for the benefit of the people of London, the city where he had spent most of his adult life. The donation was put into the hands of trustees who were to ensure that it was used to \"ameliorate the condition of the poor\" of London. It was agreed that cheap, clean housing would best fulfil the intention of the gift, and that the Trust would provide an alternative to the [[Model Dwellings Companies]] who operated on a private, less [[philanthropic]] basis. The first housing estate was opened in [[Spitalfields]] in 1864 and consisted of 57 dwellings and 9 shops. Further block estates were built in [[Southwark]], [[Lambeth]], [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], [[Islington]] and [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]].<ref>[http://www.peabody.org.uk/about-us/history/the-early-years-1865-1875.aspx Peabody Trust Peabody Trust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084008/http://www.peabody.org.uk/about-us/history/the-early-years-1865-1875.aspx |date=2011-07-21 }}</ref> The collection includes registers of tenants, photographs, plans and administrative and financial records.\n\n===Businesses===\n\nLMA holds many archives from businesses that operated in the London and Middlesex areas. These are arranged alphabetically by the name of the company. One of the major collections in the series is that of the Predecessors of [[Transport for London|London Transport]]. These include a number of railway companies, particularly the [[Metropolitan Railway]] and many of the London Omnibus Companies, as well as the records of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]], which unified services in the London area for the first time and ran from 1933 to 1948.\n\nAnother important collection is the archives of [[Thames Water]] Predecessors. The archive comprises the records of major institutions that supplied water to the metropolis between 1582 and 1974. Up to 1902 the work was largely carried out by private companies operating under increasing public control as time went on. The records of each company have been catalogued separately except in cases where takeover occurred. The companies include London Bridge Waterworks Company and the [[New River Company]]. In 1902 all the smaller private institutions were taken over by the [[Metropolitan Water Board (London)|Metropolitan Water Board]], which assumed supply responsibilities for an area covering {{convert|576|sqmi|km2}}. The surviving records include corporate material such as board minutes and legal papers, accounts, staff records, engineering and technical files, plans, photos and property records.\n\n[[J. Lyons and Co.]] was founded in 1886 as a catering business for exhibitions in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Glasgow]], Paris and London. By 1894 it had become a public company and it rapidly established a chain of teashops, corner houses and restaurants. This is one of the most intriguing business collections deposited, for as well as all the usual corporate records such as management, finance and administration, the collection is particularly strong in what may be termed ephemera. There are hundreds of photographs starting from as early 1887, a few films and videos, a large collection of press cuttings, advertisements, menus, lithographs and even a [[Nippy]]'s uniform.\n\nBrewers have supplied the metropolis with beer for at least five centuries and by 1700 around 200 common brewers existed. As the industry evolved through acquisitions and competitive means, a hierarchy developed. By 1830 a few large companies dominated, supported by a base of smaller concerns. Several London brewers joined the ranks of England's greatest industrial enterprises and the LMA holds archives of six of those major companies. These include [[Truman, Hanbury, Buxton & Co]] Ltd, [[Courage]], Barclay & Simonds Ltd, [[Watney Combe & Reid|Watney, Combe, Reid, Ltd]], latterly Watney Mann Ltd, and [[Whitbread & Co Ltd]]. The surviving records include administrative and financial records, staff records, property records photographs and ephemera.\n\n===Charities===\n[[Image:Charterhouse Hospital, engraved by Toms, c.1770..jpg|thumb|right|The [[London Charterhouse|Charterhouse]]: an engraving of c.1770]]\nLMA's holdings of charities records date from the early 17th century and include notable foundations such as Archbishop Tenison's Grammar School, the [[Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy]] and [[Sutton's Hospital]] (Charterhouse) which was founded by [[Thomas Sutton]] in 1611 for the benefit of distressed gentlemen and the education of poor boys. Many of the charities are concerned with housing, education and medicine. One of the major collections is that of the [[Charity Organisation Society]], now known as the Family Welfare Association which was formed to make sure that charitable organisations did not overlap with each other in terms of what they were trying to achieve.\n\nAmongst the many archives of housing associations held, are records of the [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]]. The [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]] was the vision and accomplishment of [[Henrietta Barnett]] who together with her husband Canon [[Samuel Augustus Barnett]] set about creating an estate where the working classes could live within pleasant surroundings. The land near [[Hampstead]] was purchased via the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust that she had formed. A total of {{convert|323|acre|km2}} were purchased for \u00a3140,000 by 1907. The idea was that the estate would be aesthetically pleasing consisting of low-density housing and thoroughly planned with a mix of buildings and nature. The community would be served by a range of local amenities including churches, libraries, schools, an institute of education and shops. Henrietta wanted to bring different classes together in one area. Unfortunately though the houses may have been more modest, they were still too expensive for many working-class people. Increased building costs and the shortage of local employment meant that the suburb would become largely middle-class. By 1936 building was virtually complete and the suburb was home to some 16,000 people. The collection is particularly valuable to those interested in the history of planned settlements, architecture and the life and work of [[Henrietta Barnett]]. The archive consists of records of suburb organisations and recreational societies, education institutions and approximately 10,000 plans and 10,000 photographs.\n\nAmong the records of charities are those of the [[Foundling Hospital]], established by Royal charter in 1739 by [[Thomas Coram]] as a refuge for abandoned children. It was the sole institution responsible for taking in illegitimate children in the London area for a period of well over 120 years. Coram had been appalled by the number of dead and dying babies on the streets of London. Admission to the new hospital was at first limited because of lack of funds. Infants were to be less than two months old and in good health. Once a child had been admitted they were baptised and given a new name and boarded out to a dry or wet nurse in the country. On reaching the age of three, they were returned to the hospital to receive basic schooling before eventually being apprenticed out to trades or service or enlisted in the armed forces. From 1760 the mother was required to submit a written petition detailing her circumstances: these documents provide a valuable resource for social history. Other documents include records of the lives of the children, nursing methods, apothecaries' prescriptions, and inspectors' reports. Some parts of the collection have been returned to the Coram family, while more modern files concerned with the [[Berkhamsted]] site are at [[Hertfordshire Archives and Local Studies]].\n\n===City of London Corporation===\n[[File:Thomas Canynges, Lord Mayor 1456\u20131457, in aldermanic robes (c 1450) by Roger Leigh.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Watercolour portrait of [[Thomas Canynges]], [[Lord Mayor of London]] 1456\u20137, held at LMA]]\nThe records that were formerly held by the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]] Record Office and now held at the LMA have been re-catalogued and are now arranged in two distinct sections.\n\nRecords with the prefix COL are the administrative and corporate records of the [[City of London Corporation]]. Included in this section are the repertories, journals and letter books from the courts of [[Aldermen]] and [[Court of Common Council|Common Council]], records of those receiving the [[freedom of the City of London]] from the Chamberlains department as well as numerous plans from the planning and surveyors departments.\n\nRecords with the prefix CLA are deposited collections from organisations and bodies that operate in close association with the City of London Corporation. This series includes records of many of the bridges across the [[Thames]] and particularly [[Tower Bridge]], many markets including [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]], [[Billingsgate]], [[Spitalfields]] and [[Leadenhall]], and a number of courts such as [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] and Guildhall Justice Rooms and Southwark coroner's court. Records of particular interest in this series are the records of the City of London Sessions, these include criminal trials held before the London jury at the [[Old Bailey]]. Another series of particular interest are the records of the [[City of London Police]]. Archives include warrant books, over 95% of all personnel files as well as material relating to the [[Houndsditch murders]] and letters sent to the force concerning [[Jack the Ripper]] and the [[Whitechapel murders]].\n\n===Court records===\n\nThe court records held at LMA are dominated by one of the finest collection of quarter session records known to exist in the country. The records of the [[Middlesex]] and [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] Sessions cover both the judicial and administrative functions of the [[Justices of the Peace]] covering the period 1549\u20131971. These include sessions of gaol delivery for the Middlesex area, held at the [[Old Bailey]] until 1834. Until the 1870s and 1880s the Middlesex Justices were not only responsible for judicial matters in their area, they were also responsible for many of the functions now under the control of local governments. Such roles and responsibilities included county bridges, prisons, lunatic asylums and [[Feltham Industrial School]]. The deposited records also include Land and Hearth tax assessments, electoral registers, licensed victuallers, recognizance's, building surveyors returns, enclosure awards and maps and plans of numerous public undertakings such as canals, docks and railways.\n\nLMA also holds a number of records of the former Inner London police courts. While many of these courts date from the 18th and 19th centuries, the surviving records often only start in the early 20th century. Included in the same section are records of [[petty sessions]], [[magistrates]]' courts and [[county courts]] for London and Middlesex. Some magistrates' courts in the London area are not covered and hold no records of the Crown Courts. Perhaps the most popular series of records in this section are the records of [[coroner]]'s courts. These include the Middlesex area prior to 1889, the London and Middlesex areas from 1889 onwards and the Greater London area after 1965. Unfortunately the survival rate of coroner's records is only about 10%. They are also subject to a closure period of 75 years as opposed to the 30 years on other court records.\n\n===Diocesan records===\n\nThe records of the [[Diocese of London]] have been split between the LMA and the [[Guildhall Library]]. The LMA has records concerning the Consistory Court of London and the Archdeaconry Court of Middlesex. These records include probate material up to 1858, Tithe maps, Bishops Transcripts and Matrimonial and Testamentary Cause Papers.\n\nTo the south of the [[River Thames]], LMA holds records of the [[Diocese of Winchester]] including probate and marriage bonds and allegations from the Archdeaconry Court of Surrey as well as probate from the Commissary Court of Surrey. The LMA also has records of the [[Anglican Diocese of Southwark|Diocese of Southwark]], the Diocese of Guilford and the south-east London part of the [[Diocese of Rochester]].\n\n===Families and estates===\nEstate records held at the LMA include the [[Duke of Bedford]]'s [[Covent Garden]] Estate with many of the records relating to the development of the market. Other major estate records in this series are those of the [[Marquess of Northampton]] at [[Clerkenwell]] and Canonnbury and the Maryon-Wilson estates in [[Hampstead]] and [[Charlton, London|Charlton]]. Notable family collections include those of the [[Marquess of Anglesey]], the Clitherow family of Brentford and the [[Earl of Jersey]], whose papers include correspondence with prominent politicians and literary figures; however, these papers can only be viewed after obtaining written permission from the Head Archivist. The families and Estates series also includes records of over 80 manors, including those owned by [[Charterhouse School]] and [[St Thomas' Hospital]], which covers land extending from Essex to [[Wiltshire]] and [[Yorkshire]].\n\n===Hospitals and health authorities===\n[[File:hanwell asylum.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|right|[[St Bernard's Hospital, Hanwell|London County Asylum]] at Hanwell]]\nLMA holds records for over 80 hospitals and local regional health authorities within the south-east area. The hospital records range from county asylums such as [[St Bernard's Hospital, Hanwell|Hanwell Asylum]] and [[Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum]] to major teaching hospitals like [[Guy's Hospital]] and [[St Thomas' Hospital]] and specialist hospitals like [[Moorfields Eye Hospital]] and Queen Charlotte's Hospital, right down to much smaller local hospitals. Anybody wishing to find out what hospital records are held at the LMA would do well to first consult the hospital records database on the national archives website. The collection of records is not arranged alphabetically as many different hospitals may be covered by one particular management trust, therefore it is worth asking at the reference room desk and they will direct you to the particular binder that you need. It is also worth consulting the 3 leaflets on hospital records that the archive had produced, namely No. 9 \u2013 Sources for the history of nursing, which details the [[Florence Nightingale]] collection among the records of [[St Thomas' Hospital]] \u2013 No. 13, a general guide to hospital records, and No. 15, which is concerned with patients' records. All patients' records among the hospitals collections are subject to data protection laws and may be closed access depending on their date.\n\n===Jewish organisations===\n\nA great number of the Anglo-Jewish community's archives have been deposited at the London Metropolitan Archives, including records of the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]], the Office of the Chief Rabbi, the [[Beth Din]], the federation of Synagogues and the [[United Synagogue]]. The collections contain only a small number of sources useful to those studying their Jewish Family History, particular sources are the records from the Jewish Temporary Shelter and those of the Jewish Free School which is said to have educated one third of all the Jewish community in London. The majority of records from the various Jewish Organisations are concerned with subject and policy decisions and most require written permission from the depositor before access can be granted.\n\n===London local authorities===\n\nTwo very important series of records have been classified under the heading London Local Authorities. The first of these, are the records of the [[Boards of Guardians]] of the [[Poor Law Unions]] for London and [[Middlesex]]. Poor Law Unions were formed as a result of the new [[English Poor Laws|Poor Law]] amendment act of 1834, when neighbouring parishes joined together to pool their resources, each of these unions would be administered by a Board of Guardians. The records consist primarily of general minutes of the board, administrative records including details of staff, settlement examinations, orders of removal, [[workhouse]] and [[wikt:infirmary|infirmary]] records and school records. The records are arranged by each individual board although the amount of surviving material varies from board to board. The majority of material is from the period 1850 to 1930.\n\nThe other major collection in this series, are the records of the Middlesex Deeds Register. By  the [[Middlesex Registry Act 1708]] a registry was established for the registration of all [[deed]]s, [[Conveyancing|conveyances]], [[Will (law)|wills]], [[encumbrance]]s etc., affecting freehold land and leased land for periods of 21 years or more, within the ancient county of Middlesex. In 1862 the national land register was introduced on a voluntary basis. In 1899 it became compulsory for land in the new area of North London that was formally Middlesex to be registered nationally. This dramatically reduced the amount of entries to the Middlesex Deeds Register, though it continued to serve the outer part of Middlesex until 1938 when all land within Middlesex had to be registered through the national land register. Deeds and documents brought to the registry were copied onto pieces of parchment called memorials and then bound into large volumes or registers. The documents are not complete copies of the originals and certain information such as covenants and other restrictions may be missing. Information entered includes date of the transaction, names of the parties and a description of the property. From the mid-19th century this also often included a plan of the property.\n\n===London-wide elected bodies===\nAs well as the archives of the [[London County Council]], [[Middlesex County Council]], [[Greater London Council]], [[Inner London Education Authority]] and the [[London Residuary Body]], the LMA also hold records of their 19th- and 20th-century predecessors such as the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]], [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers]], [[London School Board]] and the [[Metropolitan Asylums Board]]. The records of these bodies are as broad as the functions of modern local government, with documentation on education, housing, health services, welfare, transport, building regulations, drainage, culture and leisure. Many of the different bodies include a series of indexed committee minutes, which often prove to be a valuable starting point when attempting to access the records.\n\n===Maps===\n\nThe LMA has an extensive collection of maps numbering over 15,000. Many of the maps are split up amongst the various different collections for example tithes maps found amongst the diocesan records and enclosure maps found amongst court records. Fortunately there is a single card catalogue that combines all of the maps from the various collections and has listed them by the area they cover. Twenty of the most popular maps held by the LMA are accessible in the map cabinet in the reference room. These include the first edition of the [[Ordnance Survey]] for London 1867\u201370 and the Second World War Bomb damage maps.\n\n===National records===\n\nIncluded in this series are records of the [[British Waterways Board]] particularly concerning the [[River Lea]], plans of National Schools in Middlesex and the London Region of [[English Heritage]] that took over many of the files and plans of the former [[Greater London Council]] Historic Buildings Division. Also featuring in the series of National Records are the archives of [[Wandsworth (HM Prison)]] and [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)]]. Of the two prisons the Wandsworth records are much more extensive, including administrative and staff records, photographs and prisoners records from 1879. For Wormwood Scrubs the majority of records concern prisoners and begin in 1917.\n\n===Non-established religions===\nThe majority of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] records at LMA relate to the [[Congregationalist]], [[Baptist]], United Reformed and [[Methodist]] churches, circuits and missions dating predominantly from the 19th and 20th centuries. Some records of a few German churches are held, and some recent marriage registers from a [[Salvation Army]] citadel, a [[Seventh-Day Adventist]] church, the [[Kingdom Hall]], Wandsworth and a [[Sikh]] [[Gurdwara]]. As well as [[baptism]], marriage and [[burial]] records from individual nonconformist churches, records of several nonconformist organisations such as the London Congregational Union and the New Bunhill Fields Burial Ground are held. The LMA holds no [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] records, which are usually retained by the individual church.\n\n===Parishes===\n\nLMA holds records of more than 700 [[Anglican]] churches in the London and [[Middlesex]] areas. The types of records held vary from [[parish]] to [[parish]], with some parishes only depositing registers of [[baptisms]], marriage and [[burials]]. Other parishes, however, have deposited a great deal more and the types of records include [[vestry]] minutes, [[churchwarden]] accounts, parish [[poor rate]] and early [[workhouse]] material, parish magazines, plans, photographs and other ephemera.\n\nFor those interested in parish records, researchers should be aware that for certain areas of London, the LMA will not be the likely place records would be deposited. For those interested in the parish registers of the ancient City of London within the walls, these will be found at the Guildhall Library. Similarly churches within the ancient city of Westminster will deposit their records at the City of Westminster Archives. This will include parishes such as [[St Martin in the Fields (parish)|Saint Martin in the Fields]], Saint James Piccadilly, [[St Clement Danes (parish)|Saint Clement Danes]] and Saint George Hanover Square. The final areas that would not deposit their records at the LMA are the modern London Boroughs that prior to the formation of the Greater London Council in 1964 would have been part of the former counties of Essex, Kent and Surrey. For each of these areas researchers should consult either their local borough archive or the respective ancient county record office.\n\n===Photograph collection===\n[[File:Boundary Street 1890.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boundary Estate|Boundary Street]], [[Shoreditch]], photographed in 1890, shortly before it was redeveloped in a slum clearance scheme: from the LMA collections]]\nThe LMA photograph collection contains almost half a million photographs covering the history and topography of London, especially the inner London area. The majority of photos were taken for official purposes by and for the London County Council and Greater London Council. The collection is arranged in two sections. The first section is arranged by alphabetically by subject covering everything from Abbeys to Zoological Gardens. Particularly well covered are subjects such as schools, housing estates, parks, bridges, churches, cinemas, theatres, hospitals, pubs and areas of war damage. The second section is arranged alphabetically by modern London borough and then alphabetically by address.\n\n===Prints and drawings===\n\nThe prints and drawings collection is similarly arranged to the photograph collection, with a greater focus on the inner London areas. It is also arranged both topographically and by subject. Most of the prints and drawings date from the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\n===Video===\nThe LMA holds many films produced by bodies including London Transport, the Greater London Council and the Corporation of London. Some of these films are accessible on YouTube.\n\n==The library==\nThe LMA library started as the library of the former members of the London County council. It contains over 100,000 volumes and specialises in all aspects of London life, the growth and development of the area, its history and organisation of Local Government. The library is purely a reference library. A search of the archive's stock of records can be done online by accessing the LMA website and navigating the londonGenerations search tool.\n\nAlthough many records (in particular the parish registers of Greater London) are stored on microfiche, there is a digitisation programme which is ongoing. The aim is to digitally store parish records, Poor Law documents, and school admission records up to 1911. An estimated 77 million people will be referenced by these documents.\n\nIt will be possible for visitors to view this data at no cost on terminals in the library. It will likewise be possible to view this data at home via the internet for a fee, via the website ancestry co uk, with the first stage going live in early 2009.\n\nAccording to a leaflet from the LMA (made available in September 2008):\n\n:It is anticipated that the full digitisation and indexing programme will include: Parish baptisms, marriages and burials; Bishops' transcripts; Parish Poor Law records; Boards of Guardians records; Diocesan marriage bonds and allegations; Non-conformist baptisms, marriages and burials; School admission and discharge registers; Electoral registers, overseers returns and poll books; Land Tax records; Wills; City of London Freedoms; Middlesex Sessions - Transportation Contracts; Consistory Court of London Matrimonial and Testamentary Papers.\n\nDigitised parish records went online on 16 September 2009, as an alternative to microfiche searches. Digitised electoral rolls, for the period 1835 to 1965, went online on 11 January 2012.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|London Metropolitan Archives}}\n*{{official|https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/london-metropolitan-archives/Pages/default.aspx}}\n\n{{London history}}\n\n{{Coord|51|31|31.49|N|0|6|26.95|W|scale:1563_region:GB|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Archives in London]]\n[[Category:Genealogical libraries]]\n[[Category:History organisations based in London]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Islington]]\n[[Category:County record offices in England]]\n[[Category:City archives]]\n[[Category:City of London Corporation]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Metropolitan_Archives"}

Benirschke played for the [[San Diego Chargers]] as their [[placekicker]] from 1978 until 1986.\n\nFollowing his retirement from football Benirschke tried to find a career in television and was hired by [[Merv Griffin]] to replace [[Pat Sajak]] as host of the daytime game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' in 1989.\n\n==Early career==\nBenirschke grew up in [[San Diego]] and attended [[La Jolla High School]]. His father [[Kurt Benirschke]], a German immigrant,  was a [[pathologist]] at the [[University of California, San Diego School of Medicine]] and the founder/director of the Center for the Reproduction of Endangered Species at the [[San Diego Zoo]], where Rolf worked summers in high school and college.\n\nRolf Benirschke majored in zoology at the [[University of California, Davis]], where he played football under coach [[Jim Sochor]]. He was selected by the [[Oakland Raiders]] in the 12th round of the [[1977 NFL Draft]], and was then traded to the [[San Diego Chargers]] for his rookie year in the [[National Football League]].\n\nIn the off-season before the 1978 season, his second season, he developed chronic fever, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. He learned that he had [[ulcerative colitis]], a form of [[inflammatory bowel disease]].\n\n==Living with ulcerative colitis==\nHis health problems got worse in the 1979 season, when, on the team plane coming home from a road trip, Benirschke collapsed. He underwent two surgeries to remove his large intestine and he was in the intensive care unit for weeks. When released from the hospital, he weighed only 123 pounds and had to adjust to life with two [[Ileostomy|ostomy]] appliances.  His ileostomy was eventually reversed in a [[Kock pouch]] procedure.\n\nOn Sunday, November 18, 1979, Benirschke made his dramatic return to the Chargers in a game against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. While he did not play, he was named honorary team captain for the game, which was a sellout. [[Louie Kelcher]], a Chargers' [[defensive tackle]], assisted him and held his hand out onto the field.<ref>[http://ibdcrohns.about.com/od/ulcerativecolitis/a/rolf.htm about.com]</ref>   The Chargers won the game 35-7.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1982, Benirschke was also a broadcaster for the [[San Diego Sockers (1978\u201396)|San Diego Sockers]] of the former [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|North American Soccer League]].<ref>Benirschke, Rolf with Mike Yorkey.

San Diego: Rolf Benirschke Enterprises, Inc., 1996, p. 174.</ref>\n\nIn 1980 Benirschke returned to kicking and played seven more seasons with the team before retiring in 1987 as the team's all-time leader in points scored (766).<ref>[http://www.sandiegomagazine.com/media/San-Diego-Magazine/November-2006/Rolf-Benirschke-with-Tom-Blair/ San Diego Magazine]</ref>\n\nHe was named the [[Walter Payton Man of the Year Award|NFL Man of the Year]] in 1983. He was selected to the [[Pro Bowl]] after the [[1983 San Diego Chargers season|1983 season]]. In [[1984 San Diego Chargers season|1984]], his kickoffs were viewed to be too short, and he gave a thumbs-up sign to [[Denver Broncos]] kicker [[Rich Karlis]] before a field goal that defeated the Chargers, prompting a meeting with San Diego owner [[Alex Spanos]] over Benirschke's loyalties.  Although Benirschke had the third-highest field goal percentage in NFL history, the Chargers selected punter/kicker [[Ralf Mojsiejenko]] in the [[1985 NFL Draft]] to provide competition.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cobbs|first=Chris|title=For Once, Chargers' Benirschke Has a Challenge|date=June 20, 1985|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-06-20/sports/sp-10134_1_rolf-benirschke|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NK7Tv3iz?url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-06-20/sports/sp-10134_1_rolf-benirschke|archivedate=February 12, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn August 31, 1987, Benirschke was traded to the [[Dallas Cowboys]] for a draft pick after he lost his job to rookie [[Vince Abbott]].

Benirschke played for the [[San Diego Chargers]] as their [[placekicker]] from 1978 until 1986.\n\nFollowing his retirement from football Benirschke tried to find a career in television and was hired by [[Merv Griffin]] to replace [[Pat Sajak]] as host of the daytime game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' in 1989.\n\n==Early career==\nBenirschke grew up in [[San Diego]] and attended [[La Jolla High School]]. His father [[Kurt Benirschke]], a German immigrant,  was a [[pathologist]] at the [[University of California, San Diego School of Medicine]] and the founder/director of the Center for the Reproduction of Endangered Species at the [[San Diego Zoo]], where Rolf worked summers in high school and college.\n\nRolf Benirschke majored in zoology at the [[University of California, Davis]], where he played football under coach [[Jim Sochor]]. He was selected by the [[Oakland Raiders]] in the 12th round of the [[1977 NFL Draft]], and was then traded to the [[San Diego Chargers]] for his rookie year in the [[National Football League]].\n\nIn the off-season before the 1978 season, his second season, he developed chronic fever, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. He learned that he had [[ulcerative colitis]], a form of [[inflammatory bowel disease]].\n\n==Living with ulcerative colitis==\nHis health problems got worse in the 1979 season, when, on the team plane coming home from a road trip, Benirschke collapsed. He underwent two surgeries to remove his large intestine and he was in the intensive care unit for weeks. When released from the hospital, he weighed only 123 pounds and had to adjust to life with two [[Ileostomy|ostomy]] appliances.  His ileostomy was eventually reversed in a [[Kock pouch]] procedure.\n\nOn Sunday, November 18, 1979, Benirschke made his dramatic return to the Chargers in a game against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. While he did not play, he was named honorary team captain for the game, which was a sellout. [[Louie Kelcher]], a Chargers' [[defensive tackle]], assisted him and held his hand out onto the field.<ref>[http://ibdcrohns.about.com/od/ulcerativecolitis/a/rolf.htm about.com]</ref>   The Chargers won the game 35-7.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1982, Benirschke was also a broadcaster for the [[San Diego Sockers (1978\u201396)|San Diego Sockers]] of the former [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|North American Soccer League]].<ref>Benirschke, Rolf with Mike Yorkey.

Before the [[World War I|First World War]], \"Near East\" was used in English to refer to the [[Balkans]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], while \"Middle East\" referred to [[Iran]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Afghanistan]], Central Asia, and [[Turkestan]]. In contrast, \"Far East\" referred to the countries of [[East Asia]] (e.g. [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], etc.)\n\nWith the disappearance of the Ottoman Empire in 1918, \"Near East\" largely fell out of common use in English, while \"Middle East\" came to be applied to the re-emerging countries of the [[Islamic world]]. However, the usage \"Near East\" was retained by a variety of academic disciplines, including [[archaeology]] and [[ancient history]], where it describes an area identical to the term ''Middle East'', which is not used by these disciplines (see [[Ancient Near East]]).\n\nThe first official use of the term \"Middle East\" by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] was in the 1957 [[Eisenhower Doctrine]], which pertained to the [[Suez Crisis]]. Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] defined the Middle East as \"the area lying between and including [[Libya]] on the west and [[Pakistan]] on the east, [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] on the North and the Arabian peninsula to the south, plus the [[Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]].\"<ref name=\"davison\"/> In 1958, the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] explained that the terms \"Near East\" and \"Middle East\" were interchangeable, and defined the region as including only [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Iraq]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], and [[Qatar]].<ref>{{cite news |title= 'Near East' is Mideast, Washington Explains |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70E10FC3D59127A93C6A81783D85F4C8585F9&scp=1&sq='Near%20East'%20is%20Mideast,%20Washington%20Explains&st=cse |newspaper= The New York Times |date= August 14, 1958 |accessdate= 2009-01-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091015044505/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70E10FC3D59127A93C6A81783D85F4C8585F9&scp=1&sq=%27Near%20East%27%20is%20Mideast%2C%20Washington%20Explains&st=cse |archivedate= October 15, 2009 |df=  }}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Associated Press]] Stylebook says that Near East formerly referred to the farther west countries while Middle East referred to the eastern ones, but that now they are synonymous.

In [[German language|German]] the term ''[[:de:Naher Osten|Naher Osten]]'' (Near East) is still in common use (nowadays the term ''Mittlerer Osten'' is more and more common in press texts translated from English sources, albeit having a distinct meaning) and in [[Russian language|Russian]] [[:ru:\u0411\u043b\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a|\u0411\u043b\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a]] or ''Blizhniy Vostok'', [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] [[:bg:\u0411\u043b\u0438\u0437\u044a\u043a \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a|\u0411\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043a\u0438\u044f \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a]], [[Polish language|Polish]] ''[[:pl:Bliski Wsch\u00f3d|Bliski Wsch\u00f3d]]'' or [[Croatian language|Croatian]] ''[[:hr:Bliski istok|Bliski istok]]'' (meaning ''Near East'' in all the four Slavic languages) remains as the only appropriate term for the region. However, some languages do have \"Middle East\" equivalents, such as the [[French language|French]] [[:fr:Moyen-Orient|Moyen-Orient]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] [[:sv:Mellan\u00f6stern|Mellan\u00f6stern]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[:es:Oriente Medio|Oriente Medio or Medio Oriente]], and the [[Italian language|Italian]] [[:it:Medio Oriente|Medio Oriente]].<ref group=\"note\">In Italian, the expression \"Vicino Oriente\" (Near East) was also widely used to refer to Turkey, and ''Estremo Oriente'' (Far East or Extreme East) to refer to all of Asia east of Middle East</ref>\n\nPerhaps because of the influence of the Western press, the Arabic equivalent of ''Middle East'' (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637  ''ash-Sharq al-Awsa\u1e6d'') has become standard usage in the mainstream Arabic press, comprising the same meaning as the term \"Middle East\" in North American and Western European usage. The designation, ''[[Mashriq]]'', also from the Arabic root for ''East'', also denotes a variously defined region around the [[Levant]], the eastern part of the Arabic-speaking world (as opposed to the ''[[Maghreb]]'', the western part).<ref>{{cite book |author=Anderson, Ewan W., William Bayne Fisher |title=The Middle East: Geography and Geopolitics |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |pages=12\u201313}}</ref> Even though the term originated in the West, apart from Arabic, other languages of countries of the Middle East also use a translation of it. The [[Persian language|Persian]] equivalent for Middle East is \u062e\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u0647 (''Kh\u0101var-e miy\u0101neh''), the Hebrew is \u05d4\u05de\u05d6\u05e8\u05d7 \u05d4\u05ea\u05d9\u05db\u05d5\u05df (''hamizrach hatikhon'') and the Turkish is Orta Do\u011fu.\n\n==Territories and regions==\n{{main list|List of Middle Eastern countries by population}}\n\n===Territories and regions usually considered within the Middle East===\nTraditionally included within the Middle East are [[Iran]] (Persia), [[Asia Minor]], [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Levant]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and [[Egypt]].

Near East, Levant and Fertile Crescent are geographic concepts, which refer to large sections of the modern defined Middle East, with Near East being the closest to Middle East in its geographic meaning. Due to it primarily being Arabic speaking, the [[Maghreb]] region of North Africa is sometimes included.\n\nThe countries of the [[South Caucasus]]\u2014[[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]\u2014are occasionally included in definitions of the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gloria-center.org/meria/2000/12/novikova.pdf|title=Armenia and the Middle East|publisher=Middle East Review of International Affairs|date=December 2000|first=Gayane|last=Novikova|accessdate=14 August 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821001515/http://www.gloria-center.org/meria/2000/12/novikova.pdf|archivedate=21 August 2014|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Greater Middle East]] was a [[Political geography|political]] term coined by the [[George W.

It is the birthplace and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] center of religions such as [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Manichaeism]], [[Yezidi]], [[Druze]], [[Yarsan]] and [[Mandeanism]], and in Iran, [[Mithraism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Manicheanism]], and the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]]. Throughout its history the Middle East has been a major center of world affairs; a strategically, economically, politically, culturally, and religiously sensitive area.\n\nThe world's earliest civilizations, Mesopotamia ([[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]]) and [[ancient Egypt]], originated in the Fertile Crescent and [[Nile]] Valley regions of the ancient Near East. These were followed by the [[Hittites|Hittite]], [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Urartian]] civilisations of [[Asia Minor]], [[Elam]] in pre-Iranian Persia, as well as the civilizations of the [[History of the Levant|Levant]] (such as [[Ebla]], [[Ugarit]], [[Canaan]], [[Aramea]], [[Phoenicia]] and [[Israel]]), [[History of Iran|Persian]] and [[Medes|Median]] civilizations in Iran, [[North Africa]] ([[Carthage]]/Phoenicia) and the [[Arabian Peninsula]] ([[Majan (civilization)|Magan]], [[Sheba]], [[Iram of the Pillars|Ubar]]). The Near East was first largely unified under the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]], then the [[Achaemenid Empire]] followed later by the [[Macedonian Empire]] and after this to some degree by the [[History of Iran|Iranian empires]] (namely the [[Arsacid Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid Empire]]s), the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Byzantine Empire]]. However, it would be the later [[Caliphate|Arab Caliphates]] of the [[Middle Ages]], or [[Islamic Golden Age]] which began with the Arab conquest of the region in the 7th century AD, that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant [[Islamic]] [[Arab|ethnic identity]] that largely (but not exclusively) persists today. The [[Mongols]], the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]], the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuks]], the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]], the Ottoman Empire, and the British Empire also dominated the region.\n\nThe modern Middle East began after [[World War I]], when the Ottoman Empire, which was allied with the [[Central Powers]], was defeated by the British Empire and their allies and [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|partitioned]] into a number of separate nations, initially under British and French Mandates. Other defining events in this transformation included the establishment of Israel in 1948 and the eventual departure of European powers, notably [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] by the end of the 1960s. They were supplanted in some part by the rising influence of the United States from the 1970s onwards.\n\nIn the 20th century, the region's significant stocks of [[crude oil]] gave it new strategic and economic importance. Mass production of oil began around 1945, with Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Iraq, and the [[United Arab Emirates]] having large quantities of oil.<ref>Goldschmidt (1999), p. 8</ref> Estimated [[Oil reserves#Estimated reserves by country|oil reserves]], especially in Saudi Arabia and Iran, are some of the highest in the world, and the international oil cartel [[OPEC]] is dominated by Middle Eastern countries.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Middle East was a theater of ideological struggle between the two superpowers and their allies: [[NATO]] and the United States on one side, and the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Warsaw Pact]] on the other, as they competed to influence regional allies. Besides the political reasons there was also the \"ideological conflict\" between the two systems. Moreover, as [[Louise Fawcett]] argues, among many important areas of contention, or perhaps more accurately of anxiety, were, first, the desires of the superpowers to gain strategic advantage in the region, second, the fact that the region contained some two-thirds of the world's oil reserves in a context where oil was becoming increasingly vital to the economy of the Western world [...]<ref>Louise, Fawcett. ''International Relations of the Middle East''. (Oxford University Press, New York, 2005)</ref> Within this contextual framework, the United States sought to divert the Arab world from Soviet influence. Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, the region has experienced both periods of relative peace and tolerance and periods of conflict particularly between [[Sunni]]s and [[Shiite]]s.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{main|Demographics of the Middle East}}\n{{see also|Largest metropolitan areas of the Middle East}}\n[[File:Maunsell&#039;s map, Pre-World War I British Ethnographical Map of eastern Turkey in Asia, Syria and western Persia 01.jpg|thumb|Maunsell's map, a Pre-World War I British Ethnographical Map of the Middle East]]\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n{{main|Ethnic groups in the Middle East}}\n[[Arabs]] constitute the largest ethnic group in the Middle East, followed by various [[Iranian peoples]] and then by [[Turkic people|Turkic speaking groups]] ([[Turkish people|Turkish]], [[Azeris]], and [[Iraqi Turkmen]]). Native ethnic groups of the region include, in addition to Arabs, [[Arameans in Syria|Arameans]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Baloch peoples|Baloch]], [[Berbers]], [[Copts]], [[Druze]], [[Greek Cypriots]], [[Jews]], [[Kurds]], [[Lurs]], [[Mandaeans]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Samaritans]], [[Shabak people|Shabaks]], [[Tat people (Iran)|Tats]], and [[Zazas]]. European ethnic groups that form a diaspora in the region include [[Albanians]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Circassians]] (including [[Kabardians]]), [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Greeks]], [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Franco-Levantines]], [[Levantines (Latin Christians)#Italian Levantines|Italo-Levantines]], and [[Iraqi Turkmens]]. Among other migrant populations are [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]], [[Filipinos in Saudi Arabia|Filipinos]], [[Indians in Saudi Arabia|Indians]], [[Indonesians in Saudi Arabia|Indonesians]], [[Pakistanis]], [[Pashtuns]], [[Romani people|Romani]], and [[Afro-Arab]]s.\n\n\n===Migration===\n\"Migration has always provided an important vent for labor market pressures in the Middle East. For the period between the 1970s and 1990s, the Arab states of the Persian Gulf in particular provided a rich source of employment for workers from Egypt, Yemen and the countries of the Levant, while Europe had attracted young workers from North African countries due both to proximity and the legacy of colonial ties between France and the majority of North African states.\"<ref name=\"Hassan and Dyer\">{{cite journal|last1=Hassan|first1=Islam|last2=Dyer|first2=Paul|title=The State of Middle Eastern Youth.|journal=The Muslim World|date=2017|volume=107|issue=1|pages=3\u201312|url=https://www.academia.edu/31029084|hdl=10822/1042998|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403002800/http://www.academia.edu/31029084/The_Muslim_World_CIRS_Special_Issue_The_State_of_Middle_Eastern_Youth|archivedate=2017-04-03|df=|doi=10.1111/muwo.12175}}</ref> According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], there are 13 million first-generation migrants from [[Arab nations]] in the world, of which 5.8 reside in other Arab countries.

In 2009 Arab countries received a total of US$35.1&nbsp;billion in [[remittance]] in-flows and remittances sent to [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]] and [[Lebanon]] from other Arab countries are 40 to 190 per cent higher than trade revenues between these and other Arab countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.egypt.iom.int/Doc/IOM%20Intra%20regional%20labour%20mobility%20in%20Arab%20region%20Facts%20and%20Figures%20(English).pdf |title=IOM Intra regional labour mobility in Arab region Facts and Figures (English) |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430010601/http://www.egypt.iom.int/Doc/IOM%20Intra%20regional%20labour%20mobility%20in%20Arab%20region%20Facts%20and%20Figures%20%28English%29.pdf |archivedate=2011-04-30 |df= }}</ref> In [[Somalia]], the [[Somali Civil War]] has greatly increased the size of the [[Somali diaspora]], as many of the best educated Somalis left for Middle Eastern countries as well as [[Europe]] and [[North America]].\n\nNon-Arab Middle Eastern countries such as [[Turkey]], [[Israel]] and [[Iran]] are also subject to important migration dynamics.\n\nA fair proportion of those migrating from Arab nations are from ethnic and religious minorities facing racial and or religious persecution and are not necessarily ethnic Arabs, Iranians or Turks.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Large numbers of [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], [[Jewish people|Jews]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Greek people|Greeks]] and [[Armenian people|Armenians]] as well as many [[Mandean]]s have left nations such as Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey for these reasons during the last century. In Iran, many religious minorities such as [[Christians]], [[Baha'i]]s and [[Zoroastrians]] have left since the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution of 1979]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n===Religions===\n{{main|Religion in the Middle East}}\n[[File:Mosque.jpg|thumb|Islam is the largest religion in the Middle East. Here, Muslim men are [[prostration|prostrating]] during prayer in a mosque.]]\n\nThe Middle East is very diverse when it comes to [[Major religious groups|religions]], many of which originated there. [[Islam]] is the largest religion in the Middle East, but other faiths that originated there, such as [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], are also well represented. Christians represent 40.5% of Lebanon, where the [[President of Lebanon|Lebanese president]], half of the cabinet, and half of the parliament follow one of the various Lebanese Christian rites. There are also important minority religions like the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]], [[Yarsanism]], [[Yazidis]]m, [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Mandaeism]], [[Druze]], and [[Shabak people#Religious beliefs|Shabakism]], and in ancient times the region was home to [[ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian religions]], [[ancient Canaanite religion|Canaanite religions]], [[Manichaeism]], [[Mithraic mysteries|Mithraism]] and various [[monotheist]] [[gnostic]] sects.\n\n===Languages===\nThe five top languages, in terms of numbers of speakers, are [[Arabic dialects|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], and [[Hebrew languages|Hebrew]]. Arabic and Hebrew represent the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] [[language family]]. Persian and Kurdish belong to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. Turkish belongs to [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language family. About 20 minority languages are also spoken in the Middle East.\n\nArabic, with all its dialects, are the most widely spoken languages in the Middle East, with [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] being official in all North African and in most West Asian countries. Arabic dialects are also spoken in some adjacent areas in neighbouring Middle Eastern non-Arab countries. It is a member of the [[Semitic languages|Semitic branch]] of the Afro-Asiatic languages. Several [[Modern South Arabian languages]] such as [[Mehri language|Mehri]] and [[Soqotri language|Soqotri]] are also spoken Yemen and Oman. Another Semitic language such as [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and its dialects are spoken mainly by [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Mandaeans]]. There is also an [[Berber languages|Oasis Berber]]-speaking community in Egypt where the language is also known as [[Siwa language|Siwa]]. It is a non-Semitic Afro-Asiatic language.\n\n[[Persian language|Persian]] is the second most spoken language. While it is primarily spoken in [[Iran]] and some border areas in neighbouring countries, the country is one of the region's largest and most populous. It belongs to the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian branch]] of the family of [[Indo-European languages]]. Other Western Iranic languages spoken in the region include [[Achomi language|Achomi]], [[Daylami language|Daylami]], [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] dialects, [[Semnani language|Semmani]], [[Luri language|Lurish]], amongst many others.\n\nThe third-most widely spoken language, [[Turkish language|Turkish]], is largely confined to Turkey, which is also one of the region's largest and most populous countries, but it is present in areas in neighboring countries. It is a member of the [[Turkic languages]], which have their origins in Central Asia. Another Turkic language, [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], is spoken by Azerbaijanis in Iran.\n\n[[Hebrew languages|Hebrew]] is one of the two official languages of [[Israel]], the other being Arabic. Hebrew is spoken and used by over 80% of Israel's population, the other 20% using Arabic.\n\n[[English language|English]] is commonly taught and used as a second language, especially among the [[middle class|middle]] and [[upper class]]es, in countries such as [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Iran]], [[Kurdistan]], [[Iraq]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Kuwait]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/jo.html#People |title= World Factbook \u2013 Jordan |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629165359/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/jo.html#People |archivedate= 2011-06-29 |df=  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ku.html |title= World Factbook \u2013 Kuwait |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140702040108/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ku.html |archivedate= 2014-07-02 |df=  }}</ref> It is also a main language in some Emirates of the United Arab Emirates.\n\n[[French language|French]] is taught and used in many government facilities and media in [[Lebanon]], and is taught in some primary and secondary schools of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]]. [[Maltese language|Maltese]], a Semitic language mainly spoken in Europe, is also used by the [[Maltese in Egypt|Franco-Maltese diaspora]] in Egypt.\n\n[[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Modern Greek|Greek]] speakers are also to be found in the region. [[Georgian language|Georgian]] is spoken by the Georgian diaspora. [[Russian language|Russian]] is spoken by a large portion of the Israeli population, because of [[Aliyah from the Commonwealth of Independent States in the 1990s|emigration in the late 1990s]].

The lowest-ranking country in the Middle East, in terms of per capita income (PPP), is the autonomous Palestinian Authority of Gaza and the West Bank ($1,100).\n\nThe economic structure of Middle Eastern nations are different in the sense that while some nations are heavily dependent on export of only oil and oil-related products (such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait), others have a highly diverse economic base (such as Cyprus, Israel, Turkey and Egypt). Industries of the Middle Eastern region include oil and oil-related products, agriculture, cotton, cattle, dairy, textiles, leather products, surgical instruments, defence equipment (guns, ammunition, tanks, submarines, fighter jets, UAVs, and missiles). Banking is also an important sector of the economies, especially in the case of UAE and Bahrain.\n\nWith the exception of Cyprus, Turkey, Egypt, Lebanon and Israel, tourism has been a relatively undeveloped area of the economy, in part because of the socially conservative nature of the region as well as political turmoil in certain regions of the Middle East. In recent years, however, countries such as the UAE, Bahrain, and Jordan have begun attracting greater number of tourists because of improving tourist facilities and the relaxing of tourism-related restrictive policies.\n\nUnemployment is notably high in the Middle East and North Africa region, particularly among young people aged 15\u201329, a demographic representing 30% of the region's total population.

The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term [[Near East]] (as opposed to the [[Far East]]) beginning in the early 20th century. The broader concept of the \"[[Greater Middle East]]\" (or [[Middle East and North Africa]]) also adds the [[Maghreb]], [[Sudan]], [[Djibouti]], [[Somalia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], and sometimes even [[Central Asia]] and [[Transcaucasia]] into the region. The term \"Middle East\" has led to some confusion over its changing definitions.\n\nMost Middle Eastern countries (13 out of 18) are part of the [[Arab world]].

Before the [[World War I|First World War]], \"Near East\" was used in English to refer to the [[Balkans]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], while \"Middle East\" referred to [[Iran]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Afghanistan]], Central Asia, and [[Turkestan]]. In contrast, \"Far East\" referred to the countries of [[East Asia]] (e.g. [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], etc.)\n\nWith the disappearance of the Ottoman Empire in 1918, \"Near East\" largely fell out of common use in English, while \"Middle East\" came to be applied to the re-emerging countries of the [[Islamic world]]. However, the usage \"Near East\" was retained by a variety of academic disciplines, including [[archaeology]] and [[ancient history]], where it describes an area identical to the term ''Middle East'', which is not used by these disciplines (see [[Ancient Near East]]).\n\nThe first official use of the term \"Middle East\" by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] was in the 1957 [[Eisenhower Doctrine]], which pertained to the [[Suez Crisis]]. Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] defined the Middle East as \"the area lying between and including [[Libya]] on the west and [[Pakistan]] on the east, [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] on the North and the Arabian peninsula to the south, plus the [[Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]].\"<ref name=\"davison\"/> In 1958, the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] explained that the terms \"Near East\" and \"Middle East\" were interchangeable, and defined the region as including only [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Iraq]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], and [[Qatar]].<ref>{{cite news |title= 'Near East' is Mideast, Washington Explains |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70E10FC3D59127A93C6A81783D85F4C8585F9&scp=1&sq='Near%20East'%20is%20Mideast,%20Washington%20Explains&st=cse |newspaper= The New York Times |date= August 14, 1958 |accessdate= 2009-01-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091015044505/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70E10FC3D59127A93C6A81783D85F4C8585F9&scp=1&sq=%27Near%20East%27%20is%20Mideast%2C%20Washington%20Explains&st=cse |archivedate= October 15, 2009 |df=  }}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Associated Press]] Stylebook says that Near East formerly referred to the farther west countries while Middle East referred to the eastern ones, but that now they are synonymous.

In [[German language|German]] the term ''[[:de:Naher Osten|Naher Osten]]'' (Near East) is still in common use (nowadays the term ''Mittlerer Osten'' is more and more common in press texts translated from English sources, albeit having a distinct meaning) and in [[Russian language|Russian]] [[:ru:\u0411\u043b\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a|\u0411\u043b\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a]] or ''Blizhniy Vostok'', [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] [[:bg:\u0411\u043b\u0438\u0437\u044a\u043a \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a|\u0411\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043a\u0438\u044f \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a]], [[Polish language|Polish]] ''[[:pl:Bliski Wsch\u00f3d|Bliski Wsch\u00f3d]]'' or [[Croatian language|Croatian]] ''[[:hr:Bliski istok|Bliski istok]]'' (meaning ''Near East'' in all the four Slavic languages) remains as the only appropriate term for the region. However, some languages do have \"Middle East\" equivalents, such as the [[French language|French]] [[:fr:Moyen-Orient|Moyen-Orient]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] [[:sv:Mellan\u00f6stern|Mellan\u00f6stern]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[:es:Oriente Medio|Oriente Medio or Medio Oriente]], and the [[Italian language|Italian]] [[:it:Medio Oriente|Medio Oriente]].<ref group=\"note\">In Italian, the expression \"Vicino Oriente\" (Near East) was also widely used to refer to Turkey, and ''Estremo Oriente'' (Far East or Extreme East) to refer to all of Asia east of Middle East</ref>\n\nPerhaps because of the influence of the Western press, the Arabic equivalent of ''Middle East'' (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637  ''ash-Sharq al-Awsa\u1e6d'') has become standard usage in the mainstream Arabic press, comprising the same meaning as the term \"Middle East\" in North American and Western European usage. The designation, ''[[Mashriq]]'', also from the Arabic root for ''East'', also denotes a variously defined region around the [[Levant]], the eastern part of the Arabic-speaking world (as opposed to the ''[[Maghreb]]'', the western part).<ref>{{cite book |author=Anderson, Ewan W., William Bayne Fisher |title=The Middle East: Geography and Geopolitics |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |pages=12\u201313}}</ref> Even though the term originated in the West, apart from Arabic, other languages of countries of the Middle East also use a translation of it. The [[Persian language|Persian]] equivalent for Middle East is \u062e\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u0647 (''Kh\u0101var-e miy\u0101neh''), the Hebrew is \u05d4\u05de\u05d6\u05e8\u05d7 \u05d4\u05ea\u05d9\u05db\u05d5\u05df (''hamizrach hatikhon'') and the Turkish is Orta Do\u011fu.\n\n==Territories and regions==\n{{main list|List of Middle Eastern countries by population}}\n\n===Territories and regions usually considered within the Middle East===\nTraditionally included within the Middle East are [[Iran]] (Persia), [[Asia Minor]], [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Levant]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and [[Egypt]].

It is the birthplace and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] center of religions such as [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Manichaeism]], [[Yezidi]], [[Druze]], [[Yarsan]] and [[Mandeanism]], and in Iran, [[Mithraism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Manicheanism]], and the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]]. Throughout its history the Middle East has been a major center of world affairs; a strategically, economically, politically, culturally, and religiously sensitive area.\n\nThe world's earliest civilizations, Mesopotamia ([[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]]) and [[ancient Egypt]], originated in the Fertile Crescent and [[Nile]] Valley regions of the ancient Near East. These were followed by the [[Hittites|Hittite]], [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Urartian]] civilisations of [[Asia Minor]], [[Elam]] in pre-Iranian Persia, as well as the civilizations of the [[History of the Levant|Levant]] (such as [[Ebla]], [[Ugarit]], [[Canaan]], [[Aramea]], [[Phoenicia]] and [[Israel]]), [[History of Iran|Persian]] and [[Medes|Median]] civilizations in Iran, [[North Africa]] ([[Carthage]]/Phoenicia) and the [[Arabian Peninsula]] ([[Majan (civilization)|Magan]], [[Sheba]], [[Iram of the Pillars|Ubar]]). The Near East was first largely unified under the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]], then the [[Achaemenid Empire]] followed later by the [[Macedonian Empire]] and after this to some degree by the [[History of Iran|Iranian empires]] (namely the [[Arsacid Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid Empire]]s), the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Byzantine Empire]]. However, it would be the later [[Caliphate|Arab Caliphates]] of the [[Middle Ages]], or [[Islamic Golden Age]] which began with the Arab conquest of the region in the 7th century AD, that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant [[Islamic]] [[Arab|ethnic identity]] that largely (but not exclusively) persists today. The [[Mongols]], the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]], the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuks]], the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]], the Ottoman Empire, and the British Empire also dominated the region.\n\nThe modern Middle East began after [[World War I]], when the Ottoman Empire, which was allied with the [[Central Powers]], was defeated by the British Empire and their allies and [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|partitioned]] into a number of separate nations, initially under British and French Mandates. Other defining events in this transformation included the establishment of Israel in 1948 and the eventual departure of European powers, notably [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] by the end of the 1960s. They were supplanted in some part by the rising influence of the United States from the 1970s onwards.\n\nIn the 20th century, the region's significant stocks of [[crude oil]] gave it new strategic and economic importance. Mass production of oil began around 1945, with Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Iraq, and the [[United Arab Emirates]] having large quantities of oil.<ref>Goldschmidt (1999), p. 8</ref> Estimated [[Oil reserves#Estimated reserves by country|oil reserves]], especially in Saudi Arabia and Iran, are some of the highest in the world, and the international oil cartel [[OPEC]] is dominated by Middle Eastern countries.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Middle East was a theater of ideological struggle between the two superpowers and their allies: [[NATO]] and the United States on one side, and the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Warsaw Pact]] on the other, as they competed to influence regional allies. Besides the political reasons there was also the \"ideological conflict\" between the two systems. Moreover, as [[Louise Fawcett]] argues, among many important areas of contention, or perhaps more accurately of anxiety, were, first, the desires of the superpowers to gain strategic advantage in the region, second, the fact that the region contained some two-thirds of the world's oil reserves in a context where oil was becoming increasingly vital to the economy of the Western world [...]<ref>Louise, Fawcett. ''International Relations of the Middle East''. (Oxford University Press, New York, 2005)</ref> Within this contextual framework, the United States sought to divert the Arab world from Soviet influence. Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, the region has experienced both periods of relative peace and tolerance and periods of conflict particularly between [[Sunni]]s and [[Shiite]]s.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{main|Demographics of the Middle East}}\n{{see also|Largest metropolitan areas of the Middle East}}\n[[File:Maunsell&#039;s map, Pre-World War I British Ethnographical Map of eastern Turkey in Asia, Syria and western Persia 01.jpg|thumb|Maunsell's map, a Pre-World War I British Ethnographical Map of the Middle East]]\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n{{main|Ethnic groups in the Middle East}}\n[[Arabs]] constitute the largest ethnic group in the Middle East, followed by various [[Iranian peoples]] and then by [[Turkic people|Turkic speaking groups]] ([[Turkish people|Turkish]], [[Azeris]], and [[Iraqi Turkmen]]).

European ethnic groups that form a diaspora in the region include [[Albanians]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Circassians]] (including [[Kabardians]]), [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Greeks]], [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Franco-Levantines]], [[Levantines (Latin Christians)#Italian Levantines|Italo-Levantines]], and [[Iraqi Turkmens]]. Among other migrant populations are [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]], [[Filipinos in Saudi Arabia|Filipinos]], [[Indians in Saudi Arabia|Indians]], [[Indonesians in Saudi Arabia|Indonesians]], [[Pakistanis]], [[Pashtuns]], [[Romani people|Romani]], and [[Afro-Arab]]s.\n\n\n===Migration===\n\"Migration has always provided an important vent for labor market pressures in the Middle East. For the period between the 1970s and 1990s, the Arab states of the Persian Gulf in particular provided a rich source of employment for workers from Egypt, Yemen and the countries of the Levant, while Europe had attracted young workers from North African countries due both to proximity and the legacy of colonial ties between France and the majority of North African states.\"<ref name=\"Hassan and Dyer\">{{cite journal|last1=Hassan|first1=Islam|last2=Dyer|first2=Paul|title=The State of Middle Eastern Youth.|journal=The Muslim World|date=2017|volume=107|issue=1|pages=3\u201312|url=https://www.academia.edu/31029084|hdl=10822/1042998|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403002800/http://www.academia.edu/31029084/The_Muslim_World_CIRS_Special_Issue_The_State_of_Middle_Eastern_Youth|archivedate=2017-04-03|df=|doi=10.1111/muwo.12175}}</ref> According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], there are 13 million first-generation migrants from [[Arab nations]] in the world, of which 5.8 reside in other Arab countries. Expatriates from Arab countries contribute to the circulation of financial and human capital in the region and thus significantly promote regional development. In 2009 Arab countries received a total of US$35.1&nbsp;billion in [[remittance]] in-flows and remittances sent to [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]] and [[Lebanon]] from other Arab countries are 40 to 190 per cent higher than trade revenues between these and other Arab countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.egypt.iom.int/Doc/IOM%20Intra%20regional%20labour%20mobility%20in%20Arab%20region%20Facts%20and%20Figures%20(English).pdf |title=IOM Intra regional labour mobility in Arab region Facts and Figures (English) |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430010601/http://www.egypt.iom.int/Doc/IOM%20Intra%20regional%20labour%20mobility%20in%20Arab%20region%20Facts%20and%20Figures%20%28English%29.pdf |archivedate=2011-04-30 |df= }}</ref> In [[Somalia]], the [[Somali Civil War]] has greatly increased the size of the [[Somali diaspora]], as many of the best educated Somalis left for Middle Eastern countries as well as [[Europe]] and [[North America]].\n\nNon-Arab Middle Eastern countries such as [[Turkey]], [[Israel]] and [[Iran]] are also subject to important migration dynamics.\n\nA fair proportion of those migrating from Arab nations are from ethnic and religious minorities facing racial and or religious persecution and are not necessarily ethnic Arabs, Iranians or Turks.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Large numbers of [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], [[Jewish people|Jews]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Greek people|Greeks]] and [[Armenian people|Armenians]] as well as many [[Mandean]]s have left nations such as Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey for these reasons during the last century. In Iran, many religious minorities such as [[Christians]], [[Baha'i]]s and [[Zoroastrians]] have left since the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution of 1979]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n===Religions===\n{{main|Religion in the Middle East}}\n[[File:Mosque.jpg|thumb|Islam is the largest religion in the Middle East. Here, Muslim men are [[prostration|prostrating]] during prayer in a mosque.]]\n\nThe Middle East is very diverse when it comes to [[Major religious groups|religions]], many of which originated there. [[Islam]] is the largest religion in the Middle East, but other faiths that originated there, such as [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], are also well represented. Christians represent 40.5% of Lebanon, where the [[President of Lebanon|Lebanese president]], half of the cabinet, and half of the parliament follow one of the various Lebanese Christian rites. There are also important minority religions like the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]], [[Yarsanism]], [[Yazidis]]m, [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Mandaeism]], [[Druze]], and [[Shabak people#Religious beliefs|Shabakism]], and in ancient times the region was home to [[ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian religions]], [[ancient Canaanite religion|Canaanite religions]], [[Manichaeism]], [[Mithraic mysteries|Mithraism]] and various [[monotheist]] [[gnostic]] sects.\n\n===Languages===\nThe five top languages, in terms of numbers of speakers, are [[Arabic dialects|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], and [[Hebrew languages|Hebrew]]. Arabic and Hebrew represent the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] [[language family]]. Persian and Kurdish belong to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. Turkish belongs to [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language family. About 20 minority languages are also spoken in the Middle East.\n\nArabic, with all its dialects, are the most widely spoken languages in the Middle East, with [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] being official in all North African and in most West Asian countries. Arabic dialects are also spoken in some adjacent areas in neighbouring Middle Eastern non-Arab countries. It is a member of the [[Semitic languages|Semitic branch]] of the Afro-Asiatic languages. Several [[Modern South Arabian languages]] such as [[Mehri language|Mehri]] and [[Soqotri language|Soqotri]] are also spoken Yemen and Oman. Another Semitic language such as [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and its dialects are spoken mainly by [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Mandaeans]]. There is also an [[Berber languages|Oasis Berber]]-speaking community in Egypt where the language is also known as [[Siwa language|Siwa]]. It is a non-Semitic Afro-Asiatic language.\n\n[[Persian language|Persian]] is the second most spoken language. While it is primarily spoken in [[Iran]] and some border areas in neighbouring countries, the country is one of the region's largest and most populous. It belongs to the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian branch]] of the family of [[Indo-European languages]]. Other Western Iranic languages spoken in the region include [[Achomi language|Achomi]], [[Daylami language|Daylami]], [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] dialects, [[Semnani language|Semmani]], [[Luri language|Lurish]], amongst many others.\n\nThe third-most widely spoken language, [[Turkish language|Turkish]], is largely confined to Turkey, which is also one of the region's largest and most populous countries, but it is present in areas in neighboring countries. It is a member of the [[Turkic languages]], which have their origins in Central Asia. Another Turkic language, [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], is spoken by Azerbaijanis in Iran.\n\n[[Hebrew languages|Hebrew]] is one of the two official languages of [[Israel]], the other being Arabic. Hebrew is spoken and used by over 80% of Israel's population, the other 20% using Arabic.\n\n[[English language|English]] is commonly taught and used as a second language, especially among the [[middle class|middle]] and [[upper class]]es, in countries such as [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Iran]], [[Kurdistan]], [[Iraq]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Kuwait]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/jo.html#People |title= World Factbook \u2013 Jordan |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629165359/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/jo.html#People |archivedate= 2011-06-29 |df=  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ku.html |title= World Factbook \u2013 Kuwait |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140702040108/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ku.html |archivedate= 2014-07-02 |df=  }}</ref> It is also a main language in some Emirates of the United Arab Emirates.\n\n[[French language|French]] is taught and used in many government facilities and media in [[Lebanon]], and is taught in some primary and secondary schools of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]].

[[Georgian language|Georgian]] is spoken by the Georgian diaspora. [[Russian language|Russian]] is spoken by a large portion of the Israeli population, because of [[Aliyah from the Commonwealth of Independent States in the 1990s|emigration in the late 1990s]]. Russian today is a popular unofficial language in use in [[Israel]]; news, radio and sign boards can be found in Russian around the country after Hebrew and Arabic. [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Circassian]] is also spoken by the diaspora in the region and by almost all Circassians in Israel who speak Hebrew and English as well.

The lowest-ranking country in the Middle East, in terms of per capita income (PPP), is the autonomous Palestinian Authority of Gaza and the West Bank ($1,100).\n\nThe economic structure of Middle Eastern nations are different in the sense that while some nations are heavily dependent on export of only oil and oil-related products (such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait), others have a highly diverse economic base (such as Cyprus, Israel, Turkey and Egypt). Industries of the Middle Eastern region include oil and oil-related products, agriculture, cotton, cattle, dairy, textiles, leather products, surgical instruments, defence equipment (guns, ammunition, tanks, submarines, fighter jets, UAVs, and missiles). Banking is also an important sector of the economies, especially in the case of UAE and Bahrain.\n\nWith the exception of Cyprus, Turkey, Egypt, Lebanon and Israel, tourism has been a relatively undeveloped area of the economy, in part because of the socially conservative nature of the region as well as political turmoil in certain regions of the Middle East. In recent years, however, countries such as the UAE, Bahrain, and Jordan have begun attracting greater number of tourists because of improving tourist facilities and the relaxing of tourism-related restrictive policies.\n\nUnemployment is notably high in the Middle East and North Africa region, particularly among young people aged 15\u201329, a demographic representing 30% of the region's total population.

The new Office/Library site was taken over by the U.S. Army to house a cluster of important post-Civil War medical activities of the Surgeon General's Office. The most significant were the archive of Civil War medical records (essential for verification of veterans' pension claims), the Army Medical Museum (now the [[National Museum of Health and Medicine]]), the editorial offices for preparation of the multi-volume ''[[Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion]]'', and the Library of the Surgeon General's Office.\n\n[[Image:Fords Theatre.jpg|thumb|left|Ford's Theatre housed the Surgeon General's library from 1867 to 1887.

The library's goal was to \"contain every medical book published in this country and every work relating to public health and state medicine.\" This collection would be \"as complete as possible in all publications relating to military organizations, medicine, and allied sciences.\" The library strove to provide \"an universal library of references\". In 1879 the library began publishing ''[[Index Medicus]]'', a periodical listing the titles of current medical articles, books, reports, and other medical literature. This achievement, as well as the creation of the ''[[Index Catalogue of the Surgeon General's Office]]'' (1880), was largely the legacy of Dr. [[John Shaw Billings]], Director of the Library from 1865 to 1895.\n\nWhen the Army's needs outgrew the capacity of the former theater, several of the units were moved in 1887 to a new building, the [[Army Medical Museum and Library]], on the nearby [[National Mall]] (7th Street and South B Street [now [[Independence Avenue (Washington D.C.)|Independence Avenue]]], SW, the present site of the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[Hirshhorn Museum]]).\n\n===The 20th century===\nIn 1922, the library was renamed the \"Army Medical Library\" (AML). In 1927, using funds from the [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh]], ''Index Medicus'' merged with the ''[[Quarterly Cumulative Index]]'' forming the ''[[Quarterly Cumulative Index Medicus]]''. From 1937 until 1942, the library ran a program, \"Medicofilm,\" which provided microfilm access to medical literature to patrons. In 1941 the library published ''[[The Current List of Medical Literature]]'' a \"rapid finding aid\" to all current articles and microfilm copies in the library's possession.\n\n[[File:Medical men use the library reading room, ca. 1940..JPG|thumb|right|Researchers working in the reading room of the AML when it was located on the National Mall, Washington, DC.

Gurary claimed the books as part of his inheritance from his late grandfather. According to Gurary, the Chabad Library belonged to his grandfather's estate. Barry Gurary clandestinely removed numerous Jewish books, including a first edition Passover haggadah worth over $50,000, and began selling the books. One illuminated Passover Haggadah dating back to 1757 was sold for $69,000 to a Swiss book dealer who soon found a private buyer to pay nearly $150,000 for it.\n\nFollowing the directives of Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] (the seventh [[The Rebbes of Chabad|Chabad Rebbe]]), the [[Agudas Chasidei Chabad]], the Chabad movement's central organization, filed a civil lawsuit to prevent Gurary from removing or selling any additional books. On legal advice, the Lubavitch Library obtained a temporary restraining order in the hope that this would resolve the matter. Agudas Chasidei Chabad later filed suit to retrieve the books. The Chabad movement argued that the library was the \"communal property\" of the Lubavitch Hasidim and not the \"personal possessions\" of the late Rebbe. They cited a letter written by the  Rebbe himself, supporting this notion.\n\nIn 1986, the court ruled in favor of Agudas Chassidei Chabad, and that ruling was upheld on appeal in 1987. The volumes were returned to the library.<ref>Agudas Chasidei Chabad of U.S. v.

A year after Yosef Yitzchak\u2019s death in 1950, Menachem Mendel became the seventh Rebbe. He continued to expand his new library, and in 1967 acquired the building adjacent to his office, for the purpose of housing the sizable collection. Two distinct libraries were now maintained at Lubavitch World Headquarters between 1968 and 1985\u2014the Collection of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak on the ground floor, and Menachem Mendel\u2019s collection in the annex.<ref>Hoffman, Edward (May 1991).

Gurary claimed the books as part of his inheritance from his late grandfather. According to Gurary, the Chabad Library belonged to his grandfather's estate. Barry Gurary clandestinely removed numerous Jewish books, including a first edition Passover haggadah worth over $50,000, and began selling the books. One illuminated Passover Haggadah dating back to 1757 was sold for $69,000 to a Swiss book dealer who soon found a private buyer to pay nearly $150,000 for it.\n\nFollowing the directives of Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] (the seventh [[The Rebbes of Chabad|Chabad Rebbe]]), the [[Agudas Chasidei Chabad]], the Chabad movement's central organization, filed a civil lawsuit to prevent Gurary from removing or selling any additional books. On legal advice, the Lubavitch Library obtained a temporary restraining order in the hope that this would resolve the matter. Agudas Chasidei Chabad later filed suit to retrieve the books. The Chabad movement argued that the library was the \"communal property\" of the Lubavitch Hasidim and not the \"personal possessions\" of the late Rebbe. They cited a letter written by the  Rebbe himself, supporting this notion.\n\nIn 1986, the court ruled in favor of Agudas Chassidei Chabad, and that ruling was upheld on appeal in 1987. The volumes were returned to the library.<ref>Agudas Chasidei Chabad of U.S. v.

Every law school accredited by the American Bar Association houses a law library. Public law libraries are available in many states, often in the local [[courthouse]]s. Some larger [[law firm]]s maintain a private library for their own attorneys, but many firms in [[college town]]s and larger cities with [[University|universities]] simply dispatch their attorneys to local law schools to do legal research.\n\nA typical law library holds a large number of works not seen in other libraries, including a full set of ''[[Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States|United States Reports]]'', one or both of the unofficial [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] [[Law report|reporters]], the West [[National Reporter System]], the [[West American Digest System]], official reporters from various states, the ''[[Federal Register]]'', volumes of ''[[American Jurisprudence]]'', bound volumes containing issues of prominent [[law review]]s from around the country, federal and state [[statute]]s and [[regulation]]s (such as the [[United States Code]] and [[Code of Federal Regulations]]), and a variety of [[Legal treatise|treatises]], encyclopedias, [[looseleaf service]]s, and practice guides.\n\nLarge law libraries may contain many additional materials covering topics such as: [[legal education]], [[research]], and [[writing]]; the history of the American legal system and profession; the history behind certain high-profile cases; techniques of oral argument; and the legislative history of important federal and state statutes.\n\nSmaller law libraries usually hold, at a minimum, one unofficial Supreme Court reporter, selected West national reporters and digests specific to the state in which the library is located, the United States Code, a few state-specific reporters and statutory compilations (if they exist for a particular state), and several state-specific treatises and practice guides. Most academic law library websites also contain legal research guidelines on numerous legal topics that are available to the public.\n\nIn recent years, the advent of online legal research outlets such as [[FindLaw]], [[Westlaw]], [[LexisNexis]], [[Bloomberg Law]], and [[HeinOnline]] (or in Canada, [[CanLII]]) has reduced the need for some types of printed volumes like reporters and statutory compilations. A number of law libraries have therefore reduced the availability of printed works that can easily be found on the Internet, and have increased their own Internet availability. On the other hand, some university law libraries retain extensive historical collections going back to the earliest English reports.

Every law school accredited by the American Bar Association houses a law library. Public law libraries are available in many states, often in the local [[courthouse]]s. Some larger [[law firm]]s maintain a private library for their own attorneys, but many firms in [[college town]]s and larger cities with [[University|universities]] simply dispatch their attorneys to local law schools to do legal research.\n\nA typical law library holds a large number of works not seen in other libraries, including a full set of ''[[Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States|United States Reports]]'', one or both of the unofficial [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] [[Law report|reporters]], the West [[National Reporter System]], the [[West American Digest System]], official reporters from various states, the ''[[Federal Register]]'', volumes of ''[[American Jurisprudence]]'', bound volumes containing issues of prominent [[law review]]s from around the country, federal and state [[statute]]s and [[regulation]]s (such as the [[United States Code]] and [[Code of Federal Regulations]]), and a variety of [[Legal treatise|treatises]], encyclopedias, [[looseleaf service]]s, and practice guides.\n\nLarge law libraries may contain many additional materials covering topics such as: [[legal education]], [[research]], and [[writing]]; the history of the American legal system and profession; the history behind certain high-profile cases; techniques of oral argument; and the legislative history of important federal and state statutes.\n\nSmaller law libraries usually hold, at a minimum, one unofficial Supreme Court reporter, selected West national reporters and digests specific to the state in which the library is located, the United States Code, a few state-specific reporters and statutory compilations (if they exist for a particular state), and several state-specific treatises and practice guides. Most academic law library websites also contain legal research guidelines on numerous legal topics that are available to the public.\n\nIn recent years, the advent of online legal research outlets such as [[FindLaw]], [[Westlaw]], [[LexisNexis]], [[Bloomberg Law]], and [[HeinOnline]] (or in Canada, [[CanLII]]) has reduced the need for some types of printed volumes like reporters and statutory compilations. A number of law libraries have therefore reduced the availability of printed works that can easily be found on the Internet, and have increased their own Internet availability. On the other hand, some university law libraries retain extensive historical collections going back to the earliest English reports. Many law libraries also participate in the [[Federal Depository Library Program]] which provides access to government information and documents to the public at no cost.  This is particularly true of law school libraries as the library at any accredited law school is automatically eligible to become a depository library under the Program.<ref name=\"FDLP Legal Requirements\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fdlp.gov/requirements-guidance/legal-requirements |title=Legal Requirements |publisher=Fdlp.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref>\n\nMost law libraries are members of the [[American Association of Law Libraries]] (AALL).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aallnet.org/ |title=AALL |publisher=Aallnet.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref> As of 2010, the association has over 5,000 member libraries.

And Sweeney as filmmaker effectively goes the Wes Anderson route of letting emotion bust through all the aesthetic archness at key moments. [...] We often make our own psychological prisons, and ''Straight Up'' is a droll embodiment of its protagonist's (and perhaps its maker's?) inner turmoil. Todd's sexual proclivities aren't fully on one side or the other of the Kinsey scale. Maybe he has none at all (that's fine, too!)\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCarlos Aguilar, for ''[[TheWrap]]'', wrote: \"Lack of intimacy, both physical and emotional, is at the heart of Todd\u2019s current crisis. Unfulfilled with same-sex romance, he wonders whether a foray into straight dating could unblock the door to self-discovery and prevent him from spending the rest of his days alone (as he exaggeratedly puts it). [...] True to the unlabeled happiness Todd is after, \u201cStraight Up\u201d doesn't conclude by assigning a new concrete definition of what these sexless sweethearts understand as being in love, regardless of the mechanics of their commitment. Sweeney's movie lets it flow with all its moving parts and uncertain specificities, focusing only on their spiritually solid bond\".\n\nOwen Gleiberman, for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', wrote that the film \"is really about a generation of people who have discovered a new way to connect through their detachment. A little of this can go a long way (the film is sometimes a bit airless), but James Sweeney is a filmmaker with the rare ability to toss antically inspired dialogue right off the edge of his brain.

[...] But just like any rom-com, no good thing can last without there being some kind of complications to their unique coupling. This struggle is brought on by a modern understanding of a relationship \u2014 one that is not often covered in people\u2019s everyday lives. This film gives way to the underappreciated and overlooked forms of sexuality.

[...] We often make our own psychological prisons, and ''Straight Up'' is a droll embodiment of its protagonist's (and perhaps its maker's?) inner turmoil.

[...] True to the unlabeled happiness Todd is after, \u201cStraight Up\u201d doesn't conclude by assigning a new concrete definition of what these sexless sweethearts understand as being in love, regardless of the mechanics of their commitment. Sweeney's movie lets it flow with all its moving parts and uncertain specificities, focusing only on their spiritually solid bond\".\n\nOwen Gleiberman, for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', wrote that the film \"is really about a generation of people who have discovered a new way to connect through their detachment.

It runs parallel to Naushad Ali Road (previously [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]]), a popular sea-front and promenade. Both roads are situated in Mumbai's [[Bandra]] (West) suburb (H-West Ward).\n\nSituated mainly on rolling hills with alternate steep and shallow sides, it garnered the name Pali Hill, although more than one hill is present. The main route of the road was smoothed and paved. The buildings and bungalows are set within the \"valleys\" and \"crests\" of the hills. Nearby localities include [[Pali Village]] and [[Pali Naka]].\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1950s, the area was mainly forested with dense undergrowth. Over the years, it was converted to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.\n\nA few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.\n\nCottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n''[[K.

Originally an area of orchards, fields and untamed forests, from 1980-2020 it was deforested and made suitable for residential habitation. A few giant trees remain in building compounds, bungalow gardens and on the roads. The most widely seen tree is the [[Delonix regia|gulmohar tree]]. Large (and rare in Mumbai) [[banyan trees]], [[peepul tree]]s, [[mango trees]], [[ashoka tree]]s, wild [[almond trees]], wild [[neem tree]]s as well as a variety of shrubs, grasses, bamboos and trees, like those of the [[papaya]], [[jackfruit]], [[custard-apple]], and [[guava]]<nowiki/>are abundant.\n\nFlowering shrubs are cultivated and sometimes grow wild.

It runs parallel to Naushad Ali Road (previously [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]]), a popular sea-front and promenade. Both roads are situated in Mumbai's [[Bandra]] (West) suburb (H-West Ward).\n\nSituated mainly on rolling hills with alternate steep and shallow sides, it garnered the name Pali Hill, although more than one hill is present. The main route of the road was smoothed and paved. The buildings and bungalows are set within the \"valleys\" and \"crests\" of the hills. Nearby localities include [[Pali Village]] and [[Pali Naka]].\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1950s, the area was mainly forested with dense undergrowth. Over the years, it was converted  to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.\n\nA few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.\n\nCottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n''[[K.
