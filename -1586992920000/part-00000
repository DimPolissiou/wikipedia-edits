Peasants of this sloboda, personally free, were paying their taxes with [[Yam (route)|Yam]] (mail coach) service on the old road to [[Smolensk]], the main link between Moscow and [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]]. Smolensk was annexed by Moscow in the course of the [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)|Russo-Polish War]], and as a result the road was straightened and a new river crossing emerged on site of present-day [[Borodinsky Bridge]]. Dorogomilovo sloboda relocated to the western bank, to present-day Dorogomilovo. For the next two hundred years, the new and the old settlements shared the same name. The only other settlement on the western bank was a fishing village owned by the [[Patriarch]].\n\nIn 1731\u20131742, when Moscow city boundary expanded to [[Kamer-Kollezhsky Val]] limits, Dorogomilovo sloboda was incorporated into Moscow. Gradually, the once-free coach-drivers were stripped of their liberties and reduced to taxpayer peasant status. Former sloboda population decreased from 117 households in 1699 to 24 in 1801. Instead, Dorogomilovo acquired one of Moscow's largest cemeteries (Orthodox, 1771, Jewish, 1788<ref>Russian: Official site, history page, 18th century [http://www.dorogomilovo.ru/history/17-18.html www.dorogomilovo.ru] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308012820/http://www.dorogomilovo.ru/history/17-18.html |date=March 8, 2007 }}</ref>).\n\nIn [[French invasion of Russia (1812)|1812]], old Smolensk road witnessed the retreat of Russian troops and [[Napoleon]]'s conquest of Moscow. The village of [[Fili (Moscow)|Fili]], where [[Kutuzov]] made his decision to abandon Moscow, is situated just outside the modern Dorogomilovo District boundary. The French marched to Moscow in three columns, crossing the river in [[Fili (Moscow)|Fili]], Dorogomilovo, and [[Luzhniki (village)|Luzhniki]]. Meanwhile, wounded at [[Battle of Borodino]] were dying and buried at Dorogomilovo cemeteries.<ref>Russian: Official site, history page, 1812 [http://www.dorogomilovo.ru/history/1812.html www.dorogomilovo.ru] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308012750/http://www.dorogomilovo.ru/history/1812.html |date=March 8, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIndustrial development of the 19th century was slow, due to the regular floods.

In 1912, the city built new [[Borodinsky Bridge]], which still stands. New Kiyevsky Terminal, designed by [[Ivan Rerberg]] and [[Vladimir Shukhov]] in 1912\u20131914, was completed during the [[Russian Civil War]], in 1920.\n\n===Dorogomilovo Cathedral===\nDorogomilovo used to have Moscow's second largest cathedral (after [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour|Christ the Saviour]], [http://www.dorogomilovo.ru/history/photos/dh021.html photo]), rated for 10,000 worshippers. It was set on the site of present-day corner block at 1&nbsp;Bolshaya Dorogomilovskaya; there are no reliable explanations why it was built in such a remote and scarcely populated place.

Peasants of this sloboda, personally free, were paying their taxes with [[Yam (route)|Yam]] (mail coach) service on the old road to [[Smolensk]], the main link between Moscow and [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]]. Smolensk was annexed by Moscow in the course of the [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)|Russo-Polish War]], and as a result the road was straightened and a new river crossing emerged on site of present-day [[Borodinsky Bridge]]. Dorogomilovo sloboda relocated to the western bank, to present-day Dorogomilovo. For the next two hundred years, the new and the old settlements shared the same name. The only other settlement on the western bank was a fishing village owned by the [[Patriarch]].\n\nIn 1731\u20131742, when Moscow city boundary expanded to [[Kamer-Kollezhsky Val]] limits, Dorogomilovo sloboda was incorporated into Moscow. Gradually, the once-free coach-drivers were stripped of their liberties and reduced to taxpayer peasant status. Former sloboda population decreased from 117 households in 1699 to 24 in 1801. Instead, Dorogomilovo acquired one of Moscow's largest cemeteries (Orthodox, 1771, Jewish, 1788<ref>Russian: Official site, history page, 18th century [http://www.dorogomilovo.ru/history/17-18.html www.dorogomilovo.ru] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308012820/http://www.dorogomilovo.ru/history/17-18.html |date=March 8, 2007 }}</ref>).\n\nIn [[French invasion of Russia (1812)|1812]], old Smolensk road witnessed the retreat of Russian troops and [[Napoleon]]'s conquest of Moscow. The village of [[Fili (Moscow)|Fili]], where [[Kutuzov]] made his decision to abandon Moscow, is situated just outside the modern Dorogomilovo District boundary. The French marched to Moscow in three columns, crossing the river in [[Fili (Moscow)|Fili]], Dorogomilovo, and [[Luzhniki (village)|Luzhniki]].

Two heterozygous parents have, in theory, a one in four chance of having a child with the disease, and two thirds of their unaffected children will be carriers. However, because spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) often results when the fetus has the disease, in actuality the proportion of children born alive with Donohue syndrome will be lower than 25%.<ref name=\"OMIM3\" />\n\nIt is possible to do a genetic test to identify carriers, but because it is so rare, this is not usually done unless there is reason to suspect that the individual being tested is a carrier, for instance having an affected sibling or cousin. As expected for a genetic disease that can be caused by many different mutations, it is not limited to a specific ethnic group, and has been seen in people of various races.\n\n==Pathophysiology==\n\nThe cause of the disease is the lack of a fully functional insulin receptor, which has a profound effect during fetal development and thereafter. In one case, it was found (by culturing pancreatic cells) that the receptor produced by the mutant allele is only about 15% as effective as the normal receptor.<ref name=\"OMIM2\" /> The [[Beta cell|beta cells]] in the [[pancreas]], which make and store insulin and release it on an as-needed basis, are often found to be very large or numerous.<ref name=\"OMIM2\" />\n\nThe role of insulin in the body is to facilitate the entrance of glucose into the cell. Once insulin binds to the insulin receptors on the cell surface, the insulin receptors will send a signal that will ultimately bring the glucose transporter protein [[GLUT4]] to attach to the cell membrane. Additionally, once insulin is bound to the insulin receptors, it will also initiate several signaling cascades that will promote cell growth and differentiation, protein synthesis, glucose synthesis, and the inhibition of [[gluconeogenesis]] through several metabolic pathways. A malfunctioning insulin receptor would thus not be able to properly initiate the signaling cascades for the aforementioned cellular processes. Many of the problems associated with Donohue syndrome may be due to the insulin receptor binding the [[insulin-like growth factor]], regulating the growth of the embryo, in addition to its well-known role in the regulation of blood sugar.<ref>Personal communication with J. Bell, Ph.D.</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThere are a few ways to diagnose Donohue Syndrome. Due to the nature of the disorder, Donohue syndrome can be diagnosed either genetically, symptomatically, or both. Because Donohue Syndrome is a genetic disorder, genetic testing can be performed to diagnose the disease. These genetic tests include [[diagnostic testing]], [[carrier testing]], predictive and pre-symptomatic testing, as well as forensic testing. Prenatally, [[amniocentesis]] can be performed to determine if the child will have Donohue Syndrome.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/donohue-syndrome|title=Donohue syndrome|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> Additionally, the disorder can be diagnosed through laboratory testing to measure blood insulin levels and defective insulin receptors. \n\n==Treatment==\nWhile there currently is no cure for Donohue Syndrome, treatments for those with the disease are tailored specifically to the symptoms present in each individual. It is often that a team of medical professionals will come together to treat a patient with this condition in their specific realm of practice such as pediatrics, endocrinology, and dermatology<ref name=\":0\" />. Treatment will often address specific dysfunctions in the patient, such as skin defects, hormonal imbalances, and normal progression of child growth.  \n\n==Eponym==\n\nDonohue syndrome was first identified in 1948 by Canadian [[pathologist]] [[William L. Donohue]] (1906\u20131985).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Donohue WL|title=Dysendocrinism|journal= [[The Journal of Pediatrics]]|year=1948|volume=32|pages=739\u201348|doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(48)80231-3|pmid=18866943|last2=Edwards|first2=HE|issue=6}}</ref> The name leprechaunism has been largely abandoned because of the perception of the name by some parents of patients as insulting.<ref name=\"OMIM\">{{OMIM|147670|Insulin Receptor}}</ref>\n\n==Prognosis==\n\nThe prognosis is quite dire, with early death usual.<ref name=\"pmid120239893\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Longo N, Wang Y, Smith SA, Langley SD, DiMeglio LA, Giannella-Neto D|year=2002|title=Genotype-phenotype correlation in inherited severe insulin resistance|url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/11/12/1465#DDF143C6|journal=Hum.

Several dozen cases have been reported in the medical community, and in the reported cases of the disorder, it has been found that the females are twice as likely to have the disorder as men. \n\n==Future research== \n\nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases sponsored a phase 2 clinical study in 2001 that would look at the effectiveness of [[leptin]] to treat severe insulin resistance. In the study, two children with severe insulin resistance of ages 11 and 13 with known a known defect in the insulin receptor. The goal for the study was to see if leptin could overcome insulin receptor defects by initiating molecules in the insulin-signal cascade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=%22Leprechaunism%22|title=Search of: \"Leprechaunism\" - List Results - ClinicalTrials.gov|website=www.clinicaltrials.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref> While no outcomes have yet been reported to date, the direction in which this clinical trial is heading is promising. \n\n==See also==\n* [[Patterson pseudoleprechaunism syndrome]]\n* [[Rabson\u2013Mendenhall syndrome]]\n* [[Williams syndrome]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|   DiseasesDB     = 30801 \n|   ICD10          = E34.8 \n|   ICD9           = \n|   ICDO           = \n|   OMIM           = 246200 \n|   MedlinePlus    = \n|   eMedicineSubj  = \n|   eMedicineTopic = \n|   MeshID         = \n|   Orphanet       = 508 \n}}\n\n{{Phakomatoses and other congenital malformations not elsewhere classified}}\n{{Cell surface receptor deficiencies}}\n\n[[Category:Autosomal recessive disorders]]\n[[Category:Rare diseases]]\n[[Category:Syndromes with craniofacial abnormalities]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox medical condition (new) \n| name            = Donohue syndrome \n| image           = PBB Protein INSR image.jpg \n| caption         = [[insulin receptor]] \n| \n| pronounce       =  \n| field           =  \n| synonyms        =  \n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = \n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\n'''Donohue syndrome''' (also known as '''leprechaunism''') is an extremely rare and severe [[genetic disorder]].

In one case, it was found (by culturing pancreatic cells) that the receptor produced by the mutant allele is only about 15% as effective as the normal receptor.<ref name=\"OMIM2\" /> The [[Beta cell|beta cells]] in the [[pancreas]], which make and store insulin and release it on an as-needed basis, are often found to be very large or numerous.<ref name=\"OMIM2\" />\n\nThe role of insulin in the body is to facilitate the entrance of glucose into the cell. Once insulin binds to the insulin receptors on the cell surface, the insulin receptors will send a signal that will ultimately bring the glucose transporter protein [[GLUT4]] to attach to the cell membrane. Additionally, once insulin is bound to the insulin receptors, it will also initiate several signaling cascades that will promote cell growth and differentiation, protein synthesis, glucose synthesis, and the inhibition of [[gluconeogenesis]] through several metabolic pathways. A malfunctioning insulin receptor would thus not be able to properly initiate the signaling cascades for the aforementioned cellular processes. Many of the problems associated with Donohue syndrome may be due to the insulin receptor binding the [[insulin-like growth factor]], regulating the growth of the embryo, in addition to its well-known role in the regulation of blood sugar.<ref>Personal communication with J. Bell, Ph.D.</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThere are a few ways to diagnose Donohue Syndrome. Due to the nature of the disorder, Donohue syndrome can be diagnosed either genetically, symptomatically, or both. Because Donohue Syndrome is a genetic disorder, genetic testing can be performed to diagnose the disease. These genetic tests include [[diagnostic testing]], [[carrier testing]], predictive and pre-symptomatic testing, as well as forensic testing. Prenatally, [[amniocentesis]] can be performed to determine if the child will have Donohue Syndrome<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/donohue-syndrome|title=Donohue syndrome|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref>. Additionally, the disorder can be diagnosed through laboratory testing to measure blood insulin levels and defective insulin receptors. \n\n==Treatment==\nWhile there currently is no cure for Donohue Syndrome, treatments for those with the disease are tailored specifically to the symptoms present in each individual. It is often that a team of medical professionals will come together to treat a patient with this condition in their specific realm of practice such as pediatrics, endocrinology, and dermatology<ref name=\":0\" />. Treatment will often address specific dysfunctions in the patient, such as skin defects, hormonal imbalances, and normal progression of child growth.  \n\n==Eponym==\n\nDonohue syndrome was first identified in 1948 by Canadian [[pathologist]] [[William L. Donohue]] (1906\u20131985).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Donohue WL|title=Dysendocrinism|journal= [[The Journal of Pediatrics]]|year=1948|volume=32|pages=739\u201348|doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(48)80231-3|pmid=18866943|last2=Edwards|first2=HE|issue=6}}</ref> The name leprechaunism has been largely abandoned because of the perception of the name by some parents of patients as insulting.<ref name=\"OMIM\">{{OMIM|147670|Insulin Receptor}}</ref>\n\n==Prognosis==\n\nThe prognosis is quite dire, with early death usual.<ref name=\"pmid120239893\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Longo N, Wang Y, Smith SA, Langley SD, DiMeglio LA, Giannella-Neto D|year=2002|title=Genotype-phenotype correlation in inherited severe insulin resistance|url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/11/12/1465#DDF143C6|journal=Hum.

Several dozen cases have been reported in the medical community, and in the reported cases of the disorder, it has been found that the females are twice as likely to have the disorder as men. \n\n==Future research== \n\nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases sponsored a phase 2 clinical study in 2001 that would look at the effectiveness of [[leptin]] to treat severe insulin resistance. In the study, two children with severe insulin resistance of ages 11 and 13 with known a known defect in the insulin receptor. The goal for the study was to see if leptin could overcome insulin receptor defects by initiating molecules in the insulin-signal cascade<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=%22Leprechaunism%22|title=Search of: \"Leprechaunism\" - List Results - ClinicalTrials.gov|website=www.clinicaltrials.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref>.

However, in the early 2000s, the newspaper changed its direction, becoming a mainstream newspaper, adding a much broader coverage of entertainment as well as business related news, and carrying more political news, as in the situation in [[Vieques]].\n\nIn addition to its regular news section, ''El Vocero'' also has business, entertainment, sports, and travel sections.\n\nOn April 8, 2007, [[Gaspar Roca]], the paper's founding publisher and editor in chief died due to respiratory arrest. He was replaced by his son Miguel Roca. As of January 2011 Miguel Roca was no longer working at the newspaper, and was replaced by a San Juan-based construction lawyer named Peter Miller.  Due to financial difficulties, in December 2013 ''El Vocero'' went bankrupt (Chapter 7). The new owner and publisher is Publi-Inversiones, formed by a group of local entrepreneurs. <ref>https://www.elvocero.com/actualidad/historia-de-el-vocero/article_76daf810-72f9-11e7-9c76-335973ecd547.html</ref>\n\n==First free newspaper==\nIn July 31, 2012, ''El Vocero'' changed its format, becoming the first free daily circulation newspaper in Puerto Rico.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vocero.com/gratis-periodico-el-vocero/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901162050/http://www.vocero.com/gratis-periodico-el-vocero/ |archivedate=2012-09-01 }}</ref> Later on other free daily newspapers were introduced, including the Swedish-owned ''Metro'' newspaper <ref>http://www.metro.pr/locales/llega-a-la-isla-nuestro-periodico-metro/pGXljy!U4tUa7roPeSM/</ref> as well as the GFR Media-owned ''Indice''.<ref name=\"elnuevodia.com\">http://www.elnuevodia.com/gfrmedialanzanuevaplataformacomercial-1351933.html</ref> ''Vocero'' was well received by its readers, and its circulation grew.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vocero.com/auditoria-sept-2012/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130412035642/http://www.vocero.com/auditoria-sept-2012/ |archivedate=2013-04-12 }}</ref>\n\nAs soon as ''Vocero'' went free, a newspaper war ensued.

At the same time, another GFR Media paper, ''[[Primera Hora (Puerto Rico)|Primera Hora]]'', launched a media campaign squarely directed at ''Vocero'', titled \u201cEl Que No Tiene La Voz del Pueblo No Vale Na\u2019\u201d.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=762-CoPx7xs</ref>  A couple of months later, however, GFR Media launched its own free paper, ''Indice''.<ref name=\"elnuevodia.com\"/> In October 2012, GFR\u2019s flagship newspaper, ''El Nuevo Dia'', published an investigation in which it claimed that ''El Vocero'' was financed by the government.

On the first of December of that same year, the newspaper was re-launched with a new editorial philosophy and a new design. The daily newspaper EL VOCERO was originally founded in 1974 and, due to it being part of a foreign investment fund, was managed under a different structure.\n\nIt is published in San Juan, Monday through Friday, and it is distributed completely free across 4,500 establishments and 100 traffic light intersections in the 78 municipalities. Apart from the printed version being available five days a week, there is a digital daily newspaper published every day, including Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nAccording to Gaither International, a market research firm, and its MBP analysis of 18+ readership, EL VOCERO is the most read newspaper in Puerto Rico, Mondays through Fridays. EL VOCERO of Puerto Rico has maintained its domain in the news industry by being the newspaper with the biggest circulation on the island, with more than 154 thousand printed copies audited by the Certified Audit Circulation (CAC). On Thursdays, the number of copies increases to 215 thousand. In addition to the printed copies, there are 100,000 digital subscribers who receive the newspaper through their email every morning.\n\nSince 2013, EL VOCERO and its employees have been managed by Publi-Inversiones Puerto Rico, Inc. Under the direction of experienced managers, EL VOCERO has solidified its honest and responsible editorial policy, and it has strengthened its compromise with the well-being of Puerto Rican families. Through its journalistic investigations that have uncovered improper actions and schemes of fraud, the publication is characterized by its role as an oversight body of the Government and public finances. Its investigation of the \u201cPetroleum Cartel,\" for example, revealed how members of The [[Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority]] had been taking advantage of the fuel business and enriching themselves through commissions and bribes for over a decade.\n\nThe newspaper is staffed with a robust team of journalists experts in politics, law and order, government, economics, sports, entertainment, gastronomy, travel and more, making EL VOCERO a publication with complete and objective coverage of the news on the island.\n\nIt is available to readers for free through its printed copy and digital replica, its webpage elvocero.com, its mobile app, and its social media pages. Aside from the daily newspaper, the publication also produces three magazines. Zona, which is marketed for men, and M\u00edrame Siempre, which covers social events, fashion, and philanthropy, are sold monthly at a cost of $2.50. Bienestar Total, dedicated to health and lifestyle, is distributed for free on a quarterly basis in medical offices, hospitals, gymnasiums, and in other points of interests.\n\nEl VOCERO\u2019s central offices are located on 1064, Avenida Ponce de Le\u00f3n, San Juan, Puerto Rico.<ref>http://www.elvocero.com/actualidad/historia-de-el-vocero/article_76daf810-72f9-11e7-9c76-335973ecd547.html</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.elvocero.com vocero.com - official site] {{in lang|es}}\n\n{{Newspapers published in Puerto Rico}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vocero, El}}\n[[Category:1974 establishments in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Media in San Juan, Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Spanish-language newspapers published in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Puerto Rican brands]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Puerto Rican newspaper}}\n{{Infobox newspaper\n| name = El Vocero\n| image = Logo-vocero.png\n| type = Daily [[newspaper]]\n| format = [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|Tabloid]]\n| foundation = 1974 (reestablished 2014)\n| political = Conservative,\n| owners = [[Publi-Inversiones]]\n| president = [[Salvador Hasb\u00fan ]]\n| language = Spanish\n| motto = La Verdad No Tiene Precio\n| headquarters = 1064 [[Avenida Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n|Ponce de Le\u00f3n Avenue]], [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]]  00901\n| publishing_city      = \n| publishing_country   = \n\n| website = http://www.elvocero.com|\n}}\n'''''El Vocero de Puerto Rico''''' is a [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] free newspaper that is published in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]].

However, in the early 2000s, the newspaper changed its direction, becoming a mainstream newspaper, adding a much broader coverage of entertainment as well as business related news, and carrying more political news, as in the situation in [[Vieques]].\n\nIn addition to its regular news section, ''El Vocero'' also has business, entertainment, sports, and travel sections.\n\nOn April 8, 2007, [[Gaspar Roca]], the paper's founding publisher and editor in chief died due to respiratory arrest. He was replaced by his son Miguel Roca. As of January 2011 Miguel Roca was no longer working at the newspaper, and was replaced by a San Juan-based construction lawyer named Peter Miller.  Due to financial difficulties, in December 2013 ''El Vocero'' went bankrupt (Chapter 7). The new owner and publisher is Publi-Inversiones, formed by a group of local entrepreneurs. <ref>https://www.elvocero.com/actualidad/historia-de-el-vocero/article_76daf810-72f9-11e7-9c76-335973ecd547.html</ref>\n\n==First free newspaper==\nIn July 31, 2012, ''El Vocero'' changed its format, becoming the first free daily circulation newspaper in Puerto Rico.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vocero.com/gratis-periodico-el-vocero/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901162050/http://www.vocero.com/gratis-periodico-el-vocero/ |archivedate=2012-09-01 }}</ref> Later on other free daily newspapers were introduced, including the Swedish-owned ''Metro'' newspaper <ref>http://www.metro.pr/locales/llega-a-la-isla-nuestro-periodico-metro/pGXljy!U4tUa7roPeSM/</ref> as well as the GFR Media-owned ''Indice''.<ref name=\"elnuevodia.com\">http://www.elnuevodia.com/gfrmedialanzanuevaplataformacomercial-1351933.html</ref> ''Vocero'' was well received by its readers, and its circulation grew.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vocero.com/auditoria-sept-2012/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130412035642/http://www.vocero.com/auditoria-sept-2012/ |archivedate=2013-04-12 }}</ref>\n\nAs soon as ''Vocero'' went free, a newspaper war ensued.  First, the ''[[San Juan Star]]'', which is distributed by ''Vocero''\u2019s competitors, GFR Media, accused ''Vocero'' of being financed by the government.  At the same time, another GFR Media paper, ''[[Primera Hora (Puerto Rico)|Primera Hora]]'', launched a media campaign squarely directed at ''Vocero'', titled \u201cEl Que No Tiene La Voz del Pueblo No Vale Na\u2019\u201d.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=762-CoPx7xs</ref>  A couple of months later, however, GFR Media launched its own free paper, ''Indice''.<ref name=\"elnuevodia.com\"/> In October 2012, GFR\u2019s flagship newspaper, ''El Nuevo Dia'', published an investigation in which it claimed that ''El Vocero'' was financed by the government. At the same time, ''El Vocero'' published its own series of articles demonstrating how the Ferre family had used the government to obtain financing for its own enterprises.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vocero.com/a-la-sombra-del-mantengo-dinero-publico-financia-al-grupo-ferre-rangel/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019192651/http://www.vocero.com/a-la-sombra-del-mantengo-dinero-publico-financia-al-grupo-ferre-rangel/ |archivedate=2012-10-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vocero.com/gfr-evade-contestar-preguntas-de-el-vocero/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021233747/http://www.vocero.com/gfr-evade-contestar-preguntas-de-el-vocero/ |archivedate=2012-10-21 }}</ref>\n\n==Controversial financing by the government==\nThe newspaper has been characterized as propaganda for the [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico|New Progressive Party]] since ''El Vocero'' allegedly received funds from the 2009 to 2013 NPP-controlled central government.<ref>{{cite news|title=$20 Million Public Funds for ''Vocero'' to be New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico Propaganda Arm|newspaper=San Juan Star|date=August 6, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Acosta Lespier|first=Ivonne|title=Se confirma lo de \"El Vocero\"|url=http://desahogoboricua.blogspot.com/2012/08/se-confirma-lo-de-el-vocero.html|work=Sin Mordazas}}</ref> According to an investigation by ''El Vocero''{{'}}s main competitor, the newspaper ''[[El Nuevo D\u00eda]]'', the company has received more than $24.9 million, even when it had a debt of $21,141,200 in taxes.<ref>{{cite news|last=D\u00edaz Rom\u00e1n|first=Miguel|title=Dinero p\u00fablico financia El Vocero|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/dineropublicofinanciaelvocero-1365586.html|accessdate=October 17, 2012|newspaper=El Nuevo D\u00eda|date=October 17, 2012}}</ref> ''El Vocero''{{'}}s editor-in-chief responded by stating that neither the newspaper nor its parent company have received government funds through any means, and dismissed ''El Nuevo D\u00eda'''s allegations as part of a series of attacks driven by the newspaper's new-found success as a free publication.<ref>{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Peter|title=A la sombra del mantengo: los Ferr\u00e9 Rangel|url=http://www.vocero.com/a-la-sombra-del-mantengo-dinero-publico-financia-al-grupo-ferre-rangel/|accessdate=October 17, 2012|newspaper=El Vocero|date=October 17, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019192651/http://www.vocero.com/a-la-sombra-del-mantengo-dinero-publico-financia-al-grupo-ferre-rangel/|archivedate=October 19, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==A new EL VOCERO since 2013==\n\nIn 2013, a group of businessmen from Puerto Rico acquired the rights to the name of the publication EL VOCERO and took it upon themselves to keep the publication alive. On the first of December of that same year, the newspaper was re-launched with a new editorial philosophy and a new design. The daily newspaper EL VOCERO was originally founded in 1974 and, due to it being part of a foreign investment fund, was managed under a different structure.\n\nIt is published in San Juan, Monday through Friday, and it is distributed completely free across 4,500 establishments and 100 traffic light intersections in the 78 municipalities. Apart from the printed version being available five days a week, there is a digital daily newspaper published every day, including Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nAccording to Gaither International, a market research firm, and its MBP analysis of 18+ readership, EL VOCERO is the most read newspaper in Puerto Rico, Mondays through Fridays. EL VOCERO of Puerto Rico has maintained its domain in the news industry by being the newspaper with the biggest circulation on the island, with more than 154 thousand printed copies audited by the Certified Audit Circulation (CAC). On Thursdays, the number of copies increases to 215 thousand. In addition to the printed copies, there are 100,000 digital subscribers who receive the newspaper through their email every morning.\n\nSince 2013, EL VOCERO and its employees have been managed by Publi-Inversiones Puerto Rico, Inc. Under the direction of experienced managers, EL VOCERO has solidified its honest and responsible editorial policy, and it has strengthened its compromise with the well-being of Puerto Rican families. Through its journalistic investigations that have uncovered improper actions and schemes of fraud, the publication is characterized by its role as an oversight body of the Government and public finances. Its investigation of the \u201cPetroleum Cartel,\" for example, revealed how members of The [[Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority]] had been taking advantage of the fuel business and enriching themselves through commissions and bribes for over a decade.\n\nThe newspaper is staffed with a robust team of journalists experts in politics, law and order, government, economics, sports, entertainment, gastronomy, travel and more, making EL VOCERO a publication with complete and objective coverage of the news on the island.\n\nIt is available to readers for free through its printed copy and digital replica, its webpage elvocero.com, its mobile app, and its social media pages. Aside from the daily newspaper, the publication also produces three magazines. Zona, which is marketed for men, and M\u00edrame Siempre, which covers social events, fashion, and philanthropy, are sold monthly at a cost of $2.50. Bienestar Total, dedicated to health and lifestyle, is distributed for free on a quarterly basis in medical offices, hospitals, gymnasiums, and in other points of interests.\n\nEl VOCERO\u2019s central offices are located on 1064, Avenida Ponce de Le\u00f3n, San Juan, Puerto Rico.<ref>http://www.elvocero.com/actualidad/historia-de-el-vocero/article_76daf810-72f9-11e7-9c76-335973ecd547.html</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.elvocero.com vocero.com - official site] {{in lang|es}}\n\n{{Newspapers published in Puerto Rico}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vocero, El}}\n[[Category:1974 establishments in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Media in San Juan, Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Spanish-language newspapers published in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Puerto Rican brands]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Vocero"}

Populated for approximately 5,000 years, its ancient name was [[Myos Hormos]].<ref>Myos Hormos - Quseir al-Qadim: Roman and Islamic Ports on the Red Sea, Blue, Lucie, Peacock, David P. S.,Oxbow (2006)</ref> El Qoseir is located 138 kilometers south of [[Hurghada]], 139&nbsp;km north of [[Marsa Alam]] and 73&nbsp;km north of the [[Marsa Alam International Airport]]. In 1986, its population was approximately 20,000. Today, the population of El Qoseir is around 50,000.\n\n== Climate ==\n[[K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies its climate as [[hot desert climate|hot desert]] (BWh). [[Summer]]s are hot and [[winter]]s are warm. Winter night temperatures in El Qoseir, along with those of [[Marsa Alam#Climate|Marsa Alam]] and [[Sharm El Sheikh#Climate|Sharm El Sheikh]] are the warmest of any other cities and resorts in [[climate of Egypt|Egypt]]. Additionally, [[Port Said#Climate|Port Said]], El Qoseir, [[Ras El Bar#Climate|Ras El Bar]], [[Baltim#Climate|Baltim]], [[Damietta#Climate|Damietta]] and [[Alexandria#Climate|Alexandria]] have the least temperature variation. Rain is very rare as in most of Egypt. Seasonal variation is small, comparable to Marsa Alam, but its summer days are cooler, even cooler than similar more northern areas at the Red Sea, like [[Hurghada#Climate|Hurghada]] and [[Sharm El Sheikh#Climate|Sharm El Sheikh]].\n\nThe highest record temperature was {{convert|46|C}}, recorded on July 12, 1983, while the coldest record temperature was {{convert|1|C}}, recorded on January 6,

''Kosseir'', ''Al Qusair'', ''El Quseir'', ''Quseir'', ''Qusseir'' or ''Qosseir''.</ref> ({{lang-arz|\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u064a\u0631|el-Qo\u1e63\u0113r}}, {{IPA-arz|el\u0294o\u02c8s\u02e4e\u02d0\u027e|pron}}) is a city in eastern [[Egypt]], located on the [[Red Sea]] coast. Populated for approximately 5,000 years, its ancient name was [[Myos Hormos]]<ref>Myos Hormos - Quseir al-Qadim: Roman and Islamic Ports on the Red Sea, Blue, Lucie, Peacock, David P. S.,Oxbow (2006)</ref>. El Qoseir is located 138 kilometers south of [[Hurghada]], 139&nbsp;km north of [[Marsa Alam]] and 73&nbsp;km north of the [[Marsa Alam International Airport]]. In 1986, its population was approximately 20,000. Today, the population of El Qoseir is around 50,000.\n\n== Climate ==\n[[K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies its climate as [[hot desert climate|hot desert]] (BWh). [[Summer]]s are hot and [[winter]]s are warm. Winter night temperatures in El Qoseir, along with those of [[Marsa Alam#Climate|Marsa Alam]] and [[Sharm El Sheikh#Climate|Sharm El Sheikh]] are the warmest of any other cities and resorts in [[climate of Egypt|Egypt]]. Additionally, [[Port Said#Climate|Port Said]], El Qoseir, [[Ras El Bar#Climate|Ras El Bar]], [[Baltim#Climate|Baltim]], [[Damietta#Climate|Damietta]] and [[Alexandria#Climate|Alexandria]] have the least temperature variation. Rain is very rare as in most of Egypt. Seasonal variation is small, comparable to Marsa Alam, but its summer days are cooler, even cooler than similar more northern areas at the Red Sea, like [[Hurghada#Climate|Hurghada]] and [[Sharm El Sheikh#Climate|Sharm El Sheikh]].\n\nThe highest record temperature was {{convert|46|C}}, recorded on July 12, 1983, while the coldest record temperature was {{convert|1|C}}, recorded on January 6, 1976.<ref name=\"Voodoo Skies\">{{cite web|title=Quseir, Egypt|url=http://voodooskies.com/weather/egypt/quseir|publisher=Voodoo Skies|accessdate=13 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|width =
