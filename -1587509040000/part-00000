Villagers would give them money, which they later used to buy food and drink to celebrate in [[Perun]]\u2019s honor.\n\nSouth Slavs used to organise the Dodole (or Perperuna) [[festival]] in times of [[drought]], where they worshipped the goddess and prayed to her for rain. In the ritual, young women sing specific songs to Dodola, accompanying it by a dance, while covered in leaves and small branches. In Croatia Dodole is often performed by folklore groups.\n\nIn folklore of [[Turopolje]] on the holidays of [[St. George|St. Juraj]] called ''Jurjevo'' five most beautiful maidens are picked to portray Dodola goddesses in leaf-dresses and sing for the village till the end of the holiday.\n\nSerbian ritual chant sung by youngsters going through the village in the dry, summer months.\n\nNa\u0161a dodo Boga moli,\n\nDa orosi sitna ki\u0161a,\n\nOj, dodo, oj dodole!\n\nMi idemo preko sela,\n\nA ki\u0161ica preko polja,\n\nOj, dodo, oj, dodole!\n\n=== Dodole in Macedonia ===\nThe oldest record for Dodole rituals in Macedonia is the song \"Oj Ljule\" from [[Struga]] region, recorded in 1861.<ref>{{cite book\n |last        = Miladinovci\n |title       = \u0417\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a\n |publisher   = Ko\u010do Racin\n |year        = 1962\n |location    = Skopje\n |url         = http://www.gbiblsk.edu.mk/images/stories/eknigi/zbornik.pdf\n |page        = 462\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120216225647/http://www.gbiblsk.edu.mk/images/stories/eknigi/zbornik.pdf\n |archivedate = 2012-02-16\n}}</ref>\n\n{| cellpadding=6\n!

Hincks]] and [[Clifford W. Beers]]. Originally named the ''Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene'', it is one of the largest and oldest [[wikt:voluntary|voluntary]] [[health organization]]s operating in [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-05-17 | url=https://cmha.ca/about-cmha | title=About the Canadian Mental Health Association}}</ref> \n\nEach year, CMHA divisions and branches across Canada provide service to more than 1.3 million Canadians annually through the combined efforts of more than 10,000 volunteers and 5,000 staff in locally run organizations in more than 300 communities in every province.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1149979/canadian-mental-health-association-marks-earth-day-with-support-from-bell-let-s-talk|title=Canadian Mental Health Association marks Earth Day with support from Bell Let's Talk|website=www.newswire.ca}}</ref> Its functions are to provide the resources and programs necessary to combat mental health issues and support recovery. \n\n==History==\n{{unsourced|section|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Creation ===\nThe Canadian Mental Health Association originally started as the Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene (CNCMH) in response to the hundreds of soldiers retuning from World War I experiencing [[mental illness]].<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/about-cmha/history-of-cmha|title=History of CMHA|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> Veterans' were place in prisons and asylums and Dr. Clarence M. Hincks noticed the lack of support, doctors and treatment inside these institutions, thus creating the need to change.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/about-cmha|title=About CMHA|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> Hincks, unsure how to proceed, partnered with Clifford W. Beers who had experience in the National Committee of Mental Hygiene in the United States to being mental hygiene to Canada.\n\nThe first official meeting of the CNCMH was held in Ottawa on April 26, 1918. A provisional constitution was adopted, Dr C.F. Martin, Professor of Medicine at McGill University, was elected President, Dr C.K. Clarke was appointed Medical Director, and Dr. C.M. Hincks was appointed Associate Medical Director and Secretary.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe meeting aimed to devised a plan to best assist those already in need as well as preventative measures in the future. This included objectives like a psychiatric and mental examinations of recruits, insuring adequate facilities for diagnosis and proper treatment for soldiers returning suffering from a mental disability or disease, and prevention of mental disease and deficiency.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nHincks then worked on finding doctors, creating a Board of Directors, and gaining donors to build his committee. With an importance of having a team of approved medical professions, Hincks discovered C.K. Clarke, Dean of Medicine and Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto, and the medical faculty of McGill. Hincks selected 18 members for his Board of Directors, including well known names like Lord Shaughnessy, President of the CPR; Richard B. Angus, Montreal financier and philanthropist; Dr. C.F. Martin, Professor of Medicine, McGill University; Sir Vincent Meredith, President, Bank of Montreal; and F.W. Molson, President of Molson's Brewery.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nHincks utilized co-founder Clifford W. Beers personal experience in mental health as a tool to share during \"drawing-room meetings\", or afternoon teas with influential women in order to gain the support of their wealthy friends. The strategy was extended to homes of friends in Quebec City, Montreal and Ottawa, and it proved successful by recruiting an impressive list of potential members and donors.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n<br />\n\n=== Hospital Surveys ===\nLieutenant Colonel Colin Russel soon gave the CNCMH an opportunity to undertake a project. Russel was the consultant neurologist to the Department of Soldiers and had visited many of the provincial mental hospitals which were caring for soldier patients. He was particularly distressed with those facilities in Manitoba. That province's government included with the mental hospitals in the province, all the institutions presently caring for the mentally disordered or defective including jails, schools, special homes and juvenile courts.\n\nOn September 30, 1918, Hincks and Keyes arrived in Winnipeg, where they visited several institutions. They also toured the Salvation Army Industrial Home and the Home for Incurables in Portage la Prairie and were so shocked by what they found that they immediately returned to Winnipeg to consult with government representatives. The CNCMH prepared a confidential report on its findings which was submitted to the government and the Public Welfare Commission.\n\nAs a result of the Manitoba Survey, and that province's quick response in implementing the recommendations, other provinces became interested in having similar surveys. During the next four years, requests for surveys were received from British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, [[Prince Edward Island]], Alberta, and Saskatchewan. As in Manitoba, these surveys included all institutions. Results of these surveys, however, have had controversial implications, including how they were used to argue for pro-sterilization policies by the [[Alberta Eugenics Board#Historical context|Alberta Eugenics Board]] and in the form of the ''[[Sexual Sterilization Act]]'' of Alberta.\n\nThe CNCMH also was very involved in the plight of soldiers. It became evident to Hincks that soldiers under care were not receiving adequate treatment. Assisted by Miss Keyes, Dr. Clarke conducted a quick inspection of soldier patients in 10 hospitals in the western. The results of this preliminary survey were published in 1920. Highlighting the problem of shell shock and other neuropsychiatric disorders affecting so many able-bodied men helped pave the way for the work of the National Committee.\n\n=== Schoolchildren Surveys ===\nSchools were other areas of involvement. Dr. Hincks and Dr. Helen MacMurchy pressed for surveys to assess the extent of mental retardation and other psychiatric disorders among schoolchildren and to provide support for the establishment of auxiliary classes for the special education of such children. In its first five years, the CNCMH built a firm foundation for meeting the objectives established in 1918. Surveys on the care and treatment of people suffering from mental disorders were conducted in every province. Mental hospitals in all provinces, except Ontario and Quebec, were inspected at the request of provincial governments. The extent of mental disorder was found to be greater than expected, and preventive programs were non-existent. Under the committee's recommendations, provincial governments spent over six million dollars on improving facilities for the mentally ill.\n\nCNCMH surveys of schoolchildren, conducted in several centres in Ontario and Quebec, resulted in over 150 special classes for retarded children being established by school boards. Mental Hygiene clinics were promoted and, in some cases, partially supported. A study of the psychiatric screening of immigrants resulted in a reduction in the number of new Canadians with mental disorders. The problem of \"shell shock\" and the rehabilitation of soldiers suffering from mental and nervous disorders was addressed through co-operation with DSCR and the Director General of Medical Services in the army. A beginning was made on public and professional education in mental hygiene and psychiatry.\n\n== Current Programs ==\n\n=== Peer Support Canada ===\nPeer Support Canada is an organization which specializes in connecting certified people who have experienced and beaten mental health issues with current sufferers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/programs-services/peer-support-canada|title=Peer Support Canada|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> The group also offers a certification, a three-phase program where individuals are be assessed and verified based on the national Standards of Practice regarding the knowledge and skills necessary to assist those with mental health challenges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://peersupportcanada.ca/|title=Peer Support Canada|website=peersupportcanada.ca|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Not Myself Today ===\nNot Myself Today is a campaign addressing mental health issues by cultivating a better workplace culture through training and services in corporations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/programs-services/not-myself-today|title=Not Myself Today|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> Companies that use the program receive a toolkit containing planning support, awareness and engagement activities, and evaluation tools. Participants also have access to an exclusive online portal, as well as national recognition from the Canadian Mental Health Association.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.notmyselftoday.ca/what-you-receive/|title=Not Myself Today - What You Receive|website=www.notmyselftoday.ca|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Carryit ===\nThe CMHA introduced Carryit in 2019, a toolkit to be used by those involved in schools to carry with them in case of opioid overdoses. The kit includes a method by which schools can create opioid overdose protocols through providing educational materials on opioids and [[naloxone]], fact sheets related to drug use, social media content examples, posters, and other useful tools to create an understanding and blueprint of how to combat drug overdoses in educational institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/carryit|title=Carry It Toolkit|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Recovery Colleges ===\nThe CMHA has introduced Recovery Colleges that bring together both trained professionals and those who have lived with mental health issues to develop and deliver courses designed to facilitate the hope and skills necessary to help students recover.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/programs-services/recovery-college|title=Recovery Colleges|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> They are based off of a similar system that was started in 2009 in the UK and have spread to several locations in Canada, thus far. Peer Support Canada has also played an integral role in connecting those with shared experiences to provide emotional support and have collaborative discussions in how to achieve recovery.\n\n== Public Policy Statements ==\nThe CMHA releases public statements criticizing local, provincial, and federal regulation as they pertain to mental health. Often, the statements express the organization\u2019s perspective on a certain issue and subsequently call for action.\n\n=== Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) ===\nThe Canadian Bill C-14 formally legalized assisted dying and laid out the foundations of how it can be accessed by the patients in need. In September 2017, CMHA released a statement declaring their position that MAiD for psychiatric patients should remain illegal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/cmha-position-on-medical-assistance-in-dying|title=CMHA Position on Medical Assistance in Dying|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> This statement is rooted in the organization\u2019s core belief in recovery from illness. The organization continued to provide the government with a number of recommendations including:\n\n* Ensuring that recovery-oriented practices are implemented\n* Continuing to invest in community mental health and addictions services and supports\n* Developing and funding the implementation of a national suicide prevention strategy\n* Investing in research to better understand mental illnesses.\n\n=== Call for Mental Health Legislation ===\nIn September 2018, CMHA called for new legislation to bring mental health into balance with physical health.

Hincks]] and [[Clifford W. Beers]]. Originally named the ''Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene'', it is one of the largest and oldest [[wikt:voluntary|voluntary]] [[health organization]]s operating in [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-05-17 | url=https://cmha.ca/about-cmha | title=About the Canadian Mental Health Association}}</ref> \n\nEach year, CMHA divisions and branches across Canada provide service to more than 1.3 million Canadians annually through the combined efforts of more than 10,000 volunteers and 5,000 staff in locally run organizations in more than 300 communities in every province.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1149979/canadian-mental-health-association-marks-earth-day-with-support-from-bell-let-s-talk|title=Canadian Mental Health Association marks Earth Day with support from Bell Let's Talk|website=www.newswire.ca}}</ref> Its functions are to provide the resources and programs necessary to combat mental health issues and support recovery. \n\n==History==\n{{unsourced|section|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Creation ===\nThe Canadian Mental Health Association originally began as the Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene (CNCMH), founded by Dr. Clarence M. Hincks and Clifford W. Beers on April 26, 1918.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/about-cmha/history-of-cmha|title=History of CMHA|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> Hincks was very interested in the field because he had experienced bouts of [[mental illness]] and noticed a lack of support for veterans' mental health.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/about-cmha|title=About CMHA|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nThe first meeting of the organization included objectives like a psychiatric examination of recruits, adequate care of returned soldiers suffering from mental disabilities, a mental examination of immigrants to ensure a better selection of newcomers, adequate facilities for the diagnosis and treatment of cases of mental disease, adequate care of the mentally deficient, and prevention of mental disease and deficiency.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHincks then worked on finding medical professionals to join the committee such as C.K. Clarke, Dean of Medicine and Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto, and the medical faculty of McGill. Hincks then established a Board of Directors, including Lord Shaughnessy, President of the CPR; Richard B. Angus, Montreal financier and philanthropist; Dr. C.F. Martin, Professor of Medicine, McGill University; Sir Vincent Meredith, President, Bank of Montreal; and F.W. Molson, President of Molson's Brewery.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHincks gained support through \"drawing-room meetings\" where socially prominent women invited their wealthy and influential friends for afternoon teas. Co-founder Clifford W. Beers, would then present on Beers' mental illness and the sometimes abusive treatment he received. The strategy was extended to homes of friends in Quebec City, Montreal and Ottawa, and it proved  successful by recruiting an impressive list of potential members and donors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe first official meeting of the CNCMH was held in Ottawa on April 26, 1918. A provisional constitution was adopted, Dr C.F. Martin, Professor of Medicine at McGill University, was elected President, Dr C.K. Clarke was appointed Medical Director, and Dr. C.M. Hincks was appointed Associate Medical Director and Secretary.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Hospital Surveys ===\nLieutenant Colonel Colin Russel soon gave the CNCMH an opportunity to undertake a project. Russel was the consultant neurologist to the Department of Soldiers and had visited many of the provincial mental hospitals which were caring for soldier patients. He was particularly distressed with those facilities in Manitoba. That province's government included with the mental hospitals in the province, all the institutions presently caring for the mentally disordered or defective including jails, schools, special homes and juvenile courts.\n\nOn September 30, 1918, Hincks and Keyes arrived in Winnipeg, where they visited several institutions. They also toured the Salvation Army Industrial Home and the Home for Incurables in Portage la Prairie and were so shocked by what they found that they immediately returned to Winnipeg to consult with government representatives. The CNCMH prepared a confidential report on its findings which was submitted to the government and the Public Welfare Commission.\n\nAs a result of the Manitoba Survey, and that province's quick response in implementing the recommendations, other provinces became interested in having similar surveys. During the next four years, requests for surveys were received from British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, [[Prince Edward Island]], Alberta, and Saskatchewan. As in Manitoba, these surveys included all institutions. Results of these surveys, however, have had controversial implications, including how they were used to argue for pro-sterilization policies by the [[Alberta Eugenics Board#Historical context|Alberta Eugenics Board]] and in the form of the ''[[Sexual Sterilization Act]]'' of Alberta.\n\nThe CNCMH also was very involved in the plight of soldiers. It became evident to Hincks that soldiers under care were not receiving adequate treatment. Assisted by Miss Keyes, Dr. Clarke conducted a quick inspection of soldier patients in 10 hospitals in the western. The results of this preliminary survey were published in 1920. Highlighting the problem of shell shock and other neuropsychiatric disorders affecting so many able-bodied men helped pave the way for the work of the National Committee.\n\n=== Schoolchildren Surveys ===\nSchools were other areas of involvement. Dr. Hincks and Dr. Helen MacMurchy pressed for surveys to assess the extent of mental retardation and other psychiatric disorders among schoolchildren and to provide support for the establishment of auxiliary classes for the special education of such children. In its first five years, the CNCMH built a firm foundation for meeting the objectives established in 1918. Surveys on the care and treatment of people suffering from mental disorders were conducted in every province. Mental hospitals in all provinces, except Ontario and Quebec, were inspected at the request of provincial governments. The extent of mental disorder was found to be greater than expected, and preventive programs were non-existent. Under the committee's recommendations, provincial governments spent over six million dollars on improving facilities for the mentally ill.\n\nCNCMH surveys of schoolchildren, conducted in several centres in Ontario and Quebec, resulted in over 150 special classes for retarded children being established by school boards. Mental Hygiene clinics were promoted and, in some cases, partially supported. A study of the psychiatric screening of immigrants resulted in a reduction in the number of new Canadians with mental disorders. The problem of \"shell shock\" and the rehabilitation of soldiers suffering from mental and nervous disorders was addressed through co-operation with DSCR and the Director General of Medical Services in the army. A beginning was made on public and professional education in mental hygiene and psychiatry.\n\n== Current Programs ==\n\n=== Peer Support Canada ===\nPeer Support Canada is an organization which specializes in connecting certified people who have experienced and beaten mental health issues with current sufferers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/programs-services/peer-support-canada|title=Peer Support Canada|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> The group also offers a certification, a three-phase program where individuals are be assessed and verified based on the national Standards of Practice regarding the knowledge and skills necessary to assist those with mental health challenges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://peersupportcanada.ca/|title=Peer Support Canada|website=peersupportcanada.ca|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Not Myself Today ===\nNot Myself Today is a campaign addressing mental health issues by cultivating a better workplace culture through training and services in corporations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/programs-services/not-myself-today|title=Not Myself Today|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> Companies that use the program receive a toolkit containing planning support, awareness and engagement activities, and evaluation tools.

The kit includes a method by which schools can create opioid overdose protocols through providing educational materials on opioids and [[naloxone]], fact sheets related to drug use, social media content examples, posters, and other useful tools to create an understanding and blueprint of how to combat drug overdoses in educational institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/carryit|title=Carry It Toolkit|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Recovery Colleges ===\nThe CMHA has introduced Recovery Colleges that bring together both trained professionals and those who have lived with mental health issues to develop and deliver courses designed to facilitate the hope and skills necessary to help students recover.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/programs-services/recovery-college|title=Recovery Colleges|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> They are based off of a similar system that was started in 2009 in the UK and have spread to several locations in Canada, thus far. Peer Support Canada has also played an integral role in connecting those with shared experiences to provide emotional support and have collaborative discussions in how to achieve recovery.\n\n== Public Policy Statements ==\nThe CMHA releases public statements criticizing local, provincial, and federal regulation as they pertain to mental health. Often, the statements express the organization\u2019s perspective on a certain issue and subsequently call for action.\n\n=== Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) ===\nThe Canadian Bill C-14 formally legalized assisted dying and laid out the foundations of how it can be accessed by the patients in need. In September 2017, CMHA released a statement declaring their position that MAiD for psychiatric patients should remain illegal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/cmha-position-on-medical-assistance-in-dying|title=CMHA Position on Medical Assistance in Dying|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> This statement is rooted in the organization\u2019s core belief in recovery from illness. The organization continued to provide the government with a number of recommendations including:\n\n* Ensuring that recovery-oriented practices are implemented\n* Continuing to invest in community mental health and addictions services and supports\n* Developing and funding the implementation of a national suicide prevention strategy\n* Investing in research to better understand mental illnesses.\n\n=== Call for Mental Health Legislation ===\nIn September 2018, CMHA called for new legislation to bring mental health into balance with physical health. This statement followed a survey commissioned by the CMHA discovered that over half of Canadians (53%) consider anxiety and depression to be \u2018epidemic\u2019 in Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/over-half-of-canadians-consider-anxiety-and-depression-epidemic|title=Over half of Canadians consider anxiety and depression \u2018epidemic\u2019|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Opioid Crisis Response ===\nFollowing the escalating rates of opioid-related injuries and deaths in Canada in 2009, CMHA developed and in-depth evidence-based policy and regulation paper directed at the Canadian government, policy markers and health organizations.

Kipling remembers, \"Often and often afterwards, the beloved Aunt would ask me why I had never told any one how I was being treated. Children tell little more than animals, for what comes to them they accept as eternally established. Also, badly-treated children have a clear notion of what they are likely to get if they betray the secrets of a prison-house before they are clear of it.\"<ref name=\"autobio\" />\n\nAlice took the children during Spring 1877 to Goldings Farm at [[Loughton]], where a carefree summer and autumn was spent on the farm and adjoining Forest, some of the time with [[Stanley Baldwin]]. In January 1878, Kipling was admitted to the [[United Services College]] at [[Westward Ho!]], Devon, a school recently founded to prepare boys for the army. It proved rough going for him at first, but later led to firm friendships and provided the setting for his schoolboy stories ''[[Stalky & Co.]]'' (1899).<ref name=\"oxfordchildren\" /> While there, Kipling met and fell in love with Florence Garrard, who was boarding with Trix at Southsea (to which Trix had returned}. Florence became the model for Maisie in Kipling's first novel, ''[[The Light That Failed]]'' (1891).<ref name=\"oxfordchildren\" />\n\n===Return to India===\nNear the end of his schooling, it was decided that Kipling did not have the academic ability to get into Oxford University on a scholarship.<ref name=\"oxfordchildren\" /> His parents lacked the wherewithal to finance him,<ref name=\"gilmour\" /> and so Kipling's father obtained him a job in [[Lahore]], where the father served as Principal of the [[National College Of Arts, Lahore|Mayo College of Art]] and Curator of the [[Lahore Museum]]. Kipling was to be [[sub-editor|assistant editor]] of a local newspaper, the ''[[Civil and Military Gazette]]''.\n\nHe sailed for India on 20 September 1882 and arrived in Bombay on 18 October. He described the moment years later: \"So, at sixteen years and nine months, but looking four or five years older, and adorned with real whiskers which the scandalised Mother abolished within one hour of beholding, I found myself at Bombay where I was born, moving among sights and smells that made me deliver in the vernacular sentences whose meaning I knew not. Other Indian-born boys have told me how the same thing happened to them.\"<ref name=\"autobio\" /> This arrival changed Kipling, as he explains: \"There were yet three or four days' rail to Lahore, where my people lived. After these, my English years fell away, nor ever, I think, came back in full strength.\" <ref name=\"autobio\" />\n\n==Early adult life (1882\u20131914)==\nFrom 1883 to 1889, Kipling worked in British India for local newspapers such as the ''Civil and Military Gazette'' in Lahore and [[The Pioneer (India)|''The Pioneer'']] in [[Allahabad]].<ref name=\"autobio\" />\n[[File:Lahore railway station1880s.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Lahore Junction railway station|Lahore Railway Station]] in the 1880s]]\n[[File:Bundi palace1990.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Bundi]], [[Rajputana Agency|Rajputana]], where Kipling was inspired to write ''[[Kim (novel)|Kim]].'']]\n\nThe former, which was the newspaper Kipling was to call his \"mistress and most true love,\" <ref name=\"autobio\" /> appeared six days a week throughout the year, except for one-day breaks for Christmas and Easter. Stephen Wheeler, the editor, worked Kipling hard, but Kipling's need to write was unstoppable. In 1886, he published his first collection of verse, ''Departmental Ditties.'' That year also brought a change of editors at the newspaper; [[E. Kay Robinson|Kay Robinson]], the new editor, allowed more creative freedom and Kipling was asked to contribute short stories to the newspaper.<ref name=\"plainsintro\" />\n\nIn an article printed in the ''[[Chums (paper)|Chums]]'' boys' annual, an ex-colleague of Kipling's stated that \"he never knew such a fellow for ink \u2013 he simply revelled in it, filling up his pen viciously, and then throwing the contents all over the office, so that it was almost dangerous to approach him.\"<ref>''Chums'', No. 256, Vol. V, 4 August 1897, p. 798.</ref> The anecdote continues: \"In the hot weather when he (Kipling) wore only white trousers and a thin vest, he is said to have resembled a [[Dalmatian dog]] more than a human being, for he was spotted all over with ink in every direction.\"\n\nIn the summer of 1883, Kipling visited [[Shimla]], then Simla, a well-known [[hill station]] and the summer capital of British India. By then it was the practice for the [[Viceroy of India]] and government to move to Simla for six months, and the town became a \"centre of power as well as pleasure.\" <ref name=\"plainsintro\" /> Kipling's family became annual visitors to Simla, and Lockwood Kipling was asked to serve in [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]] there. Rudyard Kipling returned to Simla for his annual leave each year from 1885 to 1888, and the town featured prominently in many stories he wrote for the ''Gazette''.<ref name=\"plainsintro\" /> \"My month's leave at Simla, or whatever Hill Station my people went to, was pure joy \u2013 every golden hour counted. It began in heat and discomfort, by rail and road. It ended in the cool evening, with a wood fire in one's bedroom, and next morn \u2013 thirty more of them ahead! \u2013 the early cup of tea, the Mother who brought it in, and the long talks of us all together again. One had leisure to work, too, at whatever play-work was in one's head, and that was usually full.\"<ref name=\"autobio\" />\n\nBack in Lahore, 39 of his stories appeared in the ''Gazette'' between November 1886 and June 1887. Kipling included most of them in ''[[Plain Tales from the Hills]]'', his first prose collection, published in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] in January 1888, a month after his 22nd birthday. Kipling's time in Lahore, however, had come to an end. In November 1887, he was moved to the ''Gazette''{{'}}s larger sister newspaper, ''The Pioneer'', in [[Allahabad]] in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], where worked as assistant editor and lived in Belvedere House from 1888 to 1889.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Neelam |first1=S |title=Rudyard Kipling's Allahabad bungalow in shambles |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/rudyard-kipling-s-allahabad-bungalow-in-shambles/article1-316198.aspx|accessdate=7 August 2015 |work=Hindustan Times |date=8 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first1= |title=Kipling, Rudyard \u2013 1865\u20131936 \u2013 Homes & haunts \u2013 India \u2013 Allahabad (from the collection of William Carpenter) |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/2005696003/ |website=Library of Congress US |accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:John Lockwood Kipling \u00e9s Rudyard Kipling.jpg|thumb|upright|Rudyard Kipling (right) with his father John Lockwood Kipling (left), circa 1890]]\nKipling's writing continued at a frenetic pace. In 1888, he published six collections of short stories: ''[[Soldiers Three]]'', ''[[The Story of the Gadsbys]]'', ''[[In Black and White (short story collection)|In Black and White]]'', ''[[Under the Deodars]]'', ''[[The Phantom 'Rickshaw and other Eerie Tales|The Phantom Rickshaw]]'', and ''[[Wee Willie Winkie and Other Child Stories|Wee Willie Winkie]]''. These contain a total of 41 stories, some quite long. In addition, as ''The Pioneer''{{'}}s special correspondent in the western region of [[Rajputana Agency|Rajputana]], he wrote many sketches that were later collected in ''Letters of Marque'' and published in ''[[From Sea to Sea and Other Sketches, Letters of Travel]]''.<ref name=\"plainsintro\" />\n\nKipling was discharged from ''The Pioneer'' in early 1889 after a dispute. By this time, he had been increasingly thinking of his future. He sold the rights to his six volumes of stories for \u00a3200 and a small royalty, and the ''Plain Tales'' for \u00a350; in addition, he received six-months' salary from ''The Pioneer'', ''in lieu'' of notice.<ref name=\"autobio\" />\n\n===Return to London===\nKipling decided to use the money to move to London, as the literary centre of the [[British Empire]]. On 9 March 1889, he left India, travelling first to San Francisco via [[Yangon|Rangoon]], Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan. Kipling was favourably impressed by Japan, calling its people \"gracious folk and fair manners.\" <ref name=\"auto1\">[[#Scott|Scott]], p. 315</ref>\n\nKipling later wrote that he \"had lost his heart\" to a [[geisha]] whom he called O-Toyo, writing while in the United States during the same trip across the Pacific, \"I had left the innocent East far behind.... Weeping softly for O-Toyo.... O-Toyo was a darling.\"<ref name=\"auto1\" /> Kipling then travelled through the United States, writing articles for ''The Pioneer'' that were later published in ''[[From Sea to Sea and Other Sketches, Letters of Travel]]''.<ref name=\"pinney1\">Pinney, Thomas (editor).

He found a place to live for the next two years at [[Villiers Street]], near Charing Cross (in a building subsequently named Kipling House):\n<blockquote>Meantime, I had found me quarters in [[Villiers Street]], [[Strand, London|Strand]], which forty-six years ago was primitive and passionate in its habits and population.

Before his return, he had used the [[telegram]] to propose to and be accepted by Wolcott's sister Caroline Starr Balestier (1862\u20131939), called \"Carrie,\"  whom he had met a year earlier, and with whom he had apparently been having an intermittent romance.<ref name=\"gilmour\" /> Meanwhile, late in 1891, a collection of his short stories on the British in India, ''Life's Handicap'', was published in London.<ref>Coates, John D.

Taking this loss in their stride, they returned to the US, back to Vermont \u2013 Carrie by this time was pregnant with their first child \u2013 and rented a small cottage on a farm near Brattleboro for $10 a month.<ref name=\"autobio\" /> According to Kipling, \"We furnished it with a simplicity that fore-ran the [[hire-purchase]] system. We bought, second or third hand, a huge, hot-air stove which we installed in the cellar. We cut generous holes in our thin floors for its eight-inch [20 cm] tin pipes (why we were not burned in our beds each week of the winter I never can understand) and we were extraordinarily and self-centredly content.\"<ref name=\"autobio\" />\n\nIn this house, which they called ''Bliss Cottage'', their first child, Josephine, was born \"in three-foot of snow on the night of 29 December 1892.

It chanced that I had written a tale about Indian Forestry work which included a boy who had been brought up by wolves. In the stillness, and suspense, of the winter of '92 some memory of the [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Lions of my childhood's magazine, and a phrase in [[Henry Rider Haggard|Haggard's]] ''[[Nada the Lily]]'', combined with the echo of this tale.

By the early 1890s, the United Kingdom and [[Venezuela]] were in a border dispute involving [[British Guiana]]. The US had made several offers to arbitrate, but in 1895, the new American Secretary of State [[Richard Olney]] upped the ante by arguing for the American \"right\" to arbitrate on grounds of sovereignty on the continent (see the [[Olney interpretation]] as an extension of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]).<ref name=\"gilmour\" /> This raised hackles in Britain, and the situation grew into a major [[United Kingdom\u2013United States relations#Venezuelan and Alaska border disputes|Anglo-American crisis]], with talk of war on both sides.\n\nAlthough the crisis eased into greater US\u2013British cooperation, Kipling was bewildered by what he felt was persistent anti-British sentiment in the US, especially in the press.<ref name=\"gilmour\" /> He wrote in a letter that it felt like being \"aimed at with a decanter across a friendly dinner table.\"<ref name=\"pinney\" /> By January 1896, he had decided<ref name=\"carrington\" /> to end his family's \"good wholesome life\" in the US and seek their fortunes elsewhere.\n\nA family dispute became the final straw. For some time, relations between Carrie and her brother Beatty Balestier had been strained, owing to his drinking and insolvency. In May 1896, an inebriated Beatty encountered Kipling on the street and threatened him with physical harm.<ref name=\"gilmour\" /> The incident led to Beatty's eventual arrest, but in the subsequent hearing and the resulting publicity, Kipling's privacy was destroyed, and he was left feeling miserable and exhausted. In July 1896, a week before the hearing was to resume, the Kiplings packed their belongings, left the United States and returned to England.<ref name=\"carrington\" />\n\n[[File:Rock House - geograph.org.uk - 1082515.jpg|thumb|Kipling's Torquay house, with an English heritage [[blue plaque]] on the wall.]]\n\n===Devon===\nBy September 1896, the Kiplings were in [[Torquay]], Devon, on the south-western coast of England, in a hillside home overlooking the [[English Channel]]. Although Kipling did not much care for his new house, whose design, he claimed, left its occupants feeling dispirited and gloomy, he managed to remain productive and socially active.<ref name=\"gilmour\" />\n\nKipling was now a famous man, and in the previous two or three years had increasingly been making political pronouncements in his writings. The Kiplings had welcomed their first son, [[John Kipling|John]], in August 1897. Kipling had begun work on two poems, \"[[Recessional (poem)|Recessional]]\" (1897) and \"[[The White Man's Burden]]\" (1899), which were to create controversy when published. Regarded by some as anthems for enlightened and duty-bound empire-building (capturing the mood of the [[Victorian era]]), the poems were seen by others as propaganda for brazen-faced [[imperialism]] and its attendant racial attitudes; still others saw irony in the poems and warnings of the perils of empire.<ref name=\"gilmour\" />\n\n<blockquote><poem>Take up the White Man's burden\u2014\nSend forth the best ye breed\u2014\nGo, bind your sons to exile\nTo serve your captives' need;\nTo wait, in heavy harness,\nOn fluttered folk and wild\u2014\nYour new-caught sullen peoples,\nHalf devil and half child.\n\u2014''The White Man's Burden''<ref name=\"wmb\">Kipling, Rudyard. 1899.

Back in England, Kipling wrote poetry in support of the British cause in the Boer War and on his next visit to South Africa in early 1900, became a correspondent for ''The Friend'' newspaper in [[Bloemfontein]], which had been commandeered by [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] for British troops.<ref>Reilly, Bernard F., Center for Research Libraries, Chicago, Illinois.

Foreword to: Kipling, Rudyard. ''The Irish Guards in the Great War''. 2 vols.

However, the poem was originally published at the head of a story about the [[Battle of Jutland]] and appears to refer to a death at sea; the \"Jack\" referred to is probably a generic \"[[Jack Tar]].\" <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kipling.org.uk/rg_jack1.htm|title=Notes on \"My Boy Jack\" |last=Southam |first=Brian|date=6 March 2010 |accessdate=23 July 2011}}</ref> In the Kipling family, Jack was the name of the family dog, while John Kipling was always John, making the identification of the protagonist of \"My Boy Jack\" with John Kipling somewhat questionable. However, Kipling was indeed emotionally devastated by the death of his son. He is said to have assuaged his grief by reading the novels of [[Jane Austen]] aloud to his wife and daughter.<ref>\"The Many Lovers of Miss Jane Austen\", BBC2 broadcast, 9&nbsp;pm 23 December 2011</ref> During the war, he wrote a booklet ''[[The Fringes of the Fleet]]''<ref>''The Fringes of the Fleet'', Macmillan & Co., 1916.</ref> containing essays and poems on various nautical subjects of the war. Some of these were set to music by the English composer [[Edward Elgar]].\n\nKipling became friends with a French soldier named Maurice Hammoneau, whose life had been saved in the First World War when his copy of ''Kim'', which he had in his left breast pocket, stopped a bullet. Hammoneau presented Kipling with the book, with bullet still embedded, and his [[Croix de Guerre]] as a token of gratitude. They continued to correspond, and when Hammoneau had a son, Kipling insisted on returning the book and medal.<ref>Original correspondence between Kipling and Maurice Hammoneau and his son Jean Hammoneau concerning the affair at the Library of Congress under the title: '' How \"Kim\" saved the life of a French soldier: a remarkable series of autograph letters of Rudyard Kipling, with the soldier's Croix de Guerre, 1918\u20131933.'' {{lccn|2007566938}}.

His main contributions to the project were his selection of the biblical phrase, \"[[Their Name Liveth For Evermore]]\" ([[Sirach|Ecclesiasticus]] 44.14, KJV), found on the [[Stone of Remembrance|Stones of Remembrance]] in larger war cemeteries, and his suggestion of the phrase \"Known unto God\" for the gravestones of unidentified servicemen. He also chose the inscription \"The Glorious Dead\" on the [[Cenotaph#The Cenotaph, London|Cenotaph]], Whitehall, London. Additionally, he wrote a two-volume history of the [[Irish Guards]], his son's regiment, published in 1923 and seen as one of the finest examples of regimental history.<ref>Kipling, Rudyard (1923).

With the increasing popularity of the automobile, Kipling became a motoring correspondent for the British press, writing enthusiastically of trips around England and abroad, though he was usually driven by a chauffeur.\n\nAfter the war, Kipling was sceptical of the [[Fourteen Points]] and the [[League of Nations]], but had hopes that the United States would abandon isolationism and the post-war world be dominated by an Anglo-French-American alliance.<ref name=\"Gilmour, David page 273\">[[#Gilmour|Gilmour]], p. 273.</ref> He hoped the United States would take on a League of Nations mandate for Armenia as the best way of preventing isolationism, and hoped that [[Theodore Roosevelt]], whom Kipling admired, would again become president.<ref name=\"Gilmour, David page 273\" /> Kipling was saddened by Roosevelt's death in 1919, believing him to be the only American politician capable of keeping the United States in the \"game\" of world politics.<ref>[[#Gilmour|Gilmour]], pp. 273\u2013274.</ref>\n\nKipling was hostile towards [[communism]], writing of the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik take-over]] in 1917 that one sixth of the world had \"passed bodily out of civilization.\"<ref name=\"auto6\">[[#Hodgson|Hodgson]], p. 1060.</ref> In a 1918 poem, Kipling wrote of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] that everything good in Russia had been destroyed by the Bolsheviks \u2013 all that was left was \"the sound of weeping and the sight of burning fire, and the shadow of a people trampled into the mire.\" <ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\nIn 1920, Kipling co-founded the [[Liberty League (Historic)|Liberty League]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jot101.com/2015/11/the-liberty-league-campaign-agains/ |title=The Liberty League \u2013 a campaign against Bolshevism |website=jot101.com |access-date=2 January 2017}}</ref> with [[H.

S. Eliot]] edited ''[[A Choice of Kipling's Verse]]'' (1941) with an introductory essay.<ref>[[#Eliot|Eliot]]. Eliot's essay occupies 31 pages.</ref> Eliot was aware of the complaints that had been levelled against Kipling and he dismissed them one by one: that Kipling is \"a Tory\" using his verse to transmit right wing political views, or \"a journalist\" pandering to popular taste; while Eliot writes, \"I cannot find any justification for the charge that he held a doctrine of race superiority.\"<ref>[[#Eliot|Eliot]], p. 29.</ref> Eliot finds instead,\n{{quote|An immense gift for using words, an amazing curiosity and power of observation with his mind and with all his senses, the mask of the entertainer, and beyond that a queer gift of second sight, of transmitting messages from elsewhere, a gift so disconcerting when we are made aware of it that thenceforth we are never sure when it is ''not'' present: all this makes Kipling a writer impossible wholly to understand and quite impossible to belittle.|T.S.

Although he had no direct connexion with any political party, Kipling was a Conservative, a thing that does not exist nowadays. Those who now call themselves Conservatives are either Liberals, Fascists or the accomplices of Fascists. He identified himself with the ruling power and not with the opposition. In a gifted writer this seems to us strange and even disgusting, but it did have the advantage of giving Kipling a certain grip on reality. The ruling power is always faced with the question, 'In such and such circumstances, what would you ''do?''<nowiki>'</nowiki>, whereas the opposition is not obliged to take responsibility or make any real decisions. Where it is a permanent and pensioned opposition, as in England, the quality of its thought deteriorates accordingly. Moreover, anyone who starts out with a pessimistic, reactionary view of life tends to be justified by events, for Utopia never arrives and 'the gods of the copybook headings', as Kipling himself put it, always return. Kipling sold out to the British governing class, not financially but emotionally. This warped his political judgement, for the British ruling class were not what he imagined, and it led him into abysses of folly and snobbery, but he gained a corresponding advantage from having at least tried to imagine what action and responsibility are like. It is a great thing in his favour that he is not witty, not 'daring', has no wish to ''[[\u00c9pater la bourgeoisie|\u00e9pater les bourgeois]]''. He dealt largely in platitudes, and since we live in a world of platitudes, much of what he said sticks. Even his worst follies seem less shallow and less irritating than the 'enlightened' utterances of the same period, such as Wilde's epigrams or the collection of cracker-mottoes at the end of ''[[Man and Superman]]''.|George Orwell<ref>{{cite journal |last=Orwell |first=George |title=Rudyard Kipling |journal=[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]] |date=February 1942 |url=http://orwell.ru/library/reviews/kipling/english/e_rkip |accessdate=4 December 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1939, the poet W.H.

He recorded several albums of Kipling's verse set to traditional airs, or to tunes of his own composition written in traditional style.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/26/arts/peter-bellamy-47-british-folk-singer-who-wrote-opera.html |title=Peter Bellamy, 47; British Folk Singer Who Wrote Opera |first=Jon |last=Pareles |date=26 September 1991 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref> However, in the case of the bawdy folk song, \"[[The Bastard King of England]],\"  which is commonly credited to Kipling, it is believed that the song is actually misattributed.<ref name=\"bastardking\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fresnostate.edu/folklore/ballads/EM122.html |title=Bastard King of England, The |publisher=fresnostate.edu}}</ref>\n\nKipling is often quoted in discussions of contemporary British political and social issues. In 1911, Kipling wrote the poem ''The Reeds of Runnymede'' that celebrated [[Magna Carta]], and summoned up a vision of the \"stubborn Englishry\" determined to defend their rights. In 1996, the following verses of the poem were quoted by former Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] warning against the encroachment of the [[European Union]] on national sovereignty:\n<blockquote><poem>At Runnymede, at Runnymede,\nOh, hear the reeds at Runnymede:\n\u2018You musn\u2019t sell, delay, deny,\nA freeman\u2019s right or liberty.\nIt wakes the stubborn Englishry,\nWe saw \u2019em roused at Runnymede!\n\n\u2026 And still when Mob or Monarch lays\nToo rude a hand on English ways,\nThe whisper wakes, the shudder plays,\nAcross the reeds at Runnymede.\nAnd Thames, that knows the mood of kings,\nAnd crowds and priests and suchlike things,\nRolls deep and dreadful as he brings\nTheir warning down from Runnymede!<ref>[https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/108353 \u201cKeith Joseph Memorial Lecture (\"Liberty and Limited Government\")\u201d].

Throughout their lives, Kipling and his wife Carrie maintained an active interest in Camp Mowglis, which still continues the traditions that Kipling inspired. Buildings at Mowglis have names such as [[Akela (The Jungle Book)|Akela]], [[Toomai of the Elephants|Toomai]], [[Baloo]], and Panther. The campers are referred to as \"the Pack,\"  from the youngest \"Cubs\" to the oldest living in \"Den.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Mowglis |url=http://www.mowglis.org/about/history/ |accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nKipling's links with the [[Scouting]] movements were also strong. [[Robert Baden-Powell]], founder of Scouting, used many themes from ''Jungle Book'' stories and ''Kim'' in setting up his junior Wolf Cubs. These ties still exist, such as the popularity of \"[[Kim's Game]].\"  The movement is named after [[Mowgli]]'s adopted wolf family, and adult helpers of Wolf Cub Packs take names from ''The Jungle Book'', especially the adult leader called ''[[Akela (The Jungle Book)|Akela]]'' after the leader of the Seeonee wolf pack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/history/cubs/index.htm#Jungle |title=ScoutBase UK: The Library \u2013 Scouting history \u2013 Me Too! \u2013 The history of Cubbing in the United Kingdom 1916\u2013present |publisher=Scoutbase.org.uk |accessdate=10 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125044919/http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/history/cubs/index.htm#Jungle|archivedate=25 November 2005 }}</ref>\n\n===Kipling's Burwash home===\n[[File:Bateman's.jpg|thumb|[[Bateman's]], Kipling's beloved home \u2013 which he referred to as \"A good and peaceable place\" \u2013 in [[Burwash, East Sussex|Burwash]], East Sussex, is now a public museum dedicated to the author<ref name=\"nationaltrust.org.uk\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/batemans/features/history-at-batemans |title=History at Bateman's |website=National Trust |date=22 February 2019}}</ref>]]\nAfter the death of Kipling's wife in 1939, his house, [[Bateman's]] in [[Burwash, East Sussex]], where he had lived from 1902 until 1936, was bequeathed to the [[National Trust]].

Allmusic.</ref>\n\n===Reputation in India===\nIn modern-day India, whence he drew much of his material, Kipling's reputation remains controversial, especially amongst modern nationalists and some post-colonial critics. Rudyard Kipling was a prominent supporter of Colonel [[Reginald Dyer]], who was responsible for the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]] in [[Amritsar]] (in the province of [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]]). Kipling called Dyer \"the man who saved India\" and initiated collections for the latter's homecoming prize.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1130221/jsp/frontpage/story_16587696.jsp |title=History repeats itself, in stopping short |website=telegraphindia.com}}</ref> However, Subhash Chopra writes in his book ''Kipling Sahib \u2013 the Raj Patriot'' that the benefit fund was started by ''[[The Morning Post]]'' newspaper, not by Kipling, and that Kipling made no contribution to the Dyer fund. While Kipling's name was conspicuously absent from the list of donors as published in ''The Morning Post'', he clearly admired Dyer.<ref>{{cite book |title=Kipling Sahib: the Raj patriot |author=Subhash Chopra |publisher=New Millennium |year=2016 |location=London |isbn=978-1858454405}}</ref>\n\nOther contemporary Indian intellectuals such as [[Ashis Nandy]] have taken a more nuanced view. [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the first Prime Minister of independent India, often described Kipling's novel ''[[Kim (novel)|Kim]]'' as one of his favourite books.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AtESAq0zPZAC&pg=PA137 Globalization and educational rights: an intercivilizational analysis], Joel H.

Kipling remembers, \"Often and often afterwards, the beloved Aunt would ask me why I had never told any one how I was being treated. Children tell little more than animals, for what comes to them they accept as eternally established. Also, badly-treated children have a clear notion of what they are likely to get if they betray the secrets of a prison-house before they are clear of it.\"<ref name=\"autobio\" />\n\nAlice took the children during Spring 1877 to Goldings Farm at [[Loughton]], where a carefree summer and autumn was spent on the farm and adjoining Forest, some of the time with [[Stanley Baldwin]]. In January 1878, Kipling was admitted to the [[United Services College]] at [[Westward Ho!]], Devon, a school recently founded to prepare boys for the army. It proved rough going for him at first, but later led to firm friendships and provided the setting for his schoolboy stories ''[[Stalky & Co.]]'' (1899).<ref name=\"oxfordchildren\" /> While there, Kipling met and fell in love with Florence Garrard, who was boarding with Trix at Southsea (to which Trix had returned.) Florence became the model for Maisie in Kipling's first novel, ''[[The Light That Failed]]'' (1891).<ref name=\"oxfordchildren\" />\n\n===Return to India===\nNear the end of his schooling, it was decided that Kipling did not have the academic ability to get into Oxford University on a scholarship.<ref name=\"oxfordchildren\" /> His parents lacked the wherewithal to finance him,<ref name=\"gilmour\" /> and so Kipling's father obtained him a job in [[Lahore]], where the father served as Principal of the [[National College Of Arts, Lahore|Mayo College of Art]] and Curator of the [[Lahore Museum]]. Kipling was to be [[sub-editor|assistant editor]] of a local newspaper, the ''[[Civil and Military Gazette]]''.\n\nHe sailed for India on 20 September 1882 and arrived in Bombay on 18 October. He described the moment years later: \"So, at sixteen years and nine months, but looking four or five years older, and adorned with real whiskers which the scandalised Mother abolished within one hour of beholding, I found myself at Bombay where I was born, moving among sights and smells that made me deliver in the vernacular sentences whose meaning I knew not. Other Indian-born boys have told me how the same thing happened to them.\"<ref name=\"autobio\" /> This arrival changed Kipling, as he explains: \"There were yet three or four days' rail to Lahore, where my people lived. After these, my English years fell away, nor ever, I think, came back in full strength.\" <ref name=\"autobio\" />\n\n==Early adult life (1882\u20131914)==\nFrom 1883 to 1889, Kipling worked in British India for local newspapers such as the ''Civil and Military Gazette'' in Lahore and [[The Pioneer (India)|''The Pioneer'']] in [[Allahabad]].<ref name=\"autobio\" />\n[[File:Lahore railway station1880s.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Lahore Junction railway station|Lahore Railway Station]] in the 1880s]]\n[[File:Bundi palace1990.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Bundi]], [[Rajputana Agency|Rajputana]], where Kipling was inspired to write ''[[Kim (novel)|Kim]].'']]\n\nThe former, which was the newspaper Kipling was to call his \"mistress and most true love,\" <ref name=\"autobio\" /> appeared six days a week throughout the year, except for one-day breaks for Christmas and Easter. Stephen Wheeler, the editor, worked Kipling hard, but Kipling's need to write was unstoppable. In 1886, he published his first collection of verse, ''Departmental Ditties.'' That year also brought a change of editors at the newspaper; [[E. Kay Robinson|Kay Robinson]], the new editor, allowed more creative freedom and Kipling was asked to contribute short stories to the newspaper.<ref name=\"plainsintro\" />\n\nIn an article printed in the ''[[Chums (paper)|Chums]]'' boys' annual, an ex-colleague of Kipling's stated that \"he never knew such a fellow for ink \u2013 he simply revelled in it, filling up his pen viciously, and then throwing the contents all over the office, so that it was almost dangerous to approach him.\"<ref>''Chums'', No. 256, Vol. V, 4 August 1897, p. 798.</ref> The anecdote continues: \"In the hot weather when he (Kipling) wore only white trousers and a thin vest, he is said to have resembled a [[Dalmatian dog]] more than a human being, for he was spotted all over with ink in every direction.\"\n\nIn the summer of 1883, Kipling visited [[Shimla]], then Simla, a well-known [[hill station]] and the summer capital of British India. By then it was the practice for the [[Viceroy of India]] and government to move to Simla for six months, and the town became a \"centre of power as well as pleasure.\" <ref name=\"plainsintro\" /> Kipling's family became annual visitors to Simla, and Lockwood Kipling was asked to serve in [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]] there. Rudyard Kipling returned to Simla for his annual leave each year from 1885 to 1888, and the town featured prominently in many stories he wrote for the ''Gazette''.<ref name=\"plainsintro\" /> \"My month's leave at Simla, or whatever Hill Station my people went to, was pure joy \u2013 every golden hour counted. It began in heat and discomfort, by rail and road. It ended in the cool evening, with a wood fire in one's bedroom, and next morn \u2013 thirty more of them ahead! \u2013 the early cup of tea, the Mother who brought it in, and the long talks of us all together again. One had leisure to work, too, at whatever play-work was in one's head, and that was usually full.\"<ref name=\"autobio\" />\n\nBack in Lahore, 39 of his stories appeared in the ''Gazette'' between November 1886 and June 1887. Kipling included most of them in ''[[Plain Tales from the Hills]]'', his first prose collection, published in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] in January 1888, a month after his 22nd birthday. Kipling's time in Lahore, however, had come to an end. In November 1887, he was moved to the ''Gazette''{{'}}s larger sister newspaper, ''The Pioneer'', in [[Allahabad]] in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], where worked as assistant editor and lived in Belvedere House from 1888 to 1889.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Neelam |first1=S |title=Rudyard Kipling's Allahabad bungalow in shambles |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/rudyard-kipling-s-allahabad-bungalow-in-shambles/article1-316198.aspx|accessdate=7 August 2015 |work=Hindustan Times |date=8 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first1= |title=Kipling, Rudyard \u2013 1865\u20131936 \u2013 Homes & haunts \u2013 India \u2013 Allahabad (from the collection of William Carpenter) |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/2005696003/ |website=Library of Congress US |accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:John Lockwood Kipling \u00e9s Rudyard Kipling.jpg|thumb|upright|Rudyard Kipling (right) with his father John Lockwood Kipling (left), circa 1890]]\nKipling's writing continued at a frenetic pace. In 1888, he published six collections of short stories: ''[[Soldiers Three]]'', ''[[The Story of the Gadsbys]]'', ''[[In Black and White (short story collection)|In Black and White]]'', ''[[Under the Deodars]]'', ''[[The Phantom 'Rickshaw and other Eerie Tales|The Phantom Rickshaw]]'', and ''[[Wee Willie Winkie and Other Child Stories|Wee Willie Winkie]]''. These contain a total of 41 stories, some quite long. In addition, as ''The Pioneer''{{'}}s special correspondent in the western region of [[Rajputana Agency|Rajputana]], he wrote many sketches that were later collected in ''Letters of Marque'' and published in ''[[From Sea to Sea and Other Sketches, Letters of Travel]]''.<ref name=\"plainsintro\" />\n\nKipling was discharged from ''The Pioneer'' in early 1889 after a dispute. By this time, he had been increasingly thinking of his future. He sold the rights to his six volumes of stories for \u00a3200 and a small royalty, and the ''Plain Tales'' for \u00a350; in addition, he received six-months' salary from ''The Pioneer'', ''in lieu'' of notice.<ref name=\"autobio\" />\n\n===Return to London===\nKipling decided to use the money to move to London, as the literary centre of the [[British Empire]]. On 9 March 1889, he left India, travelling first to San Francisco via [[Yangon|Rangoon]], Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan. Kipling was favourably impressed by Japan, calling its people \"gracious folk and fair manners.\" <ref name=\"auto1\">[[#Scott|Scott]], p. 315</ref>\n\nKipling later wrote that he \"had lost his heart\" to a [[geisha]] whom he called O-Toyo, writing while in the United States during the same trip across the Pacific, \"I had left the innocent East far behind....

Before his return, he had used the [[telegram]] to propose to and be accepted by Wolcott's sister Caroline Starr Balestier (1862\u20131939), called \"Carrie,\"  whom he had met a year earlier, and with whom he had apparently been having an intermittent romance.<ref name=\"gilmour\" /> Meanwhile, late in 1891, a collection of his short stories on the British in India, ''Life's Handicap'', was published in London.<ref>Coates, John D.

We bought, second or third hand, a huge, hot-air stove which we installed in the cellar.

The collection of ''[[Barrack-Room Ballads]]'' was issued in March 1892, first published individually for the most part in 1890, and contained his poems \"[[Mandalay (poem)|Mandalay]]\" and \"[[Gunga Din]].\"  He especially enjoyed writing the ''Jungle Books'' and also corresponding with many children who wrote to him about them.<ref name=\"gilmour\" />\n\n====Life in New England====\nThe writing life in ''Naulakha'' was occasionally interrupted by visitors, including [[John Lockwood Kipling|his father]], who visited soon after his retirement in 1893,<ref name=\"gilmour\" /> and the British writer [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], who brought his golf clubs, stayed for two days, and gave Kipling an extended golf lesson.<ref name=\"mallett\">Mallet, Phillip (2003).

''Letters of Rudyard Kipling, volume 2''.

By the early 1890s, the United Kingdom and [[Venezuela]] were in a border dispute involving [[British Guiana]]. The US had made several offers to arbitrate, but in 1895, the new American Secretary of State [[Richard Olney]] upped the ante by arguing for the American \"right\" to arbitrate on grounds of sovereignty on the continent (see the [[Olney interpretation]] as an extension of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]).<ref name=\"gilmour\" /> This raised hackles in Britain, and the situation grew into a major [[United Kingdom\u2013United States relations#Venezuelan and Alaska border disputes|Anglo-American crisis]], with talk of war on both sides.\n\nAlthough the crisis eased into greater US\u2013British cooperation, Kipling was bewildered by what he felt was persistent anti-British sentiment in the US, especially in the press.<ref name=\"gilmour\" /> He wrote in a letter that it felt like being \"aimed at with a decanter across a friendly dinner table.\"<ref name=\"pinney\" /> By January 1896, he had decided<ref name=\"carrington\" /> to end his family's \"good wholesome life\" in the US and seek their fortunes elsewhere.\n\nA family dispute became the final straw. For some time, relations between Carrie and her brother Beatty Balestier had been strained, owing to his drinking and insolvency. In May 1896, an inebriated Beatty encountered Kipling on the street and threatened him with physical harm.<ref name=\"gilmour\" /> The incident led to Beatty's eventual arrest, but in the subsequent hearing and the resulting publicity, Kipling's privacy was destroyed, and he was left feeling miserable and exhausted. In July 1896, a week before the hearing was to resume, the Kiplings packed their belongings, left the United States and returned to England.<ref name=\"carrington\" />\n\n[[File:Rock House - geograph.org.uk - 1082515.jpg|thumb|Kipling's Torquay house, with an English heritage [[blue plaque]] on the wall.]]\n\n===Devon===\nBy September 1896, the Kiplings were in [[Torquay]], Devon, on the south-western coast of England, in a hillside home overlooking the [[English Channel]]. Although Kipling did not much care for his new house, whose design, he claimed, left its occupants feeling dispirited and gloomy, he managed to remain productive and socially active.<ref name=\"gilmour\" />\n\nKipling was now a famous man, and in the previous two or three years had increasingly been making political pronouncements in his writings. The Kiplings had welcomed their first son, [[John Kipling|John]], in August 1897. Kipling had begun work on two poems, \"[[Recessional (poem)|Recessional]]\" (1897) and \"[[The White Man's Burden]]\" (1899), which were to create controversy when published. Regarded by some as anthems for enlightened and duty-bound empire-building (capturing the mood of the [[Victorian era]]), the poems were seen by others as propaganda for brazen-faced [[imperialism]] and its attendant racial attitudes; still others saw irony in the poems and warnings of the perils of empire.<ref name=\"gilmour\" />\n\n<blockquote><poem>Take up the White Man's burden\u2014\nSend forth the best ye breed\u2014\nGo, bind your sons to exile\nTo serve your captives' need;\nTo wait, in heavy harness,\nOn fluttered folk and wild\u2014\nYour new-caught sullen peoples,\nHalf devil and half child.\n\u2014''The White Man's Burden''<ref name=\"wmb\">Kipling, Rudyard. 1899.

Kipling cultivated their friendship and came to admire the men and their politics. The period 1898\u20131910 was crucial in the history of South Africa and included the [[Second Boer War]] (1899\u20131902), the ensuing peace treaty, and the 1910 formation of the [[Union of South Africa]]. Back in England, Kipling wrote poetry in support of the British cause in the Boer War and on his next visit to South Africa in early 1900, became a correspondent for ''The Friend'' newspaper in [[Bloemfontein]], which had been commandeered by [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] for British troops.<ref>Reilly, Bernard F., Center for Research Libraries, Chicago, Illinois.

On 7 September 1911, the [[Montreal Star|''Montreal Daily Star'']] newspaper published a front-page appeal against the agreement by Kipling, who wrote: \"It is her own soul that Canada risks today. Once that soul is pawned for any consideration, Canada must inevitably conform to the commercial, legal, financial, social, and ethical standards which will be imposed on her by the sheer admitted weight of the United States.\"<ref name=\"MacKenzie, David page 211\" /> At the time, the ''Montreal Daily Star'' was Canada's most read newspaper. Over the next week, Kipling's appeal was reprinted in every English newspaper in Canada and is credited with helping to turn Canadian public opinion against the Liberal government.<ref name=\"MacKenzie, David page 211\" />\n\nKipling sympathised with the anti-[[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Home Rule]] stance of [[Irish Unionists]], who opposed Irish autonomy. He was friends with [[Edward Carson]], the Dublin-born leader of [[Ulster Unionism]], who raised the [[Ulster Volunteers]] to prevent Home Rule in Ireland. Kipling wrote in a letter to a friend that Ireland was not a nation, and that before the English arrived in 1169, the Irish were a gang of cattle thieves living in savagery and killing each other while \"writing dreary poems\" about it all. In his view it was only British rule that allowed Ireland to advance.<ref>[[#Gilmour|Gilmour]], p. 242.</ref> A visit to Ireland in 1911 confirmed Kipling's prejudices.

Thus thousands of British soldiers were now paying with their lives for their failure in the fields of France and Belgium.<ref name=\"Gilmour, David page 251\" />\n\nKipling had scorn for men who shirked duty in the First World War.

However, Kipling was indeed emotionally devastated by the death of his son. He is said to have assuaged his grief by reading the novels of [[Jane Austen]] aloud to his wife and daughter.<ref>\"The Many Lovers of Miss Jane Austen\", BBC2 broadcast, 9&nbsp;pm 23 December 2011</ref> During the war, he wrote a booklet ''[[The Fringes of the Fleet]]''<ref>''The Fringes of the Fleet'', Macmillan & Co., 1916.</ref> containing essays and poems on various nautical subjects of the war. Some of these were set to music by the English composer [[Edward Elgar]].\n\nKipling became friends with a French soldier named Maurice Hammoneau, whose life had been saved in the First World War when his copy of ''Kim'', which he had in his left breast pocket, stopped a bullet. Hammoneau presented Kipling with the book, with bullet still embedded, and his [[Croix de Guerre]] as a token of gratitude. They continued to correspond, and when Hammoneau had a son, Kipling insisted on returning the book and medal.<ref>Original correspondence between Kipling and Maurice Hammoneau and his son Jean Hammoneau concerning the affair at the Library of Congress under the title: '' How \"Kim\" saved the life of a French soldier: a remarkable series of autograph letters of Rudyard Kipling, with the soldier's Croix de Guerre, 1918\u20131933.'' {{lccn|2007566938}}.

His main contributions to the project were his selection of the biblical phrase, \"[[Their Name Liveth For Evermore]]\" ([[Sirach|Ecclesiasticus]] 44.14, KJV), found on the [[Stone of Remembrance|Stones of Remembrance]] in larger war cemeteries, and his suggestion of the phrase \"Known unto God\" for the gravestones of unidentified servicemen. He also chose the inscription \"The Glorious Dead\" on the [[Cenotaph#The Cenotaph, London|Cenotaph]], Whitehall, London. Additionally, he wrote a two-volume history of the [[Irish Guards]], his son's regiment, published in 1923 and seen as one of the finest examples of regimental history.<ref>Kipling, Rudyard (1923).

With the increasing popularity of the automobile, Kipling became a motoring correspondent for the British press, writing enthusiastically of trips around England and abroad, though he was usually driven by a chauffeur.\n\nAfter the war, Kipling was sceptical of the [[Fourteen Points]] and the [[League of Nations]], but had hopes that the United States would abandon isolationism and the post-war world be dominated by an Anglo-French-American alliance.<ref name=\"Gilmour, David page 273\">[[#Gilmour|Gilmour]], p. 273.</ref> He hoped the United States would take on a League of Nations mandate for Armenia as the best way of preventing isolationism, and hoped that [[Theodore Roosevelt]], whom Kipling admired, would again become president.<ref name=\"Gilmour, David page 273\" /> Kipling was saddened by Roosevelt's death in 1919, believing him to be the only American politician capable of keeping the United States in the \"game\" of world politics.<ref>[[#Gilmour|Gilmour]], pp. 273\u2013274.</ref>\n\nKipling was hostile towards [[communism]], writing of the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik take-over]] in 1917 that one sixth of the world had \"passed bodily out of civilization.\"<ref name=\"auto6\">[[#Hodgson|Hodgson]], p. 1060.</ref> In a 1918 poem, Kipling wrote of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] that everything good in Russia had been destroyed by the Bolsheviks \u2013 all that was left was \"the sound of weeping and the sight of burning fire, and the shadow of a people trampled into the mire.\" <ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\nIn 1920, Kipling co-founded the [[Liberty League (Historic)|Liberty League]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jot101.com/2015/11/the-liberty-league-campaign-agains/ |title=The Liberty League \u2013 a campaign against Bolshevism |website=jot101.com |access-date=2 January 2017}}</ref> with [[H.

Although he had no direct connexion with any political party, Kipling was a Conservative, a thing that does not exist nowadays. Those who now call themselves Conservatives are either Liberals, Fascists or the accomplices of Fascists. He identified himself with the ruling power and not with the opposition. In a gifted writer this seems to us strange and even disgusting, but it did have the advantage of giving Kipling a certain grip on reality. The ruling power is always faced with the question, 'In such and such circumstances, what would you ''do?''<nowiki>'</nowiki>, whereas the opposition is not obliged to take responsibility or make any real decisions. Where it is a permanent and pensioned opposition, as in England, the quality of its thought deteriorates accordingly. Moreover, anyone who starts out with a pessimistic, reactionary view of life tends to be justified by events, for Utopia never arrives and 'the gods of the copybook headings', as Kipling himself put it, always return. Kipling sold out to the British governing class, not financially but emotionally. This warped his political judgement, for the British ruling class were not what he imagined, and it led him into abysses of folly and snobbery, but he gained a corresponding advantage from having at least tried to imagine what action and responsibility are like. It is a great thing in his favour that he is not witty, not 'daring', has no wish to ''[[\u00c9pater la bourgeoisie|\u00e9pater les bourgeois]]''. He dealt largely in platitudes, and since we live in a world of platitudes, much of what he said sticks. Even his worst follies seem less shallow and less irritating than the 'enlightened' utterances of the same period, such as Wilde's epigrams or the collection of cracker-mottoes at the end of ''[[Man and Superman]]''.|George Orwell<ref>{{cite journal |last=Orwell |first=George |title=Rudyard Kipling |journal=[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]] |date=February 1942 |url=http://orwell.ru/library/reviews/kipling/english/e_rkip |accessdate=4 December 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1939, the poet W.H. Auden celebrated KIpling in a similarly left-handed way in his elegy for William Butler Yeats. Auden deleted this section from more recent editions of his poems.\n<blockquote><poem>\nTime, that is intolerant\nOf the brave and innocent,\nAnd indifferent in a week\nTo a beautiful physique,\n\nWorships language, and forgives\nEveryone by whom it lives;\nPardons cowardice, conceit,\nLays its honours at his feet.\n\nTime, that with this strange excuse,\nPardons Kipling and his views,\nAnd will pardon Paul Claudel,\nPardons him for writing well.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~cavitch/pdf-library/Auden_InMemoryOfWBYeats.pdf|title=Selected Poems|last=Auden|first=W.

He recorded several albums of Kipling's verse set to traditional airs, or to tunes of his own composition written in traditional style.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/26/arts/peter-bellamy-47-british-folk-singer-who-wrote-opera.html |title=Peter Bellamy, 47; British Folk Singer Who Wrote Opera |first=Jon |last=Pareles |date=26 September 1991 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref> However, in the case of the bawdy folk song, \"[[The Bastard King of England]],\"  which is commonly credited to Kipling, it is believed that the song is actually misattributed.<ref name=\"bastardking\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fresnostate.edu/folklore/ballads/EM122.html |title=Bastard King of England, The |publisher=fresnostate.edu}}</ref>\n\nKipling is often quoted in discussions of contemporary British political and social issues. In 1911, Kipling wrote the poem ''The Reeds of Runnymede'' that celebrated [[Magna Carta]], and summoned up a vision of the \"stubborn Englishry\" determined to defend their rights. In 1996, the following verses of the poem were quoted by former Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] warning against the encroachment of the [[European Union]] on national sovereignty:\n<blockquote><poem>At Runnymede, at Runnymede,\nOh, hear the reeds at Runnymede:\n\u2018You musn\u2019t sell, delay, deny,\nA freeman\u2019s right or liberty.\nIt wakes the stubborn Englishry,\nWe saw \u2019em roused at Runnymede!\n\n\u2026 And still when Mob or Monarch lays\nToo rude a hand on English ways,\nThe whisper wakes, the shudder plays,\nAcross the reeds at Runnymede.\nAnd Thames, that knows the mood of kings,\nAnd crowds and priests and suchlike things,\nRolls deep and dreadful as he brings\nTheir warning down from Runnymede!<ref>[https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/108353 \u201cKeith Joseph Memorial Lecture (\"Liberty and Limited Government\")\u201d].

Throughout their lives, Kipling and his wife Carrie maintained an active interest in Camp Mowglis, which still continues the traditions that Kipling inspired. Buildings at Mowglis have names such as [[Akela (The Jungle Book)|Akela]], [[Toomai of the Elephants|Toomai]], [[Baloo]], and Panther. The campers are referred to as \"the Pack,\"  from the youngest \"Cubs\" to the oldest living in \"Den.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Mowglis |url=http://www.mowglis.org/about/history/ |accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nKipling's links with the [[Scouting]] movements were also strong. [[Robert Baden-Powell]], founder of Scouting, used many themes from ''Jungle Book'' stories and ''Kim'' in setting up his junior Wolf Cubs. These ties still exist, such as the popularity of \"[[Kim's Game]].\"  The movement is named after [[Mowgli]]'s adopted wolf family, and adult helpers of Wolf Cub Packs take names from ''The Jungle Book'', especially the adult leader called ''[[Akela (The Jungle Book)|Akela]]'' after the leader of the Seeonee wolf pack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/history/cubs/index.htm#Jungle |title=ScoutBase UK: The Library \u2013 Scouting history \u2013 Me Too! \u2013 The history of Cubbing in the United Kingdom 1916\u2013present |publisher=Scoutbase.org.uk |accessdate=10 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125044919/http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/history/cubs/index.htm#Jungle|archivedate=25 November 2005 }}</ref>\n\n===Kipling's Burwash home===\n[[File:Bateman's.jpg|thumb|[[Bateman's]], Kipling's beloved home \u2013 which he referred to as \"A good and peaceable place\" \u2013 in [[Burwash, East Sussex|Burwash]], East Sussex, is now a public museum dedicated to the author<ref name=\"nationaltrust.org.uk\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/batemans/features/history-at-batemans |title=History at Bateman's |website=National Trust |date=22 February 2019}}</ref>]]\nAfter the death of Kipling's wife in 1939, his house, [[Bateman's]] in [[Burwash, East Sussex]], where he had lived from 1902 until 1936, was bequeathed to the [[National Trust]].

Allmusic.</ref>\n\n===Reputation in India===\nIn modern-day India, whence he drew much of his material, Kipling's reputation remains controversial, especially amongst modern nationalists and some post-colonial critics. Rudyard Kipling was a prominent supporter of Colonel [[Reginald Dyer]], who was responsible for the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]] in [[Amritsar]] (in the province of [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]]). Kipling called Dyer \"the man who saved India\" and initiated collections for the latter's homecoming prize.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1130221/jsp/frontpage/story_16587696.jsp |title=History repeats itself, in stopping short |website=telegraphindia.com}}</ref> However, Subhash Chopra writes in his book ''Kipling Sahib \u2013 the Raj Patriot'' that the benefit fund was started by ''[[The Morning Post]]'' newspaper, not by Kipling, and that Kipling made no contribution to the Dyer fund. While Kipling's name was conspicuously absent from the list of donors as published in ''The Morning Post'', he clearly admired Dyer.<ref>{{cite book |title=Kipling Sahib: the Raj patriot |author=Subhash Chopra |publisher=New Millennium |year=2016 |location=London |isbn=978-1858454405}}</ref>\n\nOther contemporary Indian intellectuals such as [[Ashis Nandy]] have taken a more nuanced view. [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the first Prime Minister of independent India, often described Kipling's novel ''[[Kim (novel)|Kim]]'' as one of his favourite books.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AtESAq0zPZAC&pg=PA137 Globalization and educational rights: an intercivilizational analysis], Joel H.

Sports]] (Yahoo!).\n\nCurrently, the NCAA compiles consensus all-America teams in the sports of [[NCAA Division I#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-FBS]] football and Division I men's basketball using a point system computed from All-America teams named by coaches associations or media sources.  The system consists of three points for a first-team honor, two points for second-team honor, and one point for third-team honor.  Honorable mention and fourth team or lower recognitions are not accorded any points.  Football consensus teams are compiled by position and the player accumulating the most points at each position is named first team consensus all-American.  Currently, the NCAA recognizes All-Americans selected by the '''AP, AFCA, FWAA, ''TSN'', and the WCFF''' to determine Consensus and Unanimous All-Americans. Any player named to the First Team by all five of the NCAA-recognized selectors is deemed a Unanimous All-American.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |title=2010-11 NCAA Statistics Policies(updated 9/15/2010) |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |archivedate=December 10, 2011 |date=September 15, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63plxMYlJ?url=http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/ncaa-football/news/alabamas-tua-tagovailoa-2018-consensus-all-american-team/u4gei2bnxvig1jmptsbwhsj97 2018 Consensus All-America Team]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" \n|-\n!

Sports]] (Yahoo!).\n\nCurrently, the NCAA compiles consensus all-America teams in the sports of [[NCAA Division I#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-FBS]] football and Division I men's basketball using a point system computed from All-America teams named by coaches associations or media sources.  The system consists of three points for a first-team honor, two points for second-team honor, and one point for third-team honor.  Honorable mention and fourth team or lower recognitions are not accorded any points.  Football consensus teams are compiled by position and the player accumulating the most points at each position is named first team consensus all-American.  Currently, the NCAA recognizes All-Americans selected by the '''AP, AFCA, FWAA, ''TSN'', and the WCFF''' to determine Consensus and Unanimous All-Americans.

And this doesn't help with my homework at all.\n\n\nThe [[persecution of Christians]] in the [[Roman Empire]] was carried out by the state and also by local authorities on a sporadic, ''ad hoc'' basis, often at the whims of local communities. Starting in 250 AD, empire-wide persecution took place as an indirect consequence of an edict by the emperor [[Decius]]. This edict was in force for eighteen months, during which time some Christians were killed while others [[Apostasy in Christianity|apostatised]] to escape execution.\n\nThese persecutions heavily influenced the development of Christianity, shaping [[Christian theology]] and the structure of the [[Christian Church|Church]]. The effects of the persecutions included the writing of [[Christian apologetics|explanations and defenses]] of the Christian religion.\n\n== Duration and extent ==\nPersecution of the early church had occurred sporadically and in localised areas since its beginning. The first persecution of Christians organised by the Roman government took place under the emperor [[Nero]] in 64 AD after the [[Great Fire of Rome]]. The [[Edict of Serdica]] was issued in 311 by the Roman emperor [[Galerius]], officially ending the [[Diocletianic persecution]] of [[Christianity]] in the East. With the passage in 313 AD of the [[Edict of Milan]], persecution of Christians by the Roman state ceased.<ref name=ReligionFacts>{{cite web |title=Persecution in the Early Church |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/history/persecution.htm |publisher=Religion Facts |accessdate=2014-03-26}}</ref> The total number of Christians who lost their lives because of these persecutions is unknown; although early church historian [[Eusebius]], whose works are the only source for many of these events, speaks of \"great multitudes\" having perished, he is thought by many scholars today to have exaggerated their numbers.<ref name=\"ReligionFacts\" /><ref name=\"Moss\">Moss 2013</ref>{{rp|217\u2013233}} \n\nThere was no empire-wide persecution of Christians until the reign of [[Decius]] in the third century.<ref name=martin>Martin, D. 2010.

Roman law was largely concerned with property rights, leaving many gaps in criminal and public law.  Thus the process ''cognitio extra ordinem'' (\"special investigation\") filled the legal void left by both code and court. All [[Roman province|provincial]] governors had the right to run trials in this way as part of their ''[[imperium]]'' in the province.<ref name=croix />{{rp|114f}}\n\nIn ''cognitio extra ordinem'', an accuser called a ''[[delator]]'' brought before the governor an individual to be charged with a certain offense\u2014in this case, that of being a Christian. This delator was prepared to act as the prosecutor for the trial, and could be rewarded with some of the accused's property if he made an adequate case or charged with ''calumnia'' ([[malicious prosecution]]) if his case was insufficient. If the governor agreed to hear the case\u2014and he was free not to\u2014he oversaw the trial from start to finish: he heard the arguments, decided on the verdict, and passed the sentence.<ref name=croix />{{rp|116}} Christians sometimes offered themselves up for punishment, and the hearings of such [[Christian martyrs|voluntary martyrs]] were conducted in the same way.\n\nMore often than not, the outcome of the case was wholly subject to the governor's personal opinion. While some tried to rely on precedent or imperial opinion where they could, as evidenced by [[Pliny the Younger on Christians|Pliny the Younger's letter to Trajan concerning the Christians]],<ref>Pliny the Younger. ''Epistulae'' 10.96-97 at www.earlychristianwritings.com/pliny.html on June 6, 2012.</ref> such guidance was often unavailable.<ref Name=Barnes>Barnes 1968.</ref>{{rp|35}} In many cases months' and weeks' travel away from Rome, these governors had to make decisions about running their provinces according to their own instincts and knowledge.\n\nEven if these governors had easy access to the city, they would not have found much official legal guidance on the matter of the Christians. Before the anti-Christian policies under [[Decius]] beginning in 250, there was no empire-wide edict against the Christians, and the only solid precedent was that set by Trajan in his reply to Pliny: the name of \"Christian\" alone was sufficient grounds for punishment and Christians were not to be sought out by the government. There is speculation that Christians were also condemned for [[contumacy|contumacia]]\u2014disobedience toward the magistrate, akin to the modern \"contempt of court\"\u2014but the evidence on this matter is mixed.<ref name=croix />{{rp|124}} [[Melito of Sardis]] later asserted that [[Antoninus Pius]] ordered that Christians were not to be executed without proper trial.<ref Name=Barnes />{{rp|37}}\n\nGiven the lack of guidance and distance of imperial supervision, the outcomes of the trials of Christians varied widely. Many followed Pliny's formula: they asked if the accused individuals were Christians, gave those who answered in the affirmative a chance to recant, and offered those who denied or recanted a chance to prove their sincerity by making a sacrifice to the Roman gods and swearing by the emperor's [[Imperial cult|genius]]. Those who persisted were executed.\n\nAccording to the Christian apologist [[Tertullian]], some governors in Africa helped accused Christians secure acquittals or refused to bring them to trial.<ref name=croix />{{rp|117}} Overall, Roman governors were more interested in making apostates than martyrs: one proconsul of Asia, [[Gnaeus Arrius Antoninus|Arrius Antoninus]], when confronted with a group of voluntary martyrs during one of his assize tours, sent a few to be executed and snapped at the rest, \"If you want to die, you wretches, you can use ropes or precipices.\"<ref name=croix />{{rp|137}}\n\nDuring the [[Diocletianic Persecution|Great Persecution]] which lasted from 303 to 312/313, governors were given direct edicts from the emperor. Christian churches and texts were to be destroyed, meeting for Christian worship was forbidden, and those Christians who refused to recant lost their legal rights. Later, it was ordered that Christian clergy be arrested and that all inhabitants of the empire sacrifice to the gods. Still, no specific punishment was prescribed by these edicts and governors retained the leeway afforded to them by distance.<ref>De Ste Croix, G.E.M. \"Aspects of the 'Great' Persecution.\" Harvard Theological Review. Vol. 47. No. 2. (April 1964): 75-78.</ref> [[Lactantius]] reported that some governors claimed to have shed no Christian blood,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">De Ste Croix, \"Aspects of the 'Great' Persecution,\" 103.</ref> and there is evidence that others turned a blind eye to evasions of the edict or only enforced it when absolutely necessary.\n\n=== Government motivation ===\n{{See also|Military saint}}\n{{Ancient Roman religion}}\nWhen a governor was sent to a province, he was charged with the task of keeping it ''pacata atque quieta''\u2014settled and orderly.<ref name=croix />{{rp|121}} His primary interest would be to keep the populace happy; thus when unrest against the Christians arose in his jurisdiction, he would be inclined to placate it with appeasement lest the populace \"vent itself in riots and lynching.\"<ref name=croix />{{rp|122}}\n\nPolitical leaders in the Roman Empire were also public cult leaders. [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] revolved around public ceremonies and sacrifices; personal belief was not as central an element as it is in many modern faiths. Thus while the private beliefs of Christians may have been largely immaterial to many Roman elites, this public religious practice was in their estimation critical to the social and political well-being of both the local community and the empire as a whole. Honoring tradition in the right way \u2013 ''[[pietas]]'' \u2013 was key to stability and success.<ref>Barnes, \"The Piety of a Persecutor.\"</ref> Hence the Romans protected the integrity of cults practiced by communities under their rule, seeing it as inherently correct to honor one's ancestral traditions; for this reason the Romans for a long time tolerated the highly exclusive Jewish sect, even though some Romans despised it.<ref name=croix />{{rp|135}} Historian [[Hayim Hillel Ben-Sasson|H.

In the 3rd century, the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>How can people not be in every way impious and atheistic who have apostatized from the customs of our ancestors through which every nation and city is sustained?&nbsp;... What else are they than fighters against God?<ref>Robert L. Wilkin, ibid., p. 19.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOnce distinguished from Judaism, Christianity was no longer seen as simply a bizarre sect of an old and venerable religion; it was a ''[[superstitio]]''.<ref name=croix />{{rp|135}} Superstition had for the Romans a much more powerful and dangerous connotation than it does for much of the Western world today: to them, this term meant a set of religious practices that were not only different, but corrosive to society, \"disturbing a man's mind in such a way that he is really going insane\" and causing him to lose humanitas (humanity).<ref>Janssen, L.F. \"'Superstitio' and the Persecution of the Christians.\" Vigilae Christianae.

Christians' beliefs would not have endeared them to many government officials: they worshipped a convicted criminal, refused to swear by the emperor's genius, harshly criticized Rome in their holy books, and suspiciously conducted their rites in private. In the early third century one magistrate told Christians \"I cannot bring myself so much as to listen to people who speak ill of the Roman way of religion.\"<ref>\"The World of Late Antiquity\", Peter Brown, p. 17, Thames and Hudson, 1971, {{ISBN|0-500-32022-5}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Saint Blaise Louvre OAR504.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Saint Blaise]] on trial before the Roman governor, Louvre]]\n\n=== Overview ===\nPrior to the reign of [[Decius]] (249-251 AD), the only known incident of persecution by the Roman state occurred under Nero in 64 AD.

There is no evidence that the decree was intended to target Christians but was intended as a form of loyalty oath. Decius authorized [[roving commission]]s visiting the cities and villages to supervise the execution of the sacrifices and to deliver written certificates to all citizens who performed them. Christians were often given opportunities to avoid further punishment by publicly offering sacrifices or burning incense to Roman gods, and were accused by the Romans of impiety when they refused. Refusal was punished by arrest, imprisonment, torture, and executions. Christians fled to safe havens in the countryside and some purchased their certificates, called ''libelli.'' Several councils held at [[Carthage]] debated the extent to which the community should accept these [[lapsi (Christianity)|lapsed Christians]].\n\nThe persecutions culminated with [[Diocletian]] and [[Galerius]] at the end of the third and beginning of the 4th century. Their anti-Christian actions, considered the largest, were to be the last major Roman pagan action. The [[Edict of Serdica]], also called [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]], was issued in 311 in [[Sofia|Serdica]] (today [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]) by the Roman emperor [[Galerius]], officially ending the [[Diocletianic persecution]] of [[Christianity]] in the East. [[Constantine the Great]] soon came into power and in 313 completely legalized Christianity. It was not until [[Theodosius I]] in the latter 4th century, however, that Christianity would become the official religion of the Roman Empire.\n\n=== 64\u2013250 ===\n\n[[File:Young Folks' History of Rome illus315.png|thumb|300px|\"Persecution of the Christians\", ''Young Folks' History of Rome'' (1878).]]\nPrior to Nero's accusation of arson and subsequent anti-Christian actions in 64, all animosity was apparently limited to intramural Jewish hostility. In the [[New Testament]] (Acts 18:2-3), a Jew named [[Priscilla and Aquila|Aquila]] is introduced who, with his wife [[Priscilla and Aquila|Priscilla]], had recently come from Italy because emperor [[Claudius]] \"had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome\".

[[Eusebius]] wrote that Flavia Domitilla was banished because she was a Christian. However, in [[Cassius Dio]]'s account (67.14.1-2), he only reports that she, along with many others, was guilty of sympathy for Judaism.<ref Name=Barnes />{{rp|36}} Suetonius does not mention the exile at all.<ref Name=Barnes />{{rp|37}} According to Keresztes, it is more probable that they were [[Proselytes|converts to Judaism]] who attempted to evade payment of the [[Fiscus Judaicus]] \u2013 the tax imposed on all persons who practiced Judaism (262-265).<ref name=Brown /> In any case, no stories of anti-Christian activities during Domitian's reign reference any sort of legal ordinances.<ref Name=Barnes />{{rp|35}}\n\n=== Trajan ===\nAs a civilian emperor, [[Trajan]] corresponded with [[Pliny the Younger]] on the subject of how to deal with the [[Christianity|Christians]] of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], telling [[Pliny the Younger on Christians|Pliny]] to continue to persecute Christians but not to accept anonymous denunciations in the interests of justice as well as of \"the spirit of the age\". Non-citizens who admitted to being Christians and refused to recant, however, were to be executed \"for obstinacy\". Citizens were sent to Rome for trial.[[Trajan#cite%20note-153|[153]]]  \n\nDespite this, [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Christian theologians considered Trajan to be a  [[virtuous pagan]].[[Trajan#cite%20note-5|[5]]] \n\n=== Hadrian ===\nThe emperor [[Hadrian]] (r. 117-138) also responding to a request for advice from a provincial governor about how to deal with Christians, granted Christians more leniency. Hadrian stated that merely being a Christian was not enough for action against them to be taken, they must also have committed some illegal act. In addition, \"slanderous attacks\" against Christians were not to be tolerated, meaning that anyone who brought an action against Christians but failed would face punishment themselves.\n\n=== Marcus Aurelius to Maximinus the Thracian ===\n[[File:Amphiteatre Trois Gaules Lyon.jpg|right|thumb|''Amphith\u00e9\u00e2tre des Trois-Gaules'', in Lyon. The pole in the arena is a memorial to the people killed during this persecution.]]\nSporadic bouts of anti-Christian activity occurred during the period from the reign of Marcus Aurelius to that of Maximinus.

The extent to which Marcus Aurelius himself directed, encouraged, or was aware of these persecutions is unclear and much debated by historians.<ref>{{cite book |last=McLynn |first=Frank |title=Marcus Aurelius: A Life |year=2009 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-306-81830-1 |page=295}}</ref> One of the most notable instances of persecution during the reign of Aurelius occurred in 177 at [[Lugdunum]] (present-day Lyons, France), where the [[Sanctuary of the Three Gauls]] had been established by [[Augustus]] in the late 1st century BC. The sole account is preserved by [[Eusebius]]. The persecution in Lyons started as an unofficial movement to ostracize Christians from public spaces such as the market and [[thermae|the baths]], but eventually resulted in official action. Christians were arrested, tried in the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]], and subsequently imprisoned.<ref name=\"Oxford Dictionary\">The Oxford Dictionary of the Saints, \"Martyrs of Lyons\"</ref> They were condemned to various punishments: being fed to the beasts, torture, and the poor living conditions of imprisonment. Slaves belonging to Christians testified that their masters participated in incest and cannibalism. Barnes cites this persecution as the \"one example of suspected Christians being punished even after apostasy.\"<ref Name=Barnes />{{rp|154}} Eusebius, however, wrote his Ecclesiastical History in roughly 300 AD or 120 years after the events that he referenced and it is unclear if this event ever occurred. Moreover, the church father [[Irenaeus]], the Christian Bishop of [[Lyon]], where this incident allegedly took place, wrote his five volume Adversus Haereses in 180, just three years after the alleged persecution but makes no mention whatsoever of any persecution which happened in his city. Instead Irenaus writes: \u201cThe Romans have given the world peace, and we [Christians] travel without fear along the roads and across the sea wherever we will.\u201d (Against Heresies, Book IV, Chapter 30, Sentence 3). \n[[File:Chamb\u0153uf-Martyre de sainte Blandine-20121006.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Martyrdom of Saint [[Blandina]], one of the martyrs of Lyons, stained glass window by Alexandre Mauvernay]]\nA number of persecutions of Christians occurred in the Roman empire during the reign of [[Septimius Severus]] (193-211).The traditional view has been that Severus was responsible.

This may reflect a decrease in hostility toward Christianity or gaps in the available sources.<ref Name=Barnes />{{rp|35}} Perhaps the most famous of these post-Severan persecutions are those attributed to [[Maximinus Thrax|Maximinus the Thracian]] (r. 235-238). According to Eusebius, a persecution undertaken by Maximinus against heads of the church in 235 sent both [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] and [[Pope Pontian]] into exile on Sardinia. Other evidence suggests the persecution of 235 was local to Cappadocia and Pontus, and not set in motion by the emperor.<ref name=\"Cambridge\" />{{rp|623}}\n\n==== Punishments ====\n\nChristians who refused to recant by performing ceremonies to honour the gods would meet with severe penalties; Roman citizens were exiled or condemned to a swift death by beheading.

He never returned as he was taken captive and died a prisoner. However he sent two letters regarding Christians to the Senate. The first, in 257, ordered all Christian clergy to perform sacrifices to the Roman gods and forbade Christians from holding meetings in cemeteries.<ref name=\"Moss\" />{{rp|151}} A second letter the following year ordered that bishops and other high-ranking church officials were to be put to death, and that senators and [[equites]] who were Christians were to be stripped of their titles and lose their property. If they would not perform sacrifices to the gods they also were to be executed. Roman matrons who would not apostatize were to lose their property and be banished, while civil servants and members of the Emperor's staff and household who refused to sacrifice would be reduced to slavery and sent to work on the Imperial estates.<ref name=frend />{{rp|325}} The fact that there were such high ranking Christians at the very heart of the Roman imperial establishment shows both that the actions taken by Decius less than a decade before had not had a lasting effect and that Christians did not face constant persecution or hide from public view.<ref name=frend />{{rp|326}}\n\nAmong those executed under Valerian were [[Cyprian]], Bishop of Carthage, and [[Pope Sixtus II|Sixtus II, Bishop of Rome]] with his deacons including [[Saint Lawrence]]. The public examination of Cyprian by the proconsul in Carthage, Galerius Maximus, on 14 September 258 has been preserved:<ref name=frend />{{rp|327}}\n\n<blockquote>''Galerius Maximus'': \"Are you Thascius Cyprianus?\" ''Cyprian'': \"I am.\" ''Galerius'': \"The most sacred Emperors have commanded you to conform to the Roman rites.\" ''Cyprian'': \"I refuse.\" ''Galerius'': \"Take heed for yourself.\" ''Cyprian'': \"Do as you are bid; in so clear a case I may not take heed.\" ''Galerius'', after briefly conferring with his judicial council, with much reluctance pronounced the following sentence: \"You have long lived an irreligious life, and have drawn together a number of men bound by an unlawful association, and professed yourself an open enemy to the gods and the religion of Rome; and the pious, most sacred and august Emperors&nbsp;... have endeavoured in vain to bring you back to conformity with their religious observances; whereas therefore you have been apprehended as principal and ringleader in these infamous crimes, you shall be made an example to those whom you have wickedly associated with you; the authority of law shall be ratified in your blood.\" He then read the sentence of the court from a written tablet: \"It is the sentence of this court that Thascius Cyprianus be executed with the sword.\" ''Cyprian'': \"Thanks be to God.\u201d</blockquote>\n\nTaken directly to the place of execution, Cyprian was decapitated. The words of the sentence show that in the eyes of the Roman state, Christianity was not a religion at all, and the church was a criminal organisation. When Valerian's son [[Gallienus]] became Emperor in 260, the legislation was revoked, and this brief period of persecution came to an end; this period of relative toleration between his accession to the next mass persecution is known as the [[Little Peace of the Church]].\n\nA warrant to arrest a Christian, dated 28 February 256, was found among the [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]] ([[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 3035|''P. Oxy'' 3035]]). The grounds for the arrest are not given in the document. Valerian's first act as emperor on 22 October 253 was to make his son Gallienus his Caesar and colleague. Early in his reign, affairs in Europe went from bad to worse, and the whole West fell into disorder. In the East, Antioch had fallen into the hands of a Sassanid vassal and Armenia was occupied by Shapur I (Sapor). Valerian and Gallienus split the problems of the empire between them, with the son taking the West, and the father heading East to face the Persian threat.\n\n=== Diocletian and Galerius ===\n[[File:\"Duomo di Milano\", cathedral in Milan, Italy. Statue of a martyr.jpg|300px|thumb| Statue of a martyr, [[Milan Cathedral]]]]\n{{Main|Diocletianic Persecution}}\nDiocletian's accession in 284 did not mark an immediate reversal of disregard to Christianity, but it did herald a gradual shift in official attitudes toward religious minorities. In the first fifteen years of his rule, Diocletian purged the army of Christians, condemned [[Manichaeism|Manicheans]] to death, and surrounded himself with public opponents of Christianity. Diocletian's preference for autocratic government, combined with his self-image as a restorer of past Roman glory, presaged the most pervasive persecution in Roman history. In the winter of 302, Galerius urged Diocletian to begin a general persecution of the Christians. Diocletian was wary, and asked the oracle of Apollo for guidance. The oracle's reply was read as an endorsement of Galerius's position, and a general persecution was called on 24 February 303.\n\nSupport for persecution within the Roman ruling class was not universal. Where Galerius and Diocletian were avid persecutors, [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]] was unenthusiastic. Later persecutory edicts, including the calls for all inhabitants to sacrifice to the Roman gods, were not applied in his domain. His son, [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]], on taking the imperial office in 306, restored Christians to full legal equality and returned property that had been confiscated during the persecution. In Italy in 306, the usurper [[Maxentius]] ousted Maximian's successor [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]], promising full religious toleration. Galerius ended the persecution in the East in 311, but it was resumed in [[Egypt]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and [[Asia Minor]] by his successor, [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]]. Constantine and Licinius, Severus's successor, signed the \"[[Edict of Milan]]\" in 313, which offered a more comprehensive acceptance of Christianity than Galerius's edict had provided. Licinius ousted Maximinus in 313, bringing an end to persecution in the East.\n\nThe persecution failed to check the rise of the church. By 324, Constantine was sole ruler of the empire, and Christianity had become his favored religion. Although the persecution resulted in death, torture, imprisonment, or dislocation for many Christians, the majority of the empire's Christians avoided punishment. The persecution did, however, cause many churches to split between those who had complied with imperial authority (the ''[[lapsi (Christianity)|lapsi]]'') and those who had held firm. Certain schisms, like those of the [[Donatist]]s in North Africa and the [[Melitians]] in Egypt, persisted long after the persecutions: only after 411 would the Donatists be reconciled to the church to which in 380 Emperor [[Theodosius I]] reserved the title of \"catholic\". The cult of the martyrs in the centuries that followed the end of the persecutions gave rise to accounts that exaggerated the barbarity of that era. These accounts were criticized during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and after, most notably by [[Edward Gibbon]]. Modern historians like [[G. E. M. de Ste. Croix]] have attempted to determine whether Christian sources exaggerated the scope of the persecution by Diocletian.\n\n== Martyrdom ==\n{{See also|Christian martyrs}}\n[[File:Herbert schmalz28.jpg|300px|thumb|\"Faithful Unto Death\" by [[Herbert Gustave Schmalz|Herbert Schmalz]]]]\nThe earliest Christian martyrs, tortured and killed by Roman officials enforcing worship of the gods, won so much fame among their co-religionists that others wished to imitate them to such an extent that a group presented themselves to the governor of Asia, declaring themselves to be Christians, and calling on him to do his duty and put them to death. He executed a few, but as the rest demanded it as well, he responded, exasperated, \"You wretches, if you want to die, you have cliffs to leap from and ropes to hang by.\" This attitude was sufficiently widespread for Church authorities to begin to distinguish sharply \"between solicited martyrdom and the more traditional kind that came as a result of persecution.\"<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=Bowersock+%22determined+to+enforce%22&btnG= G.W.

Since, under Roman law, capital punishment could only be enforced by provincial governors, and because, most of the time, these governors would be in residence at the capital, most martyrdoms would take place within Eusebius' jurisdiction. When they did not, as when the provincial governor traveled to other cities to perform assizes, their activities would be publicized throughout the province. Thus, if Eusebius were an assiduous reporter of the persecutions in his province, he could easily have acquired a full tally of all martyred dead.<ref name=\"Ste Croix, 101\">Ste Croix, 101</ref>\n\nEdward Gibbon, after lamenting the vagueness of Eusebius' phrasing, made the first estimate of number martyred as follows: by counting the total number of persons listed in the ''Martyrs'', dividing it by the years covered by Eusebius' text, multiplying it by the fraction of the Roman world the province of Palestine represents, and multiplying that figure by the total period of the persecution.<ref>[[Edward Gibbon]], ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', ed. David Womersley (London: Allen Lane, 1994), 1.578.</ref> Subsequent estimates have followed the same basic methodology.<ref>T. D. Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1981), 154, 357 n. 55.</ref>\n\nEusebius' aims in the ''Martyrs of Palestine'' have been disputed. Geoffrey de Ste Croix, historian and author of a pair of seminal articles on the persecution of Christians in the Roman world, argued, after Gibbon, that Eusebius aimed at producing a full account of the martyrs in his province. Eusebius' aims, Ste Croix argued, were clear from the text of the ''Martyrs'': after describing Caesarea's martyrdoms for 310, the last to have taken place in the city, Eusebius writes, \"Such were the martyrdoms which took place at C\u00e6sarea during the entire period of the persecution\"; after describing the later mass executions at Phaeno, Eusebius writes, \"These martyrdoms were accomplished in Palestine during eight complete years; and this was a description of the persecution in our time.\"<ref>Eusebius, ''Martyrs of Palestine'' (S) 11.31, 13.11, tr. A. C. McGiffert, cited by Ste Croix, 101.</ref> Timothy Barnes, however, argues that Eusebius' intent was not as broad as the text cited by Ste Croix implies: \"Eusebius himself entitled the work 'About those who suffered martyrdom in Palestine' and his intention was to preserve the memories of the martyrs whom he knew, rather than to give a comprehensive account of how persecution affected the Roman province in which he lived.\"<ref Name=Barnes />{{rp|154}} The preface to the long recension of the ''Martyrs'' is cited:\n\n{{quote|It is meet, then, that the conflicts which were illustrious in various districts should be committed to writing by those who dwelt with the combatants in their districts.

Starting in 250 AD, empire-wide persecution took place as an indirect consequence of an edict by the emperor [[Decius]]. This edict was in force for eighteen months, during which time some Christians were killed while others [[Apostasy in Christianity|apostatised]] to escape execution.\n\nThese persecutions heavily influenced the development of Christianity, shaping [[Christian theology]] and the structure of the [[Christian Church|Church]]. The effects of the persecutions included the writing of [[Christian apologetics|explanations and defenses]] of the Christian religion.\n\n== Duration and extent ==\nPersecution of the early church had occurred sporadically and in localised areas since its beginning. The first persecution of Christians organised by the Roman government took place under the emperor [[Nero]] in 64 AD after the [[Great Fire of Rome]]. The [[Edict of Serdica]] was issued in 311 by the Roman emperor [[Galerius]], officially ending the [[Diocletianic persecution]] of [[Christianity]] in the East.

While some tried to rely on precedent or imperial opinion where they could, as evidenced by [[Pliny the Younger on Christians|Pliny the Younger's letter to Trajan concerning the Christians]],<ref>Pliny the Younger. ''Epistulae'' 10.96-97 at www.earlychristianwritings.com/pliny.html on June 6, 2012.</ref> such guidance was often unavailable.<ref Name=Barnes>Barnes 1968.</ref>{{rp|35}} In many cases months' and weeks' travel away from Rome, these governors had to make decisions about running their provinces according to their own instincts and knowledge.\n\nEven if these governors had easy access to the city, they would not have found much official legal guidance on the matter of the Christians. Before the anti-Christian policies under [[Decius]] beginning in 250, there was no empire-wide edict against the Christians, and the only solid precedent was that set by Trajan in his reply to Pliny: the name of \"Christian\" alone was sufficient grounds for punishment and Christians were not to be sought out by the government. There is speculation that Christians were also condemned for [[contumacy|contumacia]]\u2014disobedience toward the magistrate, akin to the modern \"contempt of court\"\u2014but the evidence on this matter is mixed.<ref name=croix />{{rp|124}} [[Melito of Sardis]] later asserted that [[Antoninus Pius]] ordered that Christians were not to be executed without proper trial.<ref Name=Barnes />{{rp|37}}\n\nGiven the lack of guidance and distance of imperial supervision, the outcomes of the trials of Christians varied widely. Many followed Pliny's formula: they asked if the accused individuals were Christians, gave those who answered in the affirmative a chance to recant, and offered those who denied or recanted a chance to prove their sincerity by making a sacrifice to the Roman gods and swearing by the emperor's [[Imperial cult|genius]]. Those who persisted were executed.\n\nAccording to the Christian apologist [[Tertullian]], some governors in Africa helped accused Christians secure acquittals or refused to bring them to trial.<ref name=croix />{{rp|117}} Overall, Roman governors were more interested in making apostates than martyrs: one proconsul of Asia, [[Gnaeus Arrius Antoninus|Arrius Antoninus]], when confronted with a group of voluntary martyrs during one of his assize tours, sent a few to be executed and snapped at the rest, \"If you want to die, you wretches, you can use ropes or precipices.\"<ref name=croix />{{rp|137}}\n\nDuring the [[Diocletianic Persecution|Great Persecution]] which lasted from 303 to 312/313, governors were given direct edicts from the emperor. Christian churches and texts were to be destroyed, meeting for Christian worship was forbidden, and those Christians who refused to recant lost their legal rights. Later, it was ordered that Christian clergy be arrested and that all inhabitants of the empire sacrifice to the gods. Still, no specific punishment was prescribed by these edicts and governors retained the leeway afforded to them by distance.<ref>De Ste Croix, G.E.M. \"Aspects of the 'Great' Persecution.\" Harvard Theological Review.

[[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] revolved around public ceremonies and sacrifices; personal belief was not as central an element as it is in many modern faiths. Thus while the private beliefs of Christians may have been largely immaterial to many Roman elites, this public religious practice was in their estimation critical to the social and political well-being of both the local community and the empire as a whole. Honoring tradition in the right way \u2013 ''[[pietas]]'' \u2013 was key to stability and success.<ref>Barnes, \"The Piety of a Persecutor.\"</ref> Hence the Romans protected the integrity of cults practiced by communities under their rule, seeing it as inherently correct to honor one's ancestral traditions; for this reason the Romans for a long time tolerated the highly exclusive Jewish sect, even though some Romans despised it.<ref name=croix />{{rp|135}} Historian [[Hayim Hillel Ben-Sasson|H.

Christians' beliefs would not have endeared them to many government officials: they worshipped a convicted criminal, refused to swear by the emperor's genius, harshly criticized Rome in their holy books, and suspiciously conducted their rites in private. In the early third century one magistrate told Christians \"I cannot bring myself so much as to listen to people who speak ill of the Roman way of religion.\"<ref>\"The World of Late Antiquity\", Peter Brown, p. 17, Thames and Hudson, 1971, {{ISBN|0-500-32022-5}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Saint Blaise Louvre OAR504.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Saint Blaise]] on trial before the Roman governor, Louvre]]\n\n=== Overview ===\nPrior to the reign of [[Decius]] (249-251 AD), the only known incident of persecution by the Roman state occurred under Nero in 64 AD.

There is no evidence that the decree was intended to target Christians but was intended as a form of loyalty oath. Decius authorized [[roving commission]]s visiting the cities and villages to supervise the execution of the sacrifices and to deliver written certificates to all citizens who performed them. Christians were often given opportunities to avoid further punishment by publicly offering sacrifices or burning incense to Roman gods, and were accused by the Romans of impiety when they refused. Refusal was punished by arrest, imprisonment, torture, and executions. Christians fled to safe havens in the countryside and some purchased their certificates, called ''libelli.'' Several councils held at [[Carthage]] debated the extent to which the community should accept these [[lapsi (Christianity)|lapsed Christians]].\n\nThe persecutions culminated with [[Diocletian]] and [[Galerius]] at the end of the third and beginning of the 4th century. Their anti-Christian actions, considered the largest, were to be the last major Roman pagan action. The [[Edict of Serdica]], also called [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]], was issued in 311 in [[Sofia|Serdica]] (today [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]) by the Roman emperor [[Galerius]], officially ending the [[Diocletianic persecution]] of [[Christianity]] in the East. [[Constantine the Great]] soon came into power and in 313 completely legalized Christianity. It was not until [[Theodosius I]] in the latter 4th century, however, that Christianity would become the official religion of the Roman Empire.\n\n=== 64\u2013250 ===\n\n[[File:Young Folks' History of Rome illus315.png|thumb|300px|\"Persecution of the Christians\", ''Young Folks' History of Rome'' (1878).]]\nPrior to Nero's accusation of arson and subsequent anti-Christian actions in 64, all animosity was apparently limited to intramural Jewish hostility. In the [[New Testament]] (Acts 18:2-3), a Jew named [[Priscilla and Aquila|Aquila]] is introduced who, with his wife [[Priscilla and Aquila|Priscilla]], had recently come from Italy because emperor [[Claudius]] \"had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome\".

The sole account is preserved by [[Eusebius]]. The persecution in Lyons started as an unofficial movement to ostracize Christians from public spaces such as the market and [[thermae|the baths]], but eventually resulted in official action.

Moreover, the church father [[Irenaeus]], the Christian Bishop of [[Lyon]], where this incident allegedly took place, wrote his five volume Adversus Haereses in 180, just three years after the alleged persecution but makes no mention whatsoever of any persecution which happened in his city. Instead Irenaus writes: \u201cThe Romans have given the world peace, and we [Christians] travel without fear along the roads and across the sea wherever we will.\u201d (Against Heresies, Book IV, Chapter 30, Sentence 3). \n[[File:Chamb\u0153uf-Martyre de sainte Blandine-20121006.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Martyrdom of Saint [[Blandina]], one of the martyrs of Lyons, stained glass window by Alexandre Mauvernay]]\nA number of persecutions of Christians occurred in the Roman empire during the reign of [[Septimius Severus]] (193-211).The traditional view has been that Severus was responsible.

Some African dioceses, however,  refused to re-admit them. Indirectly, the Decian persecution led to the [[Donatism|Donatist]] schism, because the Donatists refused to embrace those who had obtained the certificates.\n\n== Valerian ==\n[[File:PopesixtusII.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Martyrdom of Sixtus II under Valerian, 14c.]]\nThe emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] took the throne in 253 but from the following year he was away from Rome fighting the [[Persia]]ns who had conquered [[Antioch]]. He never returned as he was taken captive and died a prisoner. However he sent two letters regarding Christians to the Senate. The first, in 257, ordered all Christian clergy to perform sacrifices to the Roman gods and forbade Christians from holding meetings in cemeteries.<ref name=\"Moss\" />{{rp|151}} A second letter the following year ordered that bishops and other high-ranking church officials were to be put to death, and that senators and [[equites]] who were Christians were to be stripped of their titles and lose their property. If they would not perform sacrifices to the gods they also were to be executed. Roman matrons who would not apostatize were to lose their property and be banished, while civil servants and members of the Emperor's staff and household who refused to sacrifice would be reduced to slavery and sent to work on the Imperial estates.<ref name=frend />{{rp|325}} The fact that there were such high ranking Christians at the very heart of the Roman imperial establishment shows both that the actions taken by Decius less than a decade before had not had a lasting effect and that Christians did not face constant persecution or hide from public view.<ref name=frend />{{rp|326}}\n\nAmong those executed under Valerian were [[Cyprian]], Bishop of Carthage, and [[Pope Sixtus II|Sixtus II, Bishop of Rome]] with his deacons including [[Saint Lawrence]]. The public examination of Cyprian by the proconsul in Carthage, Galerius Maximus, on 14 September 258 has been preserved:<ref name=frend />{{rp|327}}\n\n<blockquote>''Galerius Maximus'': \"Are you Thascius Cyprianus?\" ''Cyprian'': \"I am.\" ''Galerius'': \"The most sacred Emperors have commanded you to conform to the Roman rites.\" ''Cyprian'': \"I refuse.\" ''Galerius'': \"Take heed for yourself.\" ''Cyprian'': \"Do as you are bid; in so clear a case I may not take heed.\" ''Galerius'', after briefly conferring with his judicial council, with much reluctance pronounced the following sentence: \"You have long lived an irreligious life, and have drawn together a number of men bound by an unlawful association, and professed yourself an open enemy to the gods and the religion of Rome; and the pious, most sacred and august Emperors&nbsp;... have endeavoured in vain to bring you back to conformity with their religious observances; whereas therefore you have been apprehended as principal and ringleader in these infamous crimes, you shall be made an example to those whom you have wickedly associated with you; the authority of law shall be ratified in your blood.\" He then read the sentence of the court from a written tablet: \"It is the sentence of this court that Thascius Cyprianus be executed with the sword.\" ''Cyprian'': \"Thanks be to God.\u201d</blockquote>\n\nTaken directly to the place of execution, Cyprian was decapitated. The words of the sentence show that in the eyes of the Roman state, Christianity was not a religion at all, and the church was a criminal organisation. When Valerian's son [[Gallienus]] became Emperor in 260, the legislation was revoked, and this brief period of persecution came to an end; this period of relative toleration between his accession to the next mass persecution is known as the [[Little Peace of the Church]].\n\nA warrant to arrest a Christian, dated 28 February 256, was found among the [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]] ([[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 3035|''P. Oxy'' 3035]]). The grounds for the arrest are not given in the document. Valerian's first act as emperor on 22 October 253 was to make his son Gallienus his Caesar and colleague. Early in his reign, affairs in Europe went from bad to worse, and the whole West fell into disorder. In the East, Antioch had fallen into the hands of a Sassanid vassal and Armenia was occupied by Shapur I (Sapor). Valerian and Gallienus split the problems of the empire between them, with the son taking the West, and the father heading East to face the Persian threat.\n\n=== Diocletian and Galerius ===\n[[File:\"Duomo di Milano\", cathedral in Milan, Italy. Statue of a martyr.jpg|300px|thumb| Statue of a martyr, [[Milan Cathedral]]]]\n{{Main|Diocletianic Persecution}}\nDiocletian's accession in 284 did not mark an immediate reversal of disregard to Christianity, but it did herald a gradual shift in official attitudes toward religious minorities. In the first fifteen years of his rule, Diocletian purged the army of Christians, condemned [[Manichaeism|Manicheans]] to death, and surrounded himself with public opponents of Christianity. Diocletian's preference for autocratic government, combined with his self-image as a restorer of past Roman glory, presaged the most pervasive persecution in Roman history. In the winter of 302, Galerius urged Diocletian to begin a general persecution of the Christians. Diocletian was wary, and asked the oracle of Apollo for guidance. The oracle's reply was read as an endorsement of Galerius's position, and a general persecution was called on 24 February 303.\n\nSupport for persecution within the Roman ruling class was not universal. Where Galerius and Diocletian were avid persecutors, [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]] was unenthusiastic. Later persecutory edicts, including the calls for all inhabitants to sacrifice to the Roman gods, were not applied in his domain. His son, [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]], on taking the imperial office in 306, restored Christians to full legal equality and returned property that had been confiscated during the persecution. In Italy in 306, the usurper [[Maxentius]] ousted Maximian's successor [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]], promising full religious toleration. Galerius ended the persecution in the East in 311, but it was resumed in [[Egypt]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and [[Asia Minor]] by his successor, [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]]. Constantine and Licinius, Severus's successor, signed the \"[[Edict of Milan]]\" in 313, which offered a more comprehensive acceptance of Christianity than Galerius's edict had provided. Licinius ousted Maximinus in 313, bringing an end to persecution in the East.\n\nThe persecution failed to check the rise of the church. By 324, Constantine was sole ruler of the empire, and Christianity had become his favored religion. Although the persecution resulted in death, torture, imprisonment, or dislocation for many Christians, the majority of the empire's Christians avoided punishment. The persecution did, however, cause many churches to split between those who had complied with imperial authority (the ''[[lapsi (Christianity)|lapsi]]'') and those who had held firm. Certain schisms, like those of the [[Donatist]]s in North Africa and the [[Melitians]] in Egypt, persisted long after the persecutions: only after 411 would the Donatists be reconciled to the church to which in 380 Emperor [[Theodosius I]] reserved the title of \"catholic\". The cult of the martyrs in the centuries that followed the end of the persecutions gave rise to accounts that exaggerated the barbarity of that era. These accounts were criticized during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and after, most notably by [[Edward Gibbon]]. Modern historians like [[G. E. M. de Ste. Croix]] have attempted to determine whether Christian sources exaggerated the scope of the persecution by Diocletian.\n\n== Martyrdom ==\n{{See also|Christian martyrs}}\n[[File:Herbert schmalz28.jpg|300px|thumb|\"Faithful Unto Death\" by [[Herbert Gustave Schmalz|Herbert Schmalz]]]]\nThe earliest Christian martyrs, tortured and killed by Roman officials enforcing worship of the gods, won so much fame among their co-religionists that others wished to imitate them to such an extent that a group presented themselves to the governor of Asia, declaring themselves to be Christians, and calling on him to do his duty and put them to death. He executed a few, but as the rest demanded it as well, he responded, exasperated, \"You wretches, if you want to die, you have cliffs to leap from and ropes to hang by.\" This attitude was sufficiently widespread for Church authorities to begin to distinguish sharply \"between solicited martyrdom and the more traditional kind that came as a result of persecution.\"<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=Bowersock+%22determined+to+enforce%22&btnG= G.W.

According to [[Ramsey MacMullen]], the provocation was just \"too blatant\". Drake cites this as evidence that Christians resorted to violence, including physical, at times.<ref>Constantine and the Bishops: The Politics of Intolerance\", H. A. Drake, Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-8018-7104-2}}, p. 403; \"Christianity & Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries\", Ramsay MacMullen, 1997, Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-07148-5}} p.15</ref>\nEstimates for total martyred dead for the Great Persecution depend on the report of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in the ''[[Martyrs of Palestine]]''.

Since, under Roman law, capital punishment could only be enforced by provincial governors, and because, most of the time, these governors would be in residence at the capital, most martyrdoms would take place within Eusebius' jurisdiction. When they did not, as when the provincial governor traveled to other cities to perform assizes, their activities would be publicized throughout the province. Thus, if Eusebius were an assiduous reporter of the persecutions in his province, he could easily have acquired a full tally of all martyred dead.<ref name=\"Ste Croix, 101\">Ste Croix, 101</ref>\n\nEdward Gibbon, after lamenting the vagueness of Eusebius' phrasing, made the first estimate of number martyred as follows: by counting the total number of persons listed in the ''Martyrs'', dividing it by the years covered by Eusebius' text, multiplying it by the fraction of the Roman world the province of Palestine represents, and multiplying that figure by the total period of the persecution.<ref>[[Edward Gibbon]], ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', ed. David Womersley (London: Allen Lane, 1994), 1.578.</ref> Subsequent estimates have followed the same basic methodology.<ref>T. D. Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1981), 154, 357 n. 55.</ref>\n\nEusebius' aims in the ''Martyrs of Palestine'' have been disputed. Geoffrey de Ste Croix, historian and author of a pair of seminal articles on the persecution of Christians in the Roman world, argued, after Gibbon, that Eusebius aimed at producing a full account of the martyrs in his province. Eusebius' aims, Ste Croix argued, were clear from the text of the ''Martyrs'': after describing Caesarea's martyrdoms for 310, the last to have taken place in the city, Eusebius writes, \"Such were the martyrdoms which took place at C\u00e6sarea during the entire period of the persecution\"; after describing the later mass executions at Phaeno, Eusebius writes, \"These martyrdoms were accomplished in Palestine during eight complete years; and this was a description of the persecution in our time.\"<ref>Eusebius, ''Martyrs of Palestine'' (S) 11.31, 13.11, tr. A. C. McGiffert, cited by Ste Croix, 101.</ref> Timothy Barnes, however, argues that Eusebius' intent was not as broad as the text cited by Ste Croix implies: \"Eusebius himself entitled the work 'About those who suffered martyrdom in Palestine' and his intention was to preserve the memories of the martyrs whom he knew, rather than to give a comprehensive account of how persecution affected the Roman province in which he lived.\"<ref Name=Barnes />{{rp|154}} The preface to the long recension of the ''Martyrs'' is cited:\n\n{{quote|It is meet, then, that the conflicts which were illustrious in various districts should be committed to writing by those who dwelt with the combatants in their districts.

Established in 1580, the Lipica [[stud farm]] is the world's oldest continuously operating stud farm. It is also closely associated with the [[Spanish Riding School]] of [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], where they demonstrate the ''[[Classical dressage#The School Jumps|haute \u00e9cole]]'' or \"high school\" movements of [[classical dressage]], including the highly controlled, stylized jumps and other movements known as the \"airs above the ground.\" The horses at the Spanish Riding School are trained using traditional methods that date back hundreds of years, based on the principles of classical dressage.\n\nThe Lipizzan breed dates back to the 16th century, when it was developed with the support of the [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg nobility]]. The breed takes its name from one of the earliest stud farms established, located near the village of [[Lipica, Se\u017eana|Lipica]] (spelled \"Lipizza\" in [[Italian language|Italian]]), in modern-day [[Slovenia]]. The breed has been endangered numerous times by warfare sweeping Europe, including during the [[War of the First Coalition]], [[World War I]], and [[World War II]]. The rescue of the Lipizzans during World War II by American troops was made famous by the [[Disney]] movie ''[[Miracle of the White Stallions]]''. The breed has also starred or played supporting roles in many movies, TV shows, books, and other media.\n\nToday, eight [[stallion]]s are recognized as the [[foundation bloodstock]] of the breed, all foaled the late 18th and early 19th centuries. All modern Lipizzans trace their bloodlines to these eight stallions, and all breeding stallions have included in their name the name of the foundation sire of their bloodline. Also classic [[mare]] lines are known, with up to 35 recognized by various [[breed registry|breed registries]]. The majority of horses are registered through the member organizations of the Lipizzan International Federation, which covers almost 11,000 horses in 19 countries and at 9 state studs in Europe. Most Lipizzans reside in Europe, with smaller numbers in the Americas, Africa, and Australia. Generally [[gray (horse)|gray]] in color, the Lipizzan is a muscular breed that matures slowly and is long-lived.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Lipizzaner DSC02443.jpg|thumb|left|Young Lipizzan stallion midway through the graying process]]\nMost Lipizzans measure between {{hands|14.2|and|15.2}}.<ref name=\"LIPORG\"/> However, horses bred to be closer to the original carriage-horse type are taller, approaching {{hands|16.1}}.<ref name=Ed111>Edwards, ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', p.111.</ref> Lipizzans have a long head, with a straight or slightly convex profile. The jaw is deep, the ears small, the eyes large and expressive, and the nostrils flared. They have a neck that is sturdy, yet arched and [[withers]] that are low, muscular, and broad. They are a [[Baroque horse]], with a wide, deep chest, broad [[Rump (animal)|croup]], and muscular shoulder. The tail is carried high and well set. The legs are well-muscled and strong, with broad joints and well-defined tendons. The feet tend to be small, but are tough.<ref name=Bong>Bongianni, ''Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses and Ponies'', Entry 37.</ref>\n\nLipizzan horses tend to mature slowly. However, they live and are active longer than many other breeds, with horses performing the difficult exercises of the Spanish Riding School well into their 20s and living into their 30s.<ref name=Ed111/>\n\n===Color===\n[[File:Mare & Foal 3 (7361664544).jpg|thumb|Mare and dark foal]]\nAside from the rare solid-colored horse (usually [[bay (color)|bay]] or [[black (horse)|black]]), most Lipizzans are [[Gray (horse)|gray]]. Like all gray horses, they have black skin, dark eyes, and as adult horses, a white hair coat. Gray horses, including Lipizzans, are born with a pigmented coat\u2014in Lipizzans, [[foal]]s are usually bay or black\u2014and become lighter each year as the graying process takes place, with the process being complete between 6 and 10 years of age.

Full training takes an average of six years for each horse, and schooling is considered complete when they have mastered the skills required to perform the \"School Quadrille\".<ref name=Stallions/> There are three progressively more difficult skill sets taught to the stallions, which are:\n* Forward riding, also called straight riding or the ''Remontenschule'', is the name given to the skills taught in the first year of training, where a young horse learns to be [[saddle]]d and [[bridle]]d, learns basic commands on a [[longeing|longe line]], and then is taught to be ridden, mostly in an arena in simple straight lines and turns, to teach correct responses to the [[riding aids|rider's legs and hands]] while mounted. The main goal during this time is to develop free forward movement in as natural a position as possible.<ref name=Stallions/>\n* Campaign school, ''Campagneschule'' or ''Campagne'', is where the horse learns [[collection (horse)|collection]] and balance through all [[horse gait|gaits]], turns, and maneuvers. The horse learns to shorten and lengthen his stride and perform [[lateral movement]]s to the side, and is introduced to the more complex [[double bridle]]. This is the longest training phase and may take several years.<ref name=Stallions/>\n* High-school dressage, the ''[[Classical dressage#The School Jumps|haute \u00e9cole]]'' or ''Hohe Schule'',  includes riding the horse with greater collection with increased use of the hindquarters, developing increased regularity, skill, and finesse in all natural gaits.  In this period, the horse learns the most advanced movements such as the [[half-pass]], [[counter-canter]], [[flying change]], [[pirouette (dressage)|pirouette]], ''[[passage (dressage)|passage]]'', and ''[[piaffe]]''.

A less difficult but related movement is the pesade, where the horse rises up to a 45\u00b0 angle.\n* The courbette is a movement where the horse balances on its hind legs and then essentially \"hops\", jumping with the front legs off the ground and hind legs together.\n* The capriole is a jump in place where the stallion leaps into the air, tucking his forelegs under himself, and kicks out with his hind legs at the top of the jump.\nOther movements include:\n* <!--Only training movements, not used in public performance-->The croupade and ballotade are predecessors to the capriole. In the croupade, the horse jumps with both front and hind legs remaining tucked under the body and he does not kick out. In the ballotade, the horse jumps and untucks his hind legs slightly, he does not kick out, but the soles of the hind feet are visible if viewed from the rear.\n* The mezair is a series of successive levades in which the horse lowers its forefeet to the ground before rising again on hindquarters, achieving forward motion. This movement is no longer used at the Spanish Riding School.<ref>Podhajsky, ''The Complete Training of Horse and Rider'', pp. 269\u2013274</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nLipizzans have starred or played supporting roles in many movies, TV shows, books, and other media.\n\nThe 1940 film ''[[Florian (film)|Florian]]'' stars two Lipizzan stallions.

Established in 1580, the Lipica [[stud farm]] is the world's oldest continuously operating stud farm. It is also closely associated with the [[Spanish Riding School]] of [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], where they demonstrate the ''[[Classical dressage#The School Jumps|haute \u00e9cole]]'' or \"high school\" movements of [[classical dressage]], including the highly controlled, stylized jumps and other movements known as the \"airs above the ground.\" The horses at the Spanish Riding School are trained using traditional methods that date back hundreds of years, based on the principles of classical dressage.\n\nThe Lipizzan breed dates back to the 16th century, when it was developed with the support of the [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg nobility]]. The breed takes its name from one of the earliest stud farms established, located near the village of [[Lipica, Se\u017eana|Lipica]] (spelled \"Lipizza\" in [[Italian language|Italian]]), in modern-day [[Slovenia]]. The breed has been endangered numerous times by warfare sweeping Europe, including during the [[War of the First Coalition]], [[World War I]], and [[World War II]]. The rescue of the Lipizzans during World War II by American troops was made famous by the [[Disney]] movie ''[[Miracle of the White Stallions]]''. The breed has also starred or played supporting roles in many movies, TV shows, books, and other media.\n\nToday, eight [[stallion]]s are recognized as the [[foundation bloodstock]] of the breed, all foaled the late 18th and early 19th centuries. All modern Lipizzans trace their bloodlines to these eight stallions, and all breeding stallions have included in their name the name of the foundation sire of their bloodline. Also classic [[mare]] lines are known, with up to 35 recognized by various [[breed registry|breed registries]]. The majority of horses are registered through the member organizations of the Lipizzan International Federation, which covers almost 11,000 horses in 19 countries and at 9 state studs in Europe. Most Lipizzans reside in Europe, with smaller numbers in the Americas, Africa, and Australia. Generally [[gray (horse)|gray]] in color, the Lipizzan is a muscular breed that matures slowly and is long-lived.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Lipizzaner DSC02443.jpg|thumb|left|Young Lipizzan stallion midway through the graying process]]\nMost Lipizzans measure between {{hands|14.2|and|15.2}}.<ref name=\"LIPORG\"/> However, horses bred to be closer to the original carriage-horse type are taller, approaching {{hands|16.1}}.<ref name=Ed111>Edwards, ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', p.111.</ref> Lipizzans have a long head, with a straight or slightly convex profile.

They are a [[Baroque horse]], with a wide, deep chest, broad [[Rump (animal)|croup]], and muscular shoulder. The tail is carried high and well set. The legs are well-muscled and strong, with broad joints and well-defined tendons. The feet tend to be small, but are tough.<ref name=Bong>Bongianni, ''Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses and Ponies'', Entry 37.</ref>\n\nLipizzan horses tend to mature slowly. However, they live and are active longer than many other breeds, with horses performing the difficult exercises of the Spanish Riding School well into their 20s and living into their 30s.<ref name=Ed111/>\n\n===Color===\n[[File:Mare & Foal 3 (7361664544).jpg|thumb|Mare and dark foal]]\nAside from the rare solid-colored horse (usually [[bay (color)|bay]] or [[black (horse)|black]]), most Lipizzans are [[Gray (horse)|gray]].

The first was in March 1797 during the [[War of the First Coalition]], when the horses were evacuated from Lipica. During the journey, 16 mares gave birth to foals.

The methods for training the Lipizzan stallions at the Spanish Riding School were passed down via an [[oral tradition]] until Field Marshal Franz Holbein and Johann Meixner, Senior Rider at the School, published the initial guidelines for the training of horse and rider at the school in 1898.

Full training takes an average of six years for each horse, and schooling is considered complete when they have mastered the skills required to perform the \"School Quadrille\".<ref name=Stallions/> There are three progressively more difficult skill sets taught to the stallions, which are:\n* Forward riding, also called straight riding or the ''Remontenschule'', is the name given to the skills taught in the first year of training, where a young horse learns to be [[saddle]]d and [[bridle]]d, learns basic commands on a [[longeing|longe line]], and then is taught to be ridden, mostly in an arena in simple straight lines and turns, to teach correct responses to the [[riding aids|rider's legs and hands]] while mounted. The main goal during this time is to develop free forward movement in as natural a position as possible.<ref name=Stallions/>\n* Campaign school, ''Campagneschule'' or ''Campagne'', is where the horse learns [[collection (horse)|collection]] and balance through all [[horse gait|gaits]], turns, and maneuvers. The horse learns to shorten and lengthen his stride and perform [[lateral movement]]s to the side, and is introduced to the more complex [[double bridle]]. This is the longest training phase and may take several years.<ref name=Stallions/>\n* High-school dressage, the ''[[Classical dressage#The School Jumps|haute \u00e9cole]]'' or ''Hohe Schule'',  includes riding the horse with greater collection with increased use of the hindquarters, developing increased regularity, skill, and finesse in all natural gaits.  In this period, the horse learns the most advanced movements such as the [[half-pass]], [[counter-canter]], [[flying change]], [[pirouette (dressage)|pirouette]], ''[[passage (dressage)|passage]]'', and ''[[piaffe]]''.

A less difficult but related movement is the pesade, where the horse rises up to a 45\u00b0 angle.\n* The courbette is a movement where the horse balances on its hind legs and then essentially \"hops\", jumping with the front legs off the ground and hind legs together.\n* The capriole is a jump in place where the stallion leaps into the air, tucking his forelegs under himself, and kicks out with his hind legs at the top of the jump.\nOther movements include:\n* <!--Only training movements, not used in public performance-->The croupade and ballotade are predecessors to the capriole. In the croupade, the horse jumps with both front and hind legs remaining tucked under the body and he does not kick out. In the ballotade, the horse jumps and untucks his hind legs slightly, he does not kick out, but the soles of the hind feet are visible if viewed from the rear.\n* The mezair is a series of successive levades in which the horse lowers its forefeet to the ground before rising again on hindquarters, achieving forward motion. This movement is no longer used at the Spanish Riding School.<ref>Podhajsky, ''The Complete Training of Horse and Rider'', pp. 269\u2013274</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nLipizzans have starred or played supporting roles in many movies, TV shows, books, and other media.\n\nThe 1940 film ''[[Florian (film)|Florian]]'' stars two Lipizzan stallions.

Vessels were not built for the purpose of serving in this role, rather, vessels were appointed. This normally came at the end of a vessels combat career. As such, the vessels condition was such that it was best to remain in port, at anchor. Modifications to ships serving in this role often included the removal of weapons, and the erecting of housing structures on the main deck. Upon release from receiving duties most ships were either decommissioned or transferred to a state's [[Naval Militia]].\n\nRecords for the receiving ship were particularly modest and as such very little history is recorded of these once proud ships upon impressment into receiving duties. The actual medical duties of these ships usually was defined by the space available, and based on the need, availability of local Naval Hospitals, and the availability of a medical staff. Each receiving ship played a different role as a hospital ship if any. Refits were done locally and at discretion, if at all. In addition to the receiving ships, store ships and guard ships often took on hospital ship, hospital tender, health ship, or quarantine duties as the need or opportunity arose.\n\n* {{USS|Ohio|1820}}\n* {{USS|Pennsylvania|1837}}\n* {{USS|Jamestown|1844}}\n* {{USS|Vermont|1848}}\n* {{USS|Princeton|1851}}\n* {{USS|A.

These boats came in all shapes and sizes, and were picked for a variety of reasons, such as availability and need.\n\n* USS ''Adrian'' (ex-''Westport'')\n* USS ''Seagate''\n* USS ''Southport''\n* Ambulance Boat No. One\n* Ambulance Boat No. Two\n* [[Landing Craft Utility]] (Type 1610, 1627, 1646)\n* [[Landing Craft Mechanized]] (Type 6 and 8)\n\n==Landing Ship Tank (Casualty Evacuation)==\nA number of Commanders modified, outfitted, or simply designated [[Tank Landing Ship]]s to serve in a dual role as an interim hospital designated [[LSTH]].\n\n==Rescue Ships==\n{{main|PCE-842-class patrol craft}}\nThe [[PCE-842-class patrol craft]] class is an armed rescue ship built on the hull of the PCE (Patrol Craft Escort) by the [[Pullman Company|Pullman Standard Car Manufacturing Co.]] in Chicago, Illinois. Of the 54 PCERs ordered, 13 were laid down, 12 were commissioned, and 5 saw service as rescue ships (PCER - Patrol Craft Escort Rescue). The ships served three missions: damage control / firefighting; casualty treatment / evacuation; and patrol / guardship. Each ship's hospital was composed of 65 beds, a surgical suite, and X-Ray facilities. The medical department consisted of a staff of 11 doctors and hospital corpsmen. Ships designated PCER were numbers 847 to 859.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/02848.htm|title=PCER-848|publisher=navsource|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref> However, ''PCER-847'' was redesignated before commissioning as a PCE. PCERs 848, 849 and 850 underwent conversion in Brisbane, Australia. The refits converted their expansive hospital space into a communications center and the ships new mission was to serve as a signal ship for the US Army landings in the Philippines and Japan. PCERs 856, 857, and 859 missed WWII and saw virtually no service as they were intended. The remaining ships of interest, PCERs 851-855 have had a short but remarkable war record\n\n;Some notable ships of this class were;\n* {{USS|Fairview|PCER-850}}\n* [[BRP Miguel Malvar (PS-19)|USS ''Brattleboro'' (PCER 852)]]\n* {{USS|Amherst|PCER-853}}\n\n==Rescue Transport Ships==\nAll five of these ships were ordered and cancelled before construction began 12 March 1943. This class was the replacement of the theoretical class referred to as APH (Auxiliary Personnel Transport Hospital).

They also saved many lives.\n\nIn this list, the particular roles of some hospital ships are identified, e.g. as [[ambulance]] vessels, rescue ships, and evacuation ships.

Vessels were not built for the purpose of serving in this role, rather, vessels were appointed. This normally came at the end of a vessels combat career. As such, the vessels condition was such that it was best to remain in port, at anchor. Modifications to ships serving in this role often included the removal of weapons, and the erecting of a housing structures on the main deck. Upon release from receiving duties most ships were either decommissioned or transferred to a states [[Naval Militia]].\n\nRecords for the receiving ship were particularly modest and as such very little history is recorded of these once proud ships upon impressment into receiving duties. The actual medical duties of these ships usually was defined by the space available, and based on the need, availability of local Naval Hospitals, and the availability of a medical staff. Each receiving ship played a different role as a hospital ship if any. Refits were done locally and at discretion, if at all. In addition to the receiving ships, store ships and guard ships often took on hospital ship, hospital tender, health ship, or quarantine duties as the need or opportunity arose.\n\n* {{USS|Ohio|1820}}\n* {{USS|Pennsylvania|1837}}\n* {{USS|Jamestown|1844}}\n* {{USS|Vermont|1848}}\n* {{USS|Princeton|1851}}\n* {{USS|A.

These boats came in all shapes and sizes, and were picked for a variety of reasons, such as availability and need.\n\n* USS ''Adrian'' (ex-''Westport'')\n* USS ''Seagate''\n* USS ''Southport''\n* Ambulance Boat No. One\n* Ambulance Boat No. Two\n* [[Landing Craft Utility]] (Type 1610, 1627, 1646)\n* [[Landing Craft Mechanized]] (Type 6 and 8)\n\n==Landing Ship Tank (Casualty Evacuation)==\nA number of Commanders modified, outfitted, or simply designated [[Tank Landing Ship]]s to serve in a dual role as an interim hospital designated [[LSTH]].\n\n==Rescue Ships==\n{{main|PCE-842-class patrol craft}}\nThe [[PCE-842-class patrol craft]] class is an armed rescue ship built on the hull of the PCE (Patrol Craft Escort) by the [[Pullman Company|Pullman Standard Car Manufacturing Co.]] in Chicago, Illinois. Of the 54 PCERs ordered, 13 were laid down, 12 were commissioned, and 5 saw service as rescue ships (PCER - Patrol Craft Escort Rescue). The ships served three missions: damage control / firefighting; casualty treatment / evacuation; and patrol / guardship. Each ship's hospital was composed of 65 beds, a surgical suite, and X-Ray facilities. The medical department consisted of a staff of 11 doctors and hospital corpsmen. Ships designated PCER were numbers 847 to 859.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/02848.htm|title=PCER-848|publisher=navsource|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref> However, ''PCER-847'' was redesignated before commissioning as a PCE. PCERs 848, 849 and 850 underwent conversion in Brisbane, Australia. The refits converted their expansive hospital space into a communications center and the ships new mission was to serve as a signal ship for the US Army landings in the Philippines and Japan. PCERs 856, 857, and 859 missed WWII and saw virtually no service as they were intended. The remaining ships of interest, PCERs 851-855 have had a short but remarkable war record\n\n;Some notable ships of this class were;\n* {{USS|Fairview|PCER-850}}\n* [[BRP Miguel Malvar (PS-19)|USS ''Brattleboro'' (PCER 852)]]\n* {{USS|Amherst|PCER-853}}\n\n==Rescue Transport Ships==\nAll five of these ships were ordered and cancelled before construction began 12 March 1943. This class was the replacement of the theoretical class referred to as APH (Auxiliary Personnel Transport Hospital).
