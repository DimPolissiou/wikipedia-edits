The university's first custom-built building was the Old College, now [[Edinburgh Law School]], situated on South Bridge. Its first forte in teaching was [[anatomy]] and the developing science of [[surgery]], from which it expanded into many other subjects. From the basement of a nearby house ran the anatomy tunnel corridor. It went under what was then North College Street (now Chambers Street), and under the university buildings until it reached the university's anatomy lecture theatre, delivering bodies for dissection. It was from this tunnel the body of [[Burke and Hare murders|William Burke]] was taken after he had been hanged.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, Old College was becoming overcrowded and Sir [[Robert Rowand Anderson]] was commissioned to design new Medical School premises in 1875. Initially the design incorporated a Graduation Hall, but this was seen as too ambitious. A separate building was constructed for the purpose, the [[McEwan Hall]], also designed by Anderson, after funds were donated by the brewer and politician Sir [[William McEwan]] in 1894. It was presented to the University in 1897.\n[[File:Edinburgh New College (8594473141).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|The university's [[New College, Edinburgh|New College]] building]]\n[[New College, University of Edinburgh|New College]] was originally opened in 1846 as a [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church of Scotland]] college, later of the [[United Free Church of Scotland]].

Prior to the 1929 reunion of the Church of Scotland, candidates for the ministry in the United Free Church studied at New College, whilst candidates for the old Church of Scotland studied in the Divinity Faculty of the University of Edinburgh.

While technically not a [[collegiate university]], it now comprises the Colleges of Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS), Science & Engineering (SCE) and Medicine & Vet Medicine (MVM). Within these colleges are \"schools\" \u2013 roughly equivalent to the departments they succeeded; individual schools have a good degree of autonomy regarding their finances and internal organisation.

The university's first custom-built building was the Old College, now [[Edinburgh Law School]], situated on South Bridge. Its first forte in teaching was [[anatomy]] and the developing science of [[surgery]], from which it expanded into many other subjects. From the basement of a nearby house ran the anatomy tunnel corridor. It went under what was then North College Street (now Chambers Street), and under the university buildings until it reached the university's anatomy lecture theatre, delivering bodies for dissection. It was from this tunnel the body of [[Burke and Hare murders|William Burke]] was taken after he had been hanged.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, Old College was becoming overcrowded and Sir [[Robert Rowand Anderson]] was commissioned to design new Medical School premises in 1875. Initially the design incorporated a Graduation Hall, but this was seen as too ambitious. A separate building was constructed for the purpose, the [[McEwan Hall]], also designed by Anderson, after funds were donated by the brewer and politician Sir [[William McEwan]] in 1894. It was presented to the University in 1897.\n[[File:Edinburgh New College (8594473141).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|The university's [[New College, Edinburgh|New College]] building]]\n[[New College, University of Edinburgh|New College]] was originally opened in 1846 as a [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church of Scotland]] college, later of the [[United Free Church of Scotland]].

It is the oldest region, occupied primarily by the College of Humanities and Social Science, and the Schools of Computing & Informatics and the School of Law, as well as the main university library. The [[Appleton Tower]] is also used for teaching first year undergraduates in science and engineering. Meanwhile, Teviot Place continues to house pre-clinical medical courses and biomedical sciences despite relocation of the Medical School to Little France. Nearby are the main [[Edinburgh University Students' Association|EUSA]] buildings of [[Potterrow]], [[Teviot Row House|Teviot]] and [[Pleasance]]. Former residents of George Square include Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. Some of these buildings are used to host events during the [[Edinburgh International Festival]] every summer. The main library ([[Edinburgh University Library]]) is also located at George Square.\n\n[[New College, Edinburgh|New College]], overlooks Princes Street and only a short walk from Waverley Rail Station and other Edinburgh landmarks.

Most of the Science and Engineering College's research and teaching activities take place at the King's Buildings, which occupy a 35 hectare site. It includes [[C. H. Waddington]] Building (the Centre for Systems Biology at Edinburgh), James Clerk Maxwell Building (the administrative and teaching centre of the School of Physics and Astronomy and the School of Mathematics), [[Royal Observatory, Edinburgh|The Royal Observatory]], William Rankine Building (School of Engineering's Institute for Infrastructure and Environment) and other schools' buildings. There were three libraries at KB: Darwin Library, James Clerk Maxwell Library and Robertson Engineering and Science Library. A new library called The Noreen and Kenneth Murray Library opened for the 2012/13 session as a replacement for the previous three libraries. It also houses National e-Science Centre (NeSC), Scottish Microelectronics Centre (SMC), Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC), and the Scottish Institute for Enterprise.\n\n=== BioQuarter ===\nBioQuarter, south of Edinburgh is home to the majority medical facilities of the university, alongside the city's hospital - the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. At [[Little France]], the Chancellor's Building, was opened on 12 August 2002 by [[The Duke of Edinburgh]] and houses the \u00a340 million [[University of Edinburgh Medical School|Medical School]] at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. It was a joint project between private finance, the local authorities and the University to create a large modern hospital, veterinary clinic and research institute. It has two large lecture theatres and a medical library. It is connected to the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]] by a series of corridors. Queen's Medical Research Institute was opened in 2005, and provides facilities for research into the understanding of common diseases.\n\n=== Easter Bush ===\n\nThe Easter Bush campus houses the [[Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies]], [[The Roslin Institute]], Jeanne Marchig International Centre for Animal Welfare Education and The Veterinary Oncology and Imaging Centre.\n\nThe Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, founded in 1823 by William Dick, is a world leader in veterinary education, research and practice.

While technically not a [[collegiate university]], it now comprises the Colleges of Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS), Science & Engineering (SCE) and Medicine & Vet Medicine (MVM). Within these colleges are \"schools\" \u2013 roughly equivalent to the departments they succeeded; individual schools have a good degree of autonomy regarding their finances and internal organisation.

The operation commenced after large numbers of [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgian]], [[British Army|British]], and [[French Army|French]] troops were cut off and surrounded by [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German troops]] during the six-week [[Battle of France]]. In a speech to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] called this \"a colossal military disaster\", saying \"the whole root and core and brain of the British Army\" had been stranded at Dunkirk and seemed about to perish or be captured.{{sfn|Churchill|2003|p=212}} In his \"[[we shall fight on the beaches]]\" speech on 4 June, he hailed their rescue as a \"miracle of deliverance\".{{sfn|Safire|2004|p=146}}\n\nAfter [[Nazi Germany]] [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] in September 1939, France and the [[British Empire]] declared war on Germany and imposed an [[Blockade of Germany (1939-45)|economic blockade]]. The [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) was sent to help defend France. After the [[Phoney War]] of October 1939 to April 1940, Germany [[Battle of Belgium|invaded Belgium]], the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], and [[Battle of France|France]] on 10 May 1940. Three [[panzer corps]] attacked through the [[Ardennes]] and drove northwest to the [[English Channel]]. By 21 May, German forces had trapped the BEF, the remains of the Belgian forces, and three French [[field army|field armies]] along the northern coast of France. BEF commander [[General (British Army)|General]] [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Viscount Gort]] immediately saw evacuation across the Channel as the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest good port.\n\nLate on 23 May, a halt order was issued by ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], commander of [[Army Group A]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] approved this order the next day, and had the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] send confirmation to the front. Destroying the trapped BEF, French, and Belgian armies was left to the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' until the order was rescinded on 26 May. This gave Allied forces time to construct defensive works and pull back large numbers of troops to fight the [[Battle of Dunkirk]]. From 28 to 31 May, in the [[Siege of Lille (1940)|Siege of Lille]], the remaining 40,000 men of the once-formidable French First Army fought a delaying action against seven German [[Division (military)|divisions]], including three [[Panzer division|armoured divisions]].\n\nOn the first day only 7,669 Allied soldiers were evacuated, but by the end of the eighth day, 338,226 had been rescued by a hastily assembled fleet of over 800 vessels. Many troops were able to embark from the harbour's protective [[mole (architecture)|mole]] onto 39 British [[Royal Navy]] [[destroyer]]s, 4 [[Royal Canadian Navy]] destroyers,{{sfn|McIntyre|2017}} at least 3 [[French Navy]] destroyers, and a variety of civilian merchant ships. Others had to wade out from the beaches, waiting for hours in shoulder-deep water. Some were ferried to the larger ships by what became known as the [[Little Ships of Dunkirk]], a [[flotilla]] of hundreds of [[merchant marine]] boats, [[fishing boat]]s, [[pleasure craft]], [[yacht]]s, and [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]] called into service from Britain. The BEF lost 68,000 soldiers during the French campaign and had to abandon nearly all of its tanks, vehicles, and equipment. In his 4 June speech, Churchill also reminded the country that \"we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}}\n\n==Background==\n{{Further|Battle of France}}\nIn September 1939, after [[Nazi Germany]] [[invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], the United Kingdom sent the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) to aid in the defence of France, landing at [[Cherbourg]], [[Nantes]], and [[Saint-Nazaire]]. By May 1940 the force consisted of ten [[Division (military)|divisions]] in three [[corps]] under the command of General [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort]].{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=9}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=7}} Working with the BEF were the [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgian Army]] and the French [[First Army (France)|First]], [[Seventh Army (France)|Seventh]], and [[Ninth Army (France)|Ninth]] Armies.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=305}}\n\nDuring the 1930s, the French had constructed the [[Maginot Line]], a series of fortifications along their border with Germany. This line had been designed to deter a German invasion across the Franco-German border and funnel an attack into Belgium, which could then be met by the best divisions of the [[French Army]]. Thus, any future war would take place outside of French territory, [[Zone rouge|avoiding a repeat]] of the [[First World War]].{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=33}}{{sfn|Roth|2010|p=6}} The area immediately to the north of the Maginot Line was covered by the heavily wooded [[Ardennes]] region,{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2007|p=23}} which French General [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] declared to be \"impenetrable\" as long as \"special provisions\" were taken. He believed that any enemy force emerging from the forest would be vulnerable to a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] and destroyed. The French commander-in-chief, [[Maurice Gamelin]], also believed the area to be of a limited threat, noting that it \"never favoured large operations\".{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=32}} With this in mind, the area was left lightly defended.{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=33}}\n\nThe initial plan for the German [[battle of France|invasion of France]] called for an encirclement attack through the Netherlands and Belgium, avoiding the Maginot Line.{{sfn|Melvin|2010|p=140}} [[Erich von Manstein]], then Chief of Staff of the German [[Army Group A]], prepared the outline of a different plan and submitted it to the [[OKH]] (German High Command) via his superior, ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]].{{sfn|Lemay|2010|pp=98\u2013102}}{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|pp=11\u201314}} Manstein's plan suggested that panzer divisions should attack through the Ardennes, then establish [[bridgehead]]s on the [[Meuse River]] and rapidly drive to the English Channel. The Germans would thus cut off the [[Allies of World War II|Allied armies]] in Belgium. This part of the plan later became known as the ''Sichelschnitt'' (\"sickle cut\").{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|pp=11\u201314}}{{sfn|Melvin|2010|p=145}} [[Adolf Hitler]] approved a modified version of Manstein's ideas, today known as the [[Manstein Plan]], after meeting with him on 17 February.{{sfn|Melvin|2010|p=132}}\n\n[[File:16May-21May Battle of Belgium.PNG|thumb|Situation on 21 May 1940; German forces occupy the area shaded in pink]]\n\nOn 10 May, Germany [[Battle of Belgium|invaded Belgium]] and [[Battle of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=713}} [[Army Group B]], under ''Generaloberst'' [[Fedor von Bock]], attacked into Belgium, while the three panzer corps of Army Group A under Rundstedt swung around to the south and drove for the Channel.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=37}} The BEF advanced from the Belgian border to positions along the [[River Dyle]] within Belgium, where they fought elements of Army Group B starting on 10 May.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=26}}{{sfn|Churchill|1949|loc=Map, p. 33}} They were ordered to begin a fighting withdrawal to the [[Scheldt River]] on 14 May when the Belgian and French positions on their flanks failed to hold.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=74\u201375}} During a visit to Paris on 17 May, Prime Minister Winston Churchill was astonished to learn from Gamelin that the French had committed all their troops to the ongoing engagements and had no strategic reserves.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=47}} On 19 May, Gort met with French General [[Gaston Billotte]], commander of the French First Army and overall coordinator of the Allied forces. Billotte revealed that the French had no troops between the Germans and the sea. Gort immediately saw that evacuation across the Channel was the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest location with good port facilities.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|pp=64\u201365}} Surrounded by marshes, Dunkirk boasted old fortifications and the longest sand beach in Europe, where large groups could assemble.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=123}} On 20 May, on Churchill's suggestion, the Admiralty began arranging for all available small vessels to be made ready to proceed to France.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=58\u201359}} After continued engagements and a failed Allied attempt on 21 May at [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Arras]] to cut through the German spearhead,{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=98}} the BEF was trapped, along with the remains of the Belgian forces and the three French armies, in an area along the coast of northern France and Belgium.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=728}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|loc=Map, p. 61}}\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:Gort and Blount at Arras WWII IWM O 177.jpg|thumb|[[Lord Gort]] (gesturing, at centre) was commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]]. ]]\nWithout informing the French, the British began planning on 20 May for Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of the BEF.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=123}}{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=58\u201359}} This planning was headed by [[Vice Admiral]] [[Bertram Ramsay]] at the naval headquarters below [[Dover Castle]], from which he briefed Churchill as it was under way.{{sfn|Lord|1983|pp=43\u201344}} Ships began gathering at Dover for the evacuation.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=100}} On 20 May, the BEF sent Brigadier Gerald Whitfield to Dunkirk to start evacuating unnecessary personnel. Overwhelmed by what he later described as \"a somewhat alarming movement towards Dunkirk by both officers and men\", due to a shortage of food and water, he had to send many along without thoroughly checking their credentials. Even officers ordered to stay behind to aid the evacuation disappeared onto the boats.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=124}}\n\nOn 22 May, Churchill ordered the BEF to attack southward in coordination with the French First Army under General [[Georges Maurice Jean Blanchard|Georges Blanchard]] to reconnect with the remainder of the French forces.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=65}} This proposed action was dubbed the Weygand Plan after General [[Maxime Weygand]], appointed Supreme Commander after Gamelin's dismissal on 18 May.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=57}} On 25 May, Gort had to abandon any hope of achieving this objective and withdrew on his own initiative, along with Blanchard's forces, behind the Lys Canal, part of a canal system that reached the sea at [[Gravelines]].{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=84}} Sluice gates had already been opened all along the canal to flood the system and create a barrier (the Canal Line) against the German advance.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=78\u201379}}\n\n===Battle of Dunkirk===\n{{Main|Battle of Dunkirk}}\n[[File:Dunkirksoldier1.JPG|left|thumb|Soldiers were [[strafe]]d and bombed by German aircraft while awaiting transport.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|loc=Footnote, p. 736}}]]\nBy 24 May, the Germans had captured the port of [[Boulogne]] and surrounded [[Calais]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=728}} The engineers of the 2nd Panzer Division under ''[[Generalmajor]]'' [[Rudolf Veiel]] built five bridges over the Canal Line and only one British battalion barred the way to Dunkirk.{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=152}} On 23 May, at the suggestion of [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fourth Army]] commander ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]], Rundstedt had ordered the panzer units to halt, concerned about the vulnerability of his flanks and the question of supply to his forward troops.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1988|p=167}}{{sfn|Army Group A War Diary}}{{sfn|OKW Jodl Diary}}{{sfn|Lord|1983|pp=28\u201335}} He was also concerned that the marshy ground around Dunkirk would prove unsuitable for tanks and he wished to conserve them for later operations (in some units, tank losses were 30\u201350 per cent).{{sfn|Cooper|1978| pp=230\u201331}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=120}} Hitler was also apprehensive, and on a visit to Army Group A headquarters on 24 May, he endorsed the order.{{sfn|Cooper|1978| pp=230\u201331}}{{sfn|Lord|1983|pp=28\u201335}}\n\nAir Marshal [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] urged Hitler to let the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (aided by Army Group B{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=150}}) finish off the British, to the consternation of General [[Franz Halder]], who noted in his diary that the ''Luftwaffe'' was dependent upon the weather and aircrews were worn out after two weeks of battle.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1988|pp=167\u201368}} Rundstedt issued another order, which was sent uncoded. It was picked up by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Y service]] intelligence network at 12:42: \"By order of the Fuhrer&nbsp;... attack north-west of Arras is to be limited to the general line Lens\u2013Bethune\u2013Aire\u2013St Omer\u2013Gravelines. The Canal will not be crossed.\"{{sfn|Costello|1991|p=175}}{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|p=31}} Later that day, Hitler issued Directive 13, which called for the ''Luftwaffe'' to defeat the trapped Allied forces and stop their escape.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|p=232}} At 15:30 on 26 May, Hitler ordered the panzer groups to continue their advance, but most units took another 16 hours to attack.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|p=235}} The delay gave the Allies time to prepare defences vital for the evacuation and prevented the Germans from stopping the Allied retreat from Lille.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1988|p=168}}\n\nThe halt order has been the subject of much discussion by historians.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=76}}{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=149}} Guderian considered the failure to order a timely assault on Dunkirk to be one of the major German mistakes on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].{{sfn|Guderian|2001|loc=Footnote, p. 117}} Rundstedt called it \"one of the great turning points of the war\",{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=731}} and Manstein described it as \"one of Hitler's most critical mistakes\".{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=153}} [[B. H. Liddell Hart]] interviewed many of the generals after the war and put together a picture of Hitler's strategic thinking on the matter. Hitler believed that once Britain's troops left continental Europe, they would never return.{{sfn|Hart|1948}}{{page needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Evacuation==\n===26\u201327 May===\nThe retreat was undertaken amid chaotic conditions, with abandoned vehicles blocking the roads and a flood of refugees heading in the opposite direction.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=145}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|pp=59, 75}} Due to wartime censorship and the desire to keep up British morale, the full extent of the unfolding disaster at Dunkirk was not initially publicised. A special service attended by [[King George VI]] was held in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 26 May, which was declared a national day of prayer.{{sfn|Miller|1997|p=83}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=122}} The [[Cosmo Gordon Lang|Archbishop of Canterbury]] led prayers \"for our soldiers in dire peril in France\". Similar prayers were offered in synagogues and churches throughout the UK that day, confirming to the public their suspicion of the desperate plight of the troops.{{sfn|Gelb|1990|p=82}} Just before 19:00 on 26 May, Churchill ordered Dynamo to begin, by which time 28,000 men had already departed.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=123}} Initial plans called for the recovery of 45,000 men from the BEF within two days, at which time German troops were expected to block further evacuation. Only 25,000 men escaped during this period, including 7,669 on the first day.{{sfn|Liddell Hart|1999|p=78}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}\n\n[[File:Wounded British soldiers evacuated from Dunkirk make their way up the gangplank from a destroyer at Dover, 31 May 1940. H1623.jpg|thumb|Troops evacuated from Dunkirk arrive at Dover, 31 May 1940]]\nOn 27 May, the first full day of the evacuation, one [[cruiser]], eight [[destroyer]]s, and 26 other craft were active.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=106}} Admiralty officers combed nearby boatyards for small craft that could ferry personnel from the beaches out to larger craft in the harbour, as well as larger vessels that could load from the docks. An emergency call was put out for additional help, and by 31 May nearly four hundred small craft were voluntarily and enthusiastically taking part in the effort.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=100\u201301}}\n\nThe same day, the ''Luftwaffe'' heavily bombed Dunkirk, both the town and the dock installations. As the water supply was knocked out, the resulting fires could not be extinguished.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=149}} An estimated thousand civilians were killed, one-third of the remaining population of the town.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=150}} The ''Luftwaffe'' was met by 16 squadrons of the [[Royal Air Force]], who claimed 38 kills on 27 May while losing 14 aircraft.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=149}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=228}} Many more RAF fighters sustained damage and were subsequently written off. On the German side, ''[[Kampfgeschwader 2]]'' (KG 2) and [[KG 3]] suffered the heaviest casualties. German losses amounted to 23 [[Dornier Do 17]]s. [[KG 1]] and [[KG 4]] bombed the beach and harbour and [[KG 54]] sank the 8,000-ton steamer ''Aden''. [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' dive bombers sank the troopship ''Cote d' Azur''. The ''Luftwaffe'' engaged with 300 bombers which were protected by 550 fighter sorties and attacked Dunkirk in twelve raids. They dropped 15,000 [[high explosive]] and 30,000 [[Incendiary device|incendiary bombs]], destroying the oil tanks and wrecking the harbour.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|pp=116\u2013117}} [[No. 11 Group RAF]] flew 22 patrols with 287 aircraft this day, in formations of up to 20 aircraft.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=117}}\n\nAltogether, over 3,500 sorties were flown in support of Operation Dynamo.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=228}} The RAF continued to inflict a heavy toll on the German bombers throughout the week. Soldiers being bombed and [[strafe]]d while awaiting transport were for the most part unaware of the efforts of the RAF to protect them, as most of the dogfights took place far from the beaches. As a result, many British soldiers bitterly accused the airmen of doing nothing to help.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|loc=Footnote, p. 736}}\n\nOn 25 and 26 May, the ''Luftwaffe'' focused their attention on Allied pockets holding out at Calais, [[Lille]], and [[Amiens]], and did not attack Dunkirk.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=150}} Calais, held by the BEF, surrendered on 26 May.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=119}} Remnants of the French First Army, [[Siege of Lille (1940)|surrounded at Lille]], fought off seven German divisions (several of them armoured) until 31 May, when the remaining 35,000 soldiers were forced to surrender after running out of food and ammunition.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=97}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=144}} The Germans accorded the [[honours of war]] to the defenders of Lille in recognition of their bravery.{{sfn|Fermer|2013|p=208}}\n\n===28 May \u2013 4 June===\n[[File:21May-4June1940-Fall Gelb.jpg|thumb|Situation on 4 June 1940; the remaining French rearguard held a sliver of land around Dunkirk]]\nThe Belgian Army surrendered on 28 May,{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=729}} leaving a large gap to the east of Dunkirk. Several British divisions were rushed in to cover that side.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=96}} The ''Luftwaffe'' flew fewer sorties over Dunkirk on 28 May, switching their attention to the Belgian ports, [[Ostend]] and [[Nieuport]]. The weather over Dunkirk was not conducive to dive or low-level bombing. The RAF flew 11 patrols and 321 sorties, claiming 23 destroyed for the loss of 13 aircraft.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=117}} On 28 May, 17,804 soldiers arrived at British ports.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}\n\nOn 29 May, 47,310 British troops were rescued{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}} as the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s Ju 87s exacted a heavy toll on shipping. The British destroyer [[HMS Grenade (H86)|HMS ''Grenade'']] was sunk and the [[French destroyer Mistral|French destroyer ''Mistral'']] was crippled while her sister ships, each laden with 500 men, were damaged by near misses. British destroyers [[HMS Jaguar (F34)|''Jaguar'']] and [[HMS Verity (D63)|''Verity'']] were badly damaged but escaped the harbour. Two trawlers disintegrated in the attack. Later, the passenger steamer {{SS|Fenella|1936|6}} sank with 600 men aboard at the pier but the men were able to get off. The paddle steamer {{HMS|Crested Eagle}} suffered a direct hit, caught fire, and sank with severe casualties. The raiders also destroyed the two rail-owned ships, the {{SS|Lorina|1918|6}} and the {{SS|Normannia|1911|6}}.{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=138}} Of the five major German attacks, just two were contested by RAF fighters; the British lost 16 fighters in nine patrols. German losses amounted to 11 Ju 87s destroyed or damaged.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=118}}\n\nOn 30 May, Churchill received word that all British divisions were now behind the defensive lines, along with more than half of the French First Army.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=97}} By this time, the perimeter ran along a series of canals about {{convert|7|mi}} from the coast, in marshy country not suitable for tanks.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=226}} With the docks in the harbour rendered unusable by German air attacks, senior naval officer Captain (later Admiral) [[William Tennant (Royal Navy officer)|William Tennant]] initially ordered men to be evacuated from the beaches. When this proved too slow, he re-routed the evacuees to two long stone and concrete breakwaters, called the east and west moles, as well as the beaches. Almost 200,000 troops embarked on ships from the east mole (which stretched nearly a mile out to sea) over the next week.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=150\u201351}} Once more, low clouds kept ''Luftwaffe'' activity to a minimum. Nine RAF patrols were mounted, with no German formation encountered.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=119}} The following day, the ''Luftwaffe'' sank one transport and damaged 12 others for 17 losses; the British claimed 38 kills, which was an exaggeration.

The operation commenced after large numbers of [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgian]], [[British Army|British]], and [[French Army|French]] troops were cut off and surrounded by [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German troops]] during the six-week [[Battle of France]]. In a speech to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] called this \"a colossal military disaster\", saying \"the whole root and core and brain of the British Army\" had been stranded at Dunkirk and seemed about to perish or be captured.{{sfn|Churchill|2003|p=212}} In his \"[[we shall fight on the beaches]]\" speech on 4 June, he hailed their rescue as a \"miracle of deliverance\".{{sfn|Safire|2004|p=146}}\n\nAfter [[Nazi Germany]] [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] in September 1939, France and the [[British Empire]] declared war on Germany and imposed an [[Blockade of Germany (1939-45)|economic blockade]]. The [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) was sent to help defend France. After the [[Phoney War]] of October 1939 to April 1940, Germany [[Battle of Belgium|invaded Belgium]], the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], and [[Battle of France|France]] on 10 May 1940. Three [[panzer corps]] attacked through the [[Ardennes]] and drove northwest to the [[English Channel]]. By 21 May, German forces had trapped the BEF, the remains of the Belgian forces, and three French [[field army|field armies]] along the northern coast of France. BEF commander [[General (British Army)|General]] [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Viscount Gort]] immediately saw evacuation across the Channel as the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest good port.\n\nLate on 23 May, a halt order was issued by ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], commander of [[Army Group A]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] approved this order the next day, and had the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] send confirmation to the front. Destroying the trapped BEF, French, and Belgian armies was left to the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' until the order was rescinded on 26 May. This gave Allied forces time to construct defensive works and pull back large numbers of troops to fight the [[Battle of Dunkirk]]. From 28 to 31 May, in the [[Siege of Lille (1940)|Siege of Lille]], the remaining 40,000 men of the once-formidable French First Army fought a delaying action against seven German [[Division (military)|divisions]], including three [[Panzer division|armoured divisions]].\n\nOn the first day only 7,669 Allied soldiers were evacuated, but by the end of the eighth day, 338,226 had been rescued by a hastily assembled fleet of over 800 vessels. Many troops were able to embark from the harbour's protective [[mole (architecture)|mole]] onto 39 British [[Royal Navy]] [[destroyer]]s, 4 [[Royal Canadian Navy]] destroyers,{{sfn|McIntyre|2017}} at least 3 French destroyers, and a variety of civilian merchant ships. Others had to wade out from the beaches, waiting for hours in shoulder-deep water. Some were ferried to the larger ships by what became known as the [[Little Ships of Dunkirk]], a [[flotilla]] of hundreds of [[merchant marine]] boats, [[fishing boat]]s, [[pleasure craft]], [[yacht]]s, and [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]] called into service from Britain. The BEF lost 68,000 soldiers during the French campaign and had to abandon nearly all of its tanks, vehicles, and equipment. In his 4 June speech, Churchill also reminded the country that \"we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}}\n\n==Background==\n{{Further|Battle of France}}\nIn September 1939, after [[Nazi Germany]] [[invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], the United Kingdom sent the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) to aid in the defence of France, landing at [[Cherbourg]], [[Nantes]], and [[Saint-Nazaire]]. By May 1940 the force consisted of ten [[Division (military)|divisions]] in three [[corps]] under the command of General [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort]].{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=9}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=7}} Working with the BEF were the [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgian Army]] and the French [[First Army (France)|First]], [[Seventh Army (France)|Seventh]], and [[Ninth Army (France)|Ninth]] Armies.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=305}}\n\nDuring the 1930s, the French had constructed the [[Maginot Line]], a series of fortifications along their border with Germany. This line had been designed to deter a German invasion across the Franco-German border and funnel an attack into Belgium, which could then be met by the best divisions of the [[French Army]]. Thus, any future war would take place outside of French territory, [[Zone rouge|avoiding a repeat]] of the [[First World War]].{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=33}}{{sfn|Roth|2010|p=6}} The area immediately to the north of the Maginot Line was covered by the heavily wooded [[Ardennes]] region,{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2007|p=23}} which French General [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] declared to be \"impenetrable\" as long as \"special provisions\" were taken. He believed that any enemy force emerging from the forest would be vulnerable to a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] and destroyed.

Due to shortages of personnel, many small craft crossed the Channel with civilian crews.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=198}}\n\nThe first of the \"little ships\" arrived at Dunkirk on 28 May.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=229}} The wide sand beaches meant that large vessels could not get anywhere near the shore, and even small craft had to stop about {{convert|100|yd|m}} from the waterline and wait for the soldiers to wade out.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=225}} In many cases, personnel would abandon their boat upon reaching a larger ship, and subsequent evacuees had to wait for boats to drift ashore with the tide before they could make use of them.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=199}} In most areas on the beaches, soldiers queued up with their units and patiently awaited their turn to leave. But at times, panicky soldiers had to be warned off at gunpoint when they attempted to rush to the boats out of turn.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=167\u201368}} In addition to ferrying out on boats, soldiers at [[De Panne]] and Bray-Dunes constructed improvised jetties by driving rows of abandoned vehicles onto the beach at low tide, anchoring them with sandbags, and connecting them with wooden walkways.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=214\u201315}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Analysis===\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" align=right style=\"text-align: right; margin-left: 2px;\"\n|+ Troops landed from Dunkirk<br>27 May \u2013 4 June{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Beaches\n! scope=\"col\" | Harbour\n! scope=\"col\" | Total\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 27 May\n| \u2014\n| 7,669\n| 7,669\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 28 May\n| 5,930\n| 11,874\n| 17,804\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 29 May\n| 13,752\n| 33,558\n| 47,310\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 30 May\n| 29,512\n| 24,311\n| 53,823\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 31 May\n| 22,942\n| 45,072\n| 68,014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1 June\n| 17,348\n| 47,081\n| 64,429\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2 June\n| 6,695\n| 19,561\n| 26,256\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3 June\n| 1,870\n| 24,876\n| 26,746\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4 June\n| 622\n| 25,553\n| 26,175\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | '''Totals'''\n| '''98,671'''\n| '''239,555'''\n| '''338,226'''\n|}\n{{See also|Battle of Abbeville|Operation Cycle|Operation Ariel}}\nBefore the operation was completed, the prognosis had been gloomy, with Churchill warning the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 28 May to expect \"hard and heavy tidings\".{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=99}} Subsequently, Churchill referred to the outcome as a miracle, and the British press presented the evacuation as a \"disaster turned to triumph\" so successfully that Churchill had to remind the country in a speech to the House of Commons on 4 June that \"we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}} [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]] comments that the confusion over the Dunkirk evacuation is illustrated by two of the best books on it being called \"Strange Defeat\" and \"Strange Victory\".{{sfn|Roberts|2009|p=37}} \n\nThree British divisions and a host of logistic and labour troops were cut off to the south of the Somme by the German \"race to the sea\". At the end of May, a further two divisions began moving to France with the hope of establishing a [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)#The Second BEF and Operation Ariel|Second BEF]]. The majority of the [[51st (Highland) Division]] was forced to surrender on 12 June, but almost 192,000 Allied personnel, 144,000 of them British, were evacuated through various French ports from 15\u201325 June under the codename [[Operation Ariel]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=296\u2013305}} The Germans marched into [[Paris]] on 14 June and France surrendered eight days later.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=232\u201334}}\n\nThe more than 100,000 French troops evacuated from Dunkirk were quickly and efficiently shuttled to camps in various parts of south-western England, where they were temporarily lodged before being repatriated.{{sfn|Looseley|2005|p=}} British ships ferried French troops to [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], and other ports in [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]], although only about half of the repatriated troops were redeployed against the Germans before the surrender of France. For many French soldiers, the Dunkirk evacuation represented only a few weeks' delay before being killed or captured by the German army after their return to France.{{sfn|Mordal|1968|p=496}} Of the French soldiers evacuated from France in June 1940, about 3,000 joined [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s [[Free French]] army in Britain.{{sfn|Nadeau|Barlow|2003|p=89}}\n\nIn France, the unilateral British decision to evacuate through Dunkirk rather than counter-attack to the south, and the perceived preference of the Royal Navy for evacuating British forces at the expense of the French, led to some bitter resentment. According to Churchill, French Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] originally ordered that the British forces should receive preference, but on 31 May, he intervened at a meeting in Paris to order that the evacuation should proceed on equal terms and that the British would form the rearguard.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=111}} In fact, the 35,000 men who finally surrendered after covering the final evacuations were mostly French soldiers of [[2nd Light Mechanized Division (France)|2nd Light Mechanized Division]] and the [[68th Infantry Division (France)|68th Infantry Division]].{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=219}}{{sfn|Stewart|2008|p=115}} Their resistance allowed the evacuation effort to be extended to 4 June, on which date another 26,175 Frenchmen were transported to England.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}\n\nThe evacuation was presented to the German public as an overwhelming and decisive German victory. On 5 June 1940, Hitler stated \"Dunkirk has fallen! 40,000 French and English troops are all that remains of the formerly great armies. Immeasurable quantities of materiel have been captured.

{"title_page": "Rice hoja blanca virus", "text_new": "'''''Rice hoja blanca virus''''' (RHBV), meaning \"white leaf rice virus\", is a plant [[virus]] in the family ''[[Phenuiviridae]].'' RHBV causes Hoja blanca disease (HBD), which affects the leaves of the rice plant ''[[Oryza sativa]]'', stunting the growth of the plant or killing it altogether. RHBV is carried by an insect [[vector (epidemiology)|vector]], ''Tagosodes orizicolus'', a type of [[planthopper]]. The virus is found in South America, Mexico, throughout Central America, the Caribbean region, and the southern United States. In South America, the disease is endemic to Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Suriname, French Guiana and Guyana.\n\n== Virology ==\n{{Taxobox\n| name = Rice hoja blanca virus (RHBV)\n| image = \n| image_caption = \n| virus_group = v\n| ordo = ''[[Bunyavirales]]''\n| familia = ''[[Phenuiviridae]]''\n| genus = ''[[Tenuivirus]]''\n| species = '''''Rice hoja blanca tenuivirus'''''\n}}\n\n=== Viral Classification ===\nRHBV is a single stranded, negative-sense [[RNA virus]] of the genus ''[[Tenuivirus]]'', derived from the Latin \"''tenui\"'', meaning thin or weak. This comes from the nature of ''Tenuiviruses'' to form thin, filamentous viral particles. Other viruses in the genus ''Tenuivirus'' include [[maize stripe virus]] (MSV), [[rice stripe virus]] (RSV), and [[rice grassy stunt virus]] (RGSV). While RHBV and other ''Tenuiviruses'' have single stranded RNA genomes, it is interesting to note that examination of non-denaturing [[gel electrophoresis]] performed with ''Tenuiviruses'' has yielded both single stranded and double stranded RNA.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=de Miranda|first=J.R.|last2=Espinoza|first2=A.M.|last3=Hull|first3=R.|date=January 1996|title=Rapid, small scale purification of rice hoja blanca and Echinochloa hoja blanca tenuivirus ribonucleoprotein|journal=Journal of Virological Methods|volume=56|issue=1|pages=109\u2013113|doi=10.1016/0166-0934(95)01952-9|pmid=8690758}}</ref> Because it is unlikely that both single stranded and double stranded RNA's are encapsidated within the viral [[ribonucleoprotein]], it is theorized that the double stranded RNA sometimes present in gel electrophoresis results comes from the annealing in vitro of single stranded RNA's that possess opposite polarities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Falk|first=B.

Such particles are often found in cells affected by ''Closteroviruses''. However, further research into the subject yielded results indicating that RHBV was more similar to viruses in the newly formed ''Tenuivirus'' group.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morales|first=Francisco J.|date=1983|title=Association of Spiral Filamentous Viruslike Particles with Rice Hoja Blanca|journal=Phytopathology|volume=73|issue=7|pages=971|doi=10.1094/phyto-73-971|issn=0031-949X}}</ref> The particle morphology of ''Tenuiviruses'' is largely consistent across the genus, and RHBV is no exception.

RNA1 is 8,999 base pairs long and is the first and largest segment of the genome, encoding for the viral [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]], which is used by the virus to help synthesize a complementary RNA strand. RNA2 (3,620 base pairs) encodes for the first [[Nonstructural Protein|nonstructural protein]] (NS2) and a [[membrane glycoprotein]]. RNA3 (2,299 base pairs) encodes for another nonstructural protein (NS3) and the nucleocapsid protein. RNA4 (1,998 base pairs) encodes for the major nonstructural protein and another minor nonstructural protein, NS4. RNA2-RNA4 use an [[ambisense]] coding strategy, meaning those RNA segments contain both negative sense and positive sense sections, in order to code for two proteins.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Replication Cycle ==\n\n=== In Insects ===\n\nRHBV is propagative, meaning it infects both host plants and its insect vector.

''T. orizicolus'' feed in the [[phloem]] of target plants, giving them the unique ability to infect plants without outright destroying plant tissue, which in turn promotes successful infection by RHBV. However, plants can be susceptible to \"hopper burn\", where excessive feeding cause an affected plant to dry up. Infection in ''T. orizicolus'' begins when a planthopper feeds on an infected plant. After the virus is acquired by the host, it will incubate for a period ranging for 4\u201331 days. The infected planthopper can then transmit the virus to new plants it feeds on.

Research shows that RHBV likely uses \"[[Cap snatching|cap-snatching]]\", a technique where the virus cleaves and uses the 5' cap of the host cell, in order to begin synthesis of viral mRNA.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramirez|first=B.-C.|last2=Macaya|first2=G.|last3=Calvert|first3=L.

The NS3 protein encoded by RNA3 has been shown to suppress [[RNA silencing]] in both rice and insect vectors, contributing to the successful propagation of the virus.

Plant tissues that are already mature upon infection remain symptomless, while immature tissues display a variety of symptoms. Approximately 4 days after infection, cream-colored spots ranging in size from 2-5 millimeters begin to appear on immature leaves. Eventually, infected leaves suffer [[chlorosis]] and the spots turn white as the leaves mature, giving the virus its namesake. As time goes on, chlorotic spots increase and form stripes, with entire leaves eventually succumbing to infection and becoming completely chlorotic. RHBV infection is systemic to the plant, and subsequent leaves will emerge displaying either heavy stripes or complete chlorosis. [[Tiller (botany)|Tillers]] infected by RHBV will be stunted compared to normal, non-infected tillers. The [[panicle]]s of infected tillers may be sterile, and often have malformed or discolored grains.

RHBV causes Hoja blanca disease (HBD), which affects the leaves of the rice plant ''[[Oryza sativa]]'', stunting the growth of the plant or killing it altogether. RHBV is carried by an insect [[vector (epidemiology)|vector]], ''Tagosodes orizicolus'', a type of [[planthopper]]. The virus is found in South America, Mexico, throughout Central America, the Caribbean region, and the southern United States.

This comes from the nature of ''Tenuiviruses'' to form thin, filamentous viral particles. Other viruses in the genus ''Tenuivirus'' include [[maize stripe virus]] (MSV), [[rice stripe virus]] (RSV), and [[rice grassy stunt virus]] (RGSV). While RHBV and other ''Tenuiviruses'' have single stranded RNA genomes, it is interesting to note that examination of non-denaturing [[gel electrophoresis]] performed with ''Tenuiviruses'' has yielded both single stranded and double stranded RNA.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=de Miranda|first=J.R.|last2=Espinoza|first2=A.M.|last3=Hull|first3=R.|date=January 1996|title=Rapid, small scale purification of rice hoja blanca and Echinochloa hoja blanca tenuivirus ribonucleoprotein|journal=Journal of Virological Methods|volume=56|issue=1|pages=109\u2013113|doi=10.1016/0166-0934(95)01952-9|pmid=8690758}}</ref> Because it is unlikely that both single stranded and double stranded RNA's are encapsidated within the viral [[ribonucleoprotein]], it is theorized that the double stranded RNA sometimes present in gel electrophoresis results comes from the annealing in vitro of single stranded RNA's that possess opposite polarities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Falk|first=B.

RNA1 is 8,999 base pairs long and is the first and largest segment of the genome, encoding for the viral [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]], which is used by the virus to help synthesize a complementary RNA strand. RNA2 (3,620 base pairs) encodes for the first [[Nonstructural Protein|nonstructural protein]] (NS2) and a [[membrane glycoprotein]]. RNA3 (2,299 base pairs) encodes for another nonstructural protein (NS3) and the nucleocapsid protein. RNA4 (1,998 base pairs) encodes for the major nonstructural protein and another minor nonstructural protein, NS4.

However, plants can be susceptible to \"hopper burn\", where excessive feeding cause an affected plant to dry up. Infection in ''T. orizicolus'' begins when a planthopper feeds on an infected plant. After the virus is acquired by the host, it will incubate for a period ranging for 4\u201331 days. The infected planthopper can then transmit the virus to new plants it feeds on.

Plant tissues that are already mature upon infection remain symptomless, while immature tissues display a variety of symptoms. Approximately 4 days after infection, cream-colored spots ranging in size from 2-5 millimeters begin to appear on immature leaves. Eventually, infected leaves suffer [[chlorosis]] and the spots turn white as the leaves mature, giving the virus its namesake. As time goes on, chlorotic spots increase and form stripes, with entire leaves eventually succumbing to infection and becoming completely chlorotic. RHBV infection is systemic to the plant, and subsequent leaves will emerge displaying either heavy stripes or complete chlorosis. [[Tiller (botany)|Tillers]] infected by RHBV will be stunted compared to normal, non-infected tillers. The [[panicle]]s of infected tillers may be sterile, and often have malformed or discolored grains. Root size and number will reduce, with the roots eventually turning brown and dying completely.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.plantwise.org/|title=Plantwise - Home|website=www.plantwise.org|access-date=2019-03-13}}</ref>\n\nRHBV can also cause symptoms in its insect vector, infecting various organs and glands in the planthopper.

The specimen is most often an ultrathin section less than 100&nbsp;nm thick or a suspension on a grid. An image is formed from the interaction of the electrons with the sample as the beam is transmitted through the specimen. The image is then magnified and [[Focus (optics)|focused]] onto an imaging device, such as a [[fluorescent]] screen, a layer of [[photographic film]], or a sensor such as a scintillator attached to a [[charge-coupled device]].\n\nTransmission electron microscopes are capable of imaging at a significantly higher [[Optical resolution|resolution]] than [[Optical microscope|light microscopes]], owing to the smaller [[de Broglie wavelength]] of electrons. This enables the instrument to capture fine detail\u2014even as small as a single column of atoms, which is thousands of times smaller than a resolvable object seen in a light microscope. Transmission electron microscopy is a major analytical method in the physical, chemical and biological sciences. TEMs find application in [[cancer research]], [[virology]], and [[materials science]] as well as [[pollution]], [[nanotechnology]] and [[semiconductor]] research, but also in other fields such as [[paleontology]] and [[palynology]].\n\nTEM instruments boast an enormous array of operating modes including conventional imaging, scanning TEM imaging (STEM), diffraction, spectroscopy, and combinations of these. Even within conventional imaging, there are many fundamentally different ways that contrast is produced, called \"image contrast mechanisms.\" Contrast can arise from position-to-position differences in the thickness or density (\"mass-thickness contrast\"), atomic number (\"Z contrast,\" referring to the common abbreviation Z for atomic number), crystal structure or orientation (\"crystallographic contrast\" or \"diffraction contrast\"), the slight quantum-mechanical phase shifts that individual atoms produce in electrons that pass through them (\"phase contrast\"), the energy lost by electrons on passing through the sample (\"spectrum imaging\") and more. Each mechanism tells the user a different kind of information, depending not only on the contrast mechanism but on how the microscope is used\u2014the settings of lenses, apertures, and detectors. What this means is that a TEM is capable of returning an extraordinary variety of nanometer- and atomic-resolution information, in ideal cases revealing not only where all the atoms are but what kinds of atoms they are and how they are bonded to each other. For this reason TEM is regarded as an essential tool for nanoscience in both biological and materials fields.\n\nThe first TEM was demonstrated by [[Max Knoll]] and [[Ernst Ruska]] in 1931, with this group developing the first TEM with resolution greater than that of light in 1933 and the first commercial TEM in 1939. In 1986, Ruska was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for the development of transmission electron microscopy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History==\n<!-- This section uses {{cite book|title=The Early Development of Electron Lenses and Electron Microscopy|author1=Ernst Ruska |author2=translation by T Mulvey |isbn=3-7776-0364-3}} as a reference.

The team consisted of several PhD students including [[Ernst Ruska]] and [[Bodo von Borries]]. The research team worked on lens design and CRO column placement, to optimize parameters to construct better CROs, and make electron optical components to generate low magnification (nearly 1:1) images. In 1931, the group successfully generated magnified images of mesh grids placed over the anode aperture. The device used two magnetic lenses to achieve higher magnifications, arguably creating the first electron microscope. In that same year, [[Reinhold Rudenberg]], the scientific director of the [[Siemens]] company,  patented an [[electrostatic lens]] electron microscope.<ref name=ruska/><ref>{{cite web|title=Configuration for the enlarged imaging of objects by electron beams|date=May 30, 1931 |url=http://v3.espacenet.com/searchResults?locale=en_GB&PN=DE906737&compact=false&DB=EPODOC|author=Rudenberg, Reinhold  |work=Patent DE906737}}</ref>\n\n===Improving resolution===\nAt the time, electrons were understood to be charged particles of matter; the wave nature of electrons was not fully realized until the publication of the [[Matter wave|De Broglie hypothesis]] in 1927.<ref>{{cite journal|title=La nouvelle dynamique des quanta|author=Broglie, L.|journal=\u00c9lectrons et Photons: Rapports et Discussions du Cinqui\u00e8me Conseil de Physique.

(Even for electrons with a kinetic energy of just 1 volt the wavelength is already as short as 1.23&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]].) In April 1932, Ruska suggested the construction of a new electron microscope for direct imaging of specimens inserted into the microscope, rather than simple mesh grids or images of apertures. With this device successful [[diffraction]] and normal imaging of an aluminium sheet was achieved. However the magnification achievable was lower than with light microscopy. Magnifications higher than those available with a light microscope were achieved in September 1933 with images of [[cotton fiber]]s quickly acquired before being damaged by the electron beam.<ref name=ruska/>\n\n<!-- Albert Prebus's work is not mentioned by Ruska? -->\nAt this time, interest in the electron microscope had increased, with other groups, such as that of Paul Anderson and Kenneth Fitzsimmons of [[Washington State University]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microscopy.org/about/history.cfm|title=A Brief History of the Microscopy Society of America|publisher=microscopy.org}}</ref> and that of Albert Prebus and [[James Hillier]] at the [[University of Toronto]], who constructed the first TEMs in North America in 1935 and 1938, respectively,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comdir.bfree.on.ca/hillier/hilbio.htm|title=Dr. James Hillier, Biography|work=comdir.bfree.on.ca}}</ref> continually advancing TEM design.\n\nResearch continued on the electron microscope at [[Siemens]] in 1936, where the aim of the research was the development and improvement of TEM imaging properties, particularly with regard to biological specimens.

The wavelength of electrons is related to their kinetic energy via the de Broglie equation, which says that the wavelength is inversely proportional to the momentum. Taking into account relativistic effects (as in a TEM an electron's velocity is a substantial fraction of the speed of light,&nbsp;''c''<ref>{{cite book|title=Electron Diffraction in the Transmission Electron Microscope|author=Champness, P.

A field emission source uses instead electrostatic electrodes called an extractor, a suppressor, and a gun lens, with different voltages on each, to control the electric field shape and intensity near the sharp tip. The combination of the cathode and these first electrostatic lens elements is often collectively called the \"electron gun.\" After it leaves the gun, the beam is typically accelerated by a series of electrostatic plates until it reaches its final voltage and enters the next part of the microscope: The condenser lens system. These upper lenses of the TEM then further focus the electron beam to the desired size and location on the sample.<ref name=\"rose\">{{cite journal| doi= 10.1088/0031-8949/9/1/014107|title=Optics of high-performance electron Microscopes|volume= 9|issue=1|year= 2008| author= Rose, H H| journal= Science and Technology of Advanced Materials| page= 014107|bibcode = 2008STAdM...9a4107R |pmc= 5099802| pmid=27877933}}</ref>\n\nManipulation of the electron beam is performed using two physical effects. The interaction of electrons with a magnetic field will cause electrons to move according to the [[left hand rule]], thus allowing for [[electromagnet]]s to manipulate the electron beam. The use of magnetic fields allows for the formation of a magnetic lens of variable focusing power, the lens shape originating due to the distribution of magnetic flux. Additionally, [[electrostatic field]]s can cause the electrons to be deflected through a constant angle. Coupling of two deflections in opposing directions with a small intermediate gap allows for the formation of a shift in the beam path, allowing for beam shifting in TEM, which is important for [[Scanning transmission electron microscope|STEM]]. From these two effects, as well as the use of an electron imaging system, sufficient control over the beam path is possible for TEM operation. The optical configuration of a TEM can be rapidly changed, unlike that for an optical microscope, as lenses in the beam path can be enabled, have their strength changed, or be disabled entirely simply via rapid electrical switching, the speed of which is limited by effects such as the magnetic hysteresis of the lenses.\n\n===Optics===\nThe lenses of a TEM are what gives it its flexibility of operating modes and ability to focus beams down to the atomic scale and magnify them back up to get an image on a camera. A lens is usually made of a solenoid coil nearly surrounded by ferromagnetic materials designed to concentrate the coil's magnetic field into a precise, confined shape. When an electron enters and leaves this magnetic field, it spirals around the curved magnetic field lines in a way that acts very much as an ordinary glass lens does for light\u2014it is a converging lens. But, unlike a glass lens, a magnetic lens can very easily change its focusing power simply by adjusting the current passing through the coils. This provides a flexibility of operation that gets further multiplied when the lenses are assembled into stacks of independent lenses, each of which can focus, defocus, magnify, and/or collimate the beam coming from the previous lens. This allows a single lens system, between the source and the sample (the \"condenser lens\" system) to produce a parallel beam over 1 millimeter in diameter, a tightly focused beam smaller than an atom, or anything in between. An additional lens stack, the \"intermediate/projector\" lens system, is after the sample. It can be adjusted to produce a focused diffraction pattern or image of the sample with a magnification varying over a huge range. Many single microscopes can cover the magnification range from roughly 100X to more than 1,000,000X.\n\nEqually important to the lenses are the apertures. These are circular holes in thin strips of heavy metal, placed at well-chosen points in the column of lenses. Some are fixed in size and position and play important roles in limiting x-ray generation and improving the vacuum performance. They also prevent electrons from passing through the outermost parts of the magnetic lenses which, due to large lens aberrations, focus the electron beams extremely poorly. Others can be freely switched among several different sizes and have their positions adjusted. These \"variable apertures\" are used to determine the beam current reaching the sample and also to improve the ability to focus the beam. Variable apertures after the sample position further allow the user to select the range of spatial positions or electron scattering angles to be used in the formation of an image or a diffraction pattern. Skillfully used, these apertures allow remarkably precise and detailed study of the defects in crystals.\n\nThe electron-optical system also includes deflectors and stigmators, usually made of small electromagnets. Unlike the lenses, the magnetic fields produced by the deflectors are oriented primarily to deflect the beam and not to focus it. The deflectors allow the position and angle of the beam at the sample position to be independently controlled (as is essential for STEM) and also ensure that the beams remain near the low-aberration centers of every lens in the lens stacks. The stigmators provide an auxiliary fine focusing, compensating for slight imperfections and aberrations that cause astigmatism\u2014a lens having a different focal strength in different directions.\n\nTypically a TEM consists of three stages of lensing. The stages are the condenser lenses, the objective lenses, and the projector lenses. The condenser lenses are responsible for primary beam formation, while the objective lenses focus the beam that comes through the sample itself (in STEM scanning mode, there are also objective lenses above the sample to make the incident electron beam convergent). The projector lenses are used to expand the beam onto the phosphor screen or other imaging device, such as film. The magnification of the TEM is due to the ratio of the distances between the specimen and the objective lens' image plane.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rodenburg.org/guide/t700.html|title=The objective lens of a TEM, the heart of the electron microscope|publisher=rodenburg.org}}</ref> Additional [[stigmator]]s allow for the correction of asymmetrical beam distortions, known as [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|astigmatism]]. It is noted that TEM optical configurations differ significantly with implementation, with manufacturers using custom lens configurations, such as in [[spherical aberration]] corrected instruments,<ref name=\"rose\" /> or TEMs using energy filtering to correct electron [[chromatic aberration]].\n\n==== Reciprocity ====\nThe optical reciprocity theorem, or principle of [[Helmholtz reciprocity]], generally holds true for [[Elastic scattering|elastically scattered]] electrons in an absorbing medium, as is often the case under standard TEM operating conditions.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Pogany|first=A.

Imaging devices are subsequently used to create an image from the electrons that exit the system.\n\n===Vacuum system===\nTo increase the [[mean free path]] of the electron gas interaction, a standard TEM is evacuated to low pressures, typically on the order of 10<sup>\u22124</sup> [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rodenburg.org/guide/t1400.html|title=The Vacuum System|author=Rodenburg, J M |publisher=rodenburg.org}}</ref> The need for this is twofold: first the allowance for the voltage difference between the cathode and the ground without generating an arc, and secondly to reduce the collision frequency of electrons with gas atoms to negligible levels\u2014this effect is characterized by the [[mean free path]]. TEM components such as specimen holders and film cartridges must be routinely inserted or replaced requiring a system with the ability to re-evacuate on a regular basis. As such, TEMs are equipped with multiple pumping systems and airlocks and are not permanently vacuum sealed.\n\nThe vacuum system for evacuating a TEM to an operating pressure level consists of several stages. Initially, a low or roughing vacuum is achieved with either a [[rotary vane pump]] or [[diaphragm pump]]s setting a sufficiently low pressure to allow the operation of a [[turbo-molecular pump|turbo-molecular]] or [[diffusion pump]] establishing high vacuum level necessary for operations. To allow for the low vacuum pump to not require continuous operation, while continually operating the turbo-molecular pumps, the vacuum side of a low-pressure pump may be connected to chambers which accommodate the exhaust gases from the turbo-molecular pump.<ref name=\"DykstraAndRoss\">{{cite book|title=Biological Electron Microscopy: Theory, techniques and troubleshooting|first=Dykstra, M|last=Ross, L.

In addition to 3.05&nbsp;mm grids, 2.3&nbsp;mm grids are sometimes, if rarely, used. These grids were particularly used in the mineral sciences where a large degree of tilt can be required and where specimen material may be extremely rare. Electron transparent specimens have a thickness usually less than 100&nbsp;nm, but this value depends on the accelerating voltage.\n\nOnce inserted into a TEM, the sample has to be manipulated to locate the region of interest to the beam, such as in single [[Crystallite|grain]] diffraction, in a specific orientation. To accommodate this, the TEM stage allows movement of the sample in the XY plane, Z height adjustment, and commonly a single tilt direction parallel to the axis of side entry holders. Sample rotation may be available on specialized diffraction holders and stages. Some modern TEMs provide the ability for two orthogonal tilt angles of movement with specialized holder designs called double-tilt sample holders. Some stage designs, such as top-entry or vertical insertion stages once common for high resolution TEM studies, may simply only have X-Y translation available. The design criteria of TEM stages are complex, owing to the simultaneous requirements of mechanical and electron-optical constraints and specialized models are available for different methods.\n\nA TEM stage is required to have the ability to hold a specimen and be manipulated to bring the region of interest into the path of the electron beam. As the TEM can operate over a wide range of magnifications, the stage must simultaneously be highly resistant to mechanical drift, with drift requirements as low as a few nm/minute while being able to move several \u03bcm/minute, with repositioning accuracy on the order of nanometers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Improving the Positional Accuracy of the Goniometer on the Philips CM Series TEM|journal=Journal of Structural Biology|pages=250\u2013256|volume=128|year=1999|doi=10.1006/jsbi.1999.4181|pmid=10633064|last1=Pulokas|first1=James|last2=Green|first2=Carmen|last3=Kisseberth|first3=Nick|last4=Potter|first4=Clinton S.|last5=Carragher|first5=Bridget|issue=3}}</ref> Earlier designs of TEM accomplished this with a complex set of mechanical downgearing devices, allowing the operator to finely control the motion of the stage by several rotating rods. Modern devices may use electrical stage designs, using screw gearing in concert with [[stepper motor]]s, providing the operator with a computer-based stage input, such as a [[joystick]] or [[trackball]].\n\nTwo main designs for stages in a TEM exist, the side-entry and top entry version.<ref name=\"WilliamsAndCarter_v1\"/> Each design must accommodate the matching holder to allow for specimen insertion without either damaging delicate TEM optics or allowing gas into TEM systems under vacuum.\n\n[[File:TEM-Single-tilt.svg|A diagram of a single axis tilt sample holder for insertion into a TEM goniometer. Titling of the holder is achieved by rotation of the entire goniometer|left|thumb|300px]] The most common is the side entry holder, where the specimen is placed near the tip of a long metal (brass or stainless steel) rod, with the specimen placed flat in a small bore. Along the rod are several polymer vacuum rings to allow for the formation of a vacuum seal of sufficient quality, when inserted into the stage. The stage is thus designed to accommodate the rod, placing the sample either in between or near the objective lens, dependent upon the objective design. When inserted into the stage, the side entry holder has its tip contained within the TEM vacuum, and the base is presented to atmosphere, the airlock formed by the vacuum rings.\n\nInsertion procedures for side-entry TEM holders typically involve the rotation of the sample to trigger [[micro switch]]es that initiate evacuation of the airlock before the sample is inserted into the TEM column.\n\nThe second design is the top-entry holder consists of a cartridge that is several cm long with a bore drilled down the cartridge axis. The specimen is loaded into the bore, possibly using a small screw ring to hold the sample in place. This cartridge is inserted into an airlock with the bore perpendicular to the TEM optic axis. When sealed, the airlock is manipulated to push the cartridge such that the cartridge falls into place, where the bore hole becomes aligned with the beam axis, such that the beam travels down the cartridge bore and into the specimen. Such designs are typically unable to be tilted without blocking the beam path or interfering with the objective lens.<ref name=\"WilliamsAndCarter_v1\"/>\n\n===Electron gun===\n[[File:Electron-gun.svg|right|thumb|275px|Cross sectional diagram of an electron gun assembly, illustrating electron extraction]]\n\n{{main|Electron gun}}\n\nThe electron gun is formed from several components: the filament, a biasing circuit, a Wehnelt cap, and an extraction anode. By connecting the filament to the negative component power supply, electrons can be \"pumped\" from the electron gun to the anode plate and the TEM column, thus completing the circuit. The gun is designed to create a beam of electrons exiting from the assembly at some given angle, known as the gun divergence semi-angle, \u03b1. By constructing the Wehnelt cylinder such that it has a higher negative charge than the filament itself, electrons that exit the filament in a diverging manner are, under proper operation, forced into a converging pattern the minimum size of which is the gun crossover diameter.\n\nThe thermionic emission current density, ''J'', can be related to the [[work function]] of the emitting material via [[Richardson's law]]\n:<math>J=AT^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Phi}{kT}\\right),</math>\nwhere ''A'' is the [[Owen Willans Richardson|Richardson's]] constant, \u03a6 is the work function and T is the temperature of the material.<ref name=\"WilliamsAndCarter_v1\"/>\n\nThis equation shows that in order to achieve sufficient current density it is necessary to heat the emitter, taking care not to cause damage by application of excessive heat. For this reason materials with either a high melting point, such as tungsten, or those with a low work function (LaB<sub>6</sub>) are required for the gun filament.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Thermionic emission properties of a lanthanum hexaboride/rhenium cathode|year=1965|journal=British Journal of Applied Physics|volume= 16|page=1821|author=Buckingham, J |bibcode = 1965BJAP...16.1821B |doi = 10.1088/0508-3443/16/12/306|issue=12 }}</ref> Furthermore, both lanthanum hexaboride and tungsten thermionic sources must be heated in order to achieve thermionic emission, this can be achieved by the use of a small resistive strip. To prevent thermal shock, there is often a delay enforced in the application of current to the tip, to prevent thermal gradients from damaging the filament, the delay is usually a few seconds for LaB<sub>6</sub>, and significantly lower for tungsten{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.\n\n===Electron lens===\n[[File:TEM-lens.svg|thumb|left|Diagram of a TEM split pole piece design lens]]\n\nElectron lenses are designed to act in a manner emulating that of an optical lens, by focusing parallel electrons at some constant focal distance. Electron lenses may operate electrostatically or magnetically. The majority of electron lenses for TEM use [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] coils to generate a [[convex lens]]. The field produced for the lens must be radially symmetrical, as deviation from the radial symmetry of the magnetic lens causes aberrations such as [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|astigmatism]], and worsens [[Spherical aberration|spherical]] and [[chromatic aberration]]. Electron lenses are manufactured from iron, iron-cobalt or nickel cobalt alloys,<ref name=\"HbCPO\">{{cite book|editor=Orloff, J|title=Handbook of Electron Optics|year=1997|publisher=CRC-press|isbn=978-0-8493-2513-7}}</ref> such as [[permalloy]]. These are selected for their magnetic properties, such as [[magnetic saturation]], [[magnetic hysteresis|hysteresis]] and [[magnetic permeability|permeability]].\n\nThe components include the yoke, the magnetic coil, the poles, the polepiece, and the external control circuitry. The pole piece must be manufactured in a very symmetrical manner, as this provides the [[boundary conditions]] for the magnetic field that forms the lens. Imperfections in the manufacture of the pole piece can induce severe distortions in the magnetic field symmetry, which induce distortions that will ultimately limit the lenses' ability to reproduce the object plane. The exact dimensions of the gap, pole piece internal diameter and taper, as well as the overall design of the lens is often performed by [[finite element analysis]] of the magnetic field, whilst considering the thermal and electrical constraints of the design.<ref name=\"HbCPO\"/>\n\nThe coils which produce the magnetic field are located within the lens yoke. The coils can contain a variable current, but typically use high voltages, and therefore require significant insulation in order to prevent short-circuiting the lens components. Thermal distributors are placed to ensure the extraction of the heat generated by the energy lost to resistance of the coil windings. The windings may be water-cooled, using a chilled water supply in order to facilitate the removal of the high thermal duty.\n\n===Apertures===\nApertures are annular metallic plates, through which electrons that are further than a fixed distance from the [[optic axis]] may be excluded. These consist of a small metallic disc that is sufficiently thick to prevent electrons from passing through the disc, whilst permitting axial electrons. This permission of central electrons in a TEM causes two effects simultaneously: firstly, apertures decrease the beam intensity as electrons are filtered from the beam, which may be desired in the case of beam sensitive samples. Secondly, this filtering removes electrons that are scattered to high angles, which may be due to unwanted processes such as spherical or chromatic aberration, or due to diffraction from interaction within the sample.<ref name=\"Reimer08\">{{cite book|title=Transmission Electron Microscopy: Physics of Image Formation|author=Reimer, L and Kohl, H|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-34758-5}}</ref>\n\nApertures are either a fixed aperture within the column, such as at the condenser lens, or are a movable aperture, which can be inserted or withdrawn from the beam path, or moved in the plane perpendicular to the beam path. Aperture assemblies are mechanical devices which allow for the selection of different aperture sizes, which may be used by the operator to trade off intensity and the filtering effect of the aperture. Aperture assemblies are often equipped with micrometers to move the aperture, required during optical calibration.\n\n==Imaging methods==\nImaging methods in TEM use the information contained in the electron waves exiting from the sample to form an image. The projector lenses allow for the correct positioning of this electron wave distribution onto the viewing system. The observed intensity, ''I'', of the image, assuming sufficiently high quality of imaging device, can be approximated as proportional to the time-averaged squared absolute value of the [[amplitude]] of the electron wavefunctions, where the wave that forms the exit beam is denoted by \u03a8.<ref name=\"Cowley\">{{cite book|author=Cowley, J. M|year=1995|title=Diffraction physics|publisher=Elsevier Science B. V.|isbn=978-0-444-82218-5}}</ref>\n\n:<math> I(x)= \\frac{k}{t_1-t_0} \\int^{t_1}_{t_0} \\Psi\\Psi^{\\mathrm{*}} \\, dt</math>\n\nDifferent imaging methods therefore attempt to modify the electron waves exiting the sample in a way that provides information about the sample, or the beam itself. From the previous equation, it can be deduced that the observed image depends not only on the amplitude of beam, but also on the phase of the electrons,{{clarify|date=December 2019|reason=How?}} although phase effects may often be ignored at lower magnifications. Higher resolution imaging requires thinner samples and higher energies of incident electrons, which means that the sample can no longer be considered to be absorbing electrons (i.e., via a Beer's law effect). Instead, the sample can be modeled as an object that does not change the amplitude of the incoming electron wave function, but instead modifies the phase of the incoming wave; in this model, the sample is known as a pure phase object. For sufficiently thin specimens, phase effects dominate the image, complicating analysis of the observed intensities.<ref name=\"Cowley\"/> To improve the contrast in the image, the TEM may be operated at a slight defocus to enhance contrast, owing to convolution by the [[optical transfer function|contrast transfer function]] of the TEM,<ref name=\"kirkland\"/> which would normally decrease contrast if the sample was not a weak phase object.\n[[File:Schematic view of imaging and diffraction modes in TEM.tif|thumb|Schematic view of imaging and diffraction modes in TEM.]]\n\nThe figure on the right shows the two basic operation modes of TEM \u2013 imaging and diffraction modes. In both cases the specimen is illuminated with the parallel beam, formed by electron beam shaping with the system of Condenser lenses and Condenser aperture. After interaction with the sample, on the exit surface of the specimen two types of electrons exist \u2013 unscattered (which will correspond to the bright central beam on the diffraction pattern) and scattered electrons (which change their trajectories due to interaction with the material).\n\nIn Imaging mode, the objective aperture is inserted in a back focal plane (BFP) of the objective lens (where diffraction spots are formed). If using the objective aperture to select only the central beam, the transmitted electrons are passed through the aperture while all others are blocked, and a bright field image (BF image) is obtained. If we allow the signal from a diffracted beam, a dark field image (DF image) is received. The selected signal is magnified and projected on a screen (or on a camera) with the help of Intermediate and Projector lenses. An image of the sample is thus obtained.\n\nIn Diffraction mode, a selected area aperture may be used to determine more precisely the specimen area from which the signal will be displayed. By changing the strength of current to the intermediate lens, the diffraction pattern is projected on a screen. Diffraction is a very powerful tool for doing a cell reconstruction and crystal orientation determination.\n\n===Contrast formation===\n\nThe contrast between two adjacent areas in a TEM image can be defined as the difference in the electron densities in image plane. Due to the scattering of the incident beam by the sample, the amplitude and phase of the electron wave change, which results in '''''amplitude contrast''''' and '''''phase contrast''''', correspondingly. Most of images have both contrast components.\n\n'''Amplitude\u2013contrast''' is obtained due to removal of some electrons before the image plane. During their interaction with the specimen some of electrons will be lost due to absorption, or due to scattering at very high angles beyond the physical limitation of microscope or are blocked by the objective aperture. While the first two losses are due to the specimen and microscope construction, the objective aperture can be used by operator to enhance the contrast.\n\n[[File:TEM image of Pt polycrystalline film and correspondent diffraction pattern.tif|thumb|BF and DF contrast demonstration. TEM image of polycrystalline Pt film]]\n\nFigure on the right shows a TEM image (a) and the corresponding diffraction pattern (b) of Pt polycrystalline film taken without an objective aperture. In order to enhance the contrast in the TEM image the number of scattered beams as visible in the diffraction pattern should be reduced. This can be done by selecting a certain area in the back focal plane such as only the central beam or a specific diffracted beam (angle), or combinations of such beams. By intentionally selecting an objective aperture which only permits the non-diffracted beam to pass beyond the back focal plane (and onto the image plane): one creates a Bright-Field (BF) image (c), whereas if the central, non-diffracted beam is blocked: one may obtain Dark-Field (DF) images such as those shown in (d-e). The DF images (d-e) were obtained by selecting the diffracted beams indicated in diffraction pattern with circles (b) using an aperture at the back focal plane. Grains from which electrons are scattered into these diffraction spots appear brighter. More details about diffraction contrast formation are given further.\n\nThere are two types of amplitude contrast \u2013 mass\u2013thickness and diffraction contrast. First, let's consider '''''mass\u2013thickness contrast'''''. When the beam illuminates two neighbouring areas with low mass (or thickness) and high mass (or thickness), the heavier region scatters electrons at bigger angles. These strongly scattered electrons are blocked in BF TEM mode by objective aperture. As a result, heavier regions appear darker in BF images (have low intensity). Mass\u2013thickness contrast is most important for non\u2013crystalline, amorphous materials.\n\n'''''Diffraction contrast''''' occurs due to a specific crystallographic orientation of a grain. In such a case the crystal is in a so-called Bragg condition, whereby atomic planes are oriented in a way that there is a high probability of scattering. Thus diffraction contrast provides information on the orientation of the crystals in a polycrystalline sample. Note that in case diffraction contrast exists, the contrast cannot be interpreted as due to mass or thickness variations.\n\n====Diffraction contrast====\n{{Main|Electron diffraction}}\n[[Image:TEM micrograph dislocations precipitate stainless steel 1.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Transmission electron micrograph of [[dislocation]]s in steel, which are faults in the structure of the crystal lattice at the atomic scale]]\nSamples can exhibit diffraction contrast, whereby the electron beam undergoes [[Bragg scattering]], which in the case of a crystalline sample, disperses electrons into discrete locations in the [[back focal plane]]. By the placement of apertures in the back focal plane, i.e. the objective aperture, the desired Bragg reflections can be selected (or excluded), thus only parts of the sample that are causing the electrons to scatter to the selected reflections will end up projected onto the imaging apparatus.\n\nIf the reflections that are selected do not include the unscattered beam (which will appear up at the focal point of the lens), then the image will appear dark wherever no sample scattering to the selected peak is present, as such a region without a specimen will appear dark. This is known as a dark-field image.\n\nModern TEMs are often equipped with specimen holders that allow the user to tilt the specimen to a range of angles in order to obtain specific diffraction conditions, and apertures placed above the specimen allow the user to select electrons that would otherwise be diffracted in a particular direction from entering the specimen.\n\nApplications for this method include the identification of [[lattice defect]]s in crystals. By carefully selecting the orientation of the sample, it is possible not just to determine the position of defects but also to determine the type of defect present. If the sample is oriented so that one particular plane is only slightly tilted away from the strongest diffracting angle (known as the [[Bragg diffraction|Bragg Angle]]), any distortion of the crystal plane that locally tilts the plane to the Bragg angle will produce particularly strong contrast variations. However, defects that produce only displacement of atoms that do not tilt the crystal to the Bragg angle (i. e. displacements parallel to the crystal plane) will not produce strong contrast.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Hull, D.  |author2=Bacon, J |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Introduction to dislocations|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2001|edition=4th |isbn=978-0-7506-4681-9}}</ref>\n\n====Phase contrast====\n{{Main|High-resolution transmission electron microscopy}}\n\nCrystal structure can also be investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), also known as [[phase contrast]]. When using a field emission source and a specimen of uniform thickness, the images are formed due to differences in phase of electron waves, which is caused by specimen interaction.<ref name=\"kirkland\">{{cite book|title=Advanced computing in Electron Microscopy|author=Kirkland, E|publisher=Springer|year=1998|isbn=978-0-306-45936-8}}</ref> Image formation is given by the complex modulus of the incoming electron beams. As such, the image is not only dependent on the number of electrons hitting the screen, making direct interpretation of phase contrast images more complex. However this effect can be used to an advantage, as it can be manipulated to provide more information about the sample, such as in complex [[phase retrieval]] techniques.\n\n===Diffraction===\n{{Main|Selected area diffraction}}\n[[Image:Austenite ZADP.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Crystalline diffraction pattern from a twinned grain of FCC Austenitic steel]]\n\nAs previously stated, by adjusting the magnetic lenses such that the back focal plane of the lens rather than the imaging plane is placed on the imaging apparatus a [[diffraction pattern]] can be generated. For thin crystalline samples, this produces an image that consists of a pattern of dots in the case of a single crystal, or a series of rings in the case of a [[polycrystalline]] or [[amorphous|amorphous solid]] material. For the single crystal case the diffraction pattern is dependent upon the orientation of the specimen and the structure of the sample illuminated by the electron beam. This image provides the investigator with information about the [[space group]] symmetries in the crystal and the crystal's orientation to the beam path. This is typically done without using any information but the position at which the diffraction spots appear and the observed image symmetries.\n\nDiffraction patterns can have a large dynamic range, and for crystalline samples, may have intensities greater than those recordable by CCD. As such, TEMs may still be equipped with film cartridges for the purpose of obtaining these images, as the film is a single use detector.\n\n[[Image:KikuchiLines2.png|thumb|right|175px|Convergent-beam Kikuchi lines from silicon, near the [100] [[Miller index|zone axis]]]]\nAnalysis of diffraction patterns beyond point-position can be complex, as the image is sensitive to a number of factors such as specimen thickness and orientation, objective lens defocus, and spherical and chromatic aberration. Although quantitative interpretation of the contrast shown in lattice images is possible, it is inherently complicated and can require extensive computer simulation and analysis, such as [[multislice|electron multislice]] analysis.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Scattering of Electrons by Atoms and Crystals.

In [[convergent beam electron diffraction]] (CBED) where a non-parallel, i.e. converging, electron wavefront is produced by concentrating the electron beam into a fine probe at the sample surface, the interaction of the convergent beam can provide information beyond structural data such as sample thickness.\n\n====Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)====\n{{Main|Electron energy loss spectroscopy}}\nUsing the advanced technique of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), for TEMs appropriately equipped, electrons can be separated into a spectrum based upon their velocity (which is closely related to their kinetic energy, and thus energy loss from the beam energy), using [[magnetic sector]] based devices known as EEL spectrometers. These devices allow for the selection of particular energy values, which can be associated with the way the electron has interacted with the sample. For example, different elements in a sample result in different electron energies in the beam after the sample. This normally results in chromatic aberration \u2013 however this effect can, for example, be used to generate an image which provides information on elemental composition, based upon the atomic transition during electron-electron interaction.<ref>{{cite book|author=Egerton, R. F.|title=Electron Energy-loss Spectroscopy in the Electron Microscope|year=1996|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-45223-9}}</ref>\n\nEELS spectrometers can often be operated in both spectroscopic and imaging modes, allowing for isolation or rejection of [[elastic scattering|elastically scattered]] beams. As for many images inelastic scattering will include information that may not be of interest to the investigator thus reducing observable signals of interest, EELS imaging can be used to enhance contrast in observed images, including both bright field and diffraction, by rejecting unwanted components.\n\n===Three-dimensional imaging===\n[[File:TEM-parapoxvirus-tomograph.ogv|thumb|left|225px|A three-dimensional TEM image of a parapoxvirus<ref>{{cite journal|title=Electron tomography of negatively stained complex viruses: application in their diagnosis|volume=4|year=2009|pmid=19208223|doi=10.1186/1746-1596-4-5|journal=Diagnostic Pathology|page=5|pmc=2649040|last1=Mast|first1=Jan|last2=Demeestere|first2=Lien}}</ref>]]\nAs TEM specimen holders typically allow for the rotation of a sample by a desired angle, multiple views of the same specimen can be obtained by rotating the angle of the sample along an axis perpendicular to the beam. By taking multiple images of a single TEM sample at differing angles, typically in 1\u00b0 increments, a set of images known as a \"tilt series\" can be collected. This methodology was proposed in the 1970s by [[Walter Hoppe]]. Under purely absorption contrast conditions, this set of images can be used to construct a three-dimensional representation of the sample.<ref name=\"Frank\">{{cite book|editor=Frank, J |title=Electron tomography: methods for three-dimensional visualization of structures in the cell|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-31234-7|year=2006}}</ref>\n\nThe reconstruction is accomplished by a two-step process, first images are aligned to account for errors in the positioning of a sample; such errors can occur due to vibration or mechanical drift.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Levin, B.

Secondly, using a reconstruction algorithm, such as [[filtered back projection]], the aligned image slices can be transformed from a set of two-dimensional images, ''I''<sub>''j''</sub>(''x'',&nbsp;''y''), to a single three-dimensional image, ''I''<nowiki>'</nowiki><sub>''j''</sub>(''x'',&nbsp;''y'',&nbsp;''z''). This three-dimensional image is of particular interest when morphological information is required, further study can be undertaken using computer algorithms, such as [[isosurface]]s and data slicing to analyse the data.\n\nAs TEM samples cannot typically be viewed at a full 180\u00b0 rotation, the observed images typically suffer from a \"missing wedge\" of data, which when using [[Projection-slice theorem|Fourier-based back projection]] methods decreases the range of resolvable frequencies in the three-dimensional reconstruction.<ref name=\"Frank\"/> Mechanical refinements, such as multi-axis tilting (two tilt series of the same specimen made at orthogonal directions) and conical tomography (where the specimen is first tilted to a given fixed angle and then imaged at equal angular rotational increments through one complete rotation in the plane of the specimen grid) can be used to limit the impact of the missing data on the observed specimen morphology. Using [[focused ion beam]] milling, a new technique has been proposed<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kawase |first=Noboru |author2=Kato, Mitsuro  |author3=Jinnai, Hiroshi |year=2007 |title=Transmission electron microtomography without the 'missing wedge' for quantitative structural analysis |journal=Ultramicroscopy |volume=107 |issue=1 |pages=8\u201315 |doi=10.1016/j.ultramic.2006.04.007 |pmid=16730409|last4=Jinnai |first4=H }}</ref> which uses pillar-shaped specimen and a dedicated on-axis tomography holder to perform 180\u00b0 rotation of the sample inside the pole piece of the objective lens in TEM.

This inevitably results in the summation of a high dose of reactive electrons through the sample and the accompanying destruction of fine detail during recording. The technique of low-dose (minimal-dose) imaging is therefore regularly applied to mitigate this effect. Low-dose imaging is performed by deflecting illumination and imaging regions simultaneously away from the optical axis to image an adjacent region to the area to be recorded (the high-dose region). This area is maintained centered during tilting and refocused before recording. During recording the deflections are removed so that the area of interest is exposed to the electron beam only for the duration required for imaging. An improvement of this technique (for objects resting on a sloping substrate film) is to have two symmetrical off-axis regions for focusing followed by setting focus to the average of the two high-dose focus values before recording the low-dose area of interest.\n\nNon-tomographic variants on this method, referred to as [[single particle analysis]], use images of multiple (hopefully) identical objects at different orientations to produce the image data required for three-dimensional reconstruction. If the objects do not have significant preferred orientations, this method does not suffer from the missing data wedge (or cone) which accompany tomographic methods nor does it incur excessive radiation dosage, however it assumes that the different objects imaged can be treated as if the 3D data generated from them arose from a single stable object.\n\n==Sample preparation==\n[[File:Resin-Embedded Transmission Electron Microscope Sample.jpg|thumb|A sample of cells (black) stained with osmium tetroxide and uranyl acetate embedded in epoxy resin (amber) ready for sectioning.]]\nSample preparation in TEM can be a complex procedure.<ref name=Cheville>{{cite journal|last=Cheville|first=NF|author2=Stasko J |title=Techniques in Electron Microscopy of Animal Tissue|journal=Veterinary Pathology|year=2014|volume=51|issue=1|pages=28\u201341|doi=10.1177/0300985813505114|pmid=24114311}}</ref>  TEM specimens should be less than 100 nanometers thick for a conventional TEM.

Biological specimens may be embedded in resin to withstand the high vacuum in the sample chamber and to enable cutting tissue into electron transparent thin sections. The biological sample can be stained using either a [[negative stain]]ing material such as [[uranyl acetate]] for bacteria and viruses, or, in the case of embedded sections, the specimen may be stained with heavy metals, including osmium tetroxide. Alternately samples may be held at [[liquid nitrogen]] temperatures after embedding in vitreous ice.<ref>{{cite journal |title=3D reconstruction and comparison of shapes of DNA minicircles observed by cryo-electron microscopy|journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=34 |issue=18 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkl675 |first1=Arnaud |last1=Amzallag |first2=C\u00e9dric |last2=Vaillant |first3=Mathews |last3=Jacob |first4=Michael |last4=Unser |first5=Jan |last5=Bednar |first6=Jason D. |last6=Kahn |first7=Jacques |last7=Dubochet |first8=Andrzej |last8=Stasiak |first9=John H. |last9=Maddocks |year=2006 |pages=e125 |pmid=17012274 |pmc=1635295  }}</ref> In material science and metallurgy the specimens can usually withstand the high vacuum, but still must be prepared as a thin foil, or etched so some portion of the specimen is thin enough for the beam to penetrate.

The scale bar is 200&nbsp;nm.]]\nTEM samples of biological tissues need high atomic number stains to enhance contrast. The stain absorbs the beam electrons or scatters part of the electron beam which otherwise is projected onto the imaging system. Compounds of [[heavy metals]] such as [[osmium]], [[lead]], [[uranium]] or [[gold]] (in [[immunogold labelling]]) may be used prior to TEM observation to selectively deposit electron dense atoms in or on the sample in desired cellular or protein region. This process requires an understanding of how heavy metals bind to specific biological tissues and cellular structures.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alberts |first=Bruce |title=Molecular biology of the cell|year=2008|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York|isbn=978-0815341116|edition=5th}}</ref>\n\n===Mechanical milling===\nMechanical polishing is also used to prepare samples for imaging on the TEM. Polishing needs to be done to a high quality, to ensure constant sample thickness across the region of interest. A diamond, or [[cubic boron nitride]] polishing compound may be used in the final stages of polishing to remove any scratches that may cause contrast fluctuations due to varying sample thickness. Even after careful mechanical milling, additional fine methods such as ion etching may be required to perform final stage thinning.\n\n===Chemical etching===\n{{Main|Chemical milling}}\nCertain samples may be prepared by chemical etching, particularly metallic specimens. These samples are thinned using a chemical etchant, such as an acid, to prepare the sample for TEM observation. Devices to control the thinning process may allow the operator to control either the voltage or current passing through the specimen, and may include systems to detect when the sample has been thinned to a sufficient level of optical transparency.\n\n===Ion etching===\n{{Main|Sputtering}}\nIon etching is a sputtering process that can remove very fine quantities of material. This is used to perform a finishing polish of specimens polished by other means. Ion etching uses an inert gas passed through an electric field to generate a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] stream that is directed to the sample surface. Acceleration energies for gases such as argon are typically a few kilovolts. The sample may be rotated to promote even polishing of the sample surface. The sputtering rate of such methods is on the order of tens of micrometers per hour, limiting the method to only extremely fine polishing.\n\nIon etching by argon gas has been recently shown to be able to file down [[Magnetic tunnel junction|MTJ]] stack structures to a specific layer which has then been atomically resolved. The TEM images taken in plan view rather than cross-section reveal that the MgO layer within MTJs contains a large number of grain boundaries that may be diminishing the properties of devices.<ref>Bean, J.

The thin membrane shown here is suitable for TEM examination; however, at ~300-nm thickness, it would not be suitable for high-resolution TEM without further milling.]]\n\nMore recently [[focused ion beam]] methods have been used to prepare samples. FIB is a relatively new technique to prepare thin samples for TEM examination from larger specimens. Because FIB can be used to micro-machine samples very precisely, it is possible to mill very thin membranes from a specific area of interest in a sample, such as a semiconductor or metal. Unlike inert gas ion sputtering, FIB makes use of significantly more energetic gallium ions and may alter the composition or structure of the material through gallium implantation.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Microscopy|title=Quantitative HRTEM analysis of FIB prepared specimens|pages=395\u201305 |volume=232|issue=3|year = 2008|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2818.2008.02134.x|author1=Baram, M.  |author2=Kaplan W.

Variations of the replica technique are used for both materials and biological samples. In materials science a common use is for examining the fresh fracture surface of metal alloys.\n\n==Modifications==\nThe capabilities of the TEM can be further extended by additional stages and detectors, sometimes incorporated on the same microscope.\n\n===Scanning TEM===\nA TEM can be modified into a [[scanning transmission electron microscope]] (STEM) by the addition of a system that rasters a convergent beam across the sample to form the image, when combined with suitable detectors. Scanning coils are used to deflect the beam, such as by an electrostatic shift of the beam, where the beam is then collected using a current detector such as a [[Faraday cup]], which acts as a direct electron counter. By correlating the electron count to the position of the scanning beam (known as the \"probe\"), the transmitted component of the beam may be measured. The non-transmitted components may be obtained either by beam tilting or by the use of [[Annular dark-field imaging|annular dark field]] detectors.\n[[File:Schematic wiki2.jpg|thumb|424x424px|Schematic ray diagram illustrating the optical reciprocity between TEM (left) and STEM (right).

A STEM is a TEM in which the electron source and observation point have been switched relative to the direction of travel of the electron beam. See the ray diagrams in the figure on the right. The STEM instrument effectively relies on the same optical set-up as a TEM, but operates by flipping the direction of travel of the electrons (or reversing time) during operation of a TEM. Rather than using an aperture to control detected electrons, as in TEM, a STEM uses various detectors with collection angles that may be adjusted depending on which electrons the user wants to capture.\n\n===Low-voltage electron microscope===\nA [[low-voltage electron microscope]] (LVEM) is operated at relatively low electron accelerating voltage between 5\u201325 kV. Some of these can be a  combination of SEM, TEM and STEM in a single compact instrument. Low voltage increases image contrast which is especially important for biological specimens. This increase in contrast significantly reduces, or even eliminates the need to stain. Resolutions of a few nm are possible in TEM, SEM and STEM modes. The low energy of the electron beam means that permanent magnets can be used as lenses and thus a miniature column that does not require cooling can be used.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Nebes\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e11|first=Jana |author2=Vancov\u00e1, Marie |year=2007 |title=How to Observe Small Biological Objects in Low-Voltage Electron Microscope |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&fid=1330184&jid=MAM&volumeId=13&issueId=S03&aid=1330180 |accessdate=8 August 2016 |journal=Microscopy and Microanalysis |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=248\u2013249 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Drummy |first=Lawrence, F.|author2=Yang, Junyan |author3=Martin, David C. |year=2004 |title=Low-voltage electron microscopy of polymer and organic molecular thin films |journal=Ultramicroscopy |volume=99 |pages=247\u2013256 |doi=10.1016/j.ultramic.2004.01.011 |pmid=15149719 |issue=4}}</ref>\n\n===Cryo-TEM===\n[[Transmission electron cryomicroscopy|Main article: Transmission electron cryomicroscopy]]\n\nCryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) uses a TEM with a specimen holder capable of maintaining the specimen at [[liquid nitrogen]] or [[liquid helium]] temperatures.

Many materials require extensive sample preparation to produce a sample thin enough to be electron transparent, which makes TEM analysis a relatively time-consuming process with a low throughput of samples. The structure of the sample may also be changed during the preparation process. Also the field of view is relatively small, raising the possibility that the region analyzed may not be characteristic of the whole sample. There is potential that the sample may be damaged by the electron beam, particularly in the case of biological materials.\n\n===Resolution limits===\n[[File:MicroscopyResolution.png|thumb|Evolution of spatial resolution achieved with optical, transmission (TEM) and aberration-corrected electron microscopes (ACTEM).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1557/mrs2006.4|url=http://web.pdx.edu/~pmoeck/pennycooks%20aberration%20corrected%20microscopes.pdf|title=Materials Advances through Aberration-Corrected Electron Microscopy|journal=MRS Bulletin|volume=31|pages=36\u201343|year=2011|last1=Pennycook|first1=S.J.|last2=Varela|first2=M.|last3=Hetherington|first3=C.J.D.|last4=Kirkland|first4=A.I.}}</ref>]]\n{{See also|Transmission Electron Aberration-Corrected Microscope}}\nThe limit of resolution obtainable in a TEM may be described in several ways, and is typically referred to as the information limit of the microscope.

The specimen is most often an ultrathin section less than 100&nbsp;nm thick or a suspension on a grid. An image is formed from the interaction of the electrons with the sample as the beam is transmitted through the specimen. The image is then magnified and [[Focus (optics)|focused]] onto an imaging device, such as a [[fluorescent]] screen, a layer of [[photographic film]], or a sensor such as a scintillator attached to a [[charge-coupled device]].\n\nTransmission electron microscopes are capable of imaging at a significantly higher [[Optical resolution|resolution]] than [[Optical microscope|light microscopes]], owing to the smaller [[de Broglie wavelength]] of electrons. This enables the instrument to capture fine detail\u2014even as small as a single column of atoms, which is thousands of times smaller than a resolvable object seen in a light microscope. Transmission electron microscopy is a major analytical method in the physical, chemical and biological sciences. TEMs find application in [[cancer research]], [[virology]], and [[materials science]] as well as [[pollution]], [[nanotechnology]] and [[semiconductor]] research, but also in other fields such as [[paleontology]] and [[palynology]].\n\nTEM instruments boast an enormous array of operating modes including conventional imaging, scanning TEM imaging (STEM), diffraction, spectroscopy, and combinations of these. Even within conventional imaging, there are many fundamentally different ways that contrast is produced, called \"image contrast mechanisms.\" Contrast can arise from position-to-position differences in the thickness or density (\"mass-thickness contrast\"), atomic number (\"Z contrast,\" referring to the common abbreviation Z for atomic number), crystal structure or orientation (\"crystallographic contrast\" or \"diffraction contrast\"), the slight quantum-mechanical phase shifts that individual atoms produce in electrons that pass through them (\"phase contrast\"), the energy lost by electrons on passing through the sample (\"spectrum imaging\") and more. Each mechanism tells the user a different kind of information, depending not only on the contrast mechanism but on how the microscope is used\u2014the settings of lenses, apertures, and detectors. What this means is that a TEM is capable of returning an extraordinary variety of nanometer- and atomic-resolution information, in ideal cases revealing not only where all the atoms are but what kinds of atoms they are and how they are bonded to each other. For this reason TEM is regarded as an essential tool for nanoscience in both biological and materials fields.\n\nThe first TEM was demonstrated by [[Max Knoll]] and [[Ernst Ruska]] in 1931, with this group developing the first TEM with resolution greater than that of light in 1933 and the first commercial TEM in 1939. In 1986, Ruska was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for the development of transmission electron microscopy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History==\n<!-- This section uses {{cite book|title=The Early Development of Electron Lenses and Electron Microscopy|author1=Ernst Ruska |author2=translation by T Mulvey |isbn=3-7776-0364-3}} as a reference.

The research team worked on lens design and CRO column placement, to optimize parameters to construct better CROs, and make electron optical components to generate low magnification (nearly 1:1) images. In 1931, the group successfully generated magnified images of mesh grids placed over the anode aperture. The device used two magnetic lenses to achieve higher magnifications, arguably creating the first electron microscope.

In April 1932, Ruska suggested the construction of a new electron microscope for direct imaging of specimens inserted into the microscope, rather than simple mesh grids or images of apertures. With this device successful [[diffraction]] and normal imaging of an aluminium sheet was achieved. However the magnification achievable was lower than with light microscopy.

The wavelength of electrons is related to their kinetic energy via the de Broglie equation, which says that the wavelength is inversely proportional to the momentum. Taking into account relativistic effects (as in a TEM an electron's velocity is a substantial fraction of the speed of light,&nbsp;''c''<ref>{{cite book|title=Electron Diffraction in the Transmission Electron Microscope|author=Champness, P.

A field emission source uses instead electrostatic electrodes called an extractor, a suppressor, and a gun lens, with different voltages on each, to control the electric field shape and intensity near the sharp tip. The combination of the cathode and these first electrostatic lens elements is often collectively called the \"electron gun.\" After it leaves the gun, the beam is typically accelerated by a series of electrostatic plates until it reaches its final voltage and enters the next part of the microscope: The condenser lens system.

The interaction of electrons with a magnetic field will cause electrons to move according to the [[left hand rule]], thus allowing for [[electromagnet]]s to manipulate the electron beam. The use of magnetic fields allows for the formation of a magnetic lens of variable focusing power, the lens shape originating due to the distribution of magnetic flux. Additionally, [[electrostatic field]]s can cause the electrons to be deflected through a constant angle. Coupling of two deflections in opposing directions with a small intermediate gap allows for the formation of a shift in the beam path, allowing for beam shifting in TEM, which is important for [[Scanning transmission electron microscope|STEM]]. From these two effects, as well as the use of an electron imaging system, sufficient control over the beam path is possible for TEM operation. The optical configuration of a TEM can be rapidly changed, unlike that for an optical microscope, as lenses in the beam path can be enabled, have their strength changed, or be disabled entirely simply via rapid electrical switching, the speed of which is limited by effects such as the magnetic hysteresis of the lenses.\n\n===Optics===\nThe lenses of a TEM are what gives it its flexibility of operating modes and ability to focus beams down to the atomic scale and magnify them back up to get an image on a camera. A lens is usually made of a solenoid coil nearly surrounded by ferromagnetic materials designed to concentrate the coil's magnetic field into a precise, confined shape. When an electron enters and leaves this magnetic field, it spirals around the curved magnetic field lines in a way that acts very much as an ordinary glass lens does for light\u2014it is a converging lens. But, unlike a glass lens, a magnetic lens can very easily change its focusing power simply by adjusting the current passing through the coils. This provides a flexibility of operation that gets further multiplied when the lenses are assembled into stacks of independent lenses, each of which can focus, defocus, magnify, and/or collimate the beam coming from the previous lens. This allows a single lens system, between the source and the sample (the \"condenser lens\" system) to produce a parallel beam over 1 millimeter in diameter, a tightly focused beam smaller than an atom, or anything in between. An additional lens stack, the \"intermediate/projector\" lens system, is after the sample. It can be adjusted to produce a focused diffraction pattern or image of the sample with a magnification varying over a huge range. Many single microscopes can cover the magnification range from roughly 100X to more than 1,000,000X.\n\nEqually important to the lenses are the apertures. These are circular holes in thin strips of heavy metal, placed at well-chosen points in the column of lenses. Some are fixed in size and position and play important roles in limiting x-ray generation and improving the vacuum performance. They also prevent electrons from passing through the outermost parts of the magnetic lenses which, due to large lens aberrations, focus the electron beams extremely poorly. Others can be freely switched among several different sizes and have their positions adjusted. These \"variable apertures\" are used to determine the beam current reaching the sample and also to improve the ability to focus the beam. Variable apertures after the sample position further allow the user to select the range of spatial positions or electron scattering angles to be used in the formation of an image or a diffraction pattern. Skillfully used, these apertures allow remarkably precise and detailed study of the defects in crystals.\n\nThe electron-optical system also includes deflectors and stigmators, usually made of small electromagnets. Unlike the lenses, the magnetic fields produced by the deflectors are oriented primarily to deflect the beam and not to focus it. The deflectors allow the position and angle of the beam at the sample position to be independently controlled (as is essential for STEM) and also ensure that the beams remain near the low-aberration centers of every lens in the lens stacks. The stigmators provide an auxiliary fine focusing, compensating for slight imperfections and aberrations that cause astigmatism\u2014a lens having a different focal strength in different directions.\n\nTypically a TEM consists of three stages of lensing. The stages are the condenser lenses, the objective lenses, and the projector lenses. The condenser lenses are responsible for primary beam formation, while the objective lenses focus the beam that comes through the sample itself (in STEM scanning mode, there are also objective lenses above the sample to make the incident electron beam convergent). The projector lenses are used to expand the beam onto the phosphor screen or other imaging device, such as film. The magnification of the TEM is due to the ratio of the distances between the specimen and the objective lens' image plane.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rodenburg.org/guide/t700.html|title=The objective lens of a TEM, the heart of the electron microscope|publisher=rodenburg.org}}</ref> Additional [[stigmator]]s allow for the correction of asymmetrical beam distortions, known as [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|astigmatism]]. It is noted that TEM optical configurations differ significantly with implementation, with manufacturers using custom lens configurations, such as in [[spherical aberration]] corrected instruments,<ref name=\"rose\" /> or TEMs using energy filtering to correct electron [[chromatic aberration]].\n\n==== Reciprocity ====\nThe optical reciprocity theorem, or principle of [[Helmholtz reciprocity]], generally holds true for [[Elastic scattering|elastically scattered]] electrons in an absorbing medium, as is often the case under standard TEM operating conditions.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Pogany|first=A.

The beam control is on the right (13 and 14)]]\nA TEM is composed of several components, which include a vacuum system in which the electrons travel, an electron emission source for generation of the electron stream, a series of electromagnetic lenses, as well as electrostatic plates. The latter two allow the operator to guide and manipulate the beam as required. Also required is a device to allow the insertion into, motion within, and removal of specimens from the beam path. Imaging devices are subsequently used to create an image from the electrons that exit the system.\n\n===Vacuum system===\nTo increase the [[mean free path]] of the electron gas interaction, a standard TEM is evacuated to low pressures, typically on the order of 10<sup>\u22124</sup> [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rodenburg.org/guide/t1400.html|title=The Vacuum System|author=Rodenburg, J M |publisher=rodenburg.org}}</ref> The need for this is twofold: first the allowance for the voltage difference between the cathode and the ground without generating an arc, and secondly to reduce the collision frequency of electrons with gas atoms to negligible levels\u2014this effect is characterized by the [[mean free path]]. TEM components such as specimen holders and film cartridges must be routinely inserted or replaced requiring a system with the ability to re-evacuate on a regular basis. As such, TEMs are equipped with multiple pumping systems and airlocks and are not permanently vacuum sealed.\n\nThe vacuum system for evacuating a TEM to an operating pressure level consists of several stages. Initially, a low or roughing vacuum is achieved with either a [[rotary vane pump]] or [[diaphragm pump]]s setting a sufficiently low pressure to allow the operation of a [[turbo-molecular pump|turbo-molecular]] or [[diffusion pump]] establishing high vacuum level necessary for operations. To allow for the low vacuum pump to not require continuous operation, while continually operating the turbo-molecular pumps, the vacuum side of a low-pressure pump may be connected to chambers which accommodate the exhaust gases from the turbo-molecular pump.<ref name=\"DykstraAndRoss\">{{cite book|title=Biological Electron Microscopy: Theory, techniques and troubleshooting|first=Dykstra, M|last=Ross, L.

For these very low pressures, either an [[ion pump]] or a [[getter]] material is used.\n\nPoor vacuum in a TEM can cause several problems ranging from the deposition of gas inside the TEM onto the specimen while viewed in a process known as [[electron beam induced deposition]] to more severe cathode damages caused by electrical discharge.<ref name=\"Chapman\"/> The use of a [[cold trap]] to [[adsorption|adsorb]] sublimated gases in the vicinity of the specimen largely eliminates vacuum problems that are caused by specimen [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]].<ref name=\"DykstraAndRoss\"/>\n\n===Specimen stage===\n[[File:Retino ME con sezioni.jpg|thumb|175px|right|TEM sample support mesh \"grid\", with [[ultramicrotomy]] sections]]\nTEM specimen stage designs include [[airlock]]s to allow for insertion of the specimen holder into the vacuum with minimal loss of vacuum in other areas of the microscope. The specimen holders hold a standard size of sample grid or self-supporting specimen. Standard TEM grid sizes are 3.05&nbsp;mm diameter, with a thickness and mesh size ranging from a few to 100&nbsp;\u03bcm. The sample is placed onto the meshed area having a diameter of approximately 2.5&nbsp;mm. Usual grid materials are copper, molybdenum, gold or platinum. This grid is placed into the sample holder, which is paired with the specimen stage. A wide variety of designs of stages and holders exist, depending upon the type of experiment being performed. In addition to 3.05&nbsp;mm grids, 2.3&nbsp;mm grids are sometimes, if rarely, used. These grids were particularly used in the mineral sciences where a large degree of tilt can be required and where specimen material may be extremely rare. Electron transparent specimens have a thickness usually less than 100&nbsp;nm, but this value depends on the accelerating voltage.\n\nOnce inserted into a TEM, the sample has to be manipulated to locate the region of interest to the beam, such as in single [[Crystallite|grain]] diffraction, in a specific orientation. To accommodate this, the TEM stage allows movement of the sample in the XY plane, Z height adjustment, and commonly a single tilt direction parallel to the axis of side entry holders. Sample rotation may be available on specialized diffraction holders and stages. Some modern TEMs provide the ability for two orthogonal tilt angles of movement with specialized holder designs called double-tilt sample holders. Some stage designs, such as top-entry or vertical insertion stages once common for high resolution TEM studies, may simply only have X-Y translation available. The design criteria of TEM stages are complex, owing to the simultaneous requirements of mechanical and electron-optical constraints and specialized models are available for different methods.\n\nA TEM stage is required to have the ability to hold a specimen and be manipulated to bring the region of interest into the path of the electron beam. As the TEM can operate over a wide range of magnifications, the stage must simultaneously be highly resistant to mechanical drift, with drift requirements as low as a few nm/minute while being able to move several \u03bcm/minute, with repositioning accuracy on the order of nanometers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Improving the Positional Accuracy of the Goniometer on the Philips CM Series TEM|journal=Journal of Structural Biology|pages=250\u2013256|volume=128|year=1999|doi=10.1006/jsbi.1999.4181|pmid=10633064|last1=Pulokas|first1=James|last2=Green|first2=Carmen|last3=Kisseberth|first3=Nick|last4=Potter|first4=Clinton S.|last5=Carragher|first5=Bridget|issue=3}}</ref> Earlier designs of TEM accomplished this with a complex set of mechanical downgearing devices, allowing the operator to finely control the motion of the stage by several rotating rods. Modern devices may use electrical stage designs, using screw gearing in concert with [[stepper motor]]s, providing the operator with a computer-based stage input, such as a [[joystick]] or [[trackball]].\n\nTwo main designs for stages in a TEM exist, the side-entry and top entry version.<ref name=\"WilliamsAndCarter_v1\"/> Each design must accommodate the matching holder to allow for specimen insertion without either damaging delicate TEM optics or allowing gas into TEM systems under vacuum.\n\n[[File:TEM-Single-tilt.svg|A diagram of a single axis tilt sample holder for insertion into a TEM goniometer. Titling of the holder is achieved by rotation of the entire goniometer|left|thumb|300px]] The most common is the side entry holder, where the specimen is placed near the tip of a long metal (brass or stainless steel) rod, with the specimen placed flat in a small bore. Along the rod are several polymer vacuum rings to allow for the formation of a vacuum seal of sufficient quality, when inserted into the stage. The stage is thus designed to accommodate the rod, placing the sample either in between or near the objective lens, dependent upon the objective design. When inserted into the stage, the side entry holder has its tip contained within the TEM vacuum, and the base is presented to atmosphere, the airlock formed by the vacuum rings.\n\nInsertion procedures for side-entry TEM holders typically involve the rotation of the sample to trigger [[micro switch]]es that initiate evacuation of the airlock before the sample is inserted into the TEM column.\n\nThe second design is the top-entry holder consists of a cartridge that is several cm long with a bore drilled down the cartridge axis. The specimen is loaded into the bore, possibly using a small screw ring to hold the sample in place. This cartridge is inserted into an airlock with the bore perpendicular to the TEM optic axis. When sealed, the airlock is manipulated to push the cartridge such that the cartridge falls into place, where the bore hole becomes aligned with the beam axis, such that the beam travels down the cartridge bore and into the specimen. Such designs are typically unable to be tilted without blocking the beam path or interfering with the objective lens.<ref name=\"WilliamsAndCarter_v1\"/>\n\n===Electron gun===\n[[File:Electron-gun.svg|right|thumb|275px|Cross sectional diagram of an electron gun assembly, illustrating electron extraction]]\n\n{{main|Electron gun}}\n\nThe electron gun is formed from several components: the filament, a biasing circuit, a Wehnelt cap, and an extraction anode. By connecting the filament to the negative component power supply, electrons can be \"pumped\" from the electron gun to the anode plate and the TEM column, thus completing the circuit. The gun is designed to create a beam of electrons exiting from the assembly at some given angle, known as the gun divergence semi-angle, \u03b1. By constructing the Wehnelt cylinder such that it has a higher negative charge than the filament itself, electrons that exit the filament in a diverging manner are, under proper operation, forced into a converging pattern the minimum size of which is the gun crossover diameter.\n\nThe thermionic emission current density, ''J'', can be related to the [[work function]] of the emitting material via [[Richardson's law]]\n:<math>J=AT^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Phi}{kT}\\right),</math>\nwhere ''A'' is the [[Owen Willans Richardson|Richardson's]] constant, \u03a6 is the work function and T is the temperature of the material.<ref name=\"WilliamsAndCarter_v1\"/>\n\nThis equation shows that in order to achieve sufficient current density it is necessary to heat the emitter, taking care not to cause damage by application of excessive heat. For this reason materials with either a high melting point, such as tungsten, or those with a low work function (LaB<sub>6</sub>) are required for the gun filament.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Thermionic emission properties of a lanthanum hexaboride/rhenium cathode|year=1965|journal=British Journal of Applied Physics|volume= 16|page=1821|author=Buckingham, J |bibcode = 1965BJAP...16.1821B |doi = 10.1088/0508-3443/16/12/306|issue=12 }}</ref> Furthermore, both lanthanum hexaboride and tungsten thermionic sources must be heated in order to achieve thermionic emission, this can be achieved by the use of a small resistive strip. To prevent thermal shock, there is often a delay enforced in the application of current to the tip, to prevent thermal gradients from damaging the filament, the delay is usually a few seconds for LaB<sub>6</sub>, and significantly lower for tungsten{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.\n\n===Electron lens===\n[[File:TEM-lens.svg|thumb|left|Diagram of a TEM split pole piece design lens]]\n\nElectron lenses are designed to act in a manner emulating that of an optical lens, by focusing parallel electrons at some constant focal distance. Electron lenses may operate electrostatically or magnetically. The majority of electron lenses for TEM use [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] coils to generate a [[convex lens]]. The field produced for the lens must be radially symmetrical, as deviation from the radial symmetry of the magnetic lens causes aberrations such as [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|astigmatism]], and worsens [[Spherical aberration|spherical]] and [[chromatic aberration]]. Electron lenses are manufactured from iron, iron-cobalt or nickel cobalt alloys,<ref name=\"HbCPO\">{{cite book|editor=Orloff, J|title=Handbook of Electron Optics|year=1997|publisher=CRC-press|isbn=978-0-8493-2513-7}}</ref> such as [[permalloy]]. These are selected for their magnetic properties, such as [[magnetic saturation]], [[magnetic hysteresis|hysteresis]] and [[magnetic permeability|permeability]].\n\nThe components include the yoke, the magnetic coil, the poles, the polepiece, and the external control circuitry. The pole piece must be manufactured in a very symmetrical manner, as this provides the [[boundary conditions]] for the magnetic field that forms the lens. Imperfections in the manufacture of the pole piece can induce severe distortions in the magnetic field symmetry, which induce distortions that will ultimately limit the lenses' ability to reproduce the object plane. The exact dimensions of the gap, pole piece internal diameter and taper, as well as the overall design of the lens is often performed by [[finite element analysis]] of the magnetic field, whilst considering the thermal and electrical constraints of the design.<ref name=\"HbCPO\"/>\n\nThe coils which produce the magnetic field are located within the lens yoke. The coils can contain a variable current, but typically use high voltages, and therefore require significant insulation in order to prevent short-circuiting the lens components. Thermal distributors are placed to ensure the extraction of the heat generated by the energy lost to resistance of the coil windings. The windings may be water-cooled, using a chilled water supply in order to facilitate the removal of the high thermal duty.\n\n===Apertures===\nApertures are annular metallic plates, through which electrons that are further than a fixed distance from the [[optic axis]] may be excluded. These consist of a small metallic disc that is sufficiently thick to prevent electrons from passing through the disc, whilst permitting axial electrons. This permission of central electrons in a TEM causes two effects simultaneously: firstly, apertures decrease the beam intensity as electrons are filtered from the beam, which may be desired in the case of beam sensitive samples. Secondly, this filtering removes electrons that are scattered to high angles, which may be due to unwanted processes such as spherical or chromatic aberration, or due to diffraction from interaction within the sample.<ref name=\"Reimer08\">{{cite book|title=Transmission Electron Microscopy: Physics of Image Formation|author=Reimer, L and Kohl, H|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-34758-5}}</ref>\n\nApertures are either a fixed aperture within the column, such as at the condenser lens, or are a movable aperture, which can be inserted or withdrawn from the beam path, or moved in the plane perpendicular to the beam path. Aperture assemblies are mechanical devices which allow for the selection of different aperture sizes, which may be used by the operator to trade off intensity and the filtering effect of the aperture. Aperture assemblies are often equipped with micrometers to move the aperture, required during optical calibration.\n\n==Imaging methods==\nImaging methods in TEM use the information contained in the electron waves exiting from the sample to form an image. The projector lenses allow for the correct positioning of this electron wave distribution onto the viewing system. The observed intensity, ''I'', of the image, assuming sufficiently high quality of imaging device, can be approximated as proportional to the time-averaged squared absolute value of the [[amplitude]] of the electron wavefunctions, where the wave that forms the exit beam is denoted by \u03a8.<ref name=\"Cowley\">{{cite book|author=Cowley, J. M|year=1995|title=Diffraction physics|publisher=Elsevier Science B. V.|isbn=978-0-444-82218-5}}</ref>\n\n:<math> I(x)= \\frac{k}{t_1-t_0} \\int^{t_1}_{t_0} \\Psi\\Psi^{\\mathrm{*}} \\, dt</math>\n\nDifferent imaging methods therefore attempt to modify the electron waves exiting the sample in a way that provides information about the sample, or the beam itself. From the previous equation, it can be deduced that the observed image depends not only on the amplitude of beam, but also on the phase of the electrons,{{clarify|date=December 2019|reason=How?}} although phase effects may often be ignored at lower magnifications. Higher resolution imaging requires thinner samples and higher energies of incident electrons, which means that the sample can no longer be considered to be absorbing electrons (i.e., via a Beer's law effect). Instead, the sample can be modeled as an object that does not change the amplitude of the incoming electron wave function, but instead modifies the phase of the incoming wave; in this model, the sample is known as a pure phase object. For sufficiently thin specimens, phase effects dominate the image, complicating analysis of the observed intensities.<ref name=\"Cowley\"/> To improve the contrast in the image, the TEM may be operated at a slight defocus to enhance contrast, owing to convolution by the [[optical transfer function|contrast transfer function]] of the TEM,<ref name=\"kirkland\"/> which would normally decrease contrast if the sample was not a weak phase object.\n[[File:Schematic view of imaging and diffraction modes in TEM.tif|thumb|Schematic view of imaging and diffraction modes in TEM.]]\n\nThe figure on the right shows the two basic operation modes of TEM \u2013 imaging and diffraction modes. In both cases the specimen is illuminated with the parallel beam, formed by electron beam shaping with the system of Condenser lenses and Condenser aperture. After interaction with the sample, on the exit surface of the specimen two types of electrons exist \u2013 unscattered (which will correspond to the bright central beam on the diffraction pattern) and scattered electrons (which change their trajectories due to interaction with the material).\n\nIn Imaging mode, the objective aperture is inserted in a back focal plane (BFP) of the objective lens (where diffraction spots are formed). If using the objective aperture to select only the central beam, the transmitted electrons are passed through the aperture while all others are blocked, and a bright field image (BF image) is obtained. If we allow the signal from a diffracted beam, a dark field image (DF image) is received. The selected signal is magnified and projected on a screen (or on a camera) with the help of Intermediate and Projector lenses. An image of the sample is thus obtained.\n\nIn Diffraction mode, a selected area aperture may be used to determine more precisely the specimen area from which the signal will be displayed. By changing the strength of current to the intermediate lens, the diffraction pattern is projected on a screen. Diffraction is a very powerful tool for doing a cell reconstruction and crystal orientation determination.\n\n===Contrast formation===\n\nThe contrast between two adjacent areas in a TEM image can be defined as the difference in the electron densities in image plane. Due to the scattering of the incident beam by the sample, the amplitude and phase of the electron wave change, which results in '''''amplitude contrast''''' and '''''phase contrast''''', correspondingly. Most of images have both contrast components.\n\n'''Amplitude\u2013contrast''' is obtained due to removal of some electrons before the image plane. During their interaction with the specimen some of electrons will be lost due to absorption, or due to scattering at very high angles beyond the physical limitation of microscope or are blocked by the objective aperture. While the first two losses are due to the specimen and microscope construction, the objective aperture can be used by operator to enhance the contrast.\n\n[[File:TEM image of Pt polycrystalline film and correspondent diffraction pattern.tif|thumb|BF and DF contrast demonstration. TEM image of polycrystalline Pt film]]\n\nFigure on the right shows a TEM image (a) and the corresponding diffraction pattern (b) of Pt polycrystalline film taken without an objective aperture. In order to enhance the contrast in the TEM image the number of scattered beams as visible in the diffraction pattern should be reduced. This can be done by selecting a certain area in the back focal plane such as only the central beam or a specific diffracted beam (angle), or combinations of such beams. By intentionally selecting an objective aperture which only permits the non-diffracted beam to pass beyond the back focal plane (and onto the image plane): one creates a Bright-Field (BF) image BF, whereas if the central, non-diffracted beam is blocked: one may obtain Dark-Field (DF) images such as those shown in (d-e). The DF images (d-e) were obtained by selecting the diffracted beams indicated in diffraction pattern with circles (b) using an aperture at the back focal plane. Grains from which electrons are scattered into these diffraction spots appear brighter. More details about diffraction contrast formation are given further.\n\nThere are two types of amplitude contrast \u2013 mass\u2013thickness and diffraction contrast. First, let's consider '''''mass\u2013thickness contrast'''''. When the beam illuminates two neighbouring areas with low mass (or thickness) and high mass (or thickness), the heavier region scatters electrons at bigger angles. These strongly scattered electrons are blocked in BF TEM mode by objective aperture. As a result, heavier regions appear darker in BF images (have low intensity). Mass\u2013thickness contrast is most important for non\u2013crystalline, amorphous materials.\n\n'''''Diffraction contrast''''' occurs due to a specific crystallographic orientation of a grain. In such a case the crystal is in a so-called Bragg condition, whereby atomic planes are oriented in a way that there is a high probability of scattering. Thus diffraction contrast provides information on the orientation of the crystals in a polycrystalline sample. Note that in case diffraction contrast exists, the contrast cannot be interpreted as due to mass or thickness variations.\n\n====Diffraction contrast====\n{{Main|Electron diffraction}}\n[[Image:TEM micrograph dislocations precipitate stainless steel 1.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Transmission electron micrograph of [[dislocation]]s in steel, which are faults in the structure of the crystal lattice at the atomic scale]]\nSamples can exhibit diffraction contrast, whereby the electron beam undergoes [[Bragg scattering]], which in the case of a crystalline sample, disperses electrons into discrete locations in the [[back focal plane]]. By the placement of apertures in the back focal plane, i.e. the objective aperture, the desired Bragg reflections can be selected (or excluded), thus only parts of the sample that are causing the electrons to scatter to the selected reflections will end up projected onto the imaging apparatus.\n\nIf the reflections that are selected do not include the unscattered beam (which will appear up at the focal point of the lens), then the image will appear dark wherever no sample scattering to the selected peak is present, as such a region without a specimen will appear dark. This is known as a dark-field image.\n\nModern TEMs are often equipped with specimen holders that allow the user to tilt the specimen to a range of angles in order to obtain specific diffraction conditions, and apertures placed above the specimen allow the user to select electrons that would otherwise be diffracted in a particular direction from entering the specimen.\n\nApplications for this method include the identification of [[lattice defect]]s in crystals. By carefully selecting the orientation of the sample, it is possible not just to determine the position of defects but also to determine the type of defect present. If the sample is oriented so that one particular plane is only slightly tilted away from the strongest diffracting angle (known as the [[Bragg diffraction|Bragg Angle]]), any distortion of the crystal plane that locally tilts the plane to the Bragg angle will produce particularly strong contrast variations. However, defects that produce only displacement of atoms that do not tilt the crystal to the Bragg angle (i. e. displacements parallel to the crystal plane) will not produce strong contrast.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Hull, D.  |author2=Bacon, J |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Introduction to dislocations|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2001|edition=4th |isbn=978-0-7506-4681-9}}</ref>\n\n====Phase contrast====\n{{Main|High-resolution transmission electron microscopy}}\n\nCrystal structure can also be investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), also known as [[phase contrast]]. When using a field emission source and a specimen of uniform thickness, the images are formed due to differences in phase of electron waves, which is caused by specimen interaction.<ref name=\"kirkland\">{{cite book|title=Advanced computing in Electron Microscopy|author=Kirkland, E|publisher=Springer|year=1998|isbn=978-0-306-45936-8}}</ref> Image formation is given by the complex modulus of the incoming electron beams. As such, the image is not only dependent on the number of electrons hitting the screen, making direct interpretation of phase contrast images more complex. However this effect can be used to an advantage, as it can be manipulated to provide more information about the sample, such as in complex [[phase retrieval]] techniques.\n\n===Diffraction===\n{{Main|Selected area diffraction}}\n[[Image:Austenite ZADP.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Crystalline diffraction pattern from a twinned grain of FCC Austenitic steel]]\n\nAs previously stated, by adjusting the magnetic lenses such that the back focal plane of the lens rather than the imaging plane is placed on the imaging apparatus a [[diffraction pattern]] can be generated. For thin crystalline samples, this produces an image that consists of a pattern of dots in the case of a single crystal, or a series of rings in the case of a [[polycrystalline]] or [[amorphous|amorphous solid]] material. For the single crystal case the diffraction pattern is dependent upon the orientation of the specimen and the structure of the sample illuminated by the electron beam. This image provides the investigator with information about the [[space group]] symmetries in the crystal and the crystal's orientation to the beam path. This is typically done without using any information but the position at which the diffraction spots appear and the observed image symmetries.\n\nDiffraction patterns can have a large dynamic range, and for crystalline samples, may have intensities greater than those recordable by CCD. As such, TEMs may still be equipped with film cartridges for the purpose of obtaining these images, as the film is a single use detector.\n\n[[Image:KikuchiLines2.png|thumb|right|175px|Convergent-beam Kikuchi lines from silicon, near the [100] [[Miller index|zone axis]]]]\nAnalysis of diffraction patterns beyond point-position can be complex, as the image is sensitive to a number of factors such as specimen thickness and orientation, objective lens defocus, and spherical and chromatic aberration. Although quantitative interpretation of the contrast shown in lattice images is possible, it is inherently complicated and can require extensive computer simulation and analysis, such as [[multislice|electron multislice]] analysis.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Scattering of Electrons by Atoms and Crystals.

In [[convergent beam electron diffraction]] (CBED) where a non-parallel, i.e. converging, electron wavefront is produced by concentrating the electron beam into a fine probe at the sample surface, the interaction of the convergent beam can provide information beyond structural data such as sample thickness.\n\n====Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)====\n{{Main|Electron energy loss spectroscopy}}\nUsing the advanced technique of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), for TEMs appropriately equipped, electrons can be separated into a spectrum based upon their velocity (which is closely related to their kinetic energy, and thus energy loss from the beam energy), using [[magnetic sector]] based devices known as EEL spectrometers. These devices allow for the selection of particular energy values, which can be associated with the way the electron has interacted with the sample. For example, different elements in a sample result in different electron energies in the beam after the sample. This normally results in chromatic aberration \u2013 however this effect can, for example, be used to generate an image which provides information on elemental composition, based upon the atomic transition during electron-electron interaction.<ref>{{cite book|author=Egerton, R. F.|title=Electron Energy-loss Spectroscopy in the Electron Microscope|year=1996|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-45223-9}}</ref>\n\nEELS spectrometers can often be operated in both spectroscopic and imaging modes, allowing for isolation or rejection of [[elastic scattering|elastically scattered]] beams. As for many images inelastic scattering will include information that may not be of interest to the investigator thus reducing observable signals of interest, EELS imaging can be used to enhance contrast in observed images, including both bright field and diffraction, by rejecting unwanted components.\n\n===Three-dimensional imaging===\n[[File:TEM-parapoxvirus-tomograph.ogv|thumb|left|225px|A three-dimensional TEM image of a parapoxvirus<ref>{{cite journal|title=Electron tomography of negatively stained complex viruses: application in their diagnosis|volume=4|year=2009|pmid=19208223|doi=10.1186/1746-1596-4-5|journal=Diagnostic Pathology|page=5|pmc=2649040|last1=Mast|first1=Jan|last2=Demeestere|first2=Lien}}</ref>]]\nAs TEM specimen holders typically allow for the rotation of a sample by a desired angle, multiple views of the same specimen can be obtained by rotating the angle of the sample along an axis perpendicular to the beam. By taking multiple images of a single TEM sample at differing angles, typically in 1\u00b0 increments, a set of images known as a \"tilt series\" can be collected. This methodology was proposed in the 1970s by [[Walter Hoppe]]. Under purely absorption contrast conditions, this set of images can be used to construct a three-dimensional representation of the sample.<ref name=\"Frank\">{{cite book|editor=Frank, J |title=Electron tomography: methods for three-dimensional visualization of structures in the cell|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-31234-7|year=2006}}</ref>\n\nThe reconstruction is accomplished by a two-step process, first images are aligned to account for errors in the positioning of a sample; such errors can occur due to vibration or mechanical drift.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Levin, B.

Secondly, using a reconstruction algorithm, such as [[filtered back projection]], the aligned image slices can be transformed from a set of two-dimensional images, ''I''<sub>''j''</sub>(''x'',&nbsp;''y''), to a single three-dimensional image, ''I''<nowiki>'</nowiki><sub>''j''</sub>(''x'',&nbsp;''y'',&nbsp;''z''). This three-dimensional image is of particular interest when morphological information is required, further study can be undertaken using computer algorithms, such as [[isosurface]]s and data slicing to analyse the data.\n\nAs TEM samples cannot typically be viewed at a full 180\u00b0 rotation, the observed images typically suffer from a \"missing wedge\" of data, which when using [[Projection-slice theorem|Fourier-based back projection]] methods decreases the range of resolvable frequencies in the three-dimensional reconstruction.<ref name=\"Frank\"/> Mechanical refinements, such as multi-axis tilting (two tilt series of the same specimen made at orthogonal directions) and conical tomography (where the specimen is first tilted to a given fixed angle and then imaged at equal angular rotational increments through one complete rotation in the plane of the specimen grid) can be used to limit the impact of the missing data on the observed specimen morphology. Using [[focused ion beam]] milling, a new technique has been proposed<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kawase |first=Noboru |author2=Kato, Mitsuro  |author3=Jinnai, Hiroshi |year=2007 |title=Transmission electron microtomography without the 'missing wedge' for quantitative structural analysis |journal=Ultramicroscopy |volume=107 |issue=1 |pages=8\u201315 |doi=10.1016/j.ultramic.2006.04.007 |pmid=16730409|last4=Jinnai |first4=H }}</ref> which uses pillar-shaped specimen and a dedicated on-axis tomography holder to perform 180\u00b0 rotation of the sample inside the pole piece of the objective lens in TEM.

This inevitably results in the summation of a high dose of reactive electrons through the sample and the accompanying destruction of fine detail during recording. The technique of low-dose (minimal-dose) imaging is therefore regularly applied to mitigate this effect. Low-dose imaging is performed by deflecting illumination and imaging regions simultaneously away from the optical axis to image an adjacent region to the area to be recorded (the high-dose region). This area is maintained centered during tilting and refocused before recording. During recording the deflections are removed so that the area of interest is exposed to the electron beam only for the duration required for imaging. An improvement of this technique (for objects resting on a sloping substrate film) is to have two symmetrical off-axis regions for focusing followed by setting focus to the average of the two high-dose focus values before recording the low-dose area of interest.\n\nNon-tomographic variants on this method, referred to as [[single particle analysis]], use images of multiple (hopefully) identical objects at different orientations to produce the image data required for three-dimensional reconstruction. If the objects do not have significant preferred orientations, this method does not suffer from the missing data wedge (or cone) which accompany tomographic methods nor does it incur excessive radiation dosage, however it assumes that the different objects imaged can be treated as if the 3D data generated from them arose from a single stable object.\n\n==Sample preparation==\n[[File:Resin-Embedded Transmission Electron Microscope Sample.jpg|thumb|A sample of cells (black) stained with osmium tetroxide and uranyl acetate embedded in epoxy resin (amber) ready for sectioning.]]\nSample preparation in TEM can be a complex procedure.<ref name=Cheville>{{cite journal|last=Cheville|first=NF|author2=Stasko J |title=Techniques in Electron Microscopy of Animal Tissue|journal=Veterinary Pathology|year=2014|volume=51|issue=1|pages=28\u201341|doi=10.1177/0300985813505114|pmid=24114311}}</ref>  TEM specimens should be less than 100 nanometers thick for a conventional TEM.

Biological specimens may be embedded in resin to withstand the high vacuum in the sample chamber and to enable cutting tissue into electron transparent thin sections. The biological sample can be stained using either a [[negative stain]]ing material such as [[uranyl acetate]] for bacteria and viruses, or, in the case of embedded sections, the specimen may be stained with heavy metals, including osmium tetroxide.

The stain absorbs the beam electrons or scatters part of the electron beam which otherwise is projected onto the imaging system. Compounds of [[heavy metals]] such as [[osmium]], [[lead]], [[uranium]] or [[gold]] (in [[immunogold labelling]]) may be used prior to TEM observation to selectively deposit electron dense atoms in or on the sample in desired cellular or protein region.

Polishing needs to be done to a high quality, to ensure constant sample thickness across the region of interest. A diamond, or [[cubic boron nitride]] polishing compound may be used in the final stages of polishing to remove any scratches that may cause contrast fluctuations due to varying sample thickness. Even after careful mechanical milling, additional fine methods such as ion etching may be required to perform final stage thinning.\n\n===Chemical etching===\n{{Main|Chemical milling}}\nCertain samples may be prepared by chemical etching, particularly metallic specimens. These samples are thinned using a chemical etchant, such as an acid, to prepare the sample for TEM observation. Devices to control the thinning process may allow the operator to control either the voltage or current passing through the specimen, and may include systems to detect when the sample has been thinned to a sufficient level of optical transparency.\n\n===Ion etching===\n{{Main|Sputtering}}\nIon etching is a sputtering process that can remove very fine quantities of material. This is used to perform a finishing polish of specimens polished by other means. Ion etching uses an inert gas passed through an electric field to generate a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] stream that is directed to the sample surface. Acceleration energies for gases such as argon are typically a few kilovolts. The sample may be rotated to promote even polishing of the sample surface. The sputtering rate of such methods is on the order of tens of micrometers per hour, limiting the method to only extremely fine polishing.\n\nIon etching by argon gas has been recently shown to be able to file down [[Magnetic tunnel junction|MTJ]] stack structures to a specific layer which has then been atomically resolved. The TEM images taken in plan view rather than cross-section reveal that the MgO layer within MTJs contains a large number of grain boundaries that may be diminishing the properties of devices.<ref>Bean, J.

FIB is a relatively new technique to prepare thin samples for TEM examination from larger specimens. Because FIB can be used to micro-machine samples very precisely, it is possible to mill very thin membranes from a specific area of interest in a sample, such as a semiconductor or metal.

Variations of the replica technique are used for both materials and biological samples. In materials science a common use is for examining the fresh fracture surface of metal alloys.\n\n==Modifications==\nThe capabilities of the TEM can be further extended by additional stages and detectors, sometimes incorporated on the same microscope.\n\n===Scanning TEM===\nA TEM can be modified into a [[scanning transmission electron microscope]] (STEM) by the addition of a system that rasters a convergent beam across the sample to form the image, when combined with suitable detectors. Scanning coils are used to deflect the beam, such as by an electrostatic shift of the beam, where the beam is then collected using a current detector such as a [[Faraday cup]], which acts as a direct electron counter. By correlating the electron count to the position of the scanning beam (known as the \"probe\"), the transmitted component of the beam may be measured. The non-transmitted components may be obtained either by beam tilting or by the use of [[Annular dark-field imaging|annular dark field]] detectors.\n[[File:Schematic wiki2.jpg|thumb|424x424px|Schematic ray diagram illustrating the optical reciprocity between TEM (left) and STEM (right).

A STEM is a TEM in which the electron source and observation point have been switched relative to the direction of travel of the electron beam. See the ray diagrams in the figure on the right. The STEM instrument effectively relies on the same optical set-up as a TEM, but operates by flipping the direction of travel of the electrons (or reversing time) during operation of a TEM. Rather than using an aperture to control detected electrons, as in TEM, a STEM uses various detectors with collection angles that may be adjusted depending on which electrons the user wants to capture.\n\n===Low-voltage electron microscope===\nA [[low-voltage electron microscope]] (LVEM) is operated at relatively low electron accelerating voltage between 5\u201325 kV. Some of these can be a  combination of SEM, TEM and STEM in a single compact instrument. Low voltage increases image contrast which is especially important for biological specimens. This increase in contrast significantly reduces, or even eliminates the need to stain. Resolutions of a few nm are possible in TEM, SEM and STEM modes. The low energy of the electron beam means that permanent magnets can be used as lenses and thus a miniature column that does not require cooling can be used.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Nebes\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e11|first=Jana |author2=Vancov\u00e1, Marie |year=2007 |title=How to Observe Small Biological Objects in Low-Voltage Electron Microscope |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&fid=1330184&jid=MAM&volumeId=13&issueId=S03&aid=1330180 |accessdate=8 August 2016 |journal=Microscopy and Microanalysis |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=248\u2013249 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Drummy |first=Lawrence, F.|author2=Yang, Junyan |author3=Martin, David C. |year=2004 |title=Low-voltage electron microscopy of polymer and organic molecular thin films |journal=Ultramicroscopy |volume=99 |pages=247\u2013256 |doi=10.1016/j.ultramic.2004.01.011 |pmid=15149719 |issue=4}}</ref>\n\n===Cryo-TEM===\n[[Transmission electron cryomicroscopy|Main article: Transmission electron cryomicroscopy]]\n\nCryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) uses a TEM with a specimen holder capable of maintaining the specimen at [[liquid nitrogen]] or [[liquid helium]] temperatures.

Many materials require extensive sample preparation to produce a sample thin enough to be electron transparent, which makes TEM analysis a relatively time-consuming process with a low throughput of samples. The structure of the sample may also be changed during the preparation process. Also the field of view is relatively small, raising the possibility that the region analyzed may not be characteristic of the whole sample. There is potential that the sample may be damaged by the electron beam, particularly in the case of biological materials.\n\n===Resolution limits===\n[[File:MicroscopyResolution.png|thumb|Evolution of spatial resolution achieved with optical, transmission (TEM) and aberration-corrected electron microscopes (ACTEM).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1557/mrs2006.4|url=http://web.pdx.edu/~pmoeck/pennycooks%20aberration%20corrected%20microscopes.pdf|title=Materials Advances through Aberration-Corrected Electron Microscopy|journal=MRS Bulletin|volume=31|pages=36\u201343|year=2011|last1=Pennycook|first1=S.J.|last2=Varela|first2=M.|last3=Hetherington|first3=C.J.D.|last4=Kirkland|first4=A.I.}}</ref>]]\n{{See also|Transmission Electron Aberration-Corrected Microscope}}\nThe limit of resolution obtainable in a TEM may be described in several ways, and is typically referred to as the information limit of the microscope. One commonly used value{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} is a cut-off value of the [[contrast transfer function]], a function that is usually quoted in the [[frequency domain]] to define the reproduction of [[Spatial frequency|spatial frequencies]] of objects in the object plane by the microscope optics. A cut-off frequency, ''q''<sub>max</sub>, for the transfer function may be approximated with the following equation, where C<sub>s</sub> is the [[spherical aberration]] coefficient and \u03bb is the electron wavelength:<ref name=\"Reimer08\"/>\n\n:<math>q_\\max = \\frac{1}{0.67 (C_s \\lambda^3)^{1/4}}. </math>\n\nFor a 200&nbsp;kV microscope, with partly corrected spherical aberrations (\"to the third order\") and a C<sub>s</sub> value of 1&nbsp;\u00b5m,<ref name=furuya>{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/1468-6996/9/1/014110|pmid=27877936|pmc=5099805|title=Nanofabrication by advanced electron microscopy using intense and focused beam|year=2008|last1=Furuya|first1=Kazuo|journal=Science and Technology of Advanced Materials|volume=9|issue=1|page=014110|bibcode = 2008STAdM...9a4110F }}</ref> a theoretical cut-off value might be 1/''q''<sub>max</sub> = 42&nbsp;[[picometers|pm]].<ref name=\"Reimer08\"/> The same microscope without a corrector would have C<sub>s</sub> = 0.5&nbsp;mm and thus a 200-pm cut-off.<ref name=furuya/> The spherical aberrations are suppressed to the third or fifth order in the \"[[Transmission Electron Aberration-corrected Microscope|aberration-corrected]]\" microscopes.

This oscillatory nature implies that some spatial frequencies are faithfully imaged by the microscope, whilst others are suppressed. By combining multiple images with different spatial frequencies, the use of techniques such as focal series reconstruction can be used to improve the resolution of the TEM in a limited manner.<ref name=\"Reimer08\"/> The contrast transfer function can, to some extent, be experimentally approximated through techniques such as Fourier transforming images of amorphous material, such as [[amorphous carbon]].\n\nMore recently, advances in aberration corrector design have been able to reduce spherical aberrations<ref>{{cite journal|title=Present status and future prospects of spherical aberration corrected TEM/STEM for study of nanomaterials|doi=10.1088/1468-6996/9/1/014111|pmid=27877937|pmc=5099806|journal=Sci.
