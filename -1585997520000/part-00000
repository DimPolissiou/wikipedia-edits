Launched in support of her sixth studio album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'' (1997), the tour visited Europe, North America, Japan, New Zealand, Africa, and Australia. Jackson was inspired to create an autobiographical show using elements of [[Broadway theatre]], portraying her struggle with depression and self-esteem. The tour's stage production was developed as a storybook setting, allowing spectators to cross beyond her \"velvet rope\" and experience her life story through the evolution of her musical career. It consists of twenty-six songs, several band interludes, and intense choreography along with nine costume changes and four sets. Jackson depicts themes such as burlesque and domestic violence among the show's complex production of pyrotechnics and theatrics.\n\nIts setlist was composed of a wide array of Jackson's discography, focusing on new material in addition to medleys of previous hits. The tour is divided into five segments, each displaying different themes and settings. In \"What About\", Its racy visuals and depictions of violence drew controversy. In her rendition of \"Rope Burn\", Jackson selects a fan from the audience, performing a lap dance and kissing them while strapped into a chair. The show's suggestive promotional ads were banned from a number of publications, the image was reported to cause traffic accidents in Europe. A number of reviews commended Jackson's stage presence as consistently exceptional, noting improvement in her vocal delivery. It broke several attendance records and is the most attended stadium concert of all time in [[Hawaii]]. A private show was held in South East Asia by request of Princess Hamidah of the Brunei Royal Family.\n\n[[HBO]] broadcast the show during a special titled ''The Velvet Rope: Live in Madison Square Garden''. It drew over 15 million viewers and was the most watched program among homes subscribed to the network. The special won an [[Emmy Award]], and was also nominated for [[Image Awards]] and [[TMF Awards]]. It was released on DVD as ''[[The Velvet Rope Tour \u2013 Live in Concert]]'', certified platinum in several territories. Various aspects of the tour have influenced numerous performers, including [[Britney Spears]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Rihanna]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Panic! At the Disco]], [[Jay-Z]], and [[Arashi]]. Jackson notably selected [[NSYNC]] and [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] to open for the tour; introducing both to the public during their early careers. It has also inspired the careers of several performers, dancers, and professional choreographers.\n\n==Development==\nJackson developed the tour as an audiovisual storybook, sharing her life experience through the evolution of her music. Catherine McHugh of ''Entertainment Design'' reports \"Part of the reason Janet Jackson titled her latest record ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'' was to criticize barriers that separate different classes in society. So from the beginning of her show, Jackson strives to prove her accessibility to her audience. The spectacular opening presents Jackson's life\u2014at least professionally\u2014as an open book.\"<ref name=\"mchugh\">{{cite web|url=http://livedesignonline.com/mag/show_business_together_again|title=Together Again \u2013 [primary-term] content from Live Design Magazine|work=Live Design Magazine|author=McHugh, Catherine|date=1999-01-01|accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref> The stage was designed by Mark Fisher, saying \"She wanted to have a book opening and herself come out of it. So I finessed that book into the video screen.\" Fisher explained, \"Each different scene in the show would be akin to turning the pages in this book, and all the albums that she'd done in the past\u2014''[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]], [[Rhythm Nation 1814|Rhythm Nation]], [[janet.]]''\u2014would be represented.\"<ref name=\"mchugh\"/> Regarding its introduction, Fisher said, \"The elevator deposits her gracefully, as befits a princess, on the very front of the downstage.\" \"And of course, the entirely cool and wonderful and breaking-new-ground aspect of it is that it's all made possible by a thin [[LED]] screen.\" Roy Bennett stated \"We talked about developing the show around the scenarios of her career. I kept that in mind while lighting each different scene, but I tried to do it in an abstract way, without jumping too far away from the overall look of the show.\"<ref name=\"mchugh\"/>\n\nJackson said, \"To me, being onstage is about entertaining. I know there are people who just walk onstage and give you a show by just doing their music, but I always wanted something extra.\"<ref name=\"Hilburn\"/> Jackson conceptualized the tour in Paris, saying \"I knew what I wanted everyone to look like, especially for the opening number. I knew what I wanted everyone to wear. I visualized the whole thing.\" Jackson desired to create new themes for prior hits to avoid repeating previous performances.<ref name=\"Toronto\"/> The tour's logo is a variation of [[Akan language|Akan]] symbol the [[Sankofa]], meaning \"you can't move into the future until you understand your past.\" Jackson tattooed the symbol onto her wrist and used the image frequently throughout the tour's promotional imagery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2006/jul/16/features.magazine47|title=This much I know: Zulu, tattoo artist, 42, Los Angeles \u2013 From the Observer |work=The Guardian|author=Horkins, Tony|date=15 July 2006 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\nThe tour's promotional advertisements were controversial for their provocative imagery. The image depicts Jackson in a \"clingy, breast-enhancing bodysuit with what appears to be a nipple ring on the bodysuit's exterior and high-cut bikini panties.\" Several publications refused to publish the ad when they could not determine a way to present the image. Ken DeLisa, corporate affairs manager of ''[[Hartford Courant|The Courant]]'', said the photo did not meet the publication's standards. Jackson's spokeswoman said the tour's producers rejected proposed alterations, adding certain publications \"sent back an image that colored Janet's bosom to appear as a sports bra.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.courant.com/1998-05-05/features/9805050135_1_tv-guide-jackson-spokeswoman-jackson-s-tour|title=People |work=Hartford Courant|date=1998-05-05|accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref> A billboard of the image in England was also removed after its suggestive nature led to multiple traffic accidents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430411/janets-cleavage-wreaks-havoc-at-home-abroad.jhtml|title=Janet's Cleavage Wreaks Havoc At Home And Abroad \u2013 MTV.com|work=MTV|date=4 May 1998|accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref> The tour drew comparisons to Madonna's 1993 [[Girlie Show Tour]], and the UK's Q magazine commented that Jackson borrowed some elements from her pop adversary for her tour.\n\nThe tour's rendition of \"Rope Burn\" was considered \"incredibly sexy\" and \"what everyone was talking about\", becoming its most controversial performance.<ref name=\"Toronto\"/> During the act, Jackson \"plucks a male fan out of the crowd and ties his hands to the arms of a chair on stage while she gyrates around him and eventually kisses him.\"<ref name=\"Toronto\"/> The selected fan was required to be strapped into the chair due to safety concerns from Jackson's previous tour, after the participant had forcefully grabbed and fondled her while onstage. Jackson said, \"Everyone thinks it's this kinky thing. But the reason he gets strapped in is on this last tour, this guy grabbed my crotch. I sat on his lap and then I stood up and he grabbed my crotch, and I was trying to move his hand and he was too strong for me and he was just rubbing on my crotch. There was nothing I could do, so I said to myself I would never let that happen again.\"<ref name=\"Toronto\">{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/J/Jackson_Janet/1998/09/20/pf-746218.html|title=CANOE -- JAM! \u2013 Action Jackson|work=Toronto Sun|author=Stevenson, Jane|date=1998-05-05|accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref> Jackson's performance of \"What About\" is also infamous for its portrayal of domestic violence and abuse.

It is covered by an equally large quilt embossed with \"The Velvet Rope.\" A master of ceremonies opens the book, revealed to be an [[LED]] screen. Images dance across the screen until they explode and the screen splits, revealing Jackson behind it. She is subsequently lowered by elevator onto the main stage and the book stand is removed, leaving the screen hanging in place. It then moves to the back of the stage, followed by the appearance of the band and dancers.<ref name=\"mchugh\"/>\n\nThe concert opens and closes with a giant storybook containing a massive LED video screen, among the first technology of its kind at the time.<ref name=\"mchugh\"/> The book opens, revealing a frontispiece consisting of stars and planets before its covers split, floating backward and lit up into dual video screens. Jackson emerges between the screens in a top hat and velvet suit, resembling a \"19th century British merchant\", along with eight dancers to perform opening number \"Velvet Rope\", using a refrain of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' theme. After transitioning into \"[[If (Janet Jackson song)|If]]\", Jackson stares at the audience in silence for several minutes to cheering and applause before performing \"[[You (Janet Jackson song)|You]].\" Jackson is backed by dancers strutting alongside her wearing dual-sided masks, representing an isolated persona. Jackson then takes to a center stage stool to perform unplugged versions of \"[[Let's Wait Awhile]]\" and \"[[Again (Janet Jackson song)|Again]]\" with an acoustic guitarist. A \"frenzied\" medley of hits from ''[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]]'' succeeds the ballads, including \"[[Control (Janet Jackson song)|Control]]\", \"[[The Pleasure Principle (song)|The Pleasure Principle]]\", \"[[What Have You Done for Me Lately]]\", and \"[[Nasty (Janet Jackson song)|Nasty]]\", as well as ''[[janet.]]'s'' erotic [[House music|house]] number \"[[Throb (song)|Throb]].\" The red velvet curtain closes the stage while a \"hidden light-and sound show\" likened to extraterrestrial film ''[[Close Encounters]]'' entertains the crowd during set changes.<ref name=\"Daly\"/> The stage reveals the \"deranged madness\" of the following \"hallucinatory\" segment, featuring Jackson in a jester's headdress and satin bustier, with dancers dressed as \"flowers, Mad Hatters, and horny gnomes\" in a \"Wonderland\" setting. Jackson performs an upbeat medley of \"[[Escapade (song)|Escapade]]\", \"[[When I Think of You]]\", \"[[Miss You Much]]\", \"[[Runaway (Janet Jackson song)|Runaway]]\", and \"[[Love Will Never Do (Without You)]]\" across a \"blindingly bright, poppy-induced set design\" with varied props, which include a smiling clock tower, inflatable moons, mammoth chaise, vases, and books.<ref name=\"Daly\"/>\n\nThe set transitions into a \"steamy burlesque house\" with a succession of \"[[Alright (Janet Jackson song)|Alright]]\", \"[[I Get Lonely]]\", and instrumental interlude of \"[[Any Time, Any Place]].\" Jackson strips to a black bra and tight pants during \"Rope Burn\", selecting a participant from the crowd at random, \"pointing and demanding, \"You!\". The chosen fan is strapped into a chair as Jackson proceeds to pole dance and perform a striptease and lap dance, planting a kiss on the fan for the finale. \"[[Black Cat (song)|Black Cat]]\" is followed by an emotionally charged rendition of the rock-influenced \"What About\", one of the tour's most controversial and praised renditions. Jackson narrates as four dancers demonstrate two [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]]s of domestic violence in abusive relationships, including rape and physical abuse, concluding in a gun pulled on the abusers in self-defense. Proceeding is \"[[Rhythm Nation]]\", in which Jackson rapidly dances using martial arts movements and [[nunchucks]], followed by the ballad \"Special.\" The tour's encore includes chandeliers and a final outfit change, performing \"[[That's the Way Love Goes (Janet Jackson song)|That's the Way Love Goes]]\", \"[[Got 'til It's Gone]]\", and \"[[Go Deep]]\" before concluding with \"[[Together Again (Janet Jackson song)|Together Again]].\"<ref name=\"Daly\"/> Piano ballad \"[[Every Time (Janet Jackson song)|Every Time]]\" and \"[[Whoops Now]]\" were performed exclusively on selected international dates.\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Quote box|width=270px|align=right|quote=\"The title of Janet Jackson's current album, ''The Velvet Rope'', is intended to describe the emotional obstacles she perceives to exist in modern relationships, and to invite her fans behind her personal veil of the senses.

Tour''' was the third concert tour by American recording artist [[Janet Jackson]]. Launched in support of her sixth studio album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'' (1997), the tour visited Europe, North America, Japan, New Zealand, Africa, and Australia. Jackson was inspired to create an autobiographical show using elements of [[Broadway theatre]], portraying her struggle with depression and self-esteem. The tour's stage production was developed as a storybook setting, allowing spectators to cross beyond her \"velvet rope\" and experience her life story through the evolution of her musical career. It consists of twenty-six songs, several band interludes, and intense choreography along with nine costume changes and four sets. Jackson depicts themes such as burlesque and domestic violence among the show's complex production of pyrotechnics and theatrics.\n\nIts setlist was composed of a wide array of Jackson's discography, focusing on new material in addition to medleys of previous hits. The tour is divided into five segments, each displaying different themes and settings. In \"What About\", Its racy visuals and depictions of violence drew controversy. In her rendition of \"Rope Burn\", Jackson selects a fan from the audience, performing a lap dance and kissing them while strapped into a chair. The show's suggestive promotional ads were banned from a number of publications, the image was reported to cause traffic accidents in Europe. A number of reviews commended Jackson's stage presence as consistently exceptional, noting improvement in her vocal delivery. It broke several attendance records and is the most attended stadium concert of all time in [[Hawaii]]. A private show was held in South East Asia by request of Princess Hamidah of the Brunei Royal Family.\n\n[[HBO]] broadcast the show during a special titled ''The Velvet Rope: Live in Madison Square Garden''. It drew over 15 million viewers and was the most watched program among homes subscribed to the network. The special won an [[Emmy Award]], and was also nominated for [[Image Awards]] and [[TMF Awards]]. It was released on DVD as ''[[The Velvet Rope Tour \u2013 Live in Concert]]'', certified platinum in several territories. Various aspects of the tour have influenced numerous performers, including [[Britney Spears]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Rihanna]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Panic! At the Disco]], [[Jay-Z]], and [[Arashi]]. Jackson notably selected [[N Sync]] and [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] to open for the tour; introducing both to the public during their early careers. It has also inspired the careers of several performers, dancers, and professional choreographers.\n\n==Development==\nJackson developed the tour as an audiovisual storybook, sharing her life experience through the evolution of her music. Catherine McHugh of ''Entertainment Design'' reports \"Part of the reason Janet Jackson titled her latest record ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'' was to criticize barriers that separate different classes in society. So from the beginning of her show, Jackson strives to prove her accessibility to her audience. The spectacular opening presents Jackson's life\u2014at least professionally\u2014as an open book.\"<ref name=\"mchugh\">{{cite web|url=http://livedesignonline.com/mag/show_business_together_again|title=Together Again \u2013 [primary-term] content from Live Design Magazine|work=Live Design Magazine|author=McHugh, Catherine|date=1999-01-01|accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref> The stage was designed by Mark Fisher, saying \"She wanted to have a book opening and herself come out of it. So I finessed that book into the video screen.\" Fisher explained, \"Each different scene in the show would be akin to turning the pages in this book, and all the albums that she'd done in the past\u2014''[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]], [[Rhythm Nation 1814|Rhythm Nation]], [[janet.]]''\u2014would be represented.\"<ref name=\"mchugh\"/> Regarding its introduction, Fisher said, \"The elevator deposits her gracefully, as befits a princess, on the very front of the downstage.\" \"And of course, the entirely cool and wonderful and breaking-new-ground aspect of it is that it's all made possible by a thin [[LED]] screen.\" Roy Bennett stated \"We talked about developing the show around the scenarios of her career. I kept that in mind while lighting each different scene, but I tried to do it in an abstract way, without jumping too far away from the overall look of the show.\"<ref name=\"mchugh\"/>\n\nJackson said, \"To me, being onstage is about entertaining. I know there are people who just walk onstage and give you a show by just doing their music, but I always wanted something extra.\"<ref name=\"Hilburn\"/> Jackson conceptualized the tour in Paris, saying \"I knew what I wanted everyone to look like, especially for the opening number. I knew what I wanted everyone to wear. I visualized the whole thing.\" Jackson desired to create new themes for prior hits to avoid repeating previous performances.<ref name=\"Toronto\"/> The tour's logo is a variation of [[Akan language|Akan]] symbol the [[Sankofa]], meaning \"you can't move into the future until you understand your past.\" Jackson tattooed the symbol onto her wrist and used the image frequently throughout the tour's promotional imagery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2006/jul/16/features.magazine47|title=This much I know: Zulu, tattoo artist, 42, Los Angeles \u2013 From the Observer |work=The Guardian|author=Horkins, Tony|date=15 July 2006 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\nThe tour's promotional advertisements were controversial for their provocative imagery. The image depicts Jackson in a \"clingy, breast-enhancing bodysuit with what appears to be a nipple ring on the bodysuit's exterior and high-cut bikini panties.\" Several publications refused to publish the ad when they could not determine a way to present the image. Ken DeLisa, corporate affairs manager of ''[[Hartford Courant|The Courant]]'', said the photo did not meet the publication's standards. Jackson's spokeswoman said the tour's producers rejected proposed alterations, adding certain publications \"sent back an image that colored Janet's bosom to appear as a sports bra.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.courant.com/1998-05-05/features/9805050135_1_tv-guide-jackson-spokeswoman-jackson-s-tour|title=People |work=Hartford Courant|date=1998-05-05|accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref> A billboard of the image in England was also removed after its suggestive nature led to multiple traffic accidents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430411/janets-cleavage-wreaks-havoc-at-home-abroad.jhtml|title=Janet's Cleavage Wreaks Havoc At Home And Abroad \u2013 MTV.com|work=MTV|date=4 May 1998|accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref> The tour drew comparisons to Madonna's 1993 [[Girlie Show Tour]], and the UK's Q magazine commented that Jackson borrowed some elements from her pop adversary for her tour.\n\nThe tour's rendition of \"Rope Burn\" was considered \"incredibly sexy\" and \"what everyone was talking about\", becoming its most controversial performance.<ref name=\"Toronto\"/> During the act, Jackson \"plucks a male fan out of the crowd and ties his hands to the arms of a chair on stage while she gyrates around him and eventually kisses him.\"<ref name=\"Toronto\"/> The selected fan was required to be strapped into the chair due to safety concerns from Jackson's previous tour, after the participant had forcefully grabbed and fondled her while onstage. Jackson said, \"Everyone thinks it's this kinky thing. But the reason he gets strapped in is on this last tour, this guy grabbed my crotch. I sat on his lap and then I stood up and he grabbed my crotch, and I was trying to move his hand and he was too strong for me and he was just rubbing on my crotch. There was nothing I could do, so I said to myself I would never let that happen again.\"<ref name=\"Toronto\">{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/J/Jackson_Janet/1998/09/20/pf-746218.html|title=CANOE -- JAM! \u2013 Action Jackson|work=Toronto Sun|author=Stevenson, Jane|date=1998-05-05|accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref> Jackson's performance of \"What About\" is also infamous for its portrayal of domestic violence and abuse. The tour's \"racy\" costumes were designed by fashion designer David Cardona, who commented \"All her life it's been about Janet being cute. Now it's about Janet being sexy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20126656,00.html|title=Altered States \u2013 Makeovers, Courtney Love, Janet Jackson, Madonna, Marla Maples, Michelle Kwan, Monica Lewinsky, Oprah Winfrey, Paula Jones, Roseanne Barr : People.com|work=People|author=O'Neill, Anne-Marie|date=2 Nov 1998|accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Concert synopsis==\nThe show's setlist consists of twenty-six songs, several band interludes and over twenty dance numbers, along with nine costume changes and four different sets, in addition to frequent pyrotechnics and theatrics.<ref name=\"Daly\"/> At the beginning of the show, burgundy curtains accented by golden tassels are drawn apart, exposing an enormous book. It is covered by an equally large quilt embossed with \"The Velvet Rope.\" A master of ceremonies opens the book, revealed to be an [[LED]] screen. Images dance across the screen until they explode and the screen splits, revealing Jackson behind it. She is subsequently lowered by elevator onto the main stage and the book stand is removed, leaving the screen hanging in place. It then moves to the back of the stage, followed by the appearance of the band and dancers.<ref name=\"mchugh\"/>\n\nThe concert opens and closes with a giant storybook containing a massive LED video screen, among the first technology of its kind at the time.<ref name=\"mchugh\"/> The book opens, revealing a frontispiece consisting of stars and planets before its covers split, floating backward and lit up into dual video screens. Jackson emerges between the screens in a top hat and velvet suit, resembling a \"19th century British merchant\", along with eight dancers to perform opening number \"Velvet Rope\", using a refrain of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' theme. After transitioning into \"[[If (Janet Jackson song)|If]]\", Jackson stares at the audience in silence for several minutes to cheering and applause before performing \"[[You (Janet Jackson song)|You]].\" Jackson is backed by dancers strutting alongside her wearing dual-sided masks, representing an isolated persona. Jackson then takes to a center stage stool to perform unplugged versions of \"[[Let's Wait Awhile]]\" and \"[[Again (Janet Jackson song)|Again]]\" with an acoustic guitarist. A \"frenzied\" medley of hits from ''[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]]'' succeeds the ballads, including \"[[Control (Janet Jackson song)|Control]]\", \"[[The Pleasure Principle (song)|The Pleasure Principle]]\", \"[[What Have You Done for Me Lately]]\", and \"[[Nasty (Janet Jackson song)|Nasty]]\", as well as ''[[janet.]]'s'' erotic [[House music|house]] number \"[[Throb (song)|Throb]].\" The red velvet curtain closes the stage while a \"hidden light-and sound show\" likened to extraterrestrial film ''[[Close Encounters]]'' entertains the crowd during set changes.<ref name=\"Daly\"/> The stage reveals the \"deranged madness\" of the following \"hallucinatory\" segment, featuring Jackson in a jester's headdress and satin bustier, with dancers dressed as \"flowers, Mad Hatters, and horny gnomes\" in a \"Wonderland\" setting. Jackson performs an upbeat medley of \"[[Escapade (song)|Escapade]]\", \"[[When I Think of You]]\", \"[[Miss You Much]]\", \"[[Runaway (Janet Jackson song)|Runaway]]\", and \"[[Love Will Never Do (Without You)]]\" across a \"blindingly bright, poppy-induced set design\" with varied props, which include a smiling clock tower, inflatable moons, mammoth chaise, vases, and books.<ref name=\"Daly\"/>\n\nThe set transitions into a \"steamy burlesque house\" with a succession of \"[[Alright (Janet Jackson song)|Alright]]\", \"[[I Get Lonely]]\", and instrumental interlude of \"[[Any Time, Any Place]].\" Jackson strips to a black bra and tight pants during \"Rope Burn\", selecting a participant from the crowd at random, \"pointing and demanding, \"You!\". The chosen fan is strapped into a chair as Jackson proceeds to pole dance and perform a striptease and lap dance, planting a kiss on the fan for the finale. \"[[Black Cat (song)|Black Cat]]\" is followed by an emotionally charged rendition of the rock-influenced \"What About\", one of the tour's most controversial and praised renditions. Jackson narrates as four dancers demonstrate two [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]]s of domestic violence in abusive relationships, including rape and physical abuse, concluding in a gun pulled on the abusers in self-defense. Proceeding is \"[[Rhythm Nation]]\", in which Jackson rapidly dances using martial arts movements and [[nunchucks]], followed by the ballad \"Special.\" The tour's encore includes chandeliers and a final outfit change, performing \"[[That's the Way Love Goes (Janet Jackson song)|That's the Way Love Goes]]\", \"[[Got 'til It's Gone]]\", and \"[[Go Deep]]\" before concluding with \"[[Together Again (Janet Jackson song)|Together Again]].\"<ref name=\"Daly\"/> Piano ballad \"[[Every Time (Janet Jackson song)|Every Time]]\" and \"[[Whoops Now]]\" were performed exclusively on selected international dates.\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Quote box|width=270px|align=right|quote=\"The title of Janet Jackson's current album, ''The Velvet Rope'', is intended to describe the emotional obstacles she perceives to exist in modern relationships, and to invite her fans behind her personal veil of the senses. There was not much chance to get up close and personal with Jackson last Thursday when she started her world tour, as thousands of screaming admirers muscled in on the act.

Its varied themes were contrasted with [[psychiatric]] thrillers ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' and ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]'', being \"as damn freaky as it sounds\", using a color scheme described as \"a well-lighted explosion at the [[Crayola]] factory.\" The show's second segment was analyzed as \"deranged madness\", questioning \"Can this really be little Penny from ''[[Good Times]]''?\" Daly praised Jackson's \"breakneck speed\" and favorably considered it \"summer-entertainment bliss\", adding \"Janet's still as [[Nasty (song)|nasty]] as she wants to be.\"<ref name=\"Daly\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/live-report-janet-jackson-19980710|title=Live Report: Janet Jackson \u2013 Music News \u2013 Rolling Stone|work=Rolling Stone|author=Daly, Steve|date=10 July 1999 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref> Sean Piccoli of ''[[The Sun Sentinel]]'' applauded the tour as a \"birth of a new form of entertainment\", effectively taking \"music-video fundamentalism to a new extreme in live performance.\" Jackson's \"athletic, superchoreographed presentation\" was considered \"sheery sensory thrill\", thought to have \"made [[Spiceworld Tour|Spice World]] look like public theater.\" The show was analyzed to be \"as much a broadcast as it was a show\", transitioning through \"a seamless whirl of songs, costumes and set changes.\" Jackson's performances were described as a \"technicolor barrage\", ranging from \"punched-up, steely grooves\" to \"pillowy, whispered ballads.\" Piccoli declared highlights to include the opening number, \"an eerie incantation on the strangeness and isolation of celebrity\", and the \"explosively colorful\" ''[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]]'' medley incorporating themes of \"children's theater.\" The tour's rendition of \"Rope Burn\", showcasing Jackson as she \"coaxed a young man from the audience onstage for a veritable striptease routine \u2013 for which the fellow was strapped by wristbands to his seat\", was also praised.

Upon the show's encore Jackson \"lingered, clinging to the thunderous applause\" in a way which \"demonstrated a personal vulnerability and warmth\", considered its \"real breakthrough.\" Hilburn stated \"the tour and album should go a long way toward helping Jackson finally get the credit she deserves as an artist.\"<ref name=\"Hilburn\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1998-09-11/entertainment/9809100102_1_radiance-and-warmth-mark-and-jackson-frequently-painful-soul-searching|title=The `Velvet' Touch: Janet Shows Softer Side \u2013 Sun Sentinel|work=Los Angeles Times|author=Hilburn, Robert|date=11 Sep 1998|accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref> The tour's \"computer design-phase\" was considered \"a marvel of precision\" by Tom Moon of ''[[The Inquirer]]''.

The film follows ten Londoners through a city framed by capital and loss, as they navigate their wild and wayward way, travelling on their own terms towards a co-existence far stronger than 'community'. On reclaimed land they find themselves on the right side of history , caught between two train tracks, the present tense and future hopes. They question who has stolen what from whom, and how things might be fixed, in an often contradictory rite of passage. Finding solidarity in resistance, they demand the right to go on.m.  \n\n[[File:Farewelll to the Haggerston estate .jpg|thumb|A 2013 procession passing the ''i am here'' artwork]]\nArt exhibitions and projects include ''[https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-i-am-here-art-haggerston-estate-hackney-london-49120489.html i am here],'' a public artwork in [[Haggerston]], Hackney, which was made in response to the experience of living on a council estate which was being gentrified.

The film follows ten Londoners through a city framed by capital and loss, as they navigate their wild and wayward way, travelling on their own terms towards a co-existence far stronger than 'community'. On reclaimed land they find themselves on the right side of history , caught between two train tracks, the present tense and future hopes. They question who has stolen what from whom, and how things might be fixed, in an often contradictory rite of passage.

DMG began to develop in 1900, after the death of its co-founder, [[Gottlieb Daimler]]. Although the name was not lodged as a [[trade name]] until 23 June 1902 and not registered legally until 26 September, the brand name eventually would be applied to an automobile model built by [[Wilhelm Maybach]] to specifications by [[Emil Jellinek]] that was delivered to him on 22 December 1900. By Jellinek's contract, the new model contained a newly designed engine designated \"Daimler-Mercedes\". This engine name is the first instance of the use of the name Mercedes by DMG. The automobile design would later be called the ''[[Mercedes 35 hp]]''.\n\nEmil Jellinek was an Austrian diplomat based in [[Nice]] who ran a profitable business selling cars, and, as a racing enthusiast, had been racing DMG automobiles under the pseudonym ''Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s'', after his daughter, [[Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s Jellinek]].<ref>[http://www.emercedesbenz.com/Apr08/17_001109_The_History_Behind_The_Mercedes_Benz_Brand_And_The_Three_Pointed_Star.html The history behind the Mercedes-Benz brand and the three-pointed star] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025220255/http://www.emercedesbenz.com/Apr08/17_001109_The_History_Behind_The_Mercedes_Benz_Brand_And_The_Three_Pointed_Star.html |date=25 October 2010 }}. eMercedesBenz.com. 17 April 2008.</ref> Later he contracted with DMG for a small series of dedicated [[sports cars]] containing an engine that officially bore his daughter's name. He raced them very successfully, gaining recognition that increased interest in customers and Jellinek was placed on the board of directors of DMG. This model was a significant advancement in the history of automobiles. The model was released for sale in 1901 under the name of Mercedes 35&nbsp;hp and, because of the success of the model, DMG began to apply the name as a series to other models such as, ''Mercedes 8/11 hp'' and ''Mercedes 40 hp Simplex''. Jellinek seems to have become obsessed with the name and even had his name changed to Jellinek-Mercedes. Maybach quit DMG in 1907 and started up his own business.\n\nThe name, Mercedes, later was used to represent DMG in another new brand name, ''[[Mercedes-Benz]]'', created in 1926 when it was applied to all vehicles produced by the new company, [[Daimler Benz|Daimler-Benz AG]], resulting from the merger of [[Benz & Cie.]] and [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]] in that year. The last name of [[Karl Benz]] was retained in the new brand, but since DMG had sold exclusive licences to foreign companies, they couldn't use the name of their founder, Daimler, legally in all countries and decided to use the name of their most popular model. Since Jellinek was a member of the board of directors by the time of the merger, the name was promoted for continued good luck to the new company.\n\n==History of the Mercedes series==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=213 cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin: 0 0 1em 1em; text-align:left; border-collapse:collapse; border:1px gray solid; font-size:69%; background:#f9f9f9\"\n|+ <big><big>'''Mercedes 35&nbsp;hp (1900)'''</big></big>\n|-\n| style=\"background:#efefef\" align=\"center\" colspan=2 |\n[[File:Mercedes 35hp 01.jpg|200px|Mercedes 35 hp]]\n|-\n!align=left|Long wheelbase.

This caused DMG to abandon racing.\n\nNonetheless, [[Emil Jellinek]] came to an agreement with DMG on 2 April 1900 by promising the large sum of 550,000 [[German gold mark|Goldmark]] if [[Wilhelm Maybach]] would design a revolutionary [[sports car]] for him, later to be called the ''[[Mercedes 35 hp]]'', of which 36 units had to be delivered before 15 October. The contract also included an order for 36 standard DMG 8&nbsp;hp cars. Jellinek soon became a member of the ''DMG'' ''Board of Management'' and obtained the exclusive dealership for the model\u2014that would become the new ''Mercedes 35 hp''\u2014for France, Austria, Hungary, Belgium, and United States of America. The first one was not delivered to Jellinek until 22 December, however.\n\nJellinek laid down strict specifications for the new model stating \"I don't want a car for today or tomorrow, it will be the car of the day after tomorrow\". He itemized many new parameters to overcome the problems found in many of the ill-designed \"horseless carriages\" of the time which made automobiles unsuitable for high speeds and at risk of overturning:\n*Long [[wheelbase]] and wide track to provide stability\n*Engine to be located\u2014better\u2014on the car's chassis\n*Lower center of gravity\n*Electric [[Ignition system|ignition]] using the new ''[[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]]'' system (in lieu of a gas heated glow tube)\n\nA new engine, developed for the model, would be called the ''Daimler-Mercedes'' engine, officially, which the DMG chairman accepted readily as it overcame the problem of the Daimler name in France being owned by Panhard & Levassor.\n\nOver the next few months, Jellinek oversaw the development of the new car\u2014at first by daily telegrams\u2014and later by traveling to Stuttgart. He took delivery of the first one on 22 December 1900, at Nice's railway station\u2014it had already been sold to the [[Henri de Rothschild|Baron Henri de Rothschild]], who also had raced cars in Nice.\n\nIn 1901, the car amazed the automobile world. Jellinek again won the Nice races, easily beating his opponents in all the capacity classes and reaching 60&nbsp;km/h. The director of the [[French Automobile Club]], Paul Meyan, stated: ''\"We have entered the Mercedes era\"'', a sentiment echoed by newspapers worldwide.\n\nThe records set by the new Mercedes 35&nbsp;hp model amazed the entire automobile world. DMG's sales shot up, its Stuttgart plant was operating at full capacity, and it was consolidating its future as an automobile manufacturer\u2014rather than merely an engine manufacturer who built some automobiles. The number of employees steadily increased from 340 in 1900 to 2,200 in 1904.\n\n''Mercedes'' was not lodged as a trade name for DMG automobile models until 23 June 1902, but soon the company decided to use the name as the trade name for its entire line of automobile models\u2014and officially registered it on 26 September 1902.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DMG}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mercedes (Car)}}\n[[Category:Daimler AG brands and marques]]\n[[Category:Car manufacturers of Germany]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Mercedes (car)|the post-1926 automobile brand with the name|Mercedes-Benz}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Mercedes Comp. 1904.jpg|left|thumb|Share of the Mercedes Company Limited, issued 23 June 1904; this British sales company was the first company which was allowed to sell Mercedes cars in England and in other countries.

The automobile design would later be called the ''[[Mercedes 35 hp]]''.\n\nEmil Jellinek was an Austrian diplomat based in [[Nice]] who ran a profitable business selling cars, and, as a racing enthusiast, had been racing DMG automobiles under the pseudonym ''Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s'', after his daughter, [[Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s Jellinek]].<ref>[http://www.emercedesbenz.com/Apr08/17_001109_The_History_Behind_The_Mercedes_Benz_Brand_And_The_Three_Pointed_Star.html The history behind the Mercedes-Benz brand and the three-pointed star] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025220255/http://www.emercedesbenz.com/Apr08/17_001109_The_History_Behind_The_Mercedes_Benz_Brand_And_The_Three_Pointed_Star.html |date=25 October 2010 }}. eMercedesBenz.com. 17 April 2008.</ref> Later he contracted with DMG for a small series of dedicated [[sports cars]] containing an engine that officially bore his daughter's name. He raced them very successfully, gaining recognition that increased interest in customers and Jellinek was placed on the board of directors of DMG. This model was a significant advancement in the history of automobiles. The model was released for sale in 1901 under the name of Mercedes 35&nbsp;hp and, because of the success of the model, DMG began to apply the name as a series to other models such as, ''Mercedes 8/11 hp'' and ''Mercedes 40 hp Simplex''. Jellinek seems to have become obsessed with the name and even had his name changed to Jellinek-Mercedes. Maybach quit DMG in 1907 and started up his own business.\n\nThe name, Mercedes, later was used to represent DMG in another new brand name, ''[[Mercedes-Benz]]'', created in 1926 when it was applied to all vehicles produced by the new company, [[Daimler Benz|Daimler-Benz AG]], resulting from the merger of [[Benz & Cie.]] and [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]] in that year. The last name of [[Karl Benz]] was retained in the new brand, but since DMG had sold exclusive licences to foreign companies, they couldn't use the name of their founder, Daimler, legally in all countries and decided to use the name of their most popular model. Since Jellinek was a member of the board of directors by the time of the merger, the name was promoted for continued good luck to the new company.\n\n==History of the Mercedes series==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=213 cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin: 0 0 1em 1em; text-align:left; border-collapse:collapse; border:1px gray solid; font-size:69%; background:#f9f9f9\"\n|+ <big><big>'''Mercedes 35&nbsp;hp (1900)'''</big></big>\n|-\n| style=\"background:#efefef\" align=\"center\" colspan=2 |\n[[File:Mercedes 35hp 01.jpg|200px|Mercedes 35 hp]]\n|-\n!align=left|Long wheelbase.

This caused DMG to abandon racing.\n\nNonetheless, [[Emil Jellinek]] came to an agreement with DMG on 2 April 1900 by promising the large sum of 550,000 [[German gold mark|Goldmark]] if [[Wilhelm Maybach]] would design a revolutionary [[sports car]] for him, later to be called the ''[[Mercedes 35 hp]]'', of which 36 units had to be delivered before 15 October. The contract also included an order for 36 standard DMG 8&nbsp;hp cars. Jellinek soon became a member of the ''DMG'' ''Board of Management'' and obtained the exclusive dealership for the model\u2014that would become the new ''Mercedes 35 hp''\u2014for France, Austria, Hungary, Belgium, and United States of America. The first one was not delivered to Jellinek until 22 December, however.\n\nJellinek laid down strict specifications for the new model stating \"I don't want a car for today or tomorrow, it will be the car of the day after tomorrow\". He itemized many new parameters to overcome the problems found in many of the ill-designed \"horseless carriages\" of the time which made automobiles unsuitable for high speeds and at risk of overturning:\n*Long [[wheelbase]] and wide track to provide stability\n*Engine to be located\u2014better\u2014on the car's chassis\n*Lower center of gravity\n*Electric [[Ignition system|ignition]] using the new ''[[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]]'' system (in lieu of a gas heated glow tube)\n\nA new engine, developed for the model, would be called the ''Daimler-Mercedes'' engine, officially, which the DMG chairman accepted readily as it overcame the problem of the Daimler name in France being owned by Panhard & Levassor.\n\nOver the next few months, Jellinek oversaw the development of the new car\u2014at first by daily telegrams\u2014and later by traveling to Stuttgart. He took delivery of the first one on 22 December 1900, at Nice's railway station\u2014it had already been sold to the [[Henri de Rothschild|Baron Henri de Rothschild]], who also had raced cars in Nice.\n\nIn 1901, the car amazed the automobile world. Jellinek again won the Nice races, easily beating his opponents in all the capacity classes and reaching 60&nbsp;km/h. The director of the [[French Automobile Club]], Paul Meyan, stated: ''\"We have entered the Mercedes era\"'', a sentiment echoed by newspapers worldwide.\n\nThe records set by the new Mercedes 35&nbsp;hp model amazed the entire automobile world. DMG's sales shot up, its Stuttgart plant was operating at full capacity, and it was consolidating its future as an automobile manufacturer\u2014rather than merely an engine manufacturer who built some automobiles. The number of employees steadily increased from 340 in 1900 to 2,200 in 1904.\n\n''Mercedes'' was not lodged as a trade name for DMG automobile models until 23 June 1902, but soon the company decided to use the name as the trade name for its entire line of automobile models\u2014and officially registered it on 26 September 1902.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DMG}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mercedes (Car)}}\n[[Category:Daimler AG brands and marques]]\n[[Category:Car manufacturers of Germany]]\n", "name_user": "Dave.Dunford", "label": "safe", "comment": "restrictiveappositive; remove comma", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_(marque)"}

It operated as an electronics specialist on products such as [[broadcasting]] equipment, [[Acoustical_engineering#Electroacoustics|electroacoustics]], [[shortwave radio]] sets, [[radar]] systems and [[television]]. During the 1970s, the company diversified manufacturing [[Telephone exchange|backend telephony]] equipment, [[semiconductor]]s, and [[medical imaging]] apparatus. It also began to strike major deals outside of the domestic market as well, acquiring considerable business from the [[Middle East]].\n\nDuring the late 1980s, Thomson-CSF, anticipating defense spending cutbacks, conducted a radical business restructuring, merging its semiconductor interests with those of the [[Italy|Italian]] defense group [[Finmeccanica]] and exchanging its medical imaging technology for [[General Electric]]'s consumer electronics businesses. Towards the latter decades of its operations, Thomson-CFS built itself up into a [[Multinational corporation|multinational company]]. During 1989, Thomson-CSF acquired [[Philips]]' defence electronics business, [[Thales Nederland|Hollandse Signaalapparaten B.V.]]. In 1999, the company was [[privatisation|privatised]]; shortly thereafter, Thomson-CSF took over the British defence electronics company [[Racal|Racal Electronics]]. During December 2000, the business was rebranded ''[[Thales Group]]''.\n\n==History==\nThomson-CFS can trace its origins back to the formation of the American business [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]] by [[Elihu Thomson]] and [[Edwin Houston]] in 1879. On 15 April 1892, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company merged with its long-term rival, the [[Edison General Electric Company]], to form [[General Electric]] (GE); that same year, the company formed an overseas subsidiary, named ''Thomson Houston International'', based in France. During 1893, ''Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise Thomson-Houston'' (CFTH) was established as a partner to GE. CFTH's operations centered around the application of GE's [[patent]]s in the growing [[electricity generation]] and [[power transmission|transmission]] industry.<ref name = \"official history\"/> It is from this company that the modern Thomson companies would evolve.<ref name = \"official history\">{{cite web |url = https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/global/group/history |title = History |publisher = [[Thales Group]] |access-date = 15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1966, CFTH merged with armaments and vehicle manufacturer [[Hotchkiss-Brandt]] to form ''Thomson-Houston-Hotchkiss-Brandt'', which was subsequently renamed ''Thomson-Brandt''. Two years later, the electronics business of Thomson-Brandt merged with [[Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de T\u00e9l\u00e9graphie Sans Fil]] (''General Wireless Telegraphy Company'', commonly abbreviated as ''CSF'') to form ''Thomson-CSF''.<ref name = \"official history\"/> Prior to the merger, CFS had operated as a pioneer in the fields of [[broadcasting]], [[Acoustical_engineering#Electroacoustics|electroacoustics]], [[shortwave radio]], [[radar]] systems and [[television]].<ref name = \"official history\"/> Thomson Brandt maintained a significant shareholding in the merged company (approximately 40%).\n\nDuring the 1970s, Thomson-CSF received its first major contract in the [[Middle East]]ern market; it was in this period that the company diversified into several new sectors, leading to it manufacturing [[Telephone exchange|backend telephony]] equipment, [[semiconductor]]s, and [[medical imaging]] apparatus.<ref name = \"official history\"/> However, by the early 1980s, Thomson-CSF was in a relatively weak financial position with a high level of debt; while it possessed a highly diversified portfolio of businesses, its market share within the majority of these many sectors was viewed as being too small to be realistically profitable despite increasing business being received from overseas buyers at this time.<ref name = \"official history\"/>\n\nDuring 1982, both Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF were [[nationalization|nationalised]] by France's [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|Mitterrand government]]; as a consequence, Thomson-Brandt was renamed ''Thomson SA'' (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme) and merged with Thomson-CSF. Throughout the 1980s, the company's financial position improved dramatically as undertook a major reorganisation, focusing its efforts on the production of electronics for professional and defense customers.<ref name = \"official history\"/> In 1983, it divested ''Thomson-CSF T\u00e9l\u00e9phone '', its civil [[telecommunication]]s division, to telecommunications specialist [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]]. Four years later, its semiconductor interests were merged with those of the [[Italy|Italian]] defense group [[Finmeccanica]].<ref name = \"official history\"/> That same year, Thomson-CSF's medical imaging technology was exchanged with GE for GE's [[RCA]] and consumer electronics businesses.<ref name = \"official history\"/>\n\n[[File:Thomson CSF Cyrano IV-001.jpg|thumb|Thomson-CSF Cyrano IV airborne radar as used on the [[Dassault Mirage F1]]]]\nDuring the late 1980s, Thomson-CSF, anticipating future defense spending cutbacks and a downturn in its lucrative export contracts, initiated a radical restructuring of its businesses with the aim of to maintaining its margins.<ref name = \"official history\"/> A policy of proactive external growth was adopted, focusing on the European market; between 1987 and 1976, the company's non-French subsidiaries' share of consolidated revenues rose from 5% to 25%. During 1988, a new division, ''Thomson Consumer Electronics'' was formed; in 1995, this division was rebranded as ''Thomson Multimedia''.<ref name = \"official history\"/> During 1989, it acquired [[Philips]]' defence electronics business, [[Thales Nederland|Hollandse Signaalapparaten B.V.]]. During the 1990s, Thomson-CSF gained a controlling interest in ''Sextant Avionique'', which was formed by the merge of the company's own avionics business with that of French aircraft manufacturer [[A\u00e9rospatiale]].<ref name = \"official history\"/> The company also divested its interests in the French [[bank]] [[Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais]] and semiconductor manufacturer [[STMicroelectronics|SGSThomson]].<ref name = \"official history\"/>\n\nDuring the late 1990s, [[Prime Minister of France|French Prime Minister]] [[Lionel Jospin]]'s [[Plural Left]] government initiated a policy towards the [[privatisation]] towards several state-owned companies, including Thomson-CSF.<ref>Godsmark, Chris and John Lichfield.

Firstly, the professional and defence electronics businesses of Alcatel and ''Dassault \u00c9lectronique'' were merged with Thomson-CSF.<ref name = \"official history\"/> Secondly, satellite businesses of Alcatel, Aerospatiale and Thomson-CSF are merged to form a new entity, [[Thales Alenia Space|Alcatel Space]]; this was jointly owned by Alcatel and Thomson-CSF.<ref name = \"official history\"/>\n\nBy June 1998, implementation of the finalised agreement had commenced.<ref name = \"official history\"/> Furthermore, the majority of Thomson-CSF's capital was transferred into private ownership; the French State reduced its holding in the company from 58 per cent to 40 per cent. At the time, Thomson-CSF's principal private shareholders were Alcatel and Dassault Industries.<ref name = \"official history\"/> The division of the company's consumer electronics and defence businesses prior to [[privatisation]] brought about the creation of ''Thomson Multimedia'', which was a distinct entity from Thomson-CSF. The independently-operating Thomson Multimedia has since been restructured and trades as [[Technicolor SA]].<ref name = \"official history\"/>\n\nFollowing its privatisation, Thomson-CSF continued to orientate itself towards the defense electronics sector, establishing itself in multiple overseas nations, including [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[South Korea]] and [[Singapore]].<ref name = \"official history\"/> Shortly after its privatisation, the company began exploring the possibility of merging with British defense specialist [[Marconi Electronic Systems]]; however, its ambitions were foiled by the success of a rival bid by the defense and aerospace firm [[British Aerospace]], which rebranded itself as [[BAE Systems]] shortly thereafter. Remaining keen to expand its defense and technology business, Thomson-CFS announced the acquisition of the British defence electronics company [[Racal|Racal Electronics]], which was purchased in exchange for \u00a31.3&nbsp;billion. As a result of its takeover of Racal, the United Kingdom became Thomson-CSF's second-largest domestic industrial base after France. Racal was initially rebranded ''Thomson-CSF Racal plc''.<ref name = \"official history\"/>\n\nShortly after the Racal acquisition, Thomson-CSF conducted a strategic review of its portfolio of businesses; it decided to adopt new organisational structure comprising three business areas: defence, aerospace, and [[information technology]] and services.<ref name = \"official history\"/> Management decided that the company ought to leverage its dual-purpose technology, marketing itself towards particular civil markets that held strong parallels with its established defence and aerospace competencies, such as mobile telecommunications. Meanwhile, non-strategic assets were divested.<ref name = \"official history\"/> Thomson-CSF also explored business opportunities further afield; during December 2000, it was announced that the company was forming a joint venture with the American defense company [[Raytheon]]; this arrangement was claimed to be first transatlantic joint venture in the defence sector.<ref name = \"official history\"/>\n\nDuring December 2000, Thomson-CSF was officially rebranded as ''Thales'' (from the Greek philosopher [[Thales]], pronounced {{IPA-fr|tal\u025bs|}} reflecting its pronunciation in [[French language|French]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.aerospaceonline.com/doc/thomson-csf-changes-name-to-thales-0001 |title=Thomson-CSF changes name to Thales |website=www.aerospaceonline.com |language=en |access-date= 4 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/12/06/europe/thales/ |title=Thomson-CSF to become Thales |date = 6 December 2000 |website=money.cnn.com |access-date=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book |last=Jean-Pierre |first=Thierry | author-link=Thierry Jean-Pierre |date=16 October 2003 |title=Ta\u00efwan Connection : Scandales et meurtres au c\u0153ur de la R\u00e9publique |trans-title=Taiwan Connection \u2013 Scandals and Murders at the Heart of the Republic |language=French |location= |publisher=Robert Laffont |isbn=978-2221100820 }}\n* ''L'entreprise partag\u00e9e ?

Four years later, its semiconductor interests were merged with those of the [[Italy|Italian]] defense group [[Finmeccanica]].<ref name = \"official history\"/> That same year, Thomson-CSF's medical imaging technology was exchanged with GE for GE's [[RCA]] and consumer electronics businesses.<ref name = \"official history\"/>\n\n[[File:Thomson CSF Cyrano IV-001.jpg|thumb|Thomson-CSF Cyrano IV airborne radar as used on the [[Dassault Mirage F1]]]]\nDuring the late 1980s, Thomson-CSF, anticipating future defense spending cutbacks and a downturn in its lucrative export contracts, initiated a radical restructuring of its businesses with the aim of to maintaining its margins.<ref name = \"official history\"/> A policy of proactive external growth was adopted, focusing on the European market; between 1987 and 1976, the company's non-French subsidiaries' share of consolidated revenues rose from 5% to 25%. During 1988, a new division, ''Thomson Consumer Electronics'' was formed; in 1995, this division was rebranded as ''Thomson Multimedia''.<ref name = \"official history\"/> During 1989, it acquired [[Philips]]' defence electronics business, [[Thales Nederland|Hollandse Signaalapparaten B.V.]]. During the 1990s, Thomson-CSF gained a controlling interest in ''Sextant Avionique'', which was formed by the merge of the company's own avionics business with that of French aircraft manufacturer [[A\u00e9rospatiale]].<ref name = \"official history\"/> The company also divested its interests in the French [[bank]] [[Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais]] and semiconductor manufacturer [[STMicroelectronics|SGSThomson]].<ref name = \"official history\"/>\n\nDuring the late 1990s, [[Prime Minister of France|French Prime Minister]] [[Lionel Jospin]]'s [[Plural Left]] government initiated a policy towards the [[privatisation]] towards several state-owned companies, including Thomson-CSF.<ref>Godsmark, Chris and John Lichfield.

Firstly, the professional and defence electronics businesses of Alcatel and ''Dassault \u00c9lectronique'' were merged with Thomson-CSF.<ref name = \"official history\"/> Secondly, satellite businesses of Alcatel, Aerospatiale and Thomson-CSF are merged to form a new entity, [[Thales Alenia Space|Alcatel Space]]; this was jointly owned by Alcatel and Thomson-CSF.<ref name = \"official history\"/>\n\nBy June 1998, implementation of the finalised agreement had commenced.<ref name = \"official history\"/> Furthermore, the majority of Thomson-CSF's capital was transferred into private ownership; the French State reduced its holding in the company from 58 per cent to 40 per cent. At the time, Thomson-CSF's principal private shareholders were Alcatel and Dassault Industries.<ref name = \"official history\"/> The division of the company's consumer electronics and defence businesses prior to [[privatisation]] brought about the creation of ''Thomson Multimedia'', which was a distinct entity from Thomson-CSF. The independently-operating Thomson Multimedia has since been restructured and trades as [[Technicolor SA]].<ref name = \"official history\"/>\n\nFollowing its privatisation, Thomson-CSF continued to orientate itself towards the defense electronics sector, establishing itself in multiple overseas nations, including [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[South Korea]] and [[Singapore]].<ref name = \"official history\"/> Shortly after its privatisation, the company began exploring the possibility of merging with British defense specialist [[Marconi Electronic Systems]]; however, its ambitions were foiled by the success of a rival bid by the defense and aerospace firm [[British Aerospace]], which rebranded itself as [[BAE Systems]] shortly thereafter. Remaining keen to expand its defense and technology business, Thomson-CFS announced the acquisition of the British defence electronics company [[Racal|Racal Electronics]], which was purchased in exchange for \u00a31.3&nbsp;billion. As a result of its takeover of Racal, the United Kingdom became Thomson-CSF's second-largest domestic industrial base after France. Racal was initially rebranded ''Thomson-CSF Racal plc''.<ref name = \"official history\"/>\n\nShortly after the Racal acquisition, Thomson-CSF conducted a strategic review of its portfolio of businesses; it decided to adopt new organisational structure comprising three business areas: defence, aerospace, and [[information technology]] and services.<ref name = \"official history\"/> Management decided that the company ought to leverage its dual-purpose technology, marketing itself towards particular civil markets that held strong parallels with its established defence and aerospace competencies, such as mobile telecommunications.

And then I'd go downstairs and I would write. This album is such a display of not only how you can reframe the way that you view the world, but I promise and I hope, that the love that was around me in the process of making this album is something that other people feel, that they know that artistically, like, you know how producers are, if one guy\u2019s working on it, or one girl\u2019s working on it, they don\u2019t want anyone else to work on it, they don\u2019t wanna share, they, everybody gets cocky, there was none of that.

And then I'd go downstairs and I would write. This album is such a display of not only how you can reframe the way that you view the world, but I promise and I hope, that the love that was around me in the process of making this album is something that other people feel, that they know that artistically, like, you know how producers are, if one guy\u2019s working on it, or one girl\u2019s working on it, they don\u2019t want anyone else to work on it, they don\u2019t wanna share, they, everybody gets cocky, there was none of that. These records got passed around to so many different people, there were so many different iterations of these songs because we all wanted it to be perfect and literally nobody cared who put their fingerprints on it, as long as it was the dopest thing that we could give to the world and that it was meaningful, authentic, and completely me.<ref name=\"Beats1\"/>}}\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]'' released in March 2020, Gaga talked at length about numerous topics, including the recording process for ''Chromatica'', and confirmed that BloodPop was the \"center\" and her \"nucleus\" of production while creating the album and that he had a hand in the creation of every track.<ref name=\"Paper1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.papermag.com/lady-gaga-chromatica-2645479910.html |title=Lady Gaga: Life on Chromatica |last=Moran |first=Justin |date=March 16, 2020 |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]}}</ref> It was also confirmed in the same interview that Gaga worked with a wide array of producers and musicians, such as [[Burns (musician)|Burns]], [[Axwell]] of [[Swedish House Mafia]], [[Tchami]], Benjamin Rice, and [[Rami Yacoub]], to create an album described as an \"[[electronic music|electronic]] [[tapestry]]\u201d by the interviewer.<ref name=\"Paper1\"/> In discussing the large collaborative atmosphere that enveloped the album's production, she said, \"It's easy to go into a computer and find a cool loop, but the producers I work with don't work this way.

So it's all the colors, all the sounds, you know, so we, we're talking about inclusivity and life and also a lot of what we see around us and what we're experiencing is math, which is very much like music and sound is math as well. So we talked about that, and then I sort of went back and I said, 'OK, well, yeah, it's inclusivity but it's really a way of thinking,' you know, it's not just, 'Oh, Chromatica, we're being inclusive with all the colors, all the people,' and when I say, 'All the colors, all the people'  I mean way more than we could possibly fathom.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork2020\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Release and promotion==\nIn response to tabloid reports saying she might be pregnant, Gaga tweeted on March 12, 2019, \"Rumors I'm pregnant?

A means a Japanese-style fortress built by the Japanese army in various parts of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula during the Japanese invasion of Korea and the oil refinery.\n\nThe Japanese province is a Japanese-style fortress built by the Japanese military to secure a base in the southern coastal area or to contact each other, which can be classified into two major categories depending on its nature.\n\nThe first fortress was built by order from [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] to [[Seoul]] and later moved to Uiju to secure a supply route for the army when he entered the Ming Dynasty. Also known as Tsutainanoshiro, which was built within a distance that the army could march on in almost a day, was built mainly in areas where there were no suitable towns or towns to repair the townships of Joseon. Given that the location of the estuary is not clear today, and is stacked between Kilju and Anbyeon in Hamkyong Province, it is believed that the Japanese military established the connection at every passing street at that time.\n\nThe second is Gungseong, a fortress built on the south coast ([[Busan]], [[Ulsan]], [[Gyeongsangnam-do]] and [[Suncheon]], South [[Jeolla]] Province).<ref>Untitled - \uacbd\ub0a8\ubc1c\uc804\uc5f0\uad6c\uc6d0 \uc5ed\uc0ac\ubb38\ud654\uc13c\ud130 [http://www.gnchc.re.kr/down/9-1.pdf]</ref>\n\nThe Japanese province is thought to have been built not only on the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula but also in the inland region, but the reality is unknown now because it is unknown.

In November of the same year, Konishi County, which occupied Pyongyang, built a dwarf planet in Pyongyang, while Ukida built a dwarf planet in Namsan, just south of Hanseong. However, the Japanese army, which began to be chased by the Cho-Myong coalition forces in January of the following year, built some 20 dwarfs along the coast of what is now South Gyeongsang Province from May 1593.\n* The Japanese army, which had invaded again after the collapse of negotiations to strengthen the Japanese invasion of Korea, occupied the previously-built dwarf planet and made the Japanese army its base by occupying the Ungcheon dwarf. At that time, the Japanese military secured the occupied area and repaired the previously built coastal dwarfs for connection with the mainland Japan, while the front was extended to Ulsan on the east and Suncheon on the west.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n!

[[Japanese castle]]s built along the southern shores of Korea during [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)|Japanese invasions of Korea]] between 1592 and 1598 by the Japanese militaries. A means a Japanese-style fortress built by the Japanese army in various parts of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula during the Japanese invasion of Korea and the oil refinery.\n\nThe Japanese province is a Japanese-style fortress built by the Japanese military to secure a base in the southern coastal area or to contact each other, which can be classified into two major categories depending on its nature.\n\nThe first fortress was built by order from [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] to [[Seoul]] and later moved to Uiju to secure a supply route for the army when he entered the Ming Dynasty. Also known as Tsutainanoshiro, which was built within a distance that the army could march on in almost a day, was built mainly in areas where there were no suitable towns or towns to repair the townships of Joseon. Given that the location of the estuary is not clear today, and is stacked between Kilju and Anbyeon in Hamkyong Province, it is believed that the Japanese military established the connection at every passing street at that time.\n\nThe second is Gungseong, a fortress built on the south coast ([[Busan]], [[Ulsan]], [[Gyeongsangnam-do]] and [[Suncheon]], South [[Jeolla]] Province).<ref>Untitled - \uacbd\ub0a8\ubc1c\uc804\uc5f0\uad6c\uc6d0 \uc5ed\uc0ac\ubb38\ud654\uc13c\ud130 [http://www.gnchc.re.kr/down/9-1.pdf]</ref>\n\nThe Japanese province is thought to have been built not only on the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula but also in the inland region, but the reality is unknown now because it is unknown. Thirty-two areas on the southern coast have already been investigated.\n\n==List of Japanese Castles in Korea==\n{| border=1 cellspacing=0 style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom:solid

In November of the same year, Konishi County, which occupied Pyongyang, built a dwarf planet in Pyongyang, while Ukida built a dwarf planet in Namsan, just south of Hanseong. However, the Japanese army, which began to be chased by the Cho-Myong coalition forces in January of the following year, built some 20 dwarfs along the coast of what is now South Gyeongsang Province from May 1593.\n* The Japanese army, which had invaded again after the collapse of negotiations to strengthen the Japanese invasion of Korea, occupied the previously-built dwarf planet and made the Japanese army its base by occupying the Ungcheon dwarf. At that time, the Japanese military secured the occupied area and repaired the previously built coastal dwarfs for connection with the mainland Japan, while the front was extended to Ulsan on the east and Suncheon on the west.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n!

He was known especially for his popular poetry written during the [[Second World War|Second World War]], but he also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction (including the Hartwarp books). Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse.<ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

'Parton Street Bookshop' in ''Pen Pusher'']</ref> His first published collection of verse, ''Spring Encounter'', came out in 1933 from [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] and gained the attention of [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]] who became a patron. Pudney also wrote for [[The Listener]], and worked as a producer at the [[BBC]], where he produced the radio play ''Hadrian's Wall'' with text by Auden and music by Britten, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 25 November 1937.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IMFZ8a8aNHUC&pg=PT116&lpg=PT116&dq=John+Pudney+Benjamin+Britten&source=bl&ots=MUhRGApbmp&sig=ACfU3U2b1caNszL8RMuBi3jjBlRlW4z0Lw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8-c67k8zoAhUJesAKHRsaDzIQ6AEwCXoECAsQOA#v=onepage&q=John%20Pudney%20Benjamin%20Britten&f=false Warden, C.

He was the book critic for [[The Daily Express]] from 1945 and with the ''[[News Review]]'' from 1948 to 1950. He then shifted into publishing, as a director and literary adviser to Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award.

Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''. However, poetry remained the most important to him. His later work, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) onward took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection of 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/>\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married Crystal Selwyn Herbert, the daughter of [[A. P. Herbert]], the writer and [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] [[Member of Parliament]]. They had two daughters and a son, but were divorced. In 1955 he married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967 - despite a hit-and-run accident in the middle that broke both his legs and dislocated his shoulder.<ref name=white/> That process became a subject for his writing. ''Spill Out'' was written \"half of it on the booze and half off, and he didn't remember which half was which\".<ref name=white/> In 1976 Pudney developed cancer of the throat from which he died a year later in much pain.

He was known especially for his popular poetry written during the [[Second World War|Second World War]], but he also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction (including the Hartwarp books). Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse.<ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

'Parton Street Bookshop' in ''Pen Pusher'']</ref> His first published collection of verse, ''Spring Encounter'', came out in 1933 from [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] and gained the attention of [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]] who became a patron. Pudney also wrote for [[The Listener]], and worked as a producer at the [[BBC]], where he produced the radio play ''Hadrian's Wall'' with text by Auden and music by Britten, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 25 November 1937.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IMFZ8a8aNHUC&pg=PT116&lpg=PT116&dq=John+Pudney+Benjamin+Britten&source=bl&ots=MUhRGApbmp&sig=ACfU3U2b1caNszL8RMuBi3jjBlRlW4z0Lw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8-c67k8zoAhUJesAKHRsaDzIQ6AEwCXoECAsQOA#v=onepage&q=John%20Pudney%20Benjamin%20Britten&f=false Warden, C.

He was the book critic for [[The Daily Express]] from 1945 and with the ''[[News Review]]'' from 1948 to 1950. He then shifted into publishing, as a director and literary adviser to Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award.

Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''. However, poetry remained the most important to him. His later work, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) onward took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection of 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/>\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married Crystal Selwyn Herbert, the daughter of [[A. P. Herbert]], the writer and [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] [[Member of Parliament]]. They had two daughters and a son, but were divorced. In 1955 he married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967 - despite a hit-and-run accident in the middle that broke both his legs and dislocated his shoulder.<ref name=white/> That process became a subject for his writing. ''Spill Out'' was written \"half of it on the booze and half off, and he didn't remember which half was which\".<ref name=white/> In 1976 he developed cancer of the throat from which he died a year later in much pain. He wrote about his illness unflinchingly in his autobiographical ''Thank Goodness for Cake'', posthumously published in 1978.<ref name=dnb/> His grandson [[Toby Perkins]] is the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Chesterfield]].\n\n==Works==\n\n===Poetry===\n*''Spring Encounter'' (1933)\n*''Open the Sky'' ([[Boriswood]] 1934)\n*''Dispersal Point and other Air Poems'' (1942)\n*''The Grass Grew All Round'' (1942)\n*''Beyond This Disregard'' (1943) poems\n*''South of Forty'' (1943) poems\n*''Ten Summers'': Poems 1933-1943 (1944)\n*''Almanack of Hope'': Sonnets (1944)\n*''Air Force Poetry'' (1944) (anthology, edited with Henry Treese)\n*''Flight above Cloud'' (1944)\n*''World Still There'' (1945)\n*Selected Poems (1946)\n*''Low Life'' (1947)\n*''Commemorations'' (1948)\n*''Sixpenny Songs'' (1953)\n*Collected Poems (1957)\n*''Spill Out'': Poems and Ballads (1967)\n*''Spandrels'': Poems and Ballads (1969)\n*''Take This Orange'': Poems and Ballads (1971)\n*Selected Poems 1967-1973 (1973)\n*''Living in a One-Sided House'' (1976) poems\n*''Writers' Workshop'', poetry anthology publication, editor with [[Norman Hidden]] and [[Michael Johnson (editor)|Michael Johnson]] (from 1967)<ref>Durham University.

Compared to Naples, Genoa is one-sided. Naples has the greatest splendor alongside the greatest misery. Port life, carriage ride, high-level opera house, even a piece of Rome: the National Museum. Beside this the heavenly nature, unmatched. The sea of \u200b\u200bGenoa more imposing, but also more monotonous. Here a placid cove, framed by strange mountains and closed by characteristic islands. And all I can see from the balcony of my room. Like a giant amphitheater, the wonderful city with its intense buzz lies at my feet. On the left the old city with the docks of the port and the ancient Vesuvius, on the right the modern Villa Nazionale and Posillipo. All around the house there are gardens of fresh green, fantastic shapes and myriads of flowers. Salita del Petraio, Villa De Rosa 48, Pensione Haase, Naples, is called this fabulous panoramic lookout. The sea is wonderfully blue and calm. The city is a lively picture of clarity, facades of blocks of houses, in the light and darkness, white streets, sections of dark green parks.

In his diaries, he compared Geonoa and Naples:\n\n\"It is already impossible for me to even enumerate what I have seen. Compared to Genoa, Naples is indolent, messy and sick. Compared to Naples, Genoa is one-sided. Naples has the greatest splendor alongside the greatest misery. Port life, carriage ride, high-level opera house, even a piece of Rome: the National Museum. Beside this the heavenly nature, unmatched. The sea of \u200b\u200bGenoa more imposing, but also more monotonous. Here a placid cove, framed by strange mountains and closed by characteristic islands. And all I can see from the balcony of my room. Like a giant amphitheater, the wonderful city with its intense buzz lies at my feet. On the left the old city with the docks of the port and the ancient Vesuvius, on the right the modern Villa Nazionale and Posillipo. All around the house there are gardens of fresh green, fantastic shapes and myriads of flowers. Salita del Petraio, Villa De Rosa 48, Pensione Haase, Naples, is called this fabulous panoramic lookout. The sea is wonderfully blue and calm. The city is a lively picture of clarity, facades of blocks of houses, in the light and darkness, white streets, sections of dark green parks. Faced with such a spectacle one thinks of the temptation of Christ.
