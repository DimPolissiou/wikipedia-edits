The biennial prize, awarded to books on children, was recommended by a panel of judges. The ADL attempted to withdraw the prize ten days prior to the award ceremony, however after Lukas threatened he would file a lawsuit the ADL decided to reinstate it. According to the ADL the book \"strongly understated the level of anti-Semitism in Poland. It also strongly overstated the number of people who rescued Jews\". The ADL cancelled the award ceremony, and mailed the $1000 US prize money to Lukas.<ref name=\"jta\">[https://www.jta.org/1996/03/11/archive/imbroglio-erupts-over-adl-prize-to-controversial-holocaust-book Imbroglio Erupts over ADL Prize to Controversial Holocaust Book], JTA, 11 March 1996</ref><ref>https://www.jweekly.com/1996/03/15/adl-forced-to-honor-a-book-that-teeters-on-anti-semitism/ ADL forced to honor a book that teeters on anti-Semitism</ref><ref name=\"Goska2002\">{{cite book|author=Danusha Veronica Goska|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9UUeAQAAMAAJ|title=Bieganski: The Brute Polak Stereotype and Its Application in Polish-Jewish Relations and American Popular Culture|publisher=Indiana University|year=2002|page=83}}</ref>\n\n=== Forgotten Survivors ===\nLukas' continuing interest in the Polish tragedy during World War II resulted in several additional books such as ''Forgotten Survivors: Polish Christians Remember the Nazi Occupation'' (2004).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historynet.com/wwii-book-review-forgotten-survivors.htm|title=WWII Book Review: Forgotten Survivors|last=Alexander B.

The  (USPOD) implemented postal zones for many large cities in 1943\n\nFor example:\n\n<blockquote><poem>Mr. John Smith\n3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue\nMinneapolis ''16'', Minnesota</poem></blockquote>\n\nThe \"16\" is the number of the postal zone in the specific city\n\nBy the early 1960s, a more organized system was needed, and non-mandatory five-digit ZIP Codes were introduced nationwide on July 1, 1963. The USPOD issued its ''Publication 59: Abbreviations for Use with ZIP Code'' on October 1, 1963, with the list of  which are generally written with both letters capitalized. An earlier list, publicized in June 1963, had proposed capitalized abbreviations ranging from two to five lettersAccording to ''Publication 59'', the two-letter standard was \"based on a maximum 23-position line, because this has been found to be the most universally acceptable line capacity basis for major addressing systems\",<ref name=\"USPS\">[https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/state-abbreviations.pdf \"State Abbreviations\", USPS.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116005935/http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/state-abbreviations.pdf|date=2017-01-16}}.</ref> which would be exceeded by a long city name combined with a multi-letter state abbreviation, such as \"Sacramento, Calif.\" along with the ZIP Code. The abbreviations have remained unchanged, with the exception of , which was changed from NB to NE in 1969 at the request of th, to avoid confusion with te Canadian province o.\n\nis considered the father of the ZIP Code; he submitted his proposal in 1944 while working as a .The post office only credits Moon with the first three digits of the ZIP Code, which describe the  (SCF) or \"sec center\". An SCF is a central mail processing facility with those three digits. The fourth and fifth digits, which give a more precise locale within the SCF, were proposed by Henry Bentley Hahn, Sr\n\nThe SCF sorts mail to all post offices with those first three digits in their ZIP Codes. The mail is sorted according to the final two digits of the ZIP Code and sent to the corresponding post offices in the early morning. Sectional centers do not deliver mail and are not open to the public (although the building may include a post office that is open to the public), and most of their employees work the . Items of mail picked up at post offices are sent to their own SCFs in the afternoon, where the mail is sorted overnight. In the case of large cities, the last two digits as assigned generally coincide with the older postal zone number\n\nFor example:\n\nry for second- and third-class , and the system was soon adopted generally. The United States Post Office used a , which it called , to promote the use of the ZIP Code. He was often depicted with a legend such as \"USE ZIP CODE\" in the  of panes of  or on the covers of booklet panes of stamps.\n\nIn 1971, Elmira (NY)  reporter Dick Baumbach found out the White House was not using a ZIP Code on its envelopes.  Herb Klein, special assistant to President Nixon, responded by saying the next printing of envelopes would include the ZIP Code\n\n===ZIP+4===\nIn 1983, the U.S. Postal Service introduced an expanded ZIP Code system that it called ''ZIP+4'', often called \"plus-four codes\", \"add-on codes\", or \"add-ons\". A ZIP+4 Code uses the basic five-digit code plus four additional digits to identify a geographic segment within the five-digit delivery area, such as a [[city block]], a group of apartments, an individual high-volume receiver of mail, a post office box, or any other unit that could use an extra identifier to aid in efficient mail sorting and delivery. However, initial attempts to promote universal use of the new format met with public resistance and today the plus-four code is not required.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhistory.com/zip-code-history.html|title=Organizing America: A History of the ZIP Code|last=|first=|date=25 July 2014|website=RandomHistory.com|publisher=Random History|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812203838/http://www.randomhistory.com/zip-code-history.html|archive-date=12 August 2014|accessdate=19 June 2017}}</ref> In general, mail is read by a [[Multiline Optical Character Reader|multiline optical character reader]] (MLOCR) that almost instantly determines the correct ZIP+4 Code from the address\u2014along with the even more specific [[delivery point]]\u2014and sprays an [[Intelligent Mail barcode]] (IM) on the face of the mail piece that corresponds to 11 digits\u2014nine for the ZIP+4 Code and two for the delivery point.\n\nFor [[Post office box|Post Office Boxes]], the general (but not invariable) rule is that each box has its own ZIP+4 code. The add-on code is often one of the following: the last four digits of the box number (e.g. PO Box 107050, Albany, NY 12201-7050), zero plus the last three digits of the box number (e.g., PO Box 17727, Eagle River, AK 99577-0727), or, if the box number consists of fewer than four digits, enough zeros are attached to the front of the box number to produce a four-digit number (e.g., PO Box 77, Juneau, AK 99750-0077). However, there is no uniform rule, so the ZIP+4 Code must be looked up individually for each box{{citation needed |date=October 2017}} (e.g. using the USPS's official ZIP Code Lookup tool, and being sure to enter just city and state, not the 5-digit ZIP).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction_input |title=ZIP Code\u2122 Lookup {{!}} USPS |website=tools.usps.com |access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\n===Postal bar code===\nThe ZIP Code is often translated into an Intelligent Mail barcode that is printed on the mailpiece to make it easier for automated machines to sort. A barcode can be printed by the sender (some word-processing programs such as [[WordPerfect]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kb.iu.edu/data/aapk.html |title=Archived: How can I print routing barcodes on envelopes? - Knowledge Base |publisher=The Trustees of Indiana University |accessdate=July 10, 2009}}</ref> include the feature), but this is not recommended, as the address-to-ZIP lookup tables can be significantly out of date. It is better to let the post office put one on when it processes the piece.{{citation needed|date = November 2018}} In general, the post office uses [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] technology, though in some cases a human might have to read and enter the address.{{citation needed|date = November 2018}}\n\nCustomers who send [[bulk mail]] can get a [[discounts and allowances|discount]] on [[postage]] if they have printed the barcode themselves and have presorted the mail. This requires more than just a simple [[typeface|font]]; [[mailing list]]s must be standardized with up-to-date [[Coding Accuracy Support System]] (CASS)-certified software that adds and verifies a full, correct ZIP+4 Code and an additional two [[Numerical digit|digit]]s representing the exact [[delivery point]].{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Furthermore, mail must be sorted in a specific manner to an 11-digit code with at least 150 mailpieces for each qualifying ZIP Code and must be accompanied by documentation confirming this. These steps are usually done with PAVE-certified software that also prints the barcoded address labels and the barcoded sack or tray tags.{{citation needed|date = November 2018}}\n\nThe assignment of delivery point digits (the 10th and 11th digits) is intended to ensure that every single mailable point in the country has its own 12-digit number. The delivery-point digits are calculated based on the primary or secondary number of the address. The USPS publishes the rules for calculating the delivery point in a document called the CASS Technical Guide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ribbs.usps.gov/files/CASS/TECHNICAL_GUIDES/CASSTECH.PDF#page=40 |format=PDF |title=CASS Technical Guide |publisher=United States Postal Service |page=40 |accessdate=July 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419090333/http://ribbs.usps.gov/files/CASS/TECHNICAL_GUIDES/CASSTECH.PDF#page=40 |archivedate=April 19, 2009 }}</ref> However, when confronted with two addresses like 18 and 18C, often CASS will assign the same 12-digit number to two distinct mail delivery points. The last digit is always a [[check digit]], which is obtained by summing all 5, 9 or 11 digits, taking the [[modular arithmetic|residue]] modulo 10 of this sum (i.e., the remainder after dividing by 10) and finally subtracting this from 10. (Thus, the check digit for 10001-0001 00 would be 7, since 1+1+1=3, 3\u22613(mod 10) and 10\u20133=7.){{citation needed|date = November 2018}}\n\n==Structure and allocation==\n===Scope and international mail===\nZIP Codes designate [[delivery point]]s within the United States (and its territories). There are generally no ZIP Codes for deliveries to other countries, except for the independent countries of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]], and the [[Republic of Palau]], each of which is integrated into the U.S. postal system under a [[Compact of Free Association]]. Another exception are ZIP Codes used for overseas stations of USA armed forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/28c2_010.htm|title=Military Addresses|publisher=[[United States Postal Service]] |accessdate=December 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nMail to [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|U.S. diplomatic missions]] overseas is addressed as if it were addressed to a street address in [[Washington, D.C.]] The four-digit [[diplomatic pouch]] number is used as a building number, while the city in which the embassy or consulate is located is combined with the word \"Place\" to form a street name. Each mission uses a ZIP+4 Code consisting of '''20521''' and the diplomatic pouch number. For example, the mailing address of the U.S. Embassy in [[New Delhi]], [[India]] would be:\n\n<blockquote><poem>Embassy of the United States of America\n9000 New Delhi Place\nWashington, DC{{nbsp}}{{nbsp}}20521-9000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/m/a/c8028.htm |title=Mail Management| publisher=Diplomatic Pouch and Mail Division of the U.S. Department of State |accessdate=April 1, 2015}}</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\nHowever, individuals posted at diplomatic missions overseas are now assigned a Diplomatic Post Office address and unique box number. The Zip Code identifies the diplomatic mission destination and is different from the diplomatic pouch number in the example above. While delivered through the pouch system, mail to such addresses are not considered \"Diplomatic Pouch\" materials, and as such must adhere to the mailing regulations of the host country. An example address is:\n\n<blockquote><poem>JOHN ADAMS\nUNIT 8400 BOX 0000\nDPO AE{{nbsp}}{{nbsp}}09498-0048<ref>{{cite web |title=Military & Diplomatic Mail {{!}} USPS |url=https://www.usps.com/ship/apo-fpo-dpo.htm |website=www.usps.com |accessdate=8 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819001108/https://www.usps.com/ship/apo-fpo-dpo.htm |archive-date=19 August 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\n===By type and use===\nThere are four types of ZIP Codes:\n\n* Unique: assigned to a single high-volume address\n* Post Office Box-only: used only for PO Boxes at a given facility, not for any other type of delivery\n* Military: used to route mail for the U.S. military\n* Standard: all other ZIP Codes.\n\nUnique ZIP Codes are used for governmental agencies, universities, businesses, or buildings that receive such extremely high volumes of mail that they need their own ZIP Codes. Government examples include 20505 for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in Washington, D.C.; 81009 for the [[Federal Citizen Information Center]] of the [[U.S. General Services Administration]] (GSA)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/aboutus.htm |title=FCIC&nbsp;&ndash; About Us |publisher=Federal Citizen Information Center of the U.S. General Services Administration |accessdate=July 10, 2009 |quote=For years, consumers have written to Pueblo, Colorado 81009 for timely, practical information they trust. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714061028/http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/aboutus.htm |archivedate=July 14, 2009 }}</ref> in [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. Examples of private address unique ZIP Codes include the headquarters of [[Walmart]] (72716).<!-- NOTE: Please do not add more examples; these suffice. -->\n\nAn example of a PO Box-only ZIP Code is 22313, which is used for PO Boxes at the main post office in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], such as those used by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]. In the area surrounding that post office, home and business mail delivery addresses use ZIP Code 22314, which is thus a Standard ZIP Code.\n\nIn certain exceptional cases, a nominally Standard-type ZIP Code may, in practice, be used as one of the three other types.  For example, the ZIP Code 43210 in [[Columbus, Ohio]] is listed as a Standard-type ZIP Code.  However, since its geographic boundaries are essentially coterminous with those of the [[Ohio State University]]'s main campus, it is effectively exclusive to the university even though it is not officially a \"Unique\"-type ZIP Code.\n\n===By geography===\n====Primary state prefixes====\nZIP Codes are numbered with the first digit representing a certain group of [[U.S. state]]s, the second and third digits together representing a [[region]] in that group (or perhaps a large city) and the fourth and fifth digits representing a group of delivery addresses within that region. The main town in a region (if applicable) often gets the first ZIP Codes for that region; afterward, the numerical order often follows the alphabetical order.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Because ZIP Codes are intended for efficient postal delivery, there are unusual cases where a ZIP Code crosses state boundaries, such as a military facility spanning multiple states or remote areas of one state most easily serviced from a bordering state. For example, ZIP Code 42223 serves [[Fort Campbell]], which spans [[Christian County, Kentucky]], and [[Montgomery County, Tennessee]], and ZIP Code 97635 includes portions of [[Lake County, Oregon]], and [[Modoc County, California]].\n\nIn general, the first three digits designate a [[sectional center facility]], the mail sorting and distribution center for an area. A sectional center facility may have more than one three-digit code assigned to it. For example, the Northern Virginia sectional center facility in [[Merrifield, Virginia|Merrifield]] is assigned codes 220, 221, 222, and 223. In some cases, a sectional center facility may serve an area in an adjacent state, usually due to the lack of a proper location for a center in that region. For example, 739 in [[Oklahoma]] is assigned to [[Liberal, Kansas]]; 865 in [[Arizona]] is assigned to [[Gallup, New Mexico]]; and 961 in [[California]] to [[Reno, Nevada]].\n\nIn terms of geographic location, many of the lowest ZIP Codes, which begin with&nbsp;'0', are in the [[New England]] region. Also in the '0' region are [[New Jersey]] (non-contiguous with the remainder of the '0' area), [[Puerto Rico]], the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], and [[APO/FPO]] military addresses for personnel stationed in [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Southwest Asia]], and aboard vessels based in the waters adjoining those lands. The lowest ZIP Code is in [[Holtsville, New York]] (00501, a ZIP Code exclusively for the [[U.S. Internal Revenue Service]] center there).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://facts.usps.com/map/#fact147 |title=USPS Postal Facts |publisher=facts.usps.com |date=2018-02-15 |accessdate=2018-05-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819070643/https://facts.usps.com/map/#fact147 |archive-date=2018-08-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other low ZIP Codes are 00601 for [[Adjuntas, Puerto Rico]]; 01001 for [[Agawam, Massachusetts]], and the zip codes 01002 and 01003 for [[Amherst, Massachusetts]]; 01002 is used for mail in town, while 01003 is reserved for the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. Until 2001, there were six ZIP Codes lower than 00501 that were numbered from 00210 to 00215 (located in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]]) and were used by the [[Diversity Immigrant Visa]] program to receive applications from non-U.S. citizens.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nThe numbers increase southward along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], such as 02115 ([[Boston]]), 10001 ([[New York City]]), 19103 ([[Philadelphia]]), 21201 ([[Baltimore]]), 20008 ([[Washington, D.C.]]), 30303 ([[Atlanta]]), and 33130 ([[Miami]]) (these are only examples, as each of these cities contain several ZIP Codes in the same range). From there, the numbers increase heading westward and northward east of the [[Mississippi River]], southward west of the Mississippi River, and northward on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. For example, 40202 is in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], 50309 in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], 60601 in [[Chicago]], 63101 in [[St. Louis]], 77036 in [[Houston]], 80202 in [[Denver]], 94111 in [[San Francisco]], 98101 in [[Seattle]], and 99950 in [[Ketchikan, Alaska]] (the highest ZIP Code).\n\n[[File:ZIP_Code_zones.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|ZIP Code zones in the United States]]\n\nThe first digit of the ZIP Code is allocated as follows:\n\n* '''0''' = [[Connecticut]] (CT), [[Massachusetts]] (MA), [[Maine]] (ME), [[New Hampshire]] (NH), [[New Jersey]] (NJ), [[New York (state)|New York]] (NY, [[Fishers Island, New York|Fishers Island only]]), [[Puerto Rico]] (PR), [[Rhode Island]] (RI), [[Vermont]] (VT), [[Virgin Islands]] (VI), Army Post Office Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East (APO AE); Fleet Post Office Europe and the Middle East (FPO AE)\n* '''1''' = [[Delaware]] (DE), [[New York (state)|New York]] (NY), [[Pennsylvania]] (PA)\n* '''2''' = [[District of Columbia]] (DC), [[Maryland]] (MD), [[North Carolina]] (NC), [[South Carolina]] (SC), [[Virginia]] (VA), [[West Virginia]] (WV)\n* '''3''' = [[Alabama]] (AL), [[Florida]] (FL), [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (GA), [[Mississippi]] (MS), [[Tennessee]] (TN), Army Post Office Americas (APO AA), Fleet Post Office Americas (FPO AA)\n* '''4''' = [[Indiana]] (IN), [[Kentucky]] (KY), [[Michigan]] (MI), [[Ohio]] (OH)\n* '''5''' = [[Iowa]] (IA), [[Minnesota]] (MN), [[Montana]] (MT), [[North Dakota]] (ND), [[South Dakota]] (SD), [[Wisconsin]] (WI)\n* ''' 6''' = [[Illinois]] (IL), [[Kansas]] (KS), [[Missouri]] (MO), [[Nebraska]] (NE)\n* '''7''' = [[Arkansas]] (AR), [[Louisiana]] (LA), [[Oklahoma]] (OK), [[Texas]] (TX)\n* '''8''' = [[Arizona]] (AZ), [[Colorado]] (CO), [[Idaho]] (ID), [[New Mexico]] (NM), [[Nevada]] (NV), [[Utah]] (UT), [[Wyoming]] (WY)\n* ''' 9''' = [[Alaska]] (AK), [[American Samoa]] (AS), [[California]] (CA), [[Guam]] (GU), [[Hawaii]] (HI), [[Marshall Islands]] (MH), [[Federated States of Micronesia]] (FM), [[Northern Mariana Islands]] (MP), [[Oregon]] (OR), [[Palau]] (PW), [[Washington (state)|Washington]] (WA), Army Post Office Pacific (APO AP), Fleet Post Office Pacific (FPO AP)\n\n====Secondary regional prefixes (123xx) and local ZIP Codes (12345)====\n{{see also|List of ZIP Code prefixes}}\n[[File:10005 zip code.jpg|thumb|Early advertisement for ZIP Code 10005]]\n\nThe second and third digits represent the [[sectional center facility]] (SCF) (e.g. 477xx = [[Vanderburgh County, Indiana]]), and the fourth and fifth digits represent the area of the city (if in a [[metropolitan area]]), or a village/town (outside metro areas), e.g. 47722 (4=Indiana, 77=Vanderburgh County, 22=[[University of Evansville]] area). When a sectional center facility's area crosses state lines, that facility is assigned separate three-digit prefixes for the states that it serves.\n\nIn some urban areas, like 462 for [[Marion County, Indiana]], the three-digit prefix will often exist in one county, while, in rural and most suburban areas, the prefix will exist in multiple counties; for example, the neighboring 476 prefix is found in part or entirely in six counties: Gibson, Pike, Posey, Spencer, Vanderburgh, and Warrick. In some cases, an urban county may have more than one prefix. This is the case with Allen (467, 468), Lake (464, 463), St. Joseph (465, 466), and Vanderburgh (476, 477) counties. Cities like [[Chicago]], [[Houston]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[New York City]] have multiple prefixes within their city limits. In some cases, these may be served from the same SCF, such as in [[San Diego County, California]], where the three-digit prefixes 919 and 920 are used for suburban and rural communities, and 921 for the city of San Diego itself, although all three are processed through the same SCF facility.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\nDespite the geographic derivation of most ZIP Codes, the codes themselves do not represent geographic regions; in general, they correspond to address groups or delivery routes. As a consequence, ZIP Code \"areas\" can overlap, be subsets of each other, or be artificial constructs with no geographic area (such as 095 for mail to the Navy, which is not geographically fixed). In similar fashion, in areas without regular postal routes ([[Rural delivery service|rural route]] areas) or no mail delivery (undeveloped areas), ZIP Codes are not assigned or are based on sparse delivery routes, and hence the boundary between ZIP Code areas is undefined. For example, some residents in or near [[Haubstadt, Indiana]], which has the ZIP Code 47639, have mailing addresses with 47648, the ZIP Code for neighboring [[Fort Branch, Indiana]], while others living in or near Fort Branch have addresses with 47639. Many rural counties have similar logistical inconsistencies caused by the aforementioned sparse delivery routes, often known as Rural Routes or by some other similar designation.\n\nAlmost all [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] agencies in and around the capital are assigned ZIP Codes starting with 20200 to 20599, which are [[Washington, D.C.]] ZIP Codes, even if they are not located in Washington itself. While the [[White House]] itself is located in ZIP Code 20006, it has the ZIP Code 20500. The [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] is located in [[Rockville, Maryland]], at ZIP Code 20852, but has been assigned by the Postal Service the address \"Washington, DC 20555\".\n\nIn similar manner, the ZIP Code for the [[Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority]], a federally chartered independent authority, is 20001-6000,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://smartystreets.com/products/single-address?street=1%20Aviation%20Circle&street2=&city=Washington&state=DC&zipcode=&address-type=us-street-components|accessdate=Oct 4, 2017|title=Validated Address|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005052253/https://smartystreets.com/products/single-address?street=1%20Aviation%20Circle&street2=&city=Washington&state=DC&zipcode=&address-type=us-street-components|archive-date=October 5, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> even though the physical address of the Authority's office, \"1 Aviation Circle\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/1+Aviation+Cir,+Arlington,+VA+22202/@38.8581563,-77.0534496,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7b73acf70c431:0xff2dba050678f943!8m2!3d38.8581563!4d-77.0446949|accessdate=Oct 4, 2017|title = Google Maps}}</ref> is in [[Arlington, Virginia]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nOne current exception to this rule is the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO). When the USPTO was located in the [[Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia|Crystal City]] neighborhood in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]], it was assigned by the Postal Service the address \"Washington, DC 20231\" despite being physically located in ZIP Code 22202. However, the USPTO now uses ZIP Codes assigned to its current locations in [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. The patents side of the USPTO uses a PO box assigned the ZIP+4 code of 22313-1450 for all postal communications.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uspto.gov/patent/contact-patents/mailing-and-hand-carry-addresses-united-states-patent-and-trademark-office |title=Mailing and hand carry addresses |publisher=USPTO |accessdate=September 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919203519/https://www.uspto.gov/patent/contact-patents/mailing-and-hand-carry-addresses-united-states-patent-and-trademark-office |archive-date=September 19, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The trademarks side of the USPTO uses the same ZIP+4 code for most of its mail, but the office of the Commissioner for Trademarks has its own PO box with the ZIP+4 code of 22313-1451, and some offices within that part of the USPTO use the 22314 ZIP Code.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uspto.gov/trademark/contact-trademarks/addressing-trademark-mail |title=Addressing trademark mail |publisher=USPTO |accessdate=September 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180924070544/https://www.uspto.gov/trademark/contact-trademarks/addressing-trademark-mail |archive-date=September 24, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn rare circumstances, a locality is assigned a ZIP Code that does not match the rest of the state. In even rarer cases a ZIP Code may cross state lines. Usually, this occurs when the locality is so isolated that it is most conveniently served from a sectional center in another state. Examples:\n\n* [[Fishers Island]], New York, bears the ZIP Code 06390 and is served from Connecticut because the only ferry service is to Connecticut&nbsp;\u2013 all other New York ZIP Codes (excepting those at [[Holtsville, New York|Holtsville]] for the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]) begin with \"1\".\n* Returned government parcels from [[Washington, D.C.]] are sent to ZIP Codes beginning with \"569\" so that returned parcels are security checked at a remote facility (this was put into place after the [[2001 anthrax attacks]]).\n* Some Arkansas roads north of [[Bull Shoals Lake]] can best be accessed by the [[Protem, Missouri]] delivery unit (ZIP Code 65733), as they are accessible by road only through Missouri.\n* [[Fort Campbell]] (ZIP Code 42223), is primarily in Tennessee, but the main entrance is in Kentucky.\n* The [[Kentucky Bend]] geographical anomaly in far western Kentucky, where a small portion of land is separated from the rest of the state by a bend in the Mississippi river, shares ZIP Code 38079 with [[Tiptonville, Tennessee]].\n\n====Preferred place names: ZIP Codes and previous zoning lines====\n{{anchor|Zones}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}\n\nA ZIP Code's address and the city name written on the same line do not necessarily mean that address is within the boundaries of that city. The Postal Service designates one ''preferred'' place name for each ZIP Code. This may be an incorporated town or city, a subentity of a large city or an unincorporated [[census-designated place]], or a small [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]]. Additional place names may be recognized as ''acceptable'' for a certain ZIP Code. Still, others are deemed not acceptable, and if used may result in a delay in mail delivery.\n\n''Preferred'' place names are generally the city or town in which the address is located. However, for many cities that have incorporated since ZIP Codes were introduced, the city name is not the ''preferred'' place name. Many databases automatically assign the ''preferred'' place name for a ZIP Code, without regard to any ''acceptable'' place names. For example, [[Centennial, Colorado]] is divided among seven ZIP Codes assigned to [[Aurora, Colorado|Aurora]], [[Englewood, Colorado|Englewood]], or [[Littleton, Colorado|Littleton]] as its ''preferred'' place names; none of these seven ZIP Codes carries \"Centennial\" as a preferred name, and in the ZIP Code directory, Centennial addresses are listed under those three cities. Since it is acceptable to write \"Centennial\" in conjunction with any of the seven ZIP Codes, one can write \"Centennial\" in an address in Aurora, Englewood, or Littleton, as long as it is in one of the shared ZIP Codes.\n\n''Acceptable'' place names are usually added to a ZIP Code in cases where the ZIP Code boundaries divide them between two or more cities, as in the case of Centennial. However, in many cases, only the ''preferred'' name can be used, even when many addresses in the ZIP Code are in another city. People sometimes must use the name of a post office rather than their own city.\n\nOne extreme example is ZIP Code 85254; it was assigned the place name [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] because it is served by the Scottsdale post office, but 85% of its territory is inside the city limits of neighboring [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. Another notorious example is an entire neighborhood of the city of [[Los Angeles]] known as [[Beverly Hills Post Office]]. Naturally, its residents prefer the more glamorous [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] address and 90210 ZIP Code, but this regularly causes problems with an emergency response when dispatchers have to sort out whether a given home in 90210 is in Los Angeles or Beverly Hills.\n\nSimilarly, [[Missouri City, Texas]], straddles [[Harris County, Texas|Harris]] and [[Fort Bend County, Texas|Fort Bend]] counties. The portion within Harris County is within the ZIP Code 77071, which must use the city name of [[Houston]] instead of Missouri City. At the same time, a small portion of the city of Houston is in Fort Bend County in the ZIP Code 77489, and residents there must use the name ''Missouri City'' for their address even though they are in Houston.\n\nThis also occurs in some rural areas where portions of one town have their mail delivered to other post offices. For example, while most of the town of [[Plainfield, Massachusetts]] is in ZIP Code 01070, some sections of town are in the ZIP Code area for the neighboring town of [[Cummington, Massachusetts|Cummington]] with ZIP Code 01026. Only the ''preferred'' name of Cummington is allowed in ZIP Code 01026, so residents of parts of Plainfield must list their address as being in Cummington.\n\nThis phenomenon is repeated across the country. The previously mentioned [[Englewood, Colorado]] is an inner-ring suburb that was built out by the 1960s. Its post office served the area that is now the high-growth southern tier of the [[Denver-Aurora Metropolitan Area|Denver metropolitan area]], and ZIP Codes in this area were assigned Englewood as their ''preferred'' place name. A business community as large as downtown [[Denver]] has grown in this area, with headquarters for many internationally recognized corporations. These companies indicate Englewood as their location (the ''preferred'' postal place name), although they are located in other cities. As a result, there are really two Englewoods&nbsp;\u2013 the city, small and with a largely [[Working class|working-class]] residential population, and, a number of miles away, the postal Englewood, a vast suburban area of upscale subdivisions and office parks that have nothing to do with the city of Englewood yet share a split identity with it solely because of ZIP Codes. People who say they live or work in Englewood and identify closely with it may rarely enter the city. In [[Indiana]], the ZIP Code for a town usually indicates the ZIP Code for its corresponding township, as nearly all of Indiana's small town post offices have rural routes.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n''Acceptable'' place names also come into play in areas where citizens identify more strongly with a particular [[Urban Center|urban center]] than their own municipality. For example, [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]], has 130 distinct municipalities, yet many of the county's residents, and even some residents of adjacent counties, commonly use [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] as their postal address. On the opposite end of the spectrum, in some urban areas, neighborhood names may be acceptable even though they have no legal standing, such as [[La Jolla]], [[California]], which is the ''preferred'' place name for ZIP Code 92037, despite the fact that La Jolla is a district of [[San Diego]], California and not a separate legal entity. This ZIP Code is also in the 919/920 sequence used by San Diego County's suburban and rural areas, not in the 921 sequence used in the remainder of the City of San Diego, even though La Jolla has always been part of San Diego.\n\nMany ZIP Codes are for [[village]]s, [[census-designated place]]s, portions of cities, or other entities that are not municipalities. For example, ZIP Code 03750 is for [[Etna, New Hampshire]], but Etna is not a city or town; it is a [[Village (New Hampshire)|village district]] in the town of [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]], which itself is assigned the ZIP Code 03755. Another example is ZIP Code 08043, which corresponds to the census-designated place of [[Kirkwood, New Jersey]], but serves the entirety of [[Voorhees Township, New Jersey|Voorhees Township]]. This is also the case in [[LaGrange, New York]], a portion of which is served by the 12603 ZIP Code based in the neighboring [[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|town of Poughkeepsie]]. The rest of LaGrange is served by the LaGrangeville Post Office. LaGrangeville is itself not a town at all, but a section of LaGrange. [[Willow Grove, Pennsylvania]], served by the 19090 ZIP Code, is a village that straddles the border of [[Upper Moreland Township, Pennsylvania|Upper Moreland Township]] and [[Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Abington Township]], and that post office also serves a small portion of [[Upper Dublin Township, Pennsylvania|Upper Dublin Township]]. Furthermore, non-municipal place names may also share ZIP Codes with municipal place names. For example, [[West Windsor Township, New Jersey]], is commonly referred to in most mailing databases as [[Princeton Junction, New Jersey|Princeton Junction]], a census-designated place within West Windsor. [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], (20815, 20901\u201320912) is neither a city nor a town, but simply the common name for an unincorporated area consisting of a large part of the lower southern portion of [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]].\n\nPostal designations for place names become ''de facto'' locations for their addresses, and as a result, it is difficult to convince residents and businesses that they are located in another city or town different from the ''preferred'' place name associated with their ZIP Codes. Because of issues of confusion and lack of identity, some cities, such as [[Signal Hill, California]], (an [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]] located entirely inside the separate city of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]]) have successfully petitioned the Postal Service to change ZIP Code boundaries or create new ZIP Codes so their cities become the ''preferred'' place name for addresses within the ZIP Code.\n\nPostal designation confusion may have financial implications for local governments because mail volume is one factor used by the U.S. Census Bureau to estimate population changes between decennial census enumerations.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Sometimes local officials in a community that is not the ''preferred'' place name for a ZIP Code but is an ''acceptable'' place name will advise residents to always use the name of the community, because if the census estimate of that town's population is low they may receive fewer funds that are computed based on population. A typical example is [[Paddock Lake, Wisconsin]], whose ''preferred'' place name is [[Salem, Kenosha County, Wisconsin|Salem]]. Paddock Lake is incorporated as a village within the town of Salem, even though there are more people in the village of Paddock Lake than there are in the unincorporated parts of the town of Salem. Further confusion is caused because [[Silver Lake, Wisconsin]], which is also a village in the town of Salem and is of similar size and status to Paddock Lake, has its own ZIP Code and post office.\n\nIn another case, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) denied a [[radio station]] (now [[WNNX (FM)|WNNX]] FM) a move requiring a change in its [[city of license]] to [[Sandy Springs, Georgia|Sandy Springs]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], largely because it was not a city (until [[municipal incorporation]] in late 2005), despite being the seventh-largest place in the state by [[population]]. The FCC cited the use of \"[[Atlanta]]\" on letters of support from local organizations, even though the USPS forced them to use Atlanta for 30328 until well after incorporation took effect. Currently \"Sandy Springs\" is only ''acceptable'', despite none of 30328 being in Atlanta, or anywhere else outside the Sandy Springs [[city limit]]. This even applies to the ZIP Code used only for PO boxes at the Sandy Springs main post office.\n\nBecause ZIP Codes and their associated place names can ignore county lines, problems may occur where [[street address]]es are based on [[Address (geography)#Quadrants|quadrant]] location within a county. For example, the area served by 30339 straddles the [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb County]]\u2013[[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]] line in Georgia. The Cobb County portion of this area includes [[Vinings, Georgia|Vinings]] in the southeast of that county; the Fulton County portion lies within the city limits of Atlanta. Every street address in Vinings is labeled SE, and has a [[house number]] on the Cobb County grid (according to the distance from the [[town square]] in the [[county seat]] of [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]]). However, because the USPS demands the use of Atlanta, Vinings addresses are written such that they appear to be in southeast Atlanta, instead of in the opposite (northwest [[Atlanta metropolitan area|metro Atlanta]]) side.\n\n====Division and reallocation of ZIP Codes====\nLike [[Telephone numbering plan|area code]]s, ZIP Codes are sometimes divided and changed, especially when a [[rural]] area becomes [[suburb]]an. Typically, the new codes become effective once announced, and a grace period (e.g., one year) is provided in which the new and old codes are used concurrently so that postal patrons in the affected area can notify correspondents, order new stationery, etc.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Roberts |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/21/nyregion/21zip.html |title=An Elite ZIP Code Becomes Harder to Crack |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 21, 2007 |page= C15 |accessdate=July 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn rapidly growing communities, it is sometimes necessary to open a new sectional center facility, which must then be allocated its own three-digit ZIP-code prefix or prefixes. Such allocation can be done in various ways. For example, when a new sectional center facility was opened at [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Dulles Airport]] in Virginia, the prefix 201 was allocated to that facility; therefore, for all post offices to be served by that sectional center facility the ZIP Code changed from an old code beginning with 220 or 221 to a new code or codes beginning with 201. However, when a new sectional center facility was opened to serve [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], no new prefix was assigned. Instead, ZIP Codes in the 207 and 208 ranges, which had previously been assigned alphabetically, were reshuffled so that 207xx ZIP Codes in the county was changed to 208xx codes, while 208xx codes outside that county were changed to 207xx codes. Because [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]] (whose postal area includes [[Wheaton, Maryland|Wheaton]]) has its own prefix, 209, there was no need to apply the reshuffling to Silver Spring; instead, all mail going to 209xx ZIP Codes was simply rerouted to the new sectional center facility.\n\nOn the other hand, [[depopulation]] may cause a post office to close and its associated ZIP Code to be deallocated. For example, [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]]'s ZIP Code, 17927, was retired in 2002,<ref>{{cite news |first=Rob |last=Wheary |url=http://www.centraliapa.com/news.htm |title=Centralia loses its ZIP}}</ref> and ZIP Codes for [[Onoville, New York|Onoville]] (14764), [[Elko, New York|Quaker Bridge]] (14771) and [[Red House, New York|Red House]] (14773) in New York were prevented from going into use in 1964 in preparation for the [[Kinzua Dam]]'s completion.<ref name=postofficesclose>{{cite news|title=Post Offices to Close|newspaper=The Bradford Era|date=April 22, 1964}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Final Check-Out|newspaper=Salamanca Republican-Press|date=July 1, 1964}}</ref>\n\n[[Elkins Park, Pennsylvania]], was originally issued the 19117 ZIP Code, although it lies in [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania]]. Because of the 191 prefix, which is found only in [[Philadelphia]] apart from that lone exception, auto insurance companies charged higher city premiums to residents of that suburban location. For that reason, residents petitioned the USPS for a 190-prefix ZIP Code, which is common to the inner-ring Pennsylvania suburbs of that city, and, after several attempts that were initially disapproved by the USPS, Elkins Park was finally reassigned to the 19027 ZIP Code.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zip-codes.com/m/city/pa-elkins-park.asp|title=All Zip Codes in Elkins Park PA|website=www.zip-codes.com|access-date=2018-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127022555/https://www.zip-codes.com/m/city/pa-elkins-park.asp|archive-date=2018-11-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nZIP Codes also change when postal boundaries are realigned. For example, concurrent with the above-noted change in Montgomery County, Maryland, and under pressure from the then-mayor of [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Marion Barry]], the USPS realigned the postal boundaries between Washington, D.C. and [[Maryland]] to match the boundary. Previously, many inner suburbs, such as [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]] and [[Takoma Park, Maryland|Takoma Park]], [[Oxon Hill, Maryland|Oxon Hill]], [[Temple Hills, Maryland|Temple Hills]], [[Suitland, Maryland|Suitland]], and [[Capitol Heights, Maryland|Capitol Heights]] had been in the Washington, D.C., postal area. As a result of the change, ZIP Codes in Maryland beginning with 200 were changed to new ZIP Codes beginning with 207, 208, or 209, depending on their location, and ZIP Codes straddling the D.C.\u2013Maryland line were split. For example, 20016 (Bethesda) became 20816, while the Maryland portion of 20012 (Takoma Park) became 20912.\n\n== Other uses ==\n=== Delivery services ===\nDelivery services other than the USPS, such as [[FedEx]], [[United Parcel Service]], and [[DHL]], require a ZIP Code for optimal internal routing of a package.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://faq.usps.com/s/article/ZIP-Code-The-Basics|title=USPS.com FAQs|website=faq.usps.com|access-date=2019-02-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222151852/https://faq.usps.com/s/article/ZIP-Code-The-Basics|archive-date=2019-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Statistics ===\n{{As of|October 2019}}, there are 41,702 ZIP Codes in the United States.<ref name=\"ZIP Code Database - GreatData.com\">{{Cite web|title=U.S. ZIP Code Database|url=https://greatdata.com/product/zip-code-database|website=GreatData.com|access-date=21 October 2019|ref=ZIP Codes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191019150049/https://greatdata.com/product/zip-code-database|archive-date=19 October 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> ZIP Codes are used not only for tracking of mail, but also in gathering geographical statistics in the United States. The [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] calculates approximate boundaries of ZIP Codes areas, which it calls [[ZIP Code Tabulation Area]]s (ZCTAs). Statistical census data is then provided for these approximate areas. The geographic data provided for these areas includes the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of the center-point of the ZCTAs. There are approximately 32,000 ZCTAs. The reason that there is not one ZCTA for every ZIP Code is that PO Boxes are excluded, since only populated areas are included in the Census data.<ref>{{Cite web|title=U.S. Census Bureau data provided by GreatData.com|url=http://greatdata.com|access-date=5 February 2013}}</ref> The Census Bureau provides many statistical data sets for ZIP Codes, but does not keep up-to-date datasets of all ZCTAs. Complete datasets providing a similar approximate geographic extent are commercially available. ZIP Codes are inherently discrete or ''point-based'' data, as they are assigned only at the point of delivery, not for the spaces in between the delivery points. The United States Census Bureau then interpolates this discrete data set to create polygons, or areal features representing the approximate extent of the ZIP Code to use for mapping and data presentation. ZCTAs are not to be confused with ZIP Codes, and they are not updated as frequently as ZIP Codes. However, for many research and planning purposes, they are very useful and can be used with ZIP Code data.\n\n=== Marketing ===\nThe data is often used in [[Advertising mail|direct mail marketing]] campaigns in a process called ZIP-code marketing. [[Point of sale|Point-of-sale]] cashiers sometimes ask consumers for their home ZIP Codes. Besides providing purchasing-pattern data useful in determining the location of new business establishments, retailers can use directories to correlate this ZIP Code with the name on a credit card to obtain a consumer's full address and [[telephone number]]. ZIP-Coded data are also used in analyzing geographic factors in risk, an insurance and banking industry practice pejoratively known as [[redlining]]. This can cause problems, ''e.g.'', expensive insurance, for people living near a town with a high crime rate and sharing its ZIP Code, while they live in a relatively crime-free town. (See Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, above.)\n\nCalifornia outlawed this practice in 2011.<ref>{{Cite news | title=California high court: Retailers can not request cardholders' ZIP Code | url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/02/10/california.credit.zip.code/index.html | last=Botelho | first=Greg | publisher=CNN | date=February 10, 2011 | access-date=February 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Legislative districts ===\nZIP Codes may not currently be used to identify existing legislative districts. Although the website of the [[United States House of Representatives]] has a \"Find Your Representative\" feature that looks up congressional districts based on ZIP Codes alone, it often returns multiple districts corresponding to a single ZIP Code.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.house.gov/|title = The United States House of Representatives \u00b7 House.gov|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first =}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/|title = Find Your Representative \u00b7 House.gov|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first =}}</ref> This is because different parts of one ZIP Code can be in different districts.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/01/19/dont-use-zipcodes/|title = Sunlight Foundation|date = Jan 19, 2012|access-date = Aug 6, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140813005420/http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/01/19/dont-use-zipcodes/|archive-date = August 13, 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref> One proposal to eliminate the possibility of extreme partisan [[gerrymandering]] calls on using ZIP Codes as the basic units for redistricting.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Steelman |first1=Tyler |last2=Curiel |first2=John |title=Here's one way to end partisan gerrymandering: Don't break up Zip codes |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/10/22/heres-one-way-to-end-partisan-gerrymandering-dont-break-up-zip-codes/ |website=Monkey Cage blog |publisher=Washington Post |access-date=4 November 2018 |date=October 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Internet ===\nA 1978 proposal for a nationwide system of community networks suggested using ZIP Codes for [[routing]].<ref name=\"wilber197802\">{{Cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1978-02/1978_02_BYTE_03-02_Hardware_Projects#page/n15/mode/2up | title=CIE Net: A Design for a Network of Community Information Exchanges | work=BYTE | date=February 1978 | access-date=17 October 2013 | author=Wilber, Mike | page=12}}</ref>\n\nZIP Code data is an integral part of dealer / [[Online locator service|store locator]] software on many [[website]]s, especially [[Bricks and clicks|brick-and-click]] websites. This software processes a user-input ZIP Code and returns a list of store or business locations, usually in the order of increasing distance from the center of the input ZIP Code. As the ZIP Code system is confined to the U.S. Postal network, websites that require ZIP Codes cannot register customers outside the United States. Many sites will purchase postal code data of other countries or make allowances in cases where the ZIP Code is not recognized.\n\nZIP Codes are regularly used on the Internet to provide a location in situations where an exact address is not necessary (or desirable) but the user's municipality or general location is needed. Examples (in addition to the store locator example listed above) include weather forecasts, television listings, local news, and [[Online dating service|online dating]] (most general-purpose sites, by default, search within a specified [[radius]] of a given ZIP Code, based on other users' entered ZIP Codes).\n\n=== Credit card security ===\n{{Main|Address Verification System}}\nZIP Codes are used in credit card authorization, specifically [[Address Verification System]] (AVS). When a merchant collects the entire address, the ZIP Code is an important part of AVS. In some cases, the ZIP Code is the only thing used for AVS, specifically where collecting a signature, or other information is infeasible, such as [[pay at the pump]] or [[vending machine]]s.\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[J.

The USPOD issued its ''Publication 59: Abbreviations for Use with ZIP Code'' on October 1, 1963, with the list of [[List of U.S. state abbreviations|two-letter state abbreviations]] which are generally written with both letters capitalized.<ref name=USPS>[https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/state-abbreviations.pdf \"State Abbreviations\", USPS.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116005935/http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/state-abbreviations.pdf |date=2017-01-16 }}.</ref> An earlier list, publicized in June 1963, had proposed capitalized abbreviations ranging from two to five letters.<ref name=USPS/> According to ''Publication 59'', the two-letter standard was \"based on a maximum 23-position line, because this has been found to be the most universally acceptable line capacity basis for major addressing systems\",<ref name=USPS/> which would be exceeded by a long city name combined with a multi-letter state abbreviation, such as \"Sacramento, Calif.\" along with the ZIP Code.

An SCF is a central mail processing facility with those three digits. The fourth and fifth digits, which give a more precise locale within the SCF, were proposed by Henry Bentley Hahn, Sr.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archiveblog.jfklibrary.org/2015/05/papers-of-h-bentley-hahn-the-man-who-invented-the-zip-code/|title=Papers of H.

The mail is sorted according to the final two digits of the ZIP Code and sent to the corresponding post offices in the early morning. Sectional centers do not deliver mail and are not open to the public (although the building may include a post office that is open to the public), and most of their employees work the [[shift work|night shift]]. Items of mail picked up at post offices are sent to their own SCFs in the afternoon, where the mail is sorted overnight. In the case of large cities, the last two digits as assigned generally coincided with the older postal zone number.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor example:\n\n<blockquote><poem>Mr. John Smith\n3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue\nMinneapolis, MN{{nbsp}}{{nbsp}}554''16''</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn 1967, these became mandatory for second- and third-class [[bulk mail]]ers, and the system was soon adopted generally. The United States Post Office used a [[cartoon character]], which it called [[Mr. ZIP]], to promote the use of the ZIP Code. He was often depicted with a legend such as \"USE ZIP CODE\" in the [[selvage]] of panes of [[postage stamp]]s or on the covers of booklet panes of stamps.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1971, Elmira (NY) ''[[Star-Gazette]]'' reporter Dick Baumbach found out the White House was not using a ZIP Code on its envelopes.

A ZIP+4 Code uses the basic five-digit code plus four additional digits to identify a geographic segment within the five-digit delivery area, such as a [[city block]], a group of apartments, an individual high-volume receiver of mail, a post office box, or any other unit that could use an extra identifier to aid in efficient mail sorting and delivery. However, initial attempts to promote universal use of the new format met with public resistance and today the plus-four code is not required.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhistory.com/zip-code-history.html|title=Organizing America: A History of the ZIP Code|last=|first=|date=25 July 2014|website=RandomHistory.com|publisher=Random History|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812203838/http://www.randomhistory.com/zip-code-history.html|archive-date=12 August 2014|accessdate=19 June 2017}}</ref> In general, mail is read by a [[Multiline Optical Character Reader|multiline optical character reader]] (MLOCR) that almost instantly determines the correct ZIP+4 Code from the address\u2014along with the even more specific [[delivery point]]\u2014and sprays an [[Intelligent Mail barcode]] (IM) on the face of the mail piece that corresponds to 11 digits\u2014nine for the ZIP+4 Code and two for the delivery point.\n\nFor [[Post office box|Post Office Boxes]], the general (but not invariable) rule is that each box has its own ZIP+4 code. The add-on code is often one of the following: the last four digits of the box number (e.g. PO Box 107050, Albany, NY 12201-7050), zero plus the last three digits of the box number (e.g., PO Box 17727, Eagle River, AK 99577-0727), or, if the box number consists of fewer than four digits, enough zeros are attached to the front of the box number to produce a four-digit number (e.g., PO Box 77, Juneau, AK 99750-0077). However, there is no uniform rule, so the ZIP+4 Code must be looked up individually for each box{{citation needed |date=October 2017}} (e.g. using the USPS's official ZIP Code Lookup tool, and being sure to enter just city and state, not the 5-digit ZIP).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction_input |title=ZIP Code\u2122 Lookup {{!}} USPS |website=tools.usps.com |access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\n===Postal bar code===\nThe ZIP Code is often translated into an Intelligent Mail barcode that is printed on the mailpiece to make it easier for automated machines to sort. A barcode can be printed by the sender (some word-processing programs such as [[WordPerfect]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kb.iu.edu/data/aapk.html |title=Archived: How can I print routing barcodes on envelopes? - Knowledge Base |publisher=The Trustees of Indiana University |accessdate=July 10, 2009}}</ref> include the feature), but this is not recommended, as the address-to-ZIP lookup tables can be significantly out of date. It is better to let the post office put one on when it processes the piece.{{citation needed|date = November 2018}} In general, the post office uses [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] technology, though in some cases a human might have to read and enter the address.{{citation needed|date = November 2018}}\n\nCustomers who send [[bulk mail]] can get a [[discounts and allowances|discount]] on [[postage]] if they have printed the barcode themselves and have presorted the mail. This requires more than just a simple [[typeface|font]]; [[mailing list]]s must be standardized with up-to-date [[Coding Accuracy Support System]] (CASS)-certified software that adds and verifies a full, correct ZIP+4 Code and an additional two [[Numerical digit|digit]]s representing the exact [[delivery point]].{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Furthermore, mail must be sorted in a specific manner to an 11-digit code with at least 150 mailpieces for each qualifying ZIP Code and must be accompanied by documentation confirming this. These steps are usually done with PAVE-certified software that also prints the barcoded address labels and the barcoded sack or tray tags.{{citation needed|date = November 2018}}\n\nThe assignment of delivery point digits (the 10th and 11th digits) is intended to ensure that every single mailable point in the country has its own 12-digit number. The delivery-point digits are calculated based on the primary or secondary number of the address. The USPS publishes the rules for calculating the delivery point in a document called the CASS Technical Guide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ribbs.usps.gov/files/CASS/TECHNICAL_GUIDES/CASSTECH.PDF#page=40 |format=PDF |title=CASS Technical Guide |publisher=United States Postal Service |page=40 |accessdate=July 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419090333/http://ribbs.usps.gov/files/CASS/TECHNICAL_GUIDES/CASSTECH.PDF#page=40 |archivedate=April 19, 2009 }}</ref> However, when confronted with two addresses like 18 and 18C, often CASS will assign the same 12-digit number to two distinct mail delivery points. The last digit is always a [[check digit]], which is obtained by summing all 5, 9 or 11 digits, taking the [[modular arithmetic|residue]] modulo 10 of this sum (i.e., the remainder after dividing by 10) and finally subtracting this from 10. (Thus, the check digit for 10001-0001 00 would be 7, since 1+1+1=3, 3\u22613(mod 10) and 10\u20133=7.){{citation needed|date = November 2018}}\n\n==Structure and allocation==\n===Scope and international mail===\nZIP Codes designate [[delivery point]]s within the United States (and its territories). There are generally no ZIP Codes for deliveries to other countries, except for the independent countries of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]], and the [[Republic of Palau]], each of which is integrated into the U.S. postal system under a [[Compact of Free Association]]. Another exception are ZIP Codes used for overseas stations of USA armed forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/28c2_010.htm|title=Military Addresses|publisher=[[United States Postal Service]] |accessdate=December 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nMail to [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|U.S. diplomatic missions]] overseas is addressed as if it were addressed to a street address in [[Washington, D.C.]] The four-digit [[diplomatic pouch]] number is used as a building number, while the city in which the embassy or consulate is located is combined with the word \"Place\" to form a street name. Each mission uses a ZIP+4 Code consisting of '''20521''' and the diplomatic pouch number. For example, the mailing address of the U.S. Embassy in [[New Delhi]], [[India]] would be:\n\n<blockquote><poem>Embassy of the United States of America\n9000 New Delhi Place\nWashington, DC{{nbsp}}{{nbsp}}20521-9000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/m/a/c8028.htm |title=Mail Management| publisher=Diplomatic Pouch and Mail Division of the U.S. Department of State |accessdate=April 1, 2015}}</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\nHowever, individuals posted at diplomatic missions overseas are now assigned a Diplomatic Post Office address and unique box number. The Zip Code identifies the diplomatic mission destination and is different from the diplomatic pouch number in the example above. While delivered through the pouch system, mail to such addresses are not considered \"Diplomatic Pouch\" materials, and as such must adhere to the mailing regulations of the host country. An example address is:\n\n<blockquote><poem>JOHN ADAMS\nUNIT 8400 BOX 0000\nDPO AE{{nbsp}}{{nbsp}}09498-0048<ref>{{cite web |title=Military & Diplomatic Mail {{!}} USPS |url=https://www.usps.com/ship/apo-fpo-dpo.htm |website=www.usps.com |accessdate=8 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819001108/https://www.usps.com/ship/apo-fpo-dpo.htm |archive-date=19 August 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\n===By type and use===\nThere are four types of ZIP Codes:\n\n* Unique: assigned to a single high-volume address\n* Post Office Box-only: used only for PO Boxes at a given facility, not for any other type of delivery\n* Military: used to route mail for the U.S. military\n* Standard: all other ZIP Codes.\n\nUnique ZIP Codes are used for governmental agencies, universities, businesses, or buildings that receive such extremely high volumes of mail that they need their own ZIP Codes. Government examples include 20505 for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in Washington, D.C.; 81009 for the [[Federal Citizen Information Center]] of the [[U.S. General Services Administration]] (GSA)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/aboutus.htm |title=FCIC&nbsp;&ndash; About Us |publisher=Federal Citizen Information Center of the U.S. General Services Administration |accessdate=July 10, 2009 |quote=For years, consumers have written to Pueblo, Colorado 81009 for timely, practical information they trust. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714061028/http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/aboutus.htm |archivedate=July 14, 2009 }}</ref> in [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. Examples of private address unique ZIP Codes include the headquarters of [[Walmart]] (72716).<!-- NOTE: Please do not add more examples; these suffice. -->\n\nAn example of a PO Box-only ZIP Code is 22313, which is used for PO Boxes at the main post office in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], such as those used by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]. In the area surrounding that post office, home and business mail delivery addresses use ZIP Code 22314, which is thus a Standard ZIP Code.\n\nIn certain exceptional cases, a nominally Standard-type ZIP Code may, in practice, be used as one of the three other types.  For example, the ZIP Code 43210 in [[Columbus, Ohio]] is listed as a Standard-type ZIP Code.  However, since its geographic boundaries are essentially coterminous with those of the [[Ohio State University]]'s main campus, it is effectively exclusive to the university even though it is not officially a \"Unique\"-type ZIP Code.\n\n===By geography===\n====Primary state prefixes====\nZIP Codes are numbered with the first digit representing a certain group of [[U.S. state]]s, the second and third digits together representing a [[region]] in that group (or perhaps a large city) and the fourth and fifth digits representing a group of delivery addresses within that region. The main town in a region (if applicable) often gets the first ZIP Codes for that region; afterward, the numerical order often follows the alphabetical order.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Because ZIP Codes are intended for efficient postal delivery, there are unusual cases where a ZIP Code crosses state boundaries, such as a military facility spanning multiple states or remote areas of one state most easily serviced from a bordering state. For example, ZIP Code 42223 serves [[Fort Campbell]], which spans [[Christian County, Kentucky]], and [[Montgomery County, Tennessee]], and ZIP Code 97635 includes portions of [[Lake County, Oregon]], and [[Modoc County, California]].\n\nIn general, the first three digits designate a [[sectional center facility]], the mail sorting and distribution center for an area. A sectional center facility may have more than one three-digit code assigned to it. For example, the Northern Virginia sectional center facility in [[Merrifield, Virginia|Merrifield]] is assigned codes 220, 221, 222, and 223. In some cases, a sectional center facility may serve an area in an adjacent state, usually due to the lack of a proper location for a center in that region. For example, 739 in [[Oklahoma]] is assigned to [[Liberal, Kansas]]; 865 in [[Arizona]] is assigned to [[Gallup, New Mexico]]; and 961 in [[California]] to [[Reno, Nevada]].\n\nIn terms of geographic location, many of the lowest ZIP Codes, which begin with&nbsp;'0', are in the [[New England]] region. Also in the '0' region are [[New Jersey]] (non-contiguous with the remainder of the '0' area), [[Puerto Rico]], the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], and [[APO/FPO]] military addresses for personnel stationed in [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Southwest Asia]], and aboard vessels based in the waters adjoining those lands. The lowest ZIP Code is in [[Holtsville, New York]] (00501, a ZIP Code exclusively for the [[U.S. Internal Revenue Service]] center there).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://facts.usps.com/map/#fact147 |title=USPS Postal Facts |publisher=facts.usps.com |date=2018-02-15 |accessdate=2018-05-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819070643/https://facts.usps.com/map/#fact147 |archive-date=2018-08-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other low ZIP Codes are 00601 for [[Adjuntas, Puerto Rico]]; 01001 for [[Agawam, Massachusetts]], and the zip codes 01002 and 01003 for [[Amherst, Massachusetts]]; 01002 is used for mail in town, while 01003 is reserved for the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. Until 2001, there were six ZIP Codes lower than 00501 that were numbered from 00210 to 00215 (located in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]]) and were used by the [[Diversity Immigrant Visa]] program to receive applications from non-U.S. citizens.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nThe numbers increase southward along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], such as 02115 ([[Boston]]), 10001 ([[New York City]]), 19103 ([[Philadelphia]]), 21201 ([[Baltimore]]), 20008 ([[Washington, D.C.]]), 30303 ([[Atlanta]]), and 33130 ([[Miami]]) (these are only examples, as each of these cities contain several ZIP Codes in the same range). From there, the numbers increase heading westward and northward east of the [[Mississippi River]], southward west of the Mississippi River, and northward on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. For example, 40202 is in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], 50309 in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], 60601 in [[Chicago]], 63101 in [[St. Louis]], 77036 in [[Houston]], 80202 in [[Denver]], 94111 in [[San Francisco]], 98101 in [[Seattle]], and 99950 in [[Ketchikan, Alaska]] (the highest ZIP Code).\n\n[[File:ZIP_Code_zones.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|ZIP Code zones in the United States]]\n\nThe first digit of the ZIP Code is allocated as follows:\n\n* '''0''' = [[Connecticut]] (CT), [[Massachusetts]] (MA), [[Maine]] (ME), [[New Hampshire]] (NH), [[New Jersey]] (NJ), [[New York (state)|New York]] (NY, [[Fishers Island, New York|Fishers Island only]]), [[Puerto Rico]] (PR), [[Rhode Island]] (RI), [[Vermont]] (VT), [[Virgin Islands]] (VI), Army Post Office Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East (APO AE); Fleet Post Office Europe and the Middle East (FPO AE)\n* '''1''' = [[Delaware]] (DE), [[New York (state)|New York]] (NY), [[Pennsylvania]] (PA)\n* '''2''' = [[District of Columbia]] (DC), [[Maryland]] (MD), [[North Carolina]] (NC), [[South Carolina]] (SC), [[Virginia]] (VA), [[West Virginia]] (WV)\n* '''3''' = [[Alabama]] (AL), [[Florida]] (FL), [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (GA), [[Mississippi]] (MS), [[Tennessee]] (TN), Army Post Office Americas (APO AA), Fleet Post Office Americas (FPO AA)\n* '''4''' = [[Indiana]] (IN), [[Kentucky]] (KY), [[Michigan]] (MI), [[Ohio]] (OH)\n* '''5''' = [[Iowa]] (IA), [[Minnesota]] (MN), [[Montana]] (MT), [[North Dakota]] (ND), [[South Dakota]] (SD), [[Wisconsin]] (WI)\n* ''' 6''' = [[Illinois]] (IL), [[Kansas]] (KS), [[Missouri]] (MO), [[Nebraska]] (NE)\n* '''7''' = [[Arkansas]] (AR), [[Louisiana]] (LA), [[Oklahoma]] (OK), [[Texas]] (TX)\n* '''8''' = [[Arizona]] (AZ), [[Colorado]] (CO), [[Idaho]] (ID), [[New Mexico]] (NM), [[Nevada]] (NV), [[Utah]] (UT), [[Wyoming]] (WY)\n* ''' 9''' = [[Alaska]] (AK), [[American Samoa]] (AS), [[California]] (CA), [[Guam]] (GU), [[Hawaii]] (HI), [[Marshall Islands]] (MH), [[Federated States of Micronesia]] (FM), [[Northern Mariana Islands]] (MP), [[Oregon]] (OR), [[Palau]] (PW), [[Washington (state)|Washington]] (WA), Army Post Office Pacific (APO AP), Fleet Post Office Pacific (FPO AP)\n\n====Secondary regional prefixes (123xx) and local ZIP Codes (12345)====\n{{see also|List of ZIP Code prefixes}}\n[[File:10005 zip code.jpg|thumb|Early advertisement for ZIP Code 10005]]\n\nThe second and third digits represent the [[sectional center facility]] (SCF) (e.g. 477xx = [[Vanderburgh County, Indiana]]), and the fourth and fifth digits represent the area of the city (if in a [[metropolitan area]]), or a village/town (outside metro areas), e.g. 47722 (4=Indiana, 77=Vanderburgh County, 22=[[University of Evansville]] area). When a sectional center facility's area crosses state lines, that facility is assigned separate three-digit prefixes for the states that it serves.\n\nIn some urban areas, like 462 for [[Marion County, Indiana]], the three-digit prefix will often exist in one county, while, in rural and most suburban areas, the prefix will exist in multiple counties; for example, the neighboring 476 prefix is found in part or entirely in six counties: Gibson, Pike, Posey, Spencer, Vanderburgh, and Warrick. In some cases, an urban county may have more than one prefix. This is the case with Allen (467, 468), Lake (464, 463), St. Joseph (465, 466), and Vanderburgh (476, 477) counties. Cities like [[Chicago]], [[Houston]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[New York City]] have multiple prefixes within their city limits. In some cases, these may be served from the same SCF, such as in [[San Diego County, California]], where the three-digit prefixes 919 and 920 are used for suburban and rural communities, and 921 for the city of San Diego itself, although all three are processed through the same SCF facility.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\nDespite the geographic derivation of most ZIP Codes, the codes themselves do not represent geographic regions; in general, they correspond to address groups or delivery routes. As a consequence, ZIP Code \"areas\" can overlap, be subsets of each other, or be artificial constructs with no geographic area (such as 095 for mail to the Navy, which is not geographically fixed). In similar fashion, in areas without regular postal routes ([[Rural delivery service|rural route]] areas) or no mail delivery (undeveloped areas), ZIP Codes are not assigned or are based on sparse delivery routes, and hence the boundary between ZIP Code areas is undefined. For example, some residents in or near [[Haubstadt, Indiana]], which has the ZIP Code 47639, have mailing addresses with 47648, the ZIP Code for neighboring [[Fort Branch, Indiana]], while others living in or near Fort Branch have addresses with 47639. Many rural counties have similar logistical inconsistencies caused by the aforementioned sparse delivery routes, often known as Rural Routes or by some other similar designation.\n\nAlmost all [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] agencies in and around the capital are assigned ZIP Codes starting with 20200 to 20599, which are [[Washington, D.C.]] ZIP Codes, even if they are not located in Washington itself. While the [[White House]] itself is located in ZIP Code 20006, it has the ZIP Code 20500. The [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] is located in [[Rockville, Maryland]], at ZIP Code 20852, but has been assigned by the Postal Service the address \"Washington, DC 20555\".\n\nIn similar manner, the ZIP Code for the [[Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority]], a federally chartered independent authority, is 20001-6000,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://smartystreets.com/products/single-address?street=1%20Aviation%20Circle&street2=&city=Washington&state=DC&zipcode=&address-type=us-street-components|accessdate=Oct 4, 2017|title=Validated Address|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005052253/https://smartystreets.com/products/single-address?street=1%20Aviation%20Circle&street2=&city=Washington&state=DC&zipcode=&address-type=us-street-components|archive-date=October 5, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> even though the physical address of the Authority's office, \"1 Aviation Circle\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/1+Aviation+Cir,+Arlington,+VA+22202/@38.8581563,-77.0534496,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7b73acf70c431:0xff2dba050678f943!8m2!3d38.8581563!4d-77.0446949|accessdate=Oct 4, 2017|title = Google Maps}}</ref> is in [[Arlington, Virginia]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nOne current exception to this rule is the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO). When the USPTO was located in the [[Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia|Crystal City]] neighborhood in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]], it was assigned by the Postal Service the address \"Washington, DC 20231\" despite being physically located in ZIP Code 22202. However, the USPTO now uses ZIP Codes assigned to its current locations in [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. The patents side of the USPTO uses a PO box assigned the ZIP+4 code of 22313-1450 for all postal communications.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uspto.gov/patent/contact-patents/mailing-and-hand-carry-addresses-united-states-patent-and-trademark-office |title=Mailing and hand carry addresses |publisher=USPTO |accessdate=September 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919203519/https://www.uspto.gov/patent/contact-patents/mailing-and-hand-carry-addresses-united-states-patent-and-trademark-office |archive-date=September 19, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The trademarks side of the USPTO uses the same ZIP+4 code for most of its mail, but the office of the Commissioner for Trademarks has its own PO box with the ZIP+4 code of 22313-1451, and some offices within that part of the USPTO use the 22314 ZIP Code.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uspto.gov/trademark/contact-trademarks/addressing-trademark-mail |title=Addressing trademark mail |publisher=USPTO |accessdate=September 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180924070544/https://www.uspto.gov/trademark/contact-trademarks/addressing-trademark-mail |archive-date=September 24, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn rare circumstances, a locality is assigned a ZIP Code that does not match the rest of the state. In even rarer cases a ZIP Code may cross state lines. Usually, this occurs when the locality is so isolated that it is most conveniently served from a sectional center in another state. Examples:\n\n* [[Fishers Island]], New York, bears the ZIP Code 06390 and is served from Connecticut because the only ferry service is to Connecticut&nbsp;\u2013 all other New York ZIP Codes (excepting those at [[Holtsville, New York|Holtsville]] for the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]) begin with \"1\".\n* Returned government parcels from [[Washington, D.C.]] are sent to ZIP Codes beginning with \"569\" so that returned parcels are security checked at a remote facility (this was put into place after the [[2001 anthrax attacks]]).\n* Some Arkansas roads north of [[Bull Shoals Lake]] can best be accessed by the [[Protem, Missouri]] delivery unit (ZIP Code 65733), as they are accessible by road only through Missouri.\n* [[Fort Campbell]] (ZIP Code 42223), is primarily in Tennessee, but the main entrance is in Kentucky.\n* The [[Kentucky Bend]] geographical anomaly in far western Kentucky, where a small portion of land is separated from the rest of the state by a bend in the Mississippi river, shares ZIP Code 38079 with [[Tiptonville, Tennessee]].\n\n====Preferred place names: ZIP Codes and previous zoning lines====\n{{anchor|Zones}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}\n\nA ZIP Code's address and the city name written on the same line do not necessarily mean that address is within the boundaries of that city. The Postal Service designates one ''preferred'' place name for each ZIP Code. This may be an incorporated town or city, a subentity of a large city or an unincorporated [[census-designated place]], or a small [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]]. Additional place names may be recognized as ''acceptable'' for a certain ZIP Code. Still, others are deemed not acceptable, and if used may result in a delay in mail delivery.\n\n''Preferred'' place names are generally the city or town in which the address is located. However, for many cities that have incorporated since ZIP Codes were introduced, the city name is not the ''preferred'' place name. Many databases automatically assign the ''preferred'' place name for a ZIP Code, without regard to any ''acceptable'' place names. For example, [[Centennial, Colorado]] is divided among seven ZIP Codes assigned to [[Aurora, Colorado|Aurora]], [[Englewood, Colorado|Englewood]], or [[Littleton, Colorado|Littleton]] as its ''preferred'' place names; none of these seven ZIP Codes carries \"Centennial\" as a preferred name, and in the ZIP Code directory, Centennial addresses are listed under those three cities. Since it is acceptable to write \"Centennial\" in conjunction with any of the seven ZIP Codes, one can write \"Centennial\" in an address in Aurora, Englewood, or Littleton, as long as it is in one of the shared ZIP Codes.\n\n''Acceptable'' place names are usually added to a ZIP Code in cases where the ZIP Code boundaries divide them between two or more cities, as in the case of Centennial. However, in many cases, only the ''preferred'' name can be used, even when many addresses in the ZIP Code are in another city. People sometimes must use the name of a post office rather than their own city.\n\nOne extreme example is ZIP Code 85254; it was assigned the place name [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] because it is served by the Scottsdale post office, but 85% of its territory is inside the city limits of neighboring [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. Another notorious example is an entire neighborhood of the city of [[Los Angeles]] known as [[Beverly Hills Post Office]]. Naturally, its residents prefer the more glamorous [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] address and 90210 ZIP Code, but this regularly causes problems with an emergency response when dispatchers have to sort out whether a given home in 90210 is in Los Angeles or Beverly Hills.\n\nSimilarly, [[Missouri City, Texas]], straddles [[Harris County, Texas|Harris]] and [[Fort Bend County, Texas|Fort Bend]] counties. The portion within Harris County is within the ZIP Code 77071, which must use the city name of [[Houston]] instead of Missouri City. At the same time, a small portion of the city of Houston is in Fort Bend County in the ZIP Code 77489, and residents there must use the name ''Missouri City'' for their address even though they are in Houston.\n\nThis also occurs in some rural areas where portions of one town have their mail delivered to other post offices. For example, while most of the town of [[Plainfield, Massachusetts]] is in ZIP Code 01070, some sections of town are in the ZIP Code area for the neighboring town of [[Cummington, Massachusetts|Cummington]] with ZIP Code 01026. Only the ''preferred'' name of Cummington is allowed in ZIP Code 01026, so residents of parts of Plainfield must list their address as being in Cummington.\n\nThis phenomenon is repeated across the country. The previously mentioned [[Englewood, Colorado]] is an inner-ring suburb that was built out by the 1960s. Its post office served the area that is now the high-growth southern tier of the [[Denver-Aurora Metropolitan Area|Denver metropolitan area]], and ZIP Codes in this area were assigned Englewood as their ''preferred'' place name. A business community as large as downtown [[Denver]] has grown in this area, with headquarters for many internationally recognized corporations. These companies indicate Englewood as their location (the ''preferred'' postal place name), although they are located in other cities. As a result, there are really two Englewoods&nbsp;\u2013 the city, small and with a largely [[Working class|working-class]] residential population, and, a number of miles away, the postal Englewood, a vast suburban area of upscale subdivisions and office parks that have nothing to do with the city of Englewood yet share a split identity with it solely because of ZIP Codes. People who say they live or work in Englewood and identify closely with it may rarely enter the city. In [[Indiana]], the ZIP Code for a town usually indicates the ZIP Code for its corresponding township, as nearly all of Indiana's small town post offices have rural routes.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n''Acceptable'' place names also come into play in areas where citizens identify more strongly with a particular [[Urban Center|urban center]] than their own municipality. For example, [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]], has 130 distinct municipalities, yet many of the county's residents, and even some residents of adjacent counties, commonly use [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] as their postal address. On the opposite end of the spectrum, in some urban areas, neighborhood names may be acceptable even though they have no legal standing, such as [[La Jolla]], [[California]], which is the ''preferred'' place name for ZIP Code 92037, despite the fact that La Jolla is a district of [[San Diego]], California and not a separate legal entity. This ZIP Code is also in the 919/920 sequence used by San Diego County's suburban and rural areas, not in the 921 sequence used in the remainder of the City of San Diego, even though La Jolla has always been part of San Diego.\n\nMany ZIP Codes are for [[village]]s, [[census-designated place]]s, portions of cities, or other entities that are not municipalities. For example, ZIP Code 03750 is for [[Etna, New Hampshire]], but Etna is not a city or town; it is a [[Village (New Hampshire)|village district]] in the town of [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]], which itself is assigned the ZIP Code 03755. Another example is ZIP Code 08043, which corresponds to the census-designated place of [[Kirkwood, New Jersey]], but serves the entirety of [[Voorhees Township, New Jersey|Voorhees Township]]. This is also the case in [[LaGrange, New York]], a portion of which is served by the 12603 ZIP Code based in the neighboring [[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|town of Poughkeepsie]]. The rest of LaGrange is served by the LaGrangeville Post Office. LaGrangeville is itself not a town at all, but a section of LaGrange. [[Willow Grove, Pennsylvania]], served by the 19090 ZIP Code, is a village that straddles the border of [[Upper Moreland Township, Pennsylvania|Upper Moreland Township]] and [[Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Abington Township]], and that post office also serves a small portion of [[Upper Dublin Township, Pennsylvania|Upper Dublin Township]]. Furthermore, non-municipal place names may also share ZIP Codes with municipal place names. For example, [[West Windsor Township, New Jersey]], is commonly referred to in most mailing databases as [[Princeton Junction, New Jersey|Princeton Junction]], a census-designated place within West Windsor. [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], (20815, 20901\u201320912) is neither a city nor a town, but simply the common name for an unincorporated area consisting of a large part of the lower southern portion of [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]].\n\nPostal designations for place names become ''de facto'' locations for their addresses, and as a result, it is difficult to convince residents and businesses that they are located in another city or town different from the ''preferred'' place name associated with their ZIP Codes. Because of issues of confusion and lack of identity, some cities, such as [[Signal Hill, California]], (an [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]] located entirely inside the separate city of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]]) have successfully petitioned the Postal Service to change ZIP Code boundaries or create new ZIP Codes so their cities become the ''preferred'' place name for addresses within the ZIP Code.\n\nPostal designation confusion may have financial implications for local governments because mail volume is one factor used by the U.S. Census Bureau to estimate population changes between decennial census enumerations.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Sometimes local officials in a community that is not the ''preferred'' place name for a ZIP Code but is an ''acceptable'' place name will advise residents to always use the name of the community, because if the census estimate of that town's population is low they may receive fewer funds that are computed based on population. A typical example is [[Paddock Lake, Wisconsin]], whose ''preferred'' place name is [[Salem, Kenosha County, Wisconsin|Salem]]. Paddock Lake is incorporated as a village within the town of Salem, even though there are more people in the village of Paddock Lake than there are in the unincorporated parts of the town of Salem. Further confusion is caused because [[Silver Lake, Wisconsin]], which is also a village in the town of Salem and is of similar size and status to Paddock Lake, has its own ZIP Code and post office.\n\nIn another case, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) denied a [[radio station]] (now [[WNNX (FM)|WNNX]] FM) a move requiring a change in its [[city of license]] to [[Sandy Springs, Georgia|Sandy Springs]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], largely because it was not a city (until [[municipal incorporation]] in late 2005), despite being the seventh-largest place in the state by [[population]]. The FCC cited the use of \"[[Atlanta]]\" on letters of support from local organizations, even though the USPS forced them to use Atlanta for 30328 until well after incorporation took effect. Currently \"Sandy Springs\" is only ''acceptable'', despite none of 30328 being in Atlanta, or anywhere else outside the Sandy Springs [[city limit]]. This even applies to the ZIP Code used only for PO boxes at the Sandy Springs main post office.\n\nBecause ZIP Codes and their associated place names can ignore county lines, problems may occur where [[street address]]es are based on [[Address (geography)#Quadrants|quadrant]] location within a county. For example, the area served by 30339 straddles the [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb County]]\u2013[[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]] line in Georgia. The Cobb County portion of this area includes [[Vinings, Georgia|Vinings]] in the southeast of that county; the Fulton County portion lies within the city limits of Atlanta. Every street address in Vinings is labeled SE, and has a [[house number]] on the Cobb County grid (according to the distance from the [[town square]] in the [[county seat]] of [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]]). However, because the USPS demands the use of Atlanta, Vinings addresses are written such that they appear to be in southeast Atlanta, instead of in the opposite (northwest [[Atlanta metropolitan area|metro Atlanta]]) side.\n\n====Division and reallocation of ZIP Codes====\nLike [[Telephone numbering plan|area code]]s, ZIP Codes are sometimes divided and changed, especially when a [[rural]] area becomes [[suburb]]an. Typically, the new codes become effective once announced, and a grace period (e.g., one year) is provided in which the new and old codes are used concurrently so that postal patrons in the affected area can notify correspondents, order new stationery, etc.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Roberts |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/21/nyregion/21zip.html |title=An Elite ZIP Code Becomes Harder to Crack |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 21, 2007 |page= C15 |accessdate=July 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn rapidly growing communities, it is sometimes necessary to open a new sectional center facility, which must then be allocated its own three-digit ZIP-code prefix or prefixes. Such allocation can be done in various ways. For example, when a new sectional center facility was opened at [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Dulles Airport]] in Virginia, the prefix 201 was allocated to that facility; therefore, for all post offices to be served by that sectional center facility the ZIP Code changed from an old code beginning with 220 or 221 to a new code or codes beginning with 201. However, when a new sectional center facility was opened to serve [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], no new prefix was assigned. Instead, ZIP Codes in the 207 and 208 ranges, which had previously been assigned alphabetically, were reshuffled so that 207xx ZIP Codes in the county was changed to 208xx codes, while 208xx codes outside that county were changed to 207xx codes. Because [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]] (whose postal area includes [[Wheaton, Maryland|Wheaton]]) has its own prefix, 209, there was no need to apply the reshuffling to Silver Spring; instead, all mail going to 209xx ZIP Codes was simply rerouted to the new sectional center facility.\n\nOn the other hand, [[depopulation]] may cause a post office to close and its associated ZIP Code to be deallocated. For example, [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]]'s ZIP Code, 17927, was retired in 2002,<ref>{{cite news |first=Rob |last=Wheary |url=http://www.centraliapa.com/news.htm |title=Centralia loses its ZIP}}</ref> and ZIP Codes for [[Onoville, New York|Onoville]] (14764), [[Elko, New York|Quaker Bridge]] (14771) and [[Red House, New York|Red House]] (14773) in New York were prevented from going into use in 1964 in preparation for the [[Kinzua Dam]]'s completion.<ref name=postofficesclose>{{cite news|title=Post Offices to Close|newspaper=The Bradford Era|date=April 22, 1964}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Final Check-Out|newspaper=Salamanca Republican-Press|date=July 1, 1964}}</ref>\n\n[[Elkins Park, Pennsylvania]], was originally issued the 19117 ZIP Code, although it lies in [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania]]. Because of the 191 prefix, which is found only in [[Philadelphia]] apart from that lone exception, auto insurance companies charged higher city premiums to residents of that suburban location. For that reason, residents petitioned the USPS for a 190-prefix ZIP Code, which is common to the inner-ring Pennsylvania suburbs of that city, and, after several attempts that were initially disapproved by the USPS, Elkins Park was finally reassigned to the 19027 ZIP Code.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zip-codes.com/m/city/pa-elkins-park.asp|title=All Zip Codes in Elkins Park PA|website=www.zip-codes.com|access-date=2018-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127022555/https://www.zip-codes.com/m/city/pa-elkins-park.asp|archive-date=2018-11-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nZIP Codes also change when postal boundaries are realigned. For example, concurrent with the above-noted change in Montgomery County, Maryland, and under pressure from the then-mayor of [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Marion Barry]], the USPS realigned the postal boundaries between Washington, D.C. and [[Maryland]] to match the boundary. Previously, many inner suburbs, such as [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]] and [[Takoma Park, Maryland|Takoma Park]], [[Oxon Hill, Maryland|Oxon Hill]], [[Temple Hills, Maryland|Temple Hills]], [[Suitland, Maryland|Suitland]], and [[Capitol Heights, Maryland|Capitol Heights]] had been in the Washington, D.C., postal area. As a result of the change, ZIP Codes in Maryland beginning with 200 were changed to new ZIP Codes beginning with 207, 208, or 209, depending on their location, and ZIP Codes straddling the D.C.\u2013Maryland line were split. For example, 20016 (Bethesda) became 20816, while the Maryland portion of 20012 (Takoma Park) became 20912.\n\n== Other uses ==\n=== Delivery services ===\nDelivery services other than the USPS, such as [[FedEx]], [[United Parcel Service]], and [[DHL]], require a ZIP Code for optimal internal routing of a package.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://faq.usps.com/s/article/ZIP-Code-The-Basics|title=USPS.com FAQs|website=faq.usps.com|access-date=2019-02-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222151852/https://faq.usps.com/s/article/ZIP-Code-The-Basics|archive-date=2019-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Statistics ===\n{{As of|October 2019}}, there are 41,702 ZIP Codes in the United States.<ref name=\"ZIP Code Database - GreatData.com\">{{Cite web|title=U.S. ZIP Code Database|url=https://greatdata.com/product/zip-code-database|website=GreatData.com|access-date=21 October 2019|ref=ZIP Codes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191019150049/https://greatdata.com/product/zip-code-database|archive-date=19 October 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> ZIP Codes are used not only for tracking of mail, but also in gathering geographical statistics in the United States. The [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] calculates approximate boundaries of ZIP Codes areas, which it calls [[ZIP Code Tabulation Area]]s (ZCTAs). Statistical census data is then provided for these approximate areas. The geographic data provided for these areas includes the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of the center-point of the ZCTAs. There are approximately 32,000 ZCTAs. The reason that there is not one ZCTA for every ZIP Code is that PO Boxes are excluded, since only populated areas are included in the Census data.<ref>{{Cite web|title=U.S. Census Bureau data provided by GreatData.com|url=http://greatdata.com|access-date=5 February 2013}}</ref> The Census Bureau provides many statistical data sets for ZIP Codes, but does not keep up-to-date datasets of all ZCTAs. Complete datasets providing a similar approximate geographic extent are commercially available. ZIP Codes are inherently discrete or ''point-based'' data, as they are assigned only at the point of delivery, not for the spaces in between the delivery points. The United States Census Bureau then interpolates this discrete data set to create polygons, or areal features representing the approximate extent of the ZIP Code to use for mapping and data presentation. ZCTAs are not to be confused with ZIP Codes, and they are not updated as frequently as ZIP Codes. However, for many research and planning purposes, they are very useful and can be used with ZIP Code data.\n\n=== Marketing ===\nThe data is often used in [[Advertising mail|direct mail marketing]] campaigns in a process called ZIP-code marketing. [[Point of sale|Point-of-sale]] cashiers sometimes ask consumers for their home ZIP Codes. Besides providing purchasing-pattern data useful in determining the location of new business establishments, retailers can use directories to correlate this ZIP Code with the name on a credit card to obtain a consumer's full address and [[telephone number]]. ZIP-Coded data are also used in analyzing geographic factors in risk, an insurance and banking industry practice pejoratively known as [[redlining]]. This can cause problems, ''e.g.'', expensive insurance, for people living near a town with a high crime rate and sharing its ZIP Code, while they live in a relatively crime-free town. (See Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, above.)\n\nCalifornia outlawed this practice in 2011.<ref>{{Cite news | title=California high court: Retailers can not request cardholders' ZIP Code | url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/02/10/california.credit.zip.code/index.html | last=Botelho | first=Greg | publisher=CNN | date=February 10, 2011 | access-date=February 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Legislative districts ===\nZIP Codes may not currently be used to identify existing legislative districts. Although the website of the [[United States House of Representatives]] has a \"Find Your Representative\" feature that looks up congressional districts based on ZIP Codes alone, it often returns multiple districts corresponding to a single ZIP Code.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.house.gov/|title = The United States House of Representatives \u00b7 House.gov|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first =}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/|title = Find Your Representative \u00b7 House.gov|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first =}}</ref> This is because different parts of one ZIP Code can be in different districts.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/01/19/dont-use-zipcodes/|title = Sunlight Foundation|date = Jan 19, 2012|access-date = Aug 6, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140813005420/http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/01/19/dont-use-zipcodes/|archive-date = August 13, 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref> One proposal to eliminate the possibility of extreme partisan [[gerrymandering]] calls on using ZIP Codes as the basic units for redistricting.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Steelman |first1=Tyler |last2=Curiel |first2=John |title=Here's one way to end partisan gerrymandering: Don't break up Zip codes |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/10/22/heres-one-way-to-end-partisan-gerrymandering-dont-break-up-zip-codes/ |website=Monkey Cage blog |publisher=Washington Post |access-date=4 November 2018 |date=October 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Internet ===\nA 1978 proposal for a nationwide system of community networks suggested using ZIP Codes for [[routing]].<ref name=\"wilber197802\">{{Cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1978-02/1978_02_BYTE_03-02_Hardware_Projects#page/n15/mode/2up | title=CIE Net: A Design for a Network of Community Information Exchanges | work=BYTE | date=February 1978 | access-date=17 October 2013 | author=Wilber, Mike | page=12}}</ref>\n\nZIP Code data is an integral part of dealer / [[Online locator service|store locator]] software on many [[website]]s, especially [[Bricks and clicks|brick-and-click]] websites. This software processes a user-input ZIP Code and returns a list of store or business locations, usually in the order of increasing distance from the center of the input ZIP Code. As the ZIP Code system is confined to the U.S. Postal network, websites that require ZIP Codes cannot register customers outside the United States. Many sites will purchase postal code data of other countries or make allowances in cases where the ZIP Code is not recognized.\n\nZIP Codes are regularly used on the Internet to provide a location in situations where an exact address is not necessary (or desirable) but the user's municipality or general location is needed. Examples (in addition to the store locator example listed above) include weather forecasts, television listings, local news, and [[Online dating service|online dating]] (most general-purpose sites, by default, search within a specified [[radius]] of a given ZIP Code, based on other users' entered ZIP Codes).\n\n=== Credit card security ===\n{{Main|Address Verification System}}\nZIP Codes are used in credit card authorization, specifically [[Address Verification System]] (AVS). When a merchant collects the entire address, the ZIP Code is an important part of AVS. In some cases, the ZIP Code is the only thing used for AVS, specifically where collecting a signature, or other information is infeasible, such as [[pay at the pump]] or [[vending machine]]s.\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[J.

For example, in 2007 a major cyclone named \"[[Cyclone Sidr]]\" skipped Chennai and headed towards Bangladesh. The result was a failure of NE monsoon in Chennai, that particular year.

This resulted in the [[Anti-Hindi agitations]] in the city and across the state.

The [[Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu|Anti-Hindi agitations in mid-1960s]] made the DMK more popular and more powerful political force in the state. The agitations of the 1960s played a crucial role in the defeat of the Tamil Nadu Congress party in the 1967 elections and the continuing dominance of Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu politics.<ref name=\"hindu3\">{{cite news | url = http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/Readers-Editor/article61129.ece | title = Language issue again: the need for a clear-headed policy | author = S.
