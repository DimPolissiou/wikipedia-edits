While both Debian and gNewSense rigorously exclude non-free software and [[binary blobs]] from their official releases, Debian maintains and [[file server|hosts]] unofficial repositories of non-free software and [[firmware]] binaries, and Debian free software sometimes [[Coupling (computer programming)|depends]] upon or suggests the optional installation of [[proprietary software]], under the theory that [[User (computing)|user]]s' own informed discretion about the use of such software should be paramount, as expressed in Clause 5 of the [[Debian Social Contract]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.debian.org/social_contract.en.html|title=Debian Social Contract|website=www.debian.org}}</ref> (though Debian's democratic project management has seen this stance become a source of recurrent controversy<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.debian.org/vote/2004/vote_002.en.html|title=General Resolution: Status of the non-free section|website=www.debian.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_007.en.html|title=General Resolution: Handling source-less firmware in the Linux kernel|website=www.debian.org}}</ref>). gNewSense, by contrast, does not provide any [[Package (package management system)|packages]] which depend on or suggest the use of non-free software, firmware, extensions, or plugins, nor does the gNewSense Project provide convenience-access to proprietary software for any reason, seeing this as an abrogation of the commitment to the development of [[Free software movement|free software solutions]].

Smith concluded this review with the following words:<ref name=\"Smith26Aug13\" />\n\n<blockquote>\nGenerally speaking, I was happy with gNewSense 3.0. Being based on Debian, the distribution can be counted on to provide both stability and amazing performance. The distribution is lean, fast and uncluttered. The flip side to this is gNewSense's system installer and default package management tools are geared more toward experienced users and will probably provide a steep learning curve to novice Linux users. Not much is automated and there is a minimum of hand holding. The main feature of gNewSense, the lack of proprietary software, is also a double-edged blade. On the one hand, it means the entire operating system can be audited, modified and redistributed. This is great from the perspective of software freedom. The fact that the distribution can play most multimedia formats and handled Flash content fairly well is a testament of the power of free and open source software. The one problem I ran into with gNewSense's software policy was with regards to my wireless network card. Most distributions ship with the non-free Intel firmware, but gNewSense doesn't include it and this means the distribution isn't a good fit with my laptop. It is, on the other hand , a great match with my desktop system.\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Richard Stallman]] (founder and president of the [[Free Software Foundation]]) said he used gNewSense in January 2010<ref>{{cite web |url=http://richard.stallman.usesthis.com/ |title=An interview with Richard Stallman |publisher=Richard.stallman.usesthis.com |date=2010-01-23 |accessdate=2011-07-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717175618/http://richard.stallman.usesthis.com/ |archive-date=2011-07-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and he was still using it in April 2014.<ref>{{cite web|author=Vito Gentile |url=https://www.html.it/articoli/gnulinux-meeting-2014-richard-stallman-e-approdato-a-palermo/ |title=GNU/Linux Meeting 2014: Richard Stallman approda a Palermo |trans-title=GNU / Linux Meeting 2014: Richard Stallman has landed in Palermo |language=it |publisher=HTML.it |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref> Since then Stallman has switched to [[Trisquel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html|title=How I do my Computing|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nSerdar Yegulalp reviewed gNewSense for InfoWorld.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/3067280/free-as-can-be-gnewsense-is-true-gnu-linux.html|title=Free as can be: gNewSense is true GNU Linux|first=Serdar|last=Yegulalp|date=May 9, 2016|website=InfoWorld}}</ref> He is said: {{quote|The base of gNewSense is the Debian distribution, which already excludes proprietary binary blobs and unfree software but provides access to them via repositories.

Smith concluded this review with the following words:<ref name=\"Smith26Aug13\" />\n\n<blockquote>\nGenerally speaking, I was happy with gNewSense 3.0. Being based on Debian, the distribution can be counted on to provide both stability and amazing performance. The distribution is lean, fast and uncluttered. The flip side to this is gNewSense's system installer and default package management tools are geared more toward experienced users and will probably provide a steep learning curve to novice Linux users. Not much is automated and there is a minimum of hand holding. The main feature of gNewSense, the lack of proprietary software, is also a double-edged blade. On the one hand, it means the entire operating system can be audited, modified and redistributed. This is great from the perspective of software freedom. The fact that the distribution can play most multimedia formats and handled Flash content fairly well is a testament of the power of free and open source software. The one problem I ran into with gNewSense's software policy was with regards to my wireless network card. Most distributions ship with the non-free Intel firmware, but gNewSense doesn't include it and this means the distribution isn't a good fit with my laptop. It is, on the other hand , a great match with my desktop system.\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Richard Stallman]] (founder and president of the [[Free Software Foundation]]) said he used gNewSense in January 2010<ref>{{cite web |url=http://richard.stallman.usesthis.com/ |title=An interview with Richard Stallman |publisher=Richard.stallman.usesthis.com |date=2010-01-23 |accessdate=2011-07-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717175618/http://richard.stallman.usesthis.com/ |archive-date=2011-07-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and he was still using it in April 2014.<ref>{{cite web|author=Vito Gentile |url=https://www.html.it/articoli/gnulinux-meeting-2014-richard-stallman-e-approdato-a-palermo/ |title=GNU/Linux Meeting 2014: Richard Stallman approda a Palermo |trans-title=GNU / Linux Meeting 2014: Richard Stallman has landed in Palermo |language=it |publisher=HTML.it |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref> Since then Stallman has switched to [[Trisquel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html|title=How I do my Computing|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nSerdar Yegulalp reviewed gNewSense for InfoWorld.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/3067280/free-as-can-be-gnewsense-is-true-gnu-linux.html|title=Free as can be: gNewSense is true GNU Linux|first=Serdar|last=Yegulalp|date=May 9, 2016|website=InfoWorld}}</ref> He is said: {{quote|The base of gNewSense is the Debian distribution, which already excludes proprietary binary blobs and unfree software but provides access to them via repositories.

In contrast to a general purpose language such as [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]], P4 is a [[domain-specific language]] with a number of constructs optimized for [[Packet forwarding|network data forwarding]].  P4 is distributed as [[Open-source software|open-source]], [[Permissive free software licence|permissively licensed]] code, and is maintained by the P4 Language Consortium, a not-for-profit organization.\n\n== History ==\nThe programming language P4 was originally described in a SIGCOMM CCR paper in 2014 titled \u201cProgramming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sigcomm.org/node/3503|title=P4: Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors|date=July 2014|accessdate=7 April 2015}}</ref> \u2013 the alliterative name shortens to \u201cP4\u201d.

An updated specification of P4, called P4-16, was released between 2016 and 2017 <ref name=\"P4-16\">{{cite web |title=P4-16 Specification |url=https://p4.org/p4-spec/docs/P4-16-v1.2.0.html |website=P4 Official Website |accessdate=23 October 2019}}</ref> replacing original specification of P4, called P4-14. \n\n==Design==\nAs the language is specifically targeted at packet forwarding applications, the list of requirements or design choices is somewhat unusual to those use cases. The language is designed to meet several goals:\n\n===Target independence===\nP4 programs are designed to be '''implementation-independent''', meaning they can be compiled against many different types of execution machines such as general-purpose CPUs, [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGAs]], [[System on a chip|system(s)-on-chip]], network processors, and ASICs.  These different types of machines are known as P4 '''targets''', and each target must be provided along with a [[compiler]] that maps the P4 source code into a target switch model. The compiler may be embedded in the target device, an externally running software, or even a cloud service.  As many of the initial targets for P4 programs were used for simple packet switching it is very common to hear the term \u201cP4 switch\u201d used, even though \u201cP4 target\u201d is more formally correct.\n\n===Protocol independence===\nP4 is designed to be '''protocol-independent''', meaning that the language has no native support even for common  protocols such as IP, Ethernet, TCP, [[Virtual Extensible LAN|VxLAN]], or [[Multiprotocol Label Switching|MPLS]].  Instead, the P4 programmer describes the header formats and field names of the required protocols in the program, which are in turn interpreted and processed by the compiled program and target device.\n\n===Reconfigurability===\nProtocol independence and the abstract language model allow for '''reconfigurability''' \u2013 P4 targets should be able to change the way they process packets (perhaps multiple times) after they are deployed.  This capability is traditionally associated with forwarding planes built on [[History of general-purpose CPUs|general-purpose CPUs]] or [[network processor]]s, rather than the fixed function [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASICs]].   Although within the language there is nothing to prevent a given target from optimizing around a certain set of protocols, these optimizations are invisible to the language author and may ultimately reduce the system's flexibility and reconfigurability goals.\n\n==Components==\nP4 programs typically have the following components:\n\n===Parsing logic===\nP4 allows the specification of custom packet header parsing logic <ref name=\"P4-16\"/>  including but not limited to parsing typical headers used in the TCP/IP protocol suite and application specific headers. \n\n===Headers===\nHeader definitions describe packet formats and provide names for the fields within the packet.  The language allows customized header names and fields of arbitrary length, although many header definitions use widely known protocol names and fields widths.  For example, an [[IEEE 802.3|802.3]] Ethernet header definition might be called \u201cEthernet\u201d and consist of the a 48-bit field named \u201cdest\u201d followed by a 48-bit \u201csrc\u201d field, followed by a 16-bit \u201ctype\u201d field.  The names in a header definition are used later in the P4 program to reference these fields.\n\n===Parsers===\nThe P4 '''parser''' is a finite state machine that walks an incoming byte-stream and extracts headers based on the programmed parse graph.  A simple example would be a parser that extracts the Ethernet source and destination and type fields, then performs a further extraction based on the value in the type field (common values might be ipv4, ipv6, or MPLS).\n\n===Stateful processing===\nP4 allows the programmer to maintain state in the form of registers, counters and meters <ref name=\"P4-16\"/>. \n\n===Generic match action tables=== \nThe primary component of a P4 program is a set of user-defined match action tables. P4 treats all match action tables as generic, leaving the user to add their match-action rules via the control plane. <ref name=\"P4-16\"/>.\n\n====Match-action processing====\nFundamental to P4 is the concept of '''match-action pipelines'''. Conceptually, forwarding network packets or frames can be broken down into a series of table lookups and corresponding header manipulations.  In P4 these manipulations are known as \u201cactions\u201d and generally consist of things such as copying byte fields from one location to another based on the lookup results on learned forwarding state.   P4 addresses only the data plane of a packet forwarding device. It does not specify the control plane nor any exact protocol for communicating state between the control and data planes.  Instead, P4 uses the concept of tables to represent forwarding plane state.  An interface between the control plane and the various P4 tables must be provided to allow the control plane to inject/modify state in the program.  This interface is generally referred to as the \u201cprogram API\u201d.\n\n====Tables====\nP4 '''tables''' contain the state used to forward packets.  Tables are composed of lookup keys and a corresponding set of actions and their parameters.  A trivial example might be to store a set of destination MAC addresses as the lookup keys, and the corresponding action could set the output port on the device, and/or increment a counter.  Tables and their associated actions are almost always chained together in sequence to realize the full packet forwarding logic, although in the abstract it is possible to build a single table that includes all the lookup key information and the full output action set.\n\n====Actions====\n'''Actions''' in P4 describe packet field and [[metadata]] manipulations.  In P4 context, metadata is information about a packet that is not directly derived from the parser, such as the input interface that the frame arrived on.  English descriptions of an example action might be \u201cdecrement the IPv4 [[Time to live|TTL]] field by one\u201d or \u201ccopy the MAC address from the output port table into the outgoing packet header.\u201d <ref>{{cite web |url=http://lists.p4.org |title=P4 Mailing Lists |date=July 2015 |accessdate=15 July 2015}}</ref> P4 defines both standard metadata that must be provided by all targets as well as target-specific metadata, which is provided by the author of specific targets.\n\n==Control flow==\nThe control flow in P4 determines the relative sequence of tables, and allows for [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditional execution]] of tables based on if/then/else constructions.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://p4.org}}\n\n[[Category:Computer networking]]\n[[Category:C programming language family]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the programming language|the perforce version control system|Perforce|other uses|P4 (disambiguation)}}\n\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{more footnotes|date=May 2015}}\n{{Third-party|date=July 2019}}\n}}\n{{Infobox programming language\n| name                   = P4\n| paradigm               = [[compiled language|compiled]], [[Domain-specific language|domain-specific]], [[imperative programming|imperative]]\n| year                   = {{start date and age|2013}}\n| developer              = [[The P4 Language Consortium]]\n| latest_release_version = version 1.2<ref>{{cite web|title=P4 Language and Related Specifications |url=https://p4.org/p4-spec/docs/P4-16-v1.2.0.html |accessdate=2 December 2019}}</ref>\n| latest_release_date    = {{start date and age|df=yes|2019|10|23}}\n| license                = [[Apache Licence|Apache]]-style\n| website                = {{URL|http://p4.org}}\n| file_ext               = .p4\n}}\n\n'''P4''' is a [[programming language]] for controlling [[Network packet|packet]] [[forwarding plane]]s in networking devices, such as routers and switches.

It is the third largest community in the [[Billings Metropolitan Area|Billings Metropolitan Statistical Area]], and is located in the Yellowstone Valley, as an east-west terminal division point of the Burlington-Northern Railroad. The population was 6,781 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].<ref>[http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST13&prodType=table US Census Fact Sheet for 2010] {{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nLaurel is home to a [[CHS, Inc.|Cenex Harvest States]] [[oil refinery]] and [[Montana Rail Link]]'s Laurel Yard, the largest rail yard between [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], [[Minnesota]] and [[Pasco, Washington|Pasco]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].\n\n==History==\nBefore Laurel became a city or a community, people passed through the site during the gold rush period, when gold was discovered at the Clarks Fork headwaters. They came by team and wagon, and by small steamer vessels up the Yellowstone River. The government was in the process of planning a railroad to the west coast, and had surveying crews out to map the country on the most direct route. Many of the prospectors that went west in search of gold, felt gold might be found in other parts of the state, so some returned to the Yellowstone Valley, and others came from the East to settle here. However, this did not take place until after the Custer Massacre in 1876. It was not until 1877 that the white man felt safe in the Yellowstone Valley, after the power of the Sioux was broken. So it was that while the memory of the Massacre of General Custer and his Command on the Little Big Horn River was still fresh in the minds of settlers of Montana, that a little community was established in the Yellowstone Valley.<ref name=\"History\">''Laurel's Story, A Montana Heritage'', Elsie Johnston, writer and coordinator, 1979.</ref>\n\nThe history of Laurel began when settlers began making their homes in the vicinity in 1879. There was a section house built that served as a depot and post office, situated about where Hobo Hill is, or near the center of the present railroad yards east of Laurel. The railroad pushed closer to Laurel from the east, up the Yellowstone Valley during the summer of 1882. Up to this time, there were about 200 people in the community. With the advent of the railroad, the population grew to 368 in 1900, 806 in 1910, and 2,338 in 1920.\n\nLaurel was originally known as the station of Carlton, however by 1883, its name was changed to Laurel, after a local shrub. Laurel was considered a town in 1906, but it was not until August 1908 that it became incorporated, and two months later, on October 10, 1908, city government was established with the election of a city council and mayor.\n\n==Geography==\nLaurel is located at {{Coord|45|40|26|N|108|46|15|W|type:city}} (45.673986, -108.770893).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is 3300 feet (1006 m) [[AMSL|above sea level]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.14|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=December 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nSome of Laurel's residents commute the {{convert|15|mi|km}} to [[Billings, Montana|Billings]], Montana's largest city. Laurel is also significant as it lies on one of two main roads to [[Red Lodge, Montana|Red Lodge]], {{convert|45|mi|km}} southwest on [[U.S. Route 212|US 212]]; it is a popular mountain town and an end of the [[Beartooth Highway]].\n\nLaurel is also served by the [[Laurel Municipal Airport]], a publicly owned public-use [[airport]], which is {{convert|2.4|mi|km}} north of the [[central business district]].\n\n==Government==\nThe City of Laurel operates under a Mayor - Alderman form of government.<ref name=\"Government\">[http://www.laurel.mt.gov/ City Of Laurel Website]</ref> Full executive authority is vested in the Mayor, who is elected at-large for a four-year term. The Mayor presides over the meetings of the City Council and appoints and charges regular and special committees of the City Council. The Mayor is eligible to vote only in cases of a tie, but he may be heard at all times. He may veto all City Council actions, including line items within a budget resolution, and his veto may be overridden by two-thirds of the whole membership of the City Council.\n\nIn November 2007, the citizens of Laurel approved a city charter with self-governing powers. This allows for the position of Chief Administrative Officer to supervise the city's operations.\n\nLegislative authority is vested in the City Council, which is composed of eight aldermen or women elected to four-year terms by the residents of the Ward within which the respective alderman/woman resides. The City Council has management and control of the city's finances and property. The City Council has the power to adopt ordinances and regulations consistent with state and federal law for the good government, preservation of good order, benefit of trade and commerce, protection of the quality of life within the city, and, as necessary, to carry out the purposes of the government of the City of Laurel.\n\nAs of 2016, Mark Mace holds the seat of Mayor of Laurel.\n\n==Public safety==\n\n===Police department===\nThe Laurel Police Department is a member of the Montana Law Enforcement Testing Consortium (MTLETC). Rick Musson was promoted to the position of Chief of Police in August 1998, a position which he continues to hold.\n\nThe Laurel Police Department occasionally accepts applications from individuals who would like to volunteer their time to serve and protect the community. The LPD has had a reserve program for over 35 years.\n\n===Fire department===\nThe [https://web.archive.org/web/20110713190237/http://laurelfd.com/index.html Laurel Volunteer Fire Department] provides firefighting and rescue emergency response for the community of Laurel, the {{convert|110|sqmi|km2}} surrounding Laurel and to all those who are traveling through and find themselves in need of assistance. The LVFD also provides mutual aid to Billings, Park City, and CHS Industrial Fire Departments; and assistance as needed to several surrounding Fire Departments, including Lockwood, Red Lodge, Columbus, Molt and Joliet. \n \nIn addition to firefighting and rescue, the fire department is known for its world-class [[Fourth of July]] fireworks, rated as one of the top 10 events in the Northwest, and it's Christmas holiday celebration.\n \nThe Fire Department is also known for award-winning Fire Prevention program. With the motto \u201cPrevention through Education\u201d, the LVFD visits the children of Laurel several times a year, educating them on preventing fires and fire safety. The first week of October is named \u201cFire Prevention Week\u201d. The week is filled with visits to the schools by the Firefighters, an open house where the Department's doors are opened to the public and an hour-long program for the children of the community.\n\n===Ambulance service===\nThe Laurel Volunteer Ambulance Service was created on June 1, 1976. The service is responsible for covering 183 square miles, including the territory within the city limits of Laurel. Before the service was formed, a local physician who owned and maintained an ambulance provided services and prehospital emergency care. As the needs of the citizens increased and calls for service became more frequent, the City felt an agency ran by city government was better equipped to provide for the people. The ambulance service has operated at the Basic Life Support level since 1976. The service is licensed through the Montana Department of Public Health and Human services, and it requires each staff member to maintain a license of at least the Emergency Medical Technician level.\n\nThe service has maintained two ambulances for transport of patients, and also provides a Quick Response SUV for various emergency purposes. The ambulance service is dispatched from the Laurel 9-1-1 Center and responds to medical emergency calls within the service area. While the service is able to provide some advanced therapies, such as intravenous access and 12-lead ECG monitoring, advanced life support services are provided mainly by American Medical Response-Billings, St. Vincent HELP Flight, Red Lodge Fire-Rescue, and Columbus Fire-Rescue. Neighboring agencies are often called to assist the service in meeting the needs of citizens, and Laurel Ambulance Service also provides mutual aid support to the neighboring agencies as well.\n\nAs of 2016, there are 22 active Emergency Medical Technicians and Paramedics providing ambulance services to the citizens of Laurel.\n\n==Economy==\n[[CHS, Inc.|Cenex Harvest States]] oil refinery, [[Montana Rail Link]], Laurel School District 7-70, and Wood's Power Grip comprise the major employers in Laurel. Farming and ranching provide other important mainstays.\n\nThe [[Billings Canal]], used for irrigation, starts in Laurel.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe City of Laurel now has two types of public transit available to City residents: a '''Demand-Response Service''' and a '''Van Pool''' to Billings.\n\n'''Demand-Response Service''' is available Monday-Friday 10:00&nbsp;am to 4:00&nbsp;pm. This door-to-door service requires advance notice. Reservations must be made the day prior to need by 4:00&nbsp;pm. You may make your reservation by calling the City of Laurel Public Works Department at 628-4796. On the 1st, 3rd, & 5th Wednesday of each month the Demand-Response Service will make trips to Billings. On these days the door-to-door service will be unavailable within the City of Laurel.\n\nThe City of Laurel '''Van Pool Service''' will be available to the Billings Downtown Area from Laurel for those that would like to consider carpooling to work during the week.

It is the third largest community in the [[Billings Metropolitan Area|Billings Metropolitan Statistical Area]], and is located in the Yellowstone Valley, as an east-west terminal division point of the Burlington-Northern Railroad. The population was 6,781 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].<ref>[http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST13&prodType=table US Census Fact Sheet for 2010] {{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nLaurel is home to a [[CHS, Inc.|Cenex Harvest States]] [[oil refinery]] and [[Montana Rail Link]]'s Laurel Yard, the largest rail yard between [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], [[Minnesota]] and [[Pasco, Washington|Pasco]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].\n\n==History==\nBefore Laurel became a city or a community, people passed through the site during the gold rush period, when gold was discovered at the Clarks Fork headwaters. They came by team and wagon, and by small steamer vessels up the Yellowstone River. The government was in the process of planning a railroad to the west coast, and had surveying crews out to map the country on the most direct route. Many of the prospectors that went west in search of gold, felt gold might be found in other parts of the state, so some returned to the Yellowstone Valley, and others came from the East to settle here. However, this did not take place until after the Custer Massacre in 1876. It was not until 1877 that the white man felt safe in the Yellowstone Valley, after the power of the Sioux was broken. So it was that while the memory of the Massacre of General Custer and his Command on the Little Big Horn River was still fresh in the minds of settlers of Montana, that a little community was established in the Yellowstone Valley.<ref name=\"History\">''Laurel's Story, A Montana Heritage'', Elsie Johnston, writer and coordinator, 1979.</ref>\n\nThe history of Laurel began when settlers began making their homes in the vicinity in 1879. There was a section house built that served as a depot and post office, situated about where Hobo Hill is, or near the center of the present railroad yards east of Laurel. The railroad pushed closer to Laurel from the east, up the Yellowstone Valley during the summer of 1882. Up to this time, there were about 200 people in the community. With the advent of the railroad, the population grew to 368 in 1900, 806 in 1910, and 2,338 in 1920.\n\nLaurel was originally known as the station of Carlton, however by 1883, its name was changed to Laurel, after a local shrub. Laurel was considered a town in 1906, but it was not until August 1908 that it became incorporated, and two months later, on October 10, 1908, city government was established with the election of a city council and mayor.\n\n==Geography==\nLaurel is located at {{Coord|45|40|26|N|108|46|15|W|type:city}} (45.673986, -108.770893).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is 3300 feet (1006 m) [[AMSL|above sea level]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.14|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=December 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nSome of Laurel's residents commute the {{convert|15|mi|km}} to [[Billings, Montana|Billings]], Montana's largest city. Laurel is also significant as it lies on one of two main roads to [[Red Lodge, Montana|Red Lodge]], {{convert|45|mi|km}} southwest on [[U.S. Route 212|US 212]]; it is a popular mountain town and an end of the [[Beartooth Highway]].\n\nLaurel is also served by the [[Laurel Municipal Airport]], a publicly owned public-use [[airport]], which is {{convert|2.4|mi|km}} north of the [[central business district]].\n\n==Government==\nThe City of Laurel operates under a Mayor - Alderman form of government.<ref name=\"Government\">[http://www.laurel.mt.gov/ City Of Laurel Website]</ref> Full executive authority is vested in the Mayor, who is elected at-large for a four-year term. The Mayor presides over the meetings of the City Council and appoints and charges regular and special committees of the City Council. The Mayor is eligible to vote only in cases of a tie, but he may be heard at all times. He may veto all City Council actions, including line items within a budget resolution, and his veto may be overridden by two-thirds of the whole membership of the City Council.\n\nIn November 2007, the citizens of Laurel approved a city charter with self-governing powers. This allows for the position of Chief Administrative Officer to supervise the city's operations.\n\nLegislative authority is vested in the City Council, which is composed of eight aldermen or women elected to four-year terms by the residents of the Ward within which the respective alderman/woman resides. The City Council has management and control of the city's finances and property. The City Council has the power to adopt ordinances and regulations consistent with state and federal law for the good government, preservation of good order, benefit of trade and commerce, protection of the quality of life within the city, and, as necessary, to carry out the purposes of the government of the City of Laurel.\n\nAs of 2016, Mark Mace holds the seat of Mayor of Laurel.\n\n==Public safety==\n\n===Police department===\nThe Laurel Police Department is a member of the Montana Law Enforcement Testing Consortium (MTLETC). Rick Musson was promoted to the position of Chief of Police in August 1998, a position which he continues to hold.\n\nThe Laurel Police Department occasionally accepts applications from individuals who would like to volunteer their time to serve and protect the community. The LPD has had a reserve program for over 35 years.\n\n===Fire department===\nThe [https://web.archive.org/web/20110713190237/http://laurelfd.com/index.html Laurel Volunteer Fire Department] provides firefighting and rescue emergency response for the community of Laurel, the {{convert|110|sqmi|km2}} surrounding Laurel and to all those who are traveling though and find themselves in need of assistance. The LVFD also provides mutual aid to Billings, Park City, and CHS Industrial Fire Departments; and assistance as needed to several surrounding Fire Departments, including Lockwood, Red Lodge, Columbus, Molt and Joliet. \n \nIn addition to firefighting and rescue, the fire department is known for its world class [[Fourth of July]] fireworks, rated as one of the top 10 events in the Northwest, and it's Christmas holiday celebration.\n \nThe Fire Department is also known for award-winning Fire Prevention program. With the motto \u201cPrevention through Education\u201d, the LVFD visits the children of Laurel several times a year, educating them on preventing fires and fire safety. The first week of October is named \u201cFire Prevention Week\u201d. The week is filled with visits to the schools by the Firefighters, an open house where the Department's doors are opened to the public and an hour-long program for the children of the community.\n\n===Ambulance service===\nThe Laurel Volunteer Ambulance Service was created on June 1, 1976. The service is responsible for covering 183 square miles, including the territory within the city limits of Laurel. Before the service was formed, a local physician who owned and maintained an ambulance provided services and prehospital emergency care. As the needs of the citizens increased and calls for service became more frequent, the City felt an agency ran by city government was better equipped to provide for the people. The ambulance service has operated at the Basic Life Support level since 1976. The service is licensed through the Montana Department of Public Health and Human services, and it requires each staff member to maintain a license of at least the Emergency Medical Technician level.\n\nThe service has maintained two ambulances for transport of patients, and also provides a Quick Response SUV for various emergency purposes.

There he got a job at a music publishing company and, in 1997, he was aided by [[Bobby Braddock]] to obtain a production contract with [[Sony Music]].<ref name=\"AutoRD-1\"/>\n\n== Music career ==\n=== 2001\u20132006: Beginnings ===\n[[File:Blake Shelton.jpg|thumb|right|Shelton performing at the Crawford County Fair in Meadville, PA, in August 2005]] Some years later in Nashville, he signed to Giant Records in 2001. In 2001, he was slated to release a song entitled \"[[I Wanna Talk About Me]]\" as a single. However, staff at the label considered the song unsuitable for a lead-off single, and the song was eventually recorded by [[Toby Keith]], whose version was a number 1 single.<ref name=\"rap\"/>\n\nInstead, Giant released \"[[Austin (song)|Austin]]\" as Shelton's debut single. Shortly after that song was released, Giant Records was closed, and Shelton was transferred to parent company [[Warner Bros. Records]]. \"Austin\" became Shelton's first number one hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts and spent five weeks at that position. Warner released Shelton's [[Blake Shelton (album)|self-titled debut album]], which was produced by songwriter [[Bobby Braddock]]. It also produced the Top 20 hits \"[[All Over Me (Blake Shelton song)|All Over Me]]\", which Shelton co-wrote with [[Earl Thomas Conley]] and Mike Pyle, and \"[[Ol' Red]]\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Although Shelton's rendition of \"Ol' Red\" was not a major radio hit, he considers it his [[signature song]], and it has become popular in [[concert]].<ref name=\"AutoRD-3\"/> The album received a platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for shipments of 1,000,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Blake+Shelton&ti=#search_section |title=Gold & Platinum |publisher=RIAA |date= |accessdate=March 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe album received a positive review from Maria Konicki Dinoia of [[Allmusic]], who called \"Austin\" \"tremendously imaginative\" and praised Shelton for including songs written by Braddock and Conley.<ref name=\"AutoRD-4\"/> ''[[Country Standard Time]]'' was less favorable, with Scott Homewood saying that the \"album just smacks of being assembled with the intent on capturing the burgeoning alternative country market\".<ref name=\"AutoRD-5\"/>\n\nShelton's second album, ''The Dreamer'', was first released on February 4, 2003, on Warner Bros. Records. Its lead-off single, \"The Baby\", reached No. 1 on the country charts, holding that position for three weeks. Although the second and third singles (\"Heavy Liftin'\" and \"Playboys of the Southwestern World\", respectively) only reached No.32 and No.&nbsp;24, ''The Dreamer'' earned gold certification as well. He, along with [[Andy Griggs]] and [[Montgomery Gentry]], sang guest vocals on [[Tracy Byrd]]'s mid-2003 single \"[[The Truth About Men (song)|The Truth About Men]]\". ''Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill'' was the title of Shelton's third studio album, released in 2004.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Its lead-off single, the [[Harley Allen]] co-write \"When Somebody Knows You That Well\", peaked at No.37 on the country charts, while the follow-up \"Some Beach\" became his third No.1 hit, holding that position for four weeks. It was followed by a cover of Conway Twitty's 1988 single \"Goodbye Time\".<ref name=\"cw\"/> Both this cover and its followup, \"Nobody but Me\", reached Top Ten for Shelton as well. As with his first album, ''Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill'' was certified platinum. Accompanying the album's release was a video collection entitled ''Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill: A Video Collection''.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nOn December 18, 2005, several of Shelton's songs, including \"Nobody but Me\", appeared on the TV movie ''[[The Christmas Blessing]]'', starring [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Rebecca Gayheart]], [[Angus T.

In 2001, he was slated to release a song entitled \"[[I Wanna Talk About Me]]\" as a single. However, staff at the label considered the song unsuitable for a lead-off single, and the song was eventually recorded by [[Toby Keith]], whose version was a number 1 single.<ref name=\"rap\"/>\n\nInstead, Giant released \"[[Austin (song)|Austin]]\" as Shelton's debut single. Shortly after that song was released, Giant Records was closed, and Shelton was transferred to parent company [[Warner Bros. Records]]. \"Austin\" became Shelton's first number one hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts and spent five weeks at that position. Warner released Shelton's [[Blake Shelton (album)|self-titled debut album]], which was produced by songwriter [[Bobby Braddock]]. It also produced the Top 20 hits \"[[All Over Me (Blake Shelton song)|All Over Me]]\", which Shelton co-wrote with [[Earl Thomas Conley]] and Mike Pyle, and \"[[Ol' Red]]\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Although Shelton's rendition of \"Ol' Red\" was not a major radio hit, he considers it his [[signature song]], and it has become popular in [[concert]].<ref name=\"AutoRD-3\"/> The album received a platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for shipments of 1,000,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Blake+Shelton&ti=#search_section |title=Gold & Platinum |publisher=RIAA |date= |accessdate=March 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe album received a positive review from Maria Konicki Dinoia of [[Allmusic]], who called \"Austin\" \"tremendously imaginative\" and praised Shelton for including songs written by Braddock and Conley.<ref name=\"AutoRD-4\"/> ''[[Country Standard Time]]'' was less favorable, with Scott Homewood saying that the \"album just smacks of being assembled with the intent on capturing the burgeoning alternative country market\".<ref name=\"AutoRD-5\"/>\n\nShelton's second album, ''The Dreamer'', was first released on February 4, 2003, on Warner Bros. Records. Its lead-off single, \"The Baby\", reached No. 1 on the country charts, holding that position for three weeks. Although the second and third singles (\"Heavy Liftin'\" and \"Playboys of the Southwestern World\", respectively) only reached No.32 and No.&nbsp;24, ''The Dreamer'' earned gold certification as well. He, along with [[Andy Griggs]] and [[Montgomery Gentry]], sang guest vocals on [[Tracy Byrd]]'s mid-2003 single \"[[The Truth About Men (song)|The Truth About Men]]\". ''Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill'' was the title of Shelton's third studio album, released in 2004.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Its lead-off single, the [[Harley Allen]] co-write \"When Somebody Knows You That Well\", peaked at No.37 on the country charts, while the follow-up \"Some Beach\" became his third No.1 hit, holding that position for four weeks. It was followed by a cover of Conway Twitty's 1988 single \"Goodbye Time\".<ref name=\"cw\"/> Both this cover and its followup, \"Nobody but Me\", reached Top Ten for Shelton as well.
