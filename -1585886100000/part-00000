A convinced [[communist]], he [[defection|defected]] to the Soviet Union in 1950, where he continued his research on the decay of the [[muon]] and on neutrinos. The prestigious [[Bruno Pontecorvo Prize|Pontecorvo Prize]] was instituted in his memory in 1995.\n\nThe fourth of eight children of a wealthy Jewish-Italian family, Pontecorvo studied physics at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome ''La Sapienza'']], under Fermi, becoming the youngest of his [[Via Panisperna boys]]. In 1934 he participated in Fermi's famous experiment showing the properties of slow [[neutrons]] that led the way to the discovery of [[nuclear fission]]. He moved to Paris in 1934, where he conducted research under [[Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie|Ir\u00e8ne]] and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie]]. Influenced by his cousin, [[Emilio Sereni]], he joined the [[French Communist Party]], as did his sisters Giuliana and Laura and brother [[Gillo Pontecorvo|Gillo]]. The Italian [[National Fascist Party|Fascist]] regime's [[Italian racial laws|1938 racial laws]] against Jews caused his family members to leave Italy for Britain, France and the United States.\n\nWhen the German Army closed in on Paris during the [[Second World War]], Pontecorvo, his brother Gillo, cousin Emilio Sereni and [[Salvador Luria]] fled the city on bicycles. He eventually made his way to [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], where he applied his knowledge of nuclear physics to prospecting for oil and minerals. In 1943, he joined the British [[Tube Alloys]] team at the [[Montreal Laboratory]] in Canada. This became part of the [[Manhattan Project]] to develop the first [[atomic bomb]]s. At [[Chalk River Laboratories]], he worked on the design of the [[nuclear reactor]] [[ZEEP]], the first reactor outside of the [[United States]] that went [[Criticality (status)|critical]] in 1945, followed by the [[NRX]] reactor in 1947. He also looked into [[cosmic rays]], the decay of [[muon]]s, and what would become his obsession, [[neutrino]]s. He moved to Britain in 1949, where he worked for the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] at Harwell.\n\nAfter his defection to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1950, he worked at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) in [[Dubna]]. He had proposed using [[chlorine]] to detect neutrinos. In a 1959 paper, he argued that the [[electron neutrino]] ({{SubatomicParticle|electron neutrino}}) and the [[muon neutrino]] ({{SubatomicParticle|muon neutrino}}) were different particles. [[Solar neutrinos]] were detected by the [[Homestake Experiment]], but only between one third and one half of the predicted number were found. In response to this [[solar neutrino problem]], he proposed a phenomenon known as [[neutrino oscillation]], whereby electron neutrinos became muon neutrinos. The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the [[Super-Kamiokande]] experiment in 1998. He also predicted in 1958 that [[supernovae]] would produce intense bursts of neutrinos, which was confirmed in 1987 when [[SN 1987A|Supernova SN1987A]] was detected by [[neutrino detectors]].\n\n== Early life and education ==\n[[File:Ragazzi di via Panisperna.jpg|thumb|right|\n[[Enrico Fermi]] and the [[Via Panisperna boys]] in the courtyard of Rome University's Physics Institute in Via Panisperna, about 1934.

He was made a temporary assistant at the Royal Institute of Physics on 1 November 1934 and the University of Rome, and on 7 November, he was listed as co-author, along with Fermi and Rasetti, of a landmark paper on [[slow neutron]]s that reported that hydrogen slowed neutrons more than heavy elements, and that slow neutrons were more easily absorbed.{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=22\u201324}} An Italian patent was granted for the process in October 1935, in the name of Fermi, Pontecorvo, [[Edoardo Amaldi]], [[Franco Rasetti]] and [[Emilio Segr\u00e8]].

The US patent was {{US patent|2206634}}.</ref>\n\n== Early career ==\nIn February 1936, Pontecorvo left Italy and moved to [[Paris]] to work in the laboratory of [[Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie|Ir\u00e8ne]] and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie]] at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]] on a one-year scholarship to study the effects of collisions of neutrons with protons and on the electromagnetic transitions among [[isomers]]. During this period, influenced by his cousin, [[Emilio Sereni]], he adopted the ideals of [[communism]] to which he remained loyal for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=30\u201333}}{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=36\u201338}} He formed a relationship with Helene Marianne Nordblom, a Swedish woman working in Paris as a nanny.{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=33\u201335}} Whether because of his relationship with Marianne, his interesting work on isomers, or the deteriorating political situation in Italy, he turned down an opportunity in 1937 to apply for a tenured position at the University of Rome to stay in Paris.{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=36\u201338}}{{sfn|Close|2015|p=196}}\n\nMarianne moved in with Pontecorvo at the ''H\u00f4tel des Grands Hommes'' on the ''[[Place du Panth\u00e9on]]'' on 4 January 1938. Their son, Gil, was born on 30 July. Her visa expired, and she had to return to Sweden in September. Pontecorvo accompanied her, leaving Gil behind in a residential nursery in Paris. Travelling back to Paris alone, he dined with [[Manne Siegbahn]] and met with [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Lisa Meitner]] on 12 October 1938.{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=38\u201341}} Pontecorvo was now unable to return to Italy because of the [[National Fascist Party|Fascist]] regime's [[Italian racial laws|racial laws]] against the Jews.

This expanded the scope for their use in medical applications. For this ground-breaking research, Pontecorvo received a Curie-Carnegie scholarship, and funding for his work from the French [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|National Centre for Scientific Research]].{{sfn|Turchetti|2012|p=34}}\n\n== Second World War ==\n\n=== Escape from France ===\nIn June 1939, Pontecorvo applied for a visa to visit Sweden, but his application was rejected. On 23 August came the news of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]. He joined the [[French Communist Party]] the next day as an affirmation of his personal faith in the [[Soviet Union]]. Marianne rejoined him in Paris on 6 September 1939, three days after the [[British and French declaration of war on Germany]] in response to the German [[invasion of Poland]] that started the [[Second World War]] in Europe. They were married on 9 January 1940.{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=46\u201350}}\n\nAs the Germans closed in on the city in May 1940, they decided to leave. Although the British offered refuge to French nuclear scientists, including [[Hans von Halban]] and [[Lew Kowarski]], they regarded Pontecorvo as an \"undesirable\".{{sfn|Close|2015|p=52}} Fortunately, Segr\u00e8 had been given an offer of employment in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], by two European expatriates who were looking for an expert on neutron physics. Segr\u00e8 had turned down the offer \u2014 he already had a good job at the [[University of California]] \u2014 but recommended Pontecorvo.{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=54\u201359}}\n\nOn 2 June 1940, he saw Marianne and Gil off with their chattels on a train to [[Toulouse]], where his sister Giuliana lived with her husband, Duccio Tabet. On 13 June, just a day before the Germans entered Paris, Pontecorvo, his brother Gillo, cousin Emilio Sereni and [[Salvador Luria]] set out for Toulouse on bicycles. It took them ten days to reach Toulouse. Luria went to Marseilles, from whence he eventually made his way to the United States.{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=54\u201359}} Pontecorvo, Marianna, Gil, Giuliana and Tabet boarded a train that took them to [[Lisbon]] via [[Madrid]] on 19 July 1940. Both women were pregnant. Marianne had a miscarriage, and was hardly fit to travel, but nonetheless boarded the liner ''[[SS Quanza|Quanza]]'' on 9 August 1940 on its voyage bringing refugees to the United States. Both women were seasick. On 19 August 1940, the ship reached [[New York City]], where they stayed with his brother Paolo.{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=62\u201363}} While there, he visited Fermi at his new home in [[Leonia, New Jersey]].{{sfn|Fermi|1954|p=254}}\n\n=== Prospecting in Oklahoma ===\nIn Tulsa, Pontecorvo went to work for two European migrants, Jakov \"Jake\" Neufeld and Serge Alexandrovich Scherbatskoy, who had founded a company called Well Surveys with funds provided by [[Standard Oil]].{{sfn|Close|2015|p=71|pp=}} Their idea was to apply nuclear physics to searching for minerals. A [[gamma ray]] device had been successful at analysing rock outcroppings. Inspired by the work done in Italy and France, they reasoned that neutrons, being without electrical charge, might be able to detect different elements beneath the surface by [[Neutron activation analysis|inducing radioactivity]] on the rocks. In Pontecorvo, they had the expert they needed.{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=70\u201375}}\n\nPontecorvo created a neutron source using [[radium]] and [[beryllium]], as the Via Panisperna boys had, with [[paraffin wax]] as a neutron moderator, and measured the absorption of different minerals using methods developed by Fermi and Amaldi. By June 1941, he had a device that could differentiate [[shale]], [[limestone]] and [[sandstone]], and map the transitions between them. The technique may be considered the first practical application of the discovery of slow neutrons, and would still be in use decades later for [[well logging]].{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=70\u201375}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=Neutron Well Logging \u2013 A New Geological Method Based on Nuclear Physics|first=B. |last=Pontecorvo|journal=Oil and Gas Journal|year=1941|volume=40|pages=32\u201333}}</ref> He filed four patents relating to his instrumentation.<ref>{{harvnb|Turchetti|2003|p=394}}.

Unbeknown to him, the [[Manhattan Project]], the wartime effort to build [[atomic bomb]]s, was cornering the market. In an attempt to obtain them, he met with Fermi, von Halban and [[George Placzek]] in New York in April 1942. He was unable to secure the supplies he wanted, but Fermi showed an unexpected keen interest in the Wells Surveys work.{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=82\u201385}}\n\n=== Tube Alloys ===\nThe meeting with Fermi yielded no supplies, but it did result in Pontecorvo receiving an offer from von Halban and Placzek to join the [[Tube Alloys]] team at the [[Montreal Laboratory]] in Canada.{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=82\u201385}} There was some concern from Sir [[Edward Victor Appleton|Edward Appleton]] over his appointment, not because of Pontecorvo's political beliefs, but on account of the fact that he was not a British national, and there were already a large number of foreign scientists working on Tube Alloys. Appleton was ultimately persuaded due to Pontecorvo's reputation, and the fact that good physicists were in short supply.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=191}} Pontecorvo was officially appointed to Tube Alloys on 15 January 1943, and arrived in Montreal with his family on 7 February 1943.{{sfn|Close|2015|p=89}} The Montreal team designed a [[nuclear reactor]] using [[heavy water]] as a neutron moderator, but lacked the quantity of heavy water needed.{{sfn|Close|2015|p=85}} In August 1943, Churchill and Roosevelt negotiated the [[Quebec Agreement]], which resulted in a resumption of cooperation between the United States and Great Britain, merging Tube Alloys into the Manhattan Project.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=168\u2013173}}\n\n[[File:NRX Pile Building and ZEEP Building- Cooling Tanks 1945.jpg|thumb|left|[[NRX]] and [[ZEEP]] buildings at Chalk River in 1945.

For safety reasons, he decided to build the reactor at the remote [[Chalk River Laboratories]]. With an eye on a post-war nuclear program, he had Pontecorvo and [[Allan Nunn May]] \"debrief\" Manhattan Project scientists who visited Canada, in practice spying for Britain. Unfortunately, Nunn May was also a Soviet spy.{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=95\u201396}} Pontecorvo's second son was born on 20 March 1944, and was named Tito after the [[Yugoslavia]]n [[Josip Broz Tito|communist leader]].{{sfn|Close|2015|p=99}} A third son, Antonio, was born in July 1945.{{sfn|Close|2015|p=123}} With heavy water supplied by the United States, the reactor at Chalk River, known as [[ZEEP]] went [[Criticality (status)|critical]] on 5 September 1945.{{sfn|Close|2015|p=103}} In addition to reactor design, Pontecorvo also looked into [[cosmic rays]], the decay of [[muon]]s, and what would become his obsession, [[neutrino]]s.{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=109\u2013113}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=Nuclear Capture of Mesons and the Meson Decay |first=Brunoi |last=Pontecorvo |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=246\u2013247 |date=1 August 1947 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.72.246 |bibcode = 1947PhRv...72..246P }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Search for Gamma-Radiation in the 2.2-Microsecond Meson Decay Process |first=E.

He was one of four physicists present in the control room when the NRX was started up on the night of 21\u201322 July 1947. At the time, it had five times the [[neutron flux]] of any other reactor, and was the most powerful [[research reactor]] in the world.<ref name=\"Fidecaro\" /> He acquired the nickname \"Ramon Novarro\" after the [[Ramon Novarro|actor of that name]] following an adventure in which he made a trip to [[Boston]] with two women, which culminated in Marianne clearing out the bank account and departing for [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]] with the children; but they were reconciled. Although he had previously taken steps to become a United States citizen, he instead became a [[British subject]] on 7 February 1948. He finally departed Chalk River for the United Kingdom on 24 January 1949.{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=117\u2013124}}\n\n== Defection ==\nAt [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment|Harwell]], Pontecorvo continued to be involved in reactor design projects. As a member of the Power Steering Committee (PSC), he was involved in discussions of the production and use of [[fissile]] materials, and of the materials used in construction of reactors.{{sfn|Turchetti|2003|p=402}} In 1949, other Via Panisperna boys, particularly Emilio Segr\u00e8, began to press their claim over patents relating to the behaviour of slow neutrons, which were at the heart of nuclear reactor\u2014and nuclear weapon\u2014design. The American [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) therefore began looking into their backgrounds. It noted, from its 1943 Manhattan Project files, that Pontecorvo's siblings Giuliana, Laura and Gillo were communists, and that Pontecorvo and Marianne were probably communists too, and reported this to [[MI5]] in Britain, and [[MI6]]'s [[Kim Philby]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=148\u2013154, 197\u2013199}}\n\nIn February 1950, Pontecorvo's Harwell colleague [[Klaus Fuchs]] was arrested for espionage, and the AERE began to take security more seriously,{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=148\u2013154, 197\u2013199}} and Pontecorvo was interviewed by Henry Arnold, the security officer at AERE. While Arnold had no evidence that Pontecorvo was a Soviet spy, he did feel that he was a security risk, and recommended that he be moved to a position where he did not have access to Top Secret material. [[Herbert Skinner]] suggested to Pontecorvo that he apply for a newly created professorship at the [[University of Liverpool]], where Skinner held the Lyon Jones chair of experimental physics.

A convinced [[communist]], he [[defection|defected]] to the Soviet Union in 1950, where he continued his research on the decay of the [[muon]] and on neutrinos. The prestigious [[Bruno Pontecorvo Prize|Pontecorvo Prize]] was instituted in his memory in 1995.\n\nThe fourth of eight children of a wealthy Jewish-Italian family, Pontecorvo studied physics at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome ''La Sapienza'']], under Fermi, becoming the youngest of his [[Via Panisperna boys]]. In 1934 he participated in Fermi's famous experiment showing the properties of slow [[neutrons]] that led the way to the discovery of [[nuclear fission]]. He moved to Paris in 1934, where he conducted research under [[Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie|Ir\u00e8ne]] and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie]]. Influenced by his cousin, [[Emilio Sereni]], he joined the [[French Communist Party]], as did his sisters Giuliana and Laura and brother [[Gillo Pontecorvo|Gillo]]. The Italian [[National Fascist Party|Fascist]] regime's [[Italian racial laws|1938 racial laws]] against Jews caused his family members to leave Italy for Britain, France and the United States.\n\nWhen the German Army closed in on Paris during the [[Second World War]], Pontecorvo, his brother Gillo, cousin Emilio Sereni and [[Salvador Luria]] fled the city on bicycles. He eventually made his way to [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], where he applied his knowledge of nuclear physics to prospecting for oil and minerals. In 1943, he joined the British [[Tube Alloys]] team at the [[Montreal Laboratory]] in Canada. This became part of the [[Manhattan Project]] to develop the first [[atomic bomb]]s. At [[Chalk River Laboratories]], he worked on the design of the [[nuclear reactor]] [[ZEEP]], the first reactor outside of the [[United States]] that went [[Criticality (status)|critical]] in 1945, followed by the [[NRX]] reactor in 1947. He also looked into [[cosmic rays]], the decay of [[muon]]s, and what would become his obsession, [[neutrino]]s. He moved to Britain in 1949, where he worked for the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] at Harwell.\n\nAfter his defection to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1950, he worked at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) in [[Dubna]]. He had proposed using [[chlorine]] to detect neutrinos. In a 1959 paper, he argued that the [[electron neutrino]] ({{SubatomicParticle|electron neutrino}}) and the [[muon neutrino]] ({{SubatomicParticle|muon neutrino}}) were different particles. [[Solar neutrinos]] were detected by the [[Homestake Experiment]], but only between one third and one half of the predicted number. In response to this [[solar neutrino problem]], he proposed a phenomenon known as [[neutrino oscillation]], whereby electron neutrinos became muon neutrinos. The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the [[Super-Kamiokande]] experiment in 1998. He also predicted in 1958 that [[supernovae]] would produce intense bursts of neutrinos, which was confirmed in 1987 when [[SN 1987A|Supernova SN1987A]] was detected by [[neutrino detectors]].\n\n== Early life and education ==\n[[File:Ragazzi di via Panisperna.jpg|thumb|right|\n[[Enrico Fermi]] and the [[Via Panisperna boys]] in the courtyard of Rome University's Physics Institute in Via Panisperna, about 1934.

Marianne rejoined him in Paris on 6 September 1939, three days after the [[British and French declaration of war on Germany]] in response to the German [[invasion of Poland]] that started the [[Second World War]] in Europe. They were married on 9 January 1940.{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=46\u201350}}\n\nAs the Germans closed in on the city in May 1940, they decided to leave.

On 13 June, just a day before the Germans entered Paris, Pontecorvo, his brother Gillo, cousin Emilio Sereni and [[Salvador Luria]] set out for Toulouse on bicycles. It took them ten days to reach Toulouse.

A [[gamma ray]] device had been successful at analysing rock outcroppings. Inspired by the work done in Italy and France, they reasoned that neutrons, being without electrical charge, might be able to detect different elements beneath the surface by [[Neutron activation analysis|inducing radioactivity]] on the rocks. In Pontecorvo, they had the expert they needed.{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=70\u201375}}\n\nPontecorvo created a neutron source using [[radium]] and [[beryllium]], as the Via Panisperna boys had, with [[paraffin wax]] as a neutron moderator, and measured the absorption of different minerals using methods developed by Fermi and Amaldi.

Unbeknown to him, the [[Manhattan Project]], the wartime effort to build [[atomic bomb]]s, was cornering the market. In an attempt to obtain them, he met with Fermi, von Halban and [[George Placzek]] in New York in April 1942.

Appleton was ultimately persuaded due to Pontecorvo's reputation, and the fact that good physicists were in short supply.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=191}} Pontecorvo was officially appointed to Tube Alloys on 15 January 1943, and arrived in Montreal with his family on 7 February 1943.{{sfn|Close|2015|p=89}} The Montreal team designed a [[nuclear reactor]] using [[heavy water]] as a neutron moderator, but lacked the quantity of heavy water needed.{{sfn|Close|2015|p=85}} In August 1943, Churchill and Roosevelt negotiated the [[Quebec Agreement]], which resulted in a resumption of cooperation between the United States and Great Britain, merging Tube Alloys into the Manhattan Project.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=168\u2013173}}\n\n[[File:NRX Pile Building and ZEEP Building- Cooling Tanks 1945.jpg|thumb|left|[[NRX]] and [[ZEEP]] buildings at Chalk River in 1945.

The American [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) therefore began looking into their backgrounds. It noted, from its 1943 Manhattan Project files, that Pontecorvo's siblings Giuliana, Laura and Gillo were communists, and that Pontecorvo and Marianne were probably communists too, and reported this to [[MI5]] in Britain, and [[MI6]]'s [[Kim Philby]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=148\u2013154, 197\u2013199}}\n\nIn February 1950, Pontecorvo's Harwell colleague [[Klaus Fuchs]] was arrested for espionage, and the AERE began to take security more seriously,{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=148\u2013154, 197\u2013199}} and Pontecorvo was interviewed by Henry Arnold, the security officer at AERE.

Much of this involved the neutrino, a [[subatomic particle]] first proposed theoretically by [[Wolfgang Pauli]] in 1930 in order to explain undetected energy that escaped during [[beta decay]] so that the law of [[conservation of energy]] was not violated. Fermi named it the neutrino, Italian for \"little neutral one\",{{sfn|Close|2010|pp=15\u201318}} and in 1934, proposed his [[Fermi's interaction|theory of beta decay]] which explained that the electrons emitted from the nucleus were created by the decay of a neutron into a proton, an electron, and a neutrino.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fermi |first=E. |title=Fermi's Theory of Beta Decay |others=Wilson, Fred L.

Coornhert is often considered the Father of Dutch Renaissance scholarship.\n\n==Biography==\nCoornhert was the youngest son of Volckert Coornhert, an [[Amsterdam]] cloth merchant. As a child he spent some years in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. Returning home, he was [[inheritance|disinherited]] by his father's [[Will (law)|will]] in 1539, for his marriage with Cornelia (Neeltje) Simons, a portionless gentlewoman<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> from [[Haarlem]], whose sister was Anna Simonsdr, the mistress of [[Reinoud III van Brederode|Reginald]] (Reinoud), count of [[Castle Brederode|Brederode]] (they were the parents of Lucretia van Brederode). He was only seventeen and she was twelve years older. Through his sister-in-law, he became [[majordomo|major-domo]] to Reginald at his castle in [[Vianen]] for a short time. Soon after that, in 1541, he bought a house in his wife's home town of Haarlem on the St. Janssteeg from Anna and her husband Jan. Though he started off working for Reginald, he lived near the school where the St. Jan [[Commandry (feudalism)|commanderij]] taught classic works and commissioned art. [[Maarten van Heemskerck]] had just returned from Italy and impressed Coornhert with his work. Coornhert became an [[engraver]] on [[copper]], and produced works in collaboration with Heemskerck which became popular.<ref name=Veldman>[http://dbnl.nl/tekst/veld039coor01_01/veld039coor01_01_0001.php Biography of Coornhert] by Ilja M.

He was appointed secretary to the city of [[Haarlem]] (1562) and secretary to the [[burgomaster]]s (1564). Throwing himself into the [[Dutch Revolt|struggle against Spanish rule]], he drew up the manifesto of [[William the Silent]], [[Prince of Orange]] (1566).<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nImprisoned at [[the Hague]] in 1568, he escaped to [[Cleves]], where he maintained himself by his art.

At 30 years of age, having become interested in theology, and being desirous of consulting [[St. Augustine]], he commenced the study of [[Latin language|Latin]]. He entered into controversy alike with [[Catholics]] and [[Dutch Reform Church|Reformers]], with both of whom he refused to communicate. Reformers, he said, were sadly wanted, but those who called themselves such were not the kind that the church required; what was needed was apostles directly inspired from heaven. Until such were sent, he advised all churches to join together in an undogmatic communion. Coornhert wrote and strove in favor of tolerance, opposing [[capital punishment]] for [[heresy|heretics]].

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed, stood {{convert|6|ft|3|in}} tall and weighed {{convert|190|lb}}.\n\nA [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] native, Donovan graduated from [[North Quincy High School]] and served in the [[United States Navy]] during and after [[World War II]]. Signed by the hometown Braves, he reached the major leagues in 1950 but was used sporadically over the next several years. While pitching for the minor league [[Atlanta Crackers]], he learned how to throw a [[Slider (baseball)|slider]], and this helped him claim a spot in the White Sox' rotation in 1955. He was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] in his first major league season, winning 15 games with only nine losses. In 1956, he led the [[American League]] (AL) with a 1.155 [[walks plus hits per innings pitched]]. He led the AL with a .727 winning percentage in 1957, going 16-6, and he won 15 games for the White Sox in 1958. He pitched in the [[1959 World Series]] against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], losing Game 3 but earning the [[Save (baseball)|save]] in Game 5. Donovan struggled in 1960 and moved to the [[bullpen]], then got selected in the [[1960 Major League Baseball expansion draft|expansion draft]] by the Senators after the season. He had his best year with the new club in 1961, leading the AL with a 2.40 [[earned run average]] (ERA), though his won-loss record was just 10-10. Traded to the Indians for [[Jimmy Piersall]] after the season, he won 20 games his first year with Cleveland. Donovan pitched three more years for the Indians after that before getting released midway through 1965. Following his baseball career, he sold insurance and held other jobs in the [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] area before dying of cancer in 1997.\n\nDonovan was unusually good at hitting for a pitcher, homering 15 times in his big-league career.\n\n\n==Early life==\nDonovan was the youngest of five children of Jeremiah and Gertrude Donovan. He grew up in Boston and attended [[North Quincy High School]], where he played [[shortstop]] until converting to [[pitcher]] his senior year. Donovan also pitched for the [[Catholic Youth Organization]]. [[Ken Coleman]], broadcaster for the [[Cleveland Indians]], told the story that once, Donovan was invited to pitch for the [[American Legion]] All-Star team in an exhibition game. Upon arriving at the park, he was told that he would merely be used in the [[bullpen]]. Protesting that he had been promised more, Donovan left the field and went home. \"To me, this incident typified the makeup of Dick. He still has the determination to do what he thinks is right, and has the wonderful ability to see the humor in a situation,\" Coleman said.<ref name=\"SABR\">{{cite web|last=Wancho|first=Joseph|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/af5aebda|title=Dick Donovan|work=SABR|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> Donovan's pitching caught the eye of [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]' scout Jeff Jones, who signed him after his senior year and proclaimed him \"the fire-ballingest pitcher\u201d he had seen since spotting [[Bob Feller]] pitching in high school.

His friend Wyatt gave him the idea to sell insurance, and Donovan had a home business selling insurance during his MLB career. In 1963, he earned his stockbroker's license and joined the reputable firm of Eastman & Dillon in Boston. After his baseball career, he served as the executive vice president for [[Bache & Co.]]. In 1980, he opened a real estate appraisal office in Quincy, which he ran until 1994.

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed, stood {{convert|6|ft|3|in}} tall and weighed {{convert|190|lb}}.\n\nA [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] native, Donovan graduated from [[North Quincy High School]] and served in the [[United States Navy]] during and after [[World War II]]. Signed by the hometown Braves, he reached the major leagues in 1950 but was used sporadically over the next several years. While pitching for the minor league [[Atlanta Crackers]], he learned how to throw a [[Slider (baseball)|slider]], and this helped him claim a spot in the White Sox' rotation in 1955. He was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] in his first major league season, winning 15 games with only nine losses. In 1956, he led the [[American League]] (AL) with a 1.155 [[walks plus hits per innings pitched]]. He led the AL with a .727 winning percentage in 1957, going 16-6, and he won 15 games for the White Sox in 1958. He pitched in the [[1959 World Series]] against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], losing Game 3 but earning the [[Save (baseball)|save]] in Game 5. Donovan struggled in 1960 and moved to the [[bullpen]], then got selected in the [[1960 Major League Baseball expansion draft|expansion draft]] by the Senators after the season. He had his best year with the new club in 1961, leading the AL with a 2.40 [[earned run average]] (ERA), though his won-loss record was just 10-10. Traded to the Indians for [[Jimmy Piersall]] after the season, he won 20 games his first year with Cleveland. Donovan pitched three more years for the Indians after that before getting released midway through 1965. Following his baseball career, he sold insurance and held other jobs in the [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] area before dying of cancer in 1997.\n\nDonovan was unusually good at hitting for a pitcher, homering 15 times in his big-league career.\n\n\n==Early life==\nDonovan was the youngest of five children of Jeremiah and Gertrude Donovan. He grew up in Boston and attended [[North Quincy High School]], where he played [[shortstop]] until converting to [[pitcher]] his senior year. Donovan also pitched for the [[Catholic Youth Organization]]. [[Ken Coleman]], broadcaster for the [[Cleveland Indians]], told the story that once, Donovan was invited to pitch for the [[American Legion]] All-Star team in an exhibition game. Upon arriving at the park, he was told that he would merely be used in the [[bullpen]]. Protesting that he had been promised more, Donovan left the field and went home. \"To me, this incident typified the makeup of Dick. He still has the determination to do what he thinks is right, and has the wonderful ability to see the humor in a situation,\" Coleman said.<ref name=\"SABR\">{{cite web|last=Wancho|first=Joseph|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/af5aebda|title=Dick Donovan|work=SABR|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> Donovan's pitching caught the eye of [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]' scout Jeff Jones, who signed him after his senior year and proclaimed him \"the fire-ballingest pitcher\u201d he had seen since spotting [[Bob Feller]] pitching in high school.

At the plate in his 15-year major league career, Donovan posted a .163 batting average (113-for-694) with 67 runs, 15 home runs, 64 RBI, and 64 walks.<ref name=\"reference\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nDonovan married his wife, Patricia Casey, on February 7, 1959. Patricia, from [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], Massachusetts, was a stewardess for [[United Airlines]]. The couple had two children, Peter and Amy. His friend Wyatt gave him the idea to sell insurance, and Donovan had a home business selling insurance during his MLB career. In 1963, he earned his stockbroker's license and joined the reputable firm of Eastman & Dillon in Boston. After his baseball career, he served as the executive vice president for [[Bache & Co.]]. In 1980, he opened a real estate appraisal office in Quincy, which he ran until 1994. Additionally, Donovan served as distributor with Earth Care Products, a Quincy company that makes products out of recycled plastic.

Some examples can be oxygen, hydrogen, or nitrogen.\n\n===Mixtures===\nIn chemistry, a mixture is a substance containing two or more elements or compounds that are not covalently bound to each other and retain their own chemical and physical identities\u2014a substance which has two or more [[wikt: constituent|constituent]] physical substances. Mixtures, in the broader sense, are two or more substances physically in the same place, but these are not chemically combined, therefore ratios are not necessarily considered.<ref name=mixture>{{Cite encyclopedia| title =Mixture| encyclopedia =Encyclopedia of Environmental Studies| publisher =Online publisher:Science Online. Facts On File, Inc. | year =2001| format =authors: William Ashworth and Charles E. Little}} access date: 2010-01-01</ref> Solid homogeneous mixtures, like gaseous and liquid homogeneous mixtures, contain different elements mixed uniformly and cannot be separated easily.  An example of a solid homogeneous mixture is bronze, which is a mixture of copper and tin.\n\n==Metrics==\nHomogeneous mixtures have the same proportions of the various components throughout a given sample (or multiple samples of different proportion), creating a consistent mixture. However, two homogeneous mixtures of the same pair of substances may differ widely from each other and can be homogenized to make a constant. Homogeneous mixtures always have the same composition. Mixtures can be characterized by being separable by mechanical means e.g. [[heat]], [[filtration]], [[gravitation]]al sorting, centrifugation etc.<ref name=mixture/>\n\nDuring the [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] of heterogeneous mixtures of particles, the variance of the [[sampling error]] is generally non-zero. [[Gy's sampling theory]]<ref>Gy, P. (1979), ''Sampling of Particulate Materials: Theory and Practice'', Elsevier: Amsterdam, 431 pp.</ref> quantitatively defines the '''heterogeneity''' of a particle as:\n\n:<math>h_i = \\frac{(c_i - c_\\text{batch})m_i}{c_\\text{batch} m_\\text{aver}},</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>h_i</math> is the heterogeneity of the <math>i</math> particle of the population,\n:<math>c_i</math> is the mass concentration of the property of interest in the <math>i</math> particle of the population,\n:<math>c_\\text{batch}</math> is the mass concentration of the property of interest in the population,\n:<math>m_i</math> is the mass of the <math>i</math> particle in the population, and\n:<math>m_\\text{aver}</math> is the average mass of a particle in the population.\n\n==Homogenization==\n{{main|Homogenization (chemistry)|Mixing (process engineering)}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chemical substance]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Chemical mixtures]]\n", "name_user": "69.125.196.31", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHomogeneous mixtures)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_and_heterogeneous_mixtures"}

Tim grew up in Pittsburgh. At 10 he started to play the saxophone. In high school he started playing professionally with El Reys. He was also an outstanding high school baseball player and formed a singing group, the El Reys, which made a recording and was popular with Pittsburgh teens. He was also an outstanding high school baseball player.\n\nThen when he was 14, when he was listening to [[Cannonball Adderley]] With Strings. He was so inspired, he picked up the [[alto saxophone]] and within two years many people say that he was playing professionally.\n\n==Career==\nAfter graduating from [[Duquesne University]], Eyermann spent six years in the [[United States Air Force]], playing with the NORAD Band and eventually the U.S. Air Force's  Airmen of Note. After his discharge from the Air Force, Eyermann became a very busy man recording music as a [[Session musician|studio musician]]. He worked with [[Count Basie]], [[Maynard Ferguson]], [[Julie Andrews]], [[The Spinners (U.S. band)|The Spinners]] and [[Anita Baker]]. In 1974, he formed a band called the East Coast Offering. During that period he also was a studio musician at \"Sounds Reasonable\" in Washington, D.C., and recorded many tracks on just about every single and double reed instrument for the Folger Shakespeare Theatre, music by then resident composer William Penn.  This hard-driving yet funky band was accessible with plenty of solo space for his reeds. Many categorize his music as [[jazz]], [[hard bop]], or [[Jazz fusion|fusion]]. Tim was also nominated for two [[Grammy Award|Grammies]]. In 1999 Tim released his most recent album Karla's Fire. Tim used [[Summit Records]] for many years.\n\nAround 2000\u20132002 Eyermann moved to [[Miami, Florida]]. Tim had dreamed of living down there since he was little kid. In Miami he picked teaching as a private music teacher associated with Gulliver Band Director: Bobby Keating. He also worked playing gigs. Tim was a great man who always had a smile on his face. He died on May 1, 2007, due to complications in surgery, pneumonia spread throughout his body while trying to remove a malignant cancer in his lung.
