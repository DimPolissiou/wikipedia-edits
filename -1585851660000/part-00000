He is known for the daring topics of his literary creations, which are both lyrical and thought provoking. He writes primarily in Spanish. The thematic content of his works vary - including the roles and expectations placed on men and women in a changing, yet conservative society, the role of love and perseverance in the face of inhumanity and condemnation and a wake-up call to a higher level of respect for nature, man and differing ways of life.\u201d<ref name=\"Garc\u00eda, Heidi Ann 1996. pp. 157-161\">Garc\u00eda, Heidi Ann. Review: Pastoriza Iyodo, Benito. '''Cuesti\u00f3n de hombres'''. Bronx: Latino Press 1996. 79 pp. {{ISBN|1-884912-08-7}}. ''Chasqui: Revista de Literatura Latinoamericana'', Vol. 35, N\u00famero 2, Nov. 2006, pp. 157-161.</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nBenito Pastoriza Iyodo was born in [[Humacao, Puerto Rico]] and has lived in various states in the United States as well as on his native island. The author\u2019s observations of New York\u2019s Lower East Side, Florida, Chicago, Texas, California and Puerto Rico greatly influenced his writing \u2013 especially impacting his view of masculinity, poverty, cultural identity and women\u2019s issues.\n\n=== Education and early awards ===\nSpanish was the language spoken at home during Pastoriza Iyodo's upbringing, but he attended English-speaking classes when the family lived in the mainland US. He graduated from the [[University of Puerto Rico at Cayey]], where he studied English. He also engrossed himself in Hispanic Studies and won two poetry prizes at the university for: \"Canci\u00f3n para la existencia\" (\"Song for existence\") and \"Hojas\" (\"Leaves\").([http://www.BenitoPastorizaIyodo.com See Author's Awards]) While still at the University of Puerto Rico, he was awarded a prize by the [[Puerto Rican Athenaeum|Ateneo Puertorrique\u00f1o]] for his book of poetry entitled ''Gotas verdes para la ciudad'' (''Green drops for the city'').\n\nPastoriza Iyodo holds a master's degree in Spanish Language and Literature from the [[UCSB|University of California, Santa Barbara]] and he completed his doctoral course work in Romance Languages and Literatures at the [[University of Chicago]].\n\n== Writing philosophy ==\nPastoriza Iyodo has been interviewed several times and the dialogue usually returns to his philosophy on literary creation. In a 2006 interview for ''Chasqui'' (the Spanish-language literary magazine at Arizona State University) he was asked (rendered here in translated form): \u201cWhat do you believe is the role of the writer in today\u2019s dysfunctional society?\u201d To this, Pastoriza Iyodo replied: \u201cA little bit of everything. We must be chroniclers, observers of changing societies - we have to be the flashing yellow light saying: watch out - be careful - where are we going? - let\u2019s not throw ourselves off a cliff. A writer has to be the pulse of a changing language that is constantly reinventing itself. But the writer must not forget that he should also cultivate an art whose intrinsic role is also to entertain, to make one laugh, think and meditate on the important things in life.\u201d<ref name=\"Garc\u00eda, Heidi Ann 1996. pp. 157-161\" />\n\n== Books: Poetry and fiction ==\n\n=== Lo coloro de lo incoloro ===\nHis first book of poetry published in the United States \u2013 ''Lo coloro de lo incoloro'' (''The color of the colorless'') won a prize from the Chicano/Latino Literary Prize competition in 1979-1980.<ref>[http://www.hnet.uci.edu/spanishandportuguese/cllp/History.htm Chicano/Latino Literary Prize - History<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120802041908/http://www.hnet.uci.edu/spanishandportuguese/cllp/History.htm |date=2012-08-02 }}</ref> From the beginning, Pastoriza Iyodo has always considered himself to be a poet. His poetry defies Spanish-language poetic conventions, showing a propensity to put contemporary devices to good use in the Spanish language. One poem may resemble the traditional sonnet, while another may flow in quasi-sentences bereft of punctuation (\u00e0 la e. e. cummings) as if it were to be read in a single \u2013 exhilarating breath.\n\n=== Cuestion de hombres ===\nIn the 1980s he began to experiment with the narrative and won his second prize from the [[Puerto Rican Athenaeum|Ateneo Puertorrique\u00f1o]] for the short story \u201cEl indiscreto encanto\u201d (\u201cThe Indiscrete Charm\u201d). By the mid-nineties he had written a collection of nine stories, all of which featured male protagonists. The Latino Press (CUNY) published ''Cuesti\u00f3n de hombres'' (''A Matter of Men'') in 1996.\n\nA second edition of this title was published in December 2006, adding a prologue by Carlos Manuel Rivera, Ph.D. (currently a professor at Bronx Community College). This edition was preceded by a review in '''Chasqui: Revista de Literatura Latinoamericana''' at Arizona State University (translated into English):\n<blockquote>\n''Cuesti\u00f3n de hombres''... lays out, in a poetic manner, in diaphanous language with innovative and daring images, the evolution of man from youth to adulthood, not defined by age, but through the encounter with one\u2019s self.<ref>Garc\u00eda, Heidi Ann. Review: Pastoriza Iyodo, Benito. '''Cuesti\u00f3n de hombres'''. Bronx: Latino Press 1996. 79 pp. {{ISBN|1-884912-08-7}}.''Chasqui: Revista de Literatura Latinoamericana'', Vol. 35, N\u00famero 2, Nov. 2006, pp. 157-161.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Cartas a la sombra de tu piel ===\nThen the author returned to poetry, with two collections released in rapid succession (2002 and 2003). The first of the two books, ''Cartas \u00e0 la sombra de tu piel'' (''Letters to the shadow of your skin'') chronicles the birth of the prefigured love, in all of its aspects: through its metaphysical inception, physical appearance, passion and solidarity in a society that insists on the continued taboo nature of same-sex partners. As stressed by an article in the Caribbean Quarterly: <blockquote>\n\u201cThe poems and prose pieces in each section portray a world that is vibrant, charged with life, vivid images of lovers in warm embraces, feelings of nostalgia, reminiscences on past erotic experiences and anxious anticipation of future ones. ... Bilingualism functions as an important rhetorical strategy and is demonstrated in different ways. Some poems are written in English entirely but most are in Spanish. ... This switching between linguistic modes is dominant in poems in which the poet advocates a ready acceptance and tolerance of difference \u2013 suggesting that sexuality is not limited to heterosexuality, in the same way that the same emotion can be communicated in different languages. ... Cartas a la sombra de tu piel is an intriguing addition to Spanish Caribbean poetry in general and specifically to the area of queer theory, a contemporary approach to literature and culture which developed out of gay and lesbian criticism, and regards sexual identities as fluid. It should provide interesting reading and generate much discussion.\"<ref>Paulette A. Ramsey. Review: Cartas a la sombra de tu piel by Benito Pastoriza Iyodo. M\u00e9xico: Editoral Tierra Firme, 2002. 80 pp., ''Caribbean Quarterly'', Vol. 51, No. 2, June 2005, pp. 100-105.</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\n=== Eleg\u00edas de septiembre ===\n''Eleg\u00edas de septiembre'' (''September Elegies''), on the other hand, focuses on man\u2019s inhumanity to both nature and man. This collection of poems was published in 2003, when talk of global warming had not yet reached the heightened pitch of An Inconvenient Truth. It begins with a section entitled \"Natura Viva Natura Mortua.\" This Latin phrase could be mistaken for a \u201cstill-life\u201d, but what it represents is a wake-up call for man to change his insensitive and apathetic attitude toward nature, which \u2013 once beautiful \u2013 is being destroyed by our selfish consumerism. Similar attitudes toward poverty and geopolitics are also explored \u2013 in beautiful poetic fashion \u2013 in a way to make one think and meditate on the causes and cures of the human condition. In the prologue, Mexican writer Estela Porter Seale states (as translated into English):\n<blockquote>\n\"This work could be described as a thesis condemning optimistic rationalism [that believes] \u201cours is the best of all possible worlds\u201d, advocating against all forms of extreme individualism that diminish the possibility of a harmonious coexistence with all things....\" [From the Prologue by Estela Porter Seale in Pastoriza Iyodo, Benito. ''Eleg\u00edas de septiembre''. Editorial Tierra Firme, Mexico City, 2003, pp 5-9.]</blockquote>\n\n=== Nena, nena de mi coraz\u00f3n ===\n''Nena, nena de mi coraz\u00f3n'' (''Beloved, beloved of my heart'') is a new collection of short stories released in December 2006, at the same time as the second edition of ''Cuesti\u00f3n de hombres'' (''A Matter of Men''). While the protagonists in the latter work were men, ''Nena'' features female characters in tales of Latino displacement often resulting in transference and transformation in the process. The principal characters circulate and circumnavigate within multiple geographic, political, historical and social spheres pertaining to the ever-changing Hispanic reality.

Set in the tropics, with the sea, rivers and waterfalls, the poetic presentation of the tale draws the reader into the cinematic pace of the book. The resolution of intimate conflicts sheds light on the effect of society's expectations on the nature of all types of relationships - making the novel both entertaining and thought-provoking.

Use of the term \u201cbrothel\u201d goes beyond the world associated with the sexual act. The poetic subject moves from the confines of a building (the brothel) to those spaces where prostitution manifests itself in all things impure and many times in the masked manipulation of language and humanity within a broader and more global brothel.\n\n== Other publications ==\nPastoriza Iyodo continues collaborating with academic and literary magazines in the United States.

He is known for the daring topics of his literary creations, which are both lyrical and thought provoking. He writes primarily in Spanish. The thematic content of his works vary - including the roles and expectations placed on men and women in a changing, yet conservative society, the role of love and perseverance in the face of inhumanity and condemnation and a wake-up call to a higher level of respect for nature, man and differing ways of life.\u201d<ref name=\"Garc\u00eda, Heidi Ann 1996. pp. 157-161\">Garc\u00eda, Heidi Ann. Review: Pastoriza Iyodo, Benito. '''Cuesti\u00f3n de hombres'''. Bronx: Latino Press 1996. 79 pp. {{ISBN|1-884912-08-7}}. ''Chasqui: Revista de Literatura Latinoamericana'', Vol. 35, N\u00famero 2, Nov. 2006, pp. 157-161.</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nBenito Pastoriza Iyodo was born in [[Humacao, Puerto Rico]] and has lived in various states in the United States as well as on his native island. The author\u2019s observations of New York\u2019s Lower East Side, Florida, Chicago, Texas, California and Puerto Rico greatly influenced his writing \u2013 especially impacting his view of masculinity, poverty, cultural identity and women\u2019s issues.\n\n=== Education and early awards ===\nSpanish was the language spoken at home during Pastoriza Iyodo's upbringing, but he attended English-speaking classes when the family lived in the mainland US. He graduated from the [[University of Puerto Rico at Cayey]], where he studied English. He also engrossed himself in Hispanic Studies and won two poetry prizes at the university for: \"Canci\u00f3n para la existencia\" (\"Song for existence\") and \"Hojas\" (\"Leaves\").([http://www.BenitoPastorizaIyodo.com See Author's Awards]) While still at the University of Puerto Rico, he was awarded a prize by the [[Puerto Rican Athenaeum|Ateneo Puertorrique\u00f1o]] for his book of poetry entitled ''Gotas verdes para la ciudad'' (''Green drops for the city'').\n\nPastoriza Iyodo holds a master's degree in Spanish Language and Literature from the [[UCSB|University of California, Santa Barbara]] and he completed his doctoral course work in Romance Languages and Literatures at the [[University of Chicago]].\n\n== Writing philosophy ==\nPastoriza Iyodo has been interviewed several times and the dialogue usually returns to his philosophy on literary creation. In a 2006 interview for ''Chasqui'' (the Spanish-language literary magazine at Arizona State University) he was asked (rendered here in translated form): \u201cWhat do you believe is the role of the writer in today\u2019s dysfunctional society?\u201d To this, Pastoriza Iyodo replied: \u201cA little bit of everything. We must be chroniclers, observers of changing societies - we have to be the flashing yellow light saying: watch out - be careful - where are we going? - let\u2019s not throw ourselves off a cliff. A writer has to be the pulse of a changing language that is constantly reinventing itself. But the writer must not forget that he should also cultivate an art whose intrinsic role is also to entertain, to make one laugh, think and meditate on the important things in life.\u201d<ref name=\"Garc\u00eda, Heidi Ann 1996. pp. 157-161\" />\n\n== Books: Poetry and fiction ==\n\n=== Lo coloro de lo incoloro ===\nHis first book of poetry published in the United States \u2013 ''Lo coloro de lo incoloro'' (''The color of the colorless'') won a prize from the Chicano/Latino Literary Prize competition in 1979-1980.<ref>[http://www.hnet.uci.edu/spanishandportuguese/cllp/History.htm Chicano/Latino Literary Prize - History<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120802041908/http://www.hnet.uci.edu/spanishandportuguese/cllp/History.htm |date=2012-08-02 }}</ref> From the beginning, Pastoriza Iyodo has always considered himself to be a poet. His poetry defies Spanish-language poetic conventions, showing a propensity to put contemporary devices to good use in the Spanish language. One poem may resemble the traditional sonnet, while another may flow in quasi-sentences bereft of punctuation (\u00e0 la e. e. cummings) as if it were to be read in a single \u2013 exhilarating breath.\n\n=== Cuestion de hombres ===\nIn the 1980s he began to experiment with the narrative and won his second prize from the [[Puerto Rican Athenaeum|Ateneo Puertorrique\u00f1o]] for the short story \u201cEl indiscreto encanto\u201d (\u201cThe Indiscrete Charm\u201d). By the mid-nineties he had written a collection of nine stories, all of which featured male protagonists. The Latino Press (CUNY) published ''Cuesti\u00f3n de hombres'' (''A Matter of Men'') in 1996.\n\nA second edition of this title was published in December 2006, adding a prologue by Carlos Manuel Rivera, Ph.D. (currently a professor at Bronx Community College). This edition was preceded by a review in '''Chasqui: Revista de Literatura Latinoamericana''' at Arizona State University (translated into English):\n<blockquote>\n''Cuesti\u00f3n de hombres''... lays out, in a poetic manner, in diaphanous language with innovative and daring images, the evolution of man from youth to adulthood, not defined by age, but through the encounter with one\u2019s self.<ref>Garc\u00eda, Heidi Ann.

Bronx: Latino Press 1996. 79 pp. {{ISBN|1-884912-08-7}}.''Chasqui: Revista de Literatura Latinoamericana'', Vol. 35, N\u00famero 2, Nov. 2006, pp. 157-161.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Cartas a la sombra de tu piel ===\nThen the author returned to poetry, with two collections released in rapid succession (2002 and 2003). The first of the two books, ''Cartas \u00e0 la sombra de tu piel'' (''Letters to the shadow of your skin'') chronicles the birth of the prefigured love, in all of its aspects: through its metaphysical inception, physical appearance, passion and solidarity in a society that insists on the continued taboo nature of same-sex partners. As stressed by an article in the Caribbean Quarterly: <blockquote>\n\u201cThe poems and prose pieces in each section portray a world that is vibrant, charged with life, vivid images of lovers in warm embraces, feelings of nostalgia, reminiscences on past erotic experiences and anxious anticipation of future ones. ... Bilingualism functions as an important rhetorical strategy and is demonstrated in different ways. Some poems are written in English entirely but most are in Spanish. ... This switching between linguistic modes is dominant in poems in which the poet advocates a ready acceptance and tolerance of difference \u2013 suggesting that sexuality is not limited to heterosexuality, in the same way that the same emotion can be communicated in different languages. ... Cartas a la sombra de tu piel is an intriguing addition to Spanish Caribbean poetry in general and specifically to the area of queer theory, a contemporary approach to literature and culture which developed out of gay and lesbian criticism, and regards sexual identities as fluid. It should provide interesting reading and generate much discussion.\"<ref>Paulette A. Ramsey. Review: Cartas a la sombra de tu piel by Benito Pastoriza Iyodo. M\u00e9xico: Editoral Tierra Firme, 2002. 80 pp., ''Caribbean Quarterly'', Vol. 51, No. 2, June 2005, pp. 100-105.</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\n=== Eleg\u00edas de septiembre ===\n''Eleg\u00edas de septiembre'' (''September Elegies''), on the other hand, focuses on man\u2019s inhumanity to both nature and man. This collection of poems was published in 2003, when talk of global warming had not yet reached the heightened pitch of An Inconvenient Truth. It begins with a section entitled \"Natura Viva Natura Mortua.\" This Latin phrase could be mistaken for a \u201cstill-life\u201d, but what it represents is a wake-up call for man to change his insensitive and apathetic attitude toward nature, which \u2013 once beautiful \u2013 is being destroyed by our selfish consumerism. Similar attitudes toward poverty and geopolitics are also explored \u2013 in beautiful poetic fashion \u2013 in a way to make one think and meditate on the causes and cures of the human condition. In the prologue, Mexican writer Estela Porter Seale states (as translated into English):\n<blockquote>\n\"This work could be described as a thesis condemning optimistic rationalism [that believes] \u201cours is the best of all possible worlds\u201d, advocating against all forms of extreme individualism that diminish the possibility of a harmonious coexistence with all things....\" [From the Prologue by Estela Porter Seale in Pastoriza Iyodo, Benito. ''Eleg\u00edas de septiembre''. Editorial Tierra Firme, Mexico City, 2003, pp 5-9.]</blockquote>\n\n=== Nena, nena de mi coraz\u00f3n ===\n''Nena, nena de mi coraz\u00f3n'' (''Beloved, beloved of my heart'') is a new collection of short stories released in December 2006, at the same time as the second edition of ''Cuesti\u00f3n de hombres'' (''A Matter of Men''). While the protagonists in the latter work were men, ''Nena'' features female characters in tales of Latino displacement often resulting in transference and transformation in the process. The principal characters circulate and circumnavigate within multiple geographic, political, historical and social spheres pertaining to the ever-changing Hispanic reality. A review published in '''Criticas Magazine''' states: <blockquote>\n\u201cThe 16 parts, \u2026 are presented in the form of vignettes, epistles, chronicles, or commentaries. In spite of major hardships, the characters keep on searching for a better life in places that seem indifferent and even hostile.

There are stairs and escalators along State Street between Randolph and Madison to access both mezzanines.

It is the third and best known of three books featuring the Makepeace sisters, Charlotte and Emma,<ref>Anita Silvey, ed: ''Children's books and their creators'' (New York, Houghton Mifflin, 1995), p. 238.</ref> sometimes known as the ''Aviary Hall'' books.<ref>[http://www.kidlit.co.uk/chars/c/xc030403.htm]</ref> The book inspired [[Charlotte Sometimes (song)|a song of the same name]] in 2007,<ref name=Farmer2007>''Charlotte Sometimes'' author Penelope Farmer [https://web.archive.org/web/20080512233831/http://grannyp.blogspot.com/2007/06/cured.html one]</ref> and a number by the English rock band [[The Cure]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080218140007/http://grannyp.blogspot.com/2007/06/cured-climaxed.html two] (via [[Archive.org]])</ref> The story centres on a girl starting at a [[boarding school]], who finds she has travelled mysteriously back more than 40 years. There the teachers and students call her \"Clare\". Charlotte and Clare change places each night, alternating between the years 1918 and Charlotte's time.<ref>Charlotte travels back to 1918 (p. 77). In Charlotte's time, the year is 1963, as the book states that Clare's time is more than 40 years before Charlotte's, and that 14 September was a Saturday in both years. The events take place about a year after those in ''The Summer Birds'', set in southern England in the early 1960s. Another World War I time-slip novel of the same period is the more matter-of-fact ''[[Jessamy]]'' (1967) by [[Barbara Sleigh]].</ref> Although Charlotte and Clare never meet, they communicate through diary notes in an exercise book. The story is wholly written from Charlotte's point of view: Clare never narrates. As it progresses, Charlotte becomes trapped in Clare's time, struggling to maintain her own identity.\n\n==Background==\nAt the age of 21, Penelope Farmer was contracted for her first collection of short stories, ''The China People''. One story originally intended for it proved too long to include. This was rewritten as the first chapter of ''[[The Summer Birds]]'' (1962), her first book featuring Charlotte and Emma Makepeace.<ref>\"Penelope Farmer\" in ''Something About the Author'' 105 (1999) p. 67.</ref> A second book, ''[[Emma in Winter]]'', with Emma as the main character followed in 1966. ''Charlotte Sometimes'' was first published in 1969 by Harcourt in the United States, and by Chatto and Windus in the UK in the same year.\n\nPenelope Farmer arranged many incidents in ''Charlotte Sometimes'' ahead of time, based on family experiences.<ref>Margaret K. McElderry, \"Penelope Farmer: The Development of an Author\". In ''Elementary English'' Vol. 51, No. 6, September 1974, p. 804. Quoted in ''Children's Literature Review'' Vol. 8. Gale Research Company, 1985.</ref> She later wrote that Charlotte and Emma were originally based on her mother and her mother's sister as children, having no parents and \"having to be everything to each other,\" one being the responsible one, the other being rather difficult. She wrote, \"Emma and Charlotte have grown in their own ways and aren't exactly based on my mother and her sister now, but this is where it started.\"<ref name=\"Penelope Farmer 1985 p. 77.\">'Penelope Farmer' in ''Something About the Author'' 40 (1985) p. 77.</ref> Penelope Farmer's mother, Penelope Boothby, who was \"talkative and unconventional\", besides being the inspiration for Emma, was also the inspiration for the character of Emily.<ref>'Penelope Farmer' in ''Something About the Author'' 105 (1999) p. 66.</ref> The boarding school in the novel is set near where Penelope Farmer lived in London.<ref name=\"Penelope Farmer 1985 p. 77.\" /> Its pillared front door, glass verandah and cedar tree reflect the [[West Heath School]] in Sevenoaks, which she and her twin sister Judith attended in the 1950s.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080512233831/http://grannyp.blogspot.com/2007/06/cured.html \"The Cure(d)\".

The episode when Charlotte walks onto the glass verandah is based on a real event, when Penelope Farmer climbed on glass and broke it.<ref>[http://grannyp.blogspot.com/search/label/Charlotte%20Sometimes%20and%20The%20Cure. Penelope Farmer's personal blog entry, 21 November 2007]</ref>\n\nTwo versions of the novel's text exist. A revised edition published by Dell in 1985 has a number of changes made by the author. Almost all the revisions were minor, such as modernisation of vocabulary and punctuation and minor re-wording of sentences. The most significant change is that a few events at the end of the story are dropped. These include a poignant episode where Charlotte, back in her own time, receives a package and a letter from Clare's sister, Emily, as an adult. Also removed is the original ending, in which the end of term comes and the boarders ride away in the school bus, Charlotte among them heading home to Aviary Hall.\n\nThe book has been re-issued, with the original text, in [[The New York Review Children's Collection]].\n\n==Plot==\n===Part one===\nCharlotte arrives at a new boarding school, and is shown around by a [[prefect]] named Sarah. Sarah's mother also attended the school. She is to share a room with other girls (Suzanna and Elizabeth). The next morning she finds herself in the same place, but in the year 1918 \u2013 with war still going on. A younger girl called Emily calls Charlotte her sister and addresses her as \"Clare\". She tries to spend the day in 1918 without being noticed. Each night, Charlotte finds herself swapping between her own time and Clare's time. They must learn to live two different lives. Charlotte and Clare manage to write to each other in Clare's diary, which they share and hide in their bed.\n\nEmily and Clare are supposed to leave their room soon and go into lodgings with the Chisel Brown family. They have to make sure this happens when Clare is in 1918, because they won't be able to switch again after that.\n\n===Part two===\nCharlotte, expecting to have returned to her own time for the last time, is shocked to find that she has not, and is still in 1918. She will go into lodgings with the Chisel Brown family: it appears she will be trapped in the past. In the house, Miss Agnes Chisel Brown shows Charlotte and Emily the toys she had once played with. These include toy soldiers and a solitaire board with marbles. She tells the two girls about her brother Arthur, who died in the [[World War I|war]]. Charlotte reflects, forward and back: to Arthur in the past; her own sister Emma in the future; and Clare, trapped in Charlotte's time. She struggles with her identity as being Charlotte sometimes, but Clare at other times.\n\nCharlotte and Emily form a plan to enter the school by night in an attempt to get Charlotte into the bed which will take Charlotte back to her own time. Inside her room, which is now being used as the school sick room, Charlotte finds the bed is occupied, and thus she cannot return home. She escapes being seen by Nurse Gregory, but is seen by another student, Ruth.\n\nCharlotte is not the only one who struggles with identity. Emily tells of the wretchedness of being motherless and unwanted, moving around between homes while her father fights in the war. Meanwhile, Charlotte dreams she is fighting to stay as Charlotte. She dreams about Arthur.\n\nA letter arrives for Clare and Emily from their father. Emily does not let Charlotte read it, to the bewilderment of the other girls. Charlotte, thoughtful as always, wonders who Sarah's mother is: perhaps it will be Charlotte herself if she is trapped in 1918?\n\nAt night, Charlotte dreams about Arthur again, as a drummer boy, and that she has turned into Agnes. Her crisis of identity comes to a head as she struggles to preserve her identity as Charlotte.\n\nOne evening, the Chisel Browns hold a [[seance]] in an attempt to speak to Arthur. The girls hide behind the curtains to observe. During the seance, they hear Clare's voice crying out for Emily. Emily cries out, and the two girls are discovered and disciplined. Later, Miss Agnes asks about the voice they heard at the seance \u2013 Clare's. She then tells Charlotte and Emily of Arthur's war experiences.\n\nFinally, the [[Armistice]] comes. The war is over: people dance and celebrate in the street, and Charlotte and Emily join in, even though it would anger Mr Chisel Brown. In disgrace, Charlotte and Emily are sent back to the school. Miss Agnes gives them the toys as a gift.\n\n===Part three===\nRuth recalls her \"dream\" of seeing Clare whilst in the sick room. Because of the [[Spanish flu|flu epidemic]], the students are able to play wild games in the dormitories, and eventually Charlotte is able to sleep in the bed that will return her to her own time.\n\nOn arriving back, Charlotte is startled to learn that her room-mate Elizabeth had deduced the truth about her swap with Clare. Charlotte wonders about Sarah's mother and what has become of Emily and Clare. At the school, Charlotte sees the elderly Miss Wilkin. Charlotte realises that she had known Miss Wilkin when she was a young teacher in 1918.\n\nOne day, Charlotte learns what has become of Emily and Clare through a conversation with Sarah. Sarah's mother is Emily, and Clare died in the flu epidemic after the war. Later, Charlotte and Elizabeth discuss the events Charlotte has experienced. They find the exercise book in the bed leg, where it has been for forty years. It includes the last letter Charlotte wrote to Clare.\n\nCharlotte receives a package from Emily as an adult. It contains a letter from Emily, and the toys which Miss Agnes had given them over forty years ago. Charlotte places the marbles from the solitaire set in a jar and fills it with water, which the other girls admire.  Charlotte feels a sense of personal identity in now having her own decoration to her dresser, yet muses that the marbles belonged her when she was living the life of another person, namely Clare. The end of term comes, and the boarders leave the school in the school bus, singing rhymes. <ref>Penelope Farmer ''Charlotte Sometimes'', Harcourt, 1969. (This last episode is not in the 1985 revised edition</ref>\n\n==Continuity==\n''Charlotte Sometimes'' begins one year after the ending of ''The Summer Birds'', after Charlotte has left her small village school, and covers the period of her first term at boarding school. While written three years after ''Emma in Winter'' \u2014 set during Charlotte's second term at boarding school \u2014 the events of ''Charlotte Sometimes'' occur beforehand. Charlotte's sister Emma and their grandfather Elijah do not appear in ''Charlotte Sometimes'', although there are references to them. For example, Charlotte compares Emily with her sister Emma in her own time, and compares the Chisel Brown family home with her own home, Aviary Hall.\n\n''Emma in Winter'' begins during the same Christmas holidays where ''Charlotte Sometimes'' ends, and indicates that Charlotte will stay a week with one of the friends she made at boarding school during the events of ''Charlotte Sometimes''.<ref>Penelope Farmer, ''Emma in Winter''. London: [[Chatto & Windus]], 1969, p. 6.</ref> ''Emma in Winter'' then follows Emma's story while Charlotte returns to boarding school.\n\n==Themes==\n===Identity===\nWhile writing ''Emma in Winter'', Farmer was not aware that identity was such a dominant theme in the book. She only realised this later, when she read [[Margery Fisher]]'s comments on the book in ''Growing Point''. She had a similar realisation, this time on her own, while writing ''Charlotte Sometimes''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Writers, Critics, and Children |url=https://archive.org/details/writerscriticsch00foxg |url-access=registration |editor= Geoff Fox |editor2= Graham Hammond |editor3=Terry Jones |editor4=Frederic Smith |editor5= Kenneth Sterck |year=1976 |publisher=Agathon Press |location=New York |isbn=0-87586-054-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/writerscriticsch00foxg/page/60 60]}}</ref> She writes that \"halfway through ''Charlotte Sometimes'' I realized that I was writing a book about identity. I am a twin, a nonidentical one, and apparently one of the chief problems of nonidentical twins is always the establishment of a genuine and separate sense of identity. Looking back I can see this has in fact been an obsession with me, since the age of twelve or so at least.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Penelope (Jane) Farmer 1939- |journal=Children's Literature Review |date=1985 |volume=8 |page=65}}</ref>\n\nAuthor [[David Rees (author)|David Rees]] also points out that identity as a major theme. He wrote, \"Its most memorable passages are poignant or resigned or concerned with absence, loss, or death.... Its theme is not so much maturing relationships, but identity....  Charlotte begins to wonder, with increasing dismay, if she really is Charlotte: perhaps she has turned into Clare, rather than just substituted for her. This may be an adult fear \u2013 the fear of not being everything you and other people have always said you are, the realization that you may be someone totally different.\"<ref name=\"Rees\">David Rees, \"The Marble in the Water: Penelope Farmer\". In ''The Marble in the Water: Essays on Contemporary Writers of Fiction for Children and Young Adults'', The Horn Book, Inc., 1980, pp. 1\u201313. Quoted in ''Children's Literature Review'', Vol. 8. Gale Research Company, 1985.</ref>\n\n===Time Travel===\n''Charlotte Sometimes'' continues the theme, begun in ''Emma in Winter'', of time travel into the past. While this is unexplained in ''Charlotte Sometimes'', a theorised explanation appears in ''Emma in Winter''. Emma and Bobby are reading journals in Emma and Charlotte's grandfather Elijah's study, where they find an article theorising about the non-linear nature of time. It describes time as being like a coiled spring, which can be pushed together, so that some moments in time can be very near a moment in another time.<ref>Penelope Farmer, ''Emma in Winter''. London: Chatto & Windus, 1969, Chapter 4.</ref>\n\n==Reviews==\n''Charlotte Sometimes'' received widespread critical acclaim.\n\n[[Margery Fisher]], in a 1969 review for her children's literature journal ''Growing Point'', wrote, \"Like ''Emma in Winter'', this is really a study in disintegration, the study of a girl finding an identity by losing it.... Above all, here is a dream-allegory which teaches not through statement but through feeling. We sense the meaning of Charlotte's changes of identity in the way that she senses them herself.... [It is] a book of quite exceptional distinction... a haunting, convincing story which comes close to being a masterpiece of its kind....\"<ref>Margery Fisher, review of ''Charlotte Sometimes'', ''Growing Point'', November 1969, p. 1408, cited in ''Something About the Author'' 105 (1999) p. 68.</ref>\n\nChildren's novelist [[Eleanor Cameron]] wrote, \"Farmer writes with style. She is vivid in her depiction of place: on almost every page, scattered with colorful figures of speech, we are drawn into the school and the surroundings of the school through sights and sounds and smells and textures... above all we are moved by the depth and poignancy of the relationship between Charlotte and Emily.\" She continues, \"Farmer is always gifted in her grasp of possibilities that bring us up short with surprise and delight and satisfaction.\"<ref name=\"Dell\">Penelope Farmer''Charlotte Sometimes''. Revised edition, Dell, 1985, rear cover.</ref>\n\nNeil Millar in the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' wrote, \"''Charlotte Sometimes'' is a book of quite exceptional distinction.... The book is essentially about humanity caught up in the still trickery of time.... Not easily forgotten.\"<ref>Neil Millar, \"Tales from School\", in ''The Christian Science Monitor'', 6 November 1969. p. B5.  Quoted in ''Children's Literature Review'' Vol. 8. Gale Research Company, 1985.</ref>\n\nIn 1969, ''The Sunday Times'' described the book as \"this year's most haunting fantasy\".<ref name=\"Dell\" />\n\nChildren's publisher [[Margaret K. McElderry]] wrote, \"[''Charlotte Sometimes''] is a fascinating exploration of the fragile barriers between layers of time, handled with great skill in the writing and delicacy of perception.<ref>Margaret K. McElderry, \"Penelope Farmer: The Development of an Author\". In ''Elementary English'' Vol. 51, No. 6, September 1974, p. 802-803. Quoted in ''Children's Literature Review'' Vol. 8. Gale Research Company, 1985.</ref>\n\nThe British children's author [[David Rees (author)|David Rees]] wrote in 1980 of how \"the book is none the worse for breaking the conventional bounds of the children's novel. It is probably Penelope Farmer's finest novel \u2013 complex, taut, not a word wrong \u2013 and it thoroughly deserves the popularity it has attained.\"<ref name=\"Rees\" />\n\nPeggy Heeks writes in ''Twentieth-Century Children's Writers'' that ''Charlotte Sometimes'' \"shows a brilliant handling of the time-switch technique and a sincerity which rejects slick solutions to the dilemmas of the two heroines.\"<ref>Peggy Heeks, entry in ''Twentieth-Century Children's Writers'', ed. Tracy Chevalier, 3rd ed.

It is the third and best known of three books featuring the Makepeace sisters, Charlotte and Emma,<ref>Anita Silvey, ed: ''Children's books and their creators'' (New York, Houghton Mifflin, 1995), p. 238.</ref> sometimes known as the ''Aviary Hall'' books.<ref>[http://www.kidlit.co.uk/chars/c/xc030403.htm]</ref> The book inspired [[Charlotte Sometimes (song)|a song of the same name]] in 2007,<ref name=Farmer2007>''Charlotte Sometimes'' author Penelope Farmer [https://web.archive.org/web/20080512233831/http://grannyp.blogspot.com/2007/06/cured.html one]</ref> and a number by the English rock band [[The Cure]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080218140007/http://grannyp.blogspot.com/2007/06/cured-climaxed.html two] (via [[Archive.org]])</ref> The story centres on a girl starting at a [[boarding school]], who finds she has travelled mysteriously back more than 40 years. There the teachers and students call her \"Clare\". Charlotte and Clare change places each night, alternating between the years 1918 and Charlotte's time.<ref>Charlotte travels back to 1918 (p. 77). In Charlotte's time, the year is 1963, as the book states that Clare's time is more than 40 years before Charlotte's, and that 14 September was a Saturday in both years. The events take place about a year after those in ''The Summer Birds'', set in southern England in the early 1960s. Another World War I time-slip novel of the same period is the more matter-of-fact ''[[Jessamy]]'' (1967) by [[Barbara Sleigh]].</ref> Although Charlotte and Clare never meet, they communicate through diary notes in an exercise book. The story is wholly written from Charlotte's point of view: Clare never narrates. As it progresses, Charlotte becomes trapped in Clare's time, struggling to maintain her own identity.\n\n==Background==\nAt the age of 21, Penelope Farmer was contracted for her first collection of short stories, ''The China People''. One story originally intended for it proved too long to include. This was rewritten as the first chapter of ''[[The Summer Birds]]'' (1962), her first book featuring Charlotte and Emma Makepeace.<ref>\"Penelope Farmer\" in ''Something About the Author'' 105 (1999) p. 67.</ref> A second book, ''[[Emma in Winter]]'', with Emma as the main character followed in 1966. ''Charlotte Sometimes'' was first published in 1969 by Harcourt in the United States, and by Chatto and Windus in the UK in the same year.\n\nPenelope Farmer arranged many incidents in ''Charlotte Sometimes'' ahead of time, based on family experiences.<ref>Margaret K. McElderry, \"Penelope Farmer: The Development of an Author\". In ''Elementary English'' Vol. 51, No. 6, September 1974, p. 804. Quoted in ''Children's Literature Review'' Vol. 8. Gale Research Company, 1985.</ref> She later wrote that Charlotte and Emma were originally based on her mother and her mother's sister as children, having no parents and \"having to be everything to each other,\" one being the responsible one, the other being rather difficult. She wrote, \"Emma and Charlotte have grown in their own ways and aren't exactly based on my mother and her sister now, but this is where it started.\"<ref name=\"Penelope Farmer 1985 p. 77.\">'Penelope Farmer' in ''Something About the Author'' 40 (1985) p. 77.</ref> Penelope Farmer's mother, Penelope Boothby, who was \"talkative and unconventional\", besides being the inspiration for Emma, was also the inspiration for the character of Emily.<ref>'Penelope Farmer' in ''Something About the Author'' 105 (1999) p. 66.</ref> The boarding school in the novel is set near where Penelope Farmer lived in London.<ref name=\"Penelope Farmer 1985 p. 77.\" /> Its pillared front door, glass verandah and cedar tree reflect the [[West Heath School]] in Sevenoaks, which she and her twin sister Judith attended in the 1950s.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080512233831/http://grannyp.blogspot.com/2007/06/cured.html \"The Cure(d)\". Penelope Farmer's personal blog entry, 9 June 2007]</ref> Some of the characters there were based on real students of the time. The episode when Charlotte walks onto the glass verandah is based on a real event, when Penelope Farmer climbed on glass and broke it.<ref>[http://grannyp.blogspot.com/search/label/Charlotte%20Sometimes%20and%20The%20Cure. Penelope Farmer's personal blog entry, 21 November 2007]</ref>\n\nTwo versions of the novel's text exist. A revised edition published by Dell in 1985 has a number of changes made by the author. Almost all the revisions were minor, such as modernisation of vocabulary and punctuation and minor re-wording of sentences. The most significant change is that a few events at the end of the story are dropped. These include a poignant episode where Charlotte, back in her own time, receives a package and a letter from Clare's sister, Emily, as an adult. Also removed is the original ending, in which the end of term comes and the boarders ride away in the school bus, Charlotte among them heading home to Aviary Hall.\n\nThe book has been re-issued, with the original text, in [[The New York Review Children's Collection]].\n\n==Plot==\n===Part one===\nCharlotte arrives at a new boarding school, and is shown around by a [[prefect]] named Sarah. Sarah's mother also attended the school. She is to share a room with other girls (Suzanna and Elizabeth). The next morning she finds herself in the same place, but in the year 1918 \u2013 with war still going on. A younger girl called Emily calls Charlotte her sister and addresses her as \"Clare\". She tries to spend the day in 1918 without being noticed. Each night, Charlotte finds herself swapping between her own time and Clare's time. They must learn to live two different lives. Charlotte and Clare manage to write to each other in Clare's diary, which they share and hide in their bed.\n\nEmily and Clare are supposed to leave their room soon and go into lodgings with the Chisel Brown family. They have to make sure this happens when Clare is in 1918, because they won't be able to switch again after that.\n\n===Part two===\nCharlotte, expecting to have returned to her own time for the last time, is shocked to find that she has not, and is still in 1918. She will go into lodgings with the Chisel Brown family: it appears she will be trapped in the past. In the house, Miss Agnes Chisel Brown shows Charlotte and Emily the toys she had once played with. These include toy soldiers and a solitaire board with marbles. She tells the two girls about her brother Arthur, who died in the [[World War I|war]]. Charlotte reflects, forward and back: to Arthur in the past; her own sister Emma in the future; and Clare, trapped in Charlotte's time. She struggles with her identity as being Charlotte sometimes, but Clare at other times.\n\nCharlotte and Emily form a plan to enter the school by night in an attempt to get Charlotte into the bed which will take Charlotte back to her own time. Inside her room, which is now being used as the school sick room, Charlotte finds the bed is occupied, and thus she cannot return home. She escapes being seen by Nurse Gregory, but is seen by another student, Ruth.\n\nCharlotte is not the only one who struggles with identity. Emily tells of the wretchedness of being motherless and unwanted, moving around between homes while her father fights in the war. Meanwhile, Charlotte dreams she is fighting to stay as Charlotte. She dreams about Arthur.\n\nA letter arrives for Clare and Emily from their father. Emily does not let Charlotte read it, to the bewilderment of the other girls. Charlotte, thoughtful as always, wonders who Sarah's mother is: perhaps it will be Charlotte herself if she is trapped in 1918?\n\nAt night, Charlotte dreams about Arthur again, as a drummer boy, and that she has turned into Agnes. Her crisis of identity comes to a head as she struggles to preserve her identity as Charlotte.\n\nOne evening, the Chisel Browns hold a [[seance]] in an attempt to speak to Arthur. The girls hide behind the curtains to observe. During the seance, they hear Clare's voice crying out for Emily. Emily cries out, and the two girls are discovered and disciplined. Later, Miss Agnes asks about the voice they heard at the seance \u2013 Clare's. She then tells Charlotte and Emily of Arthur's war experiences.\n\nFinally, the [[Armistice]] comes. The war is over: people dance and celebrate in the street, and Charlotte and Emily join in, even though it would anger Mr Chisel Brown. In disgrace, Charlotte and Emily are sent back to the school. Miss Agnes gives them the toys as a gift.\n\n===Part three===\nRuth recalls her \"dream\" of seeing Clare whilst in the sick room. Because of the [[Spanish flu|flu epidemic]], the students are able to play wild games in the dormitories, and eventually Charlotte is able to sleep in the bed that will return her to her own time.\n\nOn arriving back, Charlotte is startled to learn that her room-mate Elizabeth had deduced the truth about her swap with Clare. Charlotte wonders about Sarah's mother and what has become of Emily and Clare. At the school, Charlotte sees the elderly Miss Wilkin. Charlotte realises that she had known Miss Wilkin when she was a young teacher in 1918.\n\nOne day, Charlotte learns what has become of Emily and Clare through a conversation with Sarah. Sarah's mother is Emily, and Clare died in the flu epidemic after the war. Later, Charlotte and Elizabeth discuss the events Charlotte has experienced. They find the exercise book in the bed leg, where it has been for forty years. It includes the last letter Charlotte wrote to Clare.\n\nCharlotte receives a package from Emily as an adult. It contains a letter from Emily, and the toys which Miss Agnes had given them over forty years ago. Charlotte places the marbles from the solitaire set in a jar and fills it with water, which the other girls admire.  Charlotte feels a sense of personal identity in now having her own decoration to her dresser, yet muses that the marbles belonged her when she was living the life of another person, namely Clare. The end of term comes, and the boarders leave the school in the school bus, singing rhymes. <ref>Penelope Farmer ''Charlotte Sometimes'', Harcourt, 1969. (This last episode is not in the 1985 revised edition</ref>\n\n==Continuity==\n''Charlotte Sometimes'' begins one year after the ending of ''The Summer Birds'', after Charlotte has left her small village school, and covers the period of her first term at boarding school. While written three years after ''Emma in Winter'' \u2014 set during Charlotte's second term at boarding school \u2014 the events of ''Charlotte Sometimes'' occur beforehand. Charlotte's sister Emma and their grandfather Elijah do not appear in ''Charlotte Sometimes'', although there are references to them. For example, Charlotte compares Emily with her sister Emma in her own time, and compares the Chisel Brown family home with her own home, Aviary Hall.\n\n''Emma in Winter'' begins during the same Christmas holidays where ''Charlotte Sometimes'' ends, and indicates that Charlotte will stay a week with one of the friends she made at boarding school during the events of ''Charlotte Sometimes''.<ref>Penelope Farmer, ''Emma in Winter''. London: [[Chatto & Windus]], 1969, p. 6.</ref> ''Emma in Winter'' then follows Emma's story while Charlotte returns to boarding school.\n\n==Themes==\n===Identity===\nWhile writing ''Emma in Winter'', Farmer was not aware that identity was such a dominant theme in the book. She only realised this later, when she read [[Margery Fisher]]'s comments on the book in ''Growing Point''. She had a similar realisation, this time on her own, while writing ''Charlotte Sometimes''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Writers, Critics, and Children |url=https://archive.org/details/writerscriticsch00foxg |url-access=registration |editor= Geoff Fox |editor2= Graham Hammond |editor3=Terry Jones |editor4=Frederic Smith |editor5= Kenneth Sterck |year=1976 |publisher=Agathon Press |location=New York |isbn=0-87586-054-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/writerscriticsch00foxg/page/60 60]}}</ref> She writes that \"halfway through ''Charlotte Sometimes'' I realized that I was writing a book about identity. I am a twin, a nonidentical one, and apparently one of the chief problems of nonidentical twins is always the establishment of a genuine and separate sense of identity. Looking back I can see this has in fact been an obsession with me, since the age of twelve or so at least.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Penelope (Jane) Farmer 1939- |journal=Children's Literature Review |date=1985 |volume=8 |page=65}}</ref>\n\nAuthor [[David Rees (author)|David Rees]] also points out that identity as a major theme. He wrote, \"Its most memorable passages are poignant or resigned or concerned with absence, loss, or death.... Its theme is not so much maturing relationships, but identity....  Charlotte begins to wonder, with increasing dismay, if she really is Charlotte: perhaps she has turned into Clare, rather than just substituted for her. This may be an adult fear \u2013 the fear of not being everything you and other people have always said you are, the realization that you may be someone totally different.\"<ref name=\"Rees\">David Rees, \"The Marble in the Water: Penelope Farmer\". In ''The Marble in the Water: Essays on Contemporary Writers of Fiction for Children and Young Adults'', The Horn Book, Inc., 1980, pp. 1\u201313. Quoted in ''Children's Literature Review'', Vol. 8. Gale Research Company, 1985.</ref>\n\n===Time Travel===\n''Charlotte Sometimes'' continues the theme, begun in ''Emma in Winter'', of time travel into the past. While this is unexplained in ''Charlotte Sometimes'', a theorised explanation appears in ''Emma in Winter''. Emma and Bobby are reading journals in Emma and Charlotte's grandfather Elijah's study, where they find an article theorising about the non-linear nature of time. It describes time as being like a coiled spring, which can be pushed together, so that some moments in time can be very near a moment in another time.<ref>Penelope Farmer, ''Emma in Winter''. London: Chatto & Windus, 1969, Chapter 4.</ref>\n\n==Reviews==\n''Charlotte Sometimes'' received widespread critical acclaim.\n\n[[Margery Fisher]], in a 1969 review for her children's literature journal ''Growing Point'', wrote, \"Like ''Emma in Winter'', this is really a study in disintegration, the study of a girl finding an identity by losing it.... Above all, here is a dream-allegory which teaches not through statement but through feeling. We sense the meaning of Charlotte's changes of identity in the way that she senses them herself.... [It is] a book of quite exceptional distinction... a haunting, convincing story which comes close to being a masterpiece of its kind....\"<ref>Margery Fisher, review of ''Charlotte Sometimes'', ''Growing Point'', November 1969, p. 1408, cited in ''Something About the Author'' 105 (1999) p. 68.</ref>\n\nChildren's novelist [[Eleanor Cameron]] wrote, \"Farmer writes with style. She is vivid in her depiction of place: on almost every page, scattered with colorful figures of speech, we are drawn into the school and the surroundings of the school through sights and sounds and smells and textures... above all we are moved by the depth and poignancy of the relationship between Charlotte and Emily.\" She continues, \"Farmer is always gifted in her grasp of possibilities that bring us up short with surprise and delight and satisfaction.\"<ref name=\"Dell\">Penelope Farmer''Charlotte Sometimes''. Revised edition, Dell, 1985, rear cover.</ref>\n\nNeil Millar in the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' wrote, \"''Charlotte Sometimes'' is a book of quite exceptional distinction.... The book is essentially about humanity caught up in the still trickery of time.... Not easily forgotten.\"<ref>Neil Millar, \"Tales from School\", in ''The Christian Science Monitor'', 6 November 1969. p. B5.  Quoted in ''Children's Literature Review'' Vol. 8. Gale Research Company, 1985.</ref>\n\nIn 1969, ''The Sunday Times'' described the book as \"this year's most haunting fantasy\".<ref name=\"Dell\" />\n\nChildren's publisher [[Margaret K. McElderry]] wrote, \"[''Charlotte Sometimes''] is a fascinating exploration of the fragile barriers between layers of time, handled with great skill in the writing and delicacy of perception.<ref>Margaret K. McElderry, \"Penelope Farmer: The Development of an Author\". In ''Elementary English'' Vol. 51, No. 6, September 1974, p. 802-803. Quoted in ''Children's Literature Review'' Vol. 8. Gale Research Company, 1985.</ref>\n\nThe British children's author [[David Rees (author)|David Rees]] wrote in 1980 of how \"the book is none the worse for breaking the conventional bounds of the children's novel. It is probably Penelope Farmer's finest novel \u2013 complex, taut, not a word wrong \u2013 and it thoroughly deserves the popularity it has attained.\"<ref name=\"Rees\" />\n\nPeggy Heeks writes in ''Twentieth-Century Children's Writers'' that ''Charlotte Sometimes'' \"shows a brilliant handling of the time-switch technique and a sincerity which rejects slick solutions to the dilemmas of the two heroines.\"<ref>Peggy Heeks, entry in ''Twentieth-Century Children's Writers'', ed.
