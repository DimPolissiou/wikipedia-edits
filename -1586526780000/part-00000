He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League Days===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

His debut season in the code continued to be an impressive one. In a match for Tauranga against Te Puke in the Kusab Cup he ran in 3 tries in a 9-6 win\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Keen Football Contest in Te Puke on Saturday for the Kusab Cup\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7474, 16 August 1920, Page 2\n| date = 1920-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200816.2.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee.

Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]]. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kangaroos 29 Bay of Plenty 5\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8101\n| date = 1922-09-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220928.2.33\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League Days===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move. Newton went on to win the Roope Rooster for the first time in their clubs history<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Roope Rooster Competition/Final Won by Newton/Game Played in Downpour\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>. \n\nIles was picked to play for Auckland against New Zealand on May 24. It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

His debut season in the code continued to be an impressive one. In a match for Tauranga against Te Puke in the Kusab Cup he ran in 3 tries in a 9-6 win\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Keen Football Contest in Te Puke on Saturday for the Kusab Cup\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7474, 16 August 1920, Page 2\n| date = 1920-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200816.2.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]]. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kangaroos 29 Bay of Plenty 5\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8101\n| date = 1922-09-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220928.2.33\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

This was a major engagement of the [[American Civil War]], and between December 31 and January 2, 1863, the rival armies suffered a combined total of 23,515 casualties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/battles/tn010.htm |title=Battle Summary: Stones River |publisher=US National Park Service |accessdate=December 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821061749/http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/battles/tn010.htm |archive-date=August 21, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was the bloodiest battle of the war by percentage of casualties.\n\nFollowing the Confederate retreat after the drawn [[Battle of Perryville]] in central Kentucky, the Confederate army moved through East Tennessee and then turned northwest to defend Murfreesboro. General [[Braxton Bragg]]'s veteran cavalry successfully harassed Union General [[William Rosecrans]]{{'}} troop movements, capturing and destroying many of his supply trains. However, they could not completely prevent supplies and reinforcements from reaching Rosecrans. Despite the large number of casualties, the battle was inconclusive. Nevertheless, it is usually considered a Union victory, since afterwards General Bragg retreated {{convert|36|mi}} south to [[Tullahoma, Tennessee|Tullahoma]]. Even so, the Union army did not [[Tullahoma Campaign|move against Bragg]] until a full six months later in June 1863. The battle was significant since it did provide the Union army with a base to push the eventual drive further south, which allowed the later advances against [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chattanooga]] and [[Battle of Atlanta|Atlanta]]. These eventually allowed the Union to divide the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern]] and [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western]] theaters, followed by [[Sherman's March to the Sea]]. The [[Stones River National Battlefield]] is now a national historical site.\n\nGeneral Rosecrans' move to the south depended on a secure source of provisions, and Murfreesboro was chosen to become his supply depot. Soon after the battle, Brigadier General [[James St. Clair Morton]], Chief Engineer of the Army of the Cumberland, was ordered to build [[Old Fort Park and Golf Course|Fortress Rosecrans]], some {{convert|2|mi}} northwest of the town. The fortifications covered about {{convert|225|acre|km2}} and were the largest built during the war. Fortress Rosecrans consisted of eight [[Lunette (fortification)|lunettes]], four [[redoubt]]s and connecting fortifications. The [[Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad]] and the West Fork of the [[Stones River]] both passed through the fortress, while two roads provided additional transportation.\n\nThe fort's interior was a huge logistical resource center, including sawmills, warehouses, quartermaster maintenance depots, ammunition magazines, and living quarters for the 2,000 men who handled the operations and defended the post. The fortress was completed in June 1863, and only then did Rosecrans dare to move south.<ref name=\"urlTN Encyclopedia: FORTRESS ROSECRANS\">{{cite web |url=http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=F054 |title=TN Encyclopedia: FORTRESS ROSECRANS |format= |work= |accessdate=November 19, 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The fortress was never attacked, in part because the Union troops held the town of Murfreesboro hostage by training their artillery on the courthouse. Major portions of the earthworks still exist and have been incorporated into the battlefield site.\n\n===Post-Civil War===\nMurfreesboro had begun as a mainly agricultural community, but by 1853 the area was home to several colleges and academies, gaining the nickname the \"Athens of Tennessee\". Despite the wartime trauma, the town's growth had begun to recover by the early 1900s, in contrast to other areas of the devastated South.\n\nIn 1911, the state legislature created Middle Tennessee State Normal School, a two-year institute to train teachers. It would soon merge with the Tennessee College for Women. In 1925 the Normal School was expanded to a four-year college. In 1965 it became [[Middle Tennessee State University]].<ref name=\"urlFacts-MTSU\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtsu.edu/about_facts.shtml |title=Facts |publisher=Middle Tennessee State University |accessdate=November 19, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119053321/http://mtsu.edu/about_facts.shtml |archivedate=November 19, 2010}}</ref> MTSU now has the largest undergraduate enrollment in the state, including many international students.\n\n[[World War II]] resulted in Murfreesboro diversifying into industry, manufacturing, and education.

This was a major engagement of the [[American Civil War]], and between December 31 and January 2, 1863, the rival armies suffered a combined total of 23,515 casualties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/battles/tn010.htm |title=Battle Summary: Stones River |publisher=US National Park Service |accessdate=December 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821061749/http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/battles/tn010.htm |archive-date=August 21, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was the bloodiest battle of the war by percentage of casualties.\n\nFollowing the Confederate retreat after the drawn [[Battle of Perryville]] in central Kentucky, the Confederate army moved through East Tennessee and then turned northwest to defend Murfreesboro. General [[Braxton Bragg]]'s veteran cavalry successfully harassed Union General [[William Rosecrans]]{{'}} troop movements, capturing and destroying many of his supply trains. However, they could not completely prevent supplies and reinforcements from reaching Rosecrans. Despite the large number of casualties, the battle was inconclusive. Nevertheless, it is usually considered a Union victory, since afterwards General Bragg retreated {{convert|36|mi}} south to [[Tullahoma, Tennessee|Tullahoma]]. Even so, the Union army did not [[Tullahoma Campaign|move against Bragg]] until a full six months later in June 1863. The battle was significant since it did provide the Union army with a base to push the eventual drive further south, which allowed the later advances against [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chattanooga]] and [[Battle of Atlanta|Atlanta]]. These eventually allowed the Union to divide the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern]] and [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western]] theaters, followed by [[Sherman's March to the Sea]]. The [[Stones River National Battlefield]] is now a national historical site.\n\nGeneral Rosecrans' move to the south depended on a secure source of provisions, and Murfreesboro was chosen to become his supply depot. Soon after the battle, Brigadier General [[James St. Clair Morton]], Chief Engineer of the Army of the Cumberland, was ordered to build [[Old Fort Park and Golf Course|Fortress Rosecrans]], some {{convert|2|mi}} northwest of the town. The fortifications covered about {{convert|225|acre|km2}} and were the largest built during the war. Fortress Rosecrans consisted of eight [[Lunette (fortification)|lunettes]], four [[redoubt]]s and connecting fortifications. The [[Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad]] and the West Fork of the [[Stones River]] both passed through the fortress, while two roads provided additional transportation.\n\nThe fort's interior was a huge logistical resource center, including sawmills, warehouses, quartermaster maintenance depots, ammunition magazines, and living quarters for the 2,000 men who handled the operations and defended the post. The fortress was completed in June 1863, and only then did Rosecrans dare to move south.<ref name=\"urlTN Encyclopedia: FORTRESS ROSECRANS\">{{cite web |url=http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=F054 |title=TN Encyclopedia: FORTRESS ROSECRANS |format= |work= |accessdate=November 19, 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The fortress was never attacked, in part because the Union troops held the town of Murfreesboro hostage by training their artillery on the courthouse. Major portions of the earthworks still exist and have been incorporated into the battlefield site.\n\n===Post-Civil War===\nMurfreesboro had begun as a mainly agricultural community, but by 1853 the area was home to several colleges and academies, gaining the nickname the \"Athens of Tennessee\". Despite the wartime trauma, the town's growth had begun to recover by the early 1900s, in contrast to other areas of the devastated South.\n\nIn 1911, the state legislature created Middle Tennessee State Normal School, a two-year institute to train teachers. It would soon merge with the Tennessee College for Women. In 1925 the Normal School was expanded to a four-year college. In 1965 it became [[Middle Tennessee State University]].<ref name=\"urlFacts-MTSU\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtsu.edu/about_facts.shtml |title=Facts |publisher=Middle Tennessee State University |accessdate=November 19, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119053321/http://mtsu.edu/about_facts.shtml |archivedate=November 19, 2010}}</ref> MTSU now has the largest undergraduate enrollment in the state, including many international students.\n\n[[World War II]] resulted in Murfreesboro diversifying into industry, manufacturing, and education.

It is the flagship property of [[TV5 Network|TV5 Network, Inc.]], which is owned by [[MediaQuest Holdings]], the multimedia arm of [[Philippines|Philippine-based]] telecommunications company [[PLDT]]. \n5 is also formally referred to as \"The ''Kapatid'' Network\", the [[Filipino language|Tagalog]] term for \"sibling\", which was introduced in 2010.\n\nNamed after its flagship station in [[Metro Manila]], [[DWET-TV]], which are carried in VHF Channel 5 (analog broadcast) and UHF Channel 51 (digital test broadcast; though the latter is licensed to TV5's sister company [[Cignal TV|Mediascape/Cignal TV]])  with channel 18 served as a permanent assigned digital frequency. 5 is also broadcasting to 7 other owned-and-operated stations, and 19 affiliated television stations nationwide. Its programming is also available outside the Philippines through [[Kapatid Channel]] and [[AksyonTV|AksyonTV International]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|TV5 Network}}\n\n===The early years (1960\u20131972)===\n[[Chino Roces|Joaquin \"Chino\" Roces]], owner of the [[Manila Times]] was granted of a radio-TV franchise from [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] under [[Republic Act]] 2945 on 19 June 1960.<ref name=\"ra2945\" /> He then founded the Associated Broadcasting Corporation with its first studios along Pasong Tamo, becoming the fourth television network established in the country. ABC operated radio and television services from 1960 until 23 September 1972 when [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]] declared [[Ferdinand E. Marcos#Martial law and the New Society|Martial Law]]. Both ABC and the [[Manila Times]] were forcibly shut down as a result with rivals [[ABS-CBN]], [[GMA Network|RBS]], and [[Manila Broadcasting Company|MBC]]'s radio and television broadcasts also shut down by martial law that day.\n\nAfter the [[People Power Revolution]] in 1986, Chino Roces made a successful representation with [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon Cojuangco-Aquino]] for the network's reinstatement. ABC's rival [[ABS-CBN]] reopened that year but ABC was not yet reopened until it made a test broadcast in 1991 and finally reopened in 1992. Chino Roces died in 1988, but his son Edgardo Roces would reopen the network after.\n\nNew stockholders led by broadcast veteran Edward Tan and Chino Roces's son Edgardo then began the arduous task of resuming broadcasts. The [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]] granted their application for an increase in capitalization and amendments to ABC's articles of incorporation and by-laws. They were subsequently granted a permit to operate by the [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|National Telecommunications Commission (NTC)]].\n\n===The return and growth (1992\u20132003)===\nABC inaugurated its studio complex and transmitter tower in San Bartolome, [[Novaliches]], [[Quezon City]] in 1990 and began test broadcasts by the end of 1991; officially and finally returning to the air as the Associated Broadcasting Company on 21 February 1992 with the different callsign of the flagship station, DWET-TV and the corporate name, Associated Broadcasting Company, which the Company uses C as the corporate initial instead of keeping Corporation, the name of the original ABC, along its original callsign, DZTM-TV, during the pre-martial law years as a result of the new management of the now revived network which took over its operations.\n\nABC acquired a new 25-year franchise to operate on 9 December 1994 under [[Republic Act]] 7831 (will expire on 9 December 2019) signed by President [[Fidel V. Ramos|Fidel Valdez Ramos]]. In the same year, it went on nationwide satellite broadcasting. In a surge of phenomenal growth, ABC earned its reputation as \"The Fastest Growing Network\" under new network executive [[Tina Monzon-Palma]] who served as Chief Operating Officer.\n\nIn 2001, ABC began to produce local versions of ''[[The Price Is Right]]'' (hosted by [[Dawn Zulueta]] and later acquired by [[ABS-CBN]]); ''[[Wheel of Fortune (game show) in different countries|Wheel of Fortune]]'' (hosted by [[Rustom Padilla]], later acquired by [[ABS-CBN]]); and ''[[Family Feud]]'' (hosted by [[Ogie Alcasid]], later acquired by [[GMA Network]] and then by [[ABS-CBN]]). This was during the height of the game show frenzy within Philippine networks brought on by the success of [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC]]'s Philippine editions of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' (hosted by [[Christopher de Leon]], which is later transferred to TV5 hosted by [[Vic Sotto]]) and ''[[The Weakest Link]]'' (hosted by [[Edu Manzano]]).\n\n===The Cojuangco era (2003\u20132008)===\nIn October 2003, ABC was acquired by a group led by businessman Antonio \"Tonyboy\" O. Cojuangco, Jr. former Chairman of the [[PLDT|Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company]] (PLDT) and owner of [[Dream Satellite TV|Dream Satellite Broadcasting]] and Bank of Commerce, among other assets. Cojuangco was the chairman and CEO of ABC at the time. The new management introduced many changes including a stronger news and public affairs division, modernization of its broadcast equipment, and the acquisition of broadcast rights of [[Philippine Basketball Association]] games. Additionally, the network also launched a new advertising campaign and slogan, \"Iba Tayo!\" (\"We're Different!\"), which emphasized the new lineup as being more distinct and new than what was being aired by its competitors at the time, targeting the burgeoning middle- to upper-class youth market.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jazmines|first1=Tessa|title=DTH station buys terrestrial TV channel|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/markets-festivals/dth-station-buys-terrestrial-tv-channel-1117896313/|accessdate=11 January 2019|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|date=30 November 2003}}</ref> ABC continued to support [[Family Rosary Crusade (TV program)|Family Rosary Crusade]], and its religious pre-identification campaign \"Please Pray the Rosary\" was played before every program on the network until the plug gradually phased out due to the network's programming revamp.\n\nIn 2005, ABC won the \"Outstanding TV Station\" award at the 2005 [[Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas|KBP Golden Dove Awards]], with several other programs on the network also earning awards in their respective categories.\n\nIn early 2007, ABC implemented a series of [[budget cut]]s, primarily directed towards its news department, which laid off most of its employees. The cuts, held prior to the [[2007 Philippine general election|2007 general elections]], left ABC almost incapable of coverage.\n\nIn November 2007, ABC debuted an array of new sports programming, including [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] basketball, pro boxing, and [[WWE]] events, as part of a new five-year deal with [[Solar Entertainment Corporation|Solar Entertainment]]. However, due to their high costs and poor ratings, these programs were later dropped throughout 2008, and its NBA review show \"House of Hoops\" was cut back as well and eventually cancelled by April 2008. However, much of these programs, along with the PBA (as ABC elected not to renew its contract through the ended after the [[2008 PBA Fiesta Conference|2008 Fiesta Conference]]), would be picked up by [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]], who had begun a much wider partnership with Solar earlier in 2007, which led to its privatization by the latter in 2011.\n\n===TV5 era (2008\u20132018)===\n\n==== ABC-MPB Primedia Partnership (2008\u20132010) ====\nIn March 2008, Cojuangco announced that ABC had reached a partnership with MPB Primedia Inc., a local company backed by [[Media Prima|Media Prima Berhad]] of [[Malaysia]] as part of a long-term strategy to make the network more competitive. MPB Primedia, meanwhile, was formed to serve as seed asset for Media Prima's proposed private equity fund to invest in various media companies within Southeast Asia.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2009/10/14/media-prima-set-to-exit-philippine-tv/ Media Prima set to exit Philippine TV] Accessed 8 October 2018</ref> Cojuangco said MPB Primedia Inc., in principle, would produce and source most of the entertainment programs while ABC would continue to be responsible for news programming and operation of the stations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.com.ph/features/features032808_aoc.html|title=ABC Signs Content Partnership with Malaysia-Backed Group|publisher=ABC.com.ph|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727012656/http://abc.com.ph/features/features032808_aoc.html|archivedate=27 July 2008}}</ref> MPB Primedia was also given exclusive right to schedule and manage sale of ABC-5's airtime.

This forced the network to implement a series of retrenchment of its employees. The biggest retrenchment happened in September 2015, when TV5's entertainment division got on the verge of dissolution and its employees were laid off, including [[Wilma Galvante]], its Chief Entertainment Content Officer. From 4,000 employees in mid-2013, the series of retrenchment resizes TV5 to merely around 700 employees by the end of 2017.\n\nIncapable of producing original content, TV5 appointed [[Viva Entertainment]] CEO, Vicente \"Vic\" Del Rosario as the network's new Chief Entertainment Strategist, implementing changes on TV5's entertainment programming. These included a formation of the Viva-TV5 joint venture [[Sari-Sari Channel]] and outsourcing [[Viva Entertainment|Viva Television]] for its entertainment shows, including [[Ang Panday (2016 TV series)|a revival of ''Ang Panday'']], the return of [[Diether Ocampo]] and [[Claudine Barretto]]'s tandem in ''[[Bakit Manipis ang Ulap?]]'' and shows from by-then sister station [[MTV Pinoy]] such as ''Top 20 Pilipinas''. New shows started to air between November 2015 and February 2016 but were cancelled a few months later due to lack of advertisement support and poor ratings.\n\nSince January 2016, TV5 and [[Cignal]] via [[Hyper (TV channel)|Hyper]] will be the official Free TV and Pay TV partner, respectively, of the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] in the Philippines.\n\nBy July 2016, TV5 began airing selected programs from [[MTV]] and [[MTV International]] like ''[[Catfish]]'', ''[[Ridiculousness (TV series)|Ridiculousness]]'' and ''[[Ex on the Beach]]'' after inking a deal with [[Viacom International Media Networks]] that month to create the new MTV on TV5 block.\n\nOn 8 September 2016, TV5 cancelled its locally produced programs ''[[Aksyon Bisaya]]'' (Cebu) and ''[[Aksyon Dabaw]]'' (Davao) due to cost-cutting measures.

The partnership formed the '''ESPN5''' brand, that is airing on TV5 and [[AksyonTV]].<ref>{{cite news|title=TV5 and ESPN collaborate to launch ESPN 5|url=http://sports.tv5.com.ph/sports5/article/tv5-and-espn-collaborate-to-launch-espn-5|work=Sports5|publisher=[[TV5 Network|TV5 Network, Inc.]]|date=11 October 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012201619/http://sports.tv5.com.ph/sports5/article/tv5-and-espn-collaborate-to-launch-espn-5|archivedate=12 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Interaksyon|title=ESPN-5 IS HERE &#124; TV5 announces partnership with \u2018Worldwide Leader in Sports\u2019|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/sports/2017/10/12/102970/espn-5-is-here-tv5-announces-partnership-with-worldwide-leader-in-sports/|accessdate=11 January 2019|work=Interaksyon|publisher=Philstar Global Corporation|date=12 October 2017}}</ref> The said deal comes in response to the network's formal, albeit temporary shift from a general entertainment station to a sports and news channel.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mercurio|first1=Richmond|title=TV5 narrows losses in 2018|url=https://www.philstar.com/business/2019/01/11/1883955/tv5-narrows-losses-2018|accessdate=11 January 2019|work=[[The Philippine Star|Philstar.com]]|publisher=Philstar Global Corp.|date=11 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== The 5 Network era (2018\u20132020) ===\nOn 17 February 2018, in line with the recent changes within the network and in celebration of its 10th anniversary, TV5 was relaunched as The 5 Network or simply '''5''' with a new logo and station ID entitled ''Get It on 5'', whereas the TV on the top right quadrant of the logo has been dropped, making it more flexible for the other divisions to use it as part of their own identity. Aside from rebranding, TV5's programming grid has also divided into three blocks: ESPN5 (Sports), News 5, and On 5 (Entertainment, Anime, Cartoons, Informative and Home TV Shopping), along with D5 Studio (Digital Content) and Studio 5 (World-class Filipino productions for audiences across all platforms). Along with the rebrand, the ''Kapatid'' moniker was also deemphasized and is now only used by News5 and ESPN5 for some of its programs. But the more visible change was the slow quiet phraseout of Filipino-dubbed movies and foreign-acquired programming, a feature that dated back from its MPB Primedia era in 2008. Today, even more of its ''Disney Club on 5'' programs and more of its movies are now aired in the English language.\n\nOn 13 January 2019, coinciding with the reformat of [[AksyonTV]] to [[5 Plus]], 5 introduced a variation of its 2018 logo. It has also since included the websites of the division producing the program airing (e.g. TV5.com.ph for entertainment and blocktimers) as part of their on-screen graphics.\n\nOn 3 June 2019, [[Chot Reyes]] retired as TV5 President and CEO, which was immediately replaced by Jane Basas, which leads pay-TV provider and radio company [[Cignal TV|Cignal TV/Mediascape]]. Since her appointment, 5 has begun to outsource news and sports programming from its co-owned Cignal channels [[One News (Philippines)|One News]], [[One PH]], [[One Sports (Philippines)|One Sports]], and [[PBA Rush]]; it has also phased out its daytime [[ESPN5]] programs and relegated it to sister free-TV station [[5 Plus]] in favor of archived entertainment programs and expanded movie blocks. Jane Basas later revealed future plans for the network; which includes retaining its existing news programs and sports content in primetime, and reintroducing original entertainment programming through outsourcing from [[Cignal TV#Cignal Entertainment|Cignal Entertainment]] and other major blocktimers. The network also saw the return of former TV5 executive Perci Intalan as the station's head of programming in November.\n\nTV5 Network got its  25-year franchise extension under [[Republic Act]] 11320 but lapsed-into-law on 22 April 2019 without President [[Rodrigo Duterte|Rodrigo Roa Duterte]]'s signature coincided with the 25-year franchise extension of [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines|CBCP]] under [[Republic Act]] 11319 also lapsed-into-law on that same day  without Chief Executive's signature.\n\nOn 4 February 2020, Robert P. Galang has been appointed as the new President and CEO of TV5 Network and [[Cignal TV]], replacing Basas who has been appointed as the new Chief Marketing Officer of [[Smart Communications]].\n\nOn 8 March 2020, 5's sister channel [[5 Plus]] was relaunched as [[One Sports (TV channel)|One Sports]] (moving from being a Cignal-exclusive pay television channel), with the ESPN5 division also being renamed and merged to the abovementioned brand. As a result, all sports programming on 5 no longer bears the ''ESPN5'' banner. Despite the change, the ESPN5 partnership continues online, with ESPN5.com serving as the de-facto sports portal of One Sports in the Philippines. On the same day, TV5 Network announced that 5 would be rebranded as '''One TV''' (adopting from Cignal TV's \"One\"-branded channels), which was originally scheduled on 13 April 2020. However, due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the Philippines|coronavirus pandemic]] and the Luzon-wide community quarantine was extended until 30 April 2020, the rebranding will take effect once the community quarantine ends on May 2020.\n\n==Branding of 5==\n===Network identity===\nOn 19 June 1960, newspaper publisher [[Chino Roces|Joaquin \"Chino\" Roces]] launched its television station in the Philippines, then known as the Associated Broadcasting Corporation.<ref name=\"ra2945\" /> Since then, the network evolved and used different brandings until it became widely known from what it is today.\n\n:*'''Associated Broadcasting Corporation''' (1960\u20131972) \u2014 founded by [[Chino Roces|Joaquin \"Chino\" Roces]] until it was forced to shut down in 1972 following the declaration of the [[Ferdinand E. Marcos#Martial law and the New Society|Martial Law]] by President Marcos.\n:*'''Associated Broadcasting Company''' (1992\u20132008) \u2014 fully restored after being granted a new franchise led by its new stockholders Edward Tan and Roces' son, Edgardo Roces. It was acquired by businessman Antonio O. Cojuangco Jr. in 2003.\n:*'''TV5''' (2008\u20132018) \u2014 renamed as TV5 after ABC entered a partnership with MPB Primedia, Inc. backed by the Malaysian media group [[Media Prima|Media Prima Berhad]]. In 2010, [[Media Prima]] divested its share with [[MediaQuest Holdings|MediaQuest Holdings, Inc.]] to business tycoon [[Manuel V. Pangilinan]]. Upon relaunch as ''5'', the TV5 branding became obsolete, only to be used during station sign-on and sign-off messages, social media accounts, and selected program teasers.\n:*'''5 (The 5 Network)''' (2018\u20132020) \u2014 TV5 was relaunched as The 5 Network or simply ''5'' on 17 February 2018. The station launched its numerical 5 logo, making it more flexible for the other divisions to use it as part of their own identity, as its programming grid is divided into news, sports, and entertainment. Although, '''TV5''' was still used to refer to both the channel and the company itself.\n:*'''One TV''' (April 13, 2020-presents) - 5 will be relaunched as One TV starting on the May 2020. This will make them the 6th TV station under PLDT-Smart's MediaQuest to take the \"One\" branding.\n\n===Logos===\nTV5 used several logos since it was established in 1960. In 1960, the network used a 5 Logo derived from its flagship station in [[Metro Manila]], [[DWET-TV|DZTM-TV]] carried in VHF channel 5 until it was shut down in 1972. When it returned to the airwaves, the network used a more-known ABC 5 logo with an iconic cyclone icon, incorporating the colors [[red]], [[blue]] and [[green]]\u2014colors making up a [[pixel]] shown on the [[television]] technology of 1992. The number 5 was removed to the logo in 1995 but retaining its ABC and the cyclone icon. In 2001, the logo added its slogan Come home to ABC, the same logo used in April 2004 with its new slogan Iba Tayo. The last logo as ABC in September 2004 has been enclosed with a yellow circle. The logo changed after its re-launch in 2008 having the new name of the network TV5 inside a shaking television. In 2010, the network used a red circle being shined in the northwest corner carrying the name TV5 with the letters TV in the northeastern part above the largely sized number 5. The logo adopted a 3D version in 2013 and applying it on-air, although the 2010 2D version oftentimes appear.\n\nIn 2018, TV5 adopted its numerical 5 logo, which was first appeared on [[ESPN5]] logo, which was launched on October 2017, dropping the \"TV\" word on the northeastern quadrant as part of their ''Get It on 5'' campaign. They also started to display the name of the current program using the format: \"(title) ''on 5''\" as the part of the logo (usually applied to entertainment and other programs not provided by either News5 or ESPN5; except blocktimers, where only the 5 logo is displayed) resulting to viewers mistakenly thought \"on\" was part of the title. The numerical five logo was also simultaneously adopted for TV5 sister divisions [[News5]], [[DWFM|Radyo 5]], and [[Digital5|D5 Studio]].\n\nA variation of the current numerical 5 logo was unveiled on 13 January 2019, similar to the newly launched network, [[5 Plus]].\n\n==Programming==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by 5 (TV channel)}}\n5's program lineup includes news and current affairs programs, dubbed cartoons, movies, American drama, sports, informative, talk shows, infomercials and Japanese anime shows.\n\nOn its second month since its re-launch last 9 August 2008, TV5 has been reportedly on Top 3 based on the [[AGB Nielsen Philippines|AGB Nielsen]] survey. It also gained its rating on their ''Nick on TV5'' morning cartoon block, and its popularity because of their former AniMEGA primetime anime block.\n\nIn 2013, the network's ratings improved as they launched the Weekend Do It Better and Everyday All The Way programming blocks under the helm of the former Chief Entertainment Content Officer, [[Wilma Galvante]] (2012\u20132015), however some of the programs under the block were discontinued, particularly due to low ratings.\n\nIn 2014, the network launched another set of new programs under the \"Happy Ka Dito!\" campaign.\n\nIn 2015, TV5 launched more than a dozen programs that are more focused to light entertainment and sports programming under its \"Happy sa 2015\" campaign. Also the said year, viewers sought the return of AniMEGA.\n\nMonths later, TV5's entertainment programming were produced by different content providers, including Unitel Productions (TV5's sister company), The IdeaFirst Company (formed by former TV5 Entertainment Head Perci Intalan) and Content Cows Company Inc. (formed by Galvante). By 14 October 2015, TV5 Network named [[Sari-Sari Channel|Sari-Sari Network]] as the main production outfit of TV5. They also appointed SSN Co-CEO and [[Viva Entertainment|Viva]] executive, Vicente \"Vic\" Del Rosario as the new Chief Entertainment Strategist of the network. He will handle all of the entertainment programs broadcast by the network. It happened a month after TV5, Cignal and Viva inked a deal to create [[Sari-Sari Channel|Sari-Sari Network]] (SSN). New shows for 2016 were also launched by TV5 together with [[Viva Entertainment]] last 25 November 2015. However, all programs produced by Viva were phased out between July and August 2016 due to management disagreements following an attempted partnership of shows.\n\nJust recently, [[Brillante Mendoza]] signed a contract with TV5 last December 2016 to make made-for-TV movies to be aired on the network under the ''Brillante Mendoza Presents'' umbrella. Unfortunately, the actual date of mini-series ''Brillante Mendoza Presents: Amo'', that supposed to premiere on TV5, was cancelled due to unknown reasons.\n\nSince 2017, [[NFL]] games began to broadcast on TV5, replacing the TV5 Kids presents Cartoon Network block (whereas [[Cartoon Network (Asia)|Cartoon Network]] shows were moved to [[GMA Network]] since [[Ben 10 (2016 TV series)|Ben 10]] on 29 March 2018 and [[CNN Philippines]] on 1 September 2018 in original English-language audio.)<ref>{{cite web|date=7 September 2017|author=ralphierce|title=TV5 Pulls Out Cartoon Network Shows, Refurbish Lineup Anew with NFL, Cockfighting, Japan Japan and Amo|publisher=From the Tube|url=https://fromthetube.wordpress.com/2017/09/07/tv5-pulls-out-cartoon-network-shows-refurbish-lineup-anew-with-nfl-cockfighting-japan-japan-and-amo/}}</ref>\n\nThe network also started airing selected shows from the [[Sari-Sari Channel]] under the ''Sari-Sari sa Weekends'' banner.\n\nAfter several months of hiatus, the local drama ''[[Amo (TV series)|Brillante Mendoza Presents: Amo]]'' was premiered on 21 April 2018.\n\nOn 13 January 2019, all foreign entertainment shows broadcast on 5 started to be broadcast in the original English-language audio instead of Filipino dubbed audio (except ''[[Scorpion (TV series)|Scorpion]]'' and Sine Squad on weekends).\n\nIn March 2019, the Sine Squad movie block on weekends are now aired in original English audio (except on weekday afternoons in Filipino dubbed audio starting June 2019).\n\nOn 23 September 2019, upon 5's expansion of its movie blocks, they returned in airing the Filipino language dubbing instead of the original English audio. However, in January of 2020, the primetime movie blocks returned to the original English audio as reruns of 5 programming took the place of the afternoon movies.\n\n==Kapatid Channel==\n{{Main|Kapatid Channel}}\n\nTV5 programs are seen internationally via [[Kapatid Channel]], and is currently available in [[Guam]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], [[Europe]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://philippines.mom-rsf.org/en/media/tv/ Media Ownership Monitor Philippines - Television] by VERA Files and [[Reporters Without Borders]]\n\n{{Commons category|Associated Broadcasting Company}}\n\n{{TV5|state=expanded}}\n{{Television in the Philippines}}\n\n[[Category:1960 establishments in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:The 5 Network| ]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Mandaluyong]]\n[[Category:Digital terrestrial television in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Filipino-language television stations]]\n[[Category:Media companies of the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Philippine television networks]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1960]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 1972]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1992]]\n[[Category:Television in Metro Manila]]\n[[Category:Television in the Philippines]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the Philippine TV channel called TV5|parent company of the same name|TV5 Network|other TV channels called TV5|TV5 (disambiguation){{!}}TV5}}\n{{redirect|ABC 5|other channels|ABC 5 (disambiguation)}}\n{{short description|TV channel in the Philippines}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox broadcasting network\n| network_name   = 5 (The 5 Network)\n| network_logo   = TV5 (ABC5) Logo.svg\n| branding       = The ''Kapatid'' Network <small>(''Kapatid'' is the [[Filipino language|Filipino]] term for \"sibling\")</small>\n| slogan         = \n| country        = [[Philippines]]\n| market_share   = 7.6% <small>([[AGB Nielsen Philippines|Nielsen]] Urban National TAM January\u2013August 2016)</small><ref>{{cite web|title=Media Ownership Monitor Philippines - TV5|url=http://philippines.mom-rsf.org/en/media/detail/outlet/tv5/|publisher=[[Reporters Without Borders]]|accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n| network_type   = [[Terrestrial television|Terrestrial]] [[commercial television|commercial]] [[television network]]\n| available      = National <!-- Kapatid TV is a separate channel and not this one -->\n| founded        = {{start date and age|df=y|1960|6|19}}<ref name=\"ra2945\">{{cite web |title=Republic Act 2945 |url=https://thecorpusjuris.com/legislative/republic-acts/ra-no-2945.php |date=19 June 1960}}</ref>\n| founder        = [[Chino Roces]]\n| tvstations     = [[List of 5 (TV channel) TV and radio stations|List of 5 stations]]\n| language       = [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] (main)<br />[[English language|English]] (secondary)\n| headquarters   = San Bartolome, Novaliches, [[Quezon City]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]] <small>(1992\u20132013)</small><br />[[TV5 Media Center]], Reliance cor.

It is the flagship property of [[TV5 Network|TV5 Network, Inc.]], which is owned by [[MediaQuest Holdings]], the multimedia arm of [[Philippines|Philippine-based]] telecommunications company [[PLDT]]. \n5 is also formally referred to as \"The ''Kapatid'' Network\", the [[Filipino language|Tagalog]] term for \"sibling\", which was introduced in 2010.\n\nNamed after its flagship station in [[Metro Manila]], [[DWET-TV]], which are carried in VHF Channel 5 (analog broadcast) and UHF Channel 51 (digital test broadcast; though the latter is licensed to TV5's sister company [[Cignal TV|Mediascape/Cignal TV]])  with channel 18 served as a permanent assigned digital frequency. 5 is also broadcasting to 7 other owned-and-operated stations, and 19 affiliated television stations nationwide. Its programming is also available outside the Philippines through [[Kapatid Channel]] and [[AksyonTV|AksyonTV International]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|TV5 Network}}\n\n===The early years (1960\u20131972)===\n[[Chino Roces|Joaquin \"Chino\" Roces]], owner of the [[Manila Times]] was granted of a radio-TV franchise from [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] under [[Republic Act]] 2945 on 19 June 1960.<ref name=\"ra2945\" /> He then founded the Associated Broadcasting Corporation with its first studios along Pasong Tamo, becoming the fourth television network established in the country. ABC operated radio and television services from 1960 until 23 September 1972 when [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]] declared [[Ferdinand E. Marcos#Martial law and the New Society|Martial Law]]. Both ABC and the [[Manila Times]] were forcibly shut down as a result with rivals [[ABS-CBN]], [[GMA Network|RBS]], and [[Manila Broadcasting Company|MBC]]'s radio and television broadcasts also shut down by martial law that day.\n\nAfter the [[People Power Revolution]] in 1986, Chino Roces made a successful representation with [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon Cojuangco-Aquino]] for the network's reinstatement. ABC's rival [[ABS-CBN]] reopened that year but ABC was not yet reopened until it made a test broadcast in 1991 and finally reopened in 1992. Chino Roces died in 1988, but his son Edgardo Roces would reopen the network after.\n\nNew stockholders led by broadcast veteran Edward Tan and Chino Roces's son Edgardo then began the arduous task of resuming broadcasts. The [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]] granted their application for an increase in capitalization and amendments to ABC's articles of incorporation and by-laws. They were subsequently granted a permit to operate by the [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|National Telecommunications Commission (NTC)]].\n\n===The return and growth (1992\u20132003)===\nABC inaugurated its studio complex and transmitter tower in San Bartolome, [[Novaliches]], [[Quezon City]] in 1990 and began test broadcasts by the end of 1991; officially and finally returning to the air as the Associated Broadcasting Company on 21 February 1992 with the different callsign of the flagship station, DWET-TV and the corporate name, Associated Broadcasting Company, which the Company uses C as the corporate initial instead of keeping Corporation, the name of the original ABC, along its original callsign, DZTM-TV, during the pre-martial law years as a result of the new management of the now revived network which took over its operations.\n\nABC acquired a new 25-year franchise to operate on 9 December 1994 under [[Republic Act]] 7831 (will expire on 9 December 2019) signed by President [[Fidel V. Ramos|Fidel Valdez Ramos]]. In the same year, it went on nationwide satellite broadcasting. In a surge of phenomenal growth, ABC earned its reputation as \"The Fastest Growing Network\" under new network executive [[Tina Monzon-Palma]] who served as Chief Operating Officer.\n\nIn 2001, ABC began to produce local versions of ''[[The Price Is Right]]'' (hosted by [[Dawn Zulueta]] and later acquired by [[ABS-CBN]]); ''[[Wheel of Fortune (game show) in different countries|Wheel of Fortune]]'' (hosted by [[Rustom Padilla]], later acquired by [[ABS-CBN]]); and ''[[Family Feud]]'' (hosted by [[Ogie Alcasid]], later acquired by [[GMA Network]] and then by [[ABS-CBN]]). This was during the height of the game show frenzy within Philippine networks brought on by the success of [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC]]'s Philippine editions of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' (hosted by [[Christopher de Leon]], which is later transferred to TV5 hosted by [[Vic Sotto]]) and ''[[The Weakest Link]]'' (hosted by [[Edu Manzano]]).\n\n===The Cojuangco era (2003\u20132008)===\nIn October 2003, ABC was acquired by a group led by businessman Antonio \"Tonyboy\" O. Cojuangco, Jr. former Chairman of the [[PLDT|Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company]] (PLDT) and owner of [[Dream Satellite TV|Dream Satellite Broadcasting]] and Bank of Commerce, among other assets. Cojuangco was the chairman and CEO of ABC at the time. The new management introduced many changes including a stronger news and public affairs division, modernization of its broadcast equipment, and the acquisition of broadcast rights of [[Philippine Basketball Association]] games. Additionally, the network also launched a new advertising campaign and slogan, \"Iba Tayo!\" (\"We're Different!\"), which emphasized the new lineup as being more distinct and new than what was being aired by its competitors at the time, targeting the burgeoning middle- to upper-class youth market.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jazmines|first1=Tessa|title=DTH station buys terrestrial TV channel|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/markets-festivals/dth-station-buys-terrestrial-tv-channel-1117896313/|accessdate=11 January 2019|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|date=30 November 2003}}</ref> ABC continued to support [[Family Rosary Crusade (TV program)|Family Rosary Crusade]], and its religious pre-identification campaign \"Please Pray the Rosary\" was played before every program on the network until the plug gradually phased out due to the network's programming revamp.\n\nIn 2005, ABC won the \"Outstanding TV Station\" award at the 2005 [[Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas|KBP Golden Dove Awards]], with several other programs on the network also earning awards in their respective categories.\n\nIn early 2007, ABC implemented a series of [[budget cut]]s, primarily directed towards its news department, which laid off most of its employees. The cuts, held prior to the [[2007 Philippine general election|2007 general elections]], left ABC almost incapable of coverage.\n\nIn November 2007, ABC debuted an array of new sports programming, including [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] basketball, pro boxing, and [[WWE]] events, as part of a new five-year deal with [[Solar Entertainment Corporation|Solar Entertainment]]. However, due to their high costs and poor ratings, these programs were later dropped throughout 2008, and its NBA review show \"House of Hoops\" was cut back as well and eventually cancelled by April 2008. However, much of these programs, along with the PBA (as ABC elected not to renew its contract through the ended after the [[2008 PBA Fiesta Conference|2008 Fiesta Conference]]), would be picked up by [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]], who had begun a much wider partnership with Solar earlier in 2007, which led to its privatization by the latter in 2011.\n\n===TV5 era (2008\u20132018)===\n\n==== ABC-MPB Primedia Partnership (2008\u20132010) ====\nIn March 2008, Cojuangco announced that ABC had reached a partnership with MPB Primedia Inc., a local company backed by [[Media Prima|Media Prima Berhad]] of [[Malaysia]] as part of a long-term strategy to make the network more competitive.

This forced the network to implement a series of retrenchment of its employees. The biggest retrenchment happened in September 2015, when TV5's entertainment division got on the verge of dissolution and its employees were laid off, including [[Wilma Galvante]], its Chief Entertainment Content Officer. From 4,000 employees in mid-2013, the series of retrenchment resizes TV5 to merely around 700 employees by the end of 2017.\n\nIncapable of producing original content, TV5 appointed [[Viva Entertainment]] CEO, Vicente \"Vic\" Del Rosario as the network's new Chief Entertainment Strategist, implementing changes on TV5's entertainment programming. These included a formation of the Viva-TV5 joint venture [[Sari-Sari Channel]] and outsourcing [[Viva Entertainment|Viva Television]] for its entertainment shows, including [[Ang Panday (2016 TV series)|a revival of ''Ang Panday'']], the return of [[Diether Ocampo]] and [[Claudine Barretto]]'s tandem in ''[[Bakit Manipis ang Ulap?]]'' and shows from by-then sister station [[MTV Pinoy]] such as ''Top 20 Pilipinas''. New shows started to air between November 2015 and February 2016 but were cancelled a few months later due to lack of advertisement support and poor ratings.\n\nSince January 2016, TV5 and [[Cignal]] via [[Hyper (TV channel)|Hyper]] will be the official Free TV and Pay TV partner, respectively, of the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] in the Philippines.\n\nBy July 2016, TV5 began airing selected programs from [[MTV]] and [[MTV International]] like ''[[Catfish]]'', ''[[Ridiculousness (TV series)|Ridiculousness]]'' and ''[[Ex on the Beach]]'' after inking a deal with [[Viacom International Media Networks]] that month to create the new MTV on TV5 block.\n\nOn 8 September 2016, TV5 cancelled its locally produced programs ''[[Aksyon Bisaya]]'' (Cebu) and ''[[Aksyon Dabaw]]'' (Davao) due to cost-cutting measures. With this move, the personnel remained employed as they will continue file reports for ''[[Aksyon]]'' newscasts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/local-news/2016/09/09/cost-cutting-leaves-tv5-cebu-journalists-workers-limbo-496590|title=Cost cutting leaves TV5 Cebu journalists, workers in limbo|publisher=[[Sun.Star Cebu]]|last=Baquero|first=Elias O.|date=8 September 2016|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 September 2016, TV5 President and CEO Emmanuel \"Noel\" C. Lorenzana stepped down from his position. He was replaced by basketball coach and Sports5/D5 Studio head, Vicente \"Chot\" Reyes the following day. Following his appointment, the network announced it would be retrenching around 200 employees as part of TV5's digitalization.\n\nIn April 2017, TV5 acquired the rights to air the [[WWE]] after [[Fox Channel Asia|Fox Philippines]] decision to not renew its contract with the WWE due to unknown reasons. The network previously handle the rights from 2007\u201308 and 2010.\n\nOn 12 October 2017, TV5 Network announced its partnership with [[ESPN]], licensing its PBA, UFC, PSL and NFL rights and giving TV5 access to ESPN programs and content. The partnership formed the '''ESPN5''' brand, that is airing on TV5 and [[AksyonTV]].<ref>{{cite news|title=TV5 and ESPN collaborate to launch ESPN 5|url=http://sports.tv5.com.ph/sports5/article/tv5-and-espn-collaborate-to-launch-espn-5|work=Sports5|publisher=[[TV5 Network|TV5 Network, Inc.]]|date=11 October 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012201619/http://sports.tv5.com.ph/sports5/article/tv5-and-espn-collaborate-to-launch-espn-5|archivedate=12 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Interaksyon|title=ESPN-5 IS HERE &#124; TV5 announces partnership with \u2018Worldwide Leader in Sports\u2019|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/sports/2017/10/12/102970/espn-5-is-here-tv5-announces-partnership-with-worldwide-leader-in-sports/|accessdate=11 January 2019|work=Interaksyon|publisher=Philstar Global Corporation|date=12 October 2017}}</ref> The said deal comes in response to the network's formal, albeit temporary shift from a general entertainment station to a sports and news channel.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mercurio|first1=Richmond|title=TV5 narrows losses in 2018|url=https://www.philstar.com/business/2019/01/11/1883955/tv5-narrows-losses-2018|accessdate=11 January 2019|work=[[The Philippine Star|Philstar.com]]|publisher=Philstar Global Corp.|date=11 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== The 5 Network era (2018\u20132020) ===\nOn 17 February 2018, in line with the recent changes within the network and in celebration of its 10th anniversary, TV5 was relaunched as The 5 Network or simply '''5''' with a new logo and station ID entitled ''Get It on 5'', whereas the TV on the top right quadrant of the logo has been dropped, making it more flexible for the other divisions to use it as part of their own identity. Aside from rebranding, TV5's programming grid has also divided into three blocks: ESPN5 (Sports), News 5, and On 5 (Entertainment, Anime, Cartoons, Informative and Home TV Shopping), along with D5 Studio (Digital Content) and Studio 5 (World-class Filipino productions for audiences across all platforms). Along with the rebrand, the ''Kapatid'' moniker was also deemphasized and is now only used by News5 and ESPN5 for some of its programs. But the more visible change was the slow quiet phraseout of Filipino-dubbed movies and foreign-acquired programming, a feature that dated back from its MPB Primedia era in 2008. Today, even more of its ''Disney Club on 5'' programs and more of its movies are now aired in the English language.\n\nOn 13 January 2019, coinciding with the reformat of [[AksyonTV]] to [[5 Plus]], 5 introduced a variation of its 2018 logo. It has also since included the websites of the division producing the program airing (e.g. TV5.com.ph for entertainment and blocktimers) as part of their on-screen graphics.\n\nOn 3 June 2019, [[Chot Reyes]] retired as TV5 President and CEO, which was immediately replaced by Jane Basas, which leads pay-TV provider and radio company [[Cignal TV|Cignal TV/Mediascape]]. Since her appointment, 5 has begun to outsource news and sports programming from its co-owned Cignal channels [[One News (Philippines)|One News]], [[One PH]], [[One Sports (Philippines)|One Sports]], and [[PBA Rush]]; it has also phased out its daytime [[ESPN5]] programs and relegated it to sister free-TV station [[5 Plus]] in favor of archived entertainment programs and expanded movie blocks. Jane Basas later revealed future plans for the network; which includes retaining its existing news programs and sports content in primetime, and reintroducing original entertainment programming through outsourcing from [[Cignal TV#Cignal Entertainment|Cignal Entertainment]] and other major blocktimers. The network also saw the return of former TV5 executive Perci Intalan as the station's head of programming in November.\n\nTV5 Network got its  25-year franchise extension under [[Republic Act]] 11320 but lapsed-into-law on 22 April 2019 without President [[Rodrigo Duterte|Rodrigo Roa Duterte]]'s signature coincided with the 25-year franchise extension of [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines|CBCP]] under [[Republic Act]] 11319 also lapsed-into-law on that same day  without Chief Executive's signature.\n\nOn 4 February 2020, Robert P. Galang has been appointed as the new President and CEO of TV5 Network and [[Cignal TV]], replacing Basas who has been appointed as the new Chief Marketing Officer of [[Smart Communications]].\n\nOn 8 March 2020, 5's sister channel [[5 Plus]] was relaunched as [[One Sports (TV channel)|One Sports]] (moving from being a Cignal-exclusive pay television channel), with the ESPN5 division also being renamed and merged to the abovementioned brand. As a result, all sports programming on 5 no longer bears the ''ESPN5'' banner. Despite the change, the ESPN5 partnership continues online, with ESPN5.com serving as the de-facto sports portal of One Sports in the Philippines. On the same day, TV5 Network announced that 5 would be rebranded as '''One TV''' (adopting from Cignal TV's \"One\"-branded channels), which was originally scheduled on 13 April 2020. However, due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the Philippines|coronavirus pandemic]] and the Luzon-wide community quarantine was extended until 30 April 2020, the rebranding will take effect once the community quarantine ends on May 2020.\n\n==Branding of 5==\n===Network identity===\nOn 19 June 1960, newspaper publisher [[Chino Roces|Joaquin \"Chino\" Roces]] launched its television station in the Philippines, then known as the Associated Broadcasting Corporation.<ref name=\"ra2945\" /> Since then, the network evolved and used different brandings until it became widely known from what it is today.\n\n:*'''Associated Broadcasting Corporation''' (1960\u20131972) \u2014 founded by [[Chino Roces|Joaquin \"Chino\" Roces]] until it was forced to shut down in 1972 following the declaration of the [[Ferdinand E. Marcos#Martial law and the New Society|Martial Law]] by President Marcos.\n:*'''Associated Broadcasting Company''' (1992\u20132008) \u2014 fully restored after being granted a new franchise led by its new stockholders Edward Tan and Roces' son, Edgardo Roces. It was acquired by businessman Antonio O. Cojuangco Jr. in 2003.\n:*'''TV5''' (2008\u20132018) \u2014 renamed as TV5 after ABC entered a partnership with MPB Primedia, Inc. backed by the Malaysian media group [[Media Prima|Media Prima Berhad]]. In 2010, [[Media Prima]] divested its share with [[MediaQuest Holdings|MediaQuest Holdings, Inc.]] to business tycoon [[Manuel V. Pangilinan]]. Upon relaunch as ''5'', the TV5 branding became obsolete, only to be used during station sign-on and sign-off messages, social media accounts, and selected program teasers.\n:*'''5 (The 5 Network)''' (2018\u20132020) \u2014 TV5 was relaunched as The 5 Network or simply ''5'' on 17 February 2018. The station launched its numerical 5 logo, making it more flexible for the other divisions to use it as part of their own identity, as its programming grid is divided into news, sports, and entertainment. Although, '''TV5''' was still used to refer to both the channel and the company itself.\n:*'''One TV''' (May 2020) - 5 will be relaunched as One TV starting on the May 2020. This will make them the 6th TV station under PLDT-Smart's MediaQuest to take the \"One\" branding.\n\n===Logos===\nTV5 used several logos since it was established in 1960. In 1960, the network used a 5 Logo derived from its flagship station in [[Metro Manila]], [[DWET-TV|DZTM-TV]] carried in VHF channel 5 until it was shut down in 1972. When it returned to the airwaves, the network used a more-known ABC 5 logo with an iconic cyclone icon, incorporating the colors [[red]], [[blue]] and [[green]]\u2014colors making up a [[pixel]] shown on the [[television]] technology of 1992. The number 5 was removed to the logo in 1995 but retaining its ABC and the cyclone icon. In 2001, the logo added its slogan Come home to ABC, the same logo used in April 2004 with its new slogan Iba Tayo. The last logo as ABC in September 2004 has been enclosed with a yellow circle. The logo changed after its re-launch in 2008 having the new name of the network TV5 inside a shaking television. In 2010, the network used a red circle being shined in the northwest corner carrying the name TV5 with the letters TV in the northeastern part above the largely sized number 5. The logo adopted a 3D version in 2013 and applying it on-air, although the 2010 2D version oftentimes appear.\n\nIn 2018, TV5 adopted its numerical 5 logo, which was first appeared on [[ESPN5]] logo, which was launched on October 2017, dropping the \"TV\" word on the northeastern quadrant as part of their ''Get It on 5'' campaign. They also started to display the name of the current program using the format: \"(title) ''on 5''\" as the part of the logo (usually applied to entertainment and other programs not provided by either News5 or ESPN5; except blocktimers, where only the 5 logo is displayed) resulting to viewers mistakenly thought \"on\" was part of the title. The numerical five logo was also simultaneously adopted for TV5 sister divisions [[News5]], [[DWFM|Radyo 5]], and [[Digital5|D5 Studio]].\n\nA variation of the current numerical 5 logo was unveiled on 13 January 2019, similar to the newly launched network, [[5 Plus]].\n\n==Programming==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by 5 (TV channel)}}\n5's program lineup includes news and current affairs programs, dubbed cartoons, movies, American drama, sports, informative, talk shows, infomercials and Japanese anime shows.\n\nOn its second month since its re-launch last 9 August 2008, TV5 has been reportedly on Top 3 based on the [[AGB Nielsen Philippines|AGB Nielsen]] survey. It also gained its rating on their ''Nick on TV5'' morning cartoon block, and its popularity because of their former AniMEGA primetime anime block.\n\nIn 2013, the network's ratings improved as they launched the Weekend Do It Better and Everyday All The Way programming blocks under the helm of the former Chief Entertainment Content Officer, [[Wilma Galvante]] (2012\u20132015), however some of the programs under the block were discontinued, particularly due to low ratings.\n\nIn 2014, the network launched another set of new programs under the \"Happy Ka Dito!\" campaign.\n\nIn 2015, TV5 launched more than a dozen programs that are more focused to light entertainment and sports programming under its \"Happy sa 2015\" campaign. Also the said year, viewers sought the return of AniMEGA.\n\nMonths later, TV5's entertainment programming were produced by different content providers, including Unitel Productions (TV5's sister company), The IdeaFirst Company (formed by former TV5 Entertainment Head Perci Intalan) and Content Cows Company Inc. (formed by Galvante). By 14 October 2015, TV5 Network named [[Sari-Sari Channel|Sari-Sari Network]] as the main production outfit of TV5. They also appointed SSN Co-CEO and [[Viva Entertainment|Viva]] executive, Vicente \"Vic\" Del Rosario as the new Chief Entertainment Strategist of the network. He will handle all of the entertainment programs broadcast by the network. It happened a month after TV5, Cignal and Viva inked a deal to create [[Sari-Sari Channel|Sari-Sari Network]] (SSN). New shows for 2016 were also launched by TV5 together with [[Viva Entertainment]] last 25 November 2015. However, all programs produced by Viva were phased out between July and August 2016 due to management disagreements following an attempted partnership of shows.\n\nJust recently, [[Brillante Mendoza]] signed a contract with TV5 last December 2016 to make made-for-TV movies to be aired on the network under the ''Brillante Mendoza Presents'' umbrella.
