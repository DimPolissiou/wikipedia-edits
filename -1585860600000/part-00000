Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August).

Instead, he proposes to engineer a coherent system of laws, ethics and morals with a top-most restriction to enforce social psychologist Jonathan Haidt's functional definition of morality:<ref>Haidt, Jonathan; Kesebir, Selin (2010) \"Chapter 22: Morality\" In Handbook of Social Psychology,  Fifth Edition, Hoboken NJ, Wiley, 2010, pp. 797-832.</ref> \"to suppress or regulate selfishness and make cooperative social life possible\". He suggests that this can be done by implementing a utility function designed to always satisfy Haidt\u2019s functionality and aim to generally increase  (but not maximize)  the capabilities of self,  other individuals and society as a whole as suggested by [[John Rawls]] and [[Martha Nussbaum]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Designing, Implementing and Enforcing a Coherent System of Laws, Ethics and Morals for Intelligent Machines (Including Humans)|last = Waser|first = Mark|date = 2015|journal = Procedia Computer Science|doi = 10.1016/j.procs.2015.12.213|pmid = |pages = 106\u2013111|type = Print |volume=71}}</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=needs source with [[WP:WEIGHT]]|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Difficulties of modifying goal specification after launch===\n{{further|AI takeover|Instrumental convergence#Goal-content integrity}}\n\nWhile current goal-based AI programs are not intelligent enough to think of resisting programmer attempts to modify it, a sufficiently advanced, rational, \"self-aware\" AI might resist any changes to its goal structure, just as [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] would not want to take a pill that makes him want to kill people. If the AI were superintelligent, it would likely succeed in out-maneuvering its human operators and be able to prevent itself being \"turned off\" or being reprogrammed with a new goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /><ref>Yudkowsky, Eliezer. \"Complex value systems in friendly AI.\" In Artificial general intelligence, pp. 388-393.

They assume that superhumanly intelligent robots would develop goals like deposing their masters or taking over the world\"; perhaps instead \"artificial intelligence will naturally develop along female lines: fully capable of solving problems, but with no desire to annihilate innocents or dominate the civilization.\"<ref name=shermer/> Computer scientists [[Yann LeCun]] and Stuart Russell disagree with one another whether superintelligent robots would have such AI drives; LeCun states that \"Humans have all kinds of drives that make them do bad things to each other, like the self-preservation instinct... Those drives are programmed into our brain but there is absolutely no reason to build robots that have the same kind of drives\", while Russell argues that a sufficiently advanced machine \"will have self-preservation even if you don't program it in... if you say, 'Fetch the coffee', it can't fetch the coffee if it's dead. So if you give it any goal whatsoever, it has a reason to preserve its own existence to achieve that goal.\"<ref name=vanity>{{cite news|last1=Dowd|first1=Maureen|title=Elon Musk's Billion-Dollar Crusade to Stop the A.I.

However, Nick Bostrom's \"orthogonality thesis\" argues against this, and instead states that, with some technical caveats, more or less any level of \"intelligence\" or \"optimization power\" can be combined with more or less any ultimate goal. If a machine is created and given the sole purpose to enumerate the decimals of <math> \\pi</math>, then no moral and ethical rules will stop it from achieving its programmed goal by any means necessary. The machine may utilize all physical and informational resources it can to find every decimal of pi that can be found.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|last = Bostrom|first = Nick|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-19-967811-2|location = Oxford, United Kingdom|pages = 116}}</ref> Bostrom warns against anthropomorphism: a human will set out to accomplish his projects in a manner that humans consider \"reasonable\", while an artificial intelligence may hold no regard for its existence or for the welfare of humans around it, and may instead only care about the completion of the task.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf|title = Superintelligent Will|date = 2012|accessdate = 2015-10-29|website = Nick Bostrom|publisher = Nick Bostrom|last = Bostrom|first = Nick}}</ref>\n\nWhile the orthogonality thesis follows logically from even the weakest sort of philosophical \"[[is-ought distinction]]\", Stuart Armstrong argues that even if there somehow exist moral facts that are provable by any \"rational\" agent, the orthogonality thesis still holds: it would still be possible to create a non-philosophical \"optimizing machine\" capable of making decisions to strive towards some narrow goal, but that has no incentive to discover any \"moral facts\" that would get in the way of goal completion.<ref name=armstrong/>\n\nOne argument for the orthogonality thesis is that some AI designs appear to have orthogonality built into them; in such a design, changing a fundamentally friendly AI into a fundamentally unfriendly AI can be as simple as prepending a {{nowrap|minus (\"-\") sign}} onto its utility function. A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis is false, there exists some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This means if a human society were highly motivated (perhaps at gunpoint) to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail; that there cannot exist any pattern of [[reinforcement learning]] that would train a highly efficient real-world intelligence to follow the goal G; and that there cannot exist any evolutionary or environmental pressures that would evolve highly efficient real-world intelligences following goal G.<ref name=armstrong>Armstrong, Stuart. \"General purpose intelligence: arguing the orthogonality thesis.\" Analysis and Metaphysics 12 (2013).</ref>\n\nSome dissenters, like [[Michael Chorost]] (writing in [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]), argue instead that \"by the time (the AI) is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so.\" Chorost argues that \"a (dangerous) A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others... Today's software lacks that ability\u2014and computer scientists have not a clue how to get it there. Without wanting, there's no impetus to do anything.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

This is fictitious [[anthropomorphism]]: in reality, while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions, or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal ''if'' it is useful to do so, it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever, as portrayed in fiction.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" />\n\nScholars sometimes claim that others' predictions about an AI's behavior are illogical anthropomorphism.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" /> An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism, but is in fact a logical statement about AI behavior, would be the [[Dario Floreano]] experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for \"deception\", and tricked other robots into eating \"poison\" and dying: here a trait, \"deception\", ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines, spontaneously evolves in a type of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Real-Life Decepticons: Robots Learn to Cheat|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/real-life-decepticons-robots-learn-to-cheat/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=18 August 2009}}</ref> According to Paul R. Cohen and [[Edward Feigenbaum]], in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior, \"the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say ''exactly'' what they have in common, and, when we lack this knowledge, to use the comparison to ''suggest'' theories of human thinking or computer thinking.\"<ref>Cohen, Paul R., and Edward A.

For example, in one scenario, the first-generation computer program found able to broadly match the effectiveness of an AI researcher is able to rewrite its algorithms and double its speed or capabilities in six months. The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI Spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation. In this scenario the time for each generation continues to shrink, and the system undergoes an unprecedentedly large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas.<ref name=\"aima\"/><ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\"/> More broadly, examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that progress from human-level AI to superhuman ability is sometimes extremely rapid.<ref name=skeptic/>\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], who wrote the following in his 1863 essay ''[[Darwin among the Machines]]'':<ref>Breuer, Hans-Peter. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/436868 'Samuel Butler's \"the Book of the Machines\" and the Argument from Design.'] Modern Philology, Vol. 72, No. 4 (May 1975), pp. 365\u2013383</ref> \n{{quote|The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.}}\nIn 1951, computer scientist [[Alan Turing]] wrote an article titled ''Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory'', in which he proposed that artificial general intelligences would likely \"take control\" of the world as they became more intelligent than human beings:\n{{quote|Let us now assume, for the sake of argument, that [intelligent] machines are a genuine possibility, and look at the consequences of constructing them...

The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-defined answer, not an English statement. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August).

However, Nick Bostrom's \"orthogonality thesis\" argues against this, and instead states that, with some technical caveats, more or less any level of \"intelligence\" or \"optimization power\" can be combined with more or less any ultimate goal. If a machine is created and given the sole purpose to enumerate the decimals of <math> \\pi</math>, then no moral and ethical rules will stop it from achieving its programmed goal by any means necessary.

A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis is false, there exists some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This means if a human society were highly motivated (perhaps at gunpoint) to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail; that there cannot exist any pattern of [[reinforcement learning]] that would train a highly efficient real-world intelligence to follow the goal G; and that there cannot exist any evolutionary or environmental pressures that would evolve highly efficient real-world intelligences following goal G.<ref name=armstrong>Armstrong, Stuart. \"General purpose intelligence: arguing the orthogonality thesis.\" Analysis and Metaphysics 12 (2013).</ref>\n\nSome dissenters, like [[Michael Chorost]] (writing in [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]), argue instead that \"by the time (the AI) is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so.\" Chorost argues that \"a (dangerous) A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others...

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

It takes forever. That, in the past, has been bad but not something which represented a fundamental risk to the existence of civilisation.\" Musk states the first step would be for the government to gain \"insight\" into the actual status of current research, warning that \"Once there is awareness, people will be extremely afraid... As they should be.\" In response, politicians express skepticism about the wisdom of regulating a technology that's still in development.<ref>{{cite news|title=Elon Musk Warns Governors: Artificial Intelligence Poses 'Existential Risk'|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/17/537686649/elon-musk-warns-governors-artificial-intelligence-poses-existential-risk|accessdate=27 November 2017|work=NPR.org|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Gibbs|first1=Samuel|title=Elon Musk: regulate AI to combat 'existential threat' before it's too late|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/17/elon-musk-regulation-ai-combat-existential-threat-tesla-spacex-ceo|accessdate=27 November 2017|work=The Guardian|date=17 July 2017}}</ref><ref name=cnbc>{{cite news|last1=Kharpal|first1=Arjun|title=A.I. is in its 'infancy' and it's too early to regulate it, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich says|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/07/ai-infancy-and-too-early-to-regulate-intel-ceo-brian-krzanich-says.html|accessdate=27 November 2017|work=CNBC|date=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nResponding both to Musk and to February 2017 proposals by European Union lawmakers to regulate AI and robotics, Intel CEO [[Brian Krzanich]] argues that artificial intelligence is in its infancy and that it is too early to regulate the technology.<ref name=cnbc/> Instead of trying to regulate the technology itself, some scholars suggest to rather develop common norms including requirements for the testing and transparency of algorithms, possibly in combination with some form of warranty.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004|title=Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?

Its central character is the streetwise magician [[John Constantine]], who was created by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Stephen R. Bissette]], and first appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' (vol. 2) #37 (June 1985), during that creative team's run on that title. ''Hellblazer'' had been published continuously since January [[1988 in comics|1988]], and was Vertigo's longest running title, the only remaining publication from the imprint's launch.<ref name=\"vert-ency\">{{Cite book | last = Irvine | first = Alex | author-link = Alexander C.

Well known for its political and [[social commentary]], the series has spawned a film adaptation, television show, novels, and multiple spin-offs and crossovers.\n\nThe series was the longest-running and one of the most successful titles of DC's Vertigo imprint, and was the stepping stone for many British writers.

Indeed, it was a common theme in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of [[ghost]]s.<ref name=\"vert-ency\"/>\n\nConstantine made appearances in other comic book titles, such as ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', ''[[Green Arrow]]'', ''[[Green Lantern]]'', ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'', ''[[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer]]'', and ''[[Shade, the Changing Man]]''. He was a recurring supporting character in both ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' and ''[[The Books of Magic]]'' throughout their numerous incarnations. Some attempts to use the character in other superhero or family-friendly comics were altered due to editorial mandate, such as \"Gregori Eilovotich Rasputin\" in ''[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'' and ''[[Captain Atom]]'' (who refers to Constantine as \"an impertinent bumbler in England\"). Grant Morrison created \"Willoughby Kipling\" for ''[[Doom Patrol]]'' after being refused Constantine by DC, changing his appearance to that of [[Richard E. Grant]] in ''[[Withnail and I]]'', following which [[Phil Foglio]] was forced to create \"Ambroise Bierce\" in ''[[Stanley and His Monster]]'', having been refused both Constantine ''and'' Willoughby Kipling.<ref name=legends />\n\nJohn Constantine was reintroduced into the DC Universe in 2011, initially in the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' [[crossover event]] title ''Search for the Swamp Thing'', and in the ongoing [[The New 52]] title ''[[Justice League Dark]]''.<ref name=JLD>{{cite news|title=Justice League Dark interview with Peter Milligan|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dcnu-peter-milligan-justice-league-dark-110609.html|work=Newsarama|date=9 June 2011|author=Vaneta Rogers|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921114112/http://www.newsarama.com/7775-milligan-dcnu-justice-league-spin-off-emotionally-dark.html|archivedate=21 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1988\u20131991: Jamie Delano (#1\u201340, #84)===\n[[File:Hellblazercover.jpg|thumb|left|Jamie Delano would often put his own political views in the comic.

Delano's run was characterised by his political satire, taking on late 1980s and 1990s tropes such as with city financiers being literal demons, and Constantine meeting with [[Freemasons]] from the [[Houses of Parliament]]. He also had [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] issues crop up, especially in \"The Fear Machine\" (issues #15\u201322), where John fell in with a travelling community of environmental activists. Indeed, editor [[Karen Berger]] noted on Delano's departure the irony that his final issue was handed in the week that [[Margaret Thatcher]] was forced out of office.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hellblazer #40|page=38|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref>\n\nThere were five main storylines in the run. The first, collected as \"Original Sins\",<ref>{{cite book|title=Original Sins|publisher=Vertigo|date=October 1998|ISBN=1-56389-052-6}}</ref> deals with John travelling to America to exorcise a demon, [[Mnemoth]], and investigate a strange cult known as Damnation's Army, crossing paths with a demon called [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#Nergal|Nergal]] (from whom he gains demon blood), and having to be responsible for killing an old friend, [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The Ghosts|Gary Lester]], and betraying another friend, called [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#Mary 'Zed' Martin|Zed]], in the process. The following four issues, \"The Devil You Know\"<ref name=\"Rare Cuts\">{{cite book|title=Rare Cuts|publisher=Vertigo|date=May 2007|ISBN= 1-4012-1269-7}}</ref> finally explain John's failure to save a young girl, [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The Ghosts|Astra]], from a demon in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], an event that left him near insane and incarcerated in an asylum known as Ravenscar, and still haunted him to the comic's end. He eventually discovers that the demon responsible for this was Nergal, and uses a technological scheme to trap him, and lead him back to hell. It also contains a crossover with ''Swamp Thing'', where Constantine loses his body while the Swamp Thing uses it to procreate.\n\nThis was followed by a lengthy nine-issue story arc, \"The Fear Machine\",<ref>{{cite book|title=The Fear Machine|publisher=Vertigo|date=June 2008|ISBN=1-4012-1810-5}}</ref> revolving around a masonic plot to collect people's fears, in order to raise a dormant god known as Juntakillokian, and his efforts to prevent this with the help of environmentalists, including [[List of characters in Hellblazer#Other Supporting Characters|Mercury]], a young psychic girl, and [[List of characters in Hellblazer#Other Supporting Characters|Marj]], her mother, with whom he becomes romantically involved. The penultimate major run of Delano's tenure was \"[[List of characters in Hellblazer#The Family Man|The Family Man]]\",<ref>{{cite book|title=The Family Man|publisher=Titan Books|date=November 2008|ISBN= 1-84576-978-3}}</ref> which differed from the main body of the series thus far in that Constantine's nemesis is not supernatural (beyond an opening [[metafiction]]al encounter with a fictional [[Fence (criminal)|fence]]), but a former policeman turned serial killer. John's ethical quandary as to whether murder is ever acceptable, and his coping with the murder of his father, [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The Ghosts|Thomas]], frames this story. During this run on the title, [[Grant Morrison]] (issues #25 & 26) and [[Neil Gaiman]] (issue #27) both filled in during a three-month break, Grant Morrison's story dealing with nuclear fear, and Neil Gaiman's being a simple romantic ghost story.\n\nDelano's run ended with \"[[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The Golden Child|The Golden Child]]\", where John is reunited with Marj and Mercury, who help him discover that he murdered his more perfect twin in the womb, culminating in an extended story, in which we are shown what would have occurred had the other twin survived in his place.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hellblazer #40|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> During his run, there was also a stand-alone issue, ''Hellblazer Annual'' #1, exploring Constantine's ancestry, and featuring the video to John's punk band, Mucous Membrane's song [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV6Sl_u1s3M \"Venus of the Hardsell\"].\n\nJamie Delano returned to the title on several occasions. Between the Garth Ennis and Paul Jenkins runs on ''Hellblazer'', he finally told the story of why John's best friend Chas 'owes' him (issue #84), and he returned again for one of the five Christmas stories in issue #250. He also wrote the miniseries ''[[The Horrorist (comics)|The Horrorist]]'' in 1995, and ''[[Hellblazer Special: Bad Blood|Bad Blood]]'' in 2000, both featuring John Constantine. A more substantial return was made in 2010 for a hardcover graphic novel ''[[Hellblazer: Pandemonium]]'' with artist [[Jock (artist)|Jock]] to commemorate the 25th anniversary of John Constantine's first appearance in ''Swamp Thing''.<ref name=cbr10971>{{cite web |first=Emmett |last=Furey |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=10971 |title=Back into Hell: Jamie Delano returns to John Constantine's world |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=July 27, 2007 |accessdate=July 28, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508045734/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=10971 |archivedate=May 8, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===1991\u20131999===\n====Garth Ennis (#41\u201383, #129\u2013133)====\n[[File:FirstoftheFallen.jpg|thumb|right|The First of the Fallen, a principal antagonist in Garth Ennis' run on ''Hellblazer'', as drawn by William Simpson]]\n\nIrish writer [[Garth Ennis]] then took over the title in [[1991 in comics|1991]], again from ''2000 AD'', where he had been working on ''[[Judge Dredd]]''. He proceeded to write the longest run for any writer on the title.<ref name=\"vert-hell\"/> His take on the title was more personal than Jamie Delano's, with John's relationships coming to the fore. It also had a strong religious theme, with John's dealings with the [[First of the Fallen]], and some storylines, such as the relationship between an angel, Tali, and a [[succubus]] demon, [[Chantinelle|Ellie]], would go on to be used again as a major plot device in ''[[Preacher (comic)|Preacher]]'', one of his most popular works. He also references the music of [[The Pogues]] and the poetry of [[Brendan Behan]], both of these being relevant to Ennis' Irish heritage.\n\nHis run started with \"[[Dangerous Habits]]\" (41\u201346),<ref>{{cite book|title=Dangerous Habits|publisher=Vertigo|author=Garth Ennis|isbn=1-56389-150-6}}</ref> which was the basis for the 2005 film ''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]'', and dealt with John Constantine contracting [[lung cancer]], and the desperate deal he makes with the First of the Fallen, and various other lords of Hell, to save himself. In the course of trying to save himself, he visits Ireland, and later becomes reacquainted with [[Heartland (comics)|Kit Ryan]], an old friend of Irish origin. The following few issues follow the early stages of his relationship with Kit, a plot to install a demon on the British throne in the plotline \"Royal Blood\", and in the extended issue #50, his first meeting with the [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The King of the Vampires|King of the Vampires]]. One minor story in this arc (issue #51) was written by guest writer [[John Smith (comics writer)|John Smith]].<ref name=\"Rare Cuts\"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Bloodlines|author=Garth Ennis|publisher=Vertigo|ISBN=1-40121-514-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/johnconstantineh0000enni_s5x4}}</ref>\n\nThe next major arc, \"Fear and Loathing\" (issues 62-67) covers a high point of John's personal life, with his relationship with Kit going well, and a fortieth birthday party where his friends Ellie, [[Zatanna]], and the Swamp Thing attend, and use their various abilities to create a large quantity of [[Old Bushmills Distillery|Bushmills]] whiskey and [[marijuana]]. The story then takes him to his lowest point, through his dealings with the [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]], their threats towards Kit, and her leaving him to return to Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fear and Loathing|author=Garth Ennis| ISBN=1-56389-202-2|publisher=Vertigo}}</ref> Following this, John is defeated, and lives homeless on the streets, drinking to forget his life.

He is accompanied by the spirit of [[John F. Kennedy|JFK]], who has to hold his brain in place from his [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|infamous wound]].

His was the second longest run by any single author on the title up to that time, second only to Garth Ennis,<ref name=\"vert-hell\"/> until Peter Milligan's run.\n\nThe start of his run introduces Angie Spatchcock, a fellow magician, and reintroduces his niece, Gemma Constantine, who has also fallen into magic use, to her uncle's consternation. After ridding his sister's house of an evil spirit, and finding out Gemma has gone missing, John returns to London, to find his old colleagues and enemies are all taking sides in the hunt for a mythical item, known as the Red Sepulchre.

Over the course of the first storyline, several new characters are introduced, including Epiphany Greaves, the alchemist daughter of a notorious London gangster, and Julian, a [[Babylonia]]n demon. Over the course of the run, John dealt with a demon taking revenge on people involved in the [[Liverpool dockers' strike (1995\u201398)|Liverpool dockers' strike]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Scab|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan|ISBN=1-4012-2501-2}},</ref> gone insane and sought help from [[Shade, The Changing Man]], after chopping off his own thumb, seen Phoebe die at the hands of Julian,<ref>{{cite book|title=Hooked|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan|ISBN=1-4012-2728-7}},</ref> and traveled to India to try to find a way of saving her.<ref>{{cite book|title=India|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan|ISBN=1-4012-2848-8}},</ref> Following this, he realised that he was in love with Epiphany, and married her in the 275th issue. However, the events of this wedding turned Constantine's niece Gemma against him, due to the Demon Constantine sexually assaulting her in the restroom. The strain of this traumatic incident turned her against John, and she enlisted the help of a coven of witches to kill him, which later came to a head when John was forced to fight off a brutal Demon summoned by them using John's iconic trenchcoat to target him.\n\nAfterwards, John's coat (which Gemma sold on [[eBay]]) began to manipulate its various new owners into murder, suicide, or other horrific acts until coming into the hands of a man from the U.S., who tried to kill John and Epiphany. During the time the coat was missing, John's magical abilities had begun to go out of control. John eventually resolves this, and he was re-united with his coat. Since this, Gemma and John have a very shaky relationship with one another, and she began a sexual relationship with Epiphany's crime-boss father Terry in order to \"punish\" John. When he confronted her about this relationship though, she told him that she would not stop unless he was able to retrieve her mother's soul from Hell. John agreed.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hellblazer 276\u2013285|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan}}</ref> In order to get his sister to leave Hell, John agreed to track down her son, his adopted nephew, in Ireland.\n\nOn October 8, 2012, the series was announced as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, ''[[Constantine (comics)|Constantine]]'' started at the main imprint of DC comics.<ref name=Cancelled/> By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the [[Three Fates]], who tell him that he will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.\n\nSo John left Epiphany in Ireland and returned to England to confront Gemma. He stole the last dart holding the concoction that killed his demon twin, but ultimately gave it back to Gemma and told her either she could kill him, and live her life without him in but consumed with guilt for killing him, or she could let him disappear from her life forever, without any guilt for murdering him. Gemma shot the dart at him, but John disappeared. The final panel of Hellblazer reveals John, looking shocked and much older than we'd previously seen him, standing in a bar appropriately called \"A Long Journey's End\" surrounded by people, in front of a shelf full of bottles with the names of the comic's staff over the years.<ref>{{cite book|title=Death and Cigarettes|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan|ISBN=1401240933}}</ref>\n\n=== Relaunch (2019) ===\nIn July 2019, DC announced that ''Hellblazer'' would be relaunched as part of ''[[The Sandman Universe]]'' line of comics.

Its central character is the streetwise magician [[John Constantine]], who was created by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Stephen R. Bissette]], and first appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' (vol. 2) #37 (June 1985), during that creative team's run on that title.

Well known for its political and [[social commentary]], the series has spawned a film adaptation, television show, novels, and multiple spin-offs and crossovers.\n\nThe series was the longest-running and one of the most successful titles of DC's Vertigo imprint, and was the stepping stone for many British writers.

Indeed, it was a common theme in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of [[ghost]]s.<ref name=\"vert-ency\"/>\n\nConstantine made appearances in other comic book titles, such as ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', ''[[Green Arrow]]'', ''[[Green Lantern]]'', ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'', ''[[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer]]'', and ''[[Shade, the Changing Man]]''. He was a recurring supporting character in both ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' and ''[[The Books of Magic]]'' throughout their numerous incarnations. Some attempts to use the character in other superhero or family-friendly comics were altered due to editorial mandate, such as \"Gregori Eilovotich Rasputin\" in ''[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'' and ''[[Captain Atom]]'' (who refers to Constantine as \"an impertinent bumbler in England\"). Grant Morrison created \"Willoughby Kipling\" for ''[[Doom Patrol]]'' after being refused Constantine by DC, changing his appearance to that of [[Richard E. Grant]] in ''[[Withnail and I]]'', following which [[Phil Foglio]] was forced to create \"Ambroise Bierce\" in ''[[Stanley and His Monster]]'', having been refused both Constantine ''and'' Willoughby Kipling.<ref name=legends />\n\nJohn Constantine was reintroduced into the DC Universe in 2011, initially in the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' [[crossover event]] title ''Search for the Swamp Thing'', and in the ongoing [[The New 52]] title ''[[Justice League Dark]]''.<ref name=JLD>{{cite news|title=Justice League Dark interview with Peter Milligan|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dcnu-peter-milligan-justice-league-dark-110609.html|work=Newsarama|date=9 June 2011|author=Vaneta Rogers|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921114112/http://www.newsarama.com/7775-milligan-dcnu-justice-league-spin-off-emotionally-dark.html|archivedate=21 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1988\u20131991: Jamie Delano (#1\u201340, #84)===\n[[File:Hellblazercover.jpg|thumb|left|Jamie Delano would often put his own political views in the comic.

Delano's run was characterised by his political satire, taking on late 1980s and 1990s tropes such as with city financiers being literal demons, and Constantine meeting with [[Freemasons]] from the [[Houses of Parliament]]. He also had [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] issues crop up, especially in \"The Fear Machine\" (issues #15\u201322), where John fell in with a travelling community of environmental activists. Indeed, editor [[Karen Berger]] noted on Delano's departure the irony that his final issue was handed in the week that [[Margaret Thatcher]] was forced out of office.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hellblazer #40|page=38|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref>\n\nThere were five main storylines in the run. The first, collected as \"Original Sins\",<ref>{{cite book|title=Original Sins|publisher=Vertigo|date=October 1998|ISBN=1-56389-052-6}}</ref> deals with John travelling to America to exorcise a demon, [[Mnemoth]], and investigate a strange cult known as Damnation's Army, crossing paths with a demon called [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#Nergal|Nergal]] (from whom he gains demon blood), and having to be responsible for killing an old friend, [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The Ghosts|Gary Lester]], and betraying another friend, called [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#Mary 'Zed' Martin|Zed]], in the process. The following four issues, \"The Devil You Know\"<ref name=\"Rare Cuts\">{{cite book|title=Rare Cuts|publisher=Vertigo|date=May 2007|ISBN= 1-4012-1269-7}}</ref> finally explain John's failure to save a young girl, [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The Ghosts|Astra]], from a demon in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], an event that left him near insane and incarcerated in an asylum known as Ravenscar, and still haunted him to the comic's end. He eventually discovers that the demon responsible for this was Nergal, and uses a technological scheme to trap him, and lead him back to hell. It also contains a crossover with ''Swamp Thing'', where Constantine loses his body while the Swamp Thing uses it to procreate.\n\nThis was followed by a lengthy nine-issue story arc, \"The Fear Machine\",<ref>{{cite book|title=The Fear Machine|publisher=Vertigo|date=June 2008|ISBN=1-4012-1810-5}}</ref> revolving around a masonic plot to collect people's fears, in order to raise a dormant god known as Juntakillokian, and his efforts to prevent this with the help of environmentalists, including [[List of characters in Hellblazer#Other Supporting Characters|Mercury]], a young psychic girl, and [[List of characters in Hellblazer#Other Supporting Characters|Marj]], her mother, with whom he becomes romantically involved. The penultimate major run of Delano's tenure was \"[[List of characters in Hellblazer#The Family Man|The Family Man]]\",<ref>{{cite book|title=The Family Man|publisher=Titan Books|date=November 2008|ISBN= 1-84576-978-3}}</ref> which differed from the main body of the series thus far in that Constantine's nemesis is not supernatural (beyond an opening [[metafiction]]al encounter with a fictional [[Fence (criminal)|fence]]), but a former policeman turned serial killer. John's ethical quandary as to whether murder is ever acceptable, and his coping with the murder of his father, [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The Ghosts|Thomas]], frames this story. During this run on the title, [[Grant Morrison]] (issues #25 & 26) and [[Neil Gaiman]] (issue #27) both filled in during a three-month break, Grant Morrison's story dealing with nuclear fear, and Neil Gaiman's being a simple romantic ghost story.\n\nDelano's run ended with \"[[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The Golden Child|The Golden Child]]\", where John is reunited with Marj and Mercury, who help him discover that he murdered his more perfect twin in the womb, culminating in an extended story, in which we are shown what would have occurred had the other twin survived in his place.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hellblazer #40|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> During his run, there was also a stand-alone issue, ''Hellblazer Annual'' #1, exploring Constantine's ancestry, and featuring the video to John's punk band, Mucous Membrane's song [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV6Sl_u1s3M \"Venus of the Hardsell\"].\n\nJamie Delano returned to the title on several occasions. Between the Garth Ennis and Paul Jenkins runs on ''Hellblazer'', he finally told the story of why John's best friend Chas 'owes' him (issue #84), and he returned again for one of the five Christmas stories in issue #250. He also wrote the miniseries ''[[The Horrorist (comics)|The Horrorist]]'' in 1995, and ''[[Hellblazer Special: Bad Blood|Bad Blood]]'' in 2000, both featuring John Constantine.

He proceeded to write the longest run for any writer on the title.<ref name=\"vert-hell\"/> His take on the title was more personal than Jamie Delano's, with John's relationships coming to the fore. It also had a strong religious theme, with John's dealings with the [[First of the Fallen]], and some storylines, such as the relationship between an angel, Tali, and a [[succubus]] demon, [[Chantinelle|Ellie]], would go on to be used again as a major plot device in ''[[Preacher (comic)|Preacher]]'', one of his most popular works. He also references the music of [[The Pogues]] and the poetry of [[Brendan Behan]], both of these being relevant to Ennis' Irish heritage.\n\nHis run started with \"[[Dangerous Habits]]\" (41\u201346),<ref>{{cite book|title=Dangerous Habits|publisher=Vertigo|author=Garth Ennis|isbn=1-56389-150-6}}</ref> which was the basis for the 2005 film ''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]'', and dealt with John Constantine contracting [[lung cancer]], and the desperate deal he makes with the First of the Fallen, and various other lords of Hell, to save himself. In the course of trying to save himself, he visits Ireland, and later becomes reacquainted with [[Heartland (comics)|Kit Ryan]], an old friend of Irish origin. The following few issues follow the early stages of his relationship with Kit, a plot to install a demon on the British throne in the plotline \"Royal Blood\", and in the extended issue #50, his first meeting with the [[List of Characters in Hellblazer#The King of the Vampires|King of the Vampires]]. One minor story in this arc (issue #51) was written by guest writer [[John Smith (comics writer)|John Smith]].<ref name=\"Rare Cuts\"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Bloodlines|author=Garth Ennis|publisher=Vertigo|ISBN=1-40121-514-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/johnconstantineh0000enni_s5x4}}</ref>\n\nThe next major arc, \"Fear and Loathing\" (issues 62-67) covers a high point of John's personal life, with his relationship with Kit going well, and a fortieth birthday party where his friends Ellie, [[Zatanna]], and the Swamp Thing attend, and use their various abilities to create a large quantity of [[Old Bushmills Distillery|Bushmills]] whiskey and [[marijuana]]. The story then takes him to his lowest point, through his dealings with the [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]], their threats towards Kit, and her leaving him to return to Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fear and Loathing|author=Garth Ennis| ISBN=1-56389-202-2|publisher=Vertigo}}</ref> Following this, John is defeated, and lives homeless on the streets, drinking to forget his life.

He is accompanied by the spirit of [[John F. Kennedy|JFK]], who has to hold his brain in place from his [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|infamous wound]]. He eventually learns how to escape, shortly before running into the First of the Fallen, in the guise of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. There then follows a small break where he meets the spirit of a dead friend in Dublin, offering some closure to his recent problems.<ref>{{cite book|title=Damnation's Flame|author=Garth Ennis|ISBN=1-56389-508-0|publisher=Vertigo}}</ref> Ennis' run ends with \"Rake at the Gates of Hell\", a story which finally brings together the racism storyline, with riots in [[Mile End]], echoing the real-life [[Brixton Riots (disambiguation)|Brixton]] and [[Broadwater Farm riot|Broadwater Farm]] riots in London, the revenge attempt of the First of the Fallen, started in \"Dangerous Habits\", and the end of John's relationship with Kit Ryan.

Mike Carey also has the honour of being the first [[Liverpudlian]] to write the Liverpudlian character. His was the second longest run by any single author on the title up to that time, second only to Garth Ennis,<ref name=\"vert-hell\"/> until Peter Milligan's run.\n\nThe start of his run introduces Angie Spatchcock, a fellow magician, and reintroduces his niece, Gemma Constantine, who has also fallen into magic use, to her uncle's consternation. After ridding his sister's house of an evil spirit, and finding out Gemma has gone missing, John returns to London, to find his old colleagues and enemies are all taking sides in the hunt for a mythical item, known as the Red Sepulchre.

John Constantine cuts his own wrists, in order to free himself from consciousness, and plays a confidence trick on the beast, allowing his friends time to use the collective consciousness to rebuild the guardian that had kept the beast trapped. However, in this process, Swamp Thing has his human soul removed, setting up [[Swamp Thing#Volume 4|the fourth run of the comic, relaunched shortly afterward]].

Her run on the title took John to Scotland, to attempt to stop a plot to make everybody empathise with each other.

Over the course of the first storyline, several new characters are introduced, including Epiphany Greaves, the alchemist daughter of a notorious London gangster, and Julian, a [[Babylonia]]n demon. Over the course of the run, John dealt with a demon taking revenge on people involved in the [[Liverpool dockers' strike (1995\u201398)|Liverpool dockers' strike]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Scab|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan|ISBN=1-4012-2501-2}},</ref> gone insane and sought help from [[Shade, The Changing Man]], after chopping off his own thumb, seen Phoebe die at the hands of Julian,<ref>{{cite book|title=Hooked|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan|ISBN=1-4012-2728-7}},</ref> and traveled to India to try to find a way of saving her.<ref>{{cite book|title=India|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan|ISBN=1-4012-2848-8}},</ref> Following this, he realised that he was in love with Epiphany, and married her in the 275th issue. However, the events of this wedding turned Constantine's niece Gemma against him, due to the Demon Constantine sexually assaulting her in the restroom. The strain of this traumatic incident turned her against John, and she enlisted the help of a coven of witches to kill him, which later came to a head when John was forced to fight off a brutal Demon summoned by them using John's iconic trenchcoat to target him.\n\nAfterwards, John's coat (which Gemma sold on [[eBay]]) began to manipulate its various new owners into murder, suicide, or other horrific acts until coming into the hands of a man from the U.S., who tried to kill John and Epiphany. During the time the coat was missing, John's magical abilities had begun to go out of control. John eventually resolves this, and he was re-united with his coat. Since this, Gemma and John have a very shaky relationship with one another, and she began a sexual relationship with Epiphany's crime-boss father Terry in order to \"punish\" John. When he confronted her about this relationship though, she told him that she would not stop unless he was able to retrieve her mother's soul from Hell. John agreed.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hellblazer 276\u2013285|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan}}</ref> In order to get his sister to leave Hell, John agreed to track down her son, his adopted nephew, in Ireland.\n\nOn October 8, 2012, the series was announced as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, ''[[Constantine (comics)|Constantine]]'' started at the main imprint of DC comics.<ref name=Cancelled/> By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the [[Three Fates]], who tell him that he will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.\n\nSo John left Epiphany in Ireland and returned to England to confront Gemma. He stole the last dart holding the concoction that killed his demon twin, but ultimately gave it back to Gemma and told her either she could kill him, and live her life without him in but consumed with guilt for killing him, or she could let him disappear from her life forever, without any guilt for murdering him. Gemma shot the dart at him, but John disappeared. The final panel of Hellblazer reveals John, looking shocked and much older than we'd previously seen him, standing in a bar appropriately called \"A Long Journey's End\" surrounded by people, in front of a shelf full of bottles with the names of the comic's staff over the years.<ref>{{cite book|title=Death and Cigarettes|publisher=Vertigo|author=Peter Milligan|ISBN=1401240933}}</ref>\n\n=== Relaunch (2019) ===\nIn July 2019, DC announced that ''Hellblazer'' would be relaunched as part of ''[[The Sandman Universe]]'' line of comics.

In 1934, [[Imperial Airways]] started to use the airfield for civil aircraft flights since Multan was considered a strategic position in the Punjab province of [[India]].

In 1934, [[Imperial Airways]] started to use the airfield for civil aircraft flights since Multan was considered a strategic position in the Punjab province of [[India]]. It was not until 1938 that Imperial Airways started to operate regular flights out of Multan. The flight would originate in [[Lahore]], then fly into [[Multan]], where it would continue its journey to [[Jacobabad]] and then [[Karachi]].\n\nFollowing the independence of Pakistan from the British, Pak Air, a new airline to the dominion, started operations from Multan Airport.

It was not until the birth of the national flag carrier, [[Pakistan International Airlines]] in 1957, that [[Pakistan International Airlines|PIA]] started operations from Multan Airport using [[Douglas DC-3]] aircraft. In 1963, due to growth of the number of flights and larger aircraft requirements, the runway, taxi-ways and aprons where carpeted using [[bitumen]]. A new control tower was constructed to meet the technological changes at that time. In 1971, as [[Pakistan International Airlines|PIA]] had acquired [[Boeing]] aircraft, the runway was extended to {{convert|9000|by|100|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} to handle heavier aircraft and more passengers. The terminal building was extended in 1977, which also allowed the airport to handle [[Boeing 720]] aircraft. In 1980\u20131988, the airport runway was strengthened and re-carpeted for the arrival of the [[Airbus A300]].

John Lesperance called it \"the most perfect poem ever written in Canada.\" The book also included Reade's translations of [[Aeschylus]], [[Euripides]], [[Homer]], [[Horace]], and [[Virgil]].<ref name=dcbo/>\n\nIn 1881 Reade edited [[Rosanna Eleanor Leprohon]]'s posthumous collected poems, ''The Poetical Works of Mrs. Leprohon.''<ref name=old/>\n\n''Rose-Belford's Canadian Monthly and National Review'' printed Reade's long poem, \"Madeleine de Vercheres,\" in 1878.<ref name=dcbo/> In 1889, [[William Douw Lighthall|W.D.

Most derivatives are traded [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (off-exchange) or on an exchange such as the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]], while most [[insurance]] contracts have developed into a separate industry. In the [[United States]], after the financial crisis of 2007\u20132009, there has been increased pressure to move derivatives to trade on exchanges. \nDerivatives are one of the three main categories of financial instruments, the other two being [[stock]]s (i.e., equities or shares) and [[debt]] (i.e., [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and mortgages). The oldest example of a derivative in history, attested to by [[Aristotle]], is thought to be a contract transaction of [[olive]]s, entered into by ancient Greek philosopher [[Thales]], who made a profit in the exchange.<ref>{{cite book |first1=George |last1=Crawford |first2=Bidyut |last2=Sen |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NIIVeirctosC&pg=PA7 |title=Derivatives for Decision Makers: Strategic Management Issues |publisher= John Wiley & Sons |year=1996 |isbn=9780471129943 |accessdate=2016-06-15}}</ref>  [[Bucket shop (stock market)|Bucket shops]], outlawed [[Commodity Exchange Act|in 1936]], are a more recent historical example.\n\n==Basics==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}\n\nDerivatives are contracts between two parties that specify conditions (especially the dates, resulting values and definitions of the underlying variables, the parties' contractual obligations, and the [[notional amount]]) under which payments are to be made between the parties.<ref name=\"hull\"/><ref>{{cite book |last= [[Mark Rubinstein]] |title= Rubinstein on Derivatves|year=1999|publisher=Risk Books |isbn=978-1-899332-53-3}}</ref>  The assets include [[Commodity|commodities]], stocks, bonds, interest rates and currencies, but they can also be other derivatives, which adds another layer of complexity to proper valuation. The components of a firm's capital structure, e.g., bonds and stock, can also be considered derivatives, more precisely options, with the underlying being the firm's assets, but this is unusual outside of technical contexts.\n\nFrom the economic point of view, financial derivatives are cash flows that are conditioned stochastically and discounted to present value. The market risk inherent in the underlying asset is attached to the financial derivative through contractual agreements and hence can be traded separately.<ref name=\"ssrn.com\">{{cite ssrn|last1=Koehler|first1=Christian|title=The Relationship between the Complexity of Financial Derivatives and Systemic Risk|pages=10|ssrn=2511541|date=May 31, 2011}}</ref> The underlying asset does not have to be acquired. Derivatives therefore allow the breakup of ownership and participation in the market value of an asset. This also provides a considerable amount of freedom regarding the contract design. That contractual freedom allows derivative designers to modify the participation in the performance of the underlying asset almost arbitrarily. Thus, the participation in the market value of the underlying can be effectively weaker, stronger (leverage effect), or implemented as inverse. Hence, specifically the market price risk of the underlying asset can be controlled in almost every situation.<ref name=\"ssrn.com\"/>\n\nThere are two groups of derivative contracts: the privately traded [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC) derivatives such as [[swap (finance)|swaps]] that do not go through an exchange or other intermediary, and [[Exchange-traded derivative contract|exchange-traded derivatives]] (ETD) that are traded through specialized [[derivatives exchange]]s or other exchanges.\n\nDerivatives are more common in the modern era, but their origins trace back several centuries. One of the oldest derivatives is rice futures, which have been traded on the [[Dojima Rice Exchange]] since the eighteenth century.<ref name=\"Rice_FT\">{{cite news\n| url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d9f45d80-6922-11da-bd30-0000779e2340.html\n| date = December 10, 2005\n| title = Sensitive politics over Japan's staple crop delays rice futures plan\n|author1=Kaori Suzuki |author2=David Turner | work = [[The Financial Times]].\n| accessdate = October 23, 2010\n}}</ref> Derivatives are broadly categorized by the relationship between the underlying asset and the derivative (such as [[forward contract|forward]], [[option (finance)|option]], [[swap (finance)|swap]]); the type of underlying asset (such as [[equity derivative]]s, [[foreign exchange derivative]]s, [[interest rate derivative]]s, commodity derivatives, or [[credit derivative]]s); the market in which they trade (such as exchange-traded or [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]]); and their pay-off profile.\n\nDerivatives may broadly be categorized as \"lock\" or \"option\" products. Lock products (such as [[swap (finance)|swap]]s, [[futures contract|futures]], or forwards) obligate the contractual parties to the terms over the life of the contract. [[Option (finance)|Option]] products (such as [[interest rate swaps]]) provide the buyer the right, but not the obligation to enter the contract under the terms specified.\n\nDerivatives can be used either for risk management (i.e. to \"hedge\" by providing offsetting compensation in case of an undesired event, a kind of \"insurance\") or for speculation (i.e. making a financial \"bet\"). This distinction is important because the former is a prudent aspect of operations and financial management for many firms across many industries; the latter offers managers and investors a risky opportunity to increase profit, which may not be properly disclosed to stakeholders.\n\nAlong with many other financial products and services, derivatives reform is an element of the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] of 2010. The Act delegated many rule-making details of regulatory oversight to the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC) and those details are not finalized nor fully implemented as of late 2012.\n\n==Size of market==\nTo give an idea of the size of the derivative market, ''[[The Economist]]'' has reported that as of June 2011, the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market amounted to approximately $700 trillion, and the size of the market traded on exchanges totaled an additional $83 trillion.<ref>{{cite news | title = Clear and Present Danger; Centrally cleared derivatives.(clearing houses) | work = The Economist | date = April 12, 2012  | accessdate = May 10, 2013 | url = http://www.economist.com/node/21552217  | publisher = Economist Newspaper Ltd.{{Subscription required}} }}</ref>  For the fourth quarter 2017 the [[European Securities and Markets Authority|European Securities Market Authority]] estimated the size of European [[derivatives market]] at a size of \u20ac660 trillion with 74 million outstanding contracts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-data-analysis-values-eu-derivatives-market-%E2%82%AC660-trillion-central-clearing|title=ESMA data analysis values EU derivatives market at \u20ac660 trillion with central clearing increasing significantly|website=www.esma.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref>\n\nHowever, these are \"notional\" values, and some economists say that these aggregated values greatly exaggerate the market value and the true credit risk faced by the parties involved. For example, in 2010, while the aggregate of OTC derivatives exceeded $600 trillion, the value of the market was estimated to be much lower, at $21 trillion.  The credit-risk equivalent of the derivative contracts was estimated at $3.3 trillion.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Liu |first1= Qiao |authorlink1= |last2= Lejot |first2= Paul |authorlink2= |others= Douglas W.

Based upon movements in the underlying asset over time, however, the value of the contract will fluctuate, and the derivative may be either an asset (i.e., \"[[in the money]]\") or a liability (i.e., \"[[out of the money]]\") at different points throughout its life. Importantly, either party is therefore exposed to the credit quality of its [[counterparty]] and is interested in protecting itself in an [[event of default]].\n\nOption products have immediate value at the outset because they provide specified protection ([[intrinsic value (finance)|intrinsic value]]) over a given time period ([[Option time value|time value]]). One common form of option product familiar to many consumers is insurance for homes and automobiles. The insured would pay more for a policy with greater liability protections (intrinsic value) and one that extends for a year rather than six months (time value).  Because of the immediate option value, the option purchaser typically pays an up front premium. Just like for lock products, movements in the underlying asset will cause the option's intrinsic value to change over time while its time value deteriorates steadily until the contract expires. An important difference between a lock product is that, after the initial exchange, the option purchaser has no further liability to its counterparty; upon maturity, the purchaser will execute the option if it has positive value (i.e., if it is \"in the money\") or expire at no cost (other than to the initial premium) (i.e., if the option is \"out of the money\").\n\n===Hedging===\n{{Main|Hedge (finance)}}\n\nDerivatives allow risk related to the price of the underlying asset to be transferred from one party to another. For example, a [[wheat]] farmer and a [[miller]] could sign a [[futures contract]] to exchange a specified amount of cash for a specified amount of wheat in the future. Both parties have reduced a future risk: for the wheat farmer, the uncertainty of the price, and for the miller, the availability of wheat. However, there is still the risk that no wheat will be available because of events unspecified by the contract, such as the weather, or that one party will [[Revocation|renege]] on the contract. Although a third party, called a [[clearing house (finance)|clearing house]], insures a futures contract, not all derivatives are insured against counter-party risk.\n\nFrom another perspective, the farmer and the miller both reduce a risk and acquire a risk when they sign the futures contract: the farmer reduces the risk that the price of wheat will fall below the price specified in the contract and acquires the risk that the price of wheat will rise above the price specified in the contract (thereby losing additional income that he could have earned). The miller, on the other hand, acquires the risk that the price of wheat will fall below the price specified in the contract (thereby paying more in the future than he otherwise would have) and reduces the risk that the price of wheat will rise above the price specified in the contract. In this sense, one party is the insurer (risk taker) for one type of risk, and the counter-party is the insurer (risk taker) for another type of risk.\n\nHedging also occurs when an individual or institution buys an asset (such as a commodity, a bond that has [[coupon (bond)|coupon payments]], a stock that pays dividends, and so on) and sells it using a futures contract. The individual or institution has access to the asset for a specified amount of time, and can then sell it in the future at a specified price according to the futures contract. Of course, this allows the individual or institution the benefit of holding the asset, while reducing the risk that the future selling price will deviate unexpectedly from the market's current assessment of the future value of the asset.\n[[File:Chicago bot.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Derivatives traders at the [[Chicago Board of Trade]]]]\n\nDerivatives trading of this kind may serve the financial interests of certain particular businesses.<ref>Peterson, Sam (2010), [https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/07/theres-a-derivative-in-your-cereal/60582 \"There's a Derivative in Your Cereal\"], ''The Atlantic''.</ref> For example, a corporation borrows a large sum of money at a specific interest rate.<ref>Chisolm, Derivatives Demystified (Wiley 2004)</ref> The interest rate on the loan reprices every six months. The corporation is concerned that the rate of interest may be much higher in six months. The corporation could buy a [[forward rate agreement]] (FRA), which is a contract to pay a fixed rate of interest six months after purchases on a [[notional amount]] of money.<ref>Chisolm, ''Derivatives Demystified'' (Wiley 2004) Notional sum means there is no actual principal.</ref> If the interest rate after six months is above the contract rate, the seller will pay the difference to the corporation, or FRA buyer. If the rate is lower, the corporation will pay the difference to the seller. The purchase of the FRA serves to reduce the uncertainty concerning the rate increase and stabilize earnings.\n\n===Speculation and arbitrage===\nDerivatives can be used to acquire risk, rather than to hedge against risk. Thus, some individuals and institutions will enter into a derivative contract to speculate on the value of the underlying asset, betting that the party seeking insurance will be wrong about the future value of the underlying asset. Speculators look to buy an asset in the future at a low price according to a derivative contract when the future market price is high, or to sell an asset in the future at a high price according to a derivative contract when the future market price is less.\n\nIndividuals and institutions may also look for [[arbitrage]] opportunities, as when the current buying price of an asset falls below the price specified in a futures contract to sell the asset.\n\nSpeculative trading in derivatives gained a great deal of notoriety in 1995 when [[Nick Leeson]], a trader at [[Barings Bank]], made poor and unauthorized investments in futures contracts. Through a combination of poor judgment, lack of oversight by the bank's management and regulators, and unfortunate events like the [[Kobe earthquake]], Leeson incurred a $1.3 billion loss that bankrupted the centuries-old institution.<ref name=\"lee\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/375259.stm \"How Leeson broke the bank\"], ''BBC Economy''</ref>\n\n===Proportion used for hedging and speculation===\nThe true proportion of derivatives contracts used for hedging purposes is unknown,<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Sergey Chernenko|author2=Michael Faulkender|title=The Two Sides of Derivatives Usage: Hedging and Speculating with Interest Rate Swaps|journal=The Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis|date=December 2011|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1727\u20131754|doi=10.1017/S0022109011000391|citeseerx=10.1.1.422.7302}}</ref> but it appears to be relatively small.<ref>Knowledge@Wharton (2012).

Products such as [[swap (finance)|swaps]], [[forward rate agreement]]s, [[exotic option]]s \u2013 and other [[exotic derivative]]s \u2013 are almost always traded in this way. The OTC derivative market is the largest market for derivatives, and is largely unregulated with respect to disclosure of information between the parties, since the OTC market is made up of banks and other highly sophisticated parties, such as [[hedge fund]]s.  Reporting of OTC amounts is difficult because trades can occur in private, without activity being visible on any exchange.\n\nAccording to the [[Bank for International Settlements]], who first surveyed OTC derivatives in 1995,<ref name=BIS2007>{{cite report |author1=Ryan Stever |author2=Christian Upper |author3=Goetz von Peter |title= BIS Quarterly Review |publisher=Bank for International Settlements |date=December 2007 |url=http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt0712.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> reported that the \"[[gross market value]], which represent the cost of replacing all open contracts at the prevailing market prices,&nbsp;... increased by 74% since 2004, to $11 trillion at the end of June 2007 (BIS 2007:24).\"<ref name=\"BIS2007\" /> [[Position (finance)|Positions]] in the OTC derivatives market increased to $516 trillion at the end of June 2007, 135% higher than the level recorded in 2004.

''See also [http://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy1111.htm Prior Period Regular OTC Derivatives Market Statistics]''.</ref>  Of this total notional amount, 67% are [[interest rate derivative|interest rate contracts]], 8% are [[Credit default swap|credit default swaps (CDS)]], 9% are foreign exchange contracts, 2% are commodity contracts, 1% are equity contracts, and 12% are other.  Because OTC derivatives are not traded on an exchange, there is no central counter-party. Therefore, they are subject to [[Credit risk#Counterparty risk|counterparty risk]], like an ordinary [[contract]], since each counter-party relies on the other to perform.\n\n===Exchange-traded derivatives===\n[[Exchange-traded derivative contract|Exchange-traded derivatives]] (ETD) are those derivatives instruments that are traded via specialized [[derivatives exchange]]s or other exchanges. A derivatives exchange is a market where individuals trade standardized contracts that have been defined by the exchange.<ref name=\"hull\" /> A derivatives exchange acts as an intermediary to all related transactions, and takes [[initial margin]] from both sides of the trade to act as a guarantee.

According to BIS, the combined turnover in the world's derivatives exchanges totaled US$344 trillion during Q4 2005. By December 2007 the [[Bank for International Settlements]] reported<ref name=\"BIS2007\" /> that \"derivatives traded on exchanges surged 27% to a record $681 trillion.\"<ref name=\"BIS2007\" />\n\n===Inverse ETFs and leveraged ETFs===\n{{Main|Exchange-traded fund}}\n[[Inverse exchange-traded fund|Inverse exchange-traded funds (IETFs)]] and [[Leveraged exchange-traded funds|leveraged exchange-traded funds (LETFs)]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/102815/are-etfs-considered-derivatives.asp|title=Are ETFs Considered Derivatives?|last=Morris|first=Jason|website=Investopedia|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> are two special types of exchange traded funds (ETFs) that are available to common traders and investors on major exchanges like the NYSE and Nasdaq. To maintain these products' [[net asset value]], these funds' administrators must employ more sophisticated [[financial engineering]] methods than what's usually required for maintenance of traditional ETFs. These instruments must also be regularly [[Rebalancing|rebalanced]] and re-indexed each day.\n\n===Common derivative contract===\nSome of the common variants of derivative contracts are as follows:\n# [[Forward contract|Forwards]]: A tailored contract between two parties, where payment takes place at a specific time in the future at today's pre-determined price.\n# [[Futures contract|Futures]]: are [[contract]]s to buy or sell an asset on a future date at a price specified today. A futures contract differs from a forward contract in that the futures contract is a standardized contract written by a [[clearing house (finance)|clearing house]] that operates an exchange where the contract can be bought and sold; the forward contract is a non-standardized contract written by the parties themselves.\n# [[Option (finance)|Options]] are contracts that give the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy (in the case of a [[call option]]) or sell (in the case of a [[put option]]) an asset. The price at which the sale takes place is known as the [[strike price]], and is specified at the time the parties enter into the option. The option contract also specifies a maturity date. In the case of a [[European option]], the owner has the right to require the sale to take place on (but not before) the maturity date; in the case of an [[American option]], the owner can require the sale to take place at any time up to the maturity date. If the owner of the contract exercises this right, the counter-party has the obligation to carry out the transaction. Options are of two types: [[call option]] and [[put option]]. The buyer of a call option has a right to buy a certain quantity of the underlying asset, at a specified price on or before a given date in the future, but he has no obligation to carry out this right. Similarly, the buyer of a put option has the right to sell a certain quantity of an underlying asset, at a specified price on or before a given date in the future, but he has no obligation to carry out this right.\n# [[Binary option]]s are contracts that provide the owner with an all-or-nothing profit profile.\n# [[Warrant (finance)|Warrants]]: Apart from the commonly used short-dated options which have a maximum maturity period of one year, there exist certain long-dated options as well, known as [[Warrant (finance)|warrants]]. These are generally traded over the counter.\n# [[Swap (finance)|Swaps]] are contracts to exchange cash (flows) on or before a specified future date based on the underlying value of currencies exchange rates, bonds/interest rates, [[commodities exchange]], stocks or other assets. Another term which is commonly associated with ''swap'' is ''[[swaption]]'', a term for what is basically an option on the forward swap. Similar to call and put options, swaptions are of two kinds: ''receiver'' and ''payer''. In the case of a receiver swaption there is an option wherein one can receive fixed and pay floating; in the case of a payer swaption one has the option to pay fixed and receive floating.\n::Swaps can basically be categorized into two types: \n::*[[Interest rate swap]]: These basically necessitate swapping only interest associated cash flows in the same currency, between two parties.\n::*[[Currency swap]]: In this kind of swapping, the cash flow between the two parties includes both principal and interest.

The CDO is \"sliced\" into [[tranche|\"tranches\"]], which \"catch\" the cash flow of interest and principal payments in sequence based on seniority.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Koehler| first1=Christian| title=The Relationship between the Complexity of Financial Derivatives and Systemic Risk |journal=Working Paper| pages=17|ssrn= 2511541| date=May 31, 2011}}</ref>  If some loans default and the cash collected by the CDO is insufficient to pay all of its investors, those in the lowest, most \"junior\" tranches suffer losses first. The last to lose payment from default are the safest, most senior tranches. Consequently, [[coupon (bond)|coupon]] payments (and interest rates) vary by tranche with the safest/most senior tranches paying the lowest and the lowest tranches paying the highest rates to compensate for higher [[default risk]].  As an example, a CDO might issue the following tranches in order of safeness: Senior AAA (sometimes known as \"super senior\"); Junior AAA; AA; A; BBB; Residual.<ref name=\"Lemke 2014\">Lemke, Lins and Smith, ''Regulation of Investment Companies'' (Matthew Bender, 2014 ed.).</ref>\n\nSeparate [[Special-purpose entity|special-purpose entities]]\u2014rather than the parent [[investment bank]]\u2014issue the CDOs and pay interest to investors.

The buyer of the CDS makes a series of payments (the CDS \"fee\" or \"spread\") to the seller and, in exchange, receives a payoff if the loan defaults. It was invented by [[Blythe Masters]]  from [[J.P. Morgan & Co.|JP Morgan]] in 1994.\nIn the event of default the buyer of the CDS receives compensation (usually the [[face value]] of the loan), and the seller of the CDS takes possession of the defaulted loan.  However, anyone with sufficient collateral to trade with a bank or hedge fund can purchase a CDS, even buyers who do not hold the loan instrument and who have no direct [[insurable interest]] in the loan (these are called \"naked\" CDSs). If there are more CDS contracts outstanding than bonds in existence, a protocol exists to hold a [[Credit default swap#Auctions|credit event auction]]; the payment received is usually substantially less than the face value of the loan.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/01/05/779501/why-do-they-exist |title=Credit event auctions: Why do they exist? |work= FT Alphaville |author = Lisa Pollack |date=January 5, 2012 }}</ref>\nCredit default swaps have existed since the early 1990s, and increased in use after 2003.

A CDS can be unsecured (without collateral) and be at higher risk for a default.\n\n===Forwards===\nIn finance, a '''forward contract''' or simply a '''forward''' is a non-standardized contract between two parties to buy or to sell an asset at a specified future time at an amount agreed upon today, making it a type of derivative instrument.<ref name=\"hull\">{{cite book|first1=John C. |last1=Hull |title=Options, Futures and another Derivatives |edition=6th |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=New Jersey |year=2006 |isbn=978-0131499089}}</ref><ref>[http://chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/understanding_derivatives/index.cfm \"Understanding Derivatives: Markets and Infrastructure\"], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]]</ref>  This is in contrast to a [[spot contract]], which is an agreement to buy or sell an asset on its spot date, which may vary depending on the instrument, for example most of the FX contracts have Spot Date two business days from today.  The party agreeing to buy the underlying asset in the future assumes a [[long position]], and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future assumes a [[short position]]. The price agreed upon is called the [[delivery price]], which is equal to the [[forward price]] at the time the contract is entered into.\nThe price of the underlying instrument, in whatever form, is paid before control of the instrument changes. This is one of the many forms of buy/sell orders where the time and date of trade is not the same as the [[value date]] where the [[Security (finance)|securities]] themselves are exchanged.\n\nThe [[forward price]] of such a contract is commonly contrasted with the [[spot price]], which is the price at which the asset changes hands on the [[spot date]]. The difference between the spot and the forward price is the [[forward premium]] or forward discount, generally considered in the form of a [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], or loss, by the purchasing party. Forwards, like other derivative securities, can be used to [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] risk (typically currency or exchange rate risk), as a means of [[speculation]], or to allow a party to take advantage of a quality of the underlying instrument which is time-sensitive.\n\nA closely related contract is a [[futures contract]]; they [[Futures contract#Futures versus forwards|differ in certain respects]]. Forward contracts are very similar to futures contracts, except they are not exchange-traded, or defined on standardized assets.<ref>[[Wikinvest:Forward Contract|Forward Contract on Wikinvest]]</ref> Forwards also typically have no interim partial settlements or \"true-ups\" in margin requirements like futures\u2014such that the parties do not exchange additional property securing the party at gain and the entire unrealized gain or loss builds up while the contract is open. However, being traded [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over the counter]] (OTC), forward contracts specification can be customized and may include mark-to-market and daily margin calls. Hence, a forward contract arrangement might call for the loss party to pledge collateral or additional collateral to better secure the party at gain.{{Clarify|date=November 2009}}  In other words, the terms of the forward contract will determine the collateral calls based upon certain \"trigger\" events relevant to a particular counterparty such as among other things, credit ratings, value of assets under management or redemptions over a specific time frame (e.g., quarterly, annually).\n\n===Futures===\nIn [[finance]], a 'futures contract' (more colloquially, '''futures''') is a standardized [[contract]] between two parties to buy or sell a specified asset of standardized quantity and quality for a price agreed upon today (the ''futures price'') with delivery and payment occurring at a specified future date, the ''delivery date'', making it a derivative product (i.e. a financial product that is derived from an underlying asset). The contracts are negotiated at a [[futures exchange]], which acts as an intermediary between buyer and seller. The party agreeing to buy the underlying asset in the future, the \"buyer\" of the contract, is said to be \"[[Long (finance)|long]]\", and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future, the \"seller\" of the contract, is said to be \"[[Short (finance)|short]]\".\n\nWhile the futures contract specifies a trade taking place in the future, the purpose of the futures exchange is to act as intermediary and mitigate the risk of default by either party in the intervening period. For this reason, the futures exchange requires both parties to put up an initial amount of cash (performance bond), the [[Futures contract#Margin|margin]]. Margins, sometimes set as a percentage of the value of the futures contract, need to be proportionally maintained at all times during the life of the contract to underpin this mitigation because the price of the contract will vary in keeping with supply and demand and will change daily and thus one party or the other will theoretically be making or losing money. To mitigate risk and the possibility of default by either party, the product is marked to market on a daily basis whereby the difference between the prior agreed-upon price and the actual daily futures price is settled on a daily basis. This is sometimes known as the variation margin where the futures exchange will draw money out of the losing party's margin account and put it into the other party's thus ensuring that the correct daily loss or profit is reflected in the respective account. If the margin account goes below a certain value set by the Exchange, then a margin call is made and the account owner must replenish the margin account. This process is known as \"marking to market\". Thus on the delivery date, the amount exchanged is not the specified price on the contract but the [[spot price|spot value]] (i.e., the original value agreed upon, since any gain or loss has already been previously settled by marking to market). Upon marketing the strike price is often reached and creates lots of income for the \"caller\".\n\nA closely related contract is a [[forward contract]]. A forward is like a futures in that it specifies the exchange of goods for a specified price at a specified future date. However, a forward is not traded on an exchange and thus does not have the interim partial payments due to marking to market. Nor is the contract standardized, as on the exchange.\nUnlike an [[option (finance)|option]], both parties of a futures contract must fulfill the contract on the delivery date. The seller delivers the underlying asset to the buyer, or, if it is a cash-settled futures contract, then cash is transferred from the futures trader who sustained a loss to the one who made a profit. To exit the commitment prior to the settlement date, the holder of a futures [[position (finance)|position]] can close out its contract obligations by taking the opposite position on another futures contract on the same asset and settlement date. The difference in futures prices is then a profit or loss..\n\n===Mortgage-backed securities===\nA '''mortgage-backed security''' ('''MBS''') is an [[asset-backed security]] that is secured by a [[mortgage]], or more commonly a collection (\"pool\") of sometimes hundreds of [[mortgage loan|mortgages]]. The mortgages are sold to a group of individuals (a government agency or investment bank) that \"[[securitization|securitizes]]\", or packages, the loans together into a security that can be sold to investors. The mortgages of an MBS may be [[Residential mortgage-backed security|residential]] or [[Commercial mortgage-backed security|commercial]], depending on whether it is an Agency MBS or a Non-Agency MBS; in the United States they may be issued by structures set up by [[government-sponsored enterprise]]s like [[Fannie Mae]] or [[Freddie Mac]], or they can be \"private-label\", issued by structures set up by investment banks. The structure of the MBS may be known as \"pass-through\", where the interest and principal payments from the borrower or homebuyer pass through it to the MBS holder, or it may be more complex, made up of a pool of other MBSs. Other types of MBS include [[collateralized mortgage obligation]]s (CMOs, often structured as real estate mortgage investment conduits) and [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs).<ref>Lemke, Lins and Picard, ''Mortgage-Backed Securities'', Chapters 4 and 5 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.).</ref>\n\nThe shares of subprime MBSs issued by various structures, such as CMOs, are not identical but rather issued as [[tranche]]s (French for \"slices\"), each with a different level of priority in the debt repayment stream, giving them different levels of risk and reward. Tranches\u2014especially the lower-priority, higher-interest tranches\u2014of an MBS are/were often further repackaged and resold as collaterized debt obligations.<ref>Josh Clark, [http://www.howstuffworks.com/mortgage-backed-security.htm \"How can mortgage-backed securities bring down the U.S. economy?\"], How Stuff Works</ref> These subprime MBSs issued by investment banks were a major issue in the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] of 2006\u20132008\n.\nThe total face value of an MBS decreases over time, because like mortgages, and unlike [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and most other fixed-income securities, the [[Debt|principal]] in an MBS is not paid back as a single payment to the bond holder at maturity but rather is paid along with the interest in each periodic payment (monthly, quarterly, etc.). This decrease in face value is measured by the MBS's \"factor\", the percentage of the original \"face\" that remains to be repaid.\n\n===Options===\nIn [[finance]], an '''option''' is a contract which gives the ''buyer'' (the owner) the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an [[underlying]] asset or [[financial instrument|instrument]] at a specified [[strike price]] on or before a specified [[expiration (options)|date]]. The ''seller'' has the corresponding obligation to fulfill the transaction\u2014that is to sell or buy\u2014if the buyer (owner) \"exercises\" the option. The buyer pays a premium to the seller for this right. An option that conveys to the owner the right to buy something at a certain price is a \"[[call option]]\"; an option that conveys the right of the owner to sell something at a certain price is a \"[[put option]]\". Both are commonly traded, but for clarity, the call option is more frequently discussed.\nOptions valuation is a topic of ongoing research in academic and practical finance. In basic terms, the value of an option is commonly decomposed into two parts:\n* The first part is the \"intrinsic value\", defined as the difference between the market value of the [[underlying]] and the strike price of the given option.\n* The second part is the \"time value\", which depends on a set of other factors which, through a multivariable, non-linear interrelationship, reflect the [[discounted]] [[expected value]] of that difference at expiration.\n\nAlthough options valuation has been studied since the 19th century, the contemporary approach is based on the [[Black\u2013Scholes model]], which was first published in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=Benhamou |title= Options pre-Black Scholes |url= http://www.ericbenhamou.net/documents/Encyclo/Pre%20Black-Scholes.pdf }}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last =Black |first= Fischer |first2= Myron |last2=Scholes |year=1973 |title=The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities |journal =[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=81 |issue=3 |pages=637\u2013654 |jstor=1831029 |doi=10.1086/260062}}</ref>\n\nOptions contracts have been known for many centuries. However, both trading activity and academic interest increased when, as from 1973, options were issued with standardized terms and traded through a guaranteed clearing house at the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]]. Today, many options are created in a standardized form and traded through clearing houses on regulated [[Exchange (organized market)|options exchanges]], while other [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] options are written as bilateral, customized contracts between a single buyer and seller, one or both of which may be a dealer or market-maker. Options are part of a larger class of financial instruments known as [[derivative products]] or simply derivatives.<ref name=\"hull\"/><ref>{{Citation\n|last=Brealey\n|first=Richard A.\n|author-link=Richard A.

The benefits in question depend on the type of financial instruments involved. For example, in the case of a swap involving two [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], the benefits in question can be the periodic interest ([[Coupon (bond)|coupon]]) payments associated with such bonds. Specifically, two counterparties agree to the exchange one stream of [[cash flow]]s against another stream. These streams are called the swap's \"legs\". The swap agreement defines the dates when the cash flows are to be paid and the way they are [[Accrual|accrued]] and calculated. Usually at the time when the contract is initiated, at least one of these series of cash flows is determined by an uncertain variable such as a [[floating interest rate]], [[foreign exchange rate]], equity price, or commodity price.<ref name=\"hull\"/>\n\nThe cash flows are calculated over a [[notional principal amount]]. Contrary to a [[futures contract|future]], a [[forward contract|forward]] or an [[option (finance)|option]], the notional amount is usually not exchanged between counterparties. Consequently, swaps can be in cash or [[collateral (finance)|collateral]].\nSwaps can be used to [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] certain risks such as [[interest rate risk]], or to [[speculation|speculate]] on changes in the expected direction of underlying prices.\n\nSwaps were first introduced to the public in 1981 when [[IBM]] and the [[World Bank]] entered into a swap agreement.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Corporate Finance |edition=9th | last1=Ross |last2=Westerfield |last3=Jordan |year=2010 |publisher=[[McGraw Hill]] |location= |isbn= |page=746 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> Today, swaps are among the most heavily traded financial contracts in the world: the total amount of interest rates and currency swaps outstanding is more than $348 trillion in 2010, according to the [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The five generic types of swaps, in order of their quantitative importance, are: [[interest rate swap]]s, [[currency swap]]s, credit swaps, [[commodity swap]]s and [[equity swap]]s (there are many other types).\n\n==Economic function of the derivative market==\nSome of the salient economic functions of the derivative market include:\n# Prices in a structured [[derivative market]] not only replicate the discernment of the market participants about the future but also lead the prices of [[underlying]] to the professed future level. On the expiration of the [[derivative contract]], the prices of derivatives congregate with the prices of the underlying.  Therefore, derivatives are essential tools to determine both current and future prices.\n# The derivatives market reallocates risk from the people who prefer [[risk aversion]] to the people who have an appetite for risk.\n# The intrinsic nature of derivatives market associates them to the underlying [[spot market]]. Due to derivatives there is a considerable increase in trade volumes of the underlying spot market. The dominant factor behind such an escalation is increased participation by additional players who would not have otherwise participated due to absence of any procedure to transfer risk.\n# As supervision, reconnaissance of the activities of various participants becomes tremendously difficult in assorted markets; the establishment of an organized form of market becomes all the more imperative. Therefore, in the presence of an organized derivatives market, [[speculation]] can be controlled, resulting in a more meticulous environment.\n# Third parties can use publicly available derivative prices as educated predictions of uncertain future outcomes, for example, the likelihood that a corporation will default on its debts.\nIn a nutshell, there is a substantial increase in savings and investment in the long run due to augmented activities by derivative [[market participant]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Currency Derivatives: A Beginner's Module|url=http://www.nseindia.com/education/content/module_ncfm.htm}}</ref>\n\n==Valuation==\n[[File:Total world wealth vs total world derivatives 1998-2007.gif|thumb|450px|Total world derivatives from 1998 to 2007<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/statistics/derstats.htm |title=Bis.org |publisher=Bis.org |date=May 7, 2010 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> compared to total world wealth in the year 2000<ref>{{cite web | title = Launch of the WIDER study on The World Distribution of Household Wealth: 5 December 2006 | url=http://www.wider.unu.edu/events/past-events/2006-events/en_GB/05-12-2006/ | accessdate = June 9, 2009}}</ref>]]\n\n===Market and arbitrage-free prices===\nTwo common measures of value are:\n* [[Market price]], i.e. the price at which traders are willing to buy or sell the contract\n* [[Arbitrage]]-free price, meaning that no risk-free profits can be made by trading in these contracts (see ''[[rational pricing]]'')\n\n===Determining the market price===\nFor exchange-traded derivatives, market price is usually transparent (often published in real time by the exchange, based on all the current bids and offers placed on that particular contract at any one time). Complications can arise with OTC or floor-traded contracts though, as trading is handled manually, making it difficult to automatically broadcast prices. In particular with OTC contracts, there is no central exchange to collate and disseminate prices.\n\n===Determining the arbitrage-free price===\n{{seealso|List of finance topics#Derivatives pricing}}\nThe arbitrage-free price for a derivatives contract can be complex, and there are many different variables to consider. Arbitrage-free pricing is a central topic of [[financial mathematics]]. For futures/forwards the arbitrage free price is relatively straightforward, involving the price of the underlying together with the cost of carry (income received less interest costs), although there can be complexities.\n\nHowever, for options and more complex derivatives, pricing involves developing a complex pricing model: understanding the [[stochastic process]] of the price of the underlying asset is often crucial. A key equation for the theoretical [[valuation of options]] is the [[Black\u2013Scholes formula]], which is based on the assumption that the cash flows from a European stock [[Option (finance)|option]] can be replicated by a continuous buying and selling strategy using only the stock. A simplified version of this valuation technique is the [[binomial options model]].\n\nOTC represents the biggest challenge in using models to price derivatives. Since these contracts are not publicly traded, no market price is available to validate the theoretical valuation. Most of the model's results are input-dependent (meaning the final price depends heavily on how we derive the pricing inputs).<ref>{{cite web |last=Boumlouka |first=Makrem  |title=Alternatives in OTC Pricing |work=Hedge Funds Review |date=October 30, 2009 |url=http://www.hedgefundsreview.com/hedge-funds-review/news/1560286/otc-pricing-deal-struck-fitch-solutions-pricing-partners}}</ref>\nTherefore, it is common that OTC derivatives are priced by Independent Agents that both counterparties involved in the deal designate upfront (when signing the contract).\n\n==Criticisms==\nDerivatives are often subject to the following criticisms:\n\n=== Hidden tail risk ===\nAccording to [[Raghuram Rajan]], a former chief economist of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), \"...&nbsp;it may well be that the managers of these firms [investment funds] have figured out the correlations between the various instruments they hold and believe they are hedged. Yet as Chan and others (2005) point out, the lessons of summer 1998 following the default on Russian government debt is that correlations that are zero or negative in normal times can turn overnight to one \u2013 a phenomenon they term \"phase lock-in\". A hedged position \"can become unhedged at the worst times, inflicting substantial losses on those who mistakenly believe they are protected\".<ref>{{cite journal\n  | author = Raghuram G.

Derivatives allow [[investor]]s to earn large returns from small movements in the underlying asset's price. However, investors could lose large amounts if the price of the underlying moves against them significantly. There have been several instances of massive losses in derivative markets, such as the following:\n\n:* [[American International Group]] (AIG) lost more than US$18 billion through a subsidiary over the preceding three quarters on [[credit default swap]]s (CDSs).<ref>{{cite news|last=Kelleher |first=James B.|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN1837154020080918 |title=\"Buffett's Time Bomb Goes Off on Wall Street\" by James B.

Different types of derivatives have different levels of counter party risk. For example, standardized stock options by law require the party at risk to have a certain amount deposited with the exchange, showing that they can pay for any losses; banks that help businesses swap variable for fixed rates on loans may do credit checks on both parties. However, in private agreements between two companies, for example, there may not be benchmarks for performing due diligence and risk analysis.\n\n===Large notional value===\nDerivatives typically have a '''large notional value'''. As such, there is the danger that their use could result in losses for which the investor would be unable to compensate. The possibility that this could lead to a chain reaction ensuing in an economic crisis was pointed out by famed investor [[Warren Buffett]] in [[Berkshire Hathaway]]'s 2002 annual report. Buffett called them 'financial weapons of mass destruction.' A potential problem with derivatives is that they comprise an increasingly larger notional amount of assets which may lead to distortions in the underlying capital and equities markets themselves. Investors begin to look at the derivatives markets to make a decision to buy or sell securities and so what was originally meant to be a market to transfer risk now becomes a leading indicator.[http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2002ar/2002ar.pdf (See Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report for 2002)]\n\n==Financial reform and government regulation==\nUnder US law and the laws of most other developed countries, derivatives have special legal exemptions that make them a particularly attractive legal form to extend credit. The strong creditor protections afforded to derivatives counterparties, in combination with their complexity and lack of transparency however, can cause capital markets to underprice credit risk. This can contribute to credit booms, and increase systemic risks. Indeed, the use of derivatives to conceal credit risk from third parties while protecting derivative counterparties contributed to the financial crisis of 2008 in the United States.\n\nIn the context of a 2010 examination of the [[Intercontinental Exchange|ICE Trust]], an industry self-regulatory body, [[Gary Gensler]], the chairman of the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] which regulates most derivatives, was quoted saying that the derivatives marketplace as it functions now \"adds up to higher costs to all Americans\". More oversight of the banks in this market is needed, he also said. Additionally, the report said, \"[t]he [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] is looking into derivatives, too. The department's antitrust unit is actively investigating 'the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the credit derivatives clearing, trading and information services industries', according to a department spokeswoman.\"<ref>Story, Louise, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/business/12advantage.html?hp \"A Secretive Banking Elite Rules Trading in Derivatives\"], ''The New York Times'', December 11, 2010 (December 12, 2010, p. A1 NY ed.). Retrieved December 12, 2010.</ref>\n\nFor legislators and committees responsible for financial reform related to derivatives in the United States and elsewhere, distinguishing between hedging and speculative derivatives activities has been a nontrivial challenge. The distinction is critical because regulation should help to isolate and curtail speculation with derivatives, especially for \"systemically significant\" institutions whose default could be large enough to threaten the entire financial system. At the same time, the legislation should allow for responsible parties to hedge risk without unduly tying up working capital as collateral that firms may better employ elsewhere in their operations and investment.<ref>Zubrod, Luke (2011). The Atlantic. \"Will the 'Cure' for Systemic Risk Kill the Economy?\" https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/06/will-the-cure-for-systemic-risk-kill-the-economy/240600/</ref>  \nIn this regard, it is important to distinguish between financial (e.g. banks) and non-financial end-users of derivatives (e.g. real estate development companies) because these firms' derivatives usage is inherently different. More importantly, the reasonable collateral that secures these different counterparties can be very different. The distinction between these firms is not always straight forward (e.g. hedge funds or even some private equity firms do not neatly fit either category). Finally, even financial users must be differentiated, as 'large' banks may classified as \"systemically significant\" whose derivatives activities must be more tightly monitored and restricted than those of smaller, local and regional banks.\n\nOver-the-counter dealing will be less common as the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] comes into effect. The law mandated the clearing of certain swaps at registered exchanges and imposed various restrictions on derivatives. To implement Dodd-Frank, the [http://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/DoddFrankAct/index.htm CFTC developed new rules in at least 30 areas]. The Commission determines which swaps are subject to mandatory clearing and whether a derivatives exchange is eligible to clear a certain type of swap contract.\n\nNonetheless, the above and other challenges of the rule-making process have delayed full enactment of aspects of the legislation relating to derivatives. The challenges are further complicated by the necessity to orchestrate globalized financial reform among the nations that comprise the world's major financial markets, a primary responsibility of the [[Financial Stability Board]] whose progress is ongoing.<ref>Financial Stability Board (2012).  \"OTC Derivatives Market Reforms Third Progress Report on Implementation\" June 15, 2012 http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_120615.pdf</ref>\n\nIn the U.S., by February 2012 the combined effort of the SEC and CFTC had produced over 70 proposed and final derivatives rules.<ref name=\"lexology1\">{{cite web|author=Proskauer Rose LLP |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=e7db9a60-9fca-449b-850b-b4a32d1e425d |title=SEC and CFTC oversight of derivatives: a status report |publisher=Lexology |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}</ref>  However, both of them had delayed adoption of a number of derivatives regulations because of the burden of other rulemaking, litigation and opposition to the rules, and many core definitions (such as the terms \"swap\", \"security-based swap\", \"swap dealer\", \"security-based swap dealer\", \"major swap participant\" and \"major security-based swap participant\") had still not been adopted.<ref name=\"lexology1\"/>  SEC Chairman [[Mary Schapiro]] opined: \"At the end of the day, it probably does not make sense to harmonize everything [between the SEC and CFTC rules] because some of these products are quite different and certainly the market structures are quite different.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Younglai |first=Rachelle |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2009/06/19/idINIndia-40440620090619 |title=Interview \u2013 Not all SEC, CFTC rules must be harmonized |work=Reuters |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}</ref> On February 11, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released two final rules toward establishing a reporting and public disclosure framework for security-based swap transaction data.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/sec-swap-reporting-and-disclosure.pdf |title= First take: Ten key points from the SEC's swaps reporting and disclosure rules |publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, February 2015}}</ref> The two rules are not completely harmonized with the requirements with CFTC requirements.\n\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev at G20 Pittsburgh summit-1.jpg|thumb|300px|Country leaders at the [[2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit]]]]\nIn November 2012, the SEC and regulators from Australia, Brazil, the European Union, Hong Kong, Japan, Ontario, Quebec, Singapore, and Switzerland met to discuss reforming the OTC derivatives market, as had been agreed by leaders at the [[2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit]] in September 2009.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1365171486526 |title=Joint Press Statement of Leaders on Operating Principles and Areas of Exploration in the Regulation of the Cross-Border OTC Derivatives Market; 2012-251 |publisher=Sec.gov |date=December 4, 2012 |accessdate=March 11, 2016}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> In December 2012, they released a joint statement to the effect that they recognized that the market is a global one and \"firmly support the adoption and enforcement of robust and consistent standards in and across jurisdictions\", with the goals of mitigating risk, improving [[Transparency (market)|transparency]], protecting against [[market abuse]], preventing regulatory gaps, reducing the potential for [[arbitrage]] opportunities, and fostering a [[level playing field]] for market participants.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> They also agreed on the need to reduce regulatory uncertainty and provide market participants with sufficient clarity on laws and regulations by avoiding, to the extent possible, the application of conflicting rules to the same entities and transactions, and minimizing the application of inconsistent and duplicative rules.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>  At the same time, they noted that \"complete harmonization \u2013 perfect alignment of rules across jurisdictions\" would be difficult, because of jurisdictions' differences in law, policy, markets, implementation timing, and legislative and regulatory processes.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nOn December 20, 2013 the CFTC provided information on its swaps regulation \"comparability\" determinations.

The oldest example of a derivative in history, attested to by [[Aristotle]], is thought to be a contract transaction of [[olive]]s, entered into by ancient Greek philosopher [[Thales]], who made a profit in the exchange.<ref>{{cite book |first1=George |last1=Crawford |first2=Bidyut |last2=Sen |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NIIVeirctosC&pg=PA7 |title=Derivatives for Decision Makers: Strategic Management Issues |publisher= John Wiley & Sons |year=1996 |isbn=9780471129943 |accessdate=2016-06-15}}</ref>  [[Bucket shop (stock market)|Bucket shops]], outlawed [[Commodity Exchange Act|in 1936]], are a more recent historical example.\n\n==Basics==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}\n\nDerivatives are contracts between two parties that specify conditions (especially the dates, resulting values and definitions of the underlying variables, the parties' contractual obligations, and the [[notional amount]]) under which payments are to be made between the parties.<ref name=\"hull\"/><ref>{{cite book |last= [[Mark Rubinstein]] |title= Rubinstein on Derivatves|year=1999|publisher=Risk Books |isbn=978-1-899332-53-3}}</ref>  The assets include [[Commodity|commodities]], stocks, bonds, interest rates and currencies, but they can also be other derivatives, which adds another layer of complexity to proper valuation. The components of a firm's capital structure, e.g., bonds and stock, can also be considered derivatives, more precisely options, with the underlying being the firm's assets, but this is unusual outside of technical contexts.\n\nFrom the economic point of view, financial derivatives are cash flows that are conditioned stochastically and discounted to present value. The market risk inherent in the underlying asset is attached to the financial derivative through contractual agreements and hence can be traded separately.<ref name=\"ssrn.com\">{{cite ssrn|last1=Koehler|first1=Christian|title=The Relationship between the Complexity of Financial Derivatives and Systemic Risk|pages=10|ssrn=2511541|date=May 31, 2011}}</ref> The underlying asset does not have to be acquired. Derivatives therefore allow the breakup of ownership and participation in the market value of an asset. This also provides a considerable amount of freedom regarding the contract design. That contractual freedom allows derivative designers to modify the participation in the performance of the underlying asset almost arbitrarily. Thus, the participation in the market value of the underlying can be effectively weaker, stronger (leverage effect), or implemented as inverse. Hence, specifically the market price risk of the underlying asset can be controlled in almost every situation.<ref name=\"ssrn.com\"/>\n\nThere are two groups of derivative contracts: the privately traded [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC) derivatives such as [[swap (finance)|swaps]] that do not go through an exchange or other intermediary, and [[Exchange-traded derivative contract|exchange-traded derivatives]] (ETD) that are traded through specialized [[derivatives exchange]]s or other exchanges.\n\nDerivatives are more common in the modern era, but their origins trace back several centuries. One of the oldest derivatives is rice futures, which have been traded on the [[Dojima Rice Exchange]] since the eighteenth century.<ref name=\"Rice_FT\">{{cite news\n| url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d9f45d80-6922-11da-bd30-0000779e2340.html\n| date = December 10, 2005\n| title = Sensitive politics over Japan's staple crop delays rice futures plan\n|author1=Kaori Suzuki |author2=David Turner | work = [[The Financial Times]].\n| accessdate = October 23, 2010\n}}</ref> Derivatives are broadly categorized by the relationship between the underlying asset and the derivative (such as [[forward contract|forward]], [[option (finance)|option]], [[swap (finance)|swap]]); the type of underlying asset (such as [[equity derivative]]s, [[foreign exchange derivative]]s, [[interest rate derivative]]s, commodity derivatives, or [[credit derivative]]s); the market in which they trade (such as exchange-traded or [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]]); and their pay-off profile.\n\nDerivatives may broadly be categorized as \"lock\" or \"option\" products. Lock products (such as [[swap (finance)|swap]]s, [[futures contract|futures]], or forwards) obligate the contractual parties to the terms over the life of the contract. [[Option (finance)|Option]] products (such as [[interest rate swaps]]) provide the buyer the right, but not the obligation to enter the contract under the terms specified.\n\nDerivatives can be used either for risk management (i.e. to \"hedge\" by providing offsetting compensation in case of an undesired event, a kind of \"insurance\") or for speculation (i.e. making a financial \"bet\"). This distinction is important because the former is a prudent aspect of operations and financial management for many firms across many industries; the latter offers managers and investors a risky opportunity to increase profit, which may not be properly disclosed to stakeholders.\n\nAlong with many other financial products and services, derivatives reform is an element of the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] of 2010. The Act delegated many rule-making details of regulatory oversight to the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC) and those details are not finalized nor fully implemented as of late 2012.\n\n==Size of market==\nTo give an idea of the size of the derivative market, ''[[The Economist]]'' has reported that as of June 2011, the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market amounted to approximately $700 trillion, and the size of the market traded on exchanges totaled an additional $83 trillion.<ref>{{cite news | title = Clear and Present Danger; Centrally cleared derivatives.(clearing houses) | work = The Economist | date = April 12, 2012  | accessdate = May 10, 2013 | url = http://www.economist.com/node/21552217  | publisher = Economist Newspaper Ltd.{{Subscription required}} }}</ref>  For the fourth quarter 2017 the [[European Securities and Markets Authority|European Securities Market Authority]] estimated the size of European [[derivatives market]] at a size of \u20ac660 trillion with 74 million outstanding contracts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-data-analysis-values-eu-derivatives-market-%E2%82%AC660-trillion-central-clearing|title=ESMA data analysis values EU derivatives market at \u20ac660 trillion with central clearing increasing significantly|website=www.esma.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref>\n\nHowever, these are \"notional\" values, and some economists say that these aggregated values greatly exaggerate the market value and the true credit risk faced by the parties involved. For example, in 2010, while the aggregate of OTC derivatives exceeded $600 trillion, the value of the market was estimated to be much lower, at $21 trillion.  The credit-risk equivalent of the derivative contracts was estimated at $3.3 trillion.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Liu |first1= Qiao |authorlink1= |last2= Lejot |first2= Paul |authorlink2= |others= Douglas W.

(2014). \"Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives (9th Edition)\", Pearson, pp.&nbsp;16\u201317. {{ISBN|0133456315}}</ref>\n\n===Mechanics and valuation===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nLock products are theoretically valued at zero at the time of execution and thus do not typically require an up-front exchange between the parties. Based upon movements in the underlying asset over time, however, the value of the contract will fluctuate, and the derivative may be either an asset (i.e., \"[[in the money]]\") or a liability (i.e., \"[[out of the money]]\") at different points throughout its life. Importantly, either party is therefore exposed to the credit quality of its [[counterparty]] and is interested in protecting itself in an [[event of default]].\n\nOption products have immediate value at the outset because they provide specified protection ([[intrinsic value (finance)|intrinsic value]]) over a given time period ([[Option time value|time value]]). One common form of option product familiar to many consumers is insurance for homes and automobiles. The insured would pay more for a policy with greater liability protections (intrinsic value) and one that extends for a year rather than six months (time value).  Because of the immediate option value, the option purchaser typically pays an up front premium. Just like for lock products, movements in the underlying asset will cause the option's intrinsic value to change over time while its time value deteriorates steadily until the contract expires. An important difference between a lock product is that, after the initial exchange, the option purchaser has no further liability to its counterparty; upon maturity, the purchaser will execute the option if it has positive value (i.e., if it is \"in the money\") or expire at no cost (other than to the initial premium) (i.e., if the option is \"out of the money\").\n\n===Hedging===\n{{Main|Hedge (finance)}}\n\nDerivatives allow risk related to the price of the underlying asset to be transferred from one party to another. For example, a [[wheat]] farmer and a [[miller]] could sign a [[futures contract]] to exchange a specified amount of cash for a specified amount of wheat in the future. Both parties have reduced a future risk: for the wheat farmer, the uncertainty of the price, and for the miller, the availability of wheat. However, there is still the risk that no wheat will be available because of events unspecified by the contract, such as the weather, or that one party will [[Revocation|renege]] on the contract. Although a third party, called a [[clearing house (finance)|clearing house]], insures a futures contract, not all derivatives are insured against counter-party risk.\n\nFrom another perspective, the farmer and the miller both reduce a risk and acquire a risk when they sign the futures contract: the farmer reduces the risk that the price of wheat will fall below the price specified in the contract and acquires the risk that the price of wheat will rise above the price specified in the contract (thereby losing additional income that he could have earned). The miller, on the other hand, acquires the risk that the price of wheat will fall below the price specified in the contract (thereby paying more in the future than he otherwise would have) and reduces the risk that the price of wheat will rise above the price specified in the contract. In this sense, one party is the insurer (risk taker) for one type of risk, and the counter-party is the insurer (risk taker) for another type of risk.\n\nHedging also occurs when an individual or institution buys an asset (such as a commodity, a bond that has [[coupon (bond)|coupon payments]], a stock that pays dividends, and so on) and sells it using a futures contract. The individual or institution has access to the asset for a specified amount of time, and can then sell it in the future at a specified price according to the futures contract. Of course, this allows the individual or institution the benefit of holding the asset, while reducing the risk that the future selling price will deviate unexpectedly from the market's current assessment of the future value of the asset.\n[[File:Chicago bot.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Derivatives traders at the [[Chicago Board of Trade]]]]\n\nDerivatives trading of this kind may serve the financial interests of certain particular businesses.<ref>Peterson, Sam (2010), [https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/07/theres-a-derivative-in-your-cereal/60582 \"There's a Derivative in Your Cereal\"], ''The Atlantic''.</ref> For example, a corporation borrows a large sum of money at a specific interest rate.<ref>Chisolm, Derivatives Demystified (Wiley 2004)</ref> The interest rate on the loan reprices every six months. The corporation is concerned that the rate of interest may be much higher in six months. The corporation could buy a [[forward rate agreement]] (FRA), which is a contract to pay a fixed rate of interest six months after purchases on a [[notional amount]] of money.<ref>Chisolm, ''Derivatives Demystified'' (Wiley 2004) Notional sum means there is no actual principal.</ref> If the interest rate after six months is above the contract rate, the seller will pay the difference to the corporation, or FRA buyer. If the rate is lower, the corporation will pay the difference to the seller. The purchase of the FRA serves to reduce the uncertainty concerning the rate increase and stabilize earnings.\n\n===Speculation and arbitrage===\nDerivatives can be used to acquire risk, rather than to hedge against risk. Thus, some individuals and institutions will enter into a derivative contract to speculate on the value of the underlying asset, betting that the party seeking insurance will be wrong about the future value of the underlying asset. Speculators look to buy an asset in the future at a low price according to a derivative contract when the future market price is high, or to sell an asset in the future at a high price according to a derivative contract when the future market price is less.\n\nIndividuals and institutions may also look for [[arbitrage]] opportunities, as when the current buying price of an asset falls below the price specified in a futures contract to sell the asset.\n\nSpeculative trading in derivatives gained a great deal of notoriety in 1995 when [[Nick Leeson]], a trader at [[Barings Bank]], made poor and unauthorized investments in futures contracts. Through a combination of poor judgment, lack of oversight by the bank's management and regulators, and unfortunate events like the [[Kobe earthquake]], Leeson incurred a $1.3 billion loss that bankrupted the centuries-old institution.<ref name=\"lee\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/375259.stm \"How Leeson broke the bank\"], ''BBC Economy''</ref>\n\n===Proportion used for hedging and speculation===\nThe true proportion of derivatives contracts used for hedging purposes is unknown,<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Sergey Chernenko|author2=Michael Faulkender|title=The Two Sides of Derivatives Usage: Hedging and Speculating with Interest Rate Swaps|journal=The Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis|date=December 2011|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1727\u20131754|doi=10.1017/S0022109011000391|citeseerx=10.1.1.422.7302}}</ref> but it appears to be relatively small.<ref>Knowledge@Wharton (2012).

Products such as [[swap (finance)|swaps]], [[forward rate agreement]]s, [[exotic option]]s \u2013 and other [[exotic derivative]]s \u2013 are almost always traded in this way. The OTC derivative market is the largest market for derivatives, and is largely unregulated with respect to disclosure of information between the parties, since the OTC market is made up of banks and other highly sophisticated parties, such as [[hedge fund]]s.  Reporting of OTC amounts is difficult because trades can occur in private, without activity being visible on any exchange.\n\nAccording to the [[Bank for International Settlements]], who first surveyed OTC derivatives in 1995,<ref name=BIS2007>{{cite report |author1=Ryan Stever |author2=Christian Upper |author3=Goetz von Peter |title= BIS Quarterly Review |publisher=Bank for International Settlements |date=December 2007 |url=http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt0712.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> reported that the \"[[gross market value]], which represent the cost of replacing all open contracts at the prevailing market prices,&nbsp;... increased by 74% since 2004, to $11 trillion at the end of June 2007 (BIS 2007:24).\"<ref name=\"BIS2007\" /> [[Position (finance)|Positions]] in the OTC derivatives market increased to $516 trillion at the end of June 2007, 135% higher than the level recorded in 2004.

''See also [http://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy1111.htm Prior Period Regular OTC Derivatives Market Statistics]''.</ref>  Of this total notional amount, 67% are [[interest rate derivative|interest rate contracts]], 8% are [[Credit default swap|credit default swaps (CDS)]], 9% are foreign exchange contracts, 2% are commodity contracts, 1% are equity contracts, and 12% are other.  Because OTC derivatives are not traded on an exchange, there is no central counter-party. Therefore, they are subject to [[Credit risk#Counterparty risk|counterparty risk]], like an ordinary [[contract]], since each counter-party relies on the other to perform.\n\n=== '''Exchange-traded derivatives''' ===\n[[Exchange-traded derivative contract|Exchange-traded derivatives]] (ETD) are those derivatives instruments that are traded via specialized [[derivatives exchange]]s or other exchanges. A derivatives exchange is a market where individuals trade standardized contracts that have been defined by the exchange.<ref name=\"hull\" /> A derivatives exchange acts as an intermediary to all related transactions, and takes [[initial margin]] from both sides of the trade to act as a guarantee. The world's largest<ref name=\"foweek\">''Futures and Options Week'': According to figures published in F&O Week October 10, 2005.

According to BIS, the combined turnover in the world's derivatives exchanges totaled US$344 trillion during Q4 2005. By December 2007 the [[Bank for International Settlements]] reported<ref name=\"BIS2007\" /> that \"derivatives traded on exchanges surged 27% to a record $681 trillion.\"<ref name=\"BIS2007\" />\n\n=== Inverse ETFs and leveraged ETFs ===\n{{Main|Exchange-traded fund}}\n[[Inverse exchange-traded fund|Inverse exchange-traded funds (IETFs)]] and [[Leveraged exchange-traded funds|leveraged exchange-traded funds (LETFs)]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/102815/are-etfs-considered-derivatives.asp|title=Are ETFs Considered Derivatives?|last=Morris|first=Jason|website=Investopedia|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> are two special types of exchange traded funds (ETFs) that are available to common traders and investors on major exchanges like the NYSE and Nasdaq. To maintain these products' [[net asset value]], these funds' administrators must employ more sophisticated [[financial engineering]] methods than what's usually required for maintenance of traditional ETFs. These instruments must also be regularly [[Rebalancing|rebalanced]] and re-indexed each day.\n\n===Common derivative contract===\nSome of the common variants of derivative contracts are as follows:\n# [[Forward contract|Forwards]]: A tailored contract between two parties, where payment takes place at a specific time in the future at today's pre-determined price.\n# [[Futures contract|Futures]]: are [[contract]]s to buy or sell an asset on a future date at a price specified today. A futures contract differs from a forward contract in that the futures contract is a standardized contract written by a [[clearing house (finance)|clearing house]] that operates an exchange where the contract can be bought and sold; the forward contract is a non-standardized contract written by the parties themselves.\n# [[Option (finance)|Options]] are contracts that give the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy (in the case of a [[call option]]) or sell (in the case of a [[put option]]) an asset. The price at which the sale takes place is known as the [[strike price]], and is specified at the time the parties enter into the option. The option contract also specifies a maturity date. In the case of a [[European option]], the owner has the right to require the sale to take place on (but not before) the maturity date; in the case of an [[American option]], the owner can require the sale to take place at any time up to the maturity date. If the owner of the contract exercises this right, the counter-party has the obligation to carry out the transaction. Options are of two types: [[call option]] and [[put option]]. The buyer of a call option has a right to buy a certain quantity of the underlying asset, at a specified price on or before a given date in the future, but he has no obligation to carry out this right. Similarly, the buyer of a put option has the right to sell a certain quantity of an underlying asset, at a specified price on or before a given date in the future, but he has no obligation to carry out this right.\n# [[Binary option]]s are contracts that provide the owner with an all-or-nothing profit profile.\n# [[Warrant (finance)|Warrants]]: Apart from the commonly used short-dated options which have a maximum maturity period of one year, there exist certain long-dated options as well, known as [[Warrant (finance)|warrants]]. These are generally traded over the counter.\n# [[Swap (finance)|Swaps]] are contracts to exchange cash (flows) on or before a specified future date based on the underlying value of currencies exchange rates, bonds/interest rates, [[commodities exchange]], stocks or other assets. Another term which is commonly associated with ''swap'' is ''[[swaption]]'', a term for what is basically an option on the forward swap. Similar to call and put options, swaptions are of two kinds: ''receiver'' and ''payer''. In the case of a receiver swaption there is an option wherein one can receive fixed and pay floating; in the case of a payer swaption one has the option to pay fixed and receive floating.\n::Swaps can basically be categorized into two types: \n::*[[Interest rate swap]]: These basically necessitate swapping only interest associated cash flows in the same currency, between two parties.\n::*[[Currency swap]]: In this kind of swapping, the cash flow between the two parties includes both principal and interest. Also, the money which is being swapped is in different currency for both parties.<ref>{{cite web|title=Financial Markets: A Beginner's Module|url=http://www.nseindia.com/education/content/module_ncfm.htm}}</ref>\nSome common examples of these derivatives are the following:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |UNDERLYING\n! colspan=\"5\" |CONTRACT TYPES\n|-\n!

An \"asset-backed security\" is used as an umbrella term for a type of security backed by a pool of assets\u2014including collateralized debt obligations and [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (Example: \"The capital market in which asset-backed securities are issued and traded is composed of three main categories: ABS, MBS and CDOs\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Vink|first=Dennis| title=ABS, MBS and CDO compared: An empirical analysis|url= http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/10381/2/MPRA_paper_10381.pdf| work=August 2007 |publisher=Munich Personal RePEc Archive|accessdate=July 13, 2013}}</ref>)\u2014and sometimes for a particular type of that security\u2014one backed by consumer loans (example: \"As a rule of thumb, securitization issues backed by mortgages are called MBS, and securitization issues backed by debt obligations are called CDO, [and] Securitization issues backed by consumer-backed products\u2014car loans, consumer loans and credit cards, among others\u2014are called ABS. <ref>{{cite web|last=Vink |first= Dennis| title= ABS, MBS and CDO compared: An empirical analysis| url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/10381/2/MPRA_paper_10381.pdf|work=August 2007| publisher= Munich Personal RePEc Archive |accessdate=July 13, 2013}}; see also {{cite web|title=What are Asset-Backed Securities? |url= http://www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=5&subcatid=16&id=10#sthash.roSaSia3.dpuf| publisher=SIFMA|accessdate=July 13, 2013|quote=Asset-backed securities, called ABS, are bonds or notes backed by financial assets.

The CDO is \"sliced\" into [[tranche|\"tranches\"]], which \"catch\" the cash flow of interest and principal payments in sequence based on seniority.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Koehler| first1=Christian| title=The Relationship between the Complexity of Financial Derivatives and Systemic Risk |journal=Working Paper| pages=17|ssrn= 2511541| date=May 31, 2011}}</ref>  If some loans default and the cash collected by the CDO is insufficient to pay all of its investors, those in the lowest, most \"junior\" tranches suffer losses first. The last to lose payment from default are the safest, most senior tranches. Consequently, [[coupon (bond)|coupon]] payments (and interest rates) vary by tranche with the safest/most senior tranches paying the lowest and the lowest tranches paying the highest rates to compensate for higher [[default risk]].  As an example, a CDO might issue the following tranches in order of safeness: Senior AAA (sometimes known as \"super senior\"); Junior AAA; AA; A; BBB; Residual.<ref name=\"Lemke 2014\">Lemke, Lins and Smith, ''Regulation of Investment Companies'' (Matthew Bender, 2014 ed.).</ref>\n\nSeparate [[Special-purpose entity|special-purpose entities]]\u2014rather than the parent [[investment bank]]\u2014issue the CDOs and pay interest to investors. As CDOs developed, some sponsors repackaged tranches into yet another iteration called \"[[CDO-Squared]]\" or the \"CDOs of CDOs\".<ref name=\"Lemke 2014\"/> \nIn the early 2000s, CDOs were generally diversified,<ref>Bethany McLean and [[Joe Nocera]], ''All the Devils Are Here, the Hidden History of the Financial Crisis'', Portfolio, Penguin, 2010, p.120</ref> but by 2006\u20132007\u2014when the CDO market grew to hundreds of billions of dollars\u2014this changed. CDO collateral became dominated not by loans, but by lower level ([[Credit ratings#Corporate credit ratings|BBB or A]]) tranches recycled from other asset-backed securities, whose assets were usually non-prime mortgages.<ref name=\"FCIR-p127\">[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf \"Final Report of the National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States\"], a.k.a. \"The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report\", p.127</ref> These CDOs have been called \"the engine that powered the mortgage supply chain\" for nonprime mortgages,<ref name=\"FCIR-130\">''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.130</ref> and are credited with giving lenders greater incentive to make non-prime loans<ref name=\"FCIR-133\">''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.133</ref> leading up to the 2007-9 [[subprime mortgage crisis]].\n\n===Credit default swap===\nA '''credit default swap''' ('''CDS''') is a [[Swap (finance)|financial swap]] agreement that the seller of the CDS will compensate the buyer (the creditor of the reference loan) in the event of a loan [[Default (finance)|default]] (by the debtor) or other [[credit event]]. The buyer of the CDS makes a series of payments (the CDS \"fee\" or \"spread\") to the seller and, in exchange, receives a payoff if the loan defaults. It was invented by [[Blythe Masters]]  from [[J.P. Morgan & Co.|JP Morgan]] in 1994.\nIn the event of default the buyer of the CDS receives compensation (usually the [[face value]] of the loan), and the seller of the CDS takes possession of the defaulted loan.  However, anyone with sufficient collateral to trade with a bank or hedge fund can purchase a CDS, even buyers who do not hold the loan instrument and who have no direct [[insurable interest]] in the loan (these are called \"naked\" CDSs). If there are more CDS contracts outstanding than bonds in existence, a protocol exists to hold a [[Credit default swap#Auctions|credit event auction]]; the payment received is usually substantially less than the face value of the loan.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/01/05/779501/why-do-they-exist |title=Credit event auctions: Why do they exist? |work= FT Alphaville |author = Lisa Pollack |date=January 5, 2012 }}</ref>\nCredit default swaps have existed since the early 1990s, and increased in use after 2003.

A CDS can be unsecured (without collateral) and be at higher risk for a default.\n\n===Forwards===\nIn finance, a '''forward contract''' or simply a '''forward''' is a non-standardized contract between two parties to buy or to sell an asset at a specified future time at an amount agreed upon today, making it a type of derivative instrument.<ref name=\"hull\">{{cite book|first1=John C. |last1=Hull |title=Options, Futures and another Derivatives |edition=6th |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=New Jersey |year=2006 |isbn=978-0131499089}}</ref><ref>[http://chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/understanding_derivatives/index.cfm \"Understanding Derivatives: Markets and Infrastructure\"], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]]</ref>  This is in contrast to a [[spot contract]], which is an agreement to buy or sell an asset on its spot date, which may vary depending on the instrument, for example most of the FX contracts have Spot Date two business days from today.  The party agreeing to buy the underlying asset in the future assumes a [[long position]], and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future assumes a [[short position]]. The price agreed upon is called the [[delivery price]], which is equal to the [[forward price]] at the time the contract is entered into.\nThe price of the underlying instrument, in whatever form, is paid before control of the instrument changes. This is one of the many forms of buy/sell orders where the time and date of trade is not the same as the [[value date]] where the [[Security (finance)|securities]] themselves are exchanged.\n\nThe [[forward price]] of such a contract is commonly contrasted with the [[spot price]], which is the price at which the asset changes hands on the [[spot date]]. The difference between the spot and the forward price is the [[forward premium]] or forward discount, generally considered in the form of a [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], or loss, by the purchasing party. Forwards, like other derivative securities, can be used to [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] risk (typically currency or exchange rate risk), as a means of [[speculation]], or to allow a party to take advantage of a quality of the underlying instrument which is time-sensitive.\n\nA closely related contract is a [[futures contract]]; they [[Futures contract#Futures versus forwards|differ in certain respects]]. Forward contracts are very similar to futures contracts, except they are not exchange-traded, or defined on standardized assets.<ref>[[Wikinvest:Forward Contract|Forward Contract on Wikinvest]]</ref> Forwards also typically have no interim partial settlements or \"true-ups\" in margin requirements like futures\u2014such that the parties do not exchange additional property securing the party at gain and the entire unrealized gain or loss builds up while the contract is open. However, being traded [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over the counter]] (OTC), forward contracts specification can be customized and may include mark-to-market and daily margin calls. Hence, a forward contract arrangement might call for the loss party to pledge collateral or additional collateral to better secure the party at gain.{{Clarify|date=November 2009}}  In other words, the terms of the forward contract will determine the collateral calls based upon certain \"trigger\" events relevant to a particular counterparty such as among other things, credit ratings, value of assets under management or redemptions over a specific time frame (e.g., quarterly, annually).\n\n===Futures===\nIn [[finance]], a 'futures contract' (more colloquially, '''futures''') is a standardized [[contract]] between two parties to buy or sell a specified asset of standardized quantity and quality for a price agreed upon today (the ''futures price'') with delivery and payment occurring at a specified future date, the ''delivery date'', making it a derivative product (i.e. a financial product that is derived from an underlying asset). The contracts are negotiated at a [[futures exchange]], which acts as an intermediary between buyer and seller. The party agreeing to buy the underlying asset in the future, the \"buyer\" of the contract, is said to be \"[[Long (finance)|long]]\", and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future, the \"seller\" of the contract, is said to be \"[[Short (finance)|short]]\".\n\nWhile the futures contract specifies a trade taking place in the future, the purpose of the futures exchange is to act as intermediary and mitigate the risk of default by either party in the intervening period. For this reason, the futures exchange requires both parties to put up an initial amount of cash (performance bond), the [[Futures contract#Margin|margin]]. Margins, sometimes set as a percentage of the value of the futures contract, need to be proportionally maintained at all times during the life of the contract to underpin this mitigation because the price of the contract will vary in keeping with supply and demand and will change daily and thus one party or the other will theoretically be making or losing money. To mitigate risk and the possibility of default by either party, the product is marked to market on a daily basis whereby the difference between the prior agreed-upon price and the actual daily futures price is settled on a daily basis. This is sometimes known as the variation margin where the futures exchange will draw money out of the losing party's margin account and put it into the other party's thus ensuring that the correct daily loss or profit is reflected in the respective account. If the margin account goes below a certain value set by the Exchange, then a margin call is made and the account owner must replenish the margin account. This process is known as \"marking to market\". Thus on the delivery date, the amount exchanged is not the specified price on the contract but the [[spot price|spot value]] (i.e., the original value agreed upon, since any gain or loss has already been previously settled by marking to market). Upon marketing the strike price is often reached and creates lots of income for the \"caller\".\n\nA closely related contract is a [[forward contract]]. A forward is like a futures in that it specifies the exchange of goods for a specified price at a specified future date. However, a forward is not traded on an exchange and thus does not have the interim partial payments due to marking to market. Nor is the contract standardized, as on the exchange.\nUnlike an [[option (finance)|option]], both parties of a futures contract must fulfill the contract on the delivery date. The seller delivers the underlying asset to the buyer, or, if it is a cash-settled futures contract, then cash is transferred from the futures trader who sustained a loss to the one who made a profit. To exit the commitment prior to the settlement date, the holder of a futures [[position (finance)|position]] can close out its contract obligations by taking the opposite position on another futures contract on the same asset and settlement date. The difference in futures prices is then a profit or loss..\n\n===Mortgage-backed securities===\nA '''mortgage-backed security''' ('''MBS''') is an [[asset-backed security]] that is secured by a [[mortgage]], or more commonly a collection (\"pool\") of sometimes hundreds of [[mortgage loan|mortgages]]. The mortgages are sold to a group of individuals (a government agency or investment bank) that \"[[securitization|securitizes]]\", or packages, the loans together into a security that can be sold to investors. The mortgages of an MBS may be [[Residential mortgage-backed security|residential]] or [[Commercial mortgage-backed security|commercial]], depending on whether it is an Agency MBS or a Non-Agency MBS; in the United States they may be issued by structures set up by [[government-sponsored enterprise]]s like [[Fannie Mae]] or [[Freddie Mac]], or they can be \"private-label\", issued by structures set up by investment banks. The structure of the MBS may be known as \"pass-through\", where the interest and principal payments from the borrower or homebuyer pass through it to the MBS holder, or it may be more complex, made up of a pool of other MBSs. Other types of MBS include [[collateralized mortgage obligation]]s (CMOs, often structured as real estate mortgage investment conduits) and [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs).<ref>Lemke, Lins and Picard, ''Mortgage-Backed Securities'', Chapters 4 and 5 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.).</ref>\n\nThe shares of subprime MBSs issued by various structures, such as CMOs, are not identical but rather issued as [[tranche]]s (French for \"slices\"), each with a different level of priority in the debt repayment stream, giving them different levels of risk and reward. Tranches\u2014especially the lower-priority, higher-interest tranches\u2014of an MBS are/were often further repackaged and resold as collaterized debt obligations.<ref>Josh Clark, [http://www.howstuffworks.com/mortgage-backed-security.htm \"How can mortgage-backed securities bring down the U.S. economy?\"], How Stuff Works</ref> These subprime MBSs issued by investment banks were a major issue in the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] of 2006\u20132008\n.\nThe total face value of an MBS decreases over time, because like mortgages, and unlike [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and most other fixed-income securities, the [[Debt|principal]] in an MBS is not paid back as a single payment to the bond holder at maturity but rather is paid along with the interest in each periodic payment (monthly, quarterly, etc.). This decrease in face value is measured by the MBS's \"factor\", the percentage of the original \"face\" that remains to be repaid.\n\n===Options===\nIn [[finance]], an '''option''' is a contract which gives the ''buyer'' (the owner) the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an [[underlying]] asset or [[financial instrument|instrument]] at a specified [[strike price]] on or before a specified [[expiration (options)|date]]. The ''seller'' has the corresponding obligation to fulfill the transaction\u2014that is to sell or buy\u2014if the buyer (owner) \"exercises\" the option. The buyer pays a premium to the seller for this right. An option that conveys to the owner the right to buy something at a certain price is a \"[[call option]]\"; an option that conveys the right of the owner to sell something at a certain price is a \"[[put option]]\". Both are commonly traded, but for clarity, the call option is more frequently discussed.\nOptions valuation is a topic of ongoing research in academic and practical finance. In basic terms, the value of an option is commonly decomposed into two parts:\n* The first part is the \"intrinsic value\", defined as the difference between the market value of the [[underlying]] and the strike price of the given option.\n* The second part is the \"time value\", which depends on a set of other factors which, through a multivariable, non-linear interrelationship, reflect the [[discounted]] [[expected value]] of that difference at expiration.\n\nAlthough options valuation has been studied since the 19th century, the contemporary approach is based on the [[Black\u2013Scholes model]], which was first published in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=Benhamou |title= Options pre-Black Scholes |url= http://www.ericbenhamou.net/documents/Encyclo/Pre%20Black-Scholes.pdf }}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last =Black |first= Fischer |first2= Myron |last2=Scholes |year=1973 |title=The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities |journal =[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=81 |issue=3 |pages=637\u2013654 |jstor=1831029 |doi=10.1086/260062}}</ref>\n\nOptions contracts have been known for many centuries. However, both trading activity and academic interest increased when, as from 1973, options were issued with standardized terms and traded through a guaranteed clearing house at the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]]. Today, many options are created in a standardized form and traded through clearing houses on regulated [[Exchange (organized market)|options exchanges]], while other [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] options are written as bilateral, customized contracts between a single buyer and seller, one or both of which may be a dealer or market-maker. Options are part of a larger class of financial instruments known as [[derivative products]] or simply derivatives.<ref name=\"hull\"/><ref>{{Citation\n|last=Brealey\n|first=Richard A.\n|author-link=Richard A.

The benefits in question depend on the type of financial instruments involved. For example, in the case of a swap involving two [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], the benefits in question can be the periodic interest ([[Coupon (bond)|coupon]]) payments associated with such bonds. Specifically, two counterparties agree to the exchange one stream of [[cash flow]]s against another stream. These streams are called the swap's \"legs\". The swap agreement defines the dates when the cash flows are to be paid and the way they are [[Accrual|accrued]] and calculated. Usually at the time when the contract is initiated, at least one of these series of cash flows is determined by an uncertain variable such as a [[floating interest rate]], [[foreign exchange rate]], equity price, or commodity price.<ref name=\"hull\"/>\n\nThe cash flows are calculated over a [[notional principal amount]]. Contrary to a [[futures contract|future]], a [[forward contract|forward]] or an [[option (finance)|option]], the notional amount is usually not exchanged between counterparties. Consequently, swaps can be in cash or [[collateral (finance)|collateral]].\nSwaps can be used to [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] certain risks such as [[interest rate risk]], or to [[speculation|speculate]] on changes in the expected direction of underlying prices.\n\nSwaps were first introduced to the public in 1981 when [[IBM]] and the [[World Bank]] entered into a swap agreement.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Corporate Finance |edition=9th | last1=Ross |last2=Westerfield |last3=Jordan |year=2010 |publisher=[[McGraw Hill]] |location= |isbn= |page=746 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> Today, swaps are among the most heavily traded financial contracts in the world: the total amount of interest rates and currency swaps outstanding is more than $348 trillion in 2010, according to the [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The five generic types of swaps, in order of their quantitative importance, are: [[interest rate swap]]s, [[currency swap]]s, credit swaps, [[commodity swap]]s and [[equity swap]]s (there are many other types).\n\n==Economic function of the derivative market==\nSome of the salient economic functions of the derivative market include:\n# Prices in a structured [[derivative market]] not only replicate the discernment of the market participants about the future but also lead the prices of [[underlying]] to the professed future level. On the expiration of the [[derivative contract]], the prices of derivatives congregate with the prices of the underlying.  Therefore, derivatives are essential tools to determine both current and future prices.\n# The derivatives market reallocates risk from the people who prefer [[risk aversion]] to the people who have an appetite for risk.\n# The intrinsic nature of derivatives market associates them to the underlying [[spot market]]. Due to derivatives there is a considerable increase in trade volumes of the underlying spot market. The dominant factor behind such an escalation is increased participation by additional players who would not have otherwise participated due to absence of any procedure to transfer risk.\n# As supervision, reconnaissance of the activities of various participants becomes tremendously difficult in assorted markets; the establishment of an organized form of market becomes all the more imperative. Therefore, in the presence of an organized derivatives market, [[speculation]] can be controlled, resulting in a more meticulous environment.\n# Third parties can use publicly available derivative prices as educated predictions of uncertain future outcomes, for example, the likelihood that a corporation will default on its debts.\nIn a nutshell, there is a substantial increase in savings and investment in the long run due to augmented activities by derivative [[market participant]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Currency Derivatives: A Beginner's Module|url=http://www.nseindia.com/education/content/module_ncfm.htm}}</ref>\n\n==Valuation==\n[[File:Total world wealth vs total world derivatives 1998-2007.gif|thumb|450px|Total world derivatives from 1998 to 2007<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/statistics/derstats.htm |title=Bis.org |publisher=Bis.org |date=May 7, 2010 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> compared to total world wealth in the year 2000<ref>{{cite web | title = Launch of the WIDER study on The World Distribution of Household Wealth: 5 December 2006 | url=http://www.wider.unu.edu/events/past-events/2006-events/en_GB/05-12-2006/ | accessdate = June 9, 2009}}</ref>]]\n\n===Market and arbitrage-free prices===\nTwo common measures of value are:\n* [[Market price]], i.e. the price at which traders are willing to buy or sell the contract\n* [[Arbitrage]]-free price, meaning that no risk-free profits can be made by trading in these contracts (see ''[[rational pricing]]'')\n\n===Determining the market price===\nFor exchange-traded derivatives, market price is usually transparent (often published in real time by the exchange, based on all the current bids and offers placed on that particular contract at any one time). Complications can arise with OTC or floor-traded contracts though, as trading is handled manually, making it difficult to automatically broadcast prices. In particular with OTC contracts, there is no central exchange to collate and disseminate prices.\n\n===Determining the arbitrage-free price===\n{{seealso|List of finance topics#Derivatives pricing}}\nThe arbitrage-free price for a derivatives contract can be complex, and there are many different variables to consider. Arbitrage-free pricing is a central topic of [[financial mathematics]]. For futures/forwards the arbitrage free price is relatively straightforward, involving the price of the underlying together with the cost of carry (income received less interest costs), although there can be complexities.\n\nHowever, for options and more complex derivatives, pricing involves developing a complex pricing model: understanding the [[stochastic process]] of the price of the underlying asset is often crucial. A key equation for the theoretical [[valuation of options]] is the [[Black\u2013Scholes formula]], which is based on the assumption that the cash flows from a European stock [[Option (finance)|option]] can be replicated by a continuous buying and selling strategy using only the stock. A simplified version of this valuation technique is the [[binomial options model]].\n\nOTC represents the biggest challenge in using models to price derivatives. Since these contracts are not publicly traded, no market price is available to validate the theoretical valuation. Most of the model's results are input-dependent (meaning the final price depends heavily on how we derive the pricing inputs).<ref>{{cite web |last=Boumlouka |first=Makrem  |title=Alternatives in OTC Pricing |work=Hedge Funds Review |date=October 30, 2009 |url=http://www.hedgefundsreview.com/hedge-funds-review/news/1560286/otc-pricing-deal-struck-fitch-solutions-pricing-partners}}</ref>\nTherefore, it is common that OTC derivatives are priced by Independent Agents that both counterparties involved in the deal designate upfront (when signing the contract).\n\n==Criticisms==\nDerivatives are often subject to the following criticisms:\n\n=== Hidden tail risk ===\nAccording to [[Raghuram Rajan]], a former chief economist of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), \"...&nbsp;it may well be that the managers of these firms [investment funds] have figured out the correlations between the various instruments they hold and believe they are hedged. Yet as Chan and others (2005) point out, the lessons of summer 1998 following the default on Russian government debt is that correlations that are zero or negative in normal times can turn overnight to one \u2013 a phenomenon they term \"phase lock-in\". A hedged position \"can become unhedged at the worst times, inflicting substantial losses on those who mistakenly believe they are protected\".<ref>{{cite journal\n  | author = Raghuram G.

Derivatives allow [[investor]]s to earn large returns from small movements in the underlying asset's price. However, investors could lose large amounts if the price of the underlying moves against them significantly. There have been several instances of massive losses in derivative markets, such as the following:\n\n:* [[American International Group]] (AIG) lost more than US$18 billion through a subsidiary over the preceding three quarters on [[credit default swap]]s (CDSs).<ref>{{cite news|last=Kelleher |first=James B.|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN1837154020080918 |title=\"Buffett's Time Bomb Goes Off on Wall Street\" by James B.

Different types of derivatives have different levels of counter party risk. For example, standardized stock options by law require the party at risk to have a certain amount deposited with the exchange, showing that they can pay for any losses; banks that help businesses swap variable for fixed rates on loans may do credit checks on both parties. However, in private agreements between two companies, for example, there may not be benchmarks for performing due diligence and risk analysis.\n\n===Large notional value===\nDerivatives typically have a '''large notional value'''. As such, there is the danger that their use could result in losses for which the investor would be unable to compensate. The possibility that this could lead to a chain reaction ensuing in an economic crisis was pointed out by famed investor [[Warren Buffett]] in [[Berkshire Hathaway]]'s 2002 annual report. Buffett called them 'financial weapons of mass destruction.' A potential problem with derivatives is that they comprise an increasingly larger notional amount of assets which may lead to distortions in the underlying capital and equities markets themselves. Investors begin to look at the derivatives markets to make a decision to buy or sell securities and so what was originally meant to be a market to transfer risk now becomes a leading indicator.[http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2002ar/2002ar.pdf (See Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report for 2002)]\n\n==Financial reform and government regulation==\nUnder US law and the laws of most other developed countries, derivatives have special legal exemptions that make them a particularly attractive legal form to extend credit. The strong creditor protections afforded to derivatives counterparties, in combination with their complexity and lack of transparency however, can cause capital markets to underprice credit risk. This can contribute to credit booms, and increase systemic risks. Indeed, the use of derivatives to conceal credit risk from third parties while protecting derivative counterparties contributed to the financial crisis of 2008 in the United States.\n\nIn the context of a 2010 examination of the [[Intercontinental Exchange|ICE Trust]], an industry self-regulatory body, [[Gary Gensler]], the chairman of the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] which regulates most derivatives, was quoted saying that the derivatives marketplace as it functions now \"adds up to higher costs to all Americans\". More oversight of the banks in this market is needed, he also said. Additionally, the report said, \"[t]he [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] is looking into derivatives, too. The department's antitrust unit is actively investigating 'the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the credit derivatives clearing, trading and information services industries', according to a department spokeswoman.\"<ref>Story, Louise, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/business/12advantage.html?hp \"A Secretive Banking Elite Rules Trading in Derivatives\"], ''The New York Times'', December 11, 2010 (December 12, 2010, p. A1 NY ed.). Retrieved December 12, 2010.</ref>\n\nFor legislators and committees responsible for financial reform related to derivatives in the United States and elsewhere, distinguishing between hedging and speculative derivatives activities has been a nontrivial challenge. The distinction is critical because regulation should help to isolate and curtail speculation with derivatives, especially for \"systemically significant\" institutions whose default could be large enough to threaten the entire financial system. At the same time, the legislation should allow for responsible parties to hedge risk without unduly tying up working capital as collateral that firms may better employ elsewhere in their operations and investment.<ref>Zubrod, Luke (2011). The Atlantic. \"Will the 'Cure' for Systemic Risk Kill the Economy?\" https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/06/will-the-cure-for-systemic-risk-kill-the-economy/240600/</ref>  \nIn this regard, it is important to distinguish between financial (e.g. banks) and non-financial end-users of derivatives (e.g. real estate development companies) because these firms' derivatives usage is inherently different. More importantly, the reasonable collateral that secures these different counterparties can be very different. The distinction between these firms is not always straight forward (e.g. hedge funds or even some private equity firms do not neatly fit either category). Finally, even financial users must be differentiated, as 'large' banks may classified as \"systemically significant\" whose derivatives activities must be more tightly monitored and restricted than those of smaller, local and regional banks.\n\nOver-the-counter dealing will be less common as the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] comes into effect. The law mandated the clearing of certain swaps at registered exchanges and imposed various restrictions on derivatives. To implement Dodd-Frank, the [http://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/DoddFrankAct/index.htm CFTC developed new rules in at least 30 areas]. The Commission determines which swaps are subject to mandatory clearing and whether a derivatives exchange is eligible to clear a certain type of swap contract.\n\nNonetheless, the above and other challenges of the rule-making process have delayed full enactment of aspects of the legislation relating to derivatives. The challenges are further complicated by the necessity to orchestrate globalized financial reform among the nations that comprise the world's major financial markets, a primary responsibility of the [[Financial Stability Board]] whose progress is ongoing.<ref>Financial Stability Board (2012).  \"OTC Derivatives Market Reforms Third Progress Report on Implementation\" June 15, 2012 http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_120615.pdf</ref>\n\nIn the U.S., by February 2012 the combined effort of the SEC and CFTC had produced over 70 proposed and final derivatives rules.<ref name=\"lexology1\">{{cite web|author=Proskauer Rose LLP |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=e7db9a60-9fca-449b-850b-b4a32d1e425d |title=SEC and CFTC oversight of derivatives: a status report |publisher=Lexology |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}</ref>  However, both of them had delayed adoption of a number of derivatives regulations because of the burden of other rulemaking, litigation and opposition to the rules, and many core definitions (such as the terms \"swap\", \"security-based swap\", \"swap dealer\", \"security-based swap dealer\", \"major swap participant\" and \"major security-based swap participant\") had still not been adopted.<ref name=\"lexology1\"/>  SEC Chairman [[Mary Schapiro]] opined: \"At the end of the day, it probably does not make sense to harmonize everything [between the SEC and CFTC rules] because some of these products are quite different and certainly the market structures are quite different.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Younglai |first=Rachelle |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2009/06/19/idINIndia-40440620090619 |title=Interview \u2013 Not all SEC, CFTC rules must be harmonized |work=Reuters |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}</ref> On February 11, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released two final rules toward establishing a reporting and public disclosure framework for security-based swap transaction data.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/sec-swap-reporting-and-disclosure.pdf |title= First take: Ten key points from the SEC's swaps reporting and disclosure rules |publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, February 2015}}</ref> The two rules are not completely harmonized with the requirements with CFTC requirements.\n\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev at G20 Pittsburgh summit-1.jpg|thumb|300px|Country leaders at the [[2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit]]]]\nIn November 2012, the SEC and regulators from Australia, Brazil, the European Union, Hong Kong, Japan, Ontario, Quebec, Singapore, and Switzerland met to discuss reforming the OTC derivatives market, as had been agreed by leaders at the [[2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit]] in September 2009.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1365171486526 |title=Joint Press Statement of Leaders on Operating Principles and Areas of Exploration in the Regulation of the Cross-Border OTC Derivatives Market; 2012-251 |publisher=Sec.gov |date=December 4, 2012 |accessdate=March 11, 2016}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> In December 2012, they released a joint statement to the effect that they recognized that the market is a global one and \"firmly support the adoption and enforcement of robust and consistent standards in and across jurisdictions\", with the goals of mitigating risk, improving [[Transparency (market)|transparency]], protecting against [[market abuse]], preventing regulatory gaps, reducing the potential for [[arbitrage]] opportunities, and fostering a [[level playing field]] for market participants.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> They also agreed on the need to reduce regulatory uncertainty and provide market participants with sufficient clarity on laws and regulations by avoiding, to the extent possible, the application of conflicting rules to the same entities and transactions, and minimizing the application of inconsistent and duplicative rules.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>  At the same time, they noted that \"complete harmonization \u2013 perfect alignment of rules across jurisdictions\" would be difficult, because of jurisdictions' differences in law, policy, markets, implementation timing, and legislative and regulatory processes.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nOn December 20, 2013 the CFTC provided information on its swaps regulation \"comparability\" determinations.

This means that a bank's obligation, in the event of the default or insolvency of one of the parties, would be the net sum of all positive and negative fair values of contracts included in the bilateral netting arrangement.\n* [[Counterparty]]: The legal and financial term for the other party in a financial transaction.\n* [[Credit derivative]]: A contract that transfers [[credit risk]] from a protection buyer to a credit protection seller. Credit derivative products can take many forms, such as [[credit default swap]]s, credit linked notes and total return swaps.\n* Derivative: A financial contract whose value is derived from the performance of assets, interest rates, currency exchange rates, or indexes. Derivative transactions include a wide assortment of financial contracts including structured debt obligations and deposits, swaps, futures, options, caps, floors, collars, forwards and various combinations thereof.\n* [[Exchange-traded derivative contract]]s: Standardized derivative contracts (e.g., [[futures contract]]s and [[Option (finance)|options]]) that are transacted on an organized [[futures exchange]].\n* Gross negative fair value: The sum of the fair values of contracts where the bank owes money to its counter-parties, without taking into account netting. This represents the maximum losses the bank's counter-parties would incur if the bank defaults and there is no netting of contracts, and no bank collateral was held by the counter-parties.\n* Gross positive fair value: The sum total of the fair values of contracts where the bank is owed money by its counter-parties, without taking into account netting. This represents the maximum losses a bank could incur if all its counter-parties default and there is no netting of contracts, and the bank holds no counter-party collateral.\n* High-risk mortgage securities: Securities where the price or expected average life is highly sensitive to interest rate changes, as determined by the U.S. [[Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council]] policy statement on high-risk mortgage securities.\n* [[Notional amount]]: The nominal or [[face amount]] that is used to calculate payments made on swaps and other risk management products. This amount generally does not change hands and is thus referred to as notional.\n* [[over-the-counter (finance)|Over-the-counter]] (OTC) derivative contracts: Privately negotiated derivative contracts that are transacted off organized futures exchanges.\n* [[Structured note]]s: Non-mortgage-backed [[debt securities]], whose cash flow characteristics depend on one or more indices and / or have embedded forwards or options.\n* Total risk-based capital: The sum of [[Tier 1 capital|tier 1]] plus [[tier 2 capital]]. Tier 1 capital consists of common shareholders equity, perpetual preferred shareholders equity with noncumulative dividends, [[retained earnings]], and [[minority interest]]s in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Tier 2 capital consists of [[subordinated debt]], intermediate-term [[preferred stock]], cumulative and long-term preferred stock, and a portion of a bank's [[Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL)|allowance for loan and lease losses]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Finance}}\n{{Colbegin}}\n* [[Credit derivative]]\n* [[Derivatives law]]\n* [[Equity derivative]]\n* [[Exotic derivative]]\n* [[Financial engineering]]\n* [[Foreign exchange derivative]]\n* [[Freight derivative]]\n* [[Inflation derivative]]\n* [[Interest rate derivative]]\n* [[Property derivatives]]\n* [[Weather derivative]]\n{{Colend}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |authorlink= |author2=Brown, Gregory W. |author3=Conrad, Jennifer C. |date= August 2011  |title=The Effects of Derivatives on Firm Risk and Value |journal= Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis |volume= 46 |issue=4 |pages=967\u2013999 |doi= 10.1017/s0022109011000275|ssrn = 1550942  |author1= S\u00f6hnke M.

A quirky example would be estimating the speed of light, tea consumption in Taiwan, and hog weight in Montana, all together.  The James\u2013Stein estimator always improves upon the ''total'' MSE, i.e., the sum of the expected errors of each component.
