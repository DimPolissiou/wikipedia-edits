The briefcase contains a contract that guarantees the winner a match for a world championship of their choosing at any time within the next year. Since the [[Money in the Bank (2018)|2018 event]], both the men's and women's matches featured eight wrestlers, evenly divided between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] [[WWE brand extension|brands]]. For 2020, it was reduced to six wrestlers divided between the brands. Male wrestlers compete for a contract to grant them a match for either Raw's [[WWE Championship]] or SmackDown's [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], while female wrestlers compete for a [[Raw Women's Championship]] or [[SmackDown Women's Championship]] match contract. 2020 will be the eleventh event in the Money in the Bank chronology.<ref name=\"2020event\"/>\n\n====Impact of the coronavirus pandemic====\nThe event was originally announced with [[Baltimore]]'s [[Royal Farms Arena]] as host.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lambert|first=Jeremy|title=WWE Money In The Bank 2020 Scheduled For May 10 In Baltimore, MD|url=https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/wwe-money-bank-2020-scheduled-may-10-baltimore-md|work=Fightful|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"2020event\">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Mike|title=WWE MONEY IN THE BANK 2020 DETAILS|url=https://pwinsider.com/article/134349/wwe-money-in-the-bank-2020-details.html?p=1|work=PWInsider|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref> However, [[Maryland]] issued a [[stay at home order]] on March 30, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maryland to Enact Stay-at-Home Order Monday as Coronavirus Cases Top 1,400|last=Barnes|first=Sophia|url=https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/maryland-governor-larry-hogan-latest-monday-march-30-coronavirus-outbreak-covid-19-stay-at-home-order/2258161/|work=NBC4 Washington|date=March 30, 2020|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref> Subsequently on April 9, the host venue cancelled the event due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], and began issuing refunds.

During the fall it was encamped for some time at Bladensburg, did duty on the Potomac above Washington, built Fort Lincoln, moved to Budd's Ferry, and was variously engaged until spring when it became a part of Grover's Brigade, Hooker's Division, Heintzelman's (3d) Corps, and was transferred to the Peninsula.\n\nOn April 6 it was in action before Yorktown, and on May 5 it suffered heavily at Williamsburg. It was encamped in the White Oak Swamp region until June 25 when it was engaged with loss at Fair Oaks. During the Seven Days battles it lost heavily at Glendale, June 30, its major, Charles P. Chandler being killed. After the battle of Malvern Hill it retired to Harrison's Landing where it remained until August when it was ordered back to the defenses of Washington.\n\nJoining Gen. Pope's army near Warrenton Jc., as a part of Grover's Brigade, Hooker's Division, it was in action at Bristoe Station, Aug. 27, and again near Groveton (Manassas), Aug. 29, where it assaulted the celebrated railroad embankment and suffered severe loss. After the campaign was ended the regiment remained in or near the defenses of Washington until the last of October. About this time Gen. Carr succeeded Gen. Grover in command of the brigade. After Fredericksburg, where the regiment suffered slight loss, it went into winter quarters at Acquia Creek on the Potomac\n\nAs a part of Carr's Brigade, Berry's Division, Sickles' (3d) Corps, it lost heavily at Chancellorsville, May 3, 1863, and still more heavily at Gettysburg, July 2, while defending the line of the Emmittsburg road. At Wapping Heights, July 23, in New York City during the late summer and fall, at Kelly's Ford, Nov. 7, and during the Mine Run campaign in the latter part of November the regiment performed valuable service with few casualties. The following winter was spent in camp near Brandy Station.\n\nWhen the 3d Corps was broken up in the early spring of 1864 the 1st Regt. became a part of McAllister's Brigade, Mott's Division, Hancock's (2d) Corps. With this command it participated in the battles of the Wildemess and Spottsylvania, its last combat service being in Hancock's assault on the Bloody Angle, May 12, 1864.\n\nTransferring its recruits and re-enlisted men to the 11th Mass. Inf., about May 20 it left the front and returned to Boston where it was mustered out on May 25, after fully three years of service.\n\n===Detailed Service===\n\n====1861====\n\n====1862====\n\n\n\n====1863====\n\n\n====1864====\n\n==Armament==\n\n==Casualties and total strength==\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [http://www.civilwarhome.com/gettysburgorderofbattle%28union%29.htm Civilwarhome - Gettysburg Union order of battle]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110603055742/http://www.civilwar.org/battlefields/gettysburg/gettysburg-history-articles/order-of-battle-aop-gettysburg.html Civil War Trust - Gettysburg Union order of battle]\n* {{cite book|author=Coates, Earl J., and Thomas S.

These roles can include, but would not be limited to, [[Land mine|minefield breaching]], route denial, dozing and digging tasks, and the erection or [[demolition]] of [[obstacle]]s. The vehicle was originally developed for a [[Swiss Army]] requirement by the [[consortium]] of  Rheinmetall Landsysteme GmbH (Germany) and RUAG Defence (Switzerland).<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\">{{cite web |url=https://janes.ihs.com/Janes/Display/JAA_0021-JAFV|title=Leopard 2 (October 2019 update)|publisher=Jane's UK Ltd|date=2019-10-16|accessdate=2020-02-17}}</ref><ref name=\"AEV Kodiak\">{{cite web |url=https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/modern-switzerland-germany-aev-3-kodiak/|title=AEV Kodiak|publisher=Online Tank Museum|date=2019-07-18|accessdate=2020-02-17}}</ref><ref name=\"AEV 3 Kodiak\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rheinmetall-defence.com/en/rheinmetall_defence/systems_and_products/vehicle_systems/armoured_tracked_vehicles/index.php|title=AEV 3 Kodiak|publisher=Rheinmetall AG|accessdate=2020-02-17}}</ref>\n\n[[English language|English]] nomenclature for the vehicle is now AEV 3 Kodiak, while German is Pionierpanzer 3 (PiPz 3) Kodiak. Depending on user or reference source the AEV 3 Kodiak may also be referred to as Gepanzerte Pioniermaschine Kodiak, AEBV (Armoured Engineering and Breaching Vehicle), Armoured Engineer Vehicle 3 Kodiak, Ingenj\u00f6rbandvagn 120, or the L2-AEV.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/><ref name=\"AEV 3 Kodiak\"/><ref name=\"AEV  Kodiak\"/>\n\n==Development==\nDevelopment of the AEV 3 Kodiak traces back to 2002 and the Swiss Army's Armoured Engineer Vehicle 3 requirement. As a technology partner of the Swiss Army, RUAG Defence entered into a consortium with Rheinmetall Landsysteme, Rheinmetall (with [[Krauss-Maffei Wegmann]]) joint-manufacturers of the Leopard 2 main battle tank (MBT) on which the AEV 3 Kodiak is based. The name Kodiak was adopted for the Armoured Engineer Vehicle 3 during development for future marketing purposes only.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/><ref name=\"AEV 3 Kodiak\"/>\n \nThe first Armoured Engineer Vehicle 3 prototype for the Swiss Army was constructed using company funds and was based on a surplus Swiss Army Leopard 2 MBT, the Leopard 2 designated Panzer 87 by the Swiss. In the summer of 2003 the [[prototype]] underwent two months of trials with the Swiss Army, and during 2004 it was shown at the [[Eurosatory]] defence exhibition in [[Paris]]. Following this showing the prototype underwent a series of trials with Leopard 2 MBT users [[Denmark]], the Netherlands, [[Spain]] and [[Sweden]]. The Swedish trials involved leasing the prototype to the Swedish armed forces procurement agency (FMV, [[Defence Materiel Administration|F\u00f6rsvarets materielverk)]] for [[winter]] trials. Following these trials results were shared with the International AEV Coordination Group which had been established to develop some [[commonality]] within armoured engineering vehicle requirements and programs. At this juncture the group consisted of Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden Switzerland. Spain and Denmark would ultimately leave the group.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/><ref name=\"AEV 3 Kodiak\"/>\n\nOn 9 January 2007, Rheinmetall announced a Swiss Army contract award for 12 Armoured Engineer Vehicle 3 valued at [[Swiss franc|CHF]] 95 million (US$76 million). The twelve Leopard 2 chassis used came from Swiss Army stocks with turrets removed and construction occurred in Switzerland. By late 2011 the last example had been delivered and the vehicles are used by the Swiss Army's Panzersappeurbataillon 11.<ref name=\"AEV 3 Kodiak\"/>\n\nThe next customers for AEV 3 Kodiak would be the Netherlands and Sweden in a joint purchase. Since 2001 and to reduce costs Sweden had attempted [[collaborations]] with Switzerland and Denmark without success and in 2005 would commence lone [[procurement]] of an armoured engineering vehicle. The Netherlands joined the Swedish project in 2006. On 16 January 2008, Sweden and the Netherlands placed a joint order for 16 vehicles, six for Sweden and ten for the Netherlands. Contract value was around [[\u20ac]]40 million (Sweden) and \u20ac60 million (the Netherlands). Delivery occurred between 2011\u20132012.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/>\n\nSwedish vehicles are known as AEV 3 S (Swedish), or locally as the Ingenj\u00f6rbandvagn 120, and are based on six Swedish Army Leopard 2 chassis (Stridsvagn 121 in Swedish service) chassis. The chassis were upgraded locally to Stridsvagn 122 standard and then transported to Germany for conversion.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/><ref name=\"AEV 3 Kodiak\"/> The Netherlands vehicles are based on Leopard 2A4 chassis. These were overhauled locally before being converted in Germany. In service the Dutch vehicles replaced fourteen [[Leopard 1]] engineering vehicles.\nSwedish and Dutch vehicles reportedly share 95% [[commonality]] with differences limited to [[camouflage]] patterns, [[smoke grenade]] launchers, and some tools/equipment. The Dutch vehicles do feature a [[bomblet]] protection package.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/><ref name=\"AEV 3 Kodiak\"/>\n\nThe most recent Army to adopt the AEV 3 Kodiak is [[Singapore]]. A total of fourteen AEV 3 Kodiaks (known locally as L2-AEV) were ordered and delivered in between 2014 and 2015. In service these are operated by the 38th Battalion, Singapore Combat Engineers (38 SCE), and replaced the US-built M728 CEV.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/>\n\n==Description==\nThe AEV 3 Kodiak typically uses [[Excess supply|surplus]] Leopard 2 hulls from existing users, but is available as a new-build vehicle on a current-generation Leopard 2 hull. Generic modifications include the removal of the turret and installation of a completely new fixed superstructure, the installation of a [[hydraulic]] mounting for a [[bulldozer|dozer blade]] or mine clearing plough, and the installation of a telescopic arm typically fitted with an [[excavator]] bucket.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/><ref name=\"AEV  Kodiak\"/>\n\n'''Hull structure and layout'''\n\nThe fixed superstructure of the AEV 3 Kodiak is constructed from [[armour|all-welded steel]], the protection level of which is [[classified information|classified]], and for which a mine-protection package has been developed. The [[superstructure]] features a split [[air-conditioned]] crew compartment on the front left and front right of the vehicle. The left compartment is for the driver and an engineer crewman, the right compartment for the commander. The driver has a single-piece rear opening hatch with three integral day [[periscope]]s. A [[camera]] system with up to six cameras (on the main boom, dozer blade and the front and rear of the vehicle) provide the two- or three-person crew with a panoramic view provides individual [[situational awareness]] for the crew.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/><ref name=\"AEV  Kodiak\"/> If required, the vehicle can be line-of-sight remotely controlled.\n\nLocated centrally between the crew compartment at the front of the vehicle is the excavator arm. When not in use this is traversed to the rear and locates between the crew compartment. The excavator arm broadly resembles that of a conventional [[backhoe loader]], but with two pivot points instead of one. The standard excavator bucket has a [[volume]] of one cubic meter and, when in continuous use, can move up to 200 cubic meters of earth per hour. The arm has a maximum horizontal reach of 9 meters and a reach of 8.2 meters vertically. The bucket and other tools can be removed/attached from under armour via a quick-coupling device. A range of other tools are available and these include a gripper, a [[Breaker (hydraulic)|hydraulic hammer]], an [[Auger (drill)|earth auger]], or a [[fascine]] launching system.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/> On a rack above the rear engine deck two of these tools may be transported if required. The excavator arm may also be used for lifting items such as logs or fascines, and has a maximum lift capacity of 3.5-tonnes; 2.6-tonnes with the bucket attached.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/><ref name=\"AEV  Kodiak\"/>\n\nAlso mounted at the front of the vehicle is a [[hydraulically]] operated tiltable blade, this 3.42 m wide, or 4.02 m with extensions. This can be used for dozing or scraping operations, or to stabilise the vehicle when the [[winch]]es are being used or the excavator arm is being used for heavy lifting. The blade can also be fitted with two scarifiers for route denial use. As an option, the blade can be removed and replaced with a mine-breaching package that can include a mine plough, a cleared lane marking system and a signature duplicator system to neutralise [[anti-tank mine]]s fitted with advanced [[fuze]]s.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/>\n\nPrimarily for obstacle removal, two Rotzler hydraulic nine-tonne variable speed winches are fitted. These have 200 m of usable cable and can operate singularly or together at up to 90 m/minute, and are typically utilised to remove obstacles.

These roles can include, but would not be limited to, [[Land mine|minefield breaching]], route denial, dozing and digging tasks, and the erection or [[demolition]] of [[obstacle]]s. The vehicle was originally developed for a [[Swiss Army]] requirement by the [[consortium]] of  Rheinmetall Landsysteme GmbH (Germany) and RUAG Defence (Switzerland).<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\">{{cite web |url=https://janes.ihs.com/Janes/Display/JAA_0021-JAFV|title=Leopard 2 (October 2019 update)|publisher=Jane's UK Ltd|date=2019-10-16|accessdate=2020-02-17}}</ref><ref name=\"AEV Kodiak\">{{cite web |url=https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/modern-switzerland-germany-aev-3-kodiak/|title=AEV Kodiak|publisher=Online Tank Museum|date=2019-07-18|accessdate=2020-02-17}}</ref><ref name=\"AEV 3 Kodiak\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rheinmetall-defence.com/en/rheinmetall_defence/systems_and_products/vehicle_systems/armoured_tracked_vehicles/index.php|title=AEV 3 Kodiak|publisher=Rheinmetall AG|accessdate=2020-02-17}}</ref>\n\n[[English language|English]] nomenclature for the vehicle is now AEV 3 Kodiak, while German is Pionierpanzer 3 (PiPz 3) Kodiak. Depending on user or reference source the AEV 3 Kodiak may also be referred to as Gepanzerte Pioniermaschine Kodiak, AEBV (Armoured Engineering and Breaching Vehicle), Armoured Engineer Vehicle 3 Kodiak, Ingenj\u00f6rbandvagn 120, or the L2-AEV.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/><ref name=\"AEV 3 Kodiak\"/><ref name=\"AEV  Kodiak\"/>\n\n==Development==\nDevelopment of the AEV 3 Kodiak traces back to 2002 and the Swiss Army's Armoured Engineer Vehicle 3 requirement. As a technology partner of the Swiss Army, RUAG Defence entered into a consortium with Rheinmetall Landsysteme, Rheinmetall (with [[Krauss-Maffei Wegmann]]) joint-manufacturers of the Leopard 2 main battle tank (MBT) on which the AEV 3 Kodiak is based. The name Kodiak was adopted for the Armoured Engineer Vehicle 3 during development for future marketing purposes only.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/><ref name=\"AEV 3 Kodiak\"/>\n \nThe first Armoured Engineer Vehicle 3 prototype for the Swiss Army was constructed using company funds and was based on a surplus Swiss Army Leopard 2 MBT, the Leopard 2 designated Panzer 87 by the Swiss. In the summer of 2003 the [[prototype]] underwent two months of trials with the Swiss Army, and during 2004 it was shown at the [[Eurosatory]] defence exhibition in [[Paris]]. Following this showing the prototype underwent a series of trials with Leopard 2 MBT users [[Denmark]], the Netherlands, [[Spain]] and [[Sweden]]. The Swedish trials involved leasing the prototype to the Swedish armed forces procurement agency (FMV, [[Defence Materiel Administration|F\u00f6rsvarets materielverk)]] for [[winter]] trials. Following these trials results were shared with the International AEV Coordination Group which had been established to develop some [[commonality]] within armoured engineering vehicle requirements and programs. At this juncture the group consisted of Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden Switzerland. Spain and Denmark would ultimately leave the group.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/><ref name=\"AEV 3 Kodiak\"/>\n\nOn 9 January 2007, Rheinmetall announced a Swiss Army contract award for 12 Armoured Engineer Vehicle 3 valued at [[Swiss franc|CHF]] 95 million (US$76 million). The twelve Leopard 2 chassis used came from Swiss Army stocks with turrets removed and construction occurred in Switzerland. By late 2011 the last example had been delivered and the vehicles are used by the Swiss Army's Panzersappeurbataillon 11.<ref name=\"AEV 3 Kodiak\"/>\n\nThe next customers for AEV 3 Kodiak would be the Netherlands and Sweden in a joint purchase. Since 2001 and to reduce costs Sweden had attempted [[collaborations]] with Switzerland and Denmark without success and in 2005 would commence lone [[procurement]] of an armoured engineering vehicle. The Netherlands joined the Swedish project in 2006. On 16 January 2008, Sweden and the Netherlands placed a joint order for 16 vehicles, six for Sweden and ten for the Netherlands. Contract value was around [[\u20ac]]40 million (Sweden) and \u20ac60 million (the Netherlands). Delivery occurred between 2011\u20132012.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/>\n\nSwedish vehicles are known as AEV 3 S (Swedish), or locally as the Ingenj\u00f6rbandvagn 120, and are based on six Swedish Army Leopard 2 chassis (Stridsvagn 121 in Swedish service) chassis. The chassis were upgraded locally to Stridsvagn 122 standard and then transported to Germany for conversion.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/><ref name=\"AEV 3 Kodiak\"/> The Netherlands vehicles are based on Leopard 2A4 chassis. These were overhauled locally before being converted in Germany. In service the Dutch vehicles replaced fourteen [[Leopard 1]] engineering vehicles.\nSwedish and Dutch vehicles reportedly share 95% [[commonality]] with differences limited to [[camouflage]] patterns, [[smoke grenade]] launchers, and some tools/equipment. The Dutch vehicles do feature a [[bomblet]] protection package.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/><ref name=\"AEV 3 Kodiak\"/>\n\nThe most recent Army to adopt the AEV 3 Kodiak is [[Singapore]]. A total of fourteen AEV 3 Kodiaks (known locally as L2-AEV) were ordered and delivered in between 2014 and 2015. In service these are operated by the 38th Battalion, Singapore Combat Engineers (38 SCE), and replaced the US-built M728 CEV.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/>\n\n==Description==\nThe AEV 3 Kodiak typically uses [[Excess supply|surplus]] Leopard 2 hulls from existing users, but is available as a new-build vehicle on a current-generation Leopard 2 hull. Generic modifications include the removal of the turret and installation of a completely new fixed superstructure, the installation of a [[hydraulic]] mounting for a [[bulldozer|dozer blade]] or mine clearing plough, and the installation of a telescopic arm typically fitted with an [[excavator]] bucket.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/><ref name=\"AEV  Kodiak\"/>\n\n'''Hull structure and layout'''\n\nThe fixed superstructure of the AEV 3 Kodiak is constructed from [[armour|all-welded steel]], the protection level of which is [[classified information|classified]], and for which a mine-protection package has been developed. The [[superstructure]] features a split [[air-conditioned]] crew compartment on the front left and front right of the vehicle. The left compartment is for the driver and an engineer crewman, the right compartment for the commander. The driver has a single-piece rear opening hatch with three integral day [[periscope]]s. A [[camera]] system with up to six cameras (on the main boom, dozer blade and the front and rear of the vehicle) provide the two- or three-person crew with a panoramic view provides individual [[situational awareness]] for the crew.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/><ref name=\"AEV  Kodiak\"/> If required, the vehicle can be line-of-sight remotely controlled.\n\nLocated centrally between the crew compartment at the front of the vehicle is the excavator arm. When not in use this is traversed to the rear and locates between the crew compartment. The excavator arm broadly resembles that of a conventional [[backhoe loader]], but with two pivot points instead of one. The standard excavator bucket has a [[volume]] of one cubic meter and, when in continuous use, can move up to 200 cubic meters of earth per hour. The arm has a maximum horizontal reach of 9 meters and a reach of 8.2 meters vertically. The bucket and other tools can be removed/attached from under armour via a quick-coupling device. A range of other tools are available and these include a gripper, a [[Breaker (hydraulic)|hydraulic hammer]], an [[Auger (drill)|earth auger]], or a [[fascine]] launching system.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/> On a rack above the rear engine deck two of these tools may be transported if required. The excavator arm may also be used for lifting items such as logs or fascines, and has a maximum lift capacity of 3.5-tonnes; 2.6-tonnes with the bucket attached.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/><ref name=\"AEV  Kodiak\"/>\n\nAlso mounted at the front of the vehicle is a [[hydraulically]] operated tiltable blade, this 3.42 m wide, or 4.02 m with extensions. This can be used for dozing or scraping operations, or to stabilise the vehicle when the [[winch]]es are being used or the excavator arm is being used for heavy lifting. The blade can also be fitted with two scarifiers for route denial use. As an option, the blade can be removed and replaced with a mine-breaching package that can include a mine plough, a cleared lane marking system and a signature duplicator system to neutralise [[anti-tank mine]]s fitted with advanced [[fuze]]s.<ref name=\"Jane's Armoured Fighting Vehicles 2019-2020 Leopard\"/>\n\nPrimarily for obstacle removal, two Rotzler hydraulic nine-tonne variable speed winches are fitted. These have 200 m of usable cable and can operate singularly or together at up to 90 m/minute, and are typically utilised to remove obstacles. The Kodiak can also provide electrical or hydraulic power for external equipment such as work lights and [[hand tools]].<ref name=\"AEV 3 Kodiak\"/>\n\nFor [[self-defence]], a manually or [[Remote controlled weapon station|remotely operated weapon station]] can be fitted to the AEV 3 Kodiak. Armament options range from a 5.56&nbsp;mm [[light machine gun]] to a 40&nbsp;mm [[grenade launcher]]. Swedish vehicles are fitted with the Kongsberg Protector Nordic ROWS, armed with a 12.7&nbsp;mm M2 heavy machine gun and includes the Kongsberg VIS 95 day camera with a 95\u00b0 FOV and the 850&nbsp;nm Kongsberg Infrared Aim Laser.

Jessica Jackley worked at the school and invited Matt Flannery to attend the presentation; this was the first time  Flannery had heard of microfinance, but it served as a \"call to action\" for Jackley. Soon after, Jackley began working as a consultant for the nonprofit [[Village Enterprise]], which worked to help start small businesses in [[East Africa]]. While Flannery was visiting Jackley in Africa, the two spent time interviewing entrepreneurs about the problems they faced in starting ventures and found the lack of access to start-up capital was a common theme. After returning from Africa, the two began developing their plan for a microfinance project that would grow into Kiva, which means \"unity\" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Flannery | first1 = M. | title = Kiva and the Birth of Person-to-Person Microfinance | journal = Innovations: Technology, Governance, Globalization | volume = 2 | pages = 31\u201356 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1162/itgg.2007.2.1-2.31}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Narang |first1=Sonia |year=2006 |title=Web-Based Microfinancing |journal=New York Times Magazine  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/magazine/10section4.t-6.html?ex=1323406800&en=72e9b0bb93393330&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss |accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2005, Kiva's first seven loans were funded, totaling $3,500, and the original entrepreneurs were subsequently deemed the \"Dream Team.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiva.org/about/history| title=History| publisher=Kiva.org| accessdate=5 April 2012}}</ref> By September 2005, the entrepreneurs repaid the entirety of their original loans, and the founders realized they had developed a sustainable microcredit concept. After the success of Kiva's initial stage, Flannery and Jackley founded Kiva as a non-profit. In 2006, notable entrepreneurs and businessmen joined Kiva's staff, including [[Premal Shah]] from PayPal and [[Reid Hoffman]], CEO and founder of [[LinkedIn]]. Shortly after its first anniversary in October 2006, Kiva reached $1 million in facilitated loans and acquired its twentieth field partner.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} To the present day, Kiva has continued to grow and expand its field partners while acquiring support from the media and the public.\n\n== Lending process ==\nKiva works with more than 300 [[microfinance]] institutions, social impact businesses, schools and non-profit organizations around the world, called \"Field Partners,\" that post profiles of qualified local entrepreneurs on the Kiva website.

[[Patriarchy]] and a strict [[division of labor]] still dominate the societies of many [[developing countries]], and women often suffer the most from [[poverty]] because scarce resources are often allocated to a family's males, rather than its females.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/transnational/vol17_1/RJLee.pdf|title=The Microfinance Movement: Closing the Gender Gap with a Click|author=Jackson Lee, Ruth|accessdate=1 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn their non-fiction book ''[[Half the Sky]]'', [[Nicholas D. Kristof]] and [[Sheryl WuDunn]] highlight Kiva's work along with that of some field partner organizations, such as the Kashf Foundation in [[Pakistan]]. With microloans, women gain spending power and spend less on instant gratification vices like alcohol and drugs. With extra income, they are able to educate their children, renovate their residences, or buy modern technologies and medicines. Along with economic power, a woman with a microloan often gains more independence and respect from her husband. Kristof and WuDunn note that microfinance can be a risky path out of poverty. \"[Paying back the loan with interest] is fine when the money is pumped into a profitable new business, but if the money isn't invested soundly, then the borrowers become trapped in mounting debts.\" Nonetheless, the authors endorse Kiva and similar microfinance efforts, writing that \"microfinance has done more to bolster the status of women, and to protect them from abuse, than any laws could accomplish.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Half the Sky|url=https://archive.org/details/halfsky00nich|url-access=registration|authors=Kristof, Nicholas D., Sheryl WuDunn|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|year=2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Green loans ===\nIn 2011, Kiva added a new category of loans to help borrowers move to cleaner and safer forms of energy, green agriculture, transport and recycling.<ref>{{cite web|last=Byrne|first=Ciara|title=Micro-lending site Kiva goes green|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/04/22/micro-lending-site-kiva-goes-green/|publisher=Venturebeat}}</ref> Green Kiva loans help fund solar panels, organic fertilizers, high-efficiency stoves, [[drip irrigation]] systems, and biofuels.

Instead, Kiva Zip partners with local institutions called Trustees, who vet loan applicants, provide mentorship, and may post profiles and updates on their behalf.  Currently, Kiva Zip borrowers do not pay any interest or fees.  Lenders are protected from currency risk but do not earn interest.  Kiva Zip is considered an experimental platform, and offers loans in the United States and in Kenya.

Since then, the system has changed, so that loans are disbursed to borrowers before their stories are posted to Kiva's website.<ref name=\"cgdev\">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php |title=Kiva Is Not Quite What It Seems |last=Roodman |first=David |date=2 October 2009 |publisher=Center for Global Development |accessdate=16 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118075941/http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php |archive-date=January 18, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Confusion on Where Money Lent via Kiva Goes |first=Stephanie |last=Strom |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=Kiva&st=cse |newspaper=New York Times |date=8 November 2009 |accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref> Disbursing loans sooner has a positive impact on the borrowers, who no longer need to wait weeks to receive their funding and can thus take advantage of time-sensitive business opportunities. This is disclosed on Kiva's site; each loan proposal states whether funds were pre-disbursed. Thus, lenders' loan funds are likely to go to borrowers other than those chosen by the lenders.<ref name=\"cgdev\"/> However, since the pay-back behaviour of the specific borrower chosen by the lender ''does'' influence whether or not the lender gets their funds back (except when an MFI has chosen to cover for borrower defaults), there is at least some connection between the lender and the specific borrower. Whether lenders' preferences are used for lender preference trend analysis by any field partners or Kiva is not stated. Kiva's response has been to keep pre-disbursing but be clearer about the process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/matt-flannery-kiva-ceo-and-co-founder-replies.php |title=Matt Flannery, Kiva CEO and Co-Founder, Replies |last=Flannery |first=Matt |date=12 October 2009 |publisher=Center for Global Development |accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Full-repayment frequency uncertainty===\n\nWhether defaults are extremely low has been questioned on the ground that a field partner may pay Kiva for loans defaulted to the field partner in order to maintain the field partner's good credit with Kiva.<ref name=\"cgdev\"/> Whether [[interest rate]]s collected by field partners are enough to pay for significant defaults depends on local economic conditions for each field partner.\n\n===Controversial loans===\n\nIn 2008, Kiva featured the borrowing profile of a Peruvian woman asking for a loan to buy equipment for her [[cockfighting]] business.<ref name=\"bloodsports_flannery_blog_post\">{{cite web|url=http://www.socialedge.org/blogs/kiva-chronicles/topics/cockfighting|title=Cockfighting|last=Flannery|first=Matt|authorlink=|date=29 March 2008|work=|publisher=[[Skoll Foundation]]|doi=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506203625/http://www.socialedge.org/blogs/kiva-chronicles/topics/cockfighting|archive-date=2008-05-06|accessdate=15 September 2010|coauthors=}}</ref><ref name=\"bloodsports_sfweekly\">\n{{Cite news\n  | last = Smiley\n  | first = Lauren\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Kiva's Microloans Underwriting Cockfighting in Peru\n  | newspaper = SF Weekly\n  | location = San Francisco\n  | pages =\n  | language =\n  | publisher =\n  | date =27 February 2008\n  | url = http://www.sfweekly.com/2008-02-27/news/kiva-s-micro-loans-underwriting-cockfighting-in-peru/\n  | accessdate =15 September 2010 }}</ref> This sparked debate among the Kiva Lending Community about the principles of the organization, and many complained that the organization was promoting cruelty to animals. Matt Flannery responded to the debate by providing an overview of the legal issues surrounding the debate, and took a more relativist stance. Flannery wrote on Socialedge.org \u2014 a blog site designed to connect entrepreneurs for social benefit \u2014\n\n<blockquote>I think that allowing our partner to decide which loans to post without much interference is a good thing. We can be paternalistic when we start imposing our moral framework upon societies half a world away. Cockfighting in Peru is legal and part of a rich cultural tradition. It may not be humane or palatable from a Western perspective, but that misses the point. Kiva, the organization, should not be making those decisions. Our lenders should be the ones voting with their dollars.<ref name=\"bloodsports_flannery_blog_post\"/></blockquote>\n\nThis position has caused some lenders to pull their funds (often moving them to other microfinance sites such as [[United Prosperity (organisation)|United Prosperity]], [[Zidisha]].org, [[Wokai]], [[Energy in Common]], etc.). Others who wanted to continue to lend through Kiva created \"Kivans Against Cockfighting Loans\" in May 2009, and, as of June 8, 2012, it has lent $15,625 to borrowers pursuing projects that do not involve the harming of animals.<ref name=\"bloodsports_kacl_team\">\n{{cite web\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Kivans Against Cockfighting Loans\n  | work =\n  | publisher =\n  | date =\n  | url = http://www.kiva.org/team/kacl\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =8 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy regarding Strathmore University and Opus Dei===\n\nIn Spring 2013, one of Kiva's field partners, [[Strathmore University]], posted many large loans to cover full tuitions for students from low-income regions in Kenya who could not otherwise afford higher education.  Kiva also established a field office on the Strathmore campus.  Shortly after, many lenders raised concerns because Strathmore University is a corporate undertaking of [[Opus Dei]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.strathmore.edu/en/about-strathmore/opus-dei|title=Strathmore University - Opus Dei |publisher=Strathmore University |accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref> This spawned a debate in the Kiva forums, leading to an open letter from Kiva's CEO Matt Flannery addressing the issue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pages.kiva.org/kivablog/2013/08/28/an-open-letter-about-kiva-and-strathmore|title=An Open Letter About Kiva and Strathmore |publisher=Kiva.org |accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Promotions and marketing strategies ==\n\nIn March 2012, [[Reid Hoffman]], LinkedIn's co-founder, lent Kiva $1 million. Kiva then allowed 40,000 people to lend $25 for \"free.\" Lenders still choose a borrower, but the borrower will pay back Hoffman instead of the lender who chose them. Kiva hopes that the \"free\" users will lend to more of their projects, and thus increase their overall user base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/03/15/725000-loans-granted-by-kiva-2-6-billion-to-go/|title=725,000 Loans Granted By Kiva, 2.6 Billion To Go|author=Pan, Joann|publisher=Mashable Business|accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn his 2007 book ''[[Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World]]'', Bill Clinton covers Kiva.org and the work the organization is currently doing and has done in the past.\n\n== External reviews ==\n\nThe following independent entities have reviewed Kiva.\n\n* On October 1, 2019, charity evaluator [[Charity Navigator]] downgraded Kiva from 4 (out of 4) to 3 stars;

Jessica Jackley worked at the school and invited Matt Flannery to attend the presentation; this was the first time  Flannery had heard of microfinance, but it served as a \"call to action\" for Jackley. Soon after, Jackley began working as a consultant for the nonprofit [[Village Enterprise]], which worked to help start small businesses in [[East Africa]]. While Flannery was visiting Jackley in Africa, the two spent time interviewing entrepreneurs about the problems they faced in starting ventures and found the lack of access to start-up capital was a common theme. After returning from Africa, the two began developing their plan for a microfinance project that would grow into Kiva, which means \"unity\" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Flannery | first1 = M. | title = Kiva and the Birth of Person-to-Person Microfinance | journal = Innovations: Technology, Governance, Globalization | volume = 2 | pages = 31\u201356 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1162/itgg.2007.2.1-2.31}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Narang |first1=Sonia |year=2006 |title=Web-Based Microfinancing |journal=New York Times Magazine  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/magazine/10section4.t-6.html?ex=1323406800&en=72e9b0bb93393330&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss |accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2005, Kiva's first seven loans were funded, totaling $3,500, and the original entrepreneurs were subsequently deemed the \"Dream Team.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiva.org/about/history| title=History| publisher=Kiva.org| accessdate=5 April 2012}}</ref> By September 2005, the entrepreneurs repaid the entirety of their original loans, and the founders realized they had developed a sustainable microcredit concept. After the success of Kiva's initial stage, Flannery and Jackley founded Kiva as a non-profit. In 2006, notable entrepreneurs and businessmen joined Kiva's staff, including [[Premal Shah]] from PayPal and [[Reid Hoffman]], CEO and founder of [[LinkedIn]]. Shortly after its first anniversary in October 2006, Kiva reached $1 million in facilitated loans and acquired its twentieth field partner.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} To the present day, Kiva has continued to grow and expand its field partners while acquiring support from the media and the public.\n\n== Lending process ==\nKiva works with more than 300 [[microfinance]] institutions, social impact businesses, schools and non-profit organizations around the world, called \"Field Partners,\" that post profiles of qualified local entrepreneurs on the Kiva website. Lenders browse borrower profiles on kiva.org and choose an entrepreneur they wish to fund.

Kristof]] and [[Sheryl WuDunn]] highlight Kiva's work along with that of some field partner organizations, such as the Kashf Foundation in [[Pakistan]]. With microloans, women gain spending power and spend less on instant gratification vices like alcohol and drugs. With extra income, they are able to educate their children, renovate their residences, or buy modern technologies and medicines. Along with economic power, a woman with a microloan often gains more independence and respect from her husband. Kristof and WuDunn note that microfinance can be a risky path out of poverty. \"[Paying back the loan with interest] is fine when the money is pumped into a profitable new business, but if the money isn't invested soundly, then the borrowers become trapped in mounting debts.\" Nonetheless, the authors endorse Kiva and similar microfinance efforts, writing that \"microfinance has done more to bolster the status of women, and to protect them from abuse, than any laws could accomplish.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Half the Sky|url=https://archive.org/details/halfsky00nich|url-access=registration|authors=Kristof, Nicholas D., Sheryl WuDunn|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|year=2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Green loans ===\nIn 2011, Kiva added a new category of loans to help borrowers move to cleaner and safer forms of energy, green agriculture, transport and recycling.<ref>{{cite web|last=Byrne|first=Ciara|title=Micro-lending site Kiva goes green|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/04/22/micro-lending-site-kiva-goes-green/|publisher=Venturebeat}}</ref> Green Kiva loans help fund solar panels, organic fertilizers, high-efficiency stoves, [[drip irrigation]] systems, and biofuels.

Kiva Zip transfers funds directly to borrowers without outsourcing disbursements and repayment collection to field partners.  Instead, Kiva Zip partners with local institutions called Trustees, who vet loan applicants, provide mentorship, and may post profiles and updates on their behalf.  Currently, Kiva Zip borrowers do not pay any interest or fees.  Lenders are protected from currency risk but do not earn interest.  Kiva Zip is considered an experimental platform, and offers loans in the United States and in Kenya.  In the future, it hopes to expand to other locations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://zip.kiva.org/faq# |title=Kiva Zip: FAQ|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref>  Kiva Zip's repayment rate is 89.4%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://zip.kiva.org/|title=Kiva Zip: Innovations in Person-to-Person Lending|accessdate=26 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142613/https://zip.kiva.org/|archive-date=April 28, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Interest rates by field partner====\n\nAs of November 2018, there are a total of 332 field partners listed on the Kiva website and their status is as follows: 173 Active, 41 Inactive, 14 Paused, and 104 Experimental.

Since then, the system has changed, so that loans are disbursed to borrowers before their stories are posted to Kiva's website.<ref name=\"cgdev\">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php |title=Kiva Is Not Quite What It Seems |last=Roodman |first=David |date=2 October 2009 |publisher=Center for Global Development |accessdate=16 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118075941/http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php |archive-date=January 18, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Confusion on Where Money Lent via Kiva Goes |first=Stephanie |last=Strom |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=Kiva&st=cse |newspaper=New York Times |date=8 November 2009 |accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref> Disbursing loans sooner has a positive impact on the borrowers, who no longer need to wait weeks to receive their funding and can thus take advantage of time-sensitive business opportunities. This is disclosed on Kiva's site; each loan proposal states whether funds were pre-disbursed. Thus, lenders' loan funds are likely to go to borrowers other than those chosen by the lenders.<ref name=\"cgdev\"/> However, since the pay-back behaviour of the specific borrower chosen by the lender ''does'' influence whether or not the lender gets their funds back (except when an MFI has chosen to cover for borrower defaults), there is at least some connection between the lender and the specific borrower. Whether lenders' preferences are used for lender preference trend analysis by any field partners or Kiva is not stated. Kiva's response has been to keep pre-disbursing but be clearer about the process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/matt-flannery-kiva-ceo-and-co-founder-replies.php |title=Matt Flannery, Kiva CEO and Co-Founder, Replies |last=Flannery |first=Matt |date=12 October 2009 |publisher=Center for Global Development |accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Full-repayment frequency uncertainty===\n\nWhether defaults are extremely low has been questioned on the ground that a field partner may pay Kiva for loans defaulted to the field partner in order to maintain the field partner's good credit with Kiva.<ref name=\"cgdev\"/> Whether [[interest rate]]s collected by field partners are enough to pay for significant defaults depends on local economic conditions for each field partner.\n\n===Controversial loans===\n\nIn 2008, Kiva featured the borrowing profile of a Peruvian woman asking for a loan to buy equipment for her [[cockfighting]] business.<ref name=\"bloodsports_flannery_blog_post\">{{cite web|url=http://www.socialedge.org/blogs/kiva-chronicles/topics/cockfighting|title=Cockfighting|last=Flannery|first=Matt|authorlink=|date=29 March 2008|work=|publisher=[[Skoll Foundation]]|doi=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506203625/http://www.socialedge.org/blogs/kiva-chronicles/topics/cockfighting|archive-date=2008-05-06|accessdate=15 September 2010|coauthors=}}</ref><ref name=\"bloodsports_sfweekly\">\n{{Cite news\n  | last = Smiley\n  | first = Lauren\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Kiva's Microloans Underwriting Cockfighting in Peru\n  | newspaper = SF Weekly\n  | location = San Francisco\n  | pages =\n  | language =\n  | publisher =\n  | date =27 February 2008\n  | url = http://www.sfweekly.com/2008-02-27/news/kiva-s-micro-loans-underwriting-cockfighting-in-peru/\n  | accessdate =15 September 2010 }}</ref> This sparked debate among the Kiva Lending Community about the principles of the organization, and many complained that the organization was promoting cruelty to animals. Matt Flannery responded to the debate by providing an overview of the legal issues surrounding the debate, and took a more relativist stance. Flannery wrote on Socialedge.org \u2014 a blog site designed to connect entrepreneurs for social benefit \u2014\n\n<blockquote>I think that allowing our partner to decide which loans to post without much interference is a good thing. We can be paternalistic when we start imposing our moral framework upon societies half a world away. Cockfighting in Peru is legal and part of a rich cultural tradition. It may not be humane or palatable from a Western perspective, but that misses the point. Kiva, the organization, should not be making those decisions. Our lenders should be the ones voting with their dollars.<ref name=\"bloodsports_flannery_blog_post\"/></blockquote>\n\nThis position has caused some lenders to pull their funds (often moving them to other microfinance sites such as [[United Prosperity (organisation)|United Prosperity]], [[Zidisha]].org, [[Wokai]], [[Energy in Common]], etc.). Others who wanted to continue to lend through Kiva created \"Kivans Against Cockfighting Loans\" in May 2009, and, as of June 8, 2012, it has lent $15,625 to borrowers pursuing projects that do not involve the harming of animals.<ref name=\"bloodsports_kacl_team\">\n{{cite web\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Kivans Against Cockfighting Loans\n  | work =\n  | publisher =\n  | date =\n  | url = http://www.kiva.org/team/kacl\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =8 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy regarding Strathmore University and Opus Dei===\n\nIn Spring 2013, one of Kiva's field partners, [[Strathmore University]], posted many large loans to cover full tuitions for students from low-income regions in Kenya who could not otherwise afford higher education.  Kiva also established a field office on the Strathmore campus.  Shortly after, many lenders raised concerns because Strathmore University is a corporate undertaking of [[Opus Dei]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.strathmore.edu/en/about-strathmore/opus-dei|title=Strathmore University - Opus Dei |publisher=Strathmore University |accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref> This spawned a debate in the Kiva forums, leading to an open letter from Kiva's CEO Matt Flannery addressing the issue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pages.kiva.org/kivablog/2013/08/28/an-open-letter-about-kiva-and-strathmore|title=An Open Letter About Kiva and Strathmore |publisher=Kiva.org |accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Promotions and marketing strategies ==\n\nIn March 2012, [[Reid Hoffman]], LinkedIn's co-founder, lent Kiva $1 million. Kiva then allowed 40,000 people to lend $25 for \"free.\" Lenders still choose a borrower, but the borrower will pay back Hoffman instead of the lender who chose them. Kiva hopes that the \"free\" users will lend to more of their projects, and thus increase their overall user base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/03/15/725000-loans-granted-by-kiva-2-6-billion-to-go/|title=725,000 Loans Granted By Kiva, 2.6 Billion To Go|author=Pan, Joann|publisher=Mashable Business|accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn his 2007 book ''[[Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World]]'', Bill Clinton covers Kiva.org and the work the organization is currently doing and has done in the past.\n\n== External reviews ==\n\nThe following independent entities have reviewed Kiva.\n\n* On October 1, 2019, charity evaluator [[Charity Navigator]] downgraded Kiva from 4 (out of 4) to 3 stars;

Linehan was one of the writers interviewed by [[Charlie Brooker]] in a special interview episode of the fifth series of ''Brooker's [[Screenwipe]]'' programme, and again on ''Brooker's [[Gameswipe]]'' in 2010.

This documentary explored the art, craft and deeply competitive business of creating contemporary television comedy. The programme features interviews with several of the UK's most successful television comedy writers and performers including [[Steve Coogan]], [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]], [[David Walliams]], [[Paul Whitehouse]], [[Griff Rhys Jones]] and [[Ardal O'Hanlon]], all of whom have worked with Linehan. It was directed by Adrian McCarthy and produced by Martha O'Neill and Adam Rynne. In 2011, Linehan also appeared with several members of the cast in [[Channel 4]]'s ''Father Ted Night'', an evening of the writer's favourite episodes and two retrospective documentaries.\n\n===Radio appearances===\n\nOn 6 June 2011, Linehan appeared on BBC Radio 4's ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme to discuss [[The Ladykillers (play)|his adaptation]] of the Ealing comedy film ''[[The Ladykillers]]'' for the West End stage. During this appearance, Linehan took issue with ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' presenter [[Justin Webb]] over what he saw as the attempted staging of an artificial argument between himself and the critic [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]]. He later expanded on this criticism in an article published in ''[[The Guardian]]'', saying \"I'm talking about that very specific, very artificial, very ''Today'' programme format of a presenter acting as referee between two people who have been chosen to represent the opposing sides of a manufactured argument. It is a binary view of politics, of life and, as a result, it is also a dishonest one. Replace it with anything \u2013 anything \u2013 because anything would be better\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/08/today-programme-the-ladykillers-graham-linehan | work=The Guardian | first=Graham | last=Linehan | title=Graham Linehan: My Today programme ambush | date=8 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Other work===\nLinehan's children voiced characters in the 2012 ''[[Adventure Time]]'' episode \"[[Goliad (Adventure Time)|Goliad]]\", with Linehan directing the children while taking the producers' instructions over the phone.

He was the child of [[Charles Bradley (preacher)|Charles Bradley]], an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] preacher, and Emma Linton, Charles's second wife. [[A. C. Bradley]] was his brother. Educated at [[Cheltenham College]] and [[Marlborough College]], he read, as a teenager, some of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. In 1865, he entered [[University College, Oxford]]. In 1870, he was elected to a fellowship at Oxford's [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]] where he remained until his death in 1924. Bradley is buried in Holywell Cemetery in Oxford.\n\nDuring his life, Bradley was a respected philosopher and was granted honorary degrees many times. He was the first British philosopher to be awarded the [[Order of Merit]]. His fellowship at Merton College did not carry any teaching assignments and thus he was free to continue to write. He was famous for his non-[[Epistemological pluralism|pluralistic]] approach to [[philosophy]]. His outlook saw a [[Monism|monistic]] unity, transcending divisions between [[logic]], [[metaphysics]] and [[ethics]].  Consistently, his own view combined monism with absolute idealism. Although Bradley did not think of himself as a [[Hegelian]] philosopher, his own unique brand of philosophy was inspired by, and contained elements of, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s dialectical method.\n\n==Philosophy==\nBradley rejected the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] and [[empiricism|empiricist]] trends in English philosophy represented by [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Instead, Bradley was a leading member of the [[philosophical movement]] known as [[British idealism]], which was strongly influenced by Kant and the [[German idealism|German idealists]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Johann Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]], and Hegel, although Bradley tended to downplay his influences.\n\nIn 1909, Bradley published an essay entitled \"On Truth and Coherence\" in the journal ''Mind'' (reprinted in ''[[Essays on Truth and Reality]]''). The essay criticises a form of [[Epistemology#Infallibilism, indefeasibility|infallibilist]] [[foundationalism]] in [[epistemology]].

British idealism was practically eliminated by [[G.E. Moore]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] in the early 1900s. Bradley was also famously criticised in [[A. J. Ayer]]'s logical positivist work ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'' for making statements that do not meet the requirements of positivist [[verification principle]]; e.g., statements such as \"The Absolute enters into, but is itself incapable of, evolution and progress.\"\nThere has in recent years, however, been a resurgence of interest in Bradley's and other idealist philosophers' work in the Anglo-American academic community.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mallinson|first1=Jane|title=T.S.
