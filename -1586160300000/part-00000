The use of the term '[[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]]' in much of the conceptualisation is largely based on the prevalent [[Malayisation|Malay cultural influence]], manifested in particular through the [[linguistic imperialism|spread of Malay language]] in [[Southeast Asia]] as observed by different colonial powers during the [[Age of Discovery]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ooi|2009|p=181}}</ref>\n\nThe concept in its broadest territorial stretch may apply to a region synonymous with [[Austronesia]], homeland to the [[Austronesian peoples]], that extends from [[Easter Island]] in the east to [[Madagascar]] in the west.<ref>{{harvnb|Farrer|2009|p=26}}</ref> Such description has its origin in the introduction of the term [[Malay race]] in the late 18th century that has been popularised by the [[orientalism|orientalists]] to describe the [[Austronesian peoples]]. In a narrower sense, the Malay world has been used as a synonym for Malay ''[[sprachraum]]'', referring to the Malay-speaking countries and territories of [[Southeast Asia]], where different standards of Malay are the [[national language|national languages]] or a variety of it is an important minority language. The term in this sense encompasses [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], Singapore and [[Southern Thailand]], and is sometimes used interchangeably with the concepts of '[[Malay Archipelago]]' and '[[Nusantara]]'.<ref>{{harvnb|Amin Sweeney|2011|p=295}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, modern scholars correct these extended notions of the Malay world, defining it as a political and [[cultural area]] instead. In this context, the Malay world is reduced to a region that is homeland to the [[Malay people]], historically ruled by different [[Sultan#Southeast and East Asia|Malay sultanates]], where various [[Malayan languages|Malay dialects]] and cultural values are predominant. This area includes the [[Malay Peninsula]], the coastal areas of [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]] and the smaller islands in between.<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|1982|p=112}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Benjamin|Chou|2002|p=7}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Wee|1985|pp=61\u201362}}</ref> \n\nThe most notable use of the concept was in the early 20th century, embraced in an [[irredentism|irredentist]] fashion, by the [[Early Malay nationalism|Malay nationalists]] in the form of '[[Greater Indonesia|Greater Malaya]]' (''Melayu Raya''), as an aspiration for the \"natural\" or desired borders of a modern nation for the [[Malay race]].\n\nMalay culture has also had an impact on cultures outside of the traditional Malay world most notably in [[Sri Lanka]] and on the cuisine of [[Thailand]].

''Tanah Melayu'' in the text is consistently employed to refer to the area under Melakan dominance.<ref>{{harvnb|Reid|2010|p=95}}</ref> In the early 16th century, Tom\u00e9 Pires coins an almost similar term, ''Terra de Tana Malaio'' for the southeastern part of Sumatra, where the deposed Sultan of Melaka, [[Mahmud Shah of Malacca|Mahmud Shah]] established his exiled government.\n\n{{quote box|salign=right|align=left|width=35%\n|quote=''\"...&nbsp;the country which Europeans denominate the Malay Peninsula, and which, by the natives themselves, is called 'the land of the Malays' ('Tanah Melayu'), has, from its appearing to be wholly occupied by that people, been generally considered as their original country&nbsp;...\"''\n|source = \u2013 [[John Crawfurd]], 1820<ref>{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=211}}</ref>}}\n\nThe application of ''Tanah Melayu'' to the [[Malay Peninsula]] entered into the European authorship, when [[William Marsden (orientalist)|Marsden]] and [[John Crawfurd|Crawfurd]] noted it in their historical works published in 1811 and 1820 respectively. Another important term, the ''Malaya'', an English term for the Peninsula, was already used in English writings from the early 18th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=211}}</ref>\n\nDue to the lack of available research, it is difficult to trace the development of the concept of the Malay world as a term which later refers to the Archipelago. However, above early territorial identifications are believed to have formed an important antecedent for the future conceptualisation of the Malay world.<ref>{{harvnb|Andaya|2008|p=46}}</ref>\n\n===Malay as a racial category===\n{{main|Malay race}}\nThe broader concept of Malay world has its origin from the conceptualisation of Malay as a race by the German scientist [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]]. Blumenbach identified 'Malay' as a subcategory of both the [[Ethiopid race|Ethiopid]] and [[Mongoloid]] races, and expanded the term to include the native inhabitants of the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]], the [[Philippines]], the [[Maluku Islands|Malukus]], [[Sunda Islands|Sundas]], [[Indochina]], as well as [[Pacific Island]]s like the [[Tahiti]]ans. This broad conception of Malay was largely derived from the strong presence of [[Malayisation|Malay cultural influence]], particularly in linguistic, throughout the Southeast Asia at the time of European colonisation.<ref>{{harvnb|Ooi|2009|p=181}}</ref> Malay language was one aspect of the prestige of the Malay sultanates, and considered as a language of the learned in Southeast Asia in the 17th and 18th century comments. An 18th century European account even suggests that one is not considered a very broadly educated man in the east, if he don't understand Malay.<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|2010|p=81}}</ref>\n\nThe popularisation of Malay as a racial category was in essence a colonial product, the significant role of which played by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] since the 17th century and that of the [[British Empire|British]] since the 18th century in identifying [[Maritime Southeast Asia|the Archipelago]] as the Malay world. The view held by [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]] for example, had a significant influence on English-speakers, lasting to the present day. He should probably be regarded as the most important voice in projecting the idea of a 'Malay' race or nation, not limited to the traditional [[Malay rulers|Raja-Raja Melayu]] or even their supporters, but embracing a large if unspecified part of the Archipelago.<ref>{{harvnb|Reid|2001|pp=296\u2013313}}</ref> [[William Marsden (orientalist)|William Marsden]], another British \"merchant-scientist\", classified the inhabitants of the Archipelago as Malays, based on religion ([[Islam]]), language ([[Malay language|Malay]]) and origin.<ref>{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=212}}</ref>\n\n===Malay territoriality in three tiers===\nIn the late 19th century, an important innovation was introduced into the political vocabulary of the [[Malay language]]. The word ''kerajaan'', which had in older times usually meant \"king\", \"royalty\" and \"kingdom\", began to be defined as \"government\". In the same period, the term ''negeri'' was increasingly being used as a word equivalent to \"state\", in contrast to its earlier use in court texts more in the sense of a 'settlement' than of a political entity. With growing frequency, publications of the 1870s and 1880s employed the term to refer either to individual [[Malay sultanate]]s or any political state in the world beyond the Malay territories.<ref>{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=211}}</ref>\n\nBritish historian, [[Richard James Wilkinson|Wilkinson]], prefers the term \"state\" to refer to an administrative or territorial unit in the Malay Peninsula in his time, while he uses the word \"kingdom\" or \"sultanate\" for a Malay polity of older times. While Wilkinson often uses \"the Peninsula\" or \"the Malay Peninsula\", he also calls the Peninsula \"[[British Malaya|Malaya]].\" His use of the word \"Malaya\" occasionally includes not merely the Peninsula under British rule but also its other parts under [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese rule]]. In referring to [[Maritime Southeast Asia|the Archipelago]], Wilkinson not only uses \"the Archipelago\" or \"the Indian Archipelago\", but also \"the Malay world\", which might have more sociocultural connotations.<ref>{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=212}}</ref>\n\nAmong the textbooks available during [[British Malaya|colonial Malaya]], [[Richard Olaf Winstedt|Winstedt]]'s ''Ilmu Alam Melayu'' ('Geography of the Malay world') presents the clearest picture of the territoriality of the Malay community. As expressed in the title, Winstedt attempts to cover most of the Archipelago. He describes not only the British colonies and protectorates in the Malay Peninsula and Borneo, but also the [[Netherlands East Indies]] and the [[Philippines]]. The structure of ''Ilmu Alam Melayu'' shows the three-tiered constitution of the Malay world. The Malay world (''Alam Melayu'') is divided into sub-regions, namely, Malaya (''Tanah Melayu''), the [[British Borneo]] territories, the Netherlands East Indies and the Philippines. Malaya, in turn, is made up of the [[Malay states]] (''Negeri-Negeri Melayu''). It is also important to note the standardization of geographical knowledge in this geography textbook. All states in the Peninsula, the main islands and areas of the Netherlands East Indies and all of the Philippines are systematically discussed through the common topics of overview, districts and towns, products, inhabitants and history. Such a systematic and comprehensive catalogue of geographical knowledge helps to convey an image of the Malay world as a territorial entity.<ref>{{harvnb|Soda|2001|pp=213\u2013214}}</ref>\n\nMalay historian Abdul Hadi Haji Hassan, who cites Winstedt's textbooks in his ''Sejarah 'Alam Melayu'' ('History of the Malay world'), had much in common with Winstedt's view of the Malay world. For Abdul Hadi, too, the Malay territories are made up of the Malay states, Malaya and the Malay world. Of the 12 chapters in the three volumes of Abdul Hadi's textbook, four chapters focus on the history of the [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] in Malaya, while other chapters deal with the history of the Malays in both Malaya and other parts of the Malay world. It ought to be added that the history of each colony or state (''negeri'') in the [[Straits Settlements]] and the [[Federated Malay States]] is explained in the fourth and the fifth volumes of the book written by another Malay historian, [[Buyong Adil]] in 1934 and 1940. Thus, both British and Malay authors conceptualised Malay territoriality in three tiers, that is, the [[Malay states]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and the Malay world.<ref>{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=214}}</ref>\n\n===Malay nationalism===\n{{main|Malay nationalism}}\nThe standardisation of geographical knowledge and systematic quantification, served to objectify the territoriality of the Malay community. Early authors in Malaya also developed a Malaya-centric view on the subject, proclaiming Malaya or ''Tanah Melayu'' as the focal point of the Malay territories. This view reflected the substantialisation of the colonial territorial boundary and provided new objectification of space seems to have played an important role in conceiving a potential national territory. It is probable that these three territorial identities, namely, Malay states, Malaya and the Malay world had much to do with the strands of [[Malay nationalism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=229}}</ref>\n\nOn the one hand, in the late 1930s, Malay aristocrats and their supporters began to organize Malay state associations. For them, Malay states were the focus of territorial identity. In postwar Malaya, these state-based Malay associations were dissolved into a Malaya-based Malay political party, that is, the [[United Malays National Organisation]]. Their territorial identity was gradually shifted from Malay states to Malaya or ''[[Persekutuan Tanah Melayu|Tanah Melayu]]''. On the other hand, in the late 1930s, some Malay non-aristocrat intellectuals formed a pan-Malay-oriented association, that is, [[Kesatuan Melayu Muda]] or Young Malay Union. As shown by its President, [[Ibrahim Hj Yaacob]], the territorial stretch of their imagined homeland covered the Malay world or the [[Malay Archipelago]] as a whole.<ref>{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=229}}</ref>\n\n==Modern conception==\nAlthough the extended notions of Malay world still gained widespread currency, particularly in Malaysia, Singapore and the English-speaking world, such conceptualisation is sometimes described in other terms, perceived as more 'neutral', like [[Nusantara]], [[Indonesian archipelago]], and [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. New approaches have also been taken by modern authors to redefine the 'Malay world', by taking into account the historic political pattern of the region, in addition to the existing racial-linguistic spread model.\n\nIn this context, modern authors in Malay studies like [[Anthony Milner (historian)|Anthony Milner]], Geoffrey Benjamin, and Vivienne Wee provide a narrower definition, reducing the concept into a political and [[cultural area]]. Benjamin for example, describes the concept in an historically responsive manner to refer to the areas currently or formerly falling under ''Kerajaan Melayu'' ('Malay kingdoms'), the rule of a Malay king. It does not refer to [[Insular Southeast Asia]] at large, and certainly not the [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]]-speaking world as a whole, both of which are usages of Malay world that have crept into scholarly discourse. In this sense, the Malay world refers to various kingdoms and their attendant hinterlands that have existed or still exist along the coasts of [[Brunei]], the east coast of [[Sumatra]] and on the [[Malay peninsula]].<ref>{{harvnb|Benjamin|Chou|2002|p=7}}</ref>\n\nThis limited conceptualisation of Malay world was also espoused by Wee. She added further, that the concept is a spatial configuration that resulted from the serial patterning of political alliances, unified by ''[[Sejarah Melayu]]'', that is a particular genealogical tree of kingship. The other, non-Malay areas would be those where the rulers did not claim to belong to this particular genealogical tree. For example, [[Aceh]] is located on the northern tip of the Sumatran mainland, yet the rulers evidently did not claim to belong to the Malay genealogical tree. And indeed Aceh is generally not regarded as part of ''Alam Melayu''. On the contrary, both the indigenous and foreign texts indicate that Aceh, similar to [[Java]], was an historical enemy of ''Alam Melayu''. Hence to locate oneself within ''Alam Melayu'' is to claim membership in a specific network of political alliances.<ref>{{harvnb|Wee|1985|pp=63\u201365}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Malayness]]\n**[[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]]\n**[[Pribumi]]\n*[[Malayisation]]\n*[[Malay Archipelago]]\n*[[East Indies]]\n*[[Malay race]]\n*[[Maphilindo]]\n*[[Nusantara]]\n*[[Greater Indonesia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{citation|last=[[Amin Sweeney]]|title=Pucuk Gunung Es : Kelisanan dan Keberaksaraan Dalam Kebudayaan Melayu-Indonesia|publisher=Kepustakaan Populer Gramedia (KPG)|year=2011|location=Jakarta|isbn=978-979-9103-65-9}}\n*{{citation|last=Andaya|first=Leonard Y.|authorlink=Leonard Andaya|title=Leaves of the Same Tree: Trade and Ethnicity in the Straits of Melaka|publisher=University of Hawaii press|year=2008|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8248-3189-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/leavesofsametree0000anda}}\n*{{citation|last=Andaya|first=Barbara W.|authorlink=Barbara Watson Andaya|first2=Leonard Y.|last2=Andaya|authorlink2=Leonard Andaya|title=A History of Malaysia|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=1984|location=London|isbn=978-0-312-38121-9}}\n*{{citation |last=Barnard|first=Timothy P.|title=Contesting Malayness: Malay identity across boundaries|publisher=Singapore University press|year=2004|location=Singapore|isbn=9971-69-279-1}}\n*{{citation |last=Benjamin|first=Geoffrey|last2=Chou|first2=Cynthia|title=Tribal Communities in the Malay World: Historical, Cultural and Social Perspectives|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|year=2002|isbn=978-981-230-166-6}}\n*{{citation |last=Bunnell|first=Tim|title=From nation to networks and back again: Transnationalism, class and national identity in Malaysia|journal=State/Nation/Transnation: Perspectives on Transnationalism in the Asia Pacific|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=0-415-30279-X}}\n*{{citation |last=Esposito|first=John Louis|authorlink=John Esposito|title=The Oxford History of Islam|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9HUDXkJIE3EC&pg=PT841&dq=masuk+melayu#v=onepage|isbn=978-0-19-510799-9}}\n*{{citation |last=Farrer|first=Douglas.

Another important term, the ''Malaya'', an English term for the Peninsula, was already used in English writings from the early 18th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=211}}</ref>\n\nDue to the lack of available research, it is difficult to trace the development of the concept of the Malay world as a term which later refers to the Archipelago. However, above early territorial identifications are believed to have formed an important antecedent for the future conceptualisation of the Malay world.<ref>{{harvnb|Andaya|2008|p=46}}</ref>\n\n===Malay as a racial category===\n{{main|Malay race}}\nThe broader concept of Malay world has its origin from the conceptualisation of Malay as a race by the German scientist [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]]. Blumenbach identified 'Malay' as a subcategory of both the [[Ethiopid race|Ethiopid]] and [[Mongoloid]] races, and expanded the term to include the native inhabitants of the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]], the [[Philippines]], the [[Maluku Islands|Malukus]], [[Sunda Islands|Sundas]], [[Indochina]], as well as [[Pacific Island]]s like the [[Tahiti]]ans. This broad conception of Malay was largely derived from the strong presence of [[Malayisation|Malay cultural influence]], particularly in linguistic, throughout the Southeast Asia at the time of European colonisation.<ref>{{harvnb|Ooi|2009|p=181}}</ref> Malay language was one aspect of the prestige of the Malay sultanates, and considered as a language of the learned in Southeast Asia in the 17th and 18th century comments. An 18th century European account even suggests that one is not considered a very broadly educated man in the east, if he don't understand Malay.<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|2010|p=81}}</ref>\n\nThe popularisation of Malay as a racial category was in essence a colonial product, the significant role of which played by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] since the 17th century and that of the [[British Empire|British]] since the 18th century in identifying [[Maritime Southeast Asia|the Archipelago]] as the Malay world. The view held by [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]] for example, had a significant influence on English-speakers, lasting to the present day. He should probably be regarded as the most important voice in projecting the idea of a 'Malay' race or nation, not limited to the traditional [[Malay rulers|Raja-Raja Melayu]] or even their supporters, but embracing a large if unspecified part of the Archipelago.<ref>{{harvnb|Reid|2001|pp=296\u2013313}}</ref> [[William Marsden (orientalist)|William Marsden]], another British \"merchant-scientist\", classified the inhabitants of the Archipelago as Malays, based on religion ([[Islam]]), language ([[Malay language|Malay]]) and origin.<ref>{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=212}}</ref>\n\n===Malay territoriality in three tiers===\nIn the late 19th century, an important innovation was introduced into the political vocabulary of the [[Malay language]]. The word ''kerajaan'', which had in older times usually meant \"king\", \"royalty\" and \"kingdom\", began to be defined as \"government\". In the same period, the term ''negeri'' was increasingly being used as a word equivalent to \"state\", in contrast to its earlier use in court texts more in the sense of a 'settlement' than of a political entity. With growing frequency, publications of the 1870s and 1880s employed the term to refer either to individual [[Malay sultanate]]s or any political state in the world beyond the Malay territories.<ref>{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=211}}</ref>\n\nBritish historian, [[Richard James Wilkinson|Wilkinson]], prefers the term \"state\" to refer to an administrative or territorial unit in the Malay Peninsula in his time, while he uses the word \"kingdom\" or \"sultanate\" for a Malay polity of older times. While Wilkinson often uses \"the Peninsula\" or \"the Malay Peninsula\", he also calls the Peninsula \"[[British Malaya|Malaya]].\" His use of the word \"Malaya\" occasionally includes not merely the Peninsula under British rule but also its other parts under [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese rule]]. In referring to [[Maritime Southeast Asia|the Archipelago]], Wilkinson not only uses \"the Archipelago\" or \"the Indian Archipelago\", but also \"the Malay world\", which might have more sociocultural connotations.<ref>{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=212}}</ref>\n\nAmong the textbooks available during [[British Malaya|colonial Malaya]], [[Richard Olaf Winstedt|Winstedt]]'s ''Ilmu Alam Melayu'' ('Geography of the Malay world') presents the clearest picture of the territoriality of the Malay community. As expressed in the title, Winstedt attempts to cover most of the Archipelago. He describes not only the British colonies and protectorates in the Malay Peninsula and Borneo, but also the [[Netherlands East Indies]] and the [[Philippines]]. The structure of ''Ilmu Alam Melayu'' shows the three-tiered constitution of the Malay world. The Malay world (''Alam Melayu'') is divided into sub-regions, namely, Malaya (''Tanah Melayu''), the [[British Borneo]] territories, the Netherlands East Indies and the Philippines. Malaya, in turn, is made up of the [[Malay states]] (''Negeri-Negeri Melayu''). It is also important to note the standardization of geographical knowledge in this geography textbook. All states in the Peninsula, the main islands and areas of the Netherlands East Indies and all of the Philippines are systematically discussed through the common topics of overview, districts and towns, products, inhabitants and history. Such a systematic and comprehensive catalogue of geographical knowledge helps to convey an image of the Malay world as a territorial entity.<ref>{{harvnb|Soda|2001|pp=213\u2013214}}</ref>\n\nMalay historian Abdul Hadi Haji Hassan, who cites Winstedt's textbooks in his ''Sejarah 'Alam Melayu'' ('History of the Malay world'), had much in common with Winstedt's view of the Malay world. For Abdul Hadi, too, the Malay territories are made up of the Malay states, Malaya and the Malay world. Of the 12 chapters in the three volumes of Abdul Hadi's textbook, four chapters focus on the history of the [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] in Malaya, while other chapters deal with the history of the Malays in both Malaya and other parts of the Malay world. It ought to be added that the history of each colony or state (''negeri'') in the [[Straits Settlements]] and the [[Federated Malay States]] is explained in the fourth and the fifth volumes of the book written by another Malay historian, [[Buyong Adil]] in 1934 and 1940. Thus, both British and Malay authors conceptualised Malay territoriality in three tiers, that is, the [[Malay states]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and the Malay world.<ref>{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=214}}</ref>\n\n===Malay nationalism===\n{{main|Malay nationalism}}\nThe standardisation of geographical knowledge and systematic quantification, served to objectify the territoriality of the Malay community. Early authors in Malaya also developed a Malaya-centric view on the subject, proclaiming Malaya or ''Tanah Melayu'' as the focal point of the Malay territories. This view reflected the substantialisation of the colonial territorial boundary and provided new objectification of space seems to have played an important role in conceiving a potential national territory. It is probable that these three territorial identities, namely, Malay states, Malaya and the Malay world had much to do with the strands of [[Malay nationalism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=229}}</ref>\n\nOn the one hand, in the late 1930s, Malay aristocrats and their supporters began to organize Malay state associations. For them, Malay states were the focus of territorial identity. In postwar Malaya, these state-based Malay associations were dissolved into a Malaya-based Malay political party, that is, the [[United Malays National Organisation]]. Their territorial identity was gradually shifted from Malay states to Malaya or ''[[Persekutuan Tanah Melayu|Tanah Melayu]]''. On the other hand, in the late 1930s, some Malay non-aristocrat intellectuals formed a pan-Malay-oriented association, that is, [[Kesatuan Melayu Muda]] or Young Malay Union. As shown by its President, [[Ibrahim Hj Yaacob]], the territorial stretch of their imagined homeland covered the Malay world or the [[Malay Archipelago]] as a whole.<ref>{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=229}}</ref>\n\n==Modern conception==\nAlthough the extended notions of Malay world still gained widespread currency, particularly in Malaysia, Singapore and the English-speaking world, such conceptualisation is sometimes described in other terms, perceived as more 'neutral', like [[Nusantara]], [[Indonesian archipelago]], and [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. New approaches have also been taken by modern authors to redefine the 'Malay world', by taking into account the historic political pattern of the region, in addition to the existing racial-linguistic spread model.\n\nIn this context, modern authors in Malay studies like [[Anthony Milner (historian)|Anthony Milner]], Geoffrey Benjamin, and Vivienne Wee provide a narrower definition, reducing the concept into a political and [[cultural area]]. Benjamin for example, describes the concept in an historically responsive manner to refer to the areas currently or formerly falling under ''Kerajaan Melayu'' ('Malay kingdoms'), the rule of a Malay king. It does not refer to [[Insular Southeast Asia]] at large, and certainly not the [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]]-speaking world as a whole, both of which are usages of Malay world that have crept into scholarly discourse. In this sense, the Malay world refers to various kingdoms and their attendant hinterlands that have existed or still exist along the coasts of [[Brunei]], the east coast of [[Sumatra]] and on the [[Malay peninsula]].<ref>{{harvnb|Benjamin|Chou|2002|p=7}}</ref>\n\nThis limited conceptualisation of Malay world was also espoused by Wee. She added further, that the concept is a spatial configuration that resulted from the serial patterning of political alliances, unified by ''[[Sejarah Melayu]]'', that is a particular genealogical tree of kingship. The other, non-Malay areas would be those where the rulers did not claim to belong to this particular genealogical tree. For example, [[Aceh]] is located on the northern tip of the Sumatran mainland, yet the rulers evidently did not claim to belong to the Malay genealogical tree. And indeed Aceh is generally not regarded as part of ''Alam Melayu''. On the contrary, both the indigenous and foreign texts indicate that Aceh, similar to [[Java]], was an historical enemy of ''Alam Melayu''. Hence to locate oneself within ''Alam Melayu'' is to claim membership in a specific network of political alliances.<ref>{{harvnb|Wee|1985|pp=63\u201365}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Malayness]]\n**[[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]]\n**[[Pribumi]]\n*[[Malayisation]]\n*[[Malay Archipelago]]\n*[[East Indies]]\n*[[Malay race]]\n*[[Maphilindo]]\n*[[Nusantara]]\n*[[Greater Indonesia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{citation|last=[[Amin Sweeney]]|title=Pucuk Gunung Es : Kelisanan dan Keberaksaraan Dalam Kebudayaan Melayu-Indonesia|publisher=Kepustakaan Populer Gramedia (KPG)|year=2011|location=Jakarta|isbn=978-979-9103-65-9}}\n*{{citation|last=Andaya|first=Leonard Y.|authorlink=Leonard Andaya|title=Leaves of the Same Tree: Trade and Ethnicity in the Straits of Melaka|publisher=University of Hawaii press|year=2008|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8248-3189-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/leavesofsametree0000anda}}\n*{{citation|last=Andaya|first=Barbara W.|authorlink=Barbara Watson Andaya|first2=Leonard Y.|last2=Andaya|authorlink2=Leonard Andaya|title=A History of Malaysia|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=1984|location=London|isbn=978-0-312-38121-9}}\n*{{citation |last=Barnard|first=Timothy P.|title=Contesting Malayness: Malay identity across boundaries|publisher=Singapore University press|year=2004|location=Singapore|isbn=9971-69-279-1}}\n*{{citation |last=Benjamin|first=Geoffrey|last2=Chou|first2=Cynthia|title=Tribal Communities in the Malay World: Historical, Cultural and Social Perspectives|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|year=2002|isbn=978-981-230-166-6}}\n*{{citation |last=Bunnell|first=Tim|title=From nation to networks and back again: Transnationalism, class and national identity in Malaysia|journal=State/Nation/Transnation: Perspectives on Transnationalism in the Asia Pacific|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=0-415-30279-X}}\n*{{citation |last=Esposito|first=John Louis|authorlink=John Esposito|title=The Oxford History of Islam|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9HUDXkJIE3EC&pg=PT841&dq=masuk+melayu#v=onepage|isbn=978-0-19-510799-9}}\n*{{citation |last=Farrer|first=Douglas.

They set a time of 17 hours 48 minutes 30 seconds.\n\nIn 1986 Shields and Watson opened up an invitation to some fellow runners to race in the opposite direction, Fort William \u2013 Milngavie. 1987 saw a return to the established direction of running, South \u2013 North. Of eleven starters seven arrived in Fort William.

{"title_page": "Hair clipper", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=November 2010}}\n[[Image:BeardClipSqueeze.jpg|thumb|A manual beard clipper]]\nA '''hair clipper''' (often individually known by the apparent plural '''hair clippers''' in a similar way to ''scissors'') is a specialised [[tools|implement]] used to cut [[human]] [[head]] [[hair]]. They work on the same principle as [[scissor]]s, but are distinct from scissors themselves and [[razor]]s. Similar but heavier-duty implements are used to [[Sheep shearing|shear sheep]], but are called handpieces or [[Sheep shearing#Machine shears|machine shears]].\n\n==Operating principle==\nHair clippers comprise a pair of [[Sharpening|sharpened]] [[comb]]-like blades in close contact one above the other and the side which slide sideways relative to each other, a [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]] which may be manual or electrical to make the blades [[Oscillation|oscillate]] from side to side, and a handle. The clipper is moved so that hair is positioned between the teeth of the comb, and cut with a scissor action when one blade slides sideways relative to the other.

They have gradually displaced manual hair clippers in many countries.  Three different motor types are used in clipper production: magnetic, rotary and pivot.  Rotary style may be driven by direct current or alternating current electricity source.  Both magnetic and pivot style clippers use magnetic forces derived from winding copper wire around steel. Alternating current creates a cycle attracting and relaxing to a spring to create the speed and torque to drive the clipper cutter across the combing blade.\n\nLeo J. Wahl invented the first electric hair clipper. He first designed a hand-held massager for his uncle, Dr. Frank Wahl. Frank Wahl opened a manufacturing plant in [[Sterling, Illinois]] to produce and sell Leo\u2019s massager. During this time, Leo would sell massagers to various barbers and noticed an opportunity to improve upon the tools barbers were using at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wahl.com/about/|title=About Wahl|work=wahl.com|access-date=2014-04-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808235700/http://www.wahl.com/about|archive-date=2016-08-08|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nLeo Wahl took over his uncle\u2019s manufacturing business after Frank left to serve in the [[Spanish American War]] in 1898. Leo continued to work on his inventions and by 1921, he patented his final design of an invention more than a decade in the making- the first electric hair clipper. Within a year, Wahl Manufacturing had manufactured and sold thousands of clippers all over the United States and in 1921 Leo renamed the company the [[Wahl Clipper Corporation]].\nWhen Leo J. Wahl died on May 20, 1957 he had over 100 [[patent]] applications to his name. His descendants still operate the company today. Wahl Clipper is now an international industry leader in the manufacturing of products for the professional beauty and barber salon trade, consumer personal care and animal grooming.

Each major hair clipper manufacturer sells its own brand of hair clipper oil.  Clippers can also be maintained with aerosol clipper spray which acts as a coolant, disinfectant, lubricant, cleaner, and rust preventative. It is possible to find out what is inside such a product by viewing the product's [[safety data sheet]] online. Wahl Hair Clipper Oil, for example, is simply [[mineral oil]] packaged in a bottle with a dropper tip.\n\nMost consumer grade hair clippers use a vibrating motor that moves the blade at a high resonant frequency. Sometimes the motor will come out of tune and make a loud noise. There is a screw on the side that is used to retune the motor and bring it back into resonance. Turn the clipper off and rotate the screw counter-clockwise half a turn. Turn the clipper back on and the loud buzzing should have stopped, indicating the motor is back in resonance. No further tuning is needed. The motor will transfer maximum power to the blade at this setting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wahlpro.com/how-to-tune-your-wahl-vibrator-clipper/|title=How To Tune Your Wahl Vibrator Clipper.|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Blades===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Cutting blade type\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Oster Blade size\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Common guard size<ref>[https://www.menshairstylestoday.com/haircut-numbers/ Haircut Numbers \u2013 Hair Clipper Sizes]</ref>\n! colspan=\"3\" | Hair remaining\n\n|-\n!
