Later, VHS and DVD releases edited the 5-part stories together as single episodes, to total 89 episodes. The episode order is controversial because stories were often initially transmitted some years after the rest of the season to which they theoretically belonged, often forming part of a 'repeats season'. The US Region 1 DVD releases present the episodes in the UK broadcast order.\n\n== Series overview ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2| Series !! Episodes !! Episode length !! Premiere !!

Later, VHS and DVD releases edited the 5-part stories together as single episodes, to total 89 episodes. The episode order is controversial because stories were often initially transmitted some years after the rest of the season to which they theoretically belonged, often forming part of a 'repeats season'.

This series was the longest-lived with 45 episodes. VHS and DVD releases usually see these episodes edited together as one 25-minute episode, although in reality, these omnibus episodes run closer to 20 minutes as they lose David Jason's 'cliffhanger' narration over the \"To be continued...\" captions. On the VHS and DVD releases, the \"Episode 1\" suffix in the title card after the opening credits has often been left unaltered. The US DVD releases retain the original 5-min segment format. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:98%;\"\n! style=\"background: #fc3; color:#000000\" width=\"70\"|No. <br />overall !! style=\"background:#fc3; color:#000000\" width=\"70\"| No. <br />for series !! style=\"background: #fc3; color:#000000\"|Title !! style=\"background: #fc3; color:#000000\"  | Director !! style=\"background: #fc3; color:#000000\"  | Writer !!style=\"background: #fc3; color:#000000\" width=\"130\" | Original airdate\n \n{{Episode list\n|RTitle=''The Wild, Wild, Goose Chase''\n|AltTitle=Episode 1\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1983|1|3|df=y}}\n|EpisodeNumber=59\n|EpisodeNumber2=1\n|DirectedBy= [[Brian Cosgrove]]\n|WrittenBy= ''Story by:'' [[Keith Scoble]] <br />''Screenplay by:'' [[Brian Trueman]]\n|LineColor=fc3\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n|Title=Episode 2\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1983|1|4|df=y}}\n|EpisodeNumber=60\n|EpisodeNumber2=2\n|DirectedBy= Brian Cosgrove\n|WrittenBy= ''Story by:'' Keith Scoble <br />''Screenplay by:'' Brian Trueman\n|LineColor=fc3\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n|Title=Episode 3\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1983|1|5|df=y}}\n|EpisodeNumber=61\n|EpisodeNumber2=3\n|DirectedBy= Brian Cosgrove\n|WrittenBy= ''Story by:'' Keith Scoble <br />''Screenplay by:'' Brian Trueman\n|LineColor=fc3\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n|Title=Episode 4\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1983|1|6|df=y}}\n|EpisodeNumber=62\n|EpisodeNumber2=4\n|DirectedBy= Brian Cosgrove\n|WrittenBy= ''Story by:'' Keith Scoble <br />''Screenplay by:'' Brian Trueman\n|LineColor=fc3\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n|Title=Episode 5\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1983|1|7|df=y}}\n|EpisodeNumber=63\n|EpisodeNumber2=5\n|DirectedBy= Brian Cosgrove\n|WrittenBy= ''Story by:'' Keith Scoble <br />''Screenplay by:'' Brian Trueman\n|ShortSummary=Danger Mouse finds a computerised hideout locator which leads him to Baron Greenback's hideouts. \n|LineColor=fc3\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n|RTitle=''The Return of Count Duckula''\n|AltTitle=Episode 1\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1983|1|10|df=y}}\n|EpisodeNumber=64\n|EpisodeNumber2=6\n|DirectedBy= Brian Cosgrove\n|WrittenBy= Brian Trueman\n|LineColor=fc3\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n|Title=Episode 2\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1983|1|11|df=y}}\n|EpisodeNumber=65\n|EpisodeNumber2=7\n|DirectedBy= Brian Cosgrove\n|WrittenBy= Brian Trueman\n|LineColor=fc3\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n|Title=Episode 3\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1983|1|12|df=y}}\n|EpisodeNumber=66\n|EpisodeNumber2=8\n|DirectedBy= Brian Cosgrove\n|WrittenBy= Brian Trueman\n|LineColor=fc3\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n|Title=Episode 4\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1983|1|13|df=y}}\n|EpisodeNumber=67\n|EpisodeNumber2=9\n|DirectedBy= Brian Cosgrove\n|WrittenBy= Brian Trueman\n|LineColor=fc3\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n|Title=Episode 5\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1983|1|14|df=y}}\n|EpisodeNumber=68\n|EpisodeNumber2=10\n|DirectedBy= Brian Cosgrove\n|WrittenBy= Brian Trueman\n|ShortSummary=ACount Duckula who has teamed up with Greenback to turn [[British Parliament|Parliament]] show-biz crazy.
