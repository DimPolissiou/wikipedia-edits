Some garnishes are selected mainly to augment the visual impact of the plate, while others are selected specifically for the flavor they may impart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/garnish/index.html|title=Garnish|work=Food Encyclopedia|publisher=Food Network|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> This is in contrast to a [[condiment]], a prepared sauce added to another food item primarily for its flavor. A food item which is served with garnish may be described as being '''garni''', the [[French language|French]] term for 'garnished'.\n\nMany garnishes are not intended to be eaten, though for some it is fine to do so. [[Parsley]] is an example of a traditional garnish; this pungent green [[herb]] has small distinctly shaped leaves, firm stems, and is easy to trim into a garnish.\n\n==Overview==\nA garnish makes food or drink items more visually appealing.<ref name=\"Niz 2014\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vegetablefruitcarving.com/how-to-garnish/|title=How To Garnish The Easy Way!|publisher=VegetableFruitCarving.com|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> They may, for example, enhance their color,<ref name=\"Niz 2014\"/> such as when [[paprika]] is sprinkled on a [[salmon]] salad. They may provide a color contrast, for example when [[chive]]s are sprinkled on [[potato]]es. They may make a [[cocktail]] more visually appealing, such as when a [[cocktail umbrella]] is added to an exotic drink, or when a [[Mai Tai]] is topped with any number of tropical [[fruit]] pieces. [[Sushi]] may be garnished with ''baran'', a type of plastic grass or leaf. Sometimes a garnish and a condiment will be used together to finish the presentation of a dish; for example, an [[entr\u00e9e]] could be topped with a [[sauce]], as the condiment, along with a sprig of parsley as a garnish.\n\nA garnish may be so readily identified with a specific dish that the dish may appear incomplete without the garnish. Examples include a [[banana split]] [[sundae]] with [[Maraschino cherry|cherries]] on top or [[buffalo wings]] served with [[celery]] stick garnish and [[blue cheese dressing]].\n\n==List of

Some garnishes are selected mainly to augment the visual impact of the plate, while others are selected specifically for the flavor they may impart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/garnish/index.html|title=Garnish|work=Food Encyclopedia|publisher=Food Network|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> This is in contrast to a [[condiment]], a prepared sauce added to another food item primarily for its flavor. A food item which is served with garnish may be described as being '''garni''', the [[French language|French]] term for 'garnished'.\n\nMany garnishes are not intended to be eaten, though for some it is fine to do so. [[Parsley]] is an example of a traditional garnish; this pungent green [[herb]] has small distinctly shaped leaves, firm stems, and is easy to trim into a garnish.\n\n==Overview==\nA garnish makes food or drink items more visually appealing.<ref name=\"Niz 2014\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vegetablefruitcarving.com/how-to-garnish/|title=How To Garnish The Easy Way!|publisher=VegetableFruitCarving.com|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> They may, for example, enhance their color,<ref name=\"Niz 2014\"/> such as when [[paprika]] is sprinkled on a [[salmon]] salad. They may provide a color contrast, for example when [[chive]]s are sprinkled on [[potato]]es. They may make a [[cocktail]] more visually appealing, such as when a [[cocktail umbrella]] is added to an exotic drink, or when a [[Mai Tai]] is topped with any number of tropical [[fruit]] pieces. [[Sushi]] may be garnished with ''baran'', a type of plastic grass or leaf. Sometimes a garnish and a condiment will be used together to finish the presentation of a dish; for example, an [[entr\u00e9e]] could be topped with a [[sauce]], as the condiment, along with a sprig of parsley as a garnish.\n\nA garnish may be so readily identified with a specific dish that the dish may appear incomplete without the garnish. Examples include a [[banana split]] [[sundae]] with [[Maraschino cherry|cherries]] on top or [[buffalo wings]] served with [[celery]] stick garnish and [[blue cheese dressing]].\n\n==List of
