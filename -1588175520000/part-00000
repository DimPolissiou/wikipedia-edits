{"title_page": "Theodor Brorsen", "text_new": "[[File:Christian Brorsen.jpg|thumb|right|Commemorative plaque of Th. Brorsen on the castle wall in \u017damberk]]'''Theodor Johan Christian Ambders Brorsen''' (July 29, 1819 &ndash; March 31, 1895) was a Danish [[astronomer]]. He is best known for his discovery of five [[comet]]s, including the [[lost periodic comet]], [[5D/Brorsen]], and the periodic comet [[23P/Brorsen-Metcalf]].\n\n== Life ==\n\nTheodor Johan Christian Ambders Brorsen was born in [[Nordborg]] on the island [[Als Island|Als]], ([[Region of Southern Denmark|South Jutland]]), as son of the captain Christian August Brorsen (1793-1840) and Annette Margrethe Gerhardine Schumacher (1788-1855).  He got his three middle names after the maternal grandfather of his mother, the Nordborg counsel Johan Christian Ambders (1710-1795).  After the amicable divorce of his parents in 1822, Brorsen grew up at his mother\u2019s.  Her good financial circumstances allowed him to attend the school of the [[Moravian Church|Moravians]] in [[Christiansfeld]] (1826-1829) and then, from 1830 to 1839, the Latin school in [[Flensburg]].  By request of his mother, Brorsen studied law in [[Kiel]] (1839), [[Berlin]] (1840), [[Heidelberg]] (1841), and again in Kiel (1842), until he decided to follow his inclinations and studied astronomy in Kiel in 1844.\n\nBrorsen worked at the astronomical observatory of Kiel in 1846, and at the [[Altona Observatory]] in 1847. He rejected a job offer from the astronomical observatory \"[[Rundetaarn]]\" (Round tower) in [[Copenhagen]].  Instead, he accepted a job at the private observatory of baron John Parish (1774-1858, an Englishman, also known as Freiherr von Senftenberg) in [[Zamberk|\u017damberk]] (at the time called Senftenberg) in the present-day [[Czech Republic]].  When the post of the director of the astronomical observatory of Altona became vacant in 1854, Brorsen applied to it, but was not chosen.  After the death of baron Parish in 1858, his heirs had the observatory of Senftenberg dismantled and the astronomical instruments were sold, although Brorsen offered to continue his work for free.  Nevertheless. Brorsen remained in Senftenberg for another 12 years, and continued his observations with his own instruments.\n\nIn 1870, he returned to his home town of Nordborg in South Jutland, which had become Prussian since the [[Second War of Schleswig]] in 1864, and subsequently was German from 1871 up to the plebiscite of 1920.  In 1874, Brorsen moved into the house L\u00f8jtertoft 11, where he lived until his death.  His unmarried half sister, Amalie Petrine Brorsen (1832-1911), kept the house for him.  In his years in Nordborg, however, Brorsen hardly occupied himself with astronomy any more.  His main interests were [[meteorology]] (also observations of the [[Aurora (astronomy)|Northern Lights]]), as well as [[botany]], especially [[orchid]] breeding.\n\n[[File:Theodor_Brorsen.grave2.Nordborg.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Brorsen's gravestone in the cemetery of [[Nordborg]].]]\nPersonally, Brorsen was an introverted character with relationship anxieties.  He twice broke off an engagement in the last moment (first one to Louise Lassen from S\u00f8nderborg, then another one to Miss Bernkopf from \u017damberk) and hence remained unmarried.  Besides, there are testimonies that Brorsen developed self-willed habits in the last 25 years of his life spent in Nordborg.  He did not take much care for his clothing, he let his hair grow long, and when his boots pressed his feet, he cut holes into his boots in the tight places.  He used to take a daily bath in the Oldenor, a lake in Nordborg; in winter, he hoed a hole into the ice for that purpose.  Brorsen died at 75 years of age and was buried on April 5, 1895, in the cemetery of Nordborg where his grave is still preserved today.\n\n== Discoveries ==\n\n* Brorsen discovered five comets:  1846 III, 1846 VII, 1847 V, 1851 III and 1851 IV.  Two of them were named after Brorsen as they are periodic comets.  The comet 1846 III is called Brorsen and the comet 1847 V is named Brorsen-Metcalf (because [[Joel Hastings Metcalf]] was its rediscoverer in 1919).\n\n:The comet [[5D/Brorsen]] (with a period of 5.46 years) was last seen in 1879.  In all, five of its rotations around the sun were observed.  It belonged to the Jupiter comet family, whose comets can be short-lived- it may not exist today.\n\n:The comet [[23P/Brorsen-Metcalf]] (with a period of 69.06 years) was observed in 1847, 1919 and 1989.  It belongs to the Halley comet family and is to be expected for 2059 again.\n\n* In 1850, Brorsen (re-)discovered an [[emission nebula]] in the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]: NGC 2024, also known as [[Flame Nebula]]. Ith had already been observed, however, by [[William Herschel]] in 1786, as we know today.\n* Brorsen might have discovered a sixth comet on March 16, 1854; this discovery could not be confirmed by other astronomers, though.\n* In 1854, Brorsen published the first thorough investigations of the so-called [[gegenschein]] (counter shine) of the [[Zodiacal light]].  He was also able to explain that phenomenon correctly. Besides, Brorsen was the first to discover that the Zodiacal light can embrace the complete sky, because, under favorable conditions, a feeble light bridge connecting the Zodiacal light and the counter glow can be observed.\n* In 1856, Brorsen discovered a [[globular cluster]] in the constellation [[Serpens]], which was later catalogued as [[NGC 6539]].\n* Further, Brorsen investigated the [[occultation]]s and [[proper motion]]s of stars. In the field of theoretical astronomy, Brorsen calculated the [[apsis|perihelia]] of comet and planet orbits.\n\n== Honors ==\n\n* For each of his first three comet discoveries, Brorsen was awarded a golden comet medal by the Danish king [[Christian VIII]].  The medal that he got in 1846 can be seen today in the museum at S\u00f8nderborg castle, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120301193854/http://www.museum-sonderjylland.dk/siderne/Museerne/Sonderborg-SLot/03b6-Moenter.html see here].\n* Brorsen was appointed a corresponding member of the nature historic society in \u017damberk in 1850.\n* Today, in Nordborg, a street, ''Th. Brorsens vej'', is named after Brorsen.\n* The [[asteroid]] [[3979 Brorsen|3979]], which was discovered by [[Anton\u00edn Mrkos|A. Mrkos]] in Klet on November 8, 1983, was named \"Brorsen\" on proposal of [[Jana Tich\u00e1|J.

Leaving Syria with 70,000 men, he reached [[Bithynia]], although harsh weather he encountered along the way had gravely weakened his army. In April 313, he crossed the [[Bosporus]] and went to [[Byzantium]], which was held by Licinius' troops. Undeterred, he took the town after an eleven-day siege. He moved to Heraclea, which he captured after a short siege, before moving his forces to the first posting station.

Unfortunately for Daia, Licinius' army succeeded in breaking through, forcing Daia to retreat to [[Tarsus in Cilicia|Tarsus]] where Licinius continued to press him on land and sea. The war between them only ended with Daia's death in August 313.<ref name=DiMaio />\n\nGiven that Constantine had already crushed his rival Maxentius in 312, the two men decided to divide the Roman world between them. As a result of this settlement, Licinius became sole Augustus in the East, while his brother-in-law, Constantine, was supreme in the West.<ref name=\"EB\"/> Licinius immediately rushed to the east to deal with another threat, this time from the Persian [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]].<ref name=Gibbon />\n\n==Conflict with Constantine I==\n[[File:Licinius-Constantine.jpg|thumb|right|Sculptural portraits of Licinius (left) and his rival [[Constantine I]] (right).]]\nIn 314, a civil war erupted between Licinius and Constantine, in which Constantine used the pretext that Licinius was harbouring Senecio, whom Constantine accused of plotting to overthrow him.<ref name=Gibbon />  Constantine prevailed at the [[Battle of Cibalae]] in [[Pannonia]] (October 8, 314).<ref name=DiMaio /> Although the situation was temporarily settled, with both men sharing the [[consulship]] in 315, it was but a lull in the storm. The next year a new war erupted, when Licinius named [[Valerius Valens]] co-emperor, only for Licinius to suffer a humiliating defeat on the plain of [[battle of Mardia|Mardia]] (also known as [[Campus Ardiensis]]) in [[Thrace]]. The emperors were reconciled after these two battles and Licinius had his co-emperor Valens killed.<ref name=DiMaio />\n\nOver the next ten years, the two imperial colleagues maintained an uneasy truce.<ref name=Gibbon /> Licinius kept himself busy with a campaign against the Sarmatians in 318,<ref name=DiMaio /> but temperatures rose again in 321 when Constantine pursued some Sarmatians, who had been ravaging some territory in his realm, across the Danube into what was technically Licinius's territory.<ref name=DiMaio /> When he repeated this with another invasion, this time by the [[Goths]] who were pillaging [[Thrace]] under their leader [[Rausimod]], Licinius complained that Constantine had broken the treaty between them.\n\nConstantine wasted no time going on the offensive. Licinius's fleet of 350 ships was defeated by Constantine's fleet in 323. Then in 324, Constantine, tempted by the \"advanced age and unpopular vices\"<ref name=\"EB\"/><ref name=Gibbon /> of his colleague, again declared war against him and having defeated his army of 165,000 men<ref>Grant p. 46</ref> at the [[battle of Adrianople (324)|Battle of Adrianople]] (July 3, 324), succeeded in shutting him up within the walls of [[Byzantium]].<ref name=\"EB\"/><ref name=DiMaio /> The defeat of the superior fleet of Licinius in the [[Battle of Hellespont|Battle of the Hellespont]] by [[Crispus]], Constantine's eldest son and [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]], compelled his withdrawal to [[Bithynia]], where a last stand was made; the [[Battle of Chrysopolis]], near [[Chalcedon]] (September 18),<ref name=\"EB\">{{1911|wstitle=Licinius|volume=16|page=587|inline=1}}</ref> resulted in Licinius' final submission.<ref name=Gibbon /> In this conflict Licinius was supported by the Gothic prince [[Alica]]. Due to the intervention of Flavia Julia Constantia, Constantine's sister and also  Licinius' wife, both Licinius and his co-emperor [[Martinian (emperor)|Martinian]] were initially spared, Licinius being imprisoned in [[Thessalonica]], Martinian in [[Cappadocia (Roman province)|Cappadocia]]; however, both former emperors were subsequently executed. After his defeat, Licinius attempted to regain power with Gothic support, but his plans were exposed, and he was sentenced to death. While attempting to flee to the Goths, Licinius was apprehended at [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonica]]. Constantine had him hanged, accusing him of conspiring to raise troops among the barbarians.<ref name=Gibbon /><ref>Grant, pp. 47\u201348</ref>\n\n==Character and legacy==\n[[File:Nummus of Licinius I (YORYM 2001 10248) obverse.jpg|thumb|A Nummus of Licinius I]]\nAfter defeating Daia, he had put to death [[Flavius Severianus]], the son of the emperor Severus, as well as Candidianus, the son of Galerius.<ref name=Gibbon /> He also ordered the execution of the wife and daughter of the Emperor [[Diocletian]], who had fled from the court of Licinius before being discovered at [[Thessalonica]].<ref name=Gibbon />\n\nAs part of Constantine's attempts to decrease Licinius's popularity, he actively portrayed his brother-in-law as a pagan supporter. This may not have been case; contemporary evidence tends to suggest that he was at least a committed supporter of Christians at one point.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} He co-authored the Edict of Milan which ended the [[Great Persecution]], and re-affirmed the rights of Christians in his half of the empire. He also added the Christian symbol to his armies, and attempted to regulate the affairs of the Church hierarchy just as Constantine and his successors were to do.

Unfortunately for Daia, Licinius' army succeeded in breaking through, forcing Daia to retreat to [[Tarsus in Cilicia|Tarsus]] where Licinius continued to press him on land and sea. The war between them only ended with Daia\u2019s death in August 313.<ref name=DiMaio />\n\nGiven that Constantine had already crushed his rival Maxentius in 312, the two men decided to divide the Roman world between them. As a result of this settlement, Licinius became sole Augustus in the East, while his brother-in-law, Constantine, was supreme in the West.<ref name=\"EB\"/> Licinius immediately rushed to the east to deal with another threat, this time from the Persian [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]].<ref name=Gibbon />\n\n==Conflict with Constantine I==\n[[File:Licinius-Constantine.jpg|thumb|right|Sculptural portraits of Licinius (left) and his rival [[Constantine I]] (right).]]\nIn 314, a civil war erupted between Licinius and Constantine, in which Constantine used the pretext that Licinius was harbouring Senecio, whom Constantine accused of plotting to overthrow him.<ref name=Gibbon />  Constantine prevailed at the [[Battle of Cibalae]] in [[Pannonia]] (October 8, 314).<ref name=DiMaio /> Although the situation was temporarily settled, with both men sharing the [[consulship]] in 315, it was but a lull in the storm. The next year a new war erupted, when Licinius named [[Valerius Valens]] co-emperor, only for Licinius to suffer a humiliating defeat on the plain of [[battle of Mardia|Mardia]] (also known as [[Campus Ardiensis]]) in [[Thrace]]. The emperors were reconciled after these two battles and Licinius had his co-emperor Valens killed.<ref name=DiMaio />\n\nOver the next ten years, the two imperial colleagues maintained an uneasy truce.<ref name=Gibbon /> Licinius kept himself busy with a campaign against the Sarmatians in 318,<ref name=DiMaio /> but temperatures rose again in 321 when Constantine pursued some Sarmatians, who had been ravaging some territory in his realm, across the Danube into what was technically Licinius\u2019s territory.<ref name=DiMaio /> When he repeated this with another invasion, this time by the [[Goths]] who were pillaging [[Thrace]] under their leader [[Rausimod]], Licinius complained that Constantine had broken the treaty between them.\n\nConstantine wasted no time going on the offensive. Licinius's fleet of 350 ships was defeated by Constantine's fleet in 323. Then in 324, Constantine, tempted by the \"advanced age and unpopular vices\"<ref name=\"EB\"/><ref name=Gibbon /> of his colleague, again declared war against him and having defeated his army of 165,000 men<ref>Grant p. 46</ref> at the [[battle of Adrianople (324)|Battle of Adrianople]] (July 3, 324), succeeded in shutting him up within the walls of [[Byzantium]].<ref name=\"EB\"/><ref name=DiMaio /> The defeat of the superior fleet of Licinius in the [[Battle of Hellespont|Battle of the Hellespont]] by [[Crispus]], Constantine\u2019s eldest son and [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]], compelled his withdrawal to [[Bithynia]], where a last stand was made; the [[Battle of Chrysopolis]], near [[Chalcedon]] (September 18),<ref name=\"EB\">{{1911|wstitle=Licinius|volume=16|page=587|inline=1}}</ref> resulted in Licinius' final submission.<ref name=Gibbon /> In this conflict Licinius was supported by the Gothic prince [[Alica]]. Due to the intervention of Flavia Julia Constantia, Constantine's sister and also  Licinius' wife, both Licinius and his co-emperor [[Martinian (emperor)|Martinian]] were initially spared, Licinius being imprisoned in [[Thessalonica]], Martinian in [[Cappadocia (Roman province)|Cappadocia]]; however, both former emperors were subsequently executed. After his defeat, Licinius attempted to regain power with Gothic support, but his plans were exposed, and he was sentenced to death. While attempting to flee to the Goths, Licinius was apprehended at [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonica]]. Constantine had him hanged, accusing him of conspiring to raise troops among the barbarians.<ref name=Gibbon /><ref>Grant, pp. 47\u201348</ref>\n\n==Character and legacy==\n[[File:Nummus of Licinius I (YORYM 2001 10248) obverse.jpg|thumb|A Nummus of Licinius I]]\nAfter defeating Daia, he had put to death [[Flavius Severianus]], the son of the emperor Severus, as well as Candidianus, the son of Galerius.<ref name=Gibbon /> He also ordered the execution of the wife and daughter of the Emperor [[Diocletian]], who had fled from the court of Licinius before being discovered at [[Thessalonica]].<ref name=Gibbon />\n\nAs part of Constantine\u2019s attempts to decrease Licinius\u2019s popularity, he actively portrayed his brother-in-law as a pagan supporter.

It is often depicted as a cover for a secret location; shown with faces removed or modified (as in 1980's ''[[Superman II]]''), or added; or parodied.  Trey Parker and Matt Stone used the location as the headquarters for their 2004 film ''[[Team America: World Police]]''.  ''[[National Treasure: Book of Secrets]]'' (2007) also depicts this location as a secret cover for a fictional gold city.

Rushmore Early Morning.jpg|thumb|right|Mount Rushmore, showing the full size of the mountain and the [[scree]] of rocks from the sculpting and construction.]]\n\nMount Rushmore is largely composed of [[granite]]. The memorial is carved on the northwest margin of the [[Black Elk Peak]] granite [[batholith]] in the Black Hills of South Dakota, so the geologic formations of the heart of the Black Hills region are also evident at Mount Rushmore. The batholith [[magma]] intruded into the pre-existing [[mica]] [[schist]] rocks during the [[Proterozoic]], 1.6 billion years ago.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080616091103/http://www.nps.gov/archive/moru/pphtml/subenvironmentalfactors13.html Geologic Activity]. National Park Service.</ref> Coarse grained [[pegmatite]] [[Dike (geology)|dikes]] are associated with the [[granite]] intrusion of Black Elk Peak and are visibly lighter in color, thus explaining the light-colored streaks on the foreheads of the presidents.\n\nThe Black Hills granites were exposed to [[erosion]] during the [[Neoproterozoic]], but were later buried by [[sandstone]] and other sediments during the [[Cambrian]]. Remaining buried throughout the [[Paleozoic]], they were re-exposed again during the [[Laramide orogeny]] around 70 million years ago.<ref name=autogenerated3/> The Black Hills area was uplifted as an elongated geologic dome.<ref>Irvin, James R.

Some schist does remain and can be seen as the darker material just below the sculpture of Washington.\n\nThe tallest mountain in the region is [[Black Elk Peak]] ({{convert|7,242|ft|m|disp=or|abbr=on}}). Borglum selected Mount Rushmore as the site for several reasons. The rock of the mountain is composed of smooth, fine-grained granite. The durable granite erodes only {{convert|1|in|mm}} every 10,000 years, thus was more than sturdy enough to support the sculpture and its long-term exposure.<ref name=autogenerated1/> The mountain's height of {{convert|5725|ft|m}} above sea level<ref name=peakbagger/> made it suitable, and because it faces the southeast, the workers also had the advantage of sunlight for most of the day.\n\n=== Soils ===\nThe Mount Rushmore area is underlain by well drained [[alfisol]] soils of very gravelly loam (Mocmount) to silt loam (Buska) texture, brown to dark grayish brown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/gmap/|title=SoilWeb: An Online Soil Survey|publisher=[[University of California, Davis]]|accessdate=August 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Climate ===\nMount Rushmore has a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dwb'' in the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]).

Trey Parker and Matt Stone used the location as the headquarters for their 2004 film ''[[Team America: World Police]]''.  ''[[National Treasure: Book of Secrets]]'' (2007) also depicts this location as a secret cover for a fictional gold city.

During ''The Follies of 1915'', [[W. C. Fields]] allegedly caught Wynn [[Overacting|mugging]] for the audience under the table during Fields' ''Pool Room'' routine and knocked Wynn unconscious with his cue.<ref>\"August Clown\" [https://books.google.com/books?id=4EcEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA74&pg=PA70#v=onepage], ''Life'', July 26, 1948, p. 70, accessed May 31, 2011.</ref> Wynn wrote, directed, and produced many [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows in the subsequent decades, and was known for his silly costumes and props as well as for the giggly, wavering voice he developed for the 1921 musical revue, ''The Perfect Fool''.\n\n==Radio==\n[[File:Ed Wynn 001.jpg|thumb|Ed Wynn as \"Mr. Busybody\" 1908]]\nIn the early 1930s Wynn hosted the popular [[radio show]] ''[[Texaco Star Theater|The Fire Chief]]'',<ref>http://www.radioechoes.com/?page=series&genre=OTR-Comedy&series=Ed%20Wynn%20The%20Fire%20Chief</ref> heard in North America on Tuesday nights, sponsored by [[Texaco]] gasoline. Like many former vaudeville performers who turned to radio in the same decade, the stage-trained Wynn insisted on playing for a live studio audience, doing each program as an actual stage show, using visual bits to augment his written material, and in his case, wearing a colorful costume with a red fireman's helmet. He usually bounced his gags off announcer/straight man [[Graham McNamee]]; Wynn's customary opening, \"Tonight, Graham, the show's gonna be different,\" became one of the most familiar tag-lines of its time; a sample joke: \"Graham, my uncle just bought a new second-handed car... he calls it Baby! I don't know, it won't go anyplace without a rattle!\"\n\nWynn reprised his Fire Chief radio character in two movies, ''Follow the Leader'' (1930) and ''The Chief'' (1933). Near the height of his radio fame (1933) he founded his own short-lived radio network the [[Amalgamated Broadcasting System]], which lasted only five weeks, nearly destroying the comedian. According to radio historian Elizabeth McLeod, the failed venture left Wynn deep in debt, divorced and finally, suffering a nervous breakdown.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.otrr.org/FILES/Articles/Elizabeth%20McLeod/wynn.htm|title =  Tonight The Program's Gonna Be Different!The Life and Times of Ed Wynn, The Fire Chief|date = |accessdate=June 2, 2015|website = Old Time Radio Researchers Group|publisher = |last =McLeod |first =Elizabeth }}</ref>\n\nWynn was offered the title role in [[MGM]]'s 1939 screen adaptation of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', but turned it down, as did his Ziegfeld contemporary [[W. C. Fields]]. The part went to [[Frank Morgan]].\n\n==Television==\nEd Wynn first appeared on television on July 7, 1936 in a brief, ad-libbed spot with Graham McNamee during an NBC experimental television broadcast.  In the 1949\u201350 season, Wynn hosted one of the first network, comedy-variety television shows, on CBS, and won both a [[Peabody Award]] and an [[Emmy Award]] in 1949. [[Buster Keaton]], [[Lucille Ball]], and [[The Three Stooges]] all made guest appearances with Wynn.  This was the first CBS variety television show to originate from Los Angeles, which was seen live on the west coast, but filmed via [[kinescope]] for distribution in the Midwest and East, as the national [[coaxial cable]] had yet to be completed.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://archive.org/details/TheEdWynnShow1950|title = The Ed Wynn Show, 1950|date = |accessdate=December 8, 2014|website = Internet Archive \u2013 Moving Image Archive|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Wynn was also a rotating host of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Four Star Revue]]'' from 1950 through 1952.\n\nAfter the end of Wynn's third television series, ''The Ed Wynn Show'' (a short-lived situation comedy on [[NBC]]'s 1958\u201359 schedule), his son, actor [[Keenan Wynn]], encouraged him to make a career change rather than retire. The comedian reluctantly began a career as a dramatic actor in television and movies. Father and son appeared in three productions, the first of which was the 1956 ''[[Playhouse 90]]'' broadcast of [[Rod Serling]]'s play ''[[Requiem for a Heavyweight]]''. Ed was terrified of straight acting and kept goofing his lines in rehearsal. When the producers wanted to fire him, star [[Jack Palance]] said he would quit if they fired Ed. (However, unbeknownst to Wynn, supporting player [[Ned Glass]] was his secret understudy in case something ''did'' happen before air time.) On live broadcast night, Wynn surprised everyone with his pitch-perfect performance, and his quick ad libs to cover his mistakes. A dramatization of what happened during the production was later staged as an April 1960 ''[[Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse]]'' episode, \"The Man in the Funny Suit\", starring both senior and junior Wynns, with key figures involved in the original production also portraying themselves. Ed and his son also worked together in the [[Jose Ferrer]] film ''[[The Great Man]]'', with Ed again proving his unexpected skills in drama.\n[[File:Ed Wynn Richard Crenna Slatterys People 1964.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Wynn (left) and [[Richard Crenna]] (right) in ''[[Slattery's People]]'', 1964.]]\n''Requiem'' established Wynn as a serious dramatic actor who could easily hold his own with the best. His performance in ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' (1959) received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nAlso in 1959, Wynn appeared on Serling's TV series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' in  \"[[One for the Angels]]\". Serling, a longtime admirer, had written that episode especially for him, and Wynn later in 1963 starred in the episode \"[[Ninety Years Without Slumbering]]\". For the rest of his life, Wynn skillfully moved between comic and dramatic roles. He appeared in feature films and anthology television, endearing himself to new generations of fans.\n\n==Cartoons==\nWynn was caricatured in the [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoon shorts ''Shuffle Off to Buffalo'' (1933) and ''[[I've Got to Sing a Torch Song]]'' (1933), and as a pot of jam in the [[Betty Boop]] short ''[[Betty in Blunderland]]'' (1934).\n\n==Films==\nHe appeared as the Fairy Godfather in [[Jerry Lewis]]' ''[[Cinderfella]]''.

Like many former vaudeville performers who turned to radio in the same decade, the stage-trained Wynn insisted on playing for a live studio audience, doing each program as an actual stage show, using visual bits to augment his written material, and in his case, wearing a colorful costume with a red fireman's helmet. He usually bounced his gags off announcer/straight man [[Graham McNamee]]; Wynn's customary opening, \"Tonight, Graham, the show's gonna be different,\" became one of the most familiar tag-lines of its time; a sample joke: \"Graham, my uncle just bought a new second-handed car... he calls it Baby! I don't know, it won't go anyplace without a rattle!\"\n\nWynn reprised his Fire Chief radio character in two movies, ''Follow the Leader'' (1930) and ''The Chief'' (1933). Near the height of his radio fame (1933) he founded his own short-lived radio network the [[Amalgamated Broadcasting System]], which lasted only five weeks, nearly destroying the comedian. According to radio historian Elizabeth McLeod, the failed venture left Wynn deep in debt, divorced and finally, suffering a nervous breakdown.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.otrr.org/FILES/Articles/Elizabeth%20McLeod/wynn.htm|title =  Tonight The Program's Gonna Be Different!The Life and Times of Ed Wynn, The Fire Chief|date = |accessdate=June 2, 2015|website = Old Time Radio Researchers Group|publisher = |last =McLeod |first =Elizabeth }}</ref>\n\nWynn was offered the title role in [[MGM]]'s 1939 screen adaptation of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', but turned it down, as did his Ziegfeld contemporary [[W. C. Fields]]. The part went to [[Frank Morgan]].\n\n==Television==\nEd Wynn first appeared on television on July 7, 1936 in a brief, ad-libbed spot with Graham McNamee during an NBC experimental television broadcast.  In the 1949\u201350 season, Wynn hosted one of the first network, comedy-variety television shows, on CBS, and won both a [[Peabody Award]] and an [[Emmy Award]] in 1949. [[Buster Keaton]], [[Lucille Ball]], and [[The Three Stooges]] all made guest appearances with Wynn.  This was the first CBS variety television show to originate from Los Angeles, which was seen live on the west coast, but filmed via [[kinescope]] for distribution in the Midwest and East, as the national [[coaxial cable]] had yet to be completed.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://archive.org/details/TheEdWynnShow1950|title = The Ed Wynn Show, 1950|date = |accessdate=December 8, 2014|website = Internet Archive \u2013 Moving Image Archive|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Wynn was also a rotating host of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Four Star Revue]]'' from 1950 through 1952.\n\nAfter the end of Wynn's third television series, ''The Ed Wynn Show'' (a short-lived situation comedy on [[NBC]]'s 1958\u201359 schedule), his son, actor [[Keenan Wynn]], encouraged him to make a career change rather than retire. The comedian reluctantly began a career as a dramatic actor in television and movies. Father and son appeared in three productions, the first of which was the 1956 ''[[Playhouse 90]]'' broadcast of [[Rod Serling]]'s play ''[[Requiem for a Heavyweight]]''. Ed was terrified of straight acting and kept goofing his lines in rehearsal. When the producers wanted to fire him, star [[Jack Palance]] said he would quit if they fired Ed. (However, unbeknownst to Wynn, supporting player [[Ned Glass]] was his secret understudy in case something ''did'' happen before air time.) On live broadcast night, Wynn surprised everyone with his pitch-perfect performance, and his quick ad libs to cover his mistakes. A dramatization of what happened during the production was later staged as an April 1960 ''[[Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse]]'' episode, \"The Man in the Funny Suit\", starring both senior and junior Wynns, with key figures involved in the original production also portraying themselves. Ed and his son also worked together in the [[Jose Ferrer]] film ''[[The Great Man]]'', with Ed again proving his unexpected skills in drama.\n[[File:Ed Wynn Richard Crenna Slatterys People 1964.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Wynn (left) and [[Richard Crenna]] (right) in ''[[Slattery's People]]'', 1964.]]\n''Requiem'' established Wynn as a serious dramatic actor who could easily hold his own with the best. His performance in ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' (1959) received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nAlso in 1959, Wynn appeared on Serling's TV series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' in  \"[[One for the Angels]]\". Serling, a longtime admirer, had written that episode especially for him, and Wynn later in 1963 starred in the episode \"[[Ninety Years Without Slumbering]]\". For the rest of his life, Wynn skillfully moved between comic and dramatic roles. He appeared in feature films and anthology television, endearing himself to new generations of fans.\n\n==Cartoons==\nWynn was caricatured in the [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoon shorts ''Shuffle Off to Buffalo'' (1933) and ''[[I've Got to Sing a Torch Song]]'' (1933), and as a pot of jam in the [[Betty Boop]] short ''[[Betty in Blunderland]]'' (1934).\n\n==Films==\nHe appeared as the Fairy Godfather in [[Jerry Lewis]]' ''[[Cinderfella]]''. His performance as Paul Beaseley in the 1958 film ''[[The Great Man]]'' earned him nominations for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for \"Best Supporting Actor\" and a [[BAFTA Award]] for \"Best Foreign Actor\". The following year he received his first (and only) nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his role as Mr. Dussell in ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' (1959). Six years later he appeared in the Bible epic ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]''.\n\n==Disney==\nWynn provided the voice of the [[Mad Hatter]] in [[Walt Disney]]'s film, ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' and played The Toymaker alongside [[Annette Funicello]] and [[Tommy Sands (entertainer)|Tommy Sands]] in the Christmas operetta film ''[[Babes in Toyland (1961 film)|Babes in Toyland]]'' released in 1961.\n\nPossibly his best-remembered film appearance was in Walt Disney's ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964), in which he played eccentric Uncle Albert floating around just beneath the ceiling in uncontrollable mirth, singing \"[[I Love to Laugh]]\".\n\nRe-teaming with the Disney team the following year, in ''[[That Darn Cat! (1965 film)|That Darn Cat!]]'' (1965) featuring [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] and [[Hayley Mills]], Wynn filled out the character of Mr. Hofstedder, the watch jeweler with his bumbling charm. He also had brief roles in ''[[The Absent Minded Professor]]'' (as the [[Ed Wynn#Radio|fire chief]], in a scene alongside his son [[Keenan Wynn]], who played the film's antagonist) and ''[[Son of Flubber]]'' (as county agricultural agent A.J.

His final performance, as Rufus in Walt Disney's ''[[The Gnome-Mobile]]'', was released a few months after his death.\n\nIn addition to Disney films, Wynn was also an actor in the Disneyland production ''The Golden Horseshoe Revue''.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Ed Wynn Grave.JPG|thumb|150px|The niche of Ed Wynn, in the Great Mausoleum, Forest Lawn Glendale.]]\nWynn died June 19, 1966 in [[Beverly Hills, California]] of [[esophageal cancer]],<ref name=bio /> aged 79.

He worked in a wide variety of trades throughout his life and took part in the famous [[gunfight at the O.K. Corral]], during which lawmen killed three outlaw [[Cochise County Cowboys]]. He's often erroneously regarded as the central figure in the shootout, although his brother [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]] was the Tombstone City ''and'' Deputy U.S. Marshal that day, and had far more experience in combat as a sheriff, constable, marshal, and soldier.<ref name=mighty>[https://www.wearethemighty.com/history/unheralded-hero-of-ok-corral Frontier Lawman Virgil Earp]</ref>\n\nEarp had many other interests besides being a professional gambler, teamster, and buffalo hunter. As an entrepreneur he owned several saloons, maintained a brothel, mined for silver and gold, and refereed boxing matches. He spent his early life in [[Pella, Iowa]]. In 1870, he married Urilla Sutherland, who contracted typhoid fever and died in childbirth.<ref>{{cite web| title = Who was Urilla Sutherland, the first wife of Wyatt Earp?| publisher = True West Magazine| date = August 31, 2011 | url = https://truewestmagazine.com/urilla-sutherland-first-wife-wyatt-earp/| access-date = July 10, 2018}}</ref> During the next two years, Earp was arrested for stealing a horse, escaped from jail, and was sued twice.

In the winter of 1878, he went to Texas to track down an outlaw, and he met [[Doc Holliday|John \"Doc\" Holliday]], whom Earp credited with saving his life.\n\nEarp moved constantly throughout his life from one boomtown to another. He left Dodge City in 1879 and moved with brothers James and Virgil to Tombstone, where a silver boom was underway. The Earps clashed with an informal group of outlaws known as the \"[[Cochise County Cowboys|Cowboys]].\" Wyatt, Virgil, and younger brother [[Morgan Earp|Morgan]] held various law-enforcement positions which put them in conflict with [[Tom McLaury]], [[Frank McLaury]], [[Ike Clanton]], and [[Billy Clanton]] who threatened to kill the Earps on several occasions. The conflict escalated over the next year, culminating in the shootout at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881, where the Earps and Doc Holliday killed three Cowboys. During the next five months, Virgil was ambushed and maimed, and Morgan was assassinated. Wyatt, [[Warren Earp]], Doc Holliday, and others formed a [[Earp Vendetta Ride|federal posse]] which killed three more Cowboys whom they thought responsible. Wyatt was never wounded in any of the gunfights, unlike his brothers Virgil and Morgan or his friend [[Doc Holliday]], which only added to his mystique after his death.\n\nAs a lifelong gambler Earp was always looking for a quick way to make money. After leaving Tombstone, he went to San Francisco where he reunited with [[Josephine Earp|Josephine Marcus]], and she became his [[common-law wife]]. They joined a gold rush to Eagle City, Idaho, where they owned mining interests and a saloon. They left to race horses and open a saloon during a real estate boom in [[San Diego|San Diego, California]]. Back in San Francisco, Wyatt raced horses again, but his reputation suffered irreparably when he refereed the [[Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey]] boxing match and called a foul which led many to believe that he fixed the fight. They moved briefly to [[Yuma, Arizona]], before joining the [[Nome Gold Rush]] in 1899.

This began to change only after his death when the extremely flattering biography ''[[Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal]]'' was published in 1931, becoming a bestseller and creating his reputation as a fearless lawman. Since then, Earp has been the subject of numerous films, television shows, biographies, and works of fiction which have increased both his fame and his notoriety. Long after his death, he has many devoted detractors and admirers.

Virgil requested the assistance of his brothers Wyatt and Morgan, along with Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams, and they found the mules at the McLaurys' ranch. (McLaury was a Cowboy, a term which was generally used in that region to refer to a loose association of outlaws, some of whom also were land-owners and ranchers. Legitimate cowmen were referred to as cattle herders or ranchers.)

The Cowboys showed up two days later without the mules and laughed at Hurst and the Earps. In response, Hurst printed a handbill describing the theft, and he charged McLaury with hiding the mules. He also reproduced the handbill in ''The Tombstone Epitaph'' on July 30, 1880. McLaury angrily printed a response in the Cowboy-friendly ''Nuggett'', calling Hurst \"unmanly\", \"a coward, a vagabond, a rascal, and a malicious liar\", and accusing him of stealing the mules himself. Hurst later cautioned the Earp brothers that the Cowboys had threatened their lives.<ref name=\"wyatttestimony\" /> Virgil reported that McLaury accosted him and said, \"If you ever again follow us as close as you did, then you will have to fight anyway.\"<ref name=lubet/>{{rp|28}} A month later, Earp ran into Frank and Tom McLaury in Charleston, and they told him that they would kill him if he ever followed them as he had done before.<ref name=\"wyatttestimony\" />\n\n===Becomes deputy sheriff===\nCounty Sheriff [[Charles A.

Earp had a common-law relationship with Mattie Blaylock. Modern researchers have found her listed as Earp's wife in the June 1880 census. She suffered from severe headaches and became addicted to [[laudanum]], a commonly used opiate and painkiller, and later committed suicide. When Marcus learned that Stuart Lake had discovered the existence of Blaylock, she successfully demanded that he omit her from his book ''I Married Wyatt Earp''.<ref name=\"mattie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-womenlist-b.html|title=The Complete List of Historical Women \u2013 Last Name Begins with B|publisher=LegendsofAmerica.com|access-date=March 1, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318191932/http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-womenlist-b.html|archivedate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter Marcus arrived in Tombstone with Behan, Earp apparently developed an interest in her, although there are no records in Tombstone of a relationship between Josephine and Earp.

Jaffa, who was also president of New Albuquerque's Board of Trade. Like Josephine, Jaffa was Jewish. During their stay in Albuquerque, the two men ate at the Retreat Restaurant owned by \"Fat Charlie\". Former New Mexico Territory Governor [[Miguel Antonio Otero (born 1859)|Miguel Otero]] described in a letter he wrote in 1940 an incident that indicates Earp's feelings for Marcus. He wrote, \"Holliday said something about Earp becoming 'a damn Jew-boy.' Earp became angry and left\u2026. [Henry] Jaffa told me later that Earp's woman was a Jewess. Earp did ''[[mezuzah]]'' when entering the house.\" <ref name=\"singer\"/>\n\nEarp's anger at Holliday's ethnic slur may indicate that his feelings for Josephine were more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information in the letter is compelling because at that time in the 1940s, the possibility of a prior relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus while in Tombstone was unknown.

Earp later frequently visited the sets of movie director [[John Ford]], whose movies starred [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]].<ref name=\"barra07\" /> Ford's son Patrick later wrote, \"My dad was real friendly with Wyatt Earp, and as a little boy I remember him.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://truewestmagazine.com/wyatt-on-the-set-movie/|title=Wyatt On the Set!|date=May 7, 2012|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1916, Earp went with his friend Jack London, whom he knew from Nome, to visit the set of former cowboy, sailor, and movie actor-turned-film director [[Raoul Walsh]], who was shooting at the studio of [[Mutual Film]] conglomerate in [[Edendale, Los Angeles|Edendale, California]]. Walsh took the two men to dinner at Al Levy's Cafe on Main and Third Street. During the meal, the highest paid entertainer in the world, [[Charlie Chaplin]], dropped by to greet Wyatt Earp. Chaplin was impressed by both men, but particularly the former Tombstone marshal.<ref name=\"barra07\" />\n\nIn the early 1920s, Earp was given the honorary title of deputy sheriff in San Bernardino County, California.<ref name=\"wgbh\" /> On January 25, 1926, Wyatt's only surviving brother James died of [[cerebral apoplexy]] in San Bernardino, California.<ref name=\"scism\" />\n\nEarp tried to persuade his good friend, well-known [[Western (genre)|cowboy movie]] star William S. Hart, to help set the record straight about his life and get a movie made.<ref name=\"murray\" /> \"If the story were exploited on the screen by you,\" he wrote Hart, \"It would do much toward setting me right before a public which has always been fed lies about me.\"<ref name=\"wgbh\" /><ref name=\"murray\" /> Hart encouraged Earp to first find an author to pen his story.<ref name=\"morey\" />\n\nIn 1925, Earp began to collaborate on a biography with his friend and former mining engineer [[John H. Flood, Jr.|John Flood]] to get his story told in a way that he approved.<ref name=\"bobbell\" /><ref name=\"morey\" /> Flood volunteered his time and attempted to write an authorized biography of Earp's life, based on Earp's recollections. The two men sat together every Sunday in the kitchen of Earp's modest, rented bungalow. While Wyatt sipped a drink and smoked a cigar, they tried to tell Earp's story, but Josephine was always present.<ref name=\"reidhead\" /> She often interrupted and insisted, \"You can't write that! It needs to be clean.\" She also demanded that they add more \"pep\" to the manuscript, which in her mind meant including the word \"CRACK!\" in all capitals. In the chapter about the shootout, the manuscript includes 109 uses of \"CRACK\". She thought Earp needed to be shown as a hero, and the manuscript includes a chapter titled \"Conflagration\" in which Earp saves two women, one a cripple, from a Tombstone fire.<ref name=\"bobbell\" />\n\nFlood's writing was \"stilted, corny, and one-dimensional\", and the manuscript, completed some time in early 1926, never found a publisher.<ref name=\"barra07\" /> In February 1927, editor Anne Johnston of [[Bobbs-Merrill Company|Bobbs Merrill]] wrote back and was highly critical of the \"stilted, florid, and diffuse\" writing. She wrote, \"Now one forgets what it's all about in the clutter of unimportant details that impedes its pace, and the pompous manner of its telling.\"<ref name=\"floodbio\" />\n\nSpolidora as a teenager had visited the Earps many times near her family home in [[Needles, California]], and she sometimes went to San Diego with them.<ref name=\"reidhead\" /> In an interview with the San Bernardino historical society in 1990, she attributed the highly exaggerated stories about Wyatt Earp to Josephine. Josephine \"would always interfere whenever Wyatt would talk with Stuart Lake. She always interfered! She wanted him to look like a church-going saint and blow things up. Wyatt didn't want that at all!\"<ref name=\"odyssey\" />\n\nHart tried to help.

He wrote:\n\n{{Quote|Wyatt was a shy young man with few intimates. With casual acquaintances he seldom spoke unless spoken to. When he did say anything it was to the point, without fear or favor, which wasn't relished by some; but that never bothered Wyatt. To those who knew him well he was a genial companion. He had the most even disposition I ever saw; I never knew him to lose his temper. He was more intelligent, better educated, and far better mannered than the majority of his associates, which probably did not help them to understand him. His reserve limited his friendships, but more than one stranger, down on his luck, has had firsthand evidence of Wyatt's generosity.

After referring to the Fitzimmons-Sharkey fight, the article quoted Behan. \"The Clanton brothers and the McLowrys<!-- sic --> were a tough lot of rustlers who were the main perpetrators of the rascailly<!-- sic --> rife in that region. Between them and Earps rose a bitter feud over the division of the proceeds of the looting. The Earp boys believed they had failed to get a fair divide of the booty and swore vengeance.

According to Lake's biography, [[dime novel]]ist [[Ned Buntline]] had five Buntline Specials commissioned. Lake described them as extra-long Colt Single Action Army revolvers with {{convert|12|in|adj=on}} barrels. Buntline was supposed to have presented them to lawmen in thanks for their help with contributing \"local color\" to his western yarns. According to Lake, the revolver was equipped with a detachable metal shoulder stock. Lake wrote that Earp and four other well-known western lawmen\u2014[[Bat Masterson]], [[Bill Tilghman]], Charlie Bassett and Neal Brown\u2014each received a Buntline Special. However, neither Tilghman nor Brown were lawmen then.<ref name=\"shillingberg\" />\n\nResearchers have never found any record of an order received by the Colt company, and Ned Buntline's alleged connections to  Earp's have been largely discredited.<ref name=\"shillingberg\" />\n\nAfter the publication of Lake's book, various Colt revolvers with long (10\" or 16\") barrels were referred to as \"Colt Buntlines\". Colt re-introduced the revolvers in its second generation revolvers produced after 1956. The Buntline Special was further popularized by ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'' television series.<ref name=\"shillingberg\" />\n\n=== Dubious claims by Earp ===\nEarp's reputation has been confused by inaccurate, conflicting, and false stories told about him by others, and by his own claims that cannot be corroborated.

In 1888, he was interviewed by an agent of California historian [[Hubert Howe Bancroft|Hubert H.

He worked in a wide variety of trades throughout his life and took part in the famous [[gunfight at the O.K. Corral]], during which lawmen killed three outlaw [[Cochise County Cowboys]]. He's often erroneously regarded as the central figure in the shootout, although his brother [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]] was the Tombstone City ''and'' Deputy U.S. Marshal that day, and had far more experience in combat as a sheriff, constable, marshal, and soldier.<ref name=mighty>[https://www.wearethemighty.com/history/unheralded-hero-of-ok-corral Frontier Lawman Virgil Earp]</ref>\n\nEarp had many other interests besides being a professional gambler, teamster, and buffalo hunter. As an entrepreneur he owned several saloons, maintained a brothel, mined for silver and gold, and refereed boxing matches. He spent his early life in [[Pella, Iowa]]. In 1870, he married Urilla Sutherland, who contracted typhoid fever and died in childbirth.<ref>{{cite web| title = Who was Urilla Sutherland, the first wife of Wyatt Earp?| publisher = True West Magazine| date = August 31, 2011 | url = https://truewestmagazine.com/urilla-sutherland-first-wife-wyatt-earp/| access-date = July 10, 2018}}</ref> During the next two years, Earp was arrested for stealing a horse, escaped from jail, and was sued twice.

In the winter of 1878, he went to Texas to track down an outlaw, and he met [[Doc Holliday|John \"Doc\" Holliday]], whom Earp credited with saving his life.\n\nEarp moved constantly throughout his life from one boomtown to another. He left Dodge City in 1879 and moved with brothers James and Virgil to Tombstone, where a silver boom was underway. The Earps clashed with an informal group of outlaws known as the \"[[Cochise County Cowboys|Cowboys]].\" Wyatt, Virgil, and younger brother [[Morgan Earp|Morgan]] held various law-enforcement positions which put them in conflict with [[Tom McLaury]], [[Frank McLaury]], [[Ike Clanton]], and [[Billy Clanton]] who threatened to kill the Earps on several occasions. The conflict escalated over the next year, culminating in the shootout at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881, where the Earps and Doc Holliday killed three Cowboys. During the next five months, Virgil was ambushed and maimed, and Morgan was assassinated. Wyatt, [[Warren Earp]], Doc Holliday, and others formed a [[Earp Vendetta Ride|federal posse]] which killed three more Cowboys whom they thought responsible. Wyatt was never wounded in any of the gunfights, unlike his brothers Virgil and Morgan or his friend [[Doc Holliday]], which only added to his mystique after his death.\n\nAs a lifelong gambler Earp was always looking for a quick way to make money. After leaving Tombstone, he went to San Francisco where he reunited with [[Josephine Earp|Josephine Marcus]], and she became his [[common-law wife]]. They joined a gold rush to Eagle City, Idaho, where they owned mining interests and a saloon. They left to race horses and open a saloon during a real estate boom in [[San Diego|San Diego, California]]. Back in San Francisco, Wyatt raced horses again, but his reputation suffered irreparably when he refereed the [[Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey]] boxing match and called a foul which led many to believe that he fixed the fight. They moved briefly to [[Yuma, Arizona]], before joining the [[Nome Gold Rush]] in 1899. He and Charlie Hoxie paid $1,500 (about $51,000 in 2018) for a liquor license to open a two-story saloon called the Dexter<ref>{{cite web |last1=Brooks |first1=James |title=Alaska state archive digitizes Wyatt Earp papers |url=http://www.juneauempire.com/state/news/2018-07-30/alaska-state-archive-digitizes-wyatt-earp-papers |website=juneauempire.com |accessdate=July 31, 2018 |language=en|date=July 27, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Records concerning Wyatt Earp; Court liquor license register showing Hoxie and Earp, no. 21, Nome, 1900. :: Alaska State Archives |url=http://vilda.alaska.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/cdmg41/id/1139/rec/3 |website=vilda.alaska.edu |accessdate=July 31, 2018}}</ref><ref name=kirschner2>{{Cite news | url=http://www.truewestmagazine.com/wyatt-earps-alaskan-adventure/| title=Wyatt Earp's Alaskan Adventure| date=March 18, 2014| newspaper=True West Magazine| language=en-US| accessdate=February 12, 2017| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213164147/http://www.truewestmagazine.com/wyatt-earps-alaskan-adventure/| archivedate=February 13, 2017| df=mdy-all}}</ref> and made an estimated $80,000<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.visitnomealaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/WYATT-EARP.pdf| title=Wyatt Earp \u2013 Visit Nome| last=| first=| date=| website=Visit Nome Alaska| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213163814/http://www.visitnomealaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/WYATT-EARP.pdf| archivedate=February 13, 2017| df=mdy-all}}</ref> (about $2 million in 2017). The couple left Alaska and opened another saloon in [[Tonopah, Nevada]], the site of a new gold find. Around 1911, Earp began working several mining claims in [[Vidal, California]], retiring in the hot summers with Josephine to Los Angeles.

This began to change only after his death when the extremely flattering biography ''[[Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal]]'' was published in 1931, becoming a bestseller and creating his reputation as a fearless lawman. Since then, Earp has been the subject of numerous films, television shows, biographies, and works of fiction which have increased both his fame and his notoriety. Long after his death, he has many devoted detractors and admirers. His modern-day reputation is that of the Old West's toughest and deadliest gunman.  \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Early life ==\n{{Main|Nicholas Porter Earp }}\n[[File:Wyatt-earp-mother.jpg|thumb|left|Wyatt Earp w. mother Virginia Ann Cooksey Earp c.&nbsp;1856.]]\nWyatt Berry Stapp Earp was born on March 19, 1848, the fourth child of [[Nicholas Porter Earp]] and his second wife, Virginia Ann Cooksey.

Hurst asked Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp to assist him in tracking [[Cochise County Cowboys|outlaw Cowboys]] who had stolen six Army mules from [[Fort Rucker, Arizona]]. Virgil requested the assistance of his brothers Wyatt and Morgan, along with Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams, and they found the mules at the McLaurys' ranch. (McLaury was a Cowboy, a term which was generally used in that region to refer to a loose association of outlaws, some of whom also were land-owners and ranchers. Legitimate cowmen were referred to as cattle herders or ranchers.) They also found a branding iron which the Cowboys had used to change the \"U.S.\" brand into \"D.8.\"<ref name=\"wyatttestimony\" /> Stealing the mules was a federal offense because the animals were government property.<ref name=lubet/>{{rp|27}}\n\nCowboy Frank Patterson made an agreement with Captain Hurst, and Hurst persuaded the posse to withdraw with the understanding that the mules would be returned. The Cowboys showed up two days later without the mules and laughed at Hurst and the Earps. In response, Hurst printed a handbill describing the theft, and he charged McLaury with hiding the mules. He also reproduced the handbill in ''The Tombstone Epitaph'' on July 30, 1880. McLaury angrily printed a response in the Cowboy-friendly ''Nuggett'', calling Hurst \"unmanly\", \"a coward, a vagabond, a rascal, and a malicious liar\", and accusing him of stealing the mules himself. Hurst later cautioned the Earp brothers that the Cowboys had threatened their lives.<ref name=\"wyatttestimony\" /> Virgil reported that McLaury accosted him and said, \"If you ever again follow us as close as you did, then you will have to fight anyway.\"<ref name=lubet/>{{rp|28}} A month later, Earp ran into Frank and Tom McLaury in Charleston, and they told him that they would kill him if he ever followed them as he had done before.<ref name=\"wyatttestimony\" />\n\n===Becomes deputy sheriff===\nCounty Sheriff [[Charles A.

Sadie Mansfield and Sadie Marcus were both known by their friends as Sadie.

Earp had a common-law relationship with Mattie Blaylock. Modern researchers have found her listed as Earp's wife in the June 1880 census. She suffered from severe headaches and became addicted to [[laudanum]], a commonly used opiate and painkiller, and later committed suicide. When Marcus learned that Stuart Lake had discovered the existence of Blaylock, she successfully demanded that he omit her from his book ''I Married Wyatt Earp''.<ref name=\"mattie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-womenlist-b.html|title=The Complete List of Historical Women \u2013 Last Name Begins with B|publisher=LegendsofAmerica.com|access-date=March 1, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318191932/http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-womenlist-b.html|archivedate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter Marcus arrived in Tombstone with Behan, Earp apparently developed an interest in her, although there are no records in Tombstone of a relationship between Josephine and Earp.

The Earp posse went to Albuquerque, New Mexico, for two weeks.<ref name=\"singer\" />\n\nWyatt and Holliday had been fast friends since Holliday saved Earp's life in Dodge City during 1878.<ref name=\"wyatttestimony\" /> Wyatt was staying with prominent businessman Henry N. Jaffa, who was also president of New Albuquerque's Board of Trade. Like Josephine, Jaffa was Jewish. During their stay in Albuquerque, the two men ate at the Retreat Restaurant owned by \"Fat Charlie\". Former New Mexico Territory Governor [[Miguel Antonio Otero (born 1859)|Miguel Otero]] described in a letter he wrote in 1940 an incident that indicates Earp's feelings for Marcus. He wrote, \"Holliday said something about Earp becoming 'a damn Jew-boy.' Earp became angry and left\u2026. [Henry] Jaffa told me later that Earp's woman was a Jewess. Earp did ''[[mezuzah]]'' when entering the house.\" <ref name=\"singer\"/>\n\nEarp's anger at Holliday's ethnic slur may indicate that his feelings for Josephine were more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information in the letter is compelling because at that time in the 1940s, the possibility of a prior relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus while in Tombstone was unknown.

Enright claimed that the building was on part of his property, and the two men began to argue. Buzzard fired several shots at Enright with his Winchester, then allies of both sides took defensive positions behind snowbanks and began shooting at one another. Earp and his brother James stepped into the middle of the fray and helped peacefully resolve the dispute before anyone was seriously hurt.<ref name=\"tefertiller\" />{{rp|p275\u2013298}}\n\nAround April 1885, Earp reportedly used his badge to join a band of claim jumpers in Embry Camp, later renamed [[Chewelah, Washington]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://themormonworker.wordpress.com/2009/04/26/revolutionary-idaho-the-original-socialist-republic/ |title=Revolutionary Idaho: The Original Socialist Republic |date=April 26, 2009 |access-date=April 11, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726014537/http://themormonworker.wordpress.com/2009/04/26/revolutionary-idaho-the-original-socialist-republic/ |archivedate=July 26, 2011  }}</ref> Within six months, their substantial stake had run dry, and the Earps left the Murray-Eagle district.

The ''[[Seattle Star]]'' noted two weeks later that Earp's saloon was earning a large following. Considine unsuccessfully tried to intimidate Earp, but his saloon continued to prosper. After the city failed to act, on March 23, 1900, the Washington state attorney general filed charges against several gamblers, including Earp and his partner. The club's furnishings were confiscated and burned. The Earps returned briefly to San Francisco in April 1900, but soon continued on to Seattle.\n\nNewspapers in Seattle and San Francisco falsely reported on Wyatt's wealth which prompted a stampede to Nome to seek similar riches.

He wrote:\n\n{{Quote|Wyatt was a shy young man with few intimates. With casual acquaintances he seldom spoke unless spoken to. When he did say anything it was to the point, without fear or favor, which wasn't relished by some; but that never bothered Wyatt. To those who knew him well he was a genial companion. He had the most even disposition I ever saw; I never knew him to lose his temper. He was more intelligent, better educated, and far better mannered than the majority of his associates, which probably did not help them to understand him. His reserve limited his friendships, but more than one stranger, down on his luck, has had firsthand evidence of Wyatt's generosity.

Lake described them as extra-long Colt Single Action Army revolvers with {{convert|12|in|adj=on}} barrels. Buntline was supposed to have presented them to lawmen in thanks for their help with contributing \"local color\" to his western yarns. According to Lake, the revolver was equipped with a detachable metal shoulder stock. Lake wrote that Earp and four other well-known western lawmen\u2014[[Bat Masterson]], [[Bill Tilghman]], Charlie Bassett and Neal Brown\u2014each received a Buntline Special. However, neither Tilghman nor Brown were lawmen then.<ref name=\"shillingberg\" />\n\nResearchers have never found any record of an order received by the Colt company, and Ned Buntline's alleged connections to  Earp's have been largely discredited.<ref name=\"shillingberg\" />\n\nAfter the publication of Lake's book, various Colt revolvers with long (10\" or 16\") barrels were referred to as \"Colt Buntlines\". Colt re-introduced the revolvers in its second generation revolvers produced after 1956. The Buntline Special was further popularized by ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'' television series.<ref name=\"shillingberg\" />\n\n=== Dubious claims by Earp ===\nEarp's reputation has been confused by inaccurate, conflicting, and false stories told about him by others, and by his own claims that cannot be corroborated. For example, in an interview with a reporter in Denver in 1896, he denied that he had killed Johnny Ringo.<ref name=\"gattoringo\" /> He then flipped his story, claiming he had killed Ringo. In 1888, he was interviewed by an agent of California historian [[Hubert Howe Bancroft|Hubert H. Bancroft]], and Earp claimed that he had killed \"over a dozen stage robbers, murderers, and cattle thieves\".<ref name=\"evans\" /> In about 1918 he told Forrestine Hooker, who wrote an unpublished manuscript,<ref name=\"gattoringo\">{{cite web|last=Gatto|first=Steve|title=Johnny Ringo \u2013 The Death of Johnny Ringo|url=http://www.johnnyringo.com/jrdeath.html|access-date=April 16, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406002032/http://www.johnnyringo.com/jrdeath.html|archivedate=April 6, 2011}}</ref> and then Frank Lockwood, who wrote ''Pioneer Days in Arizona'' in 1932,<ref>{{cite web|title=Johnny Ringo History Page|url=http://www.johnnyringo.com/jrdeath.html|access-date=October 24, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406002032/http://www.johnnyringo.com/jrdeath.html|archivedate=April 6, 2011}}</ref> that he was the one who killed Johnny Ringo as he left Arizona in 1882.
