The study sample were the participants of the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study, (KIHD), which includes a randomly selected representative sample of Eastern Finnish men, aged 42\u201360 years at baseline in the 1980s.

Type A subjects are more sensitive to stress and produce more catecholamines than type B subjects. This, in turn, seems to induce an intracellular Mg loss.

The effects were not as dramatic as behavior therapy, but still showed improvement in preventing death among cancer and CHD patients.\n\nFrom the study above, several conclusions have been made. A relationship between personality and cancer exists, along with a relationship between personality and coronary heart disease. Personality type acts as a risk factor for diseases and interacts synergistically with other risk factors, such as smoking and heredity. It has been statistically proven that behavior therapy can significantly reduce the likelihood of cancer or coronary heart disease mortality. On the contrary, [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalysis]] can increase the likelihood of cancer and coronary heart disease mortality drastically.<ref>{{Citation|last=Stoll|first=Basil A.|chapter=Does the Mind Affect Cancer Risk?|date=1989|pages=103\u2013114|publisher=Macmillan Education UK|isbn=9781349107100|doi=10.1007/978-1-349-10708-7_10|title=Social Dilemmas in Cancer Prevention}}</ref> Studies suggest that both body and mental disease arise from each other.

The study sample were the participants of the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study, (KIHD), which includes a randomly selected representative sample of Eastern Finnish men, aged 42\u201360 years at baseline in the 1980s. They were followed up until the end of 2011 through linkage with the National Death Registry. Four self-administered scales, Bortner Short Rating Scale, Framingham Type A Behavior Pattern Scale, Jenkins Activity Survey, and Finnish Type A Scale, were used for Type A assessment at the start of follow-up. Type A measures were inconsistently associated with cardiovascular mortality, and most associations were non-significant. Some scales suggested slightly decreased, rather than increased, risk of CVD death during the follow-up. Associations with non-cardiovascular deaths were even weaker. The study's findings further suggest that there is no evidence to support the Type A as a risk factor for CVD and non-CVD mortality.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=25169700 | doi=10.1007/s12529-014-9435-1 | volume=22 | issue=2 | title=Type A behavior pattern is not a predictor of premature mortality | year=2015 | journal=Int J Behav Med | pages=161\u20139 |vauthors=\u0160migelskas K, \u017demaitien\u0117 N, Julkunen J, Kauhanen J }}</ref>\n\n=== Role of magnesium in cardiovascular health ===\nMaintaining healthy [[magnesium]] (Mg) levels in the body plays a strong role in protecting the cardiovascular health of an individual. An analysis of the literature suggests the possible role of Mg deficiency in the susceptibility to [[cardiovascular disease]]s, observed among subjects displaying a type A behavior pattern. Type A subjects are more sensitive to stress and produce more catecholamines than type B subjects. This, in turn, seems to induce an intracellular Mg loss. In the long run, type A individuals would develop a state of Mg deficiency, which may promote a greater sensitivity to stress and, ultimately, lead to the development of cardiovascular problems.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Type A behavior and magnesium metabolism|date=2013-03-25 |pmid=3523058 | volume=5|issue=3\u20134 |journal=Magnesium|pages=201\u201310 | author = Henrotte JG}}</ref>\n\n=== Substance abuse ===\nIn a 1998 study done by Ball et al., they looked at differences in Type A and Type B personalities based on substance use.

This project ultimately failed but it did result in the current display of totem poles in [[Stanley Park]] which remain one of the most photographed tourist attractions in Vancouver.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1930 the museum sponsored an extensive series of archaeological excavations of the [[Great Marpole Midden|Marpole Midden]] which was one of the most important archaeological sites on the Pacific Northwest Coast but was also an unceded ancestral territory of the [[Musqueam Indian Band|Musqueam]] First Nation and was where the village of c\u0313\u0259sna\u0294\u0259m (Musqueam Marpole Village Site) had been located.  The outcome of this has been dealt with in the award-winning exhibition ''c\u0313\u0259sna\u0294\u0259m, the city before the city'', a joint project between the Musqueam Indian Band, the Museum of Vancouver and the Museum of Anthropology.\n\nIn 1957 the public library which shared the Carnegie building with the museum moved to a new dedicated building in Burrard Street tripling the available storage and display space for the museum and in 1959 the museum was incorporated into the City Council and became a city department under the control of a Civic Museum Board.  A report was commissioned on the future of the museum (the Heinrich Report of 1965) and this recommended the building of a new museum on the south shore of False Creek near the Burrard Bridge.  Federal and provincial money was made available for the 1967 Confederation Centennial celebrations and the current building was constructed which opened to the public in October 1968. From the opening of the new museum building to 1981, the museum was branded as Centennial Museum; before reverting its name back to Vancouver Museum.\n\nIn 1972 the city council relinquished its control of the museum and a joint Museum and Planetarium Association was formed as a descendant of the original AHSA which founded the museum. In 1977 the museum was designated a Category A cultural institution by the federal government and named in the Cultural Property Export and Import Act.\n\nIn 2009, the museum was re-branded as the Museum of Vancouver, in an attempt to reflect its changed focus to Vancouver rather than the lower mainland region of British Columbia as originally set out in its objectives and reaffirmed in 1977.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Building==\n[[File:Museum of Vancouver back.jpg|thumb|The Museum of Vancouver as seen from [[Vanier Park]]. The museum is situated at the southern portion of the park.]]\nThe building was built on traditional, ancestral, unceded land of the Coast Salish People and is located at 1100 Chestnut Street in Vanier Park, in the neighbourhood of Kitsilano in Vancouver, BC. The museum is situated at the south end of [[Vanier Park]], with the park acting as a connecting greenspace between the [[Vancouver Maritime Museum]], [[Bard on the Beach]], the [[City of Vancouver Archives|Vancouver Archives]], and the [[Vancouver Academy of Music]].\n\nThe building was constructed in 1967 to a design by the architect [[Gerald Hamilton (architect)|Gerald Hamilton]] who had studied at [[University of Leeds|Leeds University]] before moving to Vancouver in 1950. Hamilton was a practitioner of the [[New Formalism (architecture)|New Formalism]] school of architecture and its most visible proponent in Vancouver at the time.\n\nOriginally, the building was planned to only house a museum, but a generous gift by the lumber magnate H.R. MacMillan allowed the architect to incorporate a planetarium into the design. As a result, the distinctive roof was added, designed to reflect the shape of a woven basket hat made by Northwest Coast First Nations people.  This decision has created ongoing confusion over the identity of the building as many people associate it mistakenly as only a planetarium whereas the vast majority of the building space is occupied by the galleries of the Museum of Vancouver and the planetarium part was renamed the [[H. R. MacMillan Space Centre|H.R.

This collection was said to be the finest in Canada when reported on by the Vancouver Sun in 1948 and Mary Lipsett was well-respected for her positive relationship with the First Nations and was honoured with the Kwawlewith name 'Ha-wini-po-la-o-gua', which means \u201ca matriarch to whom many come for good counsel.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vancouversun.com/This+week+history+1948+look+extraordinary+collection+First+Nations+Oriental/9648181/story.html|title=This week in history 1948 an extraordinary collection|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>  She donated the entire collection to the then Vancouver Museum and it remains in storage there.\n\nParticular strengths in the MOV collection include:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Ethnology ===\nOne of the most significant Pacific Northwest Coast First Nations collections in Canada with assemblages such as:\n{{col div}} \n* Argillite carvings \n* Small wooden carvings (mini totem poles, figures) \n* Monumental wooden sculptures (totem poles, house posts) \n* Baskets (extensive including [[Nuu-chah-nulth|Nuu-chah-nuith]] and [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]]) \n* Objects carved by [[Charles Edenshaw]] including the Edenshaw Casket \n* Glass slides painted by Frederick Alexcee \n* Basket and bracelet collected by [[George Vancouver]] on his first voyage to the Pacific Northwest \n* Selected masks, boxes, bowls, canoes, carvings, regalia \n* Pauline Johnson's performance costume \n* Human seated figure bowls and other anthropomorphic or zoomorphic carvings in stone\n{{col div end}}\n=== Asian antiquities ===\nThese include collections such as:\n{{col div}}\n* Chinese art objects dating from the Shang dynasty (16th-11th century BCE) to the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) including a comprehensive ceramics collection from the Han dynasty  (206 BCE- 220 CE) to the Qing dynasty (1644-1911; a comprehensive coin collection; ivory carvings, jade carvings, lacquer objects, snuff bottles, textiles, and armour, largely form the Qing dynasty (1644-1911)\n* Japanese objects dating from the Muromachi period (1392-1572) to the Meiji period (1868-1912 ) including woodblock prints, ceramics, ivory carvings, textiles, armour, swords, sword accessories, Buddhist and Shinto objects and dolls (20th century).

This project ultimately failed but it did result in the current display of totem poles in [[Stanley Park]] which remain one of the most photographed tourist attractions in Vancouver.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1930 the museum sponsored an extensive series of archaeological excavations of the [[Great Marpole Midden|Marpole Midden]] which was one of the most important archaeological sites on the Pacific Northwest Coast but was also an unceded ancestral territory of the [[Musqueam Indian Band|Musqueam]] First Nation and was where the village of c\u0313\u0259sna\u0294\u0259m (Musqueam Marpole Village Site) had been located.  The outcome of this has been dealt with in the award-winning exhibition ''c\u0313\u0259sna\u0294\u0259m, the city before the city'', a joint project between the Musqueam Indian Band, the Museum of Vancouver and the Museum of Anthropology.\n\nIn 1957 the public library which shared the Carnegie building with the museum moved to a new dedicated building in Burrard Street tripling the available storage and display space for the museum and in 1959 the museum was incorporated into the City Council and became a city department under the control of a Civic Museum Board.  A report was commissioned on the future of the museum (the Heinrich Report of 1965) and this recommended the building of a new museum on the south shore of False Creek near the Burrard Bridge.  Federal and provincial money was made available for the 1967 Confederation Centennial celebrations and the current building was constructed which opened to the public in October 1968. From the opening of the new museum building to 1981, the museum was branded as Centennial Museum; before reverting its name back to Vancouver Museum.\n\nIn 1972 the city council relinquished its control of the museum and a joint Museum and Planetarium Association was formed as a descendant of the original AHSA which founded the museum. In 1977 the museum was designated a Category A cultural institution by the federal government and named in the Cultural Property Export and Import Act.\n\nIn 2009, the museum was re-branded as the Museum of Vancouver, in an attempt to reflect its changed focus to Vancouver rather than the lower mainland region of British Columbia as originally set out in its objectives and reaffirmed in 1977.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Building==\n[[File:Museum of Vancouver back.jpg|thumb|The Museum of Vancouver as seen from [[Vanier Park]]. The museum is situated at the southern portion of the park.]]\nThe building was built on traditional, ancestral, unceded land of the Coast Salish People and is located at 1100 Chestnut Street in Vanier Park, in the neighbourhood of Kitsilano in Vancouver, BC. The museum is situated at the south end of [[Vanier Park]], with the park acting as a connecting greenspace between the [[Vancouver Maritime Museum]], [[Bard on the Beach]], the [[City of Vancouver Archives|Vancouver Archives]], and the [[Vancouver Academy of Music]].\n\nThe building was constructed in 1967 to a design by the architect [[Gerald Hamilton (architect)|Gerald Hamilton]] who had studied at [[University of Leeds|Leeds University]] before moving to Vancouver in 1950. Hamilton was a practitioner of the [[New Formalism (architecture)|New Formalism]] school of architecture and its most visible proponent in Vancouver at the time.\n\nOriginally, the building was planned to only house a museum, but a generous gift by the lumber magnate H.R. MacMillan allowed the architect to incorporate a planetarium into the design. As a result, the distinctive roof was added, designed to reflect the shape of a woven basket hat made by Northwest Coast First Nations people.  This decision has created ongoing confusion over the identity of the building as many people associate it mistakenly as only a planetarium whereas the vast majority of the building space is occupied by the galleries of the Museum of Vancouver and the planetarium part was renamed the [[H. R. MacMillan Space Centre|H.R. MacMillan Space Centre]] in the late 1990s.<ref name=\":1\" />\nThe building was officially dedicated on May 20, 1967 and the ceremony was attended by Her Royal Highness [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]], who was the granddaughter of [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] and [[George V|King George V]] and also a cousin of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].\n\nAlex Bozikovic remarks that the building closesly resembles the [[John Nugent Studio]] designed by Saskatchewan architect [[Clifford Wiens]] built six years earlier.<ref name=\"Bozikovic\">{{cite news |last1=Bozikovic |first1=Alex |title=Brilliant Saskatchewan architect Clifford Wiens created poetic structures |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/art-and-architecture/article-brilliant-saskatchewan-architect-clifford-wiens-created-poetic/ |accessdate=25 February 2020 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=23 February 2020}}</ref>.

The collection is nationally significant but much of it remains in storage due to a lack of exhibition space.\n\nThe collection includes the First Nations and Oriental artefacts that were collected by Mary Lipsett who established along with her husband the Lipsett Indian Museum which opened in a former aquarium in the PNE grounds in 1941.  This collection was said to be the finest in Canada when reported on by the Vancouver Sun in 1948 and Mary Lipsett was well-respected for her positive relationship with the First Nations and was honoured with the Kwawlewith name 'Ha-wini-po-la-o-gua', which means \u201ca matriarch to whom many come for good counsel.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vancouversun.com/This+week+history+1948+look+extraordinary+collection+First+Nations+Oriental/9648181/story.html|title=This week in history 1948 an extraordinary collection|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>  She donated the entire collection to the then Vancouver Museum and it remains in storage there.\n\nParticular strengths in the MOV collection include:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Ethnology ===\nOne of the most significant Pacific Northwest Coast First Nations collections in Canada with assemblages such as:\n{{col div}} \n* Argillite carvings \n* Small wooden carvings (mini totem poles, figures) \n* Monumental wooden sculptures (totem poles, house posts) \n* Baskets (extensive including [[Nuu-chah-nulth|Nuu-chah-nuith]] and [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]]) \n* Objects carved by [[Charles Edenshaw]] including the Edenshaw Casket \n* Glass slides painted by Frederick Alexcee \n* Basket and bracelet collected by [[George Vancouver]] on his first voyage to the Pacific Northwest \n* Selected masks, boxes, bowls, canoes, carvings, regalia \n* Pauline Johnson's performance costume \n* Human seated figure bowls and other anthropomorphic or zoomorphic carvings in stone\n{{col div end}}\n=== Asian antiquities ===\nThese include collections such as:\n{{col div}}\n* Chinese art objects dating from the Shang dynasty (16th-11th century BCE) to the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) including a comprehensive ceramics collection from the Han dynasty  (206 BCE- 220 CE) to the Qing dynasty (1644-1911; a comprehensive coin collection; ivory carvings, jade carvings, lacquer objects, snuff bottles, textiles, and armour, largely form the Qing dynasty (1644-1911)\n* Japanese objects dating from the Muromachi period (1392-1572) to the Meiji period (1868-1912 ) including woodblock prints, ceramics, ivory carvings, textiles, armour, swords, sword accessories, Buddhist and Shinto objects and dolls (20th century).

The family's roots traced back to the arrival of Richard Brackett in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1629, near present-day [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. His mother's uncle, [[George Henry Corliss]], built the Centennial Engine that powered the 1876 [[Centennial Exposition]] in Philadelphia. A 1915 graduate of [[Williams College]], he earned his degree from [[Harvard University]]. He joined the Allied Expeditionary Force during World War I. He was awarded the French Medal of Honor. He was a frequent contributor to the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', ''[[Collier's]]'', and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', and a drama critic for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' from 1925-29. He wrote five novels: ''The Counsel of the Ungodly'' (1920), ''Week-End'' (1925), ''That Last Infirmity'' (1926), ''American Colony'' (1929),<ref>See Drewey Wayne Gunn, ''Gay American Novels, 1870-1970: A Reader's Guide'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2016), 21-22.</ref> and ''Entirely Surrounded'' (1934).\n\nBrackett was president of the [[Screen Writers Guild]] (1938\u20131939). He was president of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] from 1949 through 1955. Brackett either wrote or produced over 40 films during his career, including ''[[To Each His Own (film)|To Each His Own]]'', ''[[Ninotchka]]'', ''[[The Major and the Minor]]'', ''[[The Mating Season (film)|The Mating Season]]'' (1951), ''[[Niagara (film)|Niagara]]'', ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'', ''[[Ten North Frederick (film)|Ten North Frederick]]'', ''[[The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker]]'', and ''[[Blue Denim]]''.\n\nFrom 1936-50, Brackett worked with [[Billy Wilder]] as his collaborator on thirteen movies, including ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' (1945) and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950), which won [[Academy Award]]s for their screenplays. The duo's professional partnership ended in 1950, after the completion of ''Sunset Boulevard''. Brackett then went to work at [[20th Century-Fox]] as a screenwriter and producer. His script for ''[[Titanic (1953 film)|Titanic]]'' (1953) won him another Academy Award. He received an [[Honorary Oscar]] for Lifetime Achievement in 1958.\n\n==Marriages==\nBrackett married Elizabeth Barrows Fletcher, a descendant of [[Stephen Hopkins (settler)|Stephen Hopkins]] of the ''[[Mayflower]]'', on June 2, 1919, in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. They had two daughters, Alexandra Corliss Brackett, Mrs. Larmore (1920\u20131965) and Elizabeth Fletcher Brackett (1922\u20131997). Elizabeth Fletcher Brackett the elder died on June 7, 1948.

The family's roots traced back to the arrival of Richard Brackett in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1629, near present-day [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. His mother's uncle, [[George Henry Corliss]], built the Centennial Engine that powered the 1876 [[Centennial Exposition]] in Philadelphia. A 1915 graduate of [[Williams College]], he earned his degree from [[Harvard University]]. He joined the Allied Expeditionary Force during World War I. He was awarded the French Medal of Honor. He was a frequent contributor to the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', ''[[Collier's]]'', and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', and a drama critic for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' from 1925-29. He wrote five novels: ''The Counsel of the Ungodly'' (1920), ''Week-End'' (1925), ''That Last Infirmity'' (1926), ''American Colony'' (1929),<ref>See Drewey Wayne Gunn, ''Gay American Novels, 1870-1970: A Reader's Guide'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2016), 21-22.</ref> and ''Entirely Surrounded'' (1934).\n\nBrackett was president of the [[Screen Writers Guild]] (1938\u20131939). He was president of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] from 1949 through 1955. Brackett either wrote or produced over 40 films during his career, including ''[[To Each His Own (film)|To Each His Own]]'', ''[[Ninotchka]]'', ''[[The Major and the Minor]]'', ''[[The Mating Season (film)|The Mating Season]]'' (1951), ''[[Niagara (film)|Niagara]]'', ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'', ''[[Ten North Frederick (film)|Ten North Frederick]]'', ''[[The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker]]'', and ''[[Blue Denim]]''.\n\nFrom 1936-50, Brackett worked with [[Billy Wilder]] as his collaborator on thirteen movies, including ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' (1945) and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950), which won [[Academy Award]]s for their screenplays. The duo's professional partnership ended in 1950, after the completion of ''Sunset Boulevard''. Brackett then went to work at [[20th Century-Fox]] as a screenwriter and producer. His script for ''[[Titanic (1953 film)|Titanic]]'' (1953) won him another Academy Award. He received an [[Honorary Oscar]] for Lifetime Achievement in 1958.\n\n==Marriages==\nBrackett married Elizabeth Barrows Fletcher, a descendant of [[Stephen Hopkins (settler)|Stephen Hopkins]] of the ''[[Mayflower]]'', on June 2, 1919, in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. They had two daughters, Alexandra Corliss Brackett, Mrs. Larmore (1920\u20131965) and Elizabeth Fletcher Brackett (1922\u20131997). Elizabeth Fletcher Brackett the elder died on June 7, 1948. In 1953, Brackett married his sister-in-law (Elizabeth's sister, Lillian Fletcher); that union was childless.<ref>Hopper, H. (December 27, 1953).
