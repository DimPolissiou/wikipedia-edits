The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with caustic soda to pH 3\u20134. [[Thorium]] precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed.

Terbium is separated as a double salt with [[ammonium nitrate]] by crystallization.<ref name=patnaik/>\n\nThe most efficient separation routine for terbium salt from the rare-earth salt solution is [[ion exchange]]. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. As with other rare earths, terbium metal is produced by reducing the anhydrous chloride or fluoride with calcium metal. Calcium and [[tantalum]] impurities can be removed by vacuum remelting, distillation, amalgam formation or [[zone melting]].<ref name=patnaik/>\n\n== Applications ==\nTerbium is used as a [[dopant]] in [[calcium fluoride]], calcium [[tungstate]], and [[strontium]] [[molybdate]], materials that are used in solid-state devices, and as a crystal stabilizer of [[fuel cell]]s which operate at elevated temperatures, together with [[zirconium(IV) oxide|ZrO<sub>2</sub>]].<ref name=CRC>{{cite book | editor = Lide, D.

The insoluble oxide of this element was noted to be tinged brown.\n\nLater workers had difficulty in observing the minor colorless \"erbia\", but the soluble pink fraction was impossible to miss. Arguments went back and forth as to whether erbia even existed. In the confusion, the original names got reversed, and the exchange of names stuck, so that the pink fraction referred eventually to the solution containing erbium (which in solution, is pink). It is now thought that workers using double sodium or [[potassium sulfate]]s to remove ceria from yttria inadvertently lost the terbium into the ceria-containing precipitate. What is now known as terbium was only about 1% of the original yttria, but that was sufficient to impart a yellowish color to the yttrium oxide. Thus, terbium was a minor component in the original fraction containing it, where it was dominated by its immediate neighbors, [[gadolinium]] and [[dysprosium]].\n\nThereafter, whenever other rare earths were teased apart from this mixture, whichever fraction gave the brown oxide retained the terbium name, until at last, the brown oxide of terbium was obtained in pure form. The 19th century investigators did not have the benefit of the UV fluorescence technology to observe the brilliant yellow or green Tb(III) fluorescence that would have made terbium easier to identify in solid mixtures or solutions.<ref name=history>{{cite book| page = 5| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E1npz8pwmYwC&pg=PA5| title =Extractive metallurgy of rare earths| author =Gupta, C.

After that the solution is treated with [[ammonium oxalate]] to convert rare earths into their insoluble [[oxalate]]s. The oxalates are decomposed to oxides by heating.

Terbium is separated as a double salt with [[ammonium nitrate]] by crystallization.<ref name=patnaik/>\n\nThe most efficient separation routine for terbium salt from the rare-earth salt solution is [[ion exchange]]. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. As with other rare earths, terbium metal is produced by reducing the anhydrous chloride or fluoride with calcium metal.

She only swum in the heats of the [[Swimming at the 2005 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4\u00d7100&nbsp;m freestyle]] and the [[Swimming at the 2005 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 200 metre freestyle relay|4\u00d7200&nbsp;m freestyle events]]. She competed in the [[2006 European Aquatics Championships|European LC Championships 2006]] and the [[European Short Course Swimming Championships]]. But individually she did not advance past the heats in both events.\n\nAt the [[Swimming at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships|World LC Championships 2007]] she won a bronze medal in the [[Swimming at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4\u00d7100&nbsp;m freestyle]] together with [[Inge Dekker]], [[Ranomi Kromowidjojo]] and [[Marleen Veldhuis]].

The next month she competed in [[Manchester]] at the [[2008 FINA Short Course World Championships|World SC Championships 2008]] where she again broke two relay records in the 4\u00d7200&nbsp;m freestyle with the same team as in Eindhoven. In the 4\u00d7100&nbsp;m freestyle [[Hinkelien Schreuder]] replaced [[Ranomi Kromowidjojo]] who suffered from an elbow injury. She won her first individual medal, a silver medal, in the 200&nbsp;m freestyle at the last day of the tournament. During the National Championships in June 2008, Heemskerk lowered three national records on the long course, 200&nbsp;m freestyle, 200&nbsp;m individual medley and 100&nbsp;m backstroke.\n\n===2008 Summer Olympics===\nAt the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]] she won a gold medal with the [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4\u00d7100&nbsp;m freestyle relay]].

Heemskerk was the lead-off swimmer in both [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 200 metre freestyle relay|4\u00d7200&nbsp;m freestyle]] and [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre medley relay|4\u00d7100&nbsp;m medley relays]], both of which did not qualify for the finals.\n\n===Fall 2008===\nAfter the Olympics Heemskerk returned to competition at the [[2008 European Aquatics Championships]] where she qualified for the [[2009 World Aquatics Championships]] in the [[Swimming at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Women's 100 metre freestyle|100&nbsp;m]] and [[Swimming at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Women's 200 metre freestyle|200&nbsp;m freestyle]]. The week afterwards she participated in the [[2008 European Short Course Swimming Championships]] in [[Rijeka]], [[Croatia]]. There she won a silver medal in the 200&nbsp;m freestyle behind [[Federica Pellegrini]]. She also finished fifth in the 100&nbsp;m medley.
