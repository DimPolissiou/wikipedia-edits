Hosted by [[Paul McDermott (comedian)|Paul McDermott]], the show is a form of dance competition, with each episode featuring four dance couples from around Australia and New Zealand. The competition has three rounds, each consisting of two similar dance types. The styles range from basic traditionals, such as [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|Cha-Cha]] and [[Rhumba|Rumba]], to modern styles of [[Hip hop music|Hip-Hop]], to strange hybrids.\n\nCompetitors are picked via auditioning, which is done around Australia before each season. Chosen competitors are alerted three weeks in advance of their appearance of their dances and competition date (to give all competitors the same amount of time to learn a routine). Whilst the actual show is only a half-hour segment and appears to be live, the creation takes over eight hours and competitors usually have ample time to return home and watch themselves on TV, and as such are made to sign a contract forbidding them from revealing their final position.\n\nScoring is done by three judges, with the score out of 10 (with up to one decimal place) for each dance, with the average of the three being the score. All scores are then added up. On top of the dance score, the judges award the dances at the end of the show with an X-Factor score. This score has no relation to the technical side of the dancing, but relates to the other factors that improve the dance, such as dancers compatibility or energy. This makes things more interesting as a technically better dance couple may lose to a couple who appeared more captivating or simply 'worked better' together. The winner of the round qualifies for the semi-finals. The winner of the finals receives a cash prize and a flower [[nosegay|bouquet]]. The runners up receive a cash prize of half the first prize amount.\n\nThe show has drawn both acclaim and criticism. Traditionalists have criticised the show for its sometimes bizarre dance combinations and newer dances, whereas others praise it for testing out dancers versatility and adaptability to new styles. The show is also regarded to have started a new interest in dancing as a sport, with the [[Seven Network]] introducing its own dancing show ''[[Dancing with the Stars (Australian TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', in which celebrities with no dance background are partnered with a professional dancer.\n\nThe show features its own [[house band]] who play the music to which the dancers perform, with a variety of music being used. Voice-over commentary is provided during the dancing by two commentators, as in sports broadcasting, with a selected highlight being repeated at the end of the round. At the end of each show, the live studio audience is invited to come onto the floor and dance.

Hosted by [[Paul McDermott (comedian)|Paul McDermott]], the show is a form of dance competition, with each episode featuring four dance couples from around Australia and New Zealand. The competition has three rounds, each consisting of two similar dance types. The styles range from basic traditionals, such as [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|Cha-Cha]] and [[Rhumba|Rumba]], to modern styles of [[Hip hop music|Hip-Hop]], to strange hybrids.\n\nCompetitors are picked via auditioning, which is done around Australia before each season. Chosen competitors are alerted three weeks in advance of their appearance of their dances and competition date (to give all competitors the same amount of time to learn a routine). Whilst the actual show is only a half-hour segment and appears to be live, the creation takes over eight hours and competitors usually have ample time to return home and watch themselves on TV, and as such are made to sign a contract forbidding them from revealing their final position.\n\nScoring is done by three judges, with the score out of 10 (with up to one decimal place) for each dance, with the average of the three being the score. All scores are then added up. On top of the dance score, the judges award the dances at the end of the show with an X-Factor score. This score has no relation to the technical side of the dancing, but relates to the other factors that improve the dance, such as dancers compatibility or energy. This makes things more interesting as a technically better dance couple may lose to a couple who appeared more captivating or simply 'worked better' together. The winner of the round qualifies for the semi-finals. The winner of the finals receives a cash prize and a flower [[nosegay|bouquet]]. The runners up receive a cash prize of half the first prize amount.\n\nThe show has drawn both acclaim and criticism. Traditionalists have criticised the show for its sometimes bizarre dance combinations and newer dances, whereas others praise it for testing out dancers versatility and adaptability to new styles. The show is also regarded to have started a new interest in dancing as a sport, with the [[Seven Network]] introducing its own dancing show ''[[Dancing with the Stars (Australian TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', in which celebrities with no dance background are partnered with a professional dancer.\n\nThe show features its own [[house band]] who play the music to which the dancers perform, with a variety of music being used. Voice-over commentary is provided during the dancing by two commentators, as in sports broadcasting, with a selected highlight being repeated at the end of the round. At the end of each show, the live studio audience is invited to come onto the floor and dance. The show had three seasons, two in 2004 and one 2005.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n\n[[Category:Australian Broadcasting Corporation shows]]\n[[Category:Australian reality television series]]\n\n[[Category:2004 Australian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2005 Australian television series endings]]\n[[Category:Dance competition television shows]]\n[[Category:2000s Australian television series]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in New South Wales]]\n", "name_user": "Rich Farmbrough", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:Update date format tag", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strictly_Dancing"}

Science) at the [[National University of Singapore]] (NUS), that university paid for an Apache server, staff to set up and maintain it, and undergraduate research assistants, who did scanning and OCR work, and Postdoctoral and Senior Fellows, who created content. Dr. [[John van Wyhe]] created the vast majority of material in the science section, which includes primary materials in both French and English, and Dr. Marjorie Bloy created almost all the material about Victorian social and political history. Dr. Tamara S. Wagner, a fellow who worked primarily on a sister site, the Postcolonial Literature and Culture Web, also contributed essays on literary subjects. Philip V. Allingham spent  a month at NUS as a Research Fellow, where he began the large section on book illustration and Victorian novelists to which he still contributes.\nSince 2000, hundreds of scholars, chiefly from the UK and North America, have contributed more than 50,000 documents and images.

The visual arts section ranges widely over painting, photography, book design and illustration, sculpture, and the decorative arts, including ceramics, furniture, stained glass and metalwork. Jewelry, textiles, and costume are amongst other topics discussed and illustrated on its website. Awards indicate that it is particularly strong in literature, painting, architecture, sculpture, book illustration, history and religion.\n\nIn contrast to archives and web-based libraries, the Victorian Web presents its images and documents, including entire books, as nodes in a network of complex connections.<ref>George P.
