Eno tore down the four-story St. Germaine Hotel on the south end of the lot, and replaced it with a seven-story apartment building, the Cumberland. On the remainder of the lot he built four three-story buildings for commercial use. This left four stories of the Cumberland's northern face exposed, which Eno rented out to advertisers, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', who installed a sign made up of electric lights. Eno later put a canvas screen on the wall, and projected images onto it from a [[magic lantern]] on top of one of his smaller buildings, presenting advertisements and interesting pictures alternately. Both the ''Times'' and the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' began using the screen for news bulletins, and on election nights tens of thousands of people would gather in Madison Square, waiting for the latest results.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pages=26-29}}\n\nDuring his life Eno resisted suggestions to sell \"Eno's flatiron\", as the site had become known, but after his death in 1899 his assets were liquidated, and the lot went up for sale. The [[New York State Assembly]] appropriated $3 million for the city to buy it, but this fell through when a newspaper reporter discovered that the plan was a [[Graft (politics)|graft]] scheme by [[Tammany Hall]] boss [[Richard Croker]]. Instead, the lot was bought at auction by William Eno, one of Amos's sons, for $690,000 \u2013 the elder Eno had bought the property for around $30,000 forty years earlier. Three weeks later, William re-sold the lot to [[Samuel Newhouse|Samuel]] and Mott Newhouse for $801,000. The Newhouses intended to put up a 12-story building with street-level retail shops and bachelor apartments above, but two years later they sold the lot for about $2 million to Cumberland Realty Company, an investment partnership created by [[Harry S. Black]], CEO of the [[Fuller Company]]. The Fuller Company was the first true [[general contractor]] that dealt with all aspects of building construction except design, and they specialized in building skyscrapers.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pages=29-41}}\n\nBlack intended to construct a new headquarters building on the site, despite the recent deterioration of the surrounding neighborhood,{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pages=29-41}} and he engaged Chicago architect [[Daniel Burnham]] to design it. The building, which would be Burnham's first in New York City,<ref name=treasure /> would also be the first skyscraper north of [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]].{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=60}} It was to be named the Fuller Building after [[George A. Fuller]], founder of the Fuller Company and \"father of the skyscraper\", who had died two years earlier, but locals persisted in calling it \"[[Clothes iron|The Flatiron]]\",<ref name=waporev /><ref>\"Flatiron Structure to be Called the Fuller Building\", ''The New York Times'' (August 9, 1902) page 3.</ref><ref>\"New Building on the Flatiron\" ''The New York Times'' (March 3, 3, 1901), page 8: \"the famous 'flatiron' block\"</ref> a name which has since been made official.{{sfn|Brown|Dixon|Gillham|2014}}\n\n[[File:Flatiron Building Construction, New York Times - Library of Congress, 1901-1902 crop.JPG|thumb|left|267px|alt=A diagram depicting the phases of the Flatiron Building's construction|Construction phases]]\n\n===Construction===\n\nOnce construction of the building began, it proceeded at a very fast pace. The steel was so meticulously pre-cut that the frame went up at the rate of a floor each week. By February 1902 the frame was complete, and by mid-May the building was half-covered by terra-cotta tiling. The building was completed in June 1902, after a year of construction.<ref name=treasure /> \n\nThe Flatiron Building was not the first building of its triangular ground-plan: aside from a possibly unique triangular Roman temple built on a similarly constricted site in the city of [[Verulamium|Verulamium, Britannia]],<ref>Noted, \"Roman city in Britain had Flatiron Building\", ''[[Science News|The Science News-Letter]]'' '''24''' No. 657 (November 11, 1933:311).</ref> the [[Historic Inns of Annapolis#The Maryland Inn|Maryland Inn]] in [[Annapolis]] (1782), the [[Hanover Square, Syracuse|Granger Block]] in [[Syracuse, New York]] (1869), the [[Phelan Building]] in [[San Francisco]] (1881), the [[Gooderham Building]] of [[Toronto]] (1892), and the [[English-American Building]] in [[Atlanta]] (1897) predate it. All, however, are smaller than their New York counterpart.\n\nTwo features were added to the Flatiron Building following its completion. The \"cowcatcher\" retail space at the front of the building was added in order to maximize the use of the building's lot and produce some retail income. Harry Black had insisted on the space, despite objections from Burnham.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=101-03}} Another addition to the building not in the original plan was the penthouse, which was constructed after the rest of the building had been completed to be used as artists' studios, and was quickly rented out to artists such as [[Louis Fancher]], many of whom contributed to the [[pulp magazine]]s which were produced in the offices below.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=201-02}}\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n[[File:Albert Gleizes Sur le Flat-iron 1916.jpg|thumb|225px|alt=Sur le Flatiron, Albert Gleizes, gouache and ink (1916)|''Sur le Flatiron'', [[Albert Gleizes]], gouache and ink (1916)|left]]\n\n===Initial response===\nThe Flatiron Building became an icon of New York City, and the public response to it was enthusiastic,<ref name=treasure /><ref>[[Witold Rybczynski|Rybczynski, Witold]]. ''City Life: Urban Expectations in a New World'' New York: Scribner, 1995. p. 153. {{ISBN|0-684-81302-5}}. Quote: \"The public loved the Flatiron, and businessmen and their architects took notice.\"</ref> but the critical response to it at the time was not completely positive, and what praise it garnered was often for the cleverness of the engineering involved. [[Montgomery Schuyler]], editor of ''[[Architectural Record]]'', said that its \"awkwardness [is] entirely undisguised, and without even an attempt to disguise them, if they have not even been aggravated by the treatment. ... The treatment of the tip is an additional and it seems wanton aggravation of the inherent awkwardness of the situation.\"<ref>''[[Architectural Record]]'' (October 1902), quoted in Alexiou, pp. 125\u201326</ref> He praised the surface of the building, and the detailing of the terra-cotta work, but criticized the practicality of the large number of windows in the building: \"[The tenant] can, perhaps, find wall space within for one roll top desk without overlapping the windows, with light close in front of him and close behind him and close on one side of him. But suppose he needed a bookcase? Undoubtedly he has a highly eligible place from which to view processions. But for the transaction of business?\"{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=138}}\n\nWhen the building was first constructed, it received mixed feedback. The most known criticism received was known as \"Burnham's Folly\". This criticism, focused on the structure of the building, was made on the grounds that the \"combination of triangular shape and height would cause the building to fall down.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/flatiron-building|title=Flatiron Building - Facts & Summary|last=|first=|date=2010|website=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|history.com]]|publisher=[[A&E Networks]]|access-date=July 29, 2017}}</ref> Critics believed that the building created a dangerous wind-tunnel at the intersection of the two streets, and could possibly knock the building down.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKoyDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA82|title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide USA|last=DK|date=May 16, 2017|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781465466365|language=en}}</ref> Although the wind is strong at the intersection, the building's structure was meant to accommodate four times the typical wind loads in order to stabilize and retain the building's iconic triangular shape.\n\nThe ''[[New York Tribune]]'' called the new building \"A stingy piece of pie ... the greatest inanimate troublemaker in New York\", while the [[Municipal Art Society]] said that it was \"Unfit to be in the Center of the City\". ''The New York Times'' called it a \"monstrosity\".<ref name=\"treasure\" /> But some saw the building differently. Futurist [[H. G. Wells]] wrote in his 1906 book ''The Future in America: A Search After Realities'':\n\n<blockquote>I found myself agape, admiring a sky-scraper the prow of the Flat-iron Building, to be particular, ploughing up through the traffic of Broadway and Fifth Avenue in the afternoon light.<ref>[[H. G. Wells|Wells, H. G.]] ''[https://archive.org/stream/hgwellsfuture00wellrich/hgwellsfuture00wellrich_djvu.txt The Future in America: A Search After Realities]''. London:Harpers,1906.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Flatiron was to attract the attention of numerous artists. It was the subject of one of [[Edward Steichen]]'s atmospheric photographs, taken on a wet wintry late afternoon in 1904, as well as a memorable image by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] taken the year before, to which Steichen was paying homage. ''(See [[#iconic images|below]])''{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=153-57}} Stieglitz reflected on the dynamic symbolism of the building, noting upon seeing it one day during a snowstorm that \"... it appeared to be moving toward me like the bow of a monster ocean steamer \u2013 a picture of a new America still in the making,\"<ref name=treasure /><ref>[http://magicalhystorytour.blogspot.com/2010/08/skyscrapers.html \"Skyscrapers\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629192827/http://magicalhystorytour.blogspot.com/2010/08/skyscrapers.html |date=June 29, 2015 }} ''Magical Hystory Tour:The Origins of the Commonplace & Curious in America'' (September 1, 2010)</ref><ref>Burns, Ric & Sanders, James ''New York: An Illustrated History'', 233(1999)</ref> and remarked that what the [[Parthenon]] was to Athens, the Flatiron was to New York.<ref name=wsjrev /> When Stieglitz' photograph was published in ''Camera Work'', his friend [[Sadakichi Hartmann]], a writer, painter and photographer, accompanied it with an essay on the building: \"A curious creation, no doubt, but can it be called beautiful? Beauty is a very abstract idea ... Why should the time not arrive when the majority without hesitation will pronounce the 'Flat-iron' a thing of beauty?\"{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=156}}\n\nBesides Stieglitz and Steichen, photographers such as [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]], [[Jessie Tarbox Beals]], painters of the [[Ashcan School]] like [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], [[Everett Shinn]] and [[Ernest Lawson]], as well as [[Paul Cornoyer]] and [[Childe Hassam]], [[lithography|lithographer]] [[Joseph Pennell]], illustrator [[John Edward Jackson (illustrator)|John Edward Jackson]] as well the French [[Cubism|Cubist]] [[Albert Gleizes]] all took the Flatiron as the subject of their work.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=158-59, 236}} But decades after it was completed, others still could not come to terms with the building. Sculptor [[William Ordway Partridge]] remarked that it was \"a disgrace to our city, an outrage to our sense of the artistic, and a menace to life\".<ref>In ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (August 12, 1939), quoted in Alexiou, p. 126</ref>\n\n[[File:Flatiron Building and Street Scene October 8th 1902 New York City.ogv|thumb|250px|alt=A 1892 movie showing street life and the Flatiron Building|Movie showing street life and the Flatiron Building, 1902]]\n[[File:Colonel Donovan and staff of 165th Infantry, passing under the Victory Arch, New York City., 1919 - NARA - 533479.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=A 1919 image of the 165th Infantry Regiment passing through Madison Square's Victory Arch.

In 1910, Harry Black moved the company to [[Francis H. Kimball|Francis Kimball]]'s [[Trinity Building]] at 111 Broadway, where its parent company, U.S. Realty, had its offices. U.S. Realty moved its offices back to the Flatiron in 1916, and left permanently for the [[Fuller Building]] on 57th Street in 1929.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=214, 244, 252}}\n\nThe Flatiron's other original tenants included publishers (magazine publishing pioneer [[Frank Munsey]], ''American Architect and Building News'' and a vanity publisher), an insurance company (the [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable Life Assurance Society]]), small businesses (a patent medicine company, Western Specialty Manufacturing Company and Whitehead & Hoag, who made celluloid novelties), music publishers (overflow from \"[[Tin Pan Alley]]\" up on [[28th Street (Manhattan)|28th Street]]), a landscape architect, the [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] Consulate, the Bohemian Guides Society, the Roebling Construction Company, owned by the sons of [[Tammany Hall]] boss [[Richard Croker]], and the crime syndicate, [[Murder, Inc.]]<ref name=treasure />\n\nThe retail space in the [[Flatiron Building#Cowcatcher space|building's \"cowcatcher\"]] at the \"prow\" was leased by [[United Cigar Stores]], and the building's vast cellar, which extended into the vaults that went more than {{convert|20|ft|m}} under the surrounding streets,{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=89}} was occupied by the Flatiron Restaurant, which could seat 1,500 patrons and was open from breakfast through late supper for those taking in a performance at one of the many [[Rialto, Manhattan|theatres which lined Broadway between 14th and 23rd Streets]].{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=133-41}}\n\nIn 1911, the building introduced a restaurant/club in the basement. It was among the first of its kind that allowed a black Jazz band to perform, thus introducing [[ragtime]] to affluent New Yorkers.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010}}\n\nEven before construction on the Flatiron Building had begun, the area around [[Madison Square]] had started to deteriorate somewhat. After U.S. Realty constructed the [[New York Hippodrome]], [[Madison Square Garden II|Madison Square Garden]] was no longer the venue of choice, and survived largely by staging [[boxing]] matches. The base of the Flatiron became a cruising spot for gay men, including some male [[prostitutes]].{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=233}} Nonetheless, in 1911 the Flatiron Restaurant was bought by Louis Bustanoby, of the well-known Caf\u00e9 des Beaux-Arts, and converted into a trendy 400-seat French restaurant, Taverne Louis. As an innovation to attract customers away from another restaurant opened by his brothers, Bustanoby hired a black musical group, [[Louis Mitchell]] and his Southern Symphony Quintette, to play dance tunes at the Taverne and the Caf\u00e9. [[Irving Berlin]] heard the group at the Taverne and suggested that they should try to get work in London, which they did.{{efn-ua|Mitchell would later become a headliner and nightclub owner [[Paris]], becoming a millionaire before losing it all. He returned to the U.S., where he drove a beer truck in [[Washington, D.C.]] {{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=232\u2013234, 261\u2013264}}}} The Taverne's openness was also indicated by its welcoming a gay clientele, unusual for a restaurant of its type at the time.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=220-27}} The Taverne was forced to close due to the effects of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] on the restaurant business.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=245}}\n\n===Sales and new tenants===\nIn October 1925, Harry S. Black, in need of cash for his [[U.S. Realty Company]], sold the Flatiron Building to a syndicate set up by [[Lewis Rosenbaum]], who also owned assorted other notable buildings around the U.S. The price was $2 million, which equaled Black's cost for buying the lot and erecting the Flatiron.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=244-45}} The syndicate defaulted on its mortgage in 1933, and was taken over by the lender, [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable Life Assurance Company]] after failing to sell it at auction.

Though Burnham maintained overall control of the design process, he was not directly connected with the details of the structure as built. That task was performed by his designer [[Frederick P. Dinkelberg]], a Pennsylvania-born architect in Burnham's office, who first worked for Burnham in putting together the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, for which Burnham was the chief of construction and master designer.<ref group=\"upper-alpha\">Other buildings by Dinkelberg at D.

This opened the way for steel-skeleton construction.<ref name=treasure /> Since it employed a steel skeleton{{efn-ua|According to the ''[[AIA Guide to New York City]]'' (5th edition), the belief that the Flatiron Building was one of the first building or skyscraper in New York with a steel skeleton is untrue. \"[D]ozens of New York commercial buildings had been steel-framed in the 1890s, including the tallest at the time, the 391-foot [[Park Row Building]].\"<ref name=aia />}} \u2013 with the steel coming from the [[American Bridge Company]] in [[Pennsylvania]]{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=94}} \u2013 it could be built to 22 stories (285&nbsp;feet) relatively easily, which would have been difficult using other construction methods of that time.<ref>Terranova, Antonino.

At the vertex, the triangular tower is only 6.5 feet (2&nbsp;m) wide; viewed from above, this pointed end of the structure describes an acute angle of about 25 degrees.<ref>[http://dome.mit.edu/handle/1721.3/82968 \"Flatiron Building\"] ''Dome'' the website of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT Libraries]], citing [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/ Grove Art Online]</ref>\n\n[[Purdy and Henderson, Engineers|Purdy and Henderson]] were the structural engineers. They strengthened the structure to deal with the wind load, as the building was quite narrow and therefore had less volume to resist it. They designed it so that, in theory, the building would turn compactly before any failure could occur in the metal structure. For the first time the construction of a skyscraper steel structure could be witnessed in full by the public, an event that received a great response and was immortalized by photographers Edward Steichen and Alfred Stieglitz.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.wikiarquitectura.com/building/flatiron-building/|title=Flatiron Building |access-date=October 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Design features===\n{{Anchor|Cowcatcher space}}The \"cowcatcher\" retail space at the front of the building was not part of Burnham or Dinkelberg's design, but was added at the insistence of Harry Black in order to maximize the use of the building's lot and produce some retail income to help defray the cost of construction. Black pushed Burnham hard for plans for the addition, but Burnham resisted because of the aesthetic effect it would have on the design of the \"prow\" of the building, where it would interrupt the two-story high Classical columns which were echoed at the top of the building by two columns which supported the cornice. Black insisted, and Burnham was forced to accept the addition, despite the interruption of the design's symmetry.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=101-03}} \n\nThe building was considered to be \"quirky\" overall, with drafty wood-framed and cooper-clad windows, no central air conditioning, a heating system which utilized cast-iron radiators, an antiquated sprinkler system, and a single staircase should evacuation of the building be necessary.  The triangular shape of the structure led to a \"rabbit warren\" of oddly-shaped rooms.<ref name=era /> Other oddities about the building's interior include that bathrooms for males and females are placed on alternating floors, with the men's rooms on even floors and the women's rooms on odd ones. Additionally, to reach the top floor &ndash; the 21st, which was added in 1905, three years after the building was completed &ndash; a second elevator has to be taken from the 20th floor.

Eno tore down the four-story St. Germaine Hotel on the south end of the lot, and replaced it with a seven-story apartment building, the Cumberland. On the remainder of the lot he built four three-story buildings for commercial use. This left four stories of the Cumberland's northern face exposed, which Eno rented out to advertisers, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', who installed a sign made up of electric lights. Eno later put a canvas screen on the wall, and projected images onto it from a [[magic lantern]] on top of one of his smaller buildings, presenting advertisements and interesting pictures alternately. Both the ''Times'' and the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' began using the screen for news bulletins, and on election nights tens of thousands of people would gather in Madison Square, waiting for the latest results.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pages=26-29}}\n\nDuring his life Eno resisted suggestions to sell \"Eno's flatiron\", as the site had become known, but after his death in 1899 his assets were liquidated, and the lot went up for sale. The [[New York State Assembly]] appropriated $3 million for the city to buy it, but this fell through when a newspaper reporter discovered that the plan was a [[Graft (politics)|graft]] scheme by [[Tammany Hall]] boss [[Richard Croker]]. Instead, the lot was bought at auction by William Eno, one of Amos's sons, for $690,000 \u2013 the elder Eno had bought the property for around $30,000 forty years earlier. Three weeks later, William re-sold the lot to [[Samuel Newhouse|Samuel]] and Mott Newhouse for $801,000. The Newhouses intended to put up a 12-story building with street-level retail shops and bachelor apartments above, but two years later they sold the lot for about $2 million to Cumberland Realty Company, an investment partnership created by [[Harry S. Black]], CEO of the [[Fuller Company]]. The Fuller Company was the first true [[general contractor]] that dealt with all aspects of building construction except design, and they specialized in building skyscrapers.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pages=29-41}}\n\nBlack intended to construct a new headquarters building on the site, despite the recent deterioration of the surrounding neighborhood,{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pages=29-41}} and he engaged Chicago architect [[Daniel Burnham]] to design it. The building, which would be Burnham's first in New York City,<ref name=treasure /> would also be the first skyscraper north of [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]].{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=60}} It was to be named the Fuller Building after [[George A. Fuller]], founder of the Fuller Company and \"father of the skyscraper\", who had died two years earlier, but locals persisted in calling it \"[[Clothes iron|The Flatiron]]\",<ref name=waporev /><ref>\"Flatiron Structure to be Called the Fuller Building\", ''The New York Times'' (August 9, 1902) page 3.</ref><ref>\"New Building on the Flatiron\" ''The New York Times'' (3 March 3, 1901), page 8: \"the famous 'flatiron' block\"</ref> a name which has since been made official.{{sfn|Brown|Dixon|Gillham|2014}}\n\n[[File:Flatiron Building Construction, New York Times - Library of Congress, 1901-1902 crop.JPG|thumb|left|267px|alt=A diagram depicting the phases of the Flatiron Building's construction|Construction phases]]\n\n===Construction===\n\nOnce construction of the building began, it proceeded at a very fast pace. The steel was so meticulously pre-cut that the frame went up at the rate of a floor each week. By February 1902 the frame was complete, and by mid-May the building was half-covered by terra-cotta tiling. The building was completed in June 1902, after a year of construction.<ref name=treasure /> \n\nThe Flatiron Building was not the first building of its triangular ground-plan: aside from a possibly unique triangular Roman temple built on a similarly constricted site in the city of [[Verulamium|Verulamium, Britannia]],<ref>Noted, \"Roman city in Britain had Flatiron Building\", ''[[Science News|The Science News-Letter]]'' '''24''' No. 657 (November 11, 1933:311).</ref> the [[Historic Inns of Annapolis#The Maryland Inn|Maryland Inn]] in [[Annapolis]] (1782), the [[Hanover Square, Syracuse|Granger Block]] in [[Syracuse, New York]] (1869), the [[Phelan Building]] in [[San Francisco]] (1881), the [[Gooderham Building]] of [[Toronto]] (1892), and the [[English-American Building]] in [[Atlanta]] (1897) predate it. All, however, are smaller than their New York counterpart.\n\nTwo features were added to the Flatiron Building following its completion. The \"cowcatcher\" retail space at the front of the building was added in order to maximize the use of the building's lot and produce some retail income. Harry Black had insisted on the space, despite objections from Burnham.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=101-03}} Another addition to the building not in the original plan was the penthouse, which was constructed after the rest of the building had been completed to be used as artists' studios, and was quickly rented out to artists such as [[Louis Fancher]], many of whom contributed to the [[pulp magazine]]s which were produced in the offices below.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=201-02}}\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n[[File:Albert Gleizes Sur le Flat-iron 1916.jpg|thumb|225px|alt=Sur le Flatiron, Albert Gleizes, gouache and ink (1916)|''Sur le Flatiron'', [[Albert Gleizes]], gouache and ink (1916)|left]]\n\n===Initial response===\nThe Flatiron Building became an icon of New York City, and the public response to it was enthusiastic,<ref name=treasure /><ref>[[Witold Rybczynski|Rybczynski, Witold]]. ''City Life: Urban Expectations in a New World'' New York: Scribner, 1995. p. 153. {{ISBN|0-684-81302-5}}. Quote: \"The public loved the Flatiron, and businessmen and their architects took notice.\"</ref> but the critical response to it at the time was not completely positive, and what praise it garnered was often for the cleverness of the engineering involved. [[Montgomery Schuyler]], editor of ''[[Architectural Record]]'', said that its \"awkwardness [is] entirely undisguised, and without even an attempt to disguise them, if they have not even been aggravated by the treatment. ... The treatment of the tip is an additional and it seems wanton aggravation of the inherent awkwardness of the situation.\"<ref>''[[Architectural Record]]'' (October 1902), quoted in Alexiou, pp. 125\u201326</ref> He praised the surface of the building, and the detailing of the terra-cotta work, but criticized the practicality of the large number of windows in the building: \"[The tenant] can, perhaps, find wall space within for one roll top desk without overlapping the windows, with light close in front of him and close behind him and close on one side of him. But suppose he needed a bookcase? Undoubtedly he has a highly eligible place from which to view processions. But for the transaction of business?\"{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=138}}\n\nWhen the building was first constructed, it received mixed feedback. The most known criticism received was known as \"Burnham's Folly\". This criticism, focused on the structure of the building, was made on the grounds that the \"combination of triangular shape and height would cause the building to fall down.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/flatiron-building|title=Flatiron Building - Facts & Summary|last=|first=|date=2010|website=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|history.com]]|publisher=[[A&E Networks]]|access-date=July 29, 2017}}</ref> Critics believed that the building created a dangerous wind-tunnel at the intersection of the two streets, and could possibly knock the building down.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKoyDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA82|title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide USA|last=DK|date=May 16, 2017|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781465466365|language=en}}</ref> Although the wind is strong at the intersection, the building's structure was meant to accommodate four times the typical wind loads in order to stabilize and retain the building's iconic triangular shape.\n\nThe ''[[New York Tribune]]'' called the new building \"A stingy piece of pie ... the greatest inanimate troublemaker in New York\", while the [[Municipal Art Society]] said that it was \"Unfit to be in the Center of the City\". ''The New York Times'' called it a \"monstrosity\".<ref name=\"treasure\" /> But some saw the building differently. Futurist [[H. G. Wells]] wrote in his 1906 book ''The Future in America: A Search After Realities'':\n\n<blockquote>I found myself agape, admiring a sky-scraper the prow of the Flat-iron Building, to be particular, ploughing up through the traffic of Broadway and Fifth Avenue in the afternoon light.<ref>[[H.

London:Harpers,1906.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Flatiron was to attract the attention of numerous artists. It was the subject of one of [[Edward Steichen]]'s atmospheric photographs, taken on a wet wintry late afternoon in 1904, as well as a memorable image by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] taken the year before, to which Steichen was paying homage. ''(See [[#iconic images|below]])''{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=153-57}} Stieglitz reflected on the dynamic symbolism of the building, noting upon seeing it one day during a snowstorm that \"... it appeared to be moving toward me like the bow of a monster ocean steamer \u2013 a picture of a new America still in the making,\"<ref name=treasure /><ref>[http://magicalhystorytour.blogspot.com/2010/08/skyscrapers.html \"Skyscrapers\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629192827/http://magicalhystorytour.blogspot.com/2010/08/skyscrapers.html |date=June 29, 2015 }} ''Magical Hystory Tour:The Origins of the Commonplace & Curious in America'' (September 1, 2010)</ref><ref>Burns, Ric & Sanders, James ''New York: An Illustrated History'', 233(1999)</ref> and remarked that what the [[Parthenon]] was to Athens, the Flatiron was to New York.<ref name=wsjrev /> When Stieglitz' photograph was published in ''Camera Work'', his friend [[Sadakichi Hartmann]], a writer, painter and photographer, accompanied it with an essay on the building: \"A curious creation, no doubt, but can it be called beautiful? Beauty is a very abstract idea ... Why should the time not arrive when the majority without hesitation will pronounce the 'Flat-iron' a thing of beauty?\"{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=156}}\n\nBesides Stieglitz and Steichen, photographers such as [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]], [[Jessie Tarbox Beals]], painters of the [[Ashcan School]] like [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], [[Everett Shinn]] and [[Ernest Lawson]], as well as [[Paul Cornoyer]] and [[Childe Hassam]], [[lithography|lithographer]] [[Joseph Pennell]], illustrator [[John Edward Jackson (illustrator)|John Edward Jackson]] as well the French [[Cubism|Cubist]] [[Albert Gleizes]] all took the Flatiron as the subject of their work.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=158-59, 236}} But decades after it was completed, others still could not come to terms with the building. Sculptor [[William Ordway Partridge]] remarked that it was \"a disgrace to our city, an outrage to our sense of the artistic, and a menace to life\".<ref>In ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (August 12, 1939), quoted in Alexiou, p. 126</ref>\n\n[[File:Flatiron Building and Street Scene October 8th 1902 New York City.ogv|thumb|250px|alt=A 1892 movie showing street life and the Flatiron Building|Movie showing street life and the Flatiron Building, 1902]]\n[[File:Colonel Donovan and staff of 165th Infantry, passing under the Victory Arch, New York City., 1919 - NARA - 533479.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=A 1919 image of the 165th Infantry Regiment passing through Madison Square's Victory Arch.

In 1910, Harry Black moved the company to [[Francis H. Kimball|Francis Kimball]]'s [[Trinity Building]] at 111 Broadway, where its parent company, U.S. Realty, had its offices. U.S. Realty moved its offices back to the Flatiron in 1916, and left permanently for the [[Fuller Building]] on 57th Street in 1929.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=214, 244, 252}}\n\nThe Flatiron's other original tenants included publishers (magazine publishing pioneer [[Frank Munsey]], ''American Architect and Building News'' and a vanity publisher), an insurance company (the [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable Life Assurance Society]]), small businesses (a patent medicine company, Western Specialty Manufacturing Company and Whitehead & Hoag, who made celluloid novelties), music publishers (overflow from \"[[Tin Pan Alley]]\" up on [[28th Street (Manhattan)|28th Street]]), a landscape architect, the [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] Consulate, the Bohemian Guides Society, the Roebling Construction Company, owned by the sons of [[Tammany Hall]] boss [[Richard Croker]], and the crime syndicate, [[Murder, Inc.]]<ref name=treasure />\n\nThe retail space in the [[Flatiron Building#Cowcatcher space|building's \"cowcatcher\"]] at the \"prow\" was leased by [[United Cigar Stores]], and the building's vast cellar, which extended into the vaults that went more than {{convert|20|ft|m}} under the surrounding streets,{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=89}} was occupied by the Flatiron Restaurant, which could seat 1,500 patrons and was open from breakfast through late supper for those taking in a performance at one of the many [[Rialto, Manhattan|theatres which lined Broadway between 14th and 23rd Streets]].{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=133-41}}\n\nIn 1911, the building introduced a restaurant/club in the basement. It was among the first of its kind that allowed a black Jazz band to perform, thus introducing [[ragtime]] to affluent New Yorkers.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010}}\n\nEven before construction on the Flatiron Building had begun, the area around [[Madison Square]] had started to deteriorate somewhat. After U.S. Realty constructed the [[New York Hippodrome]], [[Madison Square Garden II|Madison Square Garden]] was no longer the venue of choice, and survived largely by staging [[boxing]] matches. The base of the Flatiron became a cruising spot for gay men, including some male [[prostitutes]].{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=233}} Nonetheless, in 1911 the Flatiron Restaurant was bought by Louis Bustanoby, of the well-known Caf\u00e9 des Beaux-Arts, and converted into a trendy 400-seat French restaurant, Taverne Louis. As an innovation to attract customers away from another restaurant opened by his brothers, Bustanoby hired a black musical group, [[Louis Mitchell]] and his Southern Symphony Quintette, to play dance tunes at the Taverne and the Caf\u00e9. [[Irving Berlin]] heard the group at the Taverne and suggested that they should try to get work in London, which they did.{{efn-ua|Mitchell would later become a headliner and nightclub owner [[Paris]], becoming a millionaire before losing it all. He returned to the U.S., where he drove a beer truck in [[Washington, D.C.]] {{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=232\u2013234, 261\u2013264}}}} The Taverne's openness was also indicated by its welcoming a gay clientele, unusual for a restaurant of its type at the time.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=220-27}} The Taverne was forced to close due to the effects of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] on the restaurant business.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=245}}\n\n===Sales and new tenants===\nIn October 1925, Harry S. Black, in need of cash for his [[U.S. Realty Company]], sold the Flatiron Building to a syndicate set up by [[Lewis Rosenbaum]], who also owned assorted other notable buildings around the U.S. The price was $2 million, which equaled Black's cost for buying the lot and erecting the Flatiron.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=244-45}} The syndicate defaulted on its mortgage in 1933, and was taken over by the lender, [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable Life Assurance Company]] after failing to sell it at auction. To attract tenants, Equitable did some modernization of the building, including replacing the original cast-iron birdcage elevators, which had cabs covered in rubber tiling and were originally built by [[Hecla Iron Works]], but the hydraulic power system was not replaced. By the mid-1940s, the building was fully rented.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=264-64}}\n\nWhen the U.S. entered [[World War I]], the Federal government instituted a \"Wake Up America!\" campaign, and the United Cigar store in the Flatiron's cowcatcher donated its space to the [[U.S. Navy]] for use as a recruiting center. [[Liberty Bonds]] were sold outside on sidewalk stands.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=232}} By the mid-1940s, the cigar store had been replaced with a [[Walgreens]] drug store.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=264-65}} During the 1940s, the building was dominated by clothing and toy companies.<ref name=treasure />\n\nEquitable sold the building in 1946 to the Flatiron Associates, an investor group headed by [[Harry Helmsley]], whose firm, Dwight-Helmsley (which would later become [[Helmsley-Spear]]) managed the property.

Though Burnham maintained overall control of the design process, he was not directly connected with the details of the structure as built. That task was performed by his designer [[Frederick P. Dinkelberg]], a Pennsylvania-born architect in Burnham's office, who first worked for Burnham in putting together the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, for which Burnham was the chief of construction and master designer.<ref group=\"upper-alpha\">Other buildings by Dinkelberg at D. H. Burnham & Co. include the [[Santa Fe Building (Chicago)|Santa Fe Building]] and the [[Heyworth Building]], both in Chicago.</ref> Working drawings for the Flatiron Building, however, remain to be located, though renderings were published at the time of construction in ''[[American Architect]]'' and ''[[Architectural Record]]''.<ref>Zukowsky and Saliga 1984:73; a perspective drawing by [[Jules Gu\u00e9rin]] (not a member of Burnham's office) for ''Century Magazine'' (''[[The New York Times]]'', August 1902), now at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], occasioned the article in ''Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies''.</ref>\n\n===Steel skeleton===\nBuilding the Flatiron was made feasible by a change to New York City's building codes in 1892, which eliminated the requirement that masonry be used for fireproofing considerations. This opened the way for steel-skeleton construction.<ref name=treasure /> Since it employed a steel skeleton{{efn-ua|According to the ''[[AIA Guide to New York City]]'' (5th edition), the belief that the Flatiron Building was one of the first building or skyscraper in New York with a steel skeleton is untrue. \"[D]ozens of New York commercial buildings had been steel-framed in the 1890s, including the tallest at the time, the 391-foot [[Park Row Building]].\"<ref name=aia />}} \u2013 with the steel coming from the [[American Bridge Company]] in [[Pennsylvania]]{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|p=94}} \u2013 it could be built to 22 stories (285&nbsp;feet) relatively easily, which would have been difficult using other construction methods of that time.<ref>Terranova, Antonino.

White Star Publishers, 2003 {{ISBN|88-8095-230-7}}</ref> It was a technique familiar to the Fuller Company, a contracting firm with considerable expertise in building such tall structures. At the vertex, the triangular tower is only 6.5 feet (2&nbsp;m) wide; viewed from above, this pointed end of the structure describes an acute angle of about 25 degrees.<ref>[http://dome.mit.edu/handle/1721.3/82968 \"Flatiron Building\"] ''Dome'' the website of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT Libraries]], citing [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/ Grove Art Online]</ref>\n\n[[Purdy and Henderson, Engineers|Purdy and Henderson]] were the structural engineers. They strengthened the structure to deal with the wind load, as the building was quite narrow and therefore had less volume to resist it. They designed it so that, in theory, the building would turn compactly before any failure could occur in the metal structure. For the first time the construction of a skyscraper steel structure could be witnessed in full by the public, an event that received a great response and was immortalized by photographers Edward Steichen and Alfred Stieglitz.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.wikiarquitectura.com/building/flatiron-building/|title=Flatiron Building |access-date=October 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Design features===\n{{Anchor|Cowcatcher space}}The \"cowcatcher\" retail space at the front of the building was not part of Burnham or Dinkelberg's design, but was added at the insistence of Harry Black in order to maximize the use of the building's lot and produce some retail income to help defray the cost of construction. Black pushed Burnham hard for plans for the addition, but Burnham resisted because of the aesthetic effect it would have on the design of the \"prow\" of the building, where it would interrupt the two-story high Classical columns which were echoed at the top of the building by two columns which supported the cornice. Black insisted, and Burnham was forced to accept the addition, despite the interruption of the design's symmetry.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=101-03}} \n\nThe building was considered to be \"quirky\" overall, with drafty wood-framed and cooper-clad windows, no central air conditioning, a heating system which utilized cast-iron radiators, an antiquated sprinkler system, and a single staircase should evacuation of the building be necessary.  The triangular shape of the structure led to a \"rabbit warren\" of oddly-shaped rooms.<ref name=era /> Other oddities about the building's interior include that bathrooms for males and females are placed on alternating floors, with the men's rooms on even floors and the women's rooms on odd ones. Additionally, to reach the top floor &ndash; the 21st, which was added in 1905, three years after the building was completed &ndash; a second elevator has to be taken from the 20th floor. On the 21st floor, the bottoms of the windows are chest-high.<ref name=\"sqft\">Stapinski, Helen.

Nevertheless, the wind was a factor in the public attention the building received.\n\nDue to the geography of the site, with Broadway on one side, Fifth Avenue on the other, and the open expanse of [[Madison Square]] and the park in front of it, the wind currents around the building could be treacherous. Wind from the north would split around the building, downdrafts from above and updrafts from the vaulted area under the street would combine to make the wind unpredictable.{{sfn|Alexiou|2010|pp=149-50}} This is said to have given rise to the phrase \"[[23 skidoo (phrase)|23 skidoo]]\", from what policemen would shout at men who tried to get glimpses of women's dresses being blown up by the winds swirling around the building due to the strong downdrafts.{{efn-ua|Goldberger 1981:38 note 3: Andrew S.

This entered into popular culture and there are hundreds of postcards and illustrations of women with their dresses blowing up in front of the Flatiron Building.
