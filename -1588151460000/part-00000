''S.&nbsp;chamaejasme'' is a herbaceous [[perennial]] plant with heads of white, pink or yellow flowers, grown as an ornamental plant in [[rock garden]]s and [[alpine house]]s, but considered a [[weed]] playing a r\u00f4le in the [[desertification]] of grasslands in parts of its native range. Like many others of its family, it is a [[poisonous plant]] with medicinal and other useful properties.\n\n==Scientific Name==\n\n[[File:Pink jasmine bush.jpg|thumb|''[[Jasminum polyanthum]]'' in bloom, showing wine-red exteriors of corollas reminiscent of those of ''Stellera'' (re. species name ''chamaejasme'' i.e. \"ground jasmine\").]]\nThe [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic genus]] ''Stellera'' (not to be confused with the entirely unrelated ''[[Stellaria]]'') commemorates [[Georg Wilhelm Steller]] (St\u00f6ller), while the specific epithet ''chamaejasme'' is a rendering into botanical Latin orthography of the Greek \u03c7\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1\u03af ''khamai'' \"(down) on the ground\" and \u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03b5 ''iasme'' \"[[jasmine]]\". The name in its entirety thus means \"Steller's plant that resembles a kind of jasmine (that creeps) on the ground\". The name of the species is doubly apt, as not only is the flower of ''Stellera chamaejasme'' fragrant like that of jasmine, but it also has a wine-red exterior, like that of certain species of jasmine e.g. Common jasmine ''[[Jasminum officinale]]'' and the Chinese species ''[[Jasminum polyanthum]]''. Unlike jasmine, however, ''Stellera'' is a herbaceous plant, not a woody one, and its stems do not twine.\n\n==Description==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is a [[herbaceous perennial]]. Unbranched stems, 20\u201330&nbsp;cm tall, emerge in a cluster from an underground [[rhizome]]. Narrow, overlapping leaves are borne along the stems. Individual leaves are narrow and pointed, up to 2&nbsp;cm long. The flowers are grouped into rounded tightly packed terminal heads. Flowers lack [[petal]]s, instead having petaloid [[sepal]]s forming a tube up to 1.5&nbsp;cm long with usually five (but possibly four or six) short lobes at the end. The flower colour varies from shades of pink and white to yellow. There are twice as many stamens as calyx lobes, in two series. The ovary has a single chamber ([[locule]]). The fruit is a dry [[drupe]], enclosed by the remains of the calyx.<ref name=Beck94/><ref name=FoC_S/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe genus ''Stellera'' was first described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1753.<ref name=IPNI_39323-1/>  He recognized two species: ''Stellera passerina'', now placed in the genus ''[[Thymelaea]]'' as ''[[Thymelaea passerina|T.&nbsp;passerina]]'', and ''Stellera chamaejasme''.<ref name=Linn53/> Many species names were later created in the genus, but all are now usually considered synonyms of other species, including ''S.&nbsp;chamaejasme'',<ref name=TPL_Stellera/> although the ''Flora of China'' states that there are 10 to 12 species.<ref name=FoC_S/>\n\nStudies in 2002 and 2009, based on [[chloroplast DNA]], placed ''Stellera'' in a small group of related genera, either as sister to ''[[Wikstroemia]]'' or embedded within it; however for most genera only one species was included.<ref name=BankFayChas02/><ref name=BeauEdwaMannMaur09/>\n\n{{clade|style=line-height:100%\n|1={{clade\n   |1=''[[Edgeworthia]]''\n   |2={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n         |1=''[[Wikstroemia]]''\n         |2=''Stellera''\n         }}\n      |2={{clade\n         |1=''[[Diarthron]]''\n         |2={{clade\n            |1=''[[Thymelaea]]''\n            |2=''[[Daphne (plant)|Daphne]]''\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is native to northern and western China, Tibet, the Himalayas (Nepal, Bhutan), the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in north India, Russia and Mongolia.<ref name=Beck94/><ref name=FoC_Sc/> In China, it is found on sunny dry slopes and sandy places between 2600 and 4200&nbsp;m.<ref name=FoC_Sc/>\n\n==Cultivation==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is cultivated as an ornamental plant in [[rock garden]]s and [[alpine house]]s. It is considered difficult to grow, needing a sunny position and gritty soil if grown outside, or a large pot if grown under cover. It is propagated by seed.<ref name=Beck94/>\n\n==Toxicity==\n[[File:Chamaejasme.jpg|thumb|Compared and contrasted: roots of (fancied) human-like form of A: ''Stellera chamaejasme'' and B: ''[[Mandragora officinarum]]'', the fabled ''[[Mandrake]]''.

The oldest rootstocks of this plant can reach the size of a large carrot, and [if taken as medicine] produce the most violent effects. Such old roots can produce more than fifty - and sometimes as many as a hundred - flowering shoots, which, crowned with their beautiful and fragrant flowers, give not the least hint of the violent and pernicious effects residing in the root that bore them. The exterior of the flower is usually of a dark reddish-purple, or, more rarely [[sulphur]]-yellow colour; while the interior is white. Add to this the fact that the flowers display, upon opening, a white border and in the middle a red or yellow patch, and the flowers present the most [[Beauty|ravishing]] aspect. The young [[Evenks|Tungus]] boys are in the habit of adorning their bare heads with a kind of hat which they create most artistically by interweaving whole flowering stems of the plant. On this plant one often finds a flower in which two normal flowers seem fused into one, bearing a corolla with nine lobes and eighteen stamens arranged in two rows.

Among the various active compounds, the diterpenoids are widely recognized as the class responsible for the anti-tumor effect. The dried roots of ''S. chamaejasme'' are known as ''Rui-Xiang-Lang-Du'' in [[Traditional Chinese medicine]] in which system this toxic herb is widely used for the treatment of various disorders, being described as \"Effective against dispelling phlegm by water and displaying toxicity against insect pests\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Xiao-Qin |last2=Rahman |first2=Khalid |last3=Zhu |first3=Jian-Yong |last4=Zhang |first4=Hong |title=Chemical Constituents and Pharmacological Activities of Stellera chamaejasme |journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design |date=8 November 2018 |volume=24 |issue=24 |pages=2825\u20132838 |doi=10.2174/1381612824666180903110802 |pmid=30179119 |url=http://researchonline.ljmu.ac.uk/id/eprint/11490/6/Chemical%20structures.pdf }}</ref>\n\nA scientific paper of 2015 refers to this plant - regarded as a choice and hard-to-grow ornamental by European and American gardeners - as being one of the most toxic of grassland [[weed]]s in the range where it is native and notes that cattle which consume its shoots and flowers may be fatally poisoned. The paper notes further that populations of the plant are in no way endangered, having been flourishing and increasing for some years: this appears to be due not simply to the plant's competing vigorously with other species for water and nutrients, but also to its containing / secreting [[herbicide|herbicidal]] compounds.Water and [[ethanol]] extracts of S. chamaejasme inhibited seed germination and/or seedling growth in no fewer than 13 plant species, and the phytotoxic effects were stronger upon [[dicotyledon]]ous plants than upon [[monocotyledon]]ous plants. The phytotoxic compounds were observed to be liberated particularly by dead or moribund specimens of ''S. chamaejasme'' and to lead to reduced seedling growth in the [[grass]]es ''[[Lolium perenne]]'' <small>L.</small>, ''[[Psathyrostachys juncea]]'' <small>(Fisch.)

Furthermore, pesticidal properties were confirmed to be present in ''S. chameajasme'': the ethanolic extract of S. chameajasme strongly inhabited the growth of the following insect pests: the butterfly ''[[Pieris rapae]]'', the aphid ''[[Myzus persicae]]'' and the corn-borer moth ''[[Ostrinia furnacalis]]'', and showed contact and oral toxicities against two other stem-borer moths which are pests of [[rice]]: ''[[Sesamia inferens]]'' and ''[[Chilo suppressalis]]''. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yan |first1=Zhiqiang |last2=Zeng |first2=Liming |last3=Jin |first3=Hui |last4=Qin |first4=Bo |title=Potential ecological roles of flavonoids from Stellera chamaejasme |journal=Plant Signaling & Behavior |date=7 April 2015 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=e1001225 |doi=10.1080/15592324.2014.1001225 |pmid=25848835 |pmc=4622577 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=BankFayChas02>{{Citation |last1=van der Bank |first1=Michelle |last2=Fay |first2=Michael F. |last3=Chase |first3=Mark W. |date=2002 |title=Molecular Phylogenetics of Thymelaeaceae with particular reference to African and Australian genera |journal=Taxon |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=329\u2013339 |jstor=1554930 |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.2307/1554901 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=BeauEdwaMannMaur09>{{Citation |last1=Beaumont |first1=Angela J. |last2=Edwards |first2=Trevor J. |last3=Manning |first3=John |last4=Maurin |first4=Olivier |last5=Rautenbach |first5=Marline |last6=Motsi |first6=Moleboheng C. |last7=Fay |first7=Michael F. |last8=Chase |first8=Mark W. |last9=Van Der Bank |first9=Michelle |date=2009 |title=Gnidia (Thymelaeaceae) is not monophyletic: taxonomic implications for Thymelaeoideae and a partial new generic taxonomy for ''Gnidia'' |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=160 |issue=4 |pages=402\u2013417 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.00988.x |lastauthoramp=yes |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Beck94>{{Citation |year=1994 |editor-last=Beckett |editor-first=K. |title=Encyclopaedia of Alpines : Volume 2 (L\u2013Z) \n|contribution=Stellera |page=1285 |location=Pershore, UK |publisher=AGS Publications |isbn=978-0-900048-62-3 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=FoC_S>{{citation |first1=Yinzheng |last1=Wang |first2=Michael G. |last2=Gilbert |contribution=Stellaria |contribution-url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=131303 |accessdate=2017-11-26 |editor-last=Wu |editor-first=Zhengyi |editor2-last=Raven |editor2-first=Peter H. |editor3-last=Hong |editor3-first=Deyuan <!--|date=1994 onwards--> |title=Flora of China ''(online)'' |publisher=eFloras.org |url=http://www.efloras.org/flora_page.aspx?flora_id=2 |lastauthoramp=yes }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=FoC_Sc>{{citation |first1=Yinzheng |last1=Wang |first2=Michael G. |last2=Gilbert |contribution=Stellaria chamaejasme |contribution-url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=200014523 |accessdate=2017-11-26 |editor-last=Wu |editor-first=Zhengyi |editor2-last=Raven |editor2-first=Peter H. |editor3-last=Hong |editor3-first=Deyuan <!--|date=1994 onwards--> |title=Flora of China ''(online)'' |publisher=eFloras.org |url=http://www.efloras.org/flora_page.aspx?flora_id=2 |lastauthoramp=yes }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=IPNI_39323-1>{{citation |title=Plant Name Details for ''Stellera''&#32;L. |work=[[International Plant Names Index|The International Plant Names Index]] |url=http://www.ipni.org/ipni/idPlantNameSearch.do?id=39323-1 |accessdate=2017-11-26 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Linn53>{{Citation |last1=Linnaeus |first1=Carl |date=1753 |contribution=Stellera |title=Species Plantarum |volume=1 |page=559 |location=Stockholm, Sweden |publisher=Laurentius Salvius |language=Latin |contribution-url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/358577 |accessdate=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=TPL_Stellera>{{citation |title=Search results for ''Stellera''|work=The Plant List |url=http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=Stellera |accessdate=2017-11-26 }}</ref>\n}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q3487244}}\n\n[[Category:Thymelaeoideae]]\n[[Category:Monotypic Malvales genera]]\n[[Category:Poisonous plants]]\n[[Category:Flora of temperate Asia]]\n[[Category:Medicinal plants of Asia]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of Asia]]\n[[Category:Flora of Central Asia]]\n[[Category:Flora of Russia]]\n[[Category:Flora of Siberia]]\n[[Category:Flora of China]]\n\n\n{{Thymelaeaceae-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Speciesbox\n|image = Stellera chamaejasme 2.jpg\n|display_parents = 2\n|genus = Stellera\n|parent_authority = L.<ref name=IPNI_39323-1/> \n|species = chamaejasme\n|authority = L.<ref name=TPL_Stellera/>\n}}\n\n'''''Stellera''''' is a [[genus]] of [[flowering plant]] in the family [[Thymelaeaceae]], with a single species '''''Stellera chamaejasme''''',<ref name=TPL_Stellera/> found in mountainous regions of [[Central Asia]], [[China]], [[Siberia]] and [[South Asia]].

The paper notes further that populations of the plant are in no way endangered, having been flourishing and increasing for some years: this appears to be due not simply to the plant's competing vigorously with other species for water and nutrients, but also to its containing / secreting [[herbicide|herbicidal]] compounds.Water and [[ethanol]] extracts of S. chamaejasme inhibited seed germination and/or seedling growth in no fewer than 13 plant species, and the phytotoxic effects were stronger upon [[dicotyledon]]ous plants than upon [[monocotyledon]]ous plants. The phytotoxic compounds were observed to be liberated particularly by dead or moribund specimens of ''S. chamaejasme'' and to lead to reduced seedling growth in the [[grass]]es ''[[Lolium perenne]]'' <small>L.</small>, ''[[Psathyrostachys juncea]]'' <small>(Fisch.) Nevski</small> and ''[[Bromus inermis]]'' <small>Leyss.</small> and the [[legume]]s ''[[Melilotus suaveolens]]'' <small>Ledeb.</small> (see ''[[Melilotus]]''), ''[[Onobrychis viciifolia]]'' <small>Scop.</small> (sainfoin) and ''[[Medicago sativa]]'' <small>L.</small> (alfalfa). Furthermore, pesticidal properties were confirmed to be present in ''S. chameajasme'': the ethanolic extract of S. chameajasme strongly inhabited the growth of the following insect pests: the butterfly ''[[Pieris rapae]]'', the aphid ''[[Myzus persicae]]'' and the corn-borer moth ''[[Ostrinia furnacalis]]'', and showed contact and oral toxicities against two other stem-borer moths which are pests of [[rice]]: ''[[Sesamia inferens]]'' and ''[[Chilo suppressalis]]''. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yan |first1=Zhiqiang |last2=Zeng |first2=Liming |last3=Jin |first3=Hui |last4=Qin |first4=Bo |title=Potential ecological roles of flavonoids from Stellera chamaejasme |journal=Plant Signaling & Behavior |date=7 April 2015 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=e1001225 |doi=10.1080/15592324.2014.1001225 |pmid=25848835 |pmc=4622577 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=BankFayChas02>{{Citation |last1=van der Bank |first1=Michelle |last2=Fay |first2=Michael F. |last3=Chase |first3=Mark W. |date=2002 |title=Molecular Phylogenetics of Thymelaeaceae with particular reference to African and Australian genera |journal=Taxon |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=329\u2013339 |jstor=1554930 |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.2307/1554901 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=BeauEdwaMannMaur09>{{Citation |last1=Beaumont |first1=Angela J. |last2=Edwards |first2=Trevor J. |last3=Manning |first3=John |last4=Maurin |first4=Olivier |last5=Rautenbach |first5=Marline |last6=Motsi |first6=Moleboheng C. |last7=Fay |first7=Michael F. |last8=Chase |first8=Mark W. |last9=Van Der Bank |first9=Michelle |date=2009 |title=Gnidia (Thymelaeaceae) is not monophyletic: taxonomic implications for Thymelaeoideae and a partial new generic taxonomy for ''Gnidia'' |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=160 |issue=4 |pages=402\u2013417 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.00988.x |lastauthoramp=yes |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Beck94>{{Citation |year=1994 |editor-last=Beckett |editor-first=K. |title=Encyclopaedia of Alpines : Volume 2 (L\u2013Z) \n|contribution=Stellera |page=1285 |location=Pershore, UK |publisher=AGS Publications |isbn=978-0-900048-62-3 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=FoC_S>{{citation |first1=Yinzheng |last1=Wang |first2=Michael G. |last2=Gilbert |contribution=Stellaria |contribution-url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=131303 |accessdate=2017-11-26 |editor-last=Wu |editor-first=Zhengyi |editor2-last=Raven |editor2-first=Peter H. |editor3-last=Hong |editor3-first=Deyuan <!--|date=1994 onwards--> |title=Flora of China ''(online)'' |publisher=eFloras.org |url=http://www.efloras.org/flora_page.aspx?flora_id=2 |lastauthoramp=yes }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=FoC_Sc>{{citation |first1=Yinzheng |last1=Wang |first2=Michael G. |last2=Gilbert |contribution=Stellaria chamaejasme |contribution-url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=200014523 |accessdate=2017-11-26 |editor-last=Wu |editor-first=Zhengyi |editor2-last=Raven |editor2-first=Peter H. |editor3-last=Hong |editor3-first=Deyuan <!--|date=1994 onwards--> |title=Flora of China ''(online)'' |publisher=eFloras.org |url=http://www.efloras.org/flora_page.aspx?flora_id=2 |lastauthoramp=yes }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=IPNI_39323-1>{{citation |title=Plant Name Details for ''Stellera''&#32;L. |work=[[International Plant Names Index|The International Plant Names Index]] |url=http://www.ipni.org/ipni/idPlantNameSearch.do?id=39323-1 |accessdate=2017-11-26 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Linn53>{{Citation |last1=Linnaeus |first1=Carl |date=1753 |contribution=Stellera |title=Species Plantarum |volume=1 |page=559 |location=Stockholm, Sweden |publisher=Laurentius Salvius |language=Latin |contribution-url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/358577 |accessdate=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=TPL_Stellera>{{citation |title=Search results for ''Stellera''|work=The Plant List |url=http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=Stellera |accessdate=2017-11-26 }}</ref>\n}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q3487244}}\n\n[[Category:Thymelaeoideae]]\n[[Category:Monotypic Malvales genera]]\n[[Category:Poisonous plants]]\n[[Category:Flora of temperate Asia]]\n[[Category:Medicinal plants of Asia]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of Asia]]\n[[Category:Flora of Central Asia]]\n[[Category:Flora of Russia]]\n[[Category:Flora of Siberia]\n[[Category:Flora of China]]\n\n\n{{Thymelaeaceae-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Flobbadob", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellera"}

Like most organizations at the time, it was a segregated institution. It wasn't until 1962 that [[Desegregation in the United States|desegregation]] took full effect; black and white students could share full schedules together. In 1963, the ballsack first new building was constructed, and Peter Masiko would become president for the next 18 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linccweb.org/webscripts/lwauth.aspx?calling_system=ezproxy&institute=flcc1600&url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/document-view?p=AWNB&t=&sort=YMD_date:A&fld-base-0=alltext&maxresults=20&val-base-0=%20%22Dade%20County%20Junior%20College%22&docref=news/0EB360A06EE6EE4D|title=LINCCWeb Catalog Search|website=www.linccweb.org|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> As the years progressed, more campuses began opening across the county: the Kendall Campus and Wolfson Campus.\n\nInitially, the college had an open admissions policy, meaning anyone who could afford to pay was allowed to study at the campus. Due to this, the college aimed to improve its academic stance among alumni. To encourage this movement, a Medical Center was built for students in [[Allied health professions|Allied Health]] and Nursing ([[Registered nurse|RN]]) programs. As the number of Cuban exiles and refugees began to rise in 1980, and [[Outreach|outreach center]] was built in the city of [[Hialeah]]. This allowed refugees and immigrants educational opportunities that they wouldn't be able to achieve otherwise. Another outreach center, the InterAmerican center, was built to accommodate [[bilingual education]]. The Homestead Campus was built in 1990 in [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]] to relieve the concerns of students having to drive to the Kendall Campus In Miami. In the mid-1990s, the college began to rely heavily on the Miami Dade College Foundation as the [[Florida Legislature|Florida legislature]] reduced the state's education budget. The college also had to figure out new ways of recruiting students and it began its \"Successful Alumni\" campaign in the late 1990s, marketing the success of the college's alumni to local prospective students.\n\nBeginning in 2001, the college implemented a strategic plan to revamp the college and its recruiting goals. In 2002, the college disbanded its [[Honors colleges and programs|Honors Program]] and created The Honors College for talented high school graduates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mdc.edu/about/history.aspx|title=History of MDC {{!}} Miami Dade College|website=www.mdc.edu|access-date=2020-02-05}}</ref> The [[Honors colleges and programs|Honors College]] is a representation of Miami Dade College's most [[Academically gifted|academically-gifted]] students in different fields and was originally based on the three larger campuses (Wolfson, Kendall, and North).In 2006, Miami Dade College surpassed 1.5 million students enrolled throughout its history. In 2007, The Honors College expanded into the InterAmerican Campus with The Honors College Dual Language Honors Program to tailor to the needs of the growing Spanish-speaking population in the [[United States]] as well as abroad. The Dual Language Honors Program opened its doors to bilingual students who wish to continue their careers with professional fluency in the English and Spanish languages. In 2009, The MDC Honors College Dual Language Program earned the merit of Innovation of the Year in the Learning and Teaching Department from the League for Innovation. In 2018, Miami Dade was awarded and recognized for its path to economic and social mobility by the Aspen Institute. The award received was the $1 million Aspen Prize.\n\nOn February 1, 2019, [[Eduardo J.

Like most organizations at the time, it was a segregated institution. It wasn't until 1962 that [[Desegregation in the United States|desegregation]] took full effect; black and white students could share full schedules together. In 1963, the first new building was constructed, and Peter Masiko would become president for the next 18 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linccweb.org/webscripts/lwauth.aspx?calling_system=ezproxy&institute=flcc1600&url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/document-view?p=AWNB&t=&sort=YMD_date:A&fld-base-0=alltext&maxresults=20&val-base-0=%20%22Dade%20County%20Junior%20College%22&docref=news/0EB360A06EE6EE4D|title=LINCCWeb Catalog Search|website=www.linccweb.org|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> As the years progressed, more campuses began opening across the county: the Kendall Campus and Wolfson Campus.\n\nInitially, the college had an open admissions policy, meaning anyone who could afford to pay was allowed to study at the campus. Due to this, the college aimed to improve its academic stance among alumni. To encourage this movement, a Medical Center was built for students in [[Allied health professions|Allied Health]] and Nursing ([[Registered nurse|RN]]) programs. As the number of Cuban exiles and refugees began to rise in 1980, and [[Outreach|outreach center]] was built in the city of [[Hialeah]]. This allowed refugees and immigrants educational opportunities that they wouldn't be able to achieve otherwise. Another outreach center, the InterAmerican center, was built to accommodate [[bilingual education]]. The Homestead Campus was built in 1990 in [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]] to relieve the concerns of students having to drive to the Kendall Campus In Miami. In the mid-1990s, the college began to rely heavily on the Miami Dade College Foundation as the [[Florida Legislature|Florida legislature]] reduced the state's education budget. The college also had to figure out new ways of recruiting students and it began its \"Successful Alumni\" campaign in the late 1990s, marketing the success of the college's alumni to local prospective students.\n\nBeginning in 2001, the college implemented a strategic plan to revamp the college and its recruiting goals. In 2002, the college disbanded its [[Honors colleges and programs|Honors Program]] and created The Honors College for talented high school graduates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mdc.edu/about/history.aspx|title=History of MDC {{!}} Miami Dade College|website=www.mdc.edu|access-date=2020-02-05}}</ref> The [[Honors colleges and programs|Honors College]] is a representation of Miami Dade College's most [[Academically gifted|academically-gifted]] students in different fields and was originally based on the three larger campuses (Wolfson, Kendall, and North).In 2006, Miami Dade College surpassed 1.5 million students enrolled throughout its history. In 2007, The Honors College expanded into the InterAmerican Campus with The Honors College Dual Language Honors Program to tailor to the needs of the growing Spanish-speaking population in the [[United States]] as well as abroad. The Dual Language Honors Program opened its doors to bilingual students who wish to continue their careers with professional fluency in the English and Spanish languages. In 2009, The MDC Honors College Dual Language Program earned the merit of Innovation of the Year in the Learning and Teaching Department from the League for Innovation. In 2018, Miami Dade was awarded and recognized for its path to economic and social mobility by the Aspen Institute. The award received was the $1 million Aspen Prize.\n\nOn February 1, 2019, [[Eduardo J.

The mob refuses Lot's offer, and the angels strike them with blindness, and then warn Lot to leave the city before it is destroyed.\n\n{{bibleverse||Genesis|19:14|HE}} indicates that Lot has sons-in-law. The Hebrew text indicates that they are married to Lot's daughters, while [[NIV]] interprets the expression as \"pledged to marry\" his virgin daughters. [[Robert Alter]] suggests that verse {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|19:15|HE}} (\"your two daughters who remain with you\") indicates that Lot's two virgin daughters left with him, but that he had other, married daughters who stayed behind with the sons-in-law.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Alter|first1=Robert|author-link=Robert Alter|title=The Five Books of Moses: A Translation with Commentary|date=2008|page=93}}</ref>\n\n[[Lot's wife]] turns into a pillar of salt, but Lot and his daughters escape to [[Zoara|Zoar]], and end up living in a cave in the mountains. In Genesis {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|19:30-38|HE}} Lot's daughters got their father drunk, and over two consecutive nights had sex with him without his knowledge. They both got pregnant. The older daughter gave birth to [[Moab]], while the younger daughter gave birth to [[Ammon]].

The '''wolf''' (''Canis lupus''),<!-- This article uses \"wolf\" rather than \"grey wolf\" or \"gray wolf\" throughout; see the discussion at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Wolf/Archive_6#Requested_move_2_August_2018 --> also known as the '''gray wolf''' or '''grey wolf''', is a large [[Canis|canine]] native to [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]]. It is the largest [[Neontology|extant]] member of [[Canidae]], males averaging {{convert|40|kg|abbr=on}} and females {{convert|37|kg|abbr=on}}. On average, wolves measure {{convert|105|\u2013|160|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|80|\u2013|85|cm|in|abbr=on}} at shoulder height. The wolf is also distinguished from other ''[[Canis]]'' species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller ''Canis'' species, such as the [[coyote]] and the [[golden jackal]], to produce fertile [[Canid hybrid|hybrid]]s with them. The [[Agouti (coloration)|banded]] fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black. Up to 38 [[Subspecies of Canis lupus|subspecies of wolf]] have been recognized including the [[Dog|domestic dog]].\n\nOf all members of the [[genus]] ''Canis'', the wolf is most [[Generalist and specialist species|specialized]] for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more [[Sociality|social nature]], and its highly advanced [[Wolf communication|expressive behaviour]]. It travels in [[Nuclear family|nuclear families]] consisting of a [[mated pair]] accompanied by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition for food within the pack. Wolves are also [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality. The wolf is mainly a [[carnivore]] and feeds primarily on large wild [[hooved mammal]]s, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, [[carrion]], and garbage. Single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs. [[Pathogen]]s and parasites, notably [[rabies]], may infect wolves.\n\nThe global wolf population was estimated to be 300,000 in 2003 and is considered to be of [[Least-concern species|Least Concern]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). Wolves have a long history of interactions with humans, having been despised and hunted in most [[Pastoralism|pastoral]] communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] and [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. Although the fear of wolves exists in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. [[Wolf attack]]s on humans are rare because wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans because of their experiences with hunters, ranchers, and shepherds.\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{See also|Wolf (name)}}\nThe English \"wolf\" stems from the [[Old English]] {{wikt-lang|ang|wulf}}, which is itself thought to be derived from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|*wulfaz}}. The [[Proto-Indo-European root]] *''{{PIE|[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/w\u013a\u0325k\u02b7os|w\u013a\u0325k\u02b7os]]}}'' may also be the source of the [[Latin]] word for the animal ''lupus'' (*''{{PIE|l\u00fak\u02b7os}}'').<ref>{{OEtymD|wolf}}</ref><ref name=Lehrman/> The name \"gray wolf\" refers to the grayish colour of the species.<ref name=Goldman/>\n\nSince pre-Christian times, [[Germanic peoples]] such as the [[Anglo-Saxon]]s took on ''wulf'' as a [[prefix]] or [[suffix]] in their names. Examples include Wulfhere (\"Wolf Army\", or \"He whose army is the wolf\"), Cynewulf (\"Royal Wolf\"), C\u0113nwulf (\"Bold Wolf\"), Wulfheard (\"Wolf-hard\"), Earnwulf (\"Eagle Wolf\"), Wulfst\u0101n (\"Wolf Stone\") \u00c6\u00f0elwulf (\"Noble Wolf\"), Wolfhroc (\"Wolf-Frock\"), Wolfhetan (\"Wolf Hide\"), Isangrim (\"Gray Mask\"), Scrutolf (\"Garb Wolf\"), Wolfgang (\"Wolf Gait\") and Wolfdregil (\"Wolf Runner\").{{sfn|Marvin|2012|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{cladogram|title=Canine phylogeny with ages of divergence\n|caption=Cladogram and divergence of the gray wolf (including the domestic dog) among its closest extant relatives<ref name=Koepfli-2015/>\n|cladogram={{clade| style=font-size:85%;line-height:75%;width:600px;\n|sublabel1=''3.50 [[Million years ago|mya]]''<!--E-->\n|1={{clade\n   |sublabel1=''3.06 mya''<!--F-->\n   |1={{clade\n      |sublabel1=''2.74 mya''<!--G-->\n      |1={{clade\n         |sublabel1=''1.92 mya''<!--H-->\n         |1={{clade\n            |sublabel1=''1.62 mya''<!--I-->\n            |1={{clade\n               |sublabel1=''1.32 mya''<!--J-->\n               |1={{clade\n                  |sublabel1=''1.10 mya''<!--K-->\n                  |1={{clade\n                     |1='''Gray wolf''' [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate I).png|50 px]]\n                     |2=[[Coyote]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate IX).png|50 px]]\n                     }}\n                  |2=[[African golden wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XI).jpg|50 px]]\n                  }}\n               |2=[[Ethiopian wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate VI).png|50 px]]\n               }}\n            |2=[[Golden jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate X).png|50 px]]\n            }}\n         |2=[[Dhole]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XLI).png|50 px]]\n         }}\n      |2=[[African wild dog]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XLIV).png|50 px]]\n      }}\n   |sublabel2=''2.62 mya''<!--D-->\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Side-striped jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XIII).png|50 px]]\n      |2=[[Black-backed jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XII).png|50 px]]\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n}}\nIn 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist [[Carl Linnaeus]] published in his ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]]'' the [[binomial nomenclature]].<ref name=Linnaeus1758/> ''[[Canis]]'' is the Latin word meaning \"[[dog]]\",<ref>{{OEtymD|canine}}</ref> and under this [[genus]] he listed the doglike carnivores including domestic dogs, wolves, and [[jackal]]s. He classified the domestic dog as ''Canis familiaris'', and the wolf as ''Canis lupus''.<ref name=Linnaeus1758/> Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its ''cauda recurvata''\u2013its upturning tail\u2013which is not found in any other [[canid]].<ref name=Clutton-Brock1995/>\n\n===Subspecies===\n{{Main|Subspecies of Canis lupus}}\nIn the third edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' published in 2005, the [[mammalogist]] [[W. Chris Wozencraft|W. Christopher Wozencraft]] listed under ''C. lupus'' 36 wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subspecies: ''familiaris'' (Linnaeus, 1758) and ''[[dingo]]'' (Meyer, 1793). Wozencraft included ''hallstromi''\u2013the [[New Guinea singing dog]]\u2013as a [[taxonomic synonym]] for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to a 1999 [[mitochondrial DNA]] study as one of the guides in forming his decision, and listed the 38 [[Subspecies of Canis lupus|subspecies of ''C. lupus'']] under the biological [[common name]] of \"wolf\", the [[nominate subspecies]] being the [[Eurasian wolf]] (''C. l. lupus'') based on the [[type specimen]] that Linnaeus studied in Sweden.<ref name=Wozencraft2005/> Studies using [[Paleogenomics|paleogenomic]] techniques reveal that the modern wolf and the dog are [[sister taxa]], as modern wolves are not closely related to the population of wolves that was first [[Domestication|domesticated]].<ref name=Larson2014/> In 2019, a workshop hosted by the [[IUCN]]/Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the New Guinea singing dog and the dingo to be feral dogs ''Canis familiaris'', and therefore should not be assessed for the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=Alvares2019/>\n\n=== Evolution ===\n{{Main|Evolution of the wolf}}\n{{Further|Origin of the domestic dog}}\n[[File:Canisetr.JPG|thumb|alt=Skull of ''Canis etruscus'' |A ''[[Canis etruscus]]'' skull in the [[Montevarchi]] Paleontological Museum]]\nThe [[phylogenetic]] descent of the extant wolf ''C. lupus'' from ''[[Canis etruscus|C. etruscus]]'' through ''[[Canis mosbachensis|C. mosbachensis]]'' is widely accepted.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=239\u2013245}} The earliest fossils of ''C. lupus'' were found in what was once eastern [[Beringia]] at [[Old Crow, Yukon]], Canada, and at Cripple Creek Sump, [[Fairbanks]], Alaska. The age is not agreed upon but could date to one million years ago. Considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves by the [[Late Pleistocene]]. They had more robust skulls and teeth than modern wolves, often with a shortened [[Rostrum (anatomy)#Vertebrates|snout]], a pronounced development of the [[temporalis]] muscle, and robust [[premolar]]s. It is proposed that these features were specialized adaptations for the processing of carcass and bone associated with the hunting and scavenging of [[Pleistocene megafauna]]. Compared with modern wolves, some Pleistocene wolves showed an increase in tooth breakage that is similar to that seen in the extinct [[dire wolf]]. This suggests that they either often processed carcasses, or that they competed with other carnivores and needed to consume their prey quickly. Compared with those found in the modern [[spotted hyena]], the frequency and location of tooth fractures found in these wolves indicates that they were habitual bone crackers.<ref name=Thalmann2018/>\n\n[[Genome|Genomic]] studies suggest that modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population<ref name=Freedman2014/><ref name=Skoglund2015/><ref name=Fan2016/> that existed 20,000 years ago.<ref name=Freedman2014/> Studies in 2017 and 2018 found that the [[Himalayan wolf]] is part of a [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] that is [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to other wolves and [[Cladogenesis|split]] from them 691,000\u2013740,000 years ago.<ref name=Werhahn2017/><ref name=Werhahn2018/> Other wolves appear to have originated in Beringia in an expansion that was driven by the huge ecological changes that occurred during the close of the Late Pleistocene.<ref name=Werhahn2018/> A study in 2016 indicates that a [[population bottleneck]] was followed by a rapid [[Adaptive radiation|radiation]] from an ancestral population at a time during, or just after, the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. This implies that the original morphologically diverse wolf populations were out-competed and replaced by more modern wolves.<ref name=Koblmuller2016/>\n\nA 2016 genomic study suggests that Old World and New World wolves split around 12,500 years ago followed by the [[Genetic divergence|divergence]] of the lineage that led to dogs from other Old World wolves around 11,100\u201312,300 years ago.<ref name=Fan2016/> An extinct [[Megafaunal wolf|Late Pleistocene wolf]] may have been the ancestor of the dog,<ref name=Freedman2017/><ref name=Thalmann2018/> with the dog's similarity to the extant wolf being the result of [[genetic admixture]] between the two.<ref name=Thalmann2018/> The dingo, [[Basenji]], [[Tibetan Mastiff]] and Chinese indigenous breeds are basal members of the domestic dog clade. The divergence time for wolves in Europe, the Middle East and Asia is estimated to be fairly recent at around 1,600 years ago. Among New World wolves, the [[Mexican wolf]] diverged around 5,400 years ago.<ref name=Fan2016/>\n\n===Admixture with other canids===\n{{Main|Canid hybrid}}\n[[File:F1 wolf-dog hybrids from Wildlife Park Kadzidlowo, Poland.png|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Photographs of two wolf-dog hybrids standing outdoors on snowy ground|[[Wolfdog|Wolf-dog hybrid]]s in the Wild Animal Park at [[Kadzid\u0142owo]], Poland. The first is the product of a male wolf and a female [[spaniel]], the second from a female wolf and a male [[West Siberian Laika]].]]\n\nIn the distant past, there has been [[gene flow]] between [[African golden wolves]], [[golden jackal]]s, and gray wolves. The African golden wolf is a descendant of a genetically admixed canid of 72% wolf and 28% Ethiopian wolf ancestry. One African golden wolf from the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]] shows admixture with Middle Eastern wolves and dogs.<ref name=Gopalakrishnan2018/> There is evidence of gene flow between golden jackals and Middle Eastern wolves, less so with European and Asian wolves, and least with North American wolves. This indicates that the golden jackal ancestry found in North American wolves may have occurred before the divergence of the Eurasian and North American wolves.<ref name=Sinding2018/>\n\nThe common ancestor of the coyote and the wolf has admixed with a [[ghost population]] of an extinct unidentified canid. This canid is genetically close to the [[dhole]] and evolved after the divergence of the [[African hunting dog]] from the other canid species. The basal position of the [[coyote]] compared to the wolf is proposed to be due to the coyote retaining more of the mitochondrial genome of this unidentified canid.<ref name=Gopalakrishnan2018/> Similarly, a museum specimen of a wolf from southern China collected in 1963 showed a genome that was 12\u201314% admixed from this unknown canid.<ref name=Wang2019/> In North America, most coyotes and wolves show varying degrees of past genetic admixture. The [[red wolf]] of the [[southeastern United States]] is a hybrid animal with 40%:60% wolf to coyote ancestry. In addition, there was found to be 60%:40% wolf to coyote genetics in [[Eastern wolf|Eastern timber wolves]], and 75%:25% in the [[Great Lakes region]] wolves.<ref name=Sinding2018/>\n\nIn more recent times, some male [[Italian wolf|Italian wolves]] originated from dog ancestry, which indicates that female wolves will breed with male dogs in the wild.<ref name=Iacolina2010/> In the [[Caucasus Mountains]], 10% of dogs including [[livestock guardian dog]]s, are first generation hybrids.<ref name=Kopaliani2014/> Although mating between golden jackals and wolves has never been observed, evidence of [[jackal-wolf hybrid]]ization was discovered through mitochondrial DNA analysis of jackals living in the Caucasus Mountains<ref name=Kopaliani2014/> and in Bulgaria.<ref name=Moura2013/>\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Canis lupus laying.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a reclining North American wolf looking directly at the photographer |A North American wolf]]\nThe wolf is the largest member of the [[Canidae]] family,<ref name=Mech1974/> and is further distinguished from coyotes and jackals by a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and a longer tail.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=129\u2013132}}<ref name=Mech1974/> It is slender and powerfully built with a large, deeply descending [[rib cage]], a sloping back, and a heavily muscled neck.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=166}} The wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables the animal to move swiftly, and to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range in winter.{{sfn|Mech|1981|p=13}} The ears are relatively small and triangular.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=166}} The wolf's head is large and heavy, with a wide forehead, strong jaws and a long, blunt muzzle.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} The skull averages {{convert|230|\u2013|280|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|130|\u2013|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} in width.{{sfn|Mech|1981|p=14}} The teeth are heavy and large, making them better suited to crushing bone than those of other canids.

Their vision is as good as that of humans, and they can smell prey at least {{convert|2.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. One wolf travelled to a herd {{convert|103|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. A human can detect the smell of a forest fire over the same distance if it is downwind. The wolf's sense of smell is at least comparable to that of the domestic dog. Both have a sense of smell at least 10,000 times more sensitive than that of humans.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n====Pursuit====\n[[File:Canis lupus pack surrounding Bison.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of an American bison standing its ground surrounded by six wolves in winter|An [[American bison]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]] standing its ground. Bison, elk, and moose will usually stand their ground against a pack of wolves.]]\nWhen hunting large gregarious prey, wolves will try to isolate an individual from its group.<ref name=MacNulty2007/> If successful, a wolf pack can bring down game that will feed it for days, but one error in judgement can lead to serious injury or death. Most large prey have developed defensive adaptations and behaviours. Wolves have been killed while attempting to bring down [[bison]], elk, moose, muskoxen, and even by one of their smallest hoofed prey, the white-tailed deer.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} Although people often believe that wolves can easily overcome any of their prey, their success rate in hunting hoofed prey is usually low.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|p=7}}\n\nGenerally, bison, elk, and moose will stand their ground, then the wolves must struggle with them to bring them down. Often caribou and deer will flee, but sometimes deer also make a stand. With smaller prey like [[beaver]], geese, and hares, there is no risk to the wolf.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} If the targeted animal stands its ground, wolves either ignore it, or try to intimidate it into running.{{snf|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=119\u2013121}} Wolves, or even a wolf on its own, will attempt to frighten a herd into panicking and dispersing.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=241\u2013242}}\n\nWhen wolves encounter prey that flees, they give chase. The speed of sprinting prey is closely related to the speed of their main predators. Wolves can run at {{convert|56|-|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} across several kilometers and will often pursue prey for at least {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}}. One wolf chased a caribou for {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}}, another chased and tracked a deer for {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and one 11-year-old wolf chased and caught an [[Arctic hare]] after seven minutes. Most wolf prey will try to run to water, where they will either escape or be better placed to attempt to ward off the wolves.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n====Disablement====\nThe wolf must give chase and gain on its fleeing prey, slow it down by biting through thick hair and hide, and then disable it enough to begin feeding.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} After chasing and then confronting a large prey animal, the wolf makes use of its {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} fangs and its powerful [[masseter muscle]]s to deliver a [[Bite force quotient|bite force]] of {{convert|28|kg/cm2|lb/in2|abbr=on}}, which is capable of breaking open the skulls of many of its prey animals. The wolf leaps at its quarry and tears at it. One wolf was observed being dragged for dozens of metres attached to the hind leg of a moose; another was seen being dragged over a fallen log while attached to a bull elk's nose.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|p=4}}\n\nThe most common point of wolf attacks on moose is the upper hind legs.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=28\u201345}}<ref name=Peterson2007/><ref name=Buskirk1978/> Hind leg wounds are inflicted from the rear, midway up the [[Hock (anatomy)|hock]] with the canine teeth. These leave gaping skin perforations over {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. Although blood loss, muscle damage, and tendon exposure may occur, there is no evidence of [[hamstringing]]. Attacks also occur on the fleshy nose, the back and sides of the neck, the ears, and the [[perineum]].<ref name=Buskirk1978/> Wolves may wound large prey and then lie around resting for hours before killing it when it is weaker due to blood loss, thereby lessening the risk of injury to themselves.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|p=82\u201389}}\n[[File:Wolves eating deer.jpeg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of two wolves eating a deer carcass at night|Two wolves feeding on a [[white-tailed deer]] kill]]\nWith medium-sized prey, such as roe deer or [[sheep]], wolves kill by biting the throat, severing nerve tracks and the [[carotid artery]], thus causing the animal to die within a few seconds to a minute.

Such instances are common with domestic animals, but rare with wild prey. In the wild, surplus killing occurs primarily during late winter or spring, when snow is unusually deep (thus impeding the movements of prey){{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=144}} or during the denning period, when den bound wolves require a ready supply of meat.{{sfn|Lopez|1978|pp=54\u201355}} Medium-sized prey are especially vulnerable to surplus killing, as the swift throat-biting method allows wolves to kill one animal quickly and move on to another.<ref name=Zimen/>\n\n====Feeding====\nOnce prey is brought down, wolves begin to feed excitedly, ripping and tugging at the carcass in all directions, and bolting down large chunks of it.{{sfn|Mech|1981|p=185}} The breeding pair typically monopolizes food to continue producing pups. When food is scarce, this is done at the expense of other family members, especially non-pups.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=58}} The breeding pair typically eats first. They usually work the hardest at killing prey, and may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat undisturbed. Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transports them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs, like the [[heart]], [[liver]], [[lung]]s, and [[stomach]] lining. The [[kidney]]s and [[spleen]] are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscles.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=122\u2013125}} A wolf can eat 15\u201319% of its body weight in a single feeding.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=201}}\n\n== Infections ==\n\n=== Viral and bacterial ===\n[[File:Arctic-Lineage-Canine-Distemper-Virus-as-a-Cause-of-Death-in-Apennine-Wolves-(Canis-lupus)-in-Italy-pone.0082356.s001.ogv|thumb|alt=Footage of a wolf with advanced canine distemper|Footage of a wolf taken from [[Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise|Abruzzo Natural Park]] showing advanced signs of [[canine distemper]]]]\n\n[[Viral disease]]s carried by wolves include: [[rabies]], [[canine distemper]], [[canine parvovirus]], [[infectious canine hepatitis]], [[papillomatosis]], and [[canine coronavirus]].{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=208\u2013211}} Wolves are a major host for rabies in Russia, Iran, [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] and India.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} In wolves, the [[incubation period]] is eight to 21 days, and results in the host becoming agitated, deserting its pack, and travelling up to {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} a day, thus increasing the risk of infecting other wolves. Infected wolves do not show any fear of humans, most documented wolf attacks on people being attributed to rabid animals. Although canine distemper is lethal in dogs, it has not been recorded to kill wolves, except in Canada and Alaska. The canine parvovirus, which causes death by [[dehydration]], [[electrolyte imbalance]], and [[Endotoxin|endotoxic]] shock or [[sepsis]], is largely survivable in wolves, but can be lethal to pups. Wolves may catch infectious canine hepatitis from dogs, though there are no records of wolves dying from it. Papillomatosis has been recorded only once in wolves, and likely does not cause serious illness or death, though it may alter feeding behaviours. The canine coronavirus has been recorded in Alaskan wolves, infections being most prevalent in winter months.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=208\u2013211}}\n\n[[Bacterial diseases]] carried by wolves include: [[brucellosis]], [[Lyme disease]], [[leptospirosis]], [[tularemia]], [[bovine tuberculosis]],{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=211\u2013213}} [[listeriosis]] and [[anthrax]].{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} Wolves can catch ''[[Brucella suis]]'' from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves tend not to show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, it does not appear to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause [[fever]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], vomiting, [[anemia]], [[hematuria]], [[Jaundice|icterus]], and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from [[lagomorph]] prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have killed two wolf pups in Canada.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=211\u2013213}}\n\n=== Parasitic ===\n[[File:Wild Wolf Afflicted with Mange.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a wolf afflicted with sarcoptuc mange eating at a kill|A wolf in the Yellowstone National Park afflicted with [[sarcoptic mange]]]]\n\nWolves carry [[ectoparasite]]s and [[endoparasite]]s; those in the former [[Soviet Union]] have been recorded to carry at least 50 species.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} Most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects, though the effects may become more serious in sick or malnourished specimens.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} [[Parasitic infection]] in wolves is of particular concern to people. Wolves can spread them to dogs, which in turn can carry the parasites to humans. In areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas, the parasites can be spread to livestock.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}}\n\nWolves are often infested with a variety of [[arthropod]] exoparasites, including [[flea]]s, [[tick]]s, [[Louse|lice]], and [[mite]]s. The most harmful to wolves, particularly pups, is the mange mite (''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]''),{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} though they rarely develop full-blown [[mange]], unlike foxes.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} Lice, such as ''[[Trichodectes canis]]'', may cause sickness in wolves, but rarely death. Ticks of the genus ''[[Ixodes]]'' can infect wolves with Lyme disease and [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]].{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} The tick ''[[Dermacentor]] pictus'' also infests wolves. Other ectoparasites include [[Mallophaga|chewing lice]], [[Sucking louse|sucking lice]] and the fleas ''[[Pulex irritans]]'' and ''[[Ctenocephalides canis]]''.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}}\n\nEndoparasites known to infect wolves include: [[protozoan]]s and [[helminth]]s ([[Trematoda|flukes]], [[tapeworm]]s, [[roundworm]]s and [[thorny-headed worm]]s). Of 30,000 protozoan species, only a few have been recorded to infect wolves: ''[[Isospora]]'', ''[[Toxoplasma]]'', ''[[Sarcocystis]]'', ''[[Babesia]]'', and ''[[Giardia]]''.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} Some wolves carry ''[[Neospora caninum]]'', which can be spread to cattle and is correlated with bovine [[miscarriage]]s.<ref name=Dubey2011/> Among flukes, the most common in North American wolves is ''[[Alaria (trematode)|Alaria]]'', which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves. Upon reaching maturity, ''Alaria'' migrates to the wolf's intestine, but does little harm. ''[[Metorchis conjunctus]]'', which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing [[liver disease]], inflammation of the pancreas, and [[emaciation]]. Most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though ''[[Paragonimus westermani]]'' lives in the lungs. Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon. Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host. Symptoms often include [[constipation]], toxic and [[allergic reaction]]s, irritation of the [[intestinal mucosa]], and [[malnutrition]]. Infections by the tapeworm ''[[Echinococcus granulosus]]'' in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed ''Echinoccocus'' eggs in their feces onto grazing areas.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}}\n\nWolves can carry over 30 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host. ''[[Ancylostoma caninum]]'' attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause [[hyperchromic anemia]], emaciation, [[diarrhea]], and possibly death. ''[[Toxocara canis]]'', a [[hookworm]] known to infect wolf pups in the uterus, can cause intestinal irritation, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Wolves may catch ''[[Dioctophyma renale]]'' from [[American mink|mink]]s, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of {{convert|100|cm|abbr=on}}. ''D. renale'' causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected. Wolves can tolerate low levels of ''[[Dirofilaria immitis]]'' for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and [[congestive hepatopathy]]. Wolves probably become infected with ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'' by eating infected ungulates. Although ''T. spiralis'' is not known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause emaciation, salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs. Thorny-headed worms rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in Russian wolves: ''[[Nicolla skrjabini]]'', ''Macrocantorhynchus catulinus'', and ''[[Moniliformis moniliformis]]''.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}}\n\n==Status and conservation==\n{{Further|List of gray wolf populations by country}}\nThe global wolf population in 2003 was estimated at 300,000.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=230}} Wolf population declines have been arrested since the 1970s. This has fostered recolonization and reintroduction in parts of its former range as a result of legal protection, changes in land use, and rural human population shifts to cities. Competition with humans for livestock and game species, concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people, and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the wolf. Despite these threats, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] classifies the wolf as [[Least Concern]] on its [[IUCN Red List|Red List]] due to its relatively widespread range and stable population.

Although Aesop used wolves to warn, criticize and moralize about human behaviour, his portrayals added to the wolf's image as a deceitful and dangerous animal.{{sfn|Marvin|2012|pp=38\u201340}} The [[Bible]] contains 13 references to wolves, usually as metaphors for greed and destructiveness. In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] is said to have used wolves as illustrations of the dangers his followers, whom he represents as sheep, would face should they follow him.({{bibleref2|Matthew|7:15}}, {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:16}} and {{bibleref2|Acts|20:29}}).<ref name=\"BOTF\"/> In the [[Jataka tales]] the wolf is portrayed as a [[trickster]], including one story were it makes a hunter stop playing dead by pulling on his club.<ref name=Babbitt/> In another story, the wolf tricks and eats some rats by pretending to be lame but is foiled by the chief rat.<ref name=Babbitt2/>\n[[File:The Two Jungle Books 1895 Akela, the Lone Wolf.jpg|thumb|alt=The Two Jungle Books 1895 Akela, the Lone Wolf|[[Akela (The Jungle Book)|Akela]], the leader of the Seeonee Wolf Pack which raises [[Mowgli]] in the [[Jungle Book]], from an illustration by [[John Lockwood Kipling]]]]\nIsengrim the wolf, a character first appearing in the 12th-century Latin poem ''[[Ysengrimus]]'', is a major character in the [[Reynard]] Cycle, where he stands for the low nobility, whilst his adversary, Reynard the fox, represents the peasant hero. Isengrim is forever the victim of Reynard's wit and cruelty, often dying at the end of each story.{{sfn|Lopez|1978|p=259}} The tale of \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\", first written in 1697 by [[Charles Perrault]], is considered to have further damaged the wolf's negative reputation in the Western world. The [[Big Bad Wolf]] is portrayed as a villain capable of imitating human speech and disguising itself with human clothing. The character as been interpreted as an allegorical [[sexual predator]].{{sfn|Marvin|2012|pp=64\u201370}} Villainous wolf characters also appear in ''[[The Three Little Pigs]]'' and \"[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats]]\".{{sfn|Lopez|1978|p=263}} The hunting of wolves, and their attacks on humans and livestock, feature prominently in [[Russian literature]], and are included in the works of [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], [[Ivan Bunin]], [[Leonid Pavlovich Sabaneyev]], and others. Tolstoy's ''[[War and Peace]]'' and Chekhov's ''Peasants'' both feature scenes in which wolves are hunted with hounds and [[Borzoi]]s.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=21, 123}} The musical ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'' involves a wolf being captured for eating a farm duck, but is spared and sent to a zoo.{{sfn|Marvin|2012|p=162}}\n\nWolves are among the central characters of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]''. His portrayal of wolves has been praised posthumously by wolf biologists for his depiction of them: rather than being villainous or gluttonous, as was common in wolf portrayals at the time of the book's publication, they are shown as living in amiable family groups and drawing on the experience of infirm but experienced elder pack members.<ref name=Kipling/> [[Farley Mowat]]'s largely fictional 1963 memoir ''[[Never Cry Wolf]]'' is widely considered to be the most popular book on wolves, having been adapted into a [[Never Cry Wolf (film)|Hollywood film]] and taught in several schools decades after its publication. Although credited with having changed popular perceptions on wolves by portraying them as loving, cooperative and noble, it has been criticized for its idealization of wolves and its factual inaccuracies.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=294}}<ref name=Jones/><ref name=\"Nevercrywolf\"/> [[L\u00fc Jiamin]]'s 2004 semi-autobiographical novel ''[[Wolf Totem]]'' uses wolves as symbols of freedom and independence. He associates the Mongolian nomads with wolves and compares the Han Chinese of the present day to sheep, claiming they accept any leadership. As such, the novel as caused controversy with the [[Chinese Communist Party]].<ref name=\"DS20060321\"/><ref name=\"NYT20051103\"/>\n\n==== In heraldry and emblems ====\n{{Main|Wolves in heraldry}}\n[[File:Pawnee flag.svg|thumb|right|alt=Pawnee Nation tribal flag in red white and blue featuring a stylized wolf and a U.S. flag, a hatchet crossed with a pipe, and eight arrow heads|The Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma tribal flag]]\nThe wolf is a frequent [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] in [[English heraldry]]. It is illustrated as a [[supporter]] on the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shields]] of [[Lord Welby]], [[Lord Rendel|Rendel]], and [[Viscount Wolseley]], and can be found on the [[coat of arms]] of Lovett and the vast majority of the [[Wilson (name)|Wilsons]] and Lows. The demi-wolf is a common [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]], appearing in the arms and crests of members of many families, including that of the Wolfes, whose crest depicts a demi-wolf holding a crown in its paws, in reference to the assistance the family gave to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] during the [[Battle of Worcester]]. Wolf heads are common in [[Scottish heraldry]], particularly in the coats of [[Clan Donnachaidh|Clan Robertson]] and [[Clan Skene|Skene]]. The wolf is the most common animal in [[Spanish heraldry]] and is often depicted as carrying a lamb in its mouth, or across its back.<ref name=Heraldry/>\n\nThe wolf is featured on the [[flag]]s of the [[Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation]], the [[Oneida Nation of Wisconsin]] and the Pawnee.<ref name=NAflags/> The [[Chechen wolf]] has been a symbol of the [[Chechens|Chechen Nation]].<ref name=JaimoukhaWolf/> In modern times, the wolf is widely used as an emblem for military and paramilitary groups. It is the unofficial symbol of the [[spetsnaz]], and serves as the logo of the Turkish [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Gray Wolves]]. During the [[Yugoslav Wars]], several [[Serb paramilitary]] units adopted the wolf as their symbol, including the White Wolves and the [[Wolves of Vu\u010djak]].{{sfn|Marvin|2012|pp=78\u201379}}\n\n=== Conflicts ===\nHuman presence appears to stress wolves, as seen by increased cortisol levels in instances such as snowmobiling near their territory.<ref name=Creel/>\n\n==== Wolf predation on livestock ====\n[[File:The Allendale Wolf.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Black and white photograph of a dead wolf with \"The Allendale Wolf\" written on the bottom|A 1905 postcard of the [[Hexham wolf]], an escaped captive wolf shot for killing livestock in England]]\nLivestock depredation has been one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves and can pose a severe problem for wolf conservation. As well as causing economic losses, the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}} Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programs or state insurance.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=309}} Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves, as they have been bred under constant human protection, and are thus unable to defend themselves very well.{{sfn|Mech|1981|p=173}} Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted. In Eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock, while such incidents are rare in North America, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}}\n\nThe majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period, untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=307}} The most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep (Europe), [[Reindeer herding|domestic reindeer]] (northern Scandinavia), [[goat]]s (India), [[horse]]s (Mongolia), [[cattle]] and [[Domestic turkey|turkeys]] (North America).{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}} The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=306}} Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing, though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures.{{sfn|Graves|2007|p=45}}\n\n==== Conflicts with dogs ====\nA review of the studies on the competitive effects of dogs on [[Sympatry|sympatric]] carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves.<ref name=Vanak2014/><ref name=Lescureaux2014 /> Competition would favour the wolf, which is known to kill dogs; however wolves usually live in pairs or in small packs in areas with high human persecution, giving them a disadvantage facing large groups of dogs.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 /><ref name=Boitani1983/>\n\nWolves kill dogs on occasion, and some wolf populations rely on dogs as an important food source. In Croatia, wolves kill more dogs than sheep, and wolves in Russia appear to limit stray dog populations. Wolves may display unusually bold behaviour when attacking dogs accompanied by people, sometimes ignoring nearby humans. Wolf attacks on dogs may occur both in house yards and in forests. Wolf attacks on hunting dogs are considered a major problem in Scandinavia and Wisconsin.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}}<ref name=\"Jess\" /> The most frequently killed hunting breeds in Scandinavia are [[Harrier (dog)|Harrier]]s, older animals being most at risk, likely because they are less timid than younger animals, and react to the presence of wolves differently. Large hunting dogs such as [[J\u00e4mthund|Swedish Elkhound]]s are more likely to survive wolf attacks because of their better ability to defend themselves.<ref name=\"Jess\" />\n\nAlthough the numbers of dogs killed each year by wolves are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to prey on dogs. In many cultures, there are strong bonds between humans and their dogs that can be seen as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses, with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 />\n\nDogs that are employed to guard sheep help to mitigate human\u2013wolf conflicts, and are often proposed as one of the non-lethal tools in the conservation of wolves.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 /><ref name=Shivik2006/> Shepherd dogs are not particularly aggressive, but they can disrupt potential wolf predation by displaying what is to the wolf ambiguous behaviours, such as barking, social greeting, invitation to play or aggression. The historical use of shepherd dogs across Eurasia has been effective against wolf predation,<ref name=Lescureaux2014 /><ref name=Coppinger1995 /> especially when confining sheep in the presence of several livestock guardian dogs.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 /><ref name=Espuno2004/> Shepherd dogs are sometimes killed by wolves.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 />\n\n==== Wolf attacks on humans ====\n{{Main|Wolf attack|List of wolf attacks}}\n[[File:Grenier Saint Martin loup MdlaC.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of a wolf snarling at three children entitled ''Country children surprised by a wolf''  by Fran\u00e7ois Grenier de Saint-Martin|''Country children surprised by a wolf'' (1833) by Fran\u00e7ois Grenier de Saint-Martin]]\nThe fear of wolves has been pervasive in many societies, though humans are not part of the wolf's natural prey.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> How wolves react to humans depends largely on their prior experience with people: wolves lacking any negative experience of humans, or which are food-conditioned, may show little fear of people.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=300\u2013304}} Although wolves may react aggressively when provoked, such attacks are mostly limited to quick bites on extremities, and the attacks are not pressed.<ref name=\"Linnell\"/>\n\nPredatory attacks may be preceded by a long period of [[habituation]], in which wolves gradually lose their fear of humans. The victims are repeatedly bitten on the head and face, and are then dragged off and consumed, unless the wolves are driven off. Such attacks typically occur only locally, and do not stop until the wolves involved are eliminated. Predatory attacks can occur at any time of the year, with a peak in the June\u2013August period, when the chances of people entering forested areas (for livestock [[grazing]] or berry and mushroom picking) increase.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> Cases of non-rabid wolf attacks in winter have been recorded in [[Belarus]], [[Kirov Oblast|Kirov]] and [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk]] oblasts, [[Karelia]] and [[Ukraine]]. Also, wolves with pups experience greater food stresses during this period.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} The majority of victims of predatory wolf attacks are children under the age of 18 and, in the rare cases where adults are killed, the victims are almost always women.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> Indian wolves have a history of preying on children, a phenomenon called \"child-lifting\". They may be taken primarily in the summer period in the evening hours, and often within human settlements.<ref name=\"Rajpurohit1999\"/>\n\nCases of rabid wolves are low when compared to other species, as wolves do not serve as primary reservoirs of the disease, but can be infected by animals such as dogs, jackals and foxes. Incidents of rabies in wolves are very rare in North America, though numerous in the eastern [[Mediterranean]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]]. Wolves apparently develop the \"furious\" phase of rabies to a very high degree. This, coupled with their size and strength, makes rabid wolves perhaps the most dangerous of rabid animals.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> Bites from rabid wolves are 15 times more dangerous than those of rabid dogs.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=267}} Rabid wolves usually act alone, travelling large distances and often biting large numbers of people and domestic animals. Most rabid wolf attacks occur in the spring and autumn periods. Unlike with predatory attacks, the victims of rabid wolves are not eaten, and the attacks generally only occur on a single day. The victims are chosen at random, though most cases involve adult men. During the 50 years to 2002, there were eight fatal attacks in Europe and Russia, and more than 200 in southern Asia.<ref name=\"Linnell\" />\n\n==== Human hunting of wolves ====\n{{Main|Wolf hunting|Wolf hunting with dogs}}\n{{See also|Wolf hunting#Quarry|l1=Human uses of hunted wolves}}\n[[File:Provedenie meropriyatii po otstrelu vrednyh givotnyh na territorii Kamyshinskogo raiona Volgogradskoi oblasti.jpg|thumb|alt=Two men with guns pose behind nine carcasses of hunted wolves|Carcasses of hunted wolves in [[Volgograd Oblast]], Russia]]\n[[Theodore Roosevelt]] stated that wolves are difficult to hunt because of their elusiveness, sharp senses, high endurance, and ability to quickly incapacitate and kill hunting dogs.<ref name=\"Roosevelt\"/> Historic methods included killing of spring-born litters in their dens, [[coursing]] with dogs (usually combinations of [[sighthound]]s, [[Bloodhound]]s and [[Fox Terrier]]s), poisoning with [[strychnine]], and [[trapping]].{{sfn|Lopez|1978|p=108}}{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=121\u2013140}}\n\nA popular method of wolf hunting in Russia involves trapping a pack within a small area by encircling it with [[fladry]] poles carrying a human scent. This method relies heavily on the wolf's fear of human scents, though it can lose its effectiveness when wolves become accustomed to the odor. Some hunters can lure wolves by imitating their calls. In [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Mongolia]], wolves are traditionally hunted with eagles and falcons, though this practice is declining, as experienced falconers are becoming few in number. Shooting wolves from aircraft is highly effective, due to increased visibility and direct lines of fire.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=121\u2013140}} Several types of dog, including the Borzoi and [[Taigan|Kyrgyz Tajgan]], have been specifically bred for wolf hunting.<ref name=Lescureaux2014/>\n\n=== As pets and working animals ===\n{{Main|Wolves as pets and working animals}}\nWolves and [[wolf-dog hybrid]]s are sometimes kept as [[exotic pet]]s. Although closely related to domestic dogs, wolves do not show the same tractability as dogs in living alongside humans, being generally less responsive to human commands and more likely to act aggressively.

It is the largest [[Neontology|extant]] member of [[Canidae]], males averaging {{convert|40|kg|abbr=on}} and females {{convert|37|kg|abbr=on}}. On average, wolves measure {{convert|105|\u2013|160|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|80|\u2013|85|cm|in|abbr=on}} at shoulder height. The wolf is also distinguished from other ''[[Canis]]'' species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller ''Canis'' species, such as the [[coyote]] and the [[golden jackal]], to produce fertile [[Canid hybrid|hybrid]]s with them. The [[Agouti (coloration)|banded]] fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black. Up to 38 [[Subspecies of Canis lupus|subspecies of wolf]] have been recognized including the [[Dog|domestic dog]].\n\nOf all members of the [[genus]] ''Canis'', the wolf is most [[Generalist and specialist species|specialized]] for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more [[Sociality|social nature]], and its highly advanced [[Wolf communication|expressive behaviour]]. It travels in [[Nuclear family|nuclear families]] consisting of a [[mated pair]] accompanied by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition for food within the pack. Wolves are also [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality. The wolf is mainly a [[carnivore]] and feeds primarily on large wild [[hooved mammal]]s, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, [[carrion]], and garbage. Single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs. [[Pathogen]]s and parasites, notably [[rabies]], may infect wolves.\n\nThe global wolf population was estimated to be 300,000 in 2003 and is considered to be of [[Least-concern species|Least Concern]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). Wolves have a long history of interactions with humans, having been despised and hunted in most [[Pastoralism|pastoral]] communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] and [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. Although the fear of wolves exists in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. [[Wolf attack]]s on humans are rare because wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans because of their experiences with hunters, ranchers, and shepherds.\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{See also|Wolf (name)}}\nThe English \"wolf\" stems from the [[Old English]] {{wikt-lang|ang|wulf}}, which is itself thought to be derived from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|*wulfaz}}. The [[Proto-Indo-European root]] *''{{PIE|[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/w\u013a\u0325k\u02b7os|w\u013a\u0325k\u02b7os]]}}'' may also be the source of the [[Latin]] word for the animal ''lupus'' (*''{{PIE|l\u00fak\u02b7os}}'').<ref>{{OEtymD|wolf}}</ref><ref name=Lehrman/> The name \"gray wolf\" refers to the grayish colour of the species.<ref name=Goldman/>\n\nSince pre-Christian times, [[Germanic peoples]] such as the [[Anglo-Saxon]]s took on ''wulf'' as a [[prefix]] or [[suffix]] in their names. Examples include Wulfhere (\"Wolf Army\", or \"He whose army is the wolf\"), Cynewulf (\"Royal Wolf\"), C\u0113nwulf (\"Bold Wolf\"), Wulfheard (\"Wolf-hard\"), Earnwulf (\"Eagle Wolf\"), Wulfst\u0101n (\"Wolf Stone\") \u00c6\u00f0elwulf (\"Noble Wolf\"), Wolfhroc (\"Wolf-Frock\"), Wolfhetan (\"Wolf Hide\"), Isangrim (\"Gray Mask\"), Scrutolf (\"Garb Wolf\"), Wolfgang (\"Wolf Gait\") and Wolfdregil (\"Wolf Runner\").{{sfn|Marvin|2012|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{cladogram|title=Canine phylogeny with ages of divergence\n|caption=Cladogram and divergence of the gray wolf (including the domestic dog) among its closest extant relatives<ref name=Koepfli-2015/>\n|cladogram={{clade| style=font-size:85%;line-height:75%;width:600px;\n|sublabel1=''3.50 [[Million years ago|mya]]''<!--E-->\n|1={{clade\n   |sublabel1=''3.06 mya''<!--F-->\n   |1={{clade\n      |sublabel1=''2.74 mya''<!--G-->\n      |1={{clade\n         |sublabel1=''1.92 mya''<!--H-->\n         |1={{clade\n            |sublabel1=''1.62 mya''<!--I-->\n            |1={{clade\n               |sublabel1=''1.32 mya''<!--J-->\n               |1={{clade\n                  |sublabel1=''1.10 mya''<!--K-->\n                  |1={{clade\n                     |1='''Gray wolf''' [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate I).png|50 px]]\n                     |2=[[Coyote]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate IX).png|50 px]]\n                     }}\n                  |2=[[African golden wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XI).jpg|50 px]]\n                  }}\n               |2=[[Ethiopian wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate VI).png|50 px]]\n               }}\n            |2=[[Golden jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate X).png|50 px]]\n            }}\n         |2=[[Dhole]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XLI).png|50 px]]\n         }}\n      |2=[[African wild dog]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XLIV).png|50 px]]\n      }}\n   |sublabel2=''2.62 mya''<!--D-->\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Side-striped jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XIII).png|50 px]]\n      |2=[[Black-backed jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XII).png|50 px]]\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n}}\nIn 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist [[Carl Linnaeus]] published in his ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]]'' the [[binomial nomenclature]].<ref name=Linnaeus1758/> ''[[Canis]]'' is the Latin word meaning \"[[dog]]\",<ref>{{OEtymD|canine}}</ref> and under this [[genus]] he listed the doglike carnivores including domestic dogs, wolves, and [[jackal]]s. He classified the domestic dog as ''Canis familiaris'', and the wolf as ''Canis lupus''.<ref name=Linnaeus1758/> Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its ''cauda recurvata''\u2013its upturning tail\u2013which is not found in any other [[canid]].<ref name=Clutton-Brock1995/>\n\n===Subspecies===\n{{Main|Subspecies of Canis lupus}}\nIn the third edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' published in 2005, the [[mammalogist]] [[W. Chris Wozencraft|W. Christopher Wozencraft]] listed under ''C. lupus'' 36 wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subspecies: ''familiaris'' (Linnaeus, 1758) and ''[[dingo]]'' (Meyer, 1793). Wozencraft included ''hallstromi''\u2013the [[New Guinea singing dog]]\u2013as a [[taxonomic synonym]] for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to a 1999 [[mitochondrial DNA]] study as one of the guides in forming his decision, and listed the 38 [[Subspecies of Canis lupus|subspecies of ''C. lupus'']] under the biological [[common name]] of \"wolf\", the [[nominate subspecies]] being the [[Eurasian wolf]] (''C. l. lupus'') based on the [[type specimen]] that Linnaeus studied in Sweden.<ref name=Wozencraft2005/> Studies using [[Paleogenomics|paleogenomic]] techniques reveal that the modern wolf and the dog are [[sister taxa]], as modern wolves are not closely related to the population of wolves that was first [[Domestication|domesticated]].<ref name=Larson2014/> In 2019, a workshop hosted by the [[IUCN]]/Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the New Guinea singing dog and the dingo to be feral dogs ''Canis familiaris'', and therefore should not be assessed for the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=Alvares2019/>\n\n=== Evolution ===\n{{Main|Evolution of the wolf}}\n{{Further|Origin of the domestic dog}}\n[[File:Canisetr.JPG|thumb|alt=Skull of ''Canis etruscus'' |A ''[[Canis etruscus]]'' skull in the [[Montevarchi]] Paleontological Museum]]\nThe [[phylogenetic]] descent of the extant wolf ''C. lupus'' from ''[[Canis etruscus|C. etruscus]]'' through ''[[Canis mosbachensis|C. mosbachensis]]'' is widely accepted.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=239\u2013245}} The earliest fossils of ''C. lupus'' were found in what was once eastern [[Beringia]] at [[Old Crow, Yukon]], Canada, and at Cripple Creek Sump, [[Fairbanks]], Alaska. The age is not agreed upon but could date to one million years ago. Considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves by the [[Late Pleistocene]]. They had more robust skulls and teeth than modern wolves, often with a shortened [[Rostrum (anatomy)#Vertebrates|snout]], a pronounced development of the [[temporalis]] muscle, and robust [[premolar]]s. It is proposed that these features were specialized adaptations for the processing of carcass and bone associated with the hunting and scavenging of [[Pleistocene megafauna]]. Compared with modern wolves, some Pleistocene wolves showed an increase in tooth breakage that is similar to that seen in the extinct [[dire wolf]]. This suggests that they either often processed carcasses, or that they competed with other carnivores and needed to consume their prey quickly. Compared with those found in the modern [[spotted hyena]], the frequency and location of tooth fractures found in these wolves indicates that they were habitual bone crackers.<ref name=Thalmann2018/>\n\n[[Genome|Genomic]] studies suggest that modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population<ref name=Freedman2014/><ref name=Skoglund2015/><ref name=Fan2016/> that existed 20,000 years ago.<ref name=Freedman2014/> Studies in 2017 and 2018 found that the [[Himalayan wolf]] is part of a [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] that is [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to other wolves and [[Cladogenesis|split]] from them 691,000\u2013740,000 years ago.<ref name=Werhahn2017/><ref name=Werhahn2018/> Other wolves appear to have originated in Beringia in an expansion that was driven by the huge ecological changes that occurred during the close of the Late Pleistocene.<ref name=Werhahn2018/> A study in 2016 indicates that a [[population bottleneck]] was followed by a rapid [[Adaptive radiation|radiation]] from an ancestral population at a time during, or just after, the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. This implies that the original morphologically diverse wolf populations were out-competed and replaced by more modern wolves.<ref name=Koblmuller2016/>\n\nA 2016 genomic study suggests that Old World and New World wolves split around 12,500 years ago followed by the [[Genetic divergence|divergence]] of the lineage that led to dogs from other Old World wolves around 11,100\u201312,300 years ago.<ref name=Fan2016/> An extinct [[Megafaunal wolf|Late Pleistocene wolf]] may have been the ancestor of the dog,<ref name=Freedman2017/><ref name=Thalmann2018/> with the dog's similarity to the extant wolf being the result of [[genetic admixture]] between the two.<ref name=Thalmann2018/> The dingo, [[Basenji]], [[Tibetan Mastiff]] and Chinese indigenous breeds are basal members of the domestic dog clade. The divergence time for wolves in Europe, the Middle East and Asia is estimated to be fairly recent at around 1,600 years ago. Among New World wolves, the [[Mexican wolf]] diverged around 5,400 years ago.<ref name=Fan2016/>\n\n===Admixture with other canids===\n{{Main|Canid hybrid}}\n[[File:F1 wolf-dog hybrids from Wildlife Park Kadzidlowo, Poland.png|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Photographs of two wolf-dog hybrids standing outdoors on snowy ground|[[Wolfdog|Wolf-dog hybrid]]s in the Wild Animal Park at [[Kadzid\u0142owo]], Poland. The first is the product of a male wolf and a female [[spaniel]], the second from a female wolf and a male [[West Siberian Laika]].]]\n\nIn the distant past, there has been [[gene flow]] between [[African golden wolves]], [[golden jackal]]s, and gray wolves. The African golden wolf is a descendant of a genetically admixed canid of 72% wolf and 28% Ethiopian wolf ancestry. One African golden wolf from the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]] shows admixture with Middle Eastern wolves and dogs.<ref name=Gopalakrishnan2018/> There is evidence of gene flow between golden jackals and Middle Eastern wolves, less so with European and Asian wolves, and least with North American wolves. This indicates that the golden jackal ancestry found in North American wolves may have occurred before the divergence of the Eurasian and North American wolves.<ref name=Sinding2018/>\n\nThe common ancestor of the coyote and the wolf has admixed with a [[ghost population]] of an extinct unidentified canid. This canid is genetically close to the [[dhole]] and evolved after the divergence of the [[African hunting dog]] from the other canid species. The basal position of the [[coyote]] compared to the wolf is proposed to be due to the coyote retaining more of the mitochondrial genome of this unidentified canid.<ref name=Gopalakrishnan2018/> Similarly, a museum specimen of a wolf from southern China collected in 1963 showed a genome that was 12\u201314% admixed from this unknown canid.<ref name=Wang2019/> In North America, most coyotes and wolves show varying degrees of past genetic admixture.

Though they mostly avoid areas within human sight, wolves have been known to nest near [[Architecture|domiciles]], paved [[road]]s and [[railway]]s.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=234\u2013238}} During pregnancy, female wolves remain in a den located away from the peripheral zone of their territories, where violent encounters with other packs are less likely to occur.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=42\u201346}}\n\nThe [[gestation period]] lasts 62\u201375 days with pups usually being born in the spring months or early summer in very cold places such as on the tundra. Young females give birth to four to five young, and older females from six to eight young and up to 14. Their mortality rate is 60\u201380%.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=249\u2013254}} Newborn wolf pups look similar to [[German Shepherd|German Shepherd Dog]] pups.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=47}} They are born blind and deaf and are covered in short soft grayish-brown fur. They weigh {{convert|300|\u2013|500|g|oz|abbr=on}} at birth and begin to see after nine to 12 days. The milk canines erupt after one month. Pups first leave the den after three weeks. At one-and-a-half months of age, they are agile enough to flee from danger. Mother wolves do not leave the den for the first few weeks, relying on the fathers to provide food for them and their young. Pups begin to eat solid food at the age of three to four weeks. They have a fast growth rate during their first four months of life: during this period, a pup's weight can increase nearly 30 times.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=249\u2013254}}{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=46\u201349}} Wolf pups begin play-fighting at the age of three weeks, though unlike young coyotes and foxes, their bites are gentle and controlled. Actual fights to establish hierarchy usually occur at five to eight weeks of age. This is in contrast to young coyotes and foxes, which may begin fighting even before the onset of play behaviour.<ref name=Fox1978/> By autumn, the pups are mature enough to accompany the adults on hunts for large prey.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=42\u201346}}\n\n===Hunting===\nSingle wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs; single wolves have occasionally been observed to kill large prey such as moose, bison and [[muskox]]en unaided.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=119\u2013121}}<ref name=Thurber1993/> This contrasts with the commonly held belief that larger packs benefit from cooperative hunting to bring down large game.<ref name=Thurber1993/> The size of a wolf hunting pack is related to the number of pups that survived the previous winter, adult survival, and the rate of dispersing wolves leaving the pack. The optimal pack size for hunting elk is four wolves, and for bison a large pack size is more successful.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|p=4}}\n\nAs well as their physical adaptations for hunting hoofed mammals, wolves possess certain behavioural, cognitive, and psychological adaptations to assist with their hunting lifestyle. Wolves are excellent learners that match or outperform domestic dogs. They can use gaze to focus attention on where other wolves are looking. This is important because wolves do not use vocalization when hunting. In laboratory tests they appear to exhibit insight, foresight, understanding, and the ability to plan. {{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} To survive, wolves must be able to solve two problems\u2014finding a prey animal, then confronting it.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n====Tracking====\n[[File:Indian Wolf Photo Dhaval Vargiya.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of a wolf trotting across an arid terrain|An Indian wolf trotting at [[Blackbuck National Park]]]]\n\nWolves move around their territory when hunting, using the same trails for extended periods. After snowfalls, wolves find their old trails and continue using them. These follow the banks of rivers, the shorelines of lakes, through ravines overgrown with shrubs, through plantations, or roads and human paths.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=233}} Wolves are nocturnal predators. During the winter, a pack will commence hunting in the twilight of early evening and will hunt all night, traveling tens of kilometers. Sometimes hunting large prey occurs during the day. During the summer, wolves generally tend to hunt individually, ambushing their prey and rarely giving pursuit.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=240}}\n\nThe wolf usually travels at a loping pace, placing one of its paws directly in front of the other. This gait can be maintained for hours at a rate of {{convert|8|\u2013|9|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=32}} On bare paths, a wolf can quickly achieve speeds of {{convert|50|-|60|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. The wolf has a running gait of {{convert|55|-|70|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, can leap {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} horizontally in a single bound, and can maintain rapid pursuit for at least 20 minutes.<ref name=Nowak1983/> A wolf's foot is large and flexible, which allows it to tread on a wide variety of terrain. A wolf's legs are long compared to their body size allowing them to travel up to {{cvt|76|km|mi}} in 12 hours. This adaptation allows wolves to locate prey within hours, but it can take days to find prey that can be killed without great risk. Moose and deer live singly in the summer. Caribou live in herds of thousands which presents dangers for wolves. Elk live in small herds and these are a safer target.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}}\n\nWolves carry their heads at the same level as their back, raising it only when alert.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} In one study, wolves detected moose using scent 10 times, vision six times, and once by following tracks in the snow. Their vision is as good as that of humans, and they can smell prey at least {{convert|2.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. One wolf travelled to a herd {{convert|103|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. A human can detect the smell of a forest fire over the same distance if it is downwind. The wolf's sense of smell is at least comparable to that of the domestic dog. Both have a sense of smell at least 10,000 times more sensitive than that of humans.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n====Pursuit====\n[[File:Canis lupus pack surrounding Bison.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of an American bison standing its ground surrounded by six wolves in winter|An [[American bison]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]] standing its ground. Bison, elk, and moose will usually stand their ground against a pack of wolves.]]\nWhen hunting large gregarious prey, wolves will try to isolate an individual from its group.<ref name=MacNulty2007/> If successful, a wolf pack can bring down game that will feed it for days, but one error in judgement can lead to serious injury or death. Most large prey have developed defensive adaptations and behaviours. Wolves have been killed while attempting to bring down [[bison]], elk, moose, muskoxen, and even by one of their smallest hoofed prey, the white-tailed deer.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} Although people often believe that wolves can easily overcome any of their prey, their success rate in hunting hoofed prey is usually low.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|p=7}}\n\nGenerally, bison, elk, and moose will stand their ground, then the wolves must struggle with them to bring them down. Often caribou and deer will flee, but sometimes deer also make a stand. With smaller prey like [[beaver]], geese, and hares, there is no risk to the wolf.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} If the targeted animal stands its ground, wolves either ignore it, or try to intimidate it into running.{{snf|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=119\u2013121}} Wolves, or even a wolf on its own, will attempt to frighten a herd into panicking and dispersing.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=241\u2013242}}\n\nWhen wolves encounter prey that flees, they give chase. The speed of sprinting prey is closely related to the speed of their main predators. Wolves can run at {{convert|56|-|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} across several kilometers and will often pursue prey for at least {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}}. One wolf chased a caribou for {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}}, another chased and tracked a deer for {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and one 11-year-old wolf chased and caught an [[Arctic hare]] after seven minutes. Most wolf prey will try to run to water, where they will either escape or be better placed to attempt to ward off the wolves.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n====Disablement====\nThe wolf must give chase and gain on its fleeing prey, slow it down by biting through thick hair and hide, and then disable it enough to begin feeding.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} After chasing and then confronting a large prey animal, the wolf makes use of its {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} fangs and its powerful [[masseter muscle]]s to deliver a [[Bite force quotient|bite force]] of {{convert|28|kg/cm2|lb/in2|abbr=on}}, which is capable of breaking open the skulls of many of its prey animals. The wolf leaps at its quarry and tears at it. One wolf was observed being dragged for dozens of metres attached to the hind leg of a moose; another was seen being dragged over a fallen log while attached to a bull elk's nose.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|p=4}}\n\nThe most common point of wolf attacks on moose is the upper hind legs.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=28\u201345}}<ref name=Peterson2007/><ref name=Buskirk1978/> Hind leg wounds are inflicted from the rear, midway up the [[Hock (anatomy)|hock]] with the canine teeth. These leave gaping skin perforations over {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. Although blood loss, muscle damage, and tendon exposure may occur, there is no evidence of [[hamstringing]]. Attacks also occur on the fleshy nose, the back and sides of the neck, the ears, and the [[perineum]].<ref name=Buskirk1978/> Wolves may wound large prey and then lie around resting for hours before killing it when it is weaker due to blood loss, thereby lessening the risk of injury to themselves.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|p=82\u201389}}\n[[File:Wolves eating deer.jpeg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of two wolves eating a deer carcass at night|Two wolves feeding on a [[white-tailed deer]] kill]]\nWith medium-sized prey, such as roe deer or [[sheep]], wolves kill by biting the throat, severing nerve tracks and the [[carotid artery]], thus causing the animal to die within a few seconds to a minute. With small, [[mouse]]like prey, wolves leap in a high arc and immobilize it with their forepaws.<ref name=Zimen/> When prey is vulnerable and abundant, wolves may occasionally [[Surplus killing|surplus kill]]. Such instances are common with domestic animals, but rare with wild prey. In the wild, surplus killing occurs primarily during late winter or spring, when snow is unusually deep (thus impeding the movements of prey){{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=144}} or during the denning period, when den bound wolves require a ready supply of meat.{{sfn|Lopez|1978|pp=54\u201355}} Medium-sized prey are especially vulnerable to surplus killing, as the swift throat-biting method allows wolves to kill one animal quickly and move on to another.<ref name=Zimen/>\n\n====Feeding====\nOnce prey is brought down, wolves begin to feed excitedly, ripping and tugging at the carcass in all directions, and bolting down large chunks of it.{{sfn|Mech|1981|p=185}} The breeding pair typically monopolizes food to continue producing pups. When food is scarce, this is done at the expense of other family members, especially non-pups.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=58}} The breeding pair typically eats first. They usually work the hardest at killing prey, and may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat undisturbed. Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transports them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs, like the [[heart]], [[liver]], [[lung]]s, and [[stomach]] lining. The [[kidney]]s and [[spleen]] are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscles.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=122\u2013125}} A wolf can eat 15\u201319% of its body weight in a single feeding.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=201}}\n\n== Infections ==\n\n=== Viral and bacterial ===\n[[File:Arctic-Lineage-Canine-Distemper-Virus-as-a-Cause-of-Death-in-Apennine-Wolves-(Canis-lupus)-in-Italy-pone.0082356.s001.ogv|thumb|alt=Footage of a wolf with advanced canine distemper|Footage of a wolf taken from [[Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise|Abruzzo Natural Park]] showing advanced signs of [[canine distemper]]]]\n\n[[Viral disease]]s carried by wolves include: [[rabies]], [[canine distemper]], [[canine parvovirus]], [[infectious canine hepatitis]], [[papillomatosis]], and [[canine coronavirus]].{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=208\u2013211}} Wolves are a major host for rabies in Russia, Iran, [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] and India.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} In wolves, the [[incubation period]] is eight to 21 days, and results in the host becoming agitated, deserting its pack, and travelling up to {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} a day, thus increasing the risk of infecting other wolves. Infected wolves do not show any fear of humans, most documented wolf attacks on people being attributed to rabid animals. Although canine distemper is lethal in dogs, it has not been recorded to kill wolves, except in Canada and Alaska. The canine parvovirus, which causes death by [[dehydration]], [[electrolyte imbalance]], and [[Endotoxin|endotoxic]] shock or [[sepsis]], is largely survivable in wolves, but can be lethal to pups. Wolves may catch infectious canine hepatitis from dogs, though there are no records of wolves dying from it. Papillomatosis has been recorded only once in wolves, and likely does not cause serious illness or death, though it may alter feeding behaviours. The canine coronavirus has been recorded in Alaskan wolves, infections being most prevalent in winter months.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=208\u2013211}}\n\n[[Bacterial diseases]] carried by wolves include: [[brucellosis]], [[Lyme disease]], [[leptospirosis]], [[tularemia]], [[bovine tuberculosis]],{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=211\u2013213}} [[listeriosis]] and [[anthrax]].{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} Wolves can catch ''[[Brucella suis]]'' from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves tend not to show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, it does not appear to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause [[fever]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], vomiting, [[anemia]], [[hematuria]], [[Jaundice|icterus]], and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from [[lagomorph]] prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have killed two wolf pups in Canada.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=211\u2013213}}\n\n=== Parasitic ===\n[[File:Wild Wolf Afflicted with Mange.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a wolf afflicted with sarcoptuc mange eating at a kill|A wolf in the Yellowstone National Park afflicted with [[sarcoptic mange]]]]\n\nWolves carry [[ectoparasite]]s and [[endoparasite]]s; those in the former [[Soviet Union]] have been recorded to carry at least 50 species.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} Most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects, though the effects may become more serious in sick or malnourished specimens.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} [[Parasitic infection]] in wolves is of particular concern to people. Wolves can spread them to dogs, which in turn can carry the parasites to humans. In areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas, the parasites can be spread to livestock.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}}\n\nWolves are often infested with a variety of [[arthropod]] exoparasites, including [[flea]]s, [[tick]]s, [[Louse|lice]], and [[mite]]s. The most harmful to wolves, particularly pups, is the mange mite (''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]''),{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} though they rarely develop full-blown [[mange]], unlike foxes.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} Lice, such as ''[[Trichodectes canis]]'', may cause sickness in wolves, but rarely death. Ticks of the genus ''[[Ixodes]]'' can infect wolves with Lyme disease and [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]].{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} The tick ''[[Dermacentor]] pictus'' also infests wolves. Other ectoparasites include [[Mallophaga|chewing lice]], [[Sucking louse|sucking lice]] and the fleas ''[[Pulex irritans]]'' and ''[[Ctenocephalides canis]]''.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}}\n\nEndoparasites known to infect wolves include: [[protozoan]]s and [[helminth]]s ([[Trematoda|flukes]], [[tapeworm]]s, [[roundworm]]s and [[thorny-headed worm]]s). Of 30,000 protozoan species, only a few have been recorded to infect wolves: ''[[Isospora]]'', ''[[Toxoplasma]]'', ''[[Sarcocystis]]'', ''[[Babesia]]'', and ''[[Giardia]]''.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} Some wolves carry ''[[Neospora caninum]]'', which can be spread to cattle and is correlated with bovine [[miscarriage]]s.<ref name=Dubey2011/> Among flukes, the most common in North American wolves is ''[[Alaria (trematode)|Alaria]]'', which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves. Upon reaching maturity, ''Alaria'' migrates to the wolf's intestine, but does little harm. ''[[Metorchis conjunctus]]'', which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing [[liver disease]], inflammation of the pancreas, and [[emaciation]]. Most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though ''[[Paragonimus westermani]]'' lives in the lungs. Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon. Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host. Symptoms often include [[constipation]], toxic and [[allergic reaction]]s, irritation of the [[intestinal mucosa]], and [[malnutrition]]. Infections by the tapeworm ''[[Echinococcus granulosus]]'' in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed ''Echinoccocus'' eggs in their feces onto grazing areas.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}}\n\nWolves can carry over 30 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host. ''[[Ancylostoma caninum]]'' attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause [[hyperchromic anemia]], emaciation, [[diarrhea]], and possibly death. ''[[Toxocara canis]]'', a [[hookworm]] known to infect wolf pups in the uterus, can cause intestinal irritation, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Wolves may catch ''[[Dioctophyma renale]]'' from [[American mink|mink]]s, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of {{convert|100|cm|abbr=on}}. ''D. renale'' causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected. Wolves can tolerate low levels of ''[[Dirofilaria immitis]]'' for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and [[congestive hepatopathy]]. Wolves probably become infected with ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'' by eating infected ungulates. Although ''T. spiralis'' is not known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause emaciation, salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs. Thorny-headed worms rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in Russian wolves: ''[[Nicolla skrjabini]]'', ''Macrocantorhynchus catulinus'', and ''[[Moniliformis moniliformis]]''.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}}\n\n==Status and conservation==\n{{Further|List of gray wolf populations by country}}\nThe global wolf population in 2003 was estimated at 300,000.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=230}} Wolf population declines have been arrested since the 1970s. This has fostered recolonization and reintroduction in parts of its former range as a result of legal protection, changes in land use, and rural human population shifts to cities. Competition with humans for livestock and game species, concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people, and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the wolf. Despite these threats, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] classifies the wolf as [[Least Concern]] on its [[IUCN Red List|Red List]] due to its relatively widespread range and stable population.

As well as causing economic losses, the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}} Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programs or state insurance.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=309}} Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves, as they have been bred under constant human protection, and are thus unable to defend themselves very well.{{sfn|Mech|1981|p=173}} Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted. In Eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock, while such incidents are rare in North America, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}}\n\nThe majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period, untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=307}} The most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep (Europe), [[Reindeer herding|domestic reindeer]] (northern Scandinavia), [[goat]]s (India), [[horse]]s (Mongolia), [[cattle]] and [[Domestic turkey|turkeys]] (North America).{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}} The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=306}} Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing, though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures.{{sfn|Graves|2007|p=45}}\n\n==== Conflicts with dogs ====\nA review of the studies on the competitive effects of dogs on [[Sympatry|sympatric]] carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves.<ref name=Vanak2014/><ref name=Lescureaux2014 /> Competition would favour the wolf, which is known to kill dogs; however wolves usually live in pairs or in small packs in areas with high human persecution, giving them a disadvantage facing large groups of dogs.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 /><ref name=Boitani1983/>\n\nWolves kill dogs on occasion, and some wolf populations rely on dogs as an important food source. In Croatia, wolves kill more dogs than sheep, and wolves in Russia appear to limit stray dog populations. Wolves may display unusually bold behaviour when attacking dogs accompanied by people, sometimes ignoring nearby humans. Wolf attacks on dogs may occur both in house yards and in forests. Wolf attacks on hunting dogs are considered a major problem in Scandinavia and Wisconsin.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}}<ref name=\"Jess\" /> The most frequently killed hunting breeds in Scandinavia are [[Harrier (dog)|Harrier]]s, older animals being most at risk, likely because they are less timid than younger animals, and react to the presence of wolves differently. Large hunting dogs such as [[J\u00e4mthund|Swedish Elkhound]]s are more likely to survive wolf attacks because of their better ability to defend themselves.<ref name=\"Jess\" />\n\nAlthough the numbers of dogs killed each year by wolves are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to prey on dogs. In many cultures, there are strong bonds between humans and their dogs that can be seen as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses, with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 />\n\nDogs that are employed to guard sheep help to mitigate human\u2013wolf conflicts, and are often proposed as one of the non-lethal tools in the conservation of wolves.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 /><ref name=Shivik2006/> Shepherd dogs are not particularly aggressive, but they can disrupt potential wolf predation by displaying what is to the wolf ambiguous behaviours, such as barking, social greeting, invitation to play or aggression.

The victims are repeatedly bitten on the head and face, and are then dragged off and consumed, unless the wolves are driven off. Such attacks typically occur only locally, and do not stop until the wolves involved are eliminated. Predatory attacks can occur at any time of the year, with a peak in the June\u2013August period, when the chances of people entering forested areas (for livestock [[grazing]] or berry and mushroom picking) increase.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> Cases of non-rabid wolf attacks in winter have been recorded in [[Belarus]], [[Kirov Oblast|Kirov]] and [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk]] oblasts, [[Karelia]] and [[Ukraine]]. Also, wolves with pups experience greater food stresses during this period.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} The majority of victims of predatory wolf attacks are children under the age of 18 and, in the rare cases where adults are killed, the victims are almost always women.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> Indian wolves have a history of preying on children, a phenomenon called \"child-lifting\". They may be taken primarily in the summer period in the evening hours, and often within human settlements.<ref name=\"Rajpurohit1999\"/>\n\nCases of rabid wolves are low when compared to other species, as wolves do not serve as primary reservoirs of the disease, but can be infected by animals such as dogs, jackals and foxes. Incidents of rabies in wolves are very rare in North America, though numerous in the eastern [[Mediterranean]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]]. Wolves apparently develop the \"furious\" phase of rabies to a very high degree. This, coupled with their size and strength, makes rabid wolves perhaps the most dangerous of rabid animals.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> Bites from rabid wolves are 15 times more dangerous than those of rabid dogs.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=267}} Rabid wolves usually act alone, travelling large distances and often biting large numbers of people and domestic animals. Most rabid wolf attacks occur in the spring and autumn periods. Unlike with predatory attacks, the victims of rabid wolves are not eaten, and the attacks generally only occur on a single day. The victims are chosen at random, though most cases involve adult men.

This method relies heavily on the wolf's fear of human scents, though it can lose its effectiveness when wolves become accustomed to the odor. Some hunters can lure wolves by imitating their calls. In [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Mongolia]], wolves are traditionally hunted with eagles and falcons, though this practice is declining, as experienced falconers are becoming few in number. Shooting wolves from aircraft is highly effective, due to increased visibility and direct lines of fire.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=121\u2013140}} Several types of dog, including the Borzoi and [[Taigan|Kyrgyz Tajgan]], have been specifically bred for wolf hunting.<ref name=Lescureaux2014/>\n\n=== As pets and working animals ===\n{{Main|Wolves as pets and working animals}}\nWolves and [[wolf-dog hybrid]]s are sometimes kept as [[exotic pet]]s.

It is the most densely populated of the eleven main urban districts of [[\u0130zmir]], and has historically acted as the administrative and economic core of the city. Situated in an area that roughly corresponds to the geographic center of \u0130zmir, Konak extends for {{convert|11.4|km|0|abbr=off}} along the southern coastline of the [[Gulf of \u0130zmir]]. A long [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] that the district area draws in the direction of the southwest, on the other hand, also covers a large rural area, mostly covered with mountains and forests, and two isolated villages. Konak district area neighbors the district areas of [[Bornova]] to the east, [[Bal\u00e7ova]] to the west and [[Buca]] and [[Gaziemir]] to the south, all of which are also among \u0130zmir's metropolitan districts. Konak center is connected to other districts of \u0130zmir and beyond by a dense network of roads and railroads, as well as by a [[Rapid transit|subway]] line currently being largely extended and by [[ferry]] services to [[Kar\u015f\u0131yaka]]. Konak is a very active hub of industry, trade, commerce and services, with the number of companies exceeding sixty thousand and its exports nearing two billion [[US Dollars]] in 2006.\n\n== Location and administration ==\n[[File:Konak_vapur_iskelesi.jpg|thumb|left|Ferry docked at Konak ferry terminal]]\n[[File:Konak_stairs.jpg|thumb|Colorful set of stairs in Konak's Ak\u0131n Simav neighborhood]]\nThe name \"Konak\" was previously used for \u0130zmir's historic core neighborhood, as well as for its key central square (''[[Konak Square]] \u2013 Konak Meydan\u0131''). For example, [[Kar\u015f\u0131yaka]] along the opposing northern shore did not always consider itself as an integral part of \u0130zmir, or in any case, had marking specificities and points of rivalry.\n\nAdministrative history of Konak started in 1983\u20131984 when the steps towards the constitution of a Metropolitan Municipality of \u0130zmir, itself divided into districts, were taken. In 1987, the territory of former district of central \u0130zmir of was renamed the district of Konak (with the exception of its former dependency of [[Buca]], which was turned into a separate district), and the name \u0130zmir implies the entire metropolitan area since then. The municipality of Konak came into effect in full terms in July 1988.\n\nKonak district area starts at the tip of the [[Gulf of \u0130zmir]] and follows the southern shoreline, covering such prominent neighborhoods of \u0130zmir as, respectively from east to west, [[Alsancak]] with its international freight and passenger port, [[Konak Square]] proper and [[Kemeralt\u0131]] and \u00c7ankaya [[bazaar]] areas and [[K\u00fclt\u00fcrpark]], where [[\u0130zmir International Fair]] is held, immediately behind it, [[Karata\u015f, \u0130zmir|Karata\u015f]], the former Jewish neighborhood marked by [[Asans\u00f6r]] building, and [[G\u00f6ztepe, \u0130zmir|G\u00f6ztepe]], famous for its [[association football|football]] team, among others, further along the coast towards the west, as well as the hillside zone behind these, notably the quarters of [[E\u015frefpa\u015fa]] and [[Hatay, \u0130zmir|Hatay]].\n\nFor both the metropolitan area and [[\u0130zmir Province]] in general, Konak still represents the administrative nerve center, with the governorship, the offices of \u0130zmir Metropolitan Municipality, the commercial areas, and other important administrative and private headquarters being situated within the boundaries of Konak.\n\nThe name ''[[Konak (House)|konak]]'' itself means, inter alia, ''government house'' or ''official residence'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and refers in the case of Konak, \u0130zmir, to the residence built for the governor between 1869\u20131972 at the spot and as a replacement of the mansion of Katipzade, a family of notables who controlled the city and the region between 1750\u20131820. The new building was intended to emphasize the prestige acquired by a growing international trade center and its design and furnishings were consequently luxurious. The building marked the move for the seat of the [[vilayet]] of [[Ayd\u0131n]] to \u0130zmir, initiated in 1865.\n\nIn recent years, there is a move toward decentralization and shift also to other districts of \u0130zmir by official and private headquarters, notably with the building of a new and huge Hall of Justice in [[Bornova]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:KonakSquare IzmirTurkey 1865.jpg|thumb|left|General view of [[Konak Square]] (1865), with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] casern Sar\u0131k\u0131\u015fla (''the Yellow Casern'') and the yet unused landfill in the foreground, and the governor's residence, the square and the ships at the quay in the background]]\nThe core areas of Konak Square and Kemeralt\u0131 were formed with the filling in due course during the 17th century of the shallow inner bay of \u0130zmir and immediate outer coastal reaches. Kemeralt\u0131 bazaar came into existence with the filling between 1650\u20131670 of the shallowest parts of the bay and the process of gaining ground from the sea bay was pursued progressively. The shoreline took its present form by the end of the 18th century in approximate terms, although some of the land along the berth remained unused till the mid-19th century. \nIn 1829, Sar\u0131 K\u0131\u015fla, the Yellow Casern, the principal Ottoman casern of the city, gigantic for its time, was built at immediate sea-side, and a private residence ([[Konak (House)|konak]]) situated slightly diagonally behind the casern was extended and converted into the governor's mansion, demarcating Konak Square that holds its name from the mansion, and which in its turn gave the name to the central metropolitan district of \u0130zmir ([[Konak (District), \u0130zmir|Konak]]), and at the level of which Kemeralt\u0131 is considered to start.\n\nThe Yellow Casern was demolished in 1955 under express instructions from the then [[List of Prime Ministers of Turkey|Prime Minister]] [[Adnan Menderes]], who wanted to see Konak Square re-shaped, to the continuing regret of many Smyrniots who had come to adopt the oversize building as one of the main landmarks of their city. [[Konak Square]] is still where the best symbols of \u0130zmir are found.\n\n== Economy and education ==\nThe number of companies registered in Konak district was 58,199 in 2006. Exports realized by the district's companies reached 1,824,101,418 the same year. 26 banks are present across Konak district area and they provide services through 209 branches. Roughly 304,000 residential buildings make up Konak's settlement. It is notable to observe that, according to the figures provided by the prefecture, residential areas make up only around 10\u201315 per cent of Konak's urban zone, while a huge proportion of 75\u201380 per cent is classified as land being used for commercial and/or industrial purposes.\n\nThe literacy rate is close to hundred per cent, a minimal two per cent ratio of illiteracy accounted for principally by new immigrants to the district. There are 23 students for each teacher, and 2,085 patients for each doctor in Konak. While \u0130zmir's universities mostly have their campuses in other districts of the metropolitan area, these preserve an important presence in Konak through their administrative buildings and depending educational institutions, and some among the higher education establishments of fresher date chose Konak as initial base. Konak is also home to a number of deep-rooted high schools well known across Turkey.\n\nThe rural backlands with sparse settlement among the forests considered apart, Konak urban area may roughly be divided into three zones, official or notional, which differ much between each other in terms of their economy and residential patterns.\n\n{| border=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 75%\" align=right cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"3\" \n|- bgcolor=\"#dddddd\"\n|Konak neighborhoods\n|Explanations \n|- bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"\n|The coastal strait: (''from east to west'') ; <br/> [[Alsancak]], [[Karata\u015f]], [[G\u00f6ztepe, \u0130zmir|G\u00f6ztepe]], [[G\u00fczelyal\u0131, \u0130zmir|G\u00fczelyal\u0131]]; and [[\u00c7ankaya, \u0130zmir|\u00c7ankaya]] and [[K\u00fclt\u00fcrpark]] slightly inland.\n|Rooted and wealthiest neighborhoods, centers for businesses\n|- bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"\n|[[Hatay, \u0130zmir|Hatay]], [[Ye\u015filyurt, \u0130zmir|Ye\u015filyurt]]\n|Newly-grown neighborhoods inland, receiving inward immigration by mid- to high-level income families and students.\n|- bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" \n|[[E\u015frefpa\u015fa]], [[Kadifekale]], [[Tepecik, \u0130zmir|Tepecik]], southern parts of [[Basmane]] train station, [[G\u00fcr\u00e7e\u015fme]], [[Ball\u0131kuyu]], [[G\u00fcltepe]], [[Limontepe]], [[\u0130ki\u00e7e\u015fmelik]] with a concentration of [[Romani people]].\n|Rooted or newly-grown popular neighborhoods with a high concentration of [[slum]]-type residences, receiving inward immigration by low-level income families. \n|}\n\n== Sights of interest ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Main sights==\n\n=== Kadifekale ===\n{{Main|Kadifekale}}\n[[File:Kadifekale IzmirTurkey EUnluBlogspot.jpg|thumb|right|Entry of castle walls in Kadifekale.]]\nKadifekale, originally built at the end of the 4th century BC, is the millenary \"Pagos\" of [[ancient Greek]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times and \"Pagus\" of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] periods of \u0130zmir. The Turkish name Kadifekale literally means ''\"the velvet castle\"'' and is used both for the castle and for the hill on whose summit the castle is situated. The summit is located at a distance of about {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=off}} from the shoreline and commands a general view of a large part of the city of \u0130zmir, as well as of the [[Gulf of \u0130zmir]].\n\n=== Agora of Smyrna ===\n{{Main|Agora of Smyrna}}\n[[File:Izmir021.jpg|thumb|right|Section of the Agora]]\nAs is the case with Pagos [[hilltop castle]] at Kadifekale, the foundation of the second city of Smyrna to replace its [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]] predecessor at what is [[Bayrakl\u0131]] district today, is associated and contemporaneous with [[Alexander the Great]], although the present-day remains date from later periods. In the case of ancient Smyrna, the ruins are centered around the Roman period [[Agora]] of the city, rebuilt after a 178 AD earthquake, although much evidence leads to the conclusion that further research could bring many other vestiges of the antique city to daylight. A new drive in the last decade, once the excavations were placed under the authority of \u0130zmir's Metropolitan Municipal Administration, led to new acquisitions of land around the site of the Agora, incurring considerable expenses and with the objective of enlarging the area to explore.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.arkitera.com/h8284-izmir-agorasi-icin-kamulastirma.html | title = \u0130zmir Agora's\u0131 i\u00e7in kamula\u015ft\u0131rma (''Land acquisitions for the Agora of \u0130zmir'') | author = | publisher = Arkitera|language=Turkish | date = 2006-04-11 }}</ref>\n\nFirst scientific explorations at the Agora of Smyrna were conducted by [[Charles Texier]] in late-1830s and the present state of the site as accessible to visitors is the consequence of the work accomplished between 1931 and 1942 by the archaeologists Rudolf Naumann and [[Sel\u00e2hattin Kantar]].\n\n=== Konak Square and Kemeralt\u0131 (grand bazaar) ===\n{{Main|Konak Square|Kemeralt\u0131}}\nKonak Square is the central point where the structure that became \u0130zmir city's symbol, [[\u0130zmir Clock Tower]], built upon decision of the city council by the [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Levantine]] [[French people|French]] architect [[Raymond Charles P\u00e8re]] on the occasion of Sultan [[Abd\u00fclhamid II]]'s [[silver jubilee]] (1901), is found.\n\nThe tower is in front of \u0130zmir Governor's official residence (''Konak''), an almost identical replica of the original building built between 1869 and 1872, which itself was lost to a fire in 1970. Between the two structures, the tower and the \"konak\", is a very small mosque, a curiosity today and which was formerly annexed by a [[medrese]], which also dates from the time of the Katipzade, having been built around 1755.\n\nThe eastern end of Konak Square is marked by [[Konak Pier]], a 19th-century construction whose steelworks are claimed to have been designed by [[Gustave Eiffel]].

It is the most densely populated of the eleven main urban districts of [[\u0130zmir]], and has historically acted as the administrative and economic core of the city. Situated in an area that roughly corresponds to the geographic center of \u0130zmir, Konak extends for {{convert|11.4|km|0|abbr=off}} along the southern coastline of the [[Gulf of \u0130zmir]]. A long [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] that the district area draws in the direction of the southwest, on the other hand, also covers a large rural area, mostly covered with mountains and forests, and two isolated villages. Konak district area neighbors the district areas of [[Bornova]] to the east, [[Bal\u00e7ova]] to the west and [[Buca]] and [[Gaziemir]] to the south, all of which are also among \u0130zmir's metropolitan districts. Konak center is connected to other districts of \u0130zmir and beyond by a dense network of roads and railroads, as well as by a [[Rapid transit|subway]] line currently being largely extended and by [[ferry]] services to [[Kar\u015f\u0131yaka]]. Konak is a very active hub of industry, trade, commerce and services, with the number of companies exceeding sixty thousand and its exports nearing two billion [[US Dollars]] in 2006.\n\n== Location and administration ==\n[[File:Konak_vapur_iskelesi.jpg|thumb|left|Ferry docked at Konak ferry terminal]]\n[[File:Konak_stairs.jpg|thumb|Colorful set of stairs in Konak's Ak\u0131n Simav neighborhood]]\nThe name \"Konak\" was previously used for \u0130zmir's historic core neighborhood, as well as for its key central square (''[[Konak Square]] \u2013 Konak Meydan\u0131''). For example, [[Kar\u015f\u0131yaka]] along the opposing northern shore did not always consider itself as an integral part of \u0130zmir, or in any case, had marking specificities and points of rivalry.\n\nAdministrative history of Konak started in 1983\u20131984 when the steps towards the constitution of a Metropolitan Municipality of \u0130zmir, itself divided into districts, were taken. In 1987, the territory of former district of central \u0130zmir of was renamed the district of Konak (with the exception of its former dependency of [[Buca]], which was turned into a separate district), and the name \u0130zmir implies the entire metropolitan area since then. The municipality of Konak came into effect in full terms in July 1988.\n\nKonak district area starts at the tip of the [[Gulf of \u0130zmir]] and follows the southern shoreline, covering such prominent neighborhoods of \u0130zmir as, respectively from east to west, [[Alsancak]] with its international freight and passenger port, [[Konak Square]] proper and [[Kemeralt\u0131]] and \u00c7ankaya [[bazaar]] areas and [[K\u00fclt\u00fcrpark]], where [[\u0130zmir International Fair]] is held, immediately behind it, [[Karata\u015f, \u0130zmir|Karata\u015f]], the former Jewish neighborhood marked by [[Asans\u00f6r]] building, and [[G\u00f6ztepe, \u0130zmir|G\u00f6ztepe]], famous for its [[association football|football]] team, among others, further along the coast towards the west, as well as the hillside zone behind these, notably the quarters of [[E\u015frefpa\u015fa]] and [[Hatay, \u0130zmir|Hatay]].\n\nFor both the metropolitan area and [[\u0130zmir Province]] in general, Konak still represents the administrative nerve center, with the governorship, the offices of \u0130zmir Metropolitan Municipality, the commercial areas, and other important administrative and private headquarters being situated within the boundaries of Konak.\n\nThe name ''[[Konak (House)|konak]]'' itself means, inter alia, ''government house'' or ''official residence'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and refers in the case of Konak, \u0130zmir, to the residence built for the governor between 1869\u20131972 at the spot and as a replacement of the mansion of Katipzade, a family of notables who controlled the city and the region between 1750\u20131820. The new building was intended to emphasize the prestige acquired by a growing international trade center and its design and furnishings were consequently luxurious. The building marked the move for the seat of the [[vilayet]] of [[Ayd\u0131n]] to \u0130zmir, initiated in 1865.\n\nIn recent years, there is a move toward decentralization and shift also to other districts of \u0130zmir by official and private headquarters, notably with the building of a new and huge Hall of Justice in [[Bornova]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:KonakSquare IzmirTurkey 1865.jpg|thumb|left|General view of [[Konak Square]] (1865), with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] casern Sar\u0131k\u0131\u015fla (''the Yellow Casern'') and the yet unused landfill in the foreground, and the governor's residence, the square and the ships at the quay in the background]]\nThe core areas of Konak Square and Kemeralt\u0131 were formed with the filling in due course during the 17th century of the shallow inner bay of \u0130zmir and immediate outer coastal reaches. Kemeralt\u0131 bazaar came into existence with the filling between 1650\u20131670 of the shallowest parts of the bay and the process of gaining ground from the sea bay was pursued progressively. The shoreline took its present form by the end of the 18th century in approximate terms, although some of the land along the berth remained unused till the mid-19th century. \nIn 1829, Sar\u0131 K\u0131\u015fla, the Yellow Casern, the principal Ottoman casern of the city, gigantic for its time, was built at immediate sea-side, and a private residence ([[Konak (House)|konak]]) situated slightly diagonally behind the casern was extended and converted into the governor's mansion, demarcating Konak Square that holds its name from the mansion, and which in its turn gave the name to the central metropolitan district of \u0130zmir ([[Konak (District), \u0130zmir|Konak]]), and at the level of which Kemeralt\u0131 is considered to start.\n\nThe Yellow Casern was demolished in 1955 under express instructions from the then [[List of Prime Ministers of Turkey|Prime Minister]] [[Adnan Menderes]], who wanted to see Konak Square re-shaped, to the continuing regret of many Smyrniots who had come to adopt the oversize building as one of the main landmarks of their city. [[Konak Square]] is still where the best symbols of \u0130zmir are found.\n\n== Economy and education ==\nThe number of companies registered in Konak district was 58,199 in 2006. Exports realized by the district's companies reached 1,824,101,418 the same year. 26 banks are present across Konak district area and they provide services through 209 branches. Roughly 304,000 residential buildings make up Konak's settlement. It is notable to observe that, according to the figures provided by the prefecture, residential areas make up only around 10\u201315 per cent of Konak's urban zone, while a huge proportion of 75\u201380 per cent is classified as land being used for commercial and/or industrial purposes.\n\nThe literacy rate is close to hundred per cent, a minimal two per cent ratio of illiteracy accounted for principally by new immigrants to the district. There are 23 students for each teacher, and 2,085 patients for each doctor in Konak. While \u0130zmir's universities mostly have their campuses in other districts of the metropolitan area, these preserve an important presence in Konak through their administrative buildings and depending educational institutions, and some among the higher education establishments of fresher date chose Konak as initial base. Konak is also home to a number of deep-rooted high schools well known across Turkey.\n\nThe rural backlands with sparse settlement among the forests considered apart, Konak urban area may roughly be divided into three zones, official or notional, which differ much between each other in terms of their economy and residential patterns.\n\n{| border=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 75%\" align=right cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"3\" \n|- bgcolor=\"#dddddd\"\n|Konak neighborhoods\n|Explanations \n|- bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"\n|The coastal strait: (''from east to west'') ; <br/> [[Alsancak]], [[Karata\u015f]], [[G\u00f6ztepe, \u0130zmir|G\u00f6ztepe]], [[G\u00fczelyal\u0131, \u0130zmir|G\u00fczelyal\u0131]]; and [[\u00c7ankaya, \u0130zmir|\u00c7ankaya]] and [[K\u00fclt\u00fcrpark]] slightly inland.\n|Rooted and wealthiest neighborhoods, centers for businesses\n|- bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"\n|[[Hatay, \u0130zmir|Hatay]], [[Ye\u015filyurt, \u0130zmir|Ye\u015filyurt]]\n|Newly-grown neighborhoods inland, receiving inward immigration by mid- to high-level income families and students.\n|- bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" \n|[[E\u015frefpa\u015fa]], [[Kadifekale]], [[Tepecik, \u0130zmir|Tepecik]], southern parts of [[Basmane]] train station, [[G\u00fcr\u00e7e\u015fme]], [[Ball\u0131kuyu]], [[G\u00fcltepe]], [[Limontepe]], [[\u0130ki\u00e7e\u015fmelik]] with a concentration of [[Romani people]].\n|Rooted or newly-grown popular neighborhoods with a high concentration of [[slum]]-type residences, receiving inward immigration by low-level income families. \n|}\n\n== Sights of interest ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Main sights==\n\n=== Kadifekale ===\n{{Main|Kadifekale}}\n[[File:Kadifekale IzmirTurkey EUnluBlogspot.jpg|thumb|right|Entry of castle walls in Kadifekale.]]\nKadifekale, originally built at the end of the 4th century BC, is the millenary \"Pagos\" of [[ancient Greek]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times and \"Pagus\" of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] periods of \u0130zmir. The Turkish name Kadifekale literally means ''\"the velvet castle\"'' and is used both for the castle and for the hill on whose summit the castle is situated. The summit is located at a distance of about {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=off}} from the shoreline and commands a general view of a large part of the city of \u0130zmir, as well as of the [[Gulf of \u0130zmir]].\n\n=== Agora of Smyrna ===\n{{Main|Smyrna}}\n[[File:Izmir021.jpg|thumb|right|Section of the Agora]]\nAs is the case with Pagos [[hilltop castle]] at Kadifekale, the foundation of the second city of Smyrna to replace its [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]] predecessor at what is [[Bayrakl\u0131]] district today, is associated and contemporaneous with [[Alexander the Great]], although the present-day remains date from later periods. In the case of ancient Smyrna, the ruins are centered around the Roman period [[Agora]] of the city, rebuilt after a 178 AD earthquake, although much evidence leads to the conclusion that further research could bring many other vestiges of the antique city to daylight. A new drive in the last decade, once the excavations were placed under the authority of \u0130zmir's Metropolitan Municipal Administration, led to new acquisitions of land around the site of the Agora, incurring considerable expenses and with the objective of enlarging the area to explore.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.arkitera.com/h8284-izmir-agorasi-icin-kamulastirma.html | title = \u0130zmir Agora's\u0131 i\u00e7in kamula\u015ft\u0131rma (''Land acquisitions for the Agora of \u0130zmir'') | author = | publisher = Arkitera|language=Turkish | date = 2006-04-11 }}</ref>\n\nFirst scientific explorations at the Agora of Smyrna were conducted by [[Charles Texier]] in late-1830s and the present state of the site as accessible to visitors is the consequence of the work accomplished between 1931 and 1942 by the archaeologists Rudolf Naumann and [[Sel\u00e2hattin Kantar]].\n\n=== Konak Square and Kemeralt\u0131 (grand bazaar) ===\n{{Main|Konak Square|Kemeralt\u0131}}\nKonak Square is the central point where the structure that became \u0130zmir city's symbol, [[\u0130zmir Clock Tower]], built upon decision of the city council by the [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Levantine]] [[French people|French]] architect [[Raymond Charles P\u00e8re]] on the occasion of Sultan [[Abd\u00fclhamid II]]'s [[silver jubilee]] (1901), is found.\n\nThe tower is in front of \u0130zmir Governor's official residence (''Konak''), an almost identical replica of the original building built between 1869 and 1872, which itself was lost to a fire in 1970. Between the two structures, the tower and the \"konak\", is a very small mosque, a curiosity today and which was formerly annexed by a [[medrese]], which also dates from the time of the Katipzade, having been built around 1755.\n\nThe eastern end of Konak Square is marked by [[Konak Pier]], a 19th-century construction whose steelworks are claimed to have been designed by [[Gustave Eiffel]]. The western end is the location of another 19th-century Levantine/European landmark of the city (''see below''), [[List of museums in \u0130zmir|\u0130zmir Ethnography and Archaeology Museum]], originally built as an orphanage.

Access to the games are available as long as the user has an active subscription, and a user must connect to the internet at least once a week to continue to access the titles while offline. Games with multiplayer modes support both local and online play; online play functionality is a first for NES and SNES games.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/nintendo-details-switch-online-service-will-be-20-yea-1795743981 | title = Nintendo Switch's Online Service Will Be $20/Year, Includes Classic Games [UPDATE] | first = Jason | last = Schreier | date = May 1, 2017 | accessdate = May 1, 2017 | website = [[Kotaku]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170602110956/http://kotaku.com/nintendo-details-switch-online-service-will-be-20-yea-1795743981 | archivedate = June 2, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/nintendo-details-switch-online-service-will-be-20-yea-1795743981 | title = Nintendo Switch's Online Service Will Be $20/Year, Includes Classic Games | first = Jason | last = Schreier | date = June 1, 2017 | accessdate = June 2, 2017 | website = [[Kotaku]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170602110956/http://kotaku.com/nintendo-details-switch-online-service-will-be-20-yea-1795743981 | archivedate = June 2, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2017/06/02/no-more-just-one-free-game-you-can-only-play-for-a-month-nintendo-changes-its-online-services-free-game-scheme/ | title = No more just one free game you can only play for a month: Nintendo changes its online service's free game scheme | first = Sharif | last = Saed | date = June 2, 2017 | accessdate = June 2, 2017 | website = [[VG247]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170602120036/http://www.vg247.com/2017/06/02/no-more-just-one-free-game-you-can-only-play-for-a-month-nintendo-changes-its-online-services-free-game-scheme/ | archivedate = June 2, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/17/nintendo-switch-online-nes-games-can-be-played-offline-for-up-to-seven-days | title = Nintendo Switch Online: Nes Games Can Be Played Offline For Up To Seven Days | first = Colin  |last = Stevens | date = September 17, 2018 | accessdate = September 17, 2018 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref>\n\nCertain NES games released on the service between October 2018 to August 2019 also have an alternative version labeled \"SP\" (\"Extra\" in some regions) which either starts the player near the end of the game or starts the game with the maximum amount of items and lives.
