Evans played [[college football]] at the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) and was the MVP of the [[1977 Rose Bowl]] after the [[USC Trojans football|Trojans]]' 14\u20136 victory over [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]].\n\nEvans played professionally for the Bears as well as Chicago's team in the [[United States Football League]], the [[Chicago Blitz]], as well as the USFL's [[Denver Gold]], and the NFL's [[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles/Oakland Raiders]] in a career that spanned nearly 20 years from 1977 to 1995. In 1976, he threw for 1,440 yards with 10 touchdowns and six interceptions.  He completed 53.7% of his passes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/usc/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/2011-footbl-media-guide.pdf |title=The Greatest Tradition In College Football |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nEvans is the only player of the Bears to score a [[List of NFL quarterbacks who have posted a perfect passer rating|perfect quarterback rating]] in a game, doing so against the [[Green Bay Packers]] in 1980, completing 18 of 22 passes for 316 yards and three touchdowns.

Smith High in Greensboro, North Carolina. He is one of six players from that program that went on to play pro football. The list includes former Washington Redskins center [[Jeff Bostic]] and his brother Joe. Current Indianapolis Colts tight end [[Eric Ebron]] Also attended Ben L. Smith.\n\nEvans  enrolled at USC and saw his first action during the 1974 season. While at USC, Evans played for future [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] head coach John McKay, and served as an understudy to [[Pat Haden]], who'd later play in the NFL as a member of the [[Los Angeles Rams]]. In his first season of action, Evans completed six of sixteen passes for one touchdown and one interception. USC finished 10-1 and number two in the AP poll that season. The following season, with Haden graduated and off to the NFL, Evans took over as starter. Despite having the talented Ricky Bell and [[Mosi Tatupu]] in the backfield, the Trojans slipped to 8-4 and finished 8-4 and ranked 17 in the final AP poll that season. Even as a starter, Evans only attempted 35 passes that season, and the Trojans applied more of a ground attack than an air game. In Evans' senior season, John Robinson came aboard to replace McKay, he left USC to coach the expansion team in Tampa Bay. Under Robinson, Evans had his best career season, stat wise. He completed 95 passes on 177 attempts, and for the first time, threw more touchdown passes, ten, versus interceptions, six. His primary target that season was receiver [[Sheldon Diggs]], though Tatupu provided a target out of the backfield as well.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/vince-evans-1.html</ref> USC's fortunes in the AP poll improved as well, as the team finished 11-1, with their only loss being the season opener to Missouri. After that, USC rolled off 11 straight wins, which included a 56-0 blowout of the Iowa Hawkeyes. From there, JSC defeated their Pac-8 opponents and even defeated rival Notre Dame 17-13.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/southern-california/1976-schedule.html</ref> Evans led USC to a 14-6 win over Michigan in the 1977 Rose Bowl. Michigan had raced out to a 6-0 lead thanks to a rushing touchdown by [[Rob Lytle]]. The kick was moissed. Evans led USC down the field later in the second quarter and ran the ball in the end zone himself. The extra point attempt by Glenn Walker was good and the Trojans lead 7-6. Charles White would score a rushing touchdown in the second half to put USC up for good.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/southern-california/1976-schedule.html</ref> \n\n==Pro career==\nIn 1977, the Bears selected Evans in the 6th round of the draft. Evans was the fourth player drafted by the Bears, behind Tackle [[Ted Albrecht]], defensive back Mike Spivey, and tight end [[Robin Earl]].<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/1977_draft.htm</ref> Evans made the team as a back-up behind [[Bob Avellini]]. Evans did not attempt a pass his rookie season. The Bears, under head coach [[Jack Pardee]] went 9-5 and made the play offs. However, they were crushed by the [[Dallas Cowboys]] 37-7.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197712260dal.htm</ref> Evans finally attempted his first NFL pass in 1978, coming off the bench late in a 40-7 blow out loss to the [[San Diego Chargers]]. Both Avellini and [[Mike Phipps]] were ineffective against the Chargers. Evans only complete one of three passes with one interception.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197812040sdg.htm</ref> The following season, under new head coach Neil Armstrong, the Bears went 10-3, with Evans getting a chance as a starter. However, he went 0-3. Avellini lost his starting job to Phipps and Evans was soon promoted ahead of Avellini. In 1980, Evans was a starter for 10 games, going 5-5 during the stretch. One of those games was the infamous thanksgiving game in which the Bears won in overtime when running back Dave Williams returned the opening kick off in overtime 95 yards for a touchdown. It was Evans himself that had tied the game when he scored on a four yard run.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/198011270det.htm</ref> However, the Bears missed the play offs and finished 7-9. In 1981, Evans started all sixteen games. He threw for 2,354 yards, eleven touchdowns and twenty interceptions. When he became the starter, Evans became the first African-American quarterback to start for the Bears in franchise history.<ref>https://www.si.com/nfl/list-first-black-starting-quarterback-every-team</ref> The Bears continued to slump, despite having all-pro [[Walter Payton]] in the backfield. At the end of the season, Armstrong was fired and the Bears hired [[Mike Ditka]].\n\nThe Bears under Ditka restructured the quarterback rotation. Phipps was released, and Evans was a back-up again, this time to [[Jim McMahon]], who the Bears selected in the first round of the 1982 draft. Evans would start three games for the Bears in 1983, going 1-2, but his time in Chicago was over. It was over for the Bears that is. He balked at the idea of sharing the starting role with McMahon and turned down an offer to remain with the Bears. Instead, Evans jumped to the USFL. He signed a contract that was reported in the area of five million a year to sign with the [[Chicago Blitz]]. The contract made Evans one of the highest paid quarterbacks in the league at the time.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/16/sports/sports-people-blitz-signs-evans.html</ref> Evans was signed by the new team owners, as the previous ownership group sold their interest in the team to buy the new franchise in Arizona. In doing so, they took the Blitz head coach, [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]] and the starting quarterback [[Greg Landry]] with them. New ownership named [[Marv Levy]] as the head coach and signed Evans as their starting quarterback.<ref>https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/11/14/Disgruntled-Chicago-Bears-quarterback-Vince-Evans-has-confirmed-he/5500437634000/</ref>\n\nEvans played only one season for the Blitz. In that season, he completed 200 passes on 411 attempts in the wide open offense that featured running back Tim Spencer and former Notre Dame star [[Kris Haines]] at receiver. Once again he threw more interceptions (22) than he did touchdowns (14). The Blitz finished 5\u201313 and in fifth place.<ref>https://www.justsportsstats.com/footballstatsindex.php?year=1984&teamstats=USFLCHI</ref> The next season, with the Blitz folded, Evans joined the [[Denver Gold]]. Again, he threw more interceptions than he did touchdowns. He split time with [[Bob Gagliano]] but the Gold finished with an 11-7 record.<ref>https://www.justsportsstats.com/footballstatsindex.php?year=1985&teamstats=USFLDEN</ref> After that 1985 season, the USFL made their ill-fated decision to abandon spring football and try and play in the fall. Because of this, Evans did not play football in 1986. During this time, Evans sued the former ownership of the Blitz. Evans claimed he was owed money form arbitration that was never paid.<ref>https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/01/01/Former-Chicago-Bears-quarterback-Vince-Evans-is-suing-the/1711536475600/</ref>\n\nIn 1987, the [[Los Angeles Raiders]] where in need of a quarterback. [[Jim Plunkett]] was battling with a shoulder issue, and former first round pick Marc Wilson had failed to live up to lofty expectations. The team also had [[Rusty Hilger]] who they hoped to develop into a starter. Then the NFLPA strike loomed. Evans signed with the Raiders, as did Mark van Allen, a division III quarterback that had been in camp with the raiders. Wilson ended up crossing the picket line. The strike turned out to be Evans' way back in the NFL and it turned out to be his longest lasting tenure with one team in the NFL.<ref>https://raiders.exposure.co/the-replacements</ref> Over the course of the next several season, despite an ever changing cast at quarterback, Evans remained the back-up, serving as much as a coach as he did a back-up. In 1991, he served as a third string quarterback behind [[Jay Schroeder]] and the infamous [[Todd Marinovich]]. In 1992, Evans saw spot duty as the Raiders fell to 7-9 under coach [[Art Shell]]. In 1994, at the age of 38, Evans returned for another season with the Raiders. Schroeder left the Raiders for the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] and Marinovich was cut, with the Raiders tired of his lack to develop as a player. The Raiders turned to [[Jeff Hostetler]] who a few seasons prior had led the New York Giants to the Super Bowl. This play off run ended the same way it did a few years earlier, with a loss to the [[Buffalo Bills]]. In 1994, at the age of 39, Evans re-signed with the Raiders to serve as their back up. He even got into a couple of games as well. Briefly substituting for Hostetler, Evans complete all two of his passes, including a touchdown pass to Rocket Ismail in the Raiders 24-17 win over the Chargers. the significance of the touchdown pass was that meant that Evans had thrown a touchdown pass in three different decades in the NFL. In 1995, the Raiders returned to the city of Oakland, and they brought Vince Evans with them. Art Shell was fired and Mike White was named head coach. Hostetler was still the starter but the Raiders drafted [[Billy Joe Hobert]] out of the university of Washington to be the quarterback of the future. 1995 would be Evans' final year as an active player. Despite being 40 years old, Evans made three starts for the raiders, going 1-2 during that span. In his first start that season, he led the Raiders to a 30-17 win over the [[Indianapolis Colts]], a team quarterbacked by [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199510220rai.htm</ref> His next start came on the road against the San Diego Chargers. In a game the featured zero touchdowns by either team, Evans threw three interceptions, all to Chargers defensive back Dwayne Harper as the Raiders lost 12-6.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199511270sdg.htm</ref> Evans was the starter the next week against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. He went 23 of 37 with two interceptions before he was relieved by Hobert. It would be the last start of Evans' career, and the Raiders lost 29-23 to fall to 8-5.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199512030rai.htm</ref> Evans made a brief appearance the following week in the Raiders 31-28 loss to the [[Denver Broncos]].<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199512240rai.htm</ref>\n\n==Bears score 61 against Green Bay==\nThe Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears is one of the longest rivalries in the NFL. Vince Evans was on the right side of the most lop-sided Bears/Packers game of all-time. The date was December 7, 1980. This was the second meeting between the Bears and Packers that season. In the first match-up, the Packers won in overtime when packers placekicker [[Chester Marcol]] advanced a blocked field goal 25 yards for a touchdown. The rematch started off slow, until Walter Payton scored three times in the second quarter to give the Bears a halftime lead. Evans himself accounted for three touchdown passes. The Green Bay fanbase was upset that after Payton and many of the starters were pulling in the second half, Payton re-entered the game to score a rushing touchdown to make it 55-7. While Evans had one of his best games as a pro, the significance of the outcome was that the bears had failed to score a single touchdown in the three previous meetings against the Packers.<ref>https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2015/12/7/18609907/35-years-ago-today-bears-beat-packers-in-most-lopsided-game-in-series-history</ref>\n\n==Post NFL career==\nEvans later admitted he let his ego get in the way when he bolted the NFL for the USFL. Jim McMahon ended up getting injured during his rookie season, which means Evans would have gotten more playing time. After the USFL folded, Evans figured his resume would get him a look from teams in the NFL. It didn't and the only door that opened was when the players went on strike and owners decided to continue the season with replacement players. Evans was one of a few that was kept by the Raiders after the strike ended. Though he admitted that playing in the USFL was a mistake, he felt proud that he was firm in playing quarterback in the NFL, though he felt more pressure as an African-American playing quarterback in the NFL.

Evans played [[college football]] at the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) and was the MVP of the [[1977 Rose Bowl]] after the [[USC Trojans football|Trojans]]' 14\u20136 victory over [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]].\n\nEvans played professionally for the Bears as well as Chicago's team in the [[United States Football League]], the [[Chicago Blitz]], as well as the USFL's [[Denver Gold]], and the NFL's [[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles/Oakland Raiders]] in a career that spanned nearly 20 years from 1977 to 1995. In 1976, he threw for 1,440 yards with 10 touchdowns and six interceptions.  He completed 53.7% of his passes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/usc/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/2011-footbl-media-guide.pdf |title=The Greatest Tradition In College Football |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nEvans is the only player of the Bears to score a [[List of NFL quarterbacks who have posted a perfect passer rating|perfect quarterback rating]] in a game, doing so against the [[Green Bay Packers]] in 1980, completing 18 of 22 passes for 316 yards and three touchdowns.

Smith High in Greensboro, North Carolina. He is one of six players from that program that went on to play pro football. The list includes former Washington Redskins center [[Jeff Bostic]] and his brother Joe. Current Indianapolis Colts tight end [[Eric Ebron]] Also attended Ben L. Smith.\n\nEvans  enrolled at USC and saw his first action during the 1974 season. While at USC, Evans played for future [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] head coach John McKay, and served as an understudy to [[Pat Haden]], who'd later play in the NFL as a member of the [[Los Angeles Rams]]. In his first season of action, Evans completed six of sixteen passes for one touchdown and one interception. USC finished 10-1 and number two in the AP poll that season. The following season, with Haden graduated and off to the NFL, Evans took over as starter. Despite having the talented Ricky Bell and [[Mosi Tatupu]] in the backfield, the Trojans slipped to 8-4 and finished 8-4 and ranked 17 in the final AP poll that season. Even as a starter, Evans only attempted 35 passes that season, and the Trojans applied more of a ground attack than an air game. In Evans' senior season, John Robinson came aboard to replace McKay, he left USC to coach the expansion team in Tampa Bay. Under Robinson, Evans had his best career season, stat wise. He completed 95 passes on 177 attempts, and for the first time, threw more touchdown passes, ten, versus interceptions, six. His primary target that season was receiver [[Sheldon Diggs]], though Tatupu provided a target out of the backfield as well.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/vince-evans-1.html</ref> USC's fortunes in the AP poll improved as well, as the team finished 11-1, with their only loss being the season opener to Missouri. After that, USC rolled off 11 straight wins, which included a 56-0 blowout of the Iowa Hawkeyes. From there, JSC defeated their Pac-8 opponents and even defeated rival Notre Dame 17-13.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/southern-california/1976-schedule.html</ref> Evans led USC to a 14-6 win over Michigan in the 1977 Rose Bowl. Michigan had raced out to a 6-0 lead thanks to a rushing touchdown by [[Rob Lytle]]. The kick was moissed. Evans led USC down the field later in the second quarter and ran the ball in the end zone himself. The extra point attempt by Glenn Walker was good and the Trojans lead 7-6. Charles White would score a rushing touchdown in the second half to put USC up for good.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/southern-california/1976-schedule.html</ref> \n\n==Pro career==\nIn 1977, the Bears selected Evans in the 6th round of the draft. Evans was the fourth player drafted by the Bears, behind Tackle [[Ted Albrecht]], defensive back Mike Spivey, and tight end [[Robin Earl]].<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/1977_draft.htm</ref> Evans made the team as a back-up behind [[Bob Avellini]]. Evans did not attempt a pass his rookie season. The Bears, under head coach [[Jack Pardee]] went 9-5 and made the play offs. However, they were crushed by the [[Dallas Cowboys]] 37-7.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197712260dal.htm</ref> Evans finally attempted his first NFL pass in 1978, coming off the bench late in a 40-7 blow out loss to the [[San Diego Chargers]]. Both Avellini and [[Mike Phipps]] were ineffective against the Chargers. Evans only complete one of three passes with one interception.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197812040sdg.htm</ref> The following season, under new head coach Neil Armstrong, the Bears went 10-3, with Evans getting a chance as a starter. However, he went 0-3. Avellini lost his starting job to Phipps and Evans was soon promoted ahead of Avellini. In 1980, Evans was a starter for 10 games, going 5-5 during the stretch. One of those games was the infamous thanksgiving game in which the Bears won in overtime when running back Dave Williams returned the opening kick off in overtime 95 yards for a touchdown. It was Evans himself that had tied the game when he scored on a four yard run.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/198011270det.htm</ref> However, the Bears missed the play offs and finished 7-9. In 1981, Evans started all sixteen games. He threw for 2,354 yards, eleven touchdowns and twenty interceptions. When he became the starter, Evans became the first African-American quarterback to start for the Bears in franchise history.<ref>https://www.si.com/nfl/list-first-black-starting-quarterback-every-team</ref> The Bears continued to slump, despite having all-pro [[Walter Payton]] in the backfield. At the end of the season, Armstrong was fired and the Bears hired [[Mike Ditka]].\n\nThe Bears under Ditka restructured the quarterback rotation. Phipps was released, and Evans was a back-up again, this time to [[Jim McMahon]], who the Bears selected in the first round of the 1982 draft. Evans would start three games for the Bears in 1983, going 1-2, but his time in Chicago was over. It was over for the Bears that is. He balked at the idea of sharing the starting role with McMahon and turned down an offer to remain with the Bears. Instead, Evans jumped to the USFL. He signed a contract that was reported in the area of five million a year to sign with the [[Chicago Blitz]]. The contract made Evans one of the highest paid quarterbacks in the league at the time.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/16/sports/sports-people-blitz-signs-evans.html</ref> Evans was signed by the new team owners, as the previous ownership group sold their interest in the team to buy the new franchise in Arizona. In doing so, they took the Blitz head coach, [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]] and the starting quarterback [[Greg Landry]] with them. New ownership named [[Marv Levy]] as the head coach and signed Evans as their starting quarterback.<ref>https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/11/14/Disgruntled-Chicago-Bears-quarterback-Vince-Evans-has-confirmed-he/5500437634000/</ref>\n\nEvans played only one season for the Blitz. In that season, he completed 200 passes on 411 attempts in the wide open offense that featured running back Tim Spencer and former Notre Dame star [[Kris Haines]] at receiver. Once again he threw more interceptions (22) than he did touchdowns (14). The Blitz finished 5\u201313 and in fifth place.<ref>https://www.justsportsstats.com/footballstatsindex.php?year=1984&teamstats=USFLCHI</ref> The next season, with the Blitz folded, Evans joined the [[Denver Gold]]. Again, he threw more interceptions than he did touchdowns. He split time with [[Bob Gagliano]] but the Gold finished with an 11-7 record.<ref>https://www.justsportsstats.com/footballstatsindex.php?year=1985&teamstats=USFLDEN</ref> After that 1985 season, the USFL made their ill-fated decision to abandon spring football and try and play in the fall. Because of this, Evans did not play football in 1986. During this time, Evans sued the former ownership of the Blitz. Evans claimed he was owed money form arbitration that was never paid.<ref>https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/01/01/Former-Chicago-Bears-quarterback-Vince-Evans-is-suing-the/1711536475600/</ref>\n\nIn 1987, the [[Los Angeles Raiders]] where in need of a quarterback. [[Jim Plunkett]] was battling with a shoulder issue, and former first round pick Marc Wilson had failed to live up to lofty expectations. The team also had [[Rusty Hilger]] who they hoped to develop into a starter. Then the NFLPA strike loomed. Evans signed with the Raiders, as did Mark van Allen, a division III quarterback that had been in camp with the raiders. Wilson ended up crossing the picket line. The strike turned out to be Evans' way back in the NFL and it turned out to be his longest lasting tenure with one team in the NFL.<ref>https://raiders.exposure.co/the-replacements</ref> Over the course of the next several season, despite an ever changing cast at quarterback, Evans remained the back-up, serving as much as a coach as he did a back-up. In 1991, he served as a third string quarterback behind [[Jay Schroeder]] and the infamous [[Todd Marinovich]]. In 1992, Evans saw spot duty as the Raiders fell to 7-9 under coach [[Art Shell]]. In 1994, at the age of 38, Evans returned for another season with the Raiders. Schroeder left the Raiders for the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] and Marinovich was cut, with the Raiders tired of his lack to develop as a player. The Raiders turned to [[Jeff Hostetler]] who a few seasons prior had led the New York Giants to the Super Bowl. This play off run ended the same way it did a few years earlier, with a loss to the [[Buffalo Bills]]. In 1994, at the age of 39, Evans re-signed with the Raiders to serve as their back up. He even got into a couple of games as well. Briefly substituting for Hostetler, Evans complete all two of his passes, including a touchdown pass to Rocket Ismail in the Raiders 24-17 win over the Chargers. the significance of the touchdown pass was that meant that Evans had thrown a touchdown pass in three different decades in the NFL. In 1995, the Raiders returned to the city of Oakland, and they brought Vince Evans with them. Art Shell was fired and Mike White was named head coach. Hostetler was still the starter but the Raiders drafted [[Billy Joe Hobert]] out of the university of Washington to be the quarterback of the future. 1995 would be Evans' final year as an active player. Despite being 40 years old, Evans made three starts for the raiders, going 1-2 during that span. In his first start that season, he led the Raiders to a 30-17 win over the [[Indianapolis Colts]], a team quarterbacked by [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199510220rai.htm</ref> His next start came on the road against the San Diego Chargers. In a game the featured zero touchdowns by either team, Evans threw three interceptions, all to Chargers defensive back Dwayne Harper as the Raiders lost 12-6.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199511270sdg.htm</ref> Evans was the starter the next week against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. He went 23 of 37 with two interceptions before he was relieved by Hobert. It would be the last start of Evans' career, and the Raiders lost 29-23 to fall to 8-5.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199512030rai.htm</ref> Evans made a brief appearance the following week in the Raiders 31-28 loss to the [[Denver Broncos]].<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199512240rai.htm</ref>\n\n==Bears score 61 against Green Bay==\nThe Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears is one of the longest rivalries in the NFL. Vince Evans was on the right side of the most lop-sided Bears/Packers game of all-time. The date was December 7, 1980. This was the second meeting between the Bears and Packers that season. In the first match-up, the Packers won in overtime when packers placekicker [[Chester Macrol]] advanced a blocked field goal 25 yards for a touchdown. The rematch started off slow, until Walter Payton scored three times in the second quarter to give the Bears a halftime lead. Evans himself accounted for three touchdown passes. The Green Bay fanbase was upset that after Payton and many of the starters were pulling in the second half, Payton re-entered the game to score a rushing touchdown to make it 55-7. While Evans had one of his best games as a pro, the significance of the outcome was that the bears had failed to score a single touchdown in the three previous meetings against the Packers.<ref>https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2015/12/7/18609907/35-years-ago-today-bears-beat-packers-in-most-lopsided-game-in-series-history</ref>\n\n==Post NFL career==\nEvans later admitted he let his ego get in the way when he bolted the NFL for the USFL. Jim McMahon ended up getting injured during his rookie season, which means Evans would have gotten more playing time. After the USFL folded, Evans figured his resume would get him a look from teams in the NFL. It didn't and the only door that opened was when the players went on strike and owners decided to continue the season with replacement players. Evans was one of a few that was kept by the Raiders after the strike ended. Though he admitted that playing in the USFL was a mistake, he felt proud that he was firm in playing quarterback in the NFL, though he felt more pressure as an African-American playing quarterback in the NFL. He was happy to see Doug Williams become the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. After leaving football, Evans built a successful real estate career in Southern California.<ref>https://theundefeated.com/features/usc-bears-nfl-vince-evans-black-quarterback/</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Racial issues faced by black quarterbacks]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{USC Trojans quarterback navbox}}\n{{Bears1977DraftPicks}}\n{{Chicago Bears starting quarterback navbox}}\n{{Oakland Raiders starting quarterback navbox}}\n{{NFL quarterbacks with a perfect passer rating}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Evans, Vince}}\n[[Category:1955 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American football quarterbacks]]\n[[Category:Chicago Bears players]]\n[[Category:Chicago Blitz players]]\n[[Category:Denver Gold players]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles City Cubs football players]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Raiders players]]\n[[Category:National Football League replacement players]]\n[[Category:Oakland Raiders players]]\n[[Category:USC Trojans football players]]\n[[Category:African-American players of American football]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Greensboro, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Players of American football from North Carolina]]\n", "name_user": "MrHaroldG2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBears score 61 against Green Bay", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Evans"}

Thus we define a social movement as a form of political association between persons who have at least a minimal sense of themselves as connected to others in common purpose and who come together across an extended period of time to effect social change in the name of that purpose.<ref>{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= van Seeters | first2= Paul | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 2: Global Social Movements and Global Civil Society | url= https://www.academia.edu/7305007 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London |page=xi}}</ref>}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginning===\n[[File:William Hogarth - John Wilkes, Esq.png|thumb|150px|upright|Satirical engraving of Wilkes by [[William Hogarth]].

As a result of this, Wilkes became a figurehead to the growing movement for popular sovereignty among the middle classes - people began chanting \"Wilkes and Liberty\" in the streets.\n\nAfter a later period of exile brought about by further charges of libel and [[obscenity]], Wilkes stood for the Parliamentary seat at [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex]], where most of his support was located.{{Sfn|Cash|2006|pp=204\u201326}} When Wilkes was imprisoned in the [[King's Bench Prison]] on 10 May 1768, a mass movement of support emerged, with large demonstrations in the streets under the slogan \"No liberty, no King.\"{{Sfn|Cash|2006|pp=216\u201326}}\n\nStripped of the right to sit in Parliament, Wilkes became an [[Alderman]] of [[City of London|London]] in 1769, and an activist group called the ''Society for the Supporters of the Bill of Rights'' began aggressively promoting his policies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyhome.co.uk/c-eight/18reform/ssbr.htm|title=The Society for the Supporters of the Bill of Rights (SSBR)|website=www.historyhome.co.uk}}</ref> This was the first ever sustained social movement: it involved public meetings, demonstrations, the distribution of pamphlets on an unprecedented scale and the mass petition march.

The term \"social movements\" was introduced in 1848 by the German Sociologist [[Lorenz von Stein]] in his book ''Socialist and Communist Movements since the Third French Revolution (1848)'' in which he introduced the term \"social movement\" into scholarly discussions<ref>Tilly, 2004, p.5</ref> - actually depicting in this way [[political movement]]s fighting for the social rights understood as [[welfare rights]].\n\n[[Image:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] was a leader in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], one of the most famous social movements of the 20th century.]]\nThe [[labor movement]] and [[socialist movement]] of the late 19th century are seen as the prototypical social movements, leading to the formation of [[communism|communist]] and [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties and organisations.

Some find in the end of the 1990s the emergence of a new global social movement, the [[anti-globalization movement]]. Some social movement scholars posit that with the rapid pace of globalization, the potential for the emergence of new ''type'' of social movement is latent\u2014they make the analogy to national movements of the past to describe what has been termed a [[global citizens movement]].\n\n===Key processes===\nSeveral key processes lie behind the history of social movements. [[Urbanization]] led to larger settlements, where people of similar goals could find each other, gather and organize. This facilitated [[social interaction]] between scores of people, and it was in urban areas that those early social movements first appeared. Similarly, the process of industrialization which gathered large masses of workers in the same region explains why many of those early social movements addressed matters such as economic wellbeing, important to the [[worker class]]. Many other social movements were created at [[university|universities]], where the process of [[mass education]] brought many people together. With the development of [[communication]] technologies, creation and activities of social movements became easier \u2013 from printed pamphlets circulating in the 18th century [[coffeehouse]]s to [[newspaper]]s and [[Internet]], all those tools became important factors in the growth of the social movements. Finally, the spread of [[democracy]] and [[political rights]] like the [[freedom of speech]] made the creation and functioning of social movements much easier.\n\n== Mass mobilization ==\nNascent social movements often fail to achieve their objectives because they fail to mobilize sufficient numbers of people. Srdja Popovic, author of Blueprint for Revolution,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Blueprint for revolution : how to use rice pudding, Lego men, and other nonviolent techniques to galvanize communities, overthrow dictators, or simply change the world|author=Popovic, Srdja|others=Miller, Matthew I., 1979-|isbn=9780812995305|edition=First|location=New York|oclc=878500820|year = 2015}}</ref> and spokesperson for [[Otpor!|OTPOR!]], says that movements succeed when they address issues that people actually care about. \u201cIt\u2019s unrealistic to expect people to care about more than what they already care about, and any attempt to make them do so is bound to fail.\u201d Activists too often make the mistake of trying to convince people to address their issues. A mobilization strategy aimed at large-scale change often begins with action a small issue that concerns many people. For instance, [[Mahatma Gandhi]]\u2019s successful overthrow of British rule in India began as a small protest focused on the British tax on salt.\n\nPopovic also argues that a social movement has little chance of growing if it relies on boring speeches and the usual placard waving marches. He argues for creating movements that people actually want to join. OTPOR! succeeded because it was fun, funny, and invented graphic ways of ridiculing dictator [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107|Slobodan Milosevic]]. It turned fatalism and passivity into action by making it easy, even cool, to become a revolutionary; branding itself within hip slogans, rock music and street theatre.

''The Peyote Religion among the Navaho''. Chicago: Aldine. {{ISBN|0-8061-2382-6}}</ref>]]\n\nSociologists distinguish between several types of social movement:\n* Scope:\n** [[reform movement]] - movements advocating changing some [[norm (sociology)|norms]] or [[law]]s. Examples of such a movement would include a [[trade union]] with a goal of increasing [[workers rights]], a [[green movement]] advocating a set of [[ecology|ecological]] laws, or a movement supporting introduction of a [[capital punishment]] or the right to [[abortion]]. Some reform movements may aim for a change in custom and moral norms, such as condemnation of [[pornography]] or proliferation of some [[religion]].\n** radical movement - movements dedicated to changing [[value system]]s in a fundamental way. Examples would include the [[Civil Rights Movement]] which demanded full [[civil rights]] and equality under the law to all Americans, regardless of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]; the [[Poland|Polish]] [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] (''Solidarno\u015b\u0107'') movement which demanded the transformation of a [[Stalinist]] political and [[economic system]] into a [[democracy]]; or the [[South Africa]]n [[shack dweller]]s' movement [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] which demands the full inclusion of shack dwellers into the life of cities.\n* Type of change:\n** innovation movement - movements which want to introduce or change particular norms, values, etc. The [[singularitarianism]] movement advocating deliberate action to effect and ensure the safety of the [[technological singularity]] is an example of an innovation movement.\n** conservative movement - movements which want to preserve existing norms, values, etc. For example, the anti-technology 19th century [[Luddite]]s movement or the modern movement opposing the spread of the [[genetically modified food]] could be seen as conservative movements in that they aimed to fight specific technological changes.\n* Targets:\n** group-focus movements - focused on affecting groups or society in general, for example, advocating the change of the political system. Some of these groups transform into or join a [[political party]], but many remain outside the reformist party political system.\n** individual-focused movements - focused on affecting individuals. Most [[religious movement]]s would fall under this category.\n* Methods of work:\n** peaceful movements - various movements which use [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] means of protest as part of a campaign of [[nonviolent resistance]], also often called [[civil resistance]]. The American Civil Rights Movement, Polish Solidarity movement or the [[nonviolent]], [[civil disobedience]]-orientated wing of the [[Indian independence movement]] would fall into this category.<ref>[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Roberts, Adam]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), [http://www.oup.com/uk/catalogue/?ci=9780199552016 ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present''] {{webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20141115183530/http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199552016.do |date=2014-11-15 }}, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-19-955201-6}}, contains chapters on these and many other social movements using non-violent methods.[https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&source=gbs_navlinks_s]</ref>\n** violent movements - various movements<ref>Seferiades, S., & Johnston, H. (Eds.). (2012). ''Violent protest, contentious politics, and the neoliberal state''. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd..</ref> which resort to violence; they are usually armed and in extreme cases can take a form of a [[paramilitary]] or [[terrorist]] organization. Examples: the [[Rote Armee Fraktion]], [[Al-Qaida]].\n* Old and new:\n** old movements - movements for change have existed for many centuries. Most of the oldest recognized movements, dating to late 18th and 19th centuries, fought for specific social groups, such as the working class, peasants, whites, aristocrats, Protestants, men. They were usually centered around some [[materialism|materialistic]] goals like improving the [[standard of living]] or, for example, the political autonomy of the working class.\n** [[new social movements|new movements]] - movements which became dominant from the second half of the 20th century. Notable examples include the [[civil rights movement|American civil rights movement]], [[second-wave feminism]], [[gay rights movement]], [[environmental movement|environmentalism and conservation efforts]], [[Mass surveillance|opposition to mass surveillance]], etc. They are usually centered around issues that go beyond but are not separate from class.\n* Range:\n** global movements - social movements with global ([[International organization|transnational]]) objectives and goals. Movements such as the [[International Workingmen's Association|first]] (where Marx and Bakunin met), [[Second International|second]], [[Comintern|third]] and [[fourth international]]s, the [[World Social Forum]], the [[Peoples' Global Action]] and the [[anarchism|anarchist movement]] seek to change society at a global level.\n** local movements - most of the social movements have a local scope.<ref>Snow, David A., Sarah Anne Soule, Hanspeter Kriesi. ''The Blackwell companion to social movements''.

Unless there is a single leader who does, or a formal system of membership agreements, activists will typically use diverse labels and descriptive phrases that require scholars to discern when they are referring to the same or similar ideas, declare similar goals, adopt similar programs of action, and use similar methods. There can be great differences in the way that is done, to recognize who is and who is not a member or an allied group{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}:\n\n* Insiders: Often exaggerate the level of support by considering people supporters whose level of activity or support is weak, but also reject those that outsiders might consider supporters because they discredit the cause, or are even seen as adversaries{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n* Outsiders: Those not supporters who may tend to either underestimate or overestimate the level or support or activity of elements of a movement, by including or excluding those that insiders would exclude or include.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIt is often outsiders rather than insiders that apply the identifying labels for a movement, which the insiders then may or may not adopt and use to self-identify. For example, the label for the [[levellers]] [[political movement]] in 17th-century England was applied to them by their antagonists, as a [[term of disparagement]]. Yet admirers of the movement and its aims later came to use the term, and it is the term by which they are known to history.\n\nCaution must always be exercised in any discussion of amorphous phenomena such as movements to distinguish between the views of insiders and outsiders, supporters and antagonists, each of whom may have their own purposes and agendas in [[characterization]] or mischaracterization of it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Dynamics of social movements==\n[[Image:Stages of social movements.svg|right|thumb|400px|Stages of social movements.<ref>Graph based on Blumer, Herbert G. 1969. \"Collective Behavior.\" In Alfred McClung Lee, ed., ''Principles of Sociology''.

''From Mobilization to Revolution''. Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley, 1978.</ref>]]\n\nSocial movements have a life cycle: they are created, they grow, they achieve successes or failures and eventually, they dissolve and cease to exist.\n\nThey are more likely to evolve in the time and place which is friendly{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} to the social movements: hence their evident symbiosis with the 19th century proliferation of ideas like individual rights, freedom of speech and civil disobedience. Social movements occur in liberal and authoritarian societies but in different forms. These new movements are activated by a wish for change in social customs, ethics and values which oppress certain communities. The birth of a social movement needs what sociologist [[Neil Smelser]] calls an ''initiating event'': a particular, individual event that will begin a [[chain reaction]] of events in the given society leading to the creation of a social movement. The root of this event must be the result of some common discontent among a community. Hence, making ''emergence'' the first step to a social movement. This discontent will act as the chain that links common people together, as they share the same experiences and feelings of oppression. \"Within this stage, social movements are very preliminary and there is little to no organization. Instead this stage can be thought of as widespread discontent (Macionis, 2001; Hopper, 1950).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hopper|first=R. D.|date=1950-03-01|title=The Revolutionary Process: A Frame of Reference for the Study of Revolutionary Movements|journal=Social Forces|volume=28|issue=3|pages=270\u2013279|doi=10.2307/2572010|issn=0037-7732|jstor=2572010}}</ref>\" Emergence is prior to any sort of organized resistance to the condition of society. Jonathan Christiansen's essay on the four stages of social movement dissects further into the historical sociology of how each stage affects the whole movement. The Civil Rights Movement's early stages are an example of the public display of protest that is utilized to push a movement into the next stages. \"It was not until after the Brown v. the Board of Education Supreme court decision (1954), which outlawed segregation in Public schools, and following the arrest of Rosa Parks in Montgomery, Alabama for refusing to comply with segregation laws on city buses by giving up her bus seat to a white man, that the American Civil Rights Movement would proceed to the next stage \u2013 coalescence.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebscohost.com/uploads/imported/thisTopic-dbTopic-1248.pdf|title=Four Stages of Social Movement|last=Christiansen|first=Jonathan|date=2009}}</ref> The impact of a black woman, [[Rosa Parks]], riding in the whites-only section of the bus (although she was not acting alone or spontaneously\u2014typically activist leaders lay the groundwork behind the scenes of interventions designed to spark a movement).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/local/blogs/moonblog/2015/11/29/bus-boycott-took-planning-smarts/76456904/|title=Bus Boycott took planning, smarts|website=The Montgomery Advertiser|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> This leads into coalesce because now the common dilemma and source of oppression is being pinned down, allowing for organizations and appearance to the public eye to be established. The Polish Solidarity movement, which eventually [[Revolutions of 1989|toppled the communist regimes of Eastern Europe]], developed after trade union activist [[Anna Walentynowicz]] was fired from work. The South African shack dwellers' movement [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] grew out of a road blockade in response to the sudden selling off of a small piece of land promised for housing to a developer. Such an event is also described as a ''volcanic model'' \u2013 a social movement is often created after a large number of people realize that there are others sharing the same value and desire for a particular social change.\n\nThis third stage, bureaucratization, is when movements must become more organized, centered around a more systematic model. The set up and system for going about the construct must be more formal, with people taking on specific roles and responsibilities. \"In this phase their political power is greater than in the previous stages in that they may have more regular access to political elites.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> In this stage, one organization may take over another one in order to obtain a greater status and formal alliance. This 'taking over' may be a positive or negative move for organizations. Ella Baker, an activist who played a role in the NAACP,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naacp.org/|title=NAACP {{!}} Home|website=NAACP|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> had proposed to the students of the student movement to start their own organization. This becomes known as the SNCC, the student nonviolent coordinating committee (1960s). The students could have join forces with the SCLC,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/southern-christian-leadership-conference-sclc|title=Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)|last=University|first=\u00a9 Stanford|last2=Stanford|date=2017-07-07|website=The Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03|last3=California 94305}}</ref> an already existing organization, but that would have been a poor bureaucratizing decision, as they would succumb to old ideologies. New and progressive ideas that challenge prior authority are crucial to social change.\n\nThe declining of a social movement does not necessarily mean failure. There are multiple routes in which a movement may take before proceeding into decline. Success of a movement would result in permanent changes within the society and/or government that would result in a loss of need for protest. Failure is often the result of the incapability to keep a common focus, and work towards the goal in mind.  \"Failure of social movements due to organizational or strategic failings is common for many organizations.<ref>{{Citation|chapter=Contents|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=9780812203653|doi=10.9783/9780812203653.toc|title=American Patriotism, American Protest|year=2011}}</ref>\" Such a route would result in the gradual breaking up of an organization, and out of the stages of movement. Co-optation results when people or groups are integrated and shift away from the social movement's initial concerns and values. Repression is another example, when the movement is slowly wiped away from the public platform through means of an outside force, usually being the government. The last route into declining is going mainstream, which is generally perceived as an overall success. This is when goals of the movement are taken into society as a part of daily life, making it a 'social norm.' For example, birth control is still a greatly debated topic on a government level, but it has been accepted into social life as a common thing that exists.\n\nIt is important to recognize that though movements may disintegrate and cease to be active, the impact that they have in the social realm is success in its own way. It sparks the notion in new generations that the possibility to organize and make change is there.\n\n==Social movement theories==\n{{Main|Social movement theory}}\nSociologists have developed several [[Social movement theory|theories]] related to [[Special:BookSources/9780812203653]] social movements [Kendall, 2005]. Some of the better-known approaches are outlined below. Chronologically they include:\n* [[collective behavior]]/[[collective action]] theories (1950s)\n* [[relative deprivation theory]] (1960s)\n* [[marxist theory]] (1880s)\n* [[value-added theory]] (1960s)\n* [[resource mobilization]] (1970s)\n* [[political process theory]] (1980s)\n* [[Framing (social sciences)|framing theory]] (1980s) (closely related to [[social constructionist theory]])\n* [[new social movement theory]] (1980s)\n\n===Deprivation theory===\n[[relative deprivation theory|Deprivation theory]] argues that social movements have their foundations among people who feel deprived of some good(s) or resource(s). According to this approach, individuals who are lacking some good, service, or comfort are more likely to organize a social movement to improve (or defend) their conditions.<ref>Morrison 1978</ref>\n\nThere are two significant problems with this theory. First, since most people feel deprived at one level or another almost all the time, the theory has a hard time explaining why the groups that form social movements do when other people are also deprived. Second, the reasoning behind this theory is circular \u2013 often the only evidence for deprivation is the social movement. If deprivation is claimed to be the cause but the only evidence for such is the movement, the reasoning is circular.<ref>Jenkins and Perrow 1977</ref>\n\n===Mass society theory===\n[[Mass society theory]] argues that social movements are made up of individuals in large societies who feel insignificant or socially detached. Social movements, according to this theory, provide a sense of empowerment and belonging that the movement members would otherwise not have.<ref>Kornhauser 1959</ref>\n\nVery little support has been found for this theory. Aho (1990), in his study of Idaho Christian Patriotism, did not find that members of that movement were more likely to have been socially detached. In fact, the key to joining the movement was having a friend or associate who was a member of the movement.\n\n===Structural strain theory===\n[[Strain theory (sociology)|Social strain theory]], also known as value-added theory, proposes six factors that encourage social movement development:<ref>Smelser 1962</ref>\n# structural conduciveness - people come to believe their society has problems\n# [[structural strain]] - people experience deprivation\n# growth and spread of a solution - a solution to the problems people are experiencing is proposed and spreads\n# precipitating factors - discontent usually requires a catalyst (often a specific event) to turn it into a social movement\n# lack of social control - the entity that is to be changed must be at least somewhat open to the change; if the social movement is quickly and powerfully repressed, it may never materialize\n# mobilization - this is the actual organizing and active component of the movement; people do what needs to be done\n\nThis theory is also subject to circular reasoning as it incorporates, at least in part, deprivation theory and relies upon it, and social/structural strain for the underlying motivation of social movement activism. However, social movement activism is, like in the case of deprivation theory, often the only indication that there was strain or deprivation.\n\n===Resource mobilization theory===\n[[Resource mobilization theory]] emphasizes the importance of resources in social movement development and success. Resources are understood here to include: knowledge, money, media, labor, solidarity, legitimacy, and internal and external support from power elite. The theory argues that social movements develop when individuals with grievances are able to mobilize sufficient resources to take action.The emphasis on resources offers an explanation why some discontented/deprived individuals are able to organize while others are not.<ref name=mccarthyzald>{{cite journal|last1=McCarthy|first1=John|last2=Zald|first2=Mayer N.|title=Resource Mobilization and Social Movements: a Partial Theory|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=May 1977|volume=82|issue=6|pages=1212\u20131241|doi=10.1086/226464}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to earlier [[collective behavior]] perspectives on social movements\u2014which emphasized the role of exceptional levels of deprivation, grievance, or social strain in motivating mass protest\u2014Resource Mobilization perspectives hold \"that there is always enough discontent in any society to supply the grass-roots support for a movement if the movement is effectively organized and has at its disposal the power and resources of some established elite group\"<ref name=TurnerKillian>{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=L.|last2=Killian|first2=R.

Movements develop in contingent ''opportunity structures'' that influence their efforts to mobilize; and each movement's response to the opportunity structures depends on the movement's organization and resources {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nCritics of this theory argue that there is too much of an emphasis on resources, especially financial resources. Some movements are effective without an influx of money and are more dependent upon the movement members for time and labor (e.g., the civil rights movement in the U.S.).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Piven |first=Francis |last2=Cloward |first2=Richard |date=Summer 1991 |title=Collective Protest: A Critique of Resource Mobilization Theory |journal=International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society |volume=4|issue=4 |pages=435\u2013458 |jstor=20007011 |doi=10.1007/BF01390151 }}</ref>\n\n===Political process theory===\n[[Political process theory]] is similar to resource mobilization in many regards, but tends to emphasize a different component of [[social structure]] that is important for social movement development: [[political opportunities]]. Political process theory argues that there are three vital components for movement formation: insurgent consciousness, organizational strength, and political opportunities.\n\nInsurgent consciousness refers back to the ideas of deprivation and grievances. The idea is that certain members of society feel like they are being mistreated or that somehow the system is unjust. The insurgent consciousness is the collective sense of injustice that movement members (or potential movement members) feel and serves as the motivation for movement organization.\n\n[[Image:J20 democracy dc.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Photo taken at the 2005 U.S. Presidential inauguration protest.]]\n\nOrganizational strength falls inline with resource-mobilization theory, arguing that in order for a social movement to organize it must have strong leadership and sufficient resources.\n\nPolitical opportunity refers to the receptivity or vulnerability of the existing political system to challenge. This vulnerability can be the result of any of the following (or a combination thereof):\n* growth of political pluralism\n* decline in effectiveness of repression\n* elite disunity; the leading factions are internally fragmented\n* a broadening of access to institutional participation in political processes\n* support of organized opposition by elites\n\nOne of the advantages of the political process theory is that it addresses the issue of timing or emergence of social movements. Some groups may have the insurgent consciousness and resources to mobilize, but because political opportunities are closed, they will not have any success. The theory, then, argues that all three of these components are important.\n\nCritics of the political process theory and resource-mobilization theory point out that neither theory discusses movement culture to any great degree. This has presented culture theorists an opportunity to expound on the importance of culture.\n\nOne advance on the political process theory is the ''political mediation model,'' which outlines the way in which the political context facing movement actors intersects with the strategic choices that movements make. An additional strength of this model is that it can look at the outcomes of social movements not only in terms of success or failure but also in terms of consequences (whether intentional or unintentional, positive or negative) and in terms of [[collective benefits]].\n\n===Framing perspective===\nReflecting the [[cultural turn]] in the social sciences and humanities more broadly, recent strains of social movement theory and research add to the largely structural concerns seen in the resource mobilization and political process theories by emphasizing the cultural and psychological aspects of social movement processes, such as collectively shared interpretations and beliefs, ideologies, values and other meanings about the world. In doing so, this general cultural approach also attempts to address the [[Free rider problem|free-rider problem]]. One particularly successful take on some such cultural dimensions is manifested in the [[Framing (social sciences)|framing perspective]] on social movements.\n\nWhile both resource mobilization theory and political process theory include, or at least accept, the idea that certain shared understandings of, for example, perceived unjust societal conditions must exist for mobilization to occur at all, this is not explicitly problematized within those approaches. The framing perspective has brought such shared understandings to the forefront of the attempt to understand movement creation and existence by, e.g., arguing that, in order for social movements to successfully mobilize individuals, they must develop an ''injustice frame''. An injustice frame is a collection of ideas and symbols that illustrate both how significant the problem is as well as what the movement can do to alleviate it,\n\n:\"Like a picture frame, an issue frame marks off some part of the world. Like a building frame, it holds things together. It provides coherence to an array of symbols, images, and arguments, linking them through an underlying organizing idea that suggests what is essential - what consequences and values are at stake. We do not see the frame directly, but infer its presence by its characteristic expressions and language. Each frame gives the advantage to certain ways of talking and thinking, while it places others out of the picture.\"<ref>Ryan and Gamson 2006, p.14</ref>\n\nImportant characteristics of the injustice frames include:<ref>Ryan and Gamson 2006</ref>\n* Facts take on their meaning by being embedded in frames, which render them relevant and significant or irrelevant and trivial.\n* People carry around multiple frames in their heads.\n* Successful reframing involves the ability to enter into the worldview of our adversaries.\n* All frames contain implicit or explicit appeals to moral principles.\nIn emphasizing the injustice frame, culture theory also addresses the free-rider problem. The free-rider problem refers to the idea that people will not be motivated to participate in a social movement that will use up their personal resources (e.g., time, money, etc.) if they can still receive the benefits without participating. In other words, if person X knows that movement Y is working to improve environmental conditions in his neighborhood, he is presented with a choice: join or not join the movement. If he believes the movement will succeed without him, he can avoid participation in the movement, save his resources, and still reap the benefits - this is ''free-riding''. A significant problem for social movement theory has been to explain why people join movements if they believe the movement can/will succeed without their contribution. Culture theory argues that, in conjunction with social networks being an important contact tool, the injustice frame will provide the motivation for people to contribute to the movement.\n\nFraming processes includes three separate components:\n* Diagnostic frame: the movement organization frames what is the problem or what they are critiquing\n* Prognostic frame: the movement organization frames what is the desirable solution to the problem\n* Motivational frame: the movement organization frames a \"call to arms\" by suggesting and encouraging that people take action to solve the problem\n\n==Social movement and social networking==\nFor more than ten years{{Since when|date=December 2019}}, social movement groups have been using the Internet to accomplish organizational goals. It has been argued that the Internet helps to increase the speed, reach and effectiveness of social movement-related communication as well as mobilization efforts, and as a result, it has been suggested that the Internet has had a positive impact on the social movements in general.<ref name=\"Obar\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Ope|first=J.A.M.|title=From the Streets to the Internet: The Cyber-Diffusion of Contention|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|year=1999|volume=566|pages=132\u2013143|doi=10.1177/0002716299566001011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Eaton|first=M.|title=Manufacturing Community in an Online Activity Organization: The Rhetoric of MoveOn.org's E-mails|journal=Information, Communication and Society|year=2010|volume=13|issue=2|pages=174\u2013192|doi=10.1080/13691180902890125}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Obar|first=J.A. |author2=Zube, P. |author3=Lampe, C.|title=Advocacy 2.0: An analysis of how advocacy groups in the United States perceive and use social media as tools for facilitating civic engagement and collective action|journal=Journal of Information Policy|year=2012|volume=2|pages=1\u201325|ssrn=1956352|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1956352}}</ref> The systematic literature review of Buettner & Buettner analyzed the role of Twitter during a wide range of social movements (2007 [[WikiLeaks]], 2009 [[April 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election protests|Moldova]], 2009 [[2009 student protests in Austria|Austria student protest]], 2009 [[Gaza\u2013Israel conflict|Israel-Gaza]], 2009 [[Iranian Green Movement|Iran green revolution]], 2009 [[2010 G-20 Toronto summit protests|Toronto G20]], 2010 [[Bolivarian Revolution|Venezuela]], 2010 [[Stuttgart 21|Germany Stuttgart21]], 2011 [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egypt]], 2011 [[2011 England riots|England]], 2011 US [[Occupy movement]], 2011 [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|Spain Indignados]], 2011 [[Anti-austerity movement in Greece|Greece Aganaktismenoi movements]], 2011 [[2011 Rome demonstration|Italy]], 2011 [[2011 Wisconsin protests|Wisconsin labor protests]], 2012 [[Gaza\u2013Israel conflict|Israel Hamas]], 2013 [[2013 protests in Brazil|Brazil Vinegar]], 2013 [[Gezi Park protests|Turkey]]).<ref name=\"Buettner2016a\" />\n\nMany discussions have been generated recently on the topic of social networking and the effect it may play on the formation and mobilization of social movement.<ref>[[Clay Shirky|Shirky, Clay]].

Print.</ref> For example, the emergence of the [[Coffee Party]] first appeared on the social networking site, [[Facebook]]. The party has continued to gather membership and support through that site and file sharing sites, such as [[Flickr]]. The [[2009\u20132010 Iranian election protests]] also demonstrated how social networking sites are making the mobilization of large numbers of people quicker and easier. Iranians were able to organize and speak out against the election of [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] by using sites such as [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]]. This in turn prompted widespread government censorship of the web and social networking sites.\n\nThe sociological study of social movements is quite new.{{According to whom|date=December 2019}} The traditional view of movements often perceived them as chaotic and disorganized, treating activism as a threat to the [[social order]]. The activism experienced in the 1960s and 1970s shuffled in a new world opinion about the subject. Models were now introduced to understand the organizational and structural powers embedded in social movements.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Society}}\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[List of social movements]]\n* [[Civil resistance]]\n* [[Counterculture of the 1960s]]\n* [[Countermovement]]\n* [[Moral shock]]\n* [[New social movements]]\n* [[Nonviolent resistance]]\n* [[Political movement]]\n* [[Reform movement]]\n* [[Revolutionary movement]]\n* [[Social defence]]\n* [[Social equality]]\n* [[Teaching for social justice]]\n* [[Union organizer]]\n* [[Online social movements]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[David F.

The term \"social movements\" was introduced in 1848 by the German Sociologist [[Lorenz von Stein]] in his book ''Socialist and Communist Movements since the Third French Revolution (1848)'' in which he introduced the term \"social movement\" into scholarly discussions<ref>Tilly, 2004, p.5</ref> - actually depicting in this way [[political movement]]s fighting for the social rights understood as [[welfare rights]].\n\n[[Image:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] was a leader in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], one of the most famous social movements of the 20th century.]]\nThe [[labor movement]] and [[socialist movement]] of the late 19th century are seen as the prototypical social movements, leading to the formation of [[communism|communist]] and [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties and organisations. These tendencies were seen in poorer countries as pressure for reform continued, for example in Russia with the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] and [[Russian Revolution of 1917|of 1917]], resulting in the collapse of the Czarist regime around the end of the [[World War I|First World War]].\n\nIn 1945, Britain after victory in the [[World War II|Second World War]] entered a period of radical reform and change. In the post-war period, [[Feminism]], [[gay rights movement]], [[peace movement]], [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[anti-nuclear movement]] and [[environmental movement]] emerged, often dubbed the [[New Social Movements]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Westd|first1=David|title=New Social Movements|journal=Handbook of Political Theory|pages=265\u2013276|date=2004|url=http://www.omnilogos.com/2015/02/new-social-movements.html|access-date=2015-02-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215161004/http://www.omnilogos.com/2015/02/new-social-movements.html|archive-date=2015-02-15|url-status=dead|doi=10.4135/9781848608139.n20|isbn=9780761967880}}</ref> They led, among other things, to the formation of [[green parties]] and organisations influenced by the [[new left]]. Some find in the end of the 1990s the emergence of a new global social movement, the [[anti-globalization movement]]. Some social movement scholars posit that with the rapid pace of globalization, the potential for the emergence of new ''type'' of social movement is latent\u2014they make the analogy to national movements of the past to describe what has been termed a [[global citizens movement]].\n\n===Key processes===\nSeveral key processes lie behind the history of social movements. [[Urbanization]] led to larger settlements, where people of similar goals could find each other, gather and organize. This facilitated [[social interaction]] between scores of people, and it was in urban areas that those early social movements first appeared. Similarly, the process of industrialization which gathered large masses of workers in the same region explains why many of those early social movements addressed matters such as economic wellbeing, important to the [[worker class]]. Many other social movements were created at [[university|universities]], where the process of [[mass education]] brought many people together. With the development of [[communication]] technologies, creation and activities of social movements became easier \u2013 from printed pamphlets circulating in the 18th century [[coffeehouse]]s to [[newspaper]]s and [[Internet]], all those tools became important factors in the growth of the social movements. Finally, the spread of [[democracy]] and [[political rights]] like the [[freedom of speech]] made the creation and functioning of social movements much easier.\n\n== Mass mobilization ==\nNascent social movements often fail to achieve their objectives because they fail to mobilize sufficient numbers of people. Srdja Popovic, author of Blueprint for Revolution,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Blueprint for revolution : how to use rice pudding, Lego men, and other nonviolent techniques to galvanize communities, overthrow dictators, or simply change the world|author=Popovic, Srdja|others=Miller, Matthew I., 1979-|isbn=9780812995305|edition=First|location=New York|oclc=878500820|year = 2015}}</ref> and spokesperson for [[Otpor!|OTPOR!]], says that movements succeed when they address issues that people actually care about. \u201cIt\u2019s unrealistic to expect people to care about more than what they already care about, and any attempt to make them do so is bound to fail.\u201d Activists too often make the mistake of trying to convince people to address their issues. A mobilization strategy aimed at large-scale change often begins with action a small issue that concerns many people. For instance, [[Mahatma Gandhi]]\u2019s successful overthrow of British rule in India began as a small protest focused on the British tax on salt.\n\nPopovic also argues that a social movement has little chance of growing if it relies on boring speeches and the usual placard waving marches. He argues for creating movements that people actually want to join. OTPOR! succeeded because it was fun, funny, and invented graphic ways of ridiculing dictator [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107|Slobodan Milosevic]]. It turned fatalism and passivity into action by making it easy, even cool, to become a revolutionary; branding itself within hip slogans, rock music and street theatre.

''The Peyote Religion among the Navaho''. Chicago: Aldine. {{ISBN|0-8061-2382-6}}</ref>]]\n\nSociologists distinguish between several types of social movement:\n* Scope:\n** [[reform movement]] - movements advocating changing some [[norm (sociology)|norms]] or [[law]]s. Examples of such a movement would include a [[trade union]] with a goal of increasing [[workers rights]], a [[green movement]] advocating a set of [[ecology|ecological]] laws, or a movement supporting introduction of a [[capital punishment]] or the right to [[abortion]]. Some reform movements may aim for a change in custom and moral norms, such as condemnation of [[pornography]] or proliferation of some [[religion]].\n** radical movement - movements dedicated to changing [[value system]]s in a fundamental way. Examples would include the [[Civil Rights Movement]] which demanded full [[civil rights]] and equality under the law to all Americans, regardless of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]; the [[Poland|Polish]] [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] (''Solidarno\u015b\u0107'') movement which demanded the transformation of a [[Stalinist]] political and [[economic system]] into a [[democracy]]; or the [[South Africa]]n [[shack dweller]]s' movement [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] which demands the full inclusion of shack dwellers into the life of cities.\n* Type of change:\n** innovation movement - movements which want to introduce or change particular norms, values, etc. The [[singularitarianism]] movement advocating deliberate action to effect and ensure the safety of the [[technological singularity]] is an example of an innovation movement.\n** conservative movement - movements which want to preserve existing norms, values, etc. For example, the anti-technology 19th century [[Luddite]]s movement or the modern movement opposing the spread of the [[genetically modified food]] could be seen as conservative movements in that they aimed to fight specific technological changes.\n* Targets:\n** group-focus movements - focused on affecting groups or society in general, for example, advocating the change of the political system. Some of these groups transform into or join a [[political party]], but many remain outside the reformist party political system.\n** individual-focused movements - focused on affecting individuals. Most [[religious movement]]s would fall under this category.\n* Methods of work:\n** peaceful movements - various movements which use [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] means of protest as part of a campaign of [[nonviolent resistance]], also often called [[civil resistance]]. The American Civil Rights Movement, Polish Solidarity movement or the [[nonviolent]], [[civil disobedience]]-orientated wing of the [[Indian independence movement]] would fall into this category.<ref>[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Roberts, Adam]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), [http://www.oup.com/uk/catalogue/?ci=9780199552016 ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present''] {{webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20141115183530/http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199552016.do |date=2014-11-15 }}, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-19-955201-6}}, contains chapters on these and many other social movements using non-violent methods.[https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&source=gbs_navlinks_s]</ref>\n** violent movements - various movements<ref>Seferiades, S., & Johnston, H. (Eds.). (2012). ''Violent protest, contentious politics, and the neoliberal state''. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd..</ref> which resort to violence; they are usually armed and in extreme cases can take a form of a [[paramilitary]] or [[terrorist]] organization. Examples: the [[Rote Armee Fraktion]], [[Al-Qaida]].\n* Old and new:\n** old movements - movements for change have existed for many centuries. Most of the oldest recognized movements, dating to late 18th and 19th centuries, fought for specific social groups, such as the working class, peasants, whites, aristocrats, Protestants, men. They were usually centered around some [[materialism|materialistic]] goals like improving the [[standard of living]] or, for example, the political autonomy of the working class.\n** [[new social movements|new movements]] - movements which became dominant from the second half of the 20th century. Notable examples include the [[civil rights movement|American civil rights movement]], [[second-wave feminism]], [[gay rights movement]], [[environmental movement|environmentalism and conservation efforts]], [[Mass surveillance|opposition to mass surveillance]], etc. They are usually centered around issues that go beyond but are not separate from class.\n* Range:\n** global movements - social movements with global ([[International organization|transnational]]) objectives and goals. Movements such as the [[International Workingmen's Association|first]] (where Marx and Bakunin met), [[Second International|second]], [[Comintern|third]] and [[fourth international]]s, the [[World Social Forum]], the [[Peoples' Global Action]] and the [[anarchism|anarchist movement]] seek to change society at a global level.\n** local movements - most of the social movements have a local scope.<ref>Snow, David A., Sarah Anne Soule, Hanspeter Kriesi. ''The Blackwell companion to social movements''.

Unless there is a single leader who does, or a formal system of membership agreements, activists will typically use diverse labels and descriptive phrases that require scholars to discern when they are referring to the same or similar ideas, declare similar goals, adopt similar programs of action, and use similar methods. There can be great differences in the way that is done, to recognize who is and who is not a member or an allied group{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}:\n\n* Insiders: Often exaggerate the level of support by considering people supporters whose level of activity or support is weak, but also reject those that outsiders might consider supporters because they discredit the cause, or are even seen as adversaries{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n* Outsiders: Those not supporters who may tend to either underestimate or overestimate the level or support or activity of elements of a movement, by including or excluding those that insiders would exclude or include.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIt is often outsiders rather than insiders that apply the identifying labels for a movement, which the insiders then may or may not adopt and use to self-identify. For example, the label for the [[levellers]] [[political movement]] in 17th-century England was applied to them by their antagonists, as a [[term of disparagement]]. Yet admirers of the movement and its aims later came to use the term, and it is the term by which they are known to history.\n\nCaution must always be exercised in any discussion of amorphous phenomena such as movements to distinguish between the views of insiders and outsiders, supporters and antagonists, each of whom may have their own purposes and agendas in [[characterization]] or mischaracterization of it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Dynamics of social movements==\n[[Image:Stages of social movements.svg|right|thumb|400px|Stages of social movements.<ref>Graph based on Blumer, Herbert G. 1969. \"Collective Behavior.\" In Alfred McClung Lee, ed., ''Principles of Sociology''.

Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley, 1978.</ref>]]\n\nSocial movements have a life cycle: they are created, they grow, they achieve successes or failures and eventually, they dissolve and cease to exist.\n\nThey are more likely to evolve in the time and place which is friendly{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} to the social movements: hence their evident symbiosis with the 19th century proliferation of ideas like individual rights, freedom of speech and civil disobedience. Social movements occur in liberal and authoritarian societies but in different forms. These new movements are activated by a wish for change in social customs, ethics and values which oppress certain communities. The birth of a social movement needs what sociologist [[Neil Smelser]] calls an ''initiating event'': a particular, individual event that will begin a [[chain reaction]] of events in the given society leading to the creation of a social movement. The root of this event must be the result of some common discontent among a community. Hence, making ''emergence'' the first step to a social movement. This discontent will act as the chain that links common people together, as they share the same experiences and feelings of oppression. \"Within this stage, social movements are very preliminary and there is little to no organization. Instead this stage can be thought of as widespread discontent (Macionis, 2001; Hopper, 1950).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hopper|first=R. D.|date=1950-03-01|title=The Revolutionary Process: A Frame of Reference for the Study of Revolutionary Movements|journal=Social Forces|volume=28|issue=3|pages=270\u2013279|doi=10.2307/2572010|issn=0037-7732|jstor=2572010}}</ref>\" Emergence is prior to any sort of organized resistance to the condition of society. Jonathan Christiansen's essay on the four stages of social movement dissects further into the historical sociology of how each stage affects the whole movement. The Civil Rights Movement's early stages are an example of the public display of protest that is utilized to push a movement into the next stages. \"It was not until after the Brown v. the Board of Education Supreme court decision (1954), which outlawed segregation in Public schools, and following the arrest of Rosa Parks in Montgomery, Alabama for refusing to comply with segregation laws on city buses by giving up her bus seat to a white man, that the American Civil Rights Movement would proceed to the next stage \u2013 coalescence.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebscohost.com/uploads/imported/thisTopic-dbTopic-1248.pdf|title=Four Stages of Social Movement|last=Christiansen|first=Jonathan|date=2009}}</ref> The impact of a black woman, [[Rosa Parks]], riding in the whites-only section of the bus (although she was not acting alone or spontaneously\u2014typically activist leaders lay the groundwork behind the scenes of interventions designed to spark a movement).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/local/blogs/moonblog/2015/11/29/bus-boycott-took-planning-smarts/76456904/|title=Bus Boycott took planning, smarts|website=The Montgomery Advertiser|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> This leads into coalesce because now the common dilemma and source of oppression is being pinned down, allowing for organizations and appearance to the public eye to be established. The Polish Solidarity movement, which eventually [[Revolutions of 1989|toppled the communist regimes of Eastern Europe]], developed after trade union activist [[Anna Walentynowicz]] was fired from work. The South African shack dwellers' movement [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] grew out of a road blockade in response to the sudden selling off of a small piece of land promised for housing to a developer. Such an event is also described as a ''volcanic model'' \u2013 a social movement is often created after a large number of people realize that there are others sharing the same value and desire for a particular social change.\n\nThis third stage, bureaucratization, is when movements must become more organized, centered around a more systematic model. The set up and system for going about the construct must be more formal, with people taking on specific roles and responsibilities. \"In this phase their political power is greater than in the previous stages in that they may have more regular access to political elites.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> In this stage, one organization may take over another one in order to obtain a greater status and formal alliance. This 'taking over' may be a positive or negative move for organizations. Ella Baker, an activist who played a role in the NAACP,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naacp.org/|title=NAACP {{!}} Home|website=NAACP|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> had proposed to the students of the student movement to start their own organization. This becomes known as the SNCC, the student nonviolent coordinating committee (1960s). The students could have join forces with the SCLC,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/southern-christian-leadership-conference-sclc|title=Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)|last=University|first=\u00a9 Stanford|last2=Stanford|date=2017-07-07|website=The Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03|last3=California 94305}}</ref> an already existing organization, but that would have been a poor bureaucratizing decision, as they would succumb to old ideologies. New and progressive ideas that challenge prior authority are crucial to social change.\n\nThe declining of a social movement does not necessarily mean failure. There are multiple routes in which a movement may take before proceeding into decline. Success of a movement would result in permanent changes within the society and/or government that would result in a loss of need for protest. Failure is often the result of the incapability to keep a common focus, and work towards the goal in mind.  \"Failure of social movements due to organizational or strategic failings is common for many organizations.<ref>{{Citation|chapter=Contents|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=9780812203653|doi=10.9783/9780812203653.toc|title=American Patriotism, American Protest|year=2011}}</ref>\" Such a route would result in the gradual breaking up of an organization, and out of the stages of movement. Co-optation results when people or groups are integrated and shift away from the social movement's initial concerns and values. Repression is another example, when the movement is slowly wiped away from the public platform through means of an outside force, usually being the government. The last route into declining is going mainstream, which is generally perceived as an overall success. This is when goals of the movement are taken into society as a part of daily life, making it a 'social norm.' For example, birth control is still a greatly debated topic on a government level, but it has been accepted into social life as a common thing that exists.\n\nIt is important to recognize that though movements may disintegrate and cease to be active, the impact that they have in the social realm is success in its own way. It sparks the notion in new generations that the possibility to organize and make change is there.\n\n==Social movement theories==\n{{Main|Social movement theory}}\nSociologists have developed several [[Social movement theory|theories]] related to [[Special:BookSources/9780812203653]] social movements [Kendall, 2005]. Some of the better-known approaches are outlined below. Chronologically they include:\n* [[collective behavior]]/[[collective action]] theories (1950s)\n* [[relative deprivation theory]] (1960s)\n* [[marxist theory]] (1880s)\n* [[value-added theory]] (1960s)\n* [[resource mobilization]] (1970s)\n* [[political process theory]] (1980s)\n* [[Framing (social sciences)|framing theory]] (1980s) (closely related to [[social constructionist theory]])\n* [[new social movement theory]] (1980s)\n\n===Deprivation theory===\n[[relative deprivation theory|Deprivation theory]] argues that social movements have their foundations among people who feel deprived of some good(s) or resource(s). According to this approach, individuals who are lacking some good, service, or comfort are more likely to organize a social movement to improve (or defend) their conditions.<ref>Morrison 1978</ref>\n\nThere are two significant problems with this theory. First, since most people feel deprived at one level or another almost all the time, the theory has a hard time explaining why the groups that form social movements do when other people are also deprived. Second, the reasoning behind this theory is circular \u2013 often the only evidence for deprivation is the social movement. If deprivation is claimed to be the cause but the only evidence for such is the movement, the reasoning is circular.<ref>Jenkins and Perrow 1977</ref>\n\n===Mass society theory===\n[[Mass society theory]] argues that social movements are made up of individuals in large societies who feel insignificant or socially detached. Social movements, according to this theory, provide a sense of empowerment and belonging that the movement members would otherwise not have.<ref>Kornhauser 1959</ref>\n\nVery little support has been found for this theory. Aho (1990), in his study of Idaho Christian Patriotism, did not find that members of that movement were more likely to have been socially detached. In fact, the key to joining the movement was having a friend or associate who was a member of the movement.\n\n===Structural strain theory===\n[[Strain theory (sociology)|Social strain theory]], also known as value-added theory, proposes six factors that encourage social movement development:<ref>Smelser 1962</ref>\n# structural conduciveness - people come to believe their society has problems\n# [[structural strain]] - people experience deprivation\n# growth and spread of a solution - a solution to the problems people are experiencing is proposed and spreads\n# precipitating factors - discontent usually requires a catalyst (often a specific event) to turn it into a social movement\n# lack of social control - the entity that is to be changed must be at least somewhat open to the change; if the social movement is quickly and powerfully repressed, it may never materialize\n# mobilization - this is the actual organizing and active component of the movement; people do what needs to be done\n\nThis theory is also subject to circular reasoning as it incorporates, at least in part, deprivation theory and relies upon it, and social/structural strain for the underlying motivation of social movement activism. However, social movement activism is, like in the case of deprivation theory, often the only indication that there was strain or deprivation.\n\n===Resource mobilization theory===\n[[Resource mobilization theory]] emphasizes the importance of resources in social movement development and success. Resources are understood here to include: knowledge, money, media, labor, solidarity, legitimacy, and internal and external support from power elite. The theory argues that social movements develop when individuals with grievances are able to mobilize sufficient resources to take action.The emphasis on resources offers an explanation why some discontented/deprived individuals are able to organize while others are not.<ref name=mccarthyzald>{{cite journal|last1=McCarthy|first1=John|last2=Zald|first2=Mayer N.|title=Resource Mobilization and Social Movements: a Partial Theory|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=May 1977|volume=82|issue=6|pages=1212\u20131241|doi=10.1086/226464}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to earlier [[collective behavior]] perspectives on social movements\u2014which emphasized the role of exceptional levels of deprivation, grievance, or social strain in motivating mass protest\u2014Resource Mobilization perspectives hold \"that there is always enough discontent in any society to supply the grass-roots support for a movement if the movement is effectively organized and has at its disposal the power and resources of some established elite group\"<ref name=TurnerKillian>{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=L.|last2=Killian|first2=R. N.|title=Collective Behavior|date=1972|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J|page=251}}</ref> Movement emergence is contingent upon the aggregation of resources by social movement entrepreneurs and movement organizations, who use these resources to turn collective dissent in to political pressure.<ref name=mccarthyzald/>  Members are recruited through networks; commitment is maintained by building a collective identity, and through interpersonal relationships. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nResource Mobilization Theory views social movement activity as \"politics by other means\": a rational and strategic effort by ordinary people to change society or politics.<ref name=gamson>{{cite journal|last1=Gamson|first1=William A.|title=The Limits of Pluralism|journal=CRSO Working Papers|date=June 1974|issue=102|page=12|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/50879/102.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=12 April 2015}}</ref> The form of the resources shapes the activities of the movement (e.g., access to a TV station will result in the extensive use TV media). Movements develop in contingent ''opportunity structures'' that influence their efforts to mobilize; and each movement's response to the opportunity structures depends on the movement's organization and resources {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nCritics of this theory argue that there is too much of an emphasis on resources, especially financial resources. Some movements are effective without an influx of money and are more dependent upon the movement members for time and labor (e.g., the civil rights movement in the U.S.).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Piven |first=Francis |last2=Cloward |first2=Richard |date=Summer 1991 |title=Collective Protest: A Critique of Resource Mobilization Theory |journal=International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society |volume=4|issue=4 |pages=435\u2013458 |jstor=20007011 |doi=10.1007/BF01390151 }}</ref>\n\n===Political process theory===\n[[Political process theory]] is similar to resource mobilization in many regards, but tends to emphasize a different component of [[social structure]] that is important for social movement development: [[political opportunities]]. Political process theory argues that there are three vital components for movement formation: insurgent consciousness, organizational strength, and political opportunities.\n\nInsurgent consciousness refers back to the ideas of deprivation and grievances. The idea is that certain members of society feel like they are being mistreated or that somehow the system is unjust. The insurgent consciousness is the collective sense of injustice that movement members (or potential movement members) feel and serves as the motivation for movement organization.\n\n[[Image:J20 democracy dc.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Photo taken at the 2005 U.S. Presidential inauguration protest.]]\n\nOrganizational strength falls inline with resource-mobilization theory, arguing that in order for a social movement to organize it must have strong leadership and sufficient resources.\n\nPolitical opportunity refers to the receptivity or vulnerability of the existing political system to challenge. This vulnerability can be the result of any of the following (or a combination thereof):\n* growth of political pluralism\n* decline in effectiveness of repression\n* elite disunity; the leading factions are internally fragmented\n* a broadening of access to institutional participation in political processes\n* support of organized opposition by elites\n\nOne of the advantages of the political process theory is that it addresses the issue of timing or emergence of social movements. Some groups may have the insurgent consciousness and resources to mobilize, but because political opportunities are closed, they will not have any success. The theory, then, argues that all three of these components are important.\n\nCritics of the political process theory and resource-mobilization theory point out that neither theory discusses movement culture to any great degree. This has presented culture theorists an opportunity to expound on the importance of culture.\n\nOne advance on the political process theory is the ''political mediation model,'' which outlines the way in which the political context facing movement actors intersects with the strategic choices that movements make. An additional strength of this model is that it can look at the outcomes of social movements not only in terms of success or failure but also in terms of consequences (whether intentional or unintentional, positive or negative) and in terms of [[collective benefits]].\n\n===Framing perspective===\nReflecting the [[cultural turn]] in the social sciences and humanities more broadly, recent strains of social movement theory and research add to the largely structural concerns seen in the resource mobilization and political process theories by emphasizing the cultural and psychological aspects of social movement processes, such as collectively shared interpretations and beliefs, ideologies, values and other meanings about the world. In doing so, this general cultural approach also attempts to address the [[Free rider problem|free-rider problem]]. One particularly successful take on some such cultural dimensions is manifested in the [[Framing (social sciences)|framing perspective]] on social movements.\n\nWhile both resource mobilization theory and political process theory include, or at least accept, the idea that certain shared understandings of, for example, perceived unjust societal conditions must exist for mobilization to occur at all, this is not explicitly problematized within those approaches. The framing perspective has brought such shared understandings to the forefront of the attempt to understand movement creation and existence by, e.g., arguing that, in order for social movements to successfully mobilize individuals, they must develop an ''injustice frame''. An injustice frame is a collection of ideas and symbols that illustrate both how significant the problem is as well as what the movement can do to alleviate it,\n\n:\"Like a picture frame, an issue frame marks off some part of the world. Like a building frame, it holds things together. It provides coherence to an array of symbols, images, and arguments, linking them through an underlying organizing idea that suggests what is essential - what consequences and values are at stake. We do not see the frame directly, but infer its presence by its characteristic expressions and language. Each frame gives the advantage to certain ways of talking and thinking, while it places others out of the picture.\"<ref>Ryan and Gamson 2006, p.14</ref>\n\nImportant characteristics of the injustice frames include:<ref>Ryan and Gamson 2006</ref>\n* Facts take on their meaning by being embedded in frames, which render them relevant and significant or irrelevant and trivial.\n* People carry around multiple frames in their heads.\n* Successful reframing involves the ability to enter into the worldview of our adversaries.\n* All frames contain implicit or explicit appeals to moral principles.\nIn emphasizing the injustice frame, culture theory also addresses the free-rider problem. The free-rider problem refers to the idea that people will not be motivated to participate in a social movement that will use up their personal resources (e.g., time, money, etc.) if they can still receive the benefits without participating. In other words, if person X knows that movement Y is working to improve environmental conditions in his neighborhood, he is presented with a choice: join or not join the movement. If he believes the movement will succeed without him, he can avoid participation in the movement, save his resources, and still reap the benefits - this is ''free-riding''. A significant problem for social movement theory has been to explain why people join movements if they believe the movement can/will succeed without their contribution. Culture theory argues that, in conjunction with social networks being an important contact tool, the injustice frame will provide the motivation for people to contribute to the movement.\n\nFraming processes includes three separate components:\n* Diagnostic frame: the movement organization frames what is the problem or what they are critiquing\n* Prognostic frame: the movement organization frames what is the desirable solution to the problem\n* Motivational frame: the movement organization frames a \"call to arms\" by suggesting and encouraging that people take action to solve the problem\n\n==Social movement and social networking==\nFor more than ten years{{Since when|date=December 2019}}, social movement groups have been using the Internet to accomplish organizational goals. It has been argued that the Internet helps to increase the speed, reach and effectiveness of social movement-related communication as well as mobilization efforts, and as a result, it has been suggested that the Internet has had a positive impact on the social movements in general.<ref name=\"Obar\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Ope|first=J.A.M.|title=From the Streets to the Internet: The Cyber-Diffusion of Contention|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|year=1999|volume=566|pages=132\u2013143|doi=10.1177/0002716299566001011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Eaton|first=M.|title=Manufacturing Community in an Online Activity Organization: The Rhetoric of MoveOn.org's E-mails|journal=Information, Communication and Society|year=2010|volume=13|issue=2|pages=174\u2013192|doi=10.1080/13691180902890125}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Obar|first=J.A. |author2=Zube, P. |author3=Lampe, C.|title=Advocacy 2.0: An analysis of how advocacy groups in the United States perceive and use social media as tools for facilitating civic engagement and collective action|journal=Journal of Information Policy|year=2012|volume=2|pages=1\u201325|ssrn=1956352|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1956352}}</ref> The systematic literature review of Buettner & Buettner analyzed the role of Twitter during a wide range of social movements (2007 [[WikiLeaks]], 2009 [[April 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election protests|Moldova]], 2009 [[2009 student protests in Austria|Austria student protest]], 2009 [[Gaza\u2013Israel conflict|Israel-Gaza]], 2009 [[Iranian Green Movement|Iran green revolution]], 2009 [[2010 G-20 Toronto summit protests|Toronto G20]], 2010 [[Bolivarian Revolution|Venezuela]], 2010 [[Stuttgart 21|Germany Stuttgart21]], 2011 [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egypt]], 2011 [[2011 England riots|England]], 2011 US [[Occupy movement]], 2011 [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|Spain Indignados]], 2011 [[Anti-austerity movement in Greece|Greece Aganaktismenoi movements]], 2011 [[2011 Rome demonstration|Italy]], 2011 [[2011 Wisconsin protests|Wisconsin labor protests]], 2012 [[Gaza\u2013Israel conflict|Israel Hamas]], 2013 [[2013 protests in Brazil|Brazil Vinegar]], 2013 [[Gezi Park protests|Turkey]]).<ref name=\"Buettner2016a\" />\n\nMany discussions have been generated recently on the topic of social networking and the effect it may play on the formation and mobilization of social movement.<ref>[[Clay Shirky|Shirky, Clay]].

Print.</ref> For example, the emergence of the [[Coffee Party]] first appeared on the social networking site, [[Facebook]]. The party has continued to gather membership and support through that site and file sharing sites, such as [[Flickr]]. The [[2009\u20132010 Iranian election protests]] also demonstrated how social networking sites are making the mobilization of large numbers of people quicker and easier. Iranians were able to organize and speak out against the election of [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] by using sites such as [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]]. This in turn prompted widespread government censorship of the web and social networking sites.\n\nThe sociological study of social movements is quite new.{{According to whom|date=December 2019}} The traditional view of movements often perceived them as chaotic and disorganized, treating activism as a threat to the [[social order]]. The activism experienced in the 1960s and 1970s shuffled in a new world opinion about the subject. Models were now introduced to understand the organizational and structural powers embedded in social movements.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Society}}\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[List of social movements]]\n* [[Civil resistance]]\n* [[Counterculture of the 1960s]]\n* [[Countermovement]]\n* [[Moral shock]]\n* [[New social movements]]\n* [[Nonviolent resistance]]\n* [[Political movement]]\n* [[Reform movement]]\n* [[Revolutionary movement]]\n* [[Social defence]]\n* [[Social equality]]\n* [[Teaching for social justice]]\n* [[Union organizer]]\n* [[Online social movements]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[David F.

Abraham) has been paralyzed and rendered impotent. Her sexual frustration leads her into an affair with the servant, Chandrasekharan (Jayan). She eventually marries him but later discovers that he has had relationship with many ladies and he aimed only at her wealth. She and her only daughter Baby (born from her first husband) are helpless as they are not able to put him out of their lives. Later, a young man named Prabhakaran, who is the son of an ex-servant of Soudamini, enters their life and helps them to get rid of Chandrasekharan. In the climax, Chandrasekharan is shot dead by Soudamini.\n\n== Box office ==\nThis film was commercial success which strengthened the position of lead actor [[Jayan]] both as a villain and as a hero. This film also broke many box office records and was declared as the highest-grossing movie ever released until another Jayan film ''Angadi'' broke it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/remembering-kolilakkam-superstar-jayan-his-35th-death-anniversary-654971|title=Remembering 'Kolilakkam' superstar Jayan on his 35th death anniversary|work=[[International Business Times]]|date=16 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jayan]] as Chandrasekharan\n* [[Sheela]] as Soudamini\n* [[Sathaar]] as Prabhakaran\n* [[Priya (Old)]] as Baby\n* [[Nellikkodu Bhaskaran]] as Sidhayyan\n* [[Oduvil Unnikrishnan]] as Subbaiyer\n* [[Shankar (actor)|Shankar]] as Baby's friend (guest role)\n* Baby [[Sumathi (actress)|Sumathi]] as Young Baby\n* [[P.

Abraham) has been paralyzed and rendered impotent. Her sexual frustration leads her into an affair with the servant, Chandrasekharan (Jayan). She eventually marries him but later discovers that he has had relationship with many ladies and he aimed only at her wealth. She and her only daughter Baby (born from her first husband) are helpless as they are not able to put him out of their lives. Later, a young man named Prabhakaran, who is the son of an ex-servant of Soudamini, enters their life and helps them to get rid of Chandrasekharan. In the climax, Chandrasekharan is shot dead by Soudamini.\n\n== Box office ==\nThis film was commercial success which strengthened the position of lead actor [[Jayan]] both as a villain and as a hero.
