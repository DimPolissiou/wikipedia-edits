His reign saw the fall of the [[Russian Empire]] from one of the foremost great powers of the world to economic and military collapse. His memory was reviled by [[Historiography in the Soviet Union|Soviet historians]] as a weak and incompetent leader whose decisions led to military defeats and the deaths of millions of his subjects. By contrast Anglo-Russian historian [[Nikolai Tolstoy]], leader of the International Monarchist League, says, \"There were many bad things about the Tsar's regime, but he inherited an autocracy and his acts are now being seen in perspective and in comparison to the terrible crimes committed by the Soviets.\"<ref name=\"Tsar Nicholas - exhibits from an execution\">{{citation|title = Tsar Nicholas \u2013 exhibits from an execution|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18592372|publisher = BBC News|author = Martin Vennard|date = 27 June 2012|accessdate = 3 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs Emperor, Nicholas gave limited support to the economic and political reforms promoted by top aides [[Sergei Witte]] and [[Pyotr Stolypin]], but they faced too much aristocratic opposition to be fully effective. He supported modernization based on foreign loans and close ties with France, but resisted giving the new parliament (the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|Duma]]) major roles. He was criticised for the [[Khodynka Tragedy]], [[Pogroms in the Russian Empire|antisemitic pogroms]], [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]], the violent suppression of the [[1905 Russian Revolution]], the repression of political opponents, and his perceived responsibility for defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904\u20131905), which saw the annihilation of the [[Baltic Fleet|Russian Baltic Fleet]] at the [[Battle of Tsushima]], the loss of Russian influence over Manchuria and Korea, and the [[Karafuto Prefecture|Japanese annexation of the south of Sakhalin Island]].\n\nNicholas signed the [[Anglo-Russian Convention|Anglo-Russian Entente]] of 1907, which was designed to counter [[German Empire|Germany]]'s attempts to gain influence in the Middle East; it ended [[the Great Game]] of confrontation between Russia and the [[British Empire]]. He supported Serbia and approved the mobilization of the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian Army]] on 30 July 1914. In response, Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August 1914 and its ally France on 3 August 1914,<ref>{{cite web |title=World War I Declarations |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/topics/ww1declarations.html |publisher=The Library of Congress |accessdate=5 September 2019}}</ref> starting [[World War I|the First World War]]. The aristocracy was alarmed at the powerful influence of the despised peasant priest [[Grigori Rasputin]] over the tsar. The severe military losses led to a collapse of morale at the front and at home, leading to the fall of the [[House of Romanov]] in the [[February Revolution]] of 1917. Nicholas abdicated on behalf of himself and his son. With his family he was imprisoned by the Bolsheviks and [[Execution of the Romanov family|executed]] in July 1918.\n\nIn 1981, Nicholas, his wife, and their children were recognized as martyrs by the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] in [[New York City]].<ref>A Reader's Guide to Orthodox Icons [http://iconreader.wordpress.com/2011/07/17/the-icons-that-canonized-the-holy-royal-martyrs/ ''The Icons that Canonized the Holy Royal Martyrs'']</ref> After the fall of Communism, the remains of the imperial family were exhumed, identified and re-interred with an elaborate state and church ceremony in St. Petersburg on 17 July 1998.

He had five younger siblings: [[Grand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich of Russia|Alexander]] (1869\u20131870), [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|George]] (1871\u20131899), [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Xenia]] (1875\u20131960), [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Michael]] (1878\u20131918) and [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia|Olga]] (1882\u20131960). Nicholas often referred to his father nostalgically in letters after Alexander's death in 1894. He was also very close to his mother, as revealed in their published letters to each other.<ref>''The letters of Tsar Nicholas and Empress Marie: being confidential correspondence between Nicholas II, last of the Tsars, and his mother, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna''. Edward J. Bing (ed.). London: Nicholson and Watson, 1937.</ref>\n\nHis paternal grandparents were [[Alexander II of Russia|Emperor Alexander II]] and [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)|Empress Maria Alexandrovna]] (n\u00e9e Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine). His maternal grandparents were [[Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise of Denmark]]. Nicholas was of primarily German and [[Danes|Danish]] descent, his last ethnically [[Russians|Russian]] ancestor being [[Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia]] (1708\u20131728), daughter of [[Peter the Great]].\n\n[[File:Tsar Nicholas II & King George V.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Emperor Nicholas II of Russia with his physically similar cousin, [[George V|King George V of the United Kingdom]] (right), wearing German military uniforms in Berlin before the war; 1913]]\nNicholas was related to several monarchs in Europe. His mother's siblings included Kings [[Frederick VIII of Denmark]] and [[George I of Greece]], as well as the United Kingdom's [[Queen Alexandra]] (consort of [[King Edward VII]]). Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor Wilhelm II]] were all first cousins of [[George V|King George V of the United Kingdom]]. Nicholas was also a first cousin of both [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]] and [[Maud of Wales|Queen Maud of Norway]], as well as [[Christian X of Denmark|King Christian X of Denmark]] and [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I of Greece]]. Nicholas and Wilhelm II were in turn second cousins-once-removed, as each descended from [[Frederick William III of Prussia|King Frederick William III of Prussia]], as well as third cousins, as they were both great-great-grandsons of [[Tsar Paul I of Russia]]. In addition to being second cousins through descent from [[Louis II, Grand Duke of Hesse]] and his wife [[Princess Wilhelmine of Baden]], Nicholas and Alexandra were also third cousins-once-removed, as they were both descendants of [[Frederick William II of Prussia|King Frederick William II of Prussia]].\n\nTsar Nicholas II was the first cousin-once-removed of [[Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich of Russia (1856\u20131929)|Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich]]. To distinguish between them the Grand Duke was often known within the imperial family as \"Nikolasha\" and \"Nicholas the Tall\", while the Tsar was \"Nicholas the Short\".\n\nIn his childhood, Nicholas, his parents and siblings made annual visits to the Danish royal palaces of [[Fredensborg Palace|Fredensborg]] and [[Bernstorff Palace|Bernstorff]] to visit his grandparents, the king and queen. The visits also served as family reunions, as his mother's siblings would also come from the United Kingdom, Germany and Greece with their respective families.<ref>Van Der Kiste, John (2003) ''The Romanovs: 1818\u20131959'', Sutton Publishing, p. 151</ref> It was there in 1883, that he had a flirtation with one of his British first cousins, [[Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom|Princess Victoria]]. In 1873, Nicholas also accompanied his parents and younger brother, two-year-old George, on a two-month, semi-official visit to the United Kingdom.<ref>Clay, Catarine (2006) ''King, Kaiser, Tsar: Three Royal Cousins Who Led the World to War'', Walker & Company, {{ISBN|0802716237}}, p. 54</ref> In London, Nicholas and his family stayed at [[Marlborough House]], as guests of his \"Uncle Bertie\" and \"Aunt Alix\", the Prince and Princess of Wales, where he was spoiled by his uncle.<ref>Magnus, Philip (1964) ''King Edward the Seventh '', E.P.

Nicholas and his other family members bore witness to Alexander II's death, having been present at the [[Winter Palace]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], where he was brought after the attack.<ref>[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 38</ref> For security reasons, the new Tsar and his family relocated their primary residence to the [[Gatchina Palace]] outside the city, only entering the capital for various ceremonial functions. On such occasions, Alexander III and his family occupied the nearby [[Anichkov Palace]].\n\n[[File:Prince Nicolas at Nagasaki.jpg|thumb|Tsarevich Nicholas in Japan (1891)]]\n\nIn 1884, Nicholas's coming-of-age ceremony was held at the Winter Palace, where he pledged his loyalty to his father. Later that year, Nicholas's uncle, [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich]], married [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna|Princess Elizabeth]], daughter of [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse]] and his late wife [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]] (who had died in 1878), and a granddaughter of [[Queen Victoria]]. At the wedding in St. Petersburg, the sixteen-year-old [[Tsarevich]] met with and admired the bride's youngest surviving sister, twelve-year-old [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Princess Alix]]. Those feelings of admiration blossomed into love following her visit to St. Petersburg five years later in 1889. Alix had feelings for him in turn. As a devout Lutheran, she was initially reluctant to convert to Russian Orthodoxy in order to marry Nicholas, but later relented.<ref>[[#King1994|King (1994)]] p. 54</ref>\n\nIn 1890 Nicholas, [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|his younger brother George]], and their cousin [[Prince George of Greece and Denmark|Prince George of Greece]], set out on a [[Eastern journey of Nicholas II|world tour]], although Grand Duke George fell ill and was sent home partway through the trip. Nicholas visited Egypt, India, Singapore, and Bangkok, receiving honors as a distinguished guest in each country. In April 1891, in the city of [[\u014ctsu]], Japan, Nicholas was [[\u014ctsu incident|attacked by a deranged Japanese police officer]]. The incident cut his trip short. Some historians have speculated on how the incident may have later influenced his opinion of Japan and the Japanese.<ref name=\"kowner\"/> Returning overland to St. Petersburg, he was present at the ceremonies in [[Vladivostok]] commemorating the beginning of work on the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. In 1893, Nicholas traveled to London on behalf of his parents to be present at the wedding of his cousin [[George V|the Duke of York]] to [[Princess Mary of Teck]]. Queen Victoria was struck by the physical resemblance between the two cousins, and their appearances confused some at the wedding. During this time, Nicholas had an affair with St. Petersburg ballerina [[Mathilde Kschessinska]].<ref>Kshessinska 1960. ''Dancing in Petersburg''. London, transl Haskell.{{page needed|date=January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThough Nicholas was heir-apparent to the throne, his father failed to prepare him for his future role as Tsar. He attended meetings of the [[State Council (Russian Empire)|State Council]]; however, as his father was only in his forties, it was expected that it would be many years before Nicholas succeeded to the throne.<ref>[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 40</ref> [[Sergei Witte]], Russia's finance minister, saw things differently and suggested to the Tsar that Nicholas be appointed to the Siberian Railway Committee.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Pierre, Andre (1925) ''Journal Intime de Nicholas II'', Paris: Payot, p. 45</ref> Alexander argued that Nicholas was not mature enough to take on serious responsibilities, to which Witte replied that if Nicholas was not introduced to state affairs, he would never be ready to understand them.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Alexander's assumptions that he would live a long life and had years to prepare Nicholas for becoming Tsar proved wrong, as by 1894, Alexander's health was failing.<ref>{{cite news |title=THE HEALTH OF THE CZAR |work=[[Western Daily Press]] |date=15 February 1894 |accessdate=10 March 2016 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000264/18940215/015/0005| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n==Engagement, accession and marriage==\n{{see also|Wedding of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna|}}\n[[File:Engagement official picture of Alexandra and Nicholas.jpg|thumb|upright|Official engagement photograph of Nicholas II and Alexandra, April 1894]]\n\nIn April 1894, Nicholas joined his Uncle [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Sergei]] and Aunt [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna|Elizabeth]] on a journey to Coburg, Germany, for the wedding of Elizabeth's and Alix's brother, [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], to their mutual first cousin [[Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. Other guests included [[Queen Victoria]], [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], the [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Empress Frederick]] (Kaiser Wilhelm's mother and Queen Victoria's eldest daughter), Nicholas's uncle, the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales]], and the bride's parents, [[Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke]] and [[Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia|Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].\n\nOnce in Coburg Nicholas proposed to Alix, but she rejected his proposal, being reluctant to convert to Orthodoxy. But the Kaiser later told her she had a duty to marry Nicholas and to convert, as her sister Elizabeth had voluntarily done in 1892. Thus Nicholas and Alix became officially engaged on 20 April 1894. Nicholas's parents initially hesitated to give the engagement their blessing, as Alix had made poor impressions during her visits to Russia. They gave their consent only when they saw Tsar Alexander's health deteriorating.\n\nThat summer, Nicholas travelled to England to visit both Alix and the Queen. The visit coincided with the birth of [[George V|the Duke]] and [[Mary of Teck|Duchess of York]]'s first child, the future [[King Edward VIII]]. Along with being present at the christening, Nicholas and Alix were listed among the child's godparents.<ref>[[#King1994|King (1994)]] p. 70</ref> After several weeks in England, Nicholas returned home for the wedding of his sister, [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Xenia]], to a cousin, [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia|Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich]] (\"Sandro\").<ref>{{cite news |title=The Czarewitch |work=[[St James's Gazette]] |date=30 July 1894 |accessdate=11 March 2016 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001485/18940730/041/0008| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n[[File:1904-1905peterhof.jpg|thumb|left|Nicholas II and family]]\n\nBy that autumn, Alexander III lay dying.

While Alexandra enjoyed her reunion with her grandmother, Nicholas complained in a letter to his mother about being forced to go shooting with his uncle, the Prince of Wales, in bad weather, and was suffering from a bad toothache.<ref>King, Greg (2007) ''Twilight of Splendor: the Court of Queen Victoria in Her Diamond Jubilee Year '', John Wiley & Sons, pp. 173\u2013175</ref>\n\n[[File:Imperial Monogram of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Imperial monogram]]\n\nThe first years of his reign saw little more than continuation and development of the policy pursued by [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]. Nicholas allotted money for the [[All-Russia exhibition 1896|All-Russia exhibition of 1896]]. In 1897 restoration of [[gold standard]] by [[Sergei Witte]], Minister of Finance, completed the series of financial reforms, initiated fifteen years earlier. By 1902 the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] was nearing completion; this helped the Russians trade in the Far East but the railway still required huge amounts of work.\n\n===Ecclesiastical affairs===\nNicholas always believed God chose him to be the tsar and therefore the decisions of the tsar reflected the will of God and could not be disputed. He was convinced that the simple people of Russia understood this and loved him, as demonstrated by the display of affection he perceived when he made public appearances. His old-fashioned belief made for a very stubborn ruler who rejected constitutional limitations on his power. It put the tsar at variance with the emerging political consensus among the Russian elite. It was further belied by the subordinate position of the Church in the bureaucracy. The result was a new distrust between the tsar and the church hierarchy and between those hierarchs and the people. Thereby the tsar's base of support was conflicted.<ref>Sergei L. Firsov,\"Emperor Nicholas II as an Orthodox Tsar\" ''Russian Studies in History'' 50.4 (2012): 79-90.</ref>\n\nIn 1903, Nicholas threw himself into an ecclesiastical crisis regarding the [[canonisation]] of [[Seraphim of Sarov]]. The previous year, it had been suggested that if he were canonised, the imperial couple would beget a son and heir to throne. While Alexandra demanded in July 1902 that Seraphim be canonised in less than a week, Nicholas demanded that he be canonised within a year. Despite a public outcry, the Church bowed to the intense imperial pressure, declaring Seraphim worthy of canonisation in January 1903. That summer, the imperial family travelled to Sarov for the canonisation.<ref>[[#King2006|King (2006)]] p. 137</ref>\n\n===Initiatives in foreign affairs===\n\nAccording to his biographer:\n: His tolerance if not preference for charlatans and adventurers extended to grave matters of external policy, and his vacillating conduct and erratic decisions aroused misgivings and occasional alarm among his more conventional advisers. The foreign ministry itself was not a bastion of diplomatic expertise. Patronage and \"connections\" were the keys to appointment and promotion.<ref>Robert D. Warth, ''Nicholas II: The Life and Reign of Russia's Last Monarch'' (1997) p 47.</ref>\n\nEmperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] of Austria-Hungary paid a state visit in April 1897 that was a success. It produced a \"gentlemen's agreement\" to keep the status quo in the Balkans, and a somewhat similar commitment became applicable to Constantinople and the Straits. The result was years of peace that allowed for rapid economic growth.<ref>Warth, ''Nicholas II'' p 49.</ref>\n\n[[File:Faure Loubet Carnot Alexandre Nicolas Grandes manoeuvres de l'est 1901 carte postale.JPG|thumb|Souvenir postcard of the [[French maneuvers of 1901]] attended by Nicholas II and Alexandra]]\nNicholas followed the policies of his father, strengthening the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] and pursuing a policy of general European pacification, which culminated in the famous [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague peace conference]]. This conference, suggested and promoted by Nicholas II, was convened with the view of terminating the [[arms race]], and setting up machinery for the peaceful settlement of international disputes.

Russia had expanded in the Far East, and the growth of its settlement and territorial ambitions, as its southward path to the [[Balkans]] was frustrated, conflicted with Japan's own territorial ambitions on the Chinese and Asian mainland. Nicholas pursued an aggressive foreign policy with regards to [[Manchuria]] and [[Korea]], and strongly supported the scheme for timber concessions in these areas as developed by the [[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Bezobrazov|Bezobazov group]].<ref name=\"Kowner\">Kowner, '' Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War'', p. 260-264.</ref><ref>Raymond A.

The United Kingdom would not allow the Russian navy to use the [[Suez Canal]], due to [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance|its alliance]] with the Empire of Japan, and due to the [[Dogger Bank incident]] where the Baltic Fleet mistakenly fired on British fishing boats in the North Sea. The Russian [[Baltic Fleet]] traversed the world to lift the blockade on Port Arthur, but after many misadventures on the way, was nearly annihilated by the Japanese in the [[Battle of Tsushima|Battle of the Tsushima Strait]].<ref name=\"Kowner\" /> On land the [[Imperial Russian Army]] experienced logistical problems. While commands and supplies came from [[St. Petersburg]], combat took place in east Asian ports with only the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] for transport of supplies as well as troops both ways.<ref name=\"Kowner\" /> The {{convert|9200|km|mi|adj=on}} rail line between St. Petersburg and Port Arthur was single-track, with no track around [[Lake Baikal]], allowing only gradual build-up of the forces on the front.

Nicholas's mother, as well as his cousin [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II]], urged Nicholas to negotiate for peace. Despite the efforts, Nicholas remained evasive, sending a telegram to the Kaiser on 10 October that it was his intent to keep on fighting until the Japanese were driven from Manchuria.<ref name=\"Kowner\" /> It was not until 27\u201328 May 1905 and the annihilation of the Russian fleet by the Japanese, that Nicholas finally decided to sue for peace.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyisnowmagazine.com/blog/2018/12/2/the-last-tsar-tsar-nicholas-ii-of-russia-protect-us-lord-for-we-reign-too-young|title=The Last Tsar \u2013 Tsar Nicholas II of Russia: Protect us Lord, for We Reign Too Young|website=History is Now Magazine, Podcasts, Blog and Books {{!}} Modern International and American history|language=en-US|access-date=29 May 2019}}</ref> Nicholas II accepted American mediation, appointing [[Sergei Witte]] chief plenipotentiary for the peace talks.

He saw the war as an easy god-given victory that would raise Russian morale and patriotism. He ignored the financial repercussions of a long-distance war.<ref>[[#Warth|Warth]], p. 67</ref> Rotem Kowner, argues that during his visit to Japan in 1891, where Nicholas was [[\u014ctsu incident|attacked]] by a Japanese policeman, he regarded the Japanese as small of stature, feminine, weak, and inferior. He ignored reports of the prowess of Japanese soldiers in the Sino-Japanese War (1894\u201395) and reports on the capabilities of the Japanese fleet, as well as negative reports on the lack of readiness of Russian forces.<ref name=\"kowner\">Rotem Kowner, \"Nicholas II and the Japanese body: Images and decision-making on the eve of the Russo-Japanese War.\" ''Psychohistory Review'' (1998) 26#3 pp 211-252.

Despite the onset of the war and the many defeats Russia suffered, Nicholas still believed in, and expected, a final victory, maintaining an image of the racial inferiority and military weakness of the Japanese.<ref>Kowner (1998)</ref> Throughout the war, the tsar demonstrated total confidence in Russia's ultimate triumph. His advisors never gave him a clear picture of Russia's weaknesses. Despite the continuous military disasters Nicholas believed victory was near at hand. Losing his navy at Tsushima finally persuaded him to agree to peace negotiations. Even then he insisted on the option of reopening hostilities if peace conditions were unfavorable. He forbade his chief negotiator Count Witte to agree to either indemnity payments or loss of territory. Nicholas remained adamantly opposed to any concessions. Peace was made, but Witte did so by disobeying the tsar and ceding southern Sakhalin to Japan.<ref>Raymond A.

On Saturday, 8 (21) January, the ministers convened to consider the situation. There was never any thought that the Tsar, who had left the capital for Tsarskoye Selo on the advice of the ministers, would actually meet Gapon; the suggestion that some other member of the imperial family receive the petition was rejected.<ref name=\"Massie, R p. 124\">[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 124</ref>\n\nFinally informed by the Prefect of Police that he lacked the men to pluck Gapon from among his followers and place him under arrest, the newly appointed Minister of the Interior, Prince [[Pyotr Dmitrievich Sviatopolk-Mirsky|Sviatopolk-Mirsky]], and his colleagues decided to bring additional troops to reinforce the city. That evening Nicholas wrote in his diary, \"Troops have been brought from the outskirts to reinforce the garrison. Up to now the workers have been calm. Their number is estimated at 120,000.

Locking arms, the workers [[Nonviolent resistance|marched peacefully]] through the streets. Some carried religious icons and banners, as well as national flags and portraits of the Tsar. As they walked, they sang hymns and ''[[God Save the Tsar!|God Save The Tsar]]''. At 2{{nbsp}}pm all of the converging processions were scheduled to arrive at the Winter Palace. There was no single confrontation with the troops.

In the [[October Manifesto]], the Tsar pledged to introduce basic [[civil liberties]], provide for broad participation in the State Duma, and endow the Duma with legislative and oversight powers. He was determined, however, to preserve his [[autocracy]] even in the context of reform. This was signalled in the text of the [[Russian Constitution of 1906|1906 constitution]]. He was described as the supreme autocrat, and retained sweeping executive powers, also in church affairs. His cabinet ministers were not allowed to interfere with nor assist one another; they were responsible only to him.\n\nNicholas's relations with the Duma were poor. The [[First Duma]], with a majority of [[Constitutional Democratic party|Kadets]], almost immediately came into conflict with him. Scarcely had the 524 members sat down at the [[Tauride Palace]] when they formulated an 'Address to the Throne'. It demanded [[universal suffrage]], radical land reform, the release of all [[political prisoner]]s and the dismissal of ministers appointed by the Tsar in favour of ministers acceptable to the Duma.<ref>[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 243</ref> Grand Duchess Olga, Nicholas's sister, later wrote:\n\n{{quote|There was such gloom at Tsarskoye Selo.

The Duma was populated with [[Political radicalism|radicals]], many of whom wished to push through legislation that would abolish private property ownership, among other things. Witte, unable to grasp the seemingly insurmountable problems of reforming Russia and the monarchy, wrote to Nicholas on 14 April 1906 resigning his office (however, other accounts have said that Witte was forced to resign by the Emperor). Nicholas was not ungracious to Witte and an Imperial Rescript was published on 22 April creating Witte a Knight of the [[Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky]] with diamonds (the last two words were written in the Emperor's own hand, followed by \"I remain unalterably well-disposed to you and sincerely grateful, for ever more Nicholas.\").\n\nA second Duma met for the first time in February 1907. The [[leftist]] parties\u2014including the [[Social Democrats]] and the Social Revolutionaries, who had boycotted the First Duma\u2014had won 200 seats in the Second, more than a third of the membership. Again Nicholas waited impatiently to rid himself of the Duma. In two letters to his mother he let his bitterness flow:\n\n{{quote|A grotesque deputation is coming from England to see liberal members of the Duma.

Stolypin, a skilful politician, had ambitious plans for reform. These included making loans available to the lower classes to enable them to buy land, with the intent of forming a farming class loyal to the crown. Nevertheless, when the Duma remained hostile, Stolypin had no qualms about invoking Article 87 of the [[Russian Constitution of 1906|Fundamental Laws]], which empowered the Tsar to issue 'urgent and extraordinary' emergency decrees 'during the recess of the State Duma'. Stolypin's most famous legislative act, the change in peasant land tenure, was promulgated under Article 87.<ref name=\"massie245\" />\n\nThe third Duma remained an independent body. This time the members proceeded cautiously. Instead of hurling themselves at the government, opposing parties within the Duma worked to develop the body as a whole. In the classic manner of the British Parliament, the Duma reached for power grasping for the national purse strings. The Duma had the right to question ministers behind closed doors as to their proposed expenditures. These sessions, endorsed by Stolypin, were educational for both sides, and, in time, mutual antagonism was replaced by mutual respect. Even the sensitive area of military expenditure, where the October Manifesto clearly had reserved decisions to the throne, a Duma commission began to operate. Composed of aggressive patriots no less anxious than Nicholas to restore the fallen honour of Russian arms, the Duma commission frequently recommended expenditures even larger than those proposed.\n\nWith the passage of time, Nicholas also began to have confidence in the Duma. \"This Duma cannot be reproached with an attempt to seize power and there is no need at all to quarrel with it,\" he said to Stolypin in 1909.<ref name=\"massie246\">[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 246</ref> Nevertheless, Stolypin's plans were undercut by conservatives at court. Although the tsar at first supported him, he finally sided with the arch critics.<ref>Mikhail F. Florinskii, \"Nicholas II and Stolypin's Cabinet\" ''Russian Social Science Review'' 53.4 (2012): 4-14.</ref> Reactionaries such as Prince [[Vladimir Nikolayevich Orlov]] never tired of telling the tsar that the very existence of the Duma was a blot on the autocracy. Stolypin, they whispered, was a traitor and secret revolutionary who was conniving with the Duma to steal the prerogatives assigned the Tsar by God. Witte also engaged in constant intrigue against Stolypin. Although Stolypin had had nothing to do with Witte's fall, Witte blamed him. Stolypin had unwittingly angered the Tsaritsa. He had ordered an investigation into Rasputin and presented it to the Tsar, who read it but did nothing. Stolypin, on his own authority, ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg. Alexandra protested vehemently but Nicholas refused to overrule his Prime Minister,<ref name=\"massie247\">[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 247.</ref> who had more influence with the Emperor.\n\nBy the time of Stolypin's assassination in September 1911, Stolypin had grown weary of the burdens of office. For a man who preferred clear decisive action, working with a sovereign who believed in fatalism and mysticism was frustrating. As an example, Nicholas once returned a document unsigned with the note:\n\n{{quote|Despite most convincing arguments in favour of adopting a positive decision in this matter, an inner voice keeps on insisting more and more that I do not accept responsibility for it. So far my conscience has not deceived me. Therefore I intend in this case to follow its dictates. I know that you, too, believe that \"a Tsar's heart is in God's hands.\" Let it be so. For all laws established by me I bear a great responsibility before God, and I am ready to answer for my decision at any time.<ref name=\"massie247\" />}}\n\n[[File:Rasputin PA.jpg|thumb|[[Grigori Rasputin]]]]\n\nAlexandra, believing that Stolypin had severed the bonds that her son depended on for life, hated the Prime Minister.<ref name=\"massie247\" /> In March 1911, in a fit of anger stating that he no longer commanded the imperial confidence, Stolypin asked to be relieved of his office. Two years earlier when Stolypin had casually mentioned resigning to Nicholas he was informed: \"This is not a question of confidence or lack of it. It is my will. Remember that we live in Russia, not abroad...and therefore I shall not consider the possibility of any resignation.\"<ref>[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 248</ref> He was assassinated in September 1911.\n\nIn 1912, a fourth Duma was elected with almost the same membership as the third. \"The Duma started too fast. Now it is slower, but better, and more lasting,\" stated Nicholas to Sir [[Bernard Pares]].<ref name=\"massie246\" />\n\nThe [[World War I|First World War]] developed badly for Russia. By late 1916, Romanov family desperation reached the point that [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich]], younger brother of Alexander III and the Tsar's only surviving uncle, was deputed to beg Nicholas to grant a constitution and a government responsible to the Duma. Nicholas sternly and adamantly refused, reproaching his uncle for asking him to break his coronation oath to maintain autocratic power for his successors. In the Duma on 2 December 1916, Vladimir Purishkevich, a fervent patriot, monarchist and war worker, denounced the dark forces which surrounded the throne in a thunderous two-hour speech which was tumultuously applauded. \"Revolution threatens,\" he warned, \"and an obscure peasant shall govern Russia no longer!\"<ref>[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 49.</ref>\n\n===Tsarevich Alexei's illness and Rasputin===\n[[File:Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia.jpg|left|thumb|Alexei in 1913]]\n\nFurther complicating domestic matters was the matter of the succession. Alexandra bore Nicholas four daughters, [[Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia|the Grand Duchess Olga]] in 1895, [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia|the Grand Duchess Tatiana]] in 1897, [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Maria]] in 1899, and [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia]] in 1901, before their son [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Alexei]] was born on 12 August 1904. The young heir was afflicted with [[Haemophilia B]], a hereditary disease that prevents blood from clotting properly, which at that time was untreatable and usually led to an untimely death. As a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, Alexandra carried the same [[gene mutation]] that afflicted several of the major European royal houses, such as [[Prussia]] and Spain. Hemophilia, therefore, became known as \"[[Haemophilia in European royalty|the royal disease]]\". Through Alexandra, the disease had passed on to her son. As all of Nicholas and Alexandra's daughters were murdered with their parents and brother in Yekaterinburg in 1918, it is not known whether any of them inherited the gene as [[genetic carrier|carriers]].\n\nBefore Rasputin's arrival, the tsarina and the tsar had consulted numerous mystics, charlatans, \"holy fools,\" and miracle workers. The royal behavior was not some odd aberration, but a deliberate retreat from the secular social and economic forces of his time - an act of faith and vote of confidence in a spiritual past. They had set themselves up for the greatest spiritual advisor and manipulator in Russian history.<ref>Robert D. Warth,\"Before Rasputin: Piety and the Occult at the Court of Nicholas II.\" ''Historian'' 47.3 (1985): 323-337.</ref>\n\nBecause of the fragility of the autocracy at this time, Nicholas and Alexandra chose to keep secret Alexei's condition. Even within the household, many were unaware of the exact nature of the Tsarevich's illness. At first Alexandra turned to Russian doctors and medics to treat Alexei; however, their treatments generally failed, and Alexandra increasingly turned to [[mysticism|mystic]]s and holy men (or ''[[starets]]'' as they were called in Russian). One of these starets, an illiterate Siberian named [[Grigori Rasputin]], gained amazing success. Rasputin's influence over Empress Alexandra, and consequently the Tsar himself, grew even stronger after 1912 when the Tsarevich nearly died from an injury. His bleeding grew steadily worse as doctors despaired, and priests administered the [[last rites|Last Sacrament]]. In desperation, Alexandra called upon Rasputin, to which he replied, \"God has seen your tears and heard your prayers. Do not grieve. The Little One will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much.\"<ref>[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 185</ref> The haemorrhage stopped the very next day and the boy began to recover. Alexandra took this as a sign that Rasputin was a ''starets'' and that God was with him; for the rest of her life she would fervently defend him and turn her wrath against anyone who dared to question him.\n\n===European affairs===\n[[File:Nicholas II and Alexei in Reval 1908.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Nicholas II and his son Alexei aboard the Imperial yacht ''[[Russian yacht Standart|Standart]]'', during King [[Edward VII]]'s state visit to Russia in [[Tallinn|Reval]], 1908]]\n\nIn 1907, to end longstanding controversies over central Asia, Russia and the United Kingdom signed the [[Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907|Anglo-Russian Convention]] that resolved most of the problems generated for decades by [[The Great Game]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Klein, Ira |title=The Anglo-Russian Convention and the Problem of Central Asia, 1907\u20131914|journal=Journal of British Studies|year=1971|volume=11|issue=1|pages=126\u2013147 |jstor=175041|doi=10.1086/385621}}</ref> The UK had already entered into the [[Entente cordiale]] with France in 1904, and the Anglo-Russian convention led to the formation of the [[Triple Entente]]. The following year, in May 1908, Nicholas and Alexandra's shared \"Uncle Bertie\" and \"Aunt Alix,\" Britain's King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, made a state visit to Russia, being the first reigning British monarchs to do so. However, they did not set foot on Russian soil. Instead, they stayed aboard their yachts, meeting off the coast of modern-day [[Tallinn]]. Later that year, Nicholas was taken off guard by the news that his foreign minister, [[Alexander Izvolsky]], had entered into a secret agreement with the Austro-Hungarian foreign minister, [[Count Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal|Count Alois von Aehrenthal]], agreeing that, in exchange for Russian naval access to the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Bosporus Strait]], Russia would not oppose the Austrian annexation of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], a revision of the 1878 [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]. When Austria-Hungary did annex this territory that October, it precipitated the [[Bosnian crisis|diplomatic crisis]]. When Russia protested about the annexation, the Austrians threatened to leak secret communications between Izvolsky and Aehernthal, prompting Nicholas to complain in a letter to the Austrian emperor, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], about a breach of confidence. In 1909, in the wake of the Anglo-Russian convention, the Russian imperial family made a visit to England, staying on the [[Isle of Wight]] for [[Cowes Week]]. In 1913, during the [[Balkan War (1912\u201313)|Balkan Wars]], Nicholas personally offered to arbitrate between Serbia and Bulgaria. However, the Bulgarians rejected his offer. Also in 1913, Nicholas, albeit without Alexandra, made a visit to Berlin for the wedding of Kaiser Wilhelm II's daughter, [[Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia|Princess Victoria Louise]], to a maternal cousin of Nicholas, [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick|Ernest Augustus, the Duke of Brunswick]].<ref>Clay, Catarine (2006) ''King, Kaiser, Tsar: Three Royal Cousins Who Led the World to War'', Walker & Company, {{ISBN|0802716237}}, pp. 300\u2013301</ref> Nicholas was also joined by his cousin, [[King George V]] and his wife, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].\n\n===Tercentenary===\n{{Main|Romanov Tercentenary}}\nIn February 1913, Nicholas presided over the [[Romanov Tercentenary|tercentenary celebrations for the Romanov Dynasty]].

The outbreak of war was not inevitable, but leaders, diplomats and nineteenth-century alliances created a climate for large-scale conflict. The concept of [[Pan-Slavism]] and shared religion created strong public sympathy between Russia and Serbia. Territorial conflict created rivalries between [[German Empire|Germany]] and France and between Austria-Hungary and [[Serbia]], and as a consequence alliance networks developed across Europe. The [[Triple Entente]] and [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] networks were set before the war. Nicholas wanted neither to abandon Serbia to the ultimatum of Austria, nor to provoke a general war. In a series of letters exchanged with [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm]] of Germany (the \"[[Willy\u2013Nicky correspondence]]\") the two proclaimed their desire for peace, and each attempted to get the other to back down. Nicholas desired that Russia's mobilization be only against Austria-Hungary, in the hopes of preventing war with Germany.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R43302, Kaiser Wilhelm II. und Zar Nikolaus II..jpg|thumb|Nicholas II (right) with [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] of Germany in 1905.

He put the Russian army on \"alert\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Merriman, John (2009) ''A History of Modern Europe Volume Two'', W. W. Norton & Company, {{ISBN|0393933857}}, p. 967</ref> on 25 July. Although this was not general mobilization, it threatened the German and Austro-Hungarian borders and looked like military preparation for war.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> However, his army had no contingency plans for a partial mobilization, and on 30 July 1914 Nicholas took the fateful step of confirming the order for general mobilization, despite being strongly counselled against it.\n\nOn 28 July, Austria-Hungary formally declared war against Serbia. On 29 July 1914, Nicholas sent a telegram to Wilhelm with the suggestion to submit the Austro-Serbian problem to the [[Hague Conference]] (in [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|Hague tribunal]]). Wilhelm did not address the question of the Hague Conference in his subsequent reply.<ref>[[Hew Strachan]], ''The First World War, Vol I: To Arms'' (2001), p. 85</ref><ref>Hamilton, Richard F. and Herwig, Holger H.

Germany, reacting to the discovery of partial mobilization ordered on 25 July, announced its own pre-mobilization posture, the Imminent Danger of War. Germany requested that Russia demobilize within the next twelve hours.<ref>{{cite web|author=Josef und Ulli |url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Rhodes/6916/ww1.htm |title=Germany during World War One |date= |accessdate=7 September 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018191920/http://geocities.com/Athens/Rhodes/6916/ww1.htm|archivedate=18 October 2009 }}</ref> In [[Saint Petersburg]], at 7pm, with the ultimatum to Russia having expired, the German ambassador to Russia met with the Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Sazonov]], asked three times if Russia would reconsider, and then with shaking hands, delivered the note accepting Russia's war challenge and declaring war on 1 August. Less than a week later, on 6 August, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] signed the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Russia.\n\nThe outbreak of war on 1 August 1914 found Russia grossly unprepared. Russia and her allies placed their faith in her army, the famous 'Russian steamroller'.<ref name=\"tames42\">[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 42</ref> Its pre-war regular strength was 1,400,000; mobilization added 3,100,000 reserves and millions more stood ready behind them. In every other respect, however, Russia was unprepared for war. Germany had ten times as much railway track per square mile, and whereas Russian soldiers travelled an average of {{convert|1290|km|mi|-1}} to reach the front, German soldiers traveled less than a quarter of that distance. Russian heavy industry was still too small to equip the massive armies the Tsar could raise, and her reserves of munitions were pitifully small; while the German army in 1914 was better equipped than any other, man-for-man, the Russians were severely short on artillery pieces, shells, motorized transports, and even boots. With the Baltic Sea barred by German U-boats and the Dardanelles by the guns of Germany's ally, the [[Ottoman Empire]], Russia initially could receive help only via [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]], which was frozen solid in winter, or via [[Vladivostok]], which was over {{convert|6400|km|mi}} from the front line. By 1915, a rail line was built north from [[Petrozavodsk]] to the Kola Gulf and this connection laid the foundation of the ice-free port of what eventually was called [[Murmansk]]. The Russian High Command was moreover greatly weakened by the mutual contempt between [[Vladimir Sukhomlinov]], the Minister of War, and the incompetent Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolayevich who commanded the armies in the field.<ref>Paul Robinson, Paul. \"A Study of Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich as Supreme Commander of the Russian Army, 1914\u20131915.\" ''Historian'' 75.3 (2013): 475-498. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24456116 online]</ref> In spite of all of this, an immediate attack was ordered against the German province of [[East Prussia]]. The Germans mobilised there with great efficiency and completely defeated the two Russian armies which had invaded. The [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]], where an entire Russian army was annihilated, cast an ominous shadow over Russia's future. Russia had great success against both the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman armies from the very beginning of the war, but they never succeeded against the might of the German Army. In September 1914, in order to relieve pressure on France, the Russians were forced to halt a successful offensive against Austria-Hungary in Galicia in order to attack German-held Silesia.<ref>Massie, Robert K.

General Denikin, retreating from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] wrote, \"The German heavy artillery swept away whole lines of trenches, and their defenders with them. We hardly replied. There was nothing with which we could reply. Our regiments, although completely exhausted, were beating off one attack after another by bayonet ...

At first, the targets were German, and for three days in June shops, bakeries, factories, private houses and country estates belonging to people with German names were looted and burned.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. The inflamed mobs then turned on the government, declaring the Empress should be shut up in a convent, the Tsar deposed and Rasputin hanged. Nicholas was by no means deaf to these discontents. An emergency session of the Duma was summoned and a Special Defense Council established, its members drawn from the Duma and the Tsar's ministers.\n\nIn July 1915, King [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]] of [[Denmark]], first cousin of the Tsar, sent [[Hans Niels Andersen]] to Tsarskoye Selo with an offer to act as a mediator. He made several trips between London, Berlin and Petrograd and in July saw the Dowager Empress [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Fyodorovna]]. Andersen told her they should conclude peace. Nicholas chose to turn down King Christian's offer of mediation, as he felt it would be a betrayal for Russia to form a separate peace treaty with the Central Powers when its allies Britain and France were still fighting.<ref>Hall, C (2006) ''Little Mother of Russia'', Holmes and Meier, {{ISBN|0841914222}}, p. 264</ref>\n\nThe energetic and efficient General [[Alexei Polivanov]] replaced Sukhomlinov as [[Minister of War]], which failed to improve the strategic situation.<ref name=\"tames42\" /> In the aftermath of the [[Great Retreat (Russia)|Great Retreat]] and the loss of the Kingdom of [[Poland]], Nicholas assumed the role of commander-in-chief after dismissing his cousin, Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolayevich, in September 1915. This was a mistake, as the Tsar came to be personally associated with the continuing losses at the front. He was also away at the remote HQ at [[Mogilev]], far from the direct governance of the empire, and when revolution broke out in [[Petrograd]] he was unable to halt it. In reality the move was largely symbolic, since all important military decisions were made by his chief-of-staff General [[Michael Alexeiev]], and Nicholas did little more than review troops, inspect [[field hospital]]s, and preside over military luncheons.<ref>King, Greg and Wilson, Penny (2003) ''The Fate of the Romanovs'', John Wiley & Sons, {{ISBN|0471207683}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nicholas II with his family in Yevpatoria.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Nicholas II with his family in [[Yevpatoria]], [[Crimea]], May 1916]]\n\nThe Duma was still calling for political reforms and political unrest continued throughout the war. Cut off from public opinion, Nicholas could not see that the dynasty was tottering. With Nicholas at the front, domestic issues and control of the capital were left with his wife Alexandra. However, Alexandra's relationship with [[Grigori Rasputin]], and her German background, further discredited the dynasty's authority. Nicholas had been repeatedly warned about the destructive influence of Rasputin but had failed to remove him. Rumors and accusations about Alexandra and Rasputin appeared one after another; Alexandra was even accused of harboring treasonous sympathies towards Germany. Anger at Nicholas's failure to act and the extreme damage that Rasputin's influence was doing to Russia's war effort and to the monarchy led to Rasputin's eventual murder by a group of nobles, led by Prince [[Felix Yusupov]] and [[Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich]], a cousin of the Tsar, in the early morning of Saturday 17 December 1916 ([[Old Style|O.S.]]) / 30 December 1916 ([[New Style|N.S.]]).\n\n===Collapse===\n[[File:\u0417\u0430\u0441\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0438 \u0412\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0433\u043e. \u041c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0432. 1 \u0430\u043f\u0440.1916.jpg|thumb|right|Nicholas with members of the Stavka at Mogilev in April 1916.]]\nAs the government failed to produce supplies, mounting hardship resulted in massive riots and rebellions. With Nicholas away at the front from 1915 through 1916, authority appeared to collapse and the capital was left in the hands of strikers and mutineering soldiers. Despite efforts by the British Ambassador [[George Buchanan (diplomat)|Sir George Buchanan]] to warn the Tsar that he should grant constitutional reforms to fend off revolution, Nicholas continued to bury himself away at the Staff HQ ([[Stavka]]) {{convert|600|km|mi|-2}} away at [[Mogilev|Moghilev]], leaving his capital and court open to intrigues and insurrection.<ref name=\"tames52\">[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 52</ref>\n\nIdeologically the tsar's greatest support came from the right-wing monarchists, who had recently gained strength.

In February 1917, 1,200 locomotives burst their boilers and nearly 60,000 wagons were immobilized. In Petrograd, supplies of flour and fuel had all but disappeared.<ref name=\"tames52\" /> War-time [[prohibition of alcohol]] was enacted by Nicholas to boost patriotism and productivity, but instead damaged the treasury and funding of the war due to the treasury now being deprived of alcohol taxes.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[[#Warth|Warth]], p. 199</ref>\n\nOn 23 February 1917 in Petrograd, a combination of very severe cold weather and acute food shortages caused people to start to break shop windows to get bread and other necessities.

The Tsar, 800 kilometres (500&nbsp;mi) away, was misinformed by the Minister of the Interior, [[Alexander Protopopov]], that the situation was under control, and he ordered that firm steps be taken against the demonstrators. For this task, the Petrograd garrison was quite unsuitable. The cream of the old regular army had been destroyed in [[Poland]] and Galicia. In Petrograd, 170,000 recruits, country boys or older men from the working-class suburbs of the capital itself, remained to keep control under the command of wounded officers invalided from the front and cadets from the military academies. The units in the capital, although many bore the names of famous Imperial Guard regiments, were in reality rear or reserve battalions of these regiments, the regular units being away at the front. Many units, lacking both officers and rifles, had never undergone formal training.<ref name=\"tames53\" />\n\nGeneral Khabalov attempted to put the Tsar's instructions into effect on the morning of Sunday, 11 March 1917. Despite huge posters ordering people to keep off the streets, vast crowds gathered and were only dispersed after some 200 had been shot dead, though a company of the [[Volinsky Regiment]] fired into the air rather than into the mob, and a company of the [[Pavlovsky Regiment|Pavlovsky Life Guards]] shot the officer who gave the command to open fire. Nicholas, informed of the situation by Rodzianko, ordered reinforcements to the capital and suspended the Duma.<ref name=\"tames53\" /> However, it was too late.\n\nOn 12 March, the [[Volinsky Regiment]] mutinied and was quickly followed by the [[Semenovsky Regiment|Semenovsky]], the [[Izmaylovsky Regiment|Ismailovsky]], the [[:fr:R\u00e9giment de la Garde Litovski|Litovsky Life Guards]] and even the legendary [[Preobrazhensky Regiment]] of the Imperial Guard, the oldest and staunchest regiment founded by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]. The arsenal was pillaged, the Ministry of the Interior, Military Government building, police headquarters, the Law Courts and a score of police buildings were put to the torch. By noon, the fortress of Peter and Paul, with its heavy artillery, was in the hands of the insurgents. By nightfall, 60,000 soldiers had joined the revolution.<ref name=\"tames53\" />\n\nOrder broke down and members of the Duma and the [[Soviet (council)#Russian Revolution|Soviet]] formed a [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] to try to restore order. They issued a demand that Nicholas must abdicate. Faced with this demand, which was echoed by his generals, deprived of loyal troops, with his family firmly in the hands of the Provisional Government and fearful of unleashing civil war and opening the way for German conquest, Nicholas had little choice but to submit.\n\n==Revolution==\n===Abdication (1917)===\n{{Main|Abdication of Nicholas II}}\n{{wikisource|Abdication of Nicholas II}}\nNicholas had suffered a [[coronary occlusion]] only four days before his abdication.<ref>Massie, Robert K.

He first abdicated in favor of Alexei, but a few hours later changed his mind after advice from doctors that Alexei would not live long enough while separated from his parents, who would be forced into exile. Nicholas thus abdicated on behalf of his son, and drew up a new manifesto naming his brother, [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael]], as the next Emperor of all the Russians. He issued a statement but it was suppressed by the Provisional Government. Michael declined to accept the throne until the people were allowed to vote through a Constituent Assembly for the continuance of the monarchy or a republic. The abdication of Nicholas II and Michael's deferment of accepting the throne brought three centuries of the Romanov dynasty's rule to an end. The fall of [[Tsarist autocracy]] brought joy to liberals and socialists in Britain and France. The United States was the [[Russian Provisional Government#World recognition|first foreign government]] to recognize the Provisional government. In Russia, the announcement of the Tsar's abdication was greeted with many emotions, including delight, relief, fear, anger and confusion.<ref>[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 55</ref>\n\n===Possibility of exile===\nBoth the Provisional Government and Nicholas wanted the royal family to go into exile following his abdication, with the United Kingdom being the preferred option.<ref>Service 2018, p. 49</ref> The British government reluctantly offered the family [[Right of asylum|asylum]] on 19 March 1917, although it was suggested that it would be better for the Romanovs to go to a neutral country. News of the offer provoked uproar from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and many [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]s, and the British ambassador Sir [[George Buchanan (diplomat)|George Buchanan]] advised the government that the extreme left would use the ex-Tsar's presence \"as an excuse for rousing public opinion against us\".<ref name=\"Massie, Robert K. 1967 p. 461\">Massie, Robert K. ''Nicholas and Alexandra: The Last Tsar and His Family'' (1967) p. 461</ref> The Liberal Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] preferred that the family went to a neutral country, and wanted the offer to be announced as at the request of the Russian government.{{sfn|Rappaport|2018|pp=62,63}} The offer of asylum was withdrawn in April following objections by King [[George V]], who, acting on the advice of his secretary [[Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham]], was worried that Nicholas's presence might provoke an uprising like the previous year's [[Easter Rising]] in Ireland. However, later the king defied his secretary and went to the Romanov memorial service at the Russian Church in London.{{sfn|Welch|2018|p=246}} In the early summer of 1917, the Russian government approached the British government on the issue of asylum and was informed the offer had been withdrawn due to the considerations of British internal politics.<ref>Massie, Robert K.

The Provisional Government only remained in power through an uneasy alliance with the [[Petrograd Soviet]], an arrangement known as \"The [[Dual power|Dual Power]]\". An initial plan to send the royal family to the northern port of [[Murmansk]] had to be abandoned when it was realised that the railway workers and the soldiers guarding them were loyal to the Petrograd Soviet, which opposed the escape of the tsar; a later proposal to send the Romanovs to a neutral port in the [[Baltic Sea]] via the [[Duchy of Finland]] faced similar difficulties.<ref>Service 2018, pp. 51-52 and pp. 68-69</ref>\n\n===Imprisonment===\n[[File:Nikolaus II.

The government feared that further disturbances in the city could easily reach Tsarskoye Selo and it was decided to move the royal family to a safer location.<ref>Service 2018, pp. 70-71</ref> [[Alexander Kerensky]], who had taken over as prime minister, selected the town of [[Tobolsk]] in [[Western Siberia]], since it was remote from any large city and {{convert|150|mi}} from the nearest rail station.<ref>Service 2018, p. 80</ref> Some sources state that there was an intention to send the family abroad in the spring of 1918 via Japan,<ref>Massie, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'' (1967) p. 487</ref> but more recent work suggests that this was just a Bolshevik rumour.<ref>Service 2018, p. 145</ref> The family left the Alexandra Palace late on 13 August, reached [[Tyumen]] by rail four days later and then by two river ferries finally reached Tobolsk on 19 August.<ref>Service 2018, pp. 76-78</ref> There they lived in the former [[Governor's Mansion (Tobolsk, Russia)|Governor's Mansion]] in considerable comfort. In October 1917, however, the [[Bolsheviks]] seized power from Kerensky's Provisional Government; Nicholas followed the events in October with interest but not yet with alarm. [[Boris Soloviev]], the husband of [[Maria Rasputin]], attempted to organize a rescue with monarchical factions, but it came to nothing. Rumors persist that Soloviev was working for the Bolsheviks or the Germans, or both.<ref>Massie, K. ''Nicholas and Alexandra'' (1967) p. 488-492</ref> Separate preparations for a rescue by [[Nikolai Yevgenyevich Markov]] were frustrated by Soloviev's ineffectual activities.<ref>Service 2018, pp. 132-133</ref> Nicholas continued to underestimate [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s importance. In the meantime he and his family occupied themselves with reading books, exercising and playing games; Nicholas particularly enjoyed chopping firewood.<ref>Service 2018, p. 150</ref> However, in January 1918, the guard detachment's committee grew more assertive, restricting the hours that the family could spend in the grounds and banning them from walking to church on a Sunday as they had done since October.<ref>Service 2018, p. 125</ref> In a later incident, the soldiers tore the [[epaulette]]s from Kobylinsky's uniform, and he asked Nicholas not to wear his uniform outside for fear of provoking a similar event.<ref>Service 2018, p. 157</ref>\n\nIn February 1918, the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (abbreviated to \"Sovnarkom\") in Moscow, the new capital, announced that the state subsidy for the family would be drastically reduced, starting on 1 March. This meant parting with twelve devoted servants and giving up butter and coffee as luxuries, even though Nicholas added to the funds from his own resources.<ref>Service 2018, pp. 128-129</ref> Nicholas and Alexandra were appalled by news of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], whereby Russia agreed to give up Poland, Finland, the Baltic States, most of Belarus, the Ukraine, the Crimea, most of the Caucasus, and small parts of Russia proper including areas around [[Pskov]] and [[Rostov-on-Don]].<ref>Massie, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'' (1967) p. 493-494</ref> What kept the family's spirits up was the belief that help was at hand.<ref>[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 62.</ref> The Romanovs believed that various plots were underway to break them out of captivity and smuggle them to safety. The Western Allies lost interest in the fate of the Romanovs after Russia left the war. The German government wanted the monarchy restored in Russia to crush the Bolsheviks and maintain good relations with the Central Powers.<ref>Massie, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'' (1967) p. 502-505</ref> \n\nThe situation in Tobolsk changed for the worse on 26 March, when 250 ill-disciplined [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]] arrived from the regional capital, [[Omsk]]. Not to be outdone, the soviet in [[Yekaterinburg]], the capital of the neighbouring [[Ural (region)|Ural region]], sent 400 Red Guards to exert their influence on the town.<ref>Service 2018, p. 145-148</ref> Disturbances between these rival groups and the lack of funds to pay the guard detachment caused them to send a delegation to Moscow to plead their case. The result was that Sovnarkom appointed their own [[commissar]] to take charge of Tobolsk and remove the Romanovs to Yekaterinburg, with the intention of eventually bringing Nicholas to a [[show trial]] in Moscow.<ref>Service 2018, p. 152-153</ref> The man selected was [[Vasily Yakovlev]], a veteran Bolshevik,<ref>Service 2018, p. 158</ref> Recruiting a body of loyal men ''en route'', Yakovlev arrived in Tobolsk on 22 April; he imposed his authority on the competing Red Guards factions, paid-off and [[Demobilization|demobilized]] the guard detachment, and placed further restrictions on the Romanovs.<ref>Service 2018, p. 160-161</ref> The next day, Yakovlev informed Kobylinsky that Nicholas was to be transferred to Yekaterinburg. Alexei was too ill to travel, so Alexandra elected to go with Nicholas along with Maria, while the other daughters would remain at Tobolsk until they were able to make the journey.<ref>Service 2018, p. 163-165</ref>\n\n====Yekaterinburg====\nAt 3 am on 25 April, the three Romanovs, their retinue, and the escort of Yakovlev's detachment, left Tobolsk in a convoy of nineteen [[tarantass]]es (four-wheeled carriages), as the river was still partly frozen which prevented the use of the ferry.<ref>Service 2018, p. 167</ref> After an arduous journey which included two overnight stops, fording rivers, frequent changes of horses and a foiled plot by the Yekaterinburg Red Guards to abduct and kill the prisoners, the party arrived at Tyumen and boarded a requisitioned train. Yakovlev was able to communicate securely with Moscow by means of a [[David Edward Hughes|Hughes]]' [[teleprinter]] and obtained agreement to change their destination to Omsk, where it was thought that the leadership were less likely to harm the Romanovs.<ref>Service 2018, pp. 170-174</ref> Leaving Tyumen early on 28 April, the train left towards Yekaterinburg, but quickly changed direction towards Omsk. This led the Yekaterinburg leaders to believe that Yakovlev was a traitor who was trying to take Nicholas to exile by way of [[Vladivostok]]; telegraph messages were sent, two thousand armed men were mobilised and a train was dispatched to arrest Yakovlev and the Romanovs. The Romanovs' train was halted at Omsk station and after a frantic exchange of cables with Moscow, it was agreed that they should go to Yekaterinburg in return for a guarantee of safety for the royal family; they finally arrived there on the morning of 30 April.<ref>Service 2018, pp. 179-182</ref>\n\nThey were imprisoned in the two-storey [[Ipatiev House]], the home of the military engineer Nikolay Nikolayevich Ipatiev, which ominously became referred to as the \"house of special purpose\". Here the Romanovs were kept under even stricter conditions; their retinue was further reduced and their possessions were searched.<ref>Service 2018, p. 203-204</ref> The remaining Romanovs left Tobolsk by river steamer on 20 May and arrived in Yekaterinburg three days later.<ref>Service 2018, p. 201</ref> By the first weeks of June, the Bolsheviks were becoming alarmed by the [[Revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion]], whose forces were approaching the city from the east. This prompted a wave of executions of those in the region who were believed to be [[counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]], including [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael]], who was shot in [[Perm]] on 13 June.<ref>Rappaport 2009, p. 38</ref>\n\n=== Execution ===\n{{See also|Execution of the Romanov family}}\n[[File:Russian Imperial Family 1913.jpg|alt=|thumb|Nicholas with his family (left to right): Olga, Maria, Nicholas II, Alexandra Fyodorovna, Anastasia, Alexei, and Tatiana.

According to the account of Bolshevik officer [[Yakov Yurovsky]] (the chief executioner), in the early hours of 17 July 1918, the royal family was awakened around 2:00 am, got dressed, and were led down into a half-basement room at the back of the Ipatiev house. The pretext for this move was the family's safety, i.e. that anti-Bolshevik forces were approaching Yekaterinburg, and the house might be fired upon.<ref name=\"Nicholas 1998\">''Nicholas & Alexandra \u2013 The Last Imperial Family of Tsarist Russia'', Booth-Clibborn Editions, 1998, {{ISBN|1861540388}}</ref>\n\nPresent with Nicholas, Alexandra and their children were their doctor and three of their servants, who had voluntarily chosen to remain with the family: the Tsar's personal physician [[Eugene Botkin]], his wife's maid [[Anna Demidova]], and the family's chef, [[Ivan Kharitonov]], and footman, [[Alexei Trupp]]. A firing squad had been assembled and was waiting in an adjoining room, composed of seven Communist soldiers from Central Europe, and three local Bolsheviks, all under the command of Yurovsky.<ref name=\"Nicholas 1998\" />\n\nNicholas was carrying his son. When the family arrived in the basement, the former empress complained that there were no chairs for them to sit on. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Yurovsky ordered two chairs brought in, and when the empress and the heir were seated, the executioners filed into the room. Yurovsky announced to them that the Ural Soviet of Workers' Deputies had decided to execute them. A stunned Nicholas asked, \"What? What did you say?\" and turned toward his family. Yurovsky quickly repeated the order and Nicholas said, according to [[Peter Ermakov]], \"You know not what you do.\"\n\nThe executioners drew handguns and began shooting; Nicholas was the first to die. Yurovsky took credit afterwards for firing the first shot that killed the Tsar, but his protege \u2013 [[Grigory Petrovich Nikulin|Grigory Nikulin]] \u2013 said years later that Mikhail Medvedev had fired the shot that killed Nicholas. \"He fired the first shot. He killed the Tsar,\" he said in 1964 in a tape-recorded statement for the radio.<ref>Radzinsky p. 431</ref> Nicholas was shot several times in the chest (sometimes incorrectly said to have been shot in his head, but his skull bore no bullet wounds when it was discovered later). Anastasia, Tatiana, Olga, and Maria survived the first hail of bullets; the sisters were wearing over 1.3 kilograms of diamonds and precious gems sewn into their clothing, which provided some initial protection from the bullets and bayonets.<ref>[[#Massie1995|Massie (1995)]] p. 8.</ref> They were then stabbed with bayonets and finally shot at close range in their heads.<ref>[[#Massie1995|Massie (1995)]] p. 6.</ref>\n\nAn announcement from the Presidium of the Ural Regional Soviet of the Workers' and Peasants' Government emphasized that conspiracies had been exposed to free the ex-tsar, that counter-revolutionary forces were pressing in on Soviet Russian territory, and that the ex-tsar was guilty of unforgivable crimes against the nation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alexander, Robert |title=The Kitchen Boy: A Novel of the Last Tsar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0z8GNUhOqoC|date=2003|publisher=Penguin Group US|isbn=978-1-101-20036-0}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>In view of the enemy's proximity to Yekaterinburg and the exposure by the Cheka of a serious White Guard plot with the goal of abducting the former Tsar and his family\u2026 In light of the approach of counterrevolutionary bands toward the Red capital of the Urals and the possibility of the crowned executioner escaping trial by the people (a plot among the White Guards to try to abduct him and his family was exposed and the compromising documents will be published), the Presidium of the Ural Regional Soviet, fulfilling the will of the Revolution, resolved to shoot the former Tsar, Nikolai Romanov, who is guilty of countless, bloody, violent acts against the Russian people.<ref>Telegraph quoted in [https://books.google.com/books?id=l0z8GNUhOqoC ''The Kitchen Boy''] by Robert Alexander (unpaginated).</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe bodies were driven to nearby woodland, searched and burned.

On 14 August 2000, they were recognised by the [[synod]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. This time they were not named as martyrs, since their deaths did not result immediately from their Christian faith; instead, they were canonized as [[passion bearer]]s. According to a statement by the Moscow synod, they were glorified as saints for the following reasons:\n\n{{quote|In the last Orthodox Russian monarch and members of his family we see people who sincerely strove to incarnate in their lives the commands of the Gospel. In the suffering borne by the Royal Family in prison with humility, patience, and meekness, and in their martyrs' deaths in Yekaterinburg in the night of 17 July 1918 was revealed the light of the faith of Christ that conquers evil.}}\n\nHowever, Nicholas' canonization was controversial. The Russian Orthodox Church Abroad was split on the issue back in 1981, some members suggesting that the emperor was a weak ruler and had failed to thwart the rise of the Bolsheviks. It was pointed out by one priest that martyrdom in the Russian Orthodox Church has nothing to do with the martyr's personal actions but is instead related to why he or she was killed.<ref name=\"Massie\">[[#Massie1995|Massie (1995)]] pp. 134\u2013135.</ref>\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church inside Russia rejected the family's classification as martyrs because they were not killed on account of their religious faith. Religious leaders in both churches also had objections to canonising the Tsar's family because they perceived him as a weak emperor whose incompetence led to the revolution and the suffering of his people and made him partially responsible for his own murder and those of his wife, children and servants. For these opponents, the fact that the Tsar was, in private life, a kind man and a good husband and father or a leader who showed genuine concern for the peasantry did not override his poor governance of Russia.<ref name=\"Massie\" />\n\nDespite the original opposition, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] inside Russia ultimately recognised the family as \"passion bearers,\" or people who met their deaths with Christian humility. Since the [[Late 20th Century|late 20th century]], believers have attributed healing from illnesses or conversion to the Orthodox Church to their prayers to the children of Nicholas Maria and Alexei, as well as to the rest of the family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.serfes.org/royal/miracleofmaria.htm|title=''Miracle of the Child Martyr Grand Duchess Maria''|last=Serfes, Demetrios|first=|date=|year=2000|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=25 February 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.serfes.org/royal/miracleprayers.htm|title=A Miracle Through the Prayers of Tsar Nicholas II and Tsarevich Alexis|last=Serfes, Demetrios|first=|date=|year=2000|website=The Royal Martyrs of Russia|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=6 February 2007|access-date=25 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nHistorian Raymond Esthus states:\n: The contemporary assessments of Nicholas are remarkably uniform. He was described as shy, charming, gentle in disposition, fearful of controversy, indecisive, indulgent to his relatives, and deeply devoted to his family. Aleksandr Mosolov, who headed his Court Chancellery for sixteen years, wrote that Nicholas, though intelligent and well-educated, never adopted a definite, energetic attitude and loathed making a decision in the presence of others. Sergei Witte, who served Nicholas and his father for eleven years as Minister of Finance, commented that the Tsar was a well-intentioned child, but his actions were entirely dependent upon the character of his counselors, most of whom were bad.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Esthus, Raymond A. |title=Nicholas II and the Russo-Japanese War|journal=Russian Review|volume=40|issue=4|year=1981|pages=396\u2013411|jstor=129919|doi=10.2307/129919}}</ref>\n\nNicholas generally was considered for the most of the 20st century to have been incompetent at the colossal task of ruling the enormous Russian Empire,<ref>Ferro, Marc (1995) ''Nicholas II: Last of the Tsars''. New York: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-508192-7}}, p. 2</ref> although the influence of Soviet propaganda, on the general opinion on the monarch, which described him as a bloodthirsty tyrant, must be considered. In the present-day Russia historians are more available to give him a much more positive assessment than before, also evaluating his reforms at the beginning of his reign and his person.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ruskline.ru/opp/2017/iyun/16/glavnye_zaslugi_imperatora_nikolaya_ii/|title=The main merits of Emperor Nicholas II|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|language=ru|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Historian [[Robert K. Massie]] provides a typical indictment of his incompetence:\n\n{{quote| ... there still are those who for political or other reasons continue to insist that Nicholas was \"Bloody Nicholas\". Most commonly, he is described as shallow, weak, stupid\u2014a one-dimensional figure presiding feebly over the last days of a corrupt and crumbling system. This, certainly, is the prevailing public image of the last Tsar. Historians admit that Nicholas was a \"good man\"\u2014the historical evidence of personal charm, gentleness, love of family, deep religious faith and strong Russian patriotism is too overwhelming to be denied\u2014but they argue that personal factors are irrelevant; what matters is that Nicholas was a bad tsar&nbsp;.... Essentially, the tragedy of Nicholas II was that he appeared in the wrong place in history.<ref>[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] pp. viii\u2013x.</ref>}}\n\nIn Russia, just after the rise of [[Soviet Union|the new regime]], the legacy of Nicholas II faced widespread criticism. Pavel Bykov, who in Russia wrote the first full account about the downfall of the Tsar for the [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|newly-formed Soviet propaganda's regime]], denounced Nicholas as a \"tyrant, who paid with his life for the age-old repression and arbitrary rule of his ancestors over the Russian people, over the impoverished and blood-soaked country\". Soviet-era historians noted that Nicholas II was not fit to be a statesman. It has been argued that he had a weak will and was manipulated by adventurist forces. His regime was condemned for extensive use of the army, police, and courts to destroy the revolutionary movement. He was criticised for fanning nationalism and chauvinism. With the punitive expeditions and courts-martial during the 1905 Revolution, the monarch became known as \"Nicholas the Bloody\". Nicholas's reign was seen as a time of suffering for Russians.<ref name=\"Kallistov\">{{cite book|author=Kallistov, D.

His father, Alexander III, who deliberately intended to keep his son uneducated in statecraft until the age of thirty, unfortunately miscalculated his own life expectancy, and died when Nicholas was twenty-six. The new Tsar had learned nothing in the interval, and the impression of imperturbability he conveyed was in reality apathy\u2014the indifference of a mind so shallow as to be all surface. When a telegram was brought to him announcing the annihilation of the Russian fleet at Tsushima, he read it, stuffed it in his pocket, and went on playing tennis.<ref>Tuchman, Barbara W.

These included the Imperial German, Spanish, Italian, Danish and British armies.\n\nHe was [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of the [[Royal Scots Greys]] from 1894 until his death. On becoming Colonel-in-Chief he presented the Regiment with a white [[bearskin]], now worn by the bass drummer of the Pipes and Drums of the [[Royal Scots Dragoon Guards]]. The Imperial Russian anthem is still played at dinner nights in the Officers' Mess, where there remains a portrait of the Tsar in Scots Greys uniform.

As ''Emperor of All The Russias'', and an [[Autocracy|autocrat]], the resources under his command were virtually incalculable. However, the vast majority of this was owned by the state as [[Crown property]]; the Romanov family's ''personal wealth'' was only a small fraction of this. As monarch, the income of Nicholas was 24 million gold [[Ruble|roubles]] per annum: this derived from a yearly allowance from the Treasury, and from the profits of Crown farmland.<ref name=\"Massie, Robert K. 1967, p64\">Massie, Robert K. ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', New York, Atheneum, 1967, p64</ref> From this income, he had to fund staff, the upkeep of imperial palaces and imperial theatres, annuities for the royal family, pensions, bequests, and other outgoings. \"Before the end of the year, the Tsar was usually penniless; sometimes he reached this embarrassing state by autumn.\"<ref name=\"Massie, Robert K. 1967, p64\"/> According to the Grand Marshal of the Court, Count Paul Benckendorff, the family's total financial resources amounted to between 12.5 and 17.5 million roubles.<ref>Clarke, William ''The Lost Fortune of the Tsars'', St. Martin's Griffin; Reprint edition, 1996, p101.</ref> As a comparison, Prince Felix Yusupov estimated his family's worth in real estate holdings alone as amounting to 50 million gold roubles.<ref>Ferrand, Jacques ''Les Princes Youssoupoff & les comtes Soumarkoff Elston'', Paris 1991</ref>\n\n== Documentaries and films ==\n{{See also|List of films about the Romanovs}}\nSeveral films about Nicholas II and his family have been made, including ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), ''[[Nicholas and Alexandra]]'' (1971), ''[[Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna]]'' (1986), ''[[Rasputin: Dark Servant of Destiny]]'' (1996 [[HBO]]), ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1997), and two Russian adaptations ''[[Assassin of the Tsar]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Romanovs: An Imperial Family]]'' (2000).\nIn 2017 the film ''[[Matilda (2017 film)]]'' was released.

His reign saw the fall of the [[Russian Empire]] from one of the foremost great powers of the world to economic and military collapse. His memory was reviled by [[Historiography in the Soviet Union|Soviet historians]] as a weak and incompetent leader whose decisions led to military defeats and the deaths of millions of his subjects. By contrast Anglo-Russian historian [[Nikolai Tolstoy]], leader of the International Monarchist League, says, \"There were many bad things about the Tsar's regime, but he inherited an autocracy and his acts are now being seen in perspective and in comparison to the terrible crimes committed by the Soviets.\"<ref name=\"Tsar Nicholas - exhibits from an execution\">{{citation|title = Tsar Nicholas \u2013 exhibits from an execution|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18592372|publisher = BBC News|author = Martin Vennard|date = 27 June 2012|accessdate = 3 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs Emperor, Nicholas gave limited support to the economic and political reforms promoted by top aides [[Sergei Witte]] and [[Pyotr Stolypin]], but they faced too much aristocratic opposition to be fully effective. He supported modernization based on foreign loans and close ties with France, but resisted giving the new parliament (the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|Duma]]) major roles. He was criticised for the [[Khodynka Tragedy]], [[Pogroms in the Russian Empire|antisemitic pogroms]], [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]], the violent suppression of the [[1905 Russian Revolution]], the repression of political opponents, and his perceived responsibility for defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904\u20131905), which saw the annihilation of the [[Baltic Fleet|Russian Baltic Fleet]] at the [[Battle of Tsushima]], the loss of Russian influence over Manchuria and Korea, and the [[Karafuto Prefecture|Japanese annexation of the south of Sakhalin Island]].\n\nNicholas signed the [[Anglo-Russian Convention|Anglo-Russian Entente]] of 1907, which was designed to counter [[German Empire|Germany]]'s attempts to gain influence in the Middle East; it ended [[the Great Game]] of confrontation between Russia and the [[British Empire]]. He supported Serbia and approved the mobilization of the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian Army]] on 30 July 1914. In response, Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August 1914 and its ally France on 3 August 1914,<ref>{{cite web |title=World War I Declarations |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/topics/ww1declarations.html |publisher=The Library of Congress |accessdate=5 September 2019}}</ref> starting [[World War I|the First World War]]. The aristocracy was alarmed at the powerful influence of the despised peasant priest [[Grigori Rasputin]] over the tsar. The severe military losses led to a collapse of morale at the front and at home, leading to the fall of the [[House of Romanov]] in the [[February Revolution]] of 1917. Nicholas abdicated on behalf of himself and his son. With his family he was imprisoned by the Bolsheviks and [[Execution of the Romanov family|executed]] in July 1918.\n\nIn 1981, Nicholas, his wife, and their children were recognized as martyrs by the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] in [[New York City]].<ref>A Reader's Guide to Orthodox Icons [http://iconreader.wordpress.com/2011/07/17/the-icons-that-canonized-the-holy-royal-martyrs/ ''The Icons that Canonized the Holy Royal Martyrs'']</ref> After the fall of Communism, the remains of the imperial family were exhumed, identified and re-interred with an elaborate state and church ceremony in St. Petersburg on 17 July 1998.

He had five younger siblings: [[Grand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich of Russia|Alexander]] (1869\u20131870), [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|George]] (1871\u20131899), [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Xenia]] (1875\u20131960), [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Michael]] (1878\u20131918) and [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia|Olga]] (1882\u20131960). Nicholas often referred to his father nostalgically in letters after Alexander's death in 1894. He was also very close to his mother, as revealed in their published letters to each other.<ref>''The letters of Tsar Nicholas and Empress Marie: being confidential correspondence between Nicholas II, last of the Tsars, and his mother, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna''. Edward J. Bing (ed.). London: Nicholson and Watson, 1937.</ref>\n\nHis paternal grandparents were [[Alexander II of Russia|Emperor Alexander II]] and [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)|Empress Maria Alexandrovna]] (n\u00e9e Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine). His maternal grandparents were [[Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise of Denmark]]. Nicholas was of primarily German and [[Danes|Danish]] descent, his last ethnically [[Russians|Russian]] ancestor being [[Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia]] (1708\u20131728), daughter of [[Peter the Great]].\n\n[[File:Tsar Nicholas II & King George V.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Emperor Nicholas II of Russia with his physically similar cousin, [[George V|King George V of the United Kingdom]] (right), wearing German military uniforms in Berlin before the war; 1913]]\nNicholas was related to several monarchs in Europe. His mother's siblings included Kings [[Frederick VIII of Denmark]] and [[George I of Greece]], as well as the United Kingdom's [[Queen Alexandra]] (consort of [[King Edward VII]]). Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor Wilhelm II]] were all first cousins of [[George V|King George V of the United Kingdom]]. Nicholas was also a first cousin of both [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]] and [[Maud of Wales|Queen Maud of Norway]], as well as [[Christian X of Denmark|King Christian X of Denmark]] and [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I of Greece]]. Nicholas and Wilhelm II were in turn second cousins-once-removed, as each descended from [[Frederick William III of Prussia|King Frederick William III of Prussia]], as well as third cousins, as they were both great-great-grandsons of [[Tsar Paul I of Russia]]. In addition to being second cousins through descent from [[Louis II, Grand Duke of Hesse]] and his wife [[Princess Wilhelmine of Baden]], Nicholas and Alexandra were also third cousins-once-removed, as they were both descendants of [[Frederick William II of Prussia|King Frederick William II of Prussia]].\n\nTsar Nicholas II was the first cousin-once-removed of [[Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich of Russia (1856\u20131929)|Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich]]. To distinguish between them the Grand Duke was often known within the imperial family as \"Nikolasha\" and \"Nicholas the Tall\", while the Tsar was \"Nicholas the Short\".\n\nIn his childhood, Nicholas, his parents and siblings made annual visits to the Danish royal palaces of [[Fredensborg Palace|Fredensborg]] and [[Bernstorff Palace|Bernstorff]] to visit his grandparents, the king and queen. The visits also served as family reunions, as his mother's siblings would also come from the United Kingdom, Germany and Greece with their respective families.<ref>Van Der Kiste, John (2003) ''The Romanovs: 1818\u20131959'', Sutton Publishing, p. 151</ref> It was there in 1883, that he had a flirtation with one of his British first cousins, [[Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom|Princess Victoria]].

Later that year, Nicholas's uncle, [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich]], married [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna|Princess Elizabeth]], daughter of [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse]] and his late wife [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]] (who had died in 1878), and a granddaughter of [[Queen Victoria]]. At the wedding in St. Petersburg, the sixteen-year-old [[Tsarevich]] met with and admired the bride's youngest surviving sister, twelve-year-old [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Princess Alix]]. Those feelings of admiration blossomed into love following her visit to St. Petersburg five years later in 1889. Alix had feelings for him in turn. As a devout Lutheran, she was initially reluctant to convert to Russian Orthodoxy in order to marry Nicholas, but later relented.<ref>[[#King1994|King (1994)]] p. 54</ref>\n\nIn 1890 Nicholas, [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|his younger brother George]], and their cousin [[Prince George of Greece and Denmark|Prince George of Greece]], set out on a [[Eastern journey of Nicholas II|world tour]], although Grand Duke George fell ill and was sent home partway through the trip. Nicholas visited Egypt, India, Singapore, and Bangkok, receiving honors as a distinguished guest in each country. In April 1891, in the city of [[\u014ctsu]], Japan, Nicholas was [[\u014ctsu incident|attacked by a deranged Japanese police officer]]. The incident cut his trip short. Some historians have speculated on how the incident may have later influenced his opinion of Japan and the Japanese.<ref name=\"kowner\"/> Returning overland to St. Petersburg, he was present at the ceremonies in [[Vladivostok]] commemorating the beginning of work on the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. In 1893, Nicholas traveled to London on behalf of his parents to be present at the wedding of his cousin [[George V|the Duke of York]] to [[Princess Mary of Teck]]. Queen Victoria was struck by the physical resemblance between the two cousins, and their appearances confused some at the wedding. During this time, Nicholas had an affair with St. Petersburg ballerina [[Mathilde Kschessinska]].<ref>Kshessinska 1960. ''Dancing in Petersburg''.

Other guests included [[Queen Victoria]], [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], the [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Empress Frederick]] (Kaiser Wilhelm's mother and Queen Victoria's eldest daughter), Nicholas's uncle, the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales]], and the bride's parents, [[Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke]] and [[Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia|Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].\n\nOnce in Coburg Nicholas proposed to Alix, but she rejected his proposal, being reluctant to convert to Orthodoxy. But the Kaiser later told her she had a duty to marry Nicholas and to convert, as her sister Elizabeth had voluntarily done in 1892. Thus Nicholas and Alix became officially engaged on 20 April 1894. Nicholas's parents initially hesitated to give the engagement their blessing, as Alix had made poor impressions during her visits to Russia. They gave their consent only when they saw Tsar Alexander's health deteriorating.\n\nThat summer, Nicholas travelled to England to visit both Alix and the Queen. The visit coincided with the birth of [[George V|the Duke]] and [[Mary of Teck|Duchess of York]]'s first child, the future [[King Edward VIII]].

Shortly after he came to the [[throne]], a deputation of peasants and workers from various towns' local assemblies (''[[zemstvos]]'') came to the [[Winter Palace]] proposing court reforms, such as the adoption of a constitutional monarchy,<ref>[[#Warth|Warth]], p. 20</ref> and reform that would improve the political and economic life of the peasantry, in the [[Tver Address]].<ref>Figes, p. 165</ref><ref>Pierre, Andre (1925) ''Journal Intime de Nicholas II'', Paris: Payot, p. 127</ref>\n\nAlthough the addresses they had sent in beforehand were couched in mild and loyal terms, Nicholas was angry and ignored advice from an Imperial Family Council by saying to them:\n\n{{quote|... it has come to my knowledge that during the last months there have been heard in some assemblies of the zemstvos the voices of those who have indulged in a senseless dream that the zemstvos be called upon to participate in the government of the country.

Khodynka was chosen as the location as it was the only place near Moscow large enough to hold all of the Moscow citizens.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 1017</ref> Khodynka was primarily used as a military training ground and the field was uneven with trenches. Before the food and drink was handed out, rumours spread that there would not be enough for everyone. As a result, the crowd rushed to get their share and individuals were tripped and trampled upon, suffocating in the dirt of the field.<ref>[[#Warth|Warth]], pp. 26\u201327</ref> Of the approximate 100,000 in attendance, it is estimated that 1,389 individuals died<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> and roughly 1,300 were injured.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> The Khodynka Tragedy was seen as an ill omen and Nicholas found gaining popular trust difficult from the beginning of his reign. The French ambassador's gala was planned for that night. The Tsar wanted to stay in his chambers and pray for the lives lost, but his uncles believed that his absence at the ball would strain relations with France, particularly the 1894 [[Franco-Russian Alliance]]. Thus Nicholas attended the party; as a result the mourning populace saw Nicholas as frivolous and uncaring.\n\nDuring the autumn after the coronation, Nicholas and Alexandra made a tour of Europe. After making visits to the emperor and empress of Austria-Hungary, the Kaiser of Germany, and Nicholas's Danish grandparents and relatives, Nicholas and Alexandra took possession of their new yacht, the ''[[Russian yacht Standart|Standart]], ''which had been built in Denmark.<ref>[[#King2006|King (2006)]] p. 420</ref> From there, they made a journey to Scotland to spend some time with Queen Victoria at [[Balmoral Castle]]. While Alexandra enjoyed her reunion with her grandmother, Nicholas complained in a letter to his mother about being forced to go shooting with his uncle, the Prince of Wales, in bad weather, and was suffering from a bad toothache.<ref>King, Greg (2007) ''Twilight of Splendor: the Court of Queen Victoria in Her Diamond Jubilee Year '', John Wiley & Sons, pp. 173\u2013175</ref>\n\n[[File:Imperial Monogram of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Imperial monogram]]\n\nThe first years of his reign saw little more than continuation and development of the policy pursued by [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]. Nicholas allotted money for the [[All-Russia exhibition 1896|All-Russia exhibition of 1896]]. In 1897 restoration of [[gold standard]] by [[Sergei Witte]], Minister of Finance, completed the series of financial reforms, initiated fifteen years earlier. By 1902 the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] was nearing completion; this helped the Russians trade in the Far East but the railway still required huge amounts of work.\n\n===Ecclesiastical affairs===\nNicholas always believed God chose him to be the tsar and therefore the decisions of the tsar reflected the will of God and could not be disputed. He was convinced that the simple people of Russia understood this and loved him, as demonstrated by the display of affection he perceived when he made public appearances. His old-fashioned belief made for a very stubborn ruler who rejected constitutional limitations on his power. It put the tsar at variance with the emerging political consensus among the Russian elite. It was further belied by the subordinate position of the Church in the bureaucracy. The result was a new distrust between the tsar and the church hierarchy and between those hierarchs and the people. Thereby the tsar's base of support was conflicted.<ref>Sergei L. Firsov,\"Emperor Nicholas II as an Orthodox Tsar\" ''Russian Studies in History'' 50.4 (2012): 79-90.</ref>\n\nIn 1903, Nicholas threw himself into an ecclesiastical crisis regarding the [[canonisation]] of [[Seraphim of Sarov]]. The previous year, it had been suggested that if he were canonised, the imperial couple would beget a son and heir to throne. While Alexandra demanded in July 1902 that Seraphim be canonised in less than a week, Nicholas demanded that he be canonised within a year. Despite a public outcry, the Church bowed to the intense imperial pressure, declaring Seraphim worthy of canonisation in January 1903. That summer, the imperial family travelled to Sarov for the canonisation.<ref>[[#King2006|King (2006)]] p. 137</ref>\n\n===Initiatives in foreign affairs===\n\nAccording to his biographer:\n: His tolerance if not preference for charlatans and adventurers extended to grave matters of external policy, and his vacillating conduct and erratic decisions aroused misgivings and occasional alarm among his more conventional advisers. The foreign ministry itself was not a bastion of diplomatic expertise. Patronage and \"connections\" were the keys to appointment and promotion.<ref>Robert D.

This conference, suggested and promoted by Nicholas II, was convened with the view of terminating the [[arms race]], and setting up machinery for the peaceful settlement of international disputes.

Russia had expanded in the Far East, and the growth of its settlement and territorial ambitions, as its southward path to the [[Balkans]] was frustrated, conflicted with Japan's own territorial ambitions on the Chinese and Asian mainland.

The United Kingdom would not allow the Russian navy to use the [[Suez Canal]], due to [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance|its alliance]] with the Empire of Japan, and due to the [[Dogger Bank incident]] where the Baltic Fleet mistakenly fired on British fishing boats in the North Sea. The Russian [[Baltic Fleet]] traversed the world to lift the blockade on Port Arthur, but after many misadventures on the way, was nearly annihilated by the Japanese in the [[Battle of Tsushima|Battle of the Tsushima Strait]].<ref name=\"Kowner\" /> On land the [[Imperial Russian Army]] experienced logistical problems.

Nicholas's mother, as well as his cousin [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II]], urged Nicholas to negotiate for peace.

He ignored the financial repercussions of a long-distance war.<ref>[[#Warth|Warth]], p. 67</ref> Rotem Kowner, argues that during his visit to Japan in 1891, where Nicholas was [[\u014ctsu incident|attacked]] by a Japanese policeman, he regarded the Japanese as small of stature, feminine, weak, and inferior.

Despite the onset of the war and the many defeats Russia suffered, Nicholas still believed in, and expected, a final victory, maintaining an image of the racial inferiority and military weakness of the Japanese.<ref>Kowner (1998)</ref> Throughout the war, the tsar demonstrated total confidence in Russia's ultimate triumph. His advisors never gave him a clear picture of Russia's weaknesses. Despite the continuous military disasters Nicholas believed victory was near at hand. Losing his navy at Tsushima finally persuaded him to agree to peace negotiations. Even then he insisted on the option of reopening hostilities if peace conditions were unfavorable. He forbade his chief negotiator Count Witte to agree to either indemnity payments or loss of territory. Nicholas remained adamantly opposed to any concessions. Peace was made, but Witte did so by disobeying the tsar and ceding southern Sakhalin to Japan.<ref>Raymond A.

On Saturday, 8 (21) January, the ministers convened to consider the situation.

In the [[October Manifesto]], the Tsar pledged to introduce basic [[civil liberties]], provide for broad participation in the State Duma, and endow the Duma with legislative and oversight powers. He was determined, however, to preserve his [[autocracy]] even in the context of reform. This was signalled in the text of the [[Russian Constitution of 1906|1906 constitution]]. He was described as the supreme autocrat, and retained sweeping executive powers, also in church affairs. His cabinet ministers were not allowed to interfere with nor assist one another; they were responsible only to him.\n\nNicholas's relations with the Duma were poor. The [[First Duma]], with a majority of [[Constitutional Democratic party|Kadets]], almost immediately came into conflict with him. Scarcely had the 524 members sat down at the [[Tauride Palace]] when they formulated an 'Address to the Throne'. It demanded [[universal suffrage]], radical land reform, the release of all [[political prisoner]]s and the dismissal of ministers appointed by the Tsar in favour of ministers acceptable to the Duma.<ref>[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 243</ref> Grand Duchess Olga, Nicholas's sister, later wrote:\n\n{{quote|There was such gloom at Tsarskoye Selo. I did not understand anything about politics. I just felt everything was going wrong with the country and all of us. The October Constitution did not seem to satisfy anyone. I went with my mother to the first Duma. I remember the large group of deputies from among peasants and factory people. The peasants looked sullen. But the workmen were worse: they looked as though they hated us. I remember the distress in [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alicky]]'s eyes.<ref name=\"vorres121\" />}}\n\nMinister of the Court Count [[Vladimir Frederiks]] commented, \"The Deputies, they give one the impression of a gang of criminals who are only waiting for the signal to throw themselves upon the ministers and cut their throats.

The Duma was populated with [[Political radicalism|radicals]], many of whom wished to push through legislation that would abolish private property ownership, among other things. Witte, unable to grasp the seemingly insurmountable problems of reforming Russia and the monarchy, wrote to Nicholas on 14 April 1906 resigning his office (however, other accounts have said that Witte was forced to resign by the Emperor). Nicholas was not ungracious to Witte and an Imperial Rescript was published on 22 April creating Witte a Knight of the [[Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky]] with diamonds (the last two words were written in the Emperor's own hand, followed by \"I remain unalterably well-disposed to you and sincerely grateful, for ever more Nicholas.\").\n\nA second Duma met for the first time in February 1907. The [[leftist]] parties\u2014including the [[Social Democrats]] and the Social Revolutionaries, who had boycotted the First Duma\u2014had won 200 seats in the Second, more than a third of the membership. Again Nicholas waited impatiently to rid himself of the Duma. In two letters to his mother he let his bitterness flow:\n\n{{quote|A grotesque deputation is coming from England to see liberal members of the Duma. [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Uncle Bertie]] informed us that they were very sorry but were unable to take action to stop their coming. Their famous \"liberty\", of course.

Every word spoken, however, comes out in the next day's papers which are avidly read by everyone. In many places the populace is getting restive again.

Stolypin, a skilful politician, had ambitious plans for reform. These included making loans available to the lower classes to enable them to buy land, with the intent of forming a farming class loyal to the crown. Nevertheless, when the Duma remained hostile, Stolypin had no qualms about invoking Article 87 of the [[Russian Constitution of 1906|Fundamental Laws]], which empowered the Tsar to issue 'urgent and extraordinary' emergency decrees 'during the recess of the State Duma'. Stolypin's most famous legislative act, the change in peasant land tenure, was promulgated under Article 87.<ref name=\"massie245\" />\n\nThe third Duma remained an independent body. This time the members proceeded cautiously. Instead of hurling themselves at the government, opposing parties within the Duma worked to develop the body as a whole. In the classic manner of the British Parliament, the Duma reached for power grasping for the national purse strings. The Duma had the right to question ministers behind closed doors as to their proposed expenditures. These sessions, endorsed by Stolypin, were educational for both sides, and, in time, mutual antagonism was replaced by mutual respect. Even the sensitive area of military expenditure, where the October Manifesto clearly had reserved decisions to the throne, a Duma commission began to operate. Composed of aggressive patriots no less anxious than Nicholas to restore the fallen honour of Russian arms, the Duma commission frequently recommended expenditures even larger than those proposed.\n\nWith the passage of time, Nicholas also began to have confidence in the Duma. \"This Duma cannot be reproached with an attempt to seize power and there is no need at all to quarrel with it,\" he said to Stolypin in 1909.<ref name=\"massie246\">[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 246</ref> Nevertheless, Stolypin's plans were undercut by conservatives at court. Although the tsar at first supported him, he finally sided with the arch critics.<ref>Mikhail F. Florinskii, \"Nicholas II and Stolypin's Cabinet\" ''Russian Social Science Review'' 53.4 (2012): 4-14.</ref> Reactionaries such as Prince [[Vladimir Nikolayevich Orlov]] never tired of telling the tsar that the very existence of the Duma was a blot on the autocracy. Stolypin, they whispered, was a traitor and secret revolutionary who was conniving with the Duma to steal the prerogatives assigned the Tsar by God. Witte also engaged in constant intrigue against Stolypin. Although Stolypin had had nothing to do with Witte's fall, Witte blamed him. Stolypin had unwittingly angered the Tsaritsa. He had ordered an investigation into Rasputin and presented it to the Tsar, who read it but did nothing. Stolypin, on his own authority, ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg. Alexandra protested vehemently but Nicholas refused to overrule his Prime Minister,<ref name=\"massie247\">[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 247.</ref> who had more influence with the Emperor.\n\nBy the time of Stolypin's assassination in September 1911, Stolypin had grown weary of the burdens of office. For a man who preferred clear decisive action, working with a sovereign who believed in fatalism and mysticism was frustrating. As an example, Nicholas once returned a document unsigned with the note:\n\n{{quote|Despite most convincing arguments in favour of adopting a positive decision in this matter, an inner voice keeps on insisting more and more that I do not accept responsibility for it. So far my conscience has not deceived me. Therefore I intend in this case to follow its dictates. I know that you, too, believe that \"a Tsar's heart is in God's hands.\" Let it be so. For all laws established by me I bear a great responsibility before God, and I am ready to answer for my decision at any time.<ref name=\"massie247\" />}}\n\n[[File:Rasputin PA.jpg|thumb|[[Grigori Rasputin]]]]\n\nAlexandra, believing that Stolypin had severed the bonds that her son depended on for life, hated the Prime Minister.<ref name=\"massie247\" /> In March 1911, in a fit of anger stating that he no longer commanded the imperial confidence, Stolypin asked to be relieved of his office. Two years earlier when Stolypin had casually mentioned resigning to Nicholas he was informed: \"This is not a question of confidence or lack of it. It is my will. Remember that we live in Russia, not abroad...and therefore I shall not consider the possibility of any resignation.\"<ref>[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 248</ref> He was assassinated in September 1911.\n\nIn 1912, a fourth Duma was elected with almost the same membership as the third. \"The Duma started too fast. Now it is slower, but better, and more lasting,\" stated Nicholas to Sir [[Bernard Pares]].<ref name=\"massie246\" />\n\nThe [[World War I|First World War]] developed badly for Russia. By late 1916, Romanov family desperation reached the point that [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich]], younger brother of Alexander III and the Tsar's only surviving uncle, was deputed to beg Nicholas to grant a constitution and a government responsible to the Duma. Nicholas sternly and adamantly refused, reproaching his uncle for asking him to break his coronation oath to maintain autocratic power for his successors. In the Duma on 2 December 1916, Vladimir Purishkevich, a fervent patriot, monarchist and war worker, denounced the dark forces which surrounded the throne in a thunderous two-hour speech which was tumultuously applauded. \"Revolution threatens,\" he warned, \"and an obscure peasant shall govern Russia no longer!\"<ref>[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 49.</ref>\n\n===Tsarevich Alexei's illness and Rasputin===\n[[File:Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia.jpg|left|thumb|Alexei in 1913]]\n\nFurther complicating domestic matters was the matter of the succession. Alexandra bore Nicholas four daughters, [[Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia|the Grand Duchess Olga]] in 1895, [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia|the Grand Duchess Tatiana]] in 1897, [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Maria]] in 1899, and [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia]] in 1901, before their son [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Alexei]] was born on 12 August 1904. The young heir was afflicted with [[Haemophilia B]], a hereditary disease that prevents blood from clotting properly, which at that time was untreatable and usually led to an untimely death. As a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, Alexandra carried the same [[gene mutation]] that afflicted several of the major European royal houses, such as [[Prussia]] and Spain. Hemophilia, therefore, became known as \"[[Haemophilia in European royalty|the royal disease]]\". Through Alexandra, the disease had passed on to her son. As all of Nicholas and Alexandra's daughters were murdered with their parents and brother in Yekaterinburg in 1918, it is not known whether any of them inherited the gene as [[genetic carrier|carriers]].\n\nBefore Rasputin's arrival, the tsarina and the tsar had consulted numerous mystics, charlatans, \"holy fools,\" and miracle workers. The royal behavior was not some odd aberration, but a deliberate retreat from the secular social and economic forces of his time - an act of faith and vote of confidence in a spiritual past. They had set themselves up for the greatest spiritual advisor and manipulator in Russian history.<ref>Robert D. Warth,\"Before Rasputin: Piety and the Occult at the Court of Nicholas II.\" ''Historian'' 47.3 (1985): 323-337.</ref>\n\nBecause of the fragility of the autocracy at this time, Nicholas and Alexandra chose to keep secret Alexei's condition. Even within the household, many were unaware of the exact nature of the Tsarevich's illness. At first Alexandra turned to Russian doctors and medics to treat Alexei; however, their treatments generally failed, and Alexandra increasingly turned to [[mysticism|mystic]]s and holy men (or ''[[starets]]'' as they were called in Russian). One of these starets, an illiterate Siberian named [[Grigori Rasputin]], gained amazing success. Rasputin's influence over Empress Alexandra, and consequently the Tsar himself, grew even stronger after 1912 when the Tsarevich nearly died from an injury. His bleeding grew steadily worse as doctors despaired, and priests administered the [[last rites|Last Sacrament]]. In desperation, Alexandra called upon Rasputin, to which he replied, \"God has seen your tears and heard your prayers. Do not grieve. The Little One will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much.\"<ref>[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 185</ref> The haemorrhage stopped the very next day and the boy began to recover. Alexandra took this as a sign that Rasputin was a ''starets'' and that God was with him; for the rest of her life she would fervently defend him and turn her wrath against anyone who dared to question him.\n\n===European affairs===\n[[File:Nicholas II and Alexei in Reval 1908.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Nicholas II and his son Alexei aboard the Imperial yacht ''[[Russian yacht Standart|Standart]]'', during King [[Edward VII]]'s state visit to Russia in [[Tallinn|Reval]], 1908]]\n\nIn 1907, to end longstanding controversies over central Asia, Russia and the United Kingdom signed the [[Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907|Anglo-Russian Convention]] that resolved most of the problems generated for decades by [[The Great Game]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Klein, Ira |title=The Anglo-Russian Convention and the Problem of Central Asia, 1907\u20131914|journal=Journal of British Studies|year=1971|volume=11|issue=1|pages=126\u2013147 |jstor=175041|doi=10.1086/385621}}</ref> The UK had already entered into the [[Entente cordiale]] with France in 1904, and the Anglo-Russian convention led to the formation of the [[Triple Entente]]. The following year, in May 1908, Nicholas and Alexandra's shared \"Uncle Bertie\" and \"Aunt Alix,\" Britain's King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, made a state visit to Russia, being the first reigning British monarchs to do so. However, they did not set foot on Russian soil. Instead, they stayed aboard their yachts, meeting off the coast of modern-day [[Tallinn]]. Later that year, Nicholas was taken off guard by the news that his foreign minister, [[Alexander Izvolsky]], had entered into a secret agreement with the Austro-Hungarian foreign minister, [[Count Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal|Count Alois von Aehrenthal]], agreeing that, in exchange for Russian naval access to the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Bosporus Strait]], Russia would not oppose the Austrian annexation of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], a revision of the 1878 [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]. When Austria-Hungary did annex this territory that October, it precipitated the [[Bosnian crisis|diplomatic crisis]]. When Russia protested about the annexation, the Austrians threatened to leak secret communications between Izvolsky and Aehernthal, prompting Nicholas to complain in a letter to the Austrian emperor, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], about a breach of confidence. In 1909, in the wake of the Anglo-Russian convention, the Russian imperial family made a visit to England, staying on the [[Isle of Wight]] for [[Cowes Week]]. In 1913, during the [[Balkan War (1912\u201313)|Balkan Wars]], Nicholas personally offered to arbitrate between Serbia and Bulgaria. However, the Bulgarians rejected his offer. Also in 1913, Nicholas, albeit without Alexandra, made a visit to Berlin for the wedding of Kaiser Wilhelm II's daughter, [[Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia|Princess Victoria Louise]], to a maternal cousin of Nicholas, [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick|Ernest Augustus, the Duke of Brunswick]].<ref>Clay, Catarine (2006) ''King, Kaiser, Tsar: Three Royal Cousins Who Led the World to War'', Walker & Company, {{ISBN|0802716237}}, pp. 300\u2013301</ref> Nicholas was also joined by his cousin, [[King George V]] and his wife, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].\n\n===Tercentenary===\n{{Main|Romanov Tercentenary}}\nIn February 1913, Nicholas presided over the [[Romanov Tercentenary|tercentenary celebrations for the Romanov Dynasty]].

The outbreak of war was not inevitable, but leaders, diplomats and nineteenth-century alliances created a climate for large-scale conflict. The concept of [[Pan-Slavism]] and shared religion created strong public sympathy between Russia and Serbia. Territorial conflict created rivalries between [[German Empire|Germany]] and France and between Austria-Hungary and [[Serbia]], and as a consequence alliance networks developed across Europe. The [[Triple Entente]] and [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] networks were set before the war. Nicholas wanted neither to abandon Serbia to the ultimatum of Austria, nor to provoke a general war. In a series of letters exchanged with [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm]] of Germany (the \"[[Willy\u2013Nicky correspondence]]\") the two proclaimed their desire for peace, and each attempted to get the other to back down. Nicholas desired that Russia's mobilization be only against Austria-Hungary, in the hopes of preventing war with Germany.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R43302, Kaiser Wilhelm II. und Zar Nikolaus II..jpg|thumb|Nicholas II (right) with [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] of Germany in 1905.

He put the Russian army on \"alert\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Merriman, John (2009) ''A History of Modern Europe Volume Two'', W. W. Norton & Company, {{ISBN|0393933857}}, p. 967</ref> on 25 July. Although this was not general mobilization, it threatened the German and Austro-Hungarian borders and looked like military preparation for war.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> However, his army had no contingency plans for a partial mobilization, and on 30 July 1914 Nicholas took the fateful step of confirming the order for general mobilization, despite being strongly counselled against it.\n\nOn 28 July, Austria-Hungary formally declared war against Serbia. On 29 July 1914, Nicholas sent a telegram to Wilhelm with the suggestion to submit the Austro-Serbian problem to the [[Hague Conference]] (in [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|Hague tribunal]]). Wilhelm did not address the question of the Hague Conference in his subsequent reply.<ref>[[Hew Strachan]], ''The First World War, Vol I: To Arms'' (2001), p. 85</ref><ref>Hamilton, Richard F. and Herwig, Holger H.

Less than a week later, on 6 August, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] signed the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Russia.\n\nThe outbreak of war on 1 August 1914 found Russia grossly unprepared. Russia and her allies placed their faith in her army, the famous 'Russian steamroller'.<ref name=\"tames42\">[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 42</ref> Its pre-war regular strength was 1,400,000; mobilization added 3,100,000 reserves and millions more stood ready behind them. In every other respect, however, Russia was unprepared for war. Germany had ten times as much railway track per square mile, and whereas Russian soldiers travelled an average of {{convert|1290|km|mi|-1}} to reach the front, German soldiers traveled less than a quarter of that distance. Russian heavy industry was still too small to equip the massive armies the Tsar could raise, and her reserves of munitions were pitifully small; while the German army in 1914 was better equipped than any other, man-for-man, the Russians were severely short on artillery pieces, shells, motorized transports, and even boots. With the Baltic Sea barred by German U-boats and the Dardanelles by the guns of Germany's ally, the [[Ottoman Empire]], Russia initially could receive help only via [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]], which was frozen solid in winter, or via [[Vladivostok]], which was over {{convert|6400|km|mi}} from the front line. By 1915, a rail line was built north from [[Petrozavodsk]] to the Kola Gulf and this connection laid the foundation of the ice-free port of what eventually was called [[Murmansk]]. The Russian High Command was moreover greatly weakened by the mutual contempt between [[Vladimir Sukhomlinov]], the Minister of War, and the incompetent Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolayevich who commanded the armies in the field.<ref>Paul Robinson, Paul. \"A Study of Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich as Supreme Commander of the Russian Army, 1914\u20131915.\" ''Historian'' 75.3 (2013): 475-498. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24456116 online]</ref> In spite of all of this, an immediate attack was ordered against the German province of [[East Prussia]]. The Germans mobilised there with great efficiency and completely defeated the two Russian armies which had invaded. The [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]], where an entire Russian army was annihilated, cast an ominous shadow over Russia's future. Russia had great success against both the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman armies from the very beginning of the war, but they never succeeded against the might of the German Army. In September 1914, in order to relieve pressure on France, the Russians were forced to halt a successful offensive against Austria-Hungary in Galicia in order to attack German-held Silesia.<ref>Massie, Robert K.

General Denikin, retreating from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] wrote, \"The German heavy artillery swept away whole lines of trenches, and their defenders with them. We hardly replied. There was nothing with which we could reply. Our regiments, although completely exhausted, were beating off one attack after another by bayonet ...

At first, the targets were German, and for three days in June shops, bakeries, factories, private houses and country estates belonging to people with German names were looted and burned.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. The inflamed mobs then turned on the government, declaring the Empress should be shut up in a convent, the Tsar deposed and Rasputin hanged. Nicholas was by no means deaf to these discontents. An emergency session of the Duma was summoned and a Special Defense Council established, its members drawn from the Duma and the Tsar's ministers.\n\nIn July 1915, King [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]] of [[Denmark]], first cousin of the Tsar, sent [[Hans Niels Andersen]] to Tsarskoye Selo with an offer to act as a mediator. He made several trips between London, Berlin and Petrograd and in July saw the Dowager Empress [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Fyodorovna]]. Andersen told her they should conclude peace. Nicholas chose to turn down King Christian's offer of mediation, as he felt it would be a betrayal for Russia to form a separate peace treaty with the Central Powers when its allies Britain and France were still fighting.<ref>Hall, C (2006) ''Little Mother of Russia'', Holmes and Meier, {{ISBN|0841914222}}, p. 264</ref>\n\nThe energetic and efficient General [[Alexei Polivanov]] replaced Sukhomlinov as [[Minister of War]], which failed to improve the strategic situation.<ref name=\"tames42\" /> In the aftermath of the [[Great Retreat (Russia)|Great Retreat]] and the loss of the Kingdom of [[Poland]], Nicholas assumed the role of commander-in-chief after dismissing his cousin, Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolayevich, in September 1915. This was a mistake, as the Tsar came to be personally associated with the continuing losses at the front. He was also away at the remote HQ at [[Mogilev]], far from the direct governance of the empire, and when revolution broke out in [[Petrograd]] he was unable to halt it. In reality the move was largely symbolic, since all important military decisions were made by his chief-of-staff General [[Michael Alexeiev]], and Nicholas did little more than review troops, inspect [[field hospital]]s, and preside over military luncheons.<ref>King, Greg and Wilson, Penny (2003) ''The Fate of the Romanovs'', John Wiley & Sons, {{ISBN|0471207683}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nicholas II with his family in Yevpatoria.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Nicholas II with his family in [[Yevpatoria]], [[Crimea]], May 1916]]\n\nThe Duma was still calling for political reforms and political unrest continued throughout the war. Cut off from public opinion, Nicholas could not see that the dynasty was tottering. With Nicholas at the front, domestic issues and control of the capital were left with his wife Alexandra. However, Alexandra's relationship with [[Grigori Rasputin]], and her German background, further discredited the dynasty's authority. Nicholas had been repeatedly warned about the destructive influence of Rasputin but had failed to remove him. Rumors and accusations about Alexandra and Rasputin appeared one after another; Alexandra was even accused of harboring treasonous sympathies towards Germany. Anger at Nicholas's failure to act and the extreme damage that Rasputin's influence was doing to Russia's war effort and to the monarchy led to Rasputin's eventual murder by a group of nobles, led by Prince [[Felix Yusupov]] and [[Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich]], a cousin of the Tsar, in the early morning of Saturday 17 December 1916 ([[Old Style|O.S.]]) / 30 December 1916 ([[New Style|N.S.]]).\n\n===Collapse===\n[[File:\u0417\u0430\u0441\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0438 \u0412\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0433\u043e. \u041c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0432. 1 \u0430\u043f\u0440.1916.jpg|thumb|right|Nicholas with members of the Stavka at Mogilev in April 1916.]]\nAs the government failed to produce supplies, mounting hardship resulted in massive riots and rebellions. With Nicholas away at the front from 1915 through 1916, authority appeared to collapse and the capital was left in the hands of strikers and mutineering soldiers. Despite efforts by the British Ambassador [[George Buchanan (diplomat)|Sir George Buchanan]] to warn the Tsar that he should grant constitutional reforms to fend off revolution, Nicholas continued to bury himself away at the Staff HQ ([[Stavka]]) {{convert|600|km|mi|-2}} away at [[Mogilev|Moghilev]], leaving his capital and court open to intrigues and insurrection.<ref name=\"tames52\">[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 52</ref>\n\nIdeologically the tsar's greatest support came from the right-wing monarchists, who had recently gained strength. However they were increasingly alienated by the tsar's support of Stolypin's Westernizing reforms, by tsar's liberal reforms taken early in the Revolution of 1905, and especially by the political power the tsar had bestowed on Rasputin.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://repository.bilkent.edu.tr/bitstream/handle/11693/49114/Monarchists_Against_Their_Monarch_the_Rightists'_Criticism_of_Tsar_Nicholas_II.pdf?sequence=1|jstor=24657737|title=Monarchists Against Their Monarch: The Rightists' Criticism of Tsar Nicholas Ii|journal=Russian History|volume=31|issue=1/2|pages=105\u2013120|last1=Podbolotov|first1=Sergei|year=2004|doi=10.1163/187633104X00043|hdl=11693/49114}}</ref>\n\nBy early 1917, Russia was on the verge of total collapse of morale.

The army had taken 15 million men from the farms and food prices had soared. An egg cost four times what it had in 1914, butter five times as much. The severe winter dealt the railways, overburdened by emergency shipments of coal and supplies, a crippling blow.<ref name=\"tames52\" />\n\nRussia entered the war with 20,000 locomotives; by 1917, 9,000 were in service, while the number of serviceable railway wagons had dwindled from half a million to 170,000. In February 1917, 1,200 locomotives burst their boilers and nearly 60,000 wagons were immobilized. In Petrograd, supplies of flour and fuel had all but disappeared.<ref name=\"tames52\" /> War-time [[prohibition of alcohol]] was enacted by Nicholas to boost patriotism and productivity, but instead damaged the treasury and funding of the war due to the treasury now being deprived of alcohol taxes.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[[#Warth|Warth]], p. 199</ref>\n\nOn 23 February 1917 in Petrograd, a combination of very severe cold weather and acute food shortages caused people to start to break shop windows to get bread and other necessities. In the streets, red banners appeared and the crowds chanted \"Down with the German woman! Down with [[Alexander Protopopov|Protopopov]]! Down with the war! Down with the Tsar!\"<ref name=\"tames52\" />\n\nPolice started to shoot at the populace from rooftops, which incited riots. The troops in the capital were poorly motivated and their officers had no reason to be loyal to the regime. They were angry and full of revolutionary fervor and sided with the populace.<ref name=\"tames53\">[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 53</ref>\n\nThe Tsar's Cabinet begged Nicholas to return to the capital and offered to resign completely. The Tsar, 800 kilometres (500&nbsp;mi) away, was misinformed by the Minister of the Interior, [[Alexander Protopopov]], that the situation was under control, and he ordered that firm steps be taken against the demonstrators. For this task, the Petrograd garrison was quite unsuitable. The cream of the old regular army had been destroyed in [[Poland]] and Galicia. In Petrograd, 170,000 recruits, country boys or older men from the working-class suburbs of the capital itself, remained to keep control under the command of wounded officers invalided from the front and cadets from the military academies. The units in the capital, although many bore the names of famous Imperial Guard regiments, were in reality rear or reserve battalions of these regiments, the regular units being away at the front. Many units, lacking both officers and rifles, had never undergone formal training.<ref name=\"tames53\" />\n\nGeneral Khabalov attempted to put the Tsar's instructions into effect on the morning of Sunday, 11 March 1917. Despite huge posters ordering people to keep off the streets, vast crowds gathered and were only dispersed after some 200 had been shot dead, though a company of the [[Volinsky Regiment]] fired into the air rather than into the mob, and a company of the [[Pavlovsky Regiment|Pavlovsky Life Guards]] shot the officer who gave the command to open fire. Nicholas, informed of the situation by Rodzianko, ordered reinforcements to the capital and suspended the Duma.<ref name=\"tames53\" /> However, it was too late.\n\nOn 12 March, the [[Volinsky Regiment]] mutinied and was quickly followed by the [[Semenovsky Regiment|Semenovsky]], the [[Izmaylovsky Regiment|Ismailovsky]], the [[:fr:R\u00e9giment de la Garde Litovski|Litovsky Life Guards]] and even the legendary [[Preobrazhensky Regiment]] of the Imperial Guard, the oldest and staunchest regiment founded by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]. The arsenal was pillaged, the Ministry of the Interior, Military Government building, police headquarters, the Law Courts and a score of police buildings were put to the torch. By noon, the fortress of Peter and Paul, with its heavy artillery, was in the hands of the insurgents. By nightfall, 60,000 soldiers had joined the revolution.<ref name=\"tames53\" />\n\nOrder broke down and members of the Duma and the [[Soviet (council)#Russian Revolution|Soviet]] formed a [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] to try to restore order. They issued a demand that Nicholas must abdicate. Faced with this demand, which was echoed by his generals, deprived of loyal troops, with his family firmly in the hands of the Provisional Government and fearful of unleashing civil war and opening the way for German conquest, Nicholas had little choice but to submit.\n\n==Revolution==\n===Abdication (1917)===\n{{Main|Abdication of Nicholas II}}\n{{wikisource|Abdication of Nicholas II}}\nNicholas had suffered a [[coronary occlusion]] only four days before his abdication.<ref>Massie, Robert K.

He first abdicated in favor of Alexei, but a few hours later changed his mind after advice from doctors that Alexei would not live long enough while separated from his parents, who would be forced into exile. Nicholas thus abdicated on behalf of his son, and drew up a new manifesto naming his brother, [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael]], as the next Emperor of all the Russians. He issued a statement but it was suppressed by the Provisional Government. Michael declined to accept the throne until the people were allowed to vote through a Constituent Assembly for the continuance of the monarchy or a republic. The abdication of Nicholas II and Michael's deferment of accepting the throne brought three centuries of the Romanov dynasty's rule to an end. The fall of [[Tsarist autocracy]] brought joy to liberals and socialists in Britain and France. The United States was the [[Russian Provisional Government#World recognition|first foreign government]] to recognize the Provisional government. In Russia, the announcement of the Tsar's abdication was greeted with many emotions, including delight, relief, fear, anger and confusion.<ref>[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 55</ref>\n\n===Possibility of exile===\nBoth the Provisional Government and Nicholas wanted the royal family to go into exile following his abdication, with the United Kingdom being the preferred option.<ref>Service 2018, p. 49</ref> The British government reluctantly offered the family [[Right of asylum|asylum]] on 19 March 1917, although it was suggested that it would be better for the Romanovs to go to a neutral country.

The Provisional Government only remained in power through an uneasy alliance with the [[Petrograd Soviet]], an arrangement known as \"The [[Dual power|Dual Power]]\". An initial plan to send the royal family to the northern port of [[Murmansk]] had to be abandoned when it was realised that the railway workers and the soldiers guarding them were loyal to the Petrograd Soviet, which opposed the escape of the tsar; a later proposal to send the Romanovs to a neutral port in the [[Baltic Sea]] via the [[Duchy of Finland]] faced similar difficulties.<ref>Service 2018, pp. 51-52 and pp. 68-69</ref>\n\n===Imprisonment===\n[[File:Nikolaus II.

In October 1917, however, the [[Bolsheviks]] seized power from Kerensky's Provisional Government; Nicholas followed the events in October with interest but not yet with alarm. [[Boris Soloviev]], the husband of [[Maria Rasputin]], attempted to organize a rescue with monarchical factions, but it came to nothing. Rumors persist that Soloviev was working for the Bolsheviks or the Germans, or both.<ref>Massie, K.

In the meantime he and his family occupied themselves with reading books, exercising and playing games; Nicholas particularly enjoyed chopping firewood.<ref>Service 2018, p. 150</ref> However, in January 1918, the guard detachment's committee grew more assertive, restricting the hours that the family could spend in the grounds and banning them from walking to church on a Sunday as they had done since October.<ref>Service 2018, p. 125</ref> In a later incident, the soldiers tore the [[epaulette]]s from Kobylinsky's uniform, and he asked Nicholas not to wear his uniform outside for fear of provoking a similar event.<ref>Service 2018, p. 157</ref>\n\nIn February 1918, the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (abbreviated to \"Sovnarkom\") in Moscow, the new capital, announced that the state subsidy for the family would be drastically reduced, starting on 1 March. This meant parting with twelve devoted servants and giving up butter and coffee as luxuries, even though Nicholas added to the funds from his own resources.<ref>Service 2018, pp. 128-129</ref> Nicholas and Alexandra were appalled by news of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], whereby Russia agreed to give up Poland, Finland, the Baltic States, most of Belarus, the Ukraine, the Crimea, most of the Caucasus, and small parts of Russia proper including areas around [[Pskov]] and [[Rostov-on-Don]].<ref>Massie, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'' (1967) p. 493-494</ref> What kept the family's spirits up was the belief that help was at hand.<ref>[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 62.</ref> The Romanovs believed that various plots were underway to break them out of captivity and smuggle them to safety. The Western Allies lost interest in the fate of the Romanovs after Russia left the war.

Not to be outdone, the soviet in [[Yekaterinburg]], the capital of the neighbouring [[Ural (region)|Ural region]], sent 400 Red Guards to exert their influence on the town.<ref>Service 2018, p. 145-148</ref> Disturbances between these rival groups and the lack of funds to pay the guard detachment caused them to send a delegation to Moscow to plead their case. The result was that Sovnarkom appointed their own [[commissar]] to take charge of Tobolsk and remove the Romanovs to Yekaterinburg, with the intention of eventually bringing Nicholas to a [[show trial]] in Moscow.<ref>Service 2018, p. 152-153</ref> The man selected was [[Vasily Yakovlev]], a veteran Bolshevik,<ref>Service 2018, p. 158</ref> Recruiting a body of loyal men ''en route'', Yakovlev arrived in Tobolsk on 22 April; he imposed his authority on the competing Red Guards factions, paid-off and [[Demobilization|demobilized]] the guard detachment, and placed further restrictions on the Romanovs.<ref>Service 2018, p. 160-161</ref> The next day, Yakovlev informed Kobylinsky that Nicholas was to be transferred to Yekaterinburg.

Yakovlev was able to communicate securely with Moscow by means of a [[David Edward Hughes|Hughes]]' [[teleprinter]] and obtained agreement to change their destination to Omsk, where it was thought that the leadership were less likely to harm the Romanovs.<ref>Service 2018, pp. 170-174</ref> Leaving Tyumen early on 28 April, the train left towards Yekaterinburg, but quickly changed direction towards Omsk. This led the Yekaterinburg leaders to believe that Yakovlev was a traitor who was trying to take Nicholas to exile by way of [[Vladivostok]]; telegraph messages were sent, two thousand armed men were mobilised and a train was dispatched to arrest Yakovlev and the Romanovs. The Romanovs' train was halted at Omsk station and after a frantic exchange of cables with Moscow, it was agreed that they should go to Yekaterinburg in return for a guarantee of safety for the royal family; they finally arrived there on the morning of 30 April.<ref>Service 2018, pp. 179-182</ref>\n\nThey were imprisoned in the two-storey [[Ipatiev House]], the home of the military engineer Nikolay Nikolayevich Ipatiev, which ominously became referred to as the \"house of special purpose\".

According to the account of Bolshevik officer [[Yakov Yurovsky]] (the chief executioner), in the early hours of 17 July 1918, the royal family was awakened around 2:00 am, got dressed, and were led down into a half-basement room at the back of the Ipatiev house. The pretext for this move was the family's safety, i.e. that anti-Bolshevik forces were approaching Yekaterinburg, and the house might be fired upon.<ref name=\"Nicholas 1998\">''Nicholas & Alexandra \u2013 The Last Imperial Family of Tsarist Russia'', Booth-Clibborn Editions, 1998, {{ISBN|1861540388}}</ref>\n\nPresent with Nicholas, Alexandra and their children were their doctor and three of their servants, who had voluntarily chosen to remain with the family: the Tsar's personal physician [[Eugene Botkin]], his wife's maid [[Anna Demidova]], and the family's chef, [[Ivan Kharitonov]], and footman, [[Alexei Trupp]].

When the family arrived in the basement, the former empress complained that there were no chairs for them to sit on. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Yurovsky ordered two chairs brought in, and when the empress and the heir were seated, the executioners filed into the room. Yurovsky announced to them that the Ural Soviet of Workers' Deputies had decided to execute them. A stunned Nicholas asked, \"What? What did you say?\" and turned toward his family. Yurovsky quickly repeated the order and Nicholas said, according to [[Peter Ermakov]], \"You know not what you do.\"\n\nThe executioners drew handguns and began shooting; Nicholas was the first to die. Yurovsky took credit afterwards for firing the first shot that killed the Tsar, but his protege \u2013 [[Grigory Petrovich Nikulin|Grigory Nikulin]] \u2013 said years later that Mikhail Medvedev had fired the shot that killed Nicholas. \"He fired the first shot.

On 14 August 2000, they were recognised by the [[synod]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. This time they were not named as martyrs, since their deaths did not result immediately from their Christian faith; instead, they were canonized as [[passion bearer]]s. According to a statement by the Moscow synod, they were glorified as saints for the following reasons:\n\n{{quote|In the last Orthodox Russian monarch and members of his family we see people who sincerely strove to incarnate in their lives the commands of the Gospel. In the suffering borne by the Royal Family in prison with humility, patience, and meekness, and in their martyrs' deaths in Yekaterinburg in the night of 17 July 1918 was revealed the light of the faith of Christ that conquers evil.}}\n\nHowever, Nicholas' canonization was controversial. The Russian Orthodox Church Abroad was split on the issue back in 1981, some members suggesting that the emperor was a weak ruler and had failed to thwart the rise of the Bolsheviks. It was pointed out by one priest that martyrdom in the Russian Orthodox Church has nothing to do with the martyr's personal actions but is instead related to why he or she was killed.<ref name=\"Massie\">[[#Massie1995|Massie (1995)]] pp. 134\u2013135.</ref>\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church inside Russia rejected the family's classification as martyrs because they were not killed on account of their religious faith. Religious leaders in both churches also had objections to canonising the Tsar's family because they perceived him as a weak emperor whose incompetence led to the revolution and the suffering of his people and made him partially responsible for his own murder and those of his wife, children and servants. For these opponents, the fact that the Tsar was, in private life, a kind man and a good husband and father or a leader who showed genuine concern for the peasantry did not override his poor governance of Russia.<ref name=\"Massie\" />\n\nDespite the original opposition, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] inside Russia ultimately recognised the family as \"passion bearers,\" or people who met their deaths with Christian humility. Since the [[Late 20th Century|late 20th century]], believers have attributed healing from illnesses or conversion to the Orthodox Church to their prayers to the children of Nicholas Maria and Alexei, as well as to the rest of the family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.serfes.org/royal/miracleofmaria.htm|title=''Miracle of the Child Martyr Grand Duchess Maria''|last=Serfes, Demetrios|first=|date=|year=2000|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=25 February 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.serfes.org/royal/miracleprayers.htm|title=A Miracle Through the Prayers of Tsar Nicholas II and Tsarevich Alexis|last=Serfes, Demetrios|first=|date=|year=2000|website=The Royal Martyrs of Russia|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=6 February 2007|access-date=25 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nHistorian Raymond Esthus states:\n: The contemporary assessments of Nicholas are remarkably uniform. He was described as shy, charming, gentle in disposition, fearful of controversy, indecisive, indulgent to his relatives, and deeply devoted to his family. Aleksandr Mosolov, who headed his Court Chancellery for sixteen years, wrote that Nicholas, though intelligent and well-educated, never adopted a definite, energetic attitude and loathed making a decision in the presence of others. Sergei Witte, who served Nicholas and his father for eleven years as Minister of Finance, commented that the Tsar was a well-intentioned child, but his actions were entirely dependent upon the character of his counselors, most of whom were bad.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Esthus, Raymond A. |title=Nicholas II and the Russo-Japanese War|journal=Russian Review|volume=40|issue=4|year=1981|pages=396\u2013411|jstor=129919|doi=10.2307/129919}}</ref>\n\nNicholas generally was considered for the most of the 20st century to have been incompetent at the colossal task of ruling the enormous Russian Empire,<ref>Ferro, Marc (1995) ''Nicholas II: Last of the Tsars''.

Historians admit that Nicholas was a \"good man\"\u2014the historical evidence of personal charm, gentleness, love of family, deep religious faith and strong Russian patriotism is too overwhelming to be denied\u2014but they argue that personal factors are irrelevant; what matters is that Nicholas was a bad tsar&nbsp;.... Essentially, the tragedy of Nicholas II was that he appeared in the wrong place in history.<ref>[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] pp. viii\u2013x.</ref>}}\n\nIn Russia, just after the rise of [[Soviet Union|the new regime]], the legacy of Nicholas II faced widespread criticism. Pavel Bykov, who in Russia wrote the first full account about the downfall of the Tsar for the [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|newly-formed Soviet propaganda's regime]], denounced Nicholas as a \"tyrant, who paid with his life for the age-old repression and arbitrary rule of his ancestors over the Russian people, over the impoverished and blood-soaked country\". Soviet-era historians noted that Nicholas II was not fit to be a statesman. It has been argued that he had a weak will and was manipulated by adventurist forces. His regime was condemned for extensive use of the army, police, and courts to destroy the revolutionary movement. He was criticised for fanning nationalism and chauvinism. With the punitive expeditions and courts-martial during the 1905 Revolution, the monarch became known as \"Nicholas the Bloody\". Nicholas's reign was seen as a time of suffering for Russians.<ref name=\"Kallistov\">{{cite book|author=Kallistov, D.

These included the Imperial German, Spanish, Italian, Danish and British armies.\n\nHe was [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of the [[Royal Scots Greys]] from 1894 until his death. On becoming Colonel-in-Chief he presented the Regiment with a white [[bearskin]], now worn by the bass drummer of the Pipes and Drums of the [[Royal Scots Dragoon Guards]].

Since his death, the Regiment has worn a black backing behind its cap badge as a symbol of [[mourning]].\n\n===Arms===\n[[File:Lesser CoA of the empire of Russia.svg|upright=1.05|center|thumb|Lesser Coat of Arms of the Empire of Russia and Letter Coat of Arms of the Emperor]]\n\n==Children==\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!Image!!Name!!Birth!!Death!!Notes\n|-\n|colspan=5|'''By [[Princess Alix of Hesse and by Rhine]]''' (6 June 1872&nbsp;\u2013 17 July 1918, married on 26 November 1894)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Olgachair.jpg|90px]] || [[Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna]]||{{OldStyleDate|15 November|1895|3 November}}||rowspan=\"5\"|[[Execution of the Romanov family|17 July 1918]]||rowspan=\"5\"|Shot, along with their parents, at [[Yekaterinburg]] by the [[Bolshevik]]s\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Tatiana Nikolaevna.jpg|90px]] || [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna]]||{{OldStyleDate|10 June|1897|29 May}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:GrandDuchessMaria1914formal2.jpg|90px]] || [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1899\u20131918)|Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna]]||{{OldStyleDate|26 June|1899|14 June}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna Crisco edit letters removed.jpg|90px]] || [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna]]||{{OldStyleDate|18 June|1901|5 June}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia.jpg|90px]] || [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich]]||{{OldStyleDate|12 August|1904|30 July}}\n|}\n\n== Wealth ==\nEstimates of Nicholas II's personal wealth have been vastly exaggerated. As ''Emperor of All The Russias'', and an [[Autocracy|autocrat]], the resources under his command were virtually incalculable. However, the vast majority of this was owned by the state as [[Crown property]]; the Romanov family's ''personal wealth'' was only a small fraction of this. As monarch, the income of Nicholas was 24 million gold [[Ruble|roubles]] per annum: this derived from a yearly allowance from the Treasury, and from the profits of Crown farmland.<ref name=\"Massie, Robert K. 1967, p64\">Massie, Robert K. ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', New York, Atheneum, 1967, p64</ref> From this income, he had to fund staff, the upkeep of imperial palaces and imperial theatres, annuities for the royal family, pensions, bequests, and other outgoings. \"Before the end of the year, the Tsar was usually penniless; sometimes he reached this embarrassing state by autumn.\"<ref name=\"Massie, Robert K. 1967, p64\"/> According to the Grand Marshal of the Court, Count Paul Benckendorff, the family's total financial resources amounted to between 12.5 and 17.5 million roubles.<ref>Clarke, William ''The Lost Fortune of the Tsars'', St. Martin's Griffin; Reprint edition, 1996, p101.</ref> As a comparison, Prince Felix Yusupov estimated his family's worth in real estate holdings alone as amounting to 50 million gold roubles.<ref>Ferrand, Jacques ''Les Princes Youssoupoff & les comtes Soumarkoff Elston'', Paris 1991</ref>\n\n== Documentaries and films ==\n{{See also|List of films about the Romanovs}}\nSeveral films about Nicholas II and his family have been made, including ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), ''[[Nicholas and Alexandra]]'' (1971), ''[[Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna]]'' (1986), ''[[Rasputin: Dark Servant of Destiny]]'' (1996 [[HBO]]), ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1997), and two Russian adaptations ''[[Assassin of the Tsar]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Romanovs: An Imperial Family]]'' (2000).\nIn 2017 the film ''[[Matilda (2017 film)]]'' was released. ''[[The Last Czars]]'' was released by Netflix in 2019.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Saints}}\n* [[Bibliography of the Russian Revolution and Civil War]]\n* [[Emperor railway station in Pushkin town]]\n\n==Note==\n* {{note|dates|O.S./N.S.}}Over the course of Nicholas's life, two calendars were used: the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] [[Julian Calendar]] and the [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]] [[Gregorian Calendar]].

Plan B involved a [[Schramm Inc.]] T130XD [[Air core drilling|air core drill]] owned by Geotec S.A. (a Chilean-American joint venture drilling company) that was chosen by Drillers Supply SA (the general contractor of Plan B) to widen one of the three 14&nbsp;centimetre (5.5&nbsp;in) boreholes that were already keeping the miners supplied with palomas. Normally, the drills are used to drill top holes for the oil and gas industry and for mineral exploration and water wells. This system employed Chilean Drillers Supply SA (DSI) personnel, Mijali Proestakis G.M. and Partner, Igor Proestakis Tech Mgr, Greg Hall C.E.O. (who joined his team on site for the last eight days of drilling) and their 18-centimetre (7&nbsp;in) drill pipe air core drill, a team of American drillers from [[Layne Christensen Company]] and specialized [[Down-the-hole drill|Down-The-Hole]] drilling hammers from [[Center Rock Inc.|Center Rock, Inc.]], of [[Berlin, Pennsylvania]].

While the Schramm rig, built by privately held [[Schramm Inc.|Schramm, Inc.]] of [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]], was already on the ground in Chile at the time of the mine collapse, additional drilling equipment was flown from the United States to Chile by [[United Parcel Service]].

The T-130 became operational on 5 September and worked in three stages. First, it needed to enlarge the 14-centimetre (5.5&nbsp;in) hole to a 30-centimetre (12&nbsp;in) hole. It then needed to drill the 30-centimetre (12&nbsp;in) hole into a 71&nbsp;centimetre (28&nbsp;in) diameter hole. \"If we tried to drill from a 14-centimetre (5.5&nbsp;in) hole to a 71-centimetre (28&nbsp;in) hole, the torque would be too high and it would ... put the drill bits under too much pressure,\" said Schramm, Inc. Latin American Regional Manager, Claudio Soto. However by reusing the same hole, there was still added pressure on the drill. Delays occurred because of issues with the neck of the drills caused by the angle of the drilling. Rescuers were unable to drill vertically since that would require placing the heavy rig on the unstable ground where the cave-in had happened, and the rescuers also had to avoid drilling into the production tunnels above the shelter. Soto added, during the rescue, \"It's a difficult hole. It's curved and deep.

Plan B involved a [[Schramm Inc.]] T130XD [[Air core drilling|air core drill]] owned by Geotec S.A. (a Chilean-American joint venture drilling company) that was chosen by Drillers Supply SA (the general contractor of Plan B) to widen one of the three 14&nbsp;centimetre (5.5&nbsp;in) boreholes that were already keeping the miners supplied with palomas. Normally, the drills are used to drill top holes for the oil and gas industry and for mineral exploration and water wells. This system employed Chilean Drillers Supply SA (DSI) personnel, Mijali Proestakis G.M. and Partner, Igor Proestakis Tech Mgr, Greg Hall C.E.O. (who joined his team on site for the last eight days of drilling) and their 18-centimetre (7&nbsp;in) drill pipe air core drill, a team of American drillers from [[Layne Christensen Company]] and specialized [[Down-the-hole drill|Down-The-Hole]] drilling hammers from [[Center Rock Inc.|Center Rock, Inc.]], of [[Berlin, Pennsylvania]].

While the Schramm rig, built by privately held [[Schramm Inc.|Schramm, Inc.]] of [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]], was already on the ground in Chile at the time of the mine collapse, additional drilling equipment was flown from the United States to Chile by [[United Parcel Service]].

The T-130 became operational on 5 September and worked in three stages. First, it needed to enlarge the 14-centimetre (5.5&nbsp;in) hole to a 30-centimetre (12&nbsp;in) hole. It then needed to drill the 30-centimetre (12&nbsp;in) hole into a 71&nbsp;centimetre (28&nbsp;in) diameter hole. \"If we tried to drill from a 14-centimetre (5.5&nbsp;in) hole to a 71-centimetre (28&nbsp;in) hole, the torque would be too high and it would ... put the drill bits under too much pressure,\" said Schramm, Inc. Latin American Regional Manager, Claudio Soto. However by reusing the same hole, there was still added pressure on the drill. Delays occurred because of issues with the neck of the drills caused by the angle of the drilling. Rescuers were unable to drill vertically since that would require placing the heavy rig on the unstable ground where the cave-in had happened, and the rescuers also had to avoid drilling into the production tunnels above the shelter. Soto added, during the rescue, \"It's a difficult hole. It's curved and deep.
