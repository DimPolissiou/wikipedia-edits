Examples of these causes include faults at [[power station]]s, damage to [[Electric power transmission|electric transmission lines]], [[Electrical substation|substations]] or other parts of the [[electricity distribution|distribution]] system, a [[short circuit]], [[Cascading failure#Cascading_failure_in_power_transmission|cascading failure]], [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]] or [[circuit breaker]] operation.\n\nPower failures are particularly critical at sites where the environment and public safety are at risk. Institutions such as [[hospital]]s, [[sewage treatment]] plants and [[mining|mines]], will usually have backup power sources such as [[emergency power system|standby generators]], which will automatically start up when electrical power is lost. Other critical systems, such as [[telecommunication]], are also required to have emergency power. The [[battery room]] of a telephone exchange usually has arrays of [[Lead\u2013acid battery|lead\u2013acid batteries]] for backup and also a socket for connecting a generator during extended periods of outage this can lead to death.\n\n== Types of power outage ==\n[[File:PowerOutageBlackout.svg|thumb|Blackout]]\n[[File:PowerOutageDropout.svg|thumb|Transient fault]]\nPower outages are categorized into three different phenomena, relating to the duration and effect of the outage:\n* A transient fault is a loss of power typically caused by a fault on a power line. Power is automatically restored once the fault is cleared.\n* A [[brownout (electricity)|brownout]]  is a drop in [[volt]]age in an electrical power supply. The term brownout comes from the dimming experienced by lighting when the voltage sags.  Brownouts can cause poor performance of equipment or even incorrect operation.\n* A blackout is the total loss of power to an area and is the most severe form of power outage that can occur. Blackouts which result from or result in [[power station]]s tripping are particularly difficult to recover from quickly. Outages may last from a few minutes to a few weeks depending on the nature of the blackout and the configuration of the electrical network.\n\n[[Rolling blackout]]s occur when demand for electricity exceeds supply, and allow some customers to receive power at the required voltage at the expense of other customers who get no power at all. They are a common occurrence in [[developing countries]], and may be scheduled in advance or occur without warning. They have also occurred in developed countries, for example in the [[California electricity crisis]] of 2000-2001, when government deregulation destabilized the wholesale electricity market. Blackouts are also used as a public safety measure, such as to prevent a [[gas leak]] from catching fire (for example, power was cut to several towns in response to the [[Merrimack Valley gas explosions]]), or to prevent wildfires around poorly maintained transmission lines (such as during the [[2019 California power shutoffs]]).\n\n== Protecting the power system from outages ==\n[[File:Crossed wires.JPG|thumb|right|Tree limbs creating a short circuit in electrical lines during a storm. This typically results in a power outage in the area supplied by these lines]]\nIn [[grid (electricity)|power supply networks]], the power generation and the electrical load (demand) must be very close to equal every second to avoid overloading of network components, which can severely damage them. [[Protective relay]]s and [[Fuse (electrical)|fuses]] are used to automatically detect overloads and to disconnect circuits at risk of damage.\n\nUnder certain conditions, a network component shutting down can cause current fluctuations in neighboring segments of the network leading to a [[cascading failure]] of a larger section of the network. This may range from a building, to a block, to an entire city, to an entire [[electrical grid]].\n\nModern power systems are designed to be resistant to this sort of cascading failure, but it may be unavoidable (see below). Moreover, since there is no short-term economic benefit to preventing rare large-scale failures, researchers have expressed concern that there is a tendency to erode the resilience of the network over time, which is only corrected after a major failure occurs.  In a 2003 publication, Carreras and co-authors claimed that reducing the likelihood of small outages only increases the likelihood of larger ones.<ref name=\"ref2003\" />  In that case, the short-term economic benefit of keeping the individual customer happy increases the likelihood of large-scale blackouts.\n\nThe [[United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources]] held a hearing in October 2018 to examine \"[[black start]]\", the process of restoring electricity after a system-wide power loss. The hearing's purpose was for Congress to learn about what the backup plans are in the electric utility industry in the case that the electric grid is damaged. Threats to the electrical grid include cyberattacks, solar storms, and severe weather, among others. For example, the \"[[Northeast blackout of 2003|Northeast Blackout of 2003]]\" was caused when overgrown trees touched high-voltage power lines. Around 55 million people in the U.S. and Canada lost power, and restoring it cost around $6 billion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/policy/15388-senate-hearing-examines-electric-industrys-ability-to-restore-power-after-system-wide-blackouts/|title=Senate hearing examines electric industry's ability to restore power after system-wide blackouts|last=Dave|first=Kovaleski|date=2018-10-15|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Protecting computer systems from power outages ==\nComputer systems and other electronic devices containing logic circuitry are susceptible to data loss or hardware damage that can be caused by the sudden loss of power.  These can include data networking equipment, video projectors, alarm systems as well as computers. To protect computer systems against this, the use of an [[uninterruptible power supply]] or 'UPS' can provide a constant flow of electricity if a primary power supply becomes unavailable for a short period of time. To protect against surges (events where voltages increase for a few seconds), which can damage hardware when power is restored, a special device called a [[surge protector]] that absorbs the excess voltage can be used.\n\n== Restoring power after a wide-area outage ==\nRestoring power after a wide-area outage can be difficult, as power stations need to be brought back on-line. Normally, this is done with the help of power from the rest of the grid. In the total absence of grid power, a so-called [[black start]] needs to be performed to [[Bootstrapping#Electric power grid|bootstrap]] the power grid into operation. The means of doing so will depend greatly on local circumstances and operational policies, but typically [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] utilities will establish localized 'power islands' which are then progressively coupled together. To maintain supply frequencies within tolerable limits during this process, demand must be reconnected at the same pace that generation is restored, requiring close coordination between power stations, transmission and distribution organizations.\n\n== Blackout inevitability and electric sustainability ==\n\n=== Self-organized criticality ===\n{{further|Self-organized criticality control}}\nIt has been argued on the basis of [[List of power outages|historical data]]<ref name=\"ref2002a\">[http://www.computer.org/proceedings/hicss/1435/volume2/14350063abs.htm IEEE Computer Society Conference Publishing Services<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and computer modeling<ref name=\"ref2002b\">[http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/HICSS2002-paper2.pdf Microsoft Word \u2013 HICSS2002-paper2<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=hh2014>{{cite journal\n | author = H.

Chaos 17, 2007.</ref> While blackout frequency has been shown to be reduced by operating it further from its critical point, it generally isn\u2019t economically feasible, causing providers to increase the average load over time or upgrade less often resulting in the grid moving itself closer to its critical point.  Conversely, a system past the critical point will experience too many blackouts leading to system-wide upgrades moving it back below the critical point.  The term critical point of the system is used here in the sense of statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics, representing the point where a system undergoes a phase transition; in this case the transition from a steady reliable grid with few cascading failures to a very sporadic unreliable grid with common cascading failures.  Near the critical point the relationship between blackout frequency and size follows a [[power law|power-law]] distribution.<ref name=hh2014 /><ref name=\"ref2007\" />  \n\n[[Cascading failure]] becomes much more common close to this critical point.  The power-law relationship is seen in both historical data and model systems.<ref name=\"ref2007\" />  The practice of operating these systems much closer to their maximum capacity leads to magnified effects of random, unavoidable disturbances due to aging, weather, human interaction etc.   While near the critical point, these failures have a greater effect on the surrounding components due to individual components carrying a larger load.  This results in the larger load from the failing component having to be redistributed in larger quantities across the system, making it more likely for additional components not directly affected by the disturbance to fail, igniting costly and dangerous cascading failures.<ref name=\"ref2007\" />  These initial disturbances causing blackouts are all the more unexpected and unavoidable due to actions of the power suppliers to prevent obvious disturbances (cutting back trees, separating lines in windy areas, replacing aging components etc.).  The complexity of most power grids often makes the initial cause of a blackout extremely hard to identify.\n\nOther leaders are dismissive of system theories that conclude that blackouts are inevitable, but do agree that the basic operation of the grid must be changed.  The [[Electric Power Research Institute]] champions the use of [[smart grid]] features such as power control devices employing [[phasor measurement unit|advanced sensors]] to coordinate the grid.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Saleh|first=M.

The term critical point of the system is used here in the sense of statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics, representing the point where a system undergoes a phase transition; in this case the transition from a steady reliable grid with few cascading failures to a very sporadic unreliable grid with common cascading failures.  Near the critical point the relationship between blackout frequency and size follows a [[power law|power-law]] distribution.<ref name=hh2014 /><ref name=\"ref2007\" />  \n\n[[Cascading failure]] becomes much more common close to this critical point.  The power-law relationship is seen in both historical data and model systems.<ref name=\"ref2007\" />  The practice of operating these systems much closer to their maximum capacity leads to magnified effects of random, unavoidable disturbances due to aging, weather, human interaction etc.   While near the critical point, these failures have a greater effect on the surrounding components due to individual components carrying a larger load.  This results in the larger load from the failing component having to be redistributed in larger quantities across the system, making it more likely for additional components not directly affected by the disturbance to fail, igniting costly and dangerous cascading failures.<ref name=\"ref2007\" />  These initial disturbances causing blackouts are all the more unexpected and unavoidable due to actions of the power suppliers to prevent obvious disturbances (cutting back trees, separating lines in windy areas, replacing aging components etc.).  The complexity of most power grids often makes the initial cause of a blackout extremely hard to identify.\n\nOther leaders are dismissive of system theories that conclude that blackouts are inevitable, but do agree that the basic operation of the grid must be changed.  The [[Electric Power Research Institute]] champions the use of [[smart grid]] features such as power control devices employing [[phasor measurement unit|advanced sensors]] to coordinate the grid.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Saleh|first=M.

It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator\u2019s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings of guilt, or a mental disturbance, result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.\n\nThe story was first published in [[James Russell Lowell]]'s ''The Pioneer'' in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is often considered a classic of the [[Gothic fiction]] genre and is one of Poe's best known short stories.\n\nThe specific motivation for murder (aside from the narrator's dislike of the old man's eye), the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, never wronged the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed. \n\nIt has been speculated that the old man is a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his \"vulture-eye\" represents some sort of veiled secret, or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in stark contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Clarke-TellTaleHeart.jpeg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], 1919]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is told from a [[first-person narrative]] of an unnamed narrator, who insists on being sane, but is suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes \"[[Hyperesthesia|over-acuteness of the senses]]\". \n\nThe old man with whom the narrator lives has a clouded, pale, blue \"[[vulture]]-like\" eye, which distresses and manipulates the narrator so much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator insists that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that the narrator cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room in order to shine a sliver of light onto the \"evil eye\". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to \"do the work\", thus making the narrator go further into distress.\n\nOn the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. But the narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the \"evil eye\", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike, jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, and ensures the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room, on the very spot where the body is concealed, and suspect nothing, as the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.\n\nThe narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware not only of the heartbeat but also of the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses, telling them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man's body.\n\n== Publication history ==\n[[File:Tell tale heart in pioneer.jpg|thumb|\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', page 29]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', a short-lived [[Boston]] magazine edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] who were listed as the \"proprietors\" on the front cover. The magazine was published in Boston by Leland and Whiting and in Philadelphia by Drew and Scammell.\n\nPoe was likely paid $10 for the story.<ref name=\"Silverman-p201\">Silverman, Kenneth.

The exactness with which the narrator recounts murdering the old man, as if the stealthy way in which they executed the crime were evidence of their sanity, reveals their [[monomania]] and [[paranoia]].

Yale University Press, 1987. p. 132; {{ISBN|0-300-03773-2}}</ref>\n\nThe narrator of \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is generally assumed to be a male.

New York City: Checkmark Books, 2001: 234. {{ISBN|0-8160-4161-X}}</ref> The story starts ''[[in medias res]]''. The story opens with a conversation already in progress between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way.

If their condition is believed to be true, what they hear at the end of the story may not be the old man's heart, but [[deathwatch beetle]]s. The narrator first admits to hearing beetles in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, deathwatch beetles are a sign of impending death. One variety of deathwatch beetle raps its head against surfaces, presumably as part of a mating ritual, while others emit ticking sounds.<ref name=\"Reilly\">Reilly, John E. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm The Lesser Death-Watch and \"'The Tell-Tale Heart'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218172125/http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm |date=December 18, 2009 }}\", in ''The American Transcendental Quarterly''.

It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator\u2019s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings of guilt, or a mental disturbance, result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.\n\nThe story was first published in [[James Russell Lowell]]'s ''The Pioneer'' in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is often considered a classic of the [[Gothic fiction]] genre and is one of Poe's best known short stories.\n\nThe specific motivation for murder (aside from the narrator's dislike of the old man's eye), the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, never wronged the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed. \n\nIt has been speculated that the old man is a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his \"vulture-eye\" represents some sort of veiled secret, or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in stark contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Clarke-TellTaleHeart.jpeg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], 1919]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is told from a [[first-person narrative]] of an unnamed narrator, who insists on being sane, but is suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes \"[[Hyperesthesia|over-acuteness of the senses]]\". \n\nThe old man with whom the narrator lives has a clouded, pale, blue \"[[vulture]]-like\" eye, which distresses and manipulates the narrator so much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator insists that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that the narrator cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room in order to shine a sliver of light onto the \"evil eye\". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to \"do the work\".\n\nOn the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. But the narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the \"evil eye\", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike, jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, and ensures the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room, on the very spot where the body is concealed, and suspect nothing, as the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.\n\nThe narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware not only of the heartbeat but also of the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses, telling them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man's body.\n\n== Publication history ==\n[[File:Tell tale heart in pioneer.jpg|thumb|\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', page 29]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', a short-lived [[Boston]] magazine edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] who were listed as the \"proprietors\" on the front cover. The magazine was published in Boston by Leland and Whiting and in Philadelphia by Drew and Scammell.\n\nPoe was likely paid $10 for the story.<ref name=\"Silverman-p201\">Silverman, Kenneth.

The exactness with which the narrator recounts murdering the old man, as if the stealthy way in which they executed the crime were evidence of their sanity, reveals their [[monomania]] and [[paranoia]]. The focus of the story is the perverse scheme to commit the [[perfect crime]].<ref>Kennedy, J. Gerald. ''Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing''. Yale University Press, 1987. p. 132; {{ISBN|0-300-03773-2}}</ref>\n\nThe narrator of \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is generally assumed to be a male. However, some critics have suggested a woman may be narrating; no pronouns are used to clarify one way or the other.<ref name=Sova234>Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York City: Checkmark Books, 2001: 234. {{ISBN|0-8160-4161-X}}</ref> The story starts ''[[in medias res]]''. The story opens with a conversation already in progress between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way.

This, however, is self-destructive, because in attempting to prove their sanity, they fully admit that they are guilty of murder.<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\">Robinson, E.

Despite this, they say, the idea of murder \"haunted me day and night.\"<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\"/>\n\nThe story's final scene shows the result of the narrator's feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. Like many characters in [[Gothic fiction]], they allow their nerves to dictate their nature.

A similar [[motif (narrative)|motif]] is used for Roderick Usher in \"[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]\" (1839) and in \"The Colloquy of Monos and Una\" (1841).<ref name=\"Reilly\"/> It is unclear, however, if the narrator actually has very [[:wikt:acute|acute]] senses, or if they are merely imagining things. If their condition is believed to be true, what they hear at the end of the story may not be the old man's heart, but [[deathwatch beetle]]s. The narrator first admits to hearing beetles in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, deathwatch beetles are a sign of impending death. One variety of deathwatch beetle raps its head against surfaces, presumably as part of a mating ritual, while others emit ticking sounds.<ref name=\"Reilly\">Reilly, John E. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm The Lesser Death-Watch and \"'The Tell-Tale Heart'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218172125/http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm |date=December 18, 2009 }}\", in ''The American Transcendental Quarterly''.

The plot of Manas revolves around a series of events that coincide with the history of the region in the 17th century, primarily the interaction of the Turkic-speaking people from the mountains to the south of the [[Dasht-i Qipchaq]] and the  [[Oirats|Oirat]] Mongols from the bordering area of [[Jungaria]].\n\nThe government of Kyrgyzstan celebrated the 1,000th anniversary of Manas in 1995. The [[eponymous]] hero of Manas and his [[Oirats|Oirat]] enemy Joloy were first found written in a Persian manuscript dated to 1792-3.<ref name=\"auto\">Tagirdzhanov, A. T. 1960. \"Sobranie istorij\". Majmu at-tavarikh, Leningrad.</ref> In one of its dozens of iterations, the epic poem consists of approximately 500,000 lines.\n\n==Narrative==\n[[Image:Kyrgyz Manaschi, Karakol.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Kyrgyz ''manaschi'' performing part of the epic poem at a yurt camp in [[Karakol]]]]\nThe epic tells the story of Manas, his descendants, and their exploits against various foes. The Epic of Manas is divided into three books.  The first is entitled \"Manas\", the second episode describes the deeds of his son Semetei, and the third of his grandson Seitek.\nThe epic begins with the destruction and difficulties caused by the invasion of the Oirats.  Zhakyp reaches maturity in this time as the owner of many herds without a single heir.  His prayers are eventually answered, and on the day of his son's birth, he dedicates a colt, [[Toruchaar]], born the same day to his son's service.  The son is unique among his peers for his strength, mischief, and generosity.  The Oirat learn of this young warrior and warn their leader.  A plan is hatched to capture the young Manas.  They fail in this task, and Manas is able to rally his people and is eventually elected and proclaimed as [[Khan (title)|khan]].\n\n\nMANAS IS BLACK and can say the n word\n\n\nManas expands his reach to include that of the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] of [[Moghulistan|Raviganjn]] on the southern border of [[Jungaria]].  One of the defeated Uighur rulers gives his daughter to Manas in marriage.  At this point, the Kyrgyz people chose, with Manas' help, to return from the Altai mountains to their \"ancestral lands\" in the mountains of modern-day [[Kyrgyzstan]].  Manas begins his successful campaigns against his neighbors accompanied by his forty companions.  Manas turns eventually to face the [[Afghan people]] to the south in battle, where after defeat the Afghans enter into an alliance with Manas.\nManas then comes into a relationship with the people of [[Transoxiana|m\u0101 war\u0101' an-n\u0101r]] through marriage to the daughter of the ruler of Bukhara.\n\nThe epic continues in various forms, depending on the publication and whim of the manaschi, or reciter of the epic.\n\n==History==\nThe epic poem's age is unknowable, as it was transmitted orally without being recorded. However, historians have doubted the age claimed for it since the turn of the 20th century. The primary reason is that the events portrayed occurred in the 16th and 17th centuries. Central Asian historian V. V.

Manas has more verses, though they are much shorter. \n\n==Recitation==\nManas is the classic centerpiece of Kyrgyz literature, and parts of it are often recited at Kyrgyz festivities by specialists in the epic, called ''Manaschi'' ({{lang-ky|\u041c\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0447\u044b}}). Manaschis tell the tale in a melodic chant unaccompanied by musical instruments.\n\nKyrgyzstan has many Manaschis. Narrators who know all three episodes of the epic (the tales of Manas, of his son Semetei and of his grandson Seitek) can acquire the status of Great Manaschi. Great Manaschis of the 20th century are [[Sagymbai Orozbak uulu|Sagymbai Orozbakov]], [[Sayakbay Karalaev]], Shaabai Azizov (pictured), Kaba Atabekov, Seidene Moldokova and Yusup Mamai.

An English translation of the version of Sagimbai Orozbakov by [[Walter May]] was published in 1995, in commemoration of the presumed 1000th anniversary of Manas' birth, and re-issued in two volumes in 2004. [[Arthur Thomas Hatto]] has made English translations of the Manas tales recorded by [[Shokan Valikhanov]] and [[Vasily Radlov]] in the 19th century.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{main|Manas Ordo}}\n[[Image:Manas Mausoleum.jpg|thumb|right|Picture of the alleged burial site of the eponymous hero of Manas]]\nManas is said to have been buried in the [[Talas Ala-Too Range|Ala-Too mountains]] in [[Talas Province]], in northwestern [[Kyrgyzstan]]. A [[mausoleum]] some 40&nbsp;km east of the town of Talas is believed to house his remains and is a popular destination for Kyrgyz travellers. Traditional Kyrgyz horsemanship games are held there every summer since 1995. An inscription on the mausoleum states, however, that it is dedicated to \"...the most famous of women, Kenizek-Khatun, the daughter of the emir Abuka\". Legend has it that Kanikey, Manas' widow, ordered this inscription in an effort to confuse her husband's enemies and prevent a defiling of his grave. The name of the building is \"Manastin Khumbuzu\" or \"The Dome of Manas\", and the date of its erection is unknown. There is a museum dedicated to Manas and his legend nearby the tomb.\n\nThe reception of the poem in the USSR was problematic. Politician and government official [[Kasym Tynystanov]] tried to get the poem published in 1925, but this was prevented by the growing influence of [[Stalinism]]. The first extract of the poem to be published in the USSR appeared in Moscow in 1946, and efforts to nominate the poem for the [[USSR State Prize|Stalin Prize]] in 1946 were unsuccessful. Ideologist [[Andrei Zhdanov]], Stalin's \"propagandist in chief\", prevented this, calling the poem an example of \"bourgeois cosmopolitanism\". The struggle continued inside Kyrgyzstan, with different newspapers and authors taking different sides; one of its supporters was [[Tugelbay Sydykbekov]]. By 1952 the poem was called anti-Soviet and anti-Chinese and condemned as pan-Islamic. [[Chinghiz Aitmatov]], in the 1980s, picked up the cause for the poem again, and in 1985 finally a statue for the hero was erected.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4pCCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA171|pages=165-84|first=Marlene|last=Laruelle|title=Kyrgyzstan beyond \"Democracy Island\" and \"Failing State\": Social and Political Changes in a Post-Soviet Society|editor1-first=Marlene|editor1-last=Laruelle|editor2-first=Johan|editor2-last=Engvall|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2015|isbn=9781498515177|chapter=Kyrgyzstan's Nationhood: From a Monopoly of Production to a Plural Market}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\n* [[Liz Williams]]' ''Nine Layers of Sky'' (2003) writes a modern day account of Manas as a nemesis of the [[Baghatur|Bogatyr]] [[Ilya Muromets]].\n* University of Manas - the name of university in the city of Bishkek.\n* The main international airport of Kyrgyzstan, [[Manas International Airport]] in [[Bishkek]], was named after the epic.\n* A [[minor planet]], [[3349 Manas]] was discovered by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh]] in 1979.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eHv1CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA439|page=439|title=Dictionary of Minor Planet Names|first=Lutz D.|last=Schmadel|edition=3|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|year=2013|isbn=9783662066157}}</ref>\n* The highest award in Kyrgyzstan is the Order of Manas\n* ''Manas'' - opera, composed by [[Abdylas Maldybaev]]\n\n==Translations==\n''Manas'' has been translated into 20 languages.

The plot of Manas revolves around a series of events that coincide with the history of the region in the 17th century, primarily the interaction of the Turkic-speaking people from the mountains to the south of the [[Dasht-i Qipchaq]] and the  [[Oirats|Oirat]] Mongols from the bordering area of [[Jungaria]].\n\nThe government of Kyrgyzstan celebrated the 1,000th anniversary of Manas in 1995. The [[eponymous]] hero of Manas and his [[Oirats|Oirat]] enemy Joloy were first found written in a Persian manuscript dated to 1792-3.<ref name=\"auto\">Tagirdzhanov, A. T. 1960. \"Sobranie istorij\". Majmu at-tavarikh, Leningrad.</ref> In one of its dozens of iterations, the epic poem consists of approximately 500,000 lines.\n\n==Narrative==\n[[Image:Kyrgyz Manaschi, Karakol.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Kyrgyz ''manaschi'' performing part of the epic poem at a yurt camp in [[Karakol]]]]\nThe epic tells the story of Manas, his descendants, and their exploits against various foes. The Epic of Manas is divided into three books.  The first is entitled \"Manas\", the second episode describes the deeds of his son Semetei, and the third of his grandson Seitek.\nThe epic begins with the destruction and difficulties caused by the invasion of the Oirats.  Zhakyp reaches maturity in this time as the owner of many herds without a single heir.  His prayers are eventually answered, and on the day of his son's birth, he dedicates a colt, [[Toruchaar]], born the same day to his son's service.  The son is unique among his peers for his strength, mischief, and generosity.  The Oirat learn of this young warrior and warn their leader.  A plan is hatched to capture the young Manas.  They fail in this task, and Manas is able to rally his people and is eventually elected and proclaimed as [[Khan (title)|khan]].\n\nManas expands his reach to include that of the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] of [[Moghulistan|Raviganjn]] on the southern border of [[Jungaria]].  One of the defeated Uighur rulers gives his daughter to Manas in marriage.  At this point, the Kyrgyz people chose, with Manas' help, to return from the Altai mountains to their \"ancestral lands\" in the mountains of modern-day [[Kyrgyzstan]].  Manas begins his successful campaigns against his neighbors accompanied by his forty companions.  Manas turns eventually to face the [[Afghan people]] to the south in battle, where after defeat the Afghans enter into an alliance with Manas.\nManas then comes into a relationship with the people of [[Transoxiana|m\u0101 war\u0101' an-n\u0101r]] through marriage to the daughter of the ruler of Bukhara.\n\nThe epic continues in various forms, depending on the publication and whim of the manaschi, or reciter of the epic.\n\n==History==\nThe epic poem's age is unknowable, as it was transmitted orally without being recorded. However, historians have doubted the age claimed for it since the turn of the 20th century. The primary reason is that the events portrayed occurred in the 16th and 17th centuries.

Manas has more verses, though they are much shorter. \n\n==Recitation==\nManas is the classic centerpiece of Kyrgyz literature, and parts of it are often recited at Kyrgyz festivities by specialists in the epic, called ''Manaschi'' ({{lang-ky|\u041c\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0447\u044b}}). Manaschis tell the tale in a melodic chant unaccompanied by musical instruments.\n\nKyrgyzstan has many Manaschis. Narrators who know all three episodes of the epic (the tales of Manas, of his son Semetei and of his grandson Seitek) can acquire the status of Great Manaschi. Great Manaschis of the 20th century are [[Sagymbai Orozbak uulu|Sagymbai Orozbakov]], [[Sayakbay Karalaev]], Shaabai Azizov (pictured), Kaba Atabekov, Seidene Moldokova and Yusup Mamai.

An English translation of the version of Sagimbai Orozbakov by [[Walter May]] was published in 1995, in commemoration of the presumed 1000th anniversary of Manas' birth, and re-issued in two volumes in 2004. [[Arthur Thomas Hatto]] has made English translations of the Manas tales recorded by [[Shokan Valikhanov]] and [[Vasily Radlov]] in the 19th century.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{main|Manas Ordo}}\n[[Image:Manas Mausoleum.jpg|thumb|right|Picture of the alleged burial site of the eponymous hero of Manas]]\nManas is said to have been buried in the [[Talas Ala-Too Range|Ala-Too mountains]] in [[Talas Province]], in northwestern [[Kyrgyzstan]]. A [[mausoleum]] some 40&nbsp;km east of the town of Talas is believed to house his remains and is a popular destination for Kyrgyz travellers. Traditional Kyrgyz horsemanship games are held there every summer since 1995. An inscription on the mausoleum states, however, that it is dedicated to \"...the most famous of women, Kenizek-Khatun, the daughter of the emir Abuka\". Legend has it that Kanikey, Manas' widow, ordered this inscription in an effort to confuse her husband's enemies and prevent a defiling of his grave. The name of the building is \"Manastin Khumbuzu\" or \"The Dome of Manas\", and the date of its erection is unknown. There is a museum dedicated to Manas and his legend nearby the tomb.\n\nThe reception of the poem in the USSR was problematic. Politician and government official [[Kasym Tynystanov]] tried to get the poem published in 1925, but this was prevented by the growing influence of [[Stalinism]]. The first extract of the poem to be published in the USSR appeared in Moscow in 1946, and efforts to nominate the poem for the [[USSR State Prize|Stalin Prize]] in 1946 were unsuccessful. Ideologist [[Andrei Zhdanov]], Stalin's \"propagandist in chief\", prevented this, calling the poem an example of \"bourgeois cosmopolitanism\". The struggle continued inside Kyrgyzstan, with different newspapers and authors taking different sides; one of its supporters was [[Tugelbay Sydykbekov]]. By 1952 the poem was called anti-Soviet and anti-Chinese and condemned as pan-Islamic. [[Chinghiz Aitmatov]], in the 1980s, picked up the cause for the poem again, and in 1985 finally a statue for the hero was erected.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4pCCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA171|pages=165-84|first=Marlene|last=Laruelle|title=Kyrgyzstan beyond \"Democracy Island\" and \"Failing State\": Social and Political Changes in a Post-Soviet Society|editor1-first=Marlene|editor1-last=Laruelle|editor2-first=Johan|editor2-last=Engvall|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2015|isbn=9781498515177|chapter=Kyrgyzstan's Nationhood: From a Monopoly of Production to a Plural Market}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\n* [[Liz Williams]]' ''Nine Layers of Sky'' (2003) writes a modern day account of Manas as a nemesis of the [[Baghatur|Bogatyr]] [[Ilya Muromets]].\n* University of Manas - the name of university in the city of Bishkek.\n* The main international airport of Kyrgyzstan, [[Manas International Airport]] in [[Bishkek]], was named after the epic.\n* A [[minor planet]], [[3349 Manas]] was discovered by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh]] in 1979.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eHv1CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA439|page=439|title=Dictionary of Minor Planet Names|first=Lutz D.|last=Schmadel|edition=3|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|year=2013|isbn=9783662066157}}</ref>\n* The highest award in Kyrgyzstan is the Order of Manas\n* ''Manas'' - opera, composed by [[Abdylas Maldybaev]]\n\n==Translations==\n''Manas'' has been translated into 20 languages.

Bitter cold set in, however, and a snowstorm threatened the expedition.  When the Indian camp was reached on 24 November, it was deserted.<ref name=Dyer />  Hopkins turned back, stopping at Fort Harrison to recover from the weather before proceeding to Vincennes.  By the time they reached [[Forts of Vincennes, Indiana|Fort Knox]], two hundred men were suffering from sickness or [[frostbite]].<ref name=A195>Allison, 195</ref>  Hopkins became so depressed from his successive losses that he resigned.<ref name=A195 />\nHopkins was brought before a Court of Inquiry for his actions in the Ill. Territory and Prophetstown.  He was cleared of any wrongdoing by the military tribunal and later ran for the Senate.\n\n==Modern investigations==\n\nAlthough it has been claimed there was no significant importance to this battle, General William Henry Harrison's military operational plan reflects the overall importance of the expedition. Hopkin's mission was twofold. First, he wanted to drive the hostile Kickapoos to Canada in response to the Fort Dearborn Massacre. Second, he wanted to burn Prophetstown again to drive the Aboriginal Confederacy also towards Canada and out of the Northwest Territories. Hopkin's men encountered 200 mounted Indian warriors which they had never experienced before. This and the weather were the two factors that drove Hopkin's expedition back to Fort Harrison.\n\nThe actual site of this esoteric American defeat is unknown.  The Carroll County Historical Association has erected a historic marker at the intersection of W 550 S Rd. and S 800 W Rd. in the town of Pyrmont (40.4673532, -86.6800204)  noting that the site is \"in a nearby ravine\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ingenweb.org/intippecanoe/spurs.htm | title = Spur's Defeat Historical Marker}}</ref>.  Purdue University and Indiana State archaeologists and historians suggest that there is little scholarly interest in the site and the event because of its lack of importance.  Local amateur reenactment groups have taken an interest in commemorating the event.  However, the found site has been verified by archeologists donating their time to have found the skirmish site and possible burial location of the 18 men.\n<ref>''Hopkins Orderly Book'', Indiana Historical Society Library, Indianapolis, Indiana{{page needed|date=November 2014}}</ref><ref>Logan Essary Ph.D. (1915), ''A History of Indiana'', W.

Bitter cold set in, however, and a snowstorm threatened the expedition.  When the Indian camp was reached on 24 November, it was deserted.<ref name=Dyer />  Hopkins turned back, stopping at Fort Harrison to recover from the weather before proceeding to Vincennes.  By the time they reached [[Forts of Vincennes, Indiana|Fort Knox]], two hundred men were suffering from sickness or [[frostbite]].<ref name=A195>Allison, 195</ref>  Hopkins became so depressed from his successive losses that he resigned.<ref name=A195 />\nHopkins was brought before a Court of Inquiry for his actions in the Ill. Territory and Prophetstown.  He was cleared of any wrongdoing by the military tribunal and later ran for the Senate.\n\n==Modern investigations==\n\nAlthough it has been claimed there was no significant importance to this battle, General William Henry Harrison's military operational plan reflects the overall importance of the expedition. Hopkin's mission was twofold. First, he wanted to drive the hostile Kickapoos to Canada in response to the Fort Dearborn Massacre. Second, he wanted to burn Prophetstown again to drive the Aboriginal Confederacy also towards Canada and out of the Northwest Territories. Hopkin's men encountered 200 mounted Indian warriors which they had never experienced before. This and the weather were the two factors that drove Hopkin's expedition back to Fort Harrison.\n\nThe actual site of this esoteric American defeat is unknown.  The Tippecanoe County Historical Association has erected a historic marker at the intersection of E 350 N Rd. and East County Line Rd. ({{coord|40|28|04|N|86|41|41|W|region:US-IN_type:landmark|display=inline}}) noting that the site is \"in a nearby ravine\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ingenweb.org/intippecanoe/spurs.htm | title = Spur's Defeat Historical Marker}}</ref>.  Purdue University and Indiana State archaeologists and historians suggest that there is little scholarly interest in the site and the event because of its lack of importance.  Local amateur reenactment groups have taken an interest in commemorating the event.  However, the found site has been verified by archeologists donating their time to have found the skirmish site and possible burial location of the 18 men.\n<ref>''Hopkins Orderly Book'', Indiana Historical Society Library, Indianapolis, Indiana{{page needed|date=November 2014}}</ref><ref>Logan Essary Ph.D. (1915), ''A History of Indiana'', W.
