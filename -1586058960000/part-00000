It promotes an [[equality before the law|equal]], [[democracy|democratic]] and [[globalization|unified]] Europe, open to all across national borders. Several hundred conferences, training and cultural events are organised across the network every year, and AEGEE also advocates for the needs and interests of European [[student]]s.\n\nThe short name \"AEGEE\" evokes the [[Aegean sea]], one of the birthplaces of democracy, and the full name includes the first [[parliament]] established in France, the [[French States-General|\u00c9tats G\u00e9n\u00e9raux]].<ref name=\"History page on aegee.org\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.aegee.org/about-aegee/the-brief-history-of-aegee/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211071448/http://www.aegee.org/about-aegee/the-brief-history-of-aegee/ |archive-date=11 December 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\nAEGEE has a yearly elected European board, the Comit\u00e9 Directeur<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aegee.org/contact/|title=AEGEE Europe: Contact|website=aegee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> with a head office in [[Brussels]], and a number of European-level working groups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aegee.org/wgs/|title=AEGEE Europe: Working Groups|website=aegee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> There is a large network of autonomous local groups, the antennae. Active members meet twice a year in Spring and Autumn in a general assembly called [[Agora]], hosted by a different antenna each time. Most candidates for positions at the European level are elected at the [[Agora]], which also ratifies the establishment or deletion of antennae, working groups and projects. There is also a smaller annual European Planning Meeting (EPM), intended to develop projects and campaigns and usually held in late winter: During the EPM, AEGEE also works on developing its Strategic Plan in an Action Agenda for the whole AEGEE network.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AEGEE Structure.png|thumb|left|The Structure of AEGEE]] -->\n\nThe association has '''no national level''', and it does not recognize the current national borders within Europe.\n\nAntennae are supported by the Network Commission, a group of experienced members elected by the [[Agora]] to help the network grow and develop. They provide advice, training and practical help, especially with local human resources and event organisation. Each Network Commissioner has responsibility for a number of locals across several national borders, which can be reorganised at each Agora to prevent the creation of any fixed national or regional division.\n\nEach city antenna is a separate [[legal person]] under its own local law, not under the direct control of the Comit\u00e9 Directeur. However, to become a part of the AEGEE network, prospective antennae must include the principles of AEGEE's statute within their own, and have them approved by the Comit\u00e9 Directeur and Juridical Commission.  They sign a contract called Convention d\u2019Adh\u00e9sion which allows AEGEE to have an antenna [[Liquidation|wound up]] in case of inactivity or serious misconduct.\n\nMembership of an antenna is generally open to anyone younger than 35 living in the local area, upon payment of a membership fee set by the local board. Many antennae concentrate their promotional activities on students at their home university, and are not very visible to outsiders.\n\nMost AEGEE events are open to non-members, however this tends to be poorly promoted except to local students. It is quite common for all participants to be from the host city or other AEGEE antennae. Some activities, most notably the statutory Agorae and EPMs and the [[Summer University]] project, are explicitly restricted to AEGEE members who must be approved by their home antenna's board.\n\nAEGEE was founded in [[France]] and still uses a number of French terms, but the main working language at European level is now [[English language|English]], which is also defined as the official language of the [[#Agora_(General_Assembly)|Agora]]. Most antennae use their own local language for their local activities, however local board members generally need a working knowledge of English.\n\nIts current board consists of six people. The statutory seventh board position remains vacant until the next board takes office.\n\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Comit\u00e9 Directeur 1 August 2019 \u2013 31 July 2020\n!Position\n!Name\n!AEGEE-Local\n!Nationality\n|-\n|President\n|Dani\u00ebl Amesz\n|[[Leiden]]\n|{{Flag|Netherlands}}\n|-\n|Secretary General\n|Monika Mojak\n|[[Warsaw]]\n|{{Flag|Poland}}\n|-\n|Financial Director\n|Refik Bar\u0131\u015f \u00d6z\u00e7elik \n|[[Istanbul]]\n|{{Flag|Turkey}}\n|-\n|Vice-President & External Relations Director\n|\u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez P\u00e9rez \n|[[Heidelberg]]\n|{{Flag|Spain}}\n|-\n|Communications Director\n|Batuhan \u00c7arik\u00e7i\n|[[\u0130zmir|Izmir]]\n|{{Flag|Turkey}}\n|-\n|Projects Director\n|Hanna Alaj\u00f5e\n|[[Tartu]]\n|{{Flag|Estonia}}\n|-\n|Network & HR Director\n|Oksana Prokopchenko\n|[[Sheffield]]\n|{{Flag|Ukraine}}\n|}<br />\n== Agora (General Assembly) ==\nAgora is AEGEE's general assembly, which takes place twice a year (usually in Spring and Autumn). \n\n== Affiliations and platform ==\nAEGEE-Europe is involved in bigger platforms and works with many other international institutions and organizations, in order to bring a students perspective to each one of the processes.\n\nAEGEE-Europe is a full member of the [[European Youth Forum]]. AEGEE has had 2 representatives in its history in the Board of Directors of [[European Youth Forum]].\n\nAEGEE-Europe is also full member of the [[European Movement International]] (EMI).\n\nAEGEE-Europe is also a full member in the [[Lifelong Learning Platform]] (LLLP).\n\nAEGEE-Europe was founding member and currently board members of the [[European Civic Forum]] (ECF). AEGEE-Europe has been in the board of the ECF several terms, always represented by the President of AEGEE-Europe.\n\nAEGEE-Europe works closely inside the [[Council of Europe]]. In 2013 AEGEE was elected to be part of the [[Advisory Council on Youth of the Council of Europe]].

It had the aim to overcome the paralysis of the [[European integration]] process at the time. [[Franck Biancheri]] led the whole process and soon all students involved wanted to turn the EGEE conference into an organisation being the platform for young Europeans. The aim of the founders was to create a space for young Europeans to discuss European matters and present their ideas to both the European and national institutions.\n:Due to the uniqueness of the idea at that time, EGEE was able to stimulate many students to establish antennae in their cities.\n\n; '''1986''' : Three EGEE working groups were formed: Sponsoring, Traineeships and Language Study.\n:EGEE hosts a conference on cross-border developments in [[Nijmegen]].\n:By the start of the academic year, EGEE has 26 branches and 6,000 members.\n:EGEE organizes in [[Heidelberg]], a conference on relations between the Far East and Europe.\n:EGEE organizes in [[Toulouse]], the first European Space Weekend.\n:EGEE organizes in [[Paris]] a conference on the [[pharmaceutical industry]] in Europe.\n:EGEE organizes in [[Munich]], a conference on the [[European Monetary System]].\n:EGEE organizes, together with the newspaper [[Le Monde]] the Night of the 7 European cities, broadcasting political debates about the future of Europe between students and high level politicians in seven different cities.\n\n; '''1987''' :EGEE persuades [[President of the French Republic|French president]] [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] to support funding for the [[Erasmus programme]], a student exchange program financed by the [[European Commission]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newropeans-magazine.org/en/?s=EGEE%2C+Mitterrand%2C+ERASMUS|title=AEGEE, the failed European Students' Forum|last=Kruitwagen|first=Bart|date=January 29, 2018|website=Newropeans Magazine|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>\n:'''Unblocking the ERASMUS programme''' is considered as main achievement of the association and [[:it:Domenico Lenarduzzi]], Head of Education of the [[European Commission]] at the time (1984\u201387), confirmed in this interview<ref>{{Citation|last=AEGEE Europe|title=The creation of the Erasmus Programme, and the role of AEGEE|date=2012-12-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpvbaBT8BCc|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpvbaBT8BCc The creation of the Erasmus Programme, and the role of AEGEE].\n\n; '''1988''' : The association changes its name from EGEE to AEGEE following a trademark dispute.\n:The [[Summer University]] Project was launched.

[[Brussels]]. It promotes an [[equality before the law|equal]], [[democracy|democratic]] and [[globalization|unified]] Europe, open to all across national borders. Several hundred conferences, training and cultural events are organised across the network every year, and AEGEE also advocates for the needs and interests of European [[student]]s.\n\nThe short name \"AEGEE\" evokes the [[Aegean sea]], one of the birthplaces of democracy, and the full name includes the first [[parliament]] established in France, the [[French States-General|\u00c9tats G\u00e9n\u00e9raux]].<ref name=\"History page on aegee.org\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.aegee.org/about-aegee/the-brief-history-of-aegee/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211071448/http://www.aegee.org/about-aegee/the-brief-history-of-aegee/ |archive-date=11 December 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\nAEGEE has a yearly elected European board, the Comit\u00e9 Directeur<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aegee.org/contact/|title=AEGEE Europe: Contact|website=aegee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> with a head office in [[Brussels]], and a number of European-level working groups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aegee.org/wgs/|title=AEGEE Europe: Working Groups|website=aegee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> There is a large network of autonomous local groups, the antennae. Active members meet twice a year in Spring and Autumn in a general assembly called [[Agora]], hosted by a different antenna each time. Most candidates for positions at the European level are elected at the [[Agora]], which also ratifies the establishment or deletion of antennae, working groups and projects. There is also a smaller annual European Planning Meeting (EPM), intended to develop projects and campaigns and usually held in late winter: During the EPM, AEGEE also works on developing its Strategic Plan in an Action Agenda for the whole AEGEE network.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AEGEE Structure.png|thumb|left|The Structure of AEGEE]] -->\n\nThe association has '''no national level''', and it does not recognize the current national borders within Europe.\n\nAntennae are supported by the Network Commission, a group of experienced members elected by the [[Agora]] to help the network grow and develop. They provide advice, training and practical help, especially with local human resources and event organisation. Each Network Commissioner has responsibility for a number of locals across several national borders, which can be reorganised at each Agora to prevent the creation of any fixed national or regional division.\n\nEach city antenna is a separate [[legal person]] under its own local law, not under the direct control of the Comit\u00e9 Directeur. However, to become a part of the AEGEE network, prospective antennae must include the principles of AEGEE's statute within their own, and have them approved by the Comit\u00e9 Directeur and Juridical Commission.  They sign a contract called Convention d\u2019Adh\u00e9sion which allows AEGEE to have an antenna [[Liquidation|wound up]] in case of inactivity or serious misconduct.\n\nMembership of an antenna is generally open to anyone younger than 35 living in the local area, upon payment of a membership fee set by the local board. Many antennae concentrate their promotional activities on students at their home university, and are not very visible to outsiders.\n\nMost AEGEE events are open to non-members, however this tends to be poorly promoted except to local students. It is quite common for all participants to be from the host city or other AEGEE antennae. Some activities, most notably the statutory Agorae and EPMs and the [[Summer University]] project, are explicitly restricted to AEGEE members who must be approved by their home antenna's board.\n\nAEGEE was founded in [[France]] and still uses a number of French terms, but the main working language at European level is now [[English language|English]], which is also defined as the official language of the [[#Agora_(General_Assembly)|Agora]]. Most antennae use their own local language for their local activities, however local board members generally need a working knowledge of English.\n\nIts current board consists of six people. The statutory seventh board position remains vacant until the next board takes office.\n\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Comit\u00e9 Directeur 1 August 2019 - 31 July 2020\n!Position\n!Name\n!AEGEE-Local\n!Nationality\n|-\n|President\n|Dani\u00ebl Amesz\n|[[Leiden]]\n|{{Flag|Netherlands}}\n|-\n|Secretary General\n|Monika Mojak\n|[[Warsaw]]\n|{{Flag|Poland}}\n|-\n|Financial Director\n|Refik Bar\u0131\u015f \u00d6z\u00e7elik \n|[[Istanbul]]\n|{{Flag|Turkey}}\n|-\n|Vice-President & External Relations Director\n|\u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez P\u00e9rez \n|[[Heidelberg]]\n|{{Flag|Spain}}\n|-\n|Communications Director\n|Batuhan \u00c7arik\u00e7i\n|[[\u0130zmir|Izmir]]\n|{{Flag|Turkey}}\n|-\n|Projects Director\n|Hanna Alaj\u00f5e\n|[[Tartu]]\n|{{Flag|Estonia}}\n|-\n|Network & HR Director\n|Oksana Prokopchenko\n|[[Sheffield]]\n|{{Flag|Ukraine}}\n|}<br />\n== Agora (General Assembly) ==\nAgora is AEGEE's general assembly, which takes place twice a year (usually in Spring and Autumn). \n\n== Affiliations and platform ==\nAEGEE-Europe is involved in bigger platforms and works with many other international institutions and organizations, in order to bring a students perspective to each one of the processes.\n\nAEGEE-Europe is a full member of the [[European Youth Forum]]. AEGEE has had 2 representatives in its history in the Board of Directors of [[European Youth Forum]].\n\nAEGEE-Europe is also full member of the [[European Movement International]] (EMI).\n\nAEGEE-Europe is also a full member in the [[Lifelong Learning Platform]] (LLLP).\n\nAEGEE-Europe was founding member and currently board members of the [[European Civic Forum]] (ECF). AEGEE-Europe has been in the board of the ECF several terms, always represented by the President of AEGEE-Europe.\n\nAEGEE-Europe works closely inside the [[Council of Europe]]. In 2013 AEGEE was elected to be part of the [[Advisory Council on Youth of the Council of Europe]]. AEGEE is also involved in the Conference of INGOs and works closely with the Youth Department and the [[European Youth Foundation]] of the [[Council of Europe]].\n\nAEGEE-Europe has consultative status at the [[United Nations]], working closely with [[UNESCO]], [[ECOSOC]], [[UNEP]], [[UNFPA]], [[UNDP]] and other agencies and bodies.\n\nAEGEE-Europe works with the World Bank, the OECD ([[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]) and the OSCE ([[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]]).\n\nAEGEE-Europe is a member of IFISO ([[Informal Forum of International Student Organizations]]).\n\n==History==\n; '''1985''' : The association was born the '''16 April 1985''' as a result of the EGEE 1 conference ('''\u00c9tats G\u00e9n\u00e9raux des \u00c9tudiants de l\u2019Europe'''), when it held its first event in Paris: an assembly of students from [[Paris]], [[Leiden]], [[London]], [[Madrid]], [[Milan]] and [[Munich]], organised by founding president [[Franck Biancheri]] in cooperation with five [[Grandes \u00c9coles]] in [[Paris]].

During the [[Second World War]] her company experienced hardships due to a public that was suspicious of inquisitive representatives who would poll public sentiment about the war and the prime minister; in addition there was a reluctance among companies to spend money on market research, which they felt was unnecessary in a time of rationing. Nevertheless she came to the attention of Sir [[Keith Murdoch]], who offered her the opportunity to set up Australia's first public-opinion research subsidiary. When Sir [[Frank Packer]] made a counter-offer she accepted, and made Ashby Research Services a subsidiary of [[Australian Consolidated Press]].\n\nAshby employed mainly women to survey housewives, who she considered to have great purchasing power, despite her view that most housewives were timid and shy creatures beholden to their husbands. After the war she continued innovative research, establishing the Ashby Consumer Panel, in which households maintained regular diaries that enabled her to gather continuous market research data. Toward the end of her life, Sir Frank Packer sold her back her company for the same price as he purchased it, before ailing health caused Ashby to sell her company to Beacon Research.\n\n==Early life==\nAshby was born on 08 June 1908 at New Sawley in [[Derbyshire]], England to Bertha, {{nee|Powell}}, and her husband, brickmaker Walter Bertrand Ashby. She was their fourth child; her siblings included Bertha Joan Prior and William Bertrand Ashby.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"billashby\"/><ref name=\"eldest-sister\"/> The family migrated to [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]] in Melbourne when Ashby was five, and she was educated in Auburn, Hawthorn, and Camberwell state schools.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1923 Ashby started two years of training at a business college run by [[Frederick Zerko]],<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> after which she took up a secretarial job at [[J. Walter Thompson|J. Walter Thompson Australia Pty Ltd]] (colloquially known as JWT).<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> The company downsized considerably when it lost the [[General Motors]] account, due to the [[Great Depression]], and Ashby was relocated to the Sydney office. There she worked in the market research and psychology departments under [[Rudolph Simmat]],<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> and by 1933 was [[Bill McNair|William McNair]]'s assistant.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> Both Simmat and McNair gave her valuable experience and mentoring in market research; Simmat had authored one of the first studies into Australian market research,<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> and McNair later formed the McNair Survey, a company that undertook major television and radio audience ratings surveys.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> In 1933 she resigned and moved to London,<ref name=\"women-in-sport\"/> where she worked first for the [[London Press Exchange]], and then for the Charles W. Hobson agency.<ref name=\"crawford-p6\"/> Though the ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'' notes that \"she spent much time reorganizing his library\",<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Ashby found the contacts invaluable and the experience highly rewarding<ref name=\"dictsyd-via-mcnair\"/>\u2014particularly in that it taught her \"to be always on the look-out for ideas for campaigns\".<ref name=\"popcaanz-via-corresp\"/> While in London she attended conferences and seminars in Europe and North America.<ref name=\"crawford-p6\"/> During this time she also worked with the German [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Ministry for Propaganda]], conducting research into how to improve relations between Britain and Germany, though when it was leaked to the public, sentiment was such that she immediately withdrew from that program.<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\"/>\n\n==Formation of the Ashby Research Service==\n[[File:Mrs Right and Mrs Wrong - Sylvia Ashby.png|thumb|Sylvia Ashby showing the difference between \"Mrs. Right\" and \"Mrs. Wrong\"]]\nAshby returned to Sydney in 1936 and started her own business, the Ashby Research Service. Although she almost immediately secured a contract with an advertising agency to conduct a three-month-long survey of Melbourne's leading evening newspaper ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'',<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> it was nevertheless a difficult start. She later recounted that her initial problems were partly caused by \"business executives [who] appeared to know little and to care even less\" about market research;<ref name=\"routledge\"/> this was compounded by prevailing societal views of women, which were not positive toward women who ran their own business.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Yet Ashby became a tireless promoter of market research in a market that did not yet see the value of such research, let alone paying for it. In a profile for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' she was described as \"perhaps the only woman in Australia who has specialised in market research\".<ref name=\"smh-1937\"/> Ashby herself later declared that she was the only woman in the British Empire conducting an independent market research bureau.<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\"/> She persevered against the challenges, and within five years her clients included the [[Australian Gas Light Company]], Pick-me-up Condiment Co. Ltd,<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> the [[National Bank of Australasia]], Dunlop-Perdriau rubber goods, [[Bushells]], the ''[[Australian Women's Weekly]]'' and a number of advertising agencies.<ref name=\"crawford-p8\"/>\n\nAshby's method was to employ mainly women, who she believed were more conscientious and effective investigators than men. In particular she found female investigators \"much more patient with other women\", and that \"women will talk to another woman more freely\".<ref name=\"smh-1938\"/> She preferred unmarried women, as she believed that \"a single woman is better able to concentrate solely upon the problem on hand [and] has no home worries to distract her [and] has more time to keep herself physically fit\". Ashby essentially believed that unmarried women had \"a singleness of purpose denied to the married woman\".<ref name=\"unmarried-women-views\"/> She found focused interviews directly with housewives the most effective approach to market research. In a later interview with ''[[Australian Women's Weekly]]'', she showed two small wooden, jointed [[mannequins]]\u2014one showing \"Mrs. Right\" and one \"Mrs. Wrong\". Mrs. Right, she explained, \"is erect, relaxed; the left arm (holding her bag and papers) is slightly to the rear; the right arm is forward; the head is slightly tilted\u2014she is the epitome of confidence.\" Mrs. Wrong \"is a bundle of nerves; head downcast, bag clutched to her\u2014the epitome of apologetic timidity.\" Those who displayed a lack of appropriate deportment, she maintained, would cause suspicion and sometimes hostility, and the interviewee would be unresponsive to questioning, leading to poor survey results.<ref name=\"womens-weekly-1961\"/>\n\n==Second World War==\nBy 1939 Britain had declared war on Germany. The [[Second World War]] caused major issues for a marketing research company that undertook direct interviews &mdash; quite a few of Ashby's researchers were reported by citizens suspicious of those asking questions during a time of war, and consequently they were detained by police. At one point Ashby herself was vigorously questioned over several hours by the police, who accused her of \"disloyalty\" and threatened her with arrest if she did not stop surveying popular opinion on the war and the [[Australian Prime Minister|Prime Minister]].<ref name=\"crawford-via-ashby\"/> Furthermore, rationing meant that firms were less concerned with marketing efforts as the availability of goods became more scarce and consumers were more likely to buy what they could find.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> Despite this, she largely ignored the threats of the authorities and continued to conduct surveys on topics such as conscription, the war effort and war psychology.<ref name=\"dictsydney-via-ashbyrecords\"/>\n\nAshby hired John Stuart Lucy, a journalist from New Zealand, to help with her business. She later married him in 1939. Lucy was to later form a rival research firm, but this did not seem to cause any problems in the marriage &mdash; Ashby told ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' that \"we're rivals only in business. My husband completely approves of my career.\"<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> She gave birth to a daughter, Susan, in 1940 and a son, Richard, in 1943.<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> Despite her previously expressed views on the capabilities of married women at work, the ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'' notes that \"busy and ambitious as she was, Sylvia did not neglect her two children. On weekends her time was devoted to them; school holidays were enjoyed together, sometimes at 'the farm', her husband's property at Narrabeen. At home there was always a maid or housekeeper; Susan was sent to Frensham and Richard to Geelong Church of England Grammar School.\"<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\nHer wartime polling gained the attention of Sir [[Keith Murdoch]], who not only ran the ''[[Herald & Weekly Times]]'' but was also briefly Director-General of Information for the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] in 1940. Murdoch commissioned Ashby to run research into the war effort, and Ashby ran the first Australia-wide public opinion survey.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Murdoch later invited her to join him in establishing a public opinion subsidiary. Sir [[Frank Packer]], rival proprietor of [[Australian Consolidated Press]] (ACP), got wind of the offer however, and put in a counter offer to make the Ashby Research Service a subsidiary of ACP. As Ashby had done work for the ''Australian Women's Weekly'' before the war, she chose to accept Packer's offer over Murdoch's.<ref name=\"crawford-p9\"/> Murdoch then approached [[Roy Morgan Research|Roy Morgan]] to conduct opinion polling, and he organised the Australian Gallop Poll. From 1942 to 1944 the Ashby Research Service was renamed to the Daily Telegraph Research Bureau, but was renamed back to the Ashby Research Service after the war ended.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' in her capacity as Director of the Daily Telegraph Research Bureau, Ashby caused a stir in July 1942 by proposing that the nation combine every two electorates and then subdivide them again into two electorates, to which women would elect a woman in one electorate, and men would elect a man in the second electorate. She felt this was necessary because \"some of those who aspire to leadership unfortunately appear to have the habit of drawing upon themselves most unfavourable publicity, which distresses the average woman, who at heart (although her husband never guesses it) is a timid and shy creature, full of complexes, which cause her to withdraw into herself at the slightest sign of any thing in the nature of a public brawl.\" By allowing each citizen to only vote for their own gender, Ashby believed this would encourage a better class of female candidate and women would become more politically engaged.<ref name=\"ashby-vote-proposal\"/>\n\n==Post-war==\nAfter the Second World War ended, the Ashby Research Service saw a resurgence in business: surveys in 1945 included 14 for clients and 30 for ACP; in 1946 the number of surveys rose significantly, to 30 and 42 respectively.<ref name=\"postwar-surveys\"/> But the war had shown Ashby that revenue could be affected by external events; so she decided to conduct ongoing research surveys alongside her commissioned research to build up her existing data and attract new work. To this end, in 1945 she established the Ashby Consumer Panel as a trial in NSW and rolled out Australia-wide in 1947. The panel directly polled households through diaries of their buying habits. Householders would return from shopping and record their purchases and observations directly into an Ashby Consumer Purchase Record. By 1964 the Ashby Research Service boasted in an advertisement that 6165 households (containing 18,192 individuals) were keeping day-to-day records for the Service. To maintain quality, 237 regular employees inspected the logs, which were then sampled for checking by supervisors. The advertisement claimed that it was \"the largest survey-group permanently employed in the South Hemisphere\".<ref name=\"newspaper-news-advert\"/> Households were not paid, but received a subscription to ''The Women's Weekly''.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\nBecause it was important to maintain credibility and relevance, the Ashby Research Service maintained a statistical library, managed by their professional statisticians. Australia's post-war relaxation of immigration policies encouraged workers from Europe to emigrate to Australia, so Ashby's service employed workers who spoke a variety of European languages to ensure the consistency and accuracy of their data.<ref name=\"crawford-p13\"/> She also regularly requested new equipment from Packer, including an electric calculator and a punching machine,<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> in light of this influx and the more general [[Mid-twentieth century baby boom|post-war population boom]]. \n\nBetween September to November 1953 Ashby undertook an overseas business trip to the UK and the US. This caused ructions with the notoriously tight-fisted Packer, who did not necessarily believe in the benefits of such a trip. In a letter to Packer in June 1953, she argued forcefully for the trip, writing:\n\n{{quote|Mr Packer ... it is essential that we keep up with movements in the technique of Market Research, and it is also essential for our prestige that I go overseas. The twelve years in your employ is a long time to \u2018stay put\u2019 ... and when other Research people are constantly coming and going ... After ten years of most profitable operation, through lack of co-operation from Consolidated Press, the Ashby Research Service latterly has been hindered from progressing ... . Periodical overseas visits are essential to a Director of Market Research and this was discussed prior to the signing of my initial contract.<ref name=\"letter-packer-overseas-travel\"/>}}\n\nHer travels impressed on her that her work was first class and ahead of the rest of the world. ''The Argus'' reported that during her 1953 overseas trip \"she tried to find a woman counterpart, 'But without success, I'm afraid. It seems I'm quite unique'.\"<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> On a 1958 business trip she was unimpressed with the work of [[Johnson & Johnson]]'s consumer panels and noted that Alfred Politz Research Inc.\u2014a leading market research company based in [[Manhattan]]\u2014did not conduct audits and \"do not provide anything resembling a standardised service\".<ref name=\"crawford-p17\"/>\n\nAs the success of the Ashby Research Service grew, so too did their competition. Profits decreased between 1965 to 1966, and in 1968 the firm recorded a loss. This caused ACP to demand a full audit; but Ashby put together a strident defence, pointing out that it was the only time in the subsidiary's history that their expenditure exceeded their revenue. She referred to a particularly problematic client and the costs of using a computer. To her frustration, Ashby found that her subsidiary was being underused by ACP, and regularly wrote to Packer to suggest ways of using her services.<ref name=\"crawford-p18-19\"/>\n\n==Australian Research Service buy-back and death==\nIn 1974, both Packer and Ashby were looking to retire. In a magnanimous gesture to Ashby, Packer sold the Ashby Research Service back to her for the same amount that he had paid for it in 1941 &mdash; $2,800.<ref name=\"crawford-p21\"/> Ashby, who was by this time becoming very ill, sold the business to Beacon Research Co. Pty Ltd.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> As her health continued to fail, she became confined to a wheelchair, before finally dying of cancer on 9 September 1978 at [[Palm Beach, New South Wales]] and was cremated.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\n==External links==\n* [https://trove.nla.gov.au/people/1471050?c=people Sylvia Rose Ashby] - [[Trove Australia]]\n* [http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110314880 Ashby Research Service records, ca. 19] - Archives [[State Library of NSW]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"austdictbio\">{{ref|goot-1993|\u03b7}} Goot 1993</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"eldest-sister\">{{ref|table-talk-1929|\u03be}} ''Table Talk'' 1929, p. 64</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dict-sydney\">{{ref|crawford-dictsyd-2018|\u03b5}} Crawford 2018</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"children\">{{ref|weekly-times-1946|\u03bf}}''Weekly Times'' 1946, p. 26</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"popcaanz\">{{ref|riley-2016|\u03b8}} Riley 2016</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\">{{ref|daily-examiner-1939|\u03ba}} ''Daily Examiner'' 1939, p. 4</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"women-in-sport\">{{ref|daily-telegraph-1934|\u03bb}} ''The Daily Telegraph'' 1934, p. 16</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"crawford-p6\">{{ref|crawford-2019|\u03b6}} Crawford 2019, p. 6</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dictsyd-via-mcnair\">{{ref|crawford-dictsyd-2018|\u03b5}} Crawford 2018; citing {{ref|ashby-1979|\u03b3}} Ashby 1979, pp. 8&ndash;9</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dictsydney-via-ashbyrecords\">{{ref|crawford-dictsyd-2018|\u03b5}} Crawford 2018; citing 'War Effort', 'Conscription, 1941', '2nd Conscription Survey, February 1942', 'War Psychology, September 1942', 'Election Survey, May 1943', 'Wartime and Political Knowledge, December 1942', Box 78, Ashby Research Service records, c1937-c1972 MLMSS 8907, [[Mitchell Library]], [[State Library of New South Wales]]</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"popcaanz-via-corresp\">{{ref|riley-2016|\u03b8}} Riley 2016, p. 34; citing [[Mitchell Library]] Correspondence files, MLMSS 8907.</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"routledge\">{{ref|crawford-routeledge-2016|\u03b4}} Crawford 2016; citing {{ref|ashby-1979|\u03b3}} Ashby 1979, pp. 8&ndash;9</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"billashby\">[[State Library of New South Wales]], MLMSS 8907, Box 70, 'Letter from W.

Nevertheless she came to the attention of Sir [[Keith Murdoch]], who offered her the opportunity to set up Australia's first public-opinion research subsidiary. When Sir [[Frank Packer]] made a counter-offer she accepted, and made Ashby Research Services a subsidiary of [[Australian Consolidated Press]].\n\nAshby employed mainly women to survey housewives, who she considered to have great purchasing power, despite her view that most housewives were timid and shy creatures beholden to their husbands. After the war she continued innovative research, establishing the Ashby Consumer Panel, in which households maintained regular diaries that enabled her to gather continuous market research data. Toward the end of her life, Sir Frank Packer sold her back her company for the same price as he purchased it, before ailing health caused Ashby to sell her company to Beacon Research.\n\n==Early life==\nAshby was born on 08 June 1908 at New Sawley in [[Derbyshire]], England to Bertha, {{nee|Powell}}, and her husband, brickmaker Walter Bertrand Ashby. She was their fourth child; her siblings included Bertha Joan Prior and William Bertrand Ashby.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"billashby\"/><ref name=\"eldest-sister\"/> The family migrated to [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]] in Melbourne when Ashby was five, and she was educated in Auburn, Hawthorn, and Camberwell state schools.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1923 Ashby started two years of training at a business college run by [[Frederick Zerko]],<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> after which she took up a secretarial job at [[J. Walter Thompson|J. Walter Thompson Australia Pty Ltd]] (colloquially known as JWT).<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> The company downsized considerably when it lost the [[General Motors]] account, due to the [[Great Depression]], and Ashby was relocated to the Sydney office. There she worked in the market research and psychology departments under [[Rudolph Simmat]],<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> and by 1933 was [[Bill McNair|William McNair]]'s assistant.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> Both Simmat and McNair gave her valuable experience and mentoring in market research; Simmat had authored one of the first studies into Australian market research,<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> and McNair later formed the McNair Survey, a company that undertook major television and radio audience ratings surveys.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> In 1933 she resigned and moved to London,<ref name=\"women-in-sport\"/> where she worked first for the [[London Press Exchange]], and then for the Charles W. Hobson agency.<ref name=\"crawford-p6\"/> Though the ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'' notes that \"she spent much time reorganizing his library\",<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Ashby found the contacts invaluable and the experience highly rewarding<ref name=\"dictsyd-via-mcnair\"/>\u2014particularly in that it taught her \"to be always on the look-out for ideas for campaigns\".<ref name=\"popcaanz-via-corresp\"/> While in London she attended conferences and seminars in Europe and North America.<ref name=\"crawford-p6\"/> During this time she also worked with the German [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Ministry for Propaganda]], conducting research into how to improve relations between Britain and Germany, though when it was leaked to the public, sentiment was such that she immediately withdrew from that program.<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\"/>\n\n==Formation of the Ashby Research Service==\n[[File:Mrs Right and Mrs Wrong - Sylvia Ashby.png|thumb|Sylvia Ashby showing the difference between \"Mrs. Right\" and \"Mrs. Wrong\"]]\nAshby returned to Sydney in 1936 and started her own business, the Ashby Research Service. Although she almost immediately secured a contract with an advertising agency to conduct a three-month-long survey of Melbourne's leading evening newspaper ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'',<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> it was nevertheless a difficult start. She later recounted that her initial problems were partly caused by \"business executives [who] appeared to know little and to care even less\" about market research;<ref name=\"routledge\"/> this was compounded by prevailing societal views of women, which were not positive toward women who ran their own business.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Yet Ashby became a tireless promoter of market research in a market that did not yet see the value of such research, let alone paying for it. In a profile for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' she was described as \"perhaps the only woman in Australia who has specialised in market research\".<ref name=\"smh-1937\"/> Ashby herself later declared that she was the only woman in the British Empire conducting an independent market research bureau.<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\"/> She persevered against the challenges, and within five years her clients included the [[Australian Gas Light Company]], Pick-me-up Condiment Co. Ltd,<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> the [[National Bank of Australasia]], Dunlop-Perdriau rubber goods, [[Bushells]], the ''[[Australian Women's Weekly]]'' and a number of advertising agencies.<ref name=\"crawford-p8\"/>\n\nAshby's method was to employ mainly women, who she believed were more conscientious and effective investigators than men. In particular she found female investigators \"much more patient with other women\", and that \"women will talk to another woman more freely\".<ref name=\"smh-1938\"/> She preferred unmarried women, as she believed that \"a single woman is better able to concentrate solely upon the problem on hand [and] has no home worries to distract her [and] has more time to keep herself physically fit\". Ashby essentially believed that unmarried women had \"a singleness of purpose denied to the married woman\".<ref name=\"unmarried-women-views\"/> She found focused interviews directly with housewives the most effective approach to market research. In a later interview with ''[[Australian Women's Weekly]]'', she showed two small wooden, jointed [[mannequins]]\u2014one showing \"Mrs. Right\" and one \"Mrs. Wrong\". Mrs. Right, she explained, \"is erect, relaxed; the left arm (holding her bag and papers) is slightly to the rear; the right arm is forward; the head is slightly tilted\u2014she is the epitome of confidence.\" Mrs. Wrong \"is a bundle of nerves; head downcast, bag clutched to her\u2014the epitome of apologetic timidity.\" Those who displayed a lack of appropriate deportment, she maintained, would cause suspicion and sometimes hostility, and the interviewee would be unresponsive to questioning, leading to poor survey results.<ref name=\"womens-weekly-1961\"/>\n\n==Second World War==\nBy 1939 Britain had declared war on Germany. The [[Second World War]] caused major issues for a marketing research company that undertook direct interviews &mdash; quite a few of Ashby's researchers were reported by citizens suspicious of those asking questions during a time of war, and consequently they were detained by police. At one point Ashby herself was vigorously questioned over several hours by the police, who accused her of \"disloyalty\" and threatened her with arrest if she did not stop surveying popular opinion on the war and the [[Australian Prime Minister|Prime Minister]].<ref name=\"crawford-via-ashby\"/> Furthermore, rationing meant that firms were less concerned with marketing efforts as the availability of goods became more scarce and consumers were more likely to buy what they could find.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> Despite this, she largely ignored the threats of the authorities and continued to conduct surveys on topics such as conscription, the war effort and war psychology.<ref name=\"dictsydney-via-ashbyrecords\"/>\n\nAshby hired John Stuart Lucy, a journalist from New Zealand, to help with her business. She later married him in 1939. Lucy was to later form a rival research firm, but this did not seem to cause any problems in the marriage &mdash; Ashby told ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' that \"we're rivals only in business. My husband completely approves of my career.\"<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> She gave birth to a daughter, Susan, in 1940 and a son, Richard, in 1943.<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> Despite her previously expressed views on the capabilities of married women at work, the ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'' notes that \"busy and ambitious as she was, Sylvia did not neglect her two children. On weekends her time was devoted to them; school holidays were enjoyed together, sometimes at 'the farm', her husband's property at Narrabeen. At home there was always a maid or housekeeper; Susan was sent to Frensham and Richard to Geelong Church of England Grammar School.\"<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\nHer wartime polling gained the attention of Sir [[Keith Murdoch]], who not only ran the ''[[Herald & Weekly Times]]'' but was also briefly Director-General of Information for the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] in 1940. Murdoch commissioned Ashby to run research into the war effort, and Ashby ran the first Australia-wide public opinion survey.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Murdoch later invited her to join him in establishing a public opinion subsidiary. Sir [[Frank Packer]], rival proprietor of [[Australian Consolidated Press]] (ACP), got wind of the offer however, and put in a counter offer to make the Ashby Research Service a subsidiary of ACP. As Ashby had done work for the ''Australian Women's Weekly'' before the war, she chose to accept Packer's offer over Murdoch's.<ref name=\"crawford-p9\"/> Murdoch then approached [[Roy Morgan Research|Roy Morgan]] to conduct opinion polling, and he organised the Australian Gallop Poll. From 1942 to 1944 the Ashby Research Service was renamed to the Daily Telegraph Research Bureau, but was renamed back to the Ashby Research Service after the war ended.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' in her capacity as Director of the Daily Telegraph Research Bureau, Ashby caused a stir in July 1942 by proposing that the nation combine every two electorates and then subdivide them again into two electorates, to which women would elect a woman in one electorate, and men would elect a man in the second electorate. She felt this was necessary because \"some of those who aspire to leadership unfortunately appear to have the habit of drawing upon themselves most unfavourable publicity, which distresses the average woman, who at heart (although her husband never guesses it) is a timid and shy creature, full of complexes, which cause her to withdraw into herself at the slightest sign of any thing in the nature of a public brawl.\" By allowing each citizen to only vote for their own gender, Ashby believed this would encourage a better class of female candidate and women would become more politically engaged.<ref name=\"ashby-vote-proposal\"/>\n\n==Post-war==\nAfter the Second World War ended, the Ashby Research Service saw a resurgence in business: surveys in 1945 included 14 for clients and 30 for ACP; in 1946 the number of surveys rose significantly, to 30 and 42 respectively.<ref name=\"postwar-surveys\"/> But the war had shown Ashby that revenue could be affected by external events; so she decided to conduct ongoing research surveys alongside her commissioned research to build up her existing data and attract new work. To this end, in 1945 she established the Ashby Consumer Panel as a trial in NSW and rolled out Australia-wide in 1947. The panel directly polled households through diaries of their buying habits. Householders would return from shopping and record their purchases and observations directly into an Ashby Consumer Purchase Record. By 1964 the Ashby Research Service boasted in an advertisement that 6165 households (containing 18,192 individuals) were keeping day-to-day records for the Service. To maintain quality, 237 regular employees inspected the logs, which were then sampled for checking by supervisors. The advertisement claimed that it was \"the largest survey-group permanently employed in the South Hemisphere\".<ref name=\"newspaper-news-advert\"/> Households were not paid, but received a subscription to ''The Women's Weekly''.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\nBecause it was important to maintain credibility and relevance, the Ashby Research Service maintained a statistical library, managed by their professional statisticians. Australia's post-war relaxation of immigration policies encouraged workers from Europe to emigrate to Australia, so Ashby's service employed workers who spoke a variety of European languages to ensure the consistency and accuracy of their data.<ref name=\"crawford-p13\"/> She also regularly requested new equipment from Packer, including an electric calculator and a punching machine,<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> in light of this influx and the more general [[Mid-twentieth century baby boom|post-war population boom]]. \n\nBetween September to November 1953 Ashby undertook an overseas business trip to the UK and the US. This caused ructions with the notoriously tight-fisted Packer, who did not necessarily believe in the benefits of such a trip. In a letter to Packer in June 1953, she argued forcefully for the trip, writing:\n\n{{quote|Mr Packer ... it is essential that we keep up with movements in the technique of Market Research, and it is also essential for our prestige that I go overseas. The twelve years in your employ is a long time to \u2018stay put\u2019 ... and when other Research people are constantly coming and going ... After ten years of most profitable operation, through lack of co-operation from Consolidated Press, the Ashby Research Service latterly has been hindered from progressing ... . Periodical overseas visits are essential to a Director of Market Research and this was discussed prior to the signing of my initial contract.<ref name=\"letter-packer-overseas-travel\"/>}}\n\nHer travels impressed on her that her work was first class and ahead of the rest of the world. ''The Argus'' reported that during her 1953 overseas trip \"she tried to find a woman counterpart, 'But without success, I'm afraid. It seems I'm quite unique'.\"<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> On a 1958 business trip she was unimpressed with the work of [[Johnson & Johnson]]'s consumer panels and noted that Alfred Politz Research Inc.\u2014a leading market research company based in [[Manhattan]]\u2014did not conduct audits and \"do not provide anything resembling a standardised service\".<ref name=\"crawford-p17\"/>\n\nAs the success of the Ashby Research Service grew, so too did their competition. Profits decreased between 1965 to 1966, and in 1968 the firm recorded a loss. This caused ACP to demand a full audit; but Ashby put together a strident defence, pointing out that it was the only time in the subsidiary's history that their expenditure exceeded their revenue. She referred to a particularly problematic client and the costs of using a computer. To her frustration, Ashby found that her subsidiary was being underused by ACP, and regularly wrote to Packer to suggest ways of using her services.<ref name=\"crawford-p18-19\"/>\n\n==Australian Research Service buy-back and death==\nIn 1974, both Packer and Ashby were looking to retire. In a magnanimous gesture to Ashby, Packer sold the Ashby Research Service back to her for the same amount that he had paid for it in 1941 &mdash; $2,800.<ref name=\"crawford-p21\"/> Ashby, who was by this time becoming very ill, sold the business to Beacon Research Co. Pty Ltd.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> As her health continued to fail, she became confined to a wheelchair, before finally dying of cancer on 9 September 1978 at [[Palm Beach, New South Wales]] and was cremated.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\n==External links==\n* [https://trove.nla.gov.au/people/1471050?c=people Sylvia Rose Ashby] - [[Trove Australia]]\n* [http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110314880 Ashby Research Service records, ca. 19] - Archives [[State Library of NSW]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"austdictbio\">{{ref|goot-1993|\u03b7}} Goot, 1993</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"eldest-sister\">{{ref|table-talk-1929|\u03be}} ''Table Talk'' 1929, p. 64</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dict-sydney\">{{ref|crawford-dictsyd-2018|\u03b5}} Crawford 2018</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"children\">{{ref|weekly-times-1946|\u03bf}}''Weekly Times'' 1946, p. 26</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"popcaanz\">{{ref|riley-2016|\u03b8}} Riley 2016</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\">{{ref|daily-examiner-1939|\u03ba}} ''Daily Examiner'' 1939, p. 4</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"women-in-sport\">{{ref|daily-telegraph-1934|\u03bb}} ''The Daily Telegraph'' 1934, p. 16</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"crawford-p6\">{{ref|crawford-2019|\u03b6}} Crawford 2019, p. 6</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dictsyd-via-mcnair\">{{ref|crawford-dictsyd-2018|\u03b5}} Crawford 2018; citing {{ref|ashby-1979|\u03b3}} Ashby 1979, pp. 8&ndash;9</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dictsydney-via-ashbyrecords\">{{ref|crawford-dictsyd-2018|\u03b5}} Crawford 2018; citing 'War Effort', 'Conscription, 1941', '2nd Conscription Survey, February 1942', 'War Psychology, September 1942', 'Election Survey, May 1943', 'Wartime and Political Knowledge, December 1942', Box 78, Ashby Research Service records, c1937-c1972 MLMSS 8907, [[Mitchell Library]], [[State Library of New South Wales]]</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"popcaanz-via-corresp\">{{ref|riley-2016|\u03b8}} Riley 2016, p. 34; citing [[Mitchell Library]] Correspondence files, MLMSS 8907.</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"routledge\">{{ref|crawford-routeledge-2016|\u03b4}} Crawford 2016; citing {{ref|ashby-1979|\u03b3}} Ashby 1979, pp. 8&ndash;9</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"billashby\">[[State Library of New South Wales]], MLMSS 8907, Box 70, 'Letter from W.

Other publishers followed suit, with significant expansion across the industry in the 1980s. This supported the publication of a number of newsletters from individual play-by-mail companies as well as independent publications such as ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'', and [[Flagship Magazine|''Flagship'']] which focused solely on the play-by-mail gaming industry.  The sourcing of play-by-mail games in this list largely comes from these magazines, whether from reviews or advertisements, as well as additional magazines such as ''[[Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer]]'', ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon Magazine]]'', and other publications that serviced the gaming community broadly, resuming with the contemporary online magazine ''[[Suspense and Decision]]'', which supports the small but active play-by-mail gaming community today.\n\nIn some cases, more than one publisher can be found for the same game on the list. This is because the rights to play-by-mail games were occasionally sold among publishers.{{efn|For example, in 1993, play-by-mail gaming company [[Schubel & Sons]] sold all games and licenses to Northwest Simulations.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Gameline |url= |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]]|location= |publisher= The Paper Mayhem Association |issue= 59|page= 27|date= March\u2013April 1993|access-date= }}</ref>}} In other cases, games were licensed from the publishing company, which might be then moderated by a different company\u2014potentially even translated and played in a different country.{{efn|For example, in the March/April 1993 issue of ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'' magazine, Prime Time Simulations announced that its play-by-mail game [[World Conquest (play-by-mail game)|''World Conquest'']] was licensed to multiple companies in Europe and was available in English, French, German, Dutch, and Italian.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Gameline |url= |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]]|location= |publisher= The Paper Mayhem Association |issue= 59|page= 25|date= March\u2013April 1993|access-date= }}</ref>}} Many more play-by-mail games existed in nascent, playtest form than there are on this list. Only games which completed playtesting and were released for play are included here as a \"published\" game. This list includes games that are (or were) played only by [[postal mail]], as well as those which had a play-by-email option, as well as games that are played in a turn-based play-by-email (PBEM) format. Additionally, this list includes games which are no longer available for play as well as games that are still active. Game durations range from those which were only briefly available for play, such as ''Quest of Gorr'',<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Scheid|first= J.

Other publishers followed suit, with significant expansion across the industry in the 1980s. This supported the publication of a number of newsletters from individual play-by-mail companies as well as independent publications such as ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'', and [[Flagship Magazine|''Flagship'']] which focused solely on the play-by-mail gaming industry.  The sourcing of play-by-mail games in this list largely comes from these magazines, whether from reviews or advertisements, as well as additional magazines such as ''[[Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer]]'', ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon Magazine]]'', and other publications that serviced the gaming community broadly, resuming with the contemporary online magazine ''[[Suspense and Decision]]'', which supports the small but active play-by-mail gaming community today.\n\nIn some cases, more than one publisher can be found for the same game on the list. This is because the rights to play-by-mail games were occasionally sold among publishers.{{efn|For example, in 1993, play-by-mail gaming company [[Schubel & Sons]] sold all games and licenses to Northwest Simulations.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Gameline |url= |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]]|location= |publisher= The Paper Mayhem Association |issue= 59|page= 27|date= March\u2013April 1993|access-date= }}</ref>}} In other cases, games were licensed from the publishing company, which might be then moderated by a different company\u2014potentially even translated and played in a different country.{{efn|For example, in the March/April 1993 issue of ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'' magazine, Prime Time Simulations announced that its play-by-mail game [[World Conquest (play-by-mail game)|''World Conquest'']] was licensed to multiple companies in Europe and was available in English, French, German, Dutch, and Italian.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Gameline |url= |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]]|location= |publisher= The Paper Mayhem Association |issue= 59|page= 25|date= March\u2013April 1993|access-date= }}</ref>}} Many more play-by-mail games existed in nascent, playtest form than there are on this list. Only games which completed playtesting and were released for play are included here as a \"published\" game. This list includes games that are (or were) played only by [[postal mail]], as well as those which had a play-by-email option, as well as games that are played in a turn-based play-by-email (PBEM) format. Additionally, this list includes games which are no longer available for play as well as games that are still active. Game durations range from those which were only briefly available for play, such as ''Quest of Gorr'',<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Scheid|first= J.

On the contrary, in the chromosphere, where the temperature decreases from the photospheric value of 6000 K to the minimum of 4400 K, the [[optical depth]] is about 1, and the radiation is thermal.\n\n[[File:Latest xrt soft x-ray.gif|thumb|right|320px|The Sun in the soft X-rays as seen by the [[Hinode (satellite)|Hinode]] X-ray Telescope (XRT) on 15 Oct 2009.]]\n\nThe [[solar corona|corona]] extends much further than a solar radius from the [[photosphere]] and looks very complex and inhomogeneous in the [[X-rays]] images taken by satellites (see the figure on the right taken by the XRT on board [[Hinode (satellite)|Hinode]]).\nThe structure and dynamics of the [[solar corona|corona]] are dominated by the [[solar magnetic field]].

The grey area represents the [[blackbody radiation]] with the same radiative flux of the solar spectrum (yellow area).]]\nThe electromagnetic waves coming from the solar [[corona]] are emitted mainly in the [[X-rays]]. This radiation is not visible from the Earth because it is filtered by the atmosphere. Before the first rocket missions, the corona could be observed only in white light during the eclipses, while in the last fifty years the solar corona has been photographed in the EUV and X-rays by many satellites ([[Pioneer program|Pioneer]] 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, [[Helios]], [[Skylab]], [[Solar Maximum Mission|SMM]], [[NIXT]], [[Yohkoh]], [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]], [[TRACE]], [[Hinode (satellite)|Hinode]]).\n\nThe emitting plasma is almost completely ionized and very light, its density is about 10<sup>\u221216</sup> - 10<sup>\u221214</sup> g/cm<sup>3</sup>. Particles are so isolated that almost all the [[photons]] can leave the [[Sun]]'s surface without interacting with the matter above the [[photosphere]]: in other words, the corona is transparent to the radiation and the emission of the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] is optically-thin. The Sun's atmosphere is not the unique example of [[Astronomical X-ray source|X-ray source]], since hot plasmas are present wherever in the Universe: from stellar coronae to thin [[galactic halo]]s. These stellar environments are the subject of the [[X-ray astronomy]].\n\nIn an optically-thin plasma the matter is not in thermodynamical equilibrium with the radiation, because collisions between particles and photons are very rare, and, as a matter of fact, the square root mean velocity of photons, electrons, protons and ions is not the same: we should define a temperature for each of these particle populations. The result is that the [[emission spectrum]] does not fit the spectral distribution of a [[blackbody radiation]], but it depends only on those collisional processes which occur in a very rarefied plasma.\n\n[[File:FraunhoferLinesDiagram.jpg|thumb|right|320px| [[Fraunhofer lines]] in the solar spectrum.]]\nWhile the [[Fraunhofer lines]] coming from the [[photosphere]] are [[absorption lines]], principally emitted from ions which absorb photons of the same frequency of the transition to an upper energy level, coronal lines are [[emission lines]] produced by metal ions which had been excited to a superior state by collisional processes. Many spectral lines are emitted by highly ionized atoms, like calcium and iron, which have lost most of their external electrons; these emission lines can be formed only at certain temperatures, and therefore their individuation in solar [[spectrum|spectra]] is sufficient to determine the temperature of the emitting plasma.\n\nSome of these spectral lines can be forbidden on the Earth: in fact, collisions between particles can excite ions to metastable states; in a dense gas these ions immediately collide with other particles and so they de-excite with an allowed transition to an intermediate level, while in the corona it is more probable that this ion remains in its metastable state, until it encounters a photon of the same frequency of the forbidden transition to the lower state. This photon induces the ion to emit with the same frequency by [[stimulated emission]]. Forbidden transitions from metastable states are often called as satellite lines.\n\nThe [[Spectroscopy]] of the corona allows the determination of many physical parameters of the emitting plasma. Comparing the [[Luminous intensity|intensity]] in lines of different ions of the same element, temperature and density can be measured with a good approximation: the different states of ionization are regulated by the [[Saha equation]].\nThe [[Doppler shift]] gives a good measurement of the velocities along the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] but not in the perpendicular plane.\nThe [[line width]] should depend on the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] of velocities at the temperature of line formation (thermal line broadening), while it is often larger than predicted.\nThe widening can be due to [[pressure broadening]], when collisions between particles are frequent, or it can be due to [[turbulence]]: in this case the line width can be used to estimate the macroscopic velocity also on the Sun's surface, but with a great uncertainty.\nThe magnetic field can be measured thanks to the line splitting due to the [[Zeeman effect]].\n\n== Optically-thin plasma emission ==\nThe most important processes of radiation for an optically-thin plasma\n<ref>{{cite journal\n  |author1=Landini, M. |author2=Monsignori Fossi, B. | title = Computation of solar X-ray emission in the region 1-100 \u00c5 for Te from 1 MK to 100 MK\n  | journal = Mem.

With a good approximation, the number of occupied states at the superior level <math> n_u </math>  and the number of states at the inferior energy level <math> n_l </math> are given by the equilibrium between collisional excitation and [[spontaneous emission]]\n\n:<math>\nn_l n_e C_{lu} =n_u A_{ul}\n</math>\n\nwhere  <math>A_{lu}</math> is the transition probability of spontaneous emission.\n\nThe second term <math>L_{rec}</math> is calculated as the energy emitted per unit volume and time when free electrons are captured from ions to recombine into neutral atoms (dielectronic capture).\n\nThe third term <math>L_{brems}</math> is due to the electron scattering by protons and ions because of the [[Coulomb force]]: every accelerated charge emits radiation according to classical electrodynamics. This effect gives an appreciable contribution to the continuum spectrum only at the highest temperatures, above 10 MK.\n\nTaking into account all the dominant radiation processes, including satellite lines from metastable states, the emission of an optically-thin plasma can be expressed more simply as\n\n:<math>\nL_{r}=n_{e} n_{H} P(T)~~ {W~m^{-3}}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>P(T)</math> depends only on the temperature. All the radiation mechanisms require collision processes and basically depend on the squared density (<math> n_{e}=n_{H}</math>). The integral of the squared density along the line of sight is called emission measure and is often used in [[X-ray astronomy]].\nThe function <math>P(T)</math> has been modeled by many authors but many discrepancies are still in these calculations: differences derive essentially on the spectral lines they include in their models and on the atomic parameters they use.\n\nIn order to calculate the radiative flux from an optically-thin plasma, it can be used the linear fitting applied to some model calculations by Rosner et al.

Comparing the [[Luminous intensity|intensity]] in lines of different ions of the same element, temperature and density can be measured with a good approximation: the different states of ionization are regulated by the [[Saha equation]].\nThe [[Doppler shift]] gives a good measurement of the velocities along the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] but not in the perpendicular plane.\nThe [[line width]] should depend on the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] of velocities at the temperature of line formation (thermal line broadening), while it is often larger than predicted.\nThe widening can be due to [[pressure broadening]], when collisions between particles are frequent, or it can be due to [[turbulence]]: in this case the line width can be used to estimate the macroscopic velocity also on the Sun's surface, but with a great uncertainty.\nThe magnetic field can be measured thanks to the line splitting due to the [[Zeeman effect]].\n\n== Optically-thin plasma emission ==\nThe most important processes of radiation for an optically-thin plasma\n<ref>{{cite journal\n  |author1=Landini, M. |author2=Monsignori Fossi, B. | title = Computation of solar X-ray emission in the region 1-100 \u00c5 for Te from 1 MK to 100 MK\n  | journal = Mem.

With a good approximation, the number of occupied states at the superior level <math> n_u </math>  and the number of states at the inferior energy level <math> n_l </math> are given by the equilibrium between collisional excitation and [[spontaneous emission]]\n\n:<math>\nn_l n_e C_{lu} =n_u A_{ul}\n</math>\n\nwhere  <math>A_{lu}</math> is the transition probability of spontaneous emission.\n\nThe second term <math>L_{rec}</math> is calculated as the energy emitted per unit volume and time when free electrons are captured from ions to recombine into neutral atoms (dielectronic capture).\n\nThe third term <math>L_{brems}</math> is due to the electron scattering by protons and ions because of the [[Coulomb force]]: every accelerated charge emits radiation according to classical electrodynamics. This effect gives an appreciable contribution to the continuum spectrum only at the highest temperatures, above 10 MK.\n\nTaking into account all the dominant radiation processes, including satellite lines from metastable states, the emission of an optically-thin plasma can be expressed more simply as\n\n:<math>\nL_{r}=n_{e} n_{H} P(T)~~ {W~m^{-3}}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>P(T)</math> depends only on the temperature. All the radiation mechanisms require collision processes and basically depend on the squared density (<math> n_{e}=n_{H}</math>). The integral of the squared density along the line of sight is called emission measure and is often used in [[X-ray astronomy]].\nThe function <math>P(T)</math> has been modeled by many authors but many discrepancies are still in these calculations: differences derive essentially on the spectral lines they include in their models and on the atomic parameters they use.\n\nIn order to calculate the radiative flux from an optically-thin plasma, it can be used the linear fitting applied to some model calculations by Rosner et al.
