The venue has also played host to several \nlarge-scale ballet and dance performances. The [[National Ballet of Canada]] held seasonal performances at the venue from 1964 to 2006.

Notable performances that reflect this mandate include the Last Empress with its dramatic, musical portrayal of an important figure in Korean history, the Virsky Ukrainian Dance Company, South Africa's Soweto Gospel Choir, Shaolin Warriors, Ricky Cheng, David Rudder & Friends and Club Tropicana.\n\nIn 2006, the performing arts venue received approval from the City of Toronto for the development of a high-rise condominium building beside the Centre.

It is four storeys high and is broken up into three main forms: the entrance block, auditorium and fly tower. The central form of the building is highly symmetrical with an open floor plan. Structurally, the performing arts venue is not overcomplicated and uses steel trusses and concrete to hold the majority of the building together. In addition to the structure, the performing arts venue's auditorium houses a very sophisticated acoustic system, which gives the audience the sense that the sound is surrounding them (Canadian Architect 18).\n\nWhen it comes to materiality, the majority of the original materials are still in the building today. Materials used include: Alabama limestone, glazing, granite, copper, bronze, Carrara marble, carpet, cherry plywood panels and Brazilian Rosewood. The performing arts venue is very diverse with its range of materials and employs them in such a way that they are not overshadowed by the unique forms of the building. \n\nThe interior also features a grand double-height foyer with coffered ceilings, a {{convert|30|m|ft}} wide mural by the famous Toronto-born artist [[York Wilson]], cantilevering staircases that appear to be floating, bright bronze auditorium doors, and a fan-shaped auditorium with a huge curving balcony.\n\n==See also==\n\nOther performing arts venues in the city include:\n* [[Budweiser Stage]]\n* [[Four Seasons Centre]]\n* [[Massey Hall]]\n* [[Toronto Centre for the Arts|Meridian Centre for the Arts]]\n* [[Roy Thomson Hall]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |authorlink=Richard Rohmer |last=Rohmer |first=Richard |title=E.

The Sony Centre closed on 26 June 2008 to begin the theatre renovations, which were unveiled on October 1, 2010.\n\nIn June 2012, the Sony Centre hosted the Canadian premiere of the [[Philip Glass]]/[[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] opera ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]''.\n\nOn 21 January, it was announced that the [[municipal government of Toronto]] entered into a C$30.75 million 15-year partnership with [[Meridian Credit Union]], re-branding the Sony Centre into Meridian Hall, and the [[Toronto Centre for the Arts]] into the Meridian Arts Centre.

It is four storeys high and is broken up into three main forms: the entrance block, auditorium and fly tower. The central form of the building is highly symmetrical with an open floor plan. Structurally, the performing arts venue is not overcomplicated and uses steel trusses and concrete to hold the majority of the building together. In addition to the structure, the performing arts venue's auditorium houses a very sophisticated acoustic system, which gives the audience the sense that the sound is surrounding them (Canadian Architect 18).\n\nWhen it comes to materiality, the majority of the original materials are still in the building today. Materials used include: Alabama limestone, glazing, granite, copper, bronze, Carrara marble, carpet, cherry plywood panels and Brazilian Rosewood. The performing arts venue is very diverse with its range of materials and employs them in such a way that they are not overshadowed by the unique forms of the building. \n\nThe interior also features a grand double-height foyer with coffered ceilings, a {{convert|30|m|ft}} wide mural by the famous Toronto-born artist [[York Wilson]], cantilevering staircases that appear to be floating, bright bronze auditorium doors, and a fan-shaped auditorium with a huge curving balcony.\n\n==See also==\n\nOther performing arts venues in the city include:\n* [[Budweiser Stage]]\n* [[Four Seasons Centre]]\n* [[Massey Hall]]\n* [[Toronto Centre for the Arts|Meridian Centre for the Arts]]\n* [[Roy Thomson Hall]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |authorlink=Richard Rohmer |last=Rohmer |first=Richard |title=E.

The raid resulted in the deaths of two [[United States Army Rangers|US Army Rangers]] from C and D Companies of the [[3rd Ranger Battalion (United States)|3rd Battalion]], [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|75th Ranger Regiment]], and the death of [[Abdul Haseeb Logari]], the leader of ISIL-KP, alongside several leaders, and up to 35 other militants according to [[The Pentagon]].\n\n== Background ==\n{{main article|2017 Nangarhar airstrike}} \nOn January 11, 2015 [[Hafiz Saeed Khan]] a former member of [[Tehrik-i-Taliban]] and the [[Afghan Taliban]] alongside other former [[Taliban]] leaders pledged allegiance to [[Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi]], forming the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Khorasan Province]] and becoming the group's [[emir]]. Seven months later the [[Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan]] pledged allegiance to ISIL and claimed membership in the Khorasan group. Immediately after its formation the [[United States]] and [[Afghanistan]] targeted the group in airstrikes and raids. The group also suffered major setbacks while fighting the [[Taliban]]. \n\nIn July 2016, Hafiz was killed in a US drone strike, around eight months later the Afghan and US military began its offensive against the militant group in [[Nangarhar Province]] in March 2017.<ref>https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-07-28/islamic-state-in-afghanistan-us-military</ref>\n\nLess than two weeks before the raid on April 13, 2017 and less than a mile away from the location of the raid, the US military [[2017 Nangarhar airstrike|dropped]] the largest non-nuclear bomb, a [[GBU-43/B MOAB]] on an ISIL-KP tunnel network once used by the [[Mujahideen]] during the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] in the 80s and [[Osama Bin Laden]] during the [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|invasion of Afghanistan]] in 2001. The strike killed 96 militants according to an Afghan official.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/isis-fighters-killed-in-mother-of-all-bombs-moab-blast-2017-4|title=The 'Mother of All Bombs' blast site is still off-limits, but here's who it may have killed|first=Christopher|last=Woody|website=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=11 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of the raid the group had been reduced to an estimated 700 fighters, down from 3,000 fighters at the group's peak, according to US officials.<ref>https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2017/05/isis-afghanistan-abdul-hasib/525807/</ref>\n\n== Target ==\nThe target of the operation was a compound in the [[Mohmand Valley]] located less than a mile away from where the US dropped the [[GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast|MOAB]] bomb. The compound was believed to have housed [[Abdul Haseeb Logari|Abdul Hasib]], a former [[Taliban]] commander before switching alliances to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant - Khorasan Province|Islamic State - Khorasan Province]], he would eventually become the group's leader after his predecessor [[Hafiz Saeed Khan]] was killed in a US airstrike. Abdul had overseen several attacks against the Afghan Government including the [[March 2017 Kabul attack]] on a military hospital that killed nearly 100 people. Commanders decided to conduct a joint US/Afghan special forces raid over an airstrike because woman and children were believed to have been in the compound.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/07/world/asia/abdul-hasib-isis-leader-killed.html</ref><ref>https://heavy.com/news/2017/05/sheikh-abdul-hasib-dead-death-killed-isis-afghanistan-leader-raid-cameron-thomas-joshua-rodgers/</ref>\n\n== Raid ==\nAt around 10:30 on the night of 26 April, 50 U.S. Army Rangers from [[3rd Ranger Battalion (United States)|3rd Battalion]], [[75th Ranger Regiment]], alongside 40 Afghan commandos from the [[Special Security Forces]] (Kteh Khas), were inserted near the target site by helicopter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/10114/this-shadowy-afghan-unit-fights-alongside-americas-most-elite-forces|title=This Shadowy Afghan Unit Fights Alongside America's Most Elite Forces|first=Joseph|last=Trevithick|website=The Drive|accessdate=11 January 2019}}</ref> Almost immediately after landing the force came under heavy fire from multiple directions by entrenched enemy positions with the firefight being described as \"close quarters with enemy fire coming at 360 degrees\".

The group also suffered major setbacks while fighting the [[Taliban]]. \n\nIn July 2016, Hafiz was killed in a US drone strike, around eight months later the Afghan and US military began its offensive against the militant group in [[Nangarhar Province]] in March 2017.<ref>https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-07-28/islamic-state-in-afghanistan-us-military</ref>\n\nLess than two weeks before the raid on April 13, 2017 and less than a mile away from the location of the raid, the US military [[2017 Nangarhar airstrike|dropped]] the largest non-nuclear bomb, a [[GBU-43/B MOAB]] on an ISIL-KP tunnel network once used by the [[Mujahideen]] during the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] in the 80s and [[Osama Bin Laden]] during the [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|invasion of Afghanistan]] in 2001.

The compound was believed to have housed [[Abdul Haseeb Logari|Abdul Hasib]], a former [[Taliban]] commander before switching alliances to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant - Khorasan Province|Islamic State - Khorasan Province]], he would eventually become the group's leader after his predecessor [[Hafiz Saeed Khan]] was killed in a US airstrike. Abdul had overseen several attacks against the Afghan Government including the [[March 2017 Kabul attack]] on a military hospital that killed nearly 100 people. Commanders decided to conduct a joint US/Afghan special forces raid over an airstrike because woman and children were believed to have been in the compound.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/07/world/asia/abdul-hasib-isis-leader-killed.html</ref><ref>https://heavy.com/news/2017/05/sheikh-abdul-hasib-dead-death-killed-isis-afghanistan-leader-raid-cameron-thomas-joshua-rodgers/</ref>\n\n== Raid ==\nAt around 10:30 on the night of 26 April, 50 U.S. Army Rangers from [[3rd Ranger Battalion (United States)|3rd Battalion]], [[75th Ranger Regiment]], alongside 40 Afghan commandos from the [[Special Security Forces]] (Kteh Khas), were inserted near the target site by helicopter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/10114/this-shadowy-afghan-unit-fights-alongside-americas-most-elite-forces|title=This Shadowy Afghan Unit Fights Alongside America's Most Elite Forces|first=Joseph|last=Trevithick|website=The Drive|accessdate=11 January 2019}}</ref> Almost immediately after landing the force came under heavy fire from multiple directions by entrenched enemy positions with the firefight being described as \"close quarters with enemy fire coming at 360 degrees\".

Loosely based on the 2009 animated short ''Pigeon: Impossible'' by Lucas Martell, the film is directed by Troy Quane and Nick Bruno (in their feature directorial debuts) from a screenplay by [[Brad Copeland]] and Lloyd Taylor, and a story by Cindy Davis. It stars the voices of [[Will Smith]] and [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]], alongside [[Rashida Jones]], [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[Rachel Brosnahan]], [[Karen Gillan]], [[DJ Khaled]], and [[Masi Oka]] in supporting roles. The plot follows a secret agent (Smith) who is accidentally transformed into a pigeon by an intelligent young scientist (Holland); the two must then work together to stop a revenge-seeking cybernetic terrorist, and return the agent to his human form.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on December 4, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 25, 2019. It has grossed $171 million worldwide and it received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the animation, music, humor, and vocal performances (particularly Smith and Holland).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT before editing. Per key guideline, the plot summary should be within the desired length of 400-700 words. -->\nLance Sterling, a cocky secret agent of H.T.U.V. (Honor, Trust, Unity and Valor), is sent to recover an attack [[Drone strike|drone]] from Japanese arms dealer Katsu Kimura in Japan. As soon as the buyer, cybernetically enhanced terrorist Killian, arrives, Sterling breaks in against the orders of H.T.U.V. director Joy Jenkins, defeats Kimura and his gang, and manages to escape with the briefcase containing the drone. Sterling returns to H.T.U.V. headquarters to confront Walter Beckett, a socially inept [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] graduate and outcast young scientist, for equipping nonlethal weapons into his suit. Walter tries to convince Sterling that there is a more peaceful way to save the world, but Sterling fires him before he can explain his latest invention: \"biodynamic concealment\".\n\nSterling discovers the briefcase to be empty and is confronted by Marcy Kappel, a security forces agent, who reveals footage of Sterling (actually Killian in a holographic disguise) leaving with the drone, labeling him as a traitor. Sterling escapes the H.T.U.V. and decides to track down Walter to help him disappear. Meanwhile, Killian breaks into the H.T.U.V. weapons facility.\n\nWhile searching Walter's home for his invention, Sterling unknowingly ingests the concoction and transforms into a pigeon. Before Walter can start making an antidote to change him back, Marcy and other H.T.U.V. agents chase the duo through the city, but they escape in Sterling's spy car. The two track down Kimura to a resort in [[Playa del Carmen]], Mexico. There, they learn of Killian's whereabouts in [[Venice, Italy]] before Marcy and the H.T.U.V. can capture them again. On their way to Venice, Walter attempts to make the antidote, but fails.\n\nArriving in Venice, Walter is confronted by the H.T.U.V., who are unaware of Sterling's condition. Revealing that she knows about Wendy, Walter's mother who was a police officer who died on duty, Marcy tries to convince him to help turn Sterling in, but Walter refuses. Suddenly, a drone distracts the H.T.U.V. and allows Walter and Sterling to escape. The two discover the drone carrying the H.T.U.V. agent database, and Walter manages to retrieve it. However, Killian shows up, takes the database, and prepares to kill Walter. With help from hundreds of pigeons in the surrounding area, they distract Killian and flee. Disguised as Sterling once more, Killian escapes the H.T.U.V., shaking Marcy's suspicions of Sterling upon her seeing him with a robot hand.\n\nWhilst underwater in a submarine, Walter reveals he planted a tracking device on Killian and locates him at the weapons facility. Walter manages to perfect the antidote and successfully turns Sterling human again. Reaching Killian's hideout, Sterling is concerned about Walter's safety and sends him away in the submarine. Once inside, Sterling confronts Killian, but is defeated and captured as Killian reveals he has mass produced hundreds of drones to target everyone at the agency using the database as revenge for killing his crew in a past mission led by Sterling. Noticing Walter returning in the submarine, Killian destroys it; unbeknownst to them, Walter survives with the help of one of his inventions, the inflatable hug.\n\nOnce Walter frees Sterling, the two escape and contact Marcy for support as the drones approach H.T.U.V. headquarters in Washington D.C. Walter attempts to hack into Killian's bionic arm but when Killian realizes this, he tries to flee via air with a drone, but Walter catches up.  Walter risks his life by trapping Killian in the inflatable hug and deactivates the villain's arm as Walter himself falls, but Sterling, who has turned himself back into a pigeon, successfully flies for the first time and carries him to safety with help from other pigeons, while Killian is found and arrested.\n\nDespite saving the world, Sterling, back in his human form, and Walter are fired for disobedience. However, they are quickly rehired by the H.T.U.V. as the agency could learn from Walter's more peaceful ways of handling villainy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Smith]] as Lance Sterling, \"the world's most awesome spy,\" who is accidentally turned into a pigeon.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Evangelista|first=Chris|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/will-smith-and-tom-holland-are-spies-in-disguise/|title=Spies in Disguise Teams Will Smith and Tom Holland|date=October 10, 2017|work=Slashfilm|access-date=October 11, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as Walter Beckett, a socially inept scientific genius who graduated from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] at age 15 and designs gadgets.

Loosely based on the 2009 animated short ''Pigeon: Impossible'' by Lucas Martell, the film is directed by Troy Quane and Nick Bruno (in their feature directorial debuts) from a screenplay by [[Brad Copeland]] and Lloyd Taylor, and a story by Cindy Davis. It stars the voices of [[Will Smith]] and [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]], alongside [[Rashida Jones]], [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[Rachel Brosnahan]], [[Karen Gillan]], [[DJ Khaled]], and [[Masi Oka]] in supporting roles. The plot follows a secret agent (Smith) who is accidentally transformed into a pigeon by an intelligent young scientist (Holland); the two must then work together to stop a revenge-seeking cybernetic terrorist, and return the agent to his human form.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on December 4, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 25, 2019. It has grossed $171 million worldwide and it received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the animation, music, humor, and vocal performances (particularly Smith and Holland).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT before editing. Per key guideline, the plot summary should be within the desired length of 400-700 words. -->\nLance Sterling, a cocky secret agent of H.T.U.V. (Honor, Trust, Unity and Valor), is sent to recover an attack [[Drone strike|drone]] from Japanese arms dealer Katsu Kimura in Japan. As soon as the buyer, cybernetically enhanced terrorist Killian, arrives, Sterling breaks in against the orders of H.T.U.V. director Joy Jenkins, defeats Kimura and his gang, and manages to escape with the briefcase containing the drone. Sterling returns to H.T.U.V. headquarters to confront Walter Beckett, a socially inept [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] graduate and outcast young scientist, for equipping nonlethal weapons into his suit. Walter tries to convince Sterling that there is a more peaceful way to save the world, but Sterling fires him before he can explain his latest invention: \"biodynamic concealment\".\n\nSterling discovers the briefcase to be empty and is confronted by Marcy Kappel, a security forces agent, who reveals footage of Sterling (actually Killian in a holographic disguise) leaving with the drone, labeling him as a traitor. Sterling escapes the H.T.U.V. and decides to track down Walter to help him disappear. Meanwhile, Killian breaks into the H.T.U.V. weapons facility.\n\nWhile searching Walter's home for his invention, Sterling unknowingly ingests the concoction and transforms into a pigeon. Before Walter can start making an antidote to change him back, Marcy and other H.T.U.V. agents chase the duo through the city, but they escape in Sterling's spy car. The two track down Kimura to a resort in [[Playa del Carmen]], Mexico. There, they learn of Killian's whereabouts in [[Venice, Italy]] before Marcy and the H.T.U.V. can capture them again. On their way to Venice, Walter attempts to make the antidote, but fails.\n\nArriving in Venice, Walter is confronted by the H.T.U.V., who are unaware of Sterling's condition. Revealing that she knows about Wendy, Walter's mother who was a police officer who died on duty, Marcy tries to convince him to help turn Sterling in, but Walter refuses. Suddenly, a drone distracts the H.T.U.V. and allows Walter and Sterling to escape. The two discover the drone carrying the H.T.U.V. agent database, and Walter manages to retrieve it. However, Killian shows up, takes the database, and prepares to kill Walter. With help from hundreds of pigeons in the surrounding area, they distract Killian and flee. Disguised as Sterling once more, Killian escapes the H.T.U.V., shaking Marcy's suspicions of Sterling upon her seeing him with a robot hand.\n\nWhilst underwater in a submarine, Walter reveals he planted a tracking device on Killian and locates him at the weapons facility. Walter manages to perfect the antidote and successfully turns Sterling human again. Reaching Killian's hideout, Sterling is concerned about Walter's safety and sends him away in the submarine. Once inside, Sterling confronts Killian, but is defeated and captured as Killian reveals he has mass produced hundreds of drones to target everyone at the agency using the database as revenge for killing his crew in a past mission led by Sterling. Noticing Walter returning in the submarine, Killian destroys it; unbeknownst to them, Walter survives with the help of one of his inventions, the inflatable hug.\n\nOnce Walter frees Sterling, the two escape and contact Marcy for support as the drones approach H.T.U.V. headquarters in Washington D.C. Walter attempts to hack into Killian's bionic arm but when Killian realizes this, he tries to flee via air with a drone, but Walter catches up.  Walter risks his life by trapping Killian in the inflatable hug and deactivates the villain's arm as Walter himself falls, but Sterling, who has turned himself back into a pigeon, successfully flies for the first time and carries him to safety with help from other pigeons, while Killian is found and arrested.\n\nDespite saving the world, Sterling, back in his human form, and Walter are fired for disobedience. However, they are quickly rehired by the H.T.U.V. as the agency could learn from Walter's more peaceful ways of handling villainy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Smith]] as Lance Sterling, \"the world's most awesome spy,\" who is accidentally turned into a pigeon.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Evangelista|first=Chris|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/will-smith-and-tom-holland-are-spies-in-disguise/|title=Spies in Disguise Teams Will Smith and Tom Holland|date=October 10, 2017|work=Slashfilm|access-date=October 11, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as Walter Beckett, a socially inept scientific genius who graduated from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] at age 15 and designs gadgets.

These are primarily Japanized forms of European dishes, often featuring Western names, and usually written in [[katakana]].  It is an example of [[fusion cuisine]].\n\n== History ==\nAt the beginning of the [[Meiji Restoration]] (1868 to 1912), [[Sakoku|national seclusion]] was eliminated and the [[Meiji Emperor]] declared Western ideas helpful for Japan's future progress. As part of the reforms, the Emperor lifted the ban on red meat and promoted Western cuisine, which was viewed as the cause of the Westerners' greater physical size. ''Y\u014dshoku'' thus relies on meat as an ingredient, unlike the typical Japanese cuisine at the time. In the past, the term \"y\u014dshoku\" was for Western cuisine, regardless of the country of origin (as opposed to [[French cuisine|French]], [[English_cuisine|English]], [[Italian_cuisine|Italian]], etc.), but people became aware of differences between European cuisines and ''y\u014dshoku'' due to the opening of many European restaurants serving more authentically European (non-Japanized) food in the 1980s.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|author = Norimitsu Onishi|title = Spaghetti Stir-Fry and Hambagoo: Japan Looks West|publisher = [[New York Times]]|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/26/dining/26japan.html?scp=4&sq=japan%20western%20cooking&st=cse|date=2008-03-26|accessdate = 2008-09-11}}</ref> \n\nEarlier dishes of European origin \u2013 notably those [[List of Japanese dishes#Foods imported from Portugal in the 16th century|imported from Portugal in the 16th century]] such as [[tempura]], are not, strictly speaking, part of ''yoshoku'', which refers only to Meiji-era food. However, some ''y\u014dshoku'' restaurants serve tempura.  \n\n''Y\u014dshoku'' varies in how Japanized it is: while y\u014dshoku may be eaten with a spoon (as in \u30ab\u30ec\u30fc, kar\u0113, curry), paired with bread or a ''plate'' of rice (called \u30e9\u30a4\u30b9, raisu) and written in [[katakana]] to reflect that they are foreign words, some have become sufficiently Japanized that they are often treated as normal Japanese food (''washoku''): served alongside rice and [[miso soup]], and eaten with [[chopsticks]]. An example of the latter is [[tonkatsu|katsu]], which is eaten with chopsticks and a ''bowl'' of rice (\u3054\u98ef, gohan), and may even be served with traditional Japanese sauces such as [[ponzu]] or grated [[daikon]], rather than katsu sauce. Reflecting this, katsu is often written in [[hiragana]] as \u304b\u3064, as a native Japanese word, rather than as \u30ab\u30c4 (from \u30ab\u30c4\u30ec\u30c4, katsuretsu, \"cutlet\").\n\n== Overview ==\n[[Jihei Ishii]], author of the 1898 ''[[The Japanese Complete Cookbook]]'' (\u65e5\u672c\u6599\u7406\u6cd5\u5927\u5168), states that: \"Y\u014dshoku is Japanese food.\"{{cn|date=December 2012}}\n\nCreated in the [[Meiji era]], it may not have as long a history as ''[[Washoku]]'' (Japanese traditional dishes), yet there are ''y\u014dshoku'' dishes which have themselves become traditional Japanese fare.{{cn|date=December 2012}}  Y\u014dshoku is considered a field of Japanese cuisine, including such typical adapted meals as ''[[tonkatsu|katsu]]'', beefsteak, ''korokke'', ''[[naporitan]]'', [[Hayashi rice]] and curry rice (Japanese curry). Many of these meals are even assumed to be washoku.{{cn|date=December 2012}}\n\nY\u014dshoku began by altering Western recipes for lack of information about foreign countries\u2019 cuisine, or adaptions to suit local tastes, but over time, ''y\u014dshoku'' also evolved dishes that were not at all based on European foods, such as chicken rice and ''[[omurice]]'' (omelette rice). Elaborate sauces were largely eliminated, replaced with tomato ketchup, [[demi-glace|demi-glace sauce]] and [[Worcester sauce]].{{cn|date=December 2012}}\n\nDuring Japan's modernization, y\u014dshoku was often too expensive for the common man. But after World War II, ingredients for ''y\u014dshoku'' became more widely available and its popularity grew.{{cn|date=December 2012}}\n\nA {{Nihongo|''y\u014dshokuya''|\u6d0b\u98df\u5c4b}} is a restaurant where ''y\u014dshoku'' dishes are served.

In the past, the term \"y\u014dshoku\" was for Western cuisine, regardless of the country of origin (as opposed to [[French cuisine|French]], [[English_cuisine|English]], [[Italian_cuisine|Italian]], etc.), but people became aware of differences between European cuisines and ''y\u014dshoku'' due to the opening of many European restaurants serving more authentically European (non-Japanized) food in the 1980s.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|author = Norimitsu Onishi|title = Spaghetti Stir-Fry and Hambagoo: Japan Looks West|publisher = [[New York Times]]|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/26/dining/26japan.html?scp=4&sq=japan%20western%20cooking&st=cse|date=2008-03-26|accessdate = 2008-09-11}}</ref> \n\nEarlier dishes of European origin \u2013 notably those [[List of Japanese dishes#Foods imported from Portugal in the 16th century|imported from Portugal in the 16th century]] such as [[tempura]], are not, strictly speaking, part of ''yoshoku'', which refers only to Meiji-era food. However, some ''y\u014dshoku'' restaurants serve tempura.  \n\n''Y\u014dshoku'' varies in how Japanized it is: while y\u014dshoku may be eaten with a spoon (as in \u30ab\u30ec\u30fc, kar\u0113, curry), paired with bread or a ''plate'' of rice (called \u30e9\u30a4\u30b9, raisu) and written in [[katakana]] to reflect that they are foreign words, some have become sufficiently Japanized that they are often treated as normal Japanese food (''washoku''): served alongside rice and [[miso soup]], and eaten with [[chopsticks]]. An example of the latter is [[tonkatsu|katsu]], which is eaten with chopsticks and a ''bowl'' of rice (\u3054\u98ef, gohan), and may even be served with traditional Japanese sauces such as [[ponzu]] or grated [[daikon]], rather than katsu sauce. Reflecting this, katsu is often written in [[hiragana]] as \u304b\u3064, as a native Japanese word, rather than as \u30ab\u30c4 (from \u30ab\u30c4\u30ec\u30c4, katsuretsu, \"cutlet\").\n\n== Overview ==\n[[Jihei Ishii]], author of the 1898 ''[[The Japanese Complete Cookbook]]'' (\u65e5\u672c\u6599\u7406\u6cd5\u5927\u5168), states that: \"Y\u014dshoku is Japanese food.\"{{cn|date=December 2012}}\n\nCreated in the [[Meiji era]], it may not have as long a history as ''[[Washoku]]'' (Japanese traditional dishes), yet there are ''y\u014dshoku'' dishes which have themselves become traditional Japanese fare.{{cn|date=December 2012}}  Y\u014dshoku is considered a field of Japanese cuisine, including such typical adapted meals as ''[[tonkatsu|katsu]]'', beefsteak, ''korokke'', ''[[naporitan]]'', [[Hayashi rice]] and curry rice (Japanese curry). Many of these meals are even assumed to be washoku.{{cn|date=December 2012}}\n\nY\u014dshoku began by altering Western recipes for lack of information about foreign countries\u2019 cuisine, or adaptions to suit local tastes, but over time, ''y\u014dshoku'' also evolved dishes that were not at all based on European foods, such as chicken rice and ''[[omurice]]'' (omelette rice). Elaborate sauces were largely eliminated, replaced with tomato ketchup, [[demi-glace|demi-glace sauce]] and [[Worcester sauce]].{{cn|date=December 2012}}\n\nDuring Japan's modernization, y\u014dshoku was often too expensive for the common man. But after World War II, ingredients for ''y\u014dshoku'' became more widely available and its popularity grew.{{cn|date=December 2012}}\n\nA {{Nihongo|''y\u014dshokuya''|\u6d0b\u98df\u5c4b}} is a restaurant where ''y\u014dshoku'' dishes are served.

It is the lead track on their third studio album, ''[[Urban Hymns]]'' (1997). It is based on a sample it uses from the [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] orchestral cover of [[the Rolling Stones]]' song \"[[The Last Time (The Rolling Stones song)|The Last Time]]\", and involved some legal controversy surrounding a [[plagiarism]] charge. As a result, [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]] were added to the songwriting credits, and all royalties from the song went to former Rolling Stones manager [[Allen Klein]]. In April 2019, Jagger and Richards signed over all their publishing for the song to The Verve.<ref name=\"Dispute over\"/> The song was released in June 1997 by [[Hut Recordings]] as the first [[Single (music)|single]] from the album, reaching number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and remaining in the chart for three months.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/330634.stm \"The Verve's bitter sweet career\"].

Stern]]) is a homage to the [[One shot (music video)|single continuous shot]] [[docufiction|docu-fiction]] music video for [[Massive Attack]]'s \"[[Unfinished Sympathy]]\". It focuses on Ashcroft singing while walking down a busy London [[sidewalk|pavement]], without changing his stride or direction throughout, except for one instance where he is forced to stop for a moving car and a reflection is seen of him standing stationary in the car's tinted window.<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/> He narrowly avoids being hit by a car as he starts his walk, repeatedly bumping into passers-by (causing one young woman to lose balance and fall), and he also jumps on top of the [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] of another vehicle stopped in his path (the driver gets out of her car and proceeds to confront him, while he continues unflinchingly). At the end of the video, the rest of the Verve join Ashcroft, and the final shot sees them walking down the street into the distance.

Its worst form is the ''resha'', such an act committed with a wicked intention.\nThese three terms are mentioned by the Psalmist (cvi. 6): \"We have sinned [''\u1e25a\u1e6da'nu''], . . . we have committed iniquity [''he-'ewinu''], we have done wickedly [''hirsha'nu]''\" (comp.

Women could offer the sacrifice and hold a [[Passover Seder]] themselves if they wished, even if married.\n* [[Sin offering]]s or [[guilt offering]]s in atonement for transgressions and unintentional errors.\n* Offerings relevant to fulfillment of, or transgression of, the [[Nazirite]] vow.\n* Offerings following cure from certain diseases and unusual bodily discharges.\n\nWomen could also voluntarily participate in a number of other offerings and rituals for which they were not obligated, including:{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n* [[First Fruits]] on the holiday of [[Shavuot]].\n* [[Temple tax]] - The half-[[shekel]] tax for Temple needs.\n* Voluntary offerings, [[peace offering]]s and a variety of other voluntary and donative offerings.\n* ''[[Semicha in sacrifices|Semicha]]'' (laying on hands) of sacrificial animals for sacrifices they were not required to perform (Berachot 19a).\n* Women could slaughter their sacrificial animals themselves if they wished.\n\n===In the Nevi'im===\nMany books of the [[Nevi'im]] section of the [[Hebrew Bible]] such as the [[Book of Isaiah]] and [[Book of Jeremiah]] spoke out against those Israelites who brought forth sacrifices but did not act in accord with the precepts of the Law. The Prophets disparaged sacrifices that were offered without a regeneration of the heart, i.e., a determined turning from sin and returning to God by striving after righteousness ([[Book of Hosea]] 14:1-2, Joel 2:13, Micah 6:6-8). At the same time, prophets stressed the importance of offerings combined with justice and good even as they taught that offerings were unacceptable unless combined with heartfelt repentance and good deeds. [[Malachi]], the last prophet in the Hebrew Bible, emphasized that the goal of repentance is not to end sacrifices, but to make the offerings fit for acceptance once again ([[Book of Malachi]], 3:3-4). Similarly, the [[Book of Isaiah]] despite disparagement of sacrifices without justice, portrays sacrifice as having a role complementary with prayer in a universalistic [[eschatology]] (Isaiah 56:1; 6-7).\n\n==Rabbinical interpretation==\n\n===100 among the 613 commandments===\nAccording to [[Maimonides]], about one hundred of the permanent [[613 commandments]] based on the Torah, by rabbinical enumeration, directly concern sacrifices, excluding those commandments that concern the actual Temple and the priests themselves of which there are about another fifty.<ref>\n# Not to burn anything on the Golden Altar besides incense (Exodus 30:9)\n# To offer only unblemished animals (Leviticus 22:21)\n# Not to dedicate a blemished animal for the altar (Leviticus 22:20)\n# Not to slaughter it (Leviticus 22:22)\n# Not to sprinkle its blood (Leviticus 22:24)\n# Not to burn its ''[[Chelev|khelev]]'' (Leviticus 22:22)\n# Not to offer a temporarily blemished animal (Deuteronomy 17:1)\n# Not to sacrifice blemished animals even if offered by non-Jews (Leviticus 22:25)\n# Not to inflict wounds upon dedicated animals (Leviticus 22:21)\n# To redeem dedicated animals which have become disqualified (Deuteronomy 12:15)\n# To offer only animals which are at least eight days old (Leviticus 22:27)\n# Not to offer animals bought with the wages of a harlot or the animal exchanged for a dog (Deuteronomy 23:19)\n# Not to burn honey or yeast on the altar (Leviticus 2:11)\n# To salt all sacrifices (Leviticus 2:13)\n# Not to omit the salt from sacrifices (Leviticus 2:13)\n# Carry out the procedure of the burnt offering as prescribed in the Torah (Leviticus 1:3)\n# Not to eat its meat (Deuteronomy 12:17)\n# Carry out the procedure of the sin offering (Leviticus 6:18)\n# Not to eat the meat of the inner sin offering (Leviticus 6:23)\n# Not to decapitate a fowl brought as a sin offering (Leviticus 5:8)\n# Carry out the procedure of the guilt offering (Leviticus 7:1)\n# The ''kohanim'' must eat the sacrificial meat in the Temple (Exodus 29:33)\n# The ''kohanim'' must not eat the meat outside the Temple courtyard (Deuteronomy 12:17)\n# A non-''kohen'' must not eat sacrificial meat (Exodus 29:33)\n# To follow the procedure of the peace offering (Leviticus 7:11)\n# Not to eat the meat of minor sacrifices before sprinkling the blood (Deuteronomy 12:17)\n# To bring meal offerings as prescribed in the Torah (Leviticus 2:1)\n# Not to put oil on the meal offerings of wrongdoers (Leviticus 5:11)\n# Not to put frankincense on the meal offerings of wrongdoers (Leviticus 3:11)\n# Not to eat the meal offering of the High Priest (Leviticus 6:16)\n# Not to bake a meal offering as leavened bread (Leviticus 6:10)\n# The ''kohanim'' must eat the remains of the meal offerings (Leviticus 6:9)\n# To bring all avowed and freewill offerings to the Temple on the first subsequent festival (Deuteronomy 12:5-6)\n# To offer all sacrifices in the Temple (Deuteronomy 12:11)\n# To bring all sacrifices from outside Israel to the Temple (Deuteronomy 12:26)\n# Not to slaughter sacrifices outside the courtyard (of the Temple) (Leviticus 17:4)\n# Not to offer any sacrifices outside the courtyard (of the Temple) (Deuteronomy 12:13)\n# To offer two lambs every day (Numbers 28:3)\n# To light a fire on the altar every day (Leviticus 6:6)\n# Not to extinguish this fire (Leviticus 6:6)\n# To remove the ashes from the altar every day (Leviticus 6:3)\n# To burn incense every day (Exodus 30:7)\n# The ''Kohen Gadol'' must bring a meal offering every day (Leviticus 6:13)\n# To bring two additional lambs as burnt offerings on Shabbat (Numbers 28:9)\n# To bring additional offerings on the New Month (''[[Rosh Khodesh]]'') (Numbers 28:11)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Passover]] (Numbers 28:19)\n# To offer the wave offering from the meal of the new wheat (Leviticus 23:10)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Shavuot]] (Numbers 28:26)\n# To bring two leaves to accompany the above sacrifice (Leviticus 23:17)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Rosh Hashana]] (Numbers 29:2)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Yom Kippur]] (Numbers 29:8)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Sukkot]] (Numbers 29:13)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Shmini Atzeret]] (Numbers 29:35)\n# Not to eat sacrifices which have become unfit or blemished (Deuteronomy 14:3)\n# Not to eat from sacrifices offered with improper intentions (Leviticus 7:18)\n# Not to leave sacrifices past the time allowed for eating them (Leviticus 22:30)\n# Not to eat from that which was left over (Leviticus 19:8)\n# Not to eat from sacrifices which became impure (Leviticus 7:19)\n# An impure person must not eat from sacrifices (Leviticus 7:20)\n# To burn the leftover sacrifices (Leviticus 7:17)\n# To burn all impure sacrifices (Leviticus 7:19)\n# To follow the [sacrificial] procedure of Yom Kippur in the sequence prescribed in ''Parshah [[Acharei]] Mot'' (After the death of [[Aaron]]'s sons...)

In addition, large parts of every other book of the Talmud discuss various kinds of sacrifices. ''Pesachim'' is largely devoted to a discussion of how to offer the [[Passover sacrifice]]. ''Yoma'' contains a detailed discussion of the offerings and Temple ritual on Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement), and there are sections in ''seder Moed'' (Festivals) for the special offerings and Temple ritual for other major Jewish holidays. ''Sheqalim'' discusses the annual half-shekel offering for Temple maintenance and Temple governance and management, ''Nashim'' discusses the offerings made by [[Nazirite]]s and the suspected adultress, etc.\n\nThe Talmud provides extensive details not only on how to perform sacrifices but how to adjudicate difficult cases, such what to do if a mistake was made and whether improperly performing one of the required ritual elements invalidates it or not. The Talmud explains how to roast the Passover offering, how to dash blood from different kinds of sacrifices upon the altar, how to prepare the incense, the regulatory code for the system of taxation that financed the priesthood and public sacrifices, and numerous other details.\n\n===Rationale and rabbinic commentary===\n[[Maimonides]], a medieval Jewish scholar, drew on the early critiques of the need for sacrifice, taking the view that God always held sacrifice inferior to prayer and philosophical meditation. However, God understood that the Israelites were used to the animal sacrifices that the surrounding pagan tribes used as the primary way to commune with their gods. As such, in Maimonides' view, it was only natural that Israelites would believe that sacrifice would be a necessary part of the relationship between God and man. Maimonides concludes that God's decision to allow sacrifices was a concession to human psychological limitations. It would have been too much to have expected the Israelites to leap from pagan worship to prayer and meditation in one step. In ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'', he writes:\n{{quote|But the custom which was in those days general among men, and the general mode of worship in which the Israelites were brought up consisted in sacrificing animals... It was in accordance with the wisdom and plan of God...that God did not command us to give up and to discontinue all these manners of service. For to obey such a commandment would have been contrary to the nature of man, who generally cleaves to that to which he is used; it would in those days have made the same impression as a prophet would make at present [the 12th Century] if he called us to the service of God and told us in His name, that we should not pray to God nor fast, nor seek His help in time of trouble; that we should serve Him in thought, and not by any action.<ref>Book III, Chapter 32. Translated by M. Friedlander, 1904, ''The Guide for the Perplexed'', Dover Publications, 1956 edition</ref>}}\n\nIn contrast, many others such as [[Nahmanides]] (in his commentary on Leviticus 1:9) disagreed. Nahmanides cites the fact that the Torah records the practices of animal and other sacrifices from the times of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]] and earlier. Indeed, the purpose of recounting the [[Binding of Isaac|near sacrifice of Isaac]] was to illustrate the sublime significance and need of animal sacrifices as supplanting the abomination of human sacrifices.\n\n===In spiritual practice===\nThe korban also has a spiritual meaning, and refers to some part of an individual's ego, which is given up as a sacrifice to God in honor of the mortality of the worshipper. In keeping with the root of the word, meaning to draw close, and to the common usage as the sacrifice of an animal, so too can the worshipper sacrifice something of this world in order to become closer to God.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =  Dubov\n  | first =  Nissan Dovid \n  | title = Jewish Meditation\n  | publisher =Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center\n  | url = http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=361886\n  | accessdate =  2006-08-17}}</ref>\n\n==The end of sacrifices==\nWith the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem by the Romans, the Jewish practice of offering korbanot stopped for all intents and purposes. Despite subsequent intermittent periods of small Jewish groups offering the traditional sacrifices on the Temple Mount, the practice effectively ended.\n\n[[Rabbinic Judaism]] was forced to undergo a significant development in response to this change; no longer could Judaism revolve around the Temple services. The destruction of the Temple led to a development of Judaism in the direction of text study, prayer, and personal observance. [[Orthodox Judaism]] regards this as being largely an alternative way of fulfilling the obligations of the Temple. Other branches of Judaism ([[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]]) regard the korbanot as an ancient ritual that will not return. A range of responses is recorded in classical rabbinic literature, describing this subject.\n\n:Once, Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai was walking with his disciple, Rabbi Y'hoshua, near Jerusalem after the destruction of the Temple. Rabbi Y'hoshua looked at the Temple ruins and said \"Alas for us!! The place that atoned for the sins of the people Israel lies in ruins!\" Then Rabbi Yohannan ben Zakkai spoke to him these words of comfort:  'Be not grieved, my son. There is another equally meritorious way of gaining ritual atonement, even though the Temple is destroyed. We can still gain ritual atonement through deeds of loving-kindness. For it is written \"Loving kindness I desire, not sacrifice.\" (Hosea 6:6)\n:[[Midrash]] Avot D'Rabbi Nathan 4:5\n\nIn the [[Babylonian Talmud]], a number of sages opined that following Jewish law, doing charitable deeds, and studying Jewish texts is greater than performing animal sacrifices.\n\n:Rabbi Elazar said: Doing righteous deeds of charity is greater than offering all of the sacrifices, as it is written: \"Doing charity and justice is more desirable to the Lord than sacrifice\" (Proverbs 21:3).\n:Babylonian Talmud, Sukkah 49\n\nNonetheless, numerous texts of the Talmud stress the importance of and hope for eventual re-introduction of sacrifices, and regard their loss as a terrible tragedy. Partaking of sacrificial offerings was compared to eating directly at one's Father's table, whose loss synagogue worship does not quite entirely replace. One example is in ''Berachot'':\n:And I said to him: I heard a heavenly voice that was cooing like a dove and saying, \"Woe to the children because of whose sins I destroyed My house, and burned My temple, and exiled them among the nations of the world. And he [Elijah the prophet] said to me: \"By your life and the life of your head! It is not only at this moment that [the heavenly voice] says this. But on each and every day it says this three times. And not only this, but at the time that the people of Israel enter the synagogues and houses of study, and respond (in the [[Kaddish]]) \"May His great name be blessed\", the Holy One, Blessed is He, shakes His head and says: \"Fortunate for the king who is praised this way in his house. What is there for the Father who has exiled His children. And woe to the children who have been exiled from their Father's table.\"  (Talmud ''Berachot'' 3a).\n\nAnother example is in ''Sheqalim'':\n:Rabbi Akiva said: Shimon Ben Loga related the following to me: I was once collecting grasses, and I saw a child from the [[House of Avitnas]] (the incense-makers). And I saw that he cried, and I saw that he laughed. I said to him, \"My son, why did you cry?\" He said, Because of the glory of my Father's house that has decreased.\" I asked \"And why did you laugh?\" He said to me \"Because of the glory prepared for the righteous in the future.\" I asked \"And what did you see?\" [that brought on these emotions]. \"The herb ''[[Maaleh Ashan|maaleh ashan]]'' is growing next to me. [''Maaleh Ashan'' is the secret ingredient in the incense that made the smoke rise, which according to the Talmud the [[House of Avitnas]] never revealed.]\"\n\n===Liturgical attention to end of sacrifices===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nNumerous details of the daily religious practice of an ordinary Jew are connected to keeping memory of the rhythm of the life of the Temple and its sacrifices. For example, the Mishna begins with a statement that the [[Shema Yisrael]] prayer is to be recited in the evening at the time when Kohanim who were ''[[Tumah and taharah|tamei]]'' (ritually impure) are permitted to enter to eat their [[heave offering]] (a food-tithe given to priests) following purification. A detailed discussion of the obligations of tithing, ritual purity, and other elements central to the Temple and priesthood is required in order to determine the meaning of this contemporary daily Jewish obligation.\n\n===Other occasions===\nJewish services for [[Shabbat]], Jewish holidays and other occasions include special prayers for the restoration of sacrifices. For example, the traditional Yom Kippur liturgy contains repeated prayers for the restoration of sacrifices and every [[High Holiday]] [[Amidah]] contains [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 56:7:\n:Even them will I bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer; their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be acceptable upon Mine altar; for My house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.<ref name=\"mechon-mamre.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1056.htm|title=Isaiah 56 / Hebrew - English Bible / Mechon-Mamre|website=www.mechon-mamre.org}}</ref>\n\n==Modern view and resumption of sacrifices==\n\n===Future of sacrifices in Judaism===\n{{see also| Temple in Jerusalem}}\nThe prevailing belief among rabbinic Jews is that in the [[Messianic Age|messianic era]], the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]] will come and a [[Third Temple]] will be built. It is believed that the korbanot will be reinstituted, but to what extent and for how long is unknown. Some biblical and classical rabbinic sources hold that most or all sacrifices will not need to be offered.\n\n* In the future all sacrifices, with the exception of the Thanksgiving-sacrifice, will be discontinued. (Midrash Vayikra Rabbah 9:7)\n* All sacrifices will be annulled in the future. (Tanchuma Emor 14, Vayikra Rabbah 9:7)\n* Then the grain-offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to God as in the days of old, and as in ancient years. (Malachi 3:4)\n* It is impossible to go suddenly from one extreme to the other;...the custom which was in those days general among all men, and the general mode of worship in which the Israelites were brought up consisted of sacrificing animals in the temples... For this reason God allowed this kind of service to continue.  The sacrificial system is not the primary object, rather supplications, and prayer. (Maimonides, The Guide to the Perplexed III 32)\n\nThe majority view of classical rabbis is that the Torah's commandments will still be applicable and in force during the messianic era. However, a significant minority of rabbis held that most of the commandments will be nullified in the messianic era, thus holding that sacrifices will not be reinstated. Examples of such rabbinic views include:\n* Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Niddah 61b and Tractate Shabbat 151b.\n* Midrash Shochar Tov (Mizmor 146:5) states that God will permit what is now forbidden.\n\n[[Orthodox Judaism]] holds that in the messianic era, most or all of the korbanot will be reinstituted, at least for a time. [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]], hold that no animal sacrifices will be offered in a rebuilt Temple at all, following the position of Tanchuma Emor 14 and Vayikra Rabbah 9:7.\n\n===Nineteenth and twentieth century===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nIn the 1800s a number of Orthodox rabbis studied the idea of reinstating korbanot on the Temple Mount, even though the messianic era had not yet arrived and the Temple was not rebuilt. A number of [[responsa]] concluded that within certain parameters, it is permissible according to Jewish law to offer such sacrifices.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, [[Israel Meir Kagan]] advised some followers to set up special ''[[yeshiva]]s'' for married students known as ''Qodshim [[Kolel]]im'' that would specialize in the study of the korbanot and study with greater intensity the ''qodshim'' sections of the [[Talmud]] in order to prepare for the arrival of the Jewish Messiah who would oversee the rebuilding of the original Temple of Solomon in [[Jerusalem]] that would be known as the [[Third Temple]]. His advice was taken seriously and today there are a number of well-established [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] institutions in [[Israel]] that focus solely on the subject of the korbanot, ''qodshim'', and the needs of the future Jewish Temple, such as the [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty]].\n\n===Efforts to restore korbanot===\n{{Main|The Third Temple}}\nA few groups, notably the [[Temple Institute]] and the [[Temple Mount Faithful]], have petitioned the Israeli government to rebuild a Third Temple on the [[Temple Mount]] and restore sacrificial worship. The Israeli government has not responded favorably. Most Orthodox Jews regard rebuilding a Temple as an activity for a Jewish Messiah as part of a future [[Jewish eschatology]], and most non-Orthodox Jews do not believe in the restoration of sacrificial worship at all. The Temple Institute has been constructing ritual objects in preparation for a resumption of sacrifices.\n\n==View among modern Jewish denominations==\n\n===Contemporary Orthodox Judaism===\nToday Orthodox Judaism includes mention of each korban on either a daily basis in the ''[[siddur]]'' (daily prayer book), or in the ''[[machzor]]'' (holiday prayerbook) as part of the prayers for the relevant days concerned. They are also referred to in the prayerbooks of Conservative Judaism, in an abbreviated fashion.\n\nOn each Jewish holiday the sections in the Torah mentioning that festival's korbanot is read out loud in [[synagogue]].\n\n====Daily services====\nIn the very early morning daily ''[[Shacharit]]'' prayers for example, they include the following in order of mention, actually called the korbanot. The following example is taken from the [[Nusach Ashkenaz]].\n* ''Kiyor'' Describing the basin containing pure water to wash up before touching the korbanot (offerings), based on Exodus 30: 17-21.<ref name=\"bible.ort.org\">http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=30</ref>\n* ''Trumat Hadeshen'' Removing the ashes of the ''korban olah'' (elevation offering), based on Leviticus 6:1-6.<ref>http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=3&CHAPTER=6</ref>\n* ''korban Tamid'' Perpetual daily offerings: \"...Fire-offering...male yearling [[sheep|lambs]] unblemished two a day...\" based on Numbers 28:1-8.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=4&CHAPTER=28</ref>\n* ''Ketoret'' [[Incense]] [from] [[spice]]s: \"...stacte, onycha, and galbanum, ...and [[frankincense]]...\" Based on Exodus 30:34-36;7-8...<ref name=\"bible.ort.org\"/>\"[[myrrh]], [[Cinnamomum cassia|cassia]], [[spikenard]], [[saffron]], costus, aromatic bark, [[cinnamon]], ley, [[salt]], [[amber]]...\" based on the Babylonian [[Talmud]] ''Kritut'' 6a; Jerusalem Talmud ''Yoma'' 4:5; 33a.\n* ''korban Musaf'' The additional offerings for [[Shabbat]]: \"On the Sabbath...two male lambs...fine [[flour]] for a meal offering mixed with oil and its [[wine]] libation...\" based on Numbers 28:9-10.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* ''korban Rosh Chodesh'' Offering for the new month: ...Two young [[bull]]s, one [[Sheep|ram]], seven lambs...fine flour ...mixed with [[olive oil]]...one he [[goat]]... and its wine libation.\" Based on Numbers 28: 11-15.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* ''Zevachim'' Chapter 5 of [[Mishnah]] ''Zevachim'' is then cited. (It was included in the ''siddur'' at this stage because it discusses all the sacrifices and the sages do not dispute within it):\n**A. ''Eizehu mekoman shel z'vachim'' Places for the ''zevachim korbanot'' to be offered: \"...The slaughter of the bull and the he-goat of Yom Kippur is in the north [of the altar]...\"\n**B. ''Parim hanisrafim'' [[Bull]]s that are completely burned: \"...These are burned in the place where the [altar] ashes are deposited.\"\n**C. ''Chatot hatzibur v'hayachid'' Sin offerings of the community and the individual: \"...The he-goats...are eaten within the [Temple courtyard] curtains by male priests...until midnight.\"\n**D. ''Ha'olah qodesh qodashim'' The elevation offering is among the offerings with a major-degree-of-holiness: \"...it is entirely consumed by fire.\"\n**E. ''Zivchei shalmei tzibur v'ashamot'' Communal peace offerings and guilt offerings: \"...are eaten within the [Temple courtyard] by males of the priesthood...until midnight.\"\n**F. ''Hatodah v'eil nazir qodashim kalim'' The thanksgiving offering and the ram of a Nazirite are offerings of a minor-degree holiness: \"They are eaten throughout the city [of Jerusalem] by anyone, prepared in any manner...until midnight...\"\n**G. ''Sh'lamim qodashim kalim'' The peace offerings are of lesser (lighter) holiness:  \"...Is eaten by the ''kohanim''...throughout the city [of Jerusalem] by anyone...\"\n**H. ''Hab'chor vehama'aser vehapesach qodashim kalim'' The firstborn and tithe of animals and the Passover offering are offerings of lesser (lighter) holiness: \"...The Passover offering is eaten only at night...only if roasted.\"\n* ''Rabbi Yishmael omer'' Rabbi Yishmael says: Through thirteen rules is the Torah elucidated. (Introduction to the ''Sifra'', part of the Oral Law).\n* ''Yehi Ratzon'' (Ending) The study session concludes with a prayer (\"May it be thy will...) for the restoration of the Temple in Jerusalem and the resumption of sacrifices. (...that the Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and grant our portion in your Torah and there we shall serve you with reverence as in days of old and in former years. And may the grain offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasing to God, as in days of old and in former years.\")\n\nThe [[Amidah]]\n* ''Retzai'' Every the Orthodox [[Amidah]], the central prayer of Jewish services, contains the paragraph: \"Be favorable, Oh Lord our God, to your people Israel and their prayer, and restore the service of the [[Holy of Holies]] of Your House, and accept the fire-offerings of Israel and their prayer with love and favor, and may the service of your people Israel always be favored.\" Conservative Judaism removes the fire-offerings clause from this prayer.\n* ''Yehi Ratzon'' Private recitiation of the Amidah traditionally ends with the ''Yehi Ratzon'' prayer for the restoration of the Temple.\n* The Amidah itself is said to represent liturgically the ''purpose'' of the daily korban, while the recitation of the korbanot sections fulfill the ''formal responsibility'' to perform them, in the absence of the Temple.\n\nThe weekday [[Torah reading]]\n* A set of blessings connected with the weekday Torah reading include a prayer for the [[Third Temple|restoration of the Temple]]: \"May it be the will before our Father who is in heaven to establish the House of our lives and to return his [[Shekhinah]]'' into our midst, speedily, in our days, and let us say Amen.\"\n\n===In Conservative Judaism===\nConservative Judaism disavows the resumption of qorbanot. Consistent with this view, it has deleted prayers for the resumption of sacrifices from the Conservative ''siddur'', including both the morning study section from the sacrifices, prayers for the restoration of qorbanot in the Amidah, and various mentions elsewhere. Consistent with its view that a priesthood and sacrificial system will not be restored, Conservative Judaism has also lifted certain restrictions on ''kohanim'', including limitations on marriage prohibiting marrying a divorced woman or a convert. Conservative Judaism does, however, believe in the restoration of a Temple in some form, and in the continuation of kohanim and [[Levites]] under relaxed requirements, and has retained references to both in its prayer books. Consistent with its stress on the continuity of tradition, many Conservative synagogues have also retained references to [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday|Festival]] qorbanot, changing all references to sacrifices into the past tense (e.g. the Orthodox \"and there we will sacrifice\" is changed to \"and there they sacrificed\"). Some more liberal Conservative synagogues, however, have removed all references to sacrifices, past or present, from the prayer service. The most recent official Conservative prayer book, [[Sim Shalom]], provides both service alternatives.\n\n===In Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism===\n[[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] disavow all belief in a restoration of a Temple, the resumption of qorbanot, or the continuation of identified Cohens or Levites. These branches of Judaism believe that all such practices represent ancient practices inconsistent with the requirements of modernity, and have removed all or virtually all references to qorbanot from their prayer books.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Corban}}\n* [[Abomination (Judaism)]]\n* [[Du\u0161ni Brav]]\n* [[Hakarat HaTov]]\n* [[Holy Qurbana]]\n* [[Incense offering]]\n* [[Kourbania]]\n* [[Priesthood (Ancient Israel)]]\n* [[Psalm 100]]\n* [[Qurbani]]\n* [[Red heifer]]\n* [[Wave offering]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[J.

The Prophets disparaged sacrifices that were offered without a regeneration of the heart, i.e., a determined turning from sin and returning to God by striving after righteousness ([[Book of Hosea]] 14:1-2, Joel 2:13, Micah 6:6-8). At the same time, prophets stressed the importance of offerings combined with justice and good even as they taught that offerings were unacceptable unless combined with heartfelt repentance and good deeds. [[Malachi]], the last prophet in the Hebrew Bible, emphasized that the goal of repentance is not to end sacrifices, but to make the offerings fit for acceptance once again ([[Book of Malachi]], 3:3-4). Similarly, the [[Book of Isaiah]] despite disparagement of sacrifices without justice, portrays sacrifice as having a role complementary with prayer in a universalistic [[eschatology]] (Isaiah 56:1; 6-7).\n\n==Rabbinical interpretation==\n\n===100 among the 613 commandments===\nAccording to [[Maimonides]], about one hundred of the permanent [[613 commandments]] based on the Torah, by rabbinical enumeration, directly concern sacrifices, excluding those commandments that concern the actual Temple and the priests themselves of which there are about another fifty.<ref>\n# Not to burn anything on the Golden Altar besides incense (Exodus 30:9)\n# To offer only unblemished animals (Leviticus 22:21)\n# Not to dedicate a blemished animal for the altar (Leviticus 22:20)\n# Not to slaughter it (Leviticus 22:22)\n# Not to sprinkle its blood (Leviticus 22:24)\n# Not to burn its ''[[Chelev|khelev]]'' (Leviticus 22:22)\n# Not to offer a temporarily blemished animal (Deuteronomy 17:1)\n# Not to sacrifice blemished animals even if offered by non-Jews (Leviticus 22:25)\n# Not to inflict wounds upon dedicated animals (Leviticus 22:21)\n# To redeem dedicated animals which have become disqualified (Deuteronomy 12:15)\n# To offer only animals which are at least eight days old (Leviticus 22:27)\n# Not to offer animals bought with the wages of a harlot or the animal exchanged for a dog (Deuteronomy 23:19)\n# Not to burn honey or yeast on the altar (Leviticus 2:11)\n# To salt all sacrifices (Leviticus 2:13)\n# Not to omit the salt from sacrifices (Leviticus 2:13)\n# Carry out the procedure of the burnt offering as prescribed in the Torah (Leviticus 1:3)\n# Not to eat its meat (Deuteronomy 12:17)\n# Carry out the procedure of the sin offering (Leviticus 6:18)\n# Not to eat the meat of the inner sin offering (Leviticus 6:23)\n# Not to decapitate a fowl brought as a sin offering (Leviticus 5:8)\n# Carry out the procedure of the guilt offering (Leviticus 7:1)\n# The ''kohanim'' must eat the sacrificial meat in the Temple (Exodus 29:33)\n# The ''kohanim'' must not eat the meat outside the Temple courtyard (Deuteronomy 12:17)\n# A non-''kohen'' must not eat sacrificial meat (Exodus 29:33)\n# To follow the procedure of the peace offering (Leviticus 7:11)\n# Not to eat the meat of minor sacrifices before sprinkling the blood (Deuteronomy 12:17)\n# To bring meal offerings as prescribed in the Torah (Leviticus 2:1)\n# Not to put oil on the meal offerings of wrongdoers (Leviticus 5:11)\n# Not to put frankincense on the meal offerings of wrongdoers (Leviticus 3:11)\n# Not to eat the meal offering of the High Priest (Leviticus 6:16)\n# Not to bake a meal offering as leavened bread (Leviticus 6:10)\n# The ''kohanim'' must eat the remains of the meal offerings (Leviticus 6:9)\n# To bring all avowed and freewill offerings to the Temple on the first subsequent festival (Deuteronomy 12:5-6)\n# To offer all sacrifices in the Temple (Deuteronomy 12:11)\n# To bring all sacrifices from outside Israel to the Temple (Deuteronomy 12:26)\n# Not to slaughter sacrifices outside the courtyard (of the Temple) (Leviticus 17:4)\n# Not to offer any sacrifices outside the courtyard (of the Temple) (Deuteronomy 12:13)\n# To offer two lambs every day (Numbers 28:3)\n# To light a fire on the altar every day (Leviticus 6:6)\n# Not to extinguish this fire (Leviticus 6:6)\n# To remove the ashes from the altar every day (Leviticus 6:3)\n# To burn incense every day (Exodus 30:7)\n# The ''Kohen Gadol'' must bring a meal offering every day (Leviticus 6:13)\n# To bring two additional lambs as burnt offerings on Shabbat (Numbers 28:9)\n# To bring additional offerings on the New Month (''[[Rosh Khodesh]]'') (Numbers 28:11)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Passover]] (Numbers 28:19)\n# To offer the wave offering from the meal of the new wheat (Leviticus 23:10)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Shavuot]] (Numbers 28:26)\n# To bring two leaves to accompany the above sacrifice (Leviticus 23:17)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Rosh Hashana]] (Numbers 29:2)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Yom Kippur]] (Numbers 29:8)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Sukkot]] (Numbers 29:13)\n# To bring additional offerings on [[Shmini Atzeret]] (Numbers 29:35)\n# Not to eat sacrifices which have become unfit or blemished (Deuteronomy 14:3)\n# Not to eat from sacrifices offered with improper intentions (Leviticus 7:18)\n# Not to leave sacrifices past the time allowed for eating them (Leviticus 22:30)\n# Not to eat from that which was left over (Leviticus 19:8)\n# Not to eat from sacrifices which became impure (Leviticus 7:19)\n# An impure person must not eat from sacrifices (Leviticus 7:20)\n# To burn the leftover sacrifices (Leviticus 7:17)\n# To burn all impure sacrifices (Leviticus 7:19)\n# To follow the [sacrificial] procedure of Yom Kippur in the sequence prescribed in ''Parshah [[Acharei]] Mot'' (After the death of [[Aaron]]'s sons...)

In addition, large parts of every other book of the Talmud discuss various kinds of sacrifices. ''Pesachim'' is largely devoted to a discussion of how to offer the [[Passover sacrifice]]. ''Yoma'' contains a detailed discussion of the offerings and Temple ritual on Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement), and there are sections in ''seder Moed'' (Festivals) for the special offerings and Temple ritual for other major Jewish holidays. ''Sheqalim'' discusses the annual half-shekel offering for Temple maintenance and Temple governance and management, ''Nashim'' discusses the offerings made by [[Nazirite]]s and the suspected adultress, etc.\n\nThe Talmud provides extensive details not only on how to perform sacrifices but how to adjudicate difficult cases, such what to do if a mistake was made and whether improperly performing one of the required ritual elements invalidates it or not. The Talmud explains how to roast the Passover offering, how to dash blood from different kinds of sacrifices upon the altar, how to prepare the incense, the regulatory code for the system of taxation that financed the priesthood and public sacrifices, and numerous other details.\n\n===Rationale and rabbinic commentary===\n[[Maimonides]], a medieval Jewish scholar, drew on the early critiques of the need for sacrifice, taking the view that God always held sacrifice inferior to prayer and philosophical meditation. However, God understood that the Israelites were used to the animal sacrifices that the surrounding pagan tribes used as the primary way to commune with their gods. As such, in Maimonides' view, it was only natural that Israelites would believe that sacrifice would be a necessary part of the relationship between God and man. Maimonides concludes that God's decision to allow sacrifices was a concession to human psychological limitations. It would have been too much to have expected the Israelites to leap from pagan worship to prayer and meditation in one step. In ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'', he writes:\n{{quote|But the custom which was in those days general among men, and the general mode of worship in which the Israelites were brought up consisted in sacrificing animals... It was in accordance with the wisdom and plan of God...that God did not command us to give up and to discontinue all these manners of service. For to obey such a commandment would have been contrary to the nature of man, who generally cleaves to that to which he is used; it would in those days have made the same impression as a prophet would make at present [the 12th Century] if he called us to the service of God and told us in His name, that we should not pray to God nor fast, nor seek His help in time of trouble; that we should serve Him in thought, and not by any action.<ref>Book III, Chapter 32. Translated by M. Friedlander, 1904, ''The Guide for the Perplexed'', Dover Publications, 1956 edition</ref>}}\n\nIn contrast, many others such as [[Nahmanides]] (in his commentary on Leviticus 1:9) disagreed. Nahmanides cites the fact that the Torah records the practices of animal and other sacrifices from the times of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]] and earlier. Indeed, the purpose of recounting the [[Binding of Isaac|near sacrifice of Isaac]] was to illustrate the sublime significance and need of animal sacrifices as supplanting the abomination of human sacrifices.\n\n===In spiritual practice===\nThe korban also has a spiritual meaning, and refers to some part of an individual's ego, which is given up as a sacrifice to God in honor of the mortality of the worshipper. In keeping with the root of the word, meaning to draw close, and to the common usage as the sacrifice of an animal, so too can the worshipper sacrifice something of this world in order to become closer to God.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =  Dubov\n  | first =  Nissan Dovid \n  | title = Jewish Meditation\n  | publisher =Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center\n  | url = http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=361886\n  | accessdate =  2006-08-17}}</ref>\n\n==The end of sacrifices==\nWith the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem by the Romans, the Jewish practice of offering korbanot stopped for all intents and purposes. Despite subsequent intermittent periods of small Jewish groups offering the traditional sacrifices on the Temple Mount, the practice effectively ended.\n\n[[Rabbinic Judaism]] was forced to undergo a significant development in response to this change; no longer could Judaism revolve around the Temple services. The destruction of the Temple led to a development of Judaism in the direction of text study, prayer, and personal observance. [[Orthodox Judaism]] regards this as being largely an alternative way of fulfilling the obligations of the Temple. Other branches of Judaism ([[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]]) regard the korbanot as an ancient ritual that will not return. A range of responses is recorded in classical rabbinic literature, describing this subject.\n\n:Once, Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai was walking with his disciple, Rabbi Y'hoshua, near Jerusalem after the destruction of the Temple. Rabbi Y'hoshua looked at the Temple ruins and said \"Alas for us!! The place that atoned for the sins of the people Israel lies in ruins!\" Then Rabbi Yohannan ben Zakkai spoke to him these words of comfort:  'Be not grieved, my son. There is another equally meritorious way of gaining ritual atonement, even though the Temple is destroyed. We can still gain ritual atonement through deeds of loving-kindness. For it is written \"Loving kindness I desire, not sacrifice.\" (Hosea 6:6)\n:[[Midrash]] Avot D'Rabbi Nathan 4:5\n\nIn the [[Babylonian Talmud]], a number of sages opined that following Jewish law, doing charitable deeds, and studying Jewish texts is greater than performing animal sacrifices.\n\n:Rabbi Elazar said: Doing righteous deeds of charity is greater than offering all of the sacrifices, as it is written: \"Doing charity and justice is more desirable to the Lord than sacrifice\" (Proverbs 21:3).\n:Babylonian Talmud, Sukkah 49\n\nNonetheless, numerous texts of the Talmud stress the importance of and hope for eventual re-introduction of sacrifices, and regard their loss as a terrible tragedy. Partaking of sacrificial offerings was compared to eating directly at one's Father's table, whose loss synagogue worship does not quite entirely replace. One example is in ''Berachot'':\n:And I said to him: I heard a heavenly voice that was cooing like a dove and saying, \"Woe to the children because of whose sins I destroyed My house, and burned My temple, and exiled them among the nations of the world. And he [Elijah the prophet] said to me: \"By your life and the life of your head! It is not only at this moment that [the heavenly voice] says this. But on each and every day it says this three times. And not only this, but at the time that the people of Israel enter the synagogues and houses of study, and respond (in the [[Kaddish]]) \"May His great name be blessed\", the Holy One, Blessed is He, shakes His head and says: \"Fortunate for the king who is praised this way in his house. What is there for the Father who has exiled His children. And woe to the children who have been exiled from their Father's table.\"  (Talmud ''Berachot'' 3a).\n\nAnother example is in ''Sheqalim'':\n:Rabbi Akiva said: Shimon Ben Loga related the following to me: I was once collecting grasses, and I saw a child from the [[House of Avitnas]] (the incense-makers). And I saw that he cried, and I saw that he laughed. I said to him, \"My son, why did you cry?\" He said, Because of the glory of my Father's house that has decreased.\" I asked \"And why did you laugh?\" He said to me \"Because of the glory prepared for the righteous in the future.\" I asked \"And what did you see?\" [that brought on these emotions]. \"The herb ''[[Maaleh Ashan|maaleh ashan]]'' is growing next to me. [''Maaleh Ashan'' is the secret ingredient in the incense that made the smoke rise, which according to the Talmud the [[House of Avitnas]] never revealed.]\"\n\n===Liturgical attention to end of sacrifices===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nNumerous details of the daily religious practice of an ordinary Jew are connected to keeping memory of the rhythm of the life of the Temple and its sacrifices. For example, the Mishna begins with a statement that the [[Shema Yisrael]] prayer is to be recited in the evening at the time when Kohanim who were ''[[Tumah and taharah|tamei]]'' (ritually impure) are permitted to enter to eat their [[heave offering]] (a food-tithe given to priests) following purification. A detailed discussion of the obligations of tithing, ritual purity, and other elements central to the Temple and priesthood is required in order to determine the meaning of this contemporary daily Jewish obligation.\n\n===Other occasions===\nJewish services for [[Shabbat]], Jewish holidays and other occasions include special prayers for the restoration of sacrifices. For example, the traditional Yom Kippur liturgy contains repeated prayers for the restoration of sacrifices and every [[High Holiday]] [[Amidah]] contains [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 56:7:\n:Even them will I bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer; their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be acceptable upon Mine altar; for My house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.<ref name=\"mechon-mamre.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1056.htm|title=Isaiah 56 / Hebrew - English Bible / Mechon-Mamre|website=www.mechon-mamre.org}}</ref>\n\n==Modern view and resumption of sacrifices==\n\n===Future of sacrifices in Judaism===\n{{see also| Temple in Jerusalem}}\nThe prevailing belief among rabbinic Jews is that in the [[Messianic Age|messianic era]], the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]] will come and a [[Third Temple]] will be built. It is believed that the korbanot will be reinstituted, but to what extent and for how long is unknown. Some biblical and classical rabbinic sources hold that most or all sacrifices will not need to be offered.\n\n* In the future all sacrifices, with the exception of the Thanksgiving-sacrifice, will be discontinued. (Midrash Vayikra Rabbah 9:7)\n* All sacrifices will be annulled in the future. (Tanchuma Emor 14, Vayikra Rabbah 9:7)\n* Then the grain-offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to God as in the days of old, and as in ancient years. (Malachi 3:4)\n* It is impossible to go suddenly from one extreme to the other;...the custom which was in those days general among all men, and the general mode of worship in which the Israelites were brought up consisted of sacrificing animals in the temples... For this reason God allowed this kind of service to continue.  The sacrificial system is not the primary object, rather supplications, and prayer. (Maimonides, The Guide to the Perplexed III 32)\n\nThe majority view of classical rabbis is that the Torah's commandments will still be applicable and in force during the messianic era. However, a significant minority of rabbis held that most of the commandments will be nullified in the messianic era, thus holding that sacrifices will not be reinstated. Examples of such rabbinic views include:\n* Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Niddah 61b and Tractate Shabbat 151b.\n* Midrash Shochar Tov (Mizmor 146:5) states that God will permit what is now forbidden.\n\n[[Orthodox Judaism]] holds that in the messianic era, most or all of the korbanot will be reinstituted, at least for a time. [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]], hold that no animal sacrifices will be offered in a rebuilt Temple at all, following the position of Tanchuma Emor 14 and Vayikra Rabbah 9:7.\n\n===Nineteenth and twentieth century===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nIn the 1800s a number of Orthodox rabbis studied the idea of reinstating korbanot on the Temple Mount, even though the messianic era had not yet arrived and the Temple was not rebuilt. A number of [[responsa]] concluded that within certain parameters, it is permissible according to Jewish law to offer such sacrifices.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, [[Israel Meir Kagan]] advised some followers to set up special ''[[yeshiva]]s'' for married students known as ''Qodshim [[Kolel]]im'' that would specialize in the study of the korbanot and study with greater intensity the ''qodshim'' sections of the [[Talmud]] in order to prepare for the arrival of the Jewish Messiah who would oversee the rebuilding of the original Temple of Solomon in [[Jerusalem]] that would be known as the [[Third Temple]]. His advice was taken seriously and today there are a number of well-established [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] institutions in [[Israel]] that focus solely on the subject of the korbanot, ''qodshim'', and the needs of the future Jewish Temple, such as the [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty]].\n\n===Efforts to restore korbanot===\n{{Main|The Third Temple}}\nA few groups, notably the [[Temple Institute]] and the [[Temple Mount Faithful]], have petitioned the Israeli government to rebuild a Third Temple on the [[Temple Mount]] and restore sacrificial worship. The Israeli government has not responded favorably. Most Orthodox Jews regard rebuilding a Temple as an activity for a Jewish Messiah as part of a future [[Jewish eschatology]], and most non-Orthodox Jews do not believe in the restoration of sacrificial worship at all. The Temple Institute has been constructing ritual objects in preparation for a resumption of sacrifices.\n\n==View among modern Jewish denominations==\n\n===Contemporary Orthodox Judaism===\nToday Orthodox Judaism includes mention of each korban on either a daily basis in the ''[[siddur]]'' (daily prayer book), or in the ''[[machzor]]'' (holiday prayerbook) as part of the prayers for the relevant days concerned. They are also referred to in the prayerbooks of Conservative Judaism, in an abbreviated fashion.\n\nOn each Jewish holiday the sections in the Torah mentioning that festival's korbanot is read out loud in [[synagogue]].\n\n====Daily services====\nIn the very early morning daily ''[[Shacharit]]'' prayers for example, they include the following in order of mention, actually called the korbanot. The following example is taken from the [[Nusach Ashkenaz]].\n* ''Kiyor'' Describing the basin containing pure water to wash up before touching the korbanot (offerings), based on Exodus 30: 17-21.<ref name=\"bible.ort.org\">http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=30</ref>\n* ''Trumat Hadeshen'' Removing the ashes of the ''korban olah'' (elevation offering), based on Leviticus 6:1-6.<ref>http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=3&CHAPTER=6</ref>\n* ''korban Tamid'' Perpetual daily offerings: \"...Fire-offering...male yearling [[sheep|lambs]] unblemished two a day...\" based on Numbers 28:1-8.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=4&CHAPTER=28</ref>\n* ''Ketoret'' [[Incense]] [from] [[spice]]s: \"...stacte, onycha, and galbanum, ...and [[frankincense]]...\" Based on Exodus 30:34-36;7-8...<ref name=\"bible.ort.org\"/>\"[[myrrh]], [[Cinnamomum cassia|cassia]], [[spikenard]], [[saffron]], costus, aromatic bark, [[cinnamon]], ley, [[salt]], [[amber]]...\" based on the Babylonian [[Talmud]] ''Kritut'' 6a; Jerusalem Talmud ''Yoma'' 4:5; 33a.\n* ''korban Musaf'' The additional offerings for [[Shabbat]]: \"On the Sabbath...two male lambs...fine [[flour]] for a meal offering mixed with oil and its [[wine]] libation...\" based on Numbers 28:9-10.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* ''korban Rosh Chodesh'' Offering for the new month: ...Two young [[bull]]s, one [[Sheep|ram]], seven lambs...fine flour ...mixed with [[olive oil]]...one he [[goat]]... and its wine libation.\" Based on Numbers 28: 11-15.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* ''Zevachim'' Chapter 5 of [[Mishnah]] ''Zevachim'' is then cited. (It was included in the ''siddur'' at this stage because it discusses all the sacrifices and the sages do not dispute within it):\n**A.

(Introduction to the ''Sifra'', part of the Oral Law).\n* ''Yehi Ratzon'' (Ending) The study session concludes with a prayer (\"May it be thy will...) for the restoration of the Temple in Jerusalem and the resumption of sacrifices. (...that the Temple be rebuilt speedily in our days, and grant our portion in your Torah and there we shall serve you with reverence as in days of old and in former years. And may the grain offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasing to God, as in days of old and in former years.\")\n\nThe [[Amidah]]\n* ''Retzai'' Every the Orthodox [[Amidah]], the central prayer of Jewish services, contains the paragraph: \"Be favorable, Oh Lord our God, to your people Israel and their prayer, and restore the service of the [[Holy of Holies]] of Your House, and accept the fire-offerings of Israel and their prayer with love and favor, and may the service of your people Israel always be favored.\" Conservative Judaism removes the fire-offerings clause from this prayer.\n* ''Yehi Ratzon'' Private recitiation of the Amidah traditionally ends with the ''Yehi Ratzon'' prayer for the restoration of the Temple.\n* The Amidah itself is said to represent liturgically the ''purpose'' of the daily korban, while the recitation of the korbanot sections fulfill the ''formal responsibility'' to perform them, in the absence of the Temple.\n\nThe weekday [[Torah reading]]\n* A set of blessings connected with the weekday Torah reading include a prayer for the [[Third Temple|restoration of the Temple]]: \"May it be the will before our Father who is in heaven to establish the House of our lives and to return his [[Shekhinah]]'' into our midst, speedily, in our days, and let us say Amen.\"\n\n===In Conservative Judaism===\nConservative Judaism disavows the resumption of qorbanot. Consistent with this view, it has deleted prayers for the resumption of sacrifices from the Conservative ''siddur'', including both the morning study section from the sacrifices, prayers for the restoration of qorbanot in the Amidah, and various mentions elsewhere. Consistent with its view that a priesthood and sacrificial system will not be restored, Conservative Judaism has also lifted certain restrictions on ''kohanim'', including limitations on marriage prohibiting marrying a divorced woman or a convert. Conservative Judaism does, however, believe in the restoration of a Temple in some form, and in the continuation of kohanim and [[Levites]] under relaxed requirements, and has retained references to both in its prayer books. Consistent with its stress on the continuity of tradition, many Conservative synagogues have also retained references to [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday|Festival]] qorbanot, changing all references to sacrifices into the past tense (e.g. the Orthodox \"and there we will sacrifice\" is changed to \"and there they sacrificed\"). Some more liberal Conservative synagogues, however, have removed all references to sacrifices, past or present, from the prayer service. The most recent official Conservative prayer book, [[Sim Shalom]], provides both service alternatives.\n\n===In Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism===\n[[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] disavow all belief in a restoration of a Temple, the resumption of qorbanot, or the continuation of identified Cohens or Levites. These branches of Judaism believe that all such practices represent ancient practices inconsistent with the requirements of modernity, and have removed all or virtually all references to qorbanot from their prayer books.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Corban}}\n* [[Abomination (Judaism)]]\n* [[Du\u0161ni Brav]]\n* [[Hakarat HaTov]]\n* [[Holy Qurbana]]\n* [[Incense offering]]\n* [[Kourbania]]\n* [[Priesthood (Ancient Israel)]]\n* [[Psalm 100]]\n* [[Qurbani]]\n* [[Red heifer]]\n* [[Wave offering]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[J.

The detective Superintendent Spence is introduced in this novel, with whom Poirot works again in a few more stories. The Cloade family, brothers and one sister, have had many abrupt changes from the war, losing their brother Gordon in a London bombing raid shortly after his unexpected marriage to a young widow. One son is lost to fighting, a daughter returns from serving as a Wren, and another son seems to be making a successful venture at farming, despite losing his partner in the venture to the war. When the Wren Lynn returns, her interrupted engagement to her cousin resumes, with troublesome interruption from the brother of Uncle Gordon's widow Rosaleen. A stranger in the village, using the literary name Enoch Arden, blackmails David Hunt and is soon found murdered. Hercule Poirot is called in.\n\nRichardson found the \"doubly twisted\" plot, to be \"ingenious enough\", but for him, \"the quintessential zest, the sense of well-being which goes to make up that Christie feeling, is missing.\"<ref name=Richardson1948 /> Another was more pleased with the novel, saying that Poirot solves the mysteries \"with all the acumen that has endeared him to Agatha Christie fans.

A few days after arriving in London with his new wife, his London home is bombed, killing all but two people. One survivor is Gordon's brother-in-law, David Hunter, and the other is his new wife, Rosaleen Cloade. Gordon did not write a new will upon arrival, and his existing will is invalidated by the marriage. Rosaleen inherits Gordon's fortune. A day or so later, during another raid, Poirot sits in a shelter with people from the Concordia club in London and listens to a story about Major Porter's friend Robert Underhay in Africa, about his unhappy marriage and that Underhay may not be dead, told after reading out the news that Gordon Cloade, the second husband of Underhay's widow, was killed by enemy action.\n\nThe death of Gordon Cloade brings unexpected change to his siblings and their families. Gordon gave them capital to start a venture, to handle unexpected expenses, encouraged them not to save, and promised his fortune would be split among them when he died.\n\n==Plot summary==\nIn spring 1946, Lynn Marchmont, a [[Wren (Royal Navy)|Wren]] during the war, settles again in her mother\u2019s home in the village of Warmsley Vale in peacetime, at first happy to be home, then finding life dull. She has been engaged to farmer Rowley Cloade since before the war.\n\nDavid guards his sister and her fortune. Mrs Marchmont gets up the courage to ask Rosaleen for five hundred pounds when David is away, and Rosaleen writes a check. David angrily turns down a request from Frances Cloade, whose family is in desperate need of money.\n\nA man calling himself Enoch Arden arrives at the village inn The Stag, and attempts to blackmail David by saying he knows how to find Rosaleen's first husband, Robert Underhay. Their conversation is overheard by the landlady, who tells Rowley Cloade. A few days later, a maid finds Arden's body in his room with his head smashed in. That same day, David was down from London. He met Lynn on his dash to catch the last train to London, and evidently telephoned her from the London flat shortly after 11 pm, arguing first that he loves her and then that he cannot be good for her. As the murder is believed to have happened before 9 pm, he had enough opportunity and motive and he is arrested.\n\nRowley Cloade appeals to the detective Hercule Poirot to find the true identity of the dead man. Poirot asks Major Porter. Rosaleen sees the body and says she does not know the man at all. At the inquest, Porter says that Arden was indeed Robert Underhay, and the coroner's jury votes against advice to believe him, voting willful murder by David. The estate will revert to the Cloades, if the jury's decision holds, as it means Rosaleen's second marriage was not valid.\n\nPoirot talks to people in the village, including Mrs Leadbetter, a guest at the inn who saw a hussy, a heavily made up woman wearing slacks and an orange scarf, enter the room assigned to the dead man after 10 pm on the fateful evening. As the police believe that David was on the train to London at that time, they let him go, and look more seriously at women. Poirot learns how the death occurred, with a fall on the marble fender of the fireplace. He proposes it was accidental death, not intentional murder.\n\nLynn is falling in love with David. Major Porter commits suicide in London but leaves no note. Poirot realises from a photo at the home of Frances Cloade that Arden was related to her; she admits Arden was Charles Trenton, her second cousin. She came up with the plan to blackmail Rosaleen after hearing Major Porter's story about Underhay. This explains Arden's true identity, but nothing else. Frances denies bribing Major Porter.\n\nWhen Poirot and Lynn visit Rosaleen at home, the maid realizes she does not respond. Poirot sees that Rosaleen has died in her sleep. The doctor identifies the harmless sleeping powder she took, at her bedside table. Superintendent Spence, the investigating officer, suggests that she was the murderer. Rosaleen died from too much morphine; where did she get it?\n\nLynn tells Rowley that she wishes to marry David Hunter and he explodes in anger. Rowley is strangling Lynn when Poirot enters the house, and Rowley stops. David arrives shortly, and Poirot explains everything. Rowley visited Arden, and seeing the resemblance to Frances, reacted angrily to the deception. Punched by Rowley, Arden fell against the marble fireplace fender and died. Rowley saw the opportunity to incriminate David. He smashed in Arden's head with fire tongs and left David's lighter at the scene. Rowley persuaded Porter to give the false identification by offering him money. Then Rowley employed Poirot, who would be sure to go to Porter. Porter's guilt led him to commit suicide, leaving a note that Rowley destroyed. David was about to pay the blackmail to Arden; upon discovering Arden's body, David ran for the late train but missed it. David then backtracked to The Stag, disguised himself as a woman, and played out the scene, heard by Mrs Leadbetter, which established the later time of death. Then he called Rosaleen, who placed a call to Lynn that was delivered by the operator but then cut off. A minute later, David called Lynn from the local train station, giving her the impression that he was calling from London. He returned to London on the early morning milk train the next day.\n\nOf the three deaths, Poirot says one is accidental, one is a suicide, and one is murder. The true murder victim was Rosaleen. The woman known as Rosaleen was not David Hunter's sister; his sister was killed and the housemaid Eileen Corrigan had survived the bombing. Poirot sent to Ireland for a photo of Eileen, which explained the truth of what happened during the war. David persuaded her to be Rosaleen. Now he could kill this accomplice with a morphine pill and marry Lynn, whom he loved. Poirot knows all these details but only some of them are known to the police. Rowley feels guilty about the deaths of Trenton and Porter. The police focus on David killing Rosaleen/Eileen, and proving all of that case. After a while, Lynn returns to Rowley, realizing she does love him, especially after his show of force. Life will not be dull with him.\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Hercule Poirot]]: Belgian detective who lives in London.\n* Superintendent Spence: investigating officer.\n* Sergeant Graves: Spence's assistant.\n* Rosaleen Cloade: twice widowed while in her early 20s; formerly Mrs Robert Underhay.\n* David Hunter: Rosaleen's brother.

The quotation is given in full as the [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] to the novel.\n\n==Literary significance and reception==\n\nNo review of this book appeared in the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]''.\n\nFor once, Maurice Richardson, in his review of the 21 November 1948 issue of ''[[The Observer]]'' was slightly unimpressed: \"Agatha Christie has, if not a whole day off, at least part of the afternoon. The killing of the blackmailing Enoch Arden, who puts up at the local to harry the already embarrassed Cloade family, the murder that follows, and Poirot's doubly twisted solution are ingenious enough, but the characterisation is a little below par. The quintessential zest, the sense of well-being which goes to make up that Christie feeling, is missing.\"<ref name=Richardson1948>{{cite news |last=Richardson |first=Maurice |newspaper=The Observer |date=21 November 1948 |page=3 |title=Review of Taken at the Flood}}</ref>\n\nAn unnamed reviewer in the ''[[Toronto Star|Toronto Daily Star]]'' of 10 April 1948 said, \"Hercule Poirot, whose eggshaped cranium is crammed with lively gray cells, proves himself a bit of a mug before he sorts out all the details of [Enoch Arden's] death and other even more baffling mysteries. But he does it with all the acumen that has endeared him to Agatha Christie fans. Fantastic and topping.\"<ref name=Star1948>{{cite news |newspaper=Toronto Daily Star |date=10 April 1948 |page=27 |title=Review}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Barnard]] summarised the plot of the novel as an \"Elderly man married to a glamorous nitwit of dubious social background [which] is a common plot-element in Christie. Here she is widowed (in an air-raid \u2013 this is one of the few Christies anchored to an actual time), and burdened by financially insatiable relatives, both of blood and in-law. But who exactly is dead, and who isn't? And who is what they seem, and who isn't?\" His commentary is favorable on the title, more cryptic on the novel itself, as he said it was a \"Compulsive reworking of [[Tennyson]]ian and Christian themes, and pretty high up in the range of classic titles.\"<ref name=Barnard1990>{{cite book |last=Barnard |first=Robert |title=A Talent to Deceive \u2013 an appreciation of Agatha Christie |edition=Revised |page=206 |publisher=Fontana Books |year=1990 |isbn=0-00-637474-3}}</ref> \n\n==References to other works==\n\nThe false alibi used by the murderer of a witness sighting the missed train smoke was a partial re-use of a plot device used by Christie in the 1925 short story ''[[The Mysterious Mr. Quin#The Sign in the Sky|The Sign in the Sky]]'', later published in the 1930 collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr. Quin]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:Taken at the Flood First Edition Cover 1948.jpg|right|thumb|Dustjacket illustration of the UK First Edition (Book was first published in the US)]]\n* 1948, Dodd Mead and Company (New York), March 1948, Hardcover, 242 pp\n* 1948, Collins Crime Club (London), November 1948, Hardcover, 192 pp\n* 1949, [[Pocket Books]] (New York), Paperback\n* 1955, [[Dell Books]], Paperback, 224 pp\n* 1961, Fontana Books (Imprint of [[HarperCollins]]), Paperback, 192 pp\n* 1965, [[Pan Books]], Paperback, 204 pp\n* 1971, Ulverscroft [[Large-print]] Edition, Hardcover, 386 pp {{ISBN|0-85456-084-X}}\n* 2006, Audio Partners, narrator Hugh Fraser, {{ISBN| 978-1-57270-533-3}}\n* 2016, William Morrow & Company (USA edition), Hardcover {{ISBN|978-0-06-257342-1}}\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===Television===\n\nA television film was produced in 2006 with [[David Suchet]] as Poirot in the [[ITV Network|ITV]] series ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot]]''. The cast included [[Elliot Cowan]] as David Hunter, [[Eva Birthistle]] as Rosaleen, [[Celia Imrie]] as Kathy Cloade, [[Jenny Agutter]] as Adela Marchmont and [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] as Dr. Lionel Woodward. The film made several significant changes to the plot:\n\n* Like almost all episodes of the TV series, the adaptation shifts the setting to the late 1930s.\n* David's motive is modified in the adaption, upgrading him from a simple murderer, to that of a mass murderer. In the adaptation, the deaths of Gordon Cloade, Rosaleen Turner, and the entire Cloade estate that is present with them, are assumed to be the result of an apparent gas explosion, but Poirot later investigates this, and reveals in his denouement that the explosion was caused by dynamite that David had planted in the house, who sought revenge against his sister for marrying Gordon and excluding her brother as her \"[[Incest|first love]]\". Whereas in the novel, there is no mentioning of incest. He and his accomplice, Eileen Corrigan, who were present in the house at the time, took shelter in the basement once the explosives had been planted, and then emerged from the ruins afterwards.\n* Eileen's involvement is significantly changed - She is an Irish Catholic in the adaptation, who was raped and impregnated by David, and then forced into an induced [[abortion]]. This breaks her and forces her to submit to David's will under the promise of [[heaven]] if she obeys his commands, or eternal damnation in \"the fires of [[hell]]\" if she refuses. Unlike the novel, she is saved from dying of a [[morphine]] overdose, thanks to Dr. Woodward's addiction to the drug leading him to steal some, with Poirot proving that David had set it up so that she would be an addict herself out of guilt, and try to kill herself as a result of her own guilty actions.\n* Kathy repeatedly harasses Eileen with anonymous phone calls, in which she calls her \"whore\", \"slut\", \"bitch\" and \"bigamist\", an event that does not occur in the novel. In addition, she becomes Adela's sister: Lionel is no longer a member of the Cloade family, despite a mistake in the adaptation's credits that refer him to be so; he is instead renamed as Lionel Woodward, and introduced as such by Kathy when she visits Poirot at the beginning of the adaptation.\n* After David is denounced for his crimes in the Stag Inn, he threatens to blow it all up with everyone inside it, but reveals this to be nothing more than a cruel joke as there is no dynamite inside, after being talked into sparing everyone by Lynn; the event which does not occur in the novel.\n* Lynn does not marry Rowley towards the end. Instead, after David is hanged, she leaves England to head for Africa, stating in a letter to Poirot that despite everything, she is still in love with him.\n\nThis story was adapted for television in the episode ''Le flux et le reflux'' [The Ebb and the Flow] in the French series ''[[Les Petits Meurtres d'Agatha Christie]]'', the eighth episode in the first series, first airing 15 April 2011. [[Antoine Dul\u00e9ry]] was Superintendent Larosi\u00e8re, and Marius Colucci was his assistant, Lampion. The adaptation was written by Anne Giafferi and Murielle Magellan, and directed by Sylvie Simon.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1763687/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_wr#writers/ |title=Les petits meurtres d'Agatha Christie: Le flux et le reflux (2011) |work=IMDb}}</ref> The plot is essentially the same, but set in a chateau in France, where the extended family of Capitaine Delarive lives. He marries late in life to a younger woman, and brings her and her brother back to France. There is a fire, he is killed. He has not revised his will after his marriage, so his widow inherits his wealth. The denouement is announced by Larosi\u00e8re, who gets back on the case once he overcomes his grief for his good friend Delarive. The woman put forth as his wife surviving the fire was a maid, and the man who claimed to be her brother, was not her brother, and he killed the maid.

A few days after arriving in London with his new wife, his London home is bombed, killing all but two people. One survivor is Gordon's brother-in-law, David Hunter, and the other is his new wife, Rosaleen Cloade. Gordon did not write a new will upon arrival, and his existing will is invalidated by the marriage. Rosaleen inherits Gordon's fortune. A day or so later, during another raid, Poirot sits in a shelter with people from the Concordia club in London and listens to a story about Major Porter's friend Robert Underhay in Africa, about his unhappy marriage and that Underhay may not be dead, told after reading out the news that Gordon Cloade, the second husband of Underhay's widow, was killed by enemy action.\n\nThe death of Gordon Cloade brings unexpected change to his siblings and their families. Gordon gave them capital to start a venture, to handle unexpected expenses, encouraged them not to save, and promised his fortune would be split among them when he died.\n\n==Plot summary==\nIn spring 1946, Lynn Marchmont, a [[Wren (Royal Navy)|Wren]] during the war, settles again in her mother\u2019s home in the village of Warmsley Vale in peacetime, at first happy to be home, then finding life dull. She has been engaged to farmer Rowley Cloade since before the war.\n\nDavid guards his sister and her fortune. Mrs Marchmont gets up the courage to ask Rosaleen for five hundred pounds when David is away, and Rosaleen writes a check. David angrily turns down a request from Frances Cloade, whose family is in desperate need of money.\n\nA man calling himself Enoch Arden arrives at the village inn The Stag, and attempts to blackmail David by saying he knows how to find Rosaleen's first husband, Robert Underhay. Their conversation is overheard by the landlady, who tells Rowley Cloade. A few days later, a maid finds Arden's body in his room with his head smashed in. That same day, David was down from London. He met Lynn on his dash to catch the last train to London, and evidently telephoned her from the London flat shortly after 11 pm, arguing first that he loves her and then that he cannot be good for her. As the murder is believed to have happened before 9 pm, he had enough opportunity and motive and he is arrested.\n\nRowley Cloade appeals to the detective Hercule Poirot to find the true identity of the dead man. Poirot asks Major Porter. Rosaleen sees the body and says she does not know the man at all. At the inquest, Porter says that Arden was indeed Robert Underhay, and the coroner's jury votes against advice to believe him, voting willful murder by David. The estate will revert to the Cloades, if the jury's decision holds, as it means Rosaleen's second marriage was not valid.\n\nPoirot talks to people in the village, including Mrs Leadbetter, a guest at the inn who saw a hussy, a heavily made up woman wearing slacks and an orange scarf, enter the room assigned to the dead man after 10 pm on the fateful evening. As the police believe that David was on the train to London at that time, they let him go, and look more seriously at women. Poirot learns how the death occurred, with a fall on the marble fender of the fireplace. He proposes it was accidental death, not intentional murder.\n\nLynn is falling in love with David. Major Porter commits suicide in London but leaves no note. Poirot realises from a photo at the home of Frances Cloade that Arden was related to her; she admits Arden was Charles Trenton, her second cousin. She came up with the plan to blackmail Rosaleen after hearing Major Porter's story about Underhay. This explains Arden's true identity, but nothing else. Frances denies bribing Major Porter.\n\nWhen Poirot and Lynn visit Rosaleen at home, the maid realizes she does not respond. Poirot sees that Rosaleen has died in her sleep. The doctor identifies the harmless sleeping powder she took, at her bedside table. Superintendent Spence, the investigating officer, suggests that she was the murderer. Rosaleen died from too much morphine; where did she get it?\n\nLynn tells Rowley that she wishes to marry David Hunter and he explodes in anger. Rowley is strangling Lynn when Poirot enters the house, and Rowley stops. David arrives shortly, and Poirot explains everything. Rowley visited Arden, and seeing the resemblance to Frances, reacted angrily to the deception. Punched by Rowley, Arden fell against the marble fireplace fender and died. Rowley saw the opportunity to incriminate David. He smashed in Arden's head with fire tongs and left David's lighter at the scene. Rowley persuaded Porter to give the false identification by offering him money. Then Rowley employed Poirot, who would be sure to go to Porter. Porter's guilt led him to commit suicide, leaving a note that Rowley destroyed. David was about to pay the blackmail to Arden; upon discovering Arden's body, David ran for the late train but missed it. David then backtracked to The Stag, disguised himself as a woman, and played out the scene, heard by Mrs Leadbetter, which established the later time of death. Then he called Rosaleen, who placed a call to Lynn that was delivered by the operator but then cut off. A minute later, David called Lynn from the local train station, giving her the impression that he was calling from London. He returned to London on the early morning milk train the next day.\n\nOf the three deaths, Poirot says one is accidental, one is a suicide, and one is murder. The true murder victim was Rosaleen. The woman known as Rosaleen was not David Hunter's sister; his sister was killed and the housemaid Eileen Corrigan had survived the bombing. Poirot sent to Ireland for a photo of Eileen, which explained the truth of what happened during the war. David persuaded her to be Rosaleen. Now he could kill this accomplice with a morphine pill and marry Lynn, whom he loved. Poirot knows all these details but only some of them are known to the police. Rowley feels guilty about the deaths of Trenton and Porter. The police focus on David killing Rosaleen/Eileen, and proving all of that case. After a while, Lynn returns to Rowley, realizing she does love him, especially after his show of force. Life will not be dull with him.\n\n==Characters==\n* [[Hercule Poirot]]: Belgian detective who lives in London.\n* Superintendent Spence: investigating officer.\n* Sergeant Graves: Spence's assistant.\n* Rosaleen Cloade: twice widowed while in her early 20s; formerly Mrs Robert Underhay.\n* David Hunter: Rosaleen's brother.

The quotation is given in full as the [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] to the novel.\n\n==Literary significance and reception==\n\nNo review of this book appeared in the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]''.\n\nFor once, Maurice Richardson, in his review of the 21 November 1948 issue of ''[[The Observer]]'' was slightly unimpressed: \"Agatha Christie has, if not a whole day off, at least part of the afternoon. The killing of the blackmailing Enoch Arden, who puts up at the local to harry the already embarrassed Cloade family, the murder that follows, and Poirot's doubly twisted solution are ingenious enough, but the characterisation is a little below par. The quintessential zest, the sense of well-being which goes to make up that Christie feeling, is missing.\"<ref name=Richardson1948>{{cite news |last=Richardson |first=Maurice |newspaper=The Observer |date=21 November 1948 |page=3 |title=Review of Taken at the Flood}}</ref>\n\nAn unnamed reviewer in the ''[[Toronto Star|Toronto Daily Star]]'' of 10 April 1948 said, \"Hercule Poirot, whose eggshaped cranium is crammed with lively gray cells, proves himself a bit of a mug before he sorts out all the details of [Enoch Arden's] death and other even more baffling mysteries. But he does it with all the acumen that has endeared him to Agatha Christie fans. Fantastic and topping.\"<ref name=Star1948>{{cite news |newspaper=Toronto Daily Star |date=10 April 1948 |page=27 |title=Review}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Barnard]] summarised the plot of the novel as an \"Elderly man married to a glamorous nitwit of dubious social background [which] is a common plot-element in Christie. Here she is widowed (in an air-raid \u2013 this is one of the few Christies anchored to an actual time), and burdened by financially insatiable relatives, both of blood and in-law. But who exactly is dead, and who isn't? And who is what they seem, and who isn't?\" His commentary is favorable on the title, more cryptic on the novel itself, as he said it was a \"Compulsive reworking of [[Tennyson]]ian and Christian themes, and pretty high up in the range of classic titles.\"<ref name=Barnard1990>{{cite book |last=Barnard |first=Robert |title=A Talent to Deceive \u2013 an appreciation of Agatha Christie |edition=Revised |page=206 |publisher=Fontana Books |year=1990 |isbn=0-00-637474-3}}</ref> \n\n==References to other works==\n\nThe false alibi used by the murderer of a witness sighting the missed train smoke was a partial re-use of a plot device used by Christie in the 1925 short story ''[[The Mysterious Mr. Quin#The Sign in the Sky|The Sign in the Sky]]'', later published in the 1930 collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr. Quin]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:Taken at the Flood First Edition Cover 1948.jpg|right|thumb|Dustjacket illustration of the UK First Edition (Book was first published in the US)]]\n* 1948, Dodd Mead and Company (New York), March 1948, Hardcover, 242 pp\n* 1948, Collins Crime Club (London), November 1948, Hardcover, 192 pp\n* 1949, [[Pocket Books]] (New York), Paperback\n* 1955, [[Dell Books]], Paperback, 224 pp\n* 1961, Fontana Books (Imprint of [[HarperCollins]]), Paperback, 192 pp\n* 1965, [[Pan Books]], Paperback, 204 pp\n* 1971, Ulverscroft [[Large-print]] Edition, Hardcover, 386 pp {{ISBN|0-85456-084-X}}\n* 2006, Audio Partners, narrator Hugh Fraser, {{ISBN| 978-1-57270-533-3}}\n* 2016, William Morrow & Company (USA edition), Hardcover {{ISBN|978-0-06-257342-1}}\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===Television===\n\nA television film was produced in 2006 with [[David Suchet]] as Poirot in the [[ITV Network|ITV]] series ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot]]''. The cast included [[Elliot Cowan]] as David Hunter, [[Eva Birthistle]] as Rosaleen, [[Celia Imrie]] as Kathy Cloade, [[Jenny Agutter]] as Adela Marchmont and [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] as Dr. Lionel Woodward. The film made several significant changes to the plot:\n\n* Like almost all episodes of the TV series, the adaptation shifts the setting to the late 1930s.\n* David's motive is modified in the adaption, upgrading him from a simple murderer, to that of a mass murderer. In the adaptation, the deaths of Gordon Cloade, Rosaleen Turner, and the entire Cloade estate that is present with them, are assumed to be the result of an apparent gas explosion, but Poirot later investigates this, and reveals in his denouement that the explosion was caused by dynamite that David had planted in the house, who sought revenge against his sister for marrying Gordon and excluding her brother as her \"[[Incest|first love]]\". Whereas in the novel, there is no mentioning of incest. He and his accomplice, Eileen Corrigan, who were present in the house at the time, took shelter in the basement once the explosives had been planted, and then emerged from the ruins afterwards.\n* Eileen's involvement is significantly changed - She is an Irish Catholic in the adaptation, who was raped and impregnated by David, and then forced into an induced [[abortion]]. This breaks her and forces her to submit to David's will under the promise of [[heaven]] if she obeys his commands, or eternal damnation in \"the fires of [[hell]]\" if she refuses. Unlike the novel, she is saved from dying of a [[morphine]] overdose, thanks to Dr. Woodward's addiction to the drug leading him to steal some, with Poirot proving that David had set it up so that she would be an addict herself out of guilt, and try to kill herself as a result of her own guilty actions.\n* Kathy repeatedly harasses Eileen with anonymous phone calls, in which she calls her \"whore\", \"slut\", \"bitch\" and \"bigamist\", an event that does not occur in the novel. In addition, she becomes Adela's sister: Lionel is no longer a member of the Cloade family, despite a mistake in the adaptation's credits that refer him to be so; he is instead renamed as Lionel Woodward, and introduced as such by Kathy when she visits Poirot at the beginning of the adaptation.\n* After David is denounced for his crimes in the Stag Inn, he threatens to blow it all up with everyone inside it, but reveals this to be nothing more than a cruel joke as there is no dynamite inside, after being talked into sparing everyone by Lynn; the event which does not occur in the novel.\n* Lynn does not marry Rowley towards the end. Instead, after David is hanged, she leaves England to head for Africa, stating in a letter to Poirot that despite everything, she is still in love with him.\n\nThis story was adapted for television in the episode ''Le flux et le reflux'' [The Ebb and the Flow] in the French series ''[[Les Petits Meurtres d'Agatha Christie]]'', the eighth episode in the first series, first airing 15 April 2011. [[Antoine Dul\u00e9ry]] was Superintendent Larosi\u00e8re, and Marius Colucci was his assistant, Lampion. The adaptation was written by Anne Giafferi and Murielle Magellan, and directed by Sylvie Simon.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1763687/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_wr#writers/ |title=Les petits meurtres d'Agatha Christie: Le flux et le reflux (2011) |work=IMDb}}</ref> The plot is essentially the same, but set in a chateau in France, where the extended family of Capitaine Delarive lives. He marries late in life to a younger woman, and brings her and her brother back to France. There is a fire, he is killed. He has not revised his will after his marriage, so his widow inherits his wealth. The denouement is announced by Larosi\u00e8re, who gets back on the case once he overcomes his grief for his good friend Delarive. The woman put forth as his wife surviving the fire was a maid, and the man who claimed to be her brother, was not her brother, and he killed the maid. There is a suicide and an accidental death, as well.\n\n===Radio===\n\n[[John Moffatt (actor)|John Moffatt]] played Poirot in the 2004 BBC Radio 4 adaptation of the novel.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.agathachristie.com/christies-work/stories/taken-at-the-flood/213 ''Taken at the Flood''] at the official Agatha Christie website\n*{{IMDb title|id= 0478227|title=Taken at the Flood (2006)}}\n\n{{Hercule Poirot}}\n{{Agatha Christie}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Taken At The Flood}}\n[[Category:1948 British novels]]\n[[Category:Hercule Poirot novels]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1946]]\n[[Category:Dodd, Mead and Company books]]\n[[Category:Novels adapted into television programs]]\n[[Category:British novels adapted into films]]\n[[Category:Novels set in the 1940s]]\n", "name_user": "Ira Leviton", "label": "safe", "comment": "Deleted a duplicate \"the\".", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taken_at_the_Flood"}

The '''history of geodesy''' began in pre-scientific antiquity and blossomed during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].\n\nEarly ideas about the figure of the Earth held the Earth to be flat (see [[flat Earth]]), and the heavens a physical dome spanning over it. Two early arguments for a spherical Earth were that lunar eclipses were seen as circular shadows which could only be caused by a spherical Earth, and that [[Polaris]] is seen lower in the sky as one travels South.\n\n==Hellenic world==\nThe [[Ancient Greece|early Greeks]], in their speculation and theorizing, ranged from the flat disc advocated by [[Homer]] to the spherical body postulated by [[Pythagoras]]. Pythagoras's idea was supported later by [[Aristotle]].<ref>Aristotle [[On the Heavens]], Book II 298 B</ref>  Pythagoras was a mathematician and to him the most perfect figure was a [[sphere]].  He reasoned that the gods would create a perfect figure and therefore the Earth was created to be spherical in shape.  [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], an early Greek philosopher, believed strongly that the Earth was [[rectangular]] in shape.\n\nSince the spherical shape was the most widely supported during the Greek Era, efforts to determine its size followed. Aristotle reported that mathematicians had calculated the circumference of the Earth (which is slightly over 40,000&nbsp;km) to be 400,000 stadia (between 62,800 and 74,000&nbsp;km or 46,250 and 39,250&nbsp;mi) while [[Archimedes]] stated an upper bound of 3,000,000 stadia (483,000&nbsp;km or 300,000&nbsp;mi) using the Hellenic [[stadia (length)|stadion]] which scholars generally take to be 185 meters or {{frac|9}} of a [[geographical mile]].\n\n===Hellenistic world===\nIn Egypt, a Greek scholar and philosopher, [[Eratosthenes]] (276 BCE \u2013 195 BCE) measured [[Earth's circumference]] with great precision.<ref name=\"russo273277\">{{cite book |last=Russo |first=Lucio |author-link=Lucio Russo |date=2004 |title=The Forgotten Revolution |url= |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer|page=273-277}}</ref> He estimated that the meridian has a length of 252,000 [[Stadion (unit)|stadia]], with an error on the real value between -2.4% and +0.8% (assuming a value for the stadion between 155 and 160 metres).<ref name=\"russo273277\" /> Eratosthenes described his technique in a book entitled ''On the measure of the Earth'', which has not been preserved.\n\n[[File:Eratostene--Calcolo Raggio Terrestre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Measure of Earth's circumference according to Cleomedes' simplified version, based on the wrong assumption that [[Syene]] is on the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and on the same meridian as [[Alexandria]]]]\n\nEratosthenes' method to calculate the [[Earth's circumference]] has been lost; what has been preserved is the simplified version described by [[Cleomedes]] to popularise the discovery.<ref>Cleomedes, ''Caelestia'', i.7.49-52.</ref> Cleomedes invites his reader to consider two Egyptian cities, [[Alexandria]] and [[Syene]], modern [[Assuan]]:\n# Cleomedes assumes that the distance between Syene and Alexandria was 5,000 [[Stadion (unit)|stadia]] (a figure that was checked yearly by professional [[bematist]]s, ''mensores regii'');<ref>Martianus Capella, ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'', VI.598.</ref> \n# he assumes the simplified (but false) hypothesis that Syene was precisely on the [[Tropic of Cancer]], saying that at [[Solar noon|local noon]] on the summer [[solstice]] the Sun was directly overhead;\n# he assumes the simplified (but false) hypothesis that Syene and Alexandria are on the same meridian.\n\nUnder the previous assumptions, says Cleomedes, you can measure the Sun's angle of elevation at noon of the summer solstice in Alexandria, by using a vertical rod (a [[gnomon]]) of known length and measuring the length of its shadow on the ground; it is then possible to calculated the angle of the Sun's rays, which he claims to be about 7\u00b0, or 1/50th the circumference of a circle. Taking the Earth as spherical, the Earth's circumference would be fifty times the distance between Alexandria and Syene, that is 250,000 stadia. Since 1 Egyptian stadium is equal to 157.5 metres, the result is 39,375&nbsp;km, which is 1.4% less than the real number, 39,941&nbsp;km.\n\nEratosthenes' method was actually more complicated, as stated by the same Cleomedes, whose purpose was to present a simplified version of the one described in Eratosthenes' book. The method was based on several [[surveying]] trips conducted by professional [[bematist]]s, whose job was to precisely measure the extent of the territory of Egypt for agricultural and taxation-related purposes.<ref name=\"russo273277\">{{cite book |last=Russo |first=Lucio |author-link=Lucio Russo |date=2004 |title=The Forgotten Revolution |url= |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer|page=273-277}}</ref> Furthermore, the fact that Eratosthenes' measure corresponds precisely to 252,000 stadia might be intentional, since it is a number that can be divided by all natural numbers from 1 to 10: some historians believe that Eratosthenes changed from the 250,000 value written by Cleomedes to this new value to simplify calculations;<ref>{{cite journal |first=Dennis |last=Rawlins |title=The Erathostenes-Strabo Nile Map.

He noted that the star [[Canopus]] was hidden from view in most parts of Greece but that it just grazed the horizon at Rhodes. Posidonius is supposed to have measured the angular elevation of Canopus at Alexandria and determined that the angle was 1/48 of circle. He used a distance from Alexandria to Rhodes, 5000 stadia, and so he computed the Earth's circumference in stadia as 48 times 5000 = 240,000.<ref>Cleomedes 1.10</ref> Some scholars see these results as luckily semi-accurate due to cancellation of errors. But since the Canopus observations are both mistaken by over a degree, the \"experiment\" may be not much more than a recycling of Eratosthenes's numbers, while altering 1/50 to the correct 1/48 of a circle. Later, either he or a follower appears to have altered the base distance to agree with Eratosthenes's Alexandria-to-Rhodes figure of 3750 stadia since Posidonius' final circumference was 180,000 stadia, which equals 48\u00d73750 stadia.<ref>Strabo 2.2.2, 2.5.24; D.Rawlins, [http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#gkpz Contributions]</ref> The 180,000 stadia circumference of Posidonius is suspiciously close to that which results from another method of measuring the earth, by timing ocean sunsets from different heights, a method which is inaccurate due to horizontal [[atmospheric refraction]].\n\nThe above mentioned larger and smaller sizes of the Earth were those used by [[Claudius Ptolemy]] at different times, 252,000 stadia in his ''[[Almagest]]'' and 180,000 stadia in his later ''[[Geographia]]''. His mid-career conversion resulted in the latter work's systematic exaggeration of degree longitudes in the Mediterranean by a factor close to the ratio of the two seriously differing sizes discussed here, which indicates that the conventional size of the earth was what changed, not the stadion.<ref>D.Rawlins (2007). \"[http://dioi.org/gad.htm#fftg Investigations of the ''Geographical Directory'' 1979\u20132007] \"; [http://dioi.org/vols/w61.pdf DIO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306232751/http://dioi.org/vols/w61.pdf |date=2008-03-06 }}, volume 6, number 1, page 11, note 47, 1996.</ref>\n\n== Ancient India ==\nThe Indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] (AD 476\u2013550) was a pioneer of [[Indian astronomy|mathematical astronomy]].

Gitika, Ganitha (mathematics), Kalakriya (reckoning of time) and Gola ([[celestial sphere]]).

[[Jacques Cassini]] later continued Picard's arc ([[Paris meridian]] arc) northward to [[Dunkirk, France|Dunkirk]] and southward to the [[France\u2013Spain border|Spanish border]]. Cassini divided the measured arc into two parts, one northward from [[Paris]], another southward. When he computed the length of a degree from both chains, he found that the length of one degree of [[latitude]] in the northern part of the chain was shorter than that in the southern part (see illustration).\n\n[[Image:CASSINIS' ELLIPSOID; HUYGEN'S THEORETICAL ELLIPSOID.GIF|thumb|right|Cassini's ellipsoid; Huygens' theoretical ellipsoid]]\n\nThis result, if correct, meant that the earth was not a sphere, but a [[spheroid|prolate spheroid]] (taller than wide).  However, this contradicted computations by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Christiaan Huygens]]. In 1659, [[Christiaan Huygens]] was the first to derive the now standard formula for the [[centripetal force]] in his work ''De vi centrifuga''. The formula played a central role in [[classical mechanics]] and became known as the second of [[Newton's laws of motion]].

One expedition (1736\u201337) under [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] was sent to [[Me\u00e4nmaa#French Geodesic Mission|Torne Valley]] (near the Earth's northern pole).

Some thought that the base of the metric system could be attacked by pointing out some errors that crept into the measurement of the two French scientists. M\u00e9chain had even noticed an inaccuracy he did not dare to admit. That is why from 1861 to 1866, Antoine Yvon Villarceau checked the geodesic op\u00e9rations in eight points of the meridian arc. Some of the errors in the operations of Delambre and M\u00e9chain were corrected. In 1866, at the conference of the [[International Association of Geodesy]] in [[Neuch\u00e2tel]] [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]] announced Spain's contribution to the measurement of the French meridian arc. In 1870, [[Fran\u00e7ois Perrier (French Army officer)|Fran\u00e7ois Perrier]] was in charge of resuming the triangulation between Dunkirk and Barcelona. This new survey of the [[Paris meridian|Paris meridian arc]], named West Europe-Africa Meridian-arc by [[Alexander Ross Clarke]], was undertaken in France and in [[Algeria]] under the direction of [[Fran\u00e7ois Perrier (French Army officer)|Fran\u00e7ois Perrier]] from 1870 to his death in 1888. Jean-Antonin-L\u00e9on Bassot completed the task in 1896. According to the calculations made at the central bureau of the international association on the great meridian arc extending from the Shetland Islands, through Great Britain, France and Spain to El Aghuat in Algeria, the Earth equatorial radius was 6377935 metres, the ellipticity being assumed as 1/299.15.\n\nIn 1860, the Russian Government at the instance of Otto Sturves invited the Governments of Belgium, France, Prussia and England to connect their triangulations in order to measure the length of an arc of parallel in latitude 52\u00b0 and to test the accuracy of the figure and dimensions of the Earth, as derived from the measurements of arc of meridian. In order to combine the measurements, it was necessary to compare the geodetic standards of length used in the different countries. The British Government invited those of France, Belgium, Prussia, Russia, India, Australia, Austria, Spain, United States and Cape of Good Hope to send their standards to the [[Ordnance Survey]] office in Southampton. Notably the standards of France, Spain and United States were based on the metric system, whereas those of Prussia, Belgium and Russia where calibrated against the [[toise]], of which the oldest physical representative was the Toise of Peru. The Toise of Peru had been constructed in 1735 for [[Pierre Bouguer|Bouguer]] and [[Charles Marie de La Condamine|De La Condamine]] as their standard of reference in the [[French Geodesic Mission]], conducted in actual Ecuador from 1735 to 1744 in collaboration with the Spanish officers [[Jorge Juan y Santacilia|Jorge Juan]] and [[Antonio de Ulloa]].\n\n[[Alexander Ross Clarke]] and Henry James published the first results of the standards' comparisons in 1867. The same year Russia, Spain and Portugal joined the \"[[International Association of Geodesy|Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung]]\" and the General Conference of the association proposed the [[metre]] as a uniform length standard for the Arc Measurement and recommended the establishment of an [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]].\n\nThe [[International Association of Geodesy|Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung]] decided the creation of an international geodetic standard at the General Conference held in Paris in 1875. The [[Metre Convention]] was signed in 1875 in Paris and the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] was created under the supervision of the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]]. The first president of the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] was the Spanish geodesist [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]]. He also was the president of the Permanent Commission of the \"[[International Association of Geodesy|Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung]]\" from 1874 to 1886. In 1886 the association changed name for the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]] and [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]] was reelected as president. He remained in this position until his death in 1891. During this period the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]] gained worldwide importance with the joining of United States, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Japan. In 1883 the General Conference of the \"[[International Association of Geodesy|Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung]]\" proposed to select the [[Prime meridian (Greenwich)|Greenwich meridian]] as the prime meridian in the hope that [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] would accede to the [[Metre Convention]]. Moreover according to the calculations made at the central bureau of the international association on the West Europe-Africa Meridian-arc the meridian of Greenwich was nearer the mean than that of Paris.<ref>Alexander Ross Clarke and Friedrich Robert Helmert {{Citation|title=Earth, Figure of the|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Earth,_Figure_of_the|encyclopedia=1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|volume=8|access-date=2019-11-11}} p. 811</ref>\n\n=== Geodesy and mathematics ===\nMost of the relevant theories were derived by the German geodesist [[Friedrich Robert Helmert]] in his famous books ''Die mathematischen und physikalischen Theorieen der h\u00f6heren Geod\u00e4sie'', Einleitung und 1.

The '''history of geodesy''' began in pre-scientific antiquity and blossomed during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].\n\nEarly ideas about the figure of the Earth held the Earth to be flat (see [[flat Earth]]), and the heavens a physical dome spanning over it. Two early arguments for a spherical Earth were that lunar eclipses were seen as circular shadows which could only be caused by a spherical Earth, and that [[Polaris]] is seen lower in the sky as one travels South.\n\n==Hellenic world==\nThe [[Ancient Greece|early Greeks]], in their speculation and theorizing, ranged from the flat disc advocated by [[Homer]] to the spherical body postulated by [[Pythagoras]]. Pythagoras's idea was supported later by [[Aristotle]].<ref>Aristotle [[On the Heavens]], Book II 298 B</ref>  Pythagoras was a mathematician and to him the most perfect figure was a [[sphere]].  He reasoned that the gods would create a perfect figure and therefore the Earth was created to be spherical in shape.  [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], an early Greek philosopher, believed strongly that the Earth was [[rectangular]] in shape.\n\nSince the spherical shape was the most widely supported during the Greek Era, efforts to determine its size followed. Aristotle reported that mathematicians had calculated the circumference of the Earth (which is slightly over 40,000&nbsp;km) to be 400,000 stadia (between 62,800 and 74,000&nbsp;km or 46,250 and 39,250&nbsp;mi) while [[Archimedes]] stated an upper bound of 3,000,000 stadia (483,000&nbsp;km or 300,000&nbsp;mi) using the Hellenic [[stadia (length)|stadion]] which scholars generally take to be 185 meters or {{frac|9}} of a [[geographical mile]].\n\n===Hellenistic world===\nIn Egypt, a Greek scholar and philosopher, [[Eratosthenes]] (276 BCE \u2013 195 BCE) measured [[Earth's circumference]] with great precision.<ref name=\"russo273277\">{{cite book |last=Russo |first=Lucio |author-link=Lucio Russo |date=2004 |title=The Forgotten Revolution |url= |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer|page=273-277}}</ref> He estimated that the meridian has a length of 252,000 [[Stadion (unit)|stadia]], with an error on the real value between -2.4% and +0.8% (assuming a value for the stadion between 155 and 160 metres).<ref name=\"russo273277\" /> Eratosthenes described his technique in a book entitled ''On the measure of the Earth'', which has not been preserved.\n\n[[File:Eratostene--Calcolo Raggio Terrestre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Measure of Earth's circumference according to Cleomedes' simplyfied version, based on the wrong assumption that [[Syene]] is on the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and on the same meridian as [[Alexandria]]]]\n\nEratosthenes' method to calculate the [[Earth's circumference]] has been lost; what has been preserved is the simplified version described by [[Cleomedes]] to popularise the discovery.<ref>Cleomedes, ''Caelestia'', i.7.49-52.</ref> Cleomedes invites his reader to consider two Egyptian cities, [[Alexandria]] and [[Syene]], modern [[Assuan]]:\n# Cleomedes assumes that the distance between Syene and Alexandria was 5,000 [[Stadion (unit)|stadia]] (a figure that was checked yearly by professional [[bematist]]s, ''mensores regii'');<ref>Martianus Capella, ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'', VI.598.</ref> \n# he assumes the simplified (but false) hypothesis that Syene was precisely on the [[Tropic of Cancer]], saying that at [[Solar noon|local noon]] on the summer [[solstice]] the Sun was directly overhead;\n# he assumes the simplified (but false) hypothesis that Syene and Alexandria are on the same meridian.\n\nUnder the previous assumptions, says Cleomedes, you can measure the Sun's angle of elevation at noon of the summer solstice in Alexandria, by using a vertical rod (a [[gnomon]]) of known length and measuring the length of its shadow on the ground; it is then possible to calculated the angle of the Sun's rays, which he claims to be about 7\u00b0, or 1/50th the circumference of a circle. Taking the Earth as spherical, the Earth's circumference would be fifty times the distance between Alexandria and Syene, that is 250,000 stadia. Since 1 Egyptian stadium is equal to 157.5 metres, the result is 39,375&nbsp;km, which is 1.4% less than the real number, 39,941&nbsp;km.\n\nEratosthenes' method was actually more complicated, as stated by the same Cleomedes, whose purpose was to present a simplified version of the one described in Eratosthenes' book. The method was based on several [[surveying]] trips conducted by professional [[bematist]]s, whose job was to precisely measure the extent of the territory of Egypt for agricultural and taxation-related purposes.<ref name=\"russo273277\">{{cite book |last=Russo |first=Lucio |author-link=Lucio Russo |date=2004 |title=The Forgotten Revolution |url= |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer|page=273-277}}</ref> Furthermore, the fact that Eratosthenes' measure corresponds precisely to 252,000 stadia might be intentional, since it is a number that can be divided by all natural numbers from 1 to 10: some historians believe that Eratosthenes changed from the 250,000 value written by Cleomedes to this new value to simply calculations;<ref>{{cite journal |first=Dennis |last=Rawlins |title=The Erathostenes-Strabo Nile Map.

He noted that the star [[Canopus]] was hidden from view in most parts of Greece but that it just grazed the horizon at Rhodes. Posidonius is supposed to have measured the angular elevation of Canopus at Alexandria and determined that the angle was 1/48 of circle. He used a distance from Alexandria to Rhodes, 5000 stadia, and so he computed the Earth's circumference in stadia as 48 times 5000 = 240,000.<ref>Cleomedes 1.10</ref> Some scholars see these results as luckily semi-accurate due to cancellation of errors. But since the Canopus observations are both mistaken by over a degree, the \"experiment\" may be not much more than a recycling of Eratosthenes's numbers, while altering 1/50 to the correct 1/48 of a circle. Later, either he or a follower appears to have altered the base distance to agree with Eratosthenes's Alexandria-to-Rhodes figure of 3750 stadia since Posidonius' final circumference was 180,000 stadia, which equals 48\u00d73750 stadia.<ref>Strabo 2.2.2, 2.5.24; D.Rawlins, [http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#gkpz Contributions]</ref> The 180,000 stadia circumference of Posidonius is suspiciously close to that which results from another method of measuring the earth, by timing ocean sunsets from different heights, a method which is inaccurate due to horizontal [[atmospheric refraction]].\n\nThe above mentioned larger and smaller sizes of the Earth were those used by [[Claudius Ptolemy]] at different times, 252,000 stadia in his ''[[Almagest]]'' and 180,000 stadia in his later ''[[Geographia]]''. His mid-career conversion resulted in the latter work's systematic exaggeration of degree longitudes in the Mediterranean by a factor close to the ratio of the two seriously differing sizes discussed here, which indicates that the conventional size of the earth was what changed, not the stadion.<ref>D.Rawlins (2007). \"[http://dioi.org/gad.htm#fftg Investigations of the ''Geographical Directory'' 1979\u20132007] \"; [http://dioi.org/vols/w61.pdf DIO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306232751/http://dioi.org/vols/w61.pdf |date=2008-03-06 }}, volume 6, number 1, page 11, note 47, 1996.</ref>\n\n== Ancient India ==\nThe Indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] (AD 476\u2013550) was a pioneer of [[Indian astronomy|mathematical astronomy]]. He describes the earth as being spherical and that it rotates on its axis, among other things in his work [[\u0100ryabha\u1e6d\u012bya]]. Aryabhatiya is divided into four sections. Gitika, Ganitha (mathematics), Kalakriya (reckoning of time) and Gola ([[celestial sphere]]).

He gave the circumference of the earth as 4967 yojanas and its diameter as 1581+1/24 yojanas.

During that period the Flemish cartographer, [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]], made successive reductions in the size of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and all of Europe which had the effect of increasing the size of the earth.\n\n== Early modern period ==\nThe invention of the [[telescope]] and the [[theodolite]] and the development of [[logarithm table]]s allowed exact [[triangulation]] and [[grade measurement]].\n\n===Europe===\n\nIn the [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian era]], scholars discussed Macrobius's view of the ''[[antipodes]]''. One of them, the Irish monk [[Saint Dungal|Dungal]], asserted that the tropical gap between our habitable region and the other habitable region to the south was smaller than Macrobius had believed.<ref>Bruce S.

He measured a [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]] using wooden rods, a telescope (for his [[Angle#Angles in geography and astronomy|angular measurements]]), and [[logarithms]] (for computation). [[Jacques Cassini]] later continued Picard's arc ([[Paris meridian]] arc) northward to [[Dunkirk, France|Dunkirk]] and southward to the [[France\u2013Spain border|Spanish border]]. Cassini divided the measured arc into two parts, one northward from [[Paris]], another southward. When he computed the length of a degree from both chains, he found that the length of one degree of [[latitude]] in the northern part of the chain was shorter than that in the southern part (see illustration).\n\n[[Image:CASSINIS' ELLIPSOID; HUYGEN'S THEORETICAL ELLIPSOID.GIF|thumb|right|Cassini's ellipsoid; Huygens' theoretical ellipsoid]]\n\nThis result, if correct, meant that the earth was not a sphere, but a [[spheroid|prolate spheroid]] (taller than wide).  However, this contradicted computations by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Christiaan Huygens]]. In 1659, [[Christiaan Huygens]] was the first to derive the now standard formula for the [[centripetal force]] in his work ''De vi centrifuga''. The formula played a central role in [[classical mechanics]] and became known as the second of [[Newton's laws of motion]]. Newton's [[Law of universal gravitation|theory of gravitation]] combined with the rotation of the Earth predicted the Earth to be an [[spheroid|oblate spheroid]] (wider than tall), with a [[flattening]] of 1:230.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Full meridian of glory : perilous adventures in the competition to measure the Earth|last=Paul.|first=Murdin|date=2009|publisher=Copernicus Books/Springer|isbn=9780387755342|location=New York|pages=39\u201375|oclc=314175913}}</ref>\n\nThe issue could be settled by measuring, for a number of points on earth, the relationship between their distance (in north-south direction) and the angles between their [[zenith]]s. On an oblate Earth, the [[meridional]] [[Meridian arc|distance corresponding to one degree of latitude]] will grow toward the poles, as can be [[Meridian arc#Meridian distance on the ellipsoid|demonstrated mathematically]].\n\nThe [[French Academy of Sciences]] dispatched two expeditions. One expedition (1736\u201337) under [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] was sent to [[Me\u00e4nmaa#French Geodesic Mission|Torne Valley]] (near the Earth's northern pole). The [[French Geodesic Mission|second mission]] (1735\u201344) under [[Pierre Bouguer]] was sent to what is modern-day [[Ecuador]], near the equator. Their measurements demonstrated an oblate Earth, with a flattening of 1:210. This approximation to the true shape of the Earth became the new [[reference ellipsoid]].\n\nIn 1787 the first precise trigonometric survey to be undertaken within Britain was the [[Anglo-French Survey (1784\u20131790)|Anglo-French Survey]]. Its purpose was to link the Greenwich and Paris' observatories.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Jean-Pierre|last2=McConnell|first2=Anita|date=2008-12-20|title=Joining the observatories of Paris and Greenwich|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society|language=en|volume=62|issue=4|pages=355\u2013372|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2008.0029|issn=0035-9149|doi-access=free}}</ref> The survey is very significant as the forerunner of the work of the [[Ordnance Survey]] which was founded in 1791, one year after [[William Roy]]'s death.\n\nBetween 1792 and 1798 [[Pierre M\u00e9chain]] and [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|Jean-Baptiste Delambre]] surveyed the [[Paris meridian]] arc between [[Dunkirk]] and [[Barcelona]].

Some thought that the base of the metric system could be attacked by pointing out some errors that crept into the measurement of the two French scientists. M\u00e9chain had even noticed an inaccuracy he did not dare to admit. That is why from 1861 to 1866, Antoine Yvon Villarceau checked the geodesic op\u00e9rations in eight points of the meridian arc. Some of the errors in the operations of Delambre and M\u00e9chain were corrected. In 1866, at the conference of the [[International Association of Geodesy]] in [[Neuch\u00e2tel]] [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]] announced Spain's contribution to the measurement of the French meridian arc. In 1870, [[Fran\u00e7ois Perrier (French Army officer)|Fran\u00e7ois Perrier]] was in charge of resuming the triangulation between Dunkirk and Barcelona. This new survey of the [[Paris meridian|Paris meridian arc]], named West Europe-Africa Meridian-arc by [[Alexander Ross Clarke]], was undertaken in France and in [[Algeria]] under the direction of [[Fran\u00e7ois Perrier (French Army officer)|Fran\u00e7ois Perrier]] from 1870 to his death in 1888. Jean-Antonin-L\u00e9on Bassot completed the task in 1896. According to the calculations made at the central bureau of the international association on the great meridian arc extending from the Shetland Islands, through Great Britain, France and Spain to El Aghuat in Algeria, the Earth equatorial radius was 6377935 metres, the ellipticity being assumed as 1/299.15.\n\nIn 1860, the Russian Government at the instance of Otto Sturves invited the Governments of Belgium, France, Prussia and England to connect their triangulations in order to measure the length of an arc of parallel in latitude 52\u00b0 and to test the accuracy of the figure and dimensions of the Earth, as derived from the measurements of arc of meridian. In order to combine the measurements, it was necessary to compare the geodetic standards of length used in the different countries. The British Government invited those of France, Belgium, Prussia, Russia, India, Australia, Austria, Spain, United States and Cape of Good Hope to send their standards to the [[Ordnance Survey]] office in Southampton. Notably the standards of France, Spain and United States were based on the metric system, whereas those of Prussia, Belgium and Russia where calibrated against the [[toise]], of which the oldest physical representative was the Toise of Peru. The Toise of Peru had been constructed in 1735 for [[Pierre Bouguer|Bouguer]] and [[Charles Marie de La Condamine|De La Condamine]] as their standard of reference in the [[French Geodesic Mission]], conducted in actual Ecuador from 1735 to 1744 in collaboration with the Spanish officers [[Jorge Juan y Santacilia|Jorge Juan]] and [[Antonio de Ulloa]].\n\n[[Alexander Ross Clarke]] and Henry James published the first results of the standards' comparisons in 1867. The same year Russia, Spain and Portugal joined the \"[[International Association of Geodesy|Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung]]\" and the General Conference of the association proposed the [[metre]] as a uniform length standard for the Arc Measurement and recommended the establishment of an [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]].\n\nThe [[International Association of Geodesy|Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung]] decided the creation of an international geodetic standard at the General Conference held in Paris in 1875. The [[Metre Convention]] was signed in 1875 in Paris and the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] was created under the supervision of the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]]. The first president of the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] was the Spanish geodesist [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]]. He also was the president of the Permanent Commission of the \"[[International Association of Geodesy|Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung]]\" from 1874 to 1886. In 1886 the association changed name for the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]] and [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]] was reelected as president. He remained in this position until his death in 1891. During this period the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]] gained worldwide importance with the joining of United States, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Japan. In 1883 the General Conference of the \"[[International Association of Geodesy|Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung]]\" proposed to select the [[Prime meridian (Greenwich)|Greenwich meridian]] as the prime meridian in the hope that [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] would accede to the [[Metre Convention]]. Moreover according to the calculations made at the central bureau of the international association on the West Europe-Africa Meridian-arc the meridian of Greenwich was nearer the mean than that of Paris.<ref>Alexander Ross Clarke and Friedrich Robert Helmert {{Citation|title=Earth, Figure of the|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Earth,_Figure_of_the|encyclopedia=1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|volume=8|access-date=2019-11-11}} p. 811</ref>\n\n=== Geodesy and mathematics ===\nMost of the relevant theories were derived by the German geodesist [[Friedrich Robert Helmert]] in his famous books ''Die mathematischen und physikalischen Theorieen der h\u00f6heren Geod\u00e4sie'', Einleitung und 1.
