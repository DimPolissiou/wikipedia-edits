Lee Jin-jin of Kyunghyang Newspaper responded to the reports, stating that \"(G)I-dle's music video was filmed in a series of scenes expressing various surreal situations. On the other hand, FKA Twig's music video has a specific story of 'Crash' and 'Emergency' as the main character falls into an unknown world among pole dances, and the content and settings themselves are different.\" Soon afterwards, the controversy attracted the attention of FKA Twigs' fans causing the group's foreign fans to disproof and plunge into plagiarism claims, and continuing the arguments in overseas social networking services than domestic.
