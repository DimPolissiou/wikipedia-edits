The remaining five editions of the Men's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won each by a different country including [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] and the defunct [[FR Yugoslavia men's national volleyball team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nGold medals are less evenly distributed in women's volleyball than in men's; the fourteen editions of the Women's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won by only five different countries: [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] and the former [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of Olympic volleyball can be traced back to the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], where volleyball was played as part of an American sports demonstration event. Its addition to the Olympic program, however, was given only after [[World War II]], with the foundation of the [[FIVB]] and of some of the continental confederations. In 1957, a special tournament was held during the [[List of IOC meetings|53rd IOC session]] in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], to support such request. The competition was a success, and the sport was officially introduced in [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The Olympic Committee initially dropped volleyball for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]], meeting protests.<ref>{{cite book|title=Black Belt Vol. 2, No. 2|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|year=Mar 1964|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ|quote=Sone Kaminaga black belt.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ/page/n26 27]}}</ref>\n\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament was originally a simple competition, whose format paralleled the one still employed in the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|World Cup]]: all teams played against each other team and then were ranked by number of wins, set average and point average. One disadvantage of this round-robin system is that medal winners could be determined before the end of the games, making the audience lose interest in the outcome of the remaining matches.\n\nTo cope with this situation, the competition was split into two phases: a \"final round\" was introduced, consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. Since its creation in [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]], this new system has become the standard for the volleyball Olympic tournament, and is usually referred to as the \"Olympic format\".\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has grown steadily since 1964. Since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], both men's and women's indoor events count 12 participant nations. Each of the five continental volleyball confederations has at least one affiliated national federation involved in the Olympic Games.\n\n===Events===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Bronze in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and silver in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] won gold in [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. In [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], the introduction of a new offensive skill, the back row attack, helped [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] win the competition over the Soviets in a very tight five-setter.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], many of the strongest teams in men's volleyball belonged to the [[Eastern Bloc]], so the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]] did not have as great an effect on these events as it had on the women's. The Soviet Union collected their third Olympic gold medal with a 3\u20131 victory over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]]. With a Soviet-led boycott in [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] confirmed their new volleyball leadership in the Western World by sweeping smoothly over [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] at the finals. In that edition a minor nation, [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], won their first medal, but Italy would rise to prominence in volleyball in later decades. A long-awaited confrontation between the US and Soviet volleyball teams came in the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] final: powerplayers [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]] pushed the United States to a second gold medal setting the issue in favor of the Americans.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], Brazil upset favorites [[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], and Italy for their first Olympic championship. Runners-up Netherlands, with [[Ron Zwerver]] and [[Olof van der Meulen]], came back in the [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|following edition]] for a five-set win over Italy. In spite of their success in other major volleyball competitions in the 1990s, Italy did not fare well at the Olympics. After winning bronze in Atlanta, [[Serbia and Montenegro men's national volleyball team|Serbia and Montenegro]], led by [[Vladimir Grbi\u0107|Vladimir]] and [[Nikola Grbi\u0107]], beat [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] at the final in [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] to secure the gold (in 1996 and 2000 they played under the name [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]).\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], Brazil beat Italy in the final, adding a second gold medal to their record and confirming their role as the men's volleyball superpowers of the 2000s. In [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], United States beat Brazil in the final, winning their third gold medal. Russia won the bronze for the second time by defeating Italy. In the [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] final, Russia came back from a 0\u20132 set deficit, not letting the Brazilians take advantage of any of their 2 match points in the third set. [[Dmitriy Muserskiy]] scored 31 points, which is an Olympic Games record in a final. Italy defeated Bulgaria and took Bronze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivb.org/EN/Olympics/London2012/viewPressRelease.asp?No=36516&Language=en|title=FIVB - London 2012 Olympic Games|author=|date=|website=www.fivb.org|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter coming up short in the previous two editions of the Olympics as runners-up, the Brazilians captured their third gold medal in the history of the competition playing home in [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] after their straight-set victory against Italy in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/brazil-make-triumphant-return-to-the-top?id=64552|title=Brazil make triumphant return to the top of the podium|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> The United States pulled off a comeback from a 0\u20132 deficit to claim the bronze medal with a victory over Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/usa-grab-mens-bronze-with-fantastic-comeback?id=64545|title=USA grab men's bronze with fantastic comeback|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nGold medals appear to be more evenly distributed in men's volleyball than in women's: former Soviet Union (three titles), United States (three) and Brazil (three) are the only teams to have won the tournament more than once. The remaining four editions were won each by a different country. Despite being a major force in men's volleyball since the 1990s, Italy are still the only volleyball powerhouses that lack a gold medal at the Olympic Games.\n\n===Women's winners===\n[[File:Women's Volleyball semifinals - 6.jpg|thumbnail|right|Women's volleyball semifinals match between [[United States women's national volleyball team|USA]] and [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].]]\n\nThe opening edition of the volleyball Olympic tournament, in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]], was won by the host nation [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]]. There followed two victories in a row by the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] and [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] were expected to get their first gold after beating Japan in the 1975 Pre-Olympic Games, but Japan came back again in [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] for one last Olympic gold before losing their status of women's volleyball superpowers.\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott]] of the [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Games]] left many strong volleyball nations like Japan and South Korea out of the games. As a result, the Soviet Union easily secured a third Olympic gold medal. In [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[Eastern bloc]] was, in its turn, boycotting the games, and the Soviet Union did not participate. As a result, host nation [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] won its first medals in volleyball, losing the finals to [[China women's national volleyball team|China]]. With eastern and western nations again involved in the Olympics, the Soviet Union obtained a remarkable victory over [[Peru women's national volleyball team|Peru]] after trailing 0\u20132 in [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988's]] marking one of the most dramatic female matches of the 20th century. The 1988 games were, however, boycotted by Cuba.\n\n[[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] saw a new force go down in Olympic history: organized under the name [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]], the nations of the former Soviet Union that chose to form a combined team easily reached the gold medal game, but did not resist the power play of the young, rising Cuban squad. Led by superstars [[Mireya Luis]] and [[Regla Torres]], Cuba would eventually set the record for consecutive wins in the Olympic Games by also taking the gold in [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] against China and [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]], respectively.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the winners were once again China. Second were Russia who beat [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in a very tough and dramatic semifinal match after being down 1\u20132, 19\u201324 in the fourth set.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], Brazil finally won the gold, beating the United States in the final and losing only one set in the competition. China were awarded the bronze by beating Cuba. After a troubled start, Brazil secured the double gold in [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] after beating the United States once again in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/summer/2012/volleyball/story/_/id/8259676/2012-london-olympics-brazil-shocks-us-women-volleyball-gold|title=Brazil wins women's volleyball gold|work=espn.go.com|accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref> Japan won the bronze medal after defeating South Korea.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]], home team Brazil were favorites to once again win the title, thus equalling Cuba's three consecutive gold medals between 1992 and 2000. After winning all of their preliminary round matches without dropping a set, the team was, however, stunned by a young Chinese squad in a tiebreaker in the quarterfinals. China went on to win the title, their third in Olympic history, by beating [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]] in four sets in the gold medal match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/china-crowned-champions-in-rio-de-janeiro?id=64539|title=China crowned champions in Rio de Janeiro|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> In the process, [[Lang Ping]] became the first person to win a gold medal as a player in Los Angeles 1984 and repeat the feat now as a coach in Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/lang-ping-becomes-first-person-in-volleyball?id=64550|title=Lang Ping became the first person in volleyball to win Olympic gold as player and coach|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> China also became the first team to win the Olympics after losing three matches in the preliminary round.

Despite becoming a women's volleyball powerhouse in the 21st century, United States still lack an Olympic gold.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament has a very stable competition formula. The following rules apply:\n\n; Qualification\n\n*Twelve teams participate in each event.\n*Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n*Two teams qualify through the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|Men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] (this number was reduced from three prior to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]).\n*Five teams qualify as winners of continental qualification tournaments.\n*The four remaining berths are decided in world qualification tournaments.\n\n; Competition format\n\n*For the first phase, called qualification round, teams are ranked by the [[FIVB World Rankings]] and then divided in two pools of six teams using the [[serpentine system]]. The host nation is always ranked 1.\n*At the qualification round, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. Top four teams in each pool advance, the remaining two leave the competition.\n*At the second phase, usually called final round, teams play quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.\n*For the final round, matches are organized according to the results obtained in the qualification round. Let the top four teams in each pool be A1, A2, A3, A4 (group A); and B1, B2, B3, B4 (group B). Quarterfinals would then be: A1xB4; A2xB3; A3xB2; A4xB1.\n*Winners of quarterfinals play semifinals as follows: (A1/B4) x (A3/B2) ; (A2/B3) x (A4xB1).\n*At the finals, winners of semifinals play for the gold, and losers for the bronze.\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Men's

women consistently since [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]].\n\n[[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], and the former [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], are the only teams to win multiple gold medals at the men's tournament since its introduction. The remaining five editions of the Men's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won each by a different country including [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] and the defunct [[FR Yugoslavia men's national volleyball team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nGold medals are less evenly distributed in women's volleyball than in men's; the fourteen editions of the Women's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won by only five different countries: [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] and the former [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of Olympic volleyball can be traced back to the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], where volleyball was played as part of an American sports demonstration event. Its addition to the Olympic program, however, was given only after [[World War II]], with the foundation of the [[FIVB]] and of some of the continental confederations. In 1957, a special tournament was held during the [[List of IOC meetings|53rd IOC session]] in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], to support such request. The competition was a success, and the sport was officially introduced in [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The Olympic Committee initially dropped volleyball for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]], meeting protests.<ref>{{cite book|title=Black Belt Vol. 2, No. 2|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|year=Mar 1964|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ|quote=Sone Kaminaga black belt.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ/page/n26 27]}}</ref>\n\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament was originally a simple competition, whose format paralleled the one still employed in the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|World Cup]]: all teams played against each other team and then were ranked by number of wins, set average and point average. One disadvantage of this round-robin system is that medal winners could be determined before the end of the games, making the audience lose interest in the outcome of the remaining matches.\n\nTo cope with this situation, the competition was split into two phases: a \"final round\" was introduced, consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. Since its creation in [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]], this new system has become the standard for the volleyball Olympic tournament, and is usually referred to as the \"Olympic format\".\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has grown steadily since 1964. Since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], both men's and women's indoor events count 12 participant nations. Each of the five continental volleyball confederations has at least one affiliated national federation involved in the Olympic Games.\n\n===Events===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Bronze in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and silver in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] won gold in [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. In [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], the introduction of a new offensive skill, the back row attack, helped [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] win the competition over the Soviets in a very tight five-setter.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], many of the strongest teams in men's volleyball belonged to the [[Eastern Bloc]], so the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]] did not have as great an effect on these events as it had on the women's. The Soviet Union collected their third Olympic gold medal with a 3\u20131 victory over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]]. With a Soviet-led boycott in [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] confirmed their new volleyball leadership in the Western World by sweeping smoothly over [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] at the finals. In that edition a minor nation, [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], won their first medal, but Italy would rise to prominence in volleyball in later decades. A long-awaited confrontation between the US and Soviet volleyball teams came in the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] final: powerplayers [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]] pushed the United States to a second gold medal setting the issue in favor of the Americans.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], Brazil upset favorites [[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], and Italy for their first Olympic championship. Runners-up Netherlands, with [[Ron Zwerver]] and [[Olof van der Meulen]], came back in the [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|following edition]] for a five-set win over Italy. In spite of their success in other major volleyball competitions in the 1990s, Italy did not fare well at the Olympics. After winning bronze in Atlanta, [[Serbia and Montenegro men's national volleyball team|Serbia and Montenegro]], led by [[Vladimir Grbi\u0107|Vladimir]] and [[Nikola Grbi\u0107]], beat [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] at the final in [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] to secure the gold (in 1996 and 2000 they played under the name [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]).\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], Brazil beat Italy in the final, adding a second gold medal to their record and confirming their role as the men's volleyball superpowers of the 2000s. In [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], United States beat Brazil in the final, winning their third gold medal. Russia won the bronze for the second time by defeating Italy. In the [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] final, Russia came back from a 0\u20132 set deficit, not letting the Brazilians take advantage of any of their 2 match points in the third set. [[Dmitriy Muserskiy]] scored 31 points, which is an Olympic Games record in a final. Italy defeated Bulgaria and took Bronze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivb.org/EN/Olympics/London2012/viewPressRelease.asp?No=36516&Language=en|title=FIVB - London 2012 Olympic Games|author=|date=|website=www.fivb.org|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter coming up short in the previous two editions of the Olympics as runners-up, the Brazilians captured their third gold medal in the history of the competition playing home in [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] after their straight-set victory against Italy in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/brazil-make-triumphant-return-to-the-top?id=64552|title=Brazil make triumphant return to the top of the podium|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> The United States pulled off a comeback from a 0\u20132 deficit to claim the bronze medal with a victory over Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/usa-grab-mens-bronze-with-fantastic-comeback?id=64545|title=USA grab men's bronze with fantastic comeback|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nGold medals appear to be more evenly distributed in men's volleyball than in women's: former Soviet Union (three titles), United States (three) and Brazil (three) are the only teams to have won the tournament more than once. The remaining four editions were won each by a different country. Despite being a major force in men's volleyball since the 1990s, Italy are still the only volleyball powerhouses that lack a gold medal at the Olympic Games.\n\n===Women's winners===\n[[File:Women's Volleyball semifinals - 6.jpg|thumbnail|right|Women's volleyball semifinals match between [[United States women's national volleyball team|USA]] and [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].]]\n\nThe opening edition of the volleyball Olympic tournament, in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]], was won by the host nation [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]]. There followed two victories in a row by the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] and [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] were expected to get their first gold after beating Japan in the 1975 Pre-Olympic Games, but Japan came back again in [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] for one last Olympic gold before losing their status of women's volleyball superpowers.\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott]] of the [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Games]] left many strong volleyball nations like Japan and South Korea out of the games. As a result, the Soviet Union easily secured a third Olympic gold medal. In [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[Eastern bloc]] was, in its turn, boycotting the games, and the Soviet Union did not participate. As a result, host nation [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] won its first medals in volleyball, losing the finals to [[China women's national volleyball team|China]]. With eastern and western nations again involved in the Olympics, the Soviet Union obtained a remarkable victory over [[Peru women's national volleyball team|Peru]] after trailing 0\u20132 in [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988's]] marking one of the most dramatic female matches of the 20th century. The 1988 games were, however, boycotted by Cuba.\n\n[[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] saw a new force go down in Olympic history: organized under the name [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]], the nations of the former Soviet Union that chose to form a combined team easily reached the gold medal game, but did not resist the power play of the young, rising Cuban squad. Led by superstars [[Mireya Luis]] and [[Regla Torres]], Cuba would eventually set the record for consecutive wins in the Olympic Games by also taking the gold in [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] against China and [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]], respectively.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the winners were once again China. Second were Russia who beat [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in a very tough and dramatic semifinal match after being down 1\u20132, 19\u201324 in the fourth set.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], Brazil finally won the gold, beating the United States in the final and losing only one set in the competition. China were awarded the bronze by beating Cuba.

After winning all of their preliminary round matches without dropping a set, the team was, however, stunned by a young Chinese squad in a tiebreaker in the quarterfinals.

Despite becoming a women's volleyball powerhouse in the 21st century, United States still lack an Olympic gold.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament has a very stable competition formula. The following rules apply:\n\n; Qualification\n\n*Twelve teams participate in each event.\n*Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n*Two teams qualify through the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|Men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] (this number was reduced from three prior to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]).\n*Five teams qualify as winners of continental qualification tournaments.\n*The four remaining berths are decided in world qualification tournaments.\n\n; Competition format\n\n*For the first phase, called qualification round, teams are ranked by the [[FIVB World Rankings]] and then divided in two pools of six teams using the [[serpentine system]]. The host nation is always ranked 1.\n*At the qualification round, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. Top four teams in each pool advance, the remaining two leave the competition.\n*At the second phase, usually called final round, teams play quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.\n*For the final round, matches are organized according to the results obtained in the qualification round. Let the top four teams in each pool be A1, A2, A3, A4 (group A); and B1, B2, B3, B4 (group B). Quarterfinals would then be: A1xB4; A2xB3; A3xB2; A4xB1.\n*Winners of quarterfinals play semifinals as follows: (A1/B4) x (A3/B2) ; (A2/B3) x (A4xB1).\n*At the finals, winners of semifinals play for the gold, and losers for the bronze.\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Men's

The island of Taiwan has an area of {{convert|35808|km2|sp=us}}, with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third, where its highly urbanised population is concentrated. [[Taipei]] is the capital and largest metropolitan area. Other major cities include [[Kaohsiung]], [[Taichung]], [[Tainan]] and [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan]]. With 23.7&nbsp;million inhabitants, Taiwan is among the most densely populated states, and is the most populous state and largest [[gross domestic product|economy]] that is not a member of the [[United Nations]] (UN).\n\n[[Taiwanese indigenous peoples]] settled the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]] around 6,000 years ago. In the 17th century, [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch rule]] opened the island to mass [[Han people|Han]] immigration. After the brief [[Kingdom of Tungning]] in parts of the southern and western areas of the island, the island [[Taiwan under Qing rule|was annexed in 1683]] by the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and [[Treaty of Shimonoseki|ceded]] to the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1895. Following the [[surrender of Japan]] in 1945, the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], which had [[Xinhai Revolution|overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911]], [[Retrocession Day|took control of Taiwan]] on behalf of the [[World War II Allies]]. The resumption of the [[Chinese Civil War]] led to the loss of the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China]] and the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|flight of the ROC government to Taiwan]] in 1949. Although the ROC government continued to claim to be the [[Two Chinas|legitimate representative of China]], since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to [[free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan and numerous smaller islands]]. In the early 1960s, Taiwan entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialisation called the \"[[Taiwan Miracle]]\". In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the ROC transitioned from a one-party military dictatorship to a multi-party democracy with a [[semi-presidential system]].\n\nTaiwan's export-oriented industrial economy is the [[list of countries by GDP (nominal)|21st-largest]] in the world, with major contributions from steel, machinery, electronics and chemicals manufacturing.

The main island, known historically as ''Formosa'', makes up 99% of the [[Free area of the Republic of China|area controlled by the ROC]], measuring {{convert|35808|km2|sqmi|0}} and lying some {{convert|180|km|mi|0}} across the [[Taiwan Strait]] from the southeastern coast of [[mainland China]]. The [[East China Sea]] lies to its north, the [[Philippine Sea]] to its east, the [[Luzon Strait]] directly to its south and the [[South China Sea]] to its southwest. [[List of islands of Taiwan|Smaller islands]] include a number in the Taiwan Strait including the [[Penghu]] archipelago, the [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands]] near the Chinese coast, and some of the [[South China Sea Islands]].\n\nThe main island is a tilted [[fault block]], characterized by the contrast between the eastern two-thirds, consisting mostly of five rugged mountain ranges parallel to the east coast, and the flat to gently rolling plains of the western third, where the majority of Taiwan's population reside. There are several peaks over 3,500&nbsp;m, the highest being [[Yu Shan]] at {{cvt|3952|m|ft}}, making Taiwan the world's [[List of islands by highest point|fourth-highest island]]. The tectonic boundary that formed these ranges is still active, and the island experiences many earthquakes, a few of them highly destructive. There are also many active [[submarine volcano]]es in the Taiwan Straits.\n\nThe eastern mountains are heavily forested and home to a diverse range of wildlife, while land use in the western and northern lowlands is intensive.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map TWN present.svg|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate classification of Taiwan.]]\n\nTaiwan lies on the [[Tropic of Cancer]], and its general [[climate]] is marine [[tropical climate|tropical]].<ref name=\"cia-factbook\">{{cite web |title=Taiwan |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tw.html |work=The World Factbook |publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency |access-date=6 May 2019}}</ref> The northern and central regions are subtropical, whereas the south is tropical and the mountainous regions are temperate.{{sfnp|Exec.

The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of [[terrane]]s, mostly old [[island arc]]s which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]]. These have been further uplifted as a result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was [[subduction|subducted]] beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust under Taiwan more buoyant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/~anderson/taiwan/tai_index.html |title=Geology of Taiwan |publisher=University of Arizona |accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe east and south of Taiwan are a complex system of belts formed by, and part of the zone of, active collision between the North Luzon Trough portion of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc]] and South China, where accreted portions of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc|Luzon Arc]] and Luzon forearc form the [[Haian Range|eastern Coastal Range]] and parallel inland [[Huatung Valley|Longitudinal Valley]] of Taiwan respectively.<ref>Clift, Schouten and Draut (2003) in ''Intra-Oceanic Subduction Systems: Tectonic and Magmatic Processes'', {{ISBN|1-86239-147-5}} p84\u201386</ref>\n\nThe major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between the various [[terrane]]s.

On 21 September 1999, a 7.3 quake known as the \"[[1999 Jiji (Chichi) earthquake|921 earthquake]]\" killed more than 2,400 people.

Political reforms beginning in the late 1970s and continuing through the early 1990s transformed into a multiparty democracy. Since the lifting of martial law, the Republic of China has democratized and reformed, suspending constitutional components that were originally meant for the whole of China. This process of amendment continues. In 2000, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[President of the Republic of China|presidency]], ending KMT's continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of constitutional reform to the popular ballot.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan assembly passes changes |date=7 June 2005 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4616043.stm}}</ref>\n[[File:Presidential Building, Taiwan (0747).JPG|thumb|Taiwan's popularly elected president resides in the [[Presidential Office Building, Taipei]], originally built in the Japanese era for colonial governors.]]\nThe [[head of state]] and commander-in-chief of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|armed forces]] is the [[President of the Republic of China|president]], who is elected by popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the vice-president.

Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese who immigrated from mainland China in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences, as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratic reforms and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for ''de jure'' Taiwan independence.<ref name=\"power-shift\">{{Cite book|last=Shambaugh|first=David L.|title=Power shift|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|pages=179\u2013183 |isbn=978-0-520-24570-9}}</ref> The [[pan-green]] camp supports a distinct Taiwanese identity, while the [[pan-blue]] camp supports a Chinese identity only.<ref name=\"panblue-reunif-chineseid\" /> The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20081230ho.html|title=No sign of a 'peace agreement'|last=Okazaki|first=Hisahiko|date=30 December 2008|newspaper=Japan Times|accessdate=15 July 2009|quote=For one thing, I believe there is recognition that the awareness of Taiwanese identity is now irreversible.

Local governments are responsible or partially responsible for social services, education, urban planning, public construction, water management, environmental protection, transport and public safety.\n\nThere are three types of subnational divisions: special municipalities, cities and counties. Special municipalities and cities are further divided into districts for local administration. Counties are further divided into townships and county-administered cities which have government offices with elected leaders and local councils, which share responsibilities with the county. Some divisions are indigenous divisions which have different degrees of autonomy to standard ones. In addition, districts, cities and townships are further divided into villages and neighbourhoods.\n\n==Military==\n{{Main|Republic of China Armed Forces}}\n{{See also|Republic of China Military Academy}}\n\n[[File:Thunderbolt 2000 MLRS Side View 20111105a.jpg|thumb|[[Republic of China Army]] [[Thunderbolt-2000]]]]\nThe [[Republic of China Army]] takes its roots in the [[National Revolutionary Army]], which was established by [[Sun Yat-sen]] in 1925 in [[Guangdong]] with a goal of reunifying China under the Kuomintang. When the [[People's Liberation Army]] won the [[Chinese Civil War]], much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along with the government. It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army. Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army.\n\nToday, Taiwan maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as a defence to the constant threat of invasion by the [[People's Liberation Army]] using the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] as a pretext. This law authorizes the use of military force when certain conditions are met, such as a danger to mainlanders.<ref name=2004NatDefRpt />\n\nFrom 1949 to the 1970s, the primary mission of the Taiwanese military was to \"retake mainland China\" through [[Project National Glory]].

These efforts significantly slowed inflation.\n\nWhen the KMT government fled to Taiwan it brought millions of [[tael]]s (where 1&nbsp;tael = 37.5 g or ~1.2&nbsp;[[troy ounce|ozt]]) of gold and the foreign currency reserve of mainland China, which, according to the KMT, stabilized prices and reduced hyperinflation.<ref>{{cite web |date=6 April 2011 |title=Gold Shipped to Taiwan in 1949 Helped Stabilize ROC on Taiwan|url=http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&mnum=112&anum=9442|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927081949/http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&mnum=112&anum=9442|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 September 2011|newspaper=Kuomintang News Network|accessdate=14 June 2011}} Translated from {{cite news |author=\u738b\u9298\u7fa9 |date=5 April 2011 |script-title=zh:1949\u5e74\u904b\u53f0\u9ec3\u91d1 \u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u4fdd\u547d\u672c |newspaper=China Times |url=http://forums.chinatimes.com/report/goldfile/series-cnt0405ct02.htm |accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> Perhaps more importantly, as part of its retreat to Taiwan, the KMT brought the intellectual and business elites from mainland China.<ref>{{cite book | last =Roy | first =Denny | title =Taiwan: A Political History | url =https://archive.org/details/taiwan00denn | url-access =registration | publisher =Cornell University Press |year=2003 | location =Ithaca, NY | pages =[https://archive.org/details/taiwan00denn/page/76 76], 77 | isbn =978-0-8014-8805-4 }}</ref> The KMT government instituted many laws and [[land reform]]s that it had never effectively enacted on mainland China.

The island of Taiwan has an area of {{convert|35808|km2|sp=us}}, with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third, where its highly urbanised population is concentrated. [[Taipei]] is the capital and largest metropolitan area. Other major cities include [[Kaohsiung]], [[Taichung]], [[Tainan]] and [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan]]. With 23.7&nbsp;million inhabitants, Taiwan is among the most densely populated states, and is the most populous state and largest [[gross domestic product|economy]] that is not a member of the [[United Nations]] (UN).\n\n[[Taiwanese indigenous peoples]] settled the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]] around 6,000 years ago. In the 17th century, [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch rule]] opened the island to mass [[Han people|Han]] immigration. After the brief [[Kingdom of Tungning]] in parts of the southern and western areas of the island, the island [[Taiwan under Qing rule|was annexed in 1683]] by the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and [[Treaty of Shimonoseki|ceded]] to the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1895. Following the [[surrender of Japan]] in 1945, the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], which had [[Xinhai Revolution|overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911]], [[Retrocession Day|took control of Taiwan]] on behalf of the [[World War II Allies]]. The resumption of the [[Chinese Civil War]] led to the loss of the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China]] and the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|flight of the ROC government to Taiwan]] in 1949. Although the ROC government continued to claim to be the [[Two Chinas|legitimate representative of China]], since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to [[free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan and numerous smaller islands]]. In the early 1960s, Taiwan entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialisation called the \"[[Taiwan Miracle]]\". In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the ROC transitioned from a one-party military dictatorship to a multi-party democracy with a [[semi-presidential system]].\n\nTaiwan's export-oriented industrial economy is the [[list of countries by GDP (nominal)|21st-largest]] in the world, with major contributions from steel, machinery, electronics and chemicals manufacturing.

The main island, known historically as ''Formosa'', makes up 99% of the [[Free area of the Republic of China|area controlled by the ROC]], measuring {{convert|35808|km2|sqmi|0}} and lying some {{convert|180|km|mi|0}} across the [[Taiwan Strait]] from the southeastern coast of [[mainland China]]. The [[East China Sea]] lies to its north, the [[Philippine Sea]] to its east, the [[Luzon Strait]] directly to its south and the [[South China Sea]] to its southwest. [[List of islands of Taiwan|Smaller islands]] include a number in the Taiwan Strait including the [[Penghu]] archipelago, the [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands]] near the Chinese coast, and some of the [[South China Sea Islands]].\n\nThe main island is a tilted [[fault block]], characterized by the contrast between the eastern two-thirds, consisting mostly of five rugged mountain ranges parallel to the east coast, and the flat to gently rolling plains of the western third, where the majority of Taiwan's population reside. There are several peaks over 3,500&nbsp;m, the highest being [[Yu Shan]] at {{cvt|3952|m|ft}}, making Taiwan the world's [[List of islands by highest point|fourth-highest island]]. The tectonic boundary that formed these ranges is still active, and the island experiences many earthquakes, a few of them highly destructive. There are also many active [[submarine volcano]]es in the Taiwan Straits.\n\nThe eastern mountains are heavily forested and home to a diverse range of wildlife, while land use in the western and northern lowlands is intensive.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map TWN present.svg|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate classification of Taiwan.]]\n\nTaiwan lies on the [[Tropic of Cancer]], and its general [[climate]] is marine [[tropical climate|tropical]].<ref name=\"cia-factbook\">{{cite web |title=Taiwan |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tw.html |work=The World Factbook |publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency |access-date=6 May 2019}}</ref> The northern and central regions are subtropical, whereas the south is tropical and the mountainous regions are temperate.{{sfnp|Exec.

The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of [[terrane]]s, mostly old [[island arc]]s which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]]. These have been further uplifted as a result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was [[subduction|subducted]] beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust under Taiwan more buoyant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/~anderson/taiwan/tai_index.html |title=Geology of Taiwan |publisher=University of Arizona |accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe east and south of Taiwan are a complex system of belts formed by, and part of the zone of, active collision between the North Luzon Trough portion of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc]] and South China, where accreted portions of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc|Luzon Arc]] and Luzon forearc form the [[Haian Range|eastern Coastal Range]] and parallel inland [[Huatung Valley|Longitudinal Valley]] of Taiwan respectively.<ref>Clift, Schouten and Draut (2003) in ''Intra-Oceanic Subduction Systems: Tectonic and Magmatic Processes'', {{ISBN|1-86239-147-5}} p84\u201386</ref>\n\nThe major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between the various [[terrane]]s.

On 21 September 1999, a 7.3 quake known as the \"[[1999 Jiji (Chichi) earthquake|921 earthquake]]\" killed more than 2,400 people.

Political reforms beginning in the late 1970s and continuing through the early 1990s transformed into a multiparty democracy. Since the lifting of martial law, the Republic of China has democratized and reformed, suspending constitutional components that were originally meant for the whole of China. This process of amendment continues. In 2000, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[President of the Republic of China|presidency]], ending KMT's continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of constitutional reform to the popular ballot.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan assembly passes changes |date=7 June 2005 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4616043.stm}}</ref>\n[[File:Presidential Building, Taiwan (0747).JPG|thumb|Taiwan's popularly elected president resides in the [[Presidential Office Building, Taipei]], originally built in the Japanese era for colonial governors.]]\nThe [[head of state]] and commander-in-chief of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|armed forces]] is the [[President of the Republic of China|president]], who is elected by popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the vice-president.

Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese who immigrated from mainland China in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences, as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratic reforms and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for ''de jure'' Taiwan independence.<ref name=\"power-shift\">{{Cite book|last=Shambaugh|first=David L.|title=Power shift|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|pages=179\u2013183 |isbn=978-0-520-24570-9}}</ref> The [[pan-green]] camp supports a distinct Taiwanese identity, while the [[pan-blue]] camp supports a Chinese identity only.<ref name=\"panblue-reunif-chineseid\" /> The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20081230ho.html|title=No sign of a 'peace agreement'|last=Okazaki|first=Hisahiko|date=30 December 2008|newspaper=Japan Times|accessdate=15 July 2009|quote=For one thing, I believe there is recognition that the awareness of Taiwanese identity is now irreversible.

Local governments are responsible or partially responsible for social services, education, urban planning, public construction, water management, environmental protection, transport and public safety.\n\nThere are three types of subnational divisions: special municipalities, cities and counties. Special municipalities and cities are further divided into districts for local administration. Counties are further divided into townships and county-administered cities which have government offices with elected leaders and local councils, which share responsibilities with the county. Some divisions are indigenous divisions which have different degrees of autonomy to standard ones. In addition, districts, cities and townships are further divided into villages and neighbourhoods.\n\n==Military==\n{{Main|Republic of China Armed Forces}}\n{{See also|Republic of China Military Academy}}\n\n[[File:Thunderbolt 2000 MLRS Side View 20111105a.jpg|thumb|[[Republic of China Army]] [[Thunderbolt-2000]]]]\nThe [[Republic of China Army]] takes its roots in the [[National Revolutionary Army]], which was established by [[Sun Yat-sen]] in 1925 in [[Guangdong]] with a goal of reunifying China under the Kuomintang. When the [[People's Liberation Army]] won the [[Chinese Civil War]], much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along with the government. It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army. Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army.\n\nToday, Taiwan maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as a defence to the constant threat of invasion by the [[People's Liberation Army]] using the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] as a pretext. This law authorizes the use of military force when certain conditions are met, such as a danger to mainlanders.<ref name=2004NatDefRpt />\n\nFrom 1949 to the 1970s, the primary mission of the Taiwanese military was to \"retake mainland China\" through [[Project National Glory]].

These efforts significantly slowed inflation.\n\nWhen the KMT government fled to Taiwan it brought millions of [[tael]]s (where 1&nbsp;tael = 37.5 g or ~1.2&nbsp;[[troy ounce|ozt]]) of gold and the foreign currency reserve of mainland China, which, according to the KMT, stabilized prices and reduced hyperinflation.<ref>{{cite web |date=6 April 2011 |title=Gold Shipped to Taiwan in 1949 Helped Stabilize ROC on Taiwan|url=http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&mnum=112&anum=9442|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927081949/http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&mnum=112&anum=9442|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 September 2011|newspaper=Kuomintang News Network|accessdate=14 June 2011}} Translated from {{cite news |author=\u738b\u9298\u7fa9 |date=5 April 2011 |script-title=zh:1949\u5e74\u904b\u53f0\u9ec3\u91d1 \u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u4fdd\u547d\u672c |newspaper=China Times |url=http://forums.chinatimes.com/report/goldfile/series-cnt0405ct02.htm |accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> Perhaps more importantly, as part of its retreat to Taiwan, the KMT brought the intellectual and business elites from mainland China.<ref>{{cite book | last =Roy | first =Denny | title =Taiwan: A Political History | url =https://archive.org/details/taiwan00denn | url-access =registration | publisher =Cornell University Press |year=2003 | location =Ithaca, NY | pages =[https://archive.org/details/taiwan00denn/page/76 76], 77 | isbn =978-0-8014-8805-4 }}</ref> The KMT government instituted many laws and [[land reform]]s that it had never effectively enacted on mainland China.
