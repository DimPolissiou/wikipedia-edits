Such hospitals were intended for large-scale medical isolation and instituted through the acquisition of existing space, some even large-scale event venues and renovated colleges and universities.\n\nIn Wuhan, since the outbreak of the [[coronavirus disease 2019]], the general medical institutions and the newly-expanded pneumonia specialist hospital became overcrowded with just severely ill patients. Meanwhile, persons under voluntary family isolation could still infect family members and neighboring community members, impacting the use of medical resources and increasing the risk to epidemic control. Under such circumstances, the principle of centralised treatment of patients with mild symptoms was adopted for the control of infectious diseases. The [[Government of the People's Republic of China]] established 16 square-cabin hospitals in [[Wuhan]], [[Hubei]], providing a total of more than 20,000 beds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/2020-02/19/c_1125596243.htm|title=\u6b66\u6c49\u65b9\u8231\u533b\u9662\u589e\u81f312\u5bb6 \u8ba1\u5212\u542f\u7528\u5e8a\u4f4d\u8d85\u4e24\u4e07\u5f20-\u65b0\u534e\u7f51|website=www.xinhuanet.com|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Yu|first=Verna|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/18/senior-wuhan-doctor-dies-from-coronavirus-as-authorities-start-to-round-up-patients|title=Senior Wuhan doctor dies from coronavirus as authorities start to 'round up' patients|date=2020-02-18|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-03-30|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/coronavirus-wuhan-to-activate-one-more-temporary-hospital-with-3690-beds|title=Coronavirus: Wuhan to build 19 more makeshift hospitals as China struggles to contain epidemic|last=hermesauto|date=2020-02-21|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> As of March 10, 2020, all patients admitted to the square cabin hospital of Wuhan Wushan Hongshan Stadium were discharged.

Such hospitals were intended for large-scale medical isolation and instituted through the acquisition of existing space, some even large-scale event venues and renovated colleges and universities.\n\nIn Wuhan, since the outbreak of the [[coronavirus disease 2019]], the general medical institutions and the newly-expanded pneumonia specialist hospital became overcrowded with just severely ill patients. Meanwhile, persons under voluntary family isolation could still infect family members and neighboring community members, impacting the use of medical resources and increasing the risk to epidemic control. Under such circumstances, the principle of centralised treatment of patients with mild symptoms was adopted for the control of infectious diseases.

For instance, the town of [[Mologa]] was flooded for the purpose of constructing the [[Rybinsk Reservoir]] (then the largest artificial lake in the world). The construction of the [[Uglich Reservoir]] caused the flooding of several monasteries with buildings dating from the 15th and 16th centuries. In such cases the ecological and cultural damage often outbalanced any economic advantage.<ref>\"In all, Soviet dams flooded 2,600 villages and 165 cities, almost 78,000&nbsp;sq. km. \u2013 the area of Maryland, Delaware, Massachusetts, and New Jersey combined \u2013 including nearly 31,000&nbsp;sq. km. of agricultural land and 31,000&nbsp;sq. km. of forestland\".

The Volga was (and still is) a vital transport route between central Russia and the Caspian Sea, which provides access to the oil fields of the [[Apsheron Peninsula]].\n[[Hitler]] planned to use access to the oil fields of [[Azerbaijan]] to fuel future German conquests.

At the same time, Germany could permanently deny this transport route by the Soviet Union, hampering its access to oil and to supplies via the [[Persian Corridor]].\n\nFor this reason, many [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] military assaults were brought about in an attempt to remove the other side from the banks of the river.

Another Turkic group, the [[Nogais]], formerly inhabited the lower Volga steppes.\n\nThe Volga region is home to a German minority group, the [[Volga Germans]]. [[Catherine the Great]] had issued a Manifesto in 1763 inviting all foreigners to come and populate the region, offering them numerous incentives to do so. This was partly to develop the region but also to provide a buffer zone between the Russians and the [[Mongols]] to the East. Because of conditions in German territories, Germans responded in the largest numbers.

Thus, a left tributary to the Kama was named the ''[[Belaya River (Kama)|Aq Itil]]'' \"White Itil\" which unites with the [[Ufa River|''Kara Itil'']] \"Black Itil\" at the modern city of [[Ufa]].

The construction of the [[Uglich Reservoir]] caused the flooding of several monasteries with buildings dating from the 15th and 16th centuries.
