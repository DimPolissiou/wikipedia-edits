(Wallace had written to Fleming appealing for help in his case.)<ref name=james/> The two men initiated an investigation of the case, challenging the conclusions of the original investigations at Angola about the murder of guard Miller, and also raising questions about the conduct of the prisoners' original trials in 1972. [[Anita Roddick]], founder of the [[Body Shop]] and known for her humanitarian activism, learned about the case from Fleming and helped raise international awareness about the Angola Three.<ref name=james/>\n\n==Appeals and transfers==\n\nOn appeal, Woodfox's 1974 conviction for the murder of Miller was overturned in 1993, on the constitutional grounds of inadequate counsel at the first trial. The state quickly indicted Woodfox again that year, the result of a grand jury that was headed by a white foreman appointed by the court. In 1998 Woodfox was convicted a second time for the prison murder. His defense mounted another appeal.\n\nKing's 1973 conviction, on charges unrelated to Miller's murder, was overturned in 2001 on appeal. The court ordered a new trial. While the state had the option to dismiss the charges, it reindicted King and said it would retry him. Before going to trial, the prosecutor offered him a plea deal, with the sentences for the lower charges to be offset by the time he had already served. King took the plea in order to gain release after 29 years in solitary confinement, but he said that he was innocent of the charges. He was released in 2001, the first of the Angola 3 to gain freedom.\n\nIn 2000, the Angola Three filed a civil suit against the Louisiana Department of Corrections \"challenging the inhumane and increasingly pervasive practice of long-term solitary confinement\".<ref name=\"A3case\"/> They seek damages against the state Department of Corrections because of the adverse effects of extended time in solitary confinement. As of 2019, their case is still pending.<ref name=\"robertson\"/>\n\nWhile the men's civil suit and appeals of their cases were pending, in March 2008 Woodfox and Wallace were moved to a maximum-security dormitory at Angola. They had each been held for 36 years in solitary confinement. State Representative [[Cedric Richmond]] (D-New Orleans) (now a Congressman) was granted permission to visit them, which authorities rarely granted. He told an NPR reporter that he believed that they had been moved from solitary because of increasing political pressure about the case, as well as the men's civil suit against the state regarding solitary confinement.<ref name=\"sullivan\">[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89140779&ft=1&f=1001 Laura Sullivan, \"'Angola 2' Leave Solitary Cells in La. After 36 Years\"], NPR, 27 March 2008; accessed 12 March 2019</ref>\n\nWoodfox had two appeal hearings in federal district court (one in November 2008 and one in May 2010), which resulted in his second conviction being overturned and his being granted full [[habeas corpus]]. The rulings by the federal district court were overturned by the federal Fifth District Circuit Court of Appeals.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}{{clarify|reason=language makes it difficult to determine if the appeals were successful and were subsequently overturned, or whether the appeals were REJECTED, a totally different outcome|date=July 2014}}\n\nImmediately after Woodfox's first appeal hearing in November 2008, both men were moved out of the maximum-security dormitory, separated, and returned to solitary confinement. In March 2009 Wallace, along with a group of 15 inmates from Angola, was moved to [[Elayn Hunt Correctional Center]] and placed in a newly created closed-cell isolation tier. The state argues that this is not solitary confinement.\n\nIn November 2010, Woodfox was moved from Angola to [[David Wade Correctional Center]]. It is seven hours north of New Orleans and distant from his family and supporters.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nBoth Wallace and Woodfox, who had served past their original sentences for armed robbery, have allegedly suffered from a range of different medical issues\u2014some due in part to their reported conditions of confinement and their enforced sedentary lifestyle.  Prison officials had long maintained that the reason for keeping Wallace and Woodfox in solitary confinement was out of concern that they would instigate a [[prison uprising]] because of their belonging to the Black Panthers.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Kunzelman and Kevin McGill |agency=Associated Press |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/lawyer-angola-inmates-released-37061293 |title=Last of 'Angola Three' Inmates Released, Thanks Supporters |publisher=ABCnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2013 Wallace was diagnosed with advanced liver cancer. He had earlier been thought to have a stomach condition. Wallace's defense team had filed a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]],'' saying that he had not received a fair trial and was thus being held illegally by the state. In October 2013 federal district judge Brian A. Jackson ruled that Wallace had not received a fair trial because no women were included on his jury. Judge Jackson vacated the original grand jury indictment and ordered Wallace's immediate release. the original indictment was unconstitutional.<ref name=\"schwartz\"/> The state announced its intention to re-indict Wallace for Miller's murder, but he died on October 4, 2013, a few days after being released from jail.\n\nIn March 2013, a federal District Court judge in [[New Orleans]] overturned Woodfox's second (1998) conviction for the prison murder, ruling that it was based on racially discriminatory grounds because a white foreman had been appointed to the grand jury, and that this was part of a pattern of discriminatory practice found in the state. Louisiana Attorney General [[Buddy Caldwell|James Caldwell]] promised to appeal the District Court's decision, saying, \u201cWe feel confident that we will again prevail at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, if we do not, we are fully prepared and willing to retry this murderer again.\u201d<ref name=never/>\n\nOn November 20, 2014, a three-person panel of Fifth Circuit judges unanimously upheld the lower court's opinion that Woodfox's conviction had been secured through racially discriminatory means. The panel found that the selection of a white grand-jury foreperson in the 1993 indictment hearing prior to trial formed part of a discriminatory pattern in that area of Louisiana. Concluding that this action amounted to a violation of the US Constitution, the judges struck down Woodfox's conviction.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/>\n\nThe state of Louisiana refused to release Woodfox, pending their decision as to whether to pursue a new trial against him.

They had each been held for 36 years in solitary confinement. State Representative [[Cedric Richmond]] (D-New Orleans) (now a Congressman) was granted permission to visit them, which authorities rarely granted. He told an NPR reporter that he believed that they had been moved from solitary because of increasing political pressure about the case, as well as the men's civil suit against the state regarding solitary confinement.<ref name=\"sullivan\">[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89140779&ft=1&f=1001 Laura Sullivan, \"'Angola 2' Leave Solitary Cells in La.

The rulings by the federal district court were overturned by the federal Fifth District Circuit Court of Appeals.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}{{clarify|reason=language makes it difficult to determine if the appeals were successful and were subsequently overturned, or whether the appeals were REJECTED, a totally different outcome|date=July 2014}}\n\nImmediately after Woodfox's first appeal hearing in November 2008, both men were moved out of the maximum-security dormitory, separated, and returned to solitary confinement. In March 2009 Wallace, along with a group of 15 inmates from Angola, was moved to [[Elayn Hunt Correctional Center]] and placed in a newly created closed-cell isolation tier. The state argues that this is not solitary confinement.\n\nIn November 2010, Woodfox was moved from Angola to [[David Wade Correctional Center]]. It is seven hours north of New Orleans and distant from his family and supporters.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nBoth Wallace and Woodfox, who had served past their original sentences for armed robbery, have allegedly suffered from a range of different medical issues\u2014some due in part to their reported conditions of confinement and their enforced sedentary lifestyle.  Prison officials had long maintained that the reason for keeping Wallace and Woodfox in solitary confinement was out of concern that they would instigate a [[prison uprising]] because of their belonging to the Black Panthers.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Kunzelman and Kevin McGill |agency=Associated Press |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/lawyer-angola-inmates-released-37061293 |title=Last of 'Angola Three' Inmates Released, Thanks Supporters |publisher=ABCnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2013 Wallace was diagnosed with advanced liver cancer. He had earlier been thought to have a stomach condition. Wallace's defense team had filed a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]],'' saying that he had not received a fair trial and was thus being held illegally by the state. In October 2013 federal district judge Brian A. Jackson ruled that Wallace had not received a fair trial because no women were included on his jury. Judge Jackson vacated the original grand jury indictment and ordered Wallace's immediate release. the original indictment was unconstitutional.<ref name=\"schwartz\"/> The state announced its intention to re-indict Wallace for Miller's murder, but he died on October 4, 2013, a few days after being released from jail.\n\nIn March 2013, a federal District Court judge in [[New Orleans]] overturned Woodfox's second (1998) conviction for the prison murder, ruling that it was based on racially discriminatory grounds because a white foreman had been appointed to the grand jury, and that this was part of a pattern of discriminatory practice found in the state. Louisiana Attorney General [[Buddy Caldwell|James Caldwell]] promised to appeal the District Court's decision, saying, \u201cWe feel confident that we will again prevail at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, if we do not, we are fully prepared and willing to retry this murderer again.\u201d<ref name=never/>\n\nOn November 20, 2014, a three-person panel of Fifth Circuit judges unanimously upheld the lower court's opinion that Woodfox's conviction had been secured through racially discriminatory means. The panel found that the selection of a white grand-jury foreperson in the 1993 indictment hearing prior to trial formed part of a discriminatory pattern in that area of Louisiana. Concluding that this action amounted to a violation of the US Constitution, the judges struck down Woodfox's conviction.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/>\n\nThe state of Louisiana refused to release Woodfox, pending their decision as to whether to pursue a new trial against him. The prison also refused to move him out of solitary confinement. On February 12, 2015, the state indicted Woodfox for a third time for the 1972 murder of Brent Miller, the prison guard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/crime/baton-rouge/index.ssf/2015/02/angola_3_member_albert_woodfox_1.html|title=Angola 3 member Albert Woodfox indicted for 3rd time in 1972 murder of prison guard|work=NOLA.com}}</ref>\n\nOn June 8, 2015, U.S. District Judge James Brady ordered the release of Woodfox, after having overturned his second conviction for the killing of the guard Miller.

These shallow waters also provided protection from ships of the British [[Royal Navy]], which tended to be larger and required deep water to sail safely.<ref name=\"evans\" />\n\nLater in the 19th century, the design of Bermudian vessels had largely dispensed with square topsails and gaff rig, replacing them with triangular main sails and jibs. The Bermuda rig had traditionally been used on vessels with two or more masts, with the gaff rig favoured for single-masted vessels. The reason for this was the increased height necessary for a single mast, which led to too much canvas. The solid wooden masts at that height were also too heavy, and not sufficiently strong. Single-masted sloops quickly became the norm in Bermudian racing, with the introduction of hollow masts and other refinements.<ref name=\"Drower\">''Boats, Boffins and Bowlines: The Stories of Sailing Inventors and Innovations'', by George Drower.

The high, raked masts and long bowsprits and booms favoured in Bermuda allowed its vessels of all sizes to carry vast areas of sail when running down-wind with spinnakers and multiple jibs, allowing great speeds to be reached. Bermudian work boats, mostly small sloops, were ubiquitous on the archipelago's waters in the 19th century, moving freight, people, and everything else about. The rig was eventually adopted almost universally on small sailing craft in the 20th Century, although as seen on most modern vessels it is very much less extreme than on traditional Bermudian designs, with lower, vertical masts, shorter booms, omitted bowsprits, and much less area of canvas.<ref name=Drower/>\n\n==Merchant and privateering use==\nThe Bermuda sloop became the predominant type of sailing vessel both in the Bermudian colony and among [[sloop|sloop rigs]] worldwide as Bermudian traders visited foreign nations. Soon, shipbuilding became one of the primary trades on the island and ships were exported throughout the English colonies on the American seaboard, in the [[West Indies]], and eventually to [[Europe]]. Bermudians, largely slaves, built roughly a thousand ships during the 18th century. Although many of these were sold abroad, the colony maintained its own large merchant fleet which, thanks partly to the domination of trade in many American seaboard ports by branches of wealthy Bermudian families and partly to the suitability and availability of Bermudian vessels, carried much of the produce exported from the American south to Bermuda and to the West Indies aboard Bermudian mostly slave-manned vessels sailed southwest (more-or-less upwind) to the [[Turks and Caicos Islands|Turk Islands]], where salt was harvested. This salt was carried to North American ports and sold at high profits. Bermudian vessels also developed a trade in moving goods such as grain, cocoa, brandy, wine and more from the [[Atlantic seaboard]] colonies to the [[West Indies]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebermudian.com/heritage/heritage-heritage/bermuda-in-the-privateering-business/|title=Bermuda in the Privateering Business|last=Shorto|first=Gavin|date=2018-04-05|work=The Bermudian Magazine|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe threat of [[pirate|piracy]] and [[privateering]] was a large problem for mariners of all nations during the 17th and 18th centuries, but it was also as widely popular an enterprise.

The evasive capabilities highly prized by merchantmen also made Bermuda sloops the ship of choice for the pirates themselves, earlier in the 18th century, as well as for smugglers. They often carried sufficient crew out to return with several prizes, and these extra crew were useful both as movable ballast, and in handling the labor-intensive sloops. The shape of the ship enabled Bermudian mariners to excel. The same abilities allowed Bermuda sloops to escape from better-armed privateers and even larger [[Man-of-war]] British naval ships which, with their [[square rig]]s, could not sail as closely to windward. The ability of the sloop rig in general to sail upwind meant a Bermuda sloop could outrun most other sailing ships by simply turning upwind and leaving its pursuers floundering in its wake.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDespite Bermudian privateers preying heavily on American shipping during the [[American War of Independence]], some historians credit the large number of Bermuda sloops (reckoned at well over a thousand) built in Bermuda as privateers and sold illegally to the Americans as enabling the rebellious colonies to win their independence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Slavery and the Bermuda sloop==\nThe commercial success of the Bermuda sloop must be credited to the contribution of Bermuda's free and [[slavery|enslaved]] Blacks. For most of the 17th century, Bermuda's agricultural economy was reliant on indentured servants. This meant that slavery did not play the same role as in many other colonies, though privateers based in Bermuda often brought enslaved blacks and Native Americans who had been captured along with ships of enemy nations. The first large influx of blacks was of free men who came as indentured servants in the middle of the century from former Spanish colonies in the West Indies (the increasing numbers of black, Spanish-speaking probable-Catholics alarmed the white Protestant majority, who were also alarmed by native Irish sent to Bermuda to be sold into servitude after the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]], and measures were taken to discourage black immigration and to ban the importation of Irish). After 1684, Bermuda turned wholesale to a maritime economy, and slaves, black, Amerindian, and Irish (the various minorities merged into a single demographic group, known as ''coloured'', which included anyone who was not defined as entirely of European extraction), played an increasing role in this. [[Black Bermudian]]<nowiki/>s became highly skilled shipwrights, blacksmiths and joiners. Many of the shipwrights who helped to develop shipbuilding in the American South, especially on the [[Virginia]] shore of the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] (Bermuda, also known as ''Virgineola'', had once been part of Virginia, and had maintained close connections ever since), were black Bermudian slaves, and the design and success of the area's schooners owes something to them, also.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIjfAAAAMAAJ|title=Tidewater Triumph: The Development and Worldwide Success of the Chesapeake Bay Pilot Schooner|last=Footner|first=Geoffrey M.|date=1998|publisher=Tidewater Publishers|isbn=9780870335112|language=en}}</ref>\n\nDue to the large number of white Bermudian men who were away at sea at any one time (and possibly due as much to fear of the larger number of enslaved black Bermudian men left behind) it was mandated that blacks must make up a percentage of the crew of every Bermudian vessel.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sLrqCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA526|title=In the Eye of All Trade: Bermuda, Bermudians, and the Maritime Atlantic World, 1680-1783|last=Jarvis|first=Michael J.|date=2012|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=9780807895887|language=en}}</ref> By the American War of Independence, the use of many able black slaves as sailors added considerably to the power of the Bermudian merchant fleet due to their highly needed skill set, and these included the crews of Bermudian privateers.

The reduced sail area makes modern boats much more manageable, especially for small or inexperienced crews.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXsNAAAAYAAJ|title=Sailing in Bermuda: Sail Racing in the Nineteenth Century|last=Arnell|first=J.C.|date=1982|publisher=Royal Hamilton Amateur Dinghy Club|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Sailing in Bermuda: Sail Racing in the Nineteenth Century'', by J.

Some focus on [[porting]] games from one system to another, or translating games from one language to another. Less commonly, some do software development work in addition to games.\n\nMost [[video game publisher]]s maintain development studios (such as [[Electronic Arts]]'s [[EA Canada]], [[Square Enix]]'s studios, [[Activision]]'s [[Radical Entertainment]], [[Nintendo EAD]] and Sony's [[Polyphony Digital]] and [[Naughty Dog]]). However, since publishing is still their primary activity they are generally described as \"publishers\" rather than \"developers\". Developers may be private as well (such as how [[Bungie]] was, the company which developed the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' series]] exclusive to Microsoft's [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]).\n\n==Types==\n\n===First-party developer===\nIn the [[video game industry]], a first-party developer is part of a company which manufactures a [[video game console]] and develops exclusively for it. First-party developers may use the name of the company itself (such as [[Nintendo]]), have a specific division name (such as [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony's]] [[Polyphony Digital]]) or have been an independent studio before being acquired by the console manufacturer (such as [[Rare (company)|Rare]] or [[Naughty Dog]]).<ref>{{cite web|last=Ahmed|first=Shahed |title=Naughty Dog discusses being acquired by Sony|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-discusses-being-acquired-by-sony/1100-2677654/|website=GameSpot}}</ref> Whether by purchasing an independent studio or by founding a new team, the acquisition of a first-party developer involves a huge [[financial investment]] on the part of the console manufacturer, which is wasted if the developer fails to produce a hit game in a timely manner.<ref name=NGen30>{{cite magazine |title=Is Your Favorite Game Company Ripping You Off? |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=30|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=June 1997|pages=39\u201340 |url=https://archive.org/stream/NextGeneration30Jun1997/Next_Generation_30_Jun_1997#page/n40}}</ref> However, using first-party developers saves the cost of having to make royalty payments on a game's profits.<ref name=NGen30/>\n\n===Second-party developer===\nSecond-party developer is a colloquial term often used by gaming enthusiasts and media to describe game studios who take development contracts from platform holders and produce games exclusive to that platform.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z: Second Party|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=40}}</ref> As a balance to not being able to release their game for other platforms, second-party developers are usually offered higher royalty rates than third-party developers.<ref name=NGen30/> These studios may have exclusive publishing agreements (or other business relationships) with the platform holder, but maintain independence so upon completion or termination of their contracts are able to continue developing games. Examples are [[Insomniac Games]] (originally a 2nd party for Sony), [[Remedy Entertainment]] (originally a 2nd party for Microsoft) and [[Game Freak]] (a 2nd party for Nintendo).\n\n===Third-party developers===\n{{Anchor|Third-party developers|3rd-party developers}}\n{{see also|Third-party software component}}\n\nA third-party developer may also publish games, or work for a video game publisher to develop a title. Both publisher and developer have considerable input in the game's [[Game design|design]] and content. However, the publisher's wishes generally override those of the developer.\n\nThe business arrangement between the developer and publisher is governed by a [[contract]], which specifies a list of [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]] intended to be delivered over a period of time. By updating its milestones, the publisher verifies that work is progressing quickly enough to meet its deadline and can direct the developer if the game is not meeting expectations. When each milestone is completed (and accepted), the publisher pays the developer an advance on [[royalties]]. Successful developers may maintain several teams working on different games for different publishers. Generally, however, third-party developers tend to be small, close-knit teams. Third-party game development is a volatile sector, since small developers may be dependent on income from a single publisher; one canceled game may be devastating to a small developer. Because of this, many small development companies are short-lived.\n\nA common [[exit strategy]] for a successful video-game developer is to sell the company to a publisher, becoming an in-house developer. In-house development teams tend to have more freedom in the design and content of a game compared to third-party developers. One reason is that since the developers are employees of the publisher, their interests are aligned with those of the publisher; the publisher may spend less effort ensuring that the developer's decisions do not enrich the developer at the publisher's expense.\n\n[[Activision]] in 1979 became the first third-party video game developer,<ref name=\"mj19821226\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nwsdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QX8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=3635%2C1989311 | title=Stream of video games is endless | work=Milwaukee Journal | date=1982-12-26 | accessdate=10 January 2015 | pages=Business 1}}</ref> where the term \"second-party\" originally referred to the consumers.\n\nIn recent years, larger publishers have acquired several third-party developers. While these development teams are now technically \"in-house\", they often continue to operate in an autonomous manner (with their own culture and work practices). For example, Activision acquired [[Raven Software|Raven]] (1997); [[Neversoft]] (1999), which merged with [[Infinity Ward]] in 2014; [[Z-Axis]] (2001); [[Treyarch]] (2001); [[Luxoflux]] (2002); [[Shaba Games|Shaba]] (2002); [[Infinity Ward]] (2003) and [[Vicarious Visions]] (2005). All these developers continue operating much as they did before acquisition, the primary differences being exclusivity and financial details. Publishers tend to be more forgiving of their own development teams going over budget (or missing deadlines) than third-party developers.\n\nA developer may not be the primary entity creating a piece of software, usually providing an external software tool which helps organize (or use) information for the primary software product. Such tools may be a [[database]], [[Voice over IP]], or add-in [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] software; this is also known as [[middleware]]. Examples of this include [[SpeedTree]] and [[Havok (software)|Havoc]].\n\n===Indie game developers===\n{{See also|Indie game|Independent video game development}}\nIndependents are software developers which are not owned by (or dependent on) a single publisher. Some of these developers self-publish their games, relying on the [[Internet]] and word of mouth for publicity. Without the large marketing budgets of mainstream publishers, their products may receive less recognition than those of larger publishers such as Sony, Microsoft or Nintendo. With the advent of digital distribution of inexpensive games on game consoles, it is now possible for indie game developers to forge agreements with console manufacturers for broad distribution of their games.\n\nOther indie game developers create game software for a number of video-game publishers on several gaming platforms.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In recent years this model has been in decline; larger publishers, such as Electronic Arts and Activision, increasingly turn to internal studios (usually former independent developers acquired for their development needs).<ref>https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130449/the_end_game_how_top_developers_.php</ref>\n\n==Quality of life==\nVideo game development is usually conducted in a casual business environment, with T-shirts and sandals common work attire.

The creative rewards of work in the entertainment business attracts [[Workforce|labor]] to the industry, creating a competitive [[labor market]] which demands a high level of commitment and performance from employees. Industry communities, such as the [[International Game Developers Association]] (IGDA), are conducting increasing discussions about the problem; they are concerned that working conditions in the industry cause significant deterioration in its employees' quality of life.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.igda.org/articles/erobinson_crunch.php |title = Why Crunch Mode Doesn't Work: Six Lessons|website = [[IGDA]]|last = Robinson|first = Evan|date = 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://push.cx/2009/the-game-industry|title = The Game Industry |website= Push.cox|last = Harkins|first = Peter Bhat|date = 5 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n===\"Crunch time\"===\n{{anchor|Crunch time}}\nSome video game developers (such as [[Electronic Arts]]) have been accused of the excessive invocation of \"crunch time\".<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.cnet.com/news/no-fun-for-game-developers/|title = No fun for game developers?|work= [[CNet News]]|last = Frauenheim|first =Ed|date = 11 November 2004}}</ref> \"Crunch time\" is the point at which the team is thought to be failing to achieve milestones needed to launch a game on schedule.

Some focus on [[porting]] games from one system to another, or translating games from one language to another. Less commonly, some do software development work in addition to games.\n\nMost [[video game publisher]]s maintain development studios (such as [[Electronic Arts]]'s [[EA Canada]], [[Square Enix]]'s studios, [[Activision]]'s [[Radical Entertainment]], [[Nintendo EAD]] and Sony's [[Polyphony Digital]] and [[Naughty Dog]]). However, since publishing is still their primary activity they are generally described as \"publishers\" rather than \"developers\". Developers may be private as well (such as how [[Bungie]] was, the company which developed the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' series]] exclusive to Microsoft's [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]).\n\n==Types==\n\n===First-party developer===\nIn the [[video game industry]], a first-party developer is part of a company which manufactures a [[video game console]] and develops exclusively for it. First-party developers may use the name of the company itself (such as [[Nintendo]]), have a specific division name (such as [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony's]] [[Polyphony Digital]]) or have been an independent studio before being acquired by the console manufacturer (such as [[Rare (company)|Rare]] or [[Naughty Dog]]).<ref>{{cite web|last=Ahmed|first=Shahed |title=Naughty Dog discusses being acquired by Sony|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-discusses-being-acquired-by-sony/1100-2677654/|website=GameSpot}}</ref> Whether by purchasing an independent studio or by founding a new team, the acquisition of a first-party developer involves a huge [[financial investment]] on the part of the console manufacturer, which is wasted if the developer fails to produce a hit game in a timely manner.<ref name=NGen30>{{cite magazine |title=Is Your Favorite Game Company Ripping You Off? |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=30|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=June 1997|pages=39\u201340 |url=https://archive.org/stream/NextGeneration30Jun1997/Next_Generation_30_Jun_1997#page/n40}}</ref> However, using first-party developers saves the cost of having to make royalty payments on a game's profits.<ref name=NGen30/>\n\n===Second-party developer===\nSecond-party developer is a colloquial term often used by gaming enthusiasts and media to describe game studios who take development contracts from platform holders and produce games exclusive to that platform.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z: Second Party|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=40}}</ref> As a balance to not being able to release their game for other platforms, second-party developers are usually offered higher royalty rates than third-party developers.<ref name=NGen30/> These studios may have exclusive publishing agreements (or other business relationships) with the platform holder, but maintain independence so upon completion or termination of their contracts are able to continue developing games. Examples are [[Insomniac Games]] (originally a 2nd party for Sony), [[Remedy Entertainment]] (originally a 2nd party for Microsoft) and [[Game Freak]] (a 2nd party for Nintendo).\n\n===Third-party developers===\n{{Anchor|Third-party developers|3rd-party developers}}\n{{see also|Third-party software component}}\n\nA third-party developer may also publish games, or work for a video game publisher to develop a title. Both publisher and developer have considerable input in the game's [[Game design|design]] and content. However, the publisher's wishes generally override those of the developer.\n\nThe business arrangement between the developer and publisher is governed by a [[contract]], which specifies a list of [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]] intended to be delivered over a period of time. By updating its milestones, the publisher verifies that work is progressing quickly enough to meet its deadline and can direct the developer if the game is not meeting expectations. When each milestone is completed (and accepted), the publisher pays the developer an advance on [[royalties]]. Successful developers may maintain several teams working on different games for different publishers. Generally, however, third-party developers tend to be small, close-knit teams. Third-party game development is a volatile sector, since small developers may be dependent on income from a single publisher; one canceled game may be devastating to a small developer. Because of this, many small development companies are short-lived.\n\nA common [[exit strategy]] for a successful video-game developer is to sell the company to a publisher, becoming an in-house developer. In-house development teams tend to have more freedom in the design and content of a game compared to third-party developers. One reason is that since the developers are employees of the publisher, their interests are aligned with those of the publisher; the publisher may spend less effort ensuring that the developer's decisions do not enrich the developer at the publisher's expense.\n\n[[Activision]] in 1979 became the first third-party video game developer,<ref name=\"mj19821226\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nwsdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QX8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=3635%2C1989311 | title=Stream of video games is endless | work=Milwaukee Journal | date=1982-12-26 | accessdate=10 January 2015 | pages=Business 1}}</ref> where the term \"second-party\" originally referred to the consumers.\n\nIn recent years, larger publishers have acquired several third-party developers. While these development teams are now technically \"in-house\", they often continue to operate in an autonomous manner (with their own culture and work practices). For example, Activision acquired [[Raven Software|Raven]] (1997); [[Neversoft]] (1999), which merged with [[Infinity Ward]] in 2014; [[Z-Axis]] (2001); [[Treyarch]] (2001); [[Luxoflux]] (2002); [[Shaba Games|Shaba]] (2002); [[Infinity Ward]] (2003) and [[Vicarious Visions]] (2005). All these developers continue operating much as they did before acquisition, the primary differences being exclusivity and financial details. Publishers tend to be more forgiving of their own development teams going over budget (or missing deadlines) than third-party developers.\n\nA developer may not be the primary entity creating a piece of software, usually providing an external software tool which helps organize (or use) information for the primary software product. Such tools may be a [[database]], [[Voice over IP]], or add-in [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] software; this is also known as [[middleware]]. Examples of this include [[SpeedTree]] and [[Havok (software)|Havoc]].\n\n===Indie game developers===\n{{See also|Indie game|Independent video game development}}\nIndependents are software developers which are not owned by (or dependent on) a single publisher. Some of these developers self-publish their games, relying on the [[Internet]] and word of mouth for publicity. Without the large marketing budgets of mainstream publishers, their products may receive less recognition than those of larger publishers such as Sony, Microsoft or Nintendo. With the advent of digital distribution of inexpensive games on game consoles, it is now possible for indie game developers to forge agreements with console manufacturers for broad distribution of their games.\n\nOther indie game developers create game software for a number of video-game publishers on several gaming platforms.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In recent years this model has been in decline; larger publishers, such as Electronic Arts and Activision, increasingly turn to internal studios (usually former independent developers acquired for their development needs).<ref>https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130449/the_end_game_how_top_developers_.php</ref>\n\n==Quality of life==\nVideo game development is usually conducted in a casual business environment, with T-shirts and sandals common work attire.

Liquorice confections are primarily purchased by consumers in Europe, but are also popular in other countries such as Australia and New Zealand.<ref name=Mafco2010/>\n\nIn the Netherlands, liquorice confectionery (''drop'') is one of the most popular forms of sweets. It is sold in many forms. Mixing it with [[mentha|mint]], [[menthol]], [[aniseed]], or [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] is quite popular. Mixing it with [[ammonium chloride]] (''salmiak'') is also popular. A popular example of salmiak liquorice in the Netherlands is known as ''zoute drop'' ([[salty liquorice]]), but contains very little salt, i.e., sodium chloride.<ref>[http://nevo-online.rivm.nl/] the online Dutch food composition database]</ref> Strong, [[salty liquorice|salty]] sweets are also popular in [[Nordic countries]].\n\nDried sticks of the liquorice root are also a traditional confectionery in their own right in the Netherlands, although their popularity has quickly waned in recent decades. They were sold simply as sticks of ''zoethout'' ('sweet wood') to chew on as a candy. Through chewing and suckling, the intensely sweet flavour is released. The sweetness is 30 to 50 times as strong as sucrose, without causing damage to teeth. Since about the 1970s, ''zoethout'' has become rarer and been replaced by easier to consume candies (including 'drop').\n\n[[Pontefract]] in [[Yorkshire]], England, was the first place where liquorice mixed with sugar began to be used as a sweet in the same way it is today.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aboutfood.co.uk/places/yorkshire_guide.html |publisher=AboutFood.com |title=Right good food from the Ridings |date=25 October 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607194557/http://www.aboutfood.co.uk/places/yorkshire_guide.html |archivedate= 7 June 2007 }}</ref>  [[Pontefract cake]]s were originally made there.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20190710-the-strange-story-of-britains-oldest-sweet |publisher=BBC Travel |title=The strange story of Britain's oldest sweet|date=2019-07-11\n }}</ref> In County Durham, Yorkshire and Lancashire, it is colloquially known as 'Spanish', supposedly because Spanish monks grew liquorice root at [[Rievaulx Abbey]] near [[Thirsk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/918508.where_liquorice_roots_go_deep/|title=Where Liquorice Roots Go Deep|publisher=Northern Echo|accessdate=9 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn Italy (particularly in the south), Spain and France, liquorice is popular in its natural form. The root of the plant is simply dug up, washed, dried, and chewed as a mouth freshener. Throughout Italy, unsweetened liquorice is consumed in the form of small black pieces made only from 100% pure liquorice extract.

It is sold in many forms. Mixing it with [[mentha|mint]], [[menthol]], [[aniseed]], or [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] is quite popular. Mixing it with [[ammonium chloride]] (''salmiak'') is also popular. A popular example of salmiak liquorice in the Netherlands is known as ''zoute drop'' ([[salty liquorice]]), but contains very little salt, i.e., sodium chloride.<ref>[http://nevo-online.rivm.nl/] the online Dutch food composition database]</ref> Strong, [[salty liquorice|salty]] sweets are also popular in [[Nordic countries]].\n\nDried sticks of the liquorice root are also a traditional confectionery in their own right in the Netherlands, although their popularity has quickly waned in recent decades. They were sold simply as sticks of ''zoethout'' ('sweet wood') to chew on as a candy. Through chewing and suckling, the intensely sweet flavour is released. The sweetness is 30 to 50 times as strong as sucrose, without causing damage to teeth. Since about the 1970s, ''zoethout'' has become rarer and been replaced by easier to consume candies (including 'drop').\n\n[[Pontefract]] in [[Yorkshire]], England, was the first place where liquorice mixed with sugar began to be used as a sweet in the same way it is today.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aboutfood.co.uk/places/yorkshire_guide.html |publisher=AboutFood.com |title=Right good food from the Ridings |date=25 October 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607194557/http://www.aboutfood.co.uk/places/yorkshire_guide.html |archivedate= 7 June 2007 }}</ref>  [[Pontefract cake]]s were originally made there.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20190710-the-strange-story-of-britains-oldest-sweet |publisher=BBC Travel |title=The strange story of Britain's oldest sweet|date=2019-07-11\n }}</ref> In County Durham, Yorkshire and Lancashire, it is colloquially known as 'Spanish', supposedly because Spanish monks grew liquorice root at [[Rievaulx Abbey]] near [[Thirsk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/918508.where_liquorice_roots_go_deep/|title=Where Liquorice Roots Go Deep|publisher=Northern Echo|accessdate=9 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn Italy (particularly in the south), Spain and France, liquorice is popular in its natural form.

It is currently run by the [[Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary]].\n\nThe school moved to its present location in 1903. At that time the school sat out on the prairie in an undeveloped area. However, within a few years, the quickly expanding Winnipeg had enveloped the school. St. Mary's Academy went through several expansions in the years that followed. St. Mary's Academy was set far from all known cities, however over time as the city grew, the city reached St. Mary's Academy. \n\nToday the school has around 600 female students and roughly 50 faculty members. St. Mary's Academy provides a structured environment with an excellent academic and athletic program.\n\n==Vision==\n\nThe school's mission is to nurture young women, spirit, mind and body, so that each student reaches her full potential as an individual created in God\u2019s image.\n\nSMA's vision is that each graduate leaves the school empowered with: an awareness of her gifts; a sense of social responsibility and a commitment and generosity to others; a love of learning and a desire for excellence in all endeavors; a complement of academic and social skills; a set of moral values based on an appreciation of the Catholic faith; a conscious spirituality.\n\n==Mission==\nThe mission of St. Mary's Academy is to educate young women within a Catholic faith community. A Catholic school in the tradition of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, St. Mary's Academy promotes the dignity of each person and challenges each member of the school community to act justly.\n\nIn carrying out its mission, the Academy is guided by the following principles:\nFormation of the Whole Person: Providing learning opportunities which foster the full development of each student;\nIntellectual Growth: Offering an intellectually challenging program of studies which fosters a love of learning and which prepares students for post-secondary education;\nReligious Development: Providing a religious education program which includes required courses, liturgical celebrations and varied religious experiences;\n\nFaith Integration: Ensuring that Christian values permeate the entire curriculum and all activities of the school community;\n\nLeadership Development: Providing an environment and opportunities which encourage young women to develop and exercise leadership skills;\n\nSocial Responsibility: Educating to a social awareness which leads to action, with emphasis on service to the poor and disadvantaged;\n\nProgram Recognition: Developing courses based on curriculum guidelines approved by Manitoba Education and Training and employing certified, qualified teachers\n\nFinancial Accessibility:Providing monetary aid to qualifying students through the bursary program;\n\nCooperation With Parents: Encouraging close, active cooperation with parents who are the primary educators of their children;\n\nCollaboration With the Church: Fostering loyalty and cooperation with the diocese and integration of the school into the local church.\n\n==Academy life==\n\n===Athletics===\nSMA has an active and extensive Athletic program.

Courses are based on the curriculum approved by Manitoba Education, Citizenship and Youth. SMA offers a variety of courses to meet student learning needs and interests. At each grade level particular emphasis is placed on the core subjects English and mathematics. Students are expected to do homework daily and regularly review material studied in class. Homework provides practice for important skills and concepts. It helps students become independent learners and develop a disciplined work ethic.\n\nThe religious education program is a key component of both the academic curriculum and the religious culture at SMA. Students are required to successfully complete 1/2 credit in religious studies each year. Courses are designed to provide students with a basic knowledge and understanding of the Catholic/Christian faith and the opportunity to live out their faith through community service and participation in a wide variety of faith based experiences.\n\nStudents in all grade levels must complete one grade before advancing to the next at St. Mary\u2019s Academy.\n\n==Campus==\nSt. Mary\u2019s Academy is located on {{convert|11.5|acre}} in a park-like setting in the heart of Winnipeg. The original five-story building, with the main entrance facing Wellington Crescent, opened in 1903. This building is used primarily for offices and work space for the school staff and the Sisters of the Holy Names. It also includes Holy Names Chapel and a 100-seat auditorium.\nIn 1909 a larger building was attached that houses most of the 21 classrooms as well as the Richardson Science Wing, the human ecology department and a computer lab. Recent renovations and upgrades to meet building code standards and to enhance programs left intact the traditional architecture wherever possible, and also incorporated up-to-date technology, furnishings and equipment, and resulted in a more comfortable learning environment with improved lighting and air-conditioning.\n\nThe newest wing was opened in October 1964. It includes Alumnae Hall, a library, a fine arts studio, the Sister Rita Maureen Gym, a cafeteria and a computer lab. The gym is home to the St. Mary\u2019s Academy Flames while Alumnae Hall, a 625-seat theatre, houses drama productions, assemblies, school Masses, and meetings.\n\n==History==\n\n===The foundation period===\nIn 1869 Winnipeg was a straggling frontier village in the Red River Settlement. On May 1 of that year, at the request of [[Alexandre-Antonin Tach\u00e9|Archbishop Tach\u00e9]], two Grey Nuns opened the first Catholic school in Winnipeg, St. Mary\u2019s Academy, to serve the English-speaking Catholics on the west side of the Red River across from St. Boniface. The Academy was located in a rented house on Victoria Street near the centre of population between the intersection of Portage and Main and The Forks, the junction of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. The convent chapel also became home to St. Mary\u2019s Catholic Church until August 1874, when a church was built at the corner of St. Mary Avenue and Hargrave. In the spring of 1873, when the new province of Manitoba assumed responsibility for education, St. Mary\u2019s began to receive public funding. \n\nBecause the arrangement with the Grey Nuns was a temporary one, in 1874 Archbishop Tach\u00e9 recruited the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, a teaching congregation from Quebec, to work in education in the diocese. On August 22, 1874, four Sisters of the Holy Names arrived from [[Montreal|Montr\u00e9al]] to assume responsibility for St. Mary\u2019s Academy. When the school opened on August 29, 1874, 19 students came to register: 12 girls and 7 boys. In later weeks the enrollment grew to 126, including 50 boys. The following year, three Christian Brothers came to Winnipeg and began a school for boys on Hargrave Street (the beginnings of St. Mary\u2019s School). Boys were not seen within the walls of the Academy again until 1915 when, by special request from the archbishop, they were accepted into grades one and two until 1950.\n\n===The Brick Academy===\nEnrollment at the girls school increased rapidly and the first St. Mary's Academy on Victoria Street was soon filled to capacity. In 1876 a second small house, called The Annex, was erected, but continued overcrowding necessitated a move to larger quarters on Notre Dame East in 1881, to which a wing was added in 1892. The opening of this second Academy coincided with the period in Manitoba\u2019s history known as The Boom. Despite the fact that the Manitoba School Act of 1890 removed all public support from Catholic schools, forcing them to become private institutions, registration of resident and day students continued to grow at SMA. Once again the facility became inadequate and the Sisters searched for a new location for the third Academy, away from the crowded, noisy, commercial core of the city.\n\n===A New Academy in Crescentwood===\nA {{convert|15|acre|adj=on}} site was purchased in Crescentwood for a new Academy designed by Samuel Hooper. On August 31, 1902, the cornerstone for the Wellington Crescent Academy was blessed. The Edward Cass Construction Company took the better part of a year to complete the building at an estimated cost of $75,000. The new Academy, shaped like a \u201cU\u201d was an elaborate structure four stories high with solid brick walls and a mansard roof. The top floor was one large dormitory for students. The Manitoba Free Press questioned why the Sisters built so far out on the prairies. On September 6, 1903, the school opened with 27 Sisters, 148 borders and 48 day students. \n\nIn 1904 land was sold to the city of Winnipeg to extend Stafford Street and to the Winnipeg School Division for Kelvin High School.\n\n===1909\u20131963===\nBy 1909 another addition was needed. The {{convert|66|x|120|ft|adj=on}} four storey over stone basement, costing about $80,000, was designed by J.A. Senecal and J.A. Hudon and built by Senecal and Smith. The annex was {{convert|18|ft}} wider than the original building. This change in width was hidden on the Academy Road side by a large tower housing a staircase. The fourth floor was an extension of the dormitories. The south side of the first floor housed the music department with 25 pianos. A substantial amount of piling work was undertaken during the 1930s to address cracking foundations and other damage. \n\nIn 1926 St. Mary\u2019s became affiliated with the University of Manitoba and began functioning as St. Mary\u2019s Academy and College. At the time, St. Mary\u2019s was the West\u2019s only Catholic institution where the full college course was offered to women. A pupil entering kindergarten could continue through college without change of school.\n\nDuring the 1930s the school survived the ever-increasing taxes on the property, accentuated by the depression, and launched a new period of steady growth in the post-war era.\n\n===Another expansion===\nIn June 1960 the boarding school closed, ending a ninety-year-old tradition, and the elementary grades and the College were phased out to help reduce crowding. But, as enrollment continued to climb, a third expansion was necessary. The 1964 addition, a large wing including a theatre, library, fine arts studio and gym, was inspired by a desire to enrich the school culturally. By the end of the decade the Academy was a junior and senior high school for day students.\n\n===The Last five decades===\nIn the last decades of the 20th century other changes were made to keep up with the times and to meet the needs of students. In 1969 the ornate chapel was altered to in accord with the liturgical renewal mandated by Vatican Council II. In May 1971, the Commercial or Secretarial department, which began in 1904, closed and the academic program became oriented more to preparation for post-secondary education. In 1981 the music rooms were eliminated to make way for additional classrooms and home economics labs. \n\nWhile the school grew it became increasingly clear that the role of the Sisters was changing. In December 1979 St. Mary's Academy Inc. was incorporated in the Province of Manitoba and a Board of Directors, whose members included parents, alumnae, friends of the Academy and Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, assumed responsibility for the school. By the 1980s most Sisters had been replaced by lay teachers, many of whom were themselves alumnae. In 1985 the director/principal administration model was adopted and the first director and lay principal were named. As the century drew to a close, in June 1999, the last few Sisters living in residence moved out. \n\nThe space vacated by the Sisters presented the school with new opportunity. In 2002 the 1909 wing underwent major renovations and upgrades once again. Four new science labs were built on the fourth floor and the old labs in the basement were converted into home economics labs. Two classrooms were added and the entire building was air-conditioned and brought up to current building and fire code standards.\nToday, St. Mary's Academy remains the oldest, continuously operating, independent school in the province. The school is noted for its commitment to young women and for providing exceptional academic, religious, and extra-curricular programs.\n\n===Recent expansion===\nThe school went through another expansion, opening up a new library, fitness center, new art studio, and with a few other large expansions still to be completed.  The new art lab has drafting tables, pottery wheels, a Mac lab, and Wacom tablets.\n\nThe school is officially opened its new dramatic arts wing complete with props studio, make up/dressing rooms, and costume lab, in September 2013. \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.stmarysacademy.mb.ca/ St. Mary's Academy website]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Mary's Academy}}\n[[Category:High schools in Winnipeg]]\n[[Category:Catholic secondary schools in Manitoba]]\n[[Category:Private schools in Manitoba]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1869]]\n[[Category:Girls' schools in Canada]]\n[[Category:1869 establishments in Canada]]\n", "text_old": "{{Primary sources|date=August 2008}}\n{{Infobox school\n| name                  = St. Mary's Academy\n| image                 =\n| caption               =\n| address               = 550 Wellington Crescent\n| city                  = [[Winnipeg]]\n| province              = [[Manitoba]]\n| postcode              = [[Postal codes in Canada|R3M 0C1]]\n| country               = Canada\n| coordinates           = {{coord|49|52|32|N|97|9|52|W|type:edu_region:CA-MB|display=inline,title}}\n| schooltype            = Private girls-only school\n| motto                 = Teneamus Altam Facem\n| motto_translation     = Hold High the Torch\n| religious_affiliation = [[Catholic]]\n| president             = Connie Yunyk\n| founded               = May 1, 1869\n| grades_label          = [[Education in Canada#Levels in education|Grades]]\n| grades                = 7\u201312\n| enrollment            = 600\n| language              = English\n| colours               = Navy blue and blue plaid\n| team_name             = Flames\n| homepage              = {{URL|http://www.stmarysacademy.mb.ca/}}\n}}\n\n'''St. Mary's Academy'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stmarysacademy.mb.ca|title=St. Mary's Academy, Winnipeg Manitoba Canada}}</ref> is a private [[Catholic]] girls' school in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], [[Canada]].

On May 1 of that year, at the request of [[Alexandre-Antonin Tach\u00e9|Archbishop Tach\u00e9]], two Grey Nuns opened the first Catholic school in Winnipeg, St. Mary\u2019s Academy, to serve the English-speaking Catholics on the west side of the Red River across from St. Boniface. The Academy was located in a rented house on Victoria Street near the centre of population between the intersection of Portage and Main and The Forks, the junction of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. The convent chapel also became home to St. Mary\u2019s Catholic Church until August 1874, when a church was built at the corner of St. Mary Avenue and Hargrave. In the spring of 1873, when the new province of Manitoba assumed responsibility for education, St. Mary\u2019s began to receive public funding. \n\nBecause the arrangement with the Grey Nuns was a temporary one, in 1874 Archbishop Tach\u00e9 recruited the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, a teaching congregation from Quebec, to work in education in the diocese. On August 22, 1874, four Sisters of the Holy Names arrived from [[Montreal|Montr\u00e9al]] to assume responsibility for St. Mary\u2019s Academy. When the school opened on August 29, 1874, 19 students came to register: 12 girls and 7 boys. In later weeks the enrollment grew to 126, including 50 boys. The following year, three Christian Brothers came to Winnipeg and began a school for boys on Hargrave Street (the beginnings of St. Mary\u2019s School). Boys were not seen within the walls of the Academy again until 1915 when, by special request from the archbishop, they were accepted into grades one and two until 1950.\n\n===The Brick Academy===\nEnrollment at the girls school increased rapidly and the first St. Mary's Academy on Victoria Street was soon filled to capacity. In 1876 a second small house, called The Annex, was erected, but continued overcrowding necessitated a move to larger quarters on Notre Dame East in 1881, to which a wing was added in 1892. The opening of this second Academy coincided with the period in Manitoba\u2019s history known as The Boom. Despite the fact that the Manitoba School Act of 1890 removed all public support from Catholic schools, forcing them to become private institutions, registration of resident and day students continued to grow at SMA. Once again the facility became inadequate and the Sisters searched for a new location for the third Academy, away from the crowded, noisy, commercial core of the city.\n\n===A New Academy in Crescentwood===\nA {{convert|15|acre|adj=on}} site was purchased in Crescentwood for a new Academy designed by Samuel Hooper. On August 31, 1902, the cornerstone for the Wellington Crescent Academy was blessed. The Edward Cass Construction Company took the better part of a year to complete the building at an estimated cost of $75,000. The new Academy, shaped like a \u201cU\u201d was an elaborate structure four stories high with solid brick walls and a mansard roof. The top floor was one large dormitory for students. The Manitoba Free Press questioned why the Sisters built so far out on the prairies. On September 6, 1903, the school opened with 27 Sisters, 148 borders and 48 day students. \n\nIn 1904 land was sold to the city of Winnipeg to extend Stafford Street and to the Winnipeg School Division for Kelvin High School.\n\n===1909\u20131963===\nBy 1909 another addition was needed. The {{convert|66|x|120|ft|adj=on}} four storey over stone basement, costing about $80,000, was designed by J.A. Senecal and J.A. Hudon and built by Senecal and Smith. The annex was {{convert|18|ft}} wider than the original building. This change in width was hidden on the Academy Road side by a large tower housing a staircase. The fourth floor was an extension of the dormitories. The south side of the first floor housed the music department with 25 pianos. A substantial amount of piling work was undertaken during the 1930s to address cracking foundations and other damage. \n\nIn 1926 St. Mary\u2019s became affiliated with the University of Manitoba and began functioning as St. Mary\u2019s Academy and College. At the time, St. Mary\u2019s was the West\u2019s only Catholic institution where the full college course was offered to women. A pupil entering kindergarten could continue through college without change of school.\n\nDuring the 1930s the school survived the ever-increasing taxes on the property, accentuated by the depression, and launched a new period of steady growth in the post-war era.\n\n===Another expansion===\nIn June 1960 the boarding school closed, ending a ninety-year-old tradition, and the elementary grades and the College were phased out to help reduce crowding. But, as enrollment continued to climb, a third expansion was necessary. The 1964 addition, a large wing including a theatre, library, fine arts studio and gym, was inspired by a desire to enrich the school culturally. By the end of the decade the Academy was a junior and senior high school for day students.\n\n===The Last five decades===\nIn the last decades of the 20th century other changes were made to keep up with the times and to meet the needs of students. In 1969 the ornate chapel was altered to in accord with the liturgical renewal mandated by Vatican Council II. In May 1971, the Commercial or Secretarial department, which began in 1904, closed and the academic program became oriented more to preparation for post-secondary education. In 1981 the music rooms were eliminated to make way for additional classrooms and home economics labs. \n\nWhile the school grew it became increasingly clear that the role of the Sisters was changing. In December 1979 St. Mary's Academy Inc. was incorporated in the Province of Manitoba and a Board of Directors, whose members included parents, alumnae, friends of the Academy and Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, assumed responsibility for the school. By the 1980s most Sisters had been replaced by lay teachers, many of whom were themselves alumnae. In 1985 the director/principal administration model was adopted and the first director and lay principal were named. As the century drew to a close, in June 1999, the last few Sisters living in residence moved out. \n\nThe space vacated by the Sisters presented the school with new opportunity. In 2002 the 1909 wing underwent major renovations and upgrades once again. Four new science labs were built on the fourth floor and the old labs in the basement were converted into home economics labs. Two classrooms were added and the entire building was air-conditioned and brought up to current building and fire code standards.\nToday, St. Mary's Academy remains the oldest, continuously operating, independent school in the province. The school is noted for its commitment to young women and for providing exceptional academic, religious, and extra-curricular programs.\n\n===Recent expansion===\nThe school went through another expansion, opening up a new library, fitness center, new art studio, and with a few other large expansions still to be completed.  The new art lab has drafting tables, pottery wheels, a Mac lab, and Wacom tablets.\n\nThe school is officially opened its new dramatic arts wing complete with props studio, make up/dressing rooms, and costume lab, in September 2013. \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.stmarysacademy.mb.ca/ St. Mary's Academy website]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Mary's Academy}}\n[[Category:High schools in Winnipeg]]\n[[Category:Catholic secondary schools in Manitoba]]\n[[Category:Private schools in Manitoba]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1869]]\n[[Category:Girls' schools in Canada]]\n[[Category:1869 establishments in Canada]]\n", "name_user": "Sarahmcdonaldsss", "label": "safe", "comment": "Some historical indefinetes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Mary%27s_Academy_(Winnipeg)"}
