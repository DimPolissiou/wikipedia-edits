{"title_page": "Unemployment benefits", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2018}}\n{{Economics sidebar}}\n\n'''Unemployment benefits''' (depending on the jurisdiction also called '''unemployment insurance''' or '''unemployment compensation''') are payments made by authorized bodies to [[unemployment|unemployed]] people. In the United States, benefits are funded by a compulsory governmental insurance system, not taxes on individual citizens. Depending on the jurisdiction and the status of the person, those sums may be small, covering only basic needs, or may compensate the lost time proportionally to the previous earned salary.\n\nUnemployment benefits are generally given only to those registering as unemployed, and often on conditions ensuring that they seek work and do not currently have a job, and are validated as being laid off and not fired for cause in most states.\n\nUnemployment benefit is commonly referred to as \"the dole\"; to receive the benefit is to be \"on the dole\". \"Dole\" here is an archaic expression meaning \"one's allotted portion\", from the synonymous [[Old English]] word ''d\u0101l''.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dole|title=Definition of DOLE|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:National-insurance-act-1911.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Leaflet promoting the [[National Insurance Act 1911]].]]\nThe first modern unemployment benefit scheme was introduced in the [[United Kingdom]] with the [[National Insurance Act 1911]], under the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] government of [[H. H. Asquith]]. The popular measures were to combat the increasing influence of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] among the country's working-class population. The Act gave the British working classes a contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment. It only applied to wage earners, however, and their families and the unwaged had to rely on other sources of support, if any.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/national-health-insurance.htm The Cabinet Papers 1915\u20131982: National Health Insurance Act 1911.] The National Archives, 2013. Retrieved 30 June 2013.</ref> Key figures in the implementation of the Act included [[Robert Laurie Morant]], and William Braithwaite.\n\nBy the time of its implementation, the benefit was criticized by communists, who thought such insurance would prevent workers from starting a revolution, while employers and [[Tory|tories]] saw it as a \"necessary evil\".<ref name=\"bogardus\">{{cite book|last1=Bogardus|first1=Emory S.|authorlink1=Emory S. Bogardus|title=Sociology|date=1950|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|The Macmillan Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|page=424|edition=3rd|chapter=Group Disorganization}}</ref>\n\nThe scheme was based on [[actuary|actuarial]] principles and it was funded by a fixed amount each from workers, employers, and taxpayers. It was restricted to particular industries, particularly more volatile ones like shipbuilding, and did not make provision for any dependants. After one week of unemployment, the worker was eligible for receiving 7 shillings/week for up to 15 weeks in a year. By 1913, 2.3 million were insured under the scheme for unemployment benefit.\n\n===Expansion and spread===\nThe [[Unemployment Insurance Act 1920]] created the dole system of payments for unemployed workers.<ref>{{cite book|author=W. R. Garside|title=British Unemployment 1919\u20131939: A Study in Public Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TIp3oq398IC&pg=PA37|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=37|isbn=9780521892544}}</ref> The dole system provided 39 weeks of unemployment benefits to over 11 million workers\u2014practically the entire civilian working population except domestic service, farmworkers, railroad men, and civil servants.\n\nUnemployment benefits were introduced in Germany in 1927, and in most European countries in the period after the [[Second World War]] with the expansion of the [[welfare state]]. Unemployment insurance in the United States originated in [[Wisconsin]] in 1932.<ref name=\"UNEMPLOY 213\">{{cite book |last=Zimmerman |first=Joseph F. |title= ''State and Local Government'' |year= 1970 |publisher= [[Barnes & Noble]] |location=New York, NY |isbn= | pages=213}}</ref> Through the [[Social Security Act]] of 1935, the [[federal government of the United States]] effectively encouraged the individual states to adopt unemployment insurance plans.\n\n==Unemployment benefit systems by country==\n===Argentina===\nIn [[Argentina]], successive administrations have used a variety of passive and active labour market interventions to protect workers against the consequences of economic shocks. The government's key institutional response to combat the increase in [[poverty]] and unemployment created by the crisis{{clarify|which crisis? when?|date=November 2017}} was the launch of an active unemployment assistance programme called Plan Jefas y Jefes de Hogar Desocupados (Program for Unemployed Heads of Households).\n\n===Australia===\n{{Main|Social Security (Australia)}}\nIn [[Australia]], social security benefits, including unemployment benefits, are funded through the taxation system. There is no compulsory national unemployment insurance fund. Rather, benefits are funded in the annual Federal Budget by the National Treasury and are administrated and distributed throughout the nation by the government agency, [[Centrelink]]. Benefit rates are indexed to the Consumer Price Index and are adjusted twice a year according to inflation or deflation.\n\nThere are two types of payment available to those experiencing unemployment. The first, called Youth Allowance, is paid to young people aged 16\u201320 (or 15, if deemed to meet the criteria for being considered 'independent' by Centrelink). Youth Allowance is also paid to full-time students aged 16\u201324, and to full-time Australian Apprenticeship workers aged 16\u201324. People aged below 18 who have not completed their high school education, are usually required to be in full-time education, undertaking an apprenticeship or doing training to be eligible for Youth Allowance. For single people under 18 years of age living with a parent or parents, the basic rate is [[Australian dollar|A$]]91.60 per week. For over-18- to 20-year-olds living at home this increases to A$110.15 per week. For those aged 18\u201320 not living at home the rate is A$167.35 per week. There are special rates for those with partners and/or children.\n\nThe second kind of payment is called Newstart Allowance and is paid to unemployed people over the age of 21 and under the pension eligibility age. To receive a Newstart payment, recipients must be unemployed, be prepared to enter into an Employment Pathway Plan (previously called an Activity Agreement) by which they agree to undertake certain activities to increase their opportunities for employment, be Australian Residents and satisfy the income test (which limits weekly income to A$32 per week before benefits begin to reduce, until one's income reaches A$397.42 per week at which point no unemployment benefits are paid) and the assets test (an eligible recipient can have assets of up to A$161,500 if he or she owns a home before the allowance begins to reduce and $278,500 if he or she does do not own a home). The rate of Newstart allowance as of 12 January 2010 for single people without children is A$228 per week, paid fortnightly. (This does not include supplemental payments such as Rent Assistance.) Different rates apply to people with partners and/or children.\n\nEffectively, people have had to survive on $39 a day from Newstart since 1994, and there have been calls to raise this by politicians and NGO groups.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.9news.com.au/national/2018/05/09/14/31/john-howard-joins-calls-for-newstart-boost | title=John Howard joins calls for Newstart boost \u2013 9News}}</ref>\n\nThe system in Australia is designed to support recipients no matter how long they have been unemployed. In recent years the former [[Australian Liberal Party|Coalition]] government under [[John Howard]] has increased the requirements of the Activity Agreement, providing for controversial schemes such as [[Work for the Dole]], which requires that people on benefits for 6 months or longer work voluntarily for a community organisation regardless of whether such work increases their skills or job prospects. Since the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government under [[Kevin Rudd]] was elected in 2008, the length of unemployment before one is required to fulfill the requirements of the Activity Agreement (which has been renamed the Employment Pathway Plan) has increased from six to twelve months. There are other options available as alternatives to the Work for the Dole scheme, such as undertaking part-time work or study and training, the basic premise of the Employment Pathway Plan being to keep the welfare recipient active and involved in seeking full-time work.\n\nFor people renting their accommodation, unemployment benefits are supplemented by Rent Assistance, which, for single people as at 29 June 2012, begins to be paid when weekly rent is more than A$53.40. Rent Assistance is paid as a proportion of total rent paid (75 cents per dollar paid over $53.40 up to the maximum). The maximum amount of rent assistance payable is A$60.10 per week, and is paid when the total weekly rent exceeds A$133.54 per week. Different rates apply to people with partners and/or children, or who are sharing accommodation.\n\nExternal links\n* [http://www.centrelink.gov.au Centrelink web-site]\n* [http://www.humanservices.gov.au Department of Human Services web-site]\n\n===Canada===\n {{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 500\n | footer =\n | image1 = Employment insurance beneficiaries.svg\n | alt1 = Employment insurance beneficiaries\n | caption1 = Evolution of the number of EI beneficiaries in Canada by month since 1997.\n | image2 = Evolution of Employment Insurance premium rate in Canada.svg\n | alt2 = Evolution of Employment Insurance premium rate in Canada\n | caption2 = Evolution since 1972 of Employment Insurance (UI before 1996) contribution rate '''for employees''' as a % of insurable earnings.

Formally called \"Unemployment Insurance\", the name was changed in 1996. In 2019, Canadian workers pay premiums of 1.62%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/pyrll/clcltng/ei/cnt-chrt-pf-eng.html|title=EI premium rates and maximums|last=|first=|date=January 2005|website=|publisher=Canada Revenue Agency|access-date=2016-09-04}}</ref> of insured earnings in return for benefits if they lose their jobs.\n\nThe [[Employment and Social Insurance Act]] was passed in 1935 during the [[Great Depression]] by the government of [[R.B. Bennett]] as an attempted Canadian unemployment insurance programme. It was, however, ruled unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] as unemployment was judged to be an insurance matter falling under provincial responsibility. After a constitutional amendment was agreed to by all of the provinces, a reference to \"Unemployment Insurance\" was added to the matters falling under federal authority under the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], and the first Canadian system was adopted in 1940. Because of these problems Canada was the last major Western country to bring in an employment insurance system. It was extended dramatically by [[Pierre Trudeau]] in 1971 making it much easier to get. The system was sometimes called the 10/42, because one had to work for 10 weeks to get benefits for the other 42 weeks of the year. It was also in 1971 that the UI program was first opened up to maternity and sickness benefits, for 15 weeks in each case.\n\nThe generosity of the Canadian UI programme was progressively reduced after the adoption of the 1971 UI Act. At the same time, the federal government gradually reduced its financial contribution, eliminating it entirely by 1990. The EI system was again cut by the Progressive Conservatives in 1990 and 1993, then by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] in 1994 and 1996. Amendments made it harder to qualify by increasing the time needed to be worked, although seasonal claimants (who work long hours over short periods) turned out to gain from the replacement, in 1996, of weeks by hours to qualify. The ratio of beneficiaries to unemployed, after having stood at around 40% for many years, rose somewhat during the 2009 recession but then fell back again to the low 40s.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/jobs/ei/reports/mar2012/index.shtml |title= 2012 EI Monitoring and Assessment Report (Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, March 2013)|date= 2014-09-25}}</ref> Some unemployed persons are not covered for benefits (e.g. self-employed workers), while others may have exhausted their benefits, did not work long enough to qualify, or quit or were dismissed from their job. The length of time one could take EI has also been cut repeatedly. The 1994 and 1996 changes contributed to a sharp fall in Liberal support in the Atlantic provinces in the [[1997 Canadian federal election|1997 election]].\n\nIn 2001, the federal government increased parental leave from 10 to 35 weeks, which was added to preexisting maternity benefits of 15 weeks. In 2004, it allowed workers to take EI for compassionate care leave while caring for a dying relative, although the strict conditions imposed make this a little used benefit. In 2006, the Province of Quebec opted out of the federal EI scheme in respect of maternity, parental and adoption benefits, in order to provide more generous benefits for all workers in that province, including self-employed workers. Total EI spending was $19.677 billion for 2011\u20132012 (figures in [[Canadian dollar]]s).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/recgen/cpc-pac/2012/index-eng.html |title= Public Accounts of Canada for 2012}}</ref>\n\nEmployers contribute 1.4 times the amount of employee premiums. Since 1990, there is no government contribution to this fund. The amount a person receives and how long they can stay on EI varies with their previous salary, how long they were working, and the unemployment rate in their area. The EI system is managed by [[Service Canada]], a service delivery network reporting to the Minister of [[Employment and Social Development Canada]].\n\nA bit over half of EI benefits are paid in Ontario and the Western provinces but EI is especially important in the Atlantic provinces, which have higher rates of unemployment. Many Atlantic workers are also employed in seasonal work such as fishing, forestry or tourism and go on EI over the winter when there is no work. There are special rules for fishermen making it easier for them to collect EI. EI also pays for [[Parental leave|maternity and parental leave]], [[compassionate care leave]], and illness coverage. The programme also pays for retraining programmes (EI Part II) through labour market agreements with the Canadian provinces.\n\nA significant part of the federal fiscal surplus of the [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] and [[Paul Martin]] years came from the EI system. Premiums were reduced much less than falling expenditures \u2013 producing, from 1994 onwards, EI surpluses of several billion dollars per year, which were added to general government revenue.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.actuaries.ca/members/publications/2007/207111e.pdf |title= A Look Back and A Way Forward: Actuarial Views on the Future of the Employment Insurance System, page 14(Canadian Institute of Actuaries, Nov. 2007)}}</ref> The cumulative EI surplus stood at $57 billion at 31 March 2008,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/recgen/pdf/49-eng.pdf |title= Public Accounts of Canada, 2008, page 4.16}}</ref> nearly four times the amount needed to cover the extra costs paid during a recession.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.actuaries.ca/members/publications/2007/207111e.pdf |title= A Look Back and A Way Forward: Actuarial Views on the Future of the Employment Insurance System, page 8 (Canadian Institute of Actuaries, Nov. 2007)}}</ref> This drew criticism from Opposition parties and from business and labour groups, and has remained a recurring issue of the public debate.

Unionization rates are high (70%), and union membership comes with membership in an unemployment fund. Additionally, there are non-union unemployment funds. Usually, benefits require 26 weeks of 18 hours per week on average, and the unemployment benefit is 60% of the salary and lasts for 500 days.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preconditions of earnings-related daily allowancet|url=http://en.ytk.fi/benefits-abc/preconditions-of-earnings-related-daily-allowance/other-preconditions|publisher=YTK|accessdate=19 May 2015}}</ref> When this is not available, Kela can pay either regular unemployment benefit or labor market subsidy benefits. The former requires a degree and two years of full-time work. The latter requires participation in training, education, or other employment support, which may be mandated on pain of losing the benefit, but may be paid after the regular benefits have been either maxed out or not available.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unemployment|url=http://www.kela.fi/in/internet/english.nsf/NET/081101150015EH?OpenDocument|publisher=KELA|accessdate=26 April 2012}}</ref> Although the unemployment funds handle the payments, most of the funding is from taxes and compulsory tax-like unemployment insurance charges.\n\nRegardless of whether benefits are paid by Kela or from an unemployment fund, the unemployed person receives assistance from the ''Ty\u00f6- ja elinkeinokeskus'' (''TE-keskus'', or the \"Work and Livelihood Centre\"), a government agency which helps people to find jobs and employers to find workers. In order to be considered unemployed, the seeker must register at the TE-keskus as unemployed. If the jobseeker does not have degree, the agency can require the job seeker to apply to a school.\n\nIf the individual does not qualify for any unemployment benefit he may still be eligible for the housing benefit (''asumistuki'') from Kela and municipal social welfare provisions (''toimeentulotuki''). They are not unemployment benefits and depend on household income, but they have in practice become the basic income of many long-term unemployed.\n\n===France===\n{{Main|Unemployment benefits in France}}\n[[France]] uses a quasi [[Ghent system]], under which unemployment benefits are distributed by an independent agency (UNEDIC) in which [[trade union|unions]] and Employer organisations are equally represented.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/15/which-best-countries-live-unemployed-disabled-benefits|title=Which are the best countries in the world to live in if you are unemployed or disabled?|last=Penketh|first=Anne|date=2015-04-15|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-03-29|last2=Connolly|first2=Kate|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Kirchgaessner|first3=Stephanie|last4=McDonald|first4=Henry|last5=McCurry|first5=Justin|last6=Crouch|first6=David|last7=Walker|first7=Shaun|last8=Smith|first8=David|last9=O'Hara|first9=Mary}}</ref> UNEDIC is responsible for 3 benefits: ARE, ACA and ASR The main ARE scheme requires a minimum of 122 days membership in the preceding 24 months and certain other requirements before any claims can be made. Employers pay a contribution on top of the pre-tax income of their employees, which together with the employee contribution, fund the scheme.\n\nThe maximum unemployment benefit is (as of March 2009) 57.4% of [[EUR]] 162 per day (Social security contributions ceiling in 2011), or 6900 euros per month.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} http://www.pole-emploi.fr/candidat/le-montant-de-votre-allocation-@/suarticle.jspz?id=4125</ref> Claimants receive 57,4% of their average daily salary of the last 12 months preceding unemployment with the average amount being 1,111 euros per month.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} http://entreprise.lefigaro.fr/chomeurs-unedic.html</ref> In France tax and other payroll taxes are paid on unemployment benefits. In 2011 claimants received the allowance for an average 291 days.\n\n===Germany===\n[[Germany]] has two different types of unemployment benefits.\n\n====Unemployment benefit I====\n\nThe ''unemployment benefit I'' in [[Germany]] is also known as the unemployment insurance. The insurance is administered by the federal employment agency and funded by employee and employer contributions. This in stark contrast to FUTA in the US and other systems; where only employers make contributions. Participation (and thus contributions) are generally mandatory for both employee and employer.\n\nAll workers with a regular employment contract (''abh\u00e4ngig Besch\u00e4ftigte''), except freelancers and certain civil servants (''Beamte''), contribute to the system. Since 2006, certain previously excluded workers have been able to opt into the system on a voluntary basis.\n\nThe system is financed by contributions from employees and employers. Employees pay 1.5% of their gross salary below the social security threshold and employers pay 1.5% contribution on top of the salary paid to the employee. The contribution level was reduced from 3.25% for employees and employers as part of labour market reforms known as Hartz. Contributions are paid only on earnings up to the social security ceiling (2012: 5,600 EUR).\n\nThe system is largely self-financed but also receives a subsidy from the state to run the Jobcenters.\n\nUnemployed workers are entitled to:\n* Living allowance known as unemployment benefit\n* Help in finding work\n* Training\n\nThe unemployed benefit is paid to workers who have contributed at least during 12 months preceding their loss of a job. The allowance is paid for half of the period that the worker has contributed. Claimants get 60% of their previous net salary (capped at the social security ceiling), or 67% for claimants with children. The maximum benefit is therefore 2964 Euros (in 2012).\nIn 2011 the federal Work Agency had revenues and expenses of 37.5 bn EUR.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arbeitsagentur.de/zentraler-Content/Veroeffentlichungen/Intern/Geschaeftsbericht-2011.pdf |title=Unsere Ver\u00f6ffentlichungen \u2013 Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit |accessdate=2012-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531155700/http://www.arbeitsagentur.de/zentraler-Content/Veroeffentlichungen/Intern/Geschaeftsbericht-2011.pdf |archivedate=31 May 2012 |df=dmy-all |language=de}}</ref>\n\nAfter a change in German law effective since 2008, provided their job history qualifies them, benefit recipients aged 50 to 54 now receive an unemployment benefit for 15 months, those 55 to 57 for 18 months and those 58 or older receive benefits for 24 months. For those under the age of 50 who have not been employed for more than 30 months in a job which paid into the social security scheme, full unemployment benefit can be received for a maximum period of 12 months. Note how the duration of eligibility is variegated in Germany to account for the difficulty older people have re-entering the job market.\n\n====Unemployment benefit II====\n{{Main|Hartz concept}}\n{{lang|de|Arbeitslosengeld II}} is a second tier, open-ended welfare programme intended to ensure people do not fall into penury.\n\n* In order to be eligible, a person has to permanently reside in Germany, be in possession of a work permit, and be fit for work, i.e. can principally work at least three hours a day. The goal of the programme is to terminate one's dependence on it (welfare-to-work).

Other measures are:\n* Redundancy Fund (''Cassa integrazione guadagni'', or CIG): cash benefits provided as [[shock absorbers]] to those workers who are suspended or who work only for reduced time due to temporary difficulties of their factories, aiming to help the factories in financial difficulties, by relieving them from the costs of unused workforce\n* Solidarity Contracts (''Contratti di solidariet\u00e0''): in the same cases granting CIG benefits, companies can sign contracts with reduced work time, to avoid dismissing redundancy workers. The state will grant to those workers the 60% of the lost part of the wage.\n* Mobility allowances (''Indennit\u00e0 di mobilit\u00e0''),: if the Redundancy Fund does not allow the company to re-establish a good financial situation, the workers can be entitled to mobility allowances. Other companies are provided [[incentive]]s for employing them. This measure has been abolished in 2012 and will stop working in 2017.\nIn the Italian unemployment insurance system all the measures are [[income]]-related, and they have an average [[decommodification]] level. The basis for entitlement is always [[employment]], with more specific conditions for each case, and the provider is quite always the state.

Workers insured by the IMSS who are unemployed may withdraw a maximum of 30 days' worth of pension savings every five years.<ref name=careeraddict/> However, this does not cover the majority of workers, as 58% of the labor force is in the informal sector.\n* National Employment Service \u2013 This agency, which has 165 offices nationwide, offers financial support in learning new skills to those aged 16 and above who are unemployed or underemployed, and assistance in finding new jobs in the form of information on vacancies and job fairs.<ref name=careeraddict/>\n* Temporary Employment Program \u2013 This scheme is designed to aid unemployed people who live in rural areas with high unemployment rates, any area undergoing a financial crisis, or an area that has been hit by a natural disaster or some other kind of emergency. The program funds projects to boost employment by hiring local workers aged 16 and above in jobs such as building infrastructure and promoting development, and conserving the environment and cultural heritage sites. They are paid a salary at 99% of the local minimum wage for a maximum of 132 days a year.<ref name=careeraddict/>\n* Income Generating Options Program \u2013 People living in poverty in an area of up to a maximum of 15,000 inhabitants are eligible for funding for projects to generate income for themselves.<ref name=careeraddict/>\n\n===Netherlands===\nUnemployment benefits in the Netherlands were introduced in 1949. Separate schemes exist for mainland Netherlands and for the [[Caribbean Netherlands]].\n\nThe scheme in mainland Netherlands entails that, according to the Werkloosheidswet (Unemployment Law, WW), employers are responsible for paying the contributions to the scheme, which are deducted from the salary received by the employees. In 2012 the contribution was 4.55% of gross salary up to a ceiling of 4,172 euros per month. The first 1,435.75 euros of an employee's gross salaries are not subject to the 4.55% contribution.\n\nBenefits are paid for a maximum period of 38 months and claimants get 75% of last salary for 2 months and 70% thereafter with a maximum benefit of 3128 euros, depending on how long the claimant has been employed previously. Workers older than 50 years who are unemployed for over 2 months are entitled to a special benefit called the IOAW, if they do not receive the regular unemployment benefit (WW).\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{Main|Social welfare in New Zealand}}\nIn [[New Zealand]], Jobseeker Support, previously known as the Unemployment Benefit and also known as \"the dole\" provides income support for people who are looking for work or training for work. It is one of a number of benefits administered by [[Work and Income]], a service of the Ministry of Social Development.\n\nTo get this benefit, a person must meet the conditions and obligations specified in section 88A to 123D Social Security Act 1964. These conditions and obligations cover things such as age, residency status, and availability to work.<ref>[http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/manuals-and-procedures/income_support/main_benefits/unemployment_benefit/unemployment_benefit.htm Unemployment Benefit] Manuals and Procedures \u2013 Work and Income website</ref>\n\nThe amount that is paid depends on things such as the person's age, income, marital status and whether they have children. It is adjusted annually on 1 April and in response to changes in legislature. Some examples of the maximum after tax weekly rate at 1 April 2019 are:\n* $200.80 For a single person aged 20\u201324 years without children\n* $210.13 for a single person 25 years or over\n* $325.98 for a sole parent\n* $350.20 for a married, de facto or civil union couple with or without children ($167.83 each).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/individuals/forms-and-brochures/benefit-rates-april-2011.html|title=Work and Income Unemployment Benefit Rates|publisher=}}</ref>\n*Plus winter payments of extra $20 a week\n\nMore information about this benefit and the amounts paid are on the Work and Income website.<ref>[http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/individuals/a-z-benefits/unemployment-benefit.html Unemployment Benefit] Work and Income website</ref>\n\nExternal links\n* [http://www.workandincome.govt.nz Work and Income website]\n* [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1964/0136/latest/DLM359107.html Social Security Act 1964]\n\n===Poland===\n{{see also|Unemployment in Poland|Welfare in Poland}}\nIn [[Poland]], the system is designed to prevent people from living off unemployment benefits long term, thus forcing them to work or rely on non-state means of support (family, charities). In order to claim any state unemployment support, an adult (18+) claimant has to prove at least one year of continuous, full employment (that is, minimum 40 hours a week/160 hours a month) in the last 18 months prior to registering with the Unemployment Bureau. If approved, as of 2019, one is granted 848 z\u0142 (224.25 US$ in April 2019) {{em|before taxes}} on a month-to-month basis for the first 3 months, then the amount is automatically lowered to 666 z\u0142 (176.20 US$ in April 2019) {{em|before taxes}} for the remaining 3\u20139 months. Therefore, if approved, one can claim unemployment benefits only to the maximum of 12 continuous months. However, during that period, one has to cooperate with the Unemployment Bureau in finding an employment under the strict guidelines of losing the unemployed status, and thus the benefits. In comparison to the unemployment benefits paid by the state, as of January 2019, the [[Minimum wage|minimum monthly pay]] is 2250,00<ref>\"Rz\u0105d podnosi pensj\u0119 minimaln\u0105.

Benefits are managed by the State Public Employment Agency (SEPE). The basis for entitlement is having contributed for a minimum period during the time preceding unemployment, with further conditions that may be applicable. The system comprises contributory benefits and non-contributory benefits.\n\nContributory benefits are payable to those unemployed persons with a minimum of 12 months' contributions over a period of 6 years preceding unemployment. The benefit is payable for 1/3 of the contribution period. The benefit amount is 70% of the legal reference salary plus additional amounts for persons with dependants. The benefit reduces to 60% of the reference salary after 6 months. The minimum benefit is 497 euros per month and the maximum is 1087.20 euros per month for a single person.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ayudasparados.com/importe-maximo-desempleo-2012/105|title=importe maximo desempleo 2018 \u2013 Ayudas a Parados|website=www.ayudasparados.com}}</ref> The non-contributory allowance is available to those persons who are no longer entitled to the contributory pension and who do not have income above 75% of the national minimum wage.\n\n===Sweden===\n{{Main|Unemployment benefits in Sweden}}\n[[Sweden]] uses the [[Ghent system]], under which a significant proportion of unemployment benefits are distributed by [[trade union|union]] unemployment funds. Unemployment benefits are divided into a voluntary scheme with income related compensation up to a certain level and a comprehensive scheme that provides a lower level of basic support. The voluntary scheme requires a minimum of 12 months membership and 6 months employment during that time before any claims can be made. Employers pay a fee on top of the pre-tax income of their employees, which together with membership fees, fund the scheme (see [[Unemployment funds in Sweden]]).\n\nThe maximum unemployment benefit is (as of July 2016) [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 980 per day. During the first 200 days, the unemployed will receive 80% of his or her normal income during the last 12 months. From day 201\u2013300 this goes down to 70% and from day 301\u2013450 the insurance covers 65% of the normal income (only available for parents to children under the age of 18). In Sweden tax is paid on unemployment benefits, so the unemployed will get a maximum of about SEK 10,000 per month during the first 100 days (depending on the [[municipality]] tax rate). In other currencies, as of June 2017, this means a maximum of approximately \u00a3900, $1,150, or [[\u20ac]]1,000, each month after tax. Private insurance is also available, mainly through professional organisations, to provide income-related compensation that otherwise exceeds the ceiling of the scheme. The comprehensive scheme is funded by tax.\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\n[[Saudi Arabia]] is an economic [[welfare state]] with free medical care<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.gov.sa/Detail.asp?InSectionID=1516&InNewsItemID=1746|title=Request Rejected|website=www.mofa.gov.sa}}</ref> and unemployment benefits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://saudinf.com/main/h814.htm|title=Social Services (2) \u2013 SAMIRAD (Saudi Arabia Market Information Resource)|website=saudinf.com}}</ref> However, the country relies not on taxation but mainly [[oil]] revenues to maintain the social and economic services to its populace.\n\nPayment:\n2000 SAR (US$534) for only 12 months for an unemployed person from ages 18\u201335\n\nExternal links\n* [http://saudinf.com/main/h814.htm Social Services of Saudi Arabia]\n\n===Turkey===\nBy law, legally employed workers, regardless of their citizenship are eligible for unemployment benefits given that they are at least 18 years old, the employees contribute 1% to unemployment funds while the employers contribute 2%, and the workers are eligible to receive benefits after 600 days of contributions within the preceding 3 years of employment. the benefit payment is 50% for the average daily earnings based on the last 4 months and cannot be higher than the minimum wage (per industry).

One common criticism of unemployment insurance is that it induces [[moral hazard]], the fact that unemployment insurance lowers on-the-job effort and reduces job-search effort.\n\n===Macroeconomic function===\nTo Keynesians, unemployment insurance acts as an [[automatic stabilizer]].<ref>{{citation| url= http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/1999/199964/199964pap.pdf |last1= Cohen| first1= Darrel| first2= Glenn| last2= Follette| title= The Automatic Fiscal Stabilizers: Quietly Doing Their Thing| location= Washington, DC| publisher= Divisions of Research & Statistics and Monetary Affairs, [[Federal Reserve Board]]| year= 1999}}</ref> Benefits automatically increase when unemployment is high and fall when unemployment is low, smoothing the business cycle; however, others claim that the taxation necessary to support this system serves to decrease employment.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Adverse selection===\n[[Adverse selection]] refers to the fact that \u201cworkers who have the highest probability of becoming unemployed have the highest demand for unemployment insurance.\u201d<ref name=\"UNEMPLOY 215\">{{cite book|title=''Public Finance''|last=Rosen|first=Harvey S.|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-351128-3|location=New York, New York|pages=292|via=}}</ref> Adverse selection causes profit maximizing private insurance agencies to set high premiums for the insurance because there is a high likelihood they will have to make payments to the policyholder. High premiums work to exclude many individuals who otherwise might purchase the insurance. \u201cA compulsory government program avoids the adverse selection problem. Hence, government provision of UI has the potential to increase efficiency. However, government provision does not eliminate moral hazard.\u201d<ref name=\"UNEMPLOY 215\"/>\n\n====Moral hazard====\n\u201cAt the same time, those workers who managed to obtain insurance might experience more unemployment otherwise would have been the case.\u201d<ref name=\"UNEMPLOY 215\"/> The private insurance company would have to determine whether the employee is unemployed through no fault of their own, which is difficult to determine. Incorrect determinations could result in the payout of significant amounts for fraudulent claims or alternately failure to pay legitimate claims. This leads to the rationale that if government could solve either problem that government intervention would increase efficiency.\n\n====Unemployment insurance effect on unemployment====\nIn the [[Great Recession]], the \u201cmoral hazard\u201d issue of whether unemployment insurance\u2014and specifically extending benefits past the maximum 99 weeks\u2014significantly encourages unemployment by discouraging workers from finding and taking jobs was expressed by Republican legislators. Conservative economist Robert Barro found that benefits raised the unemployment rate 2%.<ref>Robert Barro, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703959704575454431457720188 \"The Folly of Subsidizing Unemployment\"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', 30 August 2010.</ref><ref name=Zuylen-Wood/> Disagreeing with Barro's study were Berkeley economist [[Jesse Rothstein]], who found the \u201cvast majority\u201d of unemployment was due to \u201cdemand shocks\u201d not \u201c[unemployment insurance]-induced supply reductions.\u201d<ref name=Zuylen-Wood>[http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-cohn/97971/would-extending-unemployment-benefits-increase-unemployment Would Extending Unemployment Benefits Increase Unemployment?].

That is, the cost to the employer in increased taxes is less than the benefits that would be paid to the employee upon layoff. The firm in this instance believes that it is more cost effective to lay off the employee, causing more unemployment than under perfect experience rating.<ref name=\"UNEMPLOY 215\"/>\n\n====Unemployment insurance effect on employment====\nAn alternative rationale for unemployment insurance is that it may allow for improving the quality of matches between workers and firms. Marimon and Zilibotti argued that although a more generous unemployment benefit system may indeed increase the unemployment rate, it may also help improve the average match quality.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1468-0297.00432 | volume=109 | issue=455 | title=Unemployment vs. Mismatch of Talents: Reconsidering Unemployment Benefits | year=1999 | journal=The Economic Journal | pages=266\u2013291 | last1 = Marimon | first1 = Ramon | hdl=10230/640 | url=https://econ-papers.upf.edu/papers/211.pdf }}</ref> A similar point is made by Mazur who analyzed the welfare and inequality effects of a policy reform giving entitlement for unemployment insurance to quitters.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.07.001 |title=Can welfare abuse be welfare improving? |journal=Journal of Public Economics |volume=141 |pages=11\u201328 |year=2016 |last1=Mazur |first1=Karol |hdl=1814/45326 }}</ref> Arash Nekoei and Andrea Weber present empirical evidence from Austria that extending unemployment benefit duration raises wages by improving reemployment firm quality.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1257/aer.20150528 | volume=107 | issue=2 | title=Does Extending Unemployment Benefits Improve Job Quality? | year=2017 | journal=American Economic Review | pages=527\u2013561 | last1 = Nekoei | first1 = Arash| hdl=10419/110757 | url=https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/110757/1/dp9034.pdf }}</ref> Similarly, Tatsiramos studied data from European countries and found that although unemployment insurance does increase unemployment duration, the duration of subsequent employment tends to be longer (suggesting better match quality).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1162/JEEA.2009.7.6.1225 | volume=7 | issue=6 | title=Unemployment Insurance in Europe: Unemployment Duration and Subsequent Employment Stability | year=2009 | journal=Journal of the European Economic Association | pages=1225\u20131260 | last1 = Tatsiramos | first1 = Konstantinos| hdl=10419/33875 | url=https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/33875/1/516439251.pdf }}</ref>\n\n====Effect on state budgets====\nAnother issue with unemployment insurance relates to its effects on state budgets. During recessionary time periods, the number of unemployed rises and they begin to draw benefits from the program. The longer the recession lasts, depending on the state's starting UI program balance, the quicker the state begins to run out of funds. The recession that began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009 significantly impacted state budgets. According to The Council of State Governments, by 18 March 2011, 32 states plus the Virgin Islands had borrowed nearly $45.7 billion. The Labor Department estimates by the fourth quarter of 2013, as many as 40 states may need to borrow more than $90 billion to fund their unemployment programs and it will take a decade or more to pay off the debt.<ref>[http://knowledgecenter.csg.org/drupal/content/state-unemployment-insurance-trust-funds-march-2011-update Unemployment Insurance Trust Funds Update] ''Council of State Governments''</ref>\n\n====Insurance funds====\nPossible policy options for states to shore up the unemployment insurance funds include lowering benefits for recipients and/or raising taxes on businesses. Kentucky took the approach of raising taxes and lowering benefits to attempt to balance its unemployment insurance program. Starting in 2010, a claimant's weekly benefits will decrease from 68% to 62% and the taxable wage base will increase from $8,000 to $12,000, over a ten-year period. These moves are estimated to save the state over $450 million.<ref>[http://migration.kentucky.gov/Newsroom/governor/20100615unempins.htm] ''Kentucky.gov''</ref>\n\n====Job sharing / short-time working====\n[[Job sharing]] or work sharing and [[short time]] or short-time working refer to situations or systems in which employees agree to or are forced to accept a reduction in working time and pay. These can be based on individual agreements or on government programs in many countries that try to prevent unemployment. In these, employers have the option of reducing work hours to part-time for many employees instead of laying off some of them and retaining only full-time workers. For example, employees in 27 states of the United States can then receive unemployment payments for the hours they are no longer working.<ref>[https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/pdf/uilawcompar/2019/special.pdf] ''U.S. Department of Labor, Comparison of State Unemployment Insurance Laws tbl. 4-5 (2019).''</ref>\n\n==International Labour Convention==\n[[International Labour Organization]] has adopted the [[Employment Promotion and Protection against Unemployment Convention, 1988]] for promotion of [[employment]] against unemployment and [[social security]] including unemployment benefit.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Unemployment extension]]\n* [[Social rights]]\n* [[HIRE Act]]\n* [[Reserve army of labour]]\n* [[Involuntary unemployment]]\n* [[Labor power|Labour power]]\n* [[Compensation of employees]]\n* [[Lorenz curve]]\n* [[Social insurance]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n* Bojas George J., ''Labor Economics'', Second edition, 2002, [[McGraw-Hill]].\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite encyclopedia |last1=Francis |first1=David R.  |editor= [[David R.

Unemployment insurance in the United States originated in [[Wisconsin]] in 1932.<ref name=\"UNEMPLOY 213\">{{cite book |last=Zimmerman |first=Joseph F. |title= ''State and Local Government'' |year= 1970 |publisher= [[Barnes & Noble]] |location=New York, NY |isbn= | pages=213}}</ref> Through the [[Social Security Act]] of 1935, the [[federal government of the United States]] effectively encouraged the individual states to adopt unemployment insurance plans.\n\n==Unemployment benefit systems by country==\n===Argentina===\nIn [[Argentina]], successive administrations have used a variety of passive and active labour market interventions to protect workers against the consequences of economic shocks. The government's key institutional response to combat the increase in [[poverty]] and unemployment created by the crisis{{clarify|which crisis? when?|date=November 2017}} was the launch of an active unemployment assistance programme called Plan Jefas y Jefes de Hogar Desocupados (Program for Unemployed Heads of Households).\n\n===Australia===\n{{Main|Social Security (Australia)}}\nIn [[Australia]], social security benefits, including unemployment benefits, are funded through the taxation system. There is no compulsory national unemployment insurance fund. Rather, benefits are funded in the annual Federal Budget by the National Treasury and are administrated and distributed throughout the nation by the government agency, [[Centrelink]]. Benefit rates are indexed to the Consumer Price Index and are adjusted twice a year according to inflation or deflation.\n\nThere are two types of payment available to those experiencing unemployment. The first, called Youth Allowance, is paid to young people aged 16\u201320 (or 15, if deemed to meet the criteria for being considered 'independent' by Centrelink). Youth Allowance is also paid to full-time students aged 16\u201324, and to full-time Australian Apprenticeship workers aged 16\u201324. People aged below 18 who have not completed their high school education, are usually required to be in full-time education, undertaking an apprenticeship or doing training to be eligible for Youth Allowance. For single people under 18 years of age living with a parent or parents, the basic rate is [[Australian dollar|A$]]91.60 per week. For over-18- to 20-year-olds living at home this increases to A$110.15 per week. For those aged 18\u201320 not living at home the rate is A$167.35 per week. There are special rates for those with partners and/or children.\n\nThe second kind of payment is called Newstart Allowance and is paid to unemployed people over the age of 21 and under the pension eligibility age. To receive a Newstart payment, recipients must be unemployed, be prepared to enter into an Employment Pathway Plan (previously called an Activity Agreement) by which they agree to undertake certain activities to increase their opportunities for employment, be Australian Residents and satisfy the income test (which limits weekly income to A$32 per week before benefits begin to reduce, until one's income reaches A$397.42 per week at which point no unemployment benefits are paid) and the assets test (an eligible recipient can have assets of up to A$161,500 if he or she owns a home before the allowance begins to reduce and $278,500 if he or she does do not own a home). The rate of Newstart allowance as of 12 January 2010 for single people without children is A$228 per week, paid fortnightly. (This does not include supplemental payments such as Rent Assistance.) Different rates apply to people with partners and/or children.\n\nEffectively, people have had to survive on $39 a day from Newstart since 1994, and there have been calls to raise this by politicians and NGO groups.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.9news.com.au/national/2018/05/09/14/31/john-howard-joins-calls-for-newstart-boost | title=John Howard joins calls for Newstart boost \u2013 9News}}</ref>\n\nThe system in Australia is designed to support recipients no matter how long they have been unemployed. In recent years the former [[Australian Liberal Party|Coalition]] government under [[John Howard]] has increased the requirements of the Activity Agreement, providing for controversial schemes such as [[Work for the Dole]], which requires that people on benefits for 6 months or longer work voluntarily for a community organisation regardless of whether such work increases their skills or job prospects. Since the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government under [[Kevin Rudd]] was elected in 2008, the length of unemployment before one is required to fulfill the requirements of the Activity Agreement (which has been renamed the Employment Pathway Plan) has increased from six to twelve months. There are other options available as alternatives to the Work for the Dole scheme, such as undertaking part-time work or study and training, the basic premise of the Employment Pathway Plan being to keep the welfare recipient active and involved in seeking full-time work.\n\nFor people renting their accommodation, unemployment benefits are supplemented by Rent Assistance, which, for single people as at 29 June 2012, begins to be paid when weekly rent is more than A$53.40. Rent Assistance is paid as a proportion of total rent paid (75 cents per dollar paid over $53.40 up to the maximum). The maximum amount of rent assistance payable is A$60.10 per week, and is paid when the total weekly rent exceeds A$133.54 per week. Different rates apply to people with partners and/or children, or who are sharing accommodation.\n\nExternal links\n* [http://www.centrelink.gov.au Centrelink web-site]\n* [http://www.humanservices.gov.au Department of Human Services web-site]\n\n===Canada===\n {{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 500\n | footer =\n | image1 = Employment insurance beneficiaries.svg\n | alt1 = Employment insurance beneficiaries\n | caption1 = Evolution of the number of EI beneficiaries in Canada by month since 1997.\n | image2 = Evolution of Employment Insurance premium rate in Canada.svg\n | alt2 = Evolution of Employment Insurance premium rate in Canada\n | caption2 = Evolution since 1972 of Employment Insurance (UI before 1996) contribution rate '''for employees''' as a % of insurable earnings.

Formally called \"Unemployment Insurance\", the name was changed in 1996. In 2019, Canadian workers pay premiums of 1.62%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/pyrll/clcltng/ei/cnt-chrt-pf-eng.html|title=EI premium rates and maximums|last=|first=|date=January 2005|website=|publisher=Canada Revenue Agency|access-date=2016-09-04}}</ref> of insured earnings in return for benefits if they lose their jobs.\n\nThe [[Employment and Social Insurance Act]] was passed in 1935 during the [[Great Depression]] by the government of [[R.B. Bennett]] as an attempted Canadian unemployment insurance programme. It was, however, ruled unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] as unemployment was judged to be an insurance matter falling under provincial responsibility. After a constitutional amendment was agreed to by all of the provinces, a reference to \"Unemployment Insurance\" was added to the matters falling under federal authority under the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], and the first Canadian system was adopted in 1940. Because of these problems Canada was the last major Western country to bring in an employment insurance system. It was extended dramatically by [[Pierre Trudeau]] in 1971 making it much easier to get. The system was sometimes called the 10/42, because one had to work for 10 weeks to get benefits for the other 42 weeks of the year. It was also in 1971 that the UI program was first opened up to maternity and sickness benefits, for 15 weeks in each case.\n\nThe generosity of the Canadian UI programme was progressively reduced after the adoption of the 1971 UI Act. At the same time, the federal government gradually reduced its financial contribution, eliminating it entirely by 1990. The EI system was again cut by the Progressive Conservatives in 1990 and 1993, then by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] in 1994 and 1996. Amendments made it harder to qualify by increasing the time needed to be worked, although seasonal claimants (who work long hours over short periods) turned out to gain from the replacement, in 1996, of weeks by hours to qualify. The ratio of beneficiaries to unemployed, after having stood at around 40% for many years, rose somewhat during the 2009 recession but then fell back again to the low 40s.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/jobs/ei/reports/mar2012/index.shtml |title= 2012 EI Monitoring and Assessment Report (Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, March 2013)|date= 2014-09-25}}</ref> Some unemployed persons are not covered for benefits (e.g. self-employed workers), while others may have exhausted their benefits, did not work long enough to qualify, or quit or were dismissed from their job. The length of time one could take EI has also been cut repeatedly. The 1994 and 1996 changes contributed to a sharp fall in Liberal support in the Atlantic provinces in the [[1997 Canadian federal election|1997 election]].\n\nIn 2001, the federal government increased parental leave from 10 to 35 weeks, which was added to preexisting maternity benefits of 15 weeks. In 2004, it allowed workers to take EI for compassionate care leave while caring for a dying relative, although the strict conditions imposed make this a little used benefit. In 2006, the Province of Quebec opted out of the federal EI scheme in respect of maternity, parental and adoption benefits, in order to provide more generous benefits for all workers in that province, including self-employed workers. Total EI spending was $19.677 billion for 2011\u20132012 (figures in [[Canadian dollar]]s).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/recgen/cpc-pac/2012/index-eng.html |title= Public Accounts of Canada for 2012}}</ref>\n\nEmployers contribute 1.4 times the amount of employee premiums. Since 1990, there is no government contribution to this fund. The amount a person receives and how long they can stay on EI varies with their previous salary, how long they were working, and the unemployment rate in their area. The EI system is managed by [[Service Canada]], a service delivery network reporting to the Minister of [[Employment and Social Development Canada]].\n\nA bit over half of EI benefits are paid in Ontario and the Western provinces but EI is especially important in the Atlantic provinces, which have higher rates of unemployment. Many Atlantic workers are also employed in seasonal work such as fishing, forestry or tourism and go on EI over the winter when there is no work. There are special rules for fishermen making it easier for them to collect EI. EI also pays for [[Parental leave|maternity and parental leave]], [[compassionate care leave]], and illness coverage. The programme also pays for retraining programmes (EI Part II) through labour market agreements with the Canadian provinces.\n\nA significant part of the federal fiscal surplus of the [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] and [[Paul Martin]] years came from the EI system. Premiums were reduced much less than falling expenditures \u2013 producing, from 1994 onwards, EI surpluses of several billion dollars per year, which were added to general government revenue.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.actuaries.ca/members/publications/2007/207111e.pdf |title= A Look Back and A Way Forward: Actuarial Views on the Future of the Employment Insurance System, page 14(Canadian Institute of Actuaries, Nov. 2007)}}</ref> The cumulative EI surplus stood at $57 billion at 31 March 2008,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/recgen/pdf/49-eng.pdf |title= Public Accounts of Canada, 2008, page 4.16}}</ref> nearly four times the amount needed to cover the extra costs paid during a recession.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.actuaries.ca/members/publications/2007/207111e.pdf |title= A Look Back and A Way Forward: Actuarial Views on the Future of the Employment Insurance System, page 8 (Canadian Institute of Actuaries, Nov. 2007)}}</ref> This drew criticism from Opposition parties and from business and labour groups, and has remained a recurring issue of the public debate.

Instead, the Conservative government cancelled the EI surpluses entirely in 2010, and required EI contributors to make up the 2009, 2010 and 2011 annual deficits by increasing EI premiums.

In order to be considered unemployed, the seeker must register at the TE-keskus as unemployed. If the jobseeker does not have degree, the agency can require the job seeker to apply to a school.\n\nIf the individual does not qualify for any unemployment benefit he may still be eligible for the housing benefit (''asumistuki'') from Kela and municipal social welfare provisions (''toimeentulotuki''). They are not unemployment benefits and depend on household income, but they have in practice become the basic income of many long-term unemployed.\n\n===France===\n{{Main|Unemployment benefits in France}}\n[[France]] uses a quasi [[Ghent system]], under which unemployment benefits are distributed by an independent agency (UNEDIC) in which [[trade union|unions]] and Employer organisations are equally represented.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/15/which-best-countries-live-unemployed-disabled-benefits|title=Which are the best countries in the world to live in if you are unemployed or disabled?|last=Penketh|first=Anne|date=2015-04-15|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-03-29|last2=Connolly|first2=Kate|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Kirchgaessner|first3=Stephanie|last4=McDonald|first4=Henry|last5=McCurry|first5=Justin|last6=Crouch|first6=David|last7=Walker|first7=Shaun|last8=Smith|first8=David|last9=O'Hara|first9=Mary}}</ref> UNEDIC is responsible for 3 benefits: ARE, ACA and ASR The main ARE scheme requires a minimum of 122 days membership in the preceding 24 months and certain other requirements before any claims can be made. Employers pay a contribution on top of the pre-tax income of their employees, which together with the employee contribution, fund the scheme.\n\nThe maximum unemployment benefit is (as of March 2009) 57.4% of [[EUR]] 162 per day (Social security contributions ceiling in 2011), or 6900 euros per month.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} http://www.pole-emploi.fr/candidat/le-montant-de-votre-allocation-@/suarticle.jspz?id=4125</ref> Claimants receive 57,4% of their average daily salary of the last 12 months preceding unemployment with the average amount being 1,111 euros per month.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} http://entreprise.lefigaro.fr/chomeurs-unedic.html</ref> In France tax and other payroll taxes are paid on unemployment benefits. In 2011 claimants received the allowance for an average 291 days.\n\n===Germany===\n[[Germany]] has two different types of unemployment benefits.\n\n====Unemployment benefit I====\n\nThe ''unemployment benefit I'' in [[Germany]] is also known as the unemployment insurance. The insurance is administered by the federal employment agency and funded by employee and employer contributions. This in stark contrast to FUTA in the US and other systems; where only employers make contributions. Participation (and thus contributions) are generally mandatory for both employee and employer.\n\nAll workers with a regular employment contract (''abh\u00e4ngig Besch\u00e4ftigte''), except freelancers and certain civil servants (''Beamte''), contribute to the system. Since 2006, certain previously excluded workers have been able to opt into the system on a voluntary basis.\n\nThe system is financed by contributions from employees and employers. Employees pay 1.5% of their gross salary below the social security threshold and employers pay 1.5% contribution on top of the salary paid to the employee. The contribution level was reduced from 3.25% for employees and employers as part of labour market reforms known as Hartz. Contributions are paid only on earnings up to the social security ceiling (2012: 5,600 EUR).\n\nThe system is largely self-financed but also receives a subsidy from the state to run the Jobcenters.\n\nUnemployed workers are entitled to:\n* Living allowance known as unemployment benefit\n* Help in finding work\n* Training\n\nThe unemployed benefit is paid to workers who have contributed at least during 12 months preceding their loss of a job. The allowance is paid for half of the period that the worker has contributed. Claimants get 60% of their previous net salary (capped at the social security ceiling), or 67% for claimants with children. The maximum benefit is therefore 2964 Euros (in 2012).\nIn 2011 the federal Work Agency had revenues and expenses of 37.5 bn EUR<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arbeitsagentur.de/zentraler-Content/Veroeffentlichungen/Intern/Geschaeftsbericht-2011.pdf |title=Unsere Ver\u00f6ffentlichungen \u2013 Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit |accessdate=2012-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531155700/http://www.arbeitsagentur.de/zentraler-Content/Veroeffentlichungen/Intern/Geschaeftsbericht-2011.pdf |archivedate=31 May 2012 |df=dmy-all |language=de}}</ref>\n\nAfter a change in German law effective since 2008, provided their job history qualifies them, benefit recipients aged 50 to 54 now receive an unemployment benefit for 15 months, those 55 to 57 for 18 months and those 58 or older receive benefits for 24 months. For those under the age of 50 who have not been employed for more than 30 months in a job which paid into the social security scheme, full unemployment benefit can be received for a maximum period of 12 months. Note how the duration of eligibility is variegated in Germany to account for the difficulty older people have re-entering the job market.\n\n====Unemployment benefit II====\n{{Main|Hartz concept}}\n{{lang|de|Arbeitslosengeld II}} is a second tier, open-ended welfare programme intended to ensure people do not fall into penury.\n\n* In order to be eligible, a person has to permanently reside in Germany, be in possession of a work permit, and be fit for work, i.e. can principally work at least three hours a day. The goal of the programme is to terminate one's dependence on it (welfare-to-work). It is not a Universal Basic Income.\n* The benefits are subordinated, that means:\n** A person may not eligible for other programmes, especially Unemployment benefits I and pension, but also other legal claims\u00a0\u2013 e.g. dependence on parents, or accounts receivable\u00a0\u2013 can not come to fruition.\n** The person has to be in need: He can not afford a minimum standard living by all incomes in total, or by expending his own previously accumulated assets, e.g. by selling real estate not required or adequate for a bare minimum lifestyle.\n\nDespite its name, unemployment is not a requirement.\nDue to wage dumping and other labour market dynamics, a large number of ''working'' beneficiaries ''supplement'' their monthly income.\nThey have the same obligations as non-working beneficiaries.\n\nPeople receiving benefits are obligated to cease their eligibility at all costs, but at least ''minimise'' their dependence on welfare until no money would be paid.\nThat means, they are obliged to seek for jobs nationwide, and accept ''every'' job offered, otherwise sanctions (retrenchment) may be applied.\nThere is no recognition of professional qualifications:\nAn academic has to join the menial workforce, regardless of the waste of qualifications.\n\nIn exchange for that, beneficiaries are assisted in that process, e.g. by reimbursing travel expenses to interviews, receiving (free of charge) training in order to increase their chances on the labour market, or subsidising moving expenses once an employment contract has been signed but the place of work requires relocation as it is further than the acceptable daily commute duration (at most 3\u00a0hrs a day).\nIf they do not voluntarily participate in training, they may be obliged by administrative action.\nBeneficiaries not complying with orders can be sanctioned by pruning their allowance and eventually revoking the grant altogether, virtually pushing them into poverty, homelessness and bankruptcy, as there are no other precautions installed.\n\nGermany does not have an EBT (electronic benefits transfer) card system in place and, instead, disburses welfare in cash or via direct deposit into the recipient's bank account.\nAs of 2020 a single person without children receives at most 432 \u20ac per month at free disposal intended to cover living expenses, plus costs for accommodation (rent and heating).\nPeople granted benefits are automatically insured at reduced rates in the national health and nursing care insurances.\nThe national pension insurance accounts the time living on benefits, but it does not increase the pension entitlement since in 2011 the federal government stopped paying 205\u00a0\u20ac monthly.\n\nThe reforms revamping the unemployment benefits system into its today's shape is dubbed {{lang|de|Hartz IV}}.\nThe term colloquially refers to Unemployment benefits II.\n\n===Greece===\nUnemployment benefits in Greece are administered through OAED ({{Lang-el|\u039f\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u0391\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c7\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u0395\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u0394\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd}}, Manpower Employment Organization) and are available only to laid-off salaried workers with full employment and social security payments during the previous two years.

Other measures are:\n* Redundancy Fund (''Cassa integrazione guadagni'', or CIG): cash benefits provided as [[shock absorbers]] to those workers who are suspended or who work only for reduced time due to temporary difficulties of their factories, aiming to help the factories in financial difficulties, by relieving them from the costs of unused workforce\n* Solidarity Contracts (''Contratti di solidariet\u00e0''): in the same cases granting CIG benefits, companies can sign contracts with reduced work time, to avoid dismissing redundancy workers. The state will grant to those workers the 60% of the lost part of the wage.\n* Mobility allowances (''Indennit\u00e0 di mobilit\u00e0''),: if the Redundancy Fund does not allow the company to re-establish a good financial situation, the workers can be entitled to mobility allowances. Other companies are provided [[incentive]]s for employing them. This measure has been abolished in 2012 and will stop working in 2017.\nIn the Italian unemployment insurance system all the measures are [[income]]-related, and they have an average [[decommodification]] level. The basis for entitlement is always [[employment]], with more specific conditions for each case, and the provider is quite always the state.

In order to claim any state unemployment support, an adult (18+) claimant has to prove at least one year of continuous, full employment (that is, minimum 40 hours a week/160 hours a month) in the last 18 months prior to registering with the Unemployment Bureau. If approved, as of 2019, one is granted 848 z\u0142 (224.25 US$ in April 2019) {{em|before taxes}} on a month-to-month basis for the first 3 months, then the amount is automatically lowered to 666 z\u0142 (176.20 US$ in April 2019) {{em|before taxes}} for the remaining 3\u20139 months. Therefore, if approved, one can claim unemployment benefits only to the maximum of 12 continuous months. However, during that period, one has to cooperate with the Unemployment Bureau in finding an employment under the strict guidelines of losing the unemployed status, and thus the benefits. In comparison to the unemployment benefits paid by the state, as of January 2019, the [[Minimum wage|minimum monthly pay]] is 2250,00<ref>\"Rz\u0105d podnosi pensj\u0119 minimaln\u0105.

Benefits are managed by the State Public Employment Agency (SEPE). The basis for entitlement is having contributed for a minimum period during the time preceding unemployment, with further conditions that may be applicable. The system comprises contributory benefits and non-contributory benefits.\n\nContributory benefits are payable to those unemployed persons with a minimum of 12 months' contributions over a period of 6 years preceding unemployment. The benefit is payable for 1/3 of the contribution period. The benefit amount is 70% of the legal reference salary plus additional amounts for persons with dependants. The benefit reduces to 60% of the reference salary after 6 months. The minimum benefit is 497 euros per month and the maximum is 1087.20 euros per month for a single person.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ayudasparados.com/importe-maximo-desempleo-2012/105|title=importe maximo desempleo 2018 \u2013 Ayudas a Parados|website=www.ayudasparados.com}}</ref> The non-contributory allowance is available to those persons who are no longer entitled to the contributory pension and who do not have income above 75% of the national minimum wage.\n\n===Sweden===\n{{Main|Unemployment benefits in Sweden}}\n[[Sweden]] uses the [[Ghent system]], under which a significant proportion of unemployment benefits are distributed by [[trade union|union]] unemployment funds. Unemployment benefits are divided into a voluntary scheme with income related compensation up to a certain level and a comprehensive scheme that provides a lower level of basic support. The voluntary scheme requires a minimum of 12 months membership and 6 months employment during that time before any claims can be made. Employers pay a fee on top of the pre-tax income of their employees, which together with membership fees, fund the scheme (see [[Unemployment funds in Sweden]]).\n\nThe maximum unemployment benefit is (as of July 2016) [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 980 per day. During the first 200 days, the unemployed will receive 80% of his or her normal income during the last 12 months. From day 201\u2013300 this goes down to 70% and from day 301\u2013450 the insurance covers 65% of the normal income (only available for parents to children under the age of 18). In Sweden tax is paid on unemployment benefits, so the unemployed will get a maximum of about SEK 10,000 per month during the first 100 days (depending on the [[municipality]] tax rate). In other currencies, as of June 2017, this means a maximum of approximately \u00a3900, $1,150, or [[\u20ac]]1,000, each month after tax. Private insurance is also available, mainly through professional organisations, to provide income-related compensation that otherwise exceeds the ceiling of the scheme. The comprehensive scheme is funded by tax.\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\n[[Saudi Arabia]] is an economic [[welfare state]] with free medical care<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.gov.sa/Detail.asp?InSectionID=1516&InNewsItemID=1746|title=Request Rejected|website=www.mofa.gov.sa}}</ref> and unemployment benefits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://saudinf.com/main/h814.htm|title=Social Services (2) \u2013 SAMIRAD (Saudi Arabia Market Information Resource)|website=saudinf.com}}</ref> However, the country relies not on taxation but mainly [[oil]] revenues to maintain the social and economic services to its populace.\n\nPayment:\n2000 SAR (US$534) for only 12 months for an unemployed person from ages 18\u201335\n\nExternal links\n* [http://saudinf.com/main/h814.htm Social Services of Saudi Arabia]\n\n===Turkey===\nBy law, legally employed workers, regardless of their citizenship are eligible for unemployment benefits given that they are at least 18 years old, the employees contribute 1% to unemployment funds while the employers contribute 2%, and the workers are eligible to receive benefits after 600 days of contributions within the preceding 3 years of employment. the benefit payment is 50% for the average daily earnings based on the last 4 months and cannot be higher than the minimum wage (per industry).

High premiums work to exclude many individuals who otherwise might purchase the insurance. \u201cA compulsory government program avoids the adverse selection problem. Hence, government provision of UI has the potential to increase efficiency. However, government provision does not eliminate moral hazard.\u201d<ref name=\"UNEMPLOY 215\"/>\n\n====Moral hazard====\n\u201cAt the same time, those workers who managed to obtain insurance might experience more unemployment otherwise would have been the case.\u201d<ref name=\"UNEMPLOY 215\"/> The private insurance company would have to determine whether the employee is unemployed through no fault of their own, which is difficult to determine. Incorrect determinations could result in the payout of significant amounts for fraudulent claims or alternately failure to pay legitimate claims. This leads to the rationale that if government could solve either problem that government intervention would increase efficiency.\n\n====Unemployment insurance effect on unemployment====\nIn the [[Great Recession]], the \u201cmoral hazard\u201d issue of whether unemployment insurance\u2014and specifically extending benefits past the maximum 99 weeks\u2014significantly encourages unemployment by discouraging workers from finding and taking jobs was expressed by Republican legislators. Conservative economist Robert Barro found that benefits raised the unemployment rate 2%.<ref>Robert Barro, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703959704575454431457720188 \"The Folly of Subsidizing Unemployment\"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', 30 August 2010.</ref><ref name=Zuylen-Wood/> Disagreeing with Barro's study were Berkeley economist [[Jesse Rothstein]], who found the \u201cvast majority\u201d of unemployment was due to \u201cdemand shocks\u201d not \u201c[unemployment insurance]-induced supply reductions.\u201d<ref name=Zuylen-Wood>[http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-cohn/97971/would-extending-unemployment-benefits-increase-unemployment Would Extending Unemployment Benefits Increase Unemployment?].

That is, the cost to the employer in increased taxes is less than the benefits that would be paid to the employee upon layoff. The firm in this instance believes that it is more cost effective to lay off the employee, causing more unemployment than under perfect experience rating.<ref name=\"UNEMPLOY 215\"/>\n\n====Unemployment insurance effect on employment====\nAn alternative rationale for unemployment insurance is that it may allow for improving the quality of matches between workers and firms. Marimon and Zilibotti argued that although a more generous unemployment benefit system may indeed increase the unemployment rate, it may also help improve the average match quality.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1468-0297.00432 | volume=109 | issue=455 | title=Unemployment vs. Mismatch of Talents: Reconsidering Unemployment Benefits | year=1999 | journal=The Economic Journal | pages=266\u2013291 | last1 = Marimon | first1 = Ramon | hdl=10230/640 | url=https://econ-papers.upf.edu/papers/211.pdf }}</ref> A similar point is made by Mazur who analyzed the welfare and inequality effects of a policy reform giving entitlement for unemployment insurance to quitters.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.07.001 |title=Can welfare abuse be welfare improving? |journal=Journal of Public Economics |volume=141 |pages=11\u201328 |year=2016 |last1=Mazur |first1=Karol |hdl=1814/45326 }}</ref> Arash Nekoei and Andrea Weber present empirical evidence from Austria that extending unemployment benefit duration raises wages by improving reemployment firm quality.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1257/aer.20150528 | volume=107 | issue=2 | title=Does Extending Unemployment Benefits Improve Job Quality? | year=2017 | journal=American Economic Review | pages=527\u2013561 | last1 = Nekoei | first1 = Arash| hdl=10419/110757 | url=https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/110757/1/dp9034.pdf }}</ref> Similarly, Tatsiramos studied data from European countries and found that although unemployment insurance does increase unemployment duration, the duration of subsequent employment tends to be longer (suggesting better match quality).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1162/JEEA.2009.7.6.1225 | volume=7 | issue=6 | title=Unemployment Insurance in Europe: Unemployment Duration and Subsequent Employment Stability | year=2009 | journal=Journal of the European Economic Association | pages=1225\u20131260 | last1 = Tatsiramos | first1 = Konstantinos| hdl=10419/33875 | url=https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/33875/1/516439251.pdf }}</ref>\n\n====Effect on state budgets====\nAnother issue with unemployment insurance relates to its effects on state budgets. During recessionary time periods, the number of unemployed rises and they begin to draw benefits from the program. The longer the recession lasts, depending on the state's starting UI program balance, the quicker the state begins to run out of funds. The recession that began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009 significantly impacted state budgets. According to The Council of State Governments, by 18 March 2011, 32 states plus the Virgin Islands had borrowed nearly $45.7 billion. The Labor Department estimates by the fourth quarter of 2013, as many as 40 states may need to borrow more than $90 billion to fund their unemployment programs and it will take a decade or more to pay off the debt.<ref>[http://knowledgecenter.csg.org/drupal/content/state-unemployment-insurance-trust-funds-march-2011-update Unemployment Insurance Trust Funds Update] ''Council of State Governments''</ref>\n\n====Insurance funds====\nPossible policy options for states to shore up the unemployment insurance funds include lowering benefits for recipients and/or raising taxes on businesses. Kentucky took the approach of raising taxes and lowering benefits to attempt to balance its unemployment insurance program. Starting in 2010, a claimant's weekly benefits will decrease from 68% to 62% and the taxable wage base will increase from $8,000 to $12,000, over a ten-year period. These moves are estimated to save the state over $450 million.<ref>[http://migration.kentucky.gov/Newsroom/governor/20100615unempins.htm] ''Kentucky.gov''</ref>\n\n====Job sharing / short-time working====\n[[Job sharing]] or work sharing and [[short time]] or short-time working refer to situations or systems in which employees agree to or are forced to accept a reduction in working time and pay. These can be based on individual agreements or on government programs in many countries that try to prevent unemployment. In these, employers have the option of reducing work hours to part-time for many employees instead of laying off some of them and retaining only full-time workers. For example, employees in 27 states of the United States can then receive unemployment payments for the hours they are no longer working.<ref>[https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/pdf/uilawcompar/2019/special.pdf] ''U.S. Department of Labor, Comparison of State Unemployment Insurance Laws tbl. 4-5 (2019).''</ref>\n\n==International Labour Convention==\n[[International Labour Organization]] has adopted the [[Employment Promotion and Protection against Unemployment Convention, 1988]] for promotion of [[employment]] against unemployment and [[social security]] including unemployment benefit.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Unemployment extension]]\n* [[Social rights]]\n* [[HIRE Act]]\n* [[Reserve army of labour]]\n* [[Involuntary unemployment]]\n* [[Labor power|Labour power]]\n* [[Compensation of employees]]\n* [[Lorenz curve]]\n* [[Social insurance]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n* Bojas George J., ''Labor Economics'', Second edition, 2002, [[McGraw-Hill]].\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite encyclopedia |last1=Francis |first1=David R.  |editor= [[David R.

His philosophy fits in the tradition of [[Spiritualism_(philosophy)|French Spiritualism]]. He was influenced by [[Maine de Biran]] re-actualized the Aristotelian Metaphysics and critique of eclectism of [[Victor Cousin]] in ''La philosophie en France au XIXe si\u00e8cle''. He did not occupy a university chair, but he was the conservator of the department of antiquities at the [[Louvre]], president of the jury of the [[:fr:Agr%C3%A9gation de philosophie en France|Aggregation of philosophy in France]] and [[:fr:Inspection g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale des biblioth%C3%A8ques|Inspector General of Libraries]].<ref>[[:fr:F%C3%A9lix Ravaisson]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Biography==\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|[[Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau]], ''Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien'']]\nRavaisson's chief philosophical works are: \"''Les Fragments philosophiques de Hamilton''\" (in the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'', November, 1840); ''Rapport sur le stoicisme'' (1851); ''La Philosophie en France au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle'' (1868; 3rd ed., 1889); ''Morale et m\u00e9taphysique'' (1893).

His philosophy fits in the tradition of [[Spiritualism_(philosophy)|French Spiritualism]]. He was influenced by [[Maine de Biran]] re-actualized the Aristotelian Metaphysics and critique of eclectism of [[Victor Cousin]] in ''La philosophie en France au XIXe si\u00e8cle''. He did not occupy a university chair, but he was the conservator of the department of antiquities at the [[Louvre]], president of the jury of the [[:fr:Agr%C3%A9gation de philosophie en France|Aggregation of philosophy in France]] and [[:fr:Inspection g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale des biblioth%C3%A8ques|Inspector General of Libraries]].<ref>[[:fr:F%C3%A9lix Ravaisson]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Biography==\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|[[Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau]], ''Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien'']]\nRavaisson's chief philosophical works are: \"''Les Fragments philosophiques de Hamilton''\" (in the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'', November, 1840); ''Rapport sur le stoicisme'' (1851); ''La Philosophie en France au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle'' (1868; 3rd ed., 1889); ''Morale et m\u00e9taphysique'' (1893).

In 1936, it was bought by [[Leicester City Council]], at which point it became a museum. The council recently made the decision to use the house and gardens as a heritage site rather than a museum, and it is now only open at certain times during the summer months. It is also available for private functions, such as weddings and ghost watches.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Belgrave Hall Museum - geograph.org.uk - 70266.jpg|thumb|left|Belgrave, with Hall and church in the distance]]\nBelgrave Hall was built as a substantial family home between 1709 and 1713 by Edmund Cradock, a Leicester hosiery merchant, on a site adjacent to Belgrave Church. At the time Belgrave was a small village three miles from Leicester, between the roads to Loughborough and Lincoln, and Belgrave Hall set a trend for wealthy businessmen to build themselves out-of-town houses in the area.<ref name=hist/> The house, fronting onto Church Road, is a three-storey building in an unadorned classical style, from blue and red bricks, laid in [[Brickwork#Flemish bond|Flemish bond]], creating a chequered pattern.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Philip A.|last1=Stevens|year=1973|title=Belgrave Hall|publisher=Leicester Museums|ref=harv}}</ref> There are lead rainwater heads with the Cradock family crest, some of which have a 1709  date and others with 1713.{{sfn|Stevens|1973|p=1}} This unusually long construction period, along with brickwork and ground-plan irregularities on the south side, may imply a re-design or halt to construction while building was underway.{{sfn|Stevens|1973|p=1}} The road frontage has imposing wrought iron gates which incorporate an 'EC' monogram<ref name=statham>Statham, Erica, (2015) 'The Cradocks of Belgrave Hall, and an inheritance wrangle', ''Leicestershire Historian'', No 51, p.25-28, [https://www.le.ac.uk/lahs/publications/historian.html LAHS]</ref> leading to a recessed doorway, and a brick parapet which hides the three hipped gables of the roof, creating a very rectangular facade.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pevsner|first1=Nikolaus|year=1984|title=The Buildings of England: Leicestershire and Rutland|edition=Second edition revised by Elizabeth Williamson|publisher=Yale University Press|page=268|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n==The Cradocks==\nEdmund Cradock (cousin of Edmund Cradock of [[Knighton, Leicester|Knighton]]{{sfn|Pevsner|1984|p=268}} and nephew of Henry Hastings of Belgrave Old Hall<ref name=infosheetp4>[http://www.leicester.gov.uk/your-council-services/lc/storyofleicester/cityheritage/builtheritage/belgravehall/ see link to Belgrave Hall Information Sheet] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213043152/http://www.leicester.gov.uk/your-council-services/lc/storyofleicester/cityheritage/builtheritage/belgravehall/ |date=13 February 2015 }}, Story of Leicester, Leicester City Council, 2012, p.4</ref>) and his wife Anne are presumed to have moved into what was then known as 'The Mansion House' by 1713. However Edmund died while visiting Bath on 21 April 1715, two years after the house was completed. Under the terms of the will, his married daughter Jane was to receive \u00a31,000, with the residue split equally between the two younger children, who, like their parents, were named Anne and Edmund.<ref name=statham/> Their mother received nothing from the will, and it is unknown how long she survived her husband.

Their primary role is the protection of RAAF equipment, personnel, assets and facilities during operations. While ADGs train to counter [[special forces]] as the primary ground threat to the projection of air power, ADGs are themselves conventional forces. Other duties include training RAAF personnel in weapon handling and basic ground defence tactics.\n\nADGs are commanded by [[commissioned officer]]s known as Ground Defence Officers (GRDEFO) who receive initial training at the [[Australian Army]]'s [[Royal Military College, Duntroon|Royal Military College (RMC), Duntroon]]. Following graduation from RMC, GRDEFOs undertake the Army Regimental Officer Basic Course (Infantry) prior to RAAF-specific training at the [[RAAF Security and Fire School|RAAF Security and Fire School (RAAFSFS)]], [[RAAF Base Amberley]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nADGs do not operate [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft weapons]], which are the responsibility of the [[Royal Australian Artillery]]. They are comparable to the British [[RAF Regiment|Royal Air Force Regiment]], [[USAF Security Forces]], and the [[RNZAF Security Forces]].\n\n==Current structure==\nFormerly, graduates from the RAAF Security & Fire School were placed into either 1AFDS or 2AFDS.  However, in late 2013, with the future procurement of new aircraft, such as the F-35 Lightning II, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were merged with the RAAF Security Police, Airbase Protection and RAAF Military Working Dog Handlers to form Numbers 1 & 2 Security Forces Squadrons (SECFOR), boosting the strength and capability of protecting the new assets.  Along with these changes, 1SECFOR was relocated to RAAF Base Williamtown, and 3AFDS was re-activated as 3SECFOR, and based at RAAF Base Edinburgh. The ADG mustering may be broadly divided into those positions contained within a Security Forces Squadron and those within other units.

Support Flight contains communications, signals, field engineering and reconnaissance elements (including snipers) and is commanded by a GRDEFO and an ADG Flight Sergeant. 1AFDS is an integrated unit of permanent and reserve members; while it is headquartered at RAAF Base Edinburgh, [[South Australia]], it has reserve Rifle Flights located in [[New South Wales]], South Australia, [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]]. In recent history 1AFDS has relocated to Amberley and has gained more permanent members with 3 rifle flights and is working closely with 2AFDS.<ref>[[#refRAAFWeb|Royal Australian Air Force website]] Accessed on 22 June 2008</ref>\n\nPermanent Air Force NCOs may be posted to a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any major RAAF base in Australia or to certain training units within [[Air Force Training Group RAAF|Air Force Training Group]]. GDTS staff undertake both a training role and provide specialist advice to unit commanders. Reserve NCOs may be posted to a SECFOR Squadron, or to an instructional post or Reserve Airbase Protection Flight within one of the RAAF's 'City' Squadrons (Nos. 13, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 & 31 SQNs). ADG Warrant Officers (WOFFs) may be posted to staff or policy positions within a higher headquarters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==History==\n\n===1929\u20131939===\nFrom 1929 the RAAF began to establish an Aerodrome Defence Scheme (ADS), primarily utilizing aircrafthands to provide local defence of airfields, although it was initially limited in scope. Following the acquisition of the required equipment training began in 1931, including in both anti-aircraft and ground defence roles. Between 1931 and 1939 this also included exercises with the Army, during which Aerodrome Defence Sections defended an area against attacks by Australian Army units and RAAF aircraft. In 1939 it was directed that the scheme be expanded to include all units and stations.{{sfn|Cawardine|2017|pp=40\u201350}}\n\n===Second World War===\n[[Image:ADGs with Vickers Gun 1944.jpg|thumb|Aerodrome Defence Guards manning a Vickers Gun, 1944]]While the RAAF did not face a significant ground threat in the first years of [[World War II]], an Air Force Guard mustering was proposed in 1940.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.2.</ref> This mustering was to receive training in infantry tactics to defend RAAF bases against attack and would be modelled on the Royal Air Force Regiment. The idea never progressed and those recruited for the task were assigned to other musterings. Following the [[bombing of Darwin]] in 1942 and ground attacks on Allied air bases, it was realised that the RAAF needed to defend its own airfields and that ground defence training was required for RAAF personnel. Following a request to the Army, Lieutenant Colonel H.H. Carr was seconded to the RAAF from [[2/22nd Battalion (Australia)|2/22 Battalion AIF]] in May 1942. Further secondments of infantry officers and NCOs followed and the RAAF Defence School was established at Hamilton, Victoria in September of that year. The school commenced training Army and RAAF officers and NCOs as Aerodrome Defence Officers and Aerodrome Defence Instructors, who were then posted to RAAF units to deliver ground defence training.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.4.</ref>\n\nIn October 1942, the [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|Security Guards Unit]] was formed at [[Livingstone Airfield|Livingstone Field]], [[Northern Territory]].<ref>[[#refKerr1985|Kerr 1985]], p.28.</ref> All RAAF guards were posted to this unit, irrespective of where they were serving. The Security Guards Unit was charged with providing guards for operational bases both within Australia and overseas. Trainees were instructed in the employment of [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s, ground patrolling, scouting and hand-to-hand combat. At first the unit had a strength of 567 personnel, increasing to 943 by July 1943; in that year the unit moved to Darwin.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.162.</ref> The unit was renamed [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron]] in April 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.164.</ref>[[Image:Gravestone of LAC Thomas Irvine, RAAF.jpg|thumb|left|Gravestone of Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine, Labuan]]\n\nA second unit, the Defence Pool, was established at [[Noemfoor]] in December 1944.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.163.</ref> It is believed that guards may have been trained at the Security Guards Unit and then posted to the Defence Pool for operational deployment. A detachment of the Defence Pool was deployed to [[Morotai]] island in early 1945 in order to prepare a camp for the arrival of the main party of the unit. The Defence Pool was subsequently ordered to be disbanded on 28 March 1945; however a reconsideration led to the establishment of No. 2 Airfield Defence Squadron. By May of that year ADGs had participated in a number of operations, including the recapture of [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]],<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.217.</ref> [[Brunei]] and [[Balikpapan]].<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.20.</ref> They had also suffered casualties, among them Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine and Corporal Clarence Tully<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.224.</ref> who were killed during Japanese raids on [[Juwata Airport|Tarakan airfield]].

A significant proportion of RAAF National Service recruits received training in ground defence techniques. This included the use of the .303 rifle, Thompson Sub-Machine Gun, Bren Light Machine Gun and hand grenades, in addition to fieldcraft skills. No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron was re-established at Mallala, South Australia as a National Service unit in 1951, then once again disbanded in 1952. There is evidence to suggest that the RAAF considered the introduction of an armoured car capability in the 1950s,<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.332.</ref> with ADIs attending training on [[T17E1 Staghound|Staghound]] vehicles with the Army at [[Puckapunyal]];<ref>[[#refWalker2007|Walker 2007]] p.144.</ref> this project was never brought to fruition.\n\nIn June 1965 a submission to the Air Board requested the establishment of 455 positions to provide for the defence of the eleven major RAAF bases in Australia, as well as overseas bases in Malaysia, Thailand and South Vietnam.<ref>[[#refWilson1999|Wilson 1999]], p.85.</ref> In the end, the ADG mustering was re-established in October 1965<ref name=\"Wilson\">[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.79.</ref> with an authorised strength of 220 new positions in addition to the remustering of all Drill Instructors and ADIs.<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.64.</ref> After the outbreak of the [[Vietnam War]], Australia was asked to increase its level of commitment. To meet these new demands, the RAAF deployed a number of aircraft to Phan Rang Airbase, South Vietnam, in 1966. The [[USAF Air Police|USAF Security Police]] unit assigned to the base, asked the RAAF to contribute to the defence of the base.\n\n===Vietnam War===\nADG Flights were deployed to South Vietnam with 2 Squadron at [[Phan Rang Air Base]] and No. 1 Operational Support Unit (1OSU) at [[Vung Tau]]. ADGs were also deployed to [[Ubon|Ubon Air Base]], [[Thailand]] to protect the RAAF detachment based there, including 79 Squadron flying Sabre jets. In Vietnam ADGs conducted both static security tasks and security patrols outside the base perimeter,<ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.302.</ref> thus disrupting the Viet Cong ability to conduct stand-off attacks against the bases. Corporal N.E.

It\nregularly deployed on RAAF and joint exercises such as those in the Kangaroo series along with occasional deployments to Malaysia and New Zealand.\n\nNew capabilities were trialled, such as scout dogs to aid in detection and tracking of enemy parties and the employment on Exercise Pitch Black 1990 of [[M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier]]s from the Army's 2nd Cavalry Regiment to provide armoured mobility for the QRF. Both capabilities may be considered to have matured in recent years with the attachment of Security Police (SECPOL) Military Working Dog (MWD) teams to ADG patrols and the introduction into RAAF service of the [[Bushmaster IMV|Bushmaster]] [[armored personnel carrier|Infantry Mobility Vehicles]].<ref>[[#refAirForceNewsJuly132006|Air Force News website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> In 1992 2AFDS became the first non-flying unit to be awarded the [[Gloucester Cup|Duke of Gloucester Cup]].<ref>[[#refArmstrong1992|Armstrong 1992]], p.1</ref>\n\nThe period saw a generational change in weapons and equipment on issue to ADGs; jungle green uniforms were replaced by the Disruptive Pattern Combat Uniform (DPCU), the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]] (SLR), M16 and F1 Sub-Machine Gun were replaced by the F88 Austeyr assault rifle and Vietnam-era radios were replaced with the Raven series of VHF and HF sets. ADGs continued to deliver weapon and ground defence training to RAAF personnel and provided the majority of instructors for recruit, apprentice and initial officer training. The scope of this role, the longest and most continuous of the ADG mustering and its predecessors, may be gauged by the delivery of conversion training from the L1A1 SLR to the F88 rifle for every member of the RAAF; at the same time the Ground Defence Training Sections, manned on each base by 3\u20135 ADGs and GRDEFOs, commenced delivery of additional ground defence training for all RAAF members as the service transitioned to an expeditionary role.\n\nIn 1992 1AFDS was reformed at [[RAAF Base Tindal]], [[Northern Territory]] as a Ready Reserve unit. The Ready Reserve Scheme involved recruits enlisting for 12 months full-time service, completing identical recruit and trade training to that undertaken by regular airmen, followed by 4 years part-time service.<ref>[[#refSmith2006|Smith 2006]], p.36.</ref> The cadre staff of 1AFDS consisted of Permanent Air Force (PAF) GRDEFOs and ADG NCOs; while the Ready Reserve Scheme was abolished in 1996, the RAAF implemented the Ground Defence Reserve Group based upon a similar concept, although with the full-time service commitment reduced to 9 months. This scheme is still in operation.\n\nAs individuals or in small groups, ADGs and GREDFOs deployed on peacekeeping operations in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and [[Bougainville Province|Bougainville]], were attached to Army units providing [[Rifle Company Butterworth]] rotations and deployed to the Middle East with [[No. 33 Squadron RAAF|No. 33 Squadron]] in 1998. 2AFDS also deployed a Rifle Flight to assist with the evacuation of civilians from [[Cambodia]] in 1997 as part of [[Operation Vista]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n===East Timor===\nWhilst preparing for deployment to Exercise Crocodile 99, 2AFDS, along with No. 381 Expeditionary Combat Support Squadron (381ECSS) and 382ECSS, were warned out for duty in East Timor on [[Operation Warden]]. Both 381ECSS and 382ECSS had ADGs and GRDEFOs on strength. 2AFDS and 381ECSS commenced deployment to Comoro Airfield, Dili, on 20 September 1999;<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.39.</ref> 381ECSS began arriving at Cakung Airfield, Baucau on 11 October 1999.<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.56.</ref> 2AFDS undertook static security, access control and reconnaissance patrol tasks, in addition to establishing observation posts and providing a Quick Reaction Force (QRF). Reinforcements arrived on 4 November 1999 comprising 37 members of 3AFDS,<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.86.</ref> an integrated permanent and reserve squadron headquartered at RAAF Base Amberley (subsequently disbanded in December 2006). The additional manpower also allowed the squadron to assume responsibility for the Dili heliport in December.<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.94.</ref>\n\n2AFDS was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation and the Commanding Officer, Squadron Leader J.D. Leo, received the Distinguished Service Medal for performance during [[Operation Warden]].<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.133.</ref>\n\n===Solomon Islands===\nADGs and GRDEFOs deployed to Henderson Field, Honiara as part of the RAAF component of Joint Task Force 635 on [[Operation Anode]], the ADF contribution to the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands|Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI)]]. Following severe rioting in April 2006, members of 2AFDS were deployed as part of the ADF response to support police in reestablishing law and order. A further link with the Solomon Islands exists via Protective Service Officer Adam Dunning of the Australian Federal Police, who was shot and killed in Honiara in December 2004. Although deployed to the Solomon Islands in his civilian role, Dunning was a reservist ADG and had previously served with 2AFDS in East Timor.\n\n===Iraq===\n[[Image:USAF RAAF guards 031103-F-0000S-001.jpg|thumb|Two Airfield Defence Guards (at left and second from the right) with members of the USAF 447th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron at [[Baghdad International Airport]]]]\nAs part of [[Operation Catalyst]], ADGs provided force protection to the RAAF air traffic control detachment at Baghdad International Airport, during 2003\u201304.<ref>[[#refDoDWeb|Dept of Defence website]] Accessed on 6 July 2008</ref> Thirteen ADGs from 2AFDS deployed to Baghdad with Security Detachment (SECDET) 13, the Australian combat team providing security for the Australian Embassy and close protection for officials.<ref>[[#refNyhan2008|Nyhan 2008]], p.9</ref> The ADGs were integrated within the infantry component of SECDET 13, drawn from the [[7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (7RAR).

ADGs continue to be deployed to the [[Middle East Area of Operations]] (MEAO) in small numbers to provide specialist support to operations.\n\n===Other operations===\nIn addition to the major campaigns listed above, in recent years ADGs have been involved in a range of smaller scale operations. These have included [[Operation Gold]], the provision of ADF support to the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000; [[Operation Deluge]], the provision of security to the 2007 Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum meetings in Sydney; and [[Operation Ramp]],<ref>[[#refAirForceNewsSep72006|Air Force News website]] Accessed on 15 July 2008</ref> the evacuation of Australian and foreign nationals from [[Lebanon]] in 2006 during the conflict between Israeli forces and [[Hezbollah]].\n\n2AFDS was presented with a squadron [[War flag|standard]] by the [[Governor-General of Australia]], Her Excellency Ms [[Quentin Bryce]], at RAAF Base Amberley on 19 May 2011<ref>{{cite news |last=Stackpool |first=Andrew |url=http://airforcenews.realviewdigital.com/?xml=defencenews_airforce.xml&iid=48995&startpage=6&crd=0&searchKey=2AFDS |title=Rain fails to spoil colourful days |accessdate=13 January 2015 |newspaper=Air Force News |date=9 June 2011 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nMembers are enlisted as ADGs in the Permanent Air Force for an initial period of service of four years; those joining the Ground Defence Reserve Group are employed on full-time service for 11 months, followed by 4 years part-time service. Once a candidate has successfully completed RAAF recruit training they attend the 15-week ADG Basic course at the [[RAAF Security and Fire School]] (RAAFSFS) RAAF Amberley, Queensland. Upon completion of trade training ADGs may wear the blue-grey beret which identifies them as a ground defence specialist.\n\nAirmen graduate from ADG Basic course with the rank of Aircraftman (AC) and are posted to one of the 3 Security Forces Squadrons. Following a further 12 months service and favourable reporting, ADGs are reclassified to the rank of Leading Aircraftman (LAC). Post-graduate training may be undertaken to qualify in communications, field engineering/assault pioneer, direct fire support weapons, close personal protection and sniping;<ref>[[#refDFRTWeb|Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> the majority of these courses being undertaken at Army training establishments. Further promotion is based upon minimum periods in rank, successful completion of appropriate trade and promotion courses, performance reporting and availability of positions. All ADGs must qualify as weapon instructors prior to promotion to NCO rank. Out of mustering postings may be available, with ADGs having served within [[Australia's Federation Guard]], as career advisers within a Defence Recruiting Centre and as Military Skills Instructors (MSIs) at [[No. 1 Recruit Training Unit RAAF|No. 1 Recruit Training Unit (1RTU)]], [[RAAF Base Wagga|RAAF Base Wagga Wagga]] and Officer Training School (OTS), [[RAAF Base East Sale]].\n\n==Duties and mission roles==\n[[File:Royal Australian Air Force security forces conduct a patrol through Tarin Kowt in March 2013.jpg|thumb|RAAF security force personnel patrolling through [[Tarin Kowt]] in Afghanistan during 2013]]\nADGs form the basis of the Air Force's ground combat force, protecting Base assets, infrastructure and personnel against attack by enemy ground forces. For planning purposes, a nominal Area of Operations (AO) for RAAF ground defence is usually extends to five kilometres from the airfield [[perimeter fence]]; in practice, however, the AO assigned to ADGs is determined by variables such as available forces, terrain, vegetation etc. ADGs are trained and equipped to locate, fix and destroy enemy ground forces, ideally during the reconnaissance phase of any intended attack on RAAF assets. This is achieved by the deployment of multiple patrol teams, usually consisting of 4\u20135 members, undertaking reconnaissance patrols, observation and listening posts. These teams are supported by specialist elements including snipers operating in a counter-sniper role. Once the enemy are located, forces are concentrated to engage and destroy their capability to complete their task. ADGs also provide a Base Commander with a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) mounted in wheeled vehicles. QRF teams are heavily armed and act as a mobile reserve to provide a counter-attack or counter-penetration capability should an enemy evade the patrol screen.\n\nIn addition to their operational role ADG instructors provide essential ground defence training to the remainder of the RAAF. This includes instruction in weapon handling, ground defence and security tactics and Chemical, Biological, Radiologican and Nuclear (CBRN) defence. Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) may be posted to instructional positions at 1RTU; OTS; the [[Australian Defence Force Academy|Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA)]], [[Canberra]]; [[Combat Survival Training School RAAF|Combat Survival Training School]] (CSTS, also known as COMSURV), [[RAAF Base Townsville]]; RAAF Security & Fire School, RAAF Base Amberley or a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any RAAF Base in Australia.\n\n===Tasks performed by ADGs===\n[[File:RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules during Cope North 2018.jpg|thumb|A RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules aircraft during an exercise in 2018]]\n* patrolling over extended periods over arduous terrain and in extreme climatic conditions carrying a specified load necessary to accomplish the mission;\n* foot and vehicle patrolling by day and by night in and around both established and bare base airfields and through vegetated or urban environments in all extremities of weather conditions and locations within or outside of Australia;\n* manning of Observation Posts (OPs), Listening Posts (LPs) and standing patrols to detect and interdict enemy movement\n* Quick Reaction Force (QRF) duties in response to identified threats;\n* Aircraft Security Operations providing protection to both aircraft and infrastructure;\n* construction of field defences and obstacles such as weapon pits and bunkers, fences and vehicle check points (VCPs);\n* search and clearance operations;\n* manning of crew served weapons such as machine guns and anti-armour weapons;\n* security for special events;\n* instruction on small arms including pistols, rifles, shotguns and [[Light Support Weapon]]s (LSWs);\n* instruction in Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) defence; and\n* instruction in individual and unit ground defence tactics and techniques.\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:RAAF Bushmaster.JPG|thumb|An RAAF Bushmaster]]\nThe weapons and equipment issued to ADGs are similar to standard [[Royal Australian Infantry Corps|Australian infantry]] [[Weaponry of the Australian Army|equipment]].\n\n===Weapons===\n* [[Browning Hi-Power|L9A1/L9A3 Self Loading Pistol (Browning Hi-Power)]]\n* [[Heckler & Koch MP5|Heckler & Koch MP5 sub-machine gun]]\n* [[Steyr AUG|F88 Austeyr rifle (Steyr AUG)]]\n* [[SR-25|SR25 Marksman Rifle]]\n* [[Accuracy International Arctic Warfare|Accuracy International SR-98 sniper rifle]]\n* [[FN Minimi|F89 Light Support Weapon (Minimi)]]\n* [[FN MAG|MAG58 General-Purpose Machine Gun]]\n* [[M203 grenade launcher]]<ref>[http://www.airforce.gov.au/adg/weapons.aspx RAAF Airfield Defence Guard webpage] Retrieved: 6 January 2009.</ref> (as part of the [[F88 Austeyr#Australian|F88 GLA Austeyr rifle]])\n* [[M72 LAW|M72 Light Anti-armour Weapon]]\n* [[Carl Gustav recoilless rifle]]\n* F1 hand grenade\n* [[Remington Model 870]] 12-gauge shotgun\n\nThe primary weaponry used by ADGs consists of the F88 Austeyr (with or without the M203 Grenade Launcher Attachment), F89 Minimi, and the Browning Hi-Power Self Loading Pistol.

Their primary role is the protection of RAAF equipment, personnel, assets and facilities during operations. While ADGs train to counter [[special forces]] as the primary ground threat to the projection of air power, ADGs are themselves conventional forces. Other duties include training RAAF personnel in weapon handling and basic ground defence tactics.\n\nADGs are commanded by [[commissioned officer]]s known as Ground Defence Officers (GRDEFO) who receive initial training at the [[Australian Army]]'s [[Royal Military College, Duntroon|Royal Military College (RMC), Duntroon]]. Following graduation from RMC, GRDEFOs undertake the Army Regimental Officer Basic Course (Infantry) prior to RAAF-specific training at the [[RAAF Security and Fire School|RAAF Security and Fire School (RAAFSFS)]], [[RAAF Base Amberley]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nADGs do not operate [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft weapons]], which are the responsibility of the [[Royal Australian Artillery]]. They are comparable to the British [[RAF Regiment|Royal Air Force Regiment]], [[USAF Security Forces]], and the [[RNZAF Security Forces]].\n\n==Current structure==\nFormerly, graduates from the RAAF Security & Fire School were placed into either 1AFDS or 2AFDS.  However, in late 2013, with the future procurement of new aircraft, such as the F-35 Lightning II, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were merged with the RAAF Security Police, Airbase Protection and RAAF Military Working Dog Handlers to form Numbers 1 & 2 Security Forces Squadrons (SECFOR), boosting the strength and capability of protecting the new assets.  Along with these changes, 1SECFOR was relocated to RAAF Base Williamtown, and 3AFDS was re-activated as 3SECFOR, and based at RAAF Base Edinburgh. The ADG mustering may be broadly divided into those positions contained within a Security Forces Squadron and those within other units. Within [[Combat Support Group RAAF|Combat Support Group]], [[No. 95 Wing RAAF|No. 95 Wing]] commands the three Security Forces Squadrons.<ref name=structure>{{cite web |url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/About-us/Structure-of-the-RAAF/?RAAF-pgmUdI54oD/7ZI5LVP3JEZ6o3NEOB/BC |title=Structure of the RAAF |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force |accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n*[[No. 1 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Security Forces Squadron]] (1SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Base Amberley]]\n*[[No. 2 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 2 Security Forces Squadron]] (2SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Williamtown]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#refDoDWeb|Dept of Defence website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref>\n* [[No. 3 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 3 Security Forces Squadron]] (3 SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Base Edinburgh]].<ref name=structure/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/jobs/air-force/airfield-defence-guard |title=Airfield Defence Guard |work=Defence Jobs |accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nSecurity Forces Squadrons are deployable tactical units, broadly comparable in size and structure to an infantry independent rifle company, capable of providing force protection for RAAF elements or other formations. 2AFDS comprises four Rifle Flights and a Support Flight; each Rifle Flight consists of four 10-man Sections and a Headquarters element of one GRDEFO, a SGT and a signaller. Support Flight contains communications, signals, field engineering and reconnaissance elements (including snipers) and is commanded by a GRDEFO and an ADG Flight Sergeant. 1AFDS is an integrated unit of permanent and reserve members; while it is headquartered at RAAF Base Edinburgh, [[South Australia]], it has reserve Rifle Flights located in [[New South Wales]], South Australia, [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]]. In recent history 1AFDS has relocated to Amberley and has gained more permanent members with 3 rifle flights and is working closely with 2AFDS.<ref>[[#refRAAFWeb|Royal Australian Air Force website]] Accessed on 22 June 2008</ref>\n\nPermanent Air Force NCOs may be posted to a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any major RAAF base in Australia or to certain training units within [[Air Force Training Group RAAF|Air Force Training Group]]. GDTS staff undertake both a training role and provide specialist advice to unit commanders. Reserve NCOs may be posted to a SECFOR Squadron, or to an instructional post or Reserve Airbase Protection Flight within one of the RAAF's 'City' Squadrons (Nos. 13, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 & 31 SQNs). ADG Warrant Officers (WOFFs) may be posted to staff or policy positions within a higher headquarters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==History==\n\n===1929\u20131939===\nFrom 1929 the RAAF began to establish an Aerodrome Defence Scheme (ADS), primarily utilizing aircrafthands to provide local defence of airfields, although it was initially limited in scope. Following the acquisition of the required equipment training began in 1931, including in both anti-aircraft and ground defence roles. Between 1931 and 1939 this also included exercises with the Army, during which Aerodrome Defence Sections defended an area against attacks by Australian Army units and RAAF aircraft. In 1939 it was directed that the scheme be expanded to include all units and stations.{{sfn|Cawardine|2017|pp=40\u201350}}\n\n===Second World War===\n[[Image:ADGs with Vickers Gun 1944.jpg|thumb|Aerodrome Defence Guards manning a Vickers Gun, 1944]]While the RAAF did not face a significant ground threat in the first years of [[World War II]], an Air Force Guard mustering was proposed in 1940.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.2.</ref> This mustering was to receive training in infantry tactics to defend RAAF bases against attack and would be modelled on the Royal Air Force Regiment. The idea never progressed and those recruited for the task were assigned to other musterings. Following the [[bombing of Darwin]] in 1942 and ground attacks on Allied air bases, it was realised that the RAAF needed to defend its own airfields and that ground defence training was required for RAAF personnel. Following a request to the Army, Lieutenant Colonel H.H. Carr was seconded to the RAAF from [[2/22nd Battalion (Australia)|2/22 Battalion AIF]] in May 1942. Further secondments of infantry officers and NCOs followed and the RAAF Defence School was established at Hamilton, Victoria in September of that year. The school commenced training Army and RAAF officers and NCOs as Aerodrome Defence Officers and Aerodrome Defence Instructors, who were then posted to RAAF units to deliver ground defence training.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.4.</ref>\n\nIn October 1942, the [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|Security Guards Unit]] was formed at [[Livingstone Airfield|Livingstone Field]], [[Northern Territory]].<ref>[[#refKerr1985|Kerr 1985]], p.28.</ref> All RAAF guards were posted to this unit, irrespective of where they were serving. The Security Guards Unit was charged with providing guards for operational bases both within Australia and overseas. Trainees were instructed in the employment of [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s, ground patrolling, scouting and hand-to-hand combat. At first the unit had a strength of 567 personnel, increasing to 943 by July 1943; in that year the unit moved to Darwin.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.162.</ref> The unit was renamed [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron]] in April 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.164.</ref>[[Image:Gravestone of LAC Thomas Irvine, RAAF.jpg|thumb|left|Gravestone of Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine, Labuan]]\n\nA second unit, the Defence Pool, was established at [[Noemfoor]] in December 1944.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.163.</ref> It is believed that guards may have been trained at the Security Guards Unit and then posted to the Defence Pool for operational deployment. A detachment of the Defence Pool was deployed to [[Morotai]] island in early 1945 in order to prepare a camp for the arrival of the main party of the unit. The Defence Pool was subsequently ordered to be disbanded on 28 March 1945; however a reconsideration led to the establishment of No. 2 Airfield Defence Squadron. By May of that year ADGs had participated in a number of operations, including the recapture of [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]],<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.217.</ref> [[Brunei]] and [[Balikpapan]].<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.20.</ref> They had also suffered casualties, among them Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine and Corporal Clarence Tully<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.224.</ref> who were killed during Japanese raids on [[Juwata Airport|Tarakan airfield]]. LAC Irvine died on 5 May 1945<ref>[[#refOdgers1957|Odgers 1957]], p.458.</ref> and is believed to be the first ADG killed by enemy action; he is buried in the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery on Labuan Island.\n\n===1945\u20131965===\nFollowing the end of hostilities, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were disbanded on 19 November 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Aerodrome Defence Officers (ADOs) and Aerodrome Defence Instructors (ADIs) were retained to deliver basic ground defence instruction to RAAF members during initial and continuation training. A significant proportion of RAAF National Service recruits received training in ground defence techniques. This included the use of the .303 rifle, Thompson Sub-Machine Gun, Bren Light Machine Gun and hand grenades, in addition to fieldcraft skills. No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron was re-established at Mallala, South Australia as a National Service unit in 1951, then once again disbanded in 1952. There is evidence to suggest that the RAAF considered the introduction of an armoured car capability in the 1950s,<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.332.</ref> with ADIs attending training on [[T17E1 Staghound|Staghound]] vehicles with the Army at [[Puckapunyal]];<ref>[[#refWalker2007|Walker 2007]] p.144.</ref> this project was never brought to fruition.\n\nIn June 1965 a submission to the Air Board requested the establishment of 455 positions to provide for the defence of the eleven major RAAF bases in Australia, as well as overseas bases in Malaysia, Thailand and South Vietnam.<ref>[[#refWilson1999|Wilson 1999]], p.85.</ref> In the end, the ADG mustering was re-established in October 1965<ref name=\"Wilson\">[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.79.</ref> with an authorised strength of 220 new positions in addition to the remustering of all Drill Instructors and ADIs.<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.64.</ref> After the outbreak of the [[Vietnam War]], Australia was asked to increase its level of commitment. To meet these new demands, the RAAF deployed a number of aircraft to Phan Rang Airbase, South Vietnam, in 1966. The [[USAF Air Police|USAF Security Police]] unit assigned to the base, asked the RAAF to contribute to the defence of the base.\n\n===Vietnam War===\nADG Flights were deployed to South Vietnam with 2 Squadron at [[Phan Rang Air Base]] and No. 1 Operational Support Unit (1OSU) at [[Vung Tau]]. ADGs were also deployed to [[Ubon|Ubon Air Base]], [[Thailand]] to protect the RAAF detachment based there, including 79 Squadron flying Sabre jets. In Vietnam ADGs conducted both static security tasks and security patrols outside the base perimeter,<ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.302.</ref> thus disrupting the Viet Cong ability to conduct stand-off attacks against the bases. Corporal N.E. Power became the first airman to win the [[Military Medal]] (MM) since the Second World War for a night action on 11 February 1970, during which an enemy reconnaissance party was successfully ambushed near the perimeter of the Phan Rang base.<ref>[[#refCoulthard-Clark1995|Coulthard-Clark 1995]], p.238.</ref><ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.318.</ref> Airfield Defence Guards also provided most of the door gunners on [[UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopters with [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF|No. 9 Squadron]] during the war.<ref>[[#refOdgers1974|Odgers 1974]], p.87.</ref><ref>[[#refHaran2004|Haran 2004]], p.26.</ref>\n\nWhen the government of South Vietnam collapsed in 1975, Australia ordered the evacuation of its embassy in Saigon. The final mission undertaken by ADGs in Vietnam was to provide security for the evacuation.<ref>[[#refHam2007|Ham 2007]], p.597</ref> The \"last\" evacuation aircraft was severely overloaded and four ADGs were left on the tarmac at [[Tan Son Nhut]] airfield, each armed with a pistol and four rounds of ammunition; a C-130 was diverted from Thailand to evacuate them later in the day.<ref>[[#refHam2007|Ham 2007]], p.601.</ref> Over 350 ADGs served in Vietnam,<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> six being killed in the conflict.<ref>[[#refADGAssoc|Airfield Defence Guard Association website]] Accessed on 8 July 2008</ref> In addition to the MM awarded to Powers, GRDEFOs and ADGs were awarded an [[MBE]], eight [[mention in dispatches|mentions in dispatches]] and four [[Distinguished Flying Medal]]s of the ten awarded to RAAF members.<ref>[[#refCoulthard-Clark1995|Coulthard-Clark 1995]], pp.242\u2013243.</ref>\n\n===1972\u20131999===\nAfter withdrawal from Vietnam the ADG mustering was reduced in numbers, with Rifle Flights posted to RAAF Bases Amberley, Fairbairn, Richmond and Williamtown and ADGs manning instructional posts at other establishments.<ref>[[#refKerr1985|Kerr 1985]], p.32.</ref>\nAlthough the RAAF contemplated disbanding the mustering in the mid-1980s, the years between the Vietnam War and the 1999 deployment to East Timor were spent consolidating tactics and techniques such as reconnaissance skills and Quick Reaction Force (QRF) operations. 2AFDS was reformed on 17 March 1983<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.1634</ref> with the headquarters located at RAAF Base Richmond and the Rifle Flights remaining dispersed; the unit was eventually consolidated at RAAF Base Amberley in January 1989. It\nregularly deployed on RAAF and joint exercises such as those in the Kangaroo series along with occasional deployments to Malaysia and New Zealand.\n\nNew capabilities were trialled, such as scout dogs to aid in detection and tracking of enemy parties and the employment on Exercise Pitch Black 1990 of [[M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier]]s from the Army's 2nd Cavalry Regiment to provide armoured mobility for the QRF. Both capabilities may be considered to have matured in recent years with the attachment of Security Police (SECPOL) Military Working Dog (MWD) teams to ADG patrols and the introduction into RAAF service of the [[Bushmaster IMV|Bushmaster]] [[armored personnel carrier|Infantry Mobility Vehicles]].<ref>[[#refAirForceNewsJuly132006|Air Force News website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> In 1992 2AFDS became the first non-flying unit to be awarded the [[Gloucester Cup|Duke of Gloucester Cup]].<ref>[[#refArmstrong1992|Armstrong 1992]], p.1</ref>\n\nThe period saw a generational change in weapons and equipment on issue to ADGs; jungle green uniforms were replaced by the Disruptive Pattern Combat Uniform (DPCU), the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]] (SLR), M16 and F1 Sub-Machine Gun were replaced by the F88 Austeyr assault rifle and Vietnam-era radios were replaced with the Raven series of VHF and HF sets. ADGs continued to deliver weapon and ground defence training to RAAF personnel and provided the majority of instructors for recruit, apprentice and initial officer training. The scope of this role, the longest and most continuous of the ADG mustering and its predecessors, may be gauged by the delivery of conversion training from the L1A1 SLR to the F88 rifle for every member of the RAAF; at the same time the Ground Defence Training Sections, manned on each base by 3\u20135 ADGs and GRDEFOs, commenced delivery of additional ground defence training for all RAAF members as the service transitioned to an expeditionary role.\n\nIn 1992 1AFDS was reformed at [[RAAF Base Tindal]], [[Northern Territory]] as a Ready Reserve unit. The Ready Reserve Scheme involved recruits enlisting for 12 months full-time service, completing identical recruit and trade training to that undertaken by regular airmen, followed by 4 years part-time service.<ref>[[#refSmith2006|Smith 2006]], p.36.</ref> The cadre staff of 1AFDS consisted of Permanent Air Force (PAF) GRDEFOs and ADG NCOs; while the Ready Reserve Scheme was abolished in 1996, the RAAF implemented the Ground Defence Reserve Group based upon a similar concept, although with the full-time service commitment reduced to 9 months. This scheme is still in operation.\n\nAs individuals or in small groups, ADGs and GREDFOs deployed on peacekeeping operations in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and [[Bougainville Province|Bougainville]], were attached to Army units providing [[Rifle Company Butterworth]] rotations and deployed to the Middle East with [[No. 33 Squadron RAAF|No. 33 Squadron]] in 1998. 2AFDS also deployed a Rifle Flight to assist with the evacuation of civilians from [[Cambodia]] in 1997 as part of [[Operation Vista]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n===East Timor===\nWhilst preparing for deployment to Exercise Crocodile 99, 2AFDS, along with No. 381 Expeditionary Combat Support Squadron (381ECSS) and 382ECSS, were warned out for duty in East Timor on [[Operation Warden]]. Both 381ECSS and 382ECSS had ADGs and GRDEFOs on strength. 2AFDS and 381ECSS commenced deployment to Comoro Airfield, Dili, on 20 September 1999;<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.39.</ref> 381ECSS began arriving at Cakung Airfield, Baucau on 11 October 1999.<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.56.</ref> 2AFDS undertook static security, access control and reconnaissance patrol tasks, in addition to establishing observation posts and providing a Quick Reaction Force (QRF).

The additional manpower also allowed the squadron to assume responsibility for the Dili heliport in December.<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.94.</ref>\n\n2AFDS was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation and the Commanding Officer, Squadron Leader J.D. Leo, received the Distinguished Service Medal for performance during [[Operation Warden]].<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.133.</ref>\n\n===Solomon Islands===\nADGs and GRDEFOs deployed to Henderson Field, Honiara as part of the RAAF component of Joint Task Force 635 on [[Operation Anode]], the ADF contribution to the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands|Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI)]]. Following severe rioting in April 2006, members of 2AFDS were deployed as part of the ADF response to support police in reestablishing law and order. A further link with the Solomon Islands exists via Protective Service Officer Adam Dunning of the Australian Federal Police, who was shot and killed in Honiara in December 2004. Although deployed to the Solomon Islands in his civilian role, Dunning was a reservist ADG and had previously served with 2AFDS in East Timor.\n\n===Iraq===\n[[Image:USAF RAAF guards 031103-F-0000S-001.jpg|thumb|Two Airfield Defence Guards (at left and second from the right) with members of the USAF 447th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron at [[Baghdad International Airport]]]]\nAs part of [[Operation Catalyst]], ADGs provided force protection to the RAAF air traffic control detachment at Baghdad International Airport, during 2003\u201304.<ref>[[#refDoDWeb|Dept of Defence website]] Accessed on 6 July 2008</ref> Thirteen ADGs from 2AFDS deployed to Baghdad with Security Detachment (SECDET) 13, the Australian combat team providing security for the Australian Embassy and close protection for officials.<ref>[[#refNyhan2008|Nyhan 2008]], p.9</ref> The ADGs were integrated within the infantry component of SECDET 13, drawn from the [[7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (7RAR).

Upon completion of trade training ADGs may wear the blue-grey beret which identifies them as a ground defence specialist.\n\nAirmen graduate from ADG Basic course with the rank of Aircraftman (AC) and are posted to one of the 3 Security Forces Squadrons. Following a further 12 months service and favourable reporting, ADGs are reclassified to the rank of Leading Aircraftman (LAC). Post-graduate training may be undertaken to qualify in communications, field engineering/assault pioneer, direct fire support weapons, close personal protection and sniping;<ref>[[#refDFRTWeb|Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> the majority of these courses being undertaken at Army training establishments. Further promotion is based upon minimum periods in rank, successful completion of appropriate trade and promotion courses, performance reporting and availability of positions. All ADGs must qualify as weapon instructors prior to promotion to NCO rank. Out of mustering postings may be available, with ADGs having served within [[Australia's Federation Guard]], as career advisers within a Defence Recruiting Centre and as Military Skills Instructors (MSIs) at [[No. 1 Recruit Training Unit RAAF|No. 1 Recruit Training Unit (1RTU)]], [[RAAF Base Wagga|RAAF Base Wagga Wagga]] and Officer Training School (OTS), [[RAAF Base East Sale]].\n\n==Duties and mission roles==\n[[File:Royal Australian Air Force security forces conduct a patrol through Tarin Kowt in March 2013.jpg|thumb|RAAF security force personnel patrolling through [[Tarin Kowt]] in Afghanistan during 2013]]\nADGs form the basis of the Air Force's ground combat force, protecting Base assets, infrastructure and personnel against attack by enemy ground forces. For planning purposes, a nominal Area of Operations (AO) for RAAF ground defence is usually extends to five kilometres from the airfield [[perimeter fence]]; in practice, however, the AO assigned to ADGs is determined by variables such as available forces, terrain, vegetation etc. ADGs are trained and equipped to locate, fix and destroy enemy ground forces, ideally during the reconnaissance phase of any intended attack on RAAF assets. This is achieved by the deployment of multiple patrol teams, usually consisting of 4\u20135 members, undertaking reconnaissance patrols, observation and listening posts. These teams are supported by specialist elements including snipers operating in a counter-sniper role. Once the enemy are located, forces are concentrated to engage and destroy their capability to complete their task. ADGs also provide a Base Commander with a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) mounted in wheeled vehicles. QRF teams are heavily armed and act as a mobile reserve to provide a counter-attack or counter-penetration capability should an enemy evade the patrol screen.\n\nIn addition to their operational role ADG instructors provide essential ground defence training to the remainder of the RAAF. This includes instruction in weapon handling, ground defence and security tactics and Chemical, Biological, Radiologican and Nuclear (CBRN) defence. Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) may be posted to instructional positions at 1RTU; OTS; the [[Australian Defence Force Academy|Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA)]], [[Canberra]]; [[Combat Survival Training School RAAF|Combat Survival Training School]] (CSTS, also known as COMSURV), [[RAAF Base Townsville]]; RAAF Security & Fire School, RAAF Base Amberley or a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any RAAF Base in Australia.\n\n===Tasks performed by ADGs===\n[[File:RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules during Cope North 2018.jpg|thumb|A RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules aircraft during an exercise in 2018]]\n* patrolling over extended periods over arduous terrain and in extreme climatic conditions carrying a specified load necessary to accomplish the mission;\n* foot and vehicle patrolling by day and by night in and around both established and bare base airfields and through vegetated or urban environments in all extremities of weather conditions and locations within or outside of Australia;\n* manning of Observation Posts (OPs), Listening Posts (LPs) and standing patrols to detect and interdict enemy movement\n* Quick Reaction Force (QRF) duties in response to identified threats;\n* Aircraft Security Operations providing protection to both aircraft and infrastructure;\n* construction of field defences and obstacles such as weapon pits and bunkers, fences and vehicle check points (VCPs);\n* search and clearance operations;\n* manning of crew served weapons such as machine guns and anti-armour weapons;\n* security for special events;\n* instruction on small arms including pistols, rifles, shotguns and [[Light Support Weapon]]s (LSWs);\n* instruction in Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) defence; and\n* instruction in individual and unit ground defence tactics and techniques.\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:RAAF Bushmaster.JPG|thumb|An RAAF Bushmaster]]\nThe weapons and equipment issued to ADGs are similar to standard [[Royal Australian Infantry Corps|Australian infantry]] [[Weaponry of the Australian Army|equipment]].\n\n===Weapons===\n* [[Browning Hi-Power|L9A1/L9A3 Self Loading Pistol (Browning Hi-Power)]]\n* [[Heckler & Koch MP5|Heckler & Koch MP5 sub-machine gun]]\n* [[Steyr AUG|F88 Austeyr rifle (Steyr AUG)]]\n* [[SR-25|SR25 Marksman Rifle]]\n* [[Accuracy International Arctic Warfare|Accuracy International SR-98 sniper rifle]]\n* [[FN Minimi|F89 Light Support Weapon (Minimi)]]\n* [[FN MAG|MAG58 General-Purpose Machine Gun]]\n* [[M203 grenade launcher]]<ref>[http://www.airforce.gov.au/adg/weapons.aspx RAAF Airfield Defence Guard webpage] Retrieved: 6 January 2009.</ref> (as part of the [[F88 Austeyr#Australian|F88 GLA Austeyr rifle]])\n* [[M72 LAW|M72 Light Anti-armour Weapon]]\n* [[Carl Gustav recoilless rifle]]\n* F1 hand grenade\n* [[Remington Model 870]] 12-gauge shotgun\n\nThe primary weaponry used by ADGs consists of the F88 Austeyr (with or without the M203 Grenade Launcher Attachment), F89 Minimi, and the Browning Hi-Power Self Loading Pistol.

It is believed to have evolved from pre-classical music and theatre during the period of the [[Bhakti]] movement.<ref name=\"preclassical\">Prof. Sridhara Uppura; 1998; ''Yakshagana and Nataka Diganta''; publications.</ref> It is sometimes simply called \"Aata\" or ''\u0101\u1e6da'' (\"the play\" in [[Tulu Language]]).<ref name=\"enduring\"/> This theatre style is mainly found in coastal regions of Karnataka in various forms. Towards the south from Udupi to Kasaragod of [[Tulu Nadu]] region, the form of Yakshagana called as 'Badagu thittu' and towards north upto Uttara Canara it's called 'Thenku Thittu'. Both of these forms equally played all over the region.  Yakshagana is traditionally presented from dusk to dawn. Its stories are drawn from [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]], [[Bhagavata]] and other epics from both [[Hindu]] and [[Jain]] and other ancient Indic traditions.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8edkLcxSUYAC&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=Yakshagana+jain&source=bl&ots=MZbE6xmCuu&sig=6be_3MCHXgMHFe8c9TIwsm3E_Is&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL17bW8djYAhVo04MKHeJ-AyMQ6AEITzAI#v=onepage&q=Yakshagana%20jain&f=false Yakshagana, Martha Bush Ashton, Abhinav Publications, 1976,  p. 27]</ref><ref>http://kasargod.nic.in/profile/yakshagana.htm</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Yakshagana'' literally means the people(''gana'') who are the ''[[yaksha]]'' (nature spirits).<ref name=eb>{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9077732/yaksha| title=yaksha|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica| accessdate=6 September 2007}}</ref> Yakshagana is the scholastic name (used for the last 200 years) for art forms formerly known as ''k\u0113\u1e37ike, \u0101\u1e6da, [[Bayalaata|bayal\u0101\u1e6da]],'' and ''da\u015b\u0101vat\u0101ra''. The word Yakshagana previously referred to a form of literature in Tulu, Kannada and even now in Telugu. Performance of this Yakshagana literature or the play is called \u0101\u1e6da. It is now no longer believed that the word Ekkalagaana refers to Yakshagana.\n\n===Music genre===\n[[File:Yakshagana Progress1.jpg|200px|thumb|[[File:Yaksha2.jpg|thumb|Karavali Gandu Kale Yakshagana]]Yakshagana performance in progress]]\nYakshagana has a separate tradition of music, separate from [[Karnataka Sangeetha]] and the Hindustani music of India. Yakshagana and Karnatak Sangeetha may have a common ancestor are not decedents of one another.<ref name=\"Shivarama\">Dr. Shivarama Karantha; ''Yakshagana Bayalaata''; Harsha Publications; 1963; Puttur, South Canara, India.</ref>\n\nA typical Yakshagana performance consists of background music played by a group of musicians (known as the ''himmela''); and a dance and dialogue group (known as the ''mummela''), who together enact [[Yakshagana poetry|poetic epics]] on stage. The himmela is made up of a lead singer (''bhagawatha'')\u2014who also directs the production\u2014and is referred to as the \"first actor\" (''modalane vesha''). Additional himmela members are players of traditional musical instruments, such as the ''[[maddale]]'' (hand drum), the ''[[pungi]]'' (pipe), the ''[[Pump organ|harmonium]]'' (organ), and the ''[[chande]]'' (loud drums). The music is based on ''[[Yakshagana Raga|ragas]]'', which are characterised by rhythmic patterns called ''mattu'' and ''[[Yakshagana Tala|tala]]'' (or [[Metre (music)|musical meter]] in Western music).\n\nA Yakshagana(\u0caf\u0c95\u0ccd\u0cb7\u0c97\u0cbe\u0ca8) performance typically begins in the twilight hours, with an initial beating of the drums of several fixed compositions, called ''abbara'' or ''peetike''. This may last for up to an hour before the actors finally arrive on the stage. The actors wear resplendent costumes, head-dresses, and face paints.<ref>[http://www.yakshagana.com/ ''Yakshagana'']; accessed 2 November 2013</ref>\n\nA performance usually depicts a story from the \"[[Indian epic poetry|Kavya]]\" (epic poems) and the \"[[Puranas]]\" (ancient [[Hindu]] texts). It consists of a story teller (the ''bhagawatha'') who narrates the story by singing (which includes prepared character dialogues) as the actors dance to the music, portraying elements of the story as it is being narrated. All components of Yakshagana\u2014including the music, the dance, and the dialogue\u2014are improvised. Depending on the ability and scholarship of the actors, there will be variations in dances as well as the amount of dialogue. It is not uncommon for actors to get into philosophical debates or arguments without falling out of character. The acting in Yakshagana can be best categorised as [[method acting]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}  The performances have drawn comparison to the Western tradition of opera. Traditionally, Yakshagana will run all night.\n\nYakshagana is popular in the districts of [[Dakshina Kannada]], [[Kasaragod District|Kasaragod]], [[Udupi]], [[Uttara Kannada]] [[Shimoga]] and western parts of [[chikkamagaluru]] .<ref>{{cite web |url= http://kasargod.nic.in/profile/yakshagana.htm| title= Yakshagana}}</ref> Yakshagana has become popular in [[Bengaluru]] in recent years, particularly in the rainy season, when there are few other forms of entertainment possible in the coastal districts.<ref name=\"enduring\">{{cite news | url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/06/17/stories/2009061757640300.htm|title=  The changing face of Yakshagana |work=Online webpage of The Hindu| publisher=The Hindu | accessdate=6 September 2007| location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\n{{Hinduism}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|List of Yakshagana plays in the Kannada language}}\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Yakshagana (Karaavali Gandukale).jpg|thumb|246x246px|\nThenkuthittu Yakshagana\n]]\n[[File:Yakshagana 123.jpg|thumb|yakshagana artist ravi alevoraya in female role]]\n[[File:Demon Yakshagana.jpg|thumb|200px|''Rakshasa'' (the demon) as depicted in Yakshagana performances, is called ''Bannada Vesha'']]\n\nYakshagana can refer to a style of writing, as well as the written material itself. It was probably used for poems enacted in [[bayalaata]] (or ''open theatre drama''), such as the ballads of [[Koti and Chennayya]]. Yakshagana in its present form is believed to have been strongly influenced by the [[Bhakti movement|Vaishnava Bhakti movement]]. Yakshagana was first introduced in Udupi by [[Madhvacharya]]'s disciple [[Naraharitirtha]]. [[Naraharitirtha]] was the minister in the Kalinga Kingdom. He also was the founder of [[Kuchipudi]].\n\nThe first written evidence regarding Yakshagana is found on an inscription at the [[Lakshminarayana Temple, Hosaholalu|Lakshminarayana Temple]] in [[Kurugodu]], Somasamudra, [[Bellary District]], and is dated 1556 CE. A copy is available at the University of Madras.<ref name=martha>{{cite book | title=Yakshagana, a Dance Drama of India| last=Martha Bush Ashton| first= Bruce Christie| authorlink= |year=1977| publisher=Abhinav Publications| location=New Delhi| isbn= | page=21,22| accessdate=8 August 2012| url=https://books.google.com/?id=ug3DNI-1xwUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=arasikere+history#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> The inscription mentions land donated to the performers of the art, so as to enable people to enjoy ''tala maddale'' programs at the temple. Another important piece of evidence is available in the form of a poem authored by Ajapura Vishnu, the ''Virata Parva'', inscribed on a palm-leaf found at [[Brahmavara|Ajapura]] (present day Brahmavara).<ref name=martha/> Another historic palm-leaf manuscript, dated 1621 CE, describes ''Sabhalakshana''.<ref name=martha/>\n\nYakshagana bears some resemblance to other members of the 'traditional theatre family:' ''Ankhia Nata'' (found in [[Assam]]); ''Jathra'' (in [[Bengal]]); ''Chau'' ([[Bihar]], Bengal); ''Prahlada Nata'' ([[Orissa, India|Orissa]]); ''Veedhinatakam'' & ''Chindu'' ([[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]]); ''Terukoothu Bhagawathamela'' ([[Tamil Nadu]]), and ''[[Kathakali]]'' (Kerala). However, some researchers have argued that Yakshagana is markedly different from this group.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nExperts have placed the origin of Yakshagana somewhere in the period of the 11th to 16th centuries CE.<ref name=\"origin\">{{cite news | url=http://www.hindu.com/ms/2005/12/23/stories/2005122300250500.htm| title=The Hindu- Focus on rural art| publisher=The Hindu| accessdate=6 September 2007| location=Chennai, India| date=23 December 2005}}</ref> Yakshagana was an established performance art form by the time of the noted Yakshagana poet, Parthi Subba (c. 1600).<ref name=\"Shivarama\"/> His father, Venkata, is attributed by some to be the author of the great Hindu epic, [[Ramayana]], although historian [[K. Shivaram Karanth|Shivaram Karanth]] counters these claims (made most notably by historians Muliya Thimmappa and Govinda Pai)<ref>Note: This due to what Karantha describes as procedural lapses in their research and conclusions.  Karantha bases his claim on the fact that Venkata was reported to be a bhagawatha (singer) himself, and is believed to have founded his own troupe.</ref> and argues that it is Subba, who was in fact its author.<ref name=\"Shivarama\"/> Venkata is the probable founder of the tenkuthittu (southern) style of the art.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nTroupe centers, such as [[Koodli|Koodlu]] and [[Kumbla|Kumbala]] in the [[Kasaragod District]], and [[Chikkamagaluru district|Amritheshwari]], Kota near [[Kundapura]], claim to have had troupes three to four centuries ago, indicating that the art form almost certainly had begun to take shape by circa 1500.\n\nThe Yakshagana form of today is the result of a slow evolution, drawing its elements from ritual theatre, temple arts, secular arts (such as [[Bahurupi]]), royal courts of the past, and the artists' imaginations\u2014all interwoven over a period of several hundred years.<ref name=\"origin\"/>\n\n===Early poets===\nEarly Yakshagana poets included Ajapura Vishnu, [[Purandaradasa]], Parthi Subba, and Nagire Subba.

Practitioners of the day produced a number of new compositions. Also, a large number of troupes arose across coastal Karnataka.\n\nThe early 20th century saw the birth of 'tent' troupes, giving performances to audiences made up of common people who were admitted by ticket. These troupes were responsible for the commercialisation of Yakshagana. The genre saw major changes in form and organisation. Electrical lights replaced the gas lights; seating arrangements improved; the inclusion of folk epics, Sanskrit dramas, and fictional stories formed the modern thematic base of the discipline.  Popular entertainment became the criterion, replacing the historic classical presentations. Tulu, the language of the southern part of the [[Dakshina Kannada]] and [[Udupi]] district's was introduced; increasing popularity with the common people.\n\nAt this time, writer Kota Shivaram Karanth, experimented with the dance form by introducing Western musical instrumentation. He reduced the time of a Yakshagana performances from 12 hours to under three hours, incorporated movie plot lines, and added Shakespearean themes.<ref>Hapgood, Robert; 1983; ''Macbeth Distilled: A ''Yakshagana'' Production in Delhi'']; \"[[Shakespeare Quarterly]];\" Vol. 31; No. 3; Autumn, 1980; pp. 439-440.</ref> Today, female artists perform in Yakshagana shows.\n\n===Parallel forms===\n[[File:Akrura1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Panar Vesha, an imitation of Yakshagana (photo taken at Vandar Kambla, Udupi district)]]\nYakshagana is related to other performance art forms prevalent in other parts of Karnataka and the neighbouring states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Kerala]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Maharashtra]].<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/fr/2005/10/14/stories/2005101402510300.htm ''Growing with Tradition'']; 14 October 2005 article; [[Hindu.com]]; accessed November 2013</ref> Yakshagana defies simple classification into categories such as folk, classical, or rural. It can be included in each or all of these, depending upon the rules used for classification. It is more varied and dynamic than most dance forms. Yakshagana can, however, be classified as one of many traditional dance forms.  While it prevails primarily in the coastal areas of Karnataka, other dance forms (such as Doddata) are today often called by the same name.  Several forms of traditional theatre \u2013 ''Mudalpaya'' (of southern Karnataka); ''Doddata'' (of northern Karnataka); ''Kelike'' (on the border with [[Andhra Pradesh]]);<ref>http://www.rangashankara.org/home/rangatest/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=32&favm=2010-11-1</ref> and ''Ghattadakore'' (of [[Kollegal]]\u2014in the [[Chamarajnagar District]]), may be included in this category.

The influence of Karnatic Music is apparent in tenkutittu, as evidenced by the type of maddale used and in bhaagavathike. Yakshagana is influenced more by folk art blended with classical dance aspects. In tenkutittu, three iconic set of colors are used: the ''Raajabanna'', the ''Kaatbanna'', and the ''Sthreebanna''.\n\nThe himmela in the tenkutittu style is more cohesive to the entire production. Rhythms of the chande and maddale coupled with the ''chakrataala'' and ''jaagate'' of the bhaagavatha create an excellent symphonic sound. The dance form in tenkutittu strikes the attention of the audience by 'Dheengina' or 'Guttu'. Performers often do ''dhiginas'' (jumping spins in the air) and will continuously spin (sometimes) hundreds of times. Tenkutittu is noted for its incredible dance steps; its high flying dance moves; and its extravagant ''rakshasas'' (demons).\n\nTenkutittu has remained a popular form and has its own audience outside the coastal areas. The Dharmasthala and Kateelu durgaparameshwari melas (the two most popular melas) have helped to popularise this form. Several creative tenkutittu plays have been composed by noted scholars, such as [[Amritha Someshwara]].<ref name=\"Yakshagana\">{{cite web |title=Tenkuthittu| url=http://worldtuluvasnetwork.com/yakshagana}}</ref>\n\n===Badagutittu===\nThe ''Badagutittu'' style is prevalent in [[North Canara]] (Uttara Kannada District) and the northern parts of [[Udupi Dist]] from Kundapura to Byndoor, The Badagutittu school of Yakshagana places more emphasis on facial expressions, ''matugarike'' (dialogues), and dances appropriate for the character depicted in the episode.

He hails from the [[Honnavar]] taluk of [[Uttara Kannada]] (North Canara) District.\n\n===Puppetry variant===\nThere were more than 30 string-puppet troupes in the undivided [[Dakshina Kannada]] district during the period 1910\u20131915 in places such as Basrur, Barkur, Kokkarne, Mudabidri.<ref name=\"Pre historic art in Karnataka\">{{Cite news|url=http://legacykarnataka.com/art_craft_in_karnataka.htm| author=Dr. A Sundara| title=Pre historic art in Karnataka}}</ref>\nThe presentation of the puppetry in Yakshagana style is highly stylised and adheres strictly to the norms and standards of Yakshagana.

The modern form of the art, however, was largely moulded by the brothers Laxman, Narasimha, and Manjappa Kamath; who hailed from [[Uppinakudru]] village, [[Kundapur]] taluk.  Devanna Padmanabha Kamath, the grandson of Laxman Kamath infused new life into the art and performed shows all over India. Later, [[Kogga Devanna Kamath]] improved this subgenre even further, being recognised with the [[Tulsi Samman]] and [[Sangeet Natak Akademi Award]]s. His son, Bhaskar Kogga Kamath, is currently performing shows while training others in the art of Yakshagana puppetry.<ref name=\"kogga\">{{cite news | url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2006/03/07/stories/2006030700020300.htm| title=Award for achievement| work=Online webpage of The Hindu| publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=6 September 2007| location=Chennai, India| date=7 March 2006}}</ref> [[K.

It is based on pre-classical melodic forms that comprise a series of five or more [[musical notes]] upon which a [[melody]] is founded. Ragas in Yakshagana are closely associated with a set of melodic forms called mattu. In the Yakshagana tradition, r\u0101gas are associated with different times of the night throughout which the Yakshagana is performed.\n\n===Tala===\n{{Main|Yakshagana Tala}}\nYakshagana Tala ([[Sanskrit]] t\u0101la) are frameworks for rhythms in Yakshagana that are determined by a poetry style called ''Yakshagana Padya''. Tala also decide how a composition is to be enacted by the dancers. It is similar to tala in other forms of Indian music, but differs from them structurally. Each composition is set to one or more talas, rendered by the himmela percussion artists play.<ref name=\"preclassical\"/><ref name=\"Yakshagana\"/>\n\n===Prasanga and literature===\n{{Main|Yakshagana poetry}}\nYakshagana poetry (Yakshagana Padya or Yakshagana Prasanga) is a collection of poems written to form a music drama.  The poems are composed in well known Kannada metres, using a frame work of [[Yakshagana Raga|ragas]] and [[Yakshagana Tala|talas]]. Yakshagana also has its own metre (or ''[[Prosody (music)|prosody]]''). The collection of Yakshagana poems forming a musical drama is called a ''Prasanga''. The oldest surviving parasanga books are believed to have been composed in the 15th century.<ref>Prof Sridhara Uppura; ''Diganta Sahitya'' publications; Managalore; 1998.</ref> But many compositions have been lost to time. There is evidence showing that oral compositions were in use before the 15th century. The narratives of the surviving historic Yakshagana Prasangas are now often printed in paperback.<ref name=\"cambridge\"/>\n\n[[File:kereetadavesha.jpg|thumb|250px|A kings costume (''raja vesha'') with ''kireeta'' (or headgear); the [[Gada (mace)|mace]] is used as an abstract depiction of a weapon]]\n[[File:FullPagadeYakshagana.jpg|right|thumb|Artists Headwear,Worn by Male Artists where Female artists wear small one]]\n\n===Costumes and ornaments===\nYakshagna costumes are rich in color. The costumes (or ''vesha'') in [[Kannada]] depend on characters depicted in the play (prasanga).  It also depends on the Yakshagana style (''tittu'').\n\nTraditionally, Badagutittu Yakshagana ornaments are made out of light wood, pieces of mirror, and colored stones.<ref>[http://www.craftandartisans.com/yakshagana-costumes-of-karnataka.html ''Yakshagana Costumes of Karnataka'']; \"The Craft and Artisans\"; accessed November 2013</ref> Lighter materials, such as thermocol, are sometimes used today, although ornaments are still predominantly made of woodwork.\n\nYakshagana costumes consist of headgear (Kirita or Pagade), Kavacha that decorates the chest, Buja Keerthi (armlets) that decorate the shoulders, and belts (Dabu)\u2014all made up of light wood and covered with golden foil.  Mirror work on these ornaments helps to reflect light during shows and add more color to the costumes. Armaments are worn on a vest and cover the upper half of the body.  The lower half is covered with [[Dhoti|kachche]], which come in unique combinations of red, yellow, and orange checks.  Bulky pads are used under the kachche, making the actors' proportions different in size from normal.\n\nThe character, Bannada Vesha, is used to depict monsters.  This often involves detailed facial makeup taking three to four hours to complete.  Males play the female roles in traditional Yakshagana.  However, more recently, yakshagana has seen female artists, who perform in both male and female roles.\n\nThe character of Stree Vesha makes use of sari and other decorative ornaments.\n\n==Instruments==\n\n===Maddale===\n{{Main|Maddale}}\nThe maddale is a [[percussion instrument]] and, along with the chande, is the primary rhythmic accompaniment in the Yakshagana ensemble. It is played in a similar fashion as Mridangam.\n\n===Taala (Bells)===\n[[Yakshagana bells]] or cymbals, are a pair of finger bells made of a special alloy (traditionally five metal). They are made to fit the tone of the bhagawatha's voice.  Singers carry more than one set, as finger bells are available in different keys, thus enabling them to sing in different pitches. They help create and guide the background music in Yakshagana.\n\n===Chande===\n{{Main|Chande}}\nThe Chande is a [[drum]] and, along with the maddale, is an important rhythmic accompaniment in the Yakshagana ensemble.\n\n==Artists==\n{{Main|List of Yakshagana artists}}\nOver the centuries, hundreds of artists performed Yakshagana and some of them have gained star value, like [[Siddakatte Chennappa Shetty]], [[Chittani Ramachandra Hegde]], [[Naranappa Uppoor]] and [[Kalinga Navada]].\n\n==Training and research==\nAs most troupes are associated with temples, training in the art has been confined to temple premises. The Govinda Pai Research Institute, located at [[MGM College]], runs a ''Yakshagana Kalakendra'' in [[Udupi]] trains youngsters in this ancient dance form.  It also does research work on language, rituals, and dance art forms.<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/2006/10/05/stories/2006100517770300.htm The Hindu-Yakshagana Kendra has effectively popularised the art form]</ref> Srimaya Yakshagana Kalakendra, Gunavante which was founded by Shri Keremane Shambhu Hegde, is another notable Yakshagana [[Gurukula]] that trains Yakshagana students .\n\n==Outside India==\n{{unsourced section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Yakshagana Bhasmasura-Mohini.jpg|thumb|\"Bhasmasura Mohini\" played at California in 2011]]\nYakshagana is finding new popularity outside India.  Amateur troupes have emerged in [[California]], USA and [[Ontario]], Canada. ''Yakshamitra in Canada'', ''Yakshagana Kalavrinda'', ''Yaksharanga in the U.S.'' \"Yakshaloka Boston\" are a few examples of these international troupes.\n\n''Yakshamitra'' founded in 2008 in [[Toronto]], Canada, is the first full pledged Yakshagana mela outside India. It is the first to use local live music himmela for their performances. The other troupes usually use a recorded background himmela for their shows.\n\n\"Yakshaloka USA\" was founded in New England by Raghuram Shetty in 1995 and used recorded audio for shows. Being the first build a local Yakshagana troupe (\"Yakshaloka Boston\") in North America and introduce tenku tiTTu (Southern style) Yakshagana to this continent, he trained thousands of local Americans and inspired 5 Yakshagana troupes (Massachusetts, Washington, Florida, Northern and Southern California). Including shows like Sindh World Conference 2000, AKKA 2002, Saint Peters-burg Folk Festival 2005, Irvine Global Village 2014 etc. Yakshaloka USA has showcased hundreds of multi-lingual shows in major theatres across USA in both styles of Yakshagana. Yakshaloka promotes vibrant ancient Indian art by creating unique shows of its own, presentations in schools and Universities including worlds leading acting schools in Hollywood, training kids and adults from all over the world, joining hands with visiting artists (E.g.: Northern style legend Chittani Ramachandra Hegde troupe 2006), and sponsoring/facilitating leading artists (E.g.: Southern style legend Dr Puttur Shridhara Bhandary 2013).\n\nYakshagana Kalavrinda performs on the east coast of the U.S.\n\"Yakshaloka Boston\" troupe has mainly the artists from Boston area and visiting artists from various parts of USA and India. The troupe has given many shows in the east coast, Midwest, southern USA.\n\nYaksharanga in the USA started after the visit of Yakshagana artist, Sri [[Chittani Ramachandra Hegde]].  His performance at the age of 74 was so inspiring that art lovers decided to continue his art thousands of miles away from its home.  Sri Kidayuru Ganesh, who accompanied Sri Chittani, stayed back for a couple of months to train a new generation of Yakshagana artists. The initial result was a performance of Yakshagana \"Sudanvarjuna Kalaga\".  Hegde won the [[List of Padma Shri award recipients (2010\u201319)|Padmashri Award]] in 2012 for his lifetime contribution to the art. Yaksharanga has since performed many shows around California.\n\nYakshagana Troupe, \"[[Idagunji Mahaganapathi Yakshagana Mandali|Shri Idagunji Mahaganapati Yakshagana Mandali, Keremane]],\" headed by Shri Keremane Shambhu Hegde and Shri Keremane Shivanand Hegde, toured the U.S., and performed more than 22 programs throughout North America.  The troupe visited 12 countries. This troupe was one of the first few troupes that took Yakshagana (in its traditional form) outside India (referring to their performance at Hilton Hotel, Bahrain in 1983).\n\n==Mela or troupes==\nThere are about 30 full-fledged professional troupes, and about 200 amateur troupes in Yakshagana. Professional troupes go on tour between November to May, giving about 180-200 shows. There are about one thousand professional artists and many more amateurs. Further there are off season shows during the wet season, the anniversary shows, school and college students Yakshagana and of course the Talamaddale performances. Yakshagana commercial shows witness 12,000 performances per year in Karnataka generating a turnover of Rs. Six crore.<ref name=\"shows\">{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/07/09/stories/2007070959120300.htm|title=  Open study-chairs for research on Yakshagana|work=Online webpage of The Hindu|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=6 September 2007|location=Chennai, India|date=9 July 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"performance\">{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1061121/asp/calcutta/story_7028358.asp |title=Traditional touch in theatre |work=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]] |location=Kolkata |accessdate=6 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"95%\"\n|-\n!

It is believed to have evolved from pre-classical music and theatre during the period of the [[Bhakti]] movement.<ref name=\"preclassical\">Prof. Sridhara Uppura; 1998; ''Yakshagana and Nataka Diganta''; publications.</ref> It is sometimes simply called \"Aata\" or ''\u0101\u1e6da'' (\"the play\" in [[Tulu Language]]).<ref name=\"enduring\"/> This theatre style is mainly found in coastal regions of Karnataka in various forms. Towards the south from Udupi to Kasaragod of [[Tulu Nadu]] region, the form of Yakshagana called as 'Badagu thittu' and towards north upto Uttara Canara it's called 'Thenku Thittu'. Both of these forms equally played all over the region.  Yakshagana is traditionally presented from dusk to dawn. Its stories are drawn from [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]], [[Bhagavata]] and other epics from both [[Hindu]] and [[Jain]] and other ancient Indic traditions.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8edkLcxSUYAC&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=Yakshagana+jain&source=bl&ots=MZbE6xmCuu&sig=6be_3MCHXgMHFe8c9TIwsm3E_Is&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL17bW8djYAhVo04MKHeJ-AyMQ6AEITzAI#v=onepage&q=Yakshagana%20jain&f=false Yakshagana, Martha Bush Ashton, Abhinav Publications, 1976,  p. 27]</ref><ref>http://kasargod.nic.in/profile/yakshagana.htm</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Yakshagana'' literally means the people(''gana'') who are the ''[[yaksha]]'' (nature spirits).<ref name=eb>{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9077732/yaksha| title=yaksha|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica| accessdate=6 September 2007}}</ref> Yakshagana is the scholastic name (used for the last 200 years) for art forms formerly known as ''k\u0113\u1e37ike, \u0101\u1e6da, [[Bayalaata|bayal\u0101\u1e6da]],'' and ''da\u015b\u0101vat\u0101ra''. The word Yakshagana previously referred to a form of literature in Tulu, Kannada and even now in Telugu. Performance of this Yakshagana literature or the play is called \u0101\u1e6da. It is now no longer believed that the word Ekkalagaana refers to Yakshagana.\n\n===Music genre===\n[[File:Yakshagana Progress1.jpg|200px|thumb|[[File:Yaksha2.jpg|thumb|Karavali Gandu Kale Yakshagana]]Yakshagana performance in progress]]\nYakshagana has a separate tradition of music, separate from [[Karnataka Sangeetha]] and the Hindustani music of India. Yakshagana and Karnatak Sangeetha may have a common ancestor are not decedents of one another.<ref name=\"Shivarama\">Dr. Shivarama Karantha; ''Yakshagana Bayalaata''; Harsha Publications; 1963; Puttur, South Canara, India.</ref>\n\nA typical Yakshagana performance consists of background music played by a group of musicians (known as the ''himmela''); and a dance and dialogue group (known as the ''mummela''), who together enact [[Yakshagana poetry|poetic epics]] on stage. The himmela is made up of a lead singer (''bhagawatha'')\u2014who also directs the production\u2014and is referred to as the \"first actor\" (''modalane vesha''). Additional himmela members are players of traditional musical instruments, such as the ''[[maddale]]'' (hand drum), the ''[[pungi]]'' (pipe), the ''[[Pump organ|harmonium]]'' (organ), and the ''[[chande]]'' (loud drums). The music is based on ''[[Yakshagana Raga|ragas]]'', which are characterised by rhythmic patterns called ''mattu'' and ''[[Yakshagana Tala|tala]]'' (or [[Metre (music)|musical meter]] in Western music).\n\nA Yakshagana(\u0caf\u0c95\u0ccd\u0cb7\u0c97\u0cbe\u0ca8) performance typically begins in the twilight hours, with an initial beating of the drums of several fixed compositions, called ''abbara'' or ''peetike''. This may last for up to an hour before the actors finally arrive on the stage. The actors wear resplendent costumes, head-dresses, and face paints.<ref>[http://www.yakshagana.com/ ''Yakshagana'']; accessed 2 November 2013</ref>\n\nA performance usually depicts a story from the \"[[Indian epic poetry|Kavya]]\" (epic poems) and the \"[[Puranas]]\" (ancient [[Hindu]] texts). It consists of a story teller (the ''bhagawatha'') who narrates the story by singing (which includes prepared character dialogues) as the actors dance to the music, portraying elements of the story as it is being narrated. All components of Yakshagana\u2014including the music, the dance, and the dialogue\u2014are improvised. Depending on the ability and scholarship of the actors, there will be variations in dances as well as the amount of dialogue. It is not uncommon for actors to get into philosophical debates or arguments without falling out of character. The acting in Yakshagana can be best categorised as [[method acting]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}  The performances have drawn comparison to the Western tradition of opera. Traditionally, Yakshagana will run all night.\n\nYakshagana is popular in the districts of [[Dakshina Kannada]], [[Kasaragod District|Kasaragod]], [[Udupi]], [[Uttara Kannada]] [[Shimoga]] and western parts of [[chikkamagaluru]] .<ref>{{cite web |url= http://kasargod.nic.in/profile/yakshagana.htm| title= Yakshagana}}</ref> Yakshagana has become popular in [[Bengaluru]] in recent years, particularly in the rainy season, when there are few other forms of entertainment possible in the coastal districts.<ref name=\"enduring\">{{cite news | url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/06/17/stories/2009061757640300.htm|title=  The changing face of Yakshagana |work=Online webpage of The Hindu| publisher=The Hindu | accessdate=6 September 2007| location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\n{{Hinduism}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|List of Yakshagana plays in the Kannada language}}\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Yakshagana (Karaavali Gandukale).jpg|thumb|246x246px|\nThenkuthittu Yakshagana\n]]\n[[File:Yakshagana 123.jpg|thumb|yakshagana artist ravi alevoraya in female role]]\n[[File:Demon Yakshagana.jpg|thumb|200px|''Rakshasa'' (the demon) as depicted in Yakshagana performances, is called ''Bannada Vesha'']]\n\nYakshagana can refer to a style of writing, as well as the written material itself. It was probably used for poems enacted in [[bayalaata]] (or ''open theatre drama''), such as the ballads of [[Koti and Chennayya]]. Yakshagana in its present form is believed to have been strongly influenced by the [[Bhakti movement|Vaishnava Bhakti movement]]. Yakshagana was first introduced in Udupi by [[Madhvacharya]]'s disciple [[Naraharitirtha]]. [[Naraharitirtha]] was the minister in the Kalinga Kingdom. He also was the founder of [[Kuchipudi]].\n\nThe first written evidence regarding Yakshagana is found on an inscription at the [[Lakshminarayana Temple, Hosaholalu|Lakshminarayana Temple]] in [[Kurugodu]], Somasamudra, [[Bellary District]], and is dated 1556 CE.

Practitioners of the day produced a number of new compositions. Also, a large number of troupes arose across coastal Karnataka.\n\nThe early 20th century saw the birth of 'tent' troupes, giving performances to audiences made up of common people who were admitted by ticket. These troupes were responsible for the commercialisation of Yakshagana. The genre saw major changes in form and organisation. Electrical lights replaced the gas lights; seating arrangements improved; the inclusion of folk epics, Sanskrit dramas, and fictional stories formed the modern thematic base of the discipline.  Popular entertainment became the criterion, replacing the historic classical presentations. Tulu, the language of the southern part of the [[Dakshina Kannada|D.K.]] and [[Udupi]] district's was introduced; increasing popularity with the common people.\n\nAt this time, writer Kota Shivaram Karanth, experimented with the dance form by introducing Western musical instrumentation. He reduced the time of a Yakshagana performances from 12 hours to under three hours, incorporated movie plot lines, and added Shakespearean themes.<ref>Hapgood, Robert; 1983; ''Macbeth Distilled: A ''Yakshagana'' Production in Delhi'']; \"[[Shakespeare Quarterly]];\" Vol. 31; No. 3; Autumn, 1980; pp. 439-440.</ref>  Today, female artists perform in Yakshagana shows.\n\n===Parallel forms===\n[[File:Akrura1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Panar Vesha, an imitation of Yakshagana (photo taken at Vandar Kambla, Udupi district)]]\nYakshagana is related to other performance art forms prevalent in other parts of Karnataka and the neighbouring states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Kerala]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Maharashtra]].<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/fr/2005/10/14/stories/2005101402510300.htm ''Growing with Tradition'']; 14 October 2005 article; [[Hindu.com]]; accessed November 2013</ref> Yakshagana defies simple classification into categories such as folk, classical, or rural. It can be included in each or all of these, depending upon the rules used for classification. It is more varied and dynamic than most dance forms. Yakshagana can, however, be classified as one of many traditional dance forms.  While it prevails primarily in the coastal areas of Karnataka, other dance forms (such as Doddata) are today often called by the same name.  Several forms of traditional theatre \u2013 ''Mudalpaya'' (of southern Karnataka); ''Doddata'' (of northern Karnataka); ''Kelike'' (on the border with [[Andhra Pradesh]]);<ref>http://www.rangashankara.org/home/rangatest/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=32&favm=2010-11-1</ref> and ''Ghattadakore'' (of [[Kollegal]]\u2014in the [[Chamarajnagar District]]), may be included in this category.

The influence of Karnatic Music is apparent in tenkutittu, as evidenced by the type of maddale used and in bhaagavathike. Yakshagana is influenced more by folk art blended with classical dance aspects. In tenkutittu, three iconic set of colors are used: the ''Raajabanna'', the ''Kaatbanna'', and the ''Sthreebanna''.\n\nThe himmela in the tenkutittu style is more cohesive to the entire production. Rhythms of the chande and maddale coupled with the ''chakrataala'' and ''jaagate'' of the bhaagavatha create an excellent symphonic sound. The dance form in tenkutittu strikes the attention of the audience by 'Dheengina' or 'Guttu'. Performers often do ''dhiginas'' (jumping spins in the air) and will continuously spin (sometimes) hundreds of times. Tenkutittu is noted for its incredible dance steps; its high flying dance moves; and its extravagant ''rakshasas'' (demons).\n\nTenkutittu has remained a popular form and has its own audience outside the coastal areas. The Dharmasthala and Kateelu durgaparameshwari melas (the two most popular melas) have helped to popularise this form.

It is based on pre-classical melodic forms that comprise a series of five or more [[musical notes]] upon which a [[melody]] is founded. Ragas in Yakshagana are closely associated with a set of melodic forms called mattu. In the Yakshagana tradition, r\u0101gas are associated with different times of the night throughout which the Yakshagana is performed.\n\n===Tala===\n{{Main|Yakshagana Tala}}\nYakshagana Tala ([[Sanskrit]] t\u0101la) are frameworks for rhythms in Yakshagana that are determined by a poetry style called ''Yakshagana Padya''. Tala also decide how a composition is to be enacted by the dancers. It is similar to tala in other forms of Indian music, but differs from them structurally. Each composition is set to one or more talas, rendered by the himmela percussion artists play.<ref name=\"preclassical\"/><ref name=\"Yakshagana\"/>\n\n===Prasanga and literature===\n{{Main|Yakshagana poetry}}\nYakshagana poetry (Yakshagana Padya or Yakshagana Prasanga) is a collection of poems written to form a music drama.  The poems are composed in well known Kannada metres, using a frame work of [[Yakshagana Raga|ragas]] and [[Yakshagana Tala|talas]]. Yakshagana also has its own metre (or ''[[Prosody (music)|prosody]]''). The collection of Yakshagana poems forming a musical drama is called a ''Prasanga''. The oldest surviving parasanga books are believed to have been composed in the 15th century.<ref>Prof Sridhara Uppura; ''Diganta Sahitya'' publications; Managalore; 1998.</ref> But many compositions have been lost to time. There is evidence showing that oral compositions were in use before the 15th century.

The costumes (or ''vesha'') in [[Kannada]] depend on characters depicted in the play (prasanga).  It also depends on the Yakshagana style (''tittu'').\n\nTraditionally, Badagutittu Yakshagana ornaments are made out of light wood, pieces of mirror, and colored stones.<ref>[http://www.craftandartisans.com/yakshagana-costumes-of-karnataka.html ''Yakshagana Costumes of Karnataka'']; \"The Craft and Artisans\"; accessed November 2013</ref> Lighter materials, such as thermocol, are sometimes used today, although ornaments are still predominantly made of woodwork.\n\nYakshagana costumes consist of headgear (Kirita or Pagade), Kavacha that decorates the chest, Buja Keerthi (armlets) that decorate the shoulders, and belts (Dabu)\u2014all made up of light wood and covered with golden foil.  Mirror work on these ornaments helps to reflect light during shows and add more color to the costumes. Armaments are worn on a vest and cover the upper half of the body.  The lower half is covered with [[Dhoti|kachche]], which come in unique combinations of red, yellow, and orange checks.  Bulky pads are used under the kachche, making the actors' proportions different in size from normal.\n\nThe character, Bannada Vesha, is used to depict monsters.  This often involves detailed facial makeup taking three to four hours to complete.  Males play the female roles in traditional Yakshagana.  However, more recently, yakshagana has seen female artists, who perform in both male and female roles.\n\nThe character of Stree Vesha makes use of sari and other decorative ornaments.\n\n==Instruments==\n\n===Maddale===\n{{Main|Maddale}}\nThe maddale is a [[percussion instrument]] and, along with the chande, is the primary rhythmic accompaniment in the Yakshagana ensemble. It is played in a similar fashion as Mridangam.\n\n===Taala (Bells)===\n[[Yakshagana bells]] or cymbals, are a pair of finger bells made of a special alloy (traditionally five metal). They are made to fit the tone of the bhagawatha's voice.  Singers carry more than one set, as finger bells are available in different keys, thus enabling them to sing in different pitches. They help create and guide the background music in Yakshagana.\n\n===Chande===\n{{Main|Chande}}\nThe Chande is a [[drum]] and, along with the maddale, is an important rhythmic accompaniment in the Yakshagana ensemble.\n\n==Artists==\n{{Main|List of Yakshagana artists}}\nOver the centuries, hundreds of artists performed Yakshagana and some of them have gained star value, like [[Siddakatte Chennappa Shetty]], [[Chittani Ramachandra Hegde]], [[Naranappa Uppoor]] and [[Kalinga Navada]].\n\n==Training and research==\nAs most troupes are associated with temples, training in the art has been confined to temple premises. The Govinda Pai Research Institute, located at [[MGM College]], runs a ''Yakshagana Kalakendra'' in [[Udupi]] trains youngsters in this ancient dance form.  It also does research work on language, rituals, and dance art forms.<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/2006/10/05/stories/2006100517770300.htm The Hindu-Yakshagana Kendra has effectively popularised the art form]</ref>  Srimaya Yakshagana Kalakendra, Gunavante which was founded by Shri Keremane Shambhu Hegde, is another notable Yakshagana [[Gurukula]] that trains Yakshagana students .\n\n==Outside India==\n{{unsourced section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Yakshagana Bhasmasura-Mohini.jpg|thumb|\"Bhasmasura Mohini\" played at California in 2011]]\nYakshagana is finding new popularity outside India.  Amateur troupes have emerged in [[California]], USA and [[Ontario]], Canada. ''Yakshamitra in Canada'', ''Yakshagana Kalavrinda'', ''Yaksharanga in the U.S.'' \"Yakshaloka Boston\" are a few examples of these international troupes.\n\n''Yakshamitra'' founded in 2008 in [[Toronto]], Canada, is the first full pledged Yakshagana mela outside India. It is the first to use local live music himmela for their performances. The other troupes usually use a recorded background himmela for their shows.\n\n\"Yakshaloka USA\" was founded in New England by Raghuram Shetty in 1995 and used recorded audio for shows. Being the first build a local Yakshagana troupe (\"Yakshaloka Boston\") in North America and introduce tenku tiTTu (Southern style) Yakshagana to this continent, he trained thousands of local Americans and inspired 5 Yakshagana troupes (Massachusetts,  Washington, Florida, Northern and Southern California). Including shows like Sindh World Conference 2000, AKKA 2002, Saint Peters-burg Folk Festival 2005, Irvine Global Village 2014 etc. Yakshaloka USA has showcased hundreds of multi-lingual shows in major theatres across USA in both styles of Yakshagana. Yakshaloka promotes vibrant ancient Indian art by creating unique shows of its own, presentations in schools and Universities including worlds leading acting schools in Hollywood, training kids and adults from all over the world, joining hands with visiting artists (E.g.: Northern style legend Chittani Ramachandra Hegde troupe 2006), and sponsoring/facilitating leading artists (E.g.: Southern style legend Dr Puttur Shridhara Bhandary 2013).\n\nYakshagana Kalavrinda performs on the east coast of the U.S.\n\"Yakshaloka Boston\" troupe has mainly the artists from Boston area and visiting artists from various parts of USA and India. The troupe has given many shows in the east coast, Midwest, southern USA.\n\nYaksharanga in the USA started after the visit of Yakshagana artist, Sri [[Chittani Ramachandra Hegde]].  His performance at the age of 74 was so inspiring that art lovers decided to continue his art thousands of miles away from its home.  Sri Kidayuru Ganesh, who accompanied Sri Chittani, stayed back for a couple of months to train a new generation of Yakshagana artists. The initial result was a performance of Yakshagana \"Sudanvarjuna Kalaga\".  Hegde won the [[List of Padma Shri award recipients (2010\u201319)|Padmashri Award]] in 2012 for his lifetime contribution to the art. Yaksharanga has since performed many shows around California.\n\nYakshagana Troupe, \"[[Idagunji Mahaganapathi Yakshagana Mandali|Shri Idagunji Mahaganapati Yakshagana Mandali, Keremane]],\" headed by Shri Keremane Shambhu Hegde and Shri Keremane Shivanand Hegde, toured the U.S., and performed more than 22 programs throughout North America.  The troupe visited 12 countries. This troupe was one of the first few troupes that took Yakshagana (in its traditional form) outside India (referring to their performance at Hilton Hotel, Bahrain in 1983).\n\n==Mela or troupes==\nThere are about 30 full-fledged professional troupes, and about 200 amateur troupes in Yakshagana. Professional troupes go on tour between November to May, giving about 180-200 shows. There are about one thousand professional artists and many more amateurs.
