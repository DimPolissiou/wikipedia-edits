Gardel's [[baritone]] voice and the dramatic phrasing of his lyrics made miniature masterpieces of his hundreds of three-minute tango recordings. Together with lyricist and long-time collaborator [[Alfredo Le Pera]], Gardel wrote several classic tangos.\n\nGardel died in an airplane crash at the height of his career, becoming an archetypal tragic hero mourned throughout Latin America. For many, Gardel embodies the soul of the tango style. He is commonly referred to as \"Carlitos\", \"El Zorzal\" (The [Song] Thrush), \"The King of Tango\", \"El Mago\" (The Wizard), \"El Morocho del Abasto\" (The Brunette boy from Abasto), and ironically \"El Mudo\" (The Mute).\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:Gardel-Silva-1923.jpg|thumb|right|Gardel in [[gaucho]] clothes, 1923]]\nGardel was born to unmarried 25-year-old laundress Berthe Gard\u00e8s, the baby registered under the name Charles Romuald Gard\u00e8s in [[Tacuarembo]], [[Uruguay]], on 11 December 1890.<ref name=UNESCO1986/> The father of the baby boy was listed on his birth certificate as \"unknown\", but 11 days later Berthe Gard\u00e8s signed a statement establishing the baby's father as Paul Laserre, a married man who left Toulouse a few months before the baby was born.<ref name=Collier5/> Berthe Gard\u00e8s also left Toulouse, a little over a year later, likely to escape the social stigma of having a child born out of wedlock. In early 1893 in [[Bordeaux]], France, mother and son boarded the ship SS ''Don Pedro'' and sailed to Buenos Aires, arriving on 11 March 1893. Berthe Gard\u00e8s had her passport recorded upon arrival; she told immigration authorities that she was a widow. The two-year-old boy was recorded as Charles Gard\u00e8s.<ref name=Collier5/>\n\nGardel's mother settled at the western edge of the central [[San Nicol\u00e1s, Buenos Aires|San Nicol\u00e1s]] district of [[Buenos Aires]], at Calle Uruguay 162. She worked two blocks away on Calle Montevideo, pressing clothes in the French style, which commanded a relatively high price in the fashion-conscious city.<ref>Collier 1986, p. 6</ref> Gardel grew up speaking Spanish, not French, with friends and family calling him Carlos, the Spanish version of his French name, and often by the familiar diminutive form Carlitos.<ref>Collier 1986, pp. 7\u20138</ref>\n\nSome time after 1918, Laserre traveled from France to Buenos Aires to ask Berthe Gard\u00e8s, now called Do\u00f1a Berta, whether she would like to legitimize her son by marrying Laserre. This would have disrupted her story about being a widow. Gardel told his mother that if she did not need this man in her life, neither did he, closing the matter with \"I don't even wish to see him.\"<ref>Collier 1986, p. 7</ref>\n\n===Career===\nGardel began his singing career in bars and at private parties. He also sang with [[Francisco Martino]] and later in a trio with Martino and [[Jos\u00e9 Razzano]]. Gardel created the ''tango-canci\u00f3n'' in 1917 with his rendition of [[Pascual Contursi]] and [[Samuel Castriota]]'s ''[[Mi noche triste]]''. The recording sold 10,000 copies and was a hit throughout Latin America.<ref>Cunningham, Amy (3 July 2011). [http://www.soundsandcolours.com/articles/argentina/carlos-gardel-the-king-of-tango/ Carlos \"Gardel: The King of Tango\"], ''Sound and Colours''.</ref>\n\nGardel went on tour through Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Brazil, [[Centro Espa\u00f1ol de Ponce|Puerto Rico]], Venezuela and Colombia, as well as making appearances in Paris, New York, Barcelona and Madrid. He sold 70,000 records in the first three months of a 1928 visit to Paris. As his popularity grew, he made a number of films for [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] in France and the U.S. While sentimental films such as ''[[Downward Slope|Cuesta abajo]]'' (1934) and ''[[El d\u00eda que me quieras (1935 film)|El d\u00eda que me quieras]]'' (1935) lack lasting dramatic value, they were outstanding showcases of his tremendous singing talents and movie star looks.\n\n===Romantic life===\nGardel was aware of the fact that much of his popularity was based on his attractiveness to women. In an effort to seem as if he were available to any woman, he sought to keep his love life secret. Gardel had one major girlfriend in his life: Isabel del Valle. He met del Valle in late 1920 when she was fourteen years of age.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://todayintango.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/1907-march-16-birth-of-isabel-del-valle/|title=1907, March 16 \u2013 BIRTH OF ISABEL DEL VALLE|date=2011-03-16|work=TODAY IN TANGO !|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}</ref> At the time, he was performing at the Esmeralda Theater in Buenos Aires. They were close for more than a decade. Gardel and del Valle were not seen together very often in public. Gardel's mother and del Valle's family helped make sure the relationship was not well known. Only Gardel's closest friends knew about it.<ref>Collier 1986, p. 73.</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVfIus_mXzAC&pg=PA31 |pages=15, 91, 119, 139 |title=La sonrisa de Gardel: Biograf\u00eda, mito y ficci\u00f3n |first=Jorge |last=Ruffinelli |publisher=Ediciones Trilce |year=2004 |isbn=9974323568 |language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\nGardel arranged for del Valle to have a house; he provided money for her to live on. Around 1930 the relationship began to degrade. Gardel had his lawyer stop making payments to del Valle, who later married another man and moved to Uruguay. She was always respectful of the memory of Gardel, even when interviewed about him in late life for a 1980s television program.<ref>Collier 1986, pp. 121\u201322, 233, 210.</ref>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Procesion Gardel 1936.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The coffin of Gardel moves down Florida Street in Buenos Aires]]\n[[File:La tumba de Carlos Gardel.jpg|thumb|Carlos Gardel's grave at La [[Chacarita Cemetery]]]]\n\nGardel died on 24 June 1935 in an airplane crash in [[Medell\u00edn]], Colombia. Others who died included the pilot [[Ernesto Samper (pilot)|Ernesto Samper]], lyricist [[Alfredo Le Pera]], guitarists Guillermo Desiderio Barbieri and {{ill|\u00c1ngel Domingo Riverol|es}}, several business associates, and other friends of the group.<ref name=\"Clavell, M. 1996\">Clavell, M.

One month later he was issued a new Argentine identity card that listed him as a Uruguayan national. On 7 March 1923 he applied for citizenship in Argentina. On 1 May 1923 he took the oath of Argentine citizenship. Today, there is no absolute certainty regarding why he took these steps. The most likely reason for this act was to avoid problems with French authorities during an upcoming tour of France. As a French citizen by birth, Gardel had been required to register with the French military during the [[World War I|Great War]]. It is likely that Gardel never registered; his name is not found on any lists of registrants. Uruguay maintained a neutrality policy during the war, so Gardel probably chose Uruguayan citizenship on that basis.<ref name=Collier72>Collier 1986, p. 72.</ref>\n\nIn 1967, writer Erasmo Silva Cabrera started the modern dispute over Gardel's birthplace when he published arguments describing Gardel as having been born in Tacuaremb\u00f3, Uruguay.<ref name=Ruffinelli2004/><ref>{{cite book |title=Carlos Gardel: el gran desconocido |first=Erasmo |last=Silva Cabrera |publisher=Ediciones Ciudadela |year=1967}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Carlos Gardel |authorlink=:es:Blas Matamoro |first=Blas |last=Matamoro |publisher=Centro Editor de Am\u00e9rica Latina |year=1971 |pages=20\u201321}}</ref> Nelson Bayardo wrote a similar book in 1988.<ref name=Ruffinelli2004/><ref>{{cite book |title=Vida y milagros de Carlos Gardel |first=Nelson |last=Bayardo |publisher=Ediciones La Rep\u00fablica |year=1988}}</ref> In 1990, Eduardo Payss\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez published a book containing many biographical details supporting a birthplace of Tacuaremb\u00f3.<ref name=Ruffinelli2004/> The story is that Gardel was born in 1887 the son of influential Uruguayan landowner Carlos Escayola and Escayola's sister-in-law, 13-year-old Maria Lelia Oliva.

Another common Argentine phrase is ''soy/sos Gardel y Le Pera'' (''I'm/You are Gardel and Le Pera'') referring to the greatness of both; used when somebody excels at something.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn the neighborhood of Abasto, Buenos Aires, the Carlos Gardel Museum opened in 2003, in a house that Gardel bought for his mother in 1927, and where he also lived from 1927 to 1933.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://turismo.buenosaires.gob.ar/en/otros-establecimientos/museo-casa-carlos-gardel|title=Museo Casa Carlos Gardel|website=Official English Website for the City of Buenos Aires|access-date=2017-04-24}}</ref> Another Carlos Gardel Museum opened in 1999 in Valle Ed\u00e9n, an old farm site {{convert|23|km|abbr=on}} south of Tacuaremb\u00f3, Uruguay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.uruguay.com/uruguay_detail_675_carlos_gardel_museum.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171246/http://english.uruguay.com/uruguay_detail_675_carlos_gardel_museum.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 March 2016 |title=Carlos Gardel Museum |publisher=Uruguay.com |accessdate=31 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Uruguay produced a Gardel stamp calling him the \"immortal Tacuaremboan\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Feuding Uruguay, Argentina unite to preserve tango |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/latino/feuding-uruguay-argentina-unite-preserve-tango-article-1.412560?pgno=1 |page=2 |date=11 May 2009 |work=New York Daily News |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=31 August 2012}}</ref> On March 16, 2011, the United States Postal Service issued a set of five \"Latin Music Legends\" stamps including one picturing Carlos Gardel.<ref>USPS Postal News Release No. 11-024 (March 16, 2011)</ref>\n\n===In literature===\n[[Ant\u00f3nio Lobo Antunes]] wrote a novel entitled ''The Death of Carlos Gardel'', in which one of the characters believes that Gardel did not die in the plane crash in 1935.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nGardel appears as a fictionalized character in the play ''El d\u00eda que me quieras'' (1979) by the Venezuelan writer [[Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Cabrujas]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===In film===\nIn the 1939 biopic ''[[The Life of Carlos Gardel]]'', he is portrayed by [[Hugo del Carril]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n''[[Doble o Nada]]'' starring Dario Grandinetti and Aitana S\u00e1nchez-Gij\u00f3n was released by Maverick in April 2003.

Gardel's [[baritone]] voice and the dramatic phrasing of his lyrics made miniature masterpieces of his hundreds of three-minute tango recordings. Together with lyricist and long-time collaborator [[Alfredo Le Pera]], Gardel wrote several classic tangos.\n\nGardel died in an airplane crash at the height of his career, becoming an archetypal tragic hero mourned throughout Latin America. For many, Gardel embodies the soul of the tango style. He is commonly referred to as \"Carlitos\", \"El Zorzal\" (The [Song] Thrush), \"The King of Tango\", \"El Mago\" (The Wizard), \"El Morocho del Abasto\" (The Brunette boy from Abasto), and ironically \"El Mudo\" (The Mute).\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:Gardel-Silva-1923.jpg|thumb|right|Gardel in [[gaucho]] clothes, 1923]]\nGardel was born to unmarried 25-year-old laundress Berthe Gard\u00e8s, the baby registered under the name Charles Romuald Gard\u00e8s in [[Toulouse]], [[France]], on 11 December 1890.<ref name=UNESCO1986/> The father of the baby boy was listed on his birth certificate as \"unknown\", but 11 days later Berthe Gard\u00e8s signed a statement establishing the baby's father as Paul Laserre, a married man who left Toulouse a few months before the baby was born.<ref name=Collier5/> Berthe Gard\u00e8s also left Toulouse, a little over a year later, likely to escape the social stigma of having a child born out of wedlock. In early 1893 in [[Bordeaux]], France, mother and son boarded the ship SS ''Don Pedro'' and sailed to Buenos Aires, arriving on 11 March 1893. Berthe Gard\u00e8s had her passport recorded upon arrival; she told immigration authorities that she was a widow. The two-year-old boy was recorded as Charles Gard\u00e8s.<ref name=Collier5/>\n\nGardel's mother settled at the western edge of the central [[San Nicol\u00e1s, Buenos Aires|San Nicol\u00e1s]] district of [[Buenos Aires]], at Calle Uruguay 162. She worked two blocks away on Calle Montevideo, pressing clothes in the French style, which commanded a relatively high price in the fashion-conscious city.<ref>Collier 1986, p. 6</ref> Gardel grew up speaking Spanish, not French, with friends and family calling him Carlos, the Spanish version of his French name, and often by the familiar diminutive form Carlitos.<ref>Collier 1986, pp. 7\u20138</ref>\n\nSome time after 1918, Laserre traveled from France to Buenos Aires to ask Berthe Gard\u00e8s, now called Do\u00f1a Berta, whether she would like to legitimize her son by marrying Laserre. This would have disrupted her story about being a widow. Gardel told his mother that if she did not need this man in her life, neither did he, closing the matter with \"I don't even wish to see him.\"<ref>Collier 1986, p. 7</ref>\n\n===Career===\nGardel began his singing career in bars and at private parties. He also sang with [[Francisco Martino]] and later in a trio with Martino and [[Jos\u00e9 Razzano]]. Gardel created the ''tango-canci\u00f3n'' in 1917 with his rendition of [[Pascual Contursi]] and [[Samuel Castriota]]'s ''[[Mi noche triste]]''. The recording sold 10,000 copies and was a hit throughout Latin America.<ref>Cunningham, Amy (3 July 2011). [http://www.soundsandcolours.com/articles/argentina/carlos-gardel-the-king-of-tango/ Carlos \"Gardel: The King of Tango\"], ''Sound and Colours''.</ref>\n\nGardel went on tour through Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Brazil, [[Centro Espa\u00f1ol de Ponce|Puerto Rico]], Venezuela and Colombia, as well as making appearances in Paris, New York, Barcelona and Madrid. He sold 70,000 records in the first three months of a 1928 visit to Paris. As his popularity grew, he made a number of films for [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] in France and the U.S. While sentimental films such as ''[[Downward Slope|Cuesta abajo]]'' (1934) and ''[[El d\u00eda que me quieras (1935 film)|El d\u00eda que me quieras]]'' (1935) lack lasting dramatic value, they were outstanding showcases of his tremendous singing talents and movie star looks.\n\n===Romantic life===\nGardel was aware of the fact that much of his popularity was based on his attractiveness to women. In an effort to seem as if he were available to any woman, he sought to keep his love life secret. Gardel had one major girlfriend in his life: Isabel del Valle. He met del Valle in late 1920 when she was fourteen years of age.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://todayintango.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/1907-march-16-birth-of-isabel-del-valle/|title=1907, March 16 \u2013 BIRTH OF ISABEL DEL VALLE|date=2011-03-16|work=TODAY IN TANGO !|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}</ref> At the time, he was performing at the Esmeralda Theater in Buenos Aires.

Around 1930 the relationship began to degrade. Gardel had his lawyer stop making payments to del Valle, who later married another man and moved to Uruguay. She was always respectful of the memory of Gardel, even when interviewed about him in late life for a 1980s television program.<ref>Collier 1986, pp. 121\u201322, 233, 210.</ref>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Procesion Gardel 1936.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The coffin of Gardel moves down Florida Street in Buenos Aires]]\n[[File:La tumba de Carlos Gardel.jpg|thumb|Carlos Gardel's grave at La [[Chacarita Cemetery]]]]\n\nGardel died on 24 June 1935 in an airplane crash in [[Medell\u00edn]], Colombia.

One month later he was issued a new Argentine identity card that listed him as a Uruguayan national. On 7 March 1923 he applied for citizenship in Argentina. On 1 May 1923 he took the oath of Argentine citizenship. Today, there is no absolute certainty regarding why he took these steps. The most likely reason for this act was to avoid problems with French authorities during an upcoming tour of France. As a French citizen by birth, Gardel had been required to register with the French military during the [[World War I|Great War]]. It is likely that Gardel never registered; his name is not found on any lists of registrants. Uruguay maintained a neutrality policy during the war, so Gardel probably chose Uruguayan citizenship on that basis.<ref name=Collier72>Collier 1986, p. 72.</ref>\n\nIn 1967, writer Erasmo Silva Cabrera started the modern dispute over Gardel's birthplace when he published arguments describing Gardel as having been born in Tacuaremb\u00f3, Uruguay.<ref name=Ruffinelli2004/><ref>{{cite book |title=Carlos Gardel: el gran desconocido |first=Erasmo |last=Silva Cabrera |publisher=Ediciones Ciudadela |year=1967}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Carlos Gardel |authorlink=:es:Blas Matamoro |first=Blas |last=Matamoro |publisher=Centro Editor de Am\u00e9rica Latina |year=1971 |pages=20\u201321}}</ref> Nelson Bayardo wrote a similar book in 1988.<ref name=Ruffinelli2004/><ref>{{cite book |title=Vida y milagros de Carlos Gardel |first=Nelson |last=Bayardo |publisher=Ediciones La Rep\u00fablica |year=1988}}</ref> In 1990, Eduardo Payss\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez published a book containing many biographical details supporting a birthplace of Tacuaremb\u00f3.<ref name=Ruffinelli2004/> The story is that Gardel was born in 1887 the son of influential Uruguayan landowner Carlos Escayola and Escayola's sister-in-law, 13-year-old Maria Lelia Oliva.

Another common Argentine phrase is ''soy/sos Gardel y Le Pera'' (''I'm/You are Gardel and Le Pera'') referring to the greatness of both; used when somebody excels at something.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn the neighborhood of Abasto, Buenos Aires, the Carlos Gardel Museum opened in 2003, in a house that Gardel bought for his mother in 1927, and where he also lived from 1927 to 1933.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://turismo.buenosaires.gob.ar/en/otros-establecimientos/museo-casa-carlos-gardel|title=Museo Casa Carlos Gardel|website=Official English Website for the City of Buenos Aires|access-date=2017-04-24}}</ref> Another Carlos Gardel Museum opened in 1999 in Valle Ed\u00e9n, an old farm site {{convert|23|km|abbr=on}} south of Tacuaremb\u00f3, Uruguay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.uruguay.com/uruguay_detail_675_carlos_gardel_museum.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171246/http://english.uruguay.com/uruguay_detail_675_carlos_gardel_museum.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 March 2016 |title=Carlos Gardel Museum |publisher=Uruguay.com |accessdate=31 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Uruguay produced a Gardel stamp calling him the \"immortal Tacuaremboan\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Feuding Uruguay, Argentina unite to preserve tango |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/latino/feuding-uruguay-argentina-unite-preserve-tango-article-1.412560?pgno=1 |page=2 |date=11 May 2009 |work=New York Daily News |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=31 August 2012}}</ref> On March 16, 2011, the United States Postal Service issued a set of five \"Latin Music Legends\" stamps including one picturing Carlos Gardel.<ref>USPS Postal News Release No. 11-024 (March 16, 2011)</ref>\n\n===In literature===\n[[Ant\u00f3nio Lobo Antunes]] wrote a novel entitled ''The Death of Carlos Gardel'', in which one of the characters believes that Gardel did not die in the plane crash in 1935.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nGardel appears as a fictionalized character in the play ''El d\u00eda que me quieras'' (1979) by the Venezuelan writer [[Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Cabrujas]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===In film===\nIn the 1939 biopic ''[[The Life of Carlos Gardel]]'', he is portrayed by [[Hugo del Carril]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n''[[Doble o Nada]]'' starring Dario Grandinetti and Aitana S\u00e1nchez-Gij\u00f3n was released by Maverick in April 2003.

This compulsion hardly belongs to the man who enunciates them; it belongs to universal reason and to all men who wish to listen to its voice. It belongs to my colleagues of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|Constituent Assembly]], to the patriots of the Legislative Assembly, to all citizens who will invariably defend the cause of liberty. Experience has proven, despite Louis XVI and his allies, that the opinion of the Jacobins and the popular clubs were those of the French Nation; no citizen has made them, and I did nothing other than share in them.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=83\u201384|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}} }}\n\nTurning the accusations upon his accusers, Robespierre delivered one of the most famous lines of the French Revolution to the Assembly:\n\n{{quote|I will not remind you that the sole object of contention dividing us is that you have instinctively defended all acts of new ministers, and we, of principles; that you seemed to prefer power, and we equality...

Most Montagnards favoured judgment and execution, while the Girondins were more divided concerning how to proceed, with some arguing for royal inviolability, others for clemency, and others advocating lesser punishment or banishment.{{sfn|Kennedy|1988|pp=308\u201310}} On 13 November Robespierre stated in the Convention that a Constitution which Louis had violated himself, and which declared his inviolability, could not now be used in his defence.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|loc= in Tome IX, Discours|pp=104\u201305, [https://fr.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Page:\u0152uvres_compl\u00e8tes_de_Maximilien_de_Robespierre,_tome_9.djvu/122 120].}} Robespierre had been taken ill and had done little other than support [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]], who gave his first major speech to address and argue against the king's inviolability.

Robespierre argued that the dethroned king could now function only as a threat to liberty and national peace and that the members of the Assembly were not to be impartial judges but rather statesmen with responsibility for ensuring public safety:\n\n{{quote|Louis was a king, and our republic is established; the critical question concerning you must be decided by these words alone. Louis was dethroned by his crimes; Louis denounced the French people as rebels; he appealed to chains, to the armies of tyrants who are his brothers; the victory of the people established that Louis alone was a rebel; Louis cannot, therefore, be judged; he already is judged. He is condemned, or the republic cannot be absolved. To propose to have a trial of Louis XVI, in whatever manner one may, is to retrogress to royal despotism and constitutionality; it is a counter-revolutionary idea because it places the revolution itself in litigation. In effect, if Louis may still be given a trial, he may be absolved, and innocent. What am I to say? He is presumed to be so until he is judged. But if Louis is absolved, if he may be presumed innocent, what becomes of the revolution? If Louis is innocent, all the defenders of liberty become slanderers. <!--Our enemies have been friends of the people and of truth and defenders of innocence oppressed; all the declarations of foreign courts are nothing more than the legitimate claims against an illegal faction. Even the detention that Louis has endured is, then, an unjust vexation; the f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s, the people of Paris, all the patriots of the French Empire are guilty; and this great trial in the court of nature judging between crime and virtue, liberty and tyranny, is at last decided in favour of crime and tyranny. Citizens, take warning; you are being fooled by false notions; you confuse positive, civil rights with the principles of the rights of mankind; you confuse the relationships of citizens amongst themselves with the connections between nations and an enemy that conspires against it; you confuse the situation of a people in revolution with that of a people whose government is affirmed; you confuse a nation that punishes a public functionary to conserve its form of government, and one that destroys the government itself. We are falling back upon ideas familiar to us, in an extraordinary case that depends upon principles we have never yet applied.-->{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=121\u201322|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nIn arguing for a judgment by the elected Convention without trial, Robespierre supported the recommendations of [[Jean-Baptiste Mailhe]], who headed the commission reporting on legal aspects of Louis's trial or judgment. Unlike some Girondins, Robespierre specifically opposed judgment by primary assemblies or a referendum, believing that this could cause a civil war.{{sfn|Soboul|2005|p=867|loc= in \"Proc\u00e8s du Roi\" by Dorigny, M}} While he called for a trial of Queen Marie-Antoinette and the imprisonment of the Dauphin, Robespierre advocated that the king be executed despite his opposition to capital punishment:\n\n{{quote|<!--As for myself, I abhor the death penalty administered by your laws, and for Louis I have neither love, nor hate; I hate only his crimes. I have demanded the abolition of the death penalty at your Constituent Assembly, and am not to blame if the first principles of reason appeared to you moral and political heresies. But if you will never reclaim these principles in favour of so much evil, the crimes of which belong less to you and more to the government, by what fatal error would you remember yourselves and plead for the greatest of criminals? You ask an exception to the death penalty for him alone who could legitimise it? -->Yes, the death penalty is, in general, crime, unjustifiable by the indestructible principles of nature, except in cases protecting the safety of individuals or the society altogether. Ordinary misdemeanours have never threatened public safety because society may always protect itself by other means, making those culpable powerless to harm it. But for a king dethroned in the bosom of a revolution, which is as yet cemented only by laws; a king whose name attracts the scourge of war upon a troubled nation; neither prison nor exile can render his existence inconsequential to public happiness; this cruel exception to the ordinary laws avowed by justice can be imputed only to the nature of his crimes. With regret, I pronounce this fatal truth: Louis must die so that the nation may live.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=129\u201330|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nOn 4 December the Convention decreed all the royalist writings illegal.<ref>William J.

Accordingly, on 7 May, Robespierre delivered a long presentation to the Convention \u2018on the relation of religious and moral ideas to republican principles, and on national festivals\u2019.<ref name=\"auto11\"/> Robespierre supported a decree that the Convention passed to establish an official state religion called the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]]. The notion of the Supreme Being was based on the creed of the Savoy chaplain that Jean-Jacques Rousseau had outlined in Book IV of ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]]''.\n\nIn the afternoon of 8 June (also the Christian holiday of [[Pentecost]]) a \"Festival of the Supreme Being\" was held. Everything was arranged to the exact specifications that had been drawn up previously set before the ceremony. The ominous and symbolic guillotine had been moved to the original standing place of the [[Bastille]]. Pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers with their babies were specifically invited to walk in the procession which started at the [[Tuileries]].{{sfn | Moore | 2007 | p=291}} ([[Joachim Vilate]] had invited Robespierre to have lunch in the Pavillon de Flore, but he ate little.)\n\nThe festival was also Robespierre's first appearance in the public eye as a leader for the people, and also as president of the Convention, to which he had been elected only four days earlier.{{sfn|Andress|2006|p=308}} Witnesses state that throughout the \"Festival of the Supreme Being\", Robespierre beamed with joy. He was able to speak of the things about which he was truly passionate, including virtue, nature, deist beliefs and his disagreements with atheism. He dressed elaborately, wearing feathers on his hat and holding fruit and flowers in his hands, and walked first in the festival procession. According to Michelet: \"Robespierre, as usual, walked quickly, with an agitated air. The Convention did not move nearly so fast. The leaders, perhaps maliciously and out of perfidious deference, remained well behind him, thereby isolating him.\"<ref>Michelet, J.

Robespierre delivered two speeches in which he emphasized his concept of a Supreme Being:\n\n<blockquote>Is it not He whose immortal hand, engraving on the heart of man the code of justice and equality, has written there the death sentence of tyrants? Is it not He who, from the beginning of time, decreed for all the ages and for all peoples liberty, good faith, and justice? He did not create kings to devour the human race. He did not create priests to harness us, like vile animals, to the chariots of kings and to give to the world examples of baseness, pride, perfidy, avarice, debauchery and falsehood. He created the universe to proclaim His power. He created men to help each other, to love each other mutually, and to attain to happiness by the way of virtue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/robespierre-supreme.asp|title=Robespierre, M. \"The Cult of the Supreme Being\", in Modern History Sourcebook, 1997|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nRobespierre came down the mountain in a way that resembled [[Moses]] as the leader of the people.

His goal in the Terror was to use the guillotine to create what he called a \"republic of virtue\", wherein virtue would be combined with terror.<ref name=\"chnm.gmu.edu\"/> <blockquote>Robespierre's main ideal was to ensure the virtue and sovereignty of the people. He disapproved of any acts which could be seen as exposing the nation to counter-revolutionaries and traitors and became increasingly fearful of the defeat of the Revolution. He instigated the Terror and the deaths of his peers as a measure of ensuring the Republic of Virtue but his ideals went beyond the needs and wants of the people of France. He became a threat to what he had wanted to ensure and the result was his downfall.{{sfn|Scurr|2006}}</blockquote>\n\nSoboul argues that Robespierre and Saint-Just \"were too preoccupied in defeating the interest of the bourgeoisie to give their total support to the sans-culottes, and yet too attentive to the needs of the sans-culottes to get support from the middle class.\"{{sfn|Ishay|1995|p=65}} According to [[R.R.

At the liberation, the municipal council (elected on 29 April 1945 with 27 communists, 12 socialists and 4 radicals out of 48 members), decided on 13 April 1946, to rename the Place du March\u00e9-Saint-Honor\u00e9  \u2018Place Robespierre\u2019, a decision approved at prefectorial level on 8 June. However in the wake of political changes in 1947, it reverted to its original name on 6 November 1950. Streets in the so-called \u2018Red belt\u2019 bear his name, e.g. at [[Montreuil]]. There is also a [[Robespierre (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Metro station \u2018Robespierre\u2019]] on Line 9 (Mairie de Montreuil - Pont de S\u00e8vres), in the commune of Montreuil, named during the era of the [[Popular Front (France)|\nPopular Front]].\nThere are, however, numerous streets, roads and squares named for him elsewhere in France.<ref>See https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilien_de_Robespierre#Voies_publiques</ref>\n\n==== Plaques and monuments ====\n===== Arras =====\n\n* On 14 Octobre 1923, a plaque was placed on the house at 9 Rue Maximilien Robespierre (formerly Rue des Rapporteurs) rented by the three Robespierre siblings in 1787-1789, in the presence of the mayor Gustave Lemelle, Albert Mathiez and Louis Jacob, president of the [[Rosati]]. Built in 1730, the house has had a varied history as a typing school, and a craftsmen\u2019s museum, but is now being developed as a Robespierre Museum.  \n* In 1994, a plaque was unveiled by ARBR on the fa\u00e7ade of the Carrauts\u2019 brewery on the Rue Ronville, where Maximilien and Augustin were brought up by their grandparents.\n* An [[Art Deco]] marble bust by Maurice Cladel was intended to be displayed in the gardens of the former [[Abbey of Saint-Vaast]]. A mixture of politics and concerns about weathering led to it being placed in the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Arras|H\u00f4tel de Ville]]. After many years in a tribunal room, it can now be seen in the Salle Robespierre. Bronze casts of the bust were made for the bicentenary and are displayed in his former home on Rue Maximilien Robespierre and at the Lyc\u00e9e Robespierre, unveiled in 1990.\n\n===== Paris and elsewhere =====\n* Robespierre is commemorated by two plaques in Paris, one on the exterior of the Duplays\u2019 house, now 398 [[rue Saint-Honor\u00e9]], the other, erected by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes robespierristes in the [[Conciergerie]].\n* In 1909, a committee presided over by [[Ren\u00e9 Viviani]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]] proposed erecting a statue in the garden of the [[Tuileries]], but press hostility and failure to garner enough public subscriptions led to its abandonment.

This compulsion hardly belongs to the man who enunciates them; it belongs to universal reason and to all men who wish to listen to its voice. It belongs to my colleagues of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|Constituent Assembly]], to the patriots of the Legislative Assembly, to all citizens who will invariably defend the cause of liberty. Experience has proven, despite Louis XVI and his allies, that the opinion of the Jacobins and the popular clubs were those of the French Nation; no citizen has made them, and I did nothing other than share in them.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=83\u201384|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}} }}\n\nTurning the accusations upon his accusers, Robespierre delivered one of the most famous lines of the French Revolution to the Assembly:\n\n{{quote|I will not remind you that the sole object of contention dividing us is that you have instinctively defended all acts of new ministers, and we, of principles; that you seemed to prefer power, and we equality...

Most Montagnards favoured judgment and execution, while the Girondins were more divided concerning how to proceed, with some arguing for royal inviolability, others for clemency, and others advocating lesser punishment or banishment.{{sfn|Kennedy|1988|pp=308\u201310}} On 13 November Robespierre stated in the Convention that a Constitution which Louis had violated himself, and which declared his inviolability, could not now be used in his defence.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|loc= in Tome IX, Discours|pp=104\u201305, [https://fr.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Page:\u0152uvres_compl\u00e8tes_de_Maximilien_de_Robespierre,_tome_9.djvu/122 120].}} Robespierre had been taken ill and had done little other than support [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]], who gave his first major speech to address and argue against the king's inviolability.

Robespierre argued that the dethroned king could now function only as a threat to liberty and national peace and that the members of the Assembly were not to be impartial judges but rather statesmen with responsibility for ensuring public safety:\n\n{{quote|Louis was a king, and our republic is established; the critical question concerning you must be decided by these words alone. Louis was dethroned by his crimes; Louis denounced the French people as rebels; he appealed to chains, to the armies of tyrants who are his brothers; the victory of the people established that Louis alone was a rebel; Louis cannot, therefore, be judged; he already is judged. He is condemned, or the republic cannot be absolved. To propose to have a trial of Louis XVI, in whatever manner one may, is to retrogress to royal despotism and constitutionality; it is a counter-revolutionary idea because it places the revolution itself in litigation. In effect, if Louis may still be given a trial, he may be absolved, and innocent. What am I to say? He is presumed to be so until he is judged. But if Louis is absolved, if he may be presumed innocent, what becomes of the revolution? If Louis is innocent, all the defenders of liberty become slanderers. <!--Our enemies have been friends of the people and of truth and defenders of innocence oppressed; all the declarations of foreign courts are nothing more than the legitimate claims against an illegal faction. Even the detention that Louis has endured is, then, an unjust vexation; the f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s, the people of Paris, all the patriots of the French Empire are guilty; and this great trial in the court of nature judging between crime and virtue, liberty and tyranny, is at last decided in favour of crime and tyranny. Citizens, take warning; you are being fooled by false notions; you confuse positive, civil rights with the principles of the rights of mankind; you confuse the relationships of citizens amongst themselves with the connections between nations and an enemy that conspires against it; you confuse the situation of a people in revolution with that of a people whose government is affirmed; you confuse a nation that punishes a public functionary to conserve its form of government, and one that destroys the government itself. We are falling back upon ideas familiar to us, in an extraordinary case that depends upon principles we have never yet applied.-->{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=121\u201322|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nIn arguing for a judgment by the elected Convention without trial, Robespierre supported the recommendations of [[Jean-Baptiste Mailhe]], who headed the commission reporting on legal aspects of Louis's trial or judgment. Unlike some Girondins, Robespierre specifically opposed judgment by primary assemblies or a referendum, believing that this could cause a civil war.{{sfn|Soboul|2005|p=867|loc= in \"Proc\u00e8s du Roi\" by Dorigny, M}} While he called for a trial of Queen Marie-Antoinette and the imprisonment of the Dauphin, Robespierre advocated that the king be executed despite his opposition to capital punishment:\n\n{{quote|<!--As for myself, I abhor the death penalty administered by your laws, and for Louis I have neither love, nor hate; I hate only his crimes. I have demanded the abolition of the death penalty at your Constituent Assembly, and am not to blame if the first principles of reason appeared to you moral and political heresies. But if you will never reclaim these principles in favour of so much evil, the crimes of which belong less to you and more to the government, by what fatal error would you remember yourselves and plead for the greatest of criminals? You ask an exception to the death penalty for him alone who could legitimise it? -->Yes, the death penalty is, in general, crime, unjustifiable by the indestructible principles of nature, except in cases protecting the safety of individuals or the society altogether. Ordinary misdemeanours have never threatened public safety because society may always protect itself by other means, making those culpable powerless to harm it. But for a king dethroned in the bosom of a revolution, which is as yet cemented only by laws; a king whose name attracts the scourge of war upon a troubled nation; neither prison nor exile can render his existence inconsequential to public happiness; this cruel exception to the ordinary laws avowed by justice can be imputed only to the nature of his crimes.

He also opposed the Catholic Church and the pope, particularly their policy of clerical celibacy.{{sfn|Scott|1974|p=107}} Having denounced the [[Cult of Reason]] and other perceived excesses of [[Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution|dechristianization]] undertaken by political opponents in France, he sought to instil a spiritual resurgence across the nation predicated on [[Deist]] beliefs. On 6 May 1794 Robespierre announced to the Convention that in the name of the French people, the Committee of Public Safety had decided to recognize the [[existence of God]] and the [[immortality]] of the human soul. Accordingly, on 7 May, Robespierre delivered a long presentation to the Convention \u2018on the relation of religious and moral ideas to republican principles, and on national festivals\u2019.<ref name=\"auto11\"/> Robespierre supported a decree that the Convention passed to establish an official state religion called the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]]. The notion of the Supreme Being was based on the creed of the Savoy chaplain that Jean-Jacques Rousseau had outlined in Book IV of ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]]''.\n\nIn the afternoon of 8 June (also the Christian holiday of [[Pentecost]]) a \"Festival of the Supreme Being\" was held. Everything was arranged to the exact specifications that had been drawn up previously set before the ceremony. The ominous and symbolic guillotine had been moved to the original standing place of the [[Bastille]]. Pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers with their babies were specifically invited to walk in the procession which started at the [[Tuileries]].{{sfn | Moore | 2007 | p=291}} ([[Joachim Vilate]] had invited Robespierre to have lunch in the Pavillon de Flore, but he ate little.)\n\nThe festival was also Robespierre's first appearance in the public eye as a leader for the people, and also as president of the Convention, to which he had been elected only four days earlier.{{sfn|Andress|2006|p=308}} Witnesses state that throughout the \"Festival of the Supreme Being\", Robespierre beamed with joy. He was able to speak of the things about which he was truly passionate, including virtue, nature, deist beliefs and his disagreements with atheism. He dressed elaborately, wearing feathers on his hat and holding fruit and flowers in his hands, and walked first in the festival procession. According to Michelet: \"Robespierre, as usual, walked quickly, with an agitated air. The Convention did not move nearly so fast. The leaders, perhaps maliciously and out of perfidious deference, remained well behind him, thereby isolating him.\"<ref>Michelet, J. ''The History of the French Revolution'' (Charles Cocks, trans., 1847 [https://archive.org/details/historyfrenchre00michgoog online].</ref> The procession ended on the [[Champ de Mars]].

Robespierre delivered two speeches in which he emphasized his concept of a Supreme Being:\n\n<blockquote>Is it not He whose immortal hand, engraving on the heart of man the code of justice and equality, has written there the death sentence of tyrants? Is it not He who, from the beginning of time, decreed for all the ages and for all peoples liberty, good faith, and justice? He did not create kings to devour the human race. He did not create priests to harness us, like vile animals, to the chariots of kings and to give to the world examples of baseness, pride, perfidy, avarice, debauchery and falsehood. He created the universe to proclaim His power. He created men to help each other, to love each other mutually, and to attain to happiness by the way of virtue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/robespierre-supreme.asp|title=Robespierre, M. \"The Cult of the Supreme Being\", in Modern History Sourcebook, 1997|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nRobespierre came down the mountain in a way that resembled [[Moses]] as the leader of the people.

His goal in the Terror was to use the guillotine to create what he called a \"republic of virtue\", wherein virtue would be combined with terror.<ref name=\"chnm.gmu.edu\"/> <blockquote>Robespierre's main ideal was to ensure the virtue and sovereignty of the people. He disapproved of any acts which could be seen as exposing the nation to counter-revolutionaries and traitors and became increasingly fearful of the defeat of the Revolution. He instigated the Terror and the deaths of his peers as a measure of ensuring the Republic of Virtue but his ideals went beyond the needs and wants of the people of France. He became a threat to what he had wanted to ensure and the result was his downfall.{{sfn|Scurr|2006}}</blockquote>\n\nSoboul argues that Robespierre and Saint-Just \"were too preoccupied in defeating the interest of the bourgeoisie to give their total support to the sans-culottes, and yet too attentive to the needs of the sans-culottes to get support from the middle class.\"{{sfn|Ishay|1995|p=65}} According to [[R.R.

At the liberation, the municipal council (elected on 29 April 1945 with 27 communists, 12 socialists and 4 radicals out of 48 members), decided on 13 April 1946, to rename the Place du March\u00e9-Saint-Honor\u00e9  \u2018Place Robespierre\u2019, a decision approved at prefectorial level on 8 June. However in the wake of political changes in 1947, it reverted to its original name on 6 November 1950. Streets in the so-called \u2018Red belt\u2019 bear his name, e.g. at [[Montreuil]]. There is also a [[Robespierre (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Metro station \u2018Robespierre\u2019]] on Line 9 (Mairie de Montreuil - Pont de S\u00e8vres), in the commune of Montreuil, named during the era of the [[Popular Front (France)|\nPopular Front]].\nThere are, however, numerous streets, roads and squares named for him elsewhere in France.<ref>See https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilien_de_Robespierre#Voies_publiques</ref>\n\n==== Plaques and monuments ====\n===== Arras =====\n\n* On 14 Octobre 1923, a plaque was placed on the house at 9 Rue Maximilien Robespierre (formerly Rue des Rapporteurs) rented by the three Robespierre siblings in 1787-1789, in the presence of the mayor Gustave Lemelle, Albert Mathiez and Louis Jacob, president of the [[Rosati]]. Built in 1730, the house has had a varied history as a typing school, and a craftsmen\u2019s museum, but is now being developed as a Robespierre Museum.  \n* In 1994, a plaque was unveiled by ARBR on the fa\u00e7ade of the Carrauts\u2019 brewery on the Rue Ronville, where Maximilien and Augustin were brought up by their grandparents.\n* An [[Art Deco]] marble bust by Maurice Cladel was intended to be displayed in the gardens of the former [[Abbey of Saint-Vaast]]. A mixture of politics and concerns about weathering led to it being placed in the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Arras|H\u00f4tel de Ville]]. After many years in a tribunal room, it can now be seen in the Salle Robespierre. Bronze casts of the bust were made for the bicentenary and are displayed in his former home on Rue Maximilien Robespierre and at the Lyc\u00e9e Robespierre, unveiled in 1990.\n\n===== Paris and elsewhere =====\n* Robespierre is commemorated by two plaques in Paris, one on the exterior of the Duplays\u2019 house, now 398 [[rue Saint-Honor\u00e9]], the other, erected by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes robespierristes in the [[Conciergerie]].\n* In 1909, a committee presided over by [[Ren\u00e9 Viviani]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]] proposed erecting a statue in the garden of the [[Tuileries]], but press hostility and failure to garner enough public subscriptions led to its abandonment. However, Robespierre is recognisable in [[Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9on Sicard]]\u2019s marble Altar of the [[National Convention]] (1913), originally intended for the gardens of the Tuileries and now in the [[Panth\u00e9on]]. \n* A stone bust by Albert S\u00e9raphin (1949) stands in the square Robespierre, opposite the theatre in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], with the inscription: \u201cMaximilien Robespierre l'Incorruptible 1758-1794\u201d.<ref>See Ren\u00e9 & Peter van der Krogt, ''Statues \u2013 Hither & Thither'' for photographs: https://statues.vanderkrogt.net/object.php?webpage=ST&record=frif030</ref>\n* Charles Correia\u2019s 1980s bronze sculptural group at the Coll\u00e8ge Robespierre in [[\u00c9pinay-sur-Seine]] depicts him and [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just]] at a table, working on the 1793 Constitution and Declaration of Human Rights.<ref>See ''Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine''for photographs by Agn\u00e8s Paty: https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028036</ref>  A mural in the school also depicts him.<ref>See D\u00e9partement Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis ''Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine'': https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028019</ref>\n* In 1986, [[Claude-Andr\u00e9 Deseine]]\u2019s terracotta bust of 1791 was bought for the new [[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]] at [[Vizille]].
