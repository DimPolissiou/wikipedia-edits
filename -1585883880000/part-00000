The game was released for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Microsoft Windows]] in October 2019, with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version to be released in June 2020. The game received generally favorable reviews from critics.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:The Outer Worlds pre-release gameplay screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|256px|Pre-release gameplay screenshot of ''The Outer Worlds''.]]\n\n''The Outer Worlds'' is an [[action role-playing video game]] featuring a [[first-person perspective]]. In the early stages of the game, the player can create their own character and unlock a ship, which acts as the game's central hub space. Though the player cannot control their ship directly, it serves as a [[fast travel]] point to access different areas in the game and acts as the player's persistent inventory space.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.shacknews.com/article/108855/the-outer-worlds-preview-flaws-in-the-system|title=The Outer Worlds preview: Flaws in the system|first=Ozzie|last=Meija|work=[[Shacknews]]|date=December 7, 2018|accessdate=December 7, 2018}}</ref> The player can encounter and recruit [[non-player character]]s as companions who have their own personal missions and stories. When accompanying the player, the companions act as an aid in combat. Each companion has its own individual skills and special attacks, and it can also develop its own skill specialization. When exploring, the player can bring up to two companions alongside them, while the rest stay on the ship. The player can make numerous [[dialogue tree|dialogue decision]]s, which can influence the game's branching story. They can also respond to NPCs in various ways, such as acting heroically, maniacally, or moronically.<ref name=\"IGNPrev\"/>\n\nDuring combat situations, the player can use various weapon types such as melee and firearms, which have three ammo types: light, heavy and energy. These weapons can be customized to add elemental damage.<ref name=\"PCGPre\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/obsidians-the-outer-worlds-blends-firefly-and-fallout-into-a-bold-open-ended-sci-fi-rpg/|title=Obsidian's The Outer Worlds blends Firefly and Fallout into a bold, open-ended sci-fi RPG|first=Wes|last=Fenlon|date=December 7, 2018|accessdate=December 7, 2018|work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref> The player can use stealth or social skills (persuasion, lying and intimidation) to avoid combat altogether. As the player progresses, they gain [[experience point]]s, which the player and their companions can use to level up and unlock new skills. The player can develop their technical skills, which are further divided into three categories: Science, Medical, and Engineering. For instance, the player can use a shrink ray to shrink down an enemy. The player is able to invest points into these skills, which will unlock new perks that enhance combat efficiency. The player can also enter a \"Tactical Time Dilation\" state, which slows down time and reveals opponents' [[health]] statistics, which grants the player tactical advantages. As the player leads their companions, they improve their companions' combat strength and resilience.<ref name=\"IGNPrev\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/07/the-outer-worlds-is-bringing-fun-back-to-science-fiction|title=The Outer Worlds Is Bringing Fun Back To Science Fiction|first=Brandin|last=Tyrrel|work=[[IGN]]|date=December 7, 2018|accessdate=December 7, 2018}}</ref> The player can also gain a \"flaw\" that occurs when the player fails repeatedly in certain gameplay segments. Flaws impede the player in some way, but also give additional perks and advantages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-looks-a-lot-like-fallout-but-that/1100-6463757/|title=The Outer Worlds Looks A Lot Like Fallout, But That's Only Half The Story|first=Peter|last=Brown|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=December 7, 2018|accessdate=December 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\n=== Setting ===\nThe game is set in an alternate future that diverged in 1901, when U.S. President [[William McKinley]] is not assassinated by [[Leon Czolgosz]] at the [[Pan-American Exposition]]. As a result, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] never succeeded him, and large business trusts were never broken up, leading to a hyper-corporate, class-centric society dominated by the power of [[megacorporation]]s, which by the distant future have begun to colonize space and terraforming alien planets, to varying results.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-new-vegas-devs-share-lore-detail-about-the/1100-6465339/|title=Fallout: New Vegas Devs Share Lore Detail About The Outer Worlds|first=Steve|last=Watts|work=[[Gamespot]] |date=March 8, 2019|accessdate=August 3, 2019}}</ref> Earth residents are encouraged to undertake efforts to colonize these systems.\n\nAmong them is Halcyon, a six-planet star system. Travelling to Halcyon requires both the usage of advanced spacecrafts with a specialist \"skip-drive\", and a 10-year cryosleep for the colonists. In 2285, two colony ships were dispatched to colonise Halcyon - the ''Hope'' and the ''Groundbreaker''. While the ''Groundbreaker'' successfully arrived in Halcyon, colonising the planets Terra 1 (later renamed Monarch) and Terra 2, the ''Hope'' and her cargo mysteriously disappeared in transit, slipping into myth among the citizens of Halcyon. The ''Groundbreaker'' is placed in a permanent orbit near Terra 2, with the original crew's descendants converting her from a colony ship into a small independent citadel.\n\n=== Synopsis ===\nIn 2355, the ''Hope'' is discovered drifting on the outskirts of the Halcyon system by mad scientist Phineas Welles, who manages to safely revive one of the passengers (the \"Stranger\"). Welles informs the Stranger that the Halcyon colony has fallen on hard times due to the mass incompetence of the various mega-corporations (referred to collectively as \"The Board\") that govern every aspect of life in Halcyon. Due to the after-effects of prolonged cryosleep, the Stranger has substantially higher mental and physical abilities than the majority of ordinary Halcyon residents. Welles tasks the Stranger with securing the resources needed to revive the remaining ''Hope'' colonists, who Welles believes hold the key to Halcyon's salvation.\n\nWelles jettison the Stranger in an escape pod onto Terra 2, where a contact, smuggler Alex Hawthorne, is waiting. Unfortunately, the Stranger's pod lands on Hawthorne, killing him instantly. The Stranger commandeers Hawthorne's ship, the ''Unreliable'', which is piloted by an [[artificial intelligence]] named ADA. In search of a power converter for the ''Unreliable'', the Stranger ventures into the nearby frontier town of Edgewater, where the Board-supported cannery town is caught in a cold war with deserters led by Adelaide McDevitt. The Stranger is asked by town mayor Reed Tobson to divert power away from the McDevitt's village back to Edgewater, forcing the deserters to return to Edgewater. However, McDevitt instead suggests diverting power to her clan, shutting down the canneries and freeing the townsfolk from Board oppression.\n\nThe Stranger is joined on this mission by Edgewater's bashful town engineer [[Parvati Holcomb]], and later offers her a place aboard the ''Unreliable''. The Stranger is later also able to recruit further allies to their crew, including wisecracking [[mercenary]] Ellie Fenhill, ship's hand Felix Millstone, Edgewater [[vicar]] Maximillian DeSoto, [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] monster-hunter Nyoka, and a cleaning robot named SAM. As the story progresses, the Stranger learns that Welles is wanted by the Board for acts of alleged terrorism, and can decide whether to side themselves with Welles or the Board in their quest to save Halcyon.\n\nAfter leaving Terra 2, the Stranger heads to Monarch, a colonised moon orbiting the gas giant Olympus, where an information Broker holds the location of a batch of dimethyl sulfoxide, a chemical important to Welles' revival of the ''Hope''<nowiki/>'s colonists. As landing on Monarch is prohibited since the Board disowned the colony there, the Stranger must first retrieve a passkey from aboard the ''Groundbreaker'', which remains independent from the Board. With the passkey, the Stranger lands in the town of Stellar Bay to discover the colony divided into two violent factions - Monarch Stellar Industries (MSI), a corporate group led by Sanjar Nandi who face harsh opposition from the Board for their self-declared ownership of Monarch; and the Iconoclasts, idealistic revolutionaries led by Graham Bryant and Zora Blackwood. After retrieving the intel from the Broker, the Stranger witnesses a Board gunship crash nearby. Both the MSI and the Iconoclasts ask the Stranger to retrieve the gunship's weapons; the Stranger can choose to give the weapons to either side, or negotiate peace between the two factions.\n\nWith the Broker's intel, Welles directs the Stranger to Halcyon's wealthy capital Byzantium, where the Minister of Earth, Aloysius Clarke, has just signed on a shipment of dimethyl sulfoxide. Tracking down Clarke to his townhouse, the Stranger learns that Clarke has been placed under house arrest by Board Chairman Charles Rockwell, the true recipient of the chemicals. In Rockwell's private quarters, the Stranger discovers a video in which Rockwell announces the \"Lifetime Employment Program\"; the Board is conspiring to place the majority of the colonists in indefinite cryosleep, ostensibly in order to save humanity but in actuality to hoard the remaining food supplies for the wealthiest citizens. In order to store these frozen workers, the ''Hope'' colonists will be ejected into space, with the ''Hope'' turned into a vast cryogenic warehouse. The dimethyl sulfoxide is being used on human test subjects to attempt to recreate Welles' formula, in the hope that workers can be repeatedly pulled out of extended periods of suspended animation. The Stranger retrieves the chemicals, with or without killing the test subjects in the process.\n\nWelles suggests using ADA and the ''Unreliable''<nowiki/>'s power to \"skip\" the ''Hope'' into the inner Halcyon system, placing it in orbit near his laboratory above Terra 2 so that he can begin the revival process. Sophia Akande, the Adjutant for the Board, instead proposes that the Stranger skip the ''Hope'' to Tartarus, a planet home to the Board's infamous Labyrinth prison complex, so that the Board can apprehend Welles and begin killing the colonists. The Stranger infiltrates the ''Hope'' and learns of what occurred during the ill-fated voyage; the ''Hope''<nowiki/>'s skip drive developed an unforeseen fault, extending the planned 10-year mission to 60 years. As food rations ran out, some of the crew turned to cannibalising the frozen colonists in order to survive, before staging a mutiny. The captain sealed the ''Hope''<nowiki/>'s cryo-chambers and locked the ship on course for Halcyon, leaving everyone aboard to succumb to starvation. The Stranger also discovers that they were not the first colonist Welles attempted to reanimate; he actually tried at least twelve times prior with fatal results for the colonists involved.\n\nWiring ADA through to the ''Hope''<nowiki/>'s control system, the Stranger skips the ''Hope'' either to Terra 2 or to Tartarus. Depending on where the ''Hope'' arrives in Halcyon, the ending diverges:\n\n* If the Stranger chooses to skip the ''Hope'' themselves rather than ask ADA to do it, and the game has been played with low-intelligence settings, the game ends here. The ''Hope'' will be launched straight into Halcyon's Sun, destroying the ship and killing everyone aboard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gameranx.com/features/id/186162/article/the-outer-worlds-get-this-secret-ending-if-youre-really-dumb-sunburn-guide/|title=The Outer Worlds: Get This Secret Ending If You're Really Dumb {{!}} 'Sunburn' Guide|last=Thielenhaus|first=Kevin|date=2019-11-02|website=Gameranx|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref>\n* If the ''Hope'' was skipped to Terra 2, the Board will apprehend Welles at his base and take him to the Labyrinth on Tartarus. The Stranger and their crew land on Tartarus and fight their way through the prison, learning Welles is being held hostage by either Akande or Rockwell. The Stranger must reach Welles and negotiate with his captor, forcing them to release him either peacefully or by force.\n* If the ''Hope'' was skipped to Tartarus, an enraged Welles will travel to Tartarus himself and start a riot in the Labyrinth, taking Akande hostage in a bid to get to the ''Hope'' and her colonists. The Stranger and their crew land on Tartarus and fight their way through the prison. The Stranger must reach Welles and confront him, forcing him to release Akande either peacefully or by force.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the Stranger is informed that contact with Earth has been lost, and that a Board troopship en route to the home planet mysteriously disappeared in transit. The Stranger is offered leadership of the Halcyon colonies and allowed to shape humanity's future however they see fit. With Halcyon free of Earth's influence the colony is free to shape its own destiny, either under the Board's Life Employment Programme or under the freedom brought by the loss of the Board's influence. The Stranger and their crew go their separate ways as their individual fates are explained, and the story of the ''Unreliable'' slips into legend.\n\n==Development==\nThe game is developed by [[Obsidian Entertainment]] and published by [[Take-Two Interactive]]'s publishing label [[Private Division]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/12/07/obsidian-entertainment-announce-the-outer-wilds/|title=Obsidian Entertainment announce The Outer Worlds|first=Alice|last=O'Connor|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=December 7, 2018|accessdate=December 7, 2018}}</ref> Though Obsidian was in progress to be acquired by [[Microsoft Studios]] at the time of the game's announcement, the project had been under development before that point, and Take-Two had secured the publishing rights prior to Microsoft's acquisition offer.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/7/18130594/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-microsoft | title = The Outer Worlds isn\u2019t a Microsoft game, even though it\u2019s buying Obsidian | first = Charlie | last = Hall | date = December 7, 2018 | accessdate = December 7, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>\n\n[[Tim Cain]] and [[Leonard Boyarsky]], the creators of the ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' series, served as the game's directors.

The game was released for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Microsoft Windows]] in October 2019, with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version to be released in June 2020. The game received generally favorable reviews from critics.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:The Outer Worlds pre-release gameplay screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|256px|Pre-release gameplay screenshot of ''The Outer Worlds''.]]\n\n''The Outer Worlds'' is an [[action role-playing video game]] featuring a [[first-person perspective]]. In the early stages of the game, the player can create their own character and unlock a ship, which acts as the game's central hub space. Though the player cannot control their ship directly, it serves as a [[fast travel]] point to access different areas in the game and acts as the player's persistent inventory space.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.shacknews.com/article/108855/the-outer-worlds-preview-flaws-in-the-system|title=The Outer Worlds preview: Flaws in the system|first=Ozzie|last=Meija|work=[[Shacknews]]|date=December 7, 2018|accessdate=December 7, 2018}}</ref> The player can encounter and recruit [[non-player character]]s as companions who have their own personal missions and stories. When accompanying the player, the companions act as an aid in combat. Each companion has its own individual skills and special attacks, and it can also develop its own skill specialization. When exploring, the player can bring up to two companions alongside them, while the rest stay on the ship. The player can make numerous [[dialogue tree|dialogue decision]]s, which can influence the game's branching story. They can also respond to NPCs in various ways, such as acting heroically, maniacally, or moronically.<ref name=\"IGNPrev\"/>\n\nDuring combat situations, the player can use various weapon types such as melee and firearms, which have three ammo types: light, heavy and energy. These weapons can be customized to add elemental damage.<ref name=\"PCGPre\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/obsidians-the-outer-worlds-blends-firefly-and-fallout-into-a-bold-open-ended-sci-fi-rpg/|title=Obsidian's The Outer Worlds blends Firefly and Fallout into a bold, open-ended sci-fi RPG|first=Wes|last=Fenlon|date=December 7, 2018|accessdate=December 7, 2018|work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref> The player can use stealth or social skills (persuasion, lying and intimidation) to avoid combat altogether. As the player progresses, they gain [[experience point]]s, which the player and their companions can use to level up and unlock new skills. The player can develop their technical skills, which are further divided into three categories: Science, Medical, and Engineering. For instance, the player can use a shrink ray to shrink down an enemy. The player is able to invest points into these skills, which will unlock new perks that enhance combat efficiency. The player can also enter a \"Tactical Time Dilation\" state, which slows down time and reveals opponents' [[health]] statistics, which grants the player tactical advantages. As the player leads their companions, they improve their companions' combat strength and resilience.<ref name=\"IGNPrev\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/07/the-outer-worlds-is-bringing-fun-back-to-science-fiction|title=The Outer Worlds Is Bringing Fun Back To Science Fiction|first=Brandin|last=Tyrrel|work=[[IGN]]|date=December 7, 2018|accessdate=December 7, 2018}}</ref> The player can also gain a \"flaw\" that occurs when the player fails repeatedly in certain gameplay segments. Flaws impede the player in some way, but also give additional perks and advantages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-looks-a-lot-like-fallout-but-that/1100-6463757/|title=The Outer Worlds Looks A Lot Like Fallout, But That's Only Half The Story|first=Peter|last=Brown|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=December 7, 2018|accessdate=December 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\n=== Setting ===\nThe game is set in an alternate future that diverged in 1901, when U.S. President [[William McKinley]] is not assassinated by [[Leon Czolgosz]] at the [[Pan-American Exposition]]. As a result, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] never succeeded him, and large business trusts were never broken up, leading to a hyper-corporate, class-centric society dominated by the power of [[megacorporation]]s, which by the distant future have begun to colonize space and terraforming alien planets, to varying results.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-new-vegas-devs-share-lore-detail-about-the/1100-6465339/|title=Fallout: New Vegas Devs Share Lore Detail About The Outer Worlds|first=Steve|last=Watts|work=[[Gamespot]] |date=March 8, 2019|accessdate=August 3, 2019}}</ref> Earth residents are encouraged to undertake efforts to colonize these systems.\n\nAmong them is Halcyon, a six-planet star system. Travelling to Halcyon requires both the usage of advanced spacecrafts with a specialist \"skip-drive\", and a 10-year cryosleep for the colonists. In 2285, two colony ships were dispatched to colonise Halcyon - the ''Hope'' and the ''Groundbreaker''. While the ''Groundbreaker'' successfully arrived in Halcyon, colonising the planets Terra 1 (later renamed Monarch) and Terra 2, the ''Hope'' and her cargo mysteriously disappeared in transit, slipping into myth among the citizens of Halcyon. The ''Groundbreaker'' is placed in a permanent orbit near Terra 2, with the original crew's descendants converting her from a colony ship into a small independent citadel.\n\n=== Synopsis ===\nIn 2355, the ''Hope'' is discovered drifting on the outskirts of the Halcyon system by mad scientist Phineas Welles, who manages to safely revive one of the passengers (the \"Stranger\"). Welles informs the Stranger that the Halcyon colony has fallen on hard times due to the mass incompetence of the various mega-corporations (referred to collectively as \"The Board\") that govern every aspect of life in Halcyon. Due to the after-effects of prolonged cryosleep, the Stranger has substantially higher mental and physical abilities than the majority of ordinary Halcyon residents. Welles tasks the Stranger with securing the resources needed to revive the remaining ''Hope'' colonists, who Welles believes hold the key to Halcyon's salvation.\n\nWelles jettison the Stranger in an escape pod onto Terra 2, where a contact, smuggler Alex Hawthorne, is waiting. Unfortunately, the Stranger's pod lands on Hawthorne, killing him instantly. The Stranger commandeers Hawthorne's ship, the ''Unreliable'', which is piloted by an [[artificial intelligence]] named ADA. In search of a power converter for the ''Unreliable'', the Stranger ventures into the nearby frontier town of Edgewater, where the Board-supported cannery town is caught in a cold war with deserters led by Adelaide McDevitt. The Stranger is asked by town mayor Reed Tobson to divert power away from the McDevitt's village back to Edgewater, forcing the deserters to return to Edgewater. However, McDevitt instead suggests diverting power to her clan, shutting down the canneries and freeing the townsfolk from Board oppression.\n\nThe Stranger is joined on this mission by Edgewater's bashful town engineer [[Parvati Holcomb]], and later offers her a place aboard the ''Unreliable''. The Stranger is later also able to recruit further allies to their crew, including wisecracking [[mercenary]] Ellie Fenhill, ship's hand Felix Millstone, Edgewater [[vicar]] Maximillian DeSoto, [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] monster-hunter Nyoka, and a cleaning robot named SAM. As the story progresses, the Stranger learns that Welles is wanted by the Board for acts of alleged terrorism, and can decide whether to side themselves with Welles or the Board in their quest to save Halcyon.\n\nAfter leaving Terra 2, the Stranger heads to Monarch, a colonised moon orbiting the gas giant Olympus, where an information Broker holds the location of a batch of dimethyl sulfoxide, a chemical important to Welles' revival of the ''Hope''<nowiki/>'s colonists. As landing on Monarch is prohibited since the Board disowned the colony there, the Stranger must first retrieve a passkey from aboard the ''Groundbreaker'', which remains independent from the Board. With the passkey, the Stranger lands in the town of Stellar Bay to discover the colony divided into two violent factions - Monarch Stellar Industries (MSI), a corporate group led by Sanjar Nandi who face harsh opposition from the Board for their self-declared ownership of Monarch; and the Iconoclasts, idealistic revolutionaries led by Graham Bryant and Zora Blackwood. After retrieving the intel from the Broker, the Stranger witnesses a Board gunship crash nearby. Both the MSI and the Iconoclasts ask the Stranger to retrieve the gunship's weapons; the Stranger can choose to give the weapons to either side, or negotiate peace between the two factions.\n\nWith the Broker's intel, Welles directs the Stranger to Halcyon's wealthy capital Byzantium, where the Minister of Earth, Aloysius Clarke, has just signed on a shipment of dimethyl sulfoxide. Tracking down Clarke to his townhouse, the Stranger learns that Clarke has been placed under house arrest by Board Chairman Charles Rockwell, the true recipient of the chemicals. In Rockwell's private quarters, the Stranger discovers a video in which Rockwell announces the \"Lifetime Employment Program\"; the Board is conspiring to place the majority of the colonists in indefinite cryosleep, ostensibly in order to save humanity but in actuality to hoard the remaining food supplies for the wealthiest citizens. In order to store these frozen workers, the ''Hope'' colonists will be ejected into space, with the ''Hope'' turned into a vast cryogenic warehouse. The dimethyl sulfoxide is being used on human test subjects to attempt to recreate Welles' formula, in the hope that workers can be repeatedly pulled out of extended periods of suspended animation. The Stranger retrieves the chemicals, with or without killing the test subjects in the process.\n\nWelles suggests using ADA and the ''Unreliable''<nowiki/>'s power to \"skip\" the ''Hope'' into the inner Halcyon system, placing it in orbit near his laboratory above Terra 2 so that he can begin the revival process. Sophia Akande, the Adjutant for the Board, instead proposes that the Stranger skip the ''Hope'' to Tartarus, a planet home to the Board's infamous Labyrinth prison complex, so that the Board can apprehend Welles and begin killing the colonists. The Stranger infiltrates the ''Hope'' and learns of what occurred during the ill-fated voyage; the ''Hope''<nowiki/>'s skip drive developed an unforeseen fault, extending the planned 10-year mission to 60 years. As food rations ran out, some of the crew turned to cannibalising the frozen colonists in order to survive, before staging a mutiny. The captain sealed the ''Hope''<nowiki/>'s cryo-chambers and locked the ship on course for Halcyon, leaving everyone aboard to succumb to starvation. The Stranger also discovers that they were not the first colonist Welles attempted to reanimate; he actually tried at least twelve times prior with fatal results for the colonists involved.\n\nWiring ADA through to the ''Hope''<nowiki/>'s control system, the Stranger skips the ''Hope'' either to Terra 2 or to Tartarus. Depending on where the ''Hope'' arrives in Halcyon, the ending diverges:\n\n* If the Stranger chooses to skip the ''Hope'' themselves rather than ask ADA to do it, and the game has been played with low-intelligence settings, the game ends here. The ''Hope'' will be launched straight into Halcyon's Sun, destroying the ship and killing everyone aboard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gameranx.com/features/id/186162/article/the-outer-worlds-get-this-secret-ending-if-youre-really-dumb-sunburn-guide/|title=The Outer Worlds: Get This Secret Ending If You're Really Dumb {{!}} 'Sunburn' Guide|last=Thielenhaus|first=Kevin|date=2019-11-02|website=Gameranx|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref>\n* If the ''Hope'' was skipped to Terra 2, the Board will apprehend Welles at his base and take him to the Labyrinth on Tartarus. The Stranger and their crew land on Tartarus and fight their way through the prison, learning Welles is being held hostage by either Akande or Rockwell. The Stranger must reach Welles and negotiate with his captor, forcing them to release him either peacefully or by force.\n* If the ''Hope'' was skipped to Tartarus, an enraged Welles will travel to Tartarus himself and start a riot in the Labyrinth, taking Akande hostage in a bid to get to the ''Hope'' and her colonists. The Stranger and their crew land on Tartarus and fight their way through the prison. The Stranger must reach Welles and confront him, forcing him to release Akande either peacefully or by force.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the Stranger is informed that contact with Earth has been lost, and that a Board troopship en route to the home planet mysteriously disappeared in transit. The Stranger is offered leadership of the Halcyon colonies and allowed to shape humanity's future however they see fit. With Halcyon free of Earth's influence the colony is free to shape its own destiny, either under the Board's Life Employment Programme or under the freedom brought by the loss of the Board's influence. The Stranger and their crew go their separate ways as their individual fates are explained, and the story of the ''Unreliable'' slips into legend.\n\n==Development==\nThe game is developed by [[Obsidian Entertainment]] and published by [[Take-Two Interactive]]'s publishing label [[Private Division]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/12/07/obsidian-entertainment-announce-the-outer-wilds/|title=Obsidian Entertainment announce The Outer Worlds|first=Alice|last=O'Connor|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=December 7, 2018|accessdate=December 7, 2018}}</ref> Though Obsidian was in progress to be acquired by [[Microsoft Studios]] at the time of the game's announcement, the project had been under development before that point, and Take-Two had secured the publishing rights prior to Microsoft's acquisition offer.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/7/18130594/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-microsoft | title = The Outer Worlds isn\u2019t a Microsoft game, even though it\u2019s buying Obsidian | first = Charlie | last = Hall | date = December 7, 2018 | accessdate = December 7, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>\n\n[[Tim Cain]] and [[Leonard Boyarsky]], the creators of the ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' series, served as the game's directors.

Directors [[David Lean]], [[Steve James (producer)|Steve James]], [[Coen brothers|Joel Coen and Ethan Coen]] (under the alias \"Roderick Jaynes\"), [[Michel Hazanavicius]] and [[Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e]] (under the alias \"John Mac McMurphy\") have been nominated for editing their own films, with Cameron, Cuar\u00f3n, and the Coens each being nominated for the award twice. Additionally, Best Film Editing winner, [[Walter Murch]], although known for film editing and sound, directed the Oscar nominated ''[[Return to Oz]]'' and is, to date, the only person with Oscars for both sound engineering and film editing, winning them in the same year for his work on ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]''. Also, nominated editors [[Robert Wise]], [[Francis D. Lyon]], who won for ''[[Body and Soul (1947 film)|Body and Soul]]'' and [[Hal Ashby]], who won for ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]'', became directors whose films were in turn nominated for Best Film Editing, namely ''[[Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956 film)|Somebody Up There Likes Me]]'', ''[[I Want to Live!]]'', ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'', ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]]'' and ''[[The Andromeda Strain (film)|The Andromeda Strain]]'' for Wise, ''[[Crazylegs (film)|Crazylegs]]'' for Lyon and ''[[Bound for Glory (1976 film)|Bound for Glory]]'' and ''[[Coming Home (1978 film)|Coming Home]]'' for Ashby.\n\n==Superlatives==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!width=\"150\" | '''Category'''\n!width=\"150\" | '''Superlative'''\n!width=\"150\" | '''Name'''\n!width=\"150\" | '''Year'''\n!width=\"350\" | '''Notes'''\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"| Most awards<ref name=\"editing\">{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/Help/Statistics?file=FEdit-Facts.pdf|title=FILM EDITING FACTS: MOST NOMINATIONS AND AWARDS|accessdate=2020-01-27|publisher=Oscars.org}}</ref>\n|rowspan=\"4\"| 3 awards \n| [[Michael Kahn (film editor)|Michael Kahn]]\n| 1998 \n|rowspan=\"2\"| Awards resulted from 8 nominations\n|-\n| [[Thelma Schoonmaker]]\n| 2006 \n|-\n| [[Daniel Mandell]]\n| 1960 \n| Awards resulted from 5 nominations\n|-\n| [[Ralph Dawson]]\n| 1938 \n| Awards resulted from 4 nominations\n|-\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Most nominations<ref name=\"editing\" />\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 8 nominations \n| [[Michael Kahn (film editor)|Michael Kahn]]\n| 2012 \n|rowspan=\"2\"| Nominations resulted in 3 awards\n|-\n| [[Thelma Schoonmaker]]\n| 2019\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Most nominations without a win\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 6 nominations\n| [[Gerry Hambling]] \n| 1996\n| Died in 2013  \n|-\n| [[Frederic Knudtson]]\n| 1963\n| Died in 1964\n|}\n\n<!-- note to editors: other superlative tables include oldest and youngest nominee and oldest and youngest winner.

The name of this award is occasionally changed; in 2008, it was listed as the '''Academy Award for Achievement in Film Editing'''.\n\nFour film editors have won this award three times in their career:\n\n* [[Ralph Dawson]] won for ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1935), ''[[Anthony Adverse]]'' (1936), and ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938)\n* [[Daniel Mandell]] won for ''[[The Pride of the Yankees]]'' (1942), ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' (1946), and ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960).\n* [[Michael Kahn (film editor)|Michael Kahn]] won for ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), ''[[Schindler's List]]'' (1993), and ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' (1998).\n* [[Thelma Schoonmaker]] won for ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980), ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' (2004), and ''[[The Departed]]'' (2006).\n\nTo date, two film directors have won this award, [[James Cameron]] and [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]] for the films ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'', respectively. Directors [[David Lean]], [[Steve James (producer)|Steve James]], [[Coen brothers|Joel Coen and Ethan Coen]] (under the alias \"Roderick Jaynes\"), [[Michel Hazanavicius]] and [[Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e]] (under the alias \"John Mac McMurphy\") have been nominated for editing their own films, with Cameron, Cuar\u00f3n, and the Coens each being nominated for the award twice. Additionally, Best Film Editing winner, [[Walter Murch]], although known for film editing and sound, directed the Oscar nominated ''[[Return to Oz]]'' and is, to date, the only person with Oscars for both sound engineering and film editing, winning them in the same year for his work on ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]''. Also, nominated editors [[Robert Wise]], [[Francis D. Lyon]], who won for ''[[Body and Soul (1947 film)|Body and Soul]]'' and [[Hal Ashby]], who won for ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]'', became directors whose films were in turn nominated for Best Film Editing, namely ''[[Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956 film)|Somebody Up There Likes Me]]'', ''[[I Want to Live!]]'', ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'', ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]]'' and ''[[The Andromeda Strain (film)|The Andromeda Strain]]'' for Wise, ''[[Crazylegs (film)|Crazylegs]]'' for Lyon and ''[[Bound for Glory (1976 film)|Bound for Glory]]'' and ''[[Coming Home (1978 film)|Coming Home]]'' for Ashby.\n\n==Superlatives==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!width=\"150\" | '''Category'''\n!width=\"150\" | '''Superlative'''\n!width=\"150\" | '''Name'''\n!width=\"150\" | '''Year'''\n!width=\"350\" | '''Notes'''\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"| Most awards<ref name=\"editing\">{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/Help/Statistics?file=FEdit-Facts.pdf|title=FILM EDITING FACTS: MOST NOMINATIONS AND AWARDS|accessdate=2020-01-27|publisher=Oscars.org}}</ref>\n|rowspan=\"4\"| 3 awards \n| [[Michael Kahn (film editor)|Michael Kahn]]\n| 1998 \n|rowspan=\"2\"| Awards resulted from 8 nominations\n|-\n| [[Thelma Schoonmaker]]\n| 2006 \n|-\n| [[Daniel Mandell]]\n| 1960 \n| Awards resulted from 5 nominations\n|-\n| [[Ralph Dawson]]\n| 1938 \n| Awards resulted from 4 nominations\n|-\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Most nominations<ref name=\"editing\" />\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 8 nominations \n| [[Michael Kahn (film editor)|Michael Kahn]]\n| 2012 \n|rowspan=\"2\"| Nominations resulted in 3 awards\n|-\n| [[Thelma Schoonmaker]]\n| 2019\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Most nominations without a win\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 6 nominations\n| [[Gerry Hambling]] \n| 1996\n| Died in 2013  \n|-\n| [[Frederic Knudtson]]\n| 1963\n| Died in 1964\n|}\n\n<!-- note to editors: other superlative tables include oldest and youngest nominee and oldest and youngest winner.

Closely related to [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Karelian language|Karelian]], Veps is also written using Latin script.\n\nAccording to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] statistics, 12,500 people were self-designated ethnic Veps at the end of 1989.\n\nAccording to the location of the people, the language is divided into three main [[dialect]]s: '''Northern Veps''' (at [[Lake Onega]] to the south of [[Petrozavodsk]], to the north of the river [[Svir River|Svir]], including the former [[Veps National Volost]]), '''Central Veps''' (in the [[Saint Petersburg]] region and [[Vologda Oblast]]), and '''Southern Veps''' (in the [[Saint Petersburg]] region).

See subtitles in Veps language. [[Karelian Research Centre of RAS|KarRC RAS]], 2018.]]\n\n[[File:Flag of Vepsia.svg|thumb|Flag of the Vepsian people]]\n\nVeps is the easternmost surviving member of the Finnic languages. Having developed in relative isolation, the language lacks several features found in its relatives, such as [[consonant gradation]] and the [[length (phonetics)|length]] contrast in consonants. Original vowel length has mostly been lost as well (with the exception of Northern Veps, which retains ''ii'' and ''uu''). At the same time, it retains a number of archaic features.\n\nThe closest relative of Veps is [[Ludic language|Ludic]], connecting Veps to the wider Finnic dialect continuum.\n\nVeps also shows some characteristic innovations such as the vocalization of original syllable-final{{nbsp}}*l, and the expansion of the local case system.\n\n==Dialects==\nVeps shows substantial dialectal variation, affecting both phonetics and grammatical features. Three main dialect areas can be distinguished, the northern, central and southern dialects.\n\n===Northern===\nNorthern Veps is spoken in the [[Republic of Karelia]] along the coast of [[Lake Onega]] south of [[Petrozavodsk]]. It is also spoken in a few small villages in [[Leningrad Oblast]]. Villages speaking Northern Veps include [[Shyoltozero]], [[Rybreka]], and [[Kvartsitny]], as well as the city of Petrozavodsk itself.\n\nCharacteristics of Northern Veps are:\n* Diphthongs are either preserved in their historical form (''koume''), or the first component is raised (''jaug'' [j\u0251\u028a\u032fg] > ''d\u02b9oug'').\n* Combinations of vowel + ''l'' are usually preserved (''tal\u02b9v'' [t\u0251l\u02b2v], ''velg'', ''sild'', ''sil\u02b9m'' [sil\u02b2m], ''olda'', ''s\u00fcl\u02b9g''' [syl\u02b2g\u02b2], ''p\u00f6lvaz'' [\u02e1p\u00f8lvaz]), rarely vocalized to diphthongs: ''al'' > ''au'', ''el'', ''il'', ''\u00fcl'' [yl], ''\u00f6l'' [\u00f8l]> ''\u00fcu'' [yw] and ''ol'' > ''uu'' [u\u02d0].\n* ''l'', ''n'', ''r'' are always palatalized before ''e'' in a non-initial syllable.\n* Word-final consonants are not palatalized after ''i'', in for example the past indicative, the conditional and some case forms.\n* Long close vowels are retained, with ''*\u00fc\u00fc'' [y\u02d0] often diphthongized to ''\u00fcu'' (''*p\u00fc\u00fc'' > ''p\u00fcu'', contrast Southern and Central Veps ''p\u00fc'').\n* ''j'' is [[Fortition|fortified]] to ''d\u02b9'' [d\u02b2] word-initially, and medially after consonants (''jaug'' > ''d\u02b9oug'' [d\u02b2o\u028a\u032fg\u02d0], ''jogi'' > ''d\u02b9ogi'' [d\u02b2ogi], ''j\u00e4rv'' > ''d\u02b9\u00e4rv'' d\u02b2\u00e6rv], ''agj'' > ''agd\u02b9'').\n* The last consonant of the stem is lengthened in the third-person singular present indicative (''k\u00fczub'' > ''k\u00fczzub'', ''tapab'' > ''tappab''), and stem-final ''e'' becomes ''o'' (''lugeb'' > ''luggob'').\n* Only traces of vowel harmony are retained.\n\n===Central===\nCentral Veps dialects are rather distinct from each other compared to Northern and Southern Veps, which are relatively homogeneous. They are spoken around a long line stretching from [[Tervenichey]] in the [[Lodeinopolsky District]] of Leningrad Oblast, to near [[Lake Beloye (Vologda Oblast)|Lake Beloye]]. The largest locality speaking Central Veps dialects is [[Vinnitsy]].\n\nCharacteristics of Central Veps are:\n* Diphthongs are usually modified (''sain'' > ''sein\u02b9'', ''s\u00f6i'' > ''s\u00fci'').\n* Combinations of vowel + ''l'' are vocalized to diphthongs in Kuya and Pondala ([[Belozersk]]), and usually preserved elsewhere (''edel'', ''sil\u02b9m'', ''s\u00fcl\u02b9kta'', ''v\u00f6l'').\n* ''al'' and ''el'' are vocalized to ''ou'' or ''uu'' (''el'' may also become ''\u00fcu'') in the adessive and ablative case forms (''talvel'' > ''touvuu'' or ''touv\u00fcu'', ''m\u00e4gelp\u00e4i'' > ''m\u00e4guupei'').\n* Word-final consonants are palatalized after ''i'' (''m\u00e4nid'' > ''m\u00e4nid\u02b9'', ''m\u00e4ni\u017ein'' > ''m\u00e4ni\u017ein\u02b9'').\n* In Kuya village, the vowel in the allative ending depends on the preceding stem vowel. After ''i'' the ending is ''-le'' (''kanoile''), after ''a'' it is ''-la'' (''kalala'') and after other vowels it is ''-lo'' (''lebulo'').\n* ''j'' is preserved in most dialects, mostly in the west (''jono'', ''agj''). ''j'' is fortified to ''d\u02b9'' in Kuya (''d\u02b9ono'', ''agd\u02b9''). It is fortified to ''g\u02b9'' in Pondala, Voylahta, Nemzha, and Shimozero (''g\u02b9ono'', ''agg\u02b9'').\n* [[Final obstruent devoicing]] in Kuya Veps (''sanub'' > ''sanup'', ''vellesed'' > ''velleset'').\n* Unrounding of ''\u00fc'' and ''\u00f6'' in a few villages (''p\u00fch\u00e4'' > ''pih\u00e4'', ''p\u00f6koi'' > ''pekoi'').\n* ''\u00e4'' > ''e'' in Shimozero<!-- also \"ladvinskikh\" dialects, whatever that is --> (''p\u00e4iv'' > ''pei(v)'').\n* Vowel harmony is weakly preserved, most prominently in the eastern and south-western areas.\n\n===Southern===\nSouthern Veps is spoken in the [[Boksitogorsky District]] of Leningrad Oblast, including the villages of [[Radogoshcha]] and {{ill|Sidorovo, Boksitogorsky District|lt=Sidorovo|ru|\u0421\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e (\u0411\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d)}}.\n\nCharacteristics of Southern Veps are:\n* Diphthongs are monophtongized to long vowels, especially in non-initial syllables (''perti\u0161p\u00e4i'' > ''perti\u0161p\u00e4\u00e4'', ''heboine'' > ''heboone''<!-- [the source also gives this, but doesn't say what the original form is], ''rikoomaa''-->).\n* Combinations of vowel + ''l'' are usually preserved.\n* ''al'' and ''el'' are vocalized to ''aa'' and ''oo'' in the adessive and ablative case forms (''tal\u02b9vel'' > ''tal\u02b9voo'', ''kezal'' > ''kezaa'').\n* ''l'' and ''n'' are palatalized before ''e'' non-initial syllables when followed by a case ending or person-and-number ending. ''r'' is not palatalized.\n* Word-final consonants are palatalized after ''i'', in for example the past indicative, the conditional and some case forms.\n* ''j'' is preserved (''jogi'', ''j\u00fcged'').\n* Unrounding of front rounded vowels, ''\u00fc'' > ''i'' (''p\u00fch\u00e4'' > ''pih\u00e4'') and ''\u00f6'' > ''e''.\n* The ending ''-i'' of the third-person singular past indicative is usually dropped, leaving palatalization of the preceding consonant (''p\u00e4sti'' > ''p\u00e4st\u02b9'', ''v\u00e4ti'' > ''v\u00e4t\u02b9'', ''kolkati'' > ''kolkat\u02b9'').\n* Vowel harmony is preserved well (''h\u00f6bl\u00f6t\u00e4d\u00e4'', ''p\u00f6r\u00fcd\u00e4'', ''s\u00f6d\u00e4'').\n\n==Phonology==\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|+ Consonant phonemes of Veps<ref>\u0413\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u043f\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 (page 24), M.

However, palatalized consonants also occur in other environments, especially in word-final position or in word-final clusters.\n\nThere are some cases where the front vowel {{IPA|/i/}} is preceded by a non-palatalized consonant. In native Finnic vocabulary, this occurs where inflectional endings beginning with {{IPA|/i/}} are attached to words with a stem ending in a non-palatalized consonant. The consonant is not palatalized by {{IPA|/i/}} in this case, but remains non-palatalized by analogy with the other inflected forms. The vowel {{IPA|/i/}} is backed to {{IPA|[\u0268]}} in this case, as in Russian, making it unclear whether the palatalization is a consequence of the front vowel, or the backing is the result of the lack of palatalization. Either analysis is possible.\n\nCompare:\n* ''nor\u02b9'' {{IPA|/nor\u02b2/}} (\"young\"), genitive singular ''noren'' {{IPA|/nor\u02b2en/}}, partitive plural ''norid'' {{IPA|/nor\u02b2id/}}\n* ''nor'' {{IPA|/nor/}} (\"rope\"), genitive singular ''noran'' {{IPA|/nor\u0251n/}}, partitive plural ''norid'' {{IPA|/norid/}} (or {{IPA|/nor\u0268d/}})\n\nRussian loanwords have also introduced instances of non-palatalized consonants followed by {{IPA|/i/}}, which are much more frequent in that language.\n\nThe phoneme {{IPA|/e/}} can also in some cases be preceded by non-palatalized consonants, for example in the allative ending ''-le''.\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n|+ Vowel phonemes of Veps<ref>\u0413\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u043f\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 (page 17), M.

See above under \"Palatalization\" for more information. It does not occur in the first syllable of a word.\n\n====Vowel harmony====\n\nLike many other Finnic languages, Veps has [[vowel harmony]] but in a much more limited form. Words are split into back-vowel and front-vowel words based on which vowels they contain:\n\n* Back vowels: {{IPA|/\u0251/}}, {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}\n* Front vowels: {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}, {{IPA|/\u00f8/}} and {{IPA|/y/}}\n\nHowever, the front vowels can only occur in the first two syllables of a word. In a third or later syllable, and also sometimes in the second syllable, they are converted to the corresponding back vowel. Thus, vowel harmony only applies (inconsistently) in the second syllable, and has been lost elsewhere. It is not applied for inflectional endings except in a few exceptional cases, but is retained more frequently in derivational endings.\n\nFor example:\n* ''korged'' (\"high\", back-vowel harmony), genitive singular ''korkt'''a'''n'', derived noun ''korkt'''u'''z<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' (\"height\"); compare Finnish ''korke'''a'''n'', ''korke'''u'''s''.\n* ''pimed'' (\"dark\", back-vowel harmony), genitive singular ''pimed'''a'''n'', derived noun ''pimed'''u'''z<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' (\"darkness\"); compare Finnish ''pime'''\u00e4'''n'', ''pime'''y'''s''.\n* ''h\u00fcv'''\u00e4''''' (\"good\", front-vowel harmony), illative singular ''h\u00fcv'''\u00e4'''h'''a''''', derived noun ''h\u00fcv'''\u00fc'''z<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' (\"goodness\"); compare Finnish ''hyv'''\u00e4\u00e4'''n'', ''hyv'''yy'''s''.\n* ''p\u00e4iv'' (\"day\", front-vowel harmony), genitive singular ''p\u00e4iv'''\u00e4'''n'', illative singular ''p\u00e4ivh'''a'''n''; compare Finnish ''p\u00e4iv'''\u00e4'''n'', ''p\u00e4iv'''\u00e4\u00e4'''n''.\n* ''p\u00e4'' (\"head\", back-vowel harmony), illative singular ''p\u00e4h'''a'''''; compare Finnish ''p\u00e4\u00e4h'''\u00e4'''n''.\n* ''kez'''a''''' (\"summer\", back-vowel harmony); compare Finnish ''kes'''\u00e4'''''.\n* ''v\u00e4v'''u''''' (\"son-in-law\", back-vowel harmony); compare Finnish ''v\u00e4v'''y'''''.\n* ''\u00fcld'''\u00fc'''d'''a''''' (\"to rise\", front-vowel harmony in second syllable, back-vowel in third); compare Finnish ''ylt'''y\u00e4'''''.\n* ''k\u00fcz'''u'''d'''a''''' (\"to ask\", back-vowel harmony); compare Finnish ''kys'''y\u00e4'''''.\n\n==Orthography==\nThe modern Vepsian alphabet is a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The government of the Republic of Karelia approved the Veps language alphabet|url=http://gov.karelia.ru/News/2007/04/0417_06_e.html|accessdate=2011-01-08}}</ref> It consists of a total of twenty-nine characters: twenty-two are from the [[basic modern Latin alphabet]], six are derived from basic Latin letters by the addition of [[diacritical marks]], and the final character is the apostrophe, which signifies [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] of the preceding sound.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \t\n| style=\"background:#efefef; text-align:center;\" colspan=\"29\" | '''[[Capital letters|Majuscule Forms]]''' (also called '''uppercase''' or '''capital letters''')\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[A]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[B]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[C]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[\u010c]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[D]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[E]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[F]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[G]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[H]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[I]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[J]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[K]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[L]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[M]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[N]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[O]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[P]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[R]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[S]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[\u0160]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[Z]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[\u017d]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[T]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[U]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[V]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[\u00dc]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[\u00c4]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[\u00d6]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[Prime (symbol)|\u02b9]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:#efefef; text-align:center;\" colspan=\"29\"| '''[[Lower case|Minuscule Forms]]''' (also called '''lowercase''' or '''small letters''')\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| a\n| b\n| c\n| \u010d\n| d\n| e\n| f\n| g\n| h\n| i\n| j\n| k\n| l\n| m\n| n\n| o\n| p\n| r\n| s\n| \u0161\n| z\n| \u017e\n| t\n| u\n| v\n| \u00fc\n| \u00e4\n| \u00f6\n| \u02b9\n|}\n\nVeps orthography is largely phonemic, and represents each phoneme with one letter.

For the following letters {{angbr|i}} and {{angbr|e}}, this is ambiguous, however: they can be preceded by both types of consonants, as noted above in the phonology section. Whether a consonant before the letter {{angbr|i}} or {{angbr|e}} is palatalized or not cannot be determined from the orthography and must be learned for each word.\n\n==Grammar==\n[[File:Veps bukvar.jpg|thumb|250px|A Soviet textbook for native speakers of Veps printed in the 1930s]]\nLike other Finnic languages, Veps is an [[agglutinating]] language. The preservation of the Proto-Finnic weak-grade consonants ''*d'' and ''*g'' in all positions, along with the loss of consonant gradation, has made Veps morphology relatively simple compared to the other Finnic languages. There are fewer inflectional classes, and inflections of nominals and verbs alike can be predicted from only a few basic [[principal parts]].\n\n===Nouns===\nVeps has twenty-three [[grammatical case]]s, more than any other [[Finnic languages|Finnic language]]. It preserves the basic set of Finnic cases shared by most Finnic languages, including the [[Proto-Finnic locative system|six locative cases]], but several more cases have been added that generally have no counterpart in the others.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

For example, for the illative singular: ''mec'''a'''n'' > ''mech'''a''''', ''nor'''e'''n'' > ''nor'''e'''h'''e''''', ''p\u00f6ud'''o'''n'' > ''p\u00f6udh'''o''''', ''p'''\u00e4'''n'' > ''p'''\u00e4'''h'''a'''''. Note that the stem-final vowel itself can disappear in these forms, but the rule applies the same.\n# In endings beginning with ''s'' or ''z'' or a group of consonants containing ''s'' or ''z'', this changes to ''\u0161''/''\u017e'' if the last preceding vowel is ''i''. This always occurs in the plural forms.\n# The partitive, allative, terminative II, additive II and prolative singular cases have longer endings that are used with a few frequently-used pronouns, ''ken'' \"who\" and ''mi'' \"what\".\n\n====Principal parts====\n\nNouns have four [[principal part]]s, from which all other noun forms can be derived by replacing the endings:\n* Nominative singular: Forms no other forms.\n* Partitive singular: Forms the prolative singular. Can usually be formed from the genitive singular by replacing ''-n'' with ''-d'', but some words have an unpredictable form with ''-t'' and a different stem.\n* Genitive singular: When ''-n'' is removed, forms all remaining singular forms, and the nominative and accusative plural.\n* Illative singular: Forms the illative, terminative I and additive I singular. The illative singular is predictably formed from the genitive singular stem, so it's not a principal part as such.\n* Partitive plural: When ''-d'' is removed, forms all remaining plural forms.\n\n\nThe illative singular stem is the same as the genitive singular stem, except that the final vowel is dropped in some cases. The vowel is retained if ''at least one'' of these is the case, and dropped otherwise:\n# The final vowel is a diphthong.\n# The nominative singular is of the form \"consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel\".\n# The genitive singular has 1 or 3 syllables.\n# There is contraction of a syllable in the genitive singular stem (compared to the nominative stem), e.g. nom sg ''vauged'' > gen sg ''vauktan'' (contraction ''-ged'' > ''-kt-''), nom sg ''lambaz'' > gen sg ''lambhan'' (contraction ''-az'' > ''-h-'').\n# The final consonants of genitive singular stem are ''ll'' or ''l\u02b9l\u02b9''.\n\nThus:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Closely related to [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Karelian language|Karelian]], Veps is also written using Latin script.\n\nAccording to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] statistics, 12,500 people were self-designated ethnic Veps at the end of 1989.\n\nAccording to the location of the people, the language is divided into three main [[dialect]]s: '''Northern Veps''' (at [[Lake Onega]] to the south of [[Petrozavodsk]], to the north of the river [[Svir River|Svir]], including the former [[Veps National Volost]]), '''Central Veps''' (in the [[Saint Petersburg]] region and [[Vologda Oblast]]), and '''Southern Veps''' (in the [[Saint Petersburg]] region). The Northern dialect seems the most distinct of the three; however, it is still mutually intelligible for speakers of the other two dialects. Speakers of the Northern dialect call themselves \"Ludi\" (''l\u00fcdikad''), or ''l\u00fcdilai\u017eed''.\n\nIn [[Russia]], more than 350 children learn the Veps language in a total of 5 national schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gov.karelia.ru/News/2004/12/1209_03_e.html|title=09.12.2004 - The Vepsian Culture Society in Karelia celebrates its 15th anniversary|work=gov.karelia.ru}}</ref>\n\n==Classification and history==\n\n[[File:Veps language and VepKar corpus by Nina Zaitseva 2018.webm|thumb|thumbtime=106|Nina Zaitseva speaks about the Veps language and the [http://dictorpus.krc.karelia.ru/en VepKar corpus]. See subtitles in Veps language. [[Karelian Research Centre of RAS|KarRC RAS]], 2018.]]\n\n[[File:Flag of Vepsia.svg|thumb|Flag of the Vepsian people]]\n\nVeps is the easternmost surviving member of the Finnic languages. Having developed in relative isolation, the language lacks several features found in its relatives, such as [[consonant gradation]] and the [[length (phonetics)|length]] contrast in consonants. Original vowel length has mostly been lost as well (with the exception of Northern Veps, which retains ''ii'' and ''uu''). At the same time, it retains a number of archaic features.\n\nThe closest relative of Veps is [[Ludic language|Ludic]], connecting Veps to the wider Finnic dialect continuum.\n\nVeps also shows some characteristic innovations such as the vocalization of original syllable-final{{nbsp}}*l, and the expansion of the local case system.\n\n==Dialects==\nVeps shows substantial dialectal variation, affecting both phonetics and grammatical features. Three main dialect areas can be distinguished, the northern, central and southern dialects.\n\n===Northern===\nNorthern Veps is spoken in the [[Republic of Karelia]] along the coast of [[Lake Onega]] south of [[Petrozavodsk]]. It is also spoken in a few small villages in [[Leningrad Oblast]]. Villages speaking Northern Veps include [[Shyoltozero]], [[Rybreka]], and [[Kvartsitny]], as well as the city of Petrozavodsk itself.\n\nCharacteristics of Northern Veps are:\n* Diphthongs are either preserved in their historical form (''koume''), or the first component is raised (''jaug'' [j\u0251\u028a\u032fg] > ''d\u02b9oug'').\n* Combinations of vowel + ''l'' are usually preserved (''tal\u02b9v'' [t\u0251l\u02b2v], ''velg'', ''sild'', ''sil\u02b9m'' [sil\u02b2m], ''olda'', ''s\u00fcl\u02b9g''' [syl\u02b2g\u02b2], ''p\u00f6lvaz'' [\u02e1p\u00f8lvaz]), rarely vocalized to diphthongs: ''al'' > ''au'', ''el'', ''il'', ''\u00fcl'' [yl], ''\u00f6l'' [\u00f8l]> ''\u00fcu'' [yw] and ''ol'' > ''uu'' [u\u02d0].\n* ''l'', ''n'', ''r'' are always palatalized before ''e'' in a non-initial syllable.\n* Word-final consonants are not palatalized after ''i'', in for example the past indicative, the conditional and some case forms.\n* Long close vowels are retained, with ''*\u00fc\u00fc'' [y\u02d0] often diphthongized to ''\u00fcu'' (''*p\u00fc\u00fc'' > ''p\u00fcu'', contrast Southern and Central Veps ''p\u00fc'').\n* ''j'' is [[Fortition|fortified]] to ''d\u02b9'' [d\u02b2] word-initially, and medially after consonants (''jaug'' > ''d\u02b9oug'' [d\u02b2o\u028a\u032fg\u02d0], ''jogi'' > ''d\u02b9ogi'' [d\u02b2ogi], ''j\u00e4rv'' > ''d\u02b9\u00e4rv'' d\u02b2\u00e6rv], ''agj'' > ''agd\u02b9'').\n* The last consonant of the stem is lengthened in the third-person singular present indicative (''k\u00fczub'' > ''k\u00fczzub'', ''tapab'' > ''tappab''), and stem-final ''e'' becomes ''o'' (''lugeb'' > ''luggob'').\n* Only traces of vowel harmony are retained.\n\n===Central===\nCentral Veps dialects are rather distinct from each other compared to Northern and Southern Veps, which are relatively homogeneous. They are spoken around a long line stretching from [[Tervenichey]] in the [[Lodeinopolsky District]] of Leningrad Oblast, to near [[Lake Beloye (Vologda Oblast)|Lake Beloye]]. The largest locality speaking Central Veps dialects is [[Vinnitsy]].\n\nCharacteristics of Central Veps are:\n* Diphthongs are usually modified (''sain'' > ''sein\u02b9'', ''s\u00f6i'' > ''s\u00fci'').\n* Combinations of vowel + ''l'' are vocalized to diphthongs in Kuya and Pondala ([[Belozersk]]), and usually preserved elsewhere (''edel'', ''sil\u02b9m'', ''s\u00fcl\u02b9kta'', ''v\u00f6l'').\n* ''al'' and ''el'' are vocalized to ''ou'' or ''uu'' (''el'' may also become ''\u00fcu'') in the adessive and ablative case forms (''talvel'' > ''touvuu'' or ''touv\u00fcu'', ''m\u00e4gelp\u00e4i'' > ''m\u00e4guupei'').\n* Word-final consonants are palatalized after ''i'' (''m\u00e4nid'' > ''m\u00e4nid\u02b9'', ''m\u00e4ni\u017ein'' > ''m\u00e4ni\u017ein\u02b9'').\n* In Kuya village, the vowel in the allative ending depends on the preceding stem vowel. After ''i'' the ending is ''-le'' (''kanoile''), after ''a'' it is ''-la'' (''kalala'') and after other vowels it is ''-lo'' (''lebulo'').\n* ''j'' is preserved in most dialects, mostly in the west (''jono'', ''agj''). ''j'' is fortified to ''d\u02b9'' in Kuya (''d\u02b9ono'', ''agd\u02b9''). It is fortified to ''g\u02b9'' in Pondala, Voylahta, Nemzha, and Shimozero (''g\u02b9ono'', ''agg\u02b9'').\n* [[Final obstruent devoicing]] in Kuya Veps (''sanub'' > ''sanup'', ''vellesed'' > ''velleset'').\n* Unrounding of ''\u00fc'' and ''\u00f6'' in a few villages (''p\u00fch\u00e4'' > ''pih\u00e4'', ''p\u00f6koi'' > ''pekoi'').\n* ''\u00e4'' > ''e'' in Shimozero<!-- also \"ladvinskikh\" dialects, whatever that is --> (''p\u00e4iv'' > ''pei(v)'').\n* Vowel harmony is weakly preserved, most prominently in the eastern and south-western areas.\n\n===Southern===\nSouthern Veps is spoken in the [[Boksitogorsky District]] of Leningrad Oblast, including the villages of [[Radogoshcha]] and {{ill|Sidorovo, Boksitogorsky District|lt=Sidorovo|ru|\u0421\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e (\u0411\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d)}}.\n\nCharacteristics of Southern Veps are:\n* Diphthongs are monophtongized to long vowels, especially in non-initial syllables (''perti\u0161p\u00e4i'' > ''perti\u0161p\u00e4\u00e4'', ''heboine'' > ''heboone''<!-- [the source also gives this, but doesn't say what the original form is], ''rikoomaa''-->).\n* Combinations of vowel + ''l'' are usually preserved.\n* ''al'' and ''el'' are vocalized to ''aa'' and ''oo'' in the adessive and ablative case forms (''tal\u02b9vel'' > ''tal\u02b9voo'', ''kezal'' > ''kezaa'').\n* ''l'' and ''n'' are palatalized before ''e'' non-initial syllables when followed by a case ending or person-and-number ending. ''r'' is not palatalized.\n* Word-final consonants are palatalized after ''i'', in for example the past indicative, the conditional and some case forms.\n* ''j'' is preserved (''jogi'', ''j\u00fcged'').\n* Unrounding of front rounded vowels, ''\u00fc'' > ''i'' (''p\u00fch\u00e4'' > ''pih\u00e4'') and ''\u00f6'' > ''e''.\n* The ending ''-i'' of the third-person singular past indicative is usually dropped, leaving palatalization of the preceding consonant (''p\u00e4sti'' > ''p\u00e4st\u02b9'', ''v\u00e4ti'' > ''v\u00e4t\u02b9'', ''kolkati'' > ''kolkat\u02b9'').\n* Vowel harmony is preserved well (''h\u00f6bl\u00f6t\u00e4d\u00e4'', ''p\u00f6r\u00fcd\u00e4'', ''s\u00f6d\u00e4'').\n\n==Phonology==\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|+ Consonant phonemes of Veps<ref>\u0413\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u043f\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 (page 24), M.

However, palatalized consonants also occur in other environments, especially in word-final position or in word-final clusters.\n\nThere are some cases where the front vowel {{IPA|/i/}} is preceded by a non-palatalized consonant. In native Finnic vocabulary, this occurs where inflectional endings beginning with {{IPA|/i/}} are attached to words with a stem ending in a non-palatalized consonant. The consonant is not palatalized by {{IPA|/i/}} in this case, but remains non-palatalized by analogy with the other inflected forms. The vowel {{IPA|/i/}} is backed to {{IPA|[\u0268]}} in this case, as in Russian, making it unclear whether the palatalization is a consequence of the front vowel, or the backing is the result of the lack of palatalization. Either analysis is possible.\n\nCompare:\n* ''nor\u02b9'' {{IPA|/nor\u02b2/}} (\"young\"), genitive singular ''noren'' {{IPA|/nor\u02b2en/}}, partitive plural ''norid'' {{IPA|/nor\u02b2id/}}\n* ''nor'' {{IPA|/nor/}} (\"rope\"), genitive singular ''noran'' {{IPA|/nor\u0251n/}}, partitive plural ''norid'' {{IPA|/norid/}} (or {{IPA|/nor\u0268d/}})\n\nRussian loanwords have also introduced instances of non-palatalized consonants followed by {{IPA|/i/}}, which are much more frequent in that language.\n\nThe phoneme {{IPA|/e/}} can also in some cases be preceded by non-palatalized consonants, for example in the allative ending ''-le''.\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n|+ Vowel phonemes of Veps<ref>\u0413\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u043f\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 (page 17), M.

See above under \"Palatalization\" for more information. It does not occur in the first syllable of a word.\n\n====Vowel harmony====\n\nLike many other Finnic languages, Veps has [[vowel harmony]] but in a much more limited form. Words are split into back-vowel and front-vowel words based on which vowels they contain:\n\n* Back vowels: {{IPA|/\u0251/}}, {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}\n* Front vowels: {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}, {{IPA|/\u00f8/}} and {{IPA|/y/}}\n\nHowever, the front vowels can only occur in the first two syllables of a word. In a third or later syllable, and also sometimes in the second syllable, they are converted to the corresponding back vowel. Thus, vowel harmony only applies (inconsistently) in the second syllable, and has been lost elsewhere. It is not applied for inflectional endings except in a few exceptional cases, but is retained more frequently in derivational endings.\n\nFor example:\n* ''korged'' (\"high\", back-vowel harmony), genitive singular ''korkt'''a'''n'', derived noun ''korkt'''u'''z<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' (\"height\"); compare Finnish ''korke'''a'''n'', ''korke'''u'''s''.\n* ''pimed'' (\"dark\", back-vowel harmony), genitive singular ''pimed'''a'''n'', derived noun ''pimed'''u'''z<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' (\"darkness\"); compare Finnish ''pime'''\u00e4'''n'', ''pime'''y'''s''.\n* ''h\u00fcv'''\u00e4''''' (\"good\", front-vowel harmony), illative singular ''h\u00fcv'''\u00e4'''h'''a''''', derived noun ''h\u00fcv'''\u00fc'''z<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' (\"goodness\"); compare Finnish ''hyv'''\u00e4\u00e4'''n'', ''hyv'''yy'''s''.\n* ''p\u00e4iv'' (\"day\", front-vowel harmony), genitive singular ''p\u00e4iv'''\u00e4'''n'', illative singular ''p\u00e4ivh'''a'''n''; compare Finnish ''p\u00e4iv'''\u00e4'''n'', ''p\u00e4iv'''\u00e4\u00e4'''n''.\n* ''p\u00e4'' (\"head\", back-vowel harmony), illative singular ''p\u00e4h'''a'''''; compare Finnish ''p\u00e4\u00e4h'''\u00e4'''n''.\n* ''kez'''a''''' (\"summer\", back-vowel harmony); compare Finnish ''kes'''\u00e4'''''.\n* ''v\u00e4v'''u''''' (\"son-in-law\", back-vowel harmony); compare Finnish ''v\u00e4v'''y'''''.\n* ''\u00fcld'''\u00fc'''d'''a''''' (\"to rise\", front-vowel harmony in second syllable, back-vowel in third); compare Finnish ''ylt'''y\u00e4'''''.\n* ''k\u00fcz'''u'''d'''a''''' (\"to ask\", back-vowel harmony); compare Finnish ''kys'''y\u00e4'''''.\n\n==Orthography==\nThe modern Vepsian alphabet is a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The government of the Republic of Karelia approved the Veps language alphabet|url=http://gov.karelia.ru/News/2007/04/0417_06_e.html|accessdate=2011-01-08}}</ref> It consists of a total of twenty-nine characters: twenty-two are from the [[basic modern Latin alphabet]], six are derived from basic Latin letters by the addition of [[diacritical marks]], and the final character is the apostrophe, which signifies [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] of the preceding sound.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \t\n| style=\"background:#efefef; text-align:center;\" colspan=\"29\" | '''[[Capital letters|Majuscule Forms]]''' (also called '''uppercase''' or '''capital letters''')\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[A]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[B]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[C]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[\u010c]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[D]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[E]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[F]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[G]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[H]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[I]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[J]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[K]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[L]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[M]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[N]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[O]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[P]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[R]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[S]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[\u0160]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[Z]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[\u017d]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[T]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[U]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[V]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[\u00dc]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[\u00c4]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[\u00d6]]\n| style=\"width:3%;\" | [[Prime (symbol)|\u02b9]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:#efefef; text-align:center;\" colspan=\"29\"| '''[[Lower case|Minuscule Forms]]''' (also called '''lowercase''' or '''small letters''')\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| a\n| b\n| c\n| \u010d\n| d\n| e\n| f\n| g\n| h\n| i\n| j\n| k\n| l\n| m\n| n\n| o\n| p\n| r\n| s\n| \u0161\n| z\n| \u017e\n| t\n| u\n| v\n| \u00fc\n| \u00e4\n| \u00f6\n| \u02b9\n|}\n\nVeps orthography is largely phonemic, and represents each phoneme with one letter.

For the following letters {{angbr|i}} and {{angbr|e}}, this is ambiguous, however: they can be preceded by both types of consonants, as noted above in the phonology section. Whether a consonant before the letter {{angbr|i}} or {{angbr|e}} is palatalized or not cannot be determined from the orthography and must be learned for each word.\n\n==Grammar==\n[[File:Veps bukvar.jpg|thumb|250px|A Soviet textbook for native speakers of Veps printed in the 1930s]]\nLike other Finnic languages, Veps is an [[agglutinating]] language. The preservation of the Proto-Finnic weak-grade consonants ''*d'' and ''*g'' in all positions, along with the loss of consonant gradation, has made Veps morphology relatively simple compared to the other Finnic languages. There are fewer inflectional classes, and inflections of nominals and verbs alike can be predicted from only a few basic [[principal parts]].\n\n===Nouns===\nVeps has twenty-three [[grammatical case]]s, more than any other [[Finnic languages|Finnic language]]. It preserves the basic set of Finnic cases shared by most Finnic languages, including the [[Proto-Finnic locative system|six locative cases]], but several more cases have been added that generally have no counterpart in the others.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

For example, for the illative singular: ''mec'''a'''n'' > ''mech'''a''''', ''nor'''e'''n'' > ''nor'''e'''h'''e''''', ''p\u00f6ud'''o'''n'' > ''p\u00f6udh'''o''''', ''p'''\u00e4'''n'' > ''p'''\u00e4'''h'''a'''''. Note that the stem-final vowel itself can disappear in these forms, but the rule applies the same.\n# In endings beginning with ''s'' or ''z'' or a group of consonants containing ''s'' or ''z'', this changes to ''\u0161''/''\u017e'' if the last preceding vowel is ''i''. This always occurs in the plural forms.\n# The partitive, allative, terminative II, additive II and prolative singular cases have longer endings that are used with a few frequently-used pronouns, ''ken'' \"who\" and ''mi'' \"what\".\n\n====Principal parts====\n\nNouns have four [[principal part]]s, from which all other noun forms can be derived by replacing the endings:\n* Nominative singular: Forms no other forms.\n* Partitive singular: Forms the prolative singular. Can usually be formed from the genitive singular by replacing ''-n'' with ''-d'', but some words have an unpredictable form with ''-t'' and a different stem.\n* Genitive singular: When ''-n'' is removed, forms all remaining singular forms, and the nominative and accusative plural.\n* Illative singular: Forms the illative, terminative I and additive I singular. The illative singular is predictably formed from the genitive singular stem, so it's not a principal part as such.\n* Partitive plural: When ''-d'' is removed, forms all remaining plural forms.\n\n\nThe illative singular stem is the same as the genitive singular stem, except that the final vowel is dropped in some cases. The vowel is retained if ''at least one'' of these is the case, and dropped otherwise:\n# The final vowel is a diphthong.\n# The nominative singular is of the form \"consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel\".\n# The genitive singular has 1 or 3 syllables.\n# There is contraction of a syllable in the genitive singular stem (compared to the nominative stem), e.g. nom sg ''vauged'' > gen sg ''vauktan'' (contraction ''-ged'' > ''-kt-''), nom sg ''lambaz'' > gen sg ''lambhan'' (contraction ''-az'' > ''-h-'').\n# The final consonants of genitive singular stem are ''ll'' or ''l\u02b9l\u02b9''.\n\nThus:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

It is located near the midpoint of the [[Calgary\u2013Edmonton Corridor]] and is surrounded by [[Red Deer County]]. It is Alberta's third most populous city{{cn|date=March 2020}} after [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and before [[Lethbridge]]. The city is located in [[aspen parkland]], a region of rolling hills that is home to oil, grain, and cattle production. It is a centre for oil and agriculture distribution, and the surrounding region is a major centre for petrochemical production. With a recorded population of 100,418 in the Canada [[2016 Canadian Census|2016 census]], Red Deer became the third Alberta city to surpass 100,000 people.<ref name=2016censusABmunis/>\n\n== History ==\nPrior to European settlement, the area was a gathering place that was inhabited by Aboriginal tribes including the [[Blackfoot]], Plains [[Cree]] and [[Stoney First Nation|Stoney]]. European fur traders began passing through the area in the late eighteenth century. Into this ethnic mix, the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] peoples also emerged.\n\nA [[First Nations|native trail]] ran from [[Montana]] in the south across the [[Bow River]] near Calgary and on to [[Fort Edmonton]]. About halfway between Calgary and Edmonton, the trail crossed the [[Red Deer River]] at a wide, stony shallow used by [[First Nations]] peoples and [[American bison|bison]], [[Bison vs Buffalo|commonly known as buffalo]], since ancient times. The shallows, now known as the Old Red Deer Crossing, are about {{convert|7|km}} upstream from the present City of Red Deer.\n\nWith the establishment of [[Fort Calgary]] by the [[North-West Mounted Police]] in 1875, traffic increased along what was by then known as the [[Calgary and Edmonton Trail]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albertatrailnet.com/downloads/December2002.pdf |format=PDF |title=Calgary and Edmonton Trail |author=Alberta Trail Net |date=December 2002 |accessdate=2009-09-14 ||url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705020554/http://www.albertatrailnet.com/downloads/December2002.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2008 }}</ref> After the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in Calgary, traffic along the \"C & E\" trail increased substantially. A [[trading post]] and [[stopping house]] were built at the Crossing in 1882 and a permanent settlement began to develop around it.\n\nDuring the 1885 [[North-West Rebellion|Riel Rebellion]] (also known as the [[North-West Rebellion]]), the [[Canadian militia]] constructed [[Fort Normandeau]] at the Crossing. The fort was later taken over by the North-West Mounted Police who used it until 1893.\n\nWith the decimation of the bison by hunters, the Aboriginal tribes who relied on them for food, clothing and shelter were also in decline. The fertile lands around the Red Deer River were attractive to farmers and ranchers. One early settler, the Reverend Leonard Gaetz, gave a half-share of {{convert|1240|acre|km2}} he had acquired to the [[Calgary and Edmonton Railway]] to develop a bridge over the river and a townsite. As a result, the Crossing was gradually abandoned. The first train from Calgary to Edmonton passed through Red Deer in 1891.\n\n=== Name origin ===\nThe [[Cree]] peoples called the river on which Red Deer stands {{transl|cr|Waskasoo Seepee}}, which translates to \"[[Elk]] River\". However, British traders translated the name as \"Red Deer River\", since they mistakenly thought elk were European [[red deer]]. Later, the settlers of the area named their community after the river.<ref name=history>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/Visitors/About+Red+Deer/History/default.htm | title=History of Red Deer | publisher=City of Red Deer | accessdate=November 15, 2013 | |url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204024702/http://www.reddeer.ca/Visitors/About+Red+Deer/History/default.htm | archivedate=December 4, 2013 | df= }}</ref> The name for the modern city in Plains Cree is a [[calque]] back from English of the mistranslated, {{transl|cr|mihkw\u00e2pisimosos}} literally \"red type of deer\" while the name of the river itself is still {{transl|cr|w\u00e2w\u00e2sk\u00easiw-s\u00eepiy}} or \"elk river\".<ref>http://www.creedictionary.com/search/?q=Red+Deer&scope=0</ref>\n\n=== Leonard Gaetz ===\n{{Main|Leonard Gaetz}}\n[[Leonard Gaetz]] acted as the local land agent for the Saskatchewan Colonization Company and purchased parts of three other sections from his employers. By 1890, the Gaetz family owned vast land holdings along the south bank of the Red Deer River around the mouth of the Waskasoo Creek. The holdings included parts of Sections 16, 17, 20 and 21. Leonard Gaetz's increasing wealth allowed his family to play a central role in the growth of Red Deer.\n\nIn 1895, Gaetz returned to the active ministry in Manitoba. Once again, this proved detrimental to his health. He retired back to Red Deer in 1901, and resided here for the remainder of his life. He was a strong promoter of the area, founding the Westerner showgrounds and annual \"Westerner Days\", akin to the Calgary Stampede. He died in Red Deer in 1907.\n\n=== 1900 to 1929 ===\nRed Deer saw a massive influx of settlers in the early 1900s.\n[[File:Michener Centre.jpg|thumbnail|Michener Centre]]\nIn 1901, when Red Deer was incorporated as a town, the population stood at 343. Through its location midway between Edmonton and Calgary and the fertile land that supported profitable mixed farming, Red Deer developed primarily as an agricultural service and distribution centre. A further boost came in 1907 when it was chosen as a major divisional point for the Canadian Pacific Railway. Two other railways, the [[Alberta Central Railway]] and the [[Canadian Northern Railway]], entered the community in 1911. Red Deer underwent a large land boom.\n\nOn March 25, 1913, Red Deer was incorporated as a city and the population had jumped to nearly 2,800.\n\n[[World War I]] brought a sharp end to the boom. Red Deer emerged as a small, quiet, but prosperous, prairie city. In 1922, the provincial institution for the care of the mentally handicapped, currently known as the Michener Centre, was established in the city. Prospects looked good for modest but sustainable growth.\n\n=== 1930 to 1945 ===\nThe [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s was a major setback for the city, though it fared better than some communities. Central Alberta was not hit by severe drought. The city was virtually debt-free and profited from its ownership of the local public utilities.\n\nGrowth returned to the city with the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Red Deer was chosen as the location of a large military training camp, the A-20 Camp which was located where Cormack Armoury, the Memorial Centre and Lindsay Thurber High School are now located. The [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] built two air bases to the south of the city at [[Penhold, Alberta|Penhold]] and [[Bowden, Alberta|Bowden]].\n\n=== Post Second World War ===\nOn January 1, 1948, the City of Red Deer amalgamated with the Village of [[North Red Deer, Alberta|North Red Deer]], located on the north bank of the Red Deer River.<ref name=Century>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/North+Red+Deer+A+Century+of+Change.htm | publisher=City of Red Deer | title=North Red Deer: A Century of Change | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928123524/http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/North+Red+Deer+A+Century+of+Change.htm | archive-date=2011-09-28 | |url-status=dead | df= }}</ref><ref name=Centennial>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/default.htm | publisher=City of Red Deer | title=2011 Village of North Red Deer Centennial Celebrations | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623224607/http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/default.htm | archive-date=2011-06-23 | |url-status=dead | df= }}</ref>\n\nBy roughly 1991, the Canadian Pacific Railway had been removed from the inner city; the track currently runs parallel to the city outskirts. The most prominent landmark of the railway remaining is the CPR bridge spanning the Red Deer River, converted to a walking trail shortly after the track removal.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe city is now a centre for [[petroleum extraction|oil]] and [[natural gas extraction]] and related industries and also for agriculture and agricultural services. It is a regional centre for administration with a courthouse and provincial building. It also has major stores in malls such as Bower Place, Southpointe Common, Parkland Mall and many other locations.\n\n== Geography ==\nRed Deer is located on the [[Red Deer River]], from which it derives its name.\n\n=== Climate ===\nRed Deer has a humid [[continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb: Warm summer subtype|Dfb]]''), with somewhat of a semi-arid influence.

It is located near the midpoint of the [[Calgary\u2013Edmonton Corridor]] and is surrounded by [[Red Deer County]]. It is Alberta's third most populous city{{cn|date=March 2020}} after [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and before [[Lethbridge]]. The city is located in [[aspen parkland]], a region of rolling hills that is home to oil, grain, and cattle production. It is a centre for oil and agriculture distribution, and the surrounding region is a major centre for petrochemical production. With a recorded population of 100,418 in the Canada [[2016 Canadian Census|2016 census]], Red Deer became the third Alberta city to surpass 100,000 people.<ref name=2016censusABmunis/>\n\n== History ==\nPrior to European settlement, the area was a gathering place that was inhabited by Aboriginal tribes including the [[Blackfoot]], Plains [[Cree]] and [[Stoney First Nation|Stoney]]. European fur traders began passing through the area in the late eighteenth century. Into this ethnic mix, the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] peoples also emerged.\n\nA [[First Nations|native trail]] ran from [[Montana]] in the south across the [[Bow River]] near Calgary and on to [[Fort Edmonton]]. About halfway between Calgary and Edmonton, the trail crossed the [[Red Deer River]] at a wide, stony shallow used by [[First Nations]] peoples and [[American bison|bison]], [[Bison vs Buffalo|commonly known as buffalo]], since ancient times. The shallows, now known as the Old Red Deer Crossing, are about {{convert|7|km}} upstream from the present City of Red Deer.\n\nWith the establishment of [[Fort Calgary]] by the [[North-West Mounted Police]] in 1875, traffic increased along what was by then known as the [[Calgary and Edmonton Trail]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albertatrailnet.com/downloads/December2002.pdf |format=PDF |title=Calgary and Edmonton Trail |author=Alberta Trail Net |date=December 2002 |accessdate=2009-09-14 ||url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705020554/http://www.albertatrailnet.com/downloads/December2002.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2008 }}</ref> After the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in Calgary, traffic along the \"C & E\" trail increased substantially. A [[trading post]] and [[stopping house]] were built at the Crossing in 1882 and a permanent settlement began to develop around it.\n\nDuring the 1885 [[North-West Rebellion|Riel Rebellion]] (also known as the [[North-West Rebellion]]), the [[Canadian militia]] constructed [[Fort Normandeau]] at the Crossing. The fort was later taken over by the North-West Mounted Police who used it until 1893.\n\nWith the decimation of the bison by hunters, the Aboriginal tribes who relied on them for food, clothing and shelter were also in decline. The fertile lands around the Red Deer River were attractive to farmers and ranchers. One early settler, the Reverend Leonard Gaetz, gave a half-share of {{convert|1240|acre|km2}} he had acquired to the [[Calgary and Edmonton Railway]] to develop a bridge over the river and a townsite. As a result, the Crossing was gradually abandoned. The first train from Calgary to Edmonton passed through Red Deer in 1891.\n\n=== Name origin ===\nThe [[Cree]] peoples called the river on which Red Deer stands {{transl|cr|Waskasoo Seepee}}, which translates to \"[[Elk]] River\". However, British traders translated the name as \"Red Deer River\", since they mistakenly thought elk were European [[red deer]]. Later, the settlers of the area named their community after the river.<ref name=history>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/Visitors/About+Red+Deer/History/default.htm | title=History of Red Deer | publisher=City of Red Deer | accessdate=November 15, 2013 | |url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204024702/http://www.reddeer.ca/Visitors/About+Red+Deer/History/default.htm | archivedate=December 4, 2013 | df= }}</ref> The name for the modern city in Plains Cree is a [[calque]] back from English of the mistranslated, {{transl|cr|mihkw\u00e2pisimosos}} literally \"red type of deer\" while the name of the river itself is still {{transl|cr|w\u00e2w\u00e2sk\u00easiw-s\u00eepiy}} or \"elk river\".<ref>http://www.creedictionary.com/search/?q=Red+Deer&scope=0</ref>\n\n=== Leonard Gaetz ===\n{{Main|Leonard Gaetz}}\n[[Leonard Gaetz]] acted as the local land agent for the Saskatchewan Colonization Company and purchased parts of three other sections from his employers. By 1890, the Gaetz family owned vast land holdings along the south bank of the Red Deer River around the mouth of the Waskasoo Creek. The holdings included parts of Sections 16, 17, 20 and 21. Leonard Gaetz's increasing wealth allowed his family to play a central role in the growth of Red Deer.\n\nIn 1895, Gaetz returned to the active ministry in Manitoba. Once again, this proved detrimental to his health. He retired back to Red Deer in 1901, and resided here for the remainder of his life. He was a strong promoter of the area, founding the Westerner showgrounds and annual \"Westerner Days\", akin to the Calgary Stampede. He died in Red Deer in 1907.\n\n=== 1900 to 1929 ===\nRed Deer saw a massive influx of settlers in the early 1900s.\n[[File:Michener Centre.jpg|thumbnail|Michener Centre]]\nIn 1901, when Red Deer was incorporated as a town, the population stood at 343. Through its location midway between Edmonton and Calgary and the fertile land that supported profitable mixed farming, Red Deer developed primarily as an agricultural service and distribution centre. A further boost came in 1907 when it was chosen as a major divisional point for the Canadian Pacific Railway. Two other railways, the [[Alberta Central Railway]] and the [[Canadian Northern Railway]], entered the community in 1911. Red Deer underwent a large land boom.\n\nOn March 25, 1913, Red Deer was incorporated as a city and the population had jumped to nearly 2,800.\n\n[[World War I]] brought a sharp end to the boom. Red Deer emerged as a small, quiet, but prosperous, prairie city. In 1922, the provincial institution for the care of the mentally handicapped, currently known as the Michener Centre, was established in the city. Prospects looked good for modest but sustainable growth.\n\n=== 1930 to 1945 ===\nThe [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s was a major setback for the city, though it fared better than some communities. Central Alberta was not hit by severe drought. The city was virtually debt-free and profited from its ownership of the local public utilities.\n\nGrowth returned to the city with the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Red Deer was chosen as the location of a large military training camp, the A-20 Camp which was located where Cormack Armoury, the Memorial Centre and Lindsay Thurber High School are now located. The [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] built two air bases to the south of the city at [[Penhold, Alberta|Penhold]] and [[Bowden, Alberta|Bowden]].\n\n=== Post Second World War ===\nOn January 1, 1948, the City of Red Deer amalgamated with the Village of [[North Red Deer, Alberta|North Red Deer]], located on the north bank of the Red Deer River.<ref name=Century>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/North+Red+Deer+A+Century+of+Change.htm | publisher=City of Red Deer | title=North Red Deer: A Century of Change | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928123524/http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/North+Red+Deer+A+Century+of+Change.htm | archive-date=2011-09-28 | |url-status=dead | df= }}</ref><ref name=Centennial>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/default.htm | publisher=City of Red Deer | title=2011 Village of North Red Deer Centennial Celebrations | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623224607/http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/default.htm | archive-date=2011-06-23 | |url-status=dead | df= }}</ref>\n\nBy roughly 1991, the Canadian Pacific Railway had been removed from the inner city; the track currently runs parallel to the city outskirts. The most prominent landmark of the railway remaining is the CPR bridge spanning the Red Deer River, converted to a walking trail shortly after the track removal.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe city is now a centre for [[petroleum extraction|oil]] and [[natural gas extraction]] and related industries and also for agriculture and agricultural services. It is a regional centre for administration with a courthouse and provincial building. It also has major stores in malls such as Bower Place, Southpointe Common, Parkland Mall and many other locations.\n\n== Geography ==\nRed Deer is located on the [[Red Deer River]] after which it was named.\n\n=== Climate ===\nRed Deer has a humid [[continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb: Warm summer subtype|Dfb]]''), with somewhat of a semi-arid influence. The highest temperature ever recorded in Red Deer was {{convert|37.2|C|0}} on 8 July 1906,<ref name=\"July 1906\"/> 2 July 1924,<ref name=\"July 1924\"/> and 28 & 29 June 1937.<ref name=\"June

However, in 2010, Omegle introduced a video mode to complement the text chat mode, which pairs together strangers who are using webcams and microphones. The [[video chat]] also has a built in text window.\n\nIn 2011, the beta version of a new feature, \"Spy Mode\", was introduced. In Spy (Question) Mode, users have two options: to be the \"spy\" and ask a question of two strangers, or to discuss a question with another stranger. As the spy, the user inputs any question for the two strangers to answer or discuss and is able to view the discussion as a third party, albeit without being able to contribute further to the conversation. The spy can quit at any time without ending the chat for the two other strangers. If a user chooses to discuss a question instead, as in normal text mode, the user is paired with another stranger and can discuss the question the spy has asked up until the point the other stranger decides to disconnect and/or move on to another question.\n\nIn 2012, Omegle added a special new feature to the text and video modes, the option to input \"interest\" tags. Adding interests lets users be paired with a stranger who has something in common with the user. A user can input as many interests as he or she would like, and if no available match is found, the user is paired with a completely random stranger instead.\n\nIn 2013, an unmonitored version of the video chat mode was opened, leaving the original content moderator-regulated video section open to anyone aged thirteen and up as long as the content of his or her video stream is clean. Initially, questionable adult content in the video section of Omegle was filtered using [[image recognition]] algorithms only.

However, in 2010, Omegle introduced a video mode to complement the text chat mode, which pairs together strangers who are using webcams and microphones. The [[video chat]] also has a built in text window.\n\nIn 2011, the beta version of a new feature, \"Spy Mode\", was introduced. In Spy (Question) Mode, users have two options: to be the \"spy\" and ask a question of two strangers, or to discuss a question with another stranger. As the spy, the user inputs any question for the two strangers to answer or discuss and is able to view the discussion as a third party, albeit without being able to contribute further to the conversation. The spy can quit at any time without ending the chat for the two other strangers. If a user chooses to discuss a question instead, as in normal text mode, the user is paired with another stranger and can discuss the question the spy has asked up until the point the other stranger decides to disconnect and/or move on to another question.\n\nIn 2012, Omegle added a special new feature to the text and video modes, the option to input \"interest\" tags. Adding interests lets users be paired with a stranger who has something in common with the user. A user can input as many interests as he or she would like, and if no available match is found, the user is paired with a completely random stranger instead.\n\nIn 2013, an unmonitored version of the video chat mode was opened, leaving the original content moderator-regulated video section open to anyone aged thirteen and up as long as the content of his or her video stream is clean. Initially, questionable adult content in the video section of Omegle was filtered using [[image recognition]] algorithms only. The newer unmonitored video section allows consenting adults over the age of eighteen the freedom to view, and share with one another, uncensored explicit video streams.\n\nIn 2014, Omegle began experimenting with a \"[[Dormitory|Dorm]] Chat\" mode, which requires users to provide an [[email address]] ending in \"[[.edu]]\" to verify that they are associated with a [[college]] or [[university]]. Dorm Chat allows users to chat with their classmates and colleagues on Omegle.\n\nIn 2015, Omegle began implementing [[ReCAPTCHA|ReCaptcha]] security measures to help reduce the amount of [[Internet bot|bots]] on the site.

On arrival, she becomes frightened by a spooked steer, and is \"rescued\" by the Virginian ([[Joel McCrea]]), only to discover the animal is so mild, it is a little girl's pet. As a result, she takes a strong dislike to the cowboy. He, on the other hand, is smitten with her. When Trampas ([[Brian Donlevy]]) voices his scurrilous speculation as to why she came west, the Virginian confronts him and forces him, at gunpoint, to take it back. \n \nMr. and Mrs. Taylor ([[Henry O'Neill]] and [[Fay Bainter]]) put Molly up in their old home. The Virginian starts courting her, much against her will initially. Steve Andrews ([[Sonny Tufts]]), a friend the Virginian has not seen in three years, is also interested in her. Eventually, she warms to the Virginian, but her feelings for him are not as strong and certain as his are for her.\n\nMeanwhile, families are being driven away by the depredations of cattle rustlers. The Virginian suspects Trampas is the ringleader, but has no proof. When he sees Steve becoming friendly to Trampas, he warns his easygoing friend to keep better company. When he catches Steve with one of Judge Henry's calves, applying Trampas's brand on the pretext of branding a \"stray,\" the Virginian warns Steve to choose wisely what course he wants his life to take because he will not cover up any rustling activities.\n\nBefore setting out on a long cattle drive, the Virginian tells Molly she will have to decide by the time he returns whether they have a future together. On the trail, Trampas and his men start a stampede, using the distraction to steal a couple of hundred animals. Afterward, the Virginian fears that Steve has been killed, but he in fact is working with Trampas.\n\nJudge Henry (an uncredited [[Minor Watson]]), whose cattle were taken, persuades the Virginian to lead a posse. When they find the rustlers, one is killed when he tries to draw his gun, and two others surrender. The Virginian catches Steve as he is sneaking away; Steve says no one would know if his friend were to let him go, but the Virginian takes him back to join the others. Trampas, however, gets away. The next day, the three rustlers are lynched.\n\nWhen the Virginian goes after Trampas, he is shot in the back. Molly tends him during the months of recovery. However, when she learns that he had to hang his own friend, she decides to return east. Andy (an uncredited [[James Burke (actor)|James Burke]]), the stagecoach driver, makes her see that she is in love with the Virginian. She finally agrees to marry the cowboy.\n\nJust before their wedding, Trampas shows up to settle matters with the Virginian, telling him to leave town by sundown or else. Molly pleads with her fiance to do just that, but the Virginian has no choice. He arms himself with the revolver Steve had left him, and the two men stalk each other. Trampas spots the Virginian first, and is about to ambush him, when he startles a horse. Warned, the Virginian manages to kill Trampas. The Virginian and Molly then ride off into the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Joel McCrea]] as the Virginian\n*[[Brian Donlevy]] as Trampas\n*[[Sonny Tufts]] as Steve Andrews\n*[[Barbara Britton]] as Molly Wood\n*[[Fay Bainter]] as Mrs. Taylor\n*[[Tom Tully]] as Nebraska\n*[[Henry O'Neill]] as Mr. Taylor\n*[[Bill Edwards (actor)|Bill Edwards]] as Sam Bennett\n*[[William Frawley]] as Honey Wiggen\n*[[Paul Guilfoyle (actor born in 1902)|Paul Guilfoyle]] as Shorty, one of the hanged rustlers\n*[[Marc Lawrence]] as Pete\n*[[Vince Barnett]] as Baldy<ref name=\"imdbcast\">{{cite web|title=Full cast and crew for The Virginian |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039082/fullcredits#cast |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref>\n*[[Teddy Infuhr]] as Christopher<ref name=\"imdbcast\"/>\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nThe basic plot elements of the film were inspired by the 1892 [[Johnson County War]] in [[Wyoming]], the archetypal cattlemen-homesteaders conflict, which also served as the background for ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' and ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/lifetimesofweste0000hyam/page/115|last=Hyams|first=Jay|title=The Life and Times of the Western Movie|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster#Imprints|Gallery Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=1984|isbn=978-0831755454|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lifetimesofweste0000hyam/page/115 115\u2013116]|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n===Filming locations===\n* Andy Jauregui Ranch, Placerita Canyon Road, Newhall, California, USA \n* [[Kernville, California]], USA \n* Monogram Ranch, 24715 Oak Creek Avenue, Newhall, California, USA \n* Paramount Ranch, 2813 Cornell Road, Agoura, California, USA<ref name=\"imdblocations\">{{cite web|title=Locations for The Virginian |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039082/locations |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|The Virginian (1946 film)}}\n*{{IMDb title|0039082|The Virginian}}\n*{{tcmdb title|94860|The Virginian}}\n*{{amg title|115670|The Virginian}}\n\n{{The Virginian}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Virginian, The (1946 film)}}\n[[Category:1946 films]]\n[[Category:1940s Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on Western (genre) novels]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Films set in Wyoming]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films based on adaptations]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Howard Estabrook]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Daniele Amfitheatrof]]\n[[Category:American Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film\n| name           = The Virginian\n| image          = The Virginian 1946 poster.jpg\n| caption        = Theatrical release poster\n| director       = [[Stuart Gilmore]]\n| producer       = [[Paul Jones (film producer)|Paul Jones]]\n| writer         = [[Howard Estabrook]]\n| screenplay     = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Frances Goodrich]]\n* [[Albert Hackett]]\n}}\n| based on       = {{based on|''[[The Virginian (novel)|The Virginian]]''|[[Owen Wister]]}}\n| narrator       =\n| starring       = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Joel McCrea]]\n* [[Brian Donlevy]]\n* [[Sonny Tufts]]\n* [[Barbara Britton]]\n}}\n| music          = [[Daniele Amfitheatrof]]\n| cinematography = [[Harry Hallenberger]]\n| editing        = Everett Douglas\n| studio        = Paramount Pictures \n| distributor    = [[Paramount Pictures]]\n| released       = {{Film date|1946|4|17|New York City|1946|5|5|U.S.}}\n| runtime        = 87 minutes\n| country        = United States\n| language       = English \n| budget         =\n| gross          = $3,350,000 (US rentals)<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/variety165-1947-01#page/n54/mode/1up \"60 Top Grossers of 1946\", ''Variety'' 8 January 1947 p8]</ref>\n}}\n'''''The Virginian''''' is a 1946 American [[Western (genre)|Western]] film directed by [[Stuart Gilmore]] and starring [[Joel McCrea]], [[Brian Donlevy]], [[Sonny Tufts]], and [[Barbara Britton]].

The Virginian and Molly then ride off into the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Joel McCrea]] as the Virginian\n*[[Brian Donlevy]] as Trampas\n*[[Sonny Tufts]] as Steve Andrews\n*[[Barbara Britton]] as Molly Wood\n*[[Fay Bainter]] as Mrs. Taylor\n*[[Tom Tully]] as Nebraska\n*[[Henry O'Neill]] as Mr. Taylor\n*[[Bill Edwards (actor)|Bill Edwards]] as Sam Bennett\n*[[William Frawley]] as Honey Wiggen\n*[[Paul Guilfoyle (actor born in 1902)|Paul Guilfoyle]] as Shorty, one of the hanged rustlers\n*[[Marc Lawrence]] as Pete\n*[[Vince Barnett]] as Baldy<ref name=\"imdbcast\">{{cite web|title=Full cast and crew for The Virginian |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039082/fullcredits#cast |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref>\n*[[Teddy Infuhr]] as Christopher<ref name=\"imdbcast\"/>\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nThe basic plot elements of the film were inspired by the 1892 [[Johnson County War]] in [[Wyoming]], the archetypal cattlemen-homesteaders conflict, which also served as the background for ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' and ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/lifetimesofweste0000hyam/page/115|last=Hyams|first=Jay|title=The Life and Times of the Western Movie|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster#Imprints|Gallery Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=1984|isbn=978-0831755454|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lifetimesofweste0000hyam/page/115 115\u2013116]|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n===Filming locations===\n* Andy Jauregui Ranch, Placerita Canyon Road, Newhall, California, USA \n* [[Kernville, California]], USA \n* Monogram Ranch, 24715 Oak Creek Avenue, Newhall, California, USA \n* Paramount Ranch, 2813 Cornell Road, Agoura, California, USA<ref name=\"imdblocations\">{{cite web|title=Locations for The Virginian |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039082/locations |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|The Virginian (1946 film)}}\n*{{IMDb title|0039082|The Virginian}}\n*{{tcmdb title|94860|The Virginian}}\n*{{amg title|115670|The Virginian}}\n\n{{The Virginian}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Virginian, The (1946 film)}}\n[[Category:1946 films]]\n[[Category:1940s Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on Western (genre) novels]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Films set in Wyoming]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films based on adaptations]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Howard Estabrook]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Daniele Amfitheatrof]]\n[[Category:American Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n", "name_user": "Lord Cornwallis", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virginian_(1946_film)"}
