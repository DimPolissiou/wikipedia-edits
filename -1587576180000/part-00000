Tilly discovers the truth about the baby lie and tries to stop it, but Sienna is soon exposed and Chloe is left with the task of finding new parents for her unborn child.\n\nWhen Esther discovers the kiss, Chloe pretends that she instigated it. Tilly agrees to let Chloe continue living with her. [[Carmel McQueen|Carmel Valentine]] ([[Gemma Merna]]) later approaches Chloe with the idea of buying her baby.

He agrees, but she reveals that she is \u00a35000 in debt and needs to raise the money. When John Paul refuses to help, she announces that she will take Matthew away if he does not pay up. He agrees and begins to attempt to find the money. John Paul discovers that he is actually Matthew's father instead of his former boyfriend [[Craig Dean|Craig]] ([[Guy Burnet]]) and he confronts Chloe. She apologises for lying and admits she just needed the money and leaves.\n\nChloe soon returns to the village requesting an additional loan from John Paul, and reveals that she is acting as a surrogate mother for another couple. [[Sienna Blake]] ([[Anna Passey]]) overhears the conversation and befriends Chloe.

When Chloe returns she is accused of stealing the funds raised by the Osbornes to help to search for missing [[Tom Cunningham]] ([[Ellis Hollins]]). She moves into the student house with [[Tilly Evans]] ([[Lucy Dixon]]), who believes Chloe is attracted to her girlfriend Esther. She annoys her housemates by eating all their food and messing up the kitchen cupboards. Chloe stages a protest to free Vincent, and Tilly believes she is trying to impress Ether. Tilly confronts Chloe, who then confesses her attraction to Tilly, resulting in a kiss. Chloe faints and is rushed to hospital where she and Tilly kiss again, only for Sienna to walk in on them. Chloe momentarily considers keeping the baby but tells Sienna she can still have the baby. Tilly discovers the truth about the baby lie and tries to stop it, but Sienna is soon exposed and Chloe is left with the task of finding new parents for her unborn child.\n\nWhen Esther discovers the kiss, Chloe pretends that she instigated it. Tilly agrees to let Chloe continue living with her. [[Carmel McQueen|Carmel Valentine]] ([[Gemma Merna]]) later approaches Chloe with the idea of buying her baby.

She made her first appearance on 24 November 2008. The character was introduced as an extension of already established [[McQueen family]] and quickly became a fan favourite for her cute, bubbly personality and dark storylines. During her first five years on the show, Porter was featured in numerous high-profile storylines, including: underage sex; the murder of [[Calvin Valentine]] ([[Ricky Whittle]]); teenage pregnancy; being the target of serial killer [[Silas Blissett]] ([[Jeff Rawle]]); falling down a lift shaft; discovering her boyfriend, [[Ethan Scott]] ([[Craig Vye]]) was dating two other women<!--Liberty and Rae!--> and forming a friendship with the girls; finding her long-lost father; relationships with [[Dodger Savage]] ([[Danny Mac]]), [[Will Savage]] ([[James Atherton]]) and [[Joel Dexter]] (Andrew Still); and her arrest for Calvin's murder. Porter announced her departure from the soap in October 2013 so she could focus on ''[[Dancing on Ice]]''. Her exit scenes aired on 9 January 2014.\n\nIt was announced in April 2014, four months after her exit scenes aired, that Porter would be returning to the serial as Theresa, with her return scenes airing on 25 August 2014.<ref name=2014return/> Theresa's storylines since her return have included: a breakout from prison; giving birth to her second child, this time with Dodger and her subsequent on-off relationship with him; a feud with [[Sonny Valentine]] (Aaron Fontaine); being involved in a train crash which saw Calvin's wife and her cousin, [[Carmel McQueen|Carmel]] ([[Gemma Merna]]) save Theresa and die; being kidnapped by Will; agreeing to donate a kidney to [[Nico Blake]] ([[Persephone Swales-Dawson]]); a relationship with [[Patrick Blake (Hollyoaks)|Patrick Blake]] ([[Jeremy Sheffield]]) which saw her care for him as he suffered from [[motor neurone disease]]; and being targeted by Nico as she plotted to kill her for her other kidney. It was revealed that Porter had chosen to leave the soap again to pursue a career in [[Hollywood]]. Porter agreed to reprise the role in 2020.\n\n==Casting==\nThe character was announced in early November 2008.<ref name=\"ds\">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a134631/new-mcqueen-cast-in-hollyoaks.html|title=New McQueen cast in Hollyoaks|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |first=Kris|last=Green|date=5 November 2008|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref> 20-year-old actress [[Jorgie Porter]] was cast as [[Myra McQueen]]'s ([[Nicole Barber-Lane]]) 15-year-old niece, Theresa. She was described as a \"teen temptress\" and \"[[Lolita (term)|lolita type]]\". Porter, speaking of her new role, said: \"I'm thrilled to be joining not just ''Hollyoaks'' but one of soap's most notorious families. Although she's feisty with outsiders, Theresa's ranking within the family is low so she's eager to impress. I can\u2019t wait to see how Theresa earns her stripes as part of the McQueen clan!\" Due to the departures of [[Tina McQueen]] ([[Leah Hackett]]) and [[John Paul McQueen]] ([[James Sutton (actor)|James Sutton]]) earlier in 2008, ''Hollyoaks'' producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] added a new member to the McQueen family. Theresa was mentioned earlier before her entrance to the soap on-screen during a conversation between Myra and [[Nana McQueen]] ([[Diane Langton]]), her mother [[Kathleen McQueen]] (Alison Burrows) was also mentioned when it was revealed she was in prison.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Characterisation===\nThe character of Theresa was first described as \"A 'teen temptress' and '[[Lolita]] type' who has a distinct lack of [[self-awareness]]. Her vulnerability is her status within her family and she is alert to the fact that she has a long way to go before she becomes a real member of the McQueens.\" Also her keen love of men was noted.<ref name=\"ds\"/> In 2010, Porter commented on the character, saying: \"She's got load of attitude, but she's got a good heart, too.

You saw her vulnerable when her mum left but this is a total helplessness, she just doesn't know what to do.\"<ref name=\"porter\"/>\n\nWhittle, who portrayed Calvin, told [[Inside Soap]] that he was \"very surprised\" when he learnt the identity of the killer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a217328/whittle-oaks-killer-reveal-shocked-me.html |title=Whittle: 'Oaks killer reveal shocked me' |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=29 April 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> He later admitted he wanted a different killer. He stated: \"My opinion was it would have been someone else. If I was going to pick a killer for Calvin I don't think anyone had a strong enough motive apart from Mercedes ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]), Malachy and Spencer. Obviously, with Malachy, I was sleeping with his wife.

Sexual tension mounts between the pair and ultimately spend the night together, with Tony unaware that she is only fifteen. Theresa falls in love with Tony, who realises her deception, and destroys any chances of a future with him. A dejected Theresa turns to her family, the McQueens. [[Jacqui McQueen]] ([[Claire Cooper]]), who is still infuriated with Tony for his fling with her sister [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]), is angered with Tony for his night with Theresa. She immediately calls the police, who charge him. Theresa then moves in with the McQueens, sharing a room with cousin [[Michaela McQueen]] ([[Hollie-Jay Bowes]]), whom she previously had turned to for advice. Jacqui is not pleased at Theresa moving in but soon warms. Theresa then tells the police she was deceptive about spending the night with Tony, who is released. Theresa finds an unlikely friendship in [[Anita Roy]] ([[Saira Choudhry]]) and auditions for the part of [[The Virgin Mary]] in a nativity play produced by older cousin [[Carmel McQueen|Carmel Valentine]] ([[Gemma Merna]]) and [[Cindy Cunningham]] ([[Stephanie Waring]]). However, she is heckled off the stage by some teenagers, who clearly know she is not a virgin. On Christmas Day, Anita finds a DVD containing CCTV footage of [[Warren Fox]] ([[Jamie Lomas]]) sleeping with [[Mandy Richardson]] ([[Sarah Jayne Dunn]]) and gives it to the McQueens, who set off to ruin Warren's wedding to [[Louise Summers]] ([[Roxanne McKee]]).

When Lauren makes a comment about the McQueens, Theresa reminds her that Carmel is married to Lauren's brother Calvin. Theresa follows her family by using a fake pregnancy bump to shoplift. Having a proper relationship with [[Ste Hay]] ([[Kieron Richardson]]), Theresa is dumped by him, who wants to focus on son [[Lucas Hay]] (Jude).\n\nAfter the McQueens home becomes infested with rats, Theresa and Carmel move in with Anita and her family.

She starts using Theresa's picture to speak to a boy named [[Ricky Campbell]] ([[Ashley Margolis]]) on the internet. Theresa finds out about Anita using her picture and is angry. Anita uses Theresa's jacket and smashes a window in the school. Anita's father [[Govinda Roy]] (Anthony Bunsee) tells Myra, Carmel and Theresa to leave, believing it was Theresa. After Anita admits the truth, her mother [[Bel Roy]] (Nila Aalia) begs Myra, Carmel and Theresa to stay, and tells them that Anita had poured bleach over her legs to change her ethnicity. Theresa feels guilty for not helping Anita and she apologises before reassuring her that she does not need to change her appearance. After a game of 'truth or dare', Theresa has to kiss [[Newt (Hollyoaks)|Newt]] ([[Nico Mirallegro]]). They eventually get together, which is revealed by Anita's partner Ricky, causing Lauren to be extremely jealous. Theresa follows her wish and becomes a model for a project by [[Zoe Carpenter]] ([[Zo\u00eb Lister]]), for \"Buff TV\" while Newt breaks up with her, not a fan of her future career. Theresa is then disgusted when he starts dating Anita, so she slaps her and stops speaking to both of them. Carmel is also shocked with the modelling, and cannot believe that Zoe is using a sixteen-year-old. Due to this, Theresa is spotted and discovered by a modelling agency in [[London]].

Several days later, Kathleen arrives in Hollyoaks and asks Myra for money, which Theresa's father left for her. Myra refuses and tells her to leave before Theresa finds her. Later, Theresa meets Kathleen just as she is leaving the village. Kathleen, not wanting to disappoint her daughter, claims she has come to stay. Kathleen gives Theresa expensive gifts like a gold charm bracelet. Theresa accepts it, desperate to believe her mother has changed. Kathleen then encourages Theresa to shoplift, which causes more tension between Kathleen and the rest of the McQueens. Kathleen also tells Theresa that they should run away together to London, to which Theresa agrees and says goodbye to Anita, while the rest of the McQueens are out. However, when saying goodbye, Theresa finds her mother's purse which contains a credit card in the name of her dead cousin Tina and is horrified. Myra and Jacqui find out Kathleen and Theresa's plan to run away and tries to stop Theresa from going, to which she agrees. Kathleen then leaves, which leads to Theresa holding a grudge against Jacqui.\n\nCarmel's fianc\u00e9, [[Calvin Valentine]] ([[Ricky Whittle]]), and Theresa spend time together in the Loft.

At Calvin and Carmel's second wedding, Theresa admits to Calvin that she is pregnant. Calvin tells her he wants her to have an abortion, which shocks Theresa. He then lies to Carmel about the paternity after she finds out about Theresa's pregnancy. Feeling emotional and rejected, Theresa sees a gun in Jacqui's bag at the wedding reception and snatches it. She shoots Calvin and he dies in Carmel's arms. Mercedes and Jacqui quickly flee the scene with Theresa to protect her. Jacqui is then told that Calvin's passionate rendezvous with Theresa has caused her to fall pregnant. Jacqui stands by Theresa and hides the gun, before lying to police when they are questioned. Theresa decides to run away with Kyle, still in shock at killing Calvin. However, Kyle treats his pregnant girlfriend curtly, and introduces her to his new girlfriend, Stacey. Theresa returns home to the McQueen's. Jacqui tries to force Theresa into terminating the pregnancy, but Carmel convinces her to keep the baby. Jacqui plants the gun used to kill Calvin on racist Gaz, who is caught holding Anita hostage and arrested for killing Calvin. Theresa is unwilling to let Gaz go to prison for Calvin's murder, however is convinced to stay quiet. Myra discovers Theresa is pregnant and eventually uncovers the truth about Calvin's death.

Later, Theresa talks to Heidi's cousin [[Mitzeee Minniver|Mitzeee]] ([[Rachel Shenton]]), who on purpose does not switch her headset off. Mitzeee then reveals to Theresa, and everyone at the fashion show, that she was involved in an affair with Heidi's husband [[Carl Costello]] ([[Paul Opacic]]) before arriving in the Village. [[Seth Costello]] ([[Miles Higson]] is angered by Theresa and Michaela's gossiping.

Theresa meets [[Logan Fairhurst]] (Thomas Sean Hughes), and an attraction grows. Theresa almost admits to killing Calvin, but stops when Logan tells her he is a police officer. After being attacked by Mitzeee, Theresa goes into labour and gives birth to a daughter. Carmel tells Theresa that she meant what she said, and will take her to the police for Calvin's murder. Theresa dumps Logan after being influenced by her family that it's for the best. Jacqui manages to convinces Carmel the baby will go into care even though that would be far more appropriate.

When Carmel arranges to christen the baby \"Angel\" without Theresa's consent, Kathleen is furious and brings her priest boyfriend round to conduct her granddaughter's christening in secret, and the baby is christened as \"Kathleen Khloe Angel McQueen\". After the christening, Mercedes reminds Carmel that if she doesn't want to go to jail, then she will comply with her demands. Heeding her sister's warning to save herself from going to prison, Carmel agrees to let Theresa keep her daughter.\n\nTheresa hears rumours that Kyle is back in the village, and decides it is best for everyone if she leaves. As she is leaving, Kyle kidnaps Theresa and baby Kathleen-Angel, and takes them to an abandoned bank. He threatens to kill her but Theresa escapes and calls Warren, Carmel and Ethan. They arrive and they try to reason with Kyle, but a fight ensues and Ethan is thrown down a lift shaft and Kyle is shot and killed by Warren.

While trying to comfort her, Theresa recounts that she had chlamydia around the time they were both sleeping with Calvin, leading to Carmel realising that she has unknowingly had it ever since. As a result of her missed diagnosis, Carmel learns that she is unlikely to ever conceive a child, resulting in her obsessing over Kathleen-Angel, and Theresa's poor parenting skills. On Christmas Eve, Theresa comes home with an expensive dollhouse for her daughter, despite previously mentioning that she had no money and when Carmel discovers her credit card missing, she later finds out that it was Theresa who had taken it, causing a feud to break out between the cousins. Carmel soon discovers that Theresa had been sending malicious messages to Dodger from a e-mail account belonging to Texas, and she tells Dodger causing him to split up with Theresa. Carmel is also arrested after the police accuse her of shoplifting a dollhouse, though in reality it was Theresa, leading to her feeling her chances of adopting a child were over. In a bid to get revenge on Carmel for facilitating her break-up with Dodger, Theresa climbs into bed with a drunk Jim and claims they had sex, though Nana soon uncovers the truth.\n\nFurious at Theresa's behaviour and neglect of Kathleen-Angel, Carmel hatches a plan and calls Sonny Valentine (now played by Aaron Fontaine) and introduces him to Kathleen-Angel. Carmel desperately tries to convince him to help him get Kathleen away from Theresa, and when Sonny refuses, Carmel blurts out that Theresa killed Calvin. Carmel soon regrets this and is horrified to discover that Sonny has joined the police force since leaving the village. Sonny confronts Theresa on the street, causing her to panic that she is about to be arrested, so Mercedes and Nana hatch a plot for Theresa to leave the country, and she reluctantly agrees to leave Kathleen-Angel with Carmel for the time being. Theresa and Mercedes head to the airport, but when Carmel finds that Kathleen is missing, she instantly thinks that Theresa has taken her on the run and quickly informs the police of Theresa's plan. Theresa is found at the airport, where she tries to evade the police but is soon caught. Carmel soon arrives at the airport, believing Theresa has taken Kathleen-Angel with her. However, Sonny shows up and reveals he took Kathleen-Angel. Theresa is then arrested. Sonny pressures Theresa during the interview and, despite Jim telling her not to say anything, she confesses to killing Calvin. Theresa is charged and Sonny allows Carmel to speak to her. Theresa asks Carmel to look after Kathleen-Angel and tell her she loves her.\n\nOn 25 August 2014, Theresa returns and seeks Mercedes' help with escaping from prison as she is pregnant with a second child and decides to flee to Alicante. She then rings Kathleen to see what Sonny is up to. Theresa manages to get herself admitted to hospital, with Mercedes pretending to be a doctor, and they both handcuff the prison officer to the bed and escape. When outside, Sonny is waiting for her and goes to re-arrest her but he is hit over the head by Myra which sets her free. Once back at Browning's flat, Theresa and Carmel each try to get Kathleen Angel to stay with them, and Theresa decides not to persuade her as she might get upset. Sonny then enters and Kathleen-Angel runs towards him and handcuffs Theresa to the radiator. Theresa calls Kathleen again and Kathleen tells her that she is in Spain. It is then revealed that Kathleen is in fact in hospital after being beaten by Sonny. Theresa is then found by the police and is again arrested.\n\nTheresa returns to the village after evidence is found Sonny tricked Carmel into making a statement against her, she immediately goes into labour where she gives birth to Dodger's baby girl, naming her newborn Myra-Pocahontas Regina Madonna Savage-McQueen. Sonny pays [[Phoebe McQueen]] ([[Mandip Gill]]) to sabotage Theresa, but Theresa believes it is [[Sienna Blake]] ([[Anna Passey]]) - who has taken an interest in Myra-Pocahontas. Phoebe reveals this to Carmel, who drives out into the woods with a doll in the back, and Sonny follows her. Sonny then kidnaps Carmel, but she returns to the village, making her family believe she escaped. Carmel is actually working with Sonny to take Kathleen-Angel, and plans to abduct her on their cousin [[Porsche McQueen]]'s ([[Twinnie Lee Moore]]) wedding day, but she later backs out of the plan. At the reception, which takes place on a party train, Theresa discovers Kathleen-Angel's passport in Carmel's bag and is shocked. She and the rest of the McQueens disown Carmel, before Sonny sneaks onto the train using Carmel's invitation which she discarded. He attacks Theresa and attempts to throw her off the train, but at the same time, the train smashes into Sienna's car, which is on the tracks, and derails. Theresa wakes up and attempts to escape Sonny, but he holds her captive. Camel re-enters the wreckage and fools Sonny into letting Theresa go, but not before propane gas tanks are opened in the scuffle. As Theresa escapes the train, flames react with the gas and the wreckage explodes, instantly killing Sonny. Theresa rushes into the wreckage to find Carmel and locates her near death, and the pair apologize to each other and make up over their horrible history together. As the rest of the McQueens enter, Carmel peacefully passes away and Theresa retrieves her rosary beads from the wreckage. Theresa then finds [[Maxine Minniver]] ([[Nikki Sanderson]]) near death after giving birth, and calls an ambulance. As she heads to the hospital, Theresa offers to be a donor for Sienna and Dodger's daughter, [[Nico Blake]] ([[Persephone Swales-Dawson]]), who requires a kidney transplant, and learns she's a match.\n\nTheresa clashes with Mercedes, who attempts to encourage the McQueens to disown Theresa after ruining Carmel's life more than once. When the McQueens refuse to do that, Mercedes tells the McQueens is her or Theresa. The McQueens choose Theresa, and throw Mercedes out of the house. Mercedes is then stabbed and is nowhere to be found and Theresa suspects that she might have flown to Alicante already to live with Jacqui. It is then revealed from the police that Mercedes has been murdered which devastates the McQueen's. Later that month Theresa decides to give Nico a transplant after she is in need of one due to being born with one which was not functioning. Her cousin Porsche finds out what she was going to do and tries to persuade her not to reminding her of what she had promised Carmel which was to be a good mother and pointed out that she couldn't do that if she wasn't there which changes her mind for a short time but she goes through with the operation anyway. When Theresa donates her kidney to Nico, she is injected with morphine by Sienna and is nearly killed. She is then upset as Dodger is nowhere to be found as he has been taken hostage by Sienna. She and Maxine decide to find Dodger as they discover that Sienna is constantly visiting Anna's house and they suspect Dodger is there. Theresa breaks into the house and discovers Dodger in the basement. Theresa attacks Sienna and calls the police. Sienna then makes an escape and flees to a mental hospital. Theresa then discovers that Maxine did not attend with her but she had been taken hostage by [[Patrick Blake (Hollyoaks)|Patrick Blake]] ([[Jeremy Sheffield]]).\n\nIn January 2015, Maxine and Theresa are taken hostage by Will. Will ties them up under Dodger\u2019s boat and sets it on fire. Dodger saves Maxine and promises to come back for Theresa. Theresa is forced to rescue her herself and is hurt that Dodger saved Maxine instead of her. Theresa tells Dodger that Myra-Pocahontas is not his which upsets Dodger. Myra then tells Theresa to go after him and tell him that she lied. Theresa runs after Dodger to tell him that she loves him and that Myra-Pocahontas is his but is devastated to learn that Dodger has left the village. Theresa applies as a shop assistant and is employed by [[Simone Loveday]] ([[Jacqueline Boatswain]]). She then rants about Simone behind her back with Cindy. Simone is in the shop at the time and fires Theresa. She then applies to be a school secretary and is rejected by Patrick as she is wearing inappropriate clothing for the job. She then confronts Patrick and is then given the job but only as a trial. Patrick is impressed with her work and is appointed as a full-time secretary. Patrick then instructs Theresa to sabotage Maxine's friendship with Darren in order to get custody of Minnie. She goes on several dates with him but Darren discovers that she is working for Patrick. She then goes out to the club with Porsche and Maxine but Minnie is left at home alone and social services take Minnie into emergency custody which upsets Maxine and Patrick suspects that Theresa left her alone and thanks her. It is then revealed that Darren left her there by accident and Maxine gets full-custody of Minnie and Patrick instructs Theresa to get Minnie away from Maxine for good. Theresa and Patrick then talk and Theresa tells him that he is a better man than he was before. Theresa and Patrick then kiss. Theresa suspects that Patrick wants a relationship but he rejects her advances and it was a mistake. Theresa then discovers that Nico has started her period and she is not pregnant. Theresa accepts to keep Nico's secret but informs her that her mother faked a pregnancy and it didn't end well. Nico then tells Theresa to tell Patrick that she has lost the baby. Theresa then tells Patrick that Nico had a miscarriage and tells Patrick to ring her if he needs support.\n\nSienna Blake returns to the village after being released from a mental hospital and becomes suspicious of Theresa's intentions after catching her using Patrick's credit card in the village. After discovering Theresa is supporting Patrick, who has [[motor neurone disease]], she becomes jealous as she wants to support her father. She then attempts to set Theresa up by transferring her father's money into Theresa's account to make her look like a gold-digger. Patrick fires Theresa and she flees to Spain with her kids terrified of going back to prison but returns a few weeks later and restarts her relationship with Patrick after he discovers what Sienna did. After Patrick's car is stolen where he hid the gun that shot Phoebe, he convinces Theresa to go on holiday with him. Theresa accepts and returns a few weeks later for Phoebe's funeral. After a jealous Sienna gets Patrick's insurance company to cancel his life assurance after discovering he was planning to leave his money all to Theresa he then tells her he wouldn't blame her if she wants to leave. Theresa however is furious that he thinks she would be so shallow and tells him she's looking after him because she loves him.\n\nWhen Patrick becomes depressed as Maxine would be supporting Minnie and he doesn't have anything to give her, Theresa suggests conning the school. Patrick initially rejects but then accepts the idea, eventually leading to them getting a grant to build a special needs unit at the school. Theresa is devastated when she finds out that Patrick still loves Maxine so she throws her smoothie over him and demands half the scam money when its done. Patrick later has a change of heart over the scam and tells Theresa that its off, so on the advice of Ashley who was her former cellmate tries to reveal the scam but Patrick tricks her.\n\nIn March 2016, when Nico is told she will need another kidney transplant, she decides to kill Theresa for her last kidney. Theresa babysits Nico and while she is running a bath, Nico stands menacingly behind and contemplates drowning her but fails. She spikes a bottle of wine but when Theresa throws her a two person party, she has a change of heart. However, Theresa drinks the wine and collapses. Fortunately Sienna arrives just in time and she is taken to hospital. Theresa plans to leave the Village but Myra tries to change her mind. After an emotional heart to heart with Myra, she  decides to leave Theresa go. She says goodbye to Myra, John Paul and Myra\u2019s boyfriend [[Diego Salvador Martinez Hernandez De La Cruz]] (Juan Pablo Yepez). Theresa feels like she has forgotten something but shakes it off. As the taxi leaves, Myra sees that she has forgotten her daughter Myra-Pocohontas.\n\n==Reception==\nJorgie Porter made the [[British Soap Awards]] shortlist in 2009 and was nominated for 'Best Newcomer' for her portrayal of Theresa.<ref>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Kris|title=British Soap Awards 2009: Full Panel Shortlist|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/scoop/a154686/british-soap-awards-2009-full-panel-shortlist.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=2010-10-08|date=6 May 2009}}</ref> At the 2010 awards, Porter was nominated for 'Sexiest Female' and 'Best Actress'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/news/a217728/british-soap-awards-2010-the-winners.html |title=British Soap Awards 2010: The Winners |author=Kris Green and Daniel Kilkelly |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |date=9 May 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> Porter was nominated in the categories of \"Best Actress\" and \"Sexiest Female\" at the 2011 awards.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/scoop/a307476/british-soap-awards-2011-voting-opens.html|title=British Soap Awards 2011 voting opens|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=7 March 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=2011-03-07<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x0jSLWib|archivedate=7 March 2011 -->}}</ref> She has also been nominated for the award of 'Best Serial Drama Performance' at the 2011 [[National Television Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a277960/national-television-awards-2011-nominees.html |title=National Television Awards 2011 Nominees |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Catriona |last=Wightman |date=21 September 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> At the 2012 British Soap awards, she was nominated for 'Sexiest Female'.<ref>{{cite web|title=British Soap Awards 2012 - winners in full| url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/news/a378918/british-soap-awards-2012-winners-in-full.html|accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.e4.com/hollyoaks/cast/girls/theresamcqueen.html Character profile] on the [http://www.e4.com/hollyoaks/index.html E4 website]\n\n{{Hollyoaks}}\n{{Hollyoaks characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McQueen, Theresa}}\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2008]]\n[[Category:Fictional prison escapees]]\n[[Category:Fictional models]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Hollyoaks characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas]]\n[[Category:McQueen family]]\n[[Category:Fictional prisoners and detainees]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox soap character\n| series         = [[Hollyoaks]]\n| image          = Theresa McQueen.JPG\n| imagesize      = 198px\n| name           = Theresa McQueen\n| portrayer      = [[Jorgie Porter]]\n| classification = [[List of Hollyoaks characters#Returning characters|Former; regular (returning)]]\n| occupation     = [[Student]] (2008\u20132011) <br> [[Waitress]] (2009\u20132011) <br> Spa assistant (2011\u20132012) <br> Gym assistant (2012\u20132013) <br> [[Cleaner]] (2013) <br> Florist assistant (2013)<br> [[Secretary]] (2015)\n| home           = 26 Leigh Road (2008\u20132016)<br>[[Alicante]] (2016&ndash;)\n| introducer     = [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] (2008, 2014, 2020)\n| born           = 11 January 1993 \n | years         = 2008\u20132016\n| first          = 24 November 2008\n| last           = \n| family         = [[McQueen family|McQueen]]\n| mother         = [[Kathleen McQueen]]\n| father         = [[William Alexander (Hollyoaks)|Billy Alexander]] \n| daughters      = [[Kathleen-Angel McQueen]]<br>[[Myra-Pocahontas Savage-McQueen]] \n| aunts          = [[Reenie McQueen]]<br>[[Myra McQueen]]\n| grandmothers   = [[Nana McQueen|Marlena McQueen]]\n| grandfathers   = \n| nephews        = [[Bobby Costello]]<br> [[Gabriel McQueen]]\n| nieces         = [[Phoebe McQueen]] (adoptive)\n| sisters        = \n| halfsisters    = [[Jacqui McQueen]] <br> [[Mercedes McQueen]] <br> [[Emily Alexander (Hollyoaks)|Emily Alexander]] \n| spinoffs       = ''[[Hollyoaks Later]]'' (2009\u20132013) <br> ''[[Hollyoaks: King of Hearts]]'' (2010)\n| cousins        = [[Niall Rafferty]] <br>[[Jacqui McQueen]] <br> [[Mercedes McQueen]] <br> [[Tina Reilly]] <br> [[Carmel McQueen]] <br> [[John Paul McQueen]] <br> [[Michaela McQueen]] <br> [[Porsche McQueen]]<br>[[Celine McQueen]] <br> [[Cleo McQueen]]\n| relatives      = [[Bart McQueen]] <br> [[Max McQueen (Hollyoaks)|Max McQueen]] <br> [[Matthew McQueen]]\n}}\n'''Theresa McQueen''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[Channel 4]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Hollyoaks]]'', played by [[Jorgie Porter]]. She made her first appearance on 24 November 2008. The character was introduced as an extension of already established [[McQueen family]] and quickly became a fan favourite for her cute, bubbly personality and dark storylines. During her first five years on the show, Porter was featured in numerous high-profile storylines, including: underage sex; the murder of [[Calvin Valentine]] ([[Ricky Whittle]]); teenage pregnancy; being the target of serial killer [[Silas Blissett]] ([[Jeff Rawle]]); falling down a lift shaft; discovering her boyfriend, [[Ethan Scott]] ([[Craig Vye]]) was dating two other women<!--Liberty and Rae!--> and forming a friendship with the girls; finding her long-lost father; relationships with [[Dodger Savage]] ([[Danny Mac]]), [[Will Savage]] ([[James Atherton]]) and [[Joel Dexter]] (Andrew Still); and her arrest for Calvin's murder. Porter announced her departure from the soap in October 2013 so she could focus on ''[[Dancing on Ice]]''. Her exit scenes aired on 9 January 2014.\n\nIt was announced in April 2014, four months after her exit scenes aired, that Porter would be returning to the serial as Theresa, with her return scenes airing on 25 August 2014.<ref name=2014return/> Theresa's storylines since her return have included: a breakout from prison; giving birth to her second child, this time with Dodger and her subsequent on-off relationship with him; a feud with [[Sonny Valentine]] (Aaron Fontaine); being involved in a train crash which saw Calvin's wife and her cousin, [[Carmel McQueen|Carmel]] ([[Gemma Merna]]) save Theresa and die; being kidnapped by Will; agreeing to donate a kidney to [[Nico Blake]] ([[Persephone Swales-Dawson]]); a relationship with [[Patrick Blake (Hollyoaks)|Patrick Blake]] ([[Jeremy Sheffield]]) which saw her care for him as he suffered from [[motor neurone disease]]; and being targeted by Nico as she plotted to kill her for her other kidney. It was revealed that Porter had chosen to leave the soap again to pursue a career in [[Hollywood]]. Porter agreed to reprise the role in 2020.\n\n==Casting==\nThe character was announced in early November 2008.<ref name=\"ds\">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a134631/new-mcqueen-cast-in-hollyoaks.html|title=New McQueen cast in Hollyoaks|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |first=Kris|last=Green|date=5 November 2008|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref> 20-year-old actress [[Jorgie Porter]] was cast as [[Myra McQueen]]'s ([[Nicole Barber-Lane]]) 15-year-old niece, Theresa. She was described as a \"teen temptress\" and \"[[Lolita (term)|lolita type]]\". Porter, speaking of her new role, said: \"I'm thrilled to be joining not just ''Hollyoaks'' but one of soap's most notorious families. Although she's feisty with outsiders, Theresa's ranking within the family is low so she's eager to impress. I can\u2019t wait to see how Theresa earns her stripes as part of the McQueen clan!\" Due to the departures of [[Tina McQueen]] ([[Leah Hackett]]) and [[John Paul McQueen]] ([[James Sutton (actor)|James Sutton]]) earlier in 2008, ''Hollyoaks'' producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] added a new member to the McQueen family. Theresa was mentioned earlier before her entrance to the soap on-screen during a conversation between Myra and [[Nana McQueen]] ([[Diane Langton]]), her mother [[Kathleen McQueen]] (Alison Burrows) was also mentioned when it was revealed she was in prison.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Characterisation===\nThe character of Theresa was first described as \"A 'teen temptress' and '[[Lolita]] type' who has a distinct lack of [[self-awareness]]. Her vulnerability is her status within her family and she is alert to the fact that she has a long way to go before she becomes a real member of the McQueens.\" Also her keen love of men was noted.<ref name=\"ds\"/> In 2010, Porter commented on the character, saying: \"She's got load of attitude, but she's got a good heart, too. Although she'd probably flirt with your boyfriend. She wouldn't mean to hurt you, but she'd think, 'Your boyfriend fancies me.

You saw her vulnerable when her mum left but this is a total helplessness, she just doesn't know what to do.\"<ref name=\"porter\"/>\n\nWhittle, who portrayed Calvin, told [[Inside Soap]] that he was \"very surprised\" when he learnt the identity of the killer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a217328/whittle-oaks-killer-reveal-shocked-me.html |title=Whittle: 'Oaks killer reveal shocked me' |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=29 April 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> He later admitted he wanted a different killer. He stated: \"My opinion was it would have been someone else. If I was going to pick a killer for Calvin I don't think anyone had a strong enough motive apart from Mercedes ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]), Malachy and Spencer. Obviously, with Malachy, I was sleeping with his wife. Mercedes is a woman scorned, and I don't think Spencer understands consequences so he could probably act without realising that if he shot Calvin he would die and that would be forever. I thought it could possibly been him because he was upset that Calvin left [[Warren Fox|Warren]] to die, so those are the only three I felt had enough motive to pull the trigger.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a221939/whittle-wanted-different-oaks-killer.html |title=Whittle wanted different 'Oaks killer |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=26 May 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref>\n\nAlong with Calvin's murder, Theresa's next main storyline was her pregnancy.

During her arrival, Theresa is attracted to [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]) while in The Loft, whom she meets during an educational-themed night. Sexual tension mounts between the pair and ultimately spend the night together, with Tony unaware that she is only fifteen. Theresa falls in love with Tony, who realises her deception, and destroys any chances of a future with him. A dejected Theresa turns to her family, the McQueens. [[Jacqui McQueen]] ([[Claire Cooper]]), who is still infuriated with Tony for his fling with her sister [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]), is angered with Tony for his night with Theresa. She immediately calls the police, who charge him. Theresa then moves in with the McQueens, sharing a room with cousin [[Michaela McQueen]] ([[Hollie-Jay Bowes]]), whom she previously had turned to for advice. Jacqui is not pleased at Theresa moving in but soon warms. Theresa then tells the police she was deceptive about spending the night with Tony, who is released. Theresa finds an unlikely friendship in [[Anita Roy]] ([[Saira Choudhry]]) and auditions for the part of [[The Virgin Mary]] in a nativity play produced by older cousin [[Carmel McQueen|Carmel Valentine]] ([[Gemma Merna]]) and [[Cindy Cunningham]] ([[Stephanie Waring]]). However, she is heckled off the stage by some teenagers, who clearly know she is not a virgin. On Christmas Day, Anita finds a DVD containing CCTV footage of [[Warren Fox]] ([[Jamie Lomas]]) sleeping with [[Mandy Richardson]] ([[Sarah Jayne Dunn]]) and gives it to the McQueens, who set off to ruin Warren's wedding to [[Louise Summers]] ([[Roxanne McKee]]). Theresa begins battling against [[Lauren Valentine]] ([[Dominique Jackson (British actress)|Dominique Jackson]]) for friendship with Anita. When Lauren makes a comment about the McQueens, Theresa reminds her that Carmel is married to Lauren's brother Calvin. Theresa follows her family by using a fake pregnancy bump to shoplift. Having a proper relationship with [[Ste Hay]] ([[Kieron Richardson]]), Theresa is dumped by him, who wants to focus on son [[Lucas Hay]] (Jude).\n\nAfter the McQueens home becomes infested with rats, Theresa and Carmel move in with Anita and her family. Anita begins to feel she is ugly and becomes increasingly ashamed of her skin colour after racial abuse from [[Gaz Bennett]] ([[Joel Goonan]]). She starts using Theresa's picture to speak to a boy named [[Ricky Campbell]] ([[Ashley Margolis]]) on the internet. Theresa finds out about Anita using her picture and is angry. Anita uses Theresa's jacket and smashes a window in the school. Anita's father [[Govinda Roy]] (Anthony Bunsee) tells Myra, Carmel and Theresa to leave, believing it was Theresa. After Anita admits the truth, her mother [[Bel Roy]] (Nila Aalia) begs Myra, Carmel and Theresa to stay, and tells them that Anita had poured bleach over her legs to change her ethnicity. Theresa feels guilty for not helping Anita and she apologises before reassuring her that she does not need to change her appearance. After a game of 'truth or dare', Theresa has to kiss [[Newt (Hollyoaks)|Newt]] ([[Nico Mirallegro]]). They eventually get together, which is revealed by Anita's partner Ricky, causing Lauren to be extremely jealous. Theresa follows her wish and becomes a model for a project by [[Zoe Carpenter]] ([[Zo\u00eb Lister]]), for \"Buff TV\" while Newt breaks up with her, not a fan of her future career. Theresa is then disgusted when he starts dating Anita, so she slaps her and stops speaking to both of them. Carmel is also shocked with the modelling, and cannot believe that Zoe is using a sixteen-year-old. Due to this, Theresa is spotted and discovered by a modelling agency in [[London]]. Theresa makes her way with Michaela, and are followed by Jacqui and Carmel. When she gets there, she decides to visit her mother Kathleen in prison. Kathleen tells Theresa to move back in with her grandmother, showing hostility towards the other McQueens. Kathleen then leaves an upset Theresa. Back in Hollyoaks, Theresa refuses to speak to Anita, however supports her when she develops an eating disorder.\n\nTheresa is happy to hear that Kathleen is visiting for Christmas, after being released from prison. The rest of the McQueens are skeptical, which proves correct when Kathleen does not arrive. Several days later, Kathleen arrives in Hollyoaks and asks Myra for money, which Theresa's father left for her. Myra refuses and tells her to leave before Theresa finds her. Later, Theresa meets Kathleen just as she is leaving the village. Kathleen, not wanting to disappoint her daughter, claims she has come to stay. Kathleen gives Theresa expensive gifts like a gold charm bracelet. Theresa accepts it, desperate to believe her mother has changed. Kathleen then encourages Theresa to shoplift, which causes more tension between Kathleen and the rest of the McQueens. Kathleen also tells Theresa that they should run away together to London, to which Theresa agrees and says goodbye to Anita, while the rest of the McQueens are out. However, when saying goodbye, Theresa finds her mother's purse which contains a credit card in the name of her dead cousin Tina and is horrified. Myra and Jacqui find out Kathleen and Theresa's plan to run away and tries to stop Theresa from going, to which she agrees. Kathleen then leaves, which leads to Theresa holding a grudge against Jacqui.\n\nCarmel's fianc\u00e9, [[Calvin Valentine]] ([[Ricky Whittle]]), and Theresa spend time together in the Loft. The atmosphere heats up and they end up sleeping together. Later, Theresa gets pregnant with Calvin's child. Theresa begins a romance with [[List of minor Hollyoaks characters (2010)#Kyle Ryder|Kyle Ryder]] (Neil Toon) after she fixes his car. At Calvin and Carmel's second wedding, Theresa admits to Calvin that she is pregnant. Calvin tells her he wants her to have an abortion, which shocks Theresa. He then lies to Carmel about the paternity after she finds out about Theresa's pregnancy. Feeling emotional and rejected, Theresa sees a gun in Jacqui's bag at the wedding reception and snatches it. She shoots Calvin and he dies in Carmel's arms. Mercedes and Jacqui quickly flee the scene with Theresa to protect her. Jacqui is then told that Calvin's passionate rendezvous with Theresa has caused her to fall pregnant. Jacqui stands by Theresa and hides the gun, before lying to police when they are questioned. Theresa decides to run away with Kyle, still in shock at killing Calvin. However, Kyle treats his pregnant girlfriend curtly, and introduces her to his new girlfriend, Stacey. Theresa returns home to the McQueen's. Jacqui tries to force Theresa into terminating the pregnancy, but Carmel convinces her to keep the baby. Jacqui plants the gun used to kill Calvin on racist Gaz, who is caught holding Anita hostage and arrested for killing Calvin. Theresa is unwilling to let Gaz go to prison for Calvin's murder, however is convinced to stay quiet. Myra discovers Theresa is pregnant and eventually uncovers the truth about Calvin's death. Following this, Kyle is arrested for armed robbery and charged with Calvin's murder, as it was his gun that was used to shoot him. Carmel later discovers the baby is Calvin's and that Theresa killed him. Angry, she agrees to let Theresa have the baby, but insists she will go to the police after the birth.\n\nStill trying to pursue a modelling career, Theresa performs a catwalk for [[Heidi Costello]]'s ([[Kim Tiddy]]) fashion show, where she develops a crush to [[Riley Costello]] (Rob Norbury). Later, Theresa talks to Heidi's cousin [[Mitzeee Minniver|Mitzeee]] ([[Rachel Shenton]]), who on purpose does not switch her headset off. Mitzeee then reveals to Theresa, and everyone at the fashion show, that she was involved in an affair with Heidi's husband [[Carl Costello]] ([[Paul Opacic]]) before arriving in the Village. [[Seth Costello]] ([[Miles Higson]] is angered by Theresa and Michaela's gossiping. Theresa and [[Nancy Hayton]] ([[Jessica Fox (actress)|Jessica Fox]]) go to a party with Mitzeee, where she attempts to teach them how to become a [[WAGs|WAG]]. Theresa meets [[Logan Fairhurst]] (Thomas Sean Hughes), and an attraction grows. Theresa almost admits to killing Calvin, but stops when Logan tells her he is a police officer. After being attacked by Mitzeee, Theresa goes into labour and gives birth to a daughter. Carmel tells Theresa that she meant what she said, and will take her to the police for Calvin's murder. Theresa dumps Logan after being influenced by her family that it's for the best. Jacqui manages to convinces Carmel the baby will go into care even though that would be far more appropriate. Mercedes warns Carmel to stay quiet and let Theresa keep her baby and threatens to hand Carmel over to the police for child abduction if she refuses to co-operate.\n\nWhen Theresa is home alone, she hears a knock on the door, she goes to answer it but there is no one there, she walks up to the bins and finds a black balloon with a picture of a fox on it, she goes back in the house and finds Warren, who accuses her of telling someone that he forced a weak man into the burning building after he escaped, revealing to the viewers that she knew the whole time that Warren wasn't dead. Warren recaps on how he escaped the fire, forcing her for answers of who she told, he threatens to drop her off the village wall arch, this leads her to confess that she killed Calvin. Police officer [[Ethan Scott]] ([[Craig Vye]]) arrives at the McQueens' home to question Carmel over Warren's fake death. He and Theresa talk and he later brings Kathleen to the McQueens' after she is caught using fake money. Ethan agrees not to arrest Kathleen if Theresa goes for a drink with him. Kathleen discovers the baby is Calvin's child and Theresa admits to killing him. She makes friends with [[Liberty Savage]] ([[Abi Phillips]]) and soon after discovers she is Ethan's fianc\u00e9e. When Carmel arranges to christen the baby \"Angel\" without Theresa's consent, Kathleen is furious and brings her priest boyfriend round to conduct her granddaughter's christening in secret, and the baby is christened as \"Kathleen Khloe Angel McQueen\". After the christening, Mercedes reminds Carmel that if she doesn't want to go to jail, then she will comply with her demands. Heeding her sister's warning to save herself from going to prison, Carmel agrees to let Theresa keep her daughter.\n\nTheresa hears rumours that Kyle is back in the village, and decides it is best for everyone if she leaves. As she is leaving, Kyle kidnaps Theresa and baby Kathleen-Angel, and takes them to an abandoned bank. He threatens to kill her but Theresa escapes and calls Warren, Carmel and Ethan. They arrive and they try to reason with Kyle, but a fight ensues and Ethan is thrown down a lift shaft and Kyle is shot and killed by Warren. Kathleen-Angel is also in the lift shaft, and when Ethan passes her up, Theresa tries to save Ethan. But while doing so, she falls into the shaft and the platform holding them up falls down to the bottom of the building. Theresa, Kathleen-Angel and Ethan are taken to hospital, where Theresa recovers. After recovering, she finds out that William Alexander is her father making Jacqui and Mercedes her half sisters. William claims that he is dying and needs a donated kidney from a blood relative to survive. As Jacqui doesn't trust him and Mercedes is engaged, Theresa volunteers. She visits him in hospital to find out that William has another daughter who is the one who really needs a kidney. Theresa looks through Kathleen's text messages and sees that she's been blackmailing him, demanding money or she'll tell Theresa his secret. The McQueens demand William and Kathleen to leave.\n\nLiberty finds out Theresa fancies Ethan, after a brief fall out, they agree to tell each other about any boys they meet, although they both continue to have a relationship with Ethan without telling each other. After Theresa finds a note Liberty left for Ethan in his car, she goes to his apartment and punches him. With the help of one of Liberty's brothers, [[Dodger Savage|Dodger]] ([[Danny Mac]]), they spy on Ethan, only to find out he is seeing [[Rae Wilson]] ([[Alice Barlow]]). Theresa tells Liberty that Ethan's been dating the trio and they both tell Rae. One by one, they date Ethan in the same day, Rae pretending to have [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]], Liberty pretending to propose and Theresa pretending she's expecting a second child, at the end of the episode, the three of them find him and dump him. Theresa begins to fall for Liberty's brother, [[Will Savage]] (James Atherton). After dumping Ethan, Will asks her on a date and Theresa accepts. Ethan however visits Theresa and tries to apologize. Theresa tries to get him to leave but Will arrives, thinking she and Ethan are sneaking around behind his back. Will leaves without letting Theresa explain. During Hollyoaks Later, Theresa mistakenly takes Carmel's passport so she was unable to join the Myra and Mercedes in Ibiza. Silas starts targeting Theresa as his next victim and she falls further into his trap by joining an online dating website. However, after Will and Theresa become a couple due to being set up by Rae, Silas then kills Rae.\n\nWill starts to attend university, where he befriends newcomers [[Ash Kane]] ([[Holly Weston]]) and [[Annalise Appleton]] ([[Tamaryn Payne]]), and begins to neglect Theresa, seemingly ashamed of her. Frustrated and on a trip with the Freshers, Theresa decides to tell Will they are over. Theresa becomes attracted to Warren's son [[Joel Dexter]] (Andrew Still) and after going on several dates, the pair become a couple, making ex-boyfriend Will jealous. When Joel's mother Marie arrives to Hollyoaks, Theresa believes they are sleeping together but is later embarrassed when she discovers Marie is his mother. Theresa begins casually dating Dodger and it soon develops into a serious relationship. On the day of Texas' wedding, she burns a piece of paper that says 'Bride' on it. When Theresa finds a gun in the garage, she threatens to kill Dodger because he tried to get evidence on her as he believed she killed Texas but Will soon stops her. The day after, Theresa throws Dodger's clothes into a bin and sets them on fire but Jim throws a beer over it.\n\nCarmel discovers that she has chlamydia and breaks up with her boyfriend [[Jim McGinn]] ([[Dan Tetsell]]). While trying to comfort her, Theresa recounts that she had chlamydia around the time they were both sleeping with Calvin, leading to Carmel realising that she has unknowingly had it ever since. As a result of her missed diagnosis, Carmel learns that she is unlikely to ever conceive a child, resulting in her obsessing over Kathleen-Angel, and Theresa's poor parenting skills. On Christmas Eve, Theresa comes home with an expensive dollhouse for her daughter, despite previously mentioning that she had no money and when Carmel discovers her credit card missing, she later finds out that it was Theresa who had taken it, causing a feud to break out between the cousins. Carmel soon discovers that Theresa had been sending malicious messages to Dodger from a e-mail account belonging to Texas, and she tells Dodger causing him to split up with Theresa. Carmel is also arrested after the police accuse her of shoplifting a dollhouse, though in reality it was Theresa, leading to her feeling her chances of adopting a child were over. In a bid to get revenge on Carmel for facilitating her break-up with Dodger, Theresa climbs into bed with a drunk Jim and claims they had sex, though Nana soon uncovers the truth.\n\nFurious at Theresa's behaviour and neglect of Kathleen-Angel, Carmel hatches a plan and calls Sonny Valentine (now played by Aaron Fontaine) and introduces him to Kathleen-Angel. Carmel desperately tries to convince him to help him get Kathleen away from Theresa, and when Sonny refuses, Carmel blurts out that Theresa killed Calvin. Carmel soon regrets this and is horrified to discover that Sonny has joined the police force since leaving the village. Sonny confronts Theresa on the street, causing her to panic that she is about to be arrested, so Mercedes and Nana hatch a plot for Theresa to leave the country, and she reluctantly agrees to leave Kathleen-Angel with Carmel for the time being. Theresa and Mercedes head to the airport, but when Carmel finds that Kathleen is missing, she instantly thinks that Theresa has taken her on the run and quickly informs the police of Theresa's plan. Theresa is found at the airport, where she tries to evade the police but is soon caught. Carmel soon arrives at the airport, believing Theresa has taken Kathleen-Angel with her. However, Sonny shows up and reveals he took Kathleen-Angel. Theresa is then arrested. Sonny pressures Theresa during the interview and, despite Jim telling her not to say anything, she confesses to killing Calvin. Theresa is charged and Sonny allows Carmel to speak to her. Theresa asks Carmel to look after Kathleen-Angel and tell her she loves her.\n\nOn 25 August 2014, Theresa returns and seeks Mercedes' help with escaping from prison as she is pregnant with a second child and decides to flee to Alicante. She then rings Kathleen to see what Sonny is up to. Theresa manages to get herself admitted to hospital, with Mercedes pretending to be a doctor, and they both handcuff the prison officer to the bed and escape. When outside, Sonny is waiting for her and goes to re-arrest her but he is hit over the head by Myra which sets her free. Once back at Browning's flat, Theresa and Carmel each try to get Kathleen Angel to stay with them, and Theresa decides not to persuade her as she might get upset. Sonny then enters and Kathleen-Angel runs towards him and handcuffs Theresa to the radiator. Theresa calls Kathleen again and Kathleen tells her that she is in Spain. It is then revealed that Kathleen is in fact in hospital after being beaten by Sonny. Theresa is then found by the police and is again arrested.\n\nTheresa returns to the village after evidence is found Sonny tricked Carmel into making a statement against her, she immediately goes into labour where she gives birth to Dodger's baby girl, naming her newborn Myra-Pocahontas Regina Madonna Savage-McQueen. Sonny pays [[Phoebe McQueen]] ([[Mandip Gill]]) to sabotage Theresa, but Theresa believes it is [[Sienna Blake]] ([[Anna Passey]]) - who has taken an interest in Myra-Pocahontas. Phoebe reveals this to Carmel, who drives out into the woods with a doll in the back, and Sonny follows her. Sonny then kidnaps Carmel, but she returns to the village, making her family believe she escaped. Carmel is actually working with Sonny to take Kathleen-Angel, and plans to abduct her on their cousin [[Porsche McQueen]]'s ([[Twinnie Lee Moore]]) wedding day, but she later backs out of the plan. At the reception, which takes place on a party train, Theresa discovers Kathleen-Angel's passport in Carmel's bag and is shocked. She and the rest of the McQueens disown Carmel, before Sonny sneaks onto the train using Carmel's invitation which she discarded. He attacks Theresa and attempts to throw her off the train, but at the same time, the train smashes into Sienna's car, which is on the tracks, and derails. Theresa wakes up and attempts to escape Sonny, but he holds her captive. Camel re-enters the wreckage and fools Sonny into letting Theresa go, but not before propane gas tanks are opened in the scuffle. As Theresa escapes the train, flames react with the gas and the wreckage explodes, instantly killing Sonny. Theresa rushes into the wreckage to find Carmel and locates her near death, and the pair apologize to each other and make up over their horrible history together. As the rest of the McQueens enter, Carmel peacefully passes away and Theresa retrieves her rosary beads from the wreckage. Theresa then finds [[Maxine Minniver]] ([[Nikki Sanderson]]) near death after giving birth, and calls an ambulance. As she heads to the hospital, Theresa offers to be a donor for Sienna and Dodger's daughter, [[Nico Blake]] ([[Persephone Swales-Dawson]]), who requires a kidney transplant, and learns she's a match.\n\nTheresa clashes with Mercedes, who attempts to encourage the McQueens to disown Theresa after ruining Carmel's life more than once. When the McQueens refuse to do that, Mercedes tells the McQueens is her or Theresa. The McQueens choose Theresa, and throw Mercedes out of the house. Mercedes is then stabbed and is nowhere to be found and Theresa suspects that she might have flown to Alicante already to live with Jacqui. It is then revealed from the police that Mercedes has been murdered which devastates the McQueen's. Later that month Theresa decides to give Nico a transplant after she is in need of one due to being born with one which was not functioning. Her cousin Porsche finds out what she was going to do and tries to persuade her not to reminding her of what she had promised Carmel which was to be a good mother and pointed out that she couldn't do that if she wasn't there which changes her mind for a short time but she goes through with the operation anyway. When Theresa donates her kidney to Nico, she is injected with morphine by Sienna and is nearly killed. She is then upset as Dodger is nowhere to be found as he has been taken hostage by Sienna. She and Maxine decide to find Dodger as they discover that Sienna is constantly visiting Anna's house and they suspect Dodger is there. Theresa breaks into the house and discovers Dodger in the basement. Theresa attacks Sienna and calls the police. Sienna then makes an escape and flees to a mental hospital. Theresa then discovers that Maxine did not attend with her but she had been taken hostage by [[Patrick Blake (Hollyoaks)|Patrick Blake]] ([[Jeremy Sheffield]]).\n\nIn January 2015, Maxine and Theresa are taken hostage by Will. Will ties them up under Dodger\u2019s boat and sets it on fire. Dodger saves Maxine and promises to come back for Theresa. Theresa is forced to rescue her herself and is hurt that Dodger saved Maxine instead of her. Theresa tells Dodger that Myra-Pocahontas is not his which upsets Dodger. Myra then tells Theresa to go after him and tell him that she lied. Theresa runs after Dodger to tell him that she loves him and that Myra-Pocahontas is his but is devastated to learn that Dodger has left the village. Theresa applies as a shop assistant and is employed by [[Simone Loveday]] ([[Jacqueline Boatswain]]). She then rants about Simone behind her back with Cindy. Simone is in the shop at the time and fires Theresa. She then applies to be a school secretary and is rejected by Patrick as she is wearing inappropriate clothing for the job. She then confronts Patrick and is then given the job but only as a trial. Patrick is impressed with her work and is appointed as a full-time secretary. Patrick then instructs Theresa to sabotage Maxine's friendship with Darren in order to get custody of Minnie. She goes on several dates with him but Darren discovers that she is working for Patrick. She then goes out to the club with Porsche and Maxine but Minnie is left at home alone and social services take Minnie into emergency custody which upsets Maxine and Patrick suspects that Theresa left her alone and thanks her. It is then revealed that Darren left her there by accident and Maxine gets full-custody of Minnie and Patrick instructs Theresa to get Minnie away from Maxine for good. Theresa and Patrick then talk and Theresa tells him that he is a better man than he was before. Theresa and Patrick then kiss. Theresa suspects that Patrick wants a relationship but he rejects her advances and it was a mistake. Theresa then discovers that Nico has started her period and she is not pregnant. Theresa accepts to keep Nico's secret but informs her that her mother faked a pregnancy and it didn't end well. Nico then tells Theresa to tell Patrick that she has lost the baby. Theresa then tells Patrick that Nico had a miscarriage and tells Patrick to ring her if he needs support.\n\nSienna Blake returns to the village after being released from a mental hospital and becomes suspicious of Theresa's intentions after catching her using Patrick's credit card in the village. After discovering Theresa is supporting Patrick, who has [[motor neurone disease]], she becomes jealous as she wants to support her father. She then attempts to set Theresa up by transferring her father's money into Theresa's account to make her look like a gold-digger. Patrick fires Theresa and she flees to Spain with her kids terrified of going back to prison but returns a few weeks later and restarts her relationship with Patrick after he discovers what Sienna did. After Patrick's car is stolen where he hid the gun that shot Phoebe, he convinces Theresa to go on holiday with him. Theresa accepts and returns a few weeks later for Phoebe's funeral. After a jealous Sienna gets Patrick's insurance company to cancel his life assurance after discovering he was planning to leave his money all to Theresa he then tells her he wouldn't blame her if she wants to leave. Theresa however is furious that he thinks she would be so shallow and tells him she's looking after him because she loves him.\n\nWhen Patrick becomes depressed as Maxine would be supporting Minnie and he doesn't have anything to give her, Theresa suggests conning the school. Patrick initially rejects but then accepts the idea, eventually leading to them getting a grant to build a special needs unit at the school. Theresa is devastated when she finds out that Patrick still loves Maxine so she throws her smoothie over him and demands half the scam money when its done. Patrick later has a change of heart over the scam and tells Theresa that its off, so on the advice of Ashley who was her former cellmate tries to reveal the scam but Patrick tricks her.\n\nIn March 2016, when Nico is told she will need another kidney transplant, she decides to kill Theresa for her last kidney. Theresa babysits Nico and while she is running a bath, Nico stands menacingly behind and contemplates drowning her but fails. She spikes a bottle of wine but when Theresa throws her a two person party, she has a change of heart. However, Theresa drinks the wine and collapses. Fortunately Sienna arrives just in time and she is taken to hospital. Theresa plans to leave the Village but Myra tries to change her mind. After an emotional heart to heart with Myra, she  decides to leave Theresa go. She says goodbye to Myra, John Paul and Myra\u2019s boyfriend [[Diego Salvador Martinez Hernandez De La Cruz]] (Juan Pablo Yepez). Theresa feels like she has forgotten something but shakes it off. As the taxi leaves, Myra sees that she has forgotten her daughter Myra-Pocohontas.\n\n==Reception==\nJorgie Porter made the [[British Soap Awards]] shortlist in 2009 and was nominated for 'Best Newcomer' for her portrayal of Theresa.<ref>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Kris|title=British Soap Awards 2009: Full Panel Shortlist|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/scoop/a154686/british-soap-awards-2009-full-panel-shortlist.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=2010-10-08|date=6 May 2009}}</ref> At the 2010 awards, Porter was nominated for 'Sexiest Female' and 'Best Actress'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/news/a217728/british-soap-awards-2010-the-winners.html |title=British Soap Awards 2010: The Winners |author=Kris Green and Daniel Kilkelly |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |date=9 May 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> Porter was nominated in the categories of \"Best Actress\" and \"Sexiest Female\" at the 2011 awards.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/scoop/a307476/british-soap-awards-2011-voting-opens.html|title=British Soap Awards 2011 voting opens|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=7 March 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=2011-03-07<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x0jSLWib|archivedate=7 March 2011 -->}}</ref> She has also been nominated for the award of 'Best Serial Drama Performance' at the 2011 [[National Television Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a277960/national-television-awards-2011-nominees.html |title=National Television Awards 2011 Nominees |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Catriona |last=Wightman |date=21 September 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> At the 2012 British Soap awards, she was nominated for 'Sexiest Female'.<ref>{{cite web|title=British Soap Awards 2012 - winners in full| url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/news/a378918/british-soap-awards-2012-winners-in-full.html|accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.e4.com/hollyoaks/cast/girls/theresamcqueen.html Character profile] on the [http://www.e4.com/hollyoaks/index.html E4 website]\n\n{{Hollyoaks}}\n{{Hollyoaks characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McQueen, Theresa}}\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2008]]\n[[Category:Fictional prison escapees]]\n[[Category:Fictional models]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Hollyoaks characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas]]\n[[Category:McQueen family]]\n[[Category:Fictional prisoners and detainees]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "Tassedethe", "label": "safe", "comment": "v2.02 - Repaired 1 link to disambiguation page -(You can help)-Matthew McQueen", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_McQueen"}

Chemically, the substance is an [[organic nitrate]] compound rather than a [[nitro compound]], yet the traditional name is often retained. Invented in 1847, nitroglycerin has been used as an active ingredient in the manufacture of [[explosive]]s, mostly [[dynamite]], and as such it is employed in the [[construction]], [[demolition]], and [[mining]] industries. Since the 1880s, it has been used by the military as an active ingredient, and a gelatinizer for [[nitrocellulose]], in some solid [[propellant]]s, such as [[cordite]] and [[ballistite]].\n\nNitroglycerin is a major component in double-based [[smokeless gunpowder]]s used by [[handloading|reloaders]]. Combined with [[nitrocellulose]],  hundreds of powder combinations are used by rifle, pistol, and shotgun reloaders.\n\n[[glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|In medicine]] for over 130 years, nitroglycerin has been used as a potent [[vasodilator]] (dilation of the vascular system) to treat [[heart]] conditions, such as [[angina pectoris]] and [[chronic heart failure]]. Though it was previously known that these beneficial effects are due to nitroglycerin being converted to [[nitric oxide]], a potent venodilator, the enzyme for this conversion was not discovered to be mitochondrial [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] ([[ALDH2]]) until 2002.<ref name=\"Chen et al. 2005 12159\u201312164\">{{cite journal | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | year = 2005 | volume = 102 | pages = 12159\u201312164 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0503723102 | pmid = 16103363 | last2 = Foster | first2 = M.

One of the crates exploded, destroying a [[Wells Fargo]] company office in [[San Francisco]] and killing 15 people.

The explosion led to the loss of six lives, many injuries and much damage to the village. The UK Government was so alarmed at the damage caused and what could have happened in a city location (these two tons were part of a larger load coming from Germany via Liverpool) that they soon passed The Nitro-Glycerine Act of 1869. <ref> North Wales Daily Post newspaper of October 14th 2018. </ref> Liquid nitroglycerin was widely banned elsewhere, as well, and these legal restrictions led to Alfred Nobel and his company's developing [[dynamite]] in 1867. This was made by mixing nitroglycerin with [[diatomaceous earth]] (\"''Kieselguhr''\" in German) found in the Kr\u00fcmmel hills. Similar mixtures, such as \"dualine\" (1867), \"lithofracteur\" (1869), and \"[[gelignite]]\" (1875), were formed by mixing nitroglycerin with other inert absorbents, and many combinations were tried by other companies in attempts to get around Nobel's tightly held patents for dynamite.\n\nDynamite mixtures containing [[nitrocellulose]], which increases the viscosity of the mix, are commonly known as \"gelatins\".\n\nFollowing the discovery that [[amyl nitrite]] helped alleviate chest pain, the physician [[William Murrell]] experimented with the use of nitroglycerin to alleviate angina pectoris and to reduce the [[blood pressure]].

During World War I, [[HM Factory, Gretna]], the largest propellant factory in Britain, produced about 800 [[tonne]]s of cordite RDB per week. This amount required at least 336 tonnes of nitroglycerin per week (assuming no losses in production). The [[Royal Navy]] had its own factory at the [[Royal Navy Cordite Factory, Holton Heath]], in [[Dorset]], England. A large cordite factory was also built in Canada during World War I. The [[Canadian Industries Limited|Canadian Explosives Limited]] cordite factory at [[Nobel, Ontario]], was designed to produce {{convert|1500000|lb|t|abbr=on}} of cordite per month, requiring about 286 tonnes of nitroglycerin per month.\n\n== Instability and desensitization ==\nIn its pure form, nitroglycerin is a [[contact explosive]], with physical shock causing it to explode, and it degrades over time to even more unstable forms. This makes nitroglycerin highly dangerous to transport or use. In its undiluted form, it is one of the world's most powerful explosives, comparable to the more recently developed [[RDX]] and [[PETN]].\n\nEarly in its history,  liquid nitroglycerin was found to be  \"[[Phlegmatized|desensitized]]\" by cooling it to about {{Convert|5|to|10|C|F|-1}}. At this temperature, nitroglycerin freezes, contracting upon [[solidification]]. Thawing it out can be extremely sensitizing, especially if impurities are present or the warming is too rapid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logwell.com/tales/second_nitro_death.html | title=Tales of Destruction \u2013 Thawing can be Hell}}</ref> Chemically \"desensitizing\" nitroglycerin is possible to a point where it can be considered about as \"safe\" as modern [[high explosive]]s, such as by the addition of roughly 10 to 30% [[ethanol]], [[acetone]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logwell.com/tales/red_glycerin.html | title=Tales of Destruction \u2013 Is Nitroglycerin in This?}}</ref> or [[dinitrotoluene]]. (The percentage varies with the desensitizing agent used.) Desensitization requires extra effort to reconstitute the \"pure\" product. Failing this,  desensitized nitroglycerin must be assumed to be substantially more difficult to detonate, possibly rendering it useless as an explosive for practical application.\n\nA serious problem in the use of nitroglycerin results from its high freezing point of {{Convert|13|C|F}}. Solid nitroglycerin is much less sensitive to shock than the liquid, a common feature in explosives. In the past, nitroglycerin was often shipped in the frozen state, but this resulted in a high number of accidents during the thawing process just before its use. This disadvantage is overcome by using mixtures of nitroglycerin with other polynitrates. For example, a mixture of nitroglycerin and [[ethylene glycol dinitrate]] freezes at {{Convert|-29|C|F}}.<ref name=\"fn_1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/nobel/micro/426_77.html | work=Encyclopaedia Britannica | title=Nitroglycerin | accessdate=2005-03-23 }}</ref>\n\n== Detonation ==\nNitroglycerin and any diluents can certainly [[deflagrate]] (burn). The explosive power of nitroglycerin derives from [[detonation]]: energy from the initial decomposition causes a strong pressure wave that detonates the surrounding fuel. This is a self-sustained [[shock wave]] that propagates through the explosive medium at 30 times the speed of sound as a near-instantaneous pressure-induced decomposition of the fuel into a white-hot gas. Detonation of nitroglycerin generates gases that would occupy more than 1,200 times the original volume at ordinary room temperature and pressure. The heat liberated raises the temperature to about {{convert|5000|C|F|-3}}.<ref name=\"fn_1\"/> This is entirely different from deflagration, which depends solely upon available fuel regardless of pressure or shock. The decomposition results in much higher ratio of energy to gas moles released compared to other explosives, making it one of the hottest detonating [[high explosives]].\n\n== Manufacturing ==\nNitroglycerin can be produced by acid-catalyzed nitration of [[glycerol]] (glycerin).\n\n[[File:Nitroglycerin Synthesis V.1.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Nitroglycerin synthesis:<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/jlac.18480640364| title = Zusammensetzung der Zuckerasche |trans-title=Composition of sugar ash| journal = Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie| volume = 64| issue = 3| pages = 398\u2013399| year = 1848}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/jlac.18540920309| title = Ueber Nitroglycerin| journal = Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie| volume = 92| issue = 3| pages = 305\u2013306| year = 1854}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3109/03602537508993747| pmid = 812687| title = Nitroglycerin Revisited: Chemistry, Biochemistry, Interactions| journal = Drug Metabolism Reviews| volume = 4| issue = 1| pages = 1\u201338| year = 1975| last1 = Di Carlo | first1 = F. J. }}</ref>]]\n\nThe industrial manufacturing process often reacts [[glycerol]] with a nearly 1:1 mixture of concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] and concentrated [[nitric acid]]. This can be produced by mixing [[white fuming nitric acid]]\u2014a quite expensive pure [[nitric acid]] in which the oxides of nitrogen have been removed, as opposed to [[red fuming nitric acid]], which contains [[nitrogen oxides]]\u2014and concentrated [[sulfuric acid]]. More often, this mixture is attained by the cheaper method of mixing fuming sulfuric acid, also known as [[oleum]]\u2014[[sulfuric acid]] containing excess [[sulfur trioxide]]\u2014and [[azeotropic]] nitric acid (consisting of about 70% [[nitric acid]], with the rest being water).\n\nThe [[sulfuric acid]] produces [[protonated]] [[nitric acid]] species, which are attacked by [[glycerol]]'s [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]] [[oxygen]] atoms. The [[nitro compound|nitro]] [[functional group|group]] is thus added as an ester C\u2212O\u2212NO<sub>2</sub> and water is produced. This is different from an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction in which [[nitronium ion]]s are the [[electrophile]].\n\nThe addition of [[glycerol]] results in an [[chemical reaction|exothermic reaction]] (i.e., heat is produced), as usual for mixed-acid nitrations. If the mixture becomes too hot, it results in a runaway reaction, a state of accelerated nitration accompanied by the destructive [[oxidation]] of organic materials by the hot [[nitric acid]] and the release of poisonous [[nitrogen dioxide]] gas at high risk of an explosion. Thus, the [[glycerin]] mixture is added slowly to the reaction vessel containing the mixed acid (not acid to glycerin). The nitrator is cooled with cold water or some other coolant mixture and maintained throughout the [[glycerin]] addition at about {{convert|22|C|F}}, much below which the esterification occurs too slowly to be useful. The nitrator vessel, often constructed of [[iron]] or [[lead]] and generally stirred with [[compressed air]], has an emergency trap door at its base, which hangs over a large pool of very cold water and into which the whole reaction mixture (called the charge) can be dumped to prevent an explosion, a process referred to as drowning. If the temperature of the charge exceeds about {{convert|30|C|F}} (actual value varying by country) or brown fumes are seen in the nitrator's vent, then it is immediately drowned.\n\n== Use as an explosive and a propellant ==\n{{Main|Dynamite|Ballistite|Cordite|smokeless powder|Gelignite}}\nThe main use of nitroglycerin, by tonnage, is in explosives such as dynamite and in propellants.\n\nNitroglycerin is an oily liquid that may explode when subjected to heat, shock, or flame.\n\n[[Alfred Nobel]] developed the use of nitroglycerin as a blasting explosive by mixing nitroglycerin with inert [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]]s, particularly \"''Kieselguhr''\", or [[diatomaceous earth]]. He named this explosive [[dynamite]] and [[patented]] it in 1867.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/dstartinventions/a/Alfred_Nobel.htm|title=Alfred Nobel and the History of Dynamite|first=Mary|last=Bellis|work=About.com Money}}</ref> It was supplied ready for use in the form of sticks, individually wrapped in greased waterproof paper. Dynamite and similar explosives were widely adopted for [[civil engineering]] tasks, such as in drilling [[highway]] and [[railroad]] [[tunnel]]s, for [[mining]], for clearing farmland of stumps, in [[quarrying]], and in [[demolition|demolition work]]. Likewise, [[military engineer]]s have used dynamite for construction and demolition work.\n\nNitroglycerin was also used as an ingredient in military propellants for use in [[firearms]].\n\nNitroglycerin has been used in conjunction with [[hydraulic fracturing]], a process used to recover [[crude oil|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] from [[shale]] formations. The technique involves displacing and detonating nitroglycerin in natural or hydraulically induced fracture systems, or displacing and detonating nitroglycerin in hydraulically induced fractures followed by wellbore shots using pelletized [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]].<ref name=\"recovery\">{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=J.

Therefore, it is useful as an ingredient in the formulation of various kinds of [[smokeless powder]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/rzepa/mim/environmental/html/nitroglyc_text.htm|title=Nitroglycerin|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nobel patent.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alfred Nobel]]'s [[patent application]] from 1864]]\nIts sensitivity has limited the usefulness of nitroglycerin as a military explosive, and less sensitive explosives such as [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]], [[RDX]], and [[HMX]] have largely replaced it in munitions. It remains important in military engineering, and [[combat engineer]]s still use dynamite.\n\nAlfred Nobel then developed [[ballistite]], by combining nitroglycerin and [[guncotton]]. He patented it in 1887. Ballistite was adopted by a number of European governments, as a military propellant. Italy was the first to adopt it. The British government and the Commonwealth governments adopted [[cordite]] instead, which had been developed by Sir [[Frederick Abel]] and Sir [[James Dewar]] of the United Kingdom in 1889. The original Cordite Mk&nbsp;I consisted of 58% nitroglycerin, 37% guncotton, and 5.0% [[petroleum jelly]]. Ballistite and cordite were both manufactured in the forms of \"cords\".\n\nSmokeless powders were originally developed using nitrocellulose as the sole explosive ingredient. Therefore, they were known as single-base propellants. A range of smokeless powders that contains both nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin, known as double-base propellants, were also developed. Smokeless powders were originally supplied only for military use, but they were also soon developed for civilian use and were quickly adopted for sports. Some are known as sporting powders. Triple-base propellants contain nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin, and [[nitroguanidine]], but are reserved mainly for extremely high-caliber ammunition rounds such as those used in tank cannons and [[naval artillery]]. Blasting gelatin, also known as [[gelignite]], was invented by Nobel in 1875, using nitroglycerin, [[wood pulp]], and [[sodium nitrate|sodium]] or [[potassium nitrate]]. This was an early, low-cost, flexible explosive.\n\n== Medical use ==\n{{Main|Medical use of nitroglycerin}}\nNitroglycerin belongs to a group of drugs called nitrates, which includes many other nitrates like [[isosorbide dinitrate]] (Isordil) and [[isosorbide mononitrate]] (Imdur, Ismo, Monoket).<ref name=\"Nitroglycerin Article\">{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/nitroglycerin/article.htm|title=nitroglycerin, Nitro-Bid: Drug Facts, Side Effects and Dosing|first=Omudhome|last=Ogbru|work=MedicineNet}}</ref> These agents all exert their effect by being converted to [[nitric oxide]] in the body by mitochondrial [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] ([[ALDH2]]),<ref name=\"Chen et al. 2005 12159\u201312164\"/> and nitric oxide is a potent natural vasodilator.\n\n[[File:Nitro.JPG|alt=Nitro - bangy stuff|thumb|upright|Nitroglycerin in three different forms: intravenous, sublingual spray, and the nitroglycerin patch.]]\nIn [[medicine]], nitroglycerin is used for [[angina pectoris]], a painful symptom of [[coronary heart disease|ischemic heart disease]] caused by inadequate flow of blood and oxygen to the heart and as a potent antihypertensive agent. Nitroglycerin corrects the imbalance between the flow of oxygen and blood to the heart.<ref name=\"Nitroglycerin Article\"/> At low doses, nitroglycerin dilates veins more than arteries, thereby reducing [[preload (cardiology)|preload]] (volume of blood in the heart after filling); this is thought to be its primary mechanism of action. By decreasing preload, the heart has less blood to pump, which decreases oxygen requirement since the heart does not have to work as hard. Additionally, having a smaller preload reduces the ventricular transmural pressure (pressure exerted on the walls of the heart), which decreases the compression of heart arteries to allow more blood to flow through the heart. At higher doses, it also dilates arteries, thereby reducing [[afterload]] (decreasing the pressure against which the heart must pump).<ref name=\"Nitroglycerin Article\"/> Improved myocardial oxygen demand vs oxygen delivery ratio leads to the following therapeutic effects during episodes of angina pectoris: subsiding of chest pain, decrease of [[blood pressure]], increase of heart rate, and [[orthostatic hypotension]]. Patients experiencing angina when doing certain physical activities can often prevent symptoms by taking nitroglycerin 5 to 10 minutes before the activity. Overdoses may generate [[methemoglobinemia]].<ref>{{cite journal| pmid=3917597 | volume=55 | issue=1 | title=Association of methemoglobinemia and intravenous nitroglycerin administration | year=1985 | journal=American Journal of Cardiology | pages=181\u2013183 | last1=Kaplan | first1=K.

Some forms of nitroglycerin last much longer in the body than others. Continuous exposure to nitrates has been shown to cause the body to stop responding normally to this medicine. Experts recommend that the patches be removed at night, allowing the body a few hours to restore its responsiveness to nitrates. Shorter-acting preparations of nitroglycerin can be used several times a day with less risk of developing tolerance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/src/detail?vid=17&hid=7&sid=7e55c0c3-4b92-4b24-ac2d-b2091791a502%40sessionmgr14&bdata=JnNpdGU9c3JjLWxpdmU%3d#db=hxh&AN=9703191987|title=Nitroglycerin for angina, February 1997, Vol. 7|access-date=9 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510141029/http://web.ebscohost.com/src/detail?vid=17&hid=7&sid=7e55c0c3-4b92-4b24-ac2d-b2091791a502%40sessionmgr14&bdata=JnNpdGU9c3JjLWxpdmU%3d#db=hxh&AN=9703191987|archive-date=10 May 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Nitroglycerin was first used by [[William Murrell]] to treat angina attacks in 1878, with the discovery published that same year.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 1798737| year = 1971| author1 = Smith| first1 = E.| title = William Murrell, physician and practical therapist| journal = British Medical Journal| volume = 3| issue = 5775| pages = 632\u2013633| last2 = Hart| first2 = F.

'''1,2,3-trinitroxypropane''', is a dense, colorless, oily, [[explosive]] liquid most commonly produced by [[nitration|nitrating]] [[glycerol]] with [[white fuming nitric acid]] under conditions appropriate to the formation of the nitric acid [[ester]]. Chemically, the substance is an [[organic nitrate]] compound rather than a [[nitro compound]], yet the traditional name is often retained. Invented in 1847, nitroglycerin has been used as an active ingredient in the manufacture of [[explosive]]s, mostly [[dynamite]], and as such it is employed in the [[construction]], [[demolition]], and [[mining]] industries. Since the 1880s, it has been used by the military as an active ingredient, and a gelatinizer for [[nitrocellulose]], in some solid [[propellant]]s, such as [[cordite]] and [[ballistite]].\n\nNitroglycerin is a major component in double-based [[smokeless gunpowder]]s used by [[handloading|reloaders]]. Combined with [[nitrocellulose]],  hundreds of powder combinations are used by rifle, pistol, and shotgun reloaders.\n\n[[glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|In medicine]] for over 130 years, nitroglycerin has been used as a potent [[vasodilator]] (dilation of the vascular system) to treat [[heart]] conditions, such as [[angina pectoris]] and [[chronic heart failure]]. Though it was previously known that these beneficial effects are due to nitroglycerin being converted to [[nitric oxide]], a potent venodilator, the enzyme for this conversion was not discovered to be mitochondrial [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] ([[ALDH2]]) until 2002.<ref name=\"Chen et al. 2005 12159\u201312164\">{{cite journal | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | year = 2005 | volume = 102 | pages = 12159\u201312164 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0503723102 | pmid = 16103363 | last2 = Foster | first2 = M.

One of the crates exploded, destroying a [[Wells Fargo]] company office in [[San Francisco]] and killing 15 people. This led to a complete ban on the transportation of liquid nitroglycerin in California. The on-site manufacture of nitroglycerin was thus required for the remaining hard-rock [[drilling and blasting]] required for the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in [[North America]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/tcrr/peopleevents/e_nitro.html |title=Transcontinental Railroad \u2013 People & Events: Nitroglycerin |website=[[American Experience]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1869, two one-ton wagons loaded with nitroglycerin, then known locally as Powder-Oil, exploded in the North Wales village of Cwm-Y-Glo. The explosion led to the loss of six lives, many injuries and much damage to the village. The UK Government was so alarmed at the damage caused and what could have happened in a city location (the load came from Germany via Liverpool) that they soon passed The Nitro-Glycerine Act of 1869. <ref> North Wales Daily Post newspaper of October 14th 2018. </ref> Liquid nitroglycerin was widely banned elsewhere, as well, and these legal restrictions led to Alfred Nobel and his company's developing [[dynamite]] in 1867. This was made by mixing nitroglycerin with [[diatomaceous earth]] (\"''Kieselguhr''\" in German) found in the Kr\u00fcmmel hills. Similar mixtures, such as \"dualine\" (1867), \"lithofracteur\" (1869), and \"[[gelignite]]\" (1875), were formed by mixing nitroglycerin with other inert absorbents, and many combinations were tried by other companies in attempts to get around Nobel's tightly held patents for dynamite.\n\nDynamite mixtures containing [[nitrocellulose]], which increases the viscosity of the mix, are commonly known as \"gelatins\".\n\nFollowing the discovery that [[amyl nitrite]] helped alleviate chest pain, the physician [[William Murrell]] experimented with the use of nitroglycerin to alleviate angina pectoris and to reduce the [[blood pressure]]. He began treating his patients with small diluted doses of nitroglycerin in 1878, and this treatment was soon adopted into widespread use after Murrell published his results in the journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 1879.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Murrell |first=William |date=1879 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.d0000772988;view=1up;seq=78 |title=Nitroglycerin as a remedy for angina pectoris |journal=The Lancet |volume=1 |pages=80\u201381, 113\u2013115, 151\u2013152, 225\u2013227}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|last=Sneader |first=Walter |title=Drug Discovery: A History |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-471-89980-8}}</ref> A few months before his death in 1896, Alfred Nobel was prescribed nitroglycerin for this heart condition, writing to a friend: \"Isn't it the irony of fate that I have been prescribed nitro-glycerin, to be taken internally!

During World War I, [[HM Factory, Gretna]], the largest propellant factory in Britain, produced about 800 [[tonne]]s of cordite RDB per week. This amount required at least 336 tonnes of nitroglycerin per week (assuming no losses in production). The [[Royal Navy]] had its own factory at the [[Royal Navy Cordite Factory, Holton Heath]], in [[Dorset]], England. A large cordite factory was also built in Canada during World War I. The [[Canadian Industries Limited|Canadian Explosives Limited]] cordite factory at [[Nobel, Ontario]], was designed to produce {{convert|1500000|lb|t|abbr=on}} of cordite per month, requiring about 286 tonnes of nitroglycerin per month.\n\n== Instability and desensitization ==\nIn its pure form, nitroglycerin is a [[contact explosive]], with physical shock causing it to explode, and it degrades over time to even more unstable forms. This makes nitroglycerin highly dangerous to transport or use. In its undiluted form, it is one of the world's most powerful explosives, comparable to the more recently developed [[RDX]] and [[PETN]].\n\nEarly in its history,  liquid nitroglycerin was found to be  \"[[Phlegmatized|desensitized]]\" by cooling it to about {{Convert|5|to|10|C|F|-1}}. At this temperature, nitroglycerin freezes, contracting upon [[solidification]]. Thawing it out can be extremely sensitizing, especially if impurities are present or the warming is too rapid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logwell.com/tales/second_nitro_death.html | title=Tales of Destruction \u2013 Thawing can be Hell}}</ref> Chemically \"desensitizing\" nitroglycerin is possible to a point where it can be considered about as \"safe\" as modern [[high explosive]]s, such as by the addition of roughly 10 to 30% [[ethanol]], [[acetone]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logwell.com/tales/red_glycerin.html | title=Tales of Destruction \u2013 Is Nitroglycerin in This?}}</ref> or [[dinitrotoluene]]. (The percentage varies with the desensitizing agent used.) Desensitization requires extra effort to reconstitute the \"pure\" product. Failing this,  desensitized nitroglycerin must be assumed to be substantially more difficult to detonate, possibly rendering it useless as an explosive for practical application.\n\nA serious problem in the use of nitroglycerin results from its high freezing point of {{Convert|13|C|F}}. Solid nitroglycerin is much less sensitive to shock than the liquid, a common feature in explosives. In the past, nitroglycerin was often shipped in the frozen state, but this resulted in a high number of accidents during the thawing process just before its use. This disadvantage is overcome by using mixtures of nitroglycerin with other polynitrates. For example, a mixture of nitroglycerin and [[ethylene glycol dinitrate]] freezes at {{Convert|-29|C|F}}.<ref name=\"fn_1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/nobel/micro/426_77.html | work=Encyclopaedia Britannica | title=Nitroglycerin | accessdate=2005-03-23 }}</ref>\n\n== Detonation ==\nNitroglycerin and any diluents can certainly [[deflagrate]] (burn). The explosive power of nitroglycerin derives from [[detonation]]: energy from the initial decomposition causes a strong pressure wave that detonates the surrounding fuel. This is a self-sustained [[shock wave]] that propagates through the explosive medium at 30 times the speed of sound as a near-instantaneous pressure-induced decomposition of the fuel into a white-hot gas. Detonation of nitroglycerin generates gases that would occupy more than 1,200 times the original volume at ordinary room temperature and pressure. The heat liberated raises the temperature to about {{convert|5000|C|F|-3}}.<ref name=\"fn_1\"/> This is entirely different from deflagration, which depends solely upon available fuel regardless of pressure or shock. The decomposition results in much higher ratio of energy to gas moles released compared to other explosives, making it one of the hottest detonating [[high explosives]].\n\n== Manufacturing ==\nNitroglycerin can be produced by acid-catalyzed nitration of [[glycerol]] (glycerin).\n\n[[File:Nitroglycerin Synthesis V.1.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Nitroglycerin synthesis:<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/jlac.18480640364| title = Zusammensetzung der Zuckerasche |trans-title=Composition of sugar ash| journal = Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie| volume = 64| issue = 3| pages = 398\u2013399| year = 1848}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/jlac.18540920309| title = Ueber Nitroglycerin| journal = Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie| volume = 92| issue = 3| pages = 305\u2013306| year = 1854}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3109/03602537508993747| pmid = 812687| title = Nitroglycerin Revisited: Chemistry, Biochemistry, Interactions| journal = Drug Metabolism Reviews| volume = 4| issue = 1| pages = 1\u201338| year = 1975| last1 = Di Carlo | first1 = F. J. }}</ref>]]\n\nThe industrial manufacturing process often reacts [[glycerol]] with a nearly 1:1 mixture of concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] and concentrated [[nitric acid]]. This can be produced by mixing [[white fuming nitric acid]]\u2014a quite expensive pure [[nitric acid]] in which the oxides of nitrogen have been removed, as opposed to [[red fuming nitric acid]], which contains [[nitrogen oxides]]\u2014and concentrated [[sulfuric acid]]. More often, this mixture is attained by the cheaper method of mixing fuming sulfuric acid, also known as [[oleum]]\u2014[[sulfuric acid]] containing excess [[sulfur trioxide]]\u2014and [[azeotropic]] nitric acid (consisting of about 70% [[nitric acid]], with the rest being water).\n\nThe [[sulfuric acid]] produces [[protonated]] [[nitric acid]] species, which are attacked by [[glycerol]]'s [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]] [[oxygen]] atoms. The [[nitro compound|nitro]] [[functional group|group]] is thus added as an ester C\u2212O\u2212NO<sub>2</sub> and water is produced. This is different from an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction in which [[nitronium ion]]s are the [[electrophile]].\n\nThe addition of [[glycerol]] results in an [[chemical reaction|exothermic reaction]] (i.e., heat is produced), as usual for mixed-acid nitrations. If the mixture becomes too hot, it results in a runaway reaction, a state of accelerated nitration accompanied by the destructive [[oxidation]] of organic materials by the hot [[nitric acid]] and the release of poisonous [[nitrogen dioxide]] gas at high risk of an explosion. Thus, the [[glycerin]] mixture is added slowly to the reaction vessel containing the mixed acid (not acid to glycerin). The nitrator is cooled with cold water or some other coolant mixture and maintained throughout the [[glycerin]] addition at about {{convert|22|C|F}}, much below which the esterification occurs too slowly to be useful. The nitrator vessel, often constructed of [[iron]] or [[lead]] and generally stirred with [[compressed air]], has an emergency trap door at its base, which hangs over a large pool of very cold water and into which the whole reaction mixture (called the charge) can be dumped to prevent an explosion, a process referred to as drowning. If the temperature of the charge exceeds about {{convert|30|C|F}} (actual value varying by country) or brown fumes are seen in the nitrator's vent, then it is immediately drowned.\n\n== Use as an explosive and a propellant ==\n{{Main|Dynamite|Ballistite|Cordite|smokeless powder|Gelignite}}\nThe main use of nitroglycerin, by tonnage, is in explosives such as dynamite and in propellants.\n\nNitroglycerin is an oily liquid that may explode when subjected to heat, shock, or flame.\n\n[[Alfred Nobel]] developed the use of nitroglycerin as a blasting explosive by mixing nitroglycerin with inert [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]]s, particularly \"''Kieselguhr''\", or [[diatomaceous earth]]. He named this explosive [[dynamite]] and [[patented]] it in 1867.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/dstartinventions/a/Alfred_Nobel.htm|title=Alfred Nobel and the History of Dynamite|first=Mary|last=Bellis|work=About.com Money}}</ref> It was supplied ready for use in the form of sticks, individually wrapped in greased waterproof paper. Dynamite and similar explosives were widely adopted for [[civil engineering]] tasks, such as in drilling [[highway]] and [[railroad]] [[tunnel]]s, for [[mining]], for clearing farmland of stumps, in [[quarrying]], and in [[demolition|demolition work]]. Likewise, [[military engineer]]s have used dynamite for construction and demolition work.\n\nNitroglycerin was also used as an ingredient in military propellants for use in [[firearms]].\n\nNitroglycerin has been used in conjunction with [[hydraulic fracturing]], a process used to recover [[crude oil|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] from [[shale]] formations. The technique involves displacing and detonating nitroglycerin in natural or hydraulically induced fracture systems, or displacing and detonating nitroglycerin in hydraulically induced fractures followed by wellbore shots using pelletized [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]].<ref name=\"recovery\">{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=J.

Therefore, it is useful as an ingredient in the formulation of various kinds of [[smokeless powder]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/rzepa/mim/environmental/html/nitroglyc_text.htm|title=Nitroglycerin|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nobel patent.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alfred Nobel]]'s [[patent application]] from 1864]]\nIts sensitivity has limited the usefulness of nitroglycerin as a military explosive, and less sensitive explosives such as [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]], [[RDX]], and [[HMX]] have largely replaced it in munitions. It remains important in military engineering, and [[combat engineer]]s still use dynamite.\n\nAlfred Nobel then developed [[ballistite]], by combining nitroglycerin and [[guncotton]]. He patented it in 1887. Ballistite was adopted by a number of European governments, as a military propellant. Italy was the first to adopt it. The British government and the Commonwealth governments adopted [[cordite]] instead, which had been developed by Sir [[Frederick Abel]] and Sir [[James Dewar]] of the United Kingdom in 1889. The original Cordite Mk&nbsp;I consisted of 58% nitroglycerin, 37% guncotton, and 5.0% [[petroleum jelly]]. Ballistite and cordite were both manufactured in the forms of \"cords\".\n\nSmokeless powders were originally developed using nitrocellulose as the sole explosive ingredient. Therefore, they were known as single-base propellants. A range of smokeless powders that contains both nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin, known as double-base propellants, were also developed. Smokeless powders were originally supplied only for military use, but they were also soon developed for civilian use and were quickly adopted for sports. Some are known as sporting powders. Triple-base propellants contain nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin, and [[nitroguanidine]], but are reserved mainly for extremely high-caliber ammunition rounds such as those used in tank cannons and [[naval artillery]]. Blasting gelatin, also known as [[gelignite]], was invented by Nobel in 1875, using nitroglycerin, [[wood pulp]], and [[sodium nitrate|sodium]] or [[potassium nitrate]]. This was an early, low-cost, flexible explosive.\n\n== Medical use ==\n{{Main|Medical use of nitroglycerin}}\nNitroglycerin belongs to a group of drugs called nitrates, which includes many other nitrates like [[isosorbide dinitrate]] (Isordil) and [[isosorbide mononitrate]] (Imdur, Ismo, Monoket).<ref name=\"Nitroglycerin Article\">{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/nitroglycerin/article.htm|title=nitroglycerin, Nitro-Bid: Drug Facts, Side Effects and Dosing|first=Omudhome|last=Ogbru|work=MedicineNet}}</ref> These agents all exert their effect by being converted to [[nitric oxide]] in the body by mitochondrial [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] ([[ALDH2]]),<ref name=\"Chen et al. 2005 12159\u201312164\"/> and nitric oxide is a potent natural vasodilator.\n\n[[File:Nitro.JPG|alt=Nitro - bangy stuff|thumb|upright|Nitroglycerin in three different forms: intravenous, sublingual spray, and the nitroglycerin patch.]]\nIn [[medicine]], nitroglycerin is used for [[angina pectoris]], a painful symptom of [[coronary heart disease|ischemic heart disease]] caused by inadequate flow of blood and oxygen to the heart and as a potent antihypertensive agent. Nitroglycerin corrects the imbalance between the flow of oxygen and blood to the heart.<ref name=\"Nitroglycerin Article\"/> At low doses, nitroglycerin dilates veins more than arteries, thereby reducing [[preload (cardiology)|preload]] (volume of blood in the heart after filling); this is thought to be its primary mechanism of action. By decreasing preload, the heart has less blood to pump, which decreases oxygen requirement since the heart does not have to work as hard. Additionally, having a smaller preload reduces the ventricular transmural pressure (pressure exerted on the walls of the heart), which decreases the compression of heart arteries to allow more blood to flow through the heart. At higher doses, it also dilates arteries, thereby reducing [[afterload]] (decreasing the pressure against which the heart must pump).<ref name=\"Nitroglycerin Article\"/> Improved myocardial oxygen demand vs oxygen delivery ratio leads to the following therapeutic effects during episodes of angina pectoris: subsiding of chest pain, decrease of [[blood pressure]], increase of heart rate, and [[orthostatic hypotension]]. Patients experiencing angina when doing certain physical activities can often prevent symptoms by taking nitroglycerin 5 to 10 minutes before the activity. Overdoses may generate [[methemoglobinemia]].<ref>{{cite journal| pmid=3917597 | volume=55 | issue=1 | title=Association of methemoglobinemia and intravenous nitroglycerin administration | year=1985 | journal=American Journal of Cardiology | pages=181\u2013183 | last1=Kaplan | first1=K.

Wallace has said that Sally uses her strict nature as \"a bit of a front\" that hides a \"softer side\".<ref name=thedsinterview/>\n\n===Transgender status===\nSally initially keeps her transgender status a secret because of negative past experiences. At her previous school when parents and teachers found out they began to bully her.<ref name=thedsinterview/> [[John Paul McQueen]] ([[James Sutton (actor)|James Sutton]]) is first to learn about her transition. He accidentally makes the discovery but is supportive towards Sally. Wallace told Daniel Kilkelly from [[Digital Spy]] that \"it's the last thing Sally wanted to happen so soon after joining.\"<ref name=thedsinterview/> Sally is \"terrified\" and \"fears\" that those at Hollyoaks High will treat her the same as her previous school. John Paul's support for Sally becomes a positive in her life. He wants her to fit in with everyone else. Wallace enjoyed working with Sutton because he offered her support off-camera. When more character learn of her status Sally has become more settled at the school. The actress said that Sally has \"earned respect\" and enjoys working at the school. While it not an ideal situation, she feels better equipped to deal with everyone knowing.<ref name=thedsinterview/>\n\nThe first student to learn about Sally being transgender is [[Peri Lomax]] ([[Ruby O'Donnell]]). Sally refuses to let Peri hand in her work assignment late which upsets her. Peri wants revenge and she defaces a student art display which Sally is planning to unveil during an event hosted for the parents of students.<ref name=insidesoapinterview/> When Sally unveils the exhibition there is red graffiti spelling out the derogatory term \"tranny\".

Some fans managed to figure out the story after they noticed Sally keeping a photograph of John Paul weeks before.<ref name=thedsinterviewtwo/>\n\nThe actress told Kilkelly that Sally came to Hollyoaks to find John Paul. She always knew he existed but she always felt unable to visit him. But as she has reached fifty-years-old and the height of her profession, she decided it was time.<ref name=thedsinterviewtwo/> When the job position came up at Hollyoaks High, Sally knew the McQueen family lived in the village and she had found the perfect opportunity to be close to him. Despite not revealing her identity, Wallace defended Sally stating \"She's been keeping it a secret from John Paul because she's too scared of how he's going to react, but she's still tried to be in his company all the time.\"<ref name=thedsinterviewtwo/>\n\nSome viewers perceived the story to be too outlandish. But Wallace noted that scriptwriters had been in contact with All About Trans for advice. She also claimed that it is not an uncommon scenario for a transgender person to become embroiled in. Trans people may have children existing from before their transition was complete. Wallace quipped the most uncommon and \"very soap\" part of the story was that it featured a headteacher and employee.<ref name=thedsinterviewtwo/> On-screen Myra orders Sally to never tell John Paul the truth.

He is immediately irritated by Sally, and his wife [[Maxine Minniver]] ([[Nikki Sanderson]]) later starts a riot at the school when she has Patrick fired with immediate effect. She takes a shine to John Paul, and when he is helping her move into her new office, he comes across a document stating that Sally's birth name is \"Iain Naismith\", and realises that she is transgender. She later confirms this when he asks her about it. She is devastated in January 2016 when Peri, after hearing a conversation between her and John Paul, vandalises the school art exhibition, outing her as transgender. She suspends Peri immediately, and decides to resign from Hollyoaks High. After a heart-to-heart with John Paul, Sally decides to remain at the school. She later produces a photograph of John Paul from her desk, and looks at it, smiling.\n\nWhen laptops are stolen from the school while in John Paul's care, Sally reluctantly suspends him. This infuriates his mother, Myra, who goes to the school and confronts Sally. Myra instantly recognises Sally as Iain, and it is confirmed that Sally is John Paul's father. After a heated argument, Myra demands that Sally never tell John Paul the truth, which she reluctantly agrees to. She continues giving John Paul special treatment at work, leading John Paul to believe that she has feelings for him. When John Paul gets into a fight with [[Pete Buchanan]] ([[Kai Owen]]) on the school playground, Sally screams that John Paul is her son, stunning everybody. John Paul refuses to speak to Myra or Sally, but slowly warms to Sally when he finds and reads a letter from her which should have been given to him when he was a child, making him more hostile with Myra for withholding it. Myra later demands that Sally pay for all the years of [[child maintenance]] that she missed out on for John Paul, which she agrees to do but Myra is still adamant that Sally stays away. As she storms off, she sees red and attacks Sally, resulting in Myra falling down the stairs of the school. The next day, Sally is arrested for attempting to murder Myra, so John Paul hires [[James Nightingale (Hollyoaks)|James Nightingale]] ([[Gregory Finnegan]]) to defend her. She admits to James that she pushed Myra down the stairs in self-defence, but James warns her that if she does not lie to the police, she could be sent to an all-male prison, as she does not have a gender recognition certificate. When Sally eventually confesses to John Paul, he tells her that he wishes she never came back into his life.\n\nSally later supports John Paul's decision to leave the village for Singapore, however Myra is against it, and falls out with Sally as a result. Sally later offers to help co-parent Myra's newborn daughter, [[Carmina McQueen|Carmina]], however Myra's other daughter [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) warns Sally off. She later becomes close friends with [[Neeta Kaur]] ([[Amrit Maghera]]), and this leads to Sally giving her a job at the school as a teaching assistant and them buying a flat together. However, Sally is worried when Neeta decides to move out to reunite with her abusive ex-fianc\u00e9, [[Mac Nightingale]] ([[David Easter]]), who exposes Neeta's affair with student [[Hunter McQueen]] (Theo Graham) when Sally learns that Mac has hit Neeta. A gas explosion later rips through Hollyoaks High, trapping Mac, Neeta, Sally, Hunter and other students. Sally and Hunter escape unharmed, however Mac kills Neeta by dropping her from height when the floor collapses. Following Neeta's death, Sally, Hunter and other residents become determined to have revenge on Mac, and after Sally visits him to confront him over Neeta's death, he confesses to killing her before punching Sally to the ground.\n\nSally later moves in with Myra and the McQueens after a leak at her flat, however Myra later discovers that this was a lie, and that Sally has developed feelings for her. Myra and Sally grow closer and they share a passionate kiss, however Myra instantly regrets this at first and protests to Sally that she is not a lesbian. Myra later declares her love for Sally and they start a relationship, much to the initial disapproval of Myra's mother [[Nana McQueen]] ([[Diane Langton]]), although she later warms to the relationship. On Christmas Day 2018, Myra proposes to Sally, to which she accepts and they plan for a wedding in March 2019. However, when Myra begins having doubts about the wedding, questioning her sexuality and kissing a DJ the night before the ceremony, Sally decides to call off the wedding, and reluctantly ends her relationship with Myra. As a result, Myra decides that she must leave the village forever to live in Spain with her other daughters, leaving Sally heartbroken.\n\nSally later meets [[Finn O'Connor]] (Keith Rice), who raped John Paul five years ago and takes an instant dislike to him. After Finn visits the school delivering Christmas trees, Sally banishes him from the premises in front of his boss, causing him to lose his job. [[Edward Hutchinson (Hollyoaks)|Edward Hutchinson]] ([[Joe McGann]]) forms an alliance with Sally to plot to drive Finn out of the village, and convinces her to call the police, but Sally and Edward are unaware that Finn's friend [[Yasmine Maalik]] (Haiesha Mistry), has overheard their plans. John Paul later returns to the village, delighting Sally.\n\n==Reception==\nDuncan Lindsay writing for the ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' described Sally as a \"refreshing\" and \"strong teacher\" who acts as a \"brilliant role model\" for the show's audience.

She is determined to influence her schools with her own policy. She is not a vindictive woman and only hands out punishments for good reasons. Wallace has said that Sally uses her strict nature as \"a bit of a front\" that hides a \"softer side\".<ref name=thedsinterview/>\n\n===Transgender status===\nSally initially keeps her transgender status a secret because of negative past experiences. At her previous school when parents and teachers found out they began to bully her.<ref name=thedsinterview/> [[John Paul McQueen]] ([[James Sutton (actor)|James Sutton]]) is first to learn about her transition. He accidentally makes the discovery but is supportive towards Sally. Wallace told Daniel Kilkelly from [[Digital Spy]] that \"it's the last thing Sally wanted to happen so soon after joining.\"<ref name=thedsinterview/> Sally is \"terrified\" and \"fears\" that those at Hollyoaks High will treat her the same as her previous school. John Paul's support for Sally becomes a positive in her life. He wants her to fit in with everyone else. Wallace enjoyed working with Sutton because he offered her support off-camera. When more character learn of her status Sally has become more settled at the school. The actress said that Sally has \"earned respect\" and enjoys working at the school. While it not an ideal situation, she feels better equipped to deal with everyone knowing.<ref name=thedsinterview/>\n\nThe first student to learn about Sally being transgender is [[Peri Lomax]] ([[Ruby O'Donnell]]). Sally refuses to let Peri hand in her work assignment late which upsets her. Peri wants revenge and she defaces a student art display which Sally is planning to unveil during an event hosted for the parents of students.<ref name=insidesoapinterview/> When Sally unveils the exhibition there is red graffiti spelling out the derogatory term \"tranny\".

Wallace told Laura Heffernan from ''[[Inside Soap]]'' that her character stands up for herself and states that she will not tolerate transphobia.<ref name=insidesoapinterview/>\n\nThe events do leave Sally's future in Hollyoaks uncertain. Wallace said that her character may behave as \"a bit of a hard act\" but the revelation is a \"real dent to her self-esteem and she truly believes she is about to lose everything dearest to her.\"<ref name=insidesoapinterview/> Sally announces her intention to resign from her position but John Paul tries to persuade her otherwise. But Sally mistakes John Paul's concern for criticism and she slaps him in the face.<ref name=insidesoapinterview/> The actress explained that John Paul gives Sally \"tough love\" but says the wrong thing.

Sally and [[Myra McQueen]] ([[Nicole Barber-Lane]]) interact for the first time and it is revealed that Sally is John Paul's father.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/03/14/hollyoaks-star-annie-wallace-reveals-the-aftermath-as-mrs-st-claire-is-revealed-as-john-paul-mcqueens-dad-5748676/|title=Hollyoaks star Annie Wallace reveals the aftermath as Mrs St Claire is revealed as John Paul McQueen's dad!|website=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=([[DMG Media]]|accessdate=4 June 2016}}</ref> While the story was kept a secret and not mentioned in press spoilers, Wallace had known about it for six months. Sutton was also involved in Wallace's audition process when producers were secretly testing their on-camera compatibility.<ref name=thedsinterviewtwo/> She was told during a storyline conference and Wallace found keeping the secret \"delightful\". Some fans managed to figure out the story after they noticed Sally keeping a photograph of John Paul weeks before.<ref name=thedsinterviewtwo/>\n\nThe actress told Kilkelly that Sally came to Hollyoaks to find John Paul. She always knew he existed but she always felt unable to visit him. But as she has reached fifty-years-old and the height of her profession, she decided it was time.<ref name=thedsinterviewtwo/> When the job position came up at Hollyoaks High, Sally knew the McQueen family lived in the village and she had found the perfect opportunity to be close to him. Despite not revealing her identity, Wallace defended Sally stating \"She's been keeping it a secret from John Paul because she's too scared of how he's going to react, but she's still tried to be in his company all the time.\"<ref name=thedsinterviewtwo/>\n\nSome viewers perceived the story to be too outlandish. But Wallace noted that scriptwriters had been in contact with All About Trans for advice. She also claimed that it is not an uncommon scenario for a transgender person to become embroiled in. Trans people may have children existing from before their transition was complete. Wallace quipped the most uncommon and \"very soap\" part of the story was that it featured a headteacher and employee.<ref name=thedsinterviewtwo/> On-screen Myra orders Sally to never tell John Paul the truth. She had lied to him that [[Ricky Bowen]] (Simon Cassidy) was his father. Myra knows it will destroy their bond if he knows she lied.<ref name=thedsinterviewtwo>{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks star Annie Wallace reacts to THAT shock Sally and John Paul twist: 'It can't stay secret forever'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/interviews/a786782/hollyoaks-star-annie-wallace-on-shock-sally-and-john-paul-twist-it-cant-stay-secret-forever/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=11 June 2016|date=14 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Storylines==\nSally first appears introducing herself to [[Patrick Blake (Hollyoaks)|Patrick Blake]] ([[Jeremy Sheffield]]) as his replacement. He is immediately irritated by Sally, and his wife [[Maxine Minniver]] ([[Nikki Sanderson]]) later starts a riot at the school when she has Patrick fired with immediate effect. She takes a shine to John Paul, and when he is helping her move into her new office, he comes across a document stating that Sally's birth name is \"Iain Naismith\", and realises that she is transgender. She later confirms this when he asks her about it. She is devastated in January 2016 when Peri, after hearing a conversation between her and John Paul, vandalises the school art exhibition, outing her as transgender. She suspends Peri immediately, and decides to resign from Hollyoaks High. After a heart-to-heart with John Paul, Sally decides to remain at the school. She later produces a photograph of John Paul from her desk, and looks at it, smiling.\n\nWhen laptops are stolen from the school while in John Paul's care, Sally reluctantly suspends him. This infuriates his mother, Myra, who goes to the school and confronts Sally. Myra instantly recognises Sally as Iain, and it is confirmed that Sally is John Paul's father. After a heated argument, Myra demands that Sally never tell John Paul the truth, which she reluctantly agrees to. She continues giving John Paul special treatment at work, leading John Paul to believe that she has feelings for him. When John Paul gets into a fight with [[Pete Buchanan]] ([[Kai Owen]]) on the school playground, Sally screams that John Paul is her son, stunning everybody. John Paul refuses to speak to Myra or Sally, but slowly warms to Sally when he finds and reads a letter from her which should have been given to him when he was a child, making him more hostile with Myra for withholding it. Myra later demands that Sally pay for all the years of [[child maintenance]] that she missed out on for John Paul, which she agrees to do but Myra is still adamant that Sally stays away. As she storms off, she sees red and attacks Sally, resulting in Myra falling down the stairs of the school. The next day, Sally is arrested for attempting to murder Myra, so John Paul hires [[James Nightingale (Hollyoaks)|James Nightingale]] ([[Gregory Finnegan]]) to defend her. She admits to James that she pushed Myra down the stairs in self-defence, but James warns her that if she does not lie to the police, she could be sent to an all-male prison, as she does not have a gender recognition certificate. When Sally eventually confesses to John Paul, he tells her that he wishes she never came back into his life.\n\nSally later supports John Paul's decision to leave the village for Singapore, however Myra is against it, and falls out with Sally as a result. Sally later offers to help co-parent Myra's newborn daughter, [[Carmina McQueen|Carmina]], however Myra's other daughter [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) warns Sally off. She later becomes close friends with [[Neeta Kaur]] ([[Amrit Maghera]]), and this leads to Sally giving her a job at the school as a teaching assistant and them buying a flat together. However, Sally is worried when Neeta decides to move out to reunite with her abusive ex-fianc\u00e9, [[Mac Nightingale]] ([[David Easter]]), who exposes Neeta's affair with student [[Hunter McQueen]] (Theo Graham) when Sally learns that Mac has hit Neeta. A gas explosion later rips through Hollyoaks High, trapping Mac, Neeta, Sally, Hunter and other students. Sally and Hunter escape unharmed, however Mac kills Neeta by dropping her from height when the floor collapses. Following Neeta's death, Sally, Hunter and other residents become determined to have revenge on Mac, and after Sally visits him to confront him over Neeta's death, he confesses to killing her before punching Sally to the ground.\n\nSally later moves in with Myra and the McQueens after a leak at her flat, however Myra later discovers that this was a lie, and that Sally has developed feelings for her. Myra and Sally grow closer and they share a passionate kiss, however Myra instantly regrets this at first and protests to Sally that she is not a lesbian. Myra later declares her love for Sally and they start a relationship, much to the initial disapproval of Myra's mother [[Nana McQueen]] ([[Diane Langton]]), although she later warms to the relationship. On Christmas Day 2018, Myra proposes to Sally, to which she accepts and they plan for a wedding in March 2019. However, when Myra begins having doubts about the wedding, questioning her sexuality and kissing a DJ the night before the ceremony, Sally decides to call off the wedding, and reluctantly ends her relationship with Myra. As a result, Myra decides that she must leave the village forever to live in Spain with her other daughters, leaving Sally heartbroken.\n\nSally later meets [[Finn O'Connor]] (Keith Rice), who raped John Paul five years ago and takes an instant dislike to him. After Finn visits the school delivering Christmas trees, Sally banishes him from the premises in front of his boss, causing him to lose his job. [[Edward Hutchinson (Hollyoaks)|Edward Hutchinson]] ([[Joe McGann]]) forms an alliance with Sally to plot to drive Finn out of the village, and convinces her to call the police, but Sally and Edward are unaware that Finn's friend [[Yasmine Maalik]] (Haiesha Mistry), has overheard their plans. John Paul later returns to the village, delighting Sally.\n\n==Reception==\nDuncan Lindsay writing for the ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' described Sally as a \"refreshing\" and \"strong teacher\" who acts as a \"brilliant role model\" for the show's audience.

In German, Pentecost is called ''Pfingsten'', developed through contracting the Greek term ''pen[te]k[os]te'', and often coincides with scholastic holidays and the beginning of many outdoor and springtime activities, such as festivals and organized outdoor activities by youth organizations. The Monday after Pentecost is a legal holiday in many European nations.\n\nIn [[Eastern Christianity]], Pentecost can also refer to the entire fifty days of [[Easter]] through Pentecost inclusive; hence the book containing the liturgical texts is called the \"''[[Pentecostarion]]''\". Since its date depends on the [[date of Easter]], Pentecost is a \"[[moveable feast]]\".\n\nPentecost is one of the [[Great Feasts]] of the Eastern Orthodox Church, a [[Solemnity]] in the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, a [[Liturgical calendar (Lutheran)#Festivals|Festival]] in the Lutheran Churches, and a [[Principal Feast]] in the Anglican Communion.

Leo discusses other Catholic doctrine pertaining to the Holy Spirit, especially emphasizing the Spirit's relationship to the Father and Son of the Trinity and the Catholic Church. He draws an analogy between Jewish practices and the Christian feast day: \"As once to the Hebrew people, freed from Egypt, the law was given on Mt.

Uniquely, these prayers include a petition for all of those in hell, that they may be granted relief and even ultimate release from their confinement, if God deems this possible.<ref>[http://www.stnicholaspdx.org/2004/06/02/25.pentecost-prayers-of-kneeling/ Pentecost\u2014Prayers of Kneeling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102021042/http://www.stnicholaspdx.org/2004/06/02/25.pentecost-prayers-of-kneeling/ |date=2013-11-02 }}. See the third prayer.</ref>\n\nAll of the remaining days of the [[ecclesiastical year]], until the preparation for the next [[Great Lent]], are named for the day after Pentecost on which they occur (for example, the 13th Tuesday After Pentecost).\n\nThe Second Monday after Pentecost is the beginning of the [[Apostles' Fast]] (which continues until the [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]] on June 29). Theologically, Orthodox do not consider Pentecost to be the \"birthday\" of the Church; they see the Church as having existed before the creation of the world (cf. ''[[The Shepherd of Hermas]]'')<ref>''[[Patrologia Graecae]]'', 35:1108\u20139.</ref>\n\nThe Orthodox [[icon]] of the feast depicts the Twelve Apostles seated in a semicircle (sometimes the [[Theotokos]] (Virgin Mary) is shown sitting in the center of them). At the top of the icon, the Holy Spirit, in the form of tongues of fire, is descending upon them. At the bottom is an [[allegory|allegorical]] figure, called ''[[Cosmos|Kosmos]]'', which symbolizes the world. Although Kosmos is crowned with earthly glory he sits in the darkness caused by the ignorance of God. He is holding a towel on which have been placed 12 scrolls, representing the teaching of the Twelve Apostles.\n\nIn the ancient [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], Pentecost is one of the seven Major \"Lord's Feasts\". It is celebrated at the time of ninth hour (3:00&nbsp;pm) on the Sunday of Pentecost by a special three-segment prayer known as the \"Office of Genuflection (Kneeling Prayer)\". This feast is followed with the \"Apostles Fast\" which has a fixed end date on the fifth of the Coptic month of Epip [which currently falls on July 12, which is equivalent to June 29, due to the current 13-day Julian-Gregorian calendar offset]. The fifth of Epip is the commemoration of the Martyrdom of St. Peter and Paul.\n\n=== Western churches ===\n[[File:Pentecost Altar.jpg|thumb|A Protestant church altar, decorated for Pentecost with red burning candles and red banners and altar cloth depicting the movement of the Holy Spirit]]\n\nThe liturgical celebrations of Pentecost in [[Western Christianity|Western churches]] are as rich and varied as those in the East. The main sign of Pentecost in the West is the color red. It symbolizes joy and the fire of the Holy Spirit.\n\nPriests or ministers, and choirs wear red [[vestments]], and in modern times, the custom has extended to the [[laity|lay people]] of the congregation wearing red clothing in celebration as well.

Red flowers at the altar/preaching area, and red flowering plants such as [[geraniums]] around the church are also typical decorations for Pentecost masses/services. These symbolize the renewal of life, the coming of the warmth of summer, and the growth of the church at and from the first Pentecost.<ref name=\"stcatherineofsweden1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stcatherineofsweden.org/BULLETIN.htm |title=St. Catherine of Sweden Roman Catholic Church \u2013 Bulletin |publisher=StCatherineofSweden.org |accessdate=2010-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829002010/http://www.stcatherineofsweden.org/BULLETIN.htm |archivedate=2009-08-29 }}</ref> In the southern hemisphere, for example, in southern Australia, Pentecost comes in the mellow autumntide, after the often great heat of summer, and the red leaves of the poinsettia have often been used to decorate churches then.\n\n[[File:Protestant Altar Pentecost Red Flowers Green Birch.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A Protestant church altar and font, decorated for Pentecost with red flowering plants and green birch branches|A Protestant church altar and font, decorated for Pentecost with red flowering plants and green birch branches]]\nThese flowers often play an important role in the ancestral rites, and other rites, of the particular congregation.

At Pentecost, these Holy Ghost holes would be decorated with flowers, and sometimes a dove figure lowered through into the church while the narrative of Pentecost was read. Holy Ghost holes can still be seen today in European churches such as [[Canterbury Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|reason=I can't find any scholarly references to this \u2013 'Middle Ages' is a huge category with ecclesiastical and architectural shifts occurring in various countries at various times.|date=November 2011}}\n\nSimilarly, a large two dimensional dove figure would be, and in some places still is, cut from wood, painted, and decorated with flowers, to be lowered over the congregation, particularly during the singing of the [[sequence (poetry)|sequence hymn]], or ''[[Veni Creator Spiritus]]''. In other places, particularly [[Sicily]] and the [[Italy|Italian peninsula]], [[Rosalia (festival)#Rose Sundays|rose petals]] were and are thrown from the galleries over the congregation, recalling the tongues of fire. In modern times, this practice has been revived, and adapted as well, to include the strewing of [[origami]] doves from above or suspending them, sometimes by the hundreds, from the ceiling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecva.org/congregations/resources/trinity_bloomington_pentecost/trinity_pentecost.htm |title=The Episcopal Church and Visual Arts |publisher=Ecva.org |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases, red fans, or red handkerchiefs, are distributed to the congregation to be waved during the procession, etc. Other congregations have incorporated the use of red balloons, signifying the \"Birthday of the Church\". These may be borne by the congregants, decorate the sanctuary, or released all at once.\n\n=== Fasting, baptisms, and confirmations ===\nFor some [[Protestants]], the nine days between [[Ascension Day]], and Pentecost are set aside as a time of [[fasting]] and universal prayer in honor of the disciples' time of prayer and unity awaiting the Holy Spirit. Similarly among [[Roman Catholics]], special Pentecost [[novenas]] are prayed. The Pentecost Novena is considered the first novena, all other novenas prayed in preparation of various feasts deriving their practice from those original nine days of prayer observed by the disciples of Christ.\n\nWhile the Eve of Pentecost was traditionally a day of fasting for Catholics, contemporary [[canon law]] no longer requires it. Both Catholics and Protestants may hold spiritual [[retreats]], prayer [[vigil]]s, and [[litanies]] in the days leading up to Pentecost. In some cases vigils on the Eve of Pentecost may last all night. Pentecost is also one of the occasions specially appointed for the Lutheran Litany to be sung.<ref>{{cite web |author=(P. Drews.) |url=http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc06/htm/iii.lxxiv.xvi.htm |title=Litany |publisher=Ccel.org |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\nFrom the early days of Western Christianity, Pentecost became one of the days set aside to celebrate [[Baptism]]. In Northern Europe Pentecost was preferred even over Easter for this rite, as the temperatures in late spring might be supposed to be more conducive to outdoor [[immersion baptism|immersion]] as was then the practice. It is proposed that the term [[Whit Sunday]] derives from the custom of the newly baptized wearing white clothing, and from the white vestments worn by the clergy in [[Sarum Rite|English liturgical uses]]. The holiday was also one of the three days each year (along with [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]]) Roman Catholics were required to [[confession (religion)|confess]] and receive [[Holy Communion]] in order to remain in good ecclesiastical standing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06278a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Frequent Communion |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\nHoly Communion is likewise often a feature of the Protestant observance of Pentecost as well. It is one of the relatively few Sundays some [[Reformed]] denominations may offer the communion meal, and is one of the days of the year specially appointed among [[Moravian Church|Moravians]] for the celebration of their Love Feasts. [[Ordinations]] are celebrated across a wide array of Western denominations at Pentecost, or near to it. In some denominations, for example the [[Lutheran]] Church, even if an ordination or consecration of a [[deaconess]] is not celebrated on Pentecost, the [[liturgical color]] will invariably be red, and the theme of the service will be the Holy Spirit.\n\nAbove all, Pentecost is a day to hold [[Confirmation]] celebrations for youth. Flowers, the wearing of white robes or white dresses recalling Baptism, rites such as the [[laying on of hands]], and vibrant singing play prominent roles on these joyous occasions, the blossoming of Spring forming an equal analogy with the blossoming of youth.\n\nThe typical image of Pentecost in the West is that of the [[Virgin Mary]] seated centrally and prominently among the disciples with flames resting on the crowns of their heads. Occasionally, parting clouds suggesting the action of the \"mighty wind\",<ref name=\"bibleverse|Acts|2:2|KJV\" /> rays of light and the Dove are also depicted. Of course, the Western iconographic style is less static and stylized than that of the East, and other very different representations have been produced, and, in some cases, have achieved great fame such as the Pentecosts by [[Titian]], [[Giotto]], and [[el Greco]].\n\n[[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] already in the 1st century notes the importance of this festival to the [[early Christian]] communities. (See: {{bibleref2|Acts|20:16}} & {{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|16:8}}) Since the lifetime of some who may have been eyewitnesses, annual celebrations of the descent of the Holy Spirit have been observed. Before the [[Second Vatican Council]] [[Whitmonday|Pentecost Monday]] as well was a [[Holy Day of Obligation]] during which the Catholic Church addressed the newly baptized and confirmed. After the Council, Pentecost Monday is no longer solemnized.\n\nNevertheless, Pentecost Monday remains an official festival in many Protestant churches, such as the (Lutheran) [[Church of Sweden]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], and others. In the [[Greek Byzantine Catholic Church|Byzantine Catholic Rite]] Pentecost Monday is no longer a [[Holy Day of Obligation]], but rather a simple [[holiday]]. In the Extraordinary Form of the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church, as at Easter, the [[Ranks of Catholic liturgical days|liturgical rank]] of Monday and Tuesday of Pentecost week is a Double of the First Class<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15614b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Pentecost |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1912-10-01 |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref> and across many Western denominations, Pentecost is celebrated with an [[Octave (liturgical)|octave]] culminating on [[Trinity Sunday]]. However, in the modern Roman Rite (Ordinary Form), Pentecost ends after Evening Prayer on the feast day itself, with [[Ordinary Time]] resuming the next day.\n[[File:Duccio di Buoninsegna 018.jpg|thumb|alt=A typical Western image of the Pentecost.

In other cases, Pentecost may be ignored as a holy day in these churches. In many evangelical churches in the United States, the secular holiday, [[Mother's Day]], may be more celebrated than the ancient and biblical feast of Pentecost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.churchyear.net/pentecost.html |title=Pentecost: All About Pentecost (Whitsunday)! |publisher=ChurchYear.net |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref> Some evangelicals and Pentecostals are observing the liturgical calendar and observe Pentecost as a day to teach the [[Gifts of the Holy Spirit]].{{clarify|Note that this says just the opposite of the first sentence|date=December 2012}}\n\nAcross denominational lines Pentecost has been an opportunity for Christians to honor the role of the Holy Spirit in their lives, and celebrate the birth of the Church in an [[ecumenical]] context.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themint.org.uk/yPhoto086_PentecostPicnic2009.html |title=Pentecost Picnic 2009 |publisher=Themint.org.uk |accessdate=2010-05-17}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://monashcatholics.blogspot.com/2007/06/photos-of-ecumenical-pentecost.html |title=Catholics at Monash: Photos of Ecumenical Pentecost Celebrations |publisher=MonashCatholics.blogspot.com |date=2007-06-15 |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\n== Classical compositions for Pentecost ==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}\nThe [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church of the [[Baroque]] observed three days of Pentecost.

In German, Pentecost is called ''Pfingsten'', developed through contracting the Greek term ''pen[te]k[os]te'', and often coincides with scholastic holidays and the beginning of many outdoor and springtime activities, such as festivals and organized outdoor activities by youth organizations. The Monday after Pentecost is a legal holiday in many European nations.\n\nIn [[Eastern Christianity]], Pentecost can also refer to the entire fifty days of [[Easter]] through Pentecost inclusive; hence the book containing the liturgical texts is called the \"''[[Pentecostarion]]''\".

Leo discusses other Catholic doctrine pertaining to the Holy Spirit, especially emphasizing the Spirit's relationship to the Father and Son of the Trinity and the Catholic Church. He draws an analogy between Jewish practices and the Christian feast day: \"As once to the Hebrew people, freed from Egypt, the law was given on Mt.

[[Eastern Orthodox church architecture|Orthodox churches]] are often decorated with greenery and flowers on this feast day, and the celebration is intentionally similar to the Jewish holiday of [[Shavuot]], which celebrates the giving of the [[Mosaic Law]].\n\nThe feast itself lasts three days. The first day is known as \"[[Trinity Sunday]]\"; the second day is known as \"[[Spirit Monday]]\" (or \"Monday of the Holy Spirit\"); and the third day, Tuesday, is called the \"[[Third Day of the Trinity]].\"<ref>{{cite web |author=All troparia and kontakia \u00b7 All lives of saints |url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?SID=4&ID=1&FSID=47 |title=Trinity Week \u2013 3rd Day of the Trinity |publisher=Ocafs.oca.org |accessdate=2013-12-21}}</ref> The [[Afterfeast]] of Pentecost lasts for one week, during which [[fasting]] is not permitted, even on Wednesday and Friday.

This is a [[Great Vespers|Vespers]] service to which are added three sets of long poetical prayers, the composition of Saint [[Basil the Great]], during which everyone makes a full [[Genuflection#Orthodox Christianity|prostration]], touching their foreheads to the floor (prostrations in church having been forbidden from the day of [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter) up to this point).  Uniquely, these prayers include a petition for all of those in hell, that they may be granted relief and even ultimate release from their confinement, if God deems this possible.<ref>[http://www.stnicholaspdx.org/2004/06/02/25.pentecost-prayers-of-kneeling/ Pentecost\u2014Prayers of Kneeling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102021042/http://www.stnicholaspdx.org/2004/06/02/25.pentecost-prayers-of-kneeling/ |date=2013-11-02 }}. See the third prayer.</ref>\n\nAll of the remaining days of the [[ecclesiastical year]], until the preparation for the next [[Great Lent]], are named for the day after Pentecost on which they occur (for example, the 13th Tuesday After Pentecost).\n\nThe Second Monday after Pentecost is the beginning of the [[Apostles' Fast]] (which continues until the [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]] on June 29). Theologically, Orthodox do not consider Pentecost to be the \"birthday\" of the Church; they see the Church as having existed before the creation of the world (cf. ''[[The Shepherd of Hermas]]'')<ref>''[[Patrologia Graecae]]'', 35:1108\u20139.</ref>\n\nThe Orthodox [[icon]] of the feast depicts the Twelve Apostles seated in a semicircle (sometimes the [[Theotokos]] (Virgin Mary) is shown sitting in the center of them). At the top of the icon, the Holy Spirit, in the form of tongues of fire, is descending upon them. At the bottom is an [[allegory|allegorical]] figure, called ''[[Cosmos|Kosmos]]'', which symbolizes the world. Although Kosmos is crowned with earthly glory he sits in the darkness caused by the ignorance of God. He is holding a towel on which have been placed 12 scrolls, representing the teaching of the Twelve Apostles.\n\nIn the ancient [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], Pentecost is one of the seven Major \"Lord's Feasts\". It is celebrated at the time of ninth hour (3:00&nbsp;pm) on the Sunday of Pentecost by a special three-segment prayer known as the \"Office of Genuflection (Kneeling Prayer)\". This feast is followed with the \"Apostles Fast\" which has a fixed end date on the fifth of the Coptic month of Epip [which currently falls on July 12, which is equivalent to June 29, due to the current 13-day Julian-Gregorian calendar offset]. The fifth of Epip is the commemoration of the Martyrdom of St. Peter and Paul.\n\n=== Western churches ===\n[[File:Pentecost Altar.jpg|thumb|A Protestant church altar, decorated for Pentecost with red burning candles and red banners and altar cloth depicting the movement of the Holy Spirit]]\n\nThe liturgical celebrations of Pentecost in [[Western Christianity|Western churches]] are as rich and varied as those in the East.

Red flowers at the altar/preaching area, and red flowering plants such as [[geraniums]] around the church are also typical decorations for Pentecost masses/services.

At Pentecost, these Holy Ghost holes would be decorated with flowers, and sometimes a dove figure lowered through into the church while the narrative of Pentecost was read. Holy Ghost holes can still be seen today in European churches such as [[Canterbury Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|reason=I can't find any scholarly references to this \u2013 'Middle Ages' is a huge category with ecclesiastical and architectural shifts occurring in various countries at various times.|date=November 2011}}\n\nSimilarly, a large two dimensional dove figure would be, and in some places still is, cut from wood, painted, and decorated with flowers, to be lowered over the congregation, particularly during the singing of the [[sequence (poetry)|sequence hymn]], or ''[[Veni Creator Spiritus]]''. In other places, particularly [[Sicily]] and the [[Italy|Italian peninsula]], [[Rosalia (festival)#Rose Sundays|rose petals]] were and are thrown from the galleries over the congregation, recalling the tongues of fire. In modern times, this practice has been revived, and adapted as well, to include the strewing of [[origami]] doves from above or suspending them, sometimes by the hundreds, from the ceiling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecva.org/congregations/resources/trinity_bloomington_pentecost/trinity_pentecost.htm |title=The Episcopal Church and Visual Arts |publisher=Ecva.org |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases, red fans, or red handkerchiefs, are distributed to the congregation to be waved during the procession, etc. Other congregations have incorporated the use of red balloons, signifying the \"Birthday of the Church\". These may be borne by the congregants, decorate the sanctuary, or released all at once.\n\n=== Fasting, baptisms, and confirmations ===\nFor some [[Protestants]], the nine days between [[Ascension Day]], and Pentecost are set aside as a time of [[fasting]] and universal prayer in honor of the disciples' time of prayer and unity awaiting the Holy Spirit. Similarly among [[Roman Catholics]], special Pentecost [[novenas]] are prayed. The Pentecost Novena is considered the first novena, all other novenas prayed in preparation of various feasts deriving their practice from those original nine days of prayer observed by the disciples of Christ.\n\nWhile the Eve of Pentecost was traditionally a day of fasting for Catholics, contemporary [[canon law]] no longer requires it. Both Catholics and Protestants may hold spiritual [[retreats]], prayer [[vigil]]s, and [[litanies]] in the days leading up to Pentecost. In some cases vigils on the Eve of Pentecost may last all night. Pentecost is also one of the occasions specially appointed for the Lutheran Litany to be sung.<ref>{{cite web |author=(P. Drews.) |url=http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc06/htm/iii.lxxiv.xvi.htm |title=Litany |publisher=Ccel.org |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\nFrom the early days of Western Christianity, Pentecost became one of the days set aside to celebrate [[Baptism]]. In Northern Europe Pentecost was preferred even over Easter for this rite, as the temperatures in late spring might be supposed to be more conducive to outdoor [[immersion baptism|immersion]] as was then the practice. It is proposed that the term [[Whit Sunday]] derives from the custom of the newly baptized wearing white clothing, and from the white vestments worn by the clergy in [[Sarum Rite|English liturgical uses]]. The holiday was also one of the three days each year (along with [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]]) Roman Catholics were required to [[confession (religion)|confess]] and receive [[Holy Communion]] in order to remain in good ecclesiastical standing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06278a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Frequent Communion |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\nHoly Communion is likewise often a feature of the Protestant observance of Pentecost as well. It is one of the relatively few Sundays some [[Reformed]] denominations may offer the communion meal, and is one of the days of the year specially appointed among [[Moravian Church|Moravians]] for the celebration of their Love Feasts. [[Ordinations]] are celebrated across a wide array of Western denominations at Pentecost, or near to it. In some denominations, for example the [[Lutheran]] Church, even if an ordination or consecration of a [[deaconess]] is not celebrated on Pentecost, the [[liturgical color]] will invariably be red, and the theme of the service will be the Holy Spirit.\n\nAbove all, Pentecost is a day to hold [[Confirmation]] celebrations for youth. Flowers, the wearing of white robes or white dresses recalling Baptism, rites such as the [[laying on of hands]], and vibrant singing play prominent roles on these joyous occasions, the blossoming of Spring forming an equal analogy with the blossoming of youth.\n\nThe typical image of Pentecost in the West is that of the [[Virgin Mary]] seated centrally and prominently among the disciples with flames resting on the crowns of their heads. Occasionally, parting clouds suggesting the action of the \"mighty wind\",<ref name=\"bibleverse|Acts|2:2|KJV\" /> rays of light and the Dove are also depicted. Of course, the Western iconographic style is less static and stylized than that of the East, and other very different representations have been produced, and, in some cases, have achieved great fame such as the Pentecosts by [[Titian]], [[Giotto]], and [[el Greco]].\n\n[[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] already in the 1st century notes the importance of this festival to the [[early Christian]] communities. (See: {{bibleref2|Acts|20:16}} & {{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|16:8}}) Since the lifetime of some who may have been eyewitnesses, annual celebrations of the descent of the Holy Spirit have been observed. Before the [[Second Vatican Council]] [[Whitmonday|Pentecost Monday]] as well was a [[Holy Day of Obligation]] during which the Catholic Church addressed the newly baptized and confirmed. After the Council, Pentecost Monday is no longer solemnized.\n\nNevertheless, Pentecost Monday remains an official festival in many Protestant churches, such as the (Lutheran) [[Church of Sweden]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], and others. In the [[Greek Byzantine Catholic Church|Byzantine Catholic Rite]] Pentecost Monday is no longer a [[Holy Day of Obligation]], but rather a simple [[holiday]]. In the Extraordinary Form of the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church, as at Easter, the [[Ranks of Catholic liturgical days|liturgical rank]] of Monday and Tuesday of Pentecost week is a Double of the First Class<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15614b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Pentecost |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1912-10-01 |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref> and across many Western denominations, Pentecost is celebrated with an [[Octave (liturgical)|octave]] culminating on [[Trinity Sunday]]. However, in the modern Roman Rite (Ordinary Form), Pentecost ends after Evening Prayer on the feast day itself, with [[Ordinary Time]] resuming the next day.\n[[File:Duccio di Buoninsegna 018.jpg|thumb|alt=A typical Western image of the Pentecost.

In other cases, Pentecost may be ignored as a holy day in these churches. In many evangelical churches in the United States, the secular holiday, [[Mother's Day]], may be more celebrated than the ancient and biblical feast of Pentecost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.churchyear.net/pentecost.html |title=Pentecost: All About Pentecost (Whitsunday)! |publisher=ChurchYear.net |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref> Some evangelicals and Pentecostals are observing the liturgical calendar and observe Pentecost as a day to teach the [[Gifts of the Holy Spirit]].{{clarify|Note that this says just the opposite of the first sentence|date=December 2012}}\n\nAcross denominational lines Pentecost has been an opportunity for Christians to honor the role of the Holy Spirit in their lives, and celebrate the birth of the Church in an [[ecumenical]] context.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themint.org.uk/yPhoto086_PentecostPicnic2009.html |title=Pentecost Picnic 2009 |publisher=Themint.org.uk |accessdate=2010-05-17}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://monashcatholics.blogspot.com/2007/06/photos-of-ecumenical-pentecost.html |title=Catholics at Monash: Photos of Ecumenical Pentecost Celebrations |publisher=MonashCatholics.blogspot.com |date=2007-06-15 |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\n== Classical compositions for Pentecost ==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}\nThe [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church of the [[Baroque]] observed three days of Pentecost.

In [[general revelation]], God reveals himself through his creation, such that at least some truths about God can be learned by the [[empiricism|empirical]] study of nature, [[physics]], [[cosmology]], etc., to an individual. Special revelation is the knowledge of God and spiritual matters which can be discovered through [[supernatural]] means, such as scripture or miracles, by individuals. [[Direct revelation]] refers to communication from God to someone in particular.\n\nThough one may deduce the existence of God and some of God's attributes through general revelation, certain specifics may be known only through special revelation. Aquinas believed that special revelation is equivalent to the revelation of God in Jesus. The major theological components of Christianity, such as the [[Trinity]] and the [[Incarnation]], are revealed in the teachings of the church and the scriptures and may not otherwise be deduced. Special revelation and natural revelation are complementary rather than contradictory in nature.\n\n\"[[Continuous revelation]]\" is a term for the theological position that God continues to reveal divine principles or commandments to humanity.\n\nIn the 20th century, religious [[existentialist]]s proposed that revelation held no content in and of itself but rather that God inspired people with his presence by coming into contact with them. Revelation is a human response that records how we respond to God.\n\n===Public revelation===\n[[File:The Ten Commandments (Bible Card).jpg|thumb|right|upright|100px|The mass-revelation at the [[Mount Horeb]] in an illustration from a Christian Bible card published by the Providence Lithograph Company, 1907]]\nSome religious groups believe a deity has been revealed or spoken to a large group of people or have legends to a similar effect. In the [[Book of Deuteronomy]], [[Yahweh]] is said to have been revealed upon giving the [[Ten Commandments]] to the [[Israelites]] at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. In [[Christianity]], the [[Book of Acts]] describes the [[Pentecost|Day of Pentecost]] wherein a large group of the followers of [[Jesus]] experienced mass revelation. The [[Lakota people]] believe [[White Buffalo Calf Woman|Ptes\u00e1\u014bwi\u014b]] spoke directly to the people in the establishment of Lakota religious traditions. Some versions of an [[Aztec mythology|Aztec legend]] tell of [[Huitzilopochtli]] speaking directly to the Aztec people upon their arrival at [[Anahuac (Aztec)|An\u00e5huac]]. Historically, some [[List of people who have been considered deities|emperors, cult leaders, and other figures]] have also been deified and treated as though their words are themselves revelations.\n\n==Methods==\n===Verbal===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}\nSome people hold that God can communicate with man in a way that gives direct, [[propositional]] content: This is termed ''verbal revelation''. [[Orthodox Judaism]] and some forms of Christianity hold that the first five books of [[Moses]] were dictated by God in such a fashion.\n\n===Non-verbal propositional===\nOne school of thought holds that revelation is non-verbal and non-literal, yet it may have propositional content. People were divinely inspired by God with a message, but not in a verbal-like fashion.\n\n[[Rabbi]] [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] has written, \"To convey what the prophets experienced, the Bible could either use terms of descriptions or terms of indication.  Any description o\nf the act of revelation in empirical categories would have produced a caricature.  That is why all the Bible does is to state that revelation happened; how it happened is something they could only convey in words that are evocative and suggestive.\"<ref>God in Search of Man</ref>\n\n[[Isaiah]] writes that he received his message through visions, where he would see [[YHWH]], the God of Israel, speaking to angelic beings that surrounded him. Isaiah would then write down the dialogue exchanged between YHWH and the angels. This form of revelation constitutes the major part of the text of the [[Book of Isaiah]]. The same formula of divine revelation is used by other prophets throughout the [[Tanakh]], such as Micaiah in [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20kings%2022:19-22&version=HCSB 1 Kings 22:19\u201322].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09a22.htm |title=1 Kings 22 / Hebrew \u2013 English Bible / Mechon-Mamre |publisher=Mechon-mamre.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-27}}</ref>{{Better source|date=November 2010}}\n\n==Epistemology==\nMembers of [[Abrahamic religions]], including Judaism, Christianity and Islam, believe that God exists and can in some way reveal his will to people. Members of those religions distinguish between true [[prophet]]s and [[false prophet]]s, and there are documents offering criteria by which to distinguish true from false prophets. The question of [[epistemology]] then arises: how to know?\n\nSome believe that revelation can originate directly from a [[deity]] or through an agent such as an [[angel]]. One who has experienced such contact with, or communication from, the divine is often called a prophet. An article (p.&nbsp;555) under the heading \"mysticism,\" and contributed by Ninian Smart, J.&nbsp;F. Rowny Professor of Comparative Religion, University of California, and President of the American Academy of Religion, writing in the 1999 edition of \"The Norton Dictionary of Modern Thought,\" (W.&nbsp;W. Norton & Co. Inc.), suggests that the more proper and wider term for such an encounter would be mystical, making such a person a [[mysticism|mystic]]. All prophets would be mystics, but not all mystics would be prophets.\n\nRevelation from a supernatural source is of lesser importance in some other religious traditions, such as [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]].\n\n==In various religions==\n\n===Bah\u00e1'\u00ed===\n{{Main|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed literature|Progressive revelation (Bah\u00e1'\u00ed)|}}\n[[File:Revelation-writing.jpg|thumb|'Revelation writing': The first draft of a tablet of [[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h]], recorded in shorthand script by an amanuensis]]\n[[B\u00e1b|The B\u00e1b]], [[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h]] and [[`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1]] received thousands of written enquiries, and wrote thousands of responses, hundreds of which amount to whole and proper books, while many are shorter texts, such as letters.

[[2 Timothy]] {{bibleverse-nb|2|Timothy|3:16|ESV}} says: \"All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness\". The [[Second Epistle of Peter]] claims that \"no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the [[Holy Spirit]]\" ({{bibleverse|2|Peter|1:20\u201321|ESV}}).

The Catholic Church recognizes 73 books as inspired and forming the Bible (46 books of the [[Development of the Old Testament canon|Old Testament]] and 27 books of the [[Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament]]). The most common versions of the Bible that [[Protestant]]s have today consist of 66 of these books. None of the 66 or 73 books gives a list of revealed books.\n\nTheologian and Christian existentialist philosopher [[Paul Johannes Tillich]] (1886\u20131965), who sought to correlate culture and faith so that \"faith need not be unacceptable to contemporary culture and contemporary culture need not be unacceptable to faith\", argued that revelation never runs counter to reason (affirming [[Thomas Aquinas]] who said that faith is eminently rational), and that both poles of the subjective human experience are complementary.<ref>Systematic Theology I, by Paul Tillich, University of Chicago Press, 205. 0-226803-37-6. {{cite book|title=Systematic Theology|author=Paul Tillich|page=307|isbn=0-226-80336-8}}</ref>\n\n[[Karl Barth]] argued that God is the object of God\u2019s own self-knowledge, and revelation in the Bible means the self-unveiling to humanity of the God who cannot be discovered by humanity simply through its own efforts. For him, the Bible is not ''The Revelation''; rather, it points to revelation. Human concepts can never be considered as identical to God's revelation, and Scripture is written in human language, expressing human concepts. It cannot be considered identical with God's revelation. However, God does reveal himself through human language and concepts, and thus Christ is truly presented in scripture and the preaching of the church.\n\n====Latter-day Saint movement====\n{{Main|Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|Joseph Smith|Prophet, seer, and revelator}}\n[[File:Joseph Smith receiving golden plates.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Engraving|An 1893 engraving of [[Joseph Smith]] receiving the [[golden plates]] and other artifacts from the [[angel Moroni]].]]\nThis denomination believes that the president of the Church receives revelation directly from God for the direction of the church.

Church leaders (from the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]]) have taught during the church's [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conferences]] that conference talks which are \"\u2026[spoken as] moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture\u2026\".<ref>Doctrine and Covenants 68:4</ref> In addition, many Latter-day Saints believe that ancient prophets in other regions of the world received revelations that resulted in additional scriptures that have been lost and may, one day, be forthcoming.

In the meridian of time, Paul described prophets and apostles in terms of a foundation, with Christ as the cornerstone, which was built to prevent doctrinal shift\u2014\"that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about by every wind of doctrine\" (Eph 2:20 and 4:11\u201314, see also Matt 16:17\u201318). To maintain this foundation, new apostles were chosen and ordained to replace those lost to death or transgression, as when Matthias was called by revelation to replace Judas (Acts 1:15\u201326). However, as intensifying persecution led to the imprisonment and martyrdom of the apostles, it eventually became impossible to continue the apostolic succession.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-16-the-church-of-jesus-christ-in-former-times?lang=eng |title=Gospel Principles Chapter 16: The Church of Jesus Christ in Former Times |publisher=churchofjesuschrist.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}</ref> Once the foundation of apostles and prophets was lost, the integrity of Christian doctrine as established by Christ and the apostles began to be compromised by those who continued to develop doctrine despite not being called or authorized to receive revelation for the body of the church. In the absence of revelation, these post-apostolic theologians couldn\u2019t help but introduce elements of human reasoning, speculation, and personal interpretation of scripture (2 Pet 1:19\u201320)\u2014which over time led to the loss or corruption of various doctrinal truths, as well as the addition of new man-made doctrines. This naturally led to much disagreement and schism, which over the centuries culminated in the large number of Christian churches on the earth today. Mormons believe that God resumed his pattern of revelation when the world was again ready, by calling the Prophet Joseph Smith to restore the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-17-the-church-of-jesus-christ-today?lang=eng |title=Gospel Principles Chapter 17: The Church of Jesus Christ Today |publisher=churchofjesuschrist.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}</ref> Since that time there has been a consistent succession of prophets and apostles, which God has promised will not be broken before the Second Coming of Christ (Dan 2:44).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/church-organization/the-church-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng |title=The Church of Jesus Christ |publisher=churchofjesuschrist.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}</ref>\n\nEach member of the LDS Church is also confirmed a member of the church following baptism and given the \"gift of the Holy Ghost\" by which each member is encouraged to develop a personal relationship with that divine being and receive personal revelation for their own direction and that of their family. The [[Latter Day Saint]] concept of revelation includes the belief that revelation from God is available to all those who earnestly seek it with the intent of doing good. It also teaches that everyone is entitled to ''personal'' revelation with respect to his or her [[stewardship]] (leadership responsibility). Thus, parents may receive inspiration from God in raising their families, individuals can receive divine inspiration to help them meet personal challenges, church officers may receive revelation for those whom they serve, and so forth.\n\nThe important consequence of this is that each person may receive confirmation that particular doctrines taught by a prophet are true, as well as gain divine insight in using those truths for their own benefit and eternal progress. In the church, personal revelation is expected and encouraged, and many converts believe that personal revelation from God was instrumental in their conversion.<ref>{{cite web | title=Continuing Revelation | work=Mormon.org | url=http://www.mormon.org/learn/0,8672,1084-1,00.html | accessdate=August 5, 2005}}</ref> [[Joseph F.

His major work, ''Star of Redemption'', expounds a philosophy in which he portrays the relationships between God, humanity and world as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption.\nConservative Jewish philosophers [[Elliot N. Dorff]] and [[Neil Gillman]] take the existentialist philosophy of Rosenzweig as one of their starting points for understanding [[Jewish philosophy]]. (They come to different conclusions, however.)\n\nRabbinic Judaism, and contemporary [[Orthodox Judaism]], hold that the [[Torah]] (Pentateuch) extant today is essentially the same one that the whole of the Jewish people received on [[Mount Sinai]], from God, upon their Exodus from Egypt.<ref>Rabbi Nechemia Coopersmith and Rabbi Moshe Zeldman: [http://www.aish.com/shavuotsinai/shavuotsinaidefault/Did_God_Speak_at_Sinai$_.asp \"Did God Speak at Sinai\"], Aish HaTorah</ref> Beliefs that God gave a \"Torah of truth\" to Moses (and the rest of the people), that Moses was the greatest of the prophets, and that the Law given to Moses will never be changed, are three of the [[Thirteen Principles of Faith]] of Orthodox Judaism according to [[Maimonides]].\n\nOrthodox Judaism believes that in addition to the written Torah, God also revealed to Moses a set of oral teachings, called the [[Oral Torah]]. In addition to this revealed law, [[Halakha|Jewish law]] contains decrees and enactments made by prophets, rabbis, and sages over the course of Jewish history. [[Haredi Judaism]] tends to regard even rabbinic decrees as being of divine origin or divinely inspired, while [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] tends to regard them as being more potentially subject to human error, although due to the Biblical verse \"Do not stray from their words\" (\"Deuteronomy 17:11) it is still accepted as binding law.\n\n[[Conservative Judaism]] tends to regard both the Torah and the Oral law as not verbally revealed. The Conservative approach tends to regard the Torah as compiled by redactors in a manner similar to the [[Documentary Hypothesis]]. However, Conservative Jews also regard the authors of the Torah as divinely inspired, and many regard at least portions of it as originating with Moses. Positions can vary from the position of [[Joel Roth]], following [[David Weiss HaLivni]], that while the Torah originally given to Moses on Mount Sinai became corrupted or lost and had to be recompiled later by redactors, the recompiled Torah is nonetheless regarded as fully Divine and legally authoritative, to the position of [[Gordon Tucker]] that the Torah, while Divinely inspired, is a largely human document containing significant elements of human error, and should be regarded as the beginning of an ongoing process which is continuing today.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Conservative Judaism regards the Oral Law as divinely inspired, but nonetheless subject to human error.\n\nReform and Reconstructionist Jews also accept the Documentary Hypothesis for the origin of the Torah, and tend to view all of the Oral law as an entirely human creation. [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] believe that the Torah is not a [[direct revelation]] from God, but is a document written by human ancestors, carrying human understanding and experience, and seeking to answer the question: 'What does God require of us?'. They believe that, though it contains many 'core-truths' about God and humanity, it is also time bound. They believe that God's will is revealed through the interaction of humanity and God throughout history, and so, in that sense, Torah is a product of an ongoing revelation. [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] denies the notion of revelation entirely.\n\n====Prophets====\nAlthough the [[Nevi'im]] (the books of the Prophets) are considered divine and true, this does not imply that the books of the prophets are always read literally. Jewish tradition has always held that prophets used metaphors and analogies. There exists a wide range of commentaries explaining and elucidating those verses consisting of metaphor. [[Rabbinic Judaism]] regards Moses as the greatest of the prophets, and this view is one of the [[Thirteen Principles of Faith]] of traditional Judaism. Consistent with the view that revelation to Moses was generally clearer than revelation to other prophets, Orthodox views of revelation to prophets other than Moses have included a range of perspectives as to directness. For example, [[Maimonides]] in ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' said that accounts of revelation in the Nevi'im were not always as literal as in the [[Torah]] and that some prophetic accounts reflect allegories rather than literal commands or predictions.\n\n[[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[Rabbi]] and [[Jewish philosophy|philosopher]] [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] (1907\u20131972), author of a number of works on prophecy, said that, \"Prophetic inspiration must be understood ''as an event'', not as ''a process''.\"<ref>{{cite book | author=Heschel, Abraham Joshua | title=God in Search of Man: A Philosophy of Judaism | publisher=Noonday | year=1955 | isbn=0-374-51331-7 | page=[https://archive.org/details/godinsearchofman0000hesc/page/209 209] | url=https://archive.org/details/godinsearchofman0000hesc/page/209 }}</ref> In his work ''[[God in Search of Man]]'', he discussed the experience of being a prophet. In his book ''Prophetic Inspiration After the Prophets: Maimonides and Others'', Heschel references to continued prophetic inspiration in Jewish [[rabbinic literature]] following the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and into medieval and even Modern times. He wrote that\n\n:\"To convey what the prophets experienced, the Bible could either use terms of descriptions or terms of indication.

In  ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' (1794\u20131809), [[Thomas Paine]] develops the theology of [[deism]], rejecting the possibility of [[miracle]]s and arguing that a revelation can be considered valid only for the original recipient, with all else being [[hearsay]].<ref>{{cite book\n|last = Paine\n|first = Thomas\n|authorlink = Thomas Paine\n|origyear = 1794\n|year = 1987\n|editor1-last = Foot\n|editor1-first = Michael\n|editor1-link = Michael Foot\n|editor2-last = Kramnick\n|editor2-first = Isaac\n|title = The Thomas Paine Reader\n|url = https://books.google.com/?id=GDRt70vGw9YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Michael+Foot%22#v=onepage&q=\n|page = 403\n|publisher = Penguin Books\n|location = New York\n|isbn = 0-14-044496-3}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}\n\n===Individual revelation===\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] believed in two types of individual revelation from [[God in Christianity|God]], ''[[general revelation]]'' and ''[[special revelation]]''. In [[general revelation]], God reveals himself through his creation, such that at least some truths about God can be learned by the [[empiricism|empirical]] study of nature, [[physics]], [[cosmology]], etc., to an individual. Special revelation is the knowledge of God and spiritual matters which can be discovered through [[supernatural]] means, such as scripture or miracles, by individuals. [[Direct revelation]] refers to communication from God to someone in particular.\n\nThough one may deduce the existence of God and some of God's attributes through general revelation, certain specifics may be known only through special revelation. Aquinas believed that special revelation is equivalent to the revelation of God in Jesus. The major theological components of Christianity, such as the [[Trinity]] and the [[Incarnation]], are revealed in the teachings of the church and the scriptures and may not otherwise be deduced. Special revelation and natural revelation are complementary rather than contradictory in nature.\n\n\"[[Continuous revelation]]\" is a term for the theological position that God continues to reveal divine principles or commandments to humanity.\n\nIn the 20th century, religious [[existentialist]]s proposed that revelation held no content in and of itself but rather that God inspired people with his presence by coming into contact with them. Revelation is a human response that records how we respond to God.\n\n===Public revelation===\n[[File:The Ten Commandments (Bible Card).jpg|thumb|right|upright|100px|The mass-revelation at the [[Mount Horeb]] in an illustration from a Christian Bible card published by the Providence Lithograph Company, 1907]]\nSome religious groups believe a deity has been revealed or spoken to a large group of people or have legends to a similar effect. In the [[Book of Deuteronomy]], [[Yahweh]] is said to have been revealed upon giving the [[Ten Commandments]] to the [[Israelites]] at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. In [[Christianity]], the [[Book of Acts]] describes the [[Pentecost|Day of Pentecost]] wherein a large group of the followers of [[Jesus]] experienced mass revelation. The [[Lakota people]] believe [[White Buffalo Calf Woman|Ptes\u00e1\u014bwi\u014b]] spoke directly to the people in the establishment of Lakota religious traditions. Some versions of an [[Aztec mythology|Aztec legend]] tell of [[Huitzilopochtli]] speaking directly to the Aztec people upon their arrival at [[Anahuac (Aztec)|An\u00e5huac]]. Historically, some [[List of people who have been considered deities|emperors, cult leaders, and other figures]] have also been deified and treated as though their words are themselves revelations.\n\n==Methods==\n===Verbal===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}\nSome people hold that God can communicate with man in a way that gives direct, [[propositional]] content: This is termed ''verbal revelation''. [[Orthodox Judaism]] and some forms of Christianity hold that the first five books of [[Moses]] were dictated by God in such a fashion.\n\n===Non-verbal propositional===\nOne school of thought holds that revelation is non-verbal and non-literal, yet it may have propositional content. People were divinely inspired by God with a message, but not in a verbal-like fashion.\n\n[[Rabbi]] [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] has written, \"To convey what the prophets experienced, the Bible could either use terms of descriptions or terms of indication.  Any description of the act of revelation in empirical categories would have produced a caricature.  That is why all the Bible does is to state that revelation happened; how it happened is something they could only convey in words that are evocative and suggestive.\"<ref>God in Search of Man</ref>\n\n[[Isaiah]] writes that he received his message through visions, where he would see [[YHWH]], the God of Israel, speaking to angelic beings that surrounded him. Isaiah would then write down the dialogue exchanged between YHWH and the angels. This form of revelation constitutes the major part of the text of the [[Book of Isaiah]]. The same formula of divine revelation is used by other prophets throughout the [[Tanakh]], such as Micaiah in [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20kings%2022:19-22&version=HCSB 1 Kings 22:19\u201322].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09a22.htm |title=1 Kings 22 / Hebrew \u2013 English Bible / Mechon-Mamre |publisher=Mechon-mamre.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-27}}</ref>{{Better source|date=November 2010}}\n\n==Epistemology==\nMembers of [[Abrahamic religions]], including Judaism, Christianity and Islam, believe that God exists and can in some way reveal his will to people. Members of those religions distinguish between true [[prophet]]s and [[false prophet]]s, and there are documents offering criteria by which to distinguish true from false prophets. The question of [[epistemology]] then arises: how to know?\n\nSome believe that revelation can originate directly from a [[deity]] or through an agent such as an [[angel]]. One who has experienced such contact with, or communication from, the divine is often called a prophet. An article (p.&nbsp;555) under the heading \"mysticism,\" and contributed by Ninian Smart, J.&nbsp;F. Rowny Professor of Comparative Religion, University of California, and President of the American Academy of Religion, writing in the 1999 edition of \"The Norton Dictionary of Modern Thought,\" (W.&nbsp;W. Norton & Co. Inc.), suggests that the more proper and wider term for such an encounter would be mystical, making such a person a [[mysticism|mystic]]. All prophets would be mystics, but not all mystics would be prophets.\n\nRevelation from a supernatural source is of lesser importance in some other religious traditions, such as [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]].\n\n==In various religions==\n\n===Bah\u00e1'\u00ed===\n{{Main|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed literature|Progressive revelation (Bah\u00e1'\u00ed)|}}\n[[File:Revelation-writing.jpg|thumb|'Revelation writing': The first draft of a tablet of [[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h]], recorded in shorthand script by an amanuensis]]\n[[B\u00e1b|The B\u00e1b]], [[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h]] and [[`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1]] received thousands of written enquiries, and wrote thousands of responses, hundreds of which amount to whole and proper books, while many are shorter texts, such as letters.

The most common versions of the Bible that [[Protestant]]s have today consist of 66 of these books. None of the 66 or 73 books gives a list of revealed books.\n\nTheologian and Christian existentialist philosopher [[Paul Johannes Tillich]] (1886\u20131965), who sought to correlate culture and faith so that \"faith need not be unacceptable to contemporary culture and contemporary culture need not be unacceptable to faith\", argued that revelation never runs counter to reason (affirming [[Thomas Aquinas]] who said that faith is eminently rational), and that both poles of the subjective human experience are complementary.<ref>Systematic Theology I, by Paul Tillich, University of Chicago Press, 205. 0-226803-37-6. {{cite book|title=Systematic Theology|author=Paul Tillich|page=307|isbn=0-226-80336-8}}</ref>\n\n[[Karl Barth]] argued that God is the object of God\u2019s own self-knowledge, and revelation in the Bible means the self-unveiling to humanity of the God who cannot be discovered by humanity simply through its own efforts. For him, the Bible is not ''The Revelation''; rather, it points to revelation. Human concepts can never be considered as identical to God's revelation, and Scripture is written in human language, expressing human concepts. It cannot be considered identical with God's revelation. However, God does reveal himself through human language and concepts, and thus Christ is truly presented in scripture and the preaching of the church.\n\n====Latter-day Saint movement====\n{{Main|Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|Joseph Smith|Prophet, seer, and revelator}}\n[[File:Joseph Smith receiving golden plates.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Engraving|An 1893 engraving of [[Joseph Smith]] receiving the [[golden plates]] and other artifacts from the [[angel Moroni]].]]\nThis denomination believes that the president of the Church receives revelation directly from God for the direction of the church.

Church leaders (from the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]]) have taught during the church's [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conferences]] that conference talks which are \"\u2026[spoken as] moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture\u2026\".<ref>Doctrine and Covenants 68:4</ref> In addition, many Latter-day Saints believe that ancient prophets in other regions of the world received revelations that resulted in additional scriptures that have been lost and may, one day, be forthcoming. Hence, the belief in [[continuing revelation]]. Latter-day Saints also believe that the [[United States Constitution]] is a divinely inspired document.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1992/02/the-divinely-inspired-constitution?lang=eng |title=The Divinely Inspired Constitution |author=Dallin H.

In the meridian of time, Paul described prophets and apostles in terms of a foundation, with Christ as the cornerstone, which was built to prevent doctrinal shift\u2014\"that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about by every wind of doctrine\" (Eph 2:20 and 4:11\u201314, see also Matt 16:17\u201318). To maintain this foundation, new apostles were chosen and ordained to replace those lost to death or transgression, as when Matthias was called by revelation to replace Judas (Acts 1:15\u201326). However, as intensifying persecution led to the imprisonment and martyrdom of the apostles, it eventually became impossible to continue the apostolic succession.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-16-the-church-of-jesus-christ-in-former-times?lang=eng |title=Gospel Principles Chapter 16: The Church of Jesus Christ in Former Times |publisher=churchofjesuschrist.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}</ref> Once the foundation of apostles and prophets was lost, the integrity of Christian doctrine as established by Christ and the apostles began to be compromised by those who continued to develop doctrine despite not being called or authorized to receive revelation for the body of the church. In the absence of revelation, these post-apostolic theologians couldn\u2019t help but introduce elements of human reasoning, speculation, and personal interpretation of scripture (2 Pet 1:19\u201320)\u2014which over time led to the loss or corruption of various doctrinal truths, as well as the addition of new man-made doctrines. This naturally led to much disagreement and schism, which over the centuries culminated in the large number of Christian churches on the earth today. Mormons believe that God resumed his pattern of revelation when the world was again ready, by calling the Prophet Joseph Smith to restore the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-17-the-church-of-jesus-christ-today?lang=eng |title=Gospel Principles Chapter 17: The Church of Jesus Christ Today |publisher=churchofjesuschrist.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}</ref> Since that time there has been a consistent succession of prophets and apostles, which God has promised will not be broken before the Second Coming of Christ (Dan 2:44).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/church-organization/the-church-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng |title=The Church of Jesus Christ |publisher=churchofjesuschrist.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}</ref>\n\nEach member of the LDS Church is also confirmed a member of the church following baptism and given the \"gift of the Holy Ghost\" by which each member is encouraged to develop a personal relationship with that divine being and receive personal revelation for their own direction and that of their family. The [[Latter Day Saint]] concept of revelation includes the belief that revelation from God is available to all those who earnestly seek it with the intent of doing good. It also teaches that everyone is entitled to ''personal'' revelation with respect to his or her [[stewardship]] (leadership responsibility). Thus, parents may receive inspiration from God in raising their families, individuals can receive divine inspiration to help them meet personal challenges, church officers may receive revelation for those whom they serve, and so forth.\n\nThe important consequence of this is that each person may receive confirmation that particular doctrines taught by a prophet are true, as well as gain divine insight in using those truths for their own benefit and eternal progress. In the church, personal revelation is expected and encouraged, and many converts believe that personal revelation from God was instrumental in their conversion.<ref>{{cite web | title=Continuing Revelation | work=Mormon.org | url=http://www.mormon.org/learn/0,8672,1084-1,00.html | accessdate=August 5, 2005}}</ref> [[Joseph F.

Muslims believe that Islam is the oldest of the monotheistic religions because it represents both the original and the final revelation of God to [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[David]], [[Jesus]], and Muhammad.<ref>Esposito (2002b), pp.4\u20135</ref><ref>{{Quran-usc|42|13}}</ref> Likewise, Muslims believe that every [[prophet]] received revelation in their lives, as each prophet was sent by God to guide mankind. [[Jesus]] is significant in this aspect as he received revelation in a twofold aspect, as Muslims believe he preached the [[Injil|Gospel]] while also having been taught the [[Torah]].\n\nAccording to Islamic traditions, Muhammad began receiving revelations from the age of 40, delivered through the angel Gabriel over the last 23 years of his life. The content of these revelations, known as the Qur'an,<ref>The term ''Qur'an'' was first used in the Qur'an itself. There are two different theories about this term and its formation that are discussed in [[Quran#Etymology]]</ref> was memorized and recorded by his followers and compiled from dozens of [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|hafiz]] as well as other various parchments or hides into a single volume shortly after his death. In [[Muslim theology]], Muhammad is considered equal in importance to all other [[Prophets in Islam|prophets of God]] and to make distinction among the prophets is a [[sin]], as the Qur'an itself promulgates equality between God's prophets.(Qur'an 3:84)\n\nMany [[scholar]]s have made the distinction between revelation and [[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]], which according to Muslim theology, all righteous people can receive. Inspiration refers to God inspiring a person to commit some action, as opposed to revelation, which only the prophets received. Moses's mother, [[Jochebed]], being inspired to send the infant Moses in a cradle down the [[Nile river]] is a frequently cited example of inspiration, as is [[Hagar]] searching for water for the infant [[Ishmael]].\n\n===Judaism===\n{{Main|Jewish principles of faith}}\n{{Redirect|Mattan Torah|text=Mattan Torah is \"the gift of Torah\". For [[Z'man Mattan Torah]] (\"the time of the giving of the Torah\"), see [[Shavuot]]}}\n\nThe term \"revelation\" is used in two senses in Jewish theology; it either denotes (1) what in rabbinical language is called \"Gilluy Shekinah,\" a manifestation of God by some wondrous act of His which overawes man and impresses him with what he sees, hears, or otherwise perceives of His glorious presence; or it denotes (2) a manifestation of His will through oracular words, signs, statutes, or laws.<ref name=je>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12713-revelation |title=\"Revelation\", Jewish Encyclopedia |publisher=Jewishencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Judaism]], issues of epistemology have been addressed by [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophers]] such as [[Saadiah Gaon]] (882\u2013942) in his [[Emunoth ve-Deoth|Book of Beliefs and Opinions]]; [[Maimonides]] (1135\u20131204) in his [[Guide for the Perplexed]]; [[Hugo Bergmann|Samuel Hugo Berman]], professor of philosophy at the Hebrew University; [[Joseph Dov Soloveitchik]] (1903\u20131993), talmudic scholar and philosopher; [[Neil Gillman]], professor of philosophy at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], and [[Elliot N. Dorff]], professor of philosophy at the [[American Jewish University]].\n\nOne of the major trends in modern Jewish philosophy was the attempt to develop a theory of Judaism through existentialism. One of the primary players in this field was [[Franz Rosenzweig]]. His major work, ''Star of Redemption'', expounds a philosophy in which he portrays the relationships between God, humanity and world as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption.\nConservative Jewish philosophers [[Elliot N. Dorff]] and [[Neil Gillman]] take the existentialist philosophy of Rosenzweig as one of their starting points for understanding [[Jewish philosophy]]. (They come to different conclusions, however.)\n\nRabbinic Judaism, and contemporary [[Orthodox Judaism]], hold that the [[Torah]] (Pentateuch) extant today is essentially the same one that the whole of the Jewish people received on [[Mount Sinai]], from God, upon their Exodus from Egypt.<ref>Rabbi Nechemia Coopersmith and Rabbi Moshe Zeldman: [http://www.aish.com/shavuotsinai/shavuotsinaidefault/Did_God_Speak_at_Sinai$_.asp \"Did God Speak at Sinai\"], Aish HaTorah</ref> Beliefs that God gave a \"Torah of truth\" to Moses (and the rest of the people), that Moses was the greatest of the prophets, and that the Law given to Moses will never be changed, are three of the [[Thirteen Principles of Faith]] of Orthodox Judaism according to [[Maimonides]].\n\nOrthodox Judaism believes that in addition to the written Torah, God also revealed to Moses a set of oral teachings, called the [[Oral Torah]]. In addition to this revealed law, [[Halakha|Jewish law]] contains decrees and enactments made by prophets, rabbis, and sages over the course of Jewish history. [[Haredi Judaism]] tends to regard even rabbinic decrees as being of divine origin or divinely inspired, while [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] tends to regard them as being more potentially subject to human error, although due to the Biblical verse \"Do not stray from their words\" (\"Deuteronomy 17:11) it is still accepted as binding law.\n\n[[Conservative Judaism]] tends to regard both the Torah and the Oral law as not verbally revealed. The Conservative approach tends to regard the Torah as compiled by redactors in a manner similar to the [[Documentary Hypothesis]]. However, Conservative Jews also regard the authors of the Torah as divinely inspired, and many regard at least portions of it as originating with Moses. Positions can vary from the position of [[Joel Roth]], following [[David Weiss HaLivni]], that while the Torah originally given to Moses on Mount Sinai became corrupted or lost and had to be recompiled later by redactors, the recompiled Torah is nonetheless regarded as fully Divine and legally authoritative, to the position of [[Gordon Tucker]] that the Torah, while Divinely inspired, is a largely human document containing significant elements of human error, and should be regarded as the beginning of an ongoing process which is continuing today.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Conservative Judaism regards the Oral Law as divinely inspired, but nonetheless subject to human error.\n\nReform and Reconstructionist Jews also accept the Documentary Hypothesis for the origin of the Torah, and tend to view all of the Oral law as an entirely human creation. [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] believe that the Torah is not a [[direct revelation]] from God, but is a document written by human ancestors, carrying human understanding and experience, and seeking to answer the question: 'What does God require of us?'. They believe that, though it contains many 'core-truths' about God and humanity, it is also time bound. They believe that God's will is revealed through the interaction of humanity and God throughout history, and so, in that sense, Torah is a product of an ongoing revelation. [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] denies the notion of revelation entirely.\n\n====Prophets====\nAlthough the [[Nevi'im]] (the books of the Prophets) are considered divine and true, this does not imply that the books of the prophets are always read literally. Jewish tradition has always held that prophets used metaphors and analogies. There exists a wide range of commentaries explaining and elucidating those verses consisting of metaphor. [[Rabbinic Judaism]] regards Moses as the greatest of the prophets, and this view is one of the [[Thirteen Principles of Faith]] of traditional Judaism. Consistent with the view that revelation to Moses was generally clearer than revelation to other prophets, Orthodox views of revelation to prophets other than Moses have included a range of perspectives as to directness. For example, [[Maimonides]] in ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' said that accounts of revelation in the Nevi'im were not always as literal as in the [[Torah]] and that some prophetic accounts reflect allegories rather than literal commands or predictions.\n\n[[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[Rabbi]] and [[Jewish philosophy|philosopher]] [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] (1907\u20131972), author of a number of works on prophecy, said that, \"Prophetic inspiration must be understood ''as an event'', not as ''a process''.\"<ref>{{cite book | author=Heschel, Abraham Joshua | title=God in Search of Man: A Philosophy of Judaism | publisher=Noonday | year=1955 | isbn=0-374-51331-7 | page=[https://archive.org/details/godinsearchofman0000hesc/page/209 209] | url=https://archive.org/details/godinsearchofman0000hesc/page/209 }}</ref> In his work ''[[God in Search of Man]]'', he discussed the experience of being a prophet. In his book ''Prophetic Inspiration After the Prophets: Maimonides and Others'', Heschel references to continued prophetic inspiration in Jewish [[rabbinic literature]] following the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and into medieval and even Modern times. He wrote that\n\n:\"To convey what the prophets experienced, the Bible could either use terms of descriptions or terms of indication.

In 1803, he lobbied Congress to suspend Article VI of the [[Northwest Ordinance]] for 10 years, a move that would allow slavery in the Indiana Territory. At the end of the suspension period, citizens in the territories covered under the ordinance could decide for themselves whether to permit slavery.

Tenskwatawa convinced the tribes that they would be protected by the [[Great Spirit]] and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the settlers. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to pay white traders only half of what they owed and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|pp=158\u2013160}}\n\n[[File:Tecumseh02.jpg|thumb|upright|1915 depiction of Tecumseh, believed to be copying an 1808 sketch]]\n\nIn August 1810, Tecumseh led 400 warriors down the [[Wabash River]] to meet with Harrison in Vincennes. They were dressed in war paint, and their sudden appearance at first frightened the soldiers at Vincennes. The leaders of the group were escorted to Grouseland, where they met Harrison. Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne Treaty was illegitimate, arguing that one tribe could not sell land without the approval of the other tribes; he asked Harrison to nullify it and warned that Americans should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Tecumseh informed Harrison that he had threatened to kill the chiefs who signed the treaty if they carried out its terms and that his confederation of tribes was growing rapidly.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|p=164}} Harrison said that the Miamis were the owners of the land and could sell it if they so chose. He rejected Tecumseh's claim that all the Indians formed one nation. He said that each tribe could have separate relations with the United States if they chose to. Harrison argued that the Great Spirit would have made all the tribes speak one language if they were to be one nation.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|p=165}}\n\nTecumseh launched an \"impassioned rebuttal\", in the words of one historian, but Harrison was unable to understand his language.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|p=165}} A Shawnee friendly to Harrison cocked his pistol from the sidelines to alert Harrison that Tecumseh's speech was leading to trouble, and some witnesses reported that Tecumseh was encouraging the warriors to kill Harrison.

Harrison drew his sword, and Tecumseh's warriors backed down when the officers presented their firearms in his defense.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|p=165}} Chief [[Winamac]] was friendly to Harrison, and he countered Tecumseh's arguments and told the warriors that they should return home in peace since they had come in peace. Before leaving, Tecumseh informed Harrison that he would seek an alliance with the British if the treaty was not nullified.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|p=166}} After the meeting, Tecumseh journeyed to meet with many of the tribes in the region, hoping to create a [[Tecumseh's Confederacy|confederation]] to battle the United States.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|pp=164\u2013169}}\n\nTecumseh was traveling in 1811 when Harrison was authorized by Secretary of War [[William Eustis]] to march against the confederation as a show of force. He led an army north with more than 1,000 men to intimidate the Shawnee into making peace, but the tribes launched a surprise attack early on November 7 in the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]]. Harrison defeated the tribal forces at [[Prophetstown State Park|Prophetstown]] next to the Wabash and [[Tippecanoe River]]s, and he was hailed as a national hero and the battle became famous. However, his troops had greatly outnumbered the attackers, and suffered many more casualties during the battle.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|pp=167\u2013169}}\n\nWhen reporting to Secretary Eustis, Harrison informed him that the battle occurred near the Tippecanoe River and that he feared an imminent reprisal attack.

When no second attack came, the Shawnee defeat was more certain. Eustis demanded to know why Harrison had not taken adequate precautions in fortifying his camp against attacks, and Harrison said that he had considered the position strong enough. The dispute was the catalyst of a disagreement between Harrison and the Department of War which continued into the War of 1812.{{sfn|Owens|2007|pp=219\u2013220}}\n\nThe press did not cover the battle at first, and one Ohio paper misinterpreted Harrison's first dispatch to mean that he was defeated.{{sfn|Owens|2007|p=220}} By December, however, most major American papers carried stories on the battle, and public outrage grew over the Shawnee. Americans blamed the British for inciting the tribes to violence and supplying them with firearms, and Congress passed resolutions condemning the British for interfering in American domestic affairs.

He named it [[Fort Meigs]] in honor of Ohio governor [[Return J. Meigs Jr.]]. He received reinforcements in 1813, then took the offensive and led the army north to battle.

The 1804 [[Treaty of St. Louis (1804)|Treaty of St. Louis]] with [[Quashquame]] required the [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Meskwaki]] tribes to cede much of western Illinois and parts of [[Missouri]] to the federal government. Many of the Sauk greatly resented this treaty and the loss of lands, especially [[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]], and this was a primary reason that they sided with the British during the [[War of 1812]]. Harrison thought that the [[Treaty of Grouseland]] (1805) appeased some of the Indians, but tensions remained high along the frontier. The [[Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809)]] raised new tensions when Harrison purchased more than 2.5 million acres (10,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) inhabited by the [[Shawnee]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], [[Wea]], and [[Piankeshaw]] tribes; he purchased the land from the [[Miami tribe]], who claimed ownership.

He was unsuccessful due to the territory's growing anti-slavery movement. In 1803, he lobbied Congress to suspend Article VI of the [[Northwest Ordinance]] for 10 years, a move that would allow slavery in the Indiana Territory. At the end of the suspension period, citizens in the territories covered under the ordinance could decide for themselves whether to permit slavery. Harrison claimed that the suspension was necessary to encourage settlement and would make the territory economically viable, but Congress rejected the idea.{{sfn|Owens|2007|pp=68\u201369}} In 1803 and 1805, Harrison and the appointed territorial judges enacted laws that authorized indentured servitude and gave masters authority to determine the length of service.{{sfn|Owens|2007|pp=69\u201372}}{{sfn|Barnhart|Riker|1971|p=347}}\n\nThe [[Illinois Territory]] held elections to the legislature's upper and lower houses for the first time in 1809.

Jefferson did not want slavery to expand into the Northwest Territory, as he believed that the institution should end. He donated money to Lemen to found churches in Illinois and Indiana to stop the pro-slavery movement. In [[Indiana]], the founding of an anti-slavery church led to citizens signing a petition and organizing politically to defeat Harrison's efforts to legalize slavery in the territory.

Tenskwatawa convinced the tribes that they would be protected by the [[Great Spirit]] and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the settlers. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to pay white traders only half of what they owed and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|pp=158\u2013160}}\n\n[[File:Tecumseh02.jpg|thumb|upright|1915 depiction of Tecumseh, believed to be copying an 1808 sketch]]\n\nIn August 1810, Tecumseh led 400 warriors down the [[Wabash River]] to meet with Harrison in Vincennes. They were dressed in war paint, and their sudden appearance at first frightened the soldiers at Vincennes. The leaders of the group were escorted to Grouseland, where they met Harrison. Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne Treaty was illegitimate, arguing that one tribe could not sell land without the approval of the other tribes; he asked Harrison to nullify it and warned that Americans should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Tecumseh informed Harrison that he had threatened to kill the chiefs who signed the treaty if they carried out its terms and that his confederation of tribes was growing rapidly.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|p=164}} Harrison said that the Miamis were the owners of the land and could sell it if they so chose. He rejected Tecumseh's claim that all the Indians formed one nation. He said that each tribe could have separate relations with the United States if they chose to. Harrison argued that the Great Spirit would have made all the tribes speak one language if they were to be one nation.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|p=165}}\n\nTecumseh launched an \"impassioned rebuttal\", in the words of one historian, but Harrison was unable to understand his language.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|p=165}} A Shawnee friendly to Harrison cocked his pistol from the sidelines to alert Harrison that Tecumseh's speech was leading to trouble, and some witnesses reported that Tecumseh was encouraging the warriors to kill Harrison.

Harrison drew his sword, and Tecumseh's warriors backed down when the officers presented their firearms in his defense.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|p=165}} Chief [[Winamac]] was friendly to Harrison, and he countered Tecumseh's arguments and told the warriors that they should return home in peace since they had come in peace. Before leaving, Tecumseh informed Harrison that he would seek an alliance with the British if the treaty was not nullified.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|p=166}} After the meeting, Tecumseh journeyed to meet with many of the tribes in the region, hoping to create a [[Tecumseh's Confederacy|confederation]] to battle the United States.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|pp=164\u2013169}}\n\nTecumseh was traveling in 1811 when Harrison was authorized by Secretary of War [[William Eustis]] to march against the confederation as a show of force. He led an army north with more than 1,000 men to intimidate the Shawnee into making peace, but the tribes launched a surprise attack early on November 7 in the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]]. Harrison defeated the tribal forces at [[Prophetstown State Park|Prophetstown]] next to the Wabash and [[Tippecanoe River]]s, and he was hailed as a national hero and the battle became famous. However, his troops had greatly outnumbered the attackers, and suffered many more casualties during the battle.{{sfn|Langguth|2007|pp=167\u2013169}}\n\nWhen reporting to Secretary Eustis, Harrison informed him that the battle occurred near the Tippecanoe River and that he feared an imminent reprisal attack. The first dispatch did not make clear which side had won the conflict, and the secretary at first interpreted it as a defeat; the follow-up dispatch clarified the situation. When no second attack came, the Shawnee defeat was more certain. Eustis demanded to know why Harrison had not taken adequate precautions in fortifying his camp against attacks, and Harrison said that he had considered the position strong enough. The dispute was the catalyst of a disagreement between Harrison and the Department of War which continued into the War of 1812.{{sfn|Owens|2007|pp=219\u2013220}}\n\nThe press did not cover the battle at first, and one Ohio paper misinterpreted Harrison's first dispatch to mean that he was defeated.{{sfn|Owens|2007|p=220}} By December, however, most major American papers carried stories on the battle, and public outrage grew over the Shawnee. Americans blamed the British for inciting the tribes to violence and supplying them with firearms, and Congress passed resolutions condemning the British for interfering in American domestic affairs. Congress declared war on June 18, 1812,{{sfn|Owens|2007|pp=221, 223}} and Harrison left Vincennes to seek a military appointment.{{sfn|Gugin|St. Clair|2006|p=23}}\n\n===War of 1812===\n[[File:Rembrandt Peale - William Henry Harrison - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|This portrait of Harrison originally showed him in civilian clothes as the congressional delegate from the [[Northwest Territory]] in 1800, but the uniform was added after he became famous in the War of 1812.]]\nThe outbreak of war with the British in 1812 led to continued conflict with Indians in the Northwest.

He named it [[Fort Meigs]] in honor of Ohio governor [[Return J. Meigs Jr.]]. He received reinforcements in 1813, then took the offensive and led the army north to battle.

He ignored his own platform plank of overturning the \"spoils\" system and attempted to influence Harrison's actions before and during his brief presidency, especially in putting forth his own preferences for Cabinet offices and other presidential appointments. Harrison rebuffed his aggression: \"Mr. Clay, you forget that '''I''' am the President.\"{{sfn|Borneman|2005|p=56}} The dispute intensified when Harrison named [[Daniel Webster]] as Secretary of State, who was Clay's arch-rival for control of the Whig Party. Harrison also appeared to give Webster's supporters some highly coveted patronage positions. His sole concession to Clay was to name his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[John J.

Hordes of office applicants came to the White House, which (at the time) was open to all who wanted a meeting with the president.

He resisted pressure from other Whigs over partisan patronage. A group arrived in his office on March 16 to demand the removal of all Democrats from any appointed office, and Harrison proclaimed, \"So help me God, I will resign my office before I can be guilty of such an iniquity!\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Woollen |first=William Wesley|title=Biographical and historical sketches of early Indiana|publisher=Ayer Publishing |year=1975|page=51|isbn=978-0-405-06896-6}}</ref> His own cabinet attempted to countermand his appointment of [[John Chambers (politician)|John Chambers]] as Governor of Iowa in favor of Webster's friend [[James Wilson II (New Hampshire)|James Wilson]].

{"title_page": "Portable water purification", "text_new": "{{short description|Self-contained, easily transported units used to purify water from untreated sources}}\n'''Portable water purification''' devices are self-contained, easily transported units used to [[water purification|purify water]] from [[unimproved water source|untreated sources]] (such as rivers, lakes, and [[groundwater|wells]]) for [[drinking water|drinking]] purposes.  Their main function is to eliminate [[pathogen]]s, and often also of suspended solids and some unpalatable or [[toxic compound]]s.\n\nThese units provide an [[self-supply of water and sanitation|autonomous supply of drinking water]] to people without access to clean [[water supply]] services, including inhabitants of [[developing countries]] and disaster areas, military personnel, [[camping|campers]], [[hiking|hikers]], and workers in [[wilderness]], and [[survivalism|survivalists]].  They are also called '''point-of-use''' ('''POU''') '''water treatment systems''' and '''field water disinfection''' techniques.\n\nTechniques include heat (including boiling), filtration, activated charcoal adsorption, chemical disinfection (e.g. [[water chlorination|chlorination]], iodine, [[ozone|ozonation]], etc.), ultraviolet purification (including [[solar water disinfection|sodis]]), distillation (including solar distillation), and [[flocculation]]. Often these are used in combination.\n\n==Drinking water hazards==\nUntreated water may contain potentially pathogenic agents, including  [[protozoa]], bacteria, viruses, and some larvae of higher-order parasites such as liver flukes and roundworms. Chemical pollutants such as [[pesticide]]s, heavy metals and synthetic organics may be present. Other components may affect taste, odour and general aesthetic qualities, including [[turbidity]] from soil or clay, colour from [[humic acid]] or microscopic algae, odours from certain type of bacteria, particularly [[Actinomycetes]] which produce [[geosmin]],<ref>{{Cite book |title=Problem Organisms in Water: Identification and Treatment, 3rd Ed. (M7) |date=2004 |publisher=Amewrican Waterworks Associan}}</ref> and saltiness from brackish or sea water.\n\nCommon metallic contaminants such as [[copper]] and [[lead]] can be treated by increasing the pH using soda ash or lime, which precipitates such metals. Careful decanting of the clear water after settlement  or the use of filtration provides acceptably low levels of metals. Water contaminated by [[aluminium]] or [[zinc]] cannot be treated in this way using a strong alkali as higher pHs re-dissolve the metal salts. Salt is difficult to remove  except by reverse osmosis or [[distillation]].\n\nMost portable treatment processes focus on mitigating human pathogens for safety and removing particulates matter, tastes and odours. Significant pathogens commonly present in the developed world include ''[[Giardia]]'', ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'', ''[[Shigella]]'', [[hepatitis A virus]], ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', and [[enterovirus]].<ref>Geldreich E. Drinking water microbiology\u2014new directions toward water quality enhancement.

Pathogenic [[virus]]es may also be found in water.  The larvae of [[Fasciola hepatica|flukes]] are particularly dangerous in area frequented by [[sheep]], [[deer]], or [[cattle]]. If such [[Microscope|microscopic]] larvae are ingested, they can form potentially life-threatening [[cyst]]s in the [[brain]] or [[liver]]. This risk extends to plants grown in or near water including the commonly eaten [[watercress]].\n\nIn general, more human activity up stream (i.e. the larger the stream/river) the greater the potential for contamination from [[Sewage treatment|sewage effluent]], [[surface runoff]], or industrial [[water pollution|pollutants]].  [[Groundwater pollution]] may occur from human activity (e.g. on-site [[sanitation]] systems or mining) or might be naturally occurring (e.g. from [[Arsenic contamination of groundwater|arsenic]] in some regions of India and Bangladesh).  Water collected as far upstream as possible above  all known or anticipated risks of pollution poses the lowest risk of contamination and is best suited to portable treatment methods.\n\n==Techniques==\n[[File:US Navy 060220-M-2061L-063 U.S. Marines assigned to the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) Service Support Group 31, prepares a chlorine solution for water.jpg|thumb|300px|31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) Service Support Group 31]]\n\nNot all techniques by themselves will mitigate all hazards.

[[Pasteurization]] where ''enough'' pathogens are killed typically occurs at 63&nbsp;\u00b0C for 30 minutes or 72&nbsp;\u00b0C for 15 seconds.  Certain pathogens must be heated above boiling (e.g. botulism{{spaced ndash}}''Clostridium botulinum'' requires {{Convert|118|C}}, most [[endospores]] require {{Convert|120|C}},<ref>http://www.bellarmine.edu/faculty/dobbins/Secret%20Readings/Lecture%20Notes%20202/Chapter%2011WO.pdf</ref> and prions even higher). Higher temperatures may be achieved with a [[Pressure cooking|pressure cooker]]. Heat combined with ultraviolet light (UV), such as [[sodis]] method, reduces the necessary temperature and duration.\n\n===Filtration===\nPortable pump filters are commercially available with ceramic filters that filter 5,000 to 50,000 litres per cartridge, removing pathogens down to the 0.2&ndash;0.3 [[Micrometre|micrometer]] (\u00b5m) range. Some also utilize activated charcoal filtering. Most filters of this kind remove most bacteria and protozoa, such as ''Cryptosporidium'' and ''Giardia lamblia,'' but not viruses except for the very largest of 0.3&nbsp;\u00b5m and larger diameters, so [[Disinfectant|disinfection]] by chemicals or [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]] is still required after filtration. It is worth noting that not all bacteria are removed by 0.2&nbsp;\u00b5m pump filters; for example, strands of thread-like ''Leptospira spp.'' (which can cause leptospirosis) are thin enough to pass through a 0.2&nbsp;\u00b5m filter. Effective chemical additives to address shortcomings in pump filters include chlorine, chlorine dioxide, iodine, and sodium hypochlorite (bleach). There have been polymer and ceramic filters on the market that incorporated iodine post-treatment in their filter elements to kill viruses and the smaller bacteria that cannot be filtered out, but most have disappeared due to the unpleasant taste imparted to the water, as well as possible adverse health effects when iodine is ingested over protracted periods.\n\nWhile the filtration elements may do an excellent job of removing most bacteria and fungi contaminants from drinking water when new, the elements themselves can become colonization sites.  In recent years some filters have been enhanced by bonding silver metal nanoparticles to the ceramic element and/or to the activated charcoal to suppress growth of pathogens.\n\nSmall, hand-pumped [[reverse osmosis]] filters were originally developed for the military in the late 1980s for use as survival equipment, for example, to be included with inflatable rafts on aircraft.  Civilian versions are available.  Instead of using the static pressure of a water supply line to force the water through the filter, pressure is provided by a hand-operated pump, similar in function and appearance to a mechanic's [[Grease gun (tool)|grease gun]].  These devices can generate drinkable water from seawater.\n\nThe [[Portable Aqua Unit for Lifesaving]] (short PAUL) is a portable [[ultrafiltration]]-based membrane water filter for humanitarian aid. It allows the decentralized supply of clean water in emergency and disaster situations for about 400 persons per unit per day. The filter is designed to function with neither chemicals nor energy nor trained personnel.\n\n===Activated charcoal adsorption===\n[[File:Water purification unit.JPG|thumb|Portable water purification unit used by International Red Cross and Red Crescent.]]\nGranular activated carbon filtering utilizes a form of activated carbon with a high surface area, and [[Adsorption|adsorbs]] many compounds, including many [[Toxicity|toxic]] compounds.  Water passing through activated carbon is commonly used in concert with hand pumped filters to address [[Organic compound|organic contamination]], taste, or objectionable odors.  Activated carbon filters aren't usually used as the primary purification techniques of portable water purification devices, but rather as secondary means to complement another purification technique.  It is most commonly implemented for pre- or post-filtering, in a separate step than ceramic filtering, in either case being implemented prior to the addition of chemical disinfectants used to control bacteria or viruses that filters cannot remove.  Activated charcoal can remove chlorine from treated water, removing any residual protection remaining in the water protecting against pathogens, and should not, in general, be used without careful thought after chemical disinfection treatments in portable water purification processing. Ceramic/Carbon Core filters with a 0.5&nbsp;\u00b5m or smaller pore size are excellent for removing bacteria and cysts while also removing chemicals.\n\n===Chemical disinfection with halogens===\nChemical disinfection with [[halogens]], chiefly [[chlorine]] and [[iodine]], results from [[oxidation]] of essential cellular structures and [[enzymes]]. The primary factors that determine the rate and proportion of [[microorganisms]] killed are the residual or available halogen concentration and the exposure time.<ref>Hoff J. Inactivation of microbial agents by chemical disinfectants. Cincinnati: US Environmental Protection Agency; 1986. EPA/600/2-86/067.</ref>  Secondary factors are pathogen species, water temperature, pH, and organic contaminants. In field-water disinfection, use of concentrations of 1\u201316&nbsp;mg/L for 10\u201360 min is generally effective.   Of note, Cryptosporidium oocysts, likely Cyclospora species, Ascaris eggs are extremely resistant to halogens and field inactivation may not be practical with bleach and iodine.\n\n====Iodine====\n[[Iodine]] used for water purification is commonly added to water as a solution, in crystallized form, or in tablets containing tetraglycine hydroperiodide that release 8&nbsp;mg of iodine per tablet. The iodine kills many, but not all, of the most common pathogens present in natural fresh water sources. Carrying iodine for water purification is an imperfect but lightweight solution for those in need of field purification of drinking water. Kits are available in camping stores that include an iodine pill and a second pill (vitamin C or [[ascorbic acid]]) that will remove the iodine taste from the water after it has been [[Disinfectant|disinfected]]. The addition of vitamin C, in the form of a pill or in flavored drink powders, precipitates much of the iodine out of the solution, so it should not be added until the iodine has had sufficient time to work. This time is 30 minutes in relatively clear, warm water, but is considerably longer if the water is [[turbid]] or cold. Water treated with tablets containing tetraglycine hydroperiodide also reduces the uptake of radioactive iodine in human subjects to only 2% of the value it would otherwise be, although the amount of iodine in a single tablet is not sufficient to block uptake.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=LeMar HJ, Georgitis WJ, McDermott MT |year=1995 |title=Thyroid adaptation to chronic tetraglycine hydroperiodide water purification tablet use |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=220\u20133 |doi=10.1210/jcem.80.1.7829615 |pmid=7829615}}</ref>  If the iodine has precipitated out of the solution, then the drinking water has less available iodine in the solution.  Also. Tetraglycine hydroperiodide maintains its effectiveness indefinitely before the container is opened; although some manufacturers suggest not using the tablets more than three months after the container has initially been opened, the shelf life is in fact very long provided that the container is resealed immediately after each time it is opened.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.equipped.com/parepack.htm |title=EQUIPPED TO SURVIVE (tm) - Repackaging Potable Aqua |website=www.equipped.com |access-date=3 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nIodine should be allowed at least 30 minutes to kill Giardia.\n\n====Iodine crystals====\nA potentially lower cost alternative to using iodine-based water purification tablets is the use of iodine crystals, although there are serious risks of acute iodine toxicity if preparation and dilution are not measured with some accuracy.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Kahn FH, Visscher BR |year=1975 |title=Water Disinfection in the Wilderness -- a simple, effective method of iodination |journal=Western Journal of Medicine |volume=122 |issue=5 |pages=450\u20133 |pmc=1129772 |pmid=165639}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Zemlyn S, Wilson WW, Hellweg PA |year=1981 |title=A caution on iodine water purification |journal=Western Journal of Medicine |volume=135 |issue=2 |pages=166\u20137 |pmc=1273058 |pmid=7281653}}</ref> This method may not be adequate in killing Giardia cysts in cold water.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Jarroll EL Jr. |last2=Bingham AK |last3=Meyer EA |year=1980 |title=Inability of an iodination method to destroy completely Giardia cysts in cold water |journal=Western Journal of Medicine |volume=132 |issue=6 |pages=567\u20139 |pmc=1272173 |pmid=7405206}}</ref>  An advantage of using iodine crystals is that only a small amount of iodine is dissolved from the iodine crystals at each use, giving this method of treating water a capability for treating very large volumes of water. Unlike tetraglycine hydroperiodide tablets, iodine crystals have  an unlimited shelf life as long as they are not exposed to air for long periods of time or are kept under water. Iodine crystals will [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimate]] if exposed to air for long periods of time.  The large quantity of water that can be purified with iodine crystals at low cost makes this technique especially cost effective for point of use or emergency water purification methods intended for use longer than the shelf life of tetraglycine hydroperiodide.\n\n====Halazone tablets====\nChlorine-based [[halazone]] tablets were formerly popularly used for portable water purification.  Chlorine in water is more than three times more effective as a disinfectant against ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' than iodine.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Koski TA, Stuart LS, Ortenzio LF |year=1966 |title=Comparison of Chlorine, Bromine, and Iodine as Disinfectants for Swimming Pool Water |journal=Applied Microbiology |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=276\u20139 |pmc=546668 |pmid=4959984}}</ref> Halazone tablets were thus commonly used during [[World War II]] by U.S. soldiers for portable water purification, even being included in accessory packs for [[C-ration]]s until 1945.\n\n[[Sodium dichloroisocyanurate]] (NaDCC) has largely displaced halazone tablets for the few remaining chlorine-based water purification tablets available today.<!--Is the following about Halazone or NaDCC?--> It is compressed with effervescent salts, usually [[adipic acid]] and [[sodium bicarbonate]], to form rapidly dissolving tablets, diluted to 10 parts per million available chlorine (ppm av.cl) when drinking water is mildly contaminated and 20ppm when visibly contaminated.\n\nChlorine bleach tablets give a more stable platform for disinfecting the water than liquid [[bleach]] ([[sodium hypochlorite]]) as the liquid version tends to degrade with age and give unregulated results unless assays are carried out{{spaced ndash}}not practical on the spot. Still, despite chlorine-based halazone tablets falling from favor for portable water purification, chlorine-based bleach may nonetheless safely be used for short-term emergency water disinfection.  Two drops of unscented 5% bleach can be added per liter or quart of clear water, then allowed to stand covered for 30 to 60 minutes. After this treatment, the water may be left open to reduce the chlorine smell and taste. Guidelines are available online for effective emergency use of bleach to render unsafe water [[potable]].{{Ref|1 EPA}}{{Ref|2 BC Health}}\n\nThe [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control & Prevention]] (CDC) and [[Population Services International]] (PSI) promote a similar product (a 0.5% - 1.5% sodium hypochlorite solution) as part of their Safe Water System (SWS) strategy.  The product is sold in [[developing countries]] under local brand names specifically for the purpose of disinfecting drinking water.<ref name=\"cdc\" />\n\n====Bleach====\nCommon [[bleach]] including [[calcium hypochlorite]] (Ca[OCl]<sub>2</sub>) and [[sodium hypochlorite]] (NaOCl) are common, well-researched, low-cost oxidizers.\n\nThe [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] recommends two drops of 8.25% sodium hypochlorite solution (regular, unscented chlorine bleach) mixed per one quart/liter of water and let stand 30 minutes. Two drops of 5% solution also suffices.<ref name=\"auto\" /> Double the amount of bleach if the water is cloudy, colored, or very cold. Afterwards, the water should have a slight chlorine odor. If not repeat the dosage and let stand for another 15 minutes before use.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/drink/emerprep/emergencydisinfection.cfm#method |title=Ground Water and Drinking Water - US EPA |last=EPA, OW |first=US |date=2013-02-20 |website=US EPA |access-date=3 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nNeither chlorine (e.g., bleach) nor iodine alone is considered completely effective against ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'', although they are partially effective against ''[[Giardia]]''. Chlorine is considered slightly better against the latter. A more complete field solution that includes chemical disinfectants is to first filter the water, using a 0.2&nbsp;\u00b5m ceramic cartridge pumped filter, followed by treatment with iodine or chlorine, thereby filtering out cryptosporidium, Giardia, and most bacteria, along with the larger viruses, while also using chemical disinfectant to address smaller viruses and bacteria that the filter cannot remove. This combination is also potentially more effective in some cases than even using portable electronic disinfection based on [[UV]] treatment.\n\n====Chlorine dioxide====\n[[Chlorine dioxide]] can come from tablets or be created by mixing two chemicals together. It is more effective than iodine or chlorine against giardia, and although it has only low to moderate effectiveness against cryptosporidium, iodine and chlorine are ineffective against this protozoan.<ref name=\"cdc\" /> The cost of chlorine dioxide treatment is higher than the cost of iodine treatment. {{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n====Mixed oxidant (MiOx)====\nA simple brine {salt + water} solution in an electrolytic reaction produces a powerful [[mixed oxidant]] disinfectant (mostly chlorine in the form of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and some peroxide, ozone, chlorine dioxide).<ref>[http://phc.amedd.army.mil/PHC%20Resource%20Library/Electrochemically%20Generated%20Oxidant%20Disinfection%20in%20the%20Use%20of%20Individual%20Water%20Purification%20Devices.pdf ''Electrochemcially Generated Oxidant Disinfection\nIn the Use of Individual Water Purification Devices,'' US Army Public Health Command, Prepared by: Steven H. Clarke, Environmental Engineer, March 2006, updated January 2011]</ref>\n\n==== Chlorine tablets (NaDCC) ====\n[[Sodium dichloroisocyanurate]] or Troclosene Sodium more commonly shortened as NaDCC, is a form of chlorine used for disinfection. It is used by all major NGO's such as UNICEF<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/wash/files/JMP2013final_en.pdf |title=UNICEF - Progress on Drinking Water and Sanitation}}</ref> to treat water in emergencies, and widely by social marketing organisations for household water treatment where household sources of water may not be safe.\n\nNaDCC tablets are available in a range of concentrations to treat differing volumes of water<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oasiswaterpurification.com/brand/oasis-water-purification-tablets/ |title=Water Purification Tablets}}</ref> to give the World Health Organization's recommended 5ppm<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/2011/dwq_guidelines/en/ |title=WHO - Guidelines for drinking-water quality, fourth edition}}</ref> available chlorine. They are effervescent tablets allowing the tablet to dissolve in a matter of minutes.\n\n===Other chemical disinfection additives===\n\n====Silver ion tablets====\nAn alternative to iodine-based preparations in some usage scenarios are [[silver]] ion/[[chlorine dioxide]]-based tablets or droplets. These solutions may disinfect water more effectively than iodine-based techniques while leaving hardly any noticeable taste in the water in some usage scenarios.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Silver ion/chlorine dioxide-based disinfecting agents will kill ''Cryptosporidium'' and ''Giardia'', if utilized correctly. The primary disadvantage of silver ion/chlorine dioxide-based techniques is the long purification times (generally 30 minutes to 4 hours, depending on the formulation used).  Another concern is the possible deposition and accumulation of silver compounds in various body tissues leading to a rare condition called [[argyria]] that results in a permanent, disfiguring, bluish-gray pigmentation of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes.\n\n====Hydrogen peroxide====\nOne recent study has found that the wild Salmonella which would reproduce quickly during subsequent dark storage of solar-disinfected water could be controlled by the addition of just 10 parts per million of hydrogen peroxide.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Sciacca F, Rengifo-Herrera JA, W\u00e9th\u00e9 J, Pulgarin C |date=2010-01-08 |title=Dramatic enhancement of solar disinfection (SODIS) of wild Salmonella sp. in PET bottles by H(2)O(2) addition on natural water of Burkina Faso containing dissolved iron |format=epub ahead of print |journal=Chemosphere |volume=78 |issue=9 |pages=1186\u201391 |doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2009.12.001 |pmid=20060566}}</ref>\n\n===Ultraviolet purification===\n{{Main|Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation}}\n[[Ultraviolet]] (UV) light induces the formation of covalent linkages on [[DNA]] and thereby prevents microbes from reproducing. Without reproduction, the microbes become far less dangerous. Germicidal UV-C light in the short wavelength range of 100&ndash;280&nbsp;nm acts on [[thymine]], one of the four base [[nucleotide]]s in DNA. When a germicidal UV [[photon]] is absorbed by a thymine molecule that is adjacent to another thymine within the DNA strand, a [[covalent bond]] or [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] between the molecules is created. This thymine dimer prevents [[enzyme]]s from \"reading\" the DNA and copying it, thus neutering the microbe. Prolonged exposure to ionizing radiation can cause single and double-stranded breaks in DNA, oxidation of membrane lipids, and denaturation of proteins, all of which are toxic to cells. Still, there are limits to this technology.  Water turbidity (i.e., the amount of suspended & colloidal solids contained in the water to be treated) must be low, such that the water is clear, for UV purification to work well - thus a pre-filter step might be necessary.\n\nA concern with UV portable water purification is that some pathogens are hundreds of times less sensitive to UV light than others.  Protozoan cysts were once believed to be among the least sensitive, however recent studies have proved otherwise, demonstrating that both Cryptosporidium and Giardia are deactivated by a UV dose of just 6 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> <ref>USEPA, Ultraviolet Disinfection Guidance Manual for the final LT2ESWTR, Nov 2006</ref>  However, EPA regulations and other studies show that it is viruses that are the limiting factor of UV treatment, requiring a 10-30 times greater dose of UV light than ''Giardia'' or ''Cryptosporidium''.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=5 Jan 2006 |title=National Primary Drinking Water Regulations: Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule |url=http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-WATER/2006/January/Day-05/w04c.htm |journal=Federal Register |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=783 |access-date=17 Apr 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Mofidi AA, Meyer EA, Wallis PM, Chou CL, Meyer BP, Ramalinham S, Coffey BM |year=2002 |title=The effect of UV light on the inactivation of ''Giardia lamblia'' and ''Giardia muris'' cysts as determined by animal infectivity assay (P-2951-01) |journal=Water Research |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=2098\u2013108 |doi=10.1016/S0043-1354(01)00412-2 |pmid=12092585}}</ref>\nStudies have shown that UV doses at the levels provided by common portable UV units are effective at killing ''Giardia''<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Campbell AT, Wallis P |year=2002 |title=The effect of UV irradiation on human-derived ''Giardia lamblia'' cysts |journal=Water Research |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=963\u20139 |doi=10.1016/S0043-1354(01)00309-8 |pmid=11848367}}</ref> and that there was no evidence of repair and reactivation of the cysts.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Linden KG, Shin GA, Faubert G, Cairns W, Sobsey MD |year=2002 |title=UV disinfection of ''Giardia lamblia'' cysts in water |journal=Environmental Science and Technology |volume=36 |issue=11 |pages=2519\u201322 |bibcode=2002EnST...36.2519L |doi=10.1021/es0113403 |pmid=12075814}}</ref>\n\nWater treated with UV still has the microbes present in the water, only with their means for reproduction turned \"off\".  In the event that such UV-treated water containing neutered microbes is exposed to visible light (specifically, wavelengths of light over 330-500&nbsp;nm)  for any significant period of time, a process known as [[photolyase|photo reactivation]] can take place, where the possibility for repairing the damage in the bacteria's reproduction DNA arises, potentially rendering them once more capable of reproducing and causing disease.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Qiu X, Sundin GW, Chai B, Tiedje JM |date=November 2004 |title=Survival of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 after UV Radiation Exposure |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=70 |issue=11 |pages=6435\u201343 |doi=10.1128/AEM.70.11.6435-6443.2004 |pmc=525172 |pmid=15528503}}</ref>  UV-treated water must therefore not be exposed to visible light for any significant period of time after UV treatment, before consumption, to avoid ingesting reactivated and dangerous microbes.\n\nRecent developments in semiconductor technology allows for the development of UV-C [[Light-emitting diode|Light Emitting Diodes]] (LEDs). UV-C LED systems address disadvantages of mercury-based technology, namely: power-cycling penalties, high power needs, fragility, warm-up time, and mercury content.\n\n===Ozone water disinfection===\n{{Main|Ozone}}\nIn ozone water disinfection, microbes are destroyed by ozone gas (O<sub>3</sub>) provided by an ozone generator. Common in Europe, ozone gas is now becoming widely adopted in the United States. It is emerging across a wide array of industries; from municipal water treatment plants, to food processing plants, to healthcare organizations. It is being adopted due to its ability to sanitize water and surfaces without wasting water, and because there are no by-products. When its job is done, ozone gas quickly degrades into oxygen. Ozone is more effective than chlorine in destroying viruses and bacteria.\n\nIn 1990, the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA) identified aqueous ozone as a substance that is allowed for use in organic crop and livestock production. In 1997, it was approved by the FDA as an antimicrobial agent for use on food. In 2002, the FDA approved ozone for use on food contact areas and directly on food with its Generally Regarded as Safe (\u201cGRAS\u201d) designation.\n\nOzone is most commonly created by a process called \u201ccorona discharge\u201d, which causes oxygen molecules (O<sub>2</sub>) to temporarily re-combine into ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). This gas is very unstable, and the 3rd oxygen molecule reacts with pathogens by penetrating the cell walls of bacteria and viruses. This destroys the organisms.\n\nOzone is effective against pollutants for the same reason; it will react with long-chain carbon (organic) molecules, and break them down into less complex (and typically less harmful) molecules through oxidation.\n\nAdvances in ozone generation techniques, coupled with filtration, make this a viable new portable water purification method.\n\n===Solar water disinfection===\n{{Main|Solar water disinfection}}\nIn solar water disinfection (often shortened as \"sodis\"), microbes are destroyed by temperature and [[Ultraviolet#Explanation|UVA]] radiation provided by the [[sun]].  Water is placed in a transparent plastic [[polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] bottle or plastic bag, oxygenated by shaking partially filled capped bottles prior to filling the bottles all the way, and left in the sun for 6\u201324 hours atop a reflective surface.\n\n===Solar distillation===\n{{Main|Solar still}}\nSolar distillation relies on sunlight to warm and evaporate the water to be purified which then condenses and trickles into a container.  In theory, a solar (condensation) still removes all pathogens, salts, metals, and most chemicals but in field practice the lack of clean components, easy contact with dirt, improvised construction, and disturbances result in cleaner, yet contaminated water.\n\n===Homemade water filters===\nWater filters can be made on-site using local materials such as sand and [[charcoal]] (e.g. from firewood burned in a special way). These filters are sometimes used by soldiers and outdoor enthusiasts. Due to their low cost they can be made and used by anyone. The reliability of such systems is highly variable. Such filters can do little, if anything, to mitigate [[germ theory of disease|germs]] and other harmful constituents and can give a false sense of security that the water so produced is potable.  Water processed through an improvised filter should undergo secondary processing such as boiling to render it safe for consumption.\n\n==Prevention of water contamination==\nHuman [[Waterborne diseases|water-borne diseases]] usually come from other humans, thus human-derived materials ([[Human feces|feces]], medical waste, wash water, lawn chemicals, gasoline engines, garbage, etc.) should be kept far away from water sources.  For example, [[human excreta]] should be buried well away (>60 meters/200 feet) from water sources to reduce contamination.<ref name=\"cdc\" />  In some wilderness areas it is recommended that all waste be packed up and carted out to a properly designated disposal point.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ceramic water filter]]\n*[[Desalination]]\n*[[Self-supply of water and sanitation]]\n*[[Traveler's diarrhea]]\n*[[Water quality]]\n*[[Wilderness acquired diarrhea]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://hwts.info/ Household Water Treatment Knowledge] on [[CAWST]] website\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Portable Water Purification}}\n[[Category:Water]]\n[[Category:Camping]]\n[[Category:Drinking water]]\n[[Category:Hiking]]\n[[Category:Waterborne diseases]]\n[[Category:Wilderness]]\n[[Category:Camping equipment]]\n[[Category:Hiking equipment]]\n[[Category:Emergency services]]\n[[Category:Water treatment]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Self-contained, easily transported units used to purify water from untreated sources}}\n'''Portable water purification''' devices are self-contained, easily transported units used to [[water purification|purify water]] from [[unimproved water source|untreated sources]] (such as rivers, lakes, and [[groundwater|wells]]) for [[drinking water|drinking]] purposes.

Other components may affect taste, odour and general aesthetic qualities, including [[turbidity]] from soil or clay, colour from [[humic acid]] or microscopic algae, odours from certain type of bacteria, particularly [[Actinomycetes]] which produce [[geosmin]],<ref>{{Cite book |title=Problem Organisms in Water: Identification and Treatment, 3rd Ed.

If such [[Microscope|microscopic]] larvae are ingested, they can form potentially life-threatening [[cyst]]s in the [[brain]] or [[liver]]. This risk extends to plants grown in or near water including the commonly eaten [[watercress]].\n\nIn general, more human activity up stream (i.e. the larger the stream/river) the greater the potential for contamination from [[Sewage treatment|sewage effluent]], [[surface runoff]], or industrial [[water pollution|pollutants]].  [[Groundwater pollution]] may occur from human activity (e.g. on-site [[sanitation]] systems or mining) or might be naturally occurring (e.g. from [[Arsenic contamination of groundwater|arsenic]] in some regions of India and Bangladesh).  Water collected as far upstream as possible above  all known or anticipated risks of pollution poses the lowest risk of contamination and is best suited to portable treatment methods.\n\n==Techniques==\n[[File:US Navy 060220-M-2061L-063 U.S. Marines assigned to the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) Service Support Group 31, prepares a chlorine solution for water.jpg|thumb|300px|31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) Service Support Group 31]]\n\nNot all techniques by themselves will mitigate all hazards. Although flocculation followed by filtration has been suggested as best practice<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite journal |last=Ericsson |first=Charles D. |last2=Steffen |first2=Robert |last3=Backer |first3=Howard |date=1 February 2002 |title=Water Disinfection for International and Wilderness Travelers |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=355\u2013364 |doi=10.1086/324747 |pmid=11774083}}</ref> this is rarely practicable without the ability to carefully control pH and settling conditions.

[[Sterilization (microbiology)|Sterilization]] of water (killing all living contaminants) is not necessary to make water safe to drink; one only needs to render enteric (intestinal) pathogens harmless.  Boiling does not remove most pollutants and does not leave any residual protection.\n\nThe [[World Health Organization|WHO]] states bringing water to rolling boil then naturally cooling is sufficient to inactivate pathogenic bacteria, viruses and protozoa.<ref>http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/Boiling_water_01_15.pdf?ua=1&ua=1</ref>\n\nThe [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] recommends a rolling boil for 1 minute.  At high elevations, though, the boiling point of water drops.  At altitudes greater than 6,562 feet (2000 meters) boiling should continue for 3 minutes.<ref name=\"cdc\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/backcountry_water_treatment.html |title=A Guide to Drinking Water Treatment and Sanitation for Backcountry & Travel Use |date=10 April 2009 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |access-date=19 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nAll bacterial pathogens are quickly killed above 60&nbsp;\u00b0C (140&nbsp;\u00b0F), therefore, although boiling is not necessary to make the water safe to drink, the time taken to heat the water to boiling is usually sufficient to reduce bacterial concentrations to safe levels.<ref>Backer, H. Water Disinfection for International and Wilderness Traveler. Clinical Infectious Diseases. (2002) 34 (3): 355-364. Available from: http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/3/355.full</ref> Encysted [[protozoa]]n pathogens may require higher temperatures to remove any risk.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.foodsafetywatch.org/factsheets/cryptosporidium/ |title=Cryptosporidium |last=Lawley R |date=1 January 2013 |publisher=Food Safety Watch}}</ref>\n\nBoiling is not always necessary nor sometimes enough.  [[Pasteurization]] where ''enough'' pathogens are killed typically occurs at 63&nbsp;\u00b0C for 30 minutes or 72&nbsp;\u00b0C for 15 seconds.  Certain pathogens must be heated above boiling (e.g. botulism{{spaced ndash}}''Clostridium botulinum'' requires {{Convert|118|C}}, most [[endospores]] require {{Convert|120|C}},<ref>http://www.bellarmine.edu/faculty/dobbins/Secret%20Readings/Lecture%20Notes%20202/Chapter%2011WO.pdf</ref> and prions even higher). Higher temperatures may be achieved with a [[Pressure cooking|pressure cooker]]. Heat combined with ultraviolet light (UV), such as [[sodis]] method, reduces the necessary temperature and duration.\n\n===Filtration===\nPortable pump filters are commercially available with ceramic filters that filter 5,000 to 50,000 litres per cartridge, removing pathogens down to the 0.2&ndash;0.3 [[Micrometre|micrometer]] (\u00b5m) range. Some also utilize activated charcoal filtering. Most filters of this kind remove most bacteria and protozoa, such as ''Cryptosporidium'' and ''Giardia lamblia,'' but not viruses except for the very largest of 0.3&nbsp;\u00b5m and larger diameters, so [[Disinfectant|disinfection]] by chemicals or [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]] is still required after filtration. It is worth noting that not all bacteria are removed by 0.2&nbsp;\u00b5m pump filters; for example, strands of thread-like ''Leptospira spp.'' (which can cause leptospirosis) are thin enough to pass through a 0.2&nbsp;\u00b5m filter. Effective chemical additives to address shortcomings in pump filters include chlorine, chlorine dioxide, iodine, and sodium hypochlorite (bleach). There have been polymer and ceramic filters on the market that incorporated iodine post-treatment in their filter elements to kill viruses and the smaller bacteria that cannot be filtered out, but most have disappeared due to the unpleasant taste imparted to the water, as well as possible adverse health effects when iodine is ingested over protracted periods.\n\nWhile the filtration elements may do an excellent job of removing most bacteria and fungi contaminants from drinking water when new, the elements themselves can become colonization sites.  In recent years some filters have been enhanced by bonding silver metal nanoparticles to the ceramic element and/or to the activated charcoal to suppress growth of pathogens.\n\nSmall, hand-pumped [[reverse osmosis]] filters were originally developed for the military in the late 1980s for use as survival equipment, for example, to be included with inflatable rafts on aircraft.  Civilian versions are available.  Instead of using the static pressure of a water supply line to force the water through the filter, pressure is provided by a hand-operated pump, similar in function and appearance to a mechanic's [[Grease gun (tool)|grease gun]].  These devices can generate drinkable water from seawater.\n\nThe [[Portable Aqua Unit for Lifesaving]] (short PAUL) is a portable [[ultrafiltration]]-based membrane water filter for humanitarian aid. It allows the decentralized supply of clean water in emergency and disaster situations for about 400 persons per unit per day. The filter is designed to function with neither chemicals nor energy nor trained personnel.\n\n===Activated charcoal adsorption===\n[[File:Water purification unit.JPG|thumb|Portable water purification unit used by International Red Cross and Red Crescent.]]\nGranular activated carbon filtering utilizes a form of activated carbon with a high surface area, and [[Adsorption|adsorbs]] many compounds, including many [[Toxicity|toxic]] compounds.  Water passing through activated carbon is commonly used in concert with hand pumped filters to address [[Organic compound|organic contamination]], taste, or objectionable odors.  Activated carbon filters aren't usually used as the primary purification techniques of portable water purification devices, but rather as secondary means to complement another purification technique.  It is most commonly implemented for pre- or post-filtering, in a separate step than ceramic filtering, in either case being implemented prior to the addition of chemical disinfectants used to control bacteria or viruses that filters cannot remove.  Activated charcoal can remove chlorine from treated water, removing any residual protection remaining in the water protecting against pathogens, and should not, in general, be used without careful thought after chemical disinfection treatments in portable water purification processing. Ceramic/Carbon Core filters with a 0.5&nbsp;\u00b5m or smaller pore size are excellent for removing bacteria and cysts while also removing chemicals.\n\n===Chemical disinfection with halogens===\nChemical disinfection with [[halogens]], chiefly [[chlorine]] and [[iodine]], results from [[oxidation]] of essential cellular structures and [[enzymes]]. The primary factors that determine the rate and proportion of [[microorganisms]] killed are the residual or available halogen concentration and the exposure time.<ref>Hoff J. Inactivation of microbial agents by chemical disinfectants. Cincinnati: US Environmental Protection Agency; 1986. EPA/600/2-86/067.</ref>  Secondary factors are pathogen species, water temperature, pH, and organic contaminants. In field-water disinfection, use of concentrations of 1\u201316&nbsp;mg/L for 10\u201360 min is generally effective.   Of note, Cryptosporidium oocysts, likely Cyclospora species, Ascaris eggs are extremely resistant to halogens and field inactivation may not be practical with bleach and iodine.\n\n====Iodine====\n[[Iodine]] used for water purification is commonly added to water as a solution, in crystallized form, or in tablets containing tetraglycine hydroperiodide that release 8&nbsp;mg of iodine per tablet. The iodine kills many, but not all, of the most common pathogens present in natural fresh water sources. Carrying iodine for water purification is an imperfect but lightweight solution for those in need of field purification of drinking water. Kits are available in camping stores that include an iodine pill and a second pill (vitamin C or [[ascorbic acid]]) that will remove the iodine taste from the water after it has been [[Disinfectant|disinfected]]. The addition of vitamin C, in the form of a pill or in flavored drink powders, precipitates much of the iodine out of the solution, so it should not be added until the iodine has had sufficient time to work. This time is 30 minutes in relatively clear, warm water, but is considerably longer if the water is [[turbid]] or cold. Water treated with tablets containing tetraglycine hydroperiodide also reduces the uptake of radioactive iodine in human subjects to only 2% of the value it would otherwise be, although the amount of iodine in a single tablet is not sufficient to block uptake.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=LeMar HJ, Georgitis WJ, McDermott MT |year=1995 |title=Thyroid adaptation to chronic tetraglycine hydroperiodide water purification tablet use |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=220\u20133 |doi=10.1210/jcem.80.1.7829615 |pmid=7829615}}</ref>  If the iodine has precipitated out of the solution, then the drinking water has less available iodine in the solution.  Also. Tetraglycine hydroperiodide maintains its effectiveness indefinitely before the container is opened; although some manufacturers suggest not using the tablets more than three months after the container has initially been opened, the shelf life is in fact very long provided that the container is resealed immediately after each time it is opened.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.equipped.com/parepack.htm |title=EQUIPPED TO SURVIVE (tm) - Repackaging Potable Aqua |website=www.equipped.com |access-date=3 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nIodine should be allowed at least 30 minutes to kill Giardia.\n\n====Iodine crystals====\nA potentially lower cost alternative to using iodine-based water purification tablets is the use of iodine crystals, although there are serious risks of acute iodine toxicity if preparation and dilution are not measured with some accuracy.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Kahn FH, Visscher BR |year=1975 |title=Water Disinfection in the Wilderness -- a simple, effective method of iodination |journal=Western Journal of Medicine |volume=122 |issue=5 |pages=450\u20133 |pmc=1129772 |pmid=165639}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Zemlyn S, Wilson WW, Hellweg PA |year=1981 |title=A caution on iodine water purification |journal=Western Journal of Medicine |volume=135 |issue=2 |pages=166\u20137 |pmc=1273058 |pmid=7281653}}</ref> This method may not be adequate in killing Giardia cysts in cold water.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Jarroll EL Jr. |last2=Bingham AK |last3=Meyer EA |year=1980 |title=Inability of an iodination method to destroy completely Giardia cysts in cold water |journal=Western Journal of Medicine |volume=132 |issue=6 |pages=567\u20139 |pmc=1272173 |pmid=7405206}}</ref>  An advantage of using iodine crystals is that only a small amount of iodine is dissolved from the iodine crystals at each use, giving this method of treating water a capability for treating very large volumes of water. Unlike tetraglycine hydroperiodide tablets, iodine crystals have  an unlimited shelf life as long as they are not exposed to air for long periods of time or are kept under water. Iodine crystals will [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimate]] if exposed to air for long periods of time.  The large quantity of water that can be purified with iodine crystals at low cost makes this technique especially cost effective for point of use or emergency water purification methods intended for use longer than the shelf life of tetraglycine hydroperiodide.\n\n====Halazone tablets====\nChlorine-based [[halazone]] tablets were formerly popularly used for portable water purification.  Chlorine in water is more than three times more effective as a disinfectant against ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' than iodine.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Koski TA, Stuart LS, Ortenzio LF |year=1966 |title=Comparison of Chlorine, Bromine, and Iodine as Disinfectants for Swimming Pool Water |journal=Applied Microbiology |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=276\u20139 |pmc=546668 |pmid=4959984}}</ref> Halazone tablets were thus commonly used during [[World War II]] by U.S. soldiers for portable water purification, even being included in accessory packs for [[C-ration]]s until 1945.\n\n[[Sodium dichloroisocyanurate]] (NaDCC) has largely displaced halazone tablets for the few remaining chlorine-based water purification tablets available today.<!--Is the following about Halazone or NaDCC?--> It is compressed with effervescent salts, usually [[adipic acid]] and [[sodium bicarbonate]], to form rapidly dissolving tablets, diluted to 10 parts per million available chlorine (ppm av.cl) when drinking water is mildly contaminated and 20ppm when visibly contaminated.\n\nChlorine bleach tablets give a more stable platform for disinfecting the water than liquid [[bleach]] ([[sodium hypochlorite]]) as the liquid version tends to degrade with age and give unregulated results unless assays are carried out{{spaced ndash}}not practical on the spot. Still, despite chlorine-based halazone tablets falling from favor for portable water purification, chlorine-based bleach may nonetheless safely be used for short-term emergency water disinfection.  Two drops of unscented 5% bleach can be added per liter or quart of clear water, then allowed to stand covered for 30 to 60 minutes. After this treatment, the water may be left open to reduce the chlorine smell and taste. Guidelines are available online for effective emergency use of bleach to render unsafe water [[potable]].{{Ref|1 EPA}}{{Ref|2 BC Health}}\n\nThe [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control & Prevention]] (CDC) and [[Population Services International]] (PSI) promote a similar product (a 0.5% - 1.5% sodium hypochlorite solution) as part of their Safe Water System (SWS) strategy.  The product is sold in [[developing countries]] under local brand names specifically for the purpose of disinfecting drinking water.<ref name=\"cdc\" />\n\n====Bleach====\nCommon [[bleach]] including [[calcium hypochlorite]] (Ca[OCl]<sub>2</sub>) and [[sodium hypochlorite]] (NaOCl) are common, well-researched, low-cost oxidizers.\n\nThe [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] recommends two drops of 8.25% sodium hypochlorite solution (regular, unscented chlorine bleach) mixed per one quart/liter of water and let stand 30 minutes. Two drops of 5% solution also suffices.<ref name=\"auto\" /> Double the amount of bleach if the water is cloudy, colored, or very cold. Afterwards, the water should have a slight chlorine odor. If not repeat the dosage and let stand for another 15 minutes before use.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/drink/emerprep/emergencydisinfection.cfm#method |title=Ground Water and Drinking Water - US EPA |last=EPA, OW |first=US |date=2013-02-20 |website=US EPA |access-date=3 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nNeither chlorine (e.g., bleach) nor iodine alone is considered completely effective against ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'', although they are partially effective against ''[[Giardia]]''. Chlorine is considered slightly better against the latter. A more complete field solution that includes chemical disinfectants is to first filter the water, using a 0.2&nbsp;\u00b5m ceramic cartridge pumped filter, followed by treatment with iodine or chlorine, thereby filtering out cryptosporidium, Giardia, and most bacteria, along with the larger viruses, while also using chemical disinfectant to address smaller viruses and bacteria that the filter cannot remove. This combination is also potentially more effective in some cases than even using portable electronic disinfection based on [[UV]] treatment.\n\n====Chlorine dioxide====\nChlorine dioxide can come from tablets or be created by mixing two chemicals together. It is more effective than iodine or chlorine against giardia, and although it has only low to moderate effectiveness against cryptosporidium, iodine and chlorine are ineffective against this protozoan.<ref name=\"cdc\" /> The cost of chlorine dioxide treatment is higher than the cost of iodine treatment. {{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n====Mixed oxidant (MiOx)====\nA simple brine {salt + water} solution in an electrolytic reaction produces a powerful mixed oxidant disinfectant (mostly chlorine in the form of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and some peroxide, ozone, chlorine dioxide).<ref>[http://phc.amedd.army.mil/PHC%20Resource%20Library/Electrochemically%20Generated%20Oxidant%20Disinfection%20in%20the%20Use%20of%20Individual%20Water%20Purification%20Devices.pdf ''Electrochemcially Generated Oxidant Disinfection\nIn the Use of Individual Water Purification Devices,'' US Army Public Health Command, Prepared by: Steven H. Clarke, Environmental Engineer, March 2006, updated January 2011]</ref>\n\n==== Chlorine tablets (NaDCC) ====\n[[Sodium dichloroisocyanurate]] or Troclosene Sodium more commonly shortened as NaDCC, is a form of chlorine used for disinfection. It is used by all major NGO's such as UNICEF<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/wash/files/JMP2013final_en.pdf |title=UNICEF - Progress on Drinking Water and Sanitation}}</ref> to treat water in emergencies, and widely by social marketing organisations for household water treatment where household sources of water may not be safe.\n\nNaDCC tablets are available in a range of concentrations to treat differing volumes of water<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oasiswaterpurification.com/brand/oasis-water-purification-tablets/ |title=Water Purification Tablets}}</ref> to give the World Health Organization's recommended 5ppm<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/2011/dwq_guidelines/en/ |title=WHO - Guidelines for drinking-water quality, fourth edition}}</ref> available chlorine. They are effervescent tablets allowing the tablet to dissolve in a matter of minutes.\n\n===Other chemical disinfection additives===\n\n====Silver ion tablets====\nAn alternative to iodine-based preparations in some usage scenarios are [[silver]] ion/[[chlorine dioxide]]-based tablets or droplets. These solutions may disinfect water more effectively than iodine-based techniques while leaving hardly any noticeable taste in the water in some usage scenarios.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Silver ion/chlorine dioxide-based disinfecting agents will kill ''Cryptosporidium'' and ''Giardia'', if utilized correctly. The primary disadvantage of silver ion/chlorine dioxide-based techniques is the long purification times (generally 30 minutes to 4 hours, depending on the formulation used).  Another concern is the possible deposition and accumulation of silver compounds in various body tissues leading to a rare condition called [[argyria]] that results in a permanent, disfiguring, bluish-gray pigmentation of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes.\n\n====Hydrogen peroxide====\nOne recent study has found that the wild Salmonella which would reproduce quickly during subsequent dark storage of solar-disinfected water could be controlled by the addition of just 10 parts per million of hydrogen peroxide.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Sciacca F, Rengifo-Herrera JA, W\u00e9th\u00e9 J, Pulgarin C |date=2010-01-08 |title=Dramatic enhancement of solar disinfection (SODIS) of wild Salmonella sp. in PET bottles by H(2)O(2) addition on natural water of Burkina Faso containing dissolved iron |format=epub ahead of print |journal=Chemosphere |volume=78 |issue=9 |pages=1186\u201391 |doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2009.12.001 |pmid=20060566}}</ref>\n\n===Ultraviolet purification===\n{{Main|Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation}}\n[[Ultraviolet]] (UV) light induces the formation of covalent linkages on [[DNA]] and thereby prevents microbes from reproducing. Without reproduction, the microbes become far less dangerous. Germicidal UV-C light in the short wavelength range of 100&ndash;280&nbsp;nm acts on [[thymine]], one of the four base [[nucleotide]]s in DNA. When a germicidal UV [[photon]] is absorbed by a thymine molecule that is adjacent to another thymine within the DNA strand, a [[covalent bond]] or [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] between the molecules is created. This thymine dimer prevents [[enzyme]]s from \"reading\" the DNA and copying it, thus neutering the microbe. Prolonged exposure to ionizing radiation can cause single and double-stranded breaks in DNA, oxidation of membrane lipids, and denaturation of proteins, all of which are toxic to cells. Still, there are limits to this technology.  Water turbidity (i.e., the amount of suspended & colloidal solids contained in the water to be treated) must be low, such that the water is clear, for UV purification to work well - thus a pre-filter step might be necessary.\n\nA concern with UV portable water purification is that some pathogens are hundreds of times less sensitive to UV light than others.  Protozoan cysts were once believed to be among the least sensitive, however recent studies have proved otherwise, demonstrating that both Cryptosporidium and Giardia are deactivated by a UV dose of just 6 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> <ref>USEPA, Ultraviolet Disinfection Guidance Manual for the final LT2ESWTR, Nov 2006</ref>  However, EPA regulations and other studies show that it is viruses that are the limiting factor of UV treatment, requiring a 10-30 times greater dose of UV light than ''Giardia'' or ''Cryptosporidium''.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=5 Jan 2006 |title=National Primary Drinking Water Regulations: Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule |url=http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-WATER/2006/January/Day-05/w04c.htm |journal=Federal Register |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=783 |access-date=17 Apr 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Mofidi AA, Meyer EA, Wallis PM, Chou CL, Meyer BP, Ramalinham S, Coffey BM |year=2002 |title=The effect of UV light on the inactivation of ''Giardia lamblia'' and ''Giardia muris'' cysts as determined by animal infectivity assay (P-2951-01) |journal=Water Research |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=2098\u2013108 |doi=10.1016/S0043-1354(01)00412-2 |pmid=12092585}}</ref>\nStudies have shown that UV doses at the levels provided by common portable UV units are effective at killing ''Giardia''<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Campbell AT, Wallis P |year=2002 |title=The effect of UV irradiation on human-derived ''Giardia lamblia'' cysts |journal=Water Research |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=963\u20139 |doi=10.1016/S0043-1354(01)00309-8 |pmid=11848367}}</ref> and that there was no evidence of repair and reactivation of the cysts.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Linden KG, Shin GA, Faubert G, Cairns W, Sobsey MD |year=2002 |title=UV disinfection of ''Giardia lamblia'' cysts in water |journal=Environmental Science and Technology |volume=36 |issue=11 |pages=2519\u201322 |bibcode=2002EnST...36.2519L |doi=10.1021/es0113403 |pmid=12075814}}</ref>\n\nWater treated with UV still has the microbes present in the water, only with their means for reproduction turned \"off\".

UV-C LED systems address disadvantages of mercury-based technology, namely: power-cycling penalties, high power needs, fragility, warm-up time, and mercury content.\n\n===Ozone water disinfection===\n{{Main|Ozone}}\nIn ozone water disinfection, microbes are destroyed by ozone gas (O<sub>3</sub>) provided by an ozone generator. Common in Europe, ozone gas is now becoming widely adopted in the United States. It is emerging across a wide array of industries; from municipal water treatment plants, to food processing plants, to healthcare organizations. It is being adopted due to its ability to sanitize water and surfaces without wasting water, and because there are no by-products. When its job is done, ozone gas quickly degrades into oxygen. Ozone is more effective than chlorine in destroying viruses and bacteria.\n\nIn 1990, the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA) identified aqueous ozone as a substance that is allowed for use in organic crop and livestock production. In 1997, it was approved by the FDA as an antimicrobial agent for use on food. In 2002, the FDA approved ozone for use on food contact areas and directly on food with its Generally Regarded as Safe (\u201cGRAS\u201d) designation.\n\nOzone is most commonly created by a process called \u201ccorona discharge\u201d, which causes oxygen molecules (O<sub>2</sub>) to temporarily re-combine into ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). This gas is very unstable, and the 3rd oxygen molecule reacts with pathogens by penetrating the cell walls of bacteria and viruses. This destroys the organisms.\n\nOzone is effective against pollutants for the same reason; it will react with long-chain carbon (organic) molecules, and break them down into less complex (and typically less harmful) molecules through oxidation.\n\nAdvances in ozone generation techniques, coupled with filtration, make this a viable new portable water purification method.\n\n===Solar water disinfection===\n{{Main|Solar water disinfection}}\nIn solar water disinfection (often shortened as \"sodis\"), microbes are destroyed by temperature and [[Ultraviolet#Explanation|UVA]] radiation provided by the [[sun]].  Water is placed in a transparent plastic [[polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] bottle or plastic bag, oxygenated by shaking partially filled capped bottles prior to filling the bottles all the way, and left in the sun for 6\u201324 hours atop a reflective surface.\n\n===Solar distillation===\n{{Main|Solar still}}\nSolar distillation relies on sunlight to warm and evaporate the water to be purified which then condenses and trickles into a container.  In theory, a solar (condensation) still removes all pathogens, salts, metals, and most chemicals but in field practice the lack of clean components, easy contact with dirt, improvised construction, and disturbances result in cleaner, yet contaminated water.\n\n===Homemade water filters===\nWater filters can be made on-site using local materials such as sand and [[charcoal]] (e.g. from firewood burned in a special way). These filters are sometimes used by soldiers and outdoor enthusiasts. Due to their low cost they can be made and used by anyone. The reliability of such systems is highly variable. Such filters can do little, if anything, to mitigate [[germ theory of disease|germs]] and other harmful constituents and can give a false sense of security that the water so produced is potable.

There were so many bottles and containers of polluted water being shipped, that [[Canada Post]] objected and stopped accepting them.

In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://omny.fm/shows/580-cfra/listen-now-lowell-green-signs-off-for-the-last-tim Lowell Green's final message on CFRA]\n*[https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=781131 CTV Ottawa on Lowell Green's retirement]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php CBSC 2008 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php CBSC 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php CBSC 1994 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "text_old": "{{in use}}\n{{short description|Canadian radio personality}}\n{{Use Canadian English|date=February 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox presenter\n|name        = Lowell Green\n|alias       = \n|image       = Lowell Green.jpg|<nowiki>Lowell Green]]</nowiki>\n|image_size  = \n|caption     = \n|birth_name  = \n|birth_date  = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1936|07|07}}\n|birth_place = [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], [[USA]]\n|death_date  = \n|death_place = \n|show        = ''The Lowell Green Show''\n|station     = [[CFRA (AM)|CFRA]] Ottawa\n|timeslot    = Weekdays 10 am to 12pm\n|show2       = \n|station2    = \n|timeslot2   = \n|style       = [[Talk radio]]\n|country     = Canada\n|prevshow    = Greenline\n|website     = \n|spouse      = Deborah Green\n|awards      = }}\n\n'''Lowell Green''' (born 7 July 1936) is a Canadian radio personality, journalist, and author, best known as the host of ''The Lowell Green Show'', a conservative morning [[talk show]] that aired on the [[Ottawa]] [[Ontario]] radio station [[CFRA]].

This has influenced the evolution of their scripts. The rounded letters of many of the [[Brahmic scripts|scripts of southern India, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia]] such as [[Oriya script|Oriya]] and [[Sinhala script|Sinhala]], [[Burmese script|Burmese]], and [[Javanese alphabet|Javanese]], for example, are thought to have been influenced by this: Sharp angles and tracing straight lines along the vein of the leaf with a sharp writing implement would risk splitting the leaf and ruining the surface, so rounded letters, or letters with straight lines only in the vertical or diagonal direction, were required for practical daily use.<ref>Sanford Steever, 'Tamil Writing', in Daniels & Bright, ''The World's Writing Systems'', 1996, p. 426</ref>\n\nIn such situations, the ribs of the leaves function as the dividing lines of [[ruled paper]], separating lines of text. It is believed that this was so influential in the development of the [[rongorongo]] script of Easter Island that the more elaborate wood tablets were fluted to imitate the surface of a banana leaf.<ref>{{cite book |author=Barthel, Thomas S. |authorlink=Thomas Barthel |year=1971 |title=Pre-contact Writing in Oceania | series = [http://www.sign-lang.uni-hamburg.de/BibWeb/LiDat.acgi?ID=39343 Current Trends in Linguistics] |volume=8 |pages=1169 |location=Den Haag, Paris |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter|Mouton]] }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Patravali]], a dried leaf eating plate\n* [[Banana leaf rice]]\n* ''[[Strelitzia]]'', a bird of paradise plant with similarly shaped leaves.\n* ''[[Cochinita pibil]]'', a Yucat\u00e1n Mexican dish that wraps pork in banana leaves.\n* ''[[Puto]]'', ''[[Bibingka]]'', and ''[[Suman (food)|Suman]]'', Filipino rice cakes which are traditionally wrapped in banana leaves.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n{{Banana}}\n\n{{Culinary wrappings}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Banana Leaf}}\n[[Category:Banana leaf| ]]\n[[Category:Objects used in Hindu worship]]\n[[Category:Writing media]]\n[[Category:Indian culture]]\n[[Category:Desi culture]]\n[[Category:Bananas in culture]]\n", "name_user": "Bhaveshbharwani9", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_leaf"}
