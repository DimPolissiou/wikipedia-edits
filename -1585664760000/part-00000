{"title_page": "Modular connector", "text_new": "{{short description|Electrical connector commonly used in telephone and computer networks}}\n\n{{Use American English|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:rjxx.jpg|thumb|Left to right, modular connectors: 8P8C plug, 6P6C plug, 6P4C plug, 4P4C plug, 6P6C jack.]]\n[[File:Uncrimped rj-45 connector close-up.jpg|thumb|An 8P8C modular plug. This is the common crimp type plug, of the same kind pictured above [[Crimp (joining)|crimped]] onto a cable (with molded sleeve).]]\n\nA '''modular connector''' is a type of [[electrical connector]] for cords and cables of electronic devices and appliances, such in computer networking, telecommunication equipment, and audio headsets.\n\nModular connectors were originally developed for use on specific [[Bell System]] telephone sets in the 1960s, and similar types found use for simple interconnection of customer-provided telephone subscriber premises equipment to the telephone network. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) mandated in 1976 an interface registration system, in which they became known as [[registered jack]]s. The convenience of prior existence for designers and ease of use led to a proliferation of modular connectors for many other applications.  Many applications that originally used a bulkier, more expensive connector have converted to modular connectors. Probably the best known applications of modular connectors are for telephone and [[Ethernet]].\n\nAccordingly, various electronic interface specifications exist for applications using modular connectors, which prescribe physical characteristics and assign electrical signals to their contacts.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nModular connectors are often referred to as ''modular phone jack and plug'', ''RJ connector'', and ''Western jack and plug''.  The term ''modular connector'' arose from its original use in modular wiring components of telephone equipment by the [[Western Electric Company]] in the 1960s.<ref name=krumreich /> This includes the [[6P2C]] used for telephone line connections and [[4P4C]] used for [[handset]] connectors.\n\n[[Registered jack]] designations describe the signals and wiring used for voice and data communication at customer-facing interfaces of the [[public switched telephone network]]. It is common to use a registered jack number to refer to the physical connector itself; for instance, the 8P8C modular connector type is often inaccurately labeled RJ45 because the registered jack standard of that name specified 8P8C modular connectors.  A common use of 8P8C connectors is [[Ethernet over twisted pair]]. Likewise, the 4P4C connector is sometimes erroneously called ''RJ9'' or ''RJ22''\u2014no such official designations exist\u2014and various six-position modular connectors may be incorrectly called ''RJ11''.\n\n==History==\nThe first types of small modular telephone connectors were created by AT&T in the mid-1960s for the plug-in handset and line cords of the [[Trimline]] telephone.<ref name=krumreich>Krumreich C.L., Mosing L.W., ''The Evolution of a Telephone'', Bell Laboratories Record 44(1) p.14 (January 1966)</ref> Driven by demand for multiple sets in residences with various lengths of cords, the Bell System introduced customer-connectable part kits and telephones, sold through ''PhoneCenter'' stores in the early 1970s.<ref>Walden S.W., ''Telephone Sets Go Mod (Modular, That Is)'', Bell Laboratories Record, Vol. 52(8) p. 238 (Sept. 1974)</ref> For this purpose, Illinois Bell started installing modular telephone sets on a limited scale in June 1972. The patents by Edwin C. Hardesty and coworkers, {{patent|US|3699498}} (1972) and {{patent|US|3860316}} (1975), followed by other improvements, were the basis for the modular molded-plastic connectors that became commonplace for telephone cords by the 1980s. In 1976, these connectors were standardized nationally in the United States by the Registration Interface program of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), which designated a series of [[Registered Jack]] (RJ) specifications for interconnection of customer-premises equipment to the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN).<ref>AT&T, ''Registration Interface\u2014Selection and General Information'', Bell System Practices, Section 463-400-100 Issue 1, May 1976</ref><ref name=FCC47Part68>[http://www.tscm.com/FCC47CFRpart68.pdf FCC 47 CFR Part 68 ''Connection of Terminal Equipment to the Telephone Network''], Section 68.502 superseded by T1.TR5-1999</ref>\n\n==Gender==\nModular connectors have [[Gender of connectors and fasteners|gender]]: ''plugs'' are considered to be ''male'', while ''jacks'' or ''sockets'' are considered to be ''female''. Plugs are used to terminate cables and cords, while jacks are used for fixed locations on surfaces of walls, panels, and equipment.  Other than telephone extension cables, cables with a modular plug on one end and a jack on the other are rare. Instead, cables are usually connected using a female-to-female coupler, having two jacks wired back-to-back.\n\n==Latching tab and orientation==\nModular connectors are designed to latch together.  As a plug is inserted into a jack, a plastic tab on the plug locks so that the plug cannot be pulled out. To remove the plug, the latching tab must be depressed against the plug to clear the locking edge. The standard orientation for installing a jack in a wall or panel is with the tab down.\n\nThe latching tab may easily snag on other cables and break off resulting in loss of the secure latching feature. To prevent this, tabs are often protected with a ''boot'' over the plug, or a special tab design, on '''{{visible anchor|snagless}}''' cords. Most protective boots must be installed onto a cable ''before'' the modular plug is crimped on.  This means that field retrofitting of these types of boots is not possible. However, protective boots or rigid protective ''ramp'' adapters are available which can be snapped over an installed unprotected modular plug.\n\n==Size and contacts==\n[[File:Rj45plug-8p8c.png|thumb|8P8C modular plug pin numbering.]]\n\nModular connectors are designated using two numbers that represent the maximum number of contact positions and the number of installed contacts, with each number followed by ''P'' and ''C'', respectively. For example, ''6P2C'' is a connector having six positions and two installed contacts. Alternate designations omit the letters while separating the position and contact quantities with either an ''x'' (''6x2'') or a slash (''6/2''). \n\nWhen not installed, contacts are usually omitted from the outer positions inward, such that the number of contacts is almost always even. The connector body positions with omitted or unconnected contacts are unused for the electrical connection but ensure that the plug fits correctly. For instance, [[RJ11]] cables often have connectors with six positions and four contacts, to which are attached just two wires.\n\nThe contact positions are numbered sequentially starting from 1. When viewed head-on with the retention mechanism on the bottom, jacks will have contact position number 1 on the left and plugs will have it on the right. Contacts are numbered by the contact position. For example, on a six-position, two-contact plug, where the outermost four positions do not have contacts, the innermost two contacts are numbered 3 and 4.\n\nModular connectors are manufactured in four sizes, with 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-positions. The insulating plastic bodies of 4P and 6P connectors have different widths, whereas 8P or 10P connectors share an even larger body width.  \n\n===Insulation displacement contact types===\n<gallery>\nRj-45 male compare.jpg|8P8C plug with contacts for solid wire (left) and stranded wire (right)\nRj-45 male compare 2.jpg|Contacts for solid wire (top left) and stranded wire (bottom right)\n</gallery>\n\nInternally, the contacts on the plugs have sharp prongs that, when [[Crimp (joining)|crimped]], pierce the wire insulation and connect with the conductor, a mechanism known as [[Insulation Displacement Connector|insulation displacement]]. Ethernet cables, in particular, may have solid or stranded ([[tinsel wire]]) conductors and the sharp prongs are different in the 8P8C connectors made for each type of wire. A modular plug for solid (single-strand) wire often has three slightly splayed prongs on each contact to securely surround and grip the conductor. Modular plugs for stranded have prongs that are designed to connect to multiple wire strands. Connector plugs are designed for either solid or stranded wire and a mismatch between plug and wire type may result in an unreliable connection.\n\n=== Interchangeability ===\nSome modular connectors are ''indexed'', meaning their dimensions are intentionally non-standard, preventing connections with connectors of standard dimensions. The means of indexing may be non-standard cross-sectional dimensions or shapes, retention mechanism dimensions or configuration. For example, a [[Modified Modular Jack]] using an offset latching tab was developed by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] to prevent accidental interchange of data and telephone cables.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|+Modular connector dimensions (millimeters){{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n|-\n!Connector\n!Length\n!Width\n!Height\n|-\n|4P4C\n|\n|7.7\n|\n|-\n|6P4C\n|12.34\n|9.65\n|6.60\n|-\n|8P8C\n|21.46\n|11.68\n|8.30\n|}\n\nThe dimensions of modular connectors are such that a narrower plug can be inserted into a wider jack that has more positions than the plug, leaving the jack's outermost contacts unconnected. The contact spacing is always 1.02&nbsp;mm (center to center). However, not all plugs from all manufacturers have this capability, and some jack manufacturers warn that their jacks are not designed to accept smaller plugs without damage. If an inserted plug lacks slots to accommodate the jack's contacts at the outermost extremes, it may permanently deform those outermost contacts of an incompatible jack.  Excessive resistance may be encountered when inserting an incompatible plug, as the outermost contacts in the jack are forcibly deformed.\n\nSpecial modular plugs have been manufactured (for example, the [[Siemon]] UP-2468<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siemon.com/e-catalog/ECAT_GI_page.aspx?GI_ID=mpc_universal-modular-plug|title=Universal Modular Plug}}</ref>) which have extra slots beyond their standard contacts, to accommodate the wider jack's outermost contacts without damage.  These special plug connectors can be visually identified by carefully looking for the extra slots molded into the plug.  The molded plastic bodies of the special plugs may also be colored with a light blueish tinge, to aid in quick recognition. The special plugs are preferred for test equipment and adapters, which may be rapidly connected to a large number of corresponding connectors in quick succession for testing purposes. The use of the special plugs avoids inadvertent damage to the equipment under test, even when a narrower plug is inserted into a nominally incompatible wider jack.\n\n==Termination==\n[[File:Crimping-pliers-pro-RJ-0a.jpg|thumb|right|A modular plug crimping tool with exchangeable crimping dies.]]\n\nTermination of cables with modular connectors is similar across the various number of positions and contacts in the plug. The crimping tool contains a die which is often exchangeable and is closely matched to the shape and pin count of the modular plug.\n\nA crimping die-set looks similar to an 8P8C jack, except for the eight teeth lining the top portion of the die. When the tool is operated, the die compresses around the 8P8C plug.  As the die compresses, these teeth force the plug contacts into the conductors of the cable being terminated. The crimper may also permanently deform part of the plastic plug body in such a way that it grips the outer sheath of the cable for secure fastening and [[strain relief]]. These actions permanently attach the plug to the cable.\n\n==Pinout==\nThe contact assignments ([[pinout]]) of modular connectors vary by application. Telephone network connections are standardized by [[registered jack]] designations, and [[Ethernet over twisted pair]] is specified by the [[TIA/EIA-568]] standard. For other applications, standardization may be lacking; for example, multiple conventions exist for the use of 8P8C connectors in [[RS-232]] applications. For this reason, [[D-sub]]-to-modular adapters are typically shipped with the D-sub contacts (pins or sockets) terminated but not inserted into the connector body, so that the D-sub-to-modular contact pairing can be assigned as needed.\n\n==4P4C==\n[[File:RJ9.jpg|thumb|right|4P4C modular connector on a handset cord.]]\n[[File:ATTtelephone-large.jpg|thumb|right|Wired telephone that uses 4P4C connectors for the coiled handset cord.]]\n\nThe four-position four-conductor ('''4P4C''') connector is the standard modular connector used on both ends of telephone [[handset]] cords, and is therefore often called a ''handset connector''.<ref>{{cite book | author = BICSI | title = Telecommunications Cabling Installation | edition = 2nd | date = October 7, 2002 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill Professional]] | isbn = 0-07-140979-3 | page = 88 | chapter = Background Information | quote = 4-position and 4-contact connectors are used primarily for telephone handset cords.}}</ref>\n\nThis handset connector is not a [[Registered Jack|registered jack]], because it was not intended to connect directly to telephone lines. However it is often referred to as ''RJ9'', ''RJ10'', or ''RJ22''.\n\n===Handset wiring===\n[[File:RJ9 Handset diagram.svg|Wiring diagram of 4P4C/RJ9 connector in telephone handset cord.]]\n\nHandsets and often [[Headset (audio)|headsets]] for use with telephones commonly use a 4P4C connector. The two center pins are commonly used for the receiver, and the outer pins connect the transmitter so that a reversal of conductors between the ends of a cord does not affect the signal routing. This may differ for other equipment, including hands-free headsets.\n\n===Data port===\nThe [[Macintosh 128K]], [[Macintosh 512K]] and [[Macintosh Plus]] from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] as well as the [[Amiga 1000]] from [[Commodore International|Commodore]] used 4P4C connectors to connect the keyboard to the main computer housing.  The connector provided power to the keyboard on the outer two contacts and received data signals on the inner pair. The cable between the computer and the keyboard was a coiled cord with an appearance very similar to a telephone handset cable.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.myoldcomputers.com/museum/comp/plus.htm | title = My Old Computers | contribution = Apple Macintosh Plus}}.</ref> The connector on the [[Amiga 1000]] used crossover wiring, similar to a telephone handset. The connector wiring on the Apple computers, however, required a polarized straight through pinout. Using a telephone handset cable instead of the supplied cable could short out the +5 volt DC supply and damage the Apple computer or the keyboard.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Megadon | url = http://www.megadon.co.uk/wb/whiteboardshow.pl/syrinx/wbfile=Mac%20Plus%20Keyboard%20Cable.wb/page=default.html | title = Syrinx | contribution = Mac Plus Keyboard Cable | place = UK | quote = ...the cable is the same as the telephone cable that connects handsets to the phone, unfortunately [...] this type of cable and pretty much any type of pre manufactured cable [...] is wired wrong for the Mac Plus.

For example, some [[DirecTV]] set top boxes include a 4P4C data port connector with an adapter cord to a computer serial port so that remote control is possible from the computer.<ref name=DirecTV>{{cite web | url = http://www.gbpvr.com/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Utility/DirecTVChannelControl | publisher = [[GB-PVR]] | type = wiki | title = Direc TV Channel Control | quote = Each end of a handset cord is wired opposite the other... |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019191930/http://www.gbpvr.com/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Utility/DirecTVChannelControl |archivedate=2008-10-19 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==6P6C {{anchor|6P6C|6P4C|6P2C}} ==<!-- Redirect target for [[6P6C]], [[6P4C]], [[6P2C]] -->\n[[File:Conector RJ11.jpg|thumb|6P4C crimp-on style connector.]]\nModular plugs are described by the maximum number of physical [[Electrical connector|contact]] positions and the actual number of contacts installed in these positions. The '''6P2C''', '''6P4C''', and '''6P6C''' modular connectors are probably best known for their use as [[RJ11]], [[RJ14]], and [[RJ25]] registered jacks, respectively. These interfaces use the same six-position modular connector body, but have different numbers of pins installed.\n\nRJ11 is a physical interface often used for terminating single telephone lines. RJ14 is similar, but for two lines, and RJ25 is for three lines. [[RJ61]] is a similar registered jack for four lines, but uses an 8P8C connector.\n\n===RJ11 wiring===\n[[File:Rj25 connector.jpg|thumb|6P6C connector showing the location of pin 1.]]\nCables sold as RJ11 often actually use 6P4C connectors (six positions, four contacts) and RJ14 wiring{{snd}}four wires running to a central [[junction box]]. Two of its six possible contact positions connect [[tip and ring]], and the other two contact positions may be unused or provide low-voltage power for night-light or other features on the telephone set. In some installations an extra contact was also required for the [[ground (electricity)|ground]] connection for [[Party line (telephony)|selective ringers]].\n\n===Pinout===\nThe pins of the 6P6C connector are numbered 1 to 6, counting left to right when holding the connector tab side down with the opening for the cable facing the viewer.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!

Older base units may accommodate the additional connectors of TAE (E, W, a2, b2) and may feature non-RJ standard sockets that can be connected directly to TAE plugs.  Further, flat DIN 47100 cables typically place the wires in ascending order.  When used directly with 6P4C plugs, the color coding may be undetermined.\n\n===Powered version of RJ11===\nIn the powered version of the RJ11 interface, pins 2 and 5 (black and yellow) may carry low voltage AC or DC power. While the telephone line on pins 3 and 4 (red and green) supplies enough power for most telephone terminals, old telephone terminals with incandescent lights, such as the Western Electric [[Princess telephone|Princess]] and [[Trimline telephone]]s, need more power than the phone line can supply. Typically, the power on pins 2 and 5 is supplied by an [[AC adapter]] plugged into a nearby power outlet which potentially even supplies power to all of the jacks in the house.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n===Compatibility with structured cabling===\nWith the proliferation of Ethernet [[local area network]]s operating over [[Category 5 cable|Cat5e]] and [[Category 6 cable|Cat6]] unshielded [[twisted pair]] cable, [[structured cabling]] networks adhering to [[TIA/EIA-568-B]], [[ISO/IEC 11801]] or ISO/IEC 15018 (home networks) are widely used for both computer networking and analog telephony, but these standards specify the T568-A or T568-B pin-outs compatible with [[Ethernet]]. The 8P8C (\"RJ45\") jack used by structured cabling physically accepts the 6-position connector used by RJ11, RJ14 and RJ25, but only RJ11 and RJ14 have full electrical compatibility. Ethernet compatible pin-outs \"split\" the third pair of RJ25 across two separate cable pairs, rendering that pair unusable by an analog phone. This was necessary to preserve the electrical properties of those pairs for Ethernet, which operates at much higher frequencies than analog telephony.\n\nBoth the third and fourth pairs of RJ61 are similarly split. Because of this incompatibility, and because they were never very common, the [[TIA/EIA-568#T568A and T568B termination|TIA/EIA-568-B]] conventions are displacing RJ25 and RJ61 for telephones with more than two lines.\n\n=={{visible anchor|8P8C|8P8C}}==\n[[File:Uncrimped rj-45 connector close-up.jpg|thumb|right|An 8P8C modular plug before being [[Crimp (joining)|crimped]] onto a cable.]]\nThe '''8 position 8 contact''' ('''8P8C''') connector is a modular connector commonly used to [[Electrical termination|terminate]] [[twisted pair]] and multi-conductor [[flat cable]]. These connectors are commonly used for [[Ethernet over twisted pair]], [[registered jack]]s and other telephone applications, [[RS-232]] serial communication  using the [[TIA/EIA-568]] and [[Yost cable|Yost]] standards, and other applications involving [[unshielded twisted pair]], [[shielded twisted pair]], and multi-conductor flat cable.\n\nAn 8P8C modular connection consists of a male plug and a female jack, each with eight equally-spaced contacts. On the plug, the contacts are flat metal bars positioned parallel to the connector body. Inside the jack, the contacts are metal spring wires arranged at an angle toward the insertion interface. When the plug is mated with the jack, the contacts meet and create an electrical connection. The spring tension of the jack contacts ensures a good interface.\n\n===== RJ45 [[Misnomer]]=====\n[[File:8P8C vs RJ45 female connectors.png|thumb|'''Left''': Generic 8P8C (or 8PMJ, 8-position modular jack) female connector.

It was intended for high speed modems, and is obsolete.\n\nTelephone installers who wired RJ45S modem jacks or RJ61X telephone jacks were familiar with the pin assignments of the standard. However, the standard un-keyed modular connectors became ubiquitous for computer networking, and informally inherited the name ''RJ45''.  RJ45S uses a keyed variety of the 8P body, meaning it has an extra tab that a common modular connector cannot mate with.\n\nBecause telephone RJ61 and data RJ45/RJ48 connectors were not widely used and 8P8C connectors in computers became ubiquitous, ''RJ45'' is used to refer to 8P8C un-keyed modular connectors. This practice is followed by electronics catalogs and many electronic equipment manuals. In common usage, RJ45 may also refer to the pin assignments for the attached cable, which are actually defined as [[TIA/EIA-568#Wiring|T568A and T568B]] in wiring standards such as [[TIA/EIA-568]].\n\n===Standardization===\nThe shape and dimensions of an 8P8C modular connector are specified for U.S. telephone applications by the Administrative Council for Terminal Attachment (ACTA) in national standard [[ANSI]]/TIA-1096-A. This standard does not use the short term 8P8C and covers more than just 8P8C modular connectors, but the 8P8C modular connector type is the eight position connector type described therein, with eight contacts installed. The international standard is ISO-8877.\n\nFor data communication applications ([[LAN]], [[structured cabling]]), International Standard IEC 60603 specifies in parts 7-1, 7-2, 7-4, 7-5, and 7-7 not only the same physical dimensions, but also high-frequency performance requirements for shielded and unshielded versions of this connector for frequencies up to 100, 250 and 600&nbsp;[[MHz]], respectively.\n\n===Pinout===\n[[File:RJ-45 TIA-568A Left.png|thumb|T568A wiring.]]\n[[File:RJ-45 TIA-568B Left.png|thumb|T568B wiring.]]\n8P8C connectors are frequently terminated using the T568A or T568B assignments that are defined in [[TIA/EIA-568-B|TIA/EIA-568]]. The drawings to the right show that the copper connections and pairing are the same, the only difference is that the orange and green pairs (colors) are swapped.  A cable wired as T568A at one end and wired as T568B at the other end (Tx and Rx pairs reversed) is an [[Ethernet crossover cable]]. Before the widespread acceptance of [[Medium Dependent Interface#Auto MDI-X|auto MDI-X]] capabilities, a crossover cable was needed to interconnect similar network equipment (such as [[Ethernet hub]]s to Ethernet hubs). A cable wired the same at both ends is called a [[Patch cable|\"patch\" or \"straight-through\" cable]], because no pin/pair assignments are swapped. Crossover cables are sometimes still used to connect two computers together without a switch or hub, however most network interface cards (NIC) in use today implement auto MDI-X to automatically configure themselves based on the type of cable plugged into them. If a \"patch\" or \"straight\" cable is used to connect two computers with auto MDI-X capable NICs, one NIC will configure itself to swap the functions of its Tx and Rx wire pairs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

While both types are similar, the tooling used to install the two different plug types cannot be interchanged.  WE/SS compatible plugs are available from a large number of manufacturers, whereas Tyco/AMP plugs are produced exclusively by [[Tyco Electronics]].{{cn|date=February 2019}} Both types of modular plugs can be mated with a standard 8P8C modular jack.\n\nWE/SS and Tyco/AMP 8P8C plugs have different spacings for the cable strain relief.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://belfuse.com/resources/StewartConnector/Stewart%20Data%20Sheets/CT300064.pdf | title = Stewart Connector 937-SP-3088 \u2013 Eight conductor/eight position line cord module | accessdate = 2018-04-18 | date = 2006-02-01 | format = PDF | publisher = Bel Stewart Connector | location = Glen Rock, Pennsylvania}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tycoelectronics.com/commerce/DocumentDelivery/DDEController?Action=showdoc&DocId=Customer+Drawing%7F554739%7FP%7Fpdf%7FEnglish%7FENG_CD_554739_P.pdf | title = Tyco/AMP 5-554739-2 \u2013 Modular plug assembly, 8 position, flat oval cable | accessdate  = 2009-09-10 | date = 2008-03-31 | format = PDF | publisher = Tyco Electronics | location = [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]}}</ref>  Using a WE/SS 8P8C crimp die set on a Tyco/AMP 8P8C plug crushes the top of the connector and damaged the crimp die set, and vice versa.\n\nBoth types of 8P8C plugs are available in shielded and unshielded varieties for different [[attenuation]] tolerances as needed. Shielded plugs are more expensive and require shielded cable, but have a lower attenuation, and may reduce [[signal noise]].\n\nAlthough a narrower 4-pin and 6-pin connector fits into the wider 8-pin jack, the smaller connector can potentially damage the springs of a larger jack, because the body of the smaller connector press onto the contacts. The body of a 6P6C or 8P8C plug typically projects out by more than one millimeter further than the contacts and presses the outermost contacts of the larger connector further than if a full-size connector were inserted.\n\n=== Applications ===\n8P8C are commonly used in computer networking and telephone applications, where the plug on each end is an 8P8C modular plug wired according to a TIA/EIA standard. Most wired Ethernet network communications today are carried over Category 5e or Category 6 cable with an 8P8C modular plug crimped on each end.\n\nThe 8P8C modular connector is also used for RS-232 serial interfaces according to the [[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]]/TIA-561 standard.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Zytrax | url = http://www.zytrax.com/tech/layer_1/cables/tech_rs232.htm#rj45 | title = Layer 1 | contribution = RJ45}}.</ref> This application is common as a console interface on network equipment such as [[Network switch|switches]] and [[router (computing)|router]]s. Other applications include other [[computer network|networking]] services such as ISDN and [[t-carrier|T1]].\n\nIn floodwired{{Efn | ''Floodwire'' is a chiefly British term for installing communications cables in a massive fashion in anticipation of their eventual use.}}  environments the center (blue) pair is often used to carry [[telephony]] signals. Where so wired, the physical layout of the 8P8C modular jack allows for the insertion of an RJ11 plug in the center of the jack, provided the RJ11 plug is wired in true compliance with the U.S. telephony standards (RJ11) using the center pair. The formal approach to connect telephony equipment is the insertion of a type-approved converter.\n\nThe remaining (brown) pair is increasingly used for [[Power over Ethernet]] (PoE).  Legacy equipment may use just this pair; this conflicts with other equipment, because some manufacturers previously [[short circuit]]ed unused pairs to reduce signal [[Crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]].{{Citation needed| date=September 2009}} Some routers, bridges and switches can be powered by the unused 4 lines\u2014blues (+) and browns (\u2212)\u2014to carry current to the unit. There is now a standardized wiring scheme for Power over Ethernet.\n\nDifferent manufacturers of 8P8C modular jacks arrange for the pins of the 8P8C modular connector jack to be linked to wire connectors (often IDC type terminals) that are in a different physical arrangement from that of other manufacturers: Thus, for example, if a technician is in the habit of connecting the white/orange wire to the \"bottom right hand\" IDC terminal, which links it to 8P8C modular connector pin 1, in jacks made by other manufacturers this terminal may instead connect to 8P8C modular connector pin 2 (or any other pin). Labels and manufacturer's documentation should be consulted whenever an unfamiliar connector is first encountered.\n\n8P8C modular connectors are also commonly used as a microphone connector for [[Professional mobile radio|PMR]], [[Land mobile radio|LMR]], and [[amateur radio]] transceivers.  Frequently the pinout is different, usually mirrored (i.e. what would be pins 1 to 8 in the TIA/EIA-568 standard might be pins 8 to 1 in the radio and its manual).\n\nIn landline telephony, an 8P8C jack is used at the point a line enters the building to allow the line to be broken to insert automatic dialing equipment, including [[intrusion alarm]] panels. In analog mobile telephony, the 8P8C connector was used to connect an [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]] cellular handset to its (separate) base unit; this usage is now obsolete.\n\nCommonly (and [[#8P8C|incorrectly]]) referred to as \"RJ45\", the physical connector is standardized as the IEC 60603-7 8P8C modular connector with different \"categories\" of performance. The physical dimensions of the male and female connectors are specified in ANSI/TIA-1096-A and ISO-8877 standards and normally wired to the T568A and T568B pinouts specified in the [[TIA/EIA-568#T568A and T568B termination|TIA/EIA-568]] standard to be compatible with both telephone and Ethernet.\n\nA similar standard jack once used for modem/data connections, the RJ45S, used a \"keyed\" variety of the 8P8C body with an extra tab that prevents it mating with other connectors; the visual difference compared to the more common 8P8C is subtle, but it is a different connector. The original RJ45S<ref name=\"HVS\" /><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.siemon.com/us/standards/13-24_modular_wiring_reference.asp |title= Modular Wiring Reference |publisher= Siemon |accessdate = 2010-10-14}}</ref> keyed 8P2C modular connector had pins 5 and 4 wired for tip and ring of a single telephone line and pins 7 and 8 shorting a programming resistor, but is obsolete today.\n\nElectronics catalogs commonly advertise 8P8C modular connectors as \"RJ45\".  An installer can wire the jack to any pin-out or use it as part of a generic [[structured cabling]] system such as ISO/IEC 15018 or [[ISO/IEC 11801]] using 8P8C patch panels for both phone and data.\n\n===Crossover cables===\nA router to router crossover cable uses two 8 position connectors and a [[Unshielded twisted pair|UTP]] (Unshielded Twisted Pair) cable with differently wired connectors at each end. Although a registered jack specifies the wiring pattern and corresponding form factor rather than just the pin assignments or the physical connector, crossover cables are often incorrectly marketed as \"RJ45 crossover cables\".\n\n==10P10C==\n[[File:10P10C-socket pinout.svg|thumb|The pin arrangement for a 10P10C socket.]]\n[[File:Connector10p10c.jpg|thumb|left|A 10P10C plug.]]\nThe 10P10C connector is commonly referred to as an '''RJ50''' connector, although this was never a standard registered jack in the Universal Service Order Codes. The 10P10C has 10 contact positions and 10 contacts.\n\nThe most common uses of the 10P10C connector are in proprietary data transfer systems,<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Pinouts guide | url = http://pinoutsguide.com/connector/10_pin_RJ50_10P10C_male_connector.shtml | title = 10 pin RJ50 (10P10C) male | type = connector diagram and applications}}</ref> such as the [[Digi International|Digiboard]]<ref name=\"Pinouts guide\">{{Citation | publisher = Pinouts guide | url = http://pinoutsguide.com/Electronics/Digi_portserver_pinout.shtml | title = Digi PortServer TS 10P10C (RJ50) Modular RS-232 pinout}}.</ref> and [[Avocent|Equinox Super-Serial]] multi-port [[EIA/TIA-232|TIA-232]] adapters.<ref name=\"Pinouts guide\"/> 10P10C connectors are also used to implement [[RS-485]] interfaces, and for data link connections in [[American Power Conversion|APC]] and [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]] [[uninterruptible power supplies]]. In the latter case, a keyed 10P10C plug with a protrusion on the pin 1 side near the back is used.\n\nThis connector is also used by some vendors, for example, [[Cyclades Corporation|Cyclades]] (later absorbed by Equinox) used pin 1 as an \"RI\" (ring indicator) signal, which is seldom used, allowing an 8P8C plug to be inserted to their 10P10C socket for most applications. The [[Cisco Systems]] STS-10X terminal server features this connector.  [[FordNet]], a five-pair communications networking medium, also used the 10P10C between terminals.\n\n[[Motorola]] uses the 10-pin connector as a microphone connector in several of their mobile radio product lines.\n\n[[Polycom]] utilizes this connector on their Conference Link bus to connect their HDX and Group Series codecs and microphones to their SoundStructure audio mixers, although pins 1 and 10 are not used.\n\nThe 10-pin connector is also used by [[Demag Cranes AG]]<ref>{{Citation | title = Demag cranes AG | url = http://www.demagcranes-ag.com/}}.</ref> in some pendant connections. [[National Instruments]] is also using the 10p10c connector for their NI 9237.<ref>{{Citation | title = NI 9237 4-Channel, \u00b125 mV/V, 24-Bit Simultaneous Bridge Module specifications |url = http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/208791}}.</ref>\n\n[[MTS Systems Corporation]] is using the 10p10c connector for their MTS FlexTest\u00ae Controller Family.\n\n==See also==\n*[[ARJ45]]\n*[[BS 6312]] \u2013 British equivalent to RJ25\n*[[EtherCON]] \u2013 ruggedized 8P8C Ethernet connector\n*[[GG45]]\n*[[Telephone plug]]\n*[[TERA]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Citation | last = Trulove | first = James | date = December 19, 2005 | title = LAN wiring | edition = 3rd | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | ISBN = 0-07-145975-8}}.\n\n==Standards==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ANSI/TIA-968-A: [https://www.part68.org/SecureDocuments/TIA-968-A-Final.pdf Telephone terminal equipment: Technical requirements for connection of terminal equipment to the telephone network]\n* ANSI/TIA-1096-A: Telecommunications telephone terminal equipment connector requirements for connection of terminal equipment to the telephone network\n* IEC 60603-7-1: Connectors for electronic equipment: Part 7-1: Detail specification for 8-way, shielded free and fixed connectors with common mating features, with assessed quality\n* IEC 60603-7-2: Connectors for electronic equipment: Part 7-2: Detail specification for 8-way, unshielded, free and fixed connectors, for data transmissions with frequencies up to 100&nbsp;MHz\n* IEC 60603-7-4: Connectors for electronic equipment: Part 7-4: Detail specification for 8-way, unshielded, free and fixed connectors, for data transmissions with frequencies up to 250&nbsp;MHz\n* IEC 60603-7-5: Connectors for electronic equipment: Part 7-5: Detail specification for 8-way, shielded, free and fixed connectors, for data transmissions with frequencies up to 250&nbsp;MHz\n* IEC 60603-7-7: Connectors for electronic equipment: Part 7-7: Detail specification for 8-way, shielded, free and fixed connectors, for data transmissions with frequencies up to 600&nbsp;MHz\n* ISO/IEC 8877, EN 28877: Information Technology\u2014Telecommunications and Information Exchange between Systems\u2014Interface Connector and Contact Assignments for ISDN Basic Access Interface Located at Reference Points S and T\n* [[Registered jack#References and notes|Registered Jack references]] are US government documents that define modular connectors for telecommunications.

This is the common crimp type plug, of the same kind pictured above [[Crimp (joining)|crimped]] onto a cable (with molded sleeve).]]\n\nA '''modular connector''' is a type of [[electrical connector]] for cords and cables of electronic devices and appliances, such in computer networking, telecommunication equipment, and audio headsets.\n\nModular connectors were originally developed for use on specific [[Bell System]] telephone sets in the 1960s, and similar types found use for simple interconnection of customer-provided telephone subscriber premises equipment to the telephone network. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) mandated in 1976 an interface registration system, in which they became known as [[registered jack]]s. The convenience of prior existence for designers and ease of use led to a proliferation of modular connectors for many other applications.  Many applications that originally used a bulkier, more expensive connector have converted to modular connectors. Probably the best known applications of modular connectors are for telephone and [[Ethernet]].\n\nAccordingly, various electronic interface specifications exist for applications using modular connectors, which prescribe physical characteristics and assign electrical signals to their contacts.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nModular connectors are often referred to as ''modular phone jack and plug'', ''RJ connector'', and ''Western jack and plug''.  The term ''modular connector'' arose from its original use in modular wiring components of telephone equipment by the [[Western Electric Company]] in the 1960s.<ref name=krumreich /> This includes the [[6P2C]] used for telephone line connections and [[4P4C]] used for [[handset]] connectors.\n\n[[Registered jack]] designations describe the signals and wiring used for voice and data communication at customer-facing interfaces of the [[public switched telephone network]]. It is common to use a registered jack number to refer to the physical connector itself; for instance, the 8P8C modular connector type is often inaccurately labeled RJ45 because the registered jack standard of that name specified 8P8C modular connectors.  A common use of 8P8C connectors is [[Ethernet over twisted pair]]. Likewise, the 4P4C connector is sometimes erroneously called ''RJ9'' or ''RJ22''\u2014no such official designations exist\u2014and various six-position modular connectors may be incorrectly called ''RJ11''.\n\n==History==\nThe first types of small modular telephone connectors were created by AT&T in the mid-1960s for the plug-in handset and line cords of the [[Trimline]] telephone.<ref name=krumreich>Krumreich C.L., Mosing L.W., ''The Evolution of a Telephone'', Bell Laboratories Record 44(1) p.14 (January 1966)</ref> Driven by demand for multiple sets in residences with various lengths of cords, the Bell System introduced customer-connectable part kits and telephones, sold through ''PhoneCenter'' stores in the early 1970s.<ref>Walden S.W., ''Telephone Sets Go Mod (Modular, That Is)'', Bell Laboratories Record, Vol. 52(8) p. 238 (Sept. 1974)</ref> For this purpose, Illinois Bell started installing modular telephone sets on a limited scale in June 1972. The patents by Edwin C. Hardesty and coworkers, {{patent|US|3699498}} (1972) and {{patent|US|3860316}} (1975), followed by other improvements, were the basis for the modular molded-plastic connectors that became commonplace for telephone cords by the 1980s. In 1976, these connectors were standardized nationally in the United States by the Registration Interface program of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), which designated a series of [[Registered Jack]] (RJ) specifications for interconnection of customer-premises equipment to the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN).<ref>AT&T, ''Registration Interface\u2014Selection and General Information'', Bell System Practices, Section 463-400-100 Issue 1, May 1976</ref><ref name=FCC47Part68>[http://www.tscm.com/FCC47CFRpart68.pdf FCC 47 CFR Part 68 ''Connection of Terminal Equipment to the Telephone Network''], Section 68.502 superseded by T1.TR5-1999</ref>\n\n==Gender==\nModular connectors have [[Gender of connectors and fasteners|gender]]: ''plugs'' are considered to be ''male'', while ''jacks'' or ''sockets'' are considered to be ''female''. Plugs are used to terminate cables and cords, while jacks are used for fixed locations on surfaces of walls, panels, and equipment.  Other than telephone extension cables, cables with a modular plug on one end and a jack on the other are rare. Instead, cables are usually connected using a female-to-female coupler, having two jacks wired back-to-back.\n\n==Latching tab and orientation==\nModular connectors are designed to latch together.  As a plug is inserted into a jack, a plastic tab on the plug locks so that the plug cannot be pulled out. To remove the plug, the latching tab must be depressed against the plug to clear the locking edge. The standard orientation for installing a jack in a wall or panel is with the tab down.\n\nThe latching tab may easily snag on other cables and break off resulting in loss of the secure latching feature. To prevent this, tabs are often protected with a ''boot'' over the plug, or a special tab design, on '''{{visible anchor|snagless}}''' cords. Most protective boots must be installed onto a cable ''before'' the modular plug is crimped on.  This means that field retrofitting of these types of boots is not possible. However, protective boots or rigid protective ''ramp'' adapters are available which can be snapped over an installed unprotected modular plug.\n\n==Size and contacts==\n[[File:Rj45plug-8p8c.png|thumb|8P8C modular plug pin numbering.]]\n\nModular connectors are designated using two numbers that represent the maximum number of contact positions and the number of installed contacts, with each number followed by ''P'' and ''C'', respectively. For example, ''6P2C'' is a connector having six positions and two installed contacts. Alternate designations omit the letters while separating the position and contact quantities with either an ''x'' (''6x2'') or a slash (''6/2''). \n\nWhen not installed, contacts are usually omitted from the outer positions inward, such that the number of contacts is almost always even. The connector body positions with omitted or unconnected contacts are unused for the electrical connection but ensure that the plug fits correctly. For instance, [[RJ11]] cables often have connectors with six positions and four contacts, to which are attached just two wires.\n\nThe contact positions are numbered sequentially starting from 1. When viewed head-on with the retention mechanism on the bottom, jacks will have contact position number 1 on the left and plugs will have it on the right. Contacts are numbered by the contact position. For example, on a six-position, two-contact plug, where the outermost four positions do not have contacts, the innermost two contacts are numbered 3 and 4.\n\nModular connectors are manufactured in four sizes, with 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-positions. The insulating plastic bodies of 4P and 6P connectors have different widths, whereas 8P or 10P connectors share an even larger body width.  \n\n===Insulation displacement contact types===\n<gallery>\nRj-45 male compare.jpg|8P8C plug with contacts for solid wire (left) and stranded wire (right)\nRj-45 male compare 2.jpg|Contacts for solid wire (top left) and stranded wire (bottom right)\n</gallery>\n\nInternally, the contacts on the plugs have sharp prongs that, when [[Crimp (joining)|crimped]], pierce the wire insulation and connect with the conductor, a mechanism known as [[Insulation Displacement Connector|insulation displacement]]. Ethernet cables, in particular, may have solid or stranded ([[tinsel wire]]) conductors and the sharp prongs are different in the 8P8C connectors made for each type of wire. A modular plug for solid (single-strand) wire often has three slightly splayed prongs on each contact to securely surround and grip the conductor. Modular plugs for stranded have prongs that are designed to connect to multiple wire strands. Connector plugs are designed for either solid or stranded wire and a mismatch between plug and wire type may result in an unreliable connection.\n\n=== Interchangeability ===\nSome modular connectors are ''indexed'', meaning their dimensions are intentionally non-standard, preventing connections with connectors of standard dimensions. The means of indexing may be non-standard cross-sectional dimensions or shapes, retention mechanism dimensions or configuration. For example, a [[Modified Modular Jack]] using an offset latching tab was developed by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] to prevent accidental interchange of data and telephone cables.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|+Modular connector dimensions (millimeters){{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n|-\n!Connector\n!Length\n!Width\n!Height\n|-\n|4P4C\n|\n|7.7\n|\n|-\n|6P4C\n|12.34\n|9.65\n|6.60\n|-\n|8P8C\n|21.46\n|11.68\n|8.30\n|}\n\nThe dimensions of modular connectors are such that a narrower plug can be inserted into a wider jack that has more positions than the plug, leaving the jack's outermost contacts unconnected. The contact spacing is always 1.02&nbsp;mm (center to center). However, not all plugs from all manufacturers have this capability, and some jack manufacturers warn that their jacks are not designed to accept smaller plugs without damage. If an inserted plug lacks slots to accommodate the jack's contacts at the outermost extremes, it may permanently deform those outermost contacts of an incompatible jack.  Excessive resistance may be encountered when inserting an incompatible plug, as the outermost contacts in the jack are forcibly deformed.\n\nSpecial modular plugs have been manufactured (for example, the [[Siemon]] UP-2468<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siemon.com/e-catalog/ECAT_GI_page.aspx?GI_ID=mpc_universal-modular-plug|title=Universal Modular Plug}}</ref>) which have extra slots beyond their standard contacts, to accommodate the wider jack's outermost contacts without damage.  These special plug connectors can be visually identified by carefully looking for the extra slots molded into the plug.  The molded plastic bodies of the special plugs may also be colored with a light blueish tinge, to aid in quick recognition. The special plugs are preferred for test equipment and adapters, which may be rapidly connected to a large number of corresponding connectors in quick succession for testing purposes. The use of the special plugs avoids inadvertent damage to the equipment under test, even when a narrower plug is inserted into a nominally incompatible wider jack.\n\n==Termination==\n[[File:Crimping-pliers-pro-RJ-0a.jpg|thumb|right|A modular plug crimping tool with exchangeable crimping dies.]]\n\nTermination of cables with modular connectors is similar across the various number of positions and contacts in the plug. The crimping tool contains a die which is often exchangeable and is closely matched to the shape and pin count of the modular plug.\n\nA crimping die-set looks similar to an 8P8C jack, except for the eight teeth lining the top portion of the die. When the tool is operated, the die compresses around the 8P8C plug.  As the die compresses, these teeth force the plug contacts into the conductors of the cable being terminated. The crimper may also permanently deform part of the plastic plug body in such a way that it grips the outer sheath of the cable for secure fastening and [[strain relief]]. These actions permanently attach the plug to the cable.\n\n==Pinout==\nThe contact assignments ([[pinout]]) of modular connectors vary by application. Telephone network connections are standardized by [[registered jack]] designations, and [[Ethernet over twisted pair]] is specified by the [[TIA/EIA-568]] standard. For other applications, standardization may be lacking; for example, multiple conventions exist for the use of 8P8C connectors in [[RS-232]] applications. For this reason, [[D-sub]]-to-modular adapters are typically shipped with the D-sub contacts (pins or sockets) terminated but not inserted into the connector body, so that the D-sub-to-modular contact pairing can be assigned as needed.\n\n==4P4C==\n[[File:RJ9.jpg|thumb|right|4P4C modular connector on a handset cord.]]\n[[File:ATTtelephone-large.jpg|thumb|right|Wired telephone that uses 4P4C connectors for the coiled handset cord.]]\n\nThe four-position four-conductor ('''4P4C''') connector is the standard modular connector used on both ends of telephone [[handset]] cords, and is therefore often called a ''handset connector''.<ref>{{cite book | author = BICSI | title = Telecommunications Cabling Installation | edition = 2nd | date = October 7, 2002 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill Professional]] | isbn = 0-07-140979-3 | page = 88 | chapter = Background Information | quote = 4-position and 4-contact connectors are used primarily for telephone handset cords.}}</ref>\n\nThis handset connector is not a [[Registered Jack|registered jack]], because it was not intended to connect directly to telephone lines. However it is often referred to as ''RJ9'', ''RJ10'', or ''RJ22''.\n\n===Handset wiring===\n[[File:RJ9 Handset diagram.svg|Wiring diagram of 4P4C/RJ9 connector in telephone handset cord.]]\n\nHandsets and often [[Headset (audio)|headsets]] for use with telephones commonly use a 4P4C connector. The two center pins are commonly used for the receiver, and the outer pins connect the transmitter so that a reversal of conductors between the ends of a cord does not affect the signal routing. This may differ for other equipment, including hands-free headsets.\n\n===Data port===\nThe [[Macintosh 128K]], [[Macintosh 512K]] and [[Macintosh Plus]] from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] as well as the [[Amiga 1000]] from [[Commodore International|Commodore]] used 4P4C connectors to connect the keyboard to the main computer housing.  The connector provided power to the keyboard on the outer two contacts and received data signals on the inner pair. The cable between the computer and the keyboard was a coiled cord with an appearance very similar to a telephone handset cable.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.myoldcomputers.com/museum/comp/plus.htm | title = My Old Computers | contribution = Apple Macintosh Plus}}.</ref> The connector on the [[Amiga 1000]] used crossover wiring, similar to a telephone handset. The connector wiring on the Apple computers, however, required a polarized straight through pinout. Using a telephone handset cable instead of the supplied cable could short out the +5 volt DC supply and damage the Apple computer or the keyboard.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Megadon | url = http://www.megadon.co.uk/wb/whiteboardshow.pl/syrinx/wbfile=Mac%20Plus%20Keyboard%20Cable.wb/page=default.html | title = Syrinx | contribution = Mac Plus Keyboard Cable | place = UK | quote = ...the cable is the same as the telephone cable that connects handsets to the phone, unfortunately [...] this type of cable and pretty much any type of pre manufactured cable [...] is wired wrong for the Mac Plus.

For example, some [[DirecTV]] set top boxes include a 4P4C data port connector with an adapter cord to a computer serial port so that remote control is possible from the computer.<ref name=DirecTV>{{cite web | url = http://www.gbpvr.com/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Utility/DirecTVChannelControl | publisher = [[GB-PVR]] | type = wiki | title = Direc TV Channel Control | quote = Each end of a handset cord is wired opposite the other... |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019191930/http://www.gbpvr.com/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Utility/DirecTVChannelControl |archivedate=2008-10-19 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==6P6C {{anchor|6P6C|6P4C|6P2C}} ==<!-- Redirect target for [[6P6C]], [[6P4C]], [[6P2C]] -->\n[[File:Conector RJ11.jpg|thumb|6P4C crimp-on style connector.]]\nModular plugs are described by the maximum number of physical [[Electrical connector|contact]] positions and the actual number of contacts installed in these positions. The '''6P2C''', '''6P4C''', and '''6P6C''' modular connectors are probably best known for their use as [[RJ11]], [[RJ14]], and [[RJ25]] registered jacks, respectively. These interfaces use the same six-position modular connector body, but have different numbers of pins installed.\n\nRJ11 is a physical interface often used for terminating single telephone lines. RJ14 is similar, but for two lines, and RJ25 is for three lines. [[RJ61]] is a similar registered jack for four lines, but uses an 8P8C connector.\n\n===RJ11 wiring===\n[[File:Rj25 connector.jpg|thumb|6P6C connector showing the location of pin 1.]]\nCables sold as RJ11 often actually use 6P4C connectors (six positions, four contacts) and RJ14 wiring{{snd}}four wires running to a central [[junction box]]. Two of its six possible contact positions connect [[tip and ring]], and the other two contact positions may be unused or provide low-voltage power for night-light or other features on the telephone set. In some installations an extra contact was also required for the [[ground (electricity)|ground]] connection for [[Party line (telephony)|selective ringers]].\n\n===Pinout===\nThe pins of the 6P6C connector are numbered 1 to 6, counting left to right when holding the connector tab side down with the opening for the cable facing the viewer.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!

At least one other vendor of flat 8-conductor cable uses the sequence blue, orange, black, red, green, yellow, brown and white/slate.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}}}\n{{efn-ua|name=German colors|This color scheme originates in the (withdrawn) national standard [[DIN 47100]]. The scheme shown here is the correct color code for interfacing with the RJ connector standards.}}\n}}\n\nHowever, with German domestic telephone equipment, and that in some neighboring countries, [[6P4C]] plugs and sockets are typically only used to connect the telephone cord to the phone base unit, whereas the mechanically different [[TAE connector]] is used at the other end to connect to a service provider interface. Older base units may accommodate the additional connectors of TAE (E, W, a2, b2) and may feature non-RJ standard sockets that can be connected directly to TAE plugs.  Further, flat DIN 47100 cables typically place the wires in ascending order.  When used directly with 6P4C plugs, the color coding may be undetermined.\n\n===Powered version of RJ11===\nIn the powered version of the RJ11 interface, pins 2 and 5 (black and yellow) may carry low voltage AC or DC power. While the telephone line on pins 3 and 4 (red and green) supplies enough power for most telephone terminals, old telephone terminals with incandescent lights, such as the Western Electric [[Princess telephone|Princess]] and [[Trimline telephone]]s, need more power than the phone line can supply. Typically, the power on pins 2 and 5 is supplied by an [[AC adapter]] plugged into a nearby power outlet which potentially even supplies power to all of the jacks in the house.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n===Compatibility with structured cabling===\nWith the proliferation of Ethernet [[local area network]]s operating over [[Category 5 cable|Cat5e]] and [[Category 6 cable|Cat6]] unshielded [[twisted pair]] cable, [[structured cabling]] networks adhering to [[TIA/EIA-568-B]], [[ISO/IEC 11801]] or ISO/IEC 15018 (home networks) are widely used for both computer networking and analog telephony, but these standards specify the T568-A or T568-B pin-outs compatible with [[Ethernet]]. The 8P8C (\"RJ45\") jack used by structured cabling physically accepts the 6-position connector used by RJ11, RJ14 and RJ25, but only RJ11 and RJ14 have full electrical compatibility. Ethernet compatible pin-outs \"split\" the third pair of RJ25 across two separate cable pairs, rendering that pair unusable by an analog phone. This was necessary to preserve the electrical properties of those pairs for Ethernet, which operates at much higher frequencies than analog telephony.\n\nBoth the third and fourth pairs of RJ61 are similarly split. Because of this incompatibility, and because they were never very common, the [[TIA/EIA-568#T568A and T568B termination|TIA/EIA-568-B]] conventions are displacing RJ25 and RJ61 for telephones with more than two lines.\n\n=={{visible anchor|8P8C|8P8C}}==\n[[File:Uncrimped rj-45 connector close-up.jpg|thumb|right|An 8P8C modular plug before being [[Crimp (joining)|crimped]] onto a cable.]]\nThe '''8 position 8 contact''' ('''8P8C''') connector is a modular connector commonly used to [[Electrical termination|terminate]] [[twisted pair]] and multi-conductor [[flat cable]]. These connectors are commonly used for [[Ethernet over twisted pair]], [[registered jack]]s and other telephone applications, [[RS-232]] serial communication  using the [[TIA/EIA-568]] and [[Yost cable|Yost]] standards, and other applications involving [[unshielded twisted pair]], [[shielded twisted pair]], and multi-conductor flat cable.\n\nAn 8P8C modular connection consists of a male plug and a female jack, each with eight equally-spaced contacts. On the plug, the contacts are flat metal bars positioned parallel to the connector body. Inside the jack, the contacts are metal spring wires arranged at an angle toward the insertion interface. When the plug is mated with the jack, the contacts meet and create an electrical connection. The spring tension of the jack contacts ensures a good interface.\n\n===== '''RJ45 [[Misnomer]]''' =====\n[[File:8P8C vs RJ45 female connectors.png|thumb|'''Left''': Generic 8P8C (or 8PMJ, 8-position modular jack) female connector.

TIA/EIA-568-B is often used for modular connectors used in Ethernet and telephone applications. Generic 8P8C modular connectors are similar to those used for the FCC RJ45 variants, although the RJ45S jack is not compatible with 8P8C modular connectors.\n\nThe original RJ45S jack mates with a keyed 8P2C modular plug,<ref name=\"HVS\">{{citation | url = http://www.hvs.on.ca/modular_jack_wiring.htm | publisher = HVS | location = Ontario, California | title = Modular jack wiring | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100208183720/http://www.hvs.on.ca/modular_jack_wiring.htm | archivedate = 2010-02-08 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | url = http://www.siemon.com/us/standards/13-24_modular_wiring_reference.asp | publisher = Siemon | title = Modular wiring reference}}</ref> and has pins 4 and 5 (the middle positions) wired for the ring and tip conductors of a single telephone line and pins 7 and 8 shorting a programming resistor. It was intended for high speed modems, and is obsolete.\n\nTelephone installers who wired RJ45S modem jacks or RJ61X telephone jacks were familiar with the pin assignments of the standard. However, the standard un-keyed modular connectors became ubiquitous for computer networking, and informally inherited the name ''RJ45''.  RJ45S uses a keyed variety of the 8P body, meaning it has an extra tab that a common modular connector cannot mate with.\n\nBecause telephone RJ61 and data RJ45/RJ48 connectors were not widely used and 8P8C connectors in computers became ubiquitous, ''RJ45'' is used to refer to 8P8C un-keyed modular connectors. This practice is followed by electronics catalogs and many electronic equipment manuals. In common usage, RJ45 may also refer to the pin assignments for the attached cable, which are actually defined as [[TIA/EIA-568#Wiring|T568A and T568B]] in wiring standards such as [[TIA/EIA-568]].\n\n===Standardization===\nThe shape and dimensions of an 8P8C modular connector are specified for U.S. telephone applications by the Administrative Council for Terminal Attachment (ACTA) in national standard [[ANSI]]/TIA-1096-A. This standard does not use the short term 8P8C and covers more than just 8P8C modular connectors, but the 8P8C modular connector type is the eight position connector type described therein, with eight contacts installed. The international standard is ISO-8877.\n\nFor data communication applications ([[LAN]], [[structured cabling]]), International Standard IEC 60603 specifies in parts 7-1, 7-2, 7-4, 7-5, and 7-7 not only the same physical dimensions, but also high-frequency performance requirements for shielded and unshielded versions of this connector for frequencies up to 100, 250 and 600&nbsp;[[MHz]], respectively.\n\n===Pinout===\n[[File:RJ-45 TIA-568A Left.png|thumb|T568A wiring.]]\n[[File:RJ-45 TIA-568B Left.png|thumb|T568B wiring.]]\n8P8C connectors are frequently terminated using the T568A or T568B assignments that are defined in [[TIA/EIA-568-B|TIA/EIA-568]]. The drawings to the right show that the copper connections and pairing are the same, the only difference is that the orange and green pairs (colors) are swapped.  A cable wired as T568A at one end and wired as T568B at the other end (Tx and Rx pairs reversed) is an [[Ethernet crossover cable]]. Before the widespread acceptance of [[Medium Dependent Interface#Auto MDI-X|auto MDI-X]] capabilities, a crossover cable was needed to interconnect similar network equipment (such as [[Ethernet hub]]s to Ethernet hubs). A cable wired the same at both ends is called a [[Patch cable|\"patch\" or \"straight-through\" cable]], because no pin/pair assignments are swapped. Crossover cables are sometimes still used to connect two computers together without a switch or hub, however most network interface cards (NIC) in use today implement auto MDI-X to automatically configure themselves based on the type of cable plugged into them. If a \"patch\" or \"straight\" cable is used to connect two computers with auto MDI-X capable NICs, one NIC will configure itself to swap the functions of its Tx and Rx wire pairs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

While both types are similar, the tooling used to install the two different plug types cannot be interchanged.  WE/SS compatible plugs are available from a large number of manufacturers, whereas Tyco/AMP plugs are produced exclusively by [[Tyco Electronics]].{{cn|date=February 2019}} Both types of modular plugs can be mated with a standard 8P8C modular jack.\n\nWE/SS and Tyco/AMP 8P8C plugs have different spacings for the cable strain relief.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://belfuse.com/resources/StewartConnector/Stewart%20Data%20Sheets/CT300064.pdf | title = Stewart Connector 937-SP-3088 \u2013 Eight conductor/eight position line cord module | accessdate = 2018-04-18 | date = 2006-02-01 | format = PDF | publisher = Bel Stewart Connector | location = Glen Rock, Pennsylvania}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tycoelectronics.com/commerce/DocumentDelivery/DDEController?Action=showdoc&DocId=Customer+Drawing%7F554739%7FP%7Fpdf%7FEnglish%7FENG_CD_554739_P.pdf | title = Tyco/AMP 5-554739-2 \u2013 Modular plug assembly, 8 position, flat oval cable | accessdate  = 2009-09-10 | date = 2008-03-31 | format = PDF | publisher = Tyco Electronics | location = [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]}}</ref>  Using a WE/SS 8P8C crimp die set on a Tyco/AMP 8P8C plug crushes the top of the connector and damaged the crimp die set, and vice versa.\n\nBoth types of 8P8C plugs are available in shielded and unshielded varieties for different [[attenuation]] tolerances as needed. Shielded plugs are more expensive and require shielded cable, but have a lower attenuation, and may reduce [[signal noise]].\n\nAlthough a narrower 4-pin and 6-pin connector fits into the wider 8-pin jack, the smaller connector can potentially damage the springs of a larger jack, because the body of the smaller connector press onto the contacts. The body of a 6P6C or 8P8C plug typically projects out by more than one millimeter further than the contacts and presses the outermost contacts of the larger connector further than if a full-size connector were inserted.\n\n=== Applications ===\n8P8C are commonly used in computer networking and telephone applications, where the plug on each end is an 8P8C modular plug wired according to a TIA/EIA standard. Most wired Ethernet network communications today are carried over Category 5e or Category 6 cable with an 8P8C modular plug crimped on each end.\n\nThe 8P8C modular connector is also used for RS-232 serial interfaces according to the [[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]]/TIA-561 standard.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Zytrax | url = http://www.zytrax.com/tech/layer_1/cables/tech_rs232.htm#rj45 | title = Layer 1 | contribution = RJ45}}.</ref> This application is common as a console interface on network equipment such as [[Network switch|switches]] and [[router (computing)|router]]s. Other applications include other [[computer network|networking]] services such as ISDN and [[t-carrier|T1]].\n\nIn floodwired{{Efn | ''Floodwire'' is a chiefly British term for installing communications cables in a massive fashion in anticipation of their eventual use.}}  environments the center (blue) pair is often used to carry [[telephony]] signals. Where so wired, the physical layout of the 8P8C modular jack allows for the insertion of an RJ11 plug in the center of the jack, provided the RJ11 plug is wired in true compliance with the U.S. telephony standards (RJ11) using the center pair. The formal approach to connect telephony equipment is the insertion of a type-approved converter.\n\nThe remaining (brown) pair is increasingly used for [[Power over Ethernet]] (PoE).  Legacy equipment may use just this pair; this conflicts with other equipment, because some manufacturers previously [[short circuit]]ed unused pairs to reduce signal [[Crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]].{{Citation needed| date=September 2009}} Some routers, bridges and switches can be powered by the unused 4 lines\u2014blues (+) and browns (\u2212)\u2014to carry current to the unit. There is now a standardized wiring scheme for Power over Ethernet.\n\nDifferent manufacturers of 8P8C modular jacks arrange for the pins of the 8P8C modular connector jack to be linked to wire connectors (often IDC type terminals) that are in a different physical arrangement from that of other manufacturers: Thus, for example, if a technician is in the habit of connecting the white/orange wire to the \"bottom right hand\" IDC terminal, which links it to 8P8C modular connector pin 1, in jacks made by other manufacturers this terminal may instead connect to 8P8C modular connector pin 2 (or any other pin). Labels and manufacturer's documentation should be consulted whenever an unfamiliar connector is first encountered.\n\n8P8C modular connectors are also commonly used as a microphone connector for [[Professional mobile radio|PMR]], [[Land mobile radio|LMR]], and [[amateur radio]] transceivers.  Frequently the pinout is different, usually mirrored (i.e. what would be pins 1 to 8 in the TIA/EIA-568 standard might be pins 8 to 1 in the radio and its manual).\n\nIn landline telephony, an 8P8C jack is used at the point a line enters the building to allow the line to be broken to insert automatic dialing equipment, including [[intrusion alarm]] panels. In analog mobile telephony, the 8P8C connector was used to connect an [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]] cellular handset to its (separate) base unit; this usage is now obsolete.\n\nCommonly (and [[#8P8C|incorrectly]]) referred to as \"RJ45\", the physical connector is standardized as the IEC 60603-7 8P8C modular connector with different \"categories\" of performance. The physical dimensions of the male and female connectors are specified in ANSI/TIA-1096-A and ISO-8877 standards and normally wired to the T568A and T568B pinouts specified in the [[TIA/EIA-568#T568A and T568B termination|TIA/EIA-568]] standard to be compatible with both telephone and Ethernet.\n\nA similar standard jack once used for modem/data connections, the RJ45S, used a \"keyed\" variety of the 8P8C body with an extra tab that prevents it mating with other connectors; the visual difference compared to the more common 8P8C is subtle, but it is a different connector. The original RJ45S<ref name=\"HVS\" /><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.siemon.com/us/standards/13-24_modular_wiring_reference.asp |title= Modular Wiring Reference |publisher= Siemon |accessdate = 2010-10-14}}</ref> keyed 8P2C modular connector had pins 5 and 4 wired for tip and ring of a single telephone line and pins 7 and 8 shorting a programming resistor, but is obsolete today.\n\nElectronics catalogs commonly advertise 8P8C modular connectors as \"RJ45\".  An installer can wire the jack to any pin-out or use it as part of a generic [[structured cabling]] system such as ISO/IEC 15018 or [[ISO/IEC 11801]] using 8P8C patch panels for both phone and data.\n\n===Crossover cables===\nA router to router crossover cable uses two 8 position connectors and a [[Unshielded twisted pair|UTP]] (Unshielded Twisted Pair) cable with differently wired connectors at each end. Although a registered jack specifies the wiring pattern and corresponding form factor rather than just the pin assignments or the physical connector, crossover cables are often incorrectly marketed as \"RJ45 crossover cables\".\n\n==10P10C==\n[[File:10P10C-socket pinout.svg|thumb|The pin arrangement for a 10P10C socket.]]\n[[File:Connector10p10c.jpg|thumb|left|A 10P10C plug.]]\nThe 10P10C connector is commonly referred to as an '''RJ50''' connector, although this was never a standard registered jack in the Universal Service Order Codes. The 10P10C has 10 contact positions and 10 contacts.\n\nThe most common uses of the 10P10C connector are in proprietary data transfer systems,<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Pinouts guide | url = http://pinoutsguide.com/connector/10_pin_RJ50_10P10C_male_connector.shtml | title = 10 pin RJ50 (10P10C) male | type = connector diagram and applications}}</ref> such as the [[Digi International|Digiboard]]<ref name=\"Pinouts guide\">{{Citation | publisher = Pinouts guide | url = http://pinoutsguide.com/Electronics/Digi_portserver_pinout.shtml | title = Digi PortServer TS 10P10C (RJ50) Modular RS-232 pinout}}.</ref> and [[Avocent|Equinox Super-Serial]] multi-port [[EIA/TIA-232|TIA-232]] adapters.<ref name=\"Pinouts guide\"/> 10P10C connectors are also used to implement [[RS-485]] interfaces, and for data link connections in [[American Power Conversion|APC]] and [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]] [[uninterruptible power supplies]]. In the latter case, a keyed 10P10C plug with a protrusion on the pin 1 side near the back is used.\n\nThis connector is also used by some vendors, for example, [[Cyclades Corporation|Cyclades]] (later absorbed by Equinox) used pin 1 as an \"RI\" (ring indicator) signal, which is seldom used, allowing an 8P8C plug to be inserted to their 10P10C socket for most applications.

Many '''royal heirs''' stayed in the Kuchesar Fort as a means of furthering profits stemming from India, thus increasing the trading depot's popularity. Eventually government officials closed the fort due to a significant number of [[Death|deaths]] and [[Disease|illnesses]]. Many theorized that a heap of overgrowing plants was responsible for the \"unhealthy environment\". Recently, the locals of [[Kuchesar]] took the initiative to clear away the plants that once grew all over the building.

The [[Jat people]] competed with the [[Maratha]]s, the [[Rohilla|Rohillas,]] and French colonists and explorers, as well as the [[British East India Company]], after the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]]. Kuchesar Fort was also a center for the Rai Brahmins, also called Bhatts \u2013 a branch of [[Kashmiri Brahmins]]. They were the Rajkavi of Kuchesar State (Rajkavis are similar to [[Poet laureate|poets laureate]]). Rai Moti Bhatt was the last Rajkavi of the Kuchesar State.\n\nThe rulers of Kuchesar built the fort in 1734 and maintained state population and awareness records. The fort was granted to Ramdhan Singh's family on a perpetual lease by the Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]] in 1790 (this grant was confirmed by the [[British Raj|British]] in 1807). Ajit Singh's family acquired Kuchesar Fort during the 18th century when the [[Najib ad-Dawlah]] bestowed the Jat family with the title of [[Rao Bahadur]] (Rai Bahadur).\nThe fort served as the erstwhile seat of Jat Kingdom of Uttar Pradesh. The fort is well-preserved and has been transformed into one of the most exotic heritage resorts in India.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Restoration and present-day operations==\nThe fort was restored and turned into a heritage-style hotel in 1994.

Eventually government officials closed the fort due to a significant number of [[Death|deaths]] and [[Disease|illnesses]]. Many theorized that a heap of overgrowing plants was responsible for the \"unhealthy environment\". Recently, the locals of [[Kuchesar]] took the initiative to clear away the plants that once grew all over the building. It was restored and is now known as \"Mud Hotel\" in the state of '''''[[Uttar Pradesh, India]],''''' and acts as a tourist attraction for the city. \n\n==History==\nKuchesar Fort was the seat of the Jat Princely estate at [[Kuchesar]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsFarEast/IndiaJatsMinorKings.htm|title=Kingdoms of South Asia - Minor Indian Kingdoms of the Jats|website=www.historyfiles.co.uk|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> during the [[Mughal Empire]] and the [[British Raj]]. The [[Jat people]] competed with the [[Maratha]]s, the [[Rohilla|Rohillas,]] and French colonists and explorers, as well as the [[British East India Company]], after the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]]. Kuchesar Fort was also a center for the Rai Brahmins, also called Bhatts \u2013 a branch of [[Kashmiri Brahmins]]. They were the Rajkavi of Kuchesar State (Rajkavis are similar to [[Poet laureate|poets laureate]]). Rai Moti Bhatt was the last Rajkavi of the Kuchesar State.\n\nThe rulers of Kuchesar built the fort in 1734 and maintained state population and awareness records. The fort was granted to Ramdhan Singh's family on a perpetual lease by the Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]] in 1790 (this grant was confirmed by the [[British Raj|British]] in 1807). Ajit Singh's family acquired Kuchesar Fort during the 18th century when the [[Najib ad-Dawlah]] bestowed the Jat family with the title of [[Rao Bahadur]] (Rai Bahadur).\nThe fort served as the erstwhile seat of Jat Kingdom of Uttar Pradesh. The fort is well-preserved and has been transformed into one of the most exotic heritage resorts in India.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Restoration and present-day operations==\nThe fort was restored and turned into a heritage-style hotel in 1994.
