It connects a number of the city's most important buildings and precincts. There are more high rise buildings here than on any other street in Australia. Amongst Australia's [[Australian Securities Exchange#Market indices|100 largest listed companies]], more are located here than on any other street.\n\nThe street begins in the north end of Sydney in [[The Rocks, New South Wales|The Rocks]], near the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], and extends to the southern end of the city, near [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central station]] and [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]], where it leads into [[Railway Square]]. From here [[Broadway, New South Wales|Broadway]] is the continuation of George Street turning westwards, leading to the western suburbs as [[Parramatta Road]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:George Street Henry Curzon Allport.jpg|thumb|''George Street'' (1842) by Henry Curzon Allport]]\nThe origins of George Street lie in the layout of the [[Sydney Cove]] colony. Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] placed the [[convicts]] and [[Royal Marines|marines]] on the rocky western slopes of the bay. A track leading from the convicts' encampment in the area of The Rocks, past the marine [[barracks]] and alongside the banks of a stream to a brick pit, located near to the present location of Central station. This track that eventually became George Street is one of the two original thoroughfares, along with the track that became [[Bridge Street, Sydney|Bridge Street]]. It is possible that George Street was the first street in Australia.\n\nUntil 1810 George Street was generally referred to as [[High Street]] in the English custom, although the northern part of the thoroughfare was also sometimes referred to as \"Sergeant Major's Row\" and, earlier, as \"Spring Row\" (since water carriers had originally established the route as a link between the Tank Stream, the Military encampment and the hospital).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shfa.nsw.gov.au/sydney-About_us-Our_heritage_role-Heritage_and_Conservation_Register.htm&objectid=4500026|title=Heritage and Conservation Register|author=|date=|work=nsw.gov.au|accessdate=22 July 2015}}</ref> The Street was formally named for King [[George III of the United Kingdom]] by Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] in 1810.\n[[File:George Street Sydney 1883.jpg|thumb|right|''George Street'' (1883), oil on canvas by Alfred Tischbauer]]\n[[File:Kodak Australia Building, George Street, Sydney, 1930s.jpg|thumb|right|The Kodak Australia building, George Street, circa 1930s.]]\nOn 8 August 1907 at Bateman's Crystal Hotel on George Street, a meeting resolved to form the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League]], Australia's first professional rugby football association and predecessor to the modern-day [[National Rugby League]].<ref>{{cite book \n|title= The best ever Australian Sports Writing|last= Cunneen|first= Chris|year= 2001|publisher= Black Inc|location= Australia|isbn= 1-86395-266-7|page= 316\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=66OBschGE_YC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate= 19 February 2011}}</ref> In 1937, [[Frank Jenner]] committed to telling ten different people on George Street about [[Christianity]] every day thenceforward.<ref>{{Cite news|work=ASSIST News Service |author=Peter Wooding |date=25 March 2011 |title=Worldwide impact of a humble street preacher lives on today |url=http://www.assistnews.net/Stories/2011/s11030178.htm |accessdate=19 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054407/http://www.assistnews.net/Stories/2011/s11030178.htm |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nUntil 2016, George Street was the route for Sydney's [[Anzac Day]] parade until made unavailable by [[CBD and South East Light Rail]] construction work.

From south to north, they include:\n*[[Railway Square]]: the southern end of George Street is a confluence of several busy streets. It is so-named because it is adjacent to the [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney Central station]], and the square itself is the site of a large bus terminus. Railway Square is today ringed by hotels and small-scale retail, and is also the site of a campus of the [[Sydney Institute of TAFE]].\n*[[Sydney Chinatown|Chinatown]]: Sydney's traditional, main [[Chinatown]] is located in [[Haymarket, New South Wales|Haymarket]], near to the southern end of George Street. The Chinatown precinct is situated mostly to the west of the street but also extends to the east of the street. A centre of retail shops and restaurants, features of Chinatown located close to George Street include a tree stump (near the intersection with Hay Street) gilded in [[gold]] and dripping water, which was presented to the Chinese community of Sydney with the message that it would [[Feng Shui|bring good fortune]] to them. Close by is the Capitol Theatre, which often hosts the Sydney runs of international [[musical theater|musicals]]. The Haymarket Library of the City of Sydney, which is the main branch of the City library service for [[Chinese language]] materials, is located on George Street.\n*Cinema District: Situated on the hill overlooking Chinatown, this area used to feature the three largest cinemas in Sydney, however the three cinemas (Hoyts, Greater Union and Village) merged their theatres into one complex, which was ultimately bought out by [[Greater Union]] in December 2005.  The Cinema District also houses many [[video arcade]]s, [[Internet cafe]]s, [[fast food]] restaurants and [[pubs]] and is very busy after dark.\n*[[Sydney Town Hall|Town Hall]]: Along the central section of George Street, this precinct is noted as the location of three important historic buildings: [[St. Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney|St Andrew's Cathedral]], the Sydney Town Hall; and the [[Queen Victoria Building]] shopping centre. These are well served by [[Town Hall railway station, Sydney|Town Hall station]]. The surrounding area features large scale retail operations, such as the main Sydney store of the department store [[Myer]]. [[Pitt Street Mall]], a large retail precinct, is located close by.\n*[[Wynyard, Sydney|Wynyard]]: The area along George Street from [[King Street, Sydney|King Street]] in the south up to Alfred Street in the north is given over largely to offices of large corporations and financial institutions, interspersed with retail, large hotels and large-scale bars and entertainment facilities. An important cross street in this precinct is [[Martin Place]], the location of the [[Cenotaph]] and the [[General Post Office, Sydney|Sydney General Post Office]]. [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard railway station]] is located in the northern part of this precinct.\n*[[The Rocks, New South Wales|The Rocks]]: At the northern end of George Street, north of Alfred Street, is The Rocks, the location of the first British settlement in Australia begun in 1788. There are many souvenir shops, restaurants and traditional [[pubs]], as well as art galleries and the Museum of Contemporary Art. Here George Street ends as it reaches [[Port Jackson]] (Sydney Harbour). The area is dominated by the approaches to the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], and faces the [[Sydney Opera House]] across [[Circular Quay]]. [[Circular Quay railway station]] and [[Circular Quay ferry wharf|ferry terminals]] are located nearby.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:George Street near Hunter Street, Sydney from The Powerhouse Museum Collection.jpg|left|thumb|[[Trams in Sydney|Trams]] on George Street, near [[Hunter Street, Sydney|Hunter Street]], in the early 1900s]]\nOn 8 December 1899, an [[Trams in Sydney|electric tramway]] was opened along George Street to [[Harris Street]].<ref>Keenan,D. ''Tramways of Sydney''. Transit Press 1979</ref> This reduced the traditional dependence on horses and human feet. In 1959 the trams were replaced by diesel buses. Until October 2015, George Street was the busiest street in Sydney in terms of number of buses per hour; most bus services to the inner western and north-western suburbs travelled along part of or most of George Street.\n\nMany of the principal railway stations in the Sydney city centre are located on or near George Street. At the southern end of George Street, [[Railway Square]] is named after the adjacent [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney Central station]]. Further north, [[Town Hall railway station, Sydney|Town Hall station]] is located under George Street near the [[Sydney Town Hall]]. This station was opened in 1932, as part of the construction of the [[City Circle]], when the George Street roadway was opened outside the [[Sydney Town Hall]]. Further north still, [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard underground station]] was constructed in the same period at a location adjacent to George Street, with a major entrance to George Street near [[Hunter Street, Sydney|Hunter Street]].

It connects a number of the city's most important buildings and precincts. There are more high rise buildings here than on any other street in Australia. Amongst Australia's [[Australian Securities Exchange#Market indices|100 largest listed companies]], more are located here than on any other street.\n\nThe street begins in the north end of Sydney in [[The Rocks, New South Wales|The Rocks]], near the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], and extends to the southern end of the city, near [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central station]] and [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]], where it leads into [[Railway Square]]. From here [[Broadway, New South Wales|Broadway]] is the continuation of George Street turning westwards, leading to the western suburbs as [[Parramatta Road]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:George Street Henry Curzon Allport.jpg|thumb|''George Street'' (1842) by Henry Curzon Allport]]\nThe origins of George Street lie in the layout of the [[Sydney Cove]] colony. Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] placed the [[convicts]] and [[Royal Marines|marines]] on the rocky western slopes of the bay. A track leading from the convicts' encampment in the area of The Rocks, past the marine [[barracks]] and alongside the banks of a stream to a brick pit, located near to the present location of Central station. This track that eventually became George Street is one of the two original thoroughfares, along with the track that became [[Bridge Street, Sydney|Bridge Street]]. It is possible that George Street was the first street in Australia.\n\nUntil 1810 George Street was generally referred to as [[High Street]] in the English custom, although the northern part of the thoroughfare was also sometimes referred to as \"Sergeant Major's Row\" and, earlier, as \"Spring Row\" (since water carriers had originally established the route as a link between the Tank Stream, the Military encampment and the hospital).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shfa.nsw.gov.au/sydney-About_us-Our_heritage_role-Heritage_and_Conservation_Register.htm&objectid=4500026|title=Heritage and Conservation Register|author=|date=|work=nsw.gov.au|accessdate=22 July 2015}}</ref> The Street was formally named for King [[George III of the United Kingdom]] by Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] in 1810.\n[[File:George Street Sydney 1883.jpg|thumb|right|''George Street'' (1883), oil on canvas by Alfred Tischbauer]]\n[[File:Kodak Australia Building, George Street, Sydney, 1930s.jpg|thumb|right|The Kodak Australia building, George Street, circa 1930s.]]\nOn 8 August 1907 at Bateman's Crystal Hotel on George Street, a meeting resolved to form the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League]], Australia's first professional rugby football association and predecessor to the modern-day [[National Rugby League]].<ref>{{cite book \n|title= The best ever Australian Sports Writing|last= Cunneen|first= Chris|year= 2001|publisher= Black Inc|location= Australia|isbn= 1-86395-266-7|page= 316\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=66OBschGE_YC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate= 19 February 2011}}</ref> In 1937, [[Frank Jenner]] committed to telling ten different people on George Street about [[Christianity]] every day thenceforward.<ref>{{Cite news|work=ASSIST News Service |author=Peter Wooding |date=25 March 2011 |title=Worldwide impact of a humble street preacher lives on today |url=http://www.assistnews.net/Stories/2011/s11030178.htm |accessdate=19 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054407/http://www.assistnews.net/Stories/2011/s11030178.htm |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nUntil 2016, George Street was the route for Sydney's [[Anzac Day]] parade until made unavailable by [[CBD and South East Light Rail]] construction work.

From south to north, they include:\n*[[Railway Square]]: the southern end of George Street is a confluence of several busy streets. It is so-named because it is adjacent to the [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney Central station]], and the square itself is the site of a large bus terminus. Railway Square is today ringed by hotels and small-scale retail, and is also the site of a campus of the [[Sydney Institute of TAFE]].\n*[[Sydney Chinatown|Chinatown]]: Sydney's traditional, main [[Chinatown]] is located in [[Haymarket, New South Wales|Haymarket]], near to the southern end of George Street. The Chinatown precinct is situated mostly to the west of the street but also extends to the east of the street. A centre of retail shops and restaurants, features of Chinatown located close to George Street include a tree stump (near the intersection with Hay Street) gilded in [[gold]] and dripping water, which was presented to the Chinese community of Sydney with the message that it would [[Feng Shui|bring good fortune]] to them. Close by is the Capitol Theatre, which often hosts the Sydney runs of international [[musical theater|musicals]]. The Haymarket Library of the City of Sydney, which is the main branch of the City library service for [[Chinese language]] materials, is located on George Street.\n*Cinema District: Situated on the hill overlooking Chinatown, this area used to feature the three largest cinemas in Sydney, however the three cinemas (Hoyts, Greater Union and Village) merged their theatres into one complex, which was ultimately bought out by [[Greater Union]] in December 2005.  The Cinema District also houses many [[video arcade]]s, [[Internet cafe]]s, [[fast food]] restaurants and [[pubs]] and is very busy after dark.\n*[[Sydney Town Hall|Town Hall]]: Along the central section of George Street, this precinct is noted as the location of three important historic buildings: [[St. Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney|St Andrew's Cathedral]], the Sydney Town Hall; and the [[Queen Victoria Building]] shopping centre. These are well served by [[Town Hall railway station, Sydney|Town Hall station]]. The surrounding area features large scale retail operations, such as the main Sydney store of the department store [[Myer]]. [[Pitt Street Mall]], a large retail precinct, is located close by.\n*[[Wynyard, Sydney|Wynyard]]: The area along George Street from [[King Street, Sydney|King Street]] in the south up to Alfred Street in the north is given over largely to offices of large corporations and financial institutions, interspersed with retail, large hotels and large-scale bars and entertainment facilities. An important cross street in this precinct is [[Martin Place]], the location of the [[Cenotaph]] and the [[General Post Office, Sydney|Sydney General Post Office]]. [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard railway station]] is located in the northern part of this precinct.\n*[[The Rocks, New South Wales|The Rocks]]: At the northern end of George Street, north of Alfred Street, is The Rocks, the location of the first British settlement in Australia begun in 1788. There are many souvenir shops, restaurants and traditional [[pubs]], as well as art galleries and the Museum of Contemporary Art. Here George Street ends as it reaches [[Port Jackson]] (Sydney Harbour). The area is dominated by the approaches to the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], and faces the [[Sydney Opera House]] across [[Circular Quay]]. [[Circular Quay railway station]] and [[Circular Quay ferry wharf|ferry terminals]] are located nearby.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:George Street near Hunter Street, Sydney from The Powerhouse Museum Collection.jpg|left|thumb|[[Trams in Sydney|Trams]] on George Street, near [[Hunter Street, Sydney|Hunter Street]], in the early 1900s]]\nOn 8 December 1899, an [[Trams in Sydney|electric tramway]] was opened along George Street to [[Harris Street]].<ref>Keenan,D. ''Tramways of Sydney''. Transit Press 1979</ref> This reduced the traditional dependence on horses and human feet. In 1959 the trams were replaced by diesel buses. Until October 2015, George Street was the busiest street in Sydney in terms of number of buses per hour; most bus services to the inner western and north-western suburbs travelled along part of or most of George Street.\n\nMany of the principal railway stations in the Sydney city centre are located on or near George Street. At the southern end of George Street, [[Railway Square]] is named after the adjacent [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney Central station]]. Further north, [[Town Hall railway station, Sydney|Town Hall station]] is located under George Street near the [[Sydney Town Hall]]. This station was opened in 1932, as part of the construction of the [[City Circle]], when the George Street roadway was opened outside the [[Sydney Town Hall]]. Further north still, [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard underground station]] was constructed in the same period at a location adjacent to George Street, with a major entrance to George Street near [[Hunter Street, Sydney|Hunter Street]]. Nearer to the northern end of the street, the [[Circular Quay railway station|Circular Quay station]] is located adjacent to George Street.\n\n===Light rail development===\n{{Further|CBD and South East Light Rail}}\n[[File:George Street at Hunter Street, Sydney.jpg|thumb|George Street at [[Hunter Street, Sydney|Hunter Street]]]]\nIn response to increasing bus congestion in the CBD, on 13 December 2012, the NSW Government announced a commitment to build a [[CBD and South East Light Rail|light rail]] from [[Circular Quay]] down George Street to [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central station]], then up Devonshire Street, across to [[Moore Park, New South Wales|Moore Park]] and down [[Anzac Parade, Sydney|Anzac Parade]].

The construction of the H\u00f4tel began in 1555 and was not yet completed when Pierre d'Ass\u00e9zat died in 1581. It is an outstanding example of Renaissance palaces architecture of southern France, with an elaborate decoration of the ''[[cour d'honneur]]'' (''courtyard'') influenced by Italian [[Mannerism]] and by [[classicism]]. The use of brick is typical of Toulouse. The H\u00f4tel now belongs to the City of Toulouse and was restored in the 1980s.\n\n==Presentation==\nPierre Ass\u00e9zat was at the height of his social and professional success when he launched the construction of his mansion close to the Merchant Exchange, of which he had been one of the founders. Nevertheless, he did get caught up in the religious troubles of the time. A Calvinist convert, he was obliged to leave Toulouse after attempting to seize the town along with his fellows [[capitouls]] in 1562. He recanted ten years later and returned to his townhouse in Toulouse where he died in 1581.<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\"/>\n\nAss\u00e9zat launched the first phase of construction in 1555\u20131557. The main L-shaped structure was built along with the staircase pavilion in the corner. The stonemason Jean Castagni\u00e9 was entrusted with carrying out the masonry works defined by the architect [[Nicolas Bachelier]]. The designs of the fa\u00e7ades, featuring twin columns which develop regularly over three floors (Doric, Ionic, Corinthian), takes their inspiration from the great classical models such as the [[Coliseum]]. The capitals also precisely adhere to classical models, known from engravings. The erudite architecture\u2014its source can also be traced to the treatises of the royal architect [[Sebastiano Serlio]]\u2014expresses order and regularity. On the deaths of Castagni\u00e9 and Bachelier the construction work stopped; it was restarted in 1560 under the direction of Dominique Bachelier, son of Nicolas. He undertook the creation of the loggia and the passageway, which divided up the courtyard, and the street gate. Much polychrome interplay (brick/stone) and various ornaments (cabochons, diamonds, masks) evoke luxury, surprise and abundance, themes peculiar to mannerist architecture.<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\"/>\n\n==Main gate==\nThe monumental gate designed by Dominique Bachelier combines power with delicacy. The gateway arch takes a certain rhythm from several projecting stones decorated with small dots. Serlio's Extraordinary Book of Doors contain this type of composition and it was used on several occasions by Toulousain architects ([[H\u00f4tel de Felzins|H\u00f4tel de Molinier]] and H\u00f4tel de Massas). The Doric pilasters that frame the gate display an alternating succession of diamond-shaped stone, which gives the ensemble a precious aspect. In the upper section the Ionic pilasters around the mullioned window are fluted and delicately ornamented. And with the table that surmounts it, the composition imparts a refined sophistication. Thus, Dominique Bachelier was able to offer the owner a complete composition which evoked both power and a delicate erudition.<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\"/>\n\n==The passageway and the consoles==\nIn the courtyard, the passageway features arches decorated with diamond-shaped stone. They rest on large scrolled consoles, whose fronts are decorated with grotesque masks of different design. On the side, the rolls of the scrolls engender plant pods and cloves. Each console is borne upon a lion foot standing on a section of pilaster capped underneath with a magnificent rose. These consoles illustrate, by themselves, the manneristic aesthetic on the unusual and the association of opposites, combining mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms. These refined motifs, heightened through the polychrome interplay and relief of the passageway, were much appreciated by contemporaries and inspired details on other buildings, such as H\u00f4tel de Massas and [[Lar\u00e9ole]] Castle.<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\"/>\n\n==Staircase term==\nIn the stairwell, on the landing of the first floor, stands the impressive figure of a male term. Half man, half pilaster, his face grimacing and his hands holding a cushion placed on his head to reduce the pain, this term was condemned to support the weight of the console. Although a symbol of knowledge in the sense that it alludes to mythology (Atlas and Hercules), this motif also amuses thanks to an association of opposites, such as the straining muscles and the soft cushion. Cariatid termes and other telamons were much appreciated in Renaissance Toulouse, notable examples can be found on the windows of [[H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin]] and on the main gate of [[H\u00f4tel de Bagis]].<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\"/>\n\n==Bemberg Foundation==\n[[File:Bemberg Fondation Toulouse - Portrait de Charles IX - Fran\u00e7ois Clouet - Inv.1012.jpg|thumb|120px|left|''[[Charles IX of France]]'' by [[Fran\u00e7ois Clouet]].]]\n[[File:Entr\u00e9e de la Fondation Bemberg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Entrance of the Foundation seen from the courtyard.]]\nSince 1994, the H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat has housed the '''Bemberg Foundation''' (''Fondation Bemberg''), an art gallery which presents to the public one of the major private collections of art in Europe: the personal collection of the wealthy Argentine Georges Bemberg (1915\u20132011).

Although a symbol of knowledge in the sense that it alludes to mythology (Atlas and Hercules), this motif also amuses thanks to an association of opposites, such as the straining muscles and the soft cushion. Cariatid termes and other telamons were much appreciated in Renaissance Toulouse, notable examples can be found on the windows of [[H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin]] and on the main gate of [[H\u00f4tel de Bagis]].<ref name=\"Toulouse-Renaissance\"/>\n\n==Bemberg Foundation==\n[[File:Bemberg Fondation Toulouse - Portrait de Charles IX - Fran\u00e7ois Clouet - Inv.1012.jpg|thumb|120px|left|''[[Charles IX of France]]'' by [[Fran\u00e7ois Clouet]].]]\n[[File:Entr\u00e9e de la Fondation Bemberg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Entrance of the Foundation seen from the courtyard.]]\nSince 1994, the H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat has housed the '''Bemberg Foundation''' (''Fondation Bemberg''), an art gallery which presents to the public one of the major private collections of art in Europe: the personal collection of the wealthy Argentine Georges Bemberg (1915\u20132011). His foundation was created in collaboration with the City of Tolouse. The large Bemberg collection features paintings, drawings, sculptures, ancient books and furniture. Paintings and drawings are the highlights of the collection, especially 19th and early 20th century French paintings (with [[impressionism]], [[Nabis]], [[post-impressionism]] and [[fauvism]]) and Venetian paintings of the 16th and 18th centuries.\n\nThe painting and drawing collection includes an impressive set of 30 paintings  by [[Pierre Bonnard]] and 18th century Venetian paintings by [[Canaletto]], [[Francesco Guardi]], [[Pietro Longhi]], [[Rosalba Carriera]], [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini]], [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]]. 18th century French painting is represented by [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]], [[Nicolas Lancret]], [[Elisabeth Vig\u00e9e-Lebrun]] and [[Hubert Robert]].\n\nFrom the Flemish and Netherlandish schools of painting are artworks by the studio of [[Rogier van der Weyden]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Gerard David]], [[Adriaen Isenbrandt]], [[Joachim Patinir]], [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]], [[Frans Pourbus the Elder]]. For the 17th century paintings are displayed by [[Antoon Van Dyck]], [[Pieter de Hooch]], [[Nicolaes Maes]], [[Jan Van Goyen]], [[Philips Wouwerman]], [[Isaac van Ostade]].\n\nItalian Renaissance painting is centered on Venice with paintings by [[Paris Bordone]], [[Jacopo Bassano]], [[Titian]], [[Paul Veronese]] and [[Tintoretto]] while for the 17th century there are works by [[Pietro Paolini]], [[Giovanni Battista Carlone]], [[Evaristo Baschenis]], [[Mattia Preti]].\n\nFrench Renaissance and 17th century painting are represented with [[Jean Clouet]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Clouet]], [[Nicolas Tournier]] while the Foundation bought in 2018 a canvas by Spanish painter [[Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n]].\n\nFrench painting from the second half of the 19th century is well represented with paintings by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Boudin]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[\u00c9douard Vuillard]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Paul S\u00e9rusier]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Louis Valtat]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Gustave Caillebotte]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Paul Signac]] and [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]].\n\n20th century French art is represented by [[Georges Rouault]], [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Albert Marquet]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Kees van Dongen]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Othon Friesz]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and [[Maurice Utrillo]].\n\n==Pictures==\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\" caption=\"H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat\"> \nBachelier - H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat - Toulouse - Entr\u00e9e Place d'Ass\u00e9zat.jpg|Entrance on Place d'Ass\u00e9zat.\nAssezat-pavillon-entree.jpg|Entrance pavilion\nAssezat-02(12).jpg|Main gate\nAssezat - portail - inspiration Serlio-en.jpg|Influence of an engraving by Serlio\nAssezat-hautduportail_01.jpg|Frieze of metopes\nAssezat-amerindien.jpg|Detail of the main gate with Native American figure\nAssezat 1.jpg|Details of the metopes of the main gate frieze\nBachelier - H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat - Toulouse - La cour d'honneur.jpg|The inner courtyard\nBachelier - H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat - Toulouse - La tour.jpg|The Tower\nAssezat-sommet.jpg|The top of the tower\nAssezat-02(8).jpg|Classic facade\nAssezat-Serlio-en.jpg|Another influence of an engraving by Serlio\nAssezat-colonnes-jumelles.jpg|Fluted and rudented columns\nAssezat-dorique.jpg|Doric capitals\nAssezat-ionique.jpg|Ionic capitals\nAssezat-corinthien.jpg|Corinthian capitals\nToulouse-assezat-porte-escalier.jpg|Door of the main staircase\nAssezat-escalier.jpg|The staircase\nAssezat-02(9).jpg|Staircase term\nBachelier - H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat - Toulouse - Entr\u00e9e de l'Union des Acad\u00e9mies et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Savantes.jpg|Entrance of the Union of Academies and Learned societies.\nAssezat-02(7).jpg|Detail of the entrance to the Academies\nBachelier - H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat - Toulouse - Coursive du mur Est.jpg|Passageway of the east wall\nArc_coursi\u00e8re_Ass\u00e9zat.jpg|Support arch\nAssezat-masque_(1).jpg|Mannerist decor\nAssezat-masque_(2).jpg|Mannerist decor\nAssezat 2.jpg|Mannerist decorations\nAssezat-15(1).jpg|Ionic consoles and pods\nAssezat-02(11).jpg|Loggia\nAssezat-heurtoir.jpg|Knocker\nFenetre-assezat-cour_(1).jpg|Window\nFenetre-serlienne-assezat.jpg|Serlian window\nFen\u00eatre_Renaissance_\u00e0_Toulouse-_H\u00f4tel_d'Ass\u00e9zat.jpg|Merchant's office window on the street\nFenetre-assezat-cour_(2).jpg|Merchant's office window on the courtyard\nAssezat-mufles-lions_(2).jpg|Lion muzzle serving as a gargoyle\n</gallery>\n\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\" caption=\"Bemberg foundation\"> \nBemberg fondation Toulouse- Portrait de Lady Dorothy Dacre - inv 1090 - 126x101.jpg|[[Anthony Van Dyck]], ''Portrait of Dorothy, Lady Dacre''\nBemberg Fondation Toulouse - Le clocher de Saint-Tropez - Paul Signac.jpg|''Le clocher de Saint-Tropez'' by  [[Paul Signac]] (1896)\nBemberg_Fondation_Toulouse_-_Sc\u00e8ne_d'auberge_-_Pieter_Brueghel_le_Jeune_-_Inv.1059.jpg|[[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]]\nBemberg_fondation_Toulouse_-_Les_amoureux_-_Lucas_Cranach_l'Ancien.jpg|[[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]\nBemberg_Fondation_Toulouse_-_V\u00e9nus_et_Cupidon_-_Lucas_Cranach_(I)_-_1531_Inv.1015.jpg|[[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]\nBemberg_Fondation_Toulouse_-_Bateaux_sur_la_plage_\u00e0_Etretat_-_Claude_Monet_-_1883_65x81_Inv.2077.jpg|[[Claude Monet]]\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Bruno Tollon, ''H\u00f4tels de Toulouse'', p. 313\u2013318, in ''Congr\u00e8s arch\u00e9ologique de France. 154e session.

The Naqsh-e Rustam compound incorporates memorials of the [[Elam]]ites, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] and the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanians]] in itself in addition to the mentioned structure.\n\nThe Ka'ba-ye Zartosht is {{convert|46|m}} from the mountain, situated exactly opposite [[Darius II]]'s mausoleum. It is rectangular and has only one entrance door. The material of the structure is white [[limestone]]. It is about {{convert|12|m}} high, or {{convert|14.12|m}} if including the triple stairs, and each side of its base is about {{convert|7.30|m}} long. Its entrance door leads to the chamber inside via a thirty-stair stone stairway. The stone pieces are rectangular and are simply placed on top of each other, without the use of [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]; the sizes of the stones varies from {{convert|0.48|by|2.10|by|2.90|m}} to {{convert|0.56|by|1.08|by|1.10|m}}, and they are connected to each other by [[dovetail joint]]s. The structure was built in the Achaemenid era and there is no information of the name of the structure in that era. It was called ''Bon-Khanak'' in the Sassanian era; the local name of the structure was ''Kornaykhaneh'' or ''Naggarekhaneh''; and the phrase ''Ka'ba-ye Zartosht'' has been used for the structure since the [[14th century|fourteenth century]], into the [[Contemporary history|contemporary era]].\n\nVarious views and interpretations have been proposed about the application of the chamber, but none of them could be accepted with certainty: some consider the tower a [[fire temple]] and a fireplace, and believe that it was used for igniting and worshiping the holy fire, while another group rejects this view and considers it the mausoleum of one of the Achaemenid [[shah]]s or grandees, due to its similarity to the [[Tomb of Cyrus]] and some mausoleums of [[Lycia]] and [[Caria]]. Some other [[Iranian studies|Iranian scholars]] believe the stone chamber to be a structure for the safekeeping of royal documents and holy or religious books; however, the chamber of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht is too small for this purpose. Other less noticed theories, such as its being a temple for the goddess [[Anahita]] or a [[solar calendar]], have also been mentioned.\n\nThree [[Epigraphy|inscriptions]] have been written in the three languages [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian]] [[Middle Persian]], [[Parthian Empire|Arsacid]] Middle Persian and [[Greek language|Greek]] on the Northern, Southern and Eastern walls of the tower, in the Sassanian era.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Middle Persian Inscriptions|last=Henning|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> One of them belongs to [[Shapur I]] the Sassanian, and the other to the priest [[Kartir]].

As the shape of the structure was cuboid and the black stones that were placed on the white background of its walls resembled the [[Black Stone]], the [[Muslim]]s' [[Kaaba]], it became famous as ''Ka'ba-ye Zartosht'', the ''Kaaba of Zoroaster''.<ref name=\":04\">{{Cite book|title=The Illustrated Description of Naqsh-e Rustam|last=Shahbazi|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica|Encyclopedia Iranica]]'' explains about the name of the structure: \"Ka'ba-ye Zartosht has probably acquired its name in the fourteenth century, the time that the ruined ancient sites in the whole [[Iran]] were attributed to characters in the ''[[Quran]]'' or ''[[Shahnameh]]''. This does not mean that the place has been [[Zoroaster]]'s mausoleum and there is also no report of the [[pilgrim]]s' travels there for [[pilgrimage]].\"<ref name=\"Gropp\">{{Cite book|title=\"KA\u02bfBA-YE ZARDO\u0160T\".

Each of those stones are {{convert|7.30|m}} long, connected to each other by dovetail joints, and the chipping method used to form them has given the roof the shape of a short pyramid. The [[anathyrosis]] style is used here in placing the stones atop each other, but no accurate order is retained in the 'ranking' of the stones. In some places, 20 rows, and in others 22 rows of stones are placed, and this continues to the ceiling. Wherever the original builders discovered any flaw in the main stone, the flawed area was removed and filled in with delicate joints, some of which still remain.<ref name=\":04\"/>\n[[File:Kabe_Zartosht-6.JPG|thumb|Rectangular pits on the outer walls of the structure]]\n\nIn order to prevent the finished building from becoming too simple or monochrome, its creators added two architectural diversities: firstly, forming double-edged shelves from one or two flat plates of grey-black stone and placing them on the walls; secondly, carving small rectangular pits into the upper and middle sections of the outer walls that give a more delicate appearance to the tower's faces. The black stones were probably brought from Mount Mehr in [[Persepolis]], and installed on the walls in three rows:<ref name=\":04\"/>\n* High on the walls just below the ceiling, a small rectangular shelf in the northern side, and two similar shelves on each of the other sides\n* {{convert|3|m|spell=In}} below the ceiling, two large square shelves on three sides and one small rectangular shelf on the northern side\n* {{convert|6|m|spell=In}} below the ceiling, two medium-sized rectangular shelves on three sides and one large rectangular on the northern side\n\n=== Stairway ===\n[[File:Kabe_Zartosht-Stairs.JPG|thumb|The stairway of the structure]]\n\nA thirty-stair stairway (each stair is {{convert|2|to|2.12|m}} long, {{convert|26|cm}} wide and {{convert|26|cm}} high) is placed in the middle of the northern wall, reaching the threshold of the entrance doorway. Thus, the intention was for the Ka'ba to look like a three-floor tower that has seven doors or hatches on each floor; but only one hatch has been made into a true door, while the others are left as holeless blind windows.<ref name=\":04\"/>\n\nThe structure stands on a three-tiered platform. The first tier is {{convert|27|cm}} above the ground, and the tower is {{convert|14.12|m|ftin}} high including the triple tiers or stairs of its platform. The base is square-shaped, with each side approximately {{convert|7.30|m}} long. The ceiling of the structure is smooth and flat on the inside, but its roof has a bilateral slope that begins from the line in the middle of the rooftop on the outside, creating the pyramid-like appearance previously mentioned. The doorway is {{convert|1.75|m}} high and {{convert|87|cm}} wide and has at one point had a very heavy two-panel door which is now missing: there are carved-out notches for the upper and lower heels of each door panel in the stone frame which are entirely obvious to modern observers.<ref name=\":42\"/> Some have assumed that the door would have been made of wood, but a stone door of the same kind exists in Solomon's Prison in [[Pasargadae]], very similar to the remains of the one found in Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, which indicates that both doors were made of stone.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Sasanian Civilization|last=Sami|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> The doorway leads to a single interior room. This space is quadrangular, has an area of {{convert|3.74|by|3.72|m}}, and is {{convert|5.5|m}} high, with the thickness of its walls being between {{convert|1.54|and|1.62|m}}.<ref name=\":04\"/>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Naqsh-eRostam_Chardin.jpg|thumb|A picture of [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] painted by [[Jean Chardin]] in 1723]]\nThe Ka'ba-ye Zartosht is undoubtedly from the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] era. Much of the available evidence shows that it was built in the early Achaemenid era; the most important evidence for this dating is as follows:<ref name=\":04\"/>\n* Using black stone on a white background is one of the features of [[Pasargadae|Pasargadian]] architecture.\n* The [[dovetail joint]]s are found mostly in the periods of [[Darius I]] and [[Xerxes I]], and the way the stones are aligned is similar to the primary structures of [[Persepolis]].\n* The doorway and door of the structure is similar to those of the Achaemenid [[shah]]s' mausoleums, all of which have used the design of Darius I's mausoleum.\n* The masonry, which lacks [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] or ordering, resembles the first parts of the platform of Persepolis that were constructed in Darius I's period. Especially, the [[Epigraphy|inscription]] on the lower part of the southern wall of Persepolis is almost the same size as the stones forming the ceiling of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht.\n[[File:Ka'ba-ye_Zartosht_35.jpg|thumb|Photograph of the excavations performed by the [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Oriental Institute]] of the [[University of Chicago]]]]\n[[Carsten Niebuhr]], who had visited the structure in 1765, writes: \"Opposite the mountain that has the mausoleums and [[petroglyph]]s of [[Rostam]]'s braveries, a small structure is built of white stone that is covered by only two pieces of large stones.\"<ref name=\":42\">{{Cite book|title=Kartir and His Inscription in Ka'ba-ye Zartosht|last=Rajabi|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> [[Jane Dieulafoy]], who visited [[Iran]] in 1881, also reports in her [[Travel literature|travel journal]]: \"...and then we saw a quadrilateral structure that was placed opposite the walls of the cliff.

Besides, the fact that they did or could close the only entrance door of a structure with a heavy and two-panel door, makes it clear that its content should be kept safe from robbery and pollution.</blockquote>\n\n=== Fireplace ===\n[[Engelbert Kaempfer]] first proposed the assumption of being a [[fire temple]] or fireplace; and following him, [[James Justinian Morier]] and [[Robert Ker Porter]] supported the view in the early [[19th century|nineteenth century]]. The southwestern corner of the chamber is blackened by smoke; and has caused the assumption that the holy fire was glowing in there.<ref name=\":04\"/>\n[[File:Autophradate_l.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Vadfradad I]] (Autophradates I).

One of the reasons of this group is that [[Darius I]] says in the [[Behistun Inscription]] (First column, 63): \"...I rebuilt the temples that [[Gaumata]] had destructed. I returned the pastures, flocks, slaves and houses that Gaumata had taken to the people...\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Commands of the Achaemenid Shahanshahs|last=Sharpp|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Thus, there were some \"temples\" in the periods of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus II]] and [[Cambyses II]] that Gaumata destructed and Darius rebuilt them the same way; and since \"Solomon's Prison\" in [[Pasargadae]] is belonging to the first [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] era and destructed, and its exact copy was built in [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] in Darius's period, it should be concluded that those two structures are the mentioned temples in the Behistun Inscription; and since any temple in [[Iran|Persia]] during Darius's period could not be anything other than the holy fire, those were all fireplaces;<ref name=\":04\"/> besides, Ka'ba-ye Zartosht has been conserved well even after the Achaemenid era and was not surrounded by soil and stones; and in the beginning of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] era, [[Shapur I]] composed the most important document of the Sasanian history on it and [[Kartir]] wrote a religious document on it. These show that the structure was religiously important. On the other hand, a structure is drawn on the coins of some [[Iran|Persian]] kings like those of Otophradates I that is a fireplace and the royal fire was kept above or inside it; and since the structure has a two-stair platform and its two doors are like Ka'ba-ye Zartosht and the center of the Persian kingdom was also in the city of [[Istakhr]], it is the very Ka'ba-ye Zartosht that is drawn on their coins; and on the ceiling of this structure are put three fireboxes and the Persian king is standing in a praying posture in front of it.<ref name=\":04\"/><ref>{{Cite book|title=The History of the Civilization of Sasanian Persia|last=Nafisi|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nHowever, these reasons can not be true, for \"Ayadana\" only means \"worshiping place\" and a worshiping place is not necessarily a temple; and on the other hand, if you want to say that the people worshiped in this place, it is not true, for the Ka'ba is so small that the compound within can not fit more that two persons.<ref name=\":3\" /> Furthermore, according to [[Herodotus]] (section \"On the Customs of the Persians\"), the Persians, even in his time, had no temples or statues of gods. [[Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin]] in ''[[Iranica]]'' identifies the ayadana as podiums.<ref>http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ayadana-place-of-cult</ref>\n\nAdditionally, in Achaemenid seals and on their mausoleums, it is seen that the fireboxes containing the royal fire were placed in the free space; and the royal fire was taken before the king in a portable firebox. A remarkable point that [[Ernst Herzfeld|Herzfeld]], Sami and [[Mary Boyce]] have made is that it seems improbable to have spent all that price and effort in order to keep the fire in a dark and holeless room that needed the door open for the fire to ignite.<ref name=\":04\"/> Because fire requires [[oxygen]] and the inside of the Ka'ba is built in a way that even an [[oil lamp]] can not glow more than a few hours when the door and the large stone entrance are sealed.<ref name=\":3\" /> The chamber does not have an exit way for smoke while its entrance door has always been sealed.<ref name=\"Gropp\"/><ref name=\":03\" />\n\nThe structure on the coins of Persian kings can not be Ka'ba-ye Zartosht; for the mentioned picture on the coins was not higher than {{convert|2|m}}, had a two-stair platform and no stairway is seen below its doorway; its entrance door is much larger relative to the structure than that of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht; its ceiling has no steepness, enough to be put three fireboxes on; there is no distance between its doorway and the ceiling; it has no crowns or [[Portal (architecture)|portals]]; and the dents showing the heads of its arrows are not more than six. These features generally contradict with those of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht.<ref name=\":04\"/>\n\n=== Mausoleum ===\n[[File:Kabe_Zartosht_Dieulafoy.gif|thumb|Ka'ba-ye Zartosht in the [[19th century|nineteenth century]], by [[Jane Dieulafoy]]]]\nMost of the researchers assume the tower as the mausoleum of one of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] [[shah]]s. Since it is very similar to the [[Tomb of Cyrus]] and some of the mausoleums of [[Lycia]] and [[Caria]] in shape, solidness of architecture and having a small room with a very heavy door, it is considered a mausoleum. Welfram Klyse and [[David Stronach]] believe that the Achaemenid structures in [[Pasargadae]] and [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] might have been influenced by [[Urartu|Urartian]] art in the tower-like temples of Urartu.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Iran|last=Fisher|first=W.B.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia|Aristobulus]], one of the retainers of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander III of Macedon]], mentions the structure known as \"Solomon's Prison\" as \"the tower-like mausoleum\" while describing Pasargadae;<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Anabasis of Alexander|last=Arrian|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> and if the mentioned structure is presumed the mausoleum of one of the Achaemenid shahs, due to its similarity to the structure Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, and as Franz Heinrich Wei\u00dfbach and [[Alexander Demandt]] have explained, the structure should inevitably be considered belonging to another one of the Achaemenid shahs. Besides that, Ka'ba-ye Zartosht is a near to the mausoleums that were built at the same time; and all of them were later separated from the other parts of Naqsh-e Rustam by a chain of fortifications, indicating that they were all originally the same type and had similar applications. In other words, all of them, including they very Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, were mausoleums of Achaemenid grandees.<ref name=\":04\"/><ref name=\"Gropp\"/>\n\nSome other reasons can be stated for Ka'ba-ye Zartosht being a mausoleum; one is the triad and heptad units that are seen in the Achaemenid mausoleums. For example, the three-tomb chambers of the mausoleums connect them to making Ka'ba-ye Zartosht three-floor and its platform having three stairs;<ref name=\"Gropp\"/> and the seven hatches of each floor of the structure remarks the Seven Persian Noblemen on the mausoleums and the Tomb of Cyrus having seven floors.<ref name=\":04\"/>\n\nHowever the probations done do not confirm the idea and the writings carved on the walls of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht have no indication to the existence of a mausoleum or tomb either.<ref name=\"Gropp\"/>\n\n=== Treasury ===\nThe idea of the structure being a treasury was first stated by [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Rawlinson]] in 1871. Rawlinson's reasons were the accurate architecture and the proper size of the chamber, its sole door being heavy and solid and that it was difficult to reach inside the structure. [[Walter Bruno Henning|Walter Henning]] presented the theory with newer reasons. One of his reasons is about the [[Epigraphy|inscriptions]] carved on the rim of the chamber; there is a large inscription by [[Shapur I]] on the walls of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht; and below that inscription, there is a writing by [[Kartir]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=The History of Persian Literature Before Islam|last=Tafazzoli|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> that states in its second line: \"This \"bon khanak\" will be yours; do with it as you believe is better for the gods and us.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Kartir's Inscriptions|last=Yarshater|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Some historians conclude that it means the place was used for keeping religious bills, flags and documents.<ref name=\":3\" /> While describing landmarks in [[Istakhr]], Ibn-al Balkhi mentioned the site with the title \"Kuh-Nefesht\" or \"Kuh-Nebesht\" and said that the [[Avesta]] was kept there.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fars-Nameh|last=Ibn-al Balkhi|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Henning believed that Ibn-al Balkhi meant the very Ka'ba-ye Zartosht.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Most Important and Largest Writing from the Sassanian Empire Era|last=Sami|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> In order to disprove this view, it can be said that the chamber of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht is too small to keep the Avesta and other religious books and royal flags; a wider and larger site was necessary for such an intention. Also it can not be accepted that a place that far from the palaces would have been preferred to the large and various palaces of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] [[King of Kings|shahanshahs]] and official and governmental buildings for keeping the Avesta and royal flags. Since there is another tower like Ka'ba-ye Zartosht in [[Pasargadae]] titled \"Solomon's Prison\", it can not be accepted that the Achaemenid [[shah]]<nowiki/>s changed the site of the Avesta or the flags. By the way, if those who believe Ka'ba-ye Zartosht to be the place of the Avesta citing Ibn-al Balkhi's [[F\u0101rs-N\u0101ma|Fars-Nameh]], look at the writing of the same book a little prior to the word \"Kuh-Nefesht\", it is written: \"...afterwards, he accepted him; and he had brought the book of Zand for wisdom and had tanned twelve thousand pieces of cow skin and written on; he accepted it for gold and \"shatasef\"; and there is a mountain in [[Iran|Persian]] [[Istakhr]] called Kuh-Nefesht.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Thus, it is not possible that a book written on the skin of twelve thousand cows fit in the chamber of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht.<ref name=\":42\"/>\n\n=== Side view ===\nIn the recent years, [[Reza Moradi Ghiasabadi]] has presented a new interpretation of the structure by doing [[field research]] and considers it an [[observatory]] and a [[solar calendar]] and believes that the blind windows, the stairs opposite the entrance door and the construct have been a [[timer]] or a solar index for measuring the rotation of the sun and subsequently keeping the record of the year and counting the years and extracting calendars and detecting the first days of each solar month and summer and winter [[solstice]]s and spring and fall [[equinox]]es. He concludes that the beginning of each solar month could be detected by observing the shadows formed on the blind windows.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Calendarial and Astronomic Structures|last=Ghiasabadi|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nHowever, this theory can not be completely true; and one of the reasons that can be stated to refute the theory is that the direction of the [[North Pole|geographic North]] of each region could be different from the direction of the [[North Magnetic Pole|magnetic North]]. The [[orbital inclination]] of the magnetic North from the geographic North is about 2.5 degrees in the [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] compound; and the magnetic orbital inclination of the structure is 18 degrees to the [[West]] relative to the magnetic North based on [[Erich Schmidt (archaeologist)|Schmidt]]'s calculations. Therefore, the inclination of the structure relative to the geographic North will be about 15.5 degrees; meanwhile Ghiasabadi has considered the 18 degrees as the inclination of the structure from the geographic North.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Criticism of Moradi Ghiasabadi's Theory about the Astronomic Application of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht|last=Riazi|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Inscriptions by Shapur I and Kartir==\n{{Main|Shapur I's inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht}}\n[[File:Shapur_Kabe_Zartosht.png|thumb|The [[Parthian Empire|Arsacid]] [[Middle Persian]] version of [[Shapur I]]'s [[Epigraphy|Inscription]]]]\nOn June 1, 1936, following the probations by the digging department of The [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute]], some [[Epigraphy|inscriptions]] were found on the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht structure that belonged to [[Shapur I]] and the priest [[Kartir]];<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite web|url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/museum/collections/pa/persepolis/kabah.html|title=University of Chicago Oriental Institute|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67a7Y5Bdf?url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/museum/collections/pa/persepolis/kabah.html|archivedate=2012-05-11|df=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The History of the Sassanian Persian Civilization|last=Nafisi|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Shapur's Inscription is written in the three languages [[Greek language|Greek]] (70 lines), [[Parthian Empire|Arsacid]] [[Middle Persian]] (30 lines) and [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian]] Middle Persian (35 lines) on three sides of the structure; and Kartir's Inscription, which is in 19 lines in Sassanian Middle Persian language, is below Shapur's.<ref name=\":04\"/>\n\nIn Shapur's Inscription, which should be considered the \"Revolution Resolution\" of the Sassanian dynasty,<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite book|title=The Parthian Dusk and the Sassanian Dawn|last=Bayani|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> he first introduces himself and mentions the regions he ruled and then describes the [[Roman\u2013Persian Wars|Persian-Roman Wars]] and indicates the defeat and death of [[Gordian I|Marcus Antonius Gordianus]], after whom the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] forces proclaimed [[Philip the Arab|Marcus Julius Philippus]] the emperor; and the latter paid Shapur a compensation equal to half a million [[gold dinar]]s for [[Pardon|reprieve]] and returned to his homeland.

The Naqsh-e Rustam compound incorporates memorials of the [[Elam]]ites, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] and the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanians]] in itself in addition to the mentioned structure.\n\nThe Ka'ba-ye Zartosht is {{convert|46|m}} from the mountain, situated exactly opposite [[Darius II]]'s mausoleum. It is rectangular and has only one entrance door. The material of the structure is white [[limestone]]. It is about {{convert|12|m}} high, or {{convert|14.12|m}} if including the triple stairs, and each side of its base is about {{convert|7.30|m}} long. Its entrance door leads to the chamber inside via a thirty-stair stone stairway.

The structure was built in the Achaemenid era and there is no information of the name of the structure in that era. It was called ''Bon-Khanak'' in the Sassanian era; the local name of the structure was ''Kornaykhaneh'' or ''Naggarekhaneh''; and the phrase ''Ka'ba-ye Zartosht'' has been used for the structure since the [[14th century|fourteenth century]], into the [[Contemporary history|contemporary era]].\n\nVarious views and interpretations have been proposed about the application of the chamber, but none of them could be accepted with certainty: some consider the tower a [[fire temple]] and a fireplace, and believe that it was used for igniting and worshiping the holy fire, while another group rejects this view and considers it the mausoleum of one of the Achaemenid [[shah]]s or grandees, due to its similarity to the [[Tomb of Cyrus]] and some mausoleums of [[Lycia]] and [[Caria]]. Some other [[Iranian studies|Iranian scholars]] believe the stone chamber to be a structure for the safekeeping of royal documents and holy or religious books; however, the chamber of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht is too small for this purpose. Other less noticed theories, such as its being a temple for the goddess [[Anahita]] or a [[solar calendar]], have also been mentioned.\n\nThree [[Epigraphy|inscriptions]] have been written in the three languages [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian]] [[Middle Persian]], [[Parthian Empire|Arsacid]] Middle Persian and [[Greek language|Greek]] on the Northern, Southern and Eastern walls of the tower, in the Sassanian era.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Middle Persian Inscriptions|last=Henning|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> One of them belongs to [[Shapur I]] the Sassanian, and the other to the priest [[Kartir]].

The black stones were probably brought from Mount Mehr in [[Persepolis]], and installed on the walls in three rows:<ref name=\":04\"/>\n* High on the walls just below the ceiling, a small rectangular shelf in the northern side, and two similar shelves on each of the other sides\n* {{convert|3|m|spell=In}} below the ceiling, two large square shelves on three sides and one small rectangular shelf on the northern side\n* {{convert|6|m|spell=In}} below the ceiling, two medium-sized rectangular shelves on three sides and one large rectangular on the northern side\n\n=== Stairway ===\n[[File:Kabe_Zartosht-Stairs.JPG|thumb|The stairway of the structure]]\n\nA thirty-stair stairway (each stair is {{convert|2|to|2.12|m}} long, {{convert|26|cm}} wide and {{convert|26|cm}} high) is placed in the middle of the northern wall, reaching the threshold of the entrance doorway. Thus, the intention was for the Ka'ba to look like a three-floor tower that has seven doors or hatches on each floor; but only one hatch has been made into a true door, while the others are left as holeless blind windows.<ref name=\":04\"/>\n\nThe structure stands on a three-tiered platform. The first tier is {{convert|27|cm}} above the ground, and the tower is {{convert|14.12|m|ftin}} high including the triple tiers or stairs of its platform. The base is square-shaped, with each side approximately {{convert|7.30|m}} long. The ceiling of the structure is smooth and flat on the inside, but its roof has a bilateral slope that begins from the line in the middle of the rooftop on the outside, creating the pyramid-like appearance previously mentioned. The doorway is {{convert|1.75|m}} high and {{convert|87|cm}} wide and has at one point had a very heavy two-panel door which is now missing: there are carved-out notches for the upper and lower heels of each door panel in the stone frame which are entirely obvious to modern observers.<ref name=\":42\"/> Some have assumed that the door would have been made of wood, but a stone door of the same kind exists in Solomon's Prison in [[Pasargadae]], very similar to the remains of the one found in Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, which indicates that both doors were made of stone.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Sasanian Civilization|last=Sami|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> The doorway leads to a single interior room. This space is quadrangular, has an area of {{convert|3.74|by|3.72|m}}, and is {{convert|5.5|m}} high, with the thickness of its walls being between {{convert|1.54|and|1.62|m}}.<ref name=\":04\"/>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Naqsh-eRostam_Chardin.jpg|thumb|A picture of [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] painted by [[Jean Chardin]] in 1723]]\nThe Ka'ba-ye Zartosht is undoubtedly from the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] era. Much of the available evidence shows that it was built in the early Achaemenid era; the most important evidence for this dating is as follows:<ref name=\":04\"/>\n* Using black stone on a white background is one of the features of [[Pasargadae|Pasargadian]] architecture.\n* The [[dovetail joint]]s are found mostly in the periods of [[Darius I]] and [[Xerxes I]], and the way the stones are aligned is similar to the primary structures of [[Persepolis]].\n* The doorway and door of the structure is similar to those of the Achaemenid [[shah]]s' mausoleums, all of which have used the design of Darius I's mausoleum.\n* The masonry, which lacks [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] or ordering, resembles the first parts of the platform of Persepolis that were constructed in Darius I's period. Especially, the [[Epigraphy|inscription]] on the lower part of the southern wall of Persepolis is almost the same size as the stones forming the ceiling of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht.\n[[File:Ka'ba-ye_Zartosht_35.jpg|thumb|Photograph of the excavations performed by the [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Oriental Institute]] of the [[University of Chicago]]]]\n[[Carsten Niebuhr]], who had visited the structure in 1765, writes: \"Opposite the mountain that has the mausoleums and [[petroglyph]]s of [[Rostam]]'s braveries, a small structure is built of white stone that is covered by only two pieces of large stones.\"<ref name=\":42\">{{Cite book|title=Kartir and His Inscription in Ka'ba-ye Zartosht|last=Rajabi|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> [[Jane Dieulafoy]], who visited [[Iran]] in 1881, also reports in her [[Travel literature|travel journal]]: \"...and then we saw a quadrilateral structure that was placed opposite the walls of the cliff.

Besides, the fact that they did or could close the only entrance door of a structure with a heavy and two-panel door, makes it clear that its content should be kept safe from robbery and pollution.</blockquote>\n\n=== Fireplace ===\n[[Engelbert Kaempfer]] first proposed the assumption of being a [[fire temple]] or fireplace; and following him, [[James Justinian Morier]] and [[Robert Ker Porter]] supported the view in the early [[19th century|nineteenth century]]. The southwestern corner of the chamber is blackened by smoke; and has caused the assumption that the holy fire was glowing in there.<ref name=\":04\"/>\n[[File:Autophradate_l.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Vadfradad I]] (Autophradates I). The picture behind the coin is a structure similar to Ka'ba-ye Zartosht.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Persian Coins: Since the Beginning until the Zand Era|last=Sarfaraz and Avarzamani|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>]]\nIn the following years, [[Ferdinand Justi]], [[Roman Ghirshman|Ghirshman]], [[Erich Schmidt (archaeologist)|Schmidt]] and some others supported the hypothesis of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht being a fireplace. One of the reasons of this group is that [[Darius I]] says in the [[Behistun Inscription]] (First column, 63): \"...I rebuilt the temples that [[Gaumata]] had destructed. I returned the pastures, flocks, slaves and houses that Gaumata had taken to the people...\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Commands of the Achaemenid Shahanshahs|last=Sharpp|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Thus, there were some \"temples\" in the periods of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus II]] and [[Cambyses II]] that Gaumata destructed and Darius rebuilt them the same way; and since \"Solomon's Prison\" in [[Pasargadae]] is belonging to the first [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] era and destructed, and its exact copy was built in [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] in Darius's period, it should be concluded that those two structures are the mentioned temples in the Behistun Inscription; and since any temple in [[Iran|Persia]] during Darius's period could not be anything other than the holy fire, those were all fireplaces;<ref name=\":04\"/> besides, Ka'ba-ye Zartosht has been conserved well even after the Achaemenid era and was not surrounded by soil and stones; and in the beginning of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] era, [[Shapur I]] composed the most important document of the Sasanian history on it and [[Kartir]] wrote a religious document on it. These show that the structure was religiously important. On the other hand, a structure is drawn on the coins of some [[Iran|Persian]] kings like those of Otophradates I that is a fireplace and the royal fire was kept above or inside it; and since the structure has a two-stair platform and its two doors are like Ka'ba-ye Zartosht and the center of the Persian kingdom was also in the city of [[Istakhr]], it is the very Ka'ba-ye Zartosht that is drawn on their coins; and on the ceiling of this structure are put three fireboxes and the Persian king is standing in a praying posture in front of it.<ref name=\":04\"/><ref>{{Cite book|title=The History of the Civilization of Sasanian Persia|last=Nafisi|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nHowever, these reasons can not be true, for \"Ayadana\" only means \"worshiping place\" and a worshiping place is not necessarily a temple; and on the other hand, if you want to say that the people worshiped in this place, it is not true, for the Ka'ba is so small that the compound within can not fit more that two persons.<ref name=\":3\" /> Furthermore, according to [[Herodotus]] (section \"On the Customs of the Persians\"), the Persians, even in his time, had no temples or statues of gods. [[Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin]] in ''[[Iranica]]'' identifies the ayadana as podiums.<ref>http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ayadana-place-of-cult</ref>\n\nAdditionally, in Achaemenid seals and on their mausoleums, it is seen that the fireboxes containing the royal fire were placed in the free space; and the royal fire was taken before the king in a portable firebox. A remarkable point that [[Ernst Herzfeld|Herzfeld]], Sami and [[Mary Boyce]] have made is that it seems improbable to have spent all that price and effort in order to keep the fire in a dark and holeless room that needed the door open for the fire to ignite.<ref name=\":04\"/> Because fire requires [[oxygen]] and the inside of the Ka'ba is built in a way that even an [[oil lamp]] can not glow more than a few hours when the door and the large stone entrance are sealed.<ref name=\":3\" /> The chamber does not have an exit way for smoke while its entrance door has always been sealed.<ref name=\"Gropp\"/><ref name=\":03\" />\n\nThe structure on the coins of Persian kings can not be Ka'ba-ye Zartosht; for the mentioned picture on the coins was not higher than {{convert|2|m}}, had a two-stair platform and no stairway is seen below its doorway; its entrance door is much larger relative to the structure than that of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht; its ceiling has no steepness, enough to be put three fireboxes on; there is no distance between its doorway and the ceiling; it has no crowns or [[Portal (architecture)|portals]]; and the dents showing the heads of its arrows are not more than six. These features generally contradict with those of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht.<ref name=\":04\"/>\n\n=== Mausoleum ===\n[[File:Kabe_Zartosht_Dieulafoy.gif|thumb|Ka'ba-ye Zartosht in the [[19th century|nineteenth century]], by [[Jane Dieulafoy]]]]\nMost of the researchers assume the tower as the mausoleum of one of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] [[shah]]s. Since it is very similar to the [[Tomb of Cyrus]] and some of the mausoleums of [[Lycia]] and [[Caria]] in shape, solidness of architecture and having a small room with a very heavy door, it is considered a mausoleum. Welfram Klyse and [[David Stronach]] believe that the Achaemenid structures in [[Pasargadae]] and [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] might have been influenced by [[Urartu|Urartian]] art in the tower-like temples of Urartu.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Iran|last=Fisher|first=W.B.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia|Aristobulus]], one of the retainers of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander III of Macedon]], mentions the structure known as \"Solomon's Prison\" as \"the tower-like mausoleum\" while describing Pasargadae;<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Anabasis of Alexander|last=Arrian|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> and if the mentioned structure is presumed the mausoleum of one of the Achaemenid shahs, due to its similarity to the structure Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, and as Franz Heinrich Wei\u00dfbach and [[Alexander Demandt]] have explained, the structure should inevitably be considered belonging to another one of the Achaemenid shahs. Besides that, Ka'ba-ye Zartosht is a near to the mausoleums that were built at the same time; and all of them were later separated from the other parts of Naqsh-e Rustam by a chain of fortifications, indicating that they were all originally the same type and had similar applications. In other words, all of them, including they very Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, were mausoleums of Achaemenid grandees.<ref name=\":04\"/><ref name=\"Gropp\"/>\n\nSome other reasons can be stated for Ka'ba-ye Zartosht being a mausoleum; one is the triad and heptad units that are seen in the Achaemenid mausoleums. For example, the three-tomb chambers of the mausoleums connect them to making Ka'ba-ye Zartosht three-floor and its platform having three stairs;<ref name=\"Gropp\"/> and the seven hatches of each floor of the structure remarks the Seven Persian Noblemen on the mausoleums and the Tomb of Cyrus having seven floors.<ref name=\":04\"/>\n\nHowever the probations done do not confirm the idea and the writings carved on the walls of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht have no indication to the existence of a mausoleum or tomb either.<ref name=\"Gropp\"/>\n\n=== Treasury ===\nThe idea of the structure being a treasury was first stated by [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Rawlinson]] in 1871. Rawlinson's reasons were the accurate architecture and the proper size of the chamber, its sole door being heavy and solid and that it was difficult to reach inside the structure. [[Walter Bruno Henning|Walter Henning]] presented the theory with newer reasons. One of his reasons is about the [[Epigraphy|inscriptions]] carved on the rim of the chamber; there is a large inscription by [[Shapur I]] on the walls of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht; and below that inscription, there is a writing by [[Kartir]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=The History of Persian Literature Before Islam|last=Tafazzoli|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> that states in its second line: \"This \"bon khanak\" will be yours; do with it as you believe is better for the gods and us.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Kartir's Inscriptions|last=Yarshater|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Some historians conclude that it means the place was used for keeping religious bills, flags and documents.<ref name=\":3\" /> While describing landmarks in [[Istakhr]], Ibn-al Balkhi mentioned the site with the title \"Kuh-Nefesht\" or \"Kuh-Nebesht\" and said that the [[Avesta]] was kept there.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fars-Nameh|last=Ibn-al Balkhi|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Henning believed that Ibn-al Balkhi meant the very Ka'ba-ye Zartosht.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Most Important and Largest Writing from the Sassanian Empire Era|last=Sami|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> In order to disprove this view, it can be said that the chamber of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht is too small to keep the Avesta and other religious books and royal flags; a wider and larger site was necessary for such an intention. Also it can not be accepted that a place that far from the palaces would have been preferred to the large and various palaces of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] [[King of Kings|shahanshahs]] and official and governmental buildings for keeping the Avesta and royal flags. Since there is another tower like Ka'ba-ye Zartosht in [[Pasargadae]] titled \"Solomon's Prison\", it can not be accepted that the Achaemenid [[shah]]<nowiki/>s changed the site of the Avesta or the flags. By the way, if those who believe Ka'ba-ye Zartosht to be the place of the Avesta citing Ibn-al Balkhi's [[F\u0101rs-N\u0101ma|Fars-Nameh]], look at the writing of the same book a little prior to the word \"Kuh-Nefesht\", it is written: \"...afterwards, he accepted him; and he had brought the book of Zand for wisdom and had tanned twelve thousand pieces of cow skin and written on; he accepted it for gold and \"shatasef\"; and there is a mountain in [[Iran|Persian]] [[Istakhr]] called Kuh-Nefesht.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Thus, it is not possible that a book written on the skin of twelve thousand cows fit in the chamber of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht.<ref name=\":42\"/>\n\n=== Side view ===\nIn the recent years, [[Reza Moradi Ghiasabadi]] has presented a new interpretation of the structure by doing [[field research]] and considers it an [[observatory]] and a [[solar calendar]] and believes that the blind windows, the stairs opposite the entrance door and the construct have been a [[timer]] or a solar index for measuring the rotation of the sun and subsequently keeping the record of the year and counting the years and extracting calendars and detecting the first days of each solar month and summer and winter [[solstice]]s and spring and fall [[equinox]]es. He concludes that the beginning of each solar month could be detected by observing the shadows formed on the blind windows.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Calendarial and Astronomic Structures|last=Ghiasabadi|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nHowever, this theory can not be completely true; and one of the reasons that can be stated to refute the theory is that the direction of the [[North Pole|geographic North]] of each region could be different from the direction of the [[North Magnetic Pole|magnetic North]]. The [[orbital inclination]] of the magnetic North from the geographic North is about 2.5 degrees in the [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] compound; and the magnetic orbital inclination of the structure is 18 degrees to the [[West]] relative to the magnetic North based on [[Erich Schmidt (archaeologist)|Schmidt]]'s calculations. Therefor, the inclination of the structure relative to the geographic North will be about 15.5 degrees; meanwhile Ghiasabadi has considered the 18 degrees as the inclination of the structure from the geographic North.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Criticism of Moradi Ghiasabadi's Theory about the Astronomic Application of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht|last=Riazi|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Inscriptions by Shapur I and Kartir==\n{{Main article|Shapur I's inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht}}\n[[File:Shapur_Kabe_Zartosht.png|thumb|The [[Parthian Empire|Arsacid]] [[Middle Persian]] version of [[Shapur I]]'s [[Epigraphy|Inscription]]]]\nOn June 1, 1936, following the probations by the digging department of The [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute]], some [[Epigraphy|inscriptions]] were found on the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht structure that belonged to [[Shapur I]] and the priest [[Kartir]];<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite web|url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/museum/collections/pa/persepolis/kabah.html|title=University of Chicago Oriental Institute|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67a7Y5Bdf?url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/museum/collections/pa/persepolis/kabah.html|archivedate=2012-05-11|df=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The History of the Sassanian Persian Civilization|last=Nafisi|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Shapur's Inscription is written in the three languages [[Greek language|Greek]] (70 lines), [[Parthian Empire|Arsacid]] [[Middle Persian]] (30 lines) and [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian]] Middle Persian (35 lines) on three sides of the structure; and Kartir's Inscription, which is in 19 lines in Sassanian Middle Persian language, is below Shapur's.<ref name=\":04\"/>\n\nIn Shapur's Inscription, which should be considered the \"Revolution Resolution\" of the Sassanian dynasty,<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite book|title=The Parthian Dusk and the Sassanian Dawn|last=Bayani|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> he first introduces himself and mentions the regions he ruled and then describes the [[Roman\u2013Persian Wars|Persian-Roman Wars]] and indicates the defeat and death of [[Gordian I|Marcus Antonius Gordianus]], after whom the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] forces proclaimed [[Philip the Arab|Marcus Julius Philippus]] the emperor; and the latter paid Shapur a compensation equal to half a million [[gold dinar]]s for [[Pardon|reprieve]] and returned to his homeland.

Merrifield and Lorene n\u00e9e Lucas. In 1923 the family moved to [[California]] where he attended nine grade schools and two high schools before graduating from [[Montebello High School]] in 1939. It was there that he developed an interest both in [[chemistry]] and in [[astronomy]].\n\nAfter two years at [[Pasadena Junior College]] he transferred to the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (UCLA). After graduation in chemistry he worked for a year at the Philip R. Park Research Foundation taking care of an animal colony and assisting with growth experiments on synthetic [[amino acid]] diets. One of these was the experiment by Geiger that first demonstrated that the essential amino acids must be present simultaneously for growth to occur.\n\nHe returned to graduate school at the UCLA chemistry department with professor of biochemistry M.S. Dunn to develop microbiological methods for the quantitation of the [[pyrimidine]]s. The day after graduating on 19 June 1949, he married Elizabeth Furlong and the next day left for [[New York City]] and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research.\n\n==Career==\nAt the Institute, later [[Rockefeller University]], he worked as an Assistant for Dr. [[Dilworth Wayne Woolley|D.W. Woolley]] on a dinucleotide growth factor he discovered in graduate school and on peptide growth factors that Woolley had discovered earlier. These studies led to the need for [[peptide synthesis]] and, eventually, to the idea for solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) in 1959. In 1963, he was sole author of a classic paper in the ''[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]'' in which he reported a method he called \"solid phase peptide synthesis\".<ref>{{Citation| title= Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis.
