The first race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in odd\u2013numbered positions on pole qualifying day. The second race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in even\u2013numbered positions. Positions 33\u201336 are filled by the four drivers that posted the fastest lap in pole qualifying that didn't lock in a position in the Duel's. Positions 37\u201340 are set by the four cars highest in the 2018 owner's points that didn't lock in a position in the Duels and weren't among the cars that posted the four fastest timed laps in pole qualifying.\n\nFor championship purposes, each Duel is a full Championship Stage, except there is no playoff point awarded.

They consist of two races 60 laps and 150 miles (240&nbsp;km) in length, which serve as heat races that set the lineup for the Daytona 500. Both races sets the lineup for positions 3\u201332. The first race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in odd\u2013numbered positions on pole qualifying day. The second race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in even\u2013numbered positions. Positions 33\u201336 are filled by the four drivers that posted the fastest lap in pole qualifying that didn't lock in a position in the Duel's. Positions 37\u201340 are set by the four cars highest in the 2018 owner's points that didn't lock in a position in the Duels and weren't among the cars that posted the four fastest timed laps in pole qualifying.\n\nFor championship purposes, each Duel is a full Championship Stage, except there is no playoff point awarded. The top ten drivers receive championship points. \n\n===Duel 1===\n\n====Duel 1 results====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:98%\n|-\n! Pos\n! Grid\n! {{Tooltip|No|Car Number}}\n! Driver\n!

The company also owns [[All-Nippon News Network]].\n\n==Headquarters==\n[[File:Tv asahi.jpg|thumb|Sign of TV asahi in headquarters since 2003]]\nIn 2003, the company headquarters moved to a new building designed by [[Fumihiko Maki]] at: 6-9-1 [[Roppongi]], [[Minato, Tokyo]], Japan.\n\nSome of TV Asahi's departments and subsidiaries, such as TV Asahi Productions and Take Systems, are still located at ''TV Asahi Center'', the company's former headquarters of 1986\u20132003. It is located at [[Ark Hills]], not far from its headquarters.\n[[File:View of TV Asahi.jpg|thumb|View of TV Asahi headquarters since 2003]]\n\n==History==\n[[Image:TVAsahi.jpg|thumb|TV Asahi's annexe at Ark Hills, not far from its headquarters since 2003]]\n\nTV Asahi began as {{nihongo|\"Nihon Educational Television Co., Ltd.\" (NET)|\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u65e5\u672c\u6559\u80b2\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3|Kabushiki-gaisha Nihon Ky\u014diku Terebi|extra=\"The Japanese Educational Television Company\"}} on November 1, 1957. It was established as a for-profit educational television channel. At the time, its broadcasting license dictates that the network is required to devote at least 50% of its airtime to educational programming, and at least 30% of its airtime to children's educational programming. The station was owned by [[Asahi Shimbun]], [[Toei Company]], [[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]], and Obunsha.\n\nHowever, the for-profit educational television model eventually proved to be a failure. In 1960, NET began its transformation into a general-purpose television station. It began to broadcast [[anime]] and foreign movies. So as not to run afoul of the educational TV license requirements, NET justified the airing of these programs under the pretext of {{nihongo|\"nurturing a child's emotional range\"|\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u60c5\u64cd\u6559\u80b2\u306e\u305f\u3081|Kodomo no j\u014ds\u014d ky\u014diku no tame}} and {{nihongo|\"introduction of foreign cultures\"|\u5916\u56fd\u6587\u5316\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb|Gaikoku bunka no sh\u014dkai}}. At the same time, NET also changed its common name from \"Nihon Educational Television\" to \"NET TV\" (NET\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3).\n\nSeven years later, in 1967, NET aired its first colour broadcast programme. Part of its transformation into a general TV channel would be the April 1971 premiere of the [[Kamen Rider Series]] by the Toei Company and creator [[Shotaro Ishinomori]], the [[tokusatsu]] [[superhero]] series that would make the channel a national hit. It has been its home ever since, joined by yet another toku series, ''[[Super Sentai]]'', in the spring of 1975 (KR left the channel in 1975, only to return in 2000). Aside from these two live action programs, which would become part of its flagship programming, due in part by the work done by Toei's animation branch, the 70s were also marked on NET with great animation classics of national fame, which aired one after the other in the channel and were even exported to other countries, many of these would be part of daily life and culture and helped introduce the world to the [[anime]] genre. Such animations put the channel in direct competition with other stations which broadcast similar programming.\n\nNET's transformation into a general-purpose television station was complete by November 1973, when NET, along with educational channel \"Tokyo Channel 12\" (now [[TV Tokyo]]) in [[Tokyo]] applied and received a general purpose television station license. At the same time, NET renamed itself as NET General Television (\u7dcf\u5408\u5c40NET), which subsequently became the {{Nihongo|\"Asahi National Broadcasting Company, Limited\"|\u5168\u56fd\u671d\u65e5\u653e\u9001\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|Zenkoku Asahi H\u014ds\u014d Kabushiki-gaisha|extra=commonly named \"TV Asahi\"}} on April 1, 1977. Five years later, TV Asahi became the official network, until 1999, for yet another Toei live action franchise, the [[Metal Hero Series]].\n\nIn 1996, TV Asahi established the {{Nihongo|'''All-Nippon News Network (ANN)'''|\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30cb\u30c3\u30dd\u30f3\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af|\u014cru Nippon Ny\u016bsu Nettow\u0101ku}}, and began a number of reforms, including the unification of all presentation styles on its regional networks and the creation of a new logo to give Asahi the look and feel of a national television network. On October 1, 2003, TV Asahi moved its head office from its Ark Hills Studio to [[Roppongi Hills]], and the station was renamed \"TV Asahi Corporation\", with the name presented as \"tv asahi\" on-screen.\n\nThe transmission of international aquatics competitions, World Cup football matches, and creation of popular late-night TV programs contributed to a rise in ratings for TV Asahi, and lifted the TV station from its popularly ridiculed \"perpetual fourth place\" finish into second place, right behind [[fuji Television|Fuji TV]], by 2005.\n\nThe station also launched its own [[mascot]], {{Nihongo|''G\u014d EX Panda''|\u30b4\u30fc\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30d1\u30f3\u30c0|G\u014d Ekkusu Panda}}, also known as {{Nihongo|''G\u014d-chan''|\u30b4\u30fc\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3002}} G\u014d-chan is currently seen on TV Asahi's opening sign-on ID.\n\n==Branding==\nTV Asahi's current branding were created by UK design collective [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]] (some members work as the electronic music group [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]]) along with TV Asahi's in-house design department in 2003. It comprises a set of computer-generated \"sticks\" in white background, which changes in colour and movement along with the background music that accompanies the idents. TV Asahi also uses a brief [[eyecatch]] of its sticks animation at the top-left of the screen after commercial breaks. The background music used for TV Asahi's sign-on and sign-off videos are Underworld's ''[[Born Slippy .NUXX#Born Slippy .NUXX 2003|Born Slippy .NUXX 2003]]'' and ''Rez''. TV Asahi later updated its sign-on and sign-off video in 2008 with a revised version of computer-generated \"sticks\" animation and new background music. TV Asahi's slogan ''New Air, On Air'' appears at the top of its name. It can be seen on TV Asahi's YouTube channel, which in 2011-12, was replaced by its mascot, Go-Chan.\n\nThe company writes its name in lower-case letters, ''tv asahi'', in its logo and public-image materials. Normally, the station branding on-screen appears as either \"/tv asahi\" or \"tv asahi\\\". The station's watermark appearance is the stick at the top with the station's name at the bottom. The fonts used by TV Asahi for the written parts are [[Akzidenz Grotesk|Akzidenz Grotesk Bold]] (English) and [[Hiragino|Hiragino Kaku Gothic W8]] (Japanese).<ref>http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/vi/flash_content/index.html http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/vi/flash_content/index.html</ref>\n\n==TV broadcasting==\nSince 2004, the funding of this station is through [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]].\n{{Infobox broadcast\n| call_letters             = JOEX-TV<br>JOEX-DTV\n| station_logo             = TV Asahi Logo.svg\n| station_slogan           = ''New Air, On Air.''<br>(2008-present)\n| station_branding         = tv asahi<br />\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5<br />''EX''\n| digital                  = JOEX-DTV, Channel 24 ([[UHF]] \u2013 [[Virtual channel|LCN]] 5)\n| other_chs                = '''[[Hachi\u014dji, Tokyo]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 45<br />\n'''[[Tama, Tokyo]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 57<br />\n'''[[Chichi-jima|Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Islands]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 59<br />\n'''[[Mito, Ibaraki]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 36<br />Digital: Channel 17<br />\n'''[[Hitachi, Ibaraki]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />\n'''[[Utsunomiya, Tochigi]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 41<br />Digital: Channel 17<br />\n'''[[Maebashi, Gunma]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />Digital: Channel 43<br />\n'''[[Chichibu, Saitama]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 38<br />\n'''[[Narita, Chiba]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 59<br />\n'''[[Tateyama, Chiba]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />\n'''[[Minato Mirai 21|Yokohama Minato Mirai 21, Kanagawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />\n'''[[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka-Kurihama, Kanagawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 35<br />\n'''[[Hiratsuka, Kanagawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 41<br />Digital: Channel 24<br />\n'''[[Kitadait\u014d, Okinawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 48<br />\n'''[[Minami Daito, Okinawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60\n| affiliations             = [[All-Nippon News Network]]\n| founded                  = {{start date and age|1957}}\n| airdate                  = November 1, 1957\n| location                 = [[Kant\u014d region|Kant\u014d Region, Japan]]\n| callsign_meaning         = JOEX = '''J'''apan's'''O'''riginal Free-to-Air '''E'''ducational TV Station<br>'''X''' (10, former channel assignment)\n| sister_stations          = '''BS Asahi'''<br>'''Tele Asa Channel 1'''<br>'''Tele Asa Channel 2'''<br>'''Zee Asahi''' \n| former_callsigns         = \n| owner                    = TV Asahi Corporation\n| former_channel_numbers   = ch.# 10 ([[analog television|analog]], 1957-2011), ch. #5 ([[digital television|digital]])\n| former_affiliations      = \n| effective_radiated_power = 10 kW (68 kW [[Effective radiated power|ERP]])\n| HAAT                     = \n| class                    = \n| facility_id              = \n| coordinates              = {{Coord|35|39|31|N|139|44|44|E|type:landmark_scale:2000}}\n| homepage                 = http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/\n}}\n\n===Analog===\n\n(until July 24, 2011 only for 44 out of 47 prefectures)\n\n'''JOEX-TV''' \u2013 TV Asahi Analog Television (\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3)\n* [[Tokyo Tower]] \u2013 VHF Channel 10\n;

The company also owns [[All-Nippon News Network]].\n\n==Headquarters==\n[[File:Tv asahi.jpg|thumb|Sign of TV asahi in headquarters since 2003]]\nIn 2003, the company headquarters moved to a new building designed by [[Fumihiko Maki]] at: 6-9-1 [[Roppongi]], [[Minato, Tokyo]], Japan.\n\nSome of TV Asahi's departments and subsidiaries, such as TV Asahi Productions and Take Systems, are still located at ''TV Asahi Center'', the company's former headquarters of 1986\u20132003. It is located at [[Ark Hills]], not far from its headquarters.\n[[File:View of TV Asahi.jpg|thumb|View of TV Asahi headquarters since 2003]]\n\n==History==\n[[Image:TVAsahi.jpg|thumb|TV Asahi's annexe at Ark Hills, not far from its headquarters since 2003]]\n\nTV Asahi began as {{nihongo|\"Nihon Educational Television Co., Ltd.\" (NET)|\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u65e5\u672c\u6559\u80b2\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3|Kabushiki-gaisha Nihon Ky\u014diku Terebi|extra=\"The Japanese Educational Television Company\"}} on November 1, 1957. It was established as a for-profit educational television channel. At the time, its broadcasting license dictates that the network is required to devote at least 50% of its airtime to educational programming, and at least 30% of its airtime to children's educational programming. The station was owned by [[Asahi Shimbun]], [[Toei Company]], [[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]], and Obunsha.\n\nHowever, the for-profit educational television model eventually proved to be a failure. In 1960, NET began its transformation into a general-purpose television station. It began to broadcast [[anime]] and foreign movies. So as not to run afoul of the educational TV license requirements, NET justified the airing of these programs under the pretext of {{nihongo|\"nurturing a child's emotional range\"|\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u60c5\u64cd\u6559\u80b2\u306e\u305f\u3081|Kodomo no j\u014ds\u014d ky\u014diku no tame}} and {{nihongo|\"introduction of foreign cultures\"|\u5916\u56fd\u6587\u5316\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb|Gaikoku bunka no sh\u014dkai}}. At the same time, NET also changed its common name from \"Nihon Educational Television\" to \"NET TV\" (NET\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3).\n\nSeven years later, in 1967, NET aired its first colour broadcast programme. Part of its transformation into a general TV channel would be the April 1971 premiere of the [[Kamen Rider Series]] by the Toei Company and creator [[Shotaro Ishinomori]], the [[tokusatsu]] [[superhero]] series that would make the channel a national hit. It has been its home ever since, joined by yet another toku series, ''[[Super Sentai]]'', in the spring of 1975 (KR left the channel in 1975, only to return in 2000). Aside from these two live action programs, which would become part of its flagship programming, due in part by the work done by Toei's animation branch, the 70s were also marked on NET with great animation classics of national fame, which aired one after the other in the channel and were even exported to other countries, many of these would be part of daily life and culture and helped introduce the world to the [[anime]] genre. Such animations put the channel in direct competition with other stations which broadcast similar programming.\n\nNET's transformation into a general-purpose television station was complete by November 1973, when NET, along with educational channel \"Tokyo Channel 12\" (now [[TV Tokyo]]) in [[Tokyo]] applied and received a general purpose television station license. At the same time, NET renamed itself as NET General Television (\u7dcf\u5408\u5c40NET), which subsequently became the {{Nihongo|\"Asahi National Broadcasting Company, Limited\"|\u5168\u56fd\u671d\u65e5\u653e\u9001\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|Zenkoku Asahi H\u014ds\u014d Kabushiki-gaisha|extra=commonly named \"TV Asahi\"}} on April 1, 1977. Five years later, TV Asahi became the official network, until 1999, for yet another Toei live action franchise, the [[Metal Hero Series]].\n\nIn 1996, TV Asahi established the {{Nihongo|'''All-Nippon News Network (ANN)'''|\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30cb\u30c3\u30dd\u30f3\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af|\u014cru Nippon Ny\u016bsu Nettow\u0101ku}}, and began a number of reforms, including the unification of all presentation styles on its regional networks and the creation of a new logo to give Asahi the look and feel of a national television network. On October 1, 2003, TV Asahi moved its head office from its Ark Hills Studio to [[Roppongi Hills]], and the station was renamed \"TV Asahi Corporation\", with the name presented as \"tv asahi\" on-screen.\n\nThe transmission of international aquatics competitions, World Cup football matches, and creation of popular late-night TV programs contributed to a rise in ratings for TV Asahi, and lifted the TV station from its popularly ridiculed \"perpetual fourth place\" finish into second place, right behind [[fuji Television|Fuji TV]], by 2005.\n\nThe station also launched its own [[mascot]], {{Nihongo|''G\u014d EX Panda''|\u30b4\u30fc\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30d1\u30f3\u30c0|G\u014d Ekkusu Panda}}, also known as {{Nihongo|''G\u014d-chan''|\u30b4\u30fc\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3002}} G\u014d-chan is currently seen on TV Asahi's opening sign-on ID.\n\n==Branding==\nTV Asahi's current branding were created by UK design collective [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]] (some members work as the electronic music group [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]]) along with TV Asahi's in-house design department in 2003. It comprises a set of computer-generated \"sticks\" in white background, which changes in colour and movement along with the background music that accompanies the idents. TV Asahi also uses a brief [[eyecatch]] of its sticks animation at the top-left of the screen after commercial breaks. The background music used for TV Asahi's sign-on and sign-off videos are Underworld's ''[[Born Slippy .NUXX#Born Slippy .NUXX 2003|Born Slippy .NUXX 2003]]'' and ''Rez''. TV Asahi later updated its sign-on and sign-off video in 2008 with a revised version of computer-generated \"sticks\" animation and new background music. TV Asahi's slogan ''New Air, On Air'' appears at the top of its name. It can be seen on TV Asahi's YouTube channel, which in 2011-12, was replaced by its mascot, Go-Chan.\n\nThe company writes its name in lower-case letters, ''tv asahi'', in its logo and public-image materials. Normally, the station branding on-screen appears as either \"/tv asahi\" or \"tv asahi\\\". The station's watermark appearance is the stick at the top with the station's name at the bottom. The fonts used by TV Asahi for the written parts are [[Akzidenz Grotesk|Akzidenz Grotesk Bold]] (English) and [[Hiragino|Hiragino Kaku Gothic W8]] (Japanese).<ref>http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/vi/flash_content/index.html http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/vi/flash_content/index.html</ref>\n\n==TV broadcasting==\nSince 2004, the funding of this station is through [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]].\n{{Infobox broadcast\n| call_letters             = JOEX-TV<br>JOEX-DTV\n| station_logo             = TV Asahi Logo.svg\n| station_slogan           = ''New Air, On Air.''<br>(2008-present)\n| station_branding         = tv asahi<br />\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5<br />''EX''\n| digital                  = JOEX-DTV, Channel 24 ([[UHF]] \u2013 [[Virtual channel|LCN]] 5)\n| other_chs                = '''[[Hachi\u014dji, Tokyo]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 45<br />\n'''[[Tama, Tokyo]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 57<br />\n'''[[Chichi-jima|Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Islands]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 59<br />\n'''[[Mito, Ibaraki]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 36<br />Digital: Channel 17<br />\n'''[[Hitachi, Ibaraki]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />\n'''[[Utsunomiya, Tochigi]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 41<br />Digital: Channel 17<br />\n'''[[Maebashi, Gunma]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />Digital: Channel 43<br />\n'''[[Chichibu, Saitama]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 38<br />\n'''[[Narita, Chiba]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 59<br />\n'''[[Tateyama, Chiba]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />\n'''[[Minato Mirai 21|Yokohama Minato Mirai 21, Kanagawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />\n'''[[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka-Kurihama, Kanagawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 35<br />\n'''[[Hiratsuka, Kanagawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 41<br />Digital: Channel 24<br />\n'''[[Kitadait\u014d, Okinawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 48<br />\n'''[[Minami Daito, Okinawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60\n| affiliations             = [[All-Nippon News Network]]\n| founded                  = {{start date and age|1957}}\n| airdate                  = November 1, 1957\n| location                 = [[Kant\u014d region|Kant\u014d Region, Japan]]\n| callsign_meaning         = JOEX = '''J'''apan's'''O'''riginal Free-to-Air '''E'''ducational TV Station<br>'''X''' (10, former channel assignment)\n| sister_stations          = '''BS Asahi'''<br>'''Tele Asa Channel 1'''<br>'''Tele Asa Channel 2'''<br>'''Zee Asahi''' \n| former_callsigns         = \n| owner                    = TV Asahi Corporation\n| former_channel_numbers   = ch.# 10 ([[analog television|analog]], 1957-2011), ch. #5 ([[digital television|digital]])\n| former_affiliations      = \n| effective_radiated_power = 10 kW (68 kW [[Effective radiated power|ERP]])\n| HAAT                     = \n| class                    = \n| facility_id              = \n| coordinates              = {{Coord|35|39|31|N|139|44|44|E|type:landmark_scale:2000}}\n| homepage                 = http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/\n}}\n\n===Analog===\n\n(until July 24, 2011 only for 44 out of 47 prefectures)\n\n'''JOEX-TV''' \u2013 TV Asahi Analog Television (\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3)\n* [[Tokyo Tower]] \u2013 VHF Channel 10\n;

name=FWHA/> Many residents in the predominantly rural and agricultural areas where the route was to pass were initially opposed.<ref name=FWHA/> Plans were later abandoned and the General Assembly ordered TDOT to discontinue further studies and planning of that highway because of state budget problems. An entire circular loop would possibly be about {{convert|178|mi|km}} long, ranging from {{convert|86|to|116|mi|km}}. Other important objections against additional extensions of the I-840 highway include the hilly nature of the terrain north of Nashville (the [[Highland Rim]]), which would require huge and costly amounts of excavation, soil relocation, and bridge construction. In October 2003, TDOT placed the northern loop plan on indefinite hold, citing a lack of documented transportation needs and lack of participation from local politicians.<ref name=\"840hold\">{{cite press release |author = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]] |date = October 31, 2003 |url = http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/news/2003/ut_projects/10-31-2003sr840n.pdf |title = TDOT Announces Decision on State Route 840 North |publisher = Tennessee Department of Transportation |format = PDF |access-date = July 17, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071127233215/http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/news/2003/ut_projects/10-31-2003sr840n.pdf |archive-date = November 27, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Redesignation===\n[[File:Interstate 840.jpg|thumb|right|Same section of I-40 in 2017, showing signage for I-840.]]\nIn 2015, TDOT submitted a request to [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|AASHTO]] to redesignate SR&nbsp;840 as I-840.

The common usage in both everyday [[speech]] and academic [[discourse]] is a practitioner in the [[visual art]]s only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a [[business]] context, for [[musician]]s and other performers (less often for actors). \"Artiste\" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context; this use has become rare. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.\n\n==Dictionary definitions==\nThe ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the older broad meanings of the term \"artist\":\n\n* A learned person or Master of Arts\n* One who pursues a practical science, traditionally medicine, [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], [[chemistry]]\n* A follower of a pursuit in which skill comes by study or practice\n* A follower of a manual art, such as a mechanic\n* One who makes their [[craft]] a fine art\n* One who cultivates one of the [[fine arts]] \u2013 traditionally the arts presided over by the [[muses]]\n\n==History of the term==\nThe Greek word \"techn\u011b\", often translated as \"art,\" implies mastery of any sort of craft. The adjectival Latin form of the word, \"technicus\",<ref>\n[[Oxford English Dictionary]] s.v. ''technic''\n</ref>\nbecame the source of the English words [[wikt:technique|technique]], technology, [[wikt:technical|technical]].\n\nIn Greek culture each of the nine [[Muse]]s oversaw a different field of human creation:\n* [[Calliope]] (the 'beautiful of speech'): chief of the muses and muse of [[epic poetry|epic or heroic poetry]]\n* [[Clio]] (the 'glorious one'): muse of history\n* [[Erato]] (the 'amorous one'): muse of [[love poetry|love or erotic poetry]], lyrics, and marriage songs\n* [[Euterpe]] (the 'well-pleasing'): muse of music and [[lyric poetry]]\n* [[Melpomene]] (the 'chanting one'): muse of [[tragedy]]\n* [[Polyhymnia]] or Polymnia (the '[singer] of many [[hymn]]s'): muse of [[sacred|sacred song]], [[Public speaking|oratory]], [[Lyrics|lyric]], singing, and [[rhetoric]]\n* [[Terpsichore]] (the '[one who] delights in dance'): muse of [[choral]] song and dance\n* [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]] (the 'blossoming one'): muse of comedy and [[bucolic poetry]]\n* [[Urania]] (the 'celestial one'): muse of [[astronomy]]\n\nNo muse was identified with the visual arts of painting and sculpture. In ancient Greece sculptors and painters were held in low regard, somewhere between freemen and slaves, their work regarded as mere manual labour.<ref>\n''In Our Time: The Artist'' [[BBC Radio 4]], TX 28 March 2002</ref>\n\nThe word ''art'' derives from the Latin \"ars\" (stem ''art-''), which, although literally defined means \"skill method\" or \"technique\", also conveys a connotation of beauty.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages the word ''artist'' already existed in some countries such as Italy, but the meaning was something resembling ''craftsman'', while the word ''artesan'' was still unknown. An artist was someone able to do a work better than others, so the skilled excellency was underlined, rather than the activity field. In this period some \"artisanal\" products (such as textiles) were much more precious and expensive than paintings or sculptures.\n\nThe first division into major and minor arts dates back at least to the works of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404\u20131472): ''[[De re aedificatoria]], [[De statua]], [[De pictura]]'', which focused on the importance of the intellectual skills of the artist rather than the manual skills (even if in other forms of art there was a [[project]] behind).<ref>\nP.Galloni, ''Il sacro artefice. Mitologie degli artigiani medievali'', Laterza, [[Bari]], 1998</ref>\n\nWith the [[Academy|Academies]] in Europe (second half of 16th century) the gap between fine and applied arts was definitely set.\n\nMany contemporary definitions of \"artist\" and \"art\" are highly contingent on culture, resisting aesthetic prescription, in much the same way that the features constituting beauty and the beautiful cannot be standardized easily without corruption into [[kitsch]].\n\n==The present day concept of an 'artist'==\n''Artist'' is a descriptive term applied to a person who engages in an activity deemed to be an art. An artist also may be defined unofficially as \"a person who expresses him- or herself through a medium\". The word is also used in a qualitative sense of, a person [[creativity|creative]] in, [[innovation|innovative]] in, or adept at, an artistic practice.\n\nMost often, the term describes those who create within a context of the fine arts or '[[high culture]]', activities such as drawing, painting, [[sculpture]], acting, dancing, writing, filmmaking, [[New media art|new media]], photography, and music\u2014people who use imagination, talent, or skill to create works that may be judged to have an [[aesthetic]] value. [[Art history|Art historians]] and [[Art critic|critics]] define artists as those who produce art within a recognized or recognizable discipline. Contrasting terms for highly skilled workers in media in the [[applied arts]] or [[decorative arts]] include [[artisan]], [[Master craftsman|craftsman]], and specialized terms such as [[pottery|potter]], [[goldsmith]] or [[glassblower]]. Fine arts artists such as painters succeeded in the [[Renaissance]] in raising their status, formerly similar to these workers, to a decisively higher level.\n\nThe term may also be used loosely or metaphorically to denote highly skilled people in any non-\"art\" activities, as well\u2014 law, medicine, mechanics, or mathematics, for example.\n\nOften, discussions on the subject focus on the differences among \"artist\" and \"[[technician]]\", \"entertainer\" and \"[[artisan]]\", \"[[fine arts|fine art]]\" and \"[[applied art]]\", or what constitutes art and what does not. The French word ''artiste'' (which in French, simply means \"artist\") has been imported into the English language where it means a performer (frequently in [[Music Hall]] or [[Vaudeville]]). Use of the word \"artiste\" can also be a [[pejorative]] term.<ref>Kenneth G. Wilson. [https://archive.org/details/columbiaguidetos00wils_0/page/40 <!-- quote=artist  uncomplimentary \"artiste\". --> The Columbia guide to standard American English].</ref>\n\nThe English word 'artiste' has thus a narrower range of meaning than the word 'artiste' in French.\n\nIn ''Living with Art'', Mark Getlein proposes six activities, services or functions of contemporary artists:<ref>{{cite book |last=Getlein |first=Mark |date=2012 |title=Living with Art |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |isbn=978-0-07-337925-8 |pages=}}</ref>\n#Create places for some human purpose.\n#Create extraordinary versions of ordinary objects.\n#Record and commemorate.\n#Give tangible form to the unknown.\n#Give tangible form to feelings.\n#Refresh our vision and help see the world in new ways.\n\nAfter looking at years of data on arts school graduates as well as policies & program outcomes regarding artists, arts, & culture, Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper propose the divide between \"arts for art's sake\" artists and commercially successful artists is not as wide as may be perceived, and that \"this bifurcation between the commercial and the noncommercial, the excellent and the base, the elite and the popular, is increasingly breaking down\" (Eikhof & Haunschild, 2007).

name=\":0\" /> She then went on to enroll in the tri-institutional M.D., Ph.D. program of [[Weill Cornell Medicine|Weill Cornell]], [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller]] and [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center|Sloan Kettering]], finishing her Ph.D. thesis studies on the functions of the telomeric protein, [[TRAF2|TRF2]], in the lab of Dr. [[Titia de Lange]] at Rockefeller University in 2002, and her medical degree from [[Weill Cornell Medicine|Weill Cornell]] in 2003.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Smogorzewska then went on to a residency in clinical pathology at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] from 2003\u20132006, becoming a postdoctoral researcher at [[Harvard Medical School]] between 2005-2009 under Dr. [[Stephen Elledge]] where she discovered the Fanconi anemia protein [[FANCI]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Career and Research ==\nSmogorzewska became an assistant professor at [[Rockefeller University]] in 2009 and was subsequently elevated to associate professor in 2015.<ref name=\":0\" /> Her lab focuses on [[DNA repair]] mechanisms, particularly the interstrand crosslink repair pathway, which concerns the cellular mechanisms by which the two strands of DNA that have been covalently linked are excised, creating a double strand DNA break that is subsequently processed by factors in the Fanconi anemia and [[homologous recombination]] pathways.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> In particular, Smogorzewska is interested in identifying new genes that are involved in this repair process in order to reveal the mechanisms at play in human diseases that result from deficiencies in interstrand crosslink repair, including Fanconi anemia and karyomegalic interstitial nephritis.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> To this end, Smogorzewska has successfully identified [[SLX4]], [[RAD51]] and [[UBE2L3|UBE2T]] as interstrand crosslink repair factors, as well as developed a mouse model of karyomegalic interstitial nephritis.<ref name=\":0\" /> Recently, Smogorzewska has begun studies revolving around how [[replication stress]] is addressed by cells to promote genome stability.<ref
