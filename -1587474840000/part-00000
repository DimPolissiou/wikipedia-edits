In 1930, by then in her mid-60s, McGillivray bought a house in Toronto where she retired.<ref name=\":1\" /> She continued to paint primarily from the sketches she had accumulated from around the world. As a landscape painter, McGillivray found some prestige and recognition while alive, but not quite as much as Thomson though she had encouraged him in his modernist path. Painting landscapes in a modernist style was not something expected from a woman in the early 1900s. McGillivray never married and left no children.

One of the most famous groups that she was associated with was the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]]. Her art works expresses a view of landscape in bold colours that would be categorized later on as part of the Group of Seven landscape painting that captures the two visions of the land: the romantic-realist view of the railway artists of the 1880s and the heroic view of the landscape in the 1890s.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nShe joined the Womens Art Association of Canada where she studied painting on china with Mary E. Dignam, its founding president.<ref name=\":1\" /> McGillivray was welcomed into communities and numerous social affairs which included the Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and the Women Painters and Sculptors Art Club (Women Painters and Sculptors 1917) which were both centralized in New York City.<ref name=\"cwahi.concordia.ca\" /> She continued her study of painting on china  with Marshall Fry in New York in 1898 and sold her pieces later from her studio in Whitby <ref name=\":1\" />. She also gave painting classes in Whitby.<ref name=\":1\" /> She became an instructor and a critic at an all boys\u2019 school in Pickering College and an assistant art instructor at the Ontario's Ladies\u2019 College in the 1900s and later, the head of the art department.<ref name=\"images.ourontario.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://images.ourontario.ca/whitby/43070/data|title=Florence Helena McGillivray, 1906|website=images.ourontario.ca}}</ref> \n\nThe artist also helped encourage fellow Canadian artist [[Tom Thomson]], who was praised for his landscape paintings.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 1913 during her trip in Paris, her instructors  at the [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re|Academie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]] were Lucien Simon and Ren\u00e9 M\u00e9nard. But her real inspiration was the artist Frederic Fiebig<ref> Allen, pp. 74-75</ref> and due to him, she began to work in a style new to her that involved using the palette knife and a heavier application of paint. Her works of art in this mode were acknowledged and she was invited to display her paintings at the Salon des Beaux Arts.<ref name=\"cwahi.concordia.ca\" /> Not long later, it is said, the artist was voted as president of the International Union.<ref name=\":2\" />  In the later years of McGillivray's life she joined the [[Ontario Society of Artists]] (1917), she was elected an Associate member of the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]](1924),<ref name=\":1\" /> and was a Charter member of the Canadian Society of Painters in Watercolour and its first woman member (1925). <ref name=\"images.ourontario.ca\" />\n\n== Influence and Style ==\n[[File:St. Anthony Harbour, Newfoundland, Florence H. McGillivray.jpg|thumb|St. Anthony Harbour, Newfoundland, Florence H. McGillivray Canadian, 1864 - 1938 oil on canvas 46.7 x 61.6&nbsp;cm Purchased 1926 National Gallery of Canada (no. 3352)]]\n\nMcGillivray traveled across Canada for inspiration.<ref name=\":1\" /> She painted her environment using bold colours and the contour of shapes.<ref name=\":1\" /> McGillivray's artistic style stressed the \"abstract qualities of lines, shapes and forms\"<ref name=\":1\" /> that was expressed in her work through a large amount of paint applied using the palette knife in her oil paintings.<ref name=\":1\" /> Working outdoors, the painter developed a powerful style that defined her career.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHer inspiration derived from various environments<ref name=\":1\" /> including her hometown of Whitby, and her travel to the Gatineau area <ref name=\":0\" />, as well as to Eastern Canada, including Newfoundland, and to Trinidad, Jamaica, Bahama Islands in the West Indies, Alaska, Eastern United States, Western Canada, Venice, Italy and the Swiss Alps.<ref name=\"cwahi.concordia.ca\" /> She worked in many media which included watercolour, pastel and oil.<ref name=\":1\" /> During her trip to Europe, she had encountered newly forming art styles of Symbolism and Post Impressionism that impacted and influenced her art. Her artwork is expressed mainly with vivid colours of contouring shapes and dabs of paint that simplifies the form of an object.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Later Years==\nMcGillivray traveled extensively in search of new landscape scenery to paint. In 1930, by then in her mid-60s, McGillivray bought a house in Toronto where she retired.<ref name=\":1\" /> She continued to paint primarily from the sketches she had accumulated from around the world. As a landscape painter, McGillivray found some prestige and recognition while alive, but not quite as much as Thomson though she had encouraged him in his modernist path. Painting landscapes in a modernist style was not something expected from a woman in the early 1900s. McGillivray never married and left no children. She died at age 74 in Toronto, on May 7, 1938.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Allen, Bill. \"Up the Gatineau!\" ''Following Florence'' XLII, 2016.\n* Art Gallery of Ontario. \"The Canadian Collection.\" ''Art Gallery of Ontario'', 288-289.

This account suggests new friends to Miles, people in his hometown of [[New York City]], who will require assistance. Initially skeptical, Miles decides to follow these suggestions to help people. His first suggestion had been a doctor who lost a patient and was on the verge of losing his girlfriend. While following up on his second suggestion, he meets and befriends Cara (Beane), a struggling magazine writer. Together with Cara and his hacker friend Rakesh (Sharma), Miles tries to find out who is behind the \"God\" account while still providing help to the account's continuing friend suggestions.  Miles' atheist views sometimes causes friction with his father (Morton), who is the pastor of an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church in [[Harlem]].\n\n==Use of Facebook==\n''God Friended Me'' uses [[Facebook]] frequently as a narrative device. The \"Friended\" in the title ''God Friended Me'' refers to the act of [[Friending and following|friending]] someone on social media, granting that person special privileges (on the service in question) with respect to oneself.{{sfn|Palfrey|Gasser|2010|p=25}} In ''God Friended Me'', this allows for God to contact Miles.\n\nWhile the majority of Facebook's revenue is advertisement-derived,<ref>{{cite web |author=Jolie O'Dell 203 |url=http://mashable.com/2011/01/17/facebooks-ad-revenue-hit-1-86b-for-2010/ |title=Facebook's Ad Revenue Hit $1.86B for 2010 |publisher=Mashable.com |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Womack |first=Brian |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-20/facebook-revenue-will-reach-4-27-billion-emarketer-says-1-.html |title=Facebook Revenue Will Reach $4.27 Billion, EMarketer Says |publisher=Bloomberg |date=September 20, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> show creator Steven Lilien says that their conversations with Facebook have been limited to discussing \"how much we can portray it.\"<ref name=\"Facebook\">{{cite web|author=Lisa de Moraes|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/god-friended-me-not-highway-to-heaven-facebook-greg-berlanti-tca-1202440479/|title='God Friended Me' Is No 'Highway to Heaven' EPs Insist|date=August 5, 2018|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref> According to executive producer Bryan Wynbrandt, the \"God\" of the show will be active on Facebook outside the show, with liking pages and changing their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]] given as examples of their possible online activities.<ref name=\"Activity\">{{cite web|author=Tim Surette |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/god-friended-me-god-catholic-christian-cbs/|title=''God Friended Me'' Won't Just Be About One God|date=August 5, 2018|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Main ===\n*[[Brandon Micheal Hall]]<ref name=\"order\" /> as Miles Finer, a skeptical atheist who hosts a podcast about his atheism.

This leads Miles, Cara, Rakesh and Jaya to the [[Rose Center for Earth and Space|Hayden Planetarium]] looking for answers. Miles and Cara find Fliss, a woman from a small town who is in New York looking for her lost love based on a list of locations he gave her when they were at camp together. Rakesh and Jaya find Beaker, a staff member at the Planetarium who is looking for a lost star using software that Rakesh recognizes as being associated with the God account.

Meanwhile, Rakesh finds out Jaya has a medical fellowship that will take her away from New York for up to a year.

Hasan confronts Tara and David (and Miles) at the courthouse just before their marriage. Miles tries to reason with Hasan, but fails, and Tara reluctantly leaves with her father. At a loss, Miles consults with his father, who explains how a child losing faith can feel to a parent like losing them altogether.

However, Ava takes a turn for the worse and will need a kidney almost immediately, forcing Miles to come up with a creative solution.

Trevor says he was just about to tell Rose, his late best friend's sister, that he loves her, when Miles and the God account reunited her with Lt. Fremont (S2.Ep1). Miles tries to reason with Trevor when he insists he will tell Rose how he feels at her rehearsal dinner. In anger, Trevor posts in the podcast comments that Miles is hiding his feelings for Cara. Miles asks Rakesh to remove the post as soon as he sees it. With help from Rakesh's soul mate app, Miles shows Trevor there is likely someone else who is right for him, but Trevor follows through on his plan. Though it leads to Rose telling Trevor she doesn't love him that way, Trevor gets needed closure, prompting him to tell Miles he should say how he feels about Cara. However, Adam saw the earlier post from Trevor, and he breaks up with Cara. Meanwhile, Rakesh, Zack and Corey are able to successfully hack the DoD, but while trying to locate the source of the code, the program crashes. Rakesh interprets this as the God account protecting itself, but later learns that Corey installed a virus to destroy the account. Also, Ali becomes suspicious when Emily lies about seeing another woman.\n |LineColor       = 549FC3\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 41\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 21\n |Title           = Miracles\n |RTitle          = <ref name=\"TFC\" />\n |DirectedBy      =\n |WrittenBy       = \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|26}}\n |ProdCode        = \n |Viewers         = \n |ShortSummary    = <!-- Episode summaries must be expressed in your own words.

This account suggests new friends to Miles, people in his hometown of [[New York City]], who will require assistance. Initially skeptical, Miles decides to follow these suggestions to help people. His first suggestion had been a doctor who lost a patient and was on the verge of losing his girlfriend. While following up on his second suggestion, he meets and befriends Cara (Beane), a struggling magazine writer. Together with Cara and his hacker friend Rakesh (Sharma), Miles tries to find out who is behind the \"God\" account while still providing help to the account's continuing friend suggestions.  Miles' atheist views sometimes causes friction with his father (Morton), who is the pastor of an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church in [[Harlem]].\n\n==Use of Facebook==\n''God Friended Me'' uses [[Facebook]] frequently as a narrative device. The \"Friended\" in the title ''God Friended Me'' refers to the act of [[Friending and following|friending]] someone on social media, granting that person special privileges (on the service in question) with respect to oneself.{{sfn|Palfrey|Gasser|2010|p=25}} In ''God Friended Me'', this allows for God to contact Miles.\n\nWhile the majority of Facebook's revenue is advertisement-derived,<ref>{{cite web |author=Jolie O'Dell 203 |url=http://mashable.com/2011/01/17/facebooks-ad-revenue-hit-1-86b-for-2010/ |title=Facebook's Ad Revenue Hit $1.86B for 2010 |publisher=Mashable.com |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Womack |first=Brian |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-20/facebook-revenue-will-reach-4-27-billion-emarketer-says-1-.html |title=Facebook Revenue Will Reach $4.27 Billion, EMarketer Says |publisher=Bloomberg |date=September 20, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> show creator Steven Lilien says that their conversations with Facebook have been limited to discussing \"how much we can portray it.\"<ref name=\"Facebook\">{{cite web|author=Lisa de Moraes|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/god-friended-me-not-highway-to-heaven-facebook-greg-berlanti-tca-1202440479/|title='God Friended Me' Is No 'Highway to Heaven' EPs Insist|date=August 5, 2018|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref> According to executive producer Bryan Wynbrandt, the \"God\" of the show will be active on Facebook outside the show, with liking pages and changing their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]] given as examples of their possible online activities.<ref name=\"Activity\">{{cite web|author=Tim Surette |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/god-friended-me-god-catholic-christian-cbs/|title=''God Friended Me'' Won't Just Be About One God|date=August 5, 2018|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Main ===\n*[[Brandon Micheal Hall]]<ref name=\"order\" /> as Miles Finer, a skeptical atheist who hosts a podcast about his atheism.

Miles tells Rachel that her sister obviously loved her, and Rachel finds peace and strives to become sober. Meanwhile, Rakesh finds out Jaya has a medical fellowship that will take her away from New York for up to a year.

Hasan confronts Tara and David (and Miles) at the courthouse just before their marriage. Miles tries to reason with Hasan, but fails, and Tara reluctantly leaves with her father. At a loss, Miles consults with his father, who explains how a child losing faith can feel to a parent like losing them altogether. Meanwhile, Rakesh breaks the God account's encryption with Cara's help, and they learn about a particular train leaving Grand Central Station later that night. Hasan confronts Miles at his uncle's 25th wedding anniversary party because Tara has run away. Miles realizes that the train isn't the location of whoever is behind the God account, but of David and Tara.

Despite wanting to walk away from the God account, Cara agrees to help when she learns a life is in danger, and she retrieves Miguel's wife to help talk him down. Miles insists that between his podcast and Cara's journalism outlets, they can raise the money to help Ava. However, Ava takes a turn for the worse and will need a kidney almost immediately, forcing Miles to come up with a creative solution. Miles had told Cara that Miguel will be his last friend suggestion, as he wants to choose her over the account. Seeing how Miles just effectively saved two lives, Cara insists she could never live with the thought that she prevented Miles from doing more good work, and she ends their relationship. Elsewhere, Arthur makes good on his promise to balance church duties with spending time with Trish, causing Trish to say she wants to marry him as soon as possible.

The hacker reveals he was hired by a man named Alphonse Jeffries to create the back door. While Rakesh tracks down that lead, Miles and Joy help an elderly holocaust survivor named Abe ([[Judd Hirsch]]), who noticed his father's gold watch on a jewelry auction site and hopes it can lead him to answers about his long-lost sister, Rose. Soon after a successful resolution of that case, Miles learns that Alphonse and Arthur served in Vietnam together and, in fact, Arthur saved Alphonse's life. Having revealed that he and Trish are getting married that weekend, Arthur says he invited Alphonse to the wedding. Now convinced that Alphonse is the source of the God account, Miles tries to win back Cara. Cara agrees that their love is worth any risk, but she's also hiding a secret: she saw Ali at the hospital while her mother was applying for a nursing job, and Ali revealed she was getting tested for cancer.\n |LineColor       = 549FC3\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 32\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 12\n |Title           = BFF\n |DirectedBy      = Annabelle Frost\n |WrittenBy       = Steven Lilien & Bryan Wynbrandt\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|12}}\n |ProdCode        = T40.10212\n |Viewers         = 6.19<ref name=\"2.12\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-final-ratings-jan-12-2020/|title=NFL adjusts up, 'Bob's Burgers' and 'Bless the Harts' adjust down: Sunday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=January 14, 2020|accessdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = While preparing to confront Alphonse Jeffries at Arthur's wedding, Miles receives a friend suggestion that turns out to be Trish's daughter, Julia ([[Amber Stevens West]]).

He tells Jeffries he knows he's behind the God account, but Jeffries denies it. Miles then asks Jeffries why he would hire a hacker to create a back door for the New York Sun client information, and Jeffries replies he didn't hire anyone. Miles, Rakesh and Joy then race to the apartment where they previously met the hacker, and find it completely cleaned out except for one item: a Queen of Hearts playing card.

Mr. Johnson says that they are closing the cinema for good in two days.

The line was unconnected to any other, though it passed under what is now the [[West Somerset Railway]] south of the village of Watchet. The station was located west of the top of the line's most striking feature - a three quarters of a mile, [[Cable railway|rope-hauled incline]] at a [[slope|gradient]] of 1 in 4 (25%).\n\nThe line's seven stations were designed by Rice Hopkins.{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=100-104 & 377}} Luxborough Road was one of the five which showed a clear family resemblance. It was built in anticipation of offering the usual goods and passenger facilities, but no regular passenger service ever ran south of Comberow. Almost immediately the building was erected it was converted to miners' accommodation by adding a lean-to at the rear. By 1900 the building was roofless and without windows, having been used as a source of materials for repairing other railway buildings.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=361}}\n\n==Services==\nThe stone-built station opened for goods traffic in 1861. The railway introduced a passenger service in September 1865, connecting Watchet with the village of [[Washford]] and the hamlets of [[Roadwater]] and Comberow.{{sfn|Carpenter|1988|p=44}} Passengers were carried from Comberow up the rope-hauled incline to {{rws|Brendon Hill}} and on through Luxborough Road to {{rws|Gupworthy}} on a wagon, free of charge, but at their own risk.{{sfn|Sellick|1981|pp=6, 24 & 26}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=263-7 & 286-7}} As no fares were collected no tickets were issued to or from Luxborough Road. Sources are unclear whether the station was ever staffed or carried any paying goods traffic.\n\nThe initial passenger service down the valley consisted of four trains a day out and back.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|pp=104-5}}\n\nLike other railways built to serve one industry, such as iron ore carrying lines in [[Cumbria]], their fortunes were at the mercy of that industry. Iron and steel making was given to boom and bust and suffered a significant downturn in the 1870s, exacerbated by imports of cheaper and better ore from abroad. The iron mines which provided the WSMR's staple traffic stuttered to complete closure between 1879 and 1883. The line did not close immediately, two mixed trains a day continued to run until 1898, when all traffic ceased.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=399}}\n\nIn 1907 the Somerset Mineral Syndicate made an attempt to revive the line, reopening Colton mine and starting a new bore at Timwood. Apart from a reopening day special on 4 July 1907{{sfn|Scott-Morgan|1980|p=10}} no passenger service was provided. The syndicate did not reopen Luxborough Road or Gupworthy stations.\n\nThe venture collapsed in March 1910.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|p=76}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=327}}\n\n==Abandonment==\nAfter closure in 1910 the line was subject to minimal maintenance{{sfn|Sellick|1981|p=35}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=339-340, 349 & 360}} until its metals were requisitioned for the war effort in 1917.\n\nWith neither track, rolling stock nor prospects an Act of Parliament was sought and passed to abandon the railway. Its assets were auctioned on 8 August 1924 and the company was wound up in 1925.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=352}}\n\nEvocative contemporary descriptions of the line in its later years have been preserved.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|pp=66-67 & 76-77}}\n\n==Afterlife==\nBy 2016 much of the route could still be traced on the ground, on maps and on satellite images. The incline from Comberow to Brendon Hill is a Listed structure. No trace of Luxborough Road station remains. Less evidence of Luxborough Road station has survived than with other stations on the line, most is concerned with neighbouring pits, whose workers doubtless constituted the great majority of the station's patronage.<ref>{{cite web

Railway|collapse=yes}}\n\n'''Luxborough Road''' (sometimes referred to as \"Langham\" or \"Langham Hill\") was an intermediate station on the [[West Somerset Mineral Railway]] (WSMR), which was built primarily to carry [[iron ore]] from [[Mining on the Brendon Hills|mines]] to [[Watchet harbour]] in [[Somerset]], England. The line was unconnected to any other, though it passed under what is now the [[West Somerset Railway]] south of the village of Watchet. The station was located west of the top of the line's most striking feature - a three quarters of a mile, [[Cable railway|rope-hauled incline]] at a [[slope|gradient]] of 1 in 4 (25%).\n\nThe line's seven stations were designed by Rice Hopkins.{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=100-104 & 377}} Luxborough Road was one of the five which showed a clear family resemblance. It was built in anticipation of offering the usual goods and passenger facilities, but no regular passenger service ever ran south of Comberow. Almost immediately the building was erected it was converted to miners' accommodation by adding a lean-to at the rear. By 1900 the building was roofless and without windows, having been used as a source of materials for repairing other railway buildings.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=361}}\n\n==Services==\nThe stone-built station opened for goods traffic in 1861. The railway introduced a passenger service in September 1865, connecting Watchet with the village of [[Washford]] and the hamlets of [[Roadwater]] and Comberow.{{sfn|Carpenter|1988|p=44}} Passengers were carried from Comberow up the rope-hauled incline to {{rws|Brendon Hill}} and on through Luxborough Road to {{rws|Gupworthy}} on a wagon, free of charge, but at their own risk.{{sfn|Sellick|1981|pp=6, 24 & 26}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=263-7 & 286-7}} As no fares were collected no tickets were issued to or from Luxborough Road. Sources are unclear whether the station was ever staffed or carried any paying goods traffic.\n\nThe initial passenger service down the valley consisted of four trains a day out and back.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|pp=104-5}}\n\nLike other railways built to serve one industry, such as iron ore carrying lines in [[Cumbria]], their fortunes were at the mercy of that industry. Iron and steel making was given to boom and bust and suffered a significant downturn in the 1870s, exacerbated by imports of cheaper and better ore from abroad. The iron mines which provided the WSMR's staple traffic stuttered to complete closure between 1879 and 1883. The line did not close immediately, two mixed trains a day continued to run until 1898, when all traffic ceased.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=399}}\n\nIn 1907 the Somerset Mineral Syndicate made an attempt to revive the line, reopening Colton mine and starting a new bore at Timwood. Apart from a reopening day special on 4 July 1907{{sfn|Scott-Morgan|1980|p=10}} no passenger service was provided. The syndicate did not reopen Luxborough Road or Gupworthy stations.\n\nThe venture collapsed in March 1910.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|p=76}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=327}}\n\n==Abandonment==\nAfter closure in 1910 the line was subject to minimal maintenance{{sfn|Sellick|1981|p=35}}{{sfn|Jones|2011|pp=339-340, 349 & 360}} until its metals were requisitioned for the war effort in 1917.\n\nWith neither track, rolling stock nor prospects an Act of Parliament was sought and passed to abandon the railway. Its assets were auctioned on 8 August 1924 and the company was wound up in 1925.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=352}}\n\nEvocative contemporary descriptions of the line in its later years have been preserved.{{sfn|Sellick|1970|pp.66-67 & 76-77}}\n\n==Afterlife==\nBy 2016 much of the route could still be traced on the ground, on maps and on satellite images. The incline from Comberow to Brendon Hill is a Listed structure. No trace of Luxborough Road station remains. Less evidence of Luxborough Road station has survived than with other stations on the line, most is concerned with neighbouring pits, whose workers doubtless constituted the great majority of the station's patronage.<ref>{{cite web

{"title_page": "Kaleida Labs", "text_new": "{{for|the community in Manitoba|Kaleida, Manitoba}}\n'''Kaleida Labs''' formed in 1991 to produce the [[multimedia]] [[cross-platform]] '''Kaleida Media Player''' and the [[object oriented]] [[scripting language]] '''ScriptX''' that was used to program its behavior. The system was aimed at the production of interactive [[CD ROM]] titles, an area of major effort in the early 1990s. When the system was delivered in 1994, it had relatively high system requirements and memory footprint, and lacked a native [[PowerPC]] version on the [[Apple Macintosh|Mac]] platform. Around the same time, rapid changes in the market, especially the expansion of the [[World Wide Web]] and the [[Java programming language]], pushed the interactive CD market into a niche role. The Kaleida platform failed to gain significant traction and the company was closed in 1996.\n\nKaleida was one of three joint ventures of the 1990s between Apple and IBM, including the [[Taligent]] [[operating system]] and the [[AIM alliance]] with [[Motorola]] for the PowerPC platform.  ScriptX was one of several similar software platforms that started at Apple in that timeframe. The [[SK8]] system was also aimed at the multimedia market, although it evolved from what was originally a major upgrade to [[HyperCard]]. The [[Dylan programming language]] was a more full-featured platform, aimed at general programming not just multimedia. Development of all of these software projects ended at approximately the same time.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nAnnounced in 1991, the company began operations in the summer of 1992 with [[Nat Goldhaber]] serving as its first CEO.<ref name=named>Lawrence Fisher, [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/24/business/business-technology-apple-ibm-venture-chief-is-named.html \"Apple-I.B.M. Venture Chief Is Named\"], ''New York Times'', June 24, 1992</ref> The company was staffed by hand picking members of Apple's [[QuickTime]] team, along with members from the big-iron content delivery side at IBM.<ref name=strep>\"Strep Throat\", [http://www.suck.com/daily/95/11/22/ \"Infant Mortality and Other Tragedies\"], suck.com, November 22, 1995</ref> Kaleida's corporate offices were located in Mountain View, California, at sites near the Shoreline Amphitheater on the east side of U.S. 101.

Ultimately, only two multimedia content projects ever shipped using ScriptX 1.5. One was a CD-ROM version of the Swedish National Encyclopedia, [[Nationalencyklopedin]], developed by Linn\u00e9 Data of Gothenburg, Sweden. The other was an interactive music title, [https://web.archive.org/web/20051214112845/http://www.flank.com/sites/calliope/titles/ragtime/ Robert Winter's Crazy for Ragtime].\n\n===After Kaleida===\nWithin a few months, development of ScriptX withered away inside Apple, and the remaining employees had either migrated to other jobs at Apple, or had left for other companies in the industry. The Director application remained a major force in the multimedia market for a time, but was supplanted and then replaced, by [[Adobe Flash|Flash]]. Early versions of Flash are in many ways a clone of ScriptX, using a small plug-in runtime with an event-driven language and similar resource requirements.\n\n==Description==\n===ScriptX===\nThe principal software architect of ScriptX was [[John Wainwright (computer scientist)|John Wainwright]], an Australian-born computer scientist. ScriptX was implemented in C, using an extensive library called Objects in C that Wainwright had developed before joining Kaleida, and sold to the company at its inception. Objects in C used preprocessor directives to simulate an object system within the libraries. The library featured more than 240 classes, many of them designed to support multimedia as well as create customized user interfaces. Common data structures such as arrays and linked lists were implemented as [[collection class]]es in the library. \n\nScriptX was an object oriented scripting language, which used design elements from \"Smalltalk, Dylan, Hypertalk, Lisp, Object Logo, C++, and Pascal\".<ref name=valdes/> With Smalltalk, it shared the concept of classes, objects, and inheritance, but also featured multiple inheritance in both classes and objects, and dynamic binding of objects at runtime. ScriptX had no primitive data types; even integers were defined as objects. All objects were instances of a class, and classes themselves were instances of a MetaClass object. As in LISP, there were no statements, and every line in a ScriptX program was an expression that returned a value.<ref name=valdes/>\n\nScriptX used [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] running in a separate thread to handle memory, and featured an [[Persistent object store|object store]] for permanent collections. ScriptX supported multi-threading but not multiprocessing, and offered scripting control of lower level operating system features such as events and concurrently running threads. Early multimedia development tools lacked techniques for synchronizing presentations, except by polling the operating system's own clock. Ray Vald\u00e9s, writing in ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]'', noted that, \"a key ScriptX feature is a ''Clock'' class, which provides facilities for synchronizing timed sequences of actions required by multimedia apps.\"<ref name=valdes>Ray Vald\u00e9s, [http://art.net/~hopkins/Don/lang/scriptx/drdobbs/drdobbs-1194b.html \"Introducing ScriptX\"], ''Dr. Dobb's Journal'', November 1994</ref>\n\nFollowing the closure of Kaleida Labs, Wainwright went on to serve as the principal architect of [[MaxScript]], a scripting language for [[3D Studio Max]] that has been used to process content for gaming and 3D applications such as the [[Maxis]] Sims programs.<ref>Don Hopkins, [http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/node/30 \"Automating The Sims Character Animation Pipeline with MaxScript\"]</ref> Thus, ScriptX can be considered a progenitor of MaxScript, which closely resembles ScriptX.\n\n===Example===\nThe following code illustrates the unique syntax of the ScriptX language. It is part of a class that handles mouse tracking in a larger program written by [[Don Hopkins]].<ref>Don Hopkins, [http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/lang/scriptx/tracking.sx \"TrackService: Yet Another Event Handler for ScriptX\"], Kaleida Labs</ref>\n\n -- The sendTrackDrop method sends a trackDrop message to another object. \n method sendTrackDrop self {class Tracker} service target x y data doit -> (\n  \tlocal coords := new Point\n \trepeat while (true) do (\n \t\tif (canObjectDo target trackDrop) then (\n \t\t\treturn (trackDrop target service x y data doit)\n \t\t) else (\n \t\t\tcoords.x := x\n \t\t\tcoords.y := y\n \t\t\tlocal t := findFirstAtPoint target coords\n \t\t\tif (t == empty) do return false\n \t\t\tx := x - t.x\n \t\t\ty := y - t.y\n \t\t\ttarget := t\n \t\t)\n \t)\n  )\n\nThis code is responsible for forwarding trackDrop messages between objects, and illustrates a number of uncommon features of the ScriptX language. Of minor note of interest is the <code>:=</code> assignment operator, like that of Pascal.\n\nVariables are marked <code>local</code> to determine their [[Scope (computer science)|scope]].<ref name=valdes/> This is the opposite of most modern languages, where \"local\" is the default scope, and such a declaration would be redundant. In conventional languages the scoping visibility is defined by the location in the [[source code]] file - variables declared inside a method are local to that method, those defined outside methods or other declarations are global to the class (or program).\n\nThis lack of file-based scoping is a base feature of the ScriptX language and others like it, notably [[Dylan (programming language)|Dylan]]. In conventional languages like [[Java (programming language)|Java]], classes and similar constructs are defined within a single file, or at least a \"master file\". Scope is defined by the file system and the code's location within it. In contrast, in ScriptX any method can be defined on any class in any file. In this example, the method <code>sendTrackDrop</code> is being applied to the <code>Tracker</code> class, and can be placed within any file that will be accessed during runtime. This allows programmers to organize their code by class or by functionality, at the cost of some extra syntax.\n\n===ScriptX vs. Java===\nJava has many similarities with ScriptX.  Like ScriptX, it is an object based language with elements of syntax that are similar to C and C++. Java classes support a limited form of multiple inheritance through [[Interface (Java)|interfaces]], and the Java runtime environment utilizes a [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collector]] for memory management with a \"tracing\" architecture similar to that of ScriptX. Both Java and ScriptX translate programs into a platform-independent bytecode.  \n\nUnlike ScriptX, Java is not a pure object system, and has primitive data types.  In contrast with ScriptX expressions, Java programs are always written inside a class definition, and return either a '''value''' or '''void'''.  This makes Java code much easier to secure, to protect from tampering and malicious interference. Java was able from the beginning to support multi-processing as well as multi-threaded applications, and thus was naturally scalable.  These features, and other attributes of Java, made it more suitable for a distributed and networking environment than ScriptX.\n\nAlthough both ScriptX and Java were designed as platform independent virtual machine environments, their philosophy and implementation were quite different. The Kaleida Media Player was a complex [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] that required several megabytes to run, and Kaleida never achieved effective performance on a system with less than 16 MB of [[random-access memory]]. By contrast, Java was designed to run compiled bytecode on a stripped down virtual machine that could be implemented on virtually any 16-bit or larger processor. In this way, Java could be used anywhere from handheld devices or consumer appliances to mainframe computers. \n\nIn 1995, Java was being demonstrated mostly as a runtime environment for small applets, as code that could be embedded in web pages and downloaded to run in the browser. Sun Microsystems provided detailed specifications for Java, released many classes in open source, and aggressively formed alliances to distribute it and share its development with other companies throughout the computer hardware and software industries.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Kaleida Labs Inc.

The system was aimed at the production of interactive [[CD ROM]] titles, an area of major effort in the early 1990s. When the system was delivered in 1994, it had relatively high system requirements and memory footprint, and lacked a native [[PowerPC]] version on the [[Apple Macintosh|Mac]] platform. Around the same time, rapid changes in the market, especially the expansion of the [[World Wide Web]] and the [[Java programming language]], pushed the interactive CD market into a niche role. The Kaleida platform failed to gain significant traction and the company was closed in 1996.\n\nKaleida was one of three early 1990s joint ventures between Apple and IBM, which also included the [[Taligent]] [[operating system]] and the [[AIM alliance]] with [[Motorola]] for the PowerPC platform.  ScriptX was also one of several similar software platforms that started at Apple in that timeframe. The [[SK8]] system was also aimed at the multimedia market, although it evolved from what was originally a major upgrade to [[HyperCard]]. The [[Dylan programming language]] was a more full-featured platform, aimed at general programming not just multimedia. Development of all of these projects ended at approximately the same time.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nAnnounced in 1991, the company began operations in the summer of 1992 with [[Nat Goldhaber]] serving as its first CEO.<ref name=named>Lawrence Fisher, [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/24/business/business-technology-apple-ibm-venture-chief-is-named.html \"Apple-I.B.M.

One was a CD-ROM version of the Swedish National Encyclopedia, [[Nationalencyklopedin]], developed by Linn\u00e9 Data of Gothenburg, Sweden. The other was an interactive music title, [https://web.archive.org/web/20051214112845/http://www.flank.com/sites/calliope/titles/ragtime/ Robert Winter's Crazy for Ragtime].\n\n===After Kaleida===\nWithin a few months, development of ScriptX withered away inside Apple, and the remaining employees had either migrated to other jobs at Apple, or had left for other companies in the industry. The Director application remained a major force in the multimedia market for a time, but was supplanted and then replaced, by [[Adobe Flash|Flash]]. Early versions of Flash are in many ways a clone of ScriptX, using a small plug-in runtime with an event-driven language and similar resource requirements.\n\n==Description==\n===ScriptX===\nThe principal software architect of ScriptX was [[John Wainwright (computer scientist)|John Wainwright]], an Australian-born computer scientist. ScriptX was implemented in C, using an extensive library called Objects in C that Wainwright had developed before joining Kaleida, and sold to the company at its inception. Objects in C used preprocessor directives to simulate an object system within the libraries. The library featured more than 240 classes, many of them designed to support multimedia as well as create customized user interfaces. Common data structures such as arrays and linked lists were implemented as [[collection class]]es in the library. \n\nScriptX was an object oriented scripting language, which used design elements from \"Smalltalk, Dylan, Hypertalk, Lisp, Object Logo, C++, and Pascal\".<ref name=valdes/> With Smalltalk, it shared the concept of classes, objects, and inheritance, but also featured multiple inheritance in both classes and objects, and dynamic binding of objects at runtime. ScriptX had no primitive data types; even integers were defined as objects. All objects were instances of a class, and classes themselves were instances of a MetaClass object. As in LISP, there were no statements, and every line in a ScriptX program was an expression that returned a value.<ref name=valdes/>\n\nScriptX used [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] running in a separate thread to handle memory, and featured an [[Persistent object store|object store]] for permanent collections. ScriptX supported multi-threading but not multiprocessing, and offered scripting control of lower level operating system features such as events and concurrently running threads. Early multimedia development tools lacked techniques for synchronizing presentations, except by polling the operating system's own clock. Ray Vald\u00e9s, writing in ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]'', noted that, \"a key ScriptX feature is a ''Clock'' class, which provides facilities for synchronizing timed sequences of actions required by multimedia apps.\"<ref name=valdes>Ray Vald\u00e9s, [http://art.net/~hopkins/Don/lang/scriptx/drdobbs/drdobbs-1194b.html \"Introducing ScriptX\"], ''Dr. Dobb's Journal'', November 1994</ref>\n\nFollowing the closure of Kaleida Labs, Wainwright went on to serve as the principal architect of [[MaxScript]], a scripting language for [[3D Studio Max]] that has been used to process content for gaming and 3D applications such as the [[Maxis]] Sims programs.<ref>Don Hopkins, [http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/node/30 \"Automating The Sims Character Animation Pipeline with MaxScript\"]</ref> Thus, ScriptX can be considered a progenitor of MaxScript, which closely resembles ScriptX.\n\n===Example===\nThe following code illustrates the unique syntax of the ScriptX language. It is part of a class that handles mouse tracking in a larger program written by [[Don Hopkins]].<ref>Don Hopkins, [http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/lang/scriptx/tracking.sx \"TrackService: Yet Another Event Handler for ScriptX\"], Kaleida Labs</ref>\n\n -- The sendTrackDrop method sends a trackDrop message to another object. \n method sendTrackDrop self {class Tracker} service target x y data doit -> (\n  \tlocal coords := new Point\n \trepeat while (true) do (\n \t\tif (canObjectDo target trackDrop) then (\n \t\t\treturn (trackDrop target service x y data doit)\n \t\t) else (\n \t\t\tcoords.x := x\n \t\t\tcoords.y := y\n \t\t\tlocal t := findFirstAtPoint target coords\n \t\t\tif (t == empty) do return false\n \t\t\tx := x - t.x\n \t\t\ty := y - t.y\n \t\t\ttarget := t\n \t\t)\n \t)\n  )\n\nThis code is responsible for forwarding trackDrop messages between objects, and illustrates a number of uncommon features of the ScriptX language. Of minor note of interest is the <code>:=</code> assignment operator, like that of Pascal.\n\nVariables are marked <code>local</code> to determine their [[Scope (computer science)|scope]].<ref name=valdes/> This is the opposite of most modern languages, where \"local\" is the default scope, and such a declaration would be redundant. In conventional languages the scoping visibility is defined by the location in the [[source code]] file - variables declared inside a method are local to that method, those defined outside methods or other declarations are global to the class (or program).\n\nThis lack of file-based scoping is a base feature of the ScriptX language and others like it, notably [[Dylan (programming language)|Dylan]]. In conventional languages like [[Java (programming language)|Java]], classes and similar constructs are defined within a single file, or at least a \"master file\". Scope is defined by the file system and the code's location within it. In contrast, in ScriptX any method can be defined on any class in any file. In this example, the method <code>sendTrackDrop</code> is being applied to the <code>Tracker</code> class, and can be placed within any file that will be accessed during runtime. This allows programmers to organize their code by class or by functionality, at the cost of some extra syntax.\n\n===ScriptX vs. Java===\nJava has many similarities with ScriptX.  Like ScriptX, it is an object based language with elements of syntax that are similar to C and C++. Java classes support a limited form of multiple inheritance through [[Interface (Java)|interfaces]], and the Java runtime environment utilizes a [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collector]] for memory management with a \"tracing\" architecture similar to that of ScriptX. Both Java and ScriptX translate programs into a platform-independent bytecode.  \n\nUnlike ScriptX, Java is not a pure object system, and has primitive data types.  In contrast with ScriptX expressions, Java programs are always written inside a class definition, and return either a '''value''' or '''void'''.  This makes Java code much easier to secure, to protect from tampering and malicious interference. Java was able from the beginning to support multi-processing as well as multi-threaded applications, and thus was naturally scalable.  These features, and other attributes of Java, made it more suitable for a distributed and networking environment than ScriptX.\n\nAlthough both ScriptX and Java were designed as platform independent virtual machine environments, their philosophy and implementation were quite different. The Kaleida Media Player was a complex [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] that required several megabytes to run, and Kaleida never achieved effective performance on a system with less than 16 MB of [[random-access memory]]. By contrast, Java was designed to run compiled bytecode on a stripped down virtual machine that could be implemented on virtually any 16-bit or larger processor. In this way, Java could be used anywhere from handheld devices or consumer appliances to mainframe computers. \n\nIn 1995, Java was being demonstrated mostly as a runtime environment for small applets, as code that could be embedded in web pages and downloaded to run in the browser. Sun Microsystems provided detailed specifications for Java, released many classes in open source, and aggressively formed alliances to distribute it and share its development with other companies throughout the computer hardware and software industries.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Kaleida Labs Inc.

Brecht discussed the priorities and approach of epic theatre in his work \"[[A Short Organum for the Theatre]]\".<ref name=\"Organum\">Brecht (1949, 276).</ref>  Although many of the concepts and practices involved in Brechtian epic theatre had been around for years, even centuries, Brecht unified them, developed the approach, and popularised it.\n\nNear the end of his career, Brecht preferred the term \"dialectical theatre\" to describe the kind of theatre he pioneered. From his later perspective, the term \"epic theatre\" had become too formal a concept to be of use anymore. According to [[Manfred Wekwerth]], one of Brecht's directors at the [[Berliner Ensemble]] at the time, the term refers to the \"'[[Dialectics#Marxist dialectics|dialecticising]]' of events\" that this approach to theatre-making produces.<ref name=\"willett282\">Quoted by Willett (1964) 282.</ref>\n\nEpic theatre is distinct from other forms of theatre, particularly the early [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] approach and later \"[[Realism (theatre)|psychological realism]]\" developed by [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]. Like Stanislavski, Brecht disliked the shallow spectacle, manipulative plots, and heightened emotion of [[melodrama]]; but where Stanislavski attempted to engender real human behaviour in acting through the techniques of [[Stanislavski's system]] and to absorb the audience completely in the fictional world of the play, Brecht saw this type of theatre as escapist. Brecht's own social and political focus was distinct, too, from [[surrealism]] and the [[Theatre of Cruelty]], as developed in the writings and dramaturgy of [[Antonin Artaud]], who sought to affect audiences viscerally, psychologically, physically, and irrationally. While both produced 'shock' in the audience, epic theatre practices would also include a subsequent moment of understanding and comprehension.\n\n==Techniques==\n===''Verfremdungseffekt''===\nWhile not invented by Brecht, the ''[[Distancing effect|Verfremdungseffekt]]'', known in English as the \"estrangement effect\" or the \"alienation effect\", was made popular by Brecht and is one of the most significant characteristics of epic theatre.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schall|first1=Ekkehard|title=The Craft of Theatre: Seminars and Discussions in Brechtian Theatre|date=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781474243308|page=205}}</ref>  \n\nSome of the ways the ''Verfremdungseffekt'' can be achieved is by having actors play multiple characters, rearrange the set in full view of the audience, and \"break the [[fourth wall]]\" by speaking to the audience. The use of a narrator in ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]]'' is another example of Verfremdungseffekt at work.<ref name=\":0\" /> Lighting can also be used to emulate the effect. For example, flooding the theatre with bright lights (not just the stage) and placing lighting equipment on stage can encourage the audience to fully acknowledge that the production is merely a production instead of reality.\n\nAs with the principle of [[Dramaturgy|dramatic construction]] involved in the epic form of spoken drama amalgamated or what Brecht calls \"[[non-Aristotelian drama]]\", the epic approach to play production utilizes a [[Soviet montage theory|montage]] technique of fragmentation, contrast and contradiction, and [[Interruptions (epic theatre)|interruptions]]. While the French playwright [[Jean Genet]] articulates a very different [[world view]] in his dramas from that found in Brecht's, in a letter to the [[Theatre director|director]] [[Roger Blin]] on the most appropriate approach to staging his ''[[The Screens]]'' in 1966, he advises an epic approach to its production:\n\n{{quote|Each scene, and each section within a scene, must be perfected and played as rigorously and with as much discipline as if it were a short play, complete in itself. Without any smudges. And without there being the slightest suggestion that another scene, or section within a scene, is to follow those that have gone before.<ref>Genet (1966, 25).</ref>}}\n\n===Historicisation===\nHistoricisation is also employed in order to draw connections from a historical event to a similar current event. This can be seen in the plays ''[[Mother Courage and Her Children]]'' and ''[[The Good Person of Szechwan]]'', both written by Brecht, which comment on a current social or political issue using historical contexts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/brecht-interruptions-and-epic-theatre|title=Brecht, interruptions, and epic theatre|last=Gordon|first=Robert|date=7 September 2017|website=British Library}}</ref> \n\nBrecht, too, advised treating each element of a play independently, like a [[music hall]] turn that is able to stand on its own.\nCommon production techniques in epic theatre include a simplified, non-realistic [[scenic design]] offset against a selective realism in costuming and props, as well as announcements or visual captions that interrupt and summarize the action. Brecht used [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] to [[Distancing effect|distance]] his audiences from the depicted events and was heavily influenced by musicals and fairground performers,  putting music and song in his plays.\n\nActing in epic theatre requires actors to play characters believably without convincing either the audience or themselves that they have \"become\" the characters. This is called Gestus, when an actor takes on the physical embodiment of a social commentary. Actors frequently address the audience directly out of character (\"breaking the fourth wall\") and play multiple roles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/brecht-interruptions-and-epic-theatre|title=Brecht, interruptions, and epic theatre|last=Gordon|first=Robert|date=7 September 2017|website=British Library}}</ref> Brecht thought it was important that the choices the characters made were explicit, and tried to develop a style of acting wherein it was evident that the characters were choosing one action over another.

It was formed during [[World War II]] by [[Charles Henderson (character)|Charles Henderson]]; a British spy who had used children during an operation in France. It is populated by around 350 adolescents and children, who live on the campus when not on a mission to help the police. No-one in the world knows where CHERUB campus is situated except its employees, members and certain police and high level members of the British government.\n\nCHERUB began with a small number of boys which swelled in size as the government realised its worth. After several years of operation it took in a trial group of girls, which proved successful. Since then CHERUB campus has grown a significant amount, improving many of its facilities. The dojo was built on behalf of a successful operation that took place in Japan and the new mission preparation building was built by the chairman of the first 6 novels, Dr. McAfferty, better known as Mac. After retiring at the end of ''Man Vs Beast'', he is replaced by Zara Asker, who holds the role for ten years until stepping down to be replace by husband Ewart Asker shortly before ''New Guard''.<ref name=\"Recruit\" />\n\nAfter years of speculation, Muchamore said in the [[Henderson's Boys]] novel ''Eagle Day'' that CHERUB stood for Charles Henderson Espionage Research Unit B; this was later confirmed in ''Secret Army'' by Eileen McAfferty in a telegram.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main article|List of CHERUB characters}}\n*[[James Adams (character)|James Adams]] is the main protagonist of the series.

She befriends James in the first novel and helps him get through basic training.

It was formed during [[World War II]] by [[Charles Henderson (character)|Charles Henderson]]; a British spy who had used children during an operation in France. It is populated by around 350 adolescents and children, who live on the campus when not on a mission to help the police. No-one in the world knows where CHERUB campus is situated except its employees, members and certain police and high level members of the British government.\n\nCHERUB began with a small number of boys which swelled in size as the government realised its worth. After several years of operation it took in a trial group of girls, which proved successful. Since then CHERUB campus has grown a significant amount, improving many of its facilities. The dojo was built on behalf of a successful operation that took place in Japan and the new mission preparation building was built by the chairman of the first 6 novels, Dr. McAfferty, better known as Mac. After retiring at the end of ''Man Vs Beast'', he is replaced by Zara Asker, who holds the role for ten years until stepping down to be replace by husband Ewart Asker shortly before ''New Guard''.<ref name=\"Recruit\" />\n\nAfter years of speculation, Muchamore said in the [[Henderson's Boys]] novel ''Eagle Day'' that CHERUB stood for Charles Henderson Espionage Research Unit B; this was later confirmed in ''Secret Army'' by Eileen McAfferty in a telegram.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main article|List of CHERUB characters}}\n*[[James Adams (character)|James Adams]] is the main protagonist of the series. He is a strong, stocky boy ranging from just under twelve to eighteen years old through the course of the series. Although usually friendly, he does occasionally have anger management issues.

He gets on well with his half-sister [[Lauren Adams]].\n*[[Lauren Adams]] is James' sister. She is headstrong and does well in missions, however she does create various schemes to pay people back for actions, which result in her receiving punishments. She has a boyfriend called [[Greg Rathbone|Rat]].\n*[[Kyle Blueman]] is another CHERUB agent who is friends with James. He was recruited when he was eight years old. He is homosexual, something that James has trouble coming to terms with. He is kind, but will also conduct revenge schemes, including one in which he exposes politician Tan Abdullah as conducting illegal activities in [[Shadow Wave]], the twelfth book of the series.\n*[[Kerry Chang]] is a James' main love interest throughout the series. She befriends James in the first novel and helps him get through basic training. She is also a Hong-Kong born karate champion\n*[[Bruce Norris (character)|Bruce Norris]] is a CHERUB agent who is friends with James.

Here, the former explains most of the 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness and planet thermal emission contributes to much of the 0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness. Their non-detections with ground-based infrared data suggested that Fomalhaut b had to be less massive than about 3 Jupiter masses.\n\nHowever, Fomalhaut b should be detectable in space-based infrared data if its mass is between 1-3 Jupiter masses.  But sensitive infrared Spitzer Space Telescope observations failed to detect Fomalhaut b, implying that Fomalhaut b has less than 1 Jupiter mass.<ref name=\"Janson2012\"/>  Furthermore, although the planet was thought to be a plausible explanation for Fomalhaut's eccentric debris ring, measurements in the Kalas et al. paper hinted that it was moving too fast (i.e. not apsidally aligned) for this explanation to work.  Finally, researchers analyzing September\u2013October 2011 [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA) data for Fomalhaut's debris ring suggested an alternate hypothesis: that the ring could be shaped by much smaller, shepherding planets, neither of which needed to be Fomalhaut b.<ref name=\"Boley2012\">{{Cite journal |title=Constraining the Planetary System of Fomalhaut Using High-resolution ALMA Observations |first=Aaron |last=Boley |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=2012 |arxiv = 1204.0007|bibcode = 2012ApJ...750L..21B |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/750/1/L21 |volume=750 |pages=L21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=36681 |title=ALMA Reveals Workings of Nearby Planetary System |accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref>  These results invoked skepticism about Fomalhaut b's status as an extrasolar planet.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20945-new-doubts-about-poster-child-of-exoplanets.html |author=Lisa Grossman |title=New doubts about 'poster child' of exoplanets |journal=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yudhijit Bhattacharjee |title=Celebrated Exoplanet Vanishes in a Cloud of Dust-Or Maybe Not |journal=Science |page=515 |volume=335 |date=3 February 2012 |bibcode = 2012Sci...335..515B |doi = 10.1126/science.335.6068.515 |issue=6068}}</ref>\n\n==Recovery, independent confirmation by Hubble and further additional findings==\nOn October 24, 2012, a team led by Thayne Currie at the [[University of Toronto]] announced the first independent recovery of Fomalhaut b and revived the claim that Fomalhaut b identifies a planet.<ref name=\"Currie\"/> They reanalyzed the original Hubble data using new, more powerful algorithms for separating planet light from starlight and confirmed that Fomalhaut b does exist. They also provided a new detection of Fomalhaut b at 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m.\nThey modeled the optical detections and infrared upper limits for Fomalhaut b, showing that Fomalhaut b's emission can be completely explained by starlight scattered by small dust and arguing that this dust surrounds an unseen planetary-mass object.   Thus, they consider Fomalhaut b to plausibly be a \"planet identified from direct imaging\" even if Fomalhaut b is not, strictly speaking, a directly imaged planet insofar as the light does not come from a planetary atmosphere.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>\n\nA second paper made public a day later and led by Raphael Galicher and Christian Marois at the [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]] also independently recovered Fomalhaut b and confirmed the new 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m detection, claiming the spectral energy distribution (SED) of Fomalhaut b cannot be explained as due to direct or scattered radiation from a massive planet. They considered two models to explain the SED: (1) a large circumplanetary disk around a massive, but unseen, planet and (2) the aftermath of a collision during the past 100 years of two Kuiper belt objects of radii about 50&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\nSubsequent Hubble data obtained in 2010 and 2012 with the [[STIS]] instrument by [[Paul Kalas]] and collaborators again recovered Fomalhaut b<ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>.   However, analysis of Fomalhaut b's astrometry showed that the object has a high eccentricity (e = 0.8), its orbit (projected on the sky) crosses the plane of Fomalhaut's debris ring, and thus it is unlikely to be the object sculpting the debris ring's sharp inner edge.  Fomalhaut b's high eccentricity may be evidence for a significant dynamical interaction with a hitherto unseen planet at a smaller orbital separation.\n\nThe revival of the claim that Fomalhaut b is (possibly) a planet after it had been discounted led some to nickname the object a \"zombie planet\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/fomalhaut-exo.html|work=NASA |title= New Study Brings a Doubted Exoplanet 'Back from the Dead'|accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> although this is a non-technical term used in press material and does not appear in any peer-reviewed manuscript.\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n\nAssuming that Fomalhaut b's orbit is in the same plane as the debris disk located exterior to it, it orbits [[Fomalhaut]] at a distance of approximately {{convert|115|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}}.

Infrared non-detections suggest that Fomalhaut b cannot be more massive than 2 times [[Jupiter mass|Jupiter's mass]]<ref name=\"Currie\"/><ref name=\"Janson2012\"/> but a lower limit on the mass depends on uncertain details for the nature of Fomalhaut b, its circumplanetary environment, and the existence of other planetary-mass bodies in the system.  Models of Fomalhaut b sculpting the star's debris disk give a mass 0.5 times that of Jupiter.

Here, the former explains most of the 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness and planet thermal emission contributes to much of the 0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness. Their non-detections with ground-based infrared data suggested that Fomalhaut b had to be less massive than about 3 Jupiter masses.\n\nHowever, Fomalhaut b should be detectable in space-based infrared data if its mass is between 1-3 Jupiter masses.  But sensitive infrared Spitzer Space Telescope observations failed to detect Fomalhaut b, implying that Fomalhaut b has less than 1 Jupiter mass.<ref name=\"Janson2012\"/>  Furthermore, although the planet was thought to be a plausible explanation for Fomalhaut's eccentric debris ring, measurements in the Kalas et al. paper hinted that it was moving too fast (i.e. not apsidally aligned) for this explanation to work.  Finally, researchers analyzing September\u2013October 2011 [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA) data for Fomalhaut's debris ring suggested an alternate hypothesis: that the ring could be shaped by much smaller, shepherding planets, neither of which needed to be Fomalhaut b.<ref name=\"Boley2012\">{{Cite journal |title=Constraining the Planetary System of Fomalhaut Using High-resolution ALMA Observations |first=Aaron |last=Boley |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=2012 |arxiv = 1204.0007|bibcode = 2012ApJ...750L..21B |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/750/1/L21 |volume=750 |pages=L21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=36681 |title=ALMA Reveals Workings of Nearby Planetary System |accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref>  These results invoked skepticism about Fomalhaut b's status as an extrasolar planet.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20945-new-doubts-about-poster-child-of-exoplanets.html |author=Lisa Grossman |title=New doubts about 'poster child' of exoplanets |journal=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yudhijit Bhattacharjee |title=Celebrated Exoplanet Vanishes in a Cloud of Dust-Or Maybe Not |journal=Science |page=515 |volume=335 |date=3 February 2012 |bibcode = 2012Sci...335..515B |doi = 10.1126/science.335.6068.515 |issue=6068}}</ref>\n\n==Recovery, independent confirmation by Hubble and further additional findings==\nOn October 24, 2012, a team led by Thayne Currie at the [[University of Toronto]] announced the first independent recovery of Fomalhaut b and revived the claim that Fomalhaut b identifies a planet.<ref name=\"Currie\"/> They reanalyzed the original Hubble data using new, more powerful algorithms for separating planet light from starlight and confirmed that Fomalhaut b does exist. They also provided a new detection of Fomalhaut b at 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m.\nThey modeled the optical detections and infrared upper limits for Fomalhaut b, showing that Fomalhaut b's emission can be completely explained by starlight scattered by small dust and arguing that this dust surrounds an unseen planetary-mass object.   Thus, they consider Fomalhaut b to plausibly be a \"planet identified from direct imaging\" even if Fomalhaut b is not, strictly speaking, a directly imaged planet insofar as the light does not come from a planetary atmosphere.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>\n\nA second paper made public a day later and led by Raphael Galicher and Christian Marois at the [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]] also independently recovered Fomalhaut b and confirmed the new 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m detection, claiming the spectral energy distribution (SED) of Fomalhaut b cannot be explained as due to direct or scattered radiation from a massive planet. They considered two models to explain the SED: (1) a large circumplanetary disk around a massive, but unseen, planet and (2) the aftermath of a collision during the past 100 years of two Kuiper belt objects of radii about 50&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\nSubsequent Hubble data obtained in 2010 and 2012 with the [[STIS]] instrument by [[Paul Kalas]] and collaborators again recovered Fomalhaut b<ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>.   However, analysis of Fomalhaut b's astrometry showed that the object has a high eccentricity (e = 0.8), its orbit (projected on the sky) crosses the plane of Fomalhaut's debris ring, and thus it is unlikely to be the object sculpting the debris ring's sharp inner edge.  Fomalhaut b's high eccentricity may be evidence for a significant dynamical interaction with a hitherto unseen planet at a smaller orbital separation.\n\nThe revival of the claim that Fomalhaut b is (possibly) a planet after it had been discounted led some to nickname the object a \"zombie planet\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/fomalhaut-exo.html|work=NASA |title= New Study Brings a Doubted Exoplanet 'Back from the Dead'|accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> although this is a non-technical term used in press material and does not appear in any peer-reviewed manuscript.\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n\nAssuming that Fomalhaut b's orbit is in the same plane as the debris disk located exterior to it, it orbits [[Fomalhaut]] at a distance of approximately {{convert|115|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}}.

Although the initial discovery paper for Fomalhaut b suggested that its optical brightness may be variable due to [[planetary accretion]], later reanalyses of these data fail to find convincing evidence that Fomalhaut b is indeed variable,<ref name=\"Currie\"/><ref name=\"Galicher\"/> <ref name=\"Kalas2013\"/>thus eliminating evidence for planetary accretion and also for a 'transient' dust cloud.\n\nIn order for Fomalhaut b to be detectable at optical wavelengths, it must have an emitting area much larger than the physical size of a planet,<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/> a fact further strengthening the case that what we see as Fomalhaut b is not light coming from a planetary atmosphere.  A circumplanetary ring system is large enough to scatter enough starlight to make Fomalhaut b visible only if it has a radius between 20 and 40 times that of Jupiter's radius.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/>  A spherical cloud of dust with a radius of {{convert|0.004|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}} can make Fomalhaut b visible.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>  Fomalhaut b appears as an unresolved point source in the highest-quality data (at 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm) which would suggest that its projected emitting area cannot be larger than about 0.25 AU, about 1/4th of the Earth\u2013Sun distance.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/><ref name=\"Currie\"/> However, it may be resolved at slightly longer wavelengths, which would indicate that its emitting area is larger.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\nThe mass of Fomalhaut b, if a planet, is highly uncertain.  Infrared non-detections suggest that Fomalhaut b cannot be more massive than 2 times [[Jupiter mass|Jupiter's mass]]<ref name=\"Currie\"/><ref name=\"Janson2012\"/> but a lower limit on the mass depends on uncertain details for the nature of Fomalhaut b, its circumplanetary environment, and the existence of other planetary-mass bodies in the system.  Models of Fomalhaut b sculpting the star's debris disk give a mass 0.5 times that of Jupiter.

Disturbed's fourth studio album, ''[[Indestructible (Disturbed album)|Indestructible]]'', was released in June 2008. Like its predecessor, it peaked at number one on the US and New Zealand charts; it also reached the top position of the Canadian and Australian charts.<ref name=\"Billboard Albums\" /><ref name=\"australian-charts.com\" /><ref name=\"charts.org.nz\" /> Four singles were released for ''Indestructible'', the [[Indestructible (Disturbed song)|title track]], \"[[Perfect Insanity]]\", \"[[The Night (Disturbed song)|The Night]] and \"[[Inside the Fire (Disturbed song)|Inside the Fire]]\" (which peaked at number-one on the [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Songs]], was certified gold by the RIAA, and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in the category [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]]).<ref name=\"Billboard Singles\" /> The band has released five consecutive number-one albums that have charted on the ''Billboard'' 200, with the release of their fifth studio album ''[[Asylum (Disturbed album)|Asylum]]''.<ref name=\"Asylum beats KP for #1 Album\">{{cite web|url= http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/the-beat-goes-on/posts/does-katy-perry-get-disturbed-on-the-billboard-200|title= Disturbed's Asylum beats Katy Perry for #1 Album|publisher= HitFix|date=2010-09-05 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}</ref> ''Asylum'' was followed five years later by ''[[Immortalized (Disturbed album)|Immortalized]]'' (2015).

{"title_page": "\u00c9vian Conference", "text_new": "{{The Holocaust sidebar}}\n{{Antisemitism}}\nThe '''\u00c9vian Conference''' was convened 6\u201315 July 1938, at [[\u00c9vian-les-Bains]], [[France]], to discuss the [[Jewish refugee]] problem and the plight of the increasing numbers of Jewish refugees fleeing persecution by [[Nazi Germany]]. It was convened at the initiative of United States President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] who perhaps hoped to obtain commitments from some of the invited nations to accept more refugees, although he took pains to avoid stating that objective expressly. Historians have suggested that Roosevelt desired to deflect attention and criticism from American policy that severely limited the quota of Jewish refugees admitted to the United States.<ref name=\"Wells2009\">{{cite book|author=Allen Wells|title=Tropical Zion : General Trujillo, FDR, and the Jews of Sosua|year=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-4407-0|pages=6\u20138}}</ref>\n\nThe conference was attended by representatives from 32 countries, and 24 voluntary organizations also attended as observers, presenting plans either orally or in writing.<ref>\"[http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/timeline/index_34.asp The Holocaust: Timeline: July 6\u201315, 1938: \u00c9vian Conference].\" Yad Vashem.

They were classified as \"subjects\" and became stateless in their own country. By 1938, some 450,000 of about 900,000 German Jews were expelled or fled Germany, mostly to France and [[Mandate Palestine|British Mandate Palestine]], where the massive wave of migrants led to an [[1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab uprising]]. When Hitler [[Anschluss|annexed Austria]] in March 1938, and applied German racial laws, the 200,000 Jews of Austria became stateless.\n\nHitler's expansion was accompanied by a rise in vicious and violent anti-Semitic fascist movements across Europe and the Middle East. Significantly antisemitic governments came to power in [[Hungary in World War II|Hungary]] and [[Romania in World War II|Romania]], where Jews had always been [[History of the Jews in Romania|second class citizens]]. The result was millions of Jews attempting to flee Europe, while they were perceived as an undesirable and socially damaging population with popular academic theories arguing that Jews damaged the \"[[racial hygiene]]\" or \"[[eugenic]]s\" of nations where they were resident and engaged in [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitic conspiracy theories|conspirative behaviour]].\n\nBefore the Conference the United States and Britain made a critical agreement: the British promised not to bring up the fact that the United States was not filling its immigration quotas, and any mention of Palestine as a possible destination for Jewish refugees was excluded from the agenda.<ref>[[Jack Fischel|Fischel, Jack R.]], ''The Holocaust'' (1998), pp. 28\u201329</ref> Britain administered Palestine under the terms of the [[Mandate for Palestine]].\n\n==Proceedings==\nConference delegates expressed sympathy for Jews under Nazism but made no immediate joint resolution or commitment, portraying the conference as a mere beginning, to the frustration of some commentators. Noting \"that the involuntary emigration of people in large numbers has become so great that it renders racial and religious problems more acute, increases international unrest, and may hinder seriously the processes of [[appeasement]] in international relations\", the \u00c9vian Conference established the [[Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees]] (ICR) with the purpose to \"approach the governments of the countries of refuge with a view to developing opportunities for permanent settlement.\" The ICR received little authority or support from its member nations and fell into inaction.\n\nThe United States sent no government official to the conference. Instead Roosevelt's friend, the American businessman [[Myron C. Taylor]], represented the U.S. with [[James Grover McDonald|James G. McDonald]] as his advisor. The U.S. agreed that the German and Austrian immigration quota of 30,000 a year would be made available to Jewish refugees. In the three years 1938 to 1940 the US actually exceeded this quota by 10,000. During the same period Britain accepted almost the same number of German Jews. Australia agreed to take 15,000 over three years, with South Africa taking only those with close relatives already resident; Canada refused to make any commitment and only accepted a few refugees over this period.<ref>Sykes, Christopher (1965) ''Cross Roads to Israel: Palestine from Balfour to Bevin.'' New English Library Edition (pb) 1967. Pages 198, 199.</ref> The Australian delegate T. W. White noted: ''\"as we have no real racial problem, we are not desirous of importing one\"''.<ref>http://www.holocaust.org.au/mm/i_australia.htm</ref> The French delegate stated that France had reached \"the extreme point of saturation as regards admission of refugees\", a sentiment repeated by most other representatives.\n\nThe only countries willing to accept a large number of Jews were the [[Dominican Republic]], which offered to accept up to 100,000 refugees on generous terms, and later Costa Rica.<ref name=Hate/><ref name =crassweller>{{Cite book| author=Crassweller RD|title=Trujillo.

Two months after \u00c9vian, in September 1938, Britain and France granted Hitler the [[Munich Agreement|right to occupy]] the [[Sudetenland]] of [[Czechoslovakia]], which made a further [[History of the Jews in Czechoslovakia|120,000 Jews]] stateless. In November 1938, on [[Kristallnacht]], a massive [[pogrom]] across the [[Third Reich]] was accompanied by the destruction of over 1,000 synagogues, massacres and the arbitrary arrest of tens of thousands of Jews. In March 1939, Hitler occupied the [[Resttschechei|remainder of Czechoslovakia]], which now took in a further 180,000 Jews, while in May 1939 the British issued the [[White Paper of 1939|White Paper]] which barred Jews from entering Palestine or buying land there. Following their [[occupation of Poland]] in late 1939 and [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of Soviet Union]] in 1941, the Germans embarked on a program of systematically killing all Jews in Europe. In this, the Nazis had local assistance in at least some cases. [[Jacques S\u00e9melin|J. S\u00e9melin]] argued that local help was virtually always required to identify and organize the removal of Jews.<ref>{{Citation | last = S\u00e9melin | first = Jacques | author-link = Jacques S\u00e9melin | year = 1993 | title = Unarmed against Hitler:  Civil resistance in Europe, 1939-1943 | publisher = Praeger | pages = 98\u2013104 | isbn = 0-275-93960-X}}</ref>\n\n==Reaction==\n[[File:Children rounded up for deportation.JPG|thumb|Jewish children rounded up for deportation to [[Chelmno extermination camp]]]]\nIn her autobiography ''My Life'' (1975), [[Golda Meir]] described her outrage being in \"the ludicrous capacity of the [Jewish] observer from [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], not even seated with the delegates, although the refugees under discussion were my own people....\" After the conference Meir told the press: \"There is only one thing I hope to see before I die and that is that my people should not need expressions of sympathy anymore.\"<ref>Provizier, Norman, and Claire Wright. \"[https://www.msudenver.edu/golda/goldameir/chronologyofgoldameir/ Golda Meir: An Outline of a Unique Life.

It was convened at the initiative of United States President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] who perhaps hoped to obtain commitments from some of the invited nations to accept more refugees, although he took pains to avoid stating that objective expressly. Historians have suggested that Roosevelt desired to deflect attention and criticism from American policy that severely limited the quota of Jewish refugees admitted to the United States.<ref name=\"Wells2009\">{{cite book|author=Allen Wells|title=Tropical Zion : General Trujillo, FDR, and the Jews of Sosua|year=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-4407-0|pages=6\u20138}}</ref>\n\nThe conference was attended by representatives from 32 countries, and 24 voluntary organizations also attended as observers, presenting plans either orally or in writing.<ref>\"[http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/timeline/index_34.asp The Holocaust: Timeline: July 6\u201315, 1938: \u00c9vian Conference].\" Yad Vashem.

The conference thus inadvertently proved to be a useful propaganda tool for the Nazis.<ref name=Hate>William I. Brustein. (2003). Roots of Hate. [Online]. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

They were classified as \"subjects\" and became stateless in their own country. By 1938, some 450,000 of about 900,000 German Jews were expelled or fled Germany, mostly to France and [[Mandate Palestine|British Mandate Palestine]], where the massive wave of migrants led to an [[1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab uprising]]. When Hitler [[Anschluss|annexed Austria]] in March 1938, and applied German racial laws, the 200,000 Jews of Austria became stateless.\n\nHitler's expansion was accompanied by a rise in vicious and violent anti-Semitic fascist movements across Europe and the Middle East. Significantly antisemitic governments came to power in [[Hungary in World War II|Hungary]] and [[Romania in World War II|Romania]], where Jews had always been [[History of the Jews in Romania|second class citizens]]. The result was millions of Jews attempting to flee Europe, while they were perceived as an undesirable and socially damaging population with popular academic theories arguing that Jews damaged the \"[[racial hygiene]]\" or \"[[eugenic]]s\" of nations where they were resident and engaged in [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitic conspiracy theories|conspirative behaviour]].\n\nBefore the Conference the United States and Britain made a critical agreement: the British promised not to bring up the fact that the United States was not filling its immigration quotas, and any mention of Palestine as a possible destination for Jewish refugees was excluded from the agenda.<ref>[[Jack Fischel|Fischel, Jack R.]], ''The Holocaust'' (1998), pp. 28\u201329</ref> Britain administered Palestine under the terms of the [[Mandate for Palestine]].\n\n==Proceedings==\nConference delegates expressed sympathy for Jews under Nazism but made no immediate joint resolution or commitment, portraying the conference as a mere beginning, to the frustration of some commentators. Noting \"that the involuntary emigration of people in large numbers has become so great that it renders racial and religious problems more acute, increases international unrest, and may hinder seriously the processes of [[appeasement]] in international relations\", the \u00c9vian Conference established the [[Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees]] (ICR) with the purpose to \"approach the governments of the countries of refuge with a view to developing opportunities for permanent settlement.\" The ICR received little authority or support from its member nations and fell into inaction.\n\nThe United States sent no government official to the conference. Instead Roosevelt's friend, the American businessman [[Myron C. Taylor]], represented the U.S. with [[James Grover McDonald|James G. McDonald]] as his advisor. The U.S. agreed that the German and Austrian immigration quota of 30,000 a year would be made available to Jewish refugees. In the three years 1938 to 1940 the US actually exceeded this quota by 10,000. During the same period Britain accepted almost the same number of German Jews. Australia agreed to take 15,000 over three years, with South Africa taking only those with close relatives already resident; Canada refused to make any commitment and only accepted a few refugees over this period.<ref>Sykes, Christopher (1965) ''Cross Roads to Israel: Palestine from Balfour to Bevin.'' New English Library Edition (pb) 1967. Pages 198, 199.</ref> The Australian delegate T. W. White noted: ''\"as we have no real racial problem, we are not desirous of importing one\"''.<ref>http://www.holocaust.org.au/mm/i_australia.htm</ref> The French delegate stated that France had reached \"the extreme point of saturation as regards admission of refugees\", a sentiment repeated by most other representatives.\n\nThe only countries willing to accept a large number of Jews were the [[Dominican Republic]], which offered to accept up to 100,000 refugees on generous terms, and later Costa Rica.<ref name=Hate/><ref name =crassweller>{{Cite book| author=Crassweller RD|title=Trujillo.

Two months after \u00c9vian, in September 1938, Britain and France granted Hitler the [[Munich Agreement|right to occupy]] the [[Sudetenland]] of [[Czechoslovakia]], which made a further [[History of the Jews in Czechoslovakia|120,000 Jews]] stateless. In November 1938, on [[Kristallnacht]], a massive [[pogrom]] across the [[Third Reich]] was accompanied by the destruction of over 1,000 synagogues, massacres and the arbitrary arrest of tens of thousands of Jews. In March 1939, Hitler occupied the [[Resttschechei|remainder of Czechoslovakia]], which now took in a further 180,000 Jews, while in May 1939 the British issued the [[White Paper of 1939|White Paper]] which barred Jews from entering Palestine or buying land there. Following their [[occupation of Poland]] in late 1939 and [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of Soviet Union]] in 1941, the Germans embarked on a program of systematically killing all Jews in Europe. In this, the Nazis had local assistance in at least some cases. [[Jacques S\u00e9melin|J. S\u00e9melin]] argued that local help was virtually always required to identify and organize the removal of Jews.<ref>{{Citation | last = S\u00e9melin | first = Jacques | author-link = Jacques S\u00e9melin | year = 1993 | title = Unarmed against Hitler:  Civil resistance in Europe, 1939-1943 | publisher = Praeger | pages = 98\u2013104 | isbn = 0-275-93960-X}}</ref>\n\n==Reaction==\n[[File:Children rounded up for deportation.JPG|thumb|Jewish children rounded up for deportation to [[Chelmno extermination camp]]]]\nIn her autobiography ''My Life'' (1975), [[Golda Meir]] described her outrage being in \"the ludicrous capacity of the [Jewish] observer from [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], not even seated with the delegates, although the refugees under discussion were my own people....\" After the conference Meir told the press: \"There is only one thing I hope to see before I die and that is that my people should not need expressions of sympathy anymore.\"<ref>Provizier, Norman, and Claire Wright. \"[https://www.msudenver.edu/golda/goldameir/chronologyofgoldameir/ Golda Meir: An Outline of a Unique Life.
