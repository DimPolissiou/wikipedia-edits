First, the change emphasizes the main problem is not a multitude of personalities, but rather a lack of a single, unified identity<ref name = Cardena/> and an emphasis on \"the identities as centers of information processing\".<ref name = Spiegel/>  Second, the term \"personality\" is used to refer to \"characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings, moods and behaviors of the whole individual\", while for a patient with DID, the switches between identities and behavior patterns is the personality.<ref name = Cardena/>  It is for this reason the DSM-IV-TR referred to \"distinct identities or personality states\" instead of personalities.  The diagnostic criteria also changed to indicate that while the patient may name and personalize alters, they lack independent, objective existence.<ref name = Cardena/>  The changes also included the addition of amnesia as a symptom, which was not included in the DSM-III-R because despite being a core symptom of the condition, patients may experience \"amnesia for the amnesia\" and fail to report it.<ref name = Spiegel/>  Amnesia was replaced when it became clear that the risk of [[Type II error|false negative]] diagnoses was low because amnesia was central to DID.<ref name = Cardena/>\n\nThe [[ICD-10]] places the diagnosis in the category of \"dissociative disorders\", within the subcategory of \"other dissociative (conversion) disorders\", but continues to list the condition as multiple personality disorder.<ref name = ICD10/>\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR criteria for DID have been criticized for failing to capture the clinical complexity of DID, lacking usefulness in diagnosing individuals with DID (for instance, by focusing on the two least frequent and most subtle symptoms of DID) producing a high rate of [[Type II error|false negatives]] and an excessive number of DDNOS diagnoses, for excluding [[Spirit possession|possession]] (seen as a cross-cultural form of DID), and for including only two \"core\" symptoms of DID (amnesia and self-alteration) while failing to discuss hallucinations, trance-like states, [[somatoform disorder|somatoform]], [[depersonalization]], and [[derealization]] symptoms.  Arguments have been made for allowing diagnosis through the presence of some, but not all of the characteristics of DID rather than the current exclusive focus on the two least common and noticeable features.<ref name = Spiegel/>  The DSM-IV-TR criteria have also been criticized {{citation needed|date=August 2015}} for being [[tautology (logic)|tautological]], using imprecise and undefined language and for the use of instruments that give a false sense of validity and empirical certainty to the diagnosis.\n\nThe [[DSM-5]] updated the definition of DID in 2013, summarizing the changes as:<ref name=highlights>{{cite web | title = Highlights of Changes from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5 | url=http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Practice/DSM/DSM-5/Changes-from-DSM-IV-TR--to-DSM-5.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917201810/http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Practice/DSM/DSM-5/Changes-from-DSM-IV-TR--to-DSM-5.pdf | archivedate=2013-09-17 | date = 2013-05-17 | publisher = [[American Psychiatric Association]] | accessdate = 2013-09-06}}</ref>\n{{quote|Several changes to the criteria for dissociative identity disorder have been made in DSM-5.

According to Brand, Loewenstein and Spiegel, \"[t]he claims that DID treatment is harmful are based on anecdotal cases, opinion pieces, reports of damage that are not substantiated in the scientific literature, misrepresentations of the data, and misunderstandings about DID treatment and the phenomenology of DID\u201d.

They assert that DID cannot be accurately diagnosed because of vague and unclear diagnostic criteria in the DSM and undefined concepts such as \"personality state\" and \"identities\", and question the evidence for childhood abuse beyond self-reports, the lack of definition of what would indicate a threshold of abuse sufficient to induce DID and the extremely small number of cases of children diagnosed with DID despite an average age of appearance of the first alter of three years.<ref name=\"pmid15560314\"/> Psychiatrist Colin Ross disagrees with Piper and Merskey's conclusion that DID cannot be accurately diagnosed, pointing to internal consistency between different structured dissociative disorder interviews (including the [[Dissociative Experiences Scale]], Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule and Structured Clinical Interview for Dissociative Disorders)<ref name=Kihlstrom/> that are in the internal validity range of widely accepted mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and [[major depressive disorder]].

A more realistic and appropriate goal of treatment is to integrate adaptive responses to abuse, injury or other threats into the overall personality structure.<ref name=Gillig/> There is debate over issues such as whether [[exposure therapy]] (reliving traumatic memories, also known as abreaction), engagement with alters and physical contact during therapy are appropriate and there are clinical opinions both for and against each option with little high-quality evidence for any position.\n\nBrandt et al., noting the lack of empirical studies of treatment effectiveness, conducted a survey of 36 clinicians expert in treating dissociative disorder (DD) who recommended a three-stage treatment. They agreed that skill building in the first stage is important so the patient can learn to handle high risk, potentially dangerous behavior, as well as emotional regulation, interpersonal effectiveness and other practical behaviors. In addition, they recommended \"trauma-based cognitive therapy\" to reduce cognitive distortions related to trauma; they also recommended that the therapist deal with the dissociated identities early in treatment. In the middle stage, they recommended graded exposure techniques, along with appropriate interventions as needed.

Courts must distinguish individuals who mimic symptoms of DID for legal or social reasons. Within jurisprudence, there are three significant problems:<ref name=Rein2008/>\n# Individuals diagnosed with DID may accuse others of abuse, but lack objective evidence and base their accusations solely on regular or recovered memories.\n# There are questions regarding the civil and political rights of alters, particularly which alter can legally represent the person, sign a contract or [[vote]].\n# Finally, individuals diagnosed with DID who are accused of crimes may deny culpability on the grounds that the crime was committed by a different identity-state.\n\nIn cases where [[not guilty by reason of insanity]] (NGRI) is used as a defence in a court, it is normally accompanied by one of three legal approaches\u2014claiming a specific alter was in control when the crime was committed (and if that alter is considered insane), deciding whether all (or which) alters may be insane, or whether only the dominant personality meets the insanity standard.<ref name=Farrell/> NGRI is rarely successful for individuals with DID accused of committing crimes while in a dissociated state.<ref name=Farrell2011>{{cite journal |last=Farrell |first=HM |title=Dissociative identity disorder: No excuse for criminal activity |journal=Current Psychiatry |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=33\u201340 |url=http://www.currentpsychiatry.org/pdf/1006/1006CP_Article3.pdf |year=2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69gTpoEKq?url=http://www.currentpsychiatry.org/pdf/1006/1006CP_Article3.pdf |archivedate=2012-08-05 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThere is no agreement within the legal and mental health fields whether an individual can be [[acquittal|acquitted]] due to a diagnosis of DID. It has been argued that any individual with DID is a single person with a serious mental illness, and therefore exhibits [[diminished responsibility]]; this was first recognized in an American court in 1978, in the ''[[Billy Milligan|State of Ohio v. Milligan]]'' case. However, public reaction to the result of the case involving William S. \"Billy\" Milligan was strongly negative, and since that time the few cases claiming insanity have found either that the altered consciousness found in DID is irrelevant or that the actual diagnosis itself was not [[admissible evidence]].<ref name=Farrell/> The self-reported nature of the symptoms used to reach a diagnosis makes it difficult to determine their credibility, although objective measuring of brain activation and structural patterns are a promising direction for future scientific research into distinguishing malingered from genuine DID in forensic settings.<ref name=Rein2008/> Forensic experts called on to conduct forensic examinations for DID must use a multidisciplinary approach, including multiple

Individuals with this disorder may present with prominent medically unexplained neurological symptoms, such as non-epileptic seizures, paralyses, or sensory loss, in cultural settings where such symptoms are common. Similarly, in settings where normative possession is common (e.g., rural areas in the developing world, among certain religious groups in the United States and Europe), the fragmented identities may take the form of possessing spirits, deities, demons, animals, or mythical figures. Acculturation or prolonged intercultural contact may shape the characteristics of other identities (e.g., identities in India may speak English exclusively and wear Western clothes). Possession-form dissociative identity disorder can be distinguished from culturally accepted possession states in that the former is involuntary, distressing, uncontrollable, and often recurrent or persistent; involves conflict between the individual and his or her surrounding family, social, or work milieu; and is manifested at times and in places that violate the norms of the culture or religion.|sign=|source=}}\n\n=== History in the DSM ===\nThe DSM-II used the term Hysterical Neurosis, Dissociative Type.

The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]] made more changes to DID than any other dissociative disorder,<ref name = Cardena/> and renamed it DID.<ref name=dsm/>  The name was changed for two reasons.  First, the change emphasizes the main problem is not a multitude of personalities, but rather a lack of a single, unified identity<ref name = Cardena/> and an emphasis on \"the identities as centers of information processing\".<ref name = Spiegel/>  Second, the term \"personality\" is used to refer to \"characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings, moods and behaviors of the whole individual\", while for a patient with DID, the switches between identities and behavior patterns is the personality.<ref name = Cardena/>  It is for this reason the DSM-IV-TR referred to \"distinct identities or personality states\" instead of personalities.  The diagnostic criteria also changed to indicate that while the patient may name and personalize alters, they lack independent, objective existence.<ref name = Cardena/>  The changes also included the addition of amnesia as a symptom, which was not included in the DSM-III-R because despite being a core symptom of the condition, patients may experience \"amnesia for the amnesia\" and fail to report it.<ref name = Spiegel/>  Amnesia was replaced when it became clear that the risk of [[Type II error|false negative]] diagnoses was low because amnesia was central to DID.<ref name = Cardena/>\n\nThe [[ICD-10]] places the diagnosis in the category of \"dissociative disorders\", within the subcategory of \"other dissociative (conversion) disorders\", but continues to list the condition as multiple personality disorder.<ref name = ICD10/>\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR criteria for DID have been criticized for failing to capture the clinical complexity of DID, lacking usefulness in diagnosing individuals with DID (for instance, by focusing on the two least frequent and most subtle symptoms of DID) producing a high rate of [[Type II error|false negatives]] and an excessive number of DDNOS diagnoses, for excluding [[Spirit possession|possession]] (seen as a cross-cultural form of DID), and for including only two \"core\" symptoms of DID (amnesia and self-alteration) while failing to discuss hallucinations, trance-like states, [[somatoform disorder|somatoform]], [[depersonalization]], and [[derealization]] symptoms.

They assert that DID cannot be accurately diagnosed because of vague and unclear diagnostic criteria in the DSM and undefined concepts such as \"personality state\" and \"identities\", and question the evidence for childhood abuse beyond self-reports, the lack of definition of what would indicate a threshold of abuse sufficient to induce DID and the extremely small number of cases of children diagnosed with DID despite an average age of appearance of the first alter of three years.<ref name=\"pmid15560314\"/> Psychiatrist Colin Ross disagrees with Piper and Merskey's conclusion that DID cannot be accurately diagnosed, pointing to internal consistency between different structured dissociative disorder interviews (including the [[Dissociative Experiences Scale]], Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule and Structured Clinical Interview for Dissociative Disorders)<ref name=Kihlstrom/> that are in the internal validity range of widely accepted mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and [[major depressive disorder]].

In an effort to distance itself from the increasing skepticism regarding the clinical validity of MPD, the organization dropped \"multiple personality\" from its official name in 1993, and then in 1997 changed its name again to the [[International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation]].\n\nIn 1994, the fourth edition of the DSM replaced the criteria again and changed the name of the condition from \"multiple personality disorder\" to the current \"dissociative identity disorder\" to emphasize the importance of changes to consciousness and identity rather than personality. The inclusion of interpersonality amnesia helped to distinguish DID from [[dissociative disorder not otherwise specified]] (DDNOS), but the condition retains an inherent subjectivity due to difficulty in defining terms such as personality, identity, ego-state and even [[amnesia]].<ref name = Kihlstrom>{{cite journal | author = Kihlstrom JF | title = Dissociative disorders | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 1 | pages = 227\u201353 | year = 2005 | pmid = 17716088 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.1.102803.143925 | issue=1}}</ref>  The [[ICD-10]] still classifies DID as a \"Dissociative [conversion] disorder\" and retains the name \"multiple personality disorder\" with the classification number of F44.81.<ref name = ICD10/> In the [[ICD-11]], the [[World Health Organization]] have classified DID under the name \"dissociative identity disorder\" (coded as 6B64), and some cases formerly diagnosed as DDNOS will be classified as \"partial dissociative identity disorder\" (coded as 6B65).<ref name = ICD11>{{cite web | url = https://icd.who.int/browse11 | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | title = ICD-11 for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics }}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nA 2006 study compared scholarly research and publications on DID and [[dissociative amnesia]] to other mental health conditions, such as [[anorexia nervosa]], [[alcohol abuse]] and [[schizophrenia]] from 1984 to 2003.

Courts must distinguish individuals who mimic symptoms of DID for legal or social reasons. Within jurisprudence, there are three significant problems:<ref name=Rein2008/>\n# Individuals diagnosed with DID may accuse others of abuse, but lack objective evidence and base their accusations solely on regular or recovered memories.\n# There are questions regarding the civil and political rights of alters, particularly which alter can legally represent the person, sign a contract or [[vote]].\n# Finally, individuals diagnosed with DID who are accused of crimes may deny culpability on the grounds that the crime was committed by a different identity-state.\n\nIn cases where [[not guilty by reason of insanity]] (NGRI) is used as a defence in a court, it is normally accompanied by one of three legal approaches\u2014claiming a specific alter was in control when the crime was committed (and if that alter is considered insane), deciding whether all (or which) alters may be insane, or whether only the dominant personality meets the insanity standard.<ref name=Farrell/> NGRI is rarely successful for individuals with DID accused of committing crimes while in a dissociated state.<ref name=Farrell2011>{{cite journal |last=Farrell |first=HM |title=Dissociative identity disorder: No excuse for criminal activity |journal=Current Psychiatry |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=33\u201340 |url=http://www.currentpsychiatry.org/pdf/1006/1006CP_Article3.pdf |year=2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69gTpoEKq?url=http://www.currentpsychiatry.org/pdf/1006/1006CP_Article3.pdf |archivedate=2012-08-05 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThere is no agreement within the legal and mental health fields whether an individual can be [[acquittal|acquitted]] due to a diagnosis of DID. It has been argued that any individual with DID is a single person with a serious mental illness, and therefore exhibits [[diminished responsibility]]; this was first recognized in an American court in 1978, in the ''[[Billy Milligan|State of Ohio v. Milligan]]'' case. However, public reaction to the result of the case involving William S. \"Billy\" Milligan was strongly negative, and since that time the few cases claiming insanity have found either that the altered consciousness found in DID is irrelevant or that the actual diagnosis itself was not [[admissible evidence]].<ref name=Farrell/> The self-reported nature of the symptoms used to reach a diagnosis makes it difficult to determine their credibility, although objective measuring of brain activation and structural patterns are a promising direction for future scientific research into distinguishing malingered from genuine DID in forensic settings.<ref name=Rein2008/> Forensic experts called on to conduct forensic examinations for DID must use a multidisciplinary approach, including multiple screening instruments.<ref name=Farrell/>\n\n== References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Curlie|/Health/Mental_Health/Disorders/Dissociative/Multiple_Personality/}}\n* [http://www.isst-d.org/ International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation]\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      = Comorbid\n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|F|44|8|f|40}}\n| ICD9            = {{ICD9|300.14}}\n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = \n| MedlinePlus     = \n| eMedicineSubj   = article\n| eMedicineTopic  = 916186\n| MeshID          = D009105\n| SNOMED CT       = 31611000\n| ICD10CM         = {{ICD10CM|F44.81}}\n}}\n{{Portal|Psychology|Psychiatry}}\n{{Wiktionary|dissociative identity disorder}}\n{{Commons category|Dissociative identity disorder|dissociative identity disorder}}\n\n{{Mental and behavioral disorders|selected = neurotic}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dissociative Identity Disorder}}\n[[Category:Dissociative disorders]]\n[[Category:Memory disorders]]\n[[Category:Psychiatric diagnosis]]\n[[Category:RTT]]\n", "name_user": "Belowthewings", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u015ear V, Aky\u00fcz G, Dogan O (2007): Prevalence of dissociative disorders among women in the general population.

Not only is real-time RT-PCR now the method of choice for quantification of gene expression, it is also the preferred method of obtaining results from [[Microarray analysis techniques|array analyses]] and gene expressions on a global scale. Currently, there are four different fluorescent DNA probes available for the real-time RT-PCR detection of PCR products: [[SYBR Green]], [[TaqMan]], [[molecular beacon]]s, and [[scorpion probe]]s. All of these probes allow the detection of PCR products by generating a fluorescent signal. While the SYBR Green dye emits its fluorescent signal simply by binding to the double-stranded DNA in solution, the TaqMan probes', molecular beacons' and scorpions' generation of fluorescence depend on [[F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer|F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)]] coupling of the dye molecule and a quencher moiety to the oligonucleotide substrates.<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Holden | first1 = M.

The intensity of the fluorescence increases as the PCR products accumulate. This technique is easy to use since designing of probes is not necessary given lack of specificity of its binding. However, since the dye does not discriminate the double-stranded DNA from the PCR products and those from the primer-dimers, overestimation of the target concentration is a common problem. Where accurate quantification is an absolute necessity, further assay for the validation of results must be performed. Nevertheless, among the real-time RT-PCR product detection methods, SYBR Green is the most economical and easiest to use.<ref name=\"pmid11017702\"/><ref name=\"pmid11227069\"/>\n[[File:Taqman.png|thumb|Taqman probes]]\n; [[TaqMan]] probes: TaqMan probes are oligonucleotides that have a fluorescent probe attached to the 5' end and a quencher to the 3' end. During PCR amplification, these probes will hybridize to the target sequences located in the [[amplicon]] and as polymerase replicates the template with TaqMan bound, it also cleaves the fluorescent probe due to polymerase 5'- nuclease activity. Because the close proximity between the quench molecule and the fluorescent probe normally prevents fluorescence from being detected through FRET, the decoupling results in the increase of intensity of fluorescence proportional to the number of the probe cleavage cycles. Although well-designed TaqMan probes produce accurate real-time RT-PCR results, it is expensive and time-consuming to synthesize when separate probes must be made for each mRNA target analyzed.<ref name=\"pmid11017702\"/><ref name=\"pmid18645596\"/><ref name=\"pmid15613819\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Yang DK, Kweon CH, Kim BH, etal |title=TaqMan reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for the detection of Japanese encephalitis virus |journal=J.

However, whereas the TaqMan fluorescent probes are cleaved during amplification, molecular beacon probes remain intact and rebind to a new target during each reaction cycle. When free in solution, the close proximity of the fluorescent probe and the quencher molecule prevents fluorescence through FRET. However, when molecular beacon probes hybridize to a target, the fluorescent dye and the quencher are separated resulting in the emittance of light upon excitation. As is with the TaqMan probes, molecular beacons are expensive to synthesize and require separate probes for each RNA target.<ref name=\"pmid16060372\"/>\n; [[Scorpion probe]]s: The scorpion probes, like molecular beacons, will not be fluorescent active in an unhybridized state, again, due to the fluorescent probe on the 5' end being quenched by the moiety on the 3' end of an oligonucleotide.

For example, Lin et al. used qRT-PCR to measure expression of Gal genes in yeast cells. First, Lin et al. engineered a mutation of a protein suspected to participate in the regulation of Gal genes. This mutation was hypothesized to selectively abolish Gal expression. To confirm this, gene expression levels of yeast cells containing this mutation were analyzed using qRT-PCR. The researchers were able to conclusively determine that the mutation of this regulatory protein reduced Gal expression.<ref name=\"pmid22308403\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lin L, Chamberlain L, Zhu LJ, Green MR | title = Analysis of Gal4-directed transcription activation using Tra1 mutants selectively defective for interaction with Gal4 | journal = Proc.

Not only is real-time RT-PCR now the method of choice for quantification of gene expression, it is also the preferred method of obtaining results from [[Microarray analysis techniques|array analyses]] and gene expressions on a global scale. Currently, there are four different fluorescent DNA probes available for the real-time RT-PCR detection of PCR products: [[SYBR Green]], [[TaqMan]], [[molecular beacon]]s, and [[scorpion probe]]s. All of these probes allow the detection of PCR products by generating a fluorescent signal. While the SYBR Green dye emits its fluorescent signal simply by binding to the double-stranded DNA in solution, the TaqMan probes', molecular beacons' and scorpions' generation of fluorescence depend on [[F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer|F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)]] coupling of the dye molecule and a quencher moiety to the oligonucleotide substrates.<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Holden | first1 = M.

The intensity of the fluorescence increases as the PCR products accumulate. This technique is easy to use since designing of probes is not necessary given lack of specificity of its binding. However, since the dye does not discriminate the double-stranded DNA from the PCR products and those from the primer-dimers, overestimation of the target concentration is a common problem. Where accurate quantification is an absolute necessity, further assay for the validation of results must be performed. Nevertheless, among the real-time RT-PCR product detection methods, SYBR Green is the most economical and easiest to use.<ref name=\"pmid11017702\"/><ref name=\"pmid11227069\"/>\n[[File:Taqman.png|thumb|Taqman probes]]\n; [[TaqMan]] probes: TaqMan probes are oligonucleotides that have a fluorescent probe attached to the 5' end and a quencher to the 3' end. During PCR amplification, these probes will hybridize to the target sequences located in the [[amplicon]] and as polymerase replicates the template with TaqMan bound, it also cleaves the fluorescent probe due to polymerase 5'- nuclease activity. Because the close proximity between the quench molecule and the fluorescent probe normally prevents fluorescence from being detected through FRET, the decoupling results in the increase of intensity of fluorescence proportional to the number of the probe cleavage cycles. Although well-designed TaqMan probes produce accurate real-time RT-PCR results, it is expensive and time-consuming to synthesize when separate probes must be made for each mRNA target analyzed.<ref name=\"pmid11017702\"/><ref name=\"pmid18645596\"/><ref name=\"pmid15613819\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Yang DK, Kweon CH, Kim BH, etal |title=TaqMan reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for the detection of Japanese encephalitis virus |journal=J.

However, whereas the TaqMan fluorescent probes are cleaved during amplification, molecular beacon probes remain intact and rebind to a new target during each reaction cycle. When free in solution, the close proximity of the fluorescent probe and the quencher molecule prevents fluorescence through FRET. However, when molecular beacon probes hybridize to a target, the fluorescent dye and the quencher are separated resulting in the emittance of light upon excitation. As is with the TaqMan probes, molecular beacons are expensive to synthesize and require separate probes for each RNA target.<ref name=\"pmid16060372\"/>\n; [[Scorpion probe]]s: The scorpion probes, like molecular beacons, will not be fluorescent active in an unhybridized state, again, due to the fluorescent probe on the 5' end being quenched by the moiety on the 3' end of an oligonucleotide.

Use only intact, high quality RNA for the best results. Be sure to use a sequence-specific primer.\n# Select a one-step RT-PCR kit, which should include a mix with reverse transcriptase and the PCR system such as Taq DNA Polymerase and a proofreading polymerase.\n# Obtain all necessary materials, equipment and instruments (kits should include a detailed list of necessary items).\n# Prepare a reaction mix, which will include dNTPs, primers, template RNA, necessary enzymes and a buffer solution.\n# Add the mix to a PCR tube for each reaction. Then add the template RNA.\n# Place PCR tubes in the thermal cycler to begin cycling. The first cycle is reverse transcription to synthesize cDNA. The second cycle is initial denaturation. During this cycle reverse transcriptase is inactivated. The next 40 to 50 cycles are the amplification program, which consists of three steps: (1) denaturation, (2) annealing, (3) elongation.\n# The RT-PCR products can then be analyzed with [[gel electrophoresis]].<ref>{{cite web|title=High Transcript Tools OneStep Kit|url=http://www.biotools.eu/reverse_transcription.html|publisher=Biotools|accessdate=12 December 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520151713/http://www.biotools.eu/reverse_transcription.html|archivedate=20 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Degen|first=Hans-Joachim|title=PCR Applications Manual|year=2006|publisher=Roche Diagnostics|pages=135\u2013137|url=http://www.roche-applied-science.com/publications/print_mat/pcr_application_manual_3rd_edition.pdf|edition=3 |author2=Deufel, Annette |author3=Eisel, Doris |author4=Gr\u00fcnewald-Janho, Stefanie |author5=Keesey, Joe}}</ref>\n\n(PCR Applications Manual and Biotools)\n\n===Two-step RT-PCR===\n\nTwo-step RT-PCR, as the name implies, occurs in two steps.

It also proposes that commercially derived terms like TaqMan probes should not be used but instead referred to as [[hydrolysis probes]]. Additionally, it is proposed that quantification cycle (Cq) be used to describe the PCR cycle used for quantification instead of threshold cycle (Ct), crossing point (Cp), and takeoff point (TOP), which refer to the same value but were coined by different manufacturers of [[Quantitative PCR instrument|real-time instruments]].<ref name=\"urlwww.microarrays.ca\"/>\n\nThe guideline consists of the following elements: 1) experimental design, 2) sample, 3) nucleic acid extraction, 4) reverse transcription, 5) qPCR target information, 6) oligonucleotides, 7) protocol, 8) validation, and 9) data analysis. Specific items within each element carry a label of either E (essential) or D (desirable). Those labelled E are considered critical and indispensable while those labelled D are considered peripheral yet important for best-practices.<ref name=\"Bustin et al\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cas.psu.edu/docs/CASDEPT/VET/jackvh/jvhpcr.html RT-PCR protocols from Penn state University]\n* [http://www.realtimeprimers.org Database of validated PCR primer sets] ([http://www.genengnews.com/bestofweb/list.aspx?iid=93 website critique])\n* [http://www.bio.davidson.edu/Courses/immunology/Flash/RT_PCR.html Animation to illustrate RT-PCR procedure, from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]\n* [http://www.gene-quantification.info/ The Reference in qPCR -- an Academic & Industrial Information Platform]\n\n{{PCR}}\n{{Portal bar|Biology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction}}\n[[Category:Laboratory techniques]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n[[Category:Polymerase chain reaction]]\n[[Category:Biotechnology]]\n\n[[fr:RT-PCR#Apr\u00e8s transcription inverse]]\n", "name_user": "Klbrain", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eStep two:formatting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction"}

{"title_page": "Tyer's Electric Train Tablet", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2015}}\n{{Globalize|date=August 2008}}\n\n'''Tyer's Electric Train Tablet''' system is a form of [[railway signalling]] for [[Single track (rail)|single line]] railways used in several countries; it was first devised in Great Britain by engineer {{Interlanguage link multi|Edward Tyer|lb}} after the [[Thorpe rail accident]] of 1874, which left 21 people dead.{{sfn|Faith|2000|p=44}} It was used in New Zealand for close to 100 years until June 1994.\nThe system used a hard disk called a ''tablet'', a form of [[Token (railway signalling)|token]]. \n\nThe purpose of the system was to use the tablet as a physical guarantee to the traincrew that their train had exclusive right of way on the single line section. Without this they could not proceed beyond the section signal which protected entry to the single line. \n\nWith advances in electrical locking of the [[lever frame]] within the [[signal box]], the tablet instrument also electrically locked the section signal lever. This was marked with a white stripe on the red background.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Tyer's No. 6 Tablet Instrument-1.JPG|thumb|Main view of No. 6 instrument showing the restoring lever and the tablet tray in the \"out\" position]]\n\nAn instrument was placed at each end of the single-track section that they were to control. They were connected together electrically in such a way that operation of one would depend on operations carried out using the other.\n\nThere were various incarnations of instruments developed by Tyer & Co. Below are the more commonly found ones:\n\nThe Tyer's no. 7 tablet instrument consists of a wooden case, on top of which is a metal slide, a switch plunger, a bell plunger and an electric current indicator. On the front is an indicator which may show either of three indications: \"Line Closed\"; \"Train Approaching\" and \"Train on Line\". Below this there is a second slide, which has three positions: fully home, withdrawn half way, and fully withdrawn. The three indications correspond to the three positions of the slide. The case contains several tablets; they are removed from the instrument using the bottom slide, and replaced using the top slide. The instrument was so constructed that if a tablet had been withdrawn from either instrument of a pair, no further tablets could be withdrawn until the withdrawn tablet had been placed either in the other instrument, or in the same instrument from which it had been withdrawn.{{sfn|Vaughan|1984|p=121}}\n\nThe Tyer's no. 6 tablet instrument is cast iron framed that has a movable drawer at the front which issues and receives the tablets. On the left hand side is a lever to reseat the tablet when it is replaced into the magazine. It has wooden side cheeks to access the complicated mechanism and a tombstone shaped wooden case on the top which houses the bell plunger, commutator and the tablet indicators for up and down trains. At the very top was the [[galvanometer]]. The [[British absolute block signalling|signalling bell]] associated with the machine is separate so could be located on the block shelf or wall mounted above the instrument.\n\n===Tablets===\nTablets are in the form of a disc made of metal or fibre (with a gunmetal weight at the top of the magazine), engraved with the names of the stations between which it is valid, and also provided with notches (also called configurations) or other indentations to ensure that it would fit only one pair of instruments. They were often painted in distinctive colours as an additional visual identification in areas where consecutive sections could each be controlled using the same type of instrument. The diameter of the tablets varied between the different patterns of instrument: those for the No 1 were the largest, the smallest were for the No 5 and No 7, whilst the Nos 2,3,4 and 6 all used tablets about {{convert|4.5|in|mm}} in diameter.\n\n==Operation==\n[[File:Tyer's No. 6 Tablet Instrument-11.JPG|thumb|The indicators showing a tablet has been issued for an Up train from this instrument]]\nThe system required each station at the end of each section to be staffed, the staff member would communicate with the staff member at the other end of the section with a bell code to release a tablet.{{sfn|Vaughan|1984|p=121}}\n\nTo release a tablet at station A to send a train to station B:\n* Both machines must be in a closed state\n* Operator at station A sends a bell code to station B asking if line is clear for the train\n* If clear, operator at station B will repeat the bell code to acknowledge\n* Station A operator holds down the bell plunger\n* Station B operator presses his/her switch plunger with one hand, and with the other pulls out the bottom slide half-way; the instrument now shows a \"Train Approaching\" indication\n* Station B operator holds down the bell plunger\n* Station A operator presses his/her switch plunger with one hand, and with the other pulls the bottom slide to its full extent; the instrument now shows a \"Train on Line\" indication and releases a tablet from the lower slide\n* Station A operator hands the tablet to the driver of the train heading to station B\n\nTo close up each machine once the train has arrived at station B from station A:\n* The train driver hands the tablet to station B operator\n* Station B operator draws out the top slide, places the tablet in it, and closes the top and then the bottom slide; the instrument now shows a \"Line Closed\" indication\n* Station B operator sends a bell code to station A (denoting \"Train out of Section\"), holding the plunger down on the last stroke\n* Station A operator holds down his switch plunger, and closes the bottom slide; the instrument now shows a \"Line Closed\" indication\n* Both machines are now in closed states ready for the process to start again for another train\n\nThe original Tyer's No. 1 instrument was a non-restoring design, as were the subsequent Nos 2 and 3 types. Once the tablet had been removed, it had to travel through the single line section and be replaced in its companion instrument to release the section again. This meant that should a train failure occur in the single line section or a shunt beyond station limits, the tablet ''had'' to travel to the receiving instrument by foot or horse. However, there was a way in which a shunt could be performed without removing the tablet. This was achieved by a very similar means of the [[staff and ticket]] working system.\n\nThe later No 6 model however was a restoring design, which enabled the tablet to be placed back into the issuing instrument for shunting out of station limits. This increased flexibility and did not compromise safety. It also dispensed with the written authority in the staff and ticket system. Many No 1 instruments were modified with No 6 components to make them capable of restoring also.\n\n==Areas of use==\nThe [[Great Western Railway]] used the Tyer's No. 7 electric train tablet instrument at several locations, including the [[Brize Norton and Bampton railway station|Bampton]] to {{Stnlnk|Witney}} section.{{sfn|Vaughan|1984|p=102}}\n\n[[Sri Lanka Railways]] is currently using this system at several locations, including the Kelani Valley line between Maradana and Avissawella in the Colombo District.\n\nThe Tyer's No. 6 tablet instrument was far more widespread in the UK and was adopted by most railway companies on single line installations.

Without this they could not proceed beyond the section signal which protected entry to the single line. \n\nWith advances in electrical locking of the [[lever frame]] within the [[signal box]], the tablet instrument also electrically locked the section signal lever. This was marked with a white stripe on the red background.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Tyer's No. 6 Tablet Instrument-1.JPG|thumb|Main view of No. 6 instrument showing the restoring lever and the tablet tray in the \"out\" position]]\n\nAn instrument was placed at each end of the single-track section that they were to control. They were connected together electrically in such a way that operation of one would depend on operations carried out using the other.\n\nThere were various incarnations of instruments developed by Tyer & Co. Below are the more commonly found ones:\n\nThe Tyer's no. 7 tablet instrument consists of a wooden case, on top of which is a metal slide, a switch plunger, a bell plunger and an electric current indicator. On the front is an indicator which may show either of three indications: \"Line Closed\"; \"Train Approaching\" and \"Train on Line\". Below this there is a second slide, which has three positions: fully home, withdrawn half way, and fully withdrawn. The three indications correspond to the three positions of the slide. The case contains several tablets; they are removed from the instrument using the bottom slide, and replaced using the top slide. The instrument was so constructed that if a tablet had been withdrawn from either instrument of a pair, no further tablets could be withdrawn until the withdrawn tablet had been placed either in the other instrument, or in the same instrument from which it had been withdrawn.{{sfn|Vaughan|1984|p=121}}\n\nThe Tyer's no. 6 tablet instrument is cast iron framed that has a movable drawer at the front which issues and receives the tablets. On the left hand side is a lever to reseat the tablet when it is replaced into the magazine. It has wooden side cheeks to access the complicated mechanism and a tombstone shaped wooden case on the top which houses the bell plunger, commutator and the tablet indicators for up and down trains. At the very top was the [[galvanometer]]. The [[British absolute block signalling|signalling bell]] associated with the machine is separate so could be located on the block shelf or wall mounted above the instrument.\n\n===Tablets===\nTablets are in the form of a disc made of metal or fibre (with a gunmetal weight at the top of the magazine), engraved with the names of the stations between which it is valid, and also provided with notches (also called configurations) or other indentations to ensure that it would fit only one pair of instruments. They were often painted in distinctive colours as an additional visual identification in areas where consecutive sections could each be controlled using the same type of instrument. The diameter of the tablets varied between the different patterns of instrument: those for the No 1 were the largest, the smallest were for the No 5 and No 7, whilst the Nos 2,3,4 and 6 all used tablets about {{convert|4.5|in|mm}} in diameter.\n\n==Operation==\n[[File:Tyer's No. 6 Tablet Instrument-11.JPG|thumb|The indicators showing a tablet has been issued for an Up train from this instrument]]\nThe system required each station at the end of each section to be staffed, the staff member would communicate with the staff member at the other end of the section with a bell code to release a tablet.{{sfn|Vaughan|1984|p=121}}\n\nTo release a tablet at station A to send a train to station B:\n* Both machines must be in a closed state\n* Operator at station A sends a bell code to station B asking if line is clear for the train\n* If clear, operator at station B will repeat the bell code to acknowledge\n* Station A operator holds down the bell plunger\n* Station B operator presses his/her switch plunger with one hand, and with the other pulls out the bottom slide half-way; the instrument now shows a \"Train Approaching\" indication\n* Station B operator holds down the bell plunger\n* Station A operator presses his/her switch plunger with one hand, and with the other pulls the bottom slide to its full extent; the instrument now shows a \"Train on Line\" indication and releases a tablet from the lower slide\n* Station A operator hands the tablet to the driver of the train heading to station B\n\nTo close up each machine once the train has arrived at station B from station A:\n* The train driver hands the tablet to station B operator\n* Station B operator draws out the top slide, places the tablet in it, and closes the top and then the bottom slide; the instrument now shows a \"Line Closed\" indication\n* Station B operator sends a bell code to station A (denoting \"Train out of Section\"), holding the plunger down on the last stroke\n* Station A operator holds down his switch plunger, and closes the bottom slide; the instrument now shows a \"Line Closed\" indication\n* Both machines are now in closed states ready for the process to start again for another train\n\nThe original Tyer's No. 1 instrument was a non-restoring design, as were the subsequent Nos 2 and 3 types. Once the tablet had been removed, it had to travel through the single line section and be replaced in its companion instrument to release the section again. This meant that should a train failure occur in the single line section or a shunt beyond station limits, the tablet ''had'' to travel to the receiving instrument by foot or horse. However, there was a way in which a shunt could be performed without removing the tablet. This was achieved by a very similar means of the [[staff and ticket]] working system.\n\nThe later No 6 model however was a restoring design, which enabled the tablet to be placed back into the issuing instrument for shunting out of station limits. This increased flexibility and did not compromise safety. It also dispensed with the written authority in the staff and ticket system. Many No 1 instruments were modified with No 6 components to make them capable of restoring also.\n\n==Areas of use==\nThe [[Great Western Railway]] used the Tyer's No. 7 electric train tablet instrument at several locations, including the [[Brize Norton and Bampton railway station|Bampton]] to {{Stnlnk|Witney}} section.{{sfn|Vaughan|1984|p=102}}\n\n[[Sri Lanka Railways]] is currently using this system at several locations, including the Kelani Valley line between Maradana and Avissawella in the Colombo District.\n\nThe Tyer's No. 6 tablet instrument was far more widespread in the UK and was adopted by most railway companies on single line installations. However, when the Tyer's No. 9 key token instrument was patented 40 years later in 1912, it began to replace the No. 6 due to it being compact, easier to use and had far fewer moving parts to service and repair.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nOn Britain's national network the use of Tyer's system is now almost extinct, with most lengthy single track lines having been converted to more modern systems such as [[Signalling block system|Tokenless Block]] or [[Radio Electronic Token Block]].
