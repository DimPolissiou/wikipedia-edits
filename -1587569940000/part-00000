The electorate first existed from 1871 to 1963, and then from 1969 to 1996 when [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] was introduced.  The current electorate was re-established for the {{NZ election link|2008}} and has been represented by [[Tim van de Molen]] for the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] since the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]].\n\n==Population centres==\nThrough an amendment in the Electoral Act in 1965, the number of electorates in the [[South Island]] was fixed at 25, an increase of one since the 1962 electoral redistribution.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=108, 111, 112}} It was accepted that through the more rapid population growth in the [[North Island]], the number of its electorates would continue to increase, and to keep proportionality, three new electorates were allowed for in the 1967 electoral redistribution for the next election.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|p=111}} In the North Island, five electorates were newly created and one electorate was reconstituted (Waikato) while three electorates were abolished.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=107, 111}} In the South Island, three electorates were newly created and one electorate was reconstituted while three electorates were abolished.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=108, 112}} The overall effect of the required changes was highly disruptive to existing electorates, with all but three electorates having their boundaries altered.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=111f}} These changes came into effect with the {{NZ election link|1969}}.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|p=111}}\n\nThe electorate was recreated after the 2006 census, as the successor to the former {{NZ electorate link|Piako}} electorate. Piako has been pulled north to account for changes both in [[Auckland]] (where population growth has pulled the boundary of [[Port Waikato (New Zealand electorate)|Port Waikato]] around the [[Waikato River]]), and in the central North Island, where several electorates went into the boundary review under quota, forcing their boundaries further north. It has lost the towns of [[Te Aroha]] to [[Coromandel (New Zealand electorate)|Coromandel]] and [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]] to [[Taup\u014d (New Zealand electorate)|Taup\u014d]], and in exchange gained the rural and semi-urban areas around [[Hamilton East (New Zealand electorate)|Hamilton East]], and [[Huntly, New Zealand|Huntly]], [[Te Kauwhata]] and [[Meremere]] from Port Waikato. It was significantly altered at the 2020 redistribution, losing its entire northwestern section to the recreated {{NZ electorate link|Port Waikato}} electorate, but gaining a large area around [[Te Aroha]] from {{NZ electorate link|Coromandel}} and gaining smaller populations from {{NZ electorate link|Hamilton West}} around [[Horotiu]] and {{NZ electorate link|Taup\u014d}} around [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]], [[Put\u0101ruru]] and [[T\u012brau]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vote.nz/assets/Boundary-Review/REPORT-OF-THE-REPRESENTATION-COMMISSION-2020.pdf |title=Report of the Representation Commission 2020 |date=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Waikato electorate was first contested in the {{NZ election link|1871}}.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=165}} [[James McPherson (New Zealand politician)|James McPherson]] was elected, but he resigned again on 20 December 1871.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=124}} [[William Jackson (New Zealand politician)|William Jackson]] won the resulting {{By-election link|Waikato|1872}} (held on 1 March).

At the next election in {{NZ election link year|1896}}, Cadman successfully contested the {{NZ electorate link|Ohinemuri}} electorate.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=99}} The Waikato electorate was won by [[Frederic Lang]] in 1896, who represented the electorate until his defeat by the Liberal Party's [[Henry Greenslade]] in the {{NZ election link|1905}}.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=119}} Greenslade held the electorate until [[1911 New Zealand general election|1911]],{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=109}} when he was defeated by the [[Reform Party (New Zealand)|Reform]] candidate [[Alexander Young (New Zealand politician)|Alexander Young]].{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=149}}\n\nYoung won the subsequent elections in {{NZ election link year|1914}} and {{NZ election link year|1919}}.

Goosman also won the {{NZ election link|1943}}, but successfully contested the {{NZ election link|1946}} in the newly formed {{NZ electorate link|Piako}} electorate.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=109}}\n\nGoosman was succeeded in Waikato by National's [[Geoffrey Sim]] in 1946.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=139}} Sim held the electorate until it was abolished in 1963, when he contested Piako instead.{{sfn|Wilson|1985}}\n\nThe Waikato electorate was re-established in [[1969 New Zealand general election|1969]]. The first representative was National's [[Lance Adams-Schneider]], who had previously represented the Hamilton electorate. Adams-Schneider retired from Parliament in 1981 and became Ambassador of New Zealand to the [[List of ambassadors of New Zealand to the United States|United States]] in the following year.{{sfn|Wilson|1985}}  Adams-Schneider was succeeded by National's [[Simon Upton]], who won the {{NZ election link|1981}} and started his long parliamentary career with one term in Waikato. Upton contested the {{NZ electorate link|Raglan}} in the {{NZ election link|1984}} and was succeeded by National's [[Rob Storey]] in Waikato. Storey held the electorate until it was abolished with the introduction of [[Mixed-member proportional representation|Mixed-member proportional]] voting in [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996]]. It was re-established for the 2008 election.\n\n[[Lindsay Tisch]] was the MP for Piako from its re-establishment in [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002]], and became the MP for Waikato at the {{NZ election link|2008}}.<ref name=\"2008 Waikato\" /> Tisch was confirmed in the {{NZ election link|2011}}.<ref name=\"2011 Waikato\" />\n\nIn June 2016, Tisch announced that he would not stand at the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/81167337/mp-lindsay-tisch-not-to-seek-reelection|accessdate=27 September 2017|title=MP Lindsay Tisch not to seek re-election|date=20 June 2016|publisher=Stuff.co.nz}}</ref> and the seat was won by Tim van de Molen, retaining it for the National Party.\n\nIn the 20th century Waikato was a safe [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] seat;

The electorate first existed from 1871 to 1963, and then from 1969 to 1996 when [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] was introduced.  The current electorate was re-established for the {{NZ election link|2008}} and has been represented by [[Tim van de Molen]] for the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] since the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]].\n\n==Population centres==\nThrough an amendment in the Electoral Act in 1965, the number of electorates in the [[South Island]] was fixed at 25, an increase of one since the 1962 electoral redistribution.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=108, 111, 112}} It was accepted that through the more rapid population growth in the [[North Island]], the number of its electorates would continue to increase, and to keep proportionality, three new electorates were allowed for in the 1967 electoral redistribution for the next election.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|p=111}} In the North Island, five electorates were newly created and one electorate was reconstituted (Waikato) while three electorates were abolished.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=107, 111}} In the South Island, three electorates were newly created and one electorate was reconstituted while three electorates were abolished.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=108, 112}} The overall effect of the required changes was highly disruptive to existing electorates, with all but three electorates having their boundaries altered.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=111f}} These changes came into effect with the {{NZ election link|1969}}.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|p=111}}\n\nThe electorate was recreated after the 2006 census, as the successor to the former {{NZ electorate link|Piako}} electorate. Piako has been pulled north to account for changes both in [[Auckland]] (where population growth has pulled the boundary of [[Port Waikato (New Zealand electorate)|Port Waikato]] around the [[Waikato River]]), and in the central North Island, where several electorates went into the boundary review under quota, forcing their boundaries further north. It has lost the towns of [[Te Aroha]] to [[Coromandel (New Zealand electorate)|Coromandel]] and [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]] to [[Taup\u014d (New Zealand electorate)|Taup\u014d]], and in exchange gained the rural and semi-urban areas around [[Hamilton East (New Zealand electorate)|Hamilton East]], and [[Huntly, New Zealand|Huntly]], [[Te Kauwhata]] and [[Meremere]] from Port Waikato. It was significantly altered at the 2020 redistribution, losing its entire northwestern section to the recreated {{NZ electorate link|Port Waikato}} electorate, but gaining a large area around [[Te Aroha]] from {{NZ electorate link|Coromandel}} and gaining smaller populations from {{NZ electorate link|Hamilton West}} around [[Horotiu]] and {{NZ electorate link|Taup\u014d}} around [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]], [[Put\u0101ruru]] and [[T\u012brau]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vote.nz/assets/Boundary-Review/REPORT-OF-THE-REPRESENTATION-COMMISSION-2020.pdf |title=Report of the Representation Commission 2020 |date=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Waikato electorate was first contested in the {{NZ election link|1871}}.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=165}} [[James McPherson (New Zealand politician)|James McPherson]] was elected, but he resigned again on 20 December 1871.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=124}} [[William Jackson (New Zealand politician)|William Jackson]] won the resulting {{By-election link|Waikato|1872}} (held on 1 March).

Originally a [[gospel music|gospel]] group, The Oak Ridge Boys switched its focus to [[country music]] in the mid-1970s, releasing a string of hit albums and singles that lasted into the early 1990s. Their [[discography]] comprises thirty-one [[studio album]]s and fifty-six [[single (music)|single]]s. Their highest-selling album is 1981's ''[[Fancy Free (The Oak Ridge Boys album)|Fancy Free]]'', which is certified double-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\nOf The Oak Ridge Boys' singles, seventeen reached Number One on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country singles charts. Two of these songs, \"Elvira\" and \"Bobbie Sue\", were also Top 40 pop and Adult Contemporary hits, and the former is certified platinum as a single. Four additional singles (\"Sail Away\", \"Dream On\", \"Heart of Mine\", and \"Fancy Free\") also entered the AC charts, while \"[[So Fine (Johnny Otis song)|So Fine]]\" and \"American Made\" both made the 70s on the pop charts.\n\n==Studio albums==\n\n===1950s===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''The Oak Ridge Quartet''\n| \n* Release date: 1958\n* Label: [[Cadence Records]]\n* Formats: [[LP record|LP]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Sing and Shout''\n|\n* Release date: 1959\n* Label: Skylite Records\n* Formats: LP\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''The Oak Ridge Quartet''\n|\n* Release date: 1959\n* Label: [[Checker Records]]\n* Formats: LP\n|-\n|}\n\n===1960s===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Master Showman of Song''\n|\n* Release date: 1960\n* Label: [[Starday Records]]\n* Formats: LP\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Go Out to the Program''\n|\n* Release date: 1960\n* Label: Skylite\n* Formats: LP\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''You'll Never Walk Alone''\n|\n* Release date: 1961\n* Label: Skylite\n* Formats: LP\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''He Whispers Sweet Peace to Me''\n|\n* Release date: 1962\n* Label: Skylite\n* Formats: LP\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''With Sounds of Nashville''\n|\n* Release date: 1962\n* Label: [[Warner Bros.

He remained in Baltimore for about seven months up until his death in November 1978, at the age of 83.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== The Frank B. Walsh Neuro-Ophthalmalogy Society ===\nIn 1958, Frank Walsh and [[Richard Lindenberg]] started collaborating with the goal of forming a society where neuro-ophthalmologists could meet and discuss new ideas and facts. In 1966, Joel Sacks joined Walsh and Lindenberg, and the trio hosted their first meeting in 1969. The first three meetings, which they named the Neuro-Ophthalmic Pathology Symposium, included case presentations, clinical conferences, and discussion with local and visiting experts. These first meetings were small, but they were the first time that neuro-ophthalmologists from North America were able to meet as a group and collaborate. Over the years the society continued to grow, and it allowed experts to exchange information. As one member said, \"at the Walsh Society we saw and heard the cutting edge of neuro-ophthalmology, one or two years before it made the literature.\" After Walsh\u2019s death in 1978, the group was renamed as the Frank B. Walsh Neuro-Ophthalmology Society.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Knox|first=DL|date=December 1993|title=The History of the Frank B. Walsh Society|url=|journal=Journal of Clinical Neuro-ophthalmology|volume=13:4|pages=281\u2013287}}</ref>\n\nFor its first 23 years, the society had no formal organization, constitution, bylaws, dues, board of directors, or membership. Rather, it existed as a forum where experts of neurology and ophthalmology could casually collaborate and share experiences and findings. Even after 1990 when the society elected its first board of directors, was formally recognized as a not-for-profit entity by the state of Maryland, drafted a constitution and bylaws, and had a formal member list, the group saw themselves as a \"happy family\" rather than professionals meeting in a work environment. Some meetings were even described as \"raucous,\" with presentations being full of puns and clinical events so bizarre that the audience had no choice but to laugh.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1992, the Walsh Society became a subgroup of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society. The integration of the Walsh Society into a larger, more official society, in addition to the creation of a board of directors, constitution, and formal membership, drew criticism from several members. Some believed that the movement to make the society more formal and organized turned a purely academic environment into one diluted by political and economic issues. The society still meets to this day on an annual basis.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Impact on Neuro-Ophthalmology ===\nIn the words of a modern neuro-ophthalmologist, \"Dr. Walsh developed a body of knowledge, recorded that knowledge, and shared it in an organized and systematic fashion which has not been improved upon, even to this day.\" <ref name=\":1\" /> In 2005, the sixth edition of ''Clinical Neuro-Ophthalmology'' was published as ''Walsh and Hoyt's Clinical Neuro-Ophthalmology'' in 3 volumes edited by [[Neil R.

Walsh discovered several symptoms that could be used as diagnostic tools, such as an obliquely direct axis of the vertical disk.\n\nIn another one of his most cited articles, Walsh discussed whether [[oral contraceptives]] affected or complicated the parts of a patient's brain related to the eyes. Walsh came to the conclusion that, while birth control pills may cause hazards to visions in some extreme cases due to blood clotting, they did not normally cause problems with vision.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=WALSH|first=F.

A team at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins]] diagnosed Walsh with oat cell carcinoma, which filled half of his lungs. He remained in Baltimore for about seven months up until his death in November 1978, at the age of 83.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== The Frank B. Walsh Neuro-Ophthalmalogy Society ===\nIn 1958, Frank Walsh and [[Richard Lindenberg]] started collaborating with the goal of forming a society where neuro-ophthalmologists could meet and discuss new ideas and facts. In 1966, Joel Sacks joined Walsh and Lindenberg, and the trio hosted their first meeting in 1969. The first three meetings, which they named the Neuro-Ophthalmic Pathology Symposium, included case presentations, clinical conferences, and discussion with local and visiting experts. These first meetings were small, but they were the first time that neuro-ophthalmologists from North America were able to meet as a group and collaborate. Over the years the society continued to grow, and it allowed experts to exchange information. As one member said, \"at the Walsh Society we saw and heard the cutting edge of neuro-ophthalmology, one or two years before it made the literature.\" After Walsh\u2019s death in 1978, the group was renamed as the Frank B. Walsh Neuro-Ophthalmology Society.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Knox|first=DL|date=December 1993|title=The History of the Frank B. Walsh Society|url=|journal=Journal of Clinical Neuro-ophthalmology|volume=13:4|pages=281\u2013287}}</ref>\n\nFor its first 23 years, the society had no formal organization, constitution, bylaws, dues, board of directors, or membership. Rather, it existed as a forum where experts of neurology and ophthalmology could casually collaborate and share experiences and findings. Even after 1990 when the society elected its first board of directors, was formally recognized as a not-for-profit entity by the state of Maryland, drafted a constitution and bylaws, and had a formal member list, the group saw themselves as a \"happy family\" rather than professionals meeting in a work environment. Some meetings were even described as \"raucous,\" with presentations being full of puns and clinical events so bizarre that the audience had no choice but to laugh.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1992, the Walsh Society became a subgroup of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society. The integration of the Walsh Society into a larger, more official society, in addition to the creation of a board of directors, constitution, and formal membership, drew criticism from several members. Some believed that the movement to make the society more formal and organized turned a purely academic environment into one diluted by political and economic issues. The society still meets to this day on an annual basis.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Impact on Neuro-Ophthalmology ===\nIn the words of a modern neuro-ophthalmologist, \"Dr. Walsh developed a body of knowledge, recorded that knowledge, and shared it in an organized and systematic fashion which has not been improved upon, even to this day.\" <ref name=\":1\" /> In 2005, the sixth edition of ''Clinical Neuro-Ophthalmology'' was published as ''Walsh and Hoyt's Clinical Neuro-Ophthalmology'' in 3 volumes edited by [[Neil R. Miller]] and Nancy J. Newman.<ref name=\":5\">[http://www.eyecenter.emory.edu/faculty/newman.htm Nancy J. Newman, MD - Emory Eye Center - Emory University]</ref>\n\nAfter his death in 1978, the Wilmer Eye Institute established the Frank B. Walsh Chair of Neuro-ophthalmology, the first such chair in the world.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWalsh is considered by many to be the father of neuro-ophthalmology, as he both pioneered and promoted the field.<ref name=\"Udvarhelyi 93\u201395\" />\n\n=== Postmortem honors ===\nIn 2000, Frank B.

It covers an area of {{convert|29274|km2}} of rugged and sparsely populated terrain. Its capital and largest city is [[Lhasa]], with around 300,000 residents, which mostly corresponds with the administrative Chengguan District, while its suburbs extend into [[Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District]] and [[Dagz\u00ea District]]. The consolidated prefecture-level city contains additional five, mostly rural, counties.\n\nThe city boundaries roughly correspond to the basin of the [[Lhasa River]], a major tributary of the [[Yarlung Tsangpo|Yarlung Tsangpo River]]. It lies on the [[Lhasa terrane]], the last unit of crust to accrete to the Eurasian plate before the continent of India collided with Asia about 50 million years ago and pushed up the [[Himalayas]]. The terrane is high, contains a complex pattern of faults and is tectonically active. The temperature is generally warm in summer and rises above freezing on sunny days in winter. Most of the rain falls in summer. The upland areas and northern grasslands are used for grazing yaks, sheep and goats, while the river valleys support agriculture with crops such as barley, wheat and vegetables. Wildlife is not abundant, but includes the rare [[snow leopard]] and [[black-necked crane]]. Mining has caused some environmental problems.\n\nThe 2000 census gave a total population of 474,490, of whom 387,124 were ethnic Tibetans. The Han Chinese population at the time was mainly concentrated in urban areas. The prefecture-level city is traversed by two major highways and by the [[Qinghai\u2013Tibet railway]], which terminates in the city of Lhasa. Two large dams on the Lhasa River deliver hydroelectric power, as do many smaller dams and the [[Yangbajain Geothermal Station|Yangbajain Geothermal Field]]. The population is well-served by primary schools and basic medical facilities, although more advanced facilities are lacking. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and monastic life have been dominant aspects of the local culture since the 7th century. Most of the monasteries were destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]], but since then many have been restored and serve as tourist attractions.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location===\nLhasa lies in south-central Tibet, to the north of the Himalayas.\nThe prefecture-level city is {{convert|277|km}} from east to west and {{convert|202|km}} from north to south.

It is at the same level as a prefecture for administrative purposes. It contains the [[Lhasa|Chengguan District]], [[Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District]], [[Dagz\u00ea District]], and other rural areas.{{sfn|Barnett|1996|p=82}}}} ({{zh|s=\u62c9\u8428\u5e02|t=\u62c9\u85a9\u5e02|p=L\u0101s\u00e0 Sh\u00ec}}) is a [[prefecture-level city]], one of the main administrative divisions of the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of [[China]]. It covers an area of {{convert|29274|km2}} of rugged and sparsely populated terrain. Its capital and largest city is [[Lhasa]], with around 300,000 residents, which mostly corresponds with the administrative Chengguan District, while its suburbs extend into [[Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District]] and [[Dagz\u00ea District]]. The consolidated prefecture-level city contains additional five, mostly rural, counties.\n\nThe city boundaries roughly correspond to the basin of the [[Lhasa River]], a major tributary of the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River]]. It lies on the [[Lhasa terrane]], the last unit of crust to accrete to the Eurasian plate before the continent of India collided with Asia about 50 million years ago and pushed up the [[Himalayas]]. The terrane is high, contains a complex pattern of faults and is tectonically active. The temperature is generally warm in summer and rises above freezing on sunny days in winter. Most of the rain falls in summer. The upland areas and northern grasslands are used for grazing yaks, sheep and goats, while the river valleys support agriculture with crops such as barley, wheat and vegetables. Wildlife is not abundant, but includes the rare [[snow leopard]] and [[black-necked crane]]. Mining has caused some environmental problems.\n\nThe 2000 census gave a total population of 474,490, of whom 387,124 were ethnic Tibetans. The Han Chinese population at the time was mainly concentrated in urban areas. The prefecture-level city is traversed by two major highways and by the [[Qinghai\u2013Tibet railway]], which terminates in the city of Lhasa. Two large dams on the Lhasa River deliver hydroelectric power, as do many smaller dams and the [[Yangbajain Geothermal Station|Yangbajain Geothermal Field]]. The population is well-served by primary schools and basic medical facilities, although more advanced facilities are lacking. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and monastic life have been dominant aspects of the local culture since the 7th century. Most of the monasteries were destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]], but since then many have been restored and serve as tourist attractions.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location===\nLhasa lies in south-central Tibet, to the north of the Himalayas.\nThe prefecture-level city is {{convert|277|km}} from east to west and {{convert|202|km}} from north to south. It covers an area of {{convert|29518|km2}}.{{sfn|Lhasa, Baidu Baike}}\nIt is bordered by [[Nagqu]] City to the north, [[Nyingchi]] City to the east, [[Shannan, Tibet|Shannan]]/Lhoka City to the south and [[Shigatse|Xigaz\u00ea]] City to the west.{{sfn|Tibet Maps, ChinaTourGuide}}\nThe prefecture-level city roughly corresponds to the basin of the [[Lhasa River]], which is the center of Tibet politically, economically and culturally.{{sfn|Shen|1995|p=151}} Chengguan District is also the center of Tibet in terms of transport, communications, education and religion, as well as being the most developed part of Tibet and a major tourist destination with sights such as the [[Potala Palace]], [[Jokhang]] and [[Ramoche Temple]].{{sfn|Chengguan District of Lhasa, Baidu Baike}}\n\n===Lhasa River basin===\n[[File:Tibet-6080 (2695594944).jpg|thumb|[[Lhasa River]] to the south of [[Lhasa]]]]\n\nLhasa prefecture-level city roughly corresponds to the basin of the [[Lhasa River]], a major tributary of the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River]]. Exceptions are the north of [[Damxung County]], which crosses the watershed of the [[Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains]] and includes part of the [[Namtso]] lake,{{sfn|Damxung, Baidu Baike}}{{efn|Namtso lake is the second-largest salt lake in China.

It stars [[Prithviraj Sukumaran|Prithviraj]], [[Padmapriya Janakiraman|Padmapriya]] and [[Nithin Sathya]] in the lead roles whilst [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]], [[Suhasini Mani Ratnam|Suhasini]], [[Premji Amaren|Premji]] and [[Raaghav]] play cameo roles. The film, which is based on a true incident, has music scored by [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]], which received rave reviews. The film was released on 14 September 2007 to positive reviews. The film was simultaneously dubbed in [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] as ''Kelkaatha Shabdam''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story revolves around Bhanumathy ([[Padmapriya]]) who marries Rathnavel Kalidas ([[Nithin Sathya]]), a man who works in railways as a [[hockey]] player. He married Bhanu by hiding the facts that he is [[impotent]] and a recovering [[alcoholism|alcoholic]]. Soon, the relationship turns sour when the couple realizes that Rathnavel is impotent after a [[gynecology|gynecologist]] ([[Suhasini]]) tells them so. In spite of family pressures to get a mutual [[divorce]], the old-fashioned Bhanu decides to go ahead with the marriage by adopting a child. With the baby's arrival, Rathnavel unfortunately becomes more insecure and tells Bhanu that the child reminds him about his weakness. Unfortunately, all hell breaks loose when Bhanu realizes that her husband was an alcoholic who knew about his impotency and had betrayed her. Rathnavel, in his anger, beats up Bhanu until she is almost unconscious. A few days later, she files for a [[divorce]] and stays with her parents for some days. Bhanu later meets Ravichandran ([[Prithviraj Sukumaran|Prithviraj]]), a happy-go-lucky guy who is a friend of her brother ([[Raaghav]]). Ravi proposes to Bhanu, and they later get married, but Rathnavel, who had vowed to make life miserable for Bhanu, returns. He kidnaps Bhanu and places a [[cadaver]] in her home before faking an accident with a [[cooking gas]] [[gas cylinder|cylinder]], leading Ravi and his family to believe that Bhanu died in a kitchen accident. After that, Rathnavel brings Bhanu to his [[bungalow]] in an isolated area and locks her in a soundproof room. When Ravi goes to Rathnavel's house to get some [[life insurance]] papers, a series of clues lead him to find Bhanu. After distracting Rathnavel, Ravi calls the police and rescues Bhanu. Rathnavel is sent to a [[mental asylum]], where he later [[hanging|hangs himself]]. This seems to be a true story which happened in [[Andhra Pradesh]] in the late 1990s, and Rathnavel's (name changed) family members are still there in [[Kakinada]], but the movie ends with a happy note when we see that Ravi and Bhanu are still happily married and Bhanu is visibly [[pregnancy|pregnant]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Prithviraj Sukumaran|Prithviraj]] as Ravichandran\n* [[Padmapriya Janakiraman]] as Bhanumathy (voice dubbed by [[Chinmayi]])\n* [[Nithin Sathya]] as Rathnavel Kalidas\n* [[Raaghav]] as Bhanu's brother\n* [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as Vincent Selvakumar\n* [[Suhasini]] as Gynecologist\n* [[Sriman (actor)|Sriman]] as Police\n* [[Premji Amaren|Premji]] as Ravichandran's friend\n* [[Jagan]] as Jegan, Rathnavel's friend\n* [[Crane Manohar]] as Ramachandran\n* Soundarya as Ramachandran's mother\n* M.

{"title_page": "-gry puzzle", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:''-gry'' puzzle}}\nThe '''''-gry'' puzzle''' is a popular [[word puzzle]] that asks for the third English word that ends with the letters ''-gry'' other than ''angry'' and ''hungry''. Specific wording varies substantially, but the puzzle has no clear answer, as there are no other common English words that end in ''-gry''.<ref>(Uncommon such words include aggry and puggry.) Both ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]] of the English Language, Unabridged'' (Merriam-Webster, Inc., 2002, {{ISBN|0-87779-201-1}}) and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]], Second Edition'' (Oxford University Press, 1989, {{ISBN|0-19-861186-2}}) contain the compound word \"aggry bead.\" To find a third word ending in ''-gry'' that is not part of a phrase, you must turn to archaic, obsolete, or uncommon words, or personal or place names.</ref><ref>[[Collins English Dictionary]] contains aggry as a standalone word. The only ''-gry'' words playable in Scrabble are aggry, ahungry, angry, hungry and puggry.</ref>  Interpretations of the puzzle suggest it is either an answerless hoax; a trick question; a sincere question asking for an obscure word; or a corruption of more straightforward puzzle, which may have asked for words containing ''gry'' (such as ''[[griffin|gryphon]]''). Of these, countless trick question variants and obscure English words (or nonce words) have been proposed. The lack of a conclusive answer has ensured the enduring popularity of the puzzle, and it has become one of the most frequently asked word puzzles.<ref name=\"cole\">{{cite book |last= Cole |first= Chris |title= Wordplay, A Curious Dictionary of Language Oddities |publisher= Sterling Publishing Co., Inc. |year= 1999 |pages= 96\u2013100 |isbn= 0-8069-1797-0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last= Daly |first= Matthew |title= Usenet rec.puzzles Frequently Asked Questions |work= \"nugry (noo-gree or nyu-gree) n. 1.

Intriguingly, there are members of the latter group who have little or no interest in the puzzle, per se; the challenge is in the list (of words). For both groups, much of the appeal lies in the [[quest]], either to trace the origin of the puzzle or compile a complete list of words ending in ''-gry''.\n\nMore recently, the word ''hangry''\u2014a [[portmanteau]] of 'hungry' and 'angry'\u2014has been used to refer to an irritable state induced by lack of food.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Salis|first1=Amanda|title=The science of 'hangry:' Why some people get grumpy when they're hungry|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/20/health/science-behind-being-hangry/|website=CNN|accessdate=27 May 2016|date=July 20, 2015}}</ref>  Oxford Dictionaries (controlled by, but more lax than, the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]) added ''hangry'' on 27 August 2015,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/|title=English Dictionary, Thesaurus, & Grammar Help &#124; Lexico.com|website=Lexico Dictionaries &#124; English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/4010748/oxford-dictionary-update-2015/|title=Oxford Dictionaries Adds 'Fat-Shame,' 'Butthurt,' 'Redditor'|website=Time}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/hangry-wine-o-clock-new-food-words-oxford-dictionary-story.html|title='Wine o'clock,' 'cat cafe,' 'hangry' added to Oxford dictionary|first=Lindsey|last=Compton|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref> and the full Oxford English Dictionary added ''hangry'' in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://public.oed.com/blog/january-2018-update-new-words-notes/|title=New words notes January 2018|date=January 25, 2018|website=Oxford English Dictionary}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThere are anecdotal reports of various forms of the puzzle dating to the 1950s or earlier; the ultimate origin is presumably an oral tradition or a lost book of puzzles.<ref>\n\"[http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/gry.htm I Spy Gry!]\", ''World Wide Words,'' [[Michael Quinion]], page created 26 Oct. 1996, sast updated: 19 May 2001</ref> However, the first documented evidence is from early 1975 in the [[New York metropolitan area]], and the puzzle rapidly gained popularity in this year. The most likely source is the talk show of [[Bob Grant (radio host)|Bob Grant]], from some program in early or mid March 1975.\n\n[[Merriam-Webster]], publishers of the leading American dictionaries, first heard of this puzzle in a letter dated March 17, 1975, from Patricia Lasker of [[Brooklyn, New York]]. Lasker says her plant manager heard the question on an unnamed [[quiz show]]. Since that time Merriam-Webster has received about four letters each year<ref name=\"cole\"/> asking the question.\n\nThe puzzle first appears in print in Anita Richterman's \"Problem Line\" column in ''[[Newsday]]'' on April 29, 1975. One \"M.Z.\" from [[Wantagh, New York]] states that the problem was asked on a TV quiz program. Richterman states that she asked a learned professor of English for help when she first received the inquiry, and he did not respond for over a month. This agrees with the Merriam-Webster report, suggesting a quiz show in early or mid March 1975.\n\nIn Anita Richterman's column on May 9, 1975, several correspondents reported that they had heard the puzzle on the [[Bob Grant (radio host)|Bob Grant]] radio talk show on [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]] in New York City. This suggests either that the earlier claims of a (TV) quiz show confused a talk show with a quiz show, or that there was another unspecified quiz show that was then repeated by Grant.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Origin of the -Gry Problem |author=Chris Cole |url=http://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4538&context=wordways |journal=Word Ways |volume=34 |issue=1 |year=2012 }}</ref> The majority of readers gave the answer \"[[wikt:gry|gry]],\" an obsolete unit of measure invented by [[John Locke]]. It is unclear whether this was the answer given on the Grant show, or what the precise wording had been.\n\nBy fall 1975 the puzzle had reached the Delaware Valley, again apparently by radio, by which time the puzzle seems to have mutated to a form in which the missing word is an adjective that describes the state of the world.{{sfn|Beaman|1976|loc=\"A Philadelphia Story\", pp. 43\u201344}}\n\nThe puzzle has had occasional bouts of popularity: after its initial popularity in 1975, it was popular in 1978, then again in 1995\u20131996.<ref>''[[Stumpers-L]]'', Good Gry-f!  How many words end in -gry?, by Glenn Kersten, December 1999: \"Fortunately, the popularity of the -gry puzzle has lessened since the boom era of 1995-1996, but SLS Reference Service still receives the question from time to time.

At the origin of the gry puzzle, the standard reverse dictionary in modern English was the \"Air Force Reverse Dictionary\" (formally the ''Normal and Reverse Word List'', compiled under the direction of A. F. Brown), which did not have additional answers for gry. The most plausible answer at the time was ''[[wikt:meagry|meagry]]'', found in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.{{sfn|Beaman|1976|loc=\"A Philadelphia Story\", pp. 43\u201344}} A more elaborate strategy is to list words that have endings similar to gry, such as ''-gary'', and then search a larger dictionary for obsolete variants ending in ''-gry'', for example ''begry'' for ''beggary''.{{sfn|Scheetz|1989|p=198\u2013199}}\n\nFrom around 1980 electronic word lists became widely available on [[Unix]] systems, and searching for answers to the gry puzzle was an occasional benchmark; this also turned up ''gryphon'' in some cases, if match is not required to be at the end.<ref name=\"usenix1983\">USENIX Association, Software Tools User Group, Summer Conference Proceedings, Volume 2, 1983, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=5vsyVfOxHsGaNq7hgJgJ&id=47BQAAAAMAAJ&dq=gry p. 343]: One test was to find words containing the letter sequence \"gry.\" The \"grep gry /usr/dict/words\" ran significantly faster on the Concept than on the VAX (the words found were angry, hungry, and gryphon).</ref> This is now easily done in milliseconds on modern personal computers:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"bash\">\ngrep gry$ /usr/share/dict/words  # Search for words ending in gry\ngrep gry /usr/share/dict/words  # Search for words containing gry\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |journal=[[Word Ways]] |volume=9 |issue=1 |date=February 1976  |first=Ralph G. |last=Beaman |title=Kickshaws |url=http://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1947&context=wordways }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Eckler, A.

Specific wording varies substantially, but the puzzle has no clear answer, as there are no other common English words that end in ''-gry''.<ref>(Uncommon such words include aggry and puggry.) Both ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]] of the English Language, Unabridged'' (Merriam-Webster, Inc., 2002, {{ISBN|0-87779-201-1}}) and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]], Second Edition'' (Oxford University Press, 1989, {{ISBN|0-19-861186-2}}) contain the compound word \"aggry bead.\" To find a third word ending in ''-gry'' that is not part of a phrase, you must turn to archaic, obsolete, or uncommon words, or personal or place names.</ref><ref>[[Collins English Dictionary]] contains aggry as a standalone word. The only ''-gry'' words playable in Scrabble are aggry, ahungry, angry, hungry and puggry.</ref>  Interpretations of the puzzle suggest it is either an answerless hoax; a trick question; a sincere question asking for an obscure word; or a corruption of more straightforward puzzle, which may have asked for words containing ''gry'' (such as ''[[griffin|gryphon]]''). Of these, countless trick question variants and obscure English words (or nonce words) have been proposed. The lack of a conclusive answer has ensured the enduring popularity of the puzzle, and it has become one of the most frequently asked word puzzles.<ref name=\"cole\">{{cite book |last= Cole |first= Chris |title= Wordplay, A Curious Dictionary of Language Oddities |publisher= Sterling Publishing Co., Inc. |year= 1999 |pages= 96\u2013100 |isbn= 0-8069-1797-0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last= Daly |first= Matthew |title= Usenet rec.puzzles Frequently Asked Questions |work= \"nugry (noo-gree or nyu-gree) n. 1.

Intriguingly, there are members of the latter group who have little or no interest in the puzzle, per se; the challenge is in the list (of words). For both groups, much of the appeal lies in the [[quest]], either to trace the origin of the puzzle or compile a complete list of words ending in ''-gry''.\n\nMore recently, the word ''hangry''\u2014a [[portmanteau]] of 'hungry' and 'angry'\u2014has been used to refer to an irritable state induced by lack of food.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Salis|first1=Amanda|title=The science of 'hangry:' Why some people get grumpy when they're hungry|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/20/health/science-behind-being-hangry/|website=CNN|accessdate=27 May 2016|date=July 20, 2015}}</ref>  Oxford Dictionaries (controlled by, but more lax than, the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]) added ''hangry'' on 27 August 2015,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/|title=English Dictionary, Thesaurus, & Grammar Help &#124; Lexico.com|website=Lexico Dictionaries &#124; English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/4010748/oxford-dictionary-update-2015/|title=Oxford Dictionaries Adds 'Fat-Shame,' 'Butthurt,' 'Redditor'|website=Time}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/hangry-wine-o-clock-new-food-words-oxford-dictionary-story.html|title='Wine o'clock,' 'cat cafe,' 'hangry' added to Oxford dictionary|first=Lindsey|last=Compton|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref> and the full Oxford English Dictionary added ''hangry'' in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://public.oed.com/blog/january-2018-update-new-words-notes/|title=New words notes January 2018|date=January 25, 2018|website=Oxford English Dictionary}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThere are anecdotal reports of various forms of the puzzle dating to the 1950s or earlier; the ultimate origin is presumably an oral tradition or a lost book of puzzles.<ref>\n\"[http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/gry.htm I Spy Gry!]\", ''World Wide Words,'' [[Michael Quinion]], page created 26 Oct. 1996, sast updated: 19 May 2001</ref> However, the first documented evidence is from early 1975 in the [[New York metropolitan area]], and the puzzle rapidly gained popularity in this year. The most likely source is the talk show of [[Bob Grant (radio host)|Bob Grant]], from some program in early or mid March 1975.\n\n[[Merriam-Webster]], publishers of the leading American dictionaries, first heard of this puzzle in a letter dated March 17, 1975, from Patricia Lasker of [[Brooklyn, New York]]. Lasker says her plant manager heard the question on an unnamed [[quiz show]]. Since that time Merriam-Webster has received about four letters each year<ref name=\"cole\"/> asking the question.\n\nThe puzzle first appears in print in Anita Richterman's \"Problem Line\" column in ''[[Newsday]]'' on April 29, 1975. One \"M.Z.\" from [[Wantagh, New York]] states that the problem was asked on a TV quiz program. Richterman states that she asked a learned professor of English for help when she first received the inquiry, and he did not respond for over a month. This agrees with the Merriam-Webster report, suggesting a quiz show in early or mid March 1975.\n\nIn Anita Richterman's column on May 9, 1975, several correspondents reported that they had heard the puzzle on the [[Bob Grant (radio host)|Bob Grant]] radio talk show on [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]] in New York City. This suggests either that the earlier claims of a (TV) quiz show confused a talk show with a quiz show, or that there was another unspecified quiz show that was then repeated by Grant.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Origin of the -Gry Problem |author=Chris Cole |url=http://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4538&context=wordways |journal=Word Ways |volume=34 |issue=1 |year=2012 }}</ref> The majority of readers gave the answer \"[[wikt:gry|gry]],\" an obsolete unit of measure invented by [[John Locke]]. It is unclear whether this was the answer given on the Grant show, or what the precise wording had been.\n\nBy fall 1975 the puzzle had reached the Delaware Valley, again apparently by radio, by which time the puzzle seems to have mutated to a form in which the missing word is an adjective that describes the state of the world.{{sfn|Beaman|1976|loc=\"A Philadelphia Story\", pp. 43\u201344}}\n\nThe puzzle has had occasional bouts of popularity: after its initial popularity in 1975, it was popular in 1978, then again in 1995\u20131996.<ref>''[[Stumpers-L]]'', Good Gry-f!

This form originated in 1883, with an A.A. of Glasgow writing to [[George Augustus Henry Sala]] in his \"Echoes of the Week\" column in the ''[[Illustrated London News]].''<ref>Collected in ''Echoes of the year Eighteen Hundred and Eighty-Three,'' [https://archive.org/details/echoesyeareight00unkngoog/page/n358 <!-- quote=dous tremendous stupendous. --> p. 337]</ref><ref>See credit of Sala in ''Tidbits,'' 1884 February 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sj85AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA246&dq=dous+tremendous+stupendous p. 246]; reprint: [https://books.google.com/books?id=vPgIAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA327&dq=dous+hazardous+tremendous p. 327]</ref>\nThis question has had enduring popularity,<ref>''Graphite,'' 1909 March, \"'Dous' Sequel\", [https://books.google.com/books?id=sZzmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA1976&dq=tremendous+stupendous+dous p. 1076]</ref> even inspiring a contest,<ref name=\"spatula\">''The Spatula,'' Volume 2, 1895, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nxVOAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA360&dq=dous+tremendous+stupendous p. 360]</ref> though the words have proven less stable: today ''jeopardous'' is considered too rare, and the formerly unpopular ''[[wikt:horrendous|horrendous]]'' has taken its place; this change occurred as early as 1909.<ref name=\"eandp\">Editor and Publisher, Volume 9, 1909, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7yVDAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA18-IA89&dq=tremendous+stupendous+hazardous+dous p. 89]</ref> At times other words such as ''[[wikt:hybridous|hybridous]]'' have been accepted.<ref name=\"spatula\"/> Today ''[[wikt:hazardous|hazardous]]'' is typically the omitted word, and differs from the others in being a visible compound ''[[wikt:hazard|hazard]]'' + ''[[wikt:-ous|-ous]].'' This puzzle has continued in popularity through the end of the 20th century,<ref>''The Game of Words,'' Willard Epsy, 1971</ref>{{sfn|Beaman|1976|loc=\"Kickshaws: An Earlier Kickshaw\", [https://books.google.com/books?id=9IgsAAAAMAAJ&q=tremendous+stupendous p. 40]}} with recent versions giving it as an alternative to the gry puzzle.<ref>''The Word Circus: A Letter-perfect Book,'' by Richard Lederer, Dave Morice, 1998, [https://archive.org/details/wordcircusletter00lede/page/229 p. 229]</ref>\n\nAnother similar one is words ending in ''-cion'', of which the common words are ''[[wikt:coercion|coercion]]'', ''[[wikt:scion|scion]]'', and ''[[wikt:suspicion|suspicion]]''.<ref name=\"nandq\">''Notes and Queries,'' Vol. VI, No. 10, 1889, October, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0qYXAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA365&dq=cion p. 365]</ref><ref name=\"eandp\"/>\n\nThe most similar to the gry puzzle in form is to find three words that contain the letter sequence ''shion'', to which the answer is ''[[wikt:cushion|cu'''shion''']]'', ''[[wikt:fashion|fa'''shion''']]'', and ''[[wikt:parishioner|pari'''shion'''er]]'';  this is typically stated by giving ''cushion'' and ''fashion'', and requesting the third word, namely ''parishioner''.<ref name=\"lederer\"/><ref>''Weeds in the Garden of Words: Further Observations on the Tangled History of the English Language,'' Kate Burridge, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Iq9R_9AQ19gC&pg=PA82 p. 82], p. 184</ref> This can be modified to finding words ''ending'' with ''-shion'', in which case the answer is the obsolete word ''[[wikt:parishion|parishion]]'', which is a synonymous variant of ''parishioner''. This has not been nearly as popular as the gry puzzle.\n\n==Solution techniques==\nThe standard way to solve such puzzles is to use a [[reverse dictionary]], or to perform an exhaustive search through a dictionary, either manually, which is tedious and error-prone, or using computer tools such as [[grep]], which requires an electronic word list. At the origin of the gry puzzle, the standard reverse dictionary in modern English was the \"Air Force Reverse Dictionary\" (formally the ''Normal and Reverse Word List'', compiled under the direction of A. F. Brown), which did not have additional answers for gry. The most plausible answer at the time was ''[[wikt:meagry|meagry]]'', found in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.{{sfn|Beaman|1976|loc=\"A Philadelphia Story\", pp. 43\u201344}} A more elaborate strategy is to list words that have endings similar to gry, such as ''-gary'', and then search a larger dictionary for obsolete variants ending in ''-gry'', for example ''begry'' for ''beggary''.{{sfn|Scheetz|1989|p=198\u2013199}}\n\nFrom around 1980 electronic word lists became widely available on [[Unix]] systems, and searching for answers to the gry puzzle was an occasional benchmark; this also turned up ''gryphon'' in some cases, if match is not required to be at the end.<ref name=\"usenix1983\">USENIX Association, Software Tools User Group, Summer Conference Proceedings, Volume 2, 1983, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=5vsyVfOxHsGaNq7hgJgJ&id=47BQAAAAMAAJ&dq=gry p. 343]: One test was to find words containing the letter sequence \"gry.\" The \"grep gry /usr/dict/words\" ran significantly faster on the Concept than on the VAX (the words found were angry, hungry, and gryphon).</ref> This is now easily done in milliseconds on modern personal computers:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"bash\">\ngrep gry$ /usr/share/dict/words  # Search for words ending in gry\ngrep gry /usr/share/dict/words  # Search for words containing gry\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |journal=[[Word Ways]] |volume=9 |issue=1 |date=February 1976  |first=Ralph G. |last=Beaman |title=Kickshaws |url=http://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1947&context=wordways |ref=harv }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Eckler, A.

In the 1920 Yugoslav parliamentary elections, 25% of the total Communist vote came from Macedonia, but participation was low (only 55%),  mainly because the pro-Bulgarian IMRO organised a boycott against the elections. In the following years, the communists attempted to enlist the pro-IMRO sympathies of the population in their cause. In the context of this attempt, in 1924 the Comintern organized the filed signing of the so-called [[May Manifesto]], in which independence of partitioned Macedonia was required.<ref>Victor Roudometof, ''Nationalism, Globalization, and Orthodoxy: The Social Origins of Ethnic Conflict in the Balkans (Contributions to the Study of World History)'', Praeger, 2001, p.187</ref> In 1925 with the help of the Comintern, the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United)]] was created, composed of former left-wing [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) members.

However if the Yugoslavs would recognize the Slavic inhabitants of Vardar Macedonia as Bulgarians, it would  mean that the area should be part of Bulgaria. Practically in [[post-World War II]] Macedonia, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's state policy of forced [[Serbianisation]] was changed with a new one \u2014 of [[Macedonization]]. The codification of the Macedonian language and the recognition of the Macedonian nation had the main goal: finally to ban any [[Bulgarophilia]] among the Macedonians and to build a new consciousness, based on identification with Yugoslavia. As result Yugoslavia introduced again an abrupt ''de-Bulgarization'' of the people in the [[PR Macedonia]], such as it already had conducted in the [[Vardar Banovina]] during the [[Interwar period]]. Around 100,000 pro-Bulgarian elements were imprisoned for violations of the special ''Law for the protection of Macedonian national honor'', and over 1,200 were allegedly killed. In this way generations of students grew up educated in strong anti-Bulgarian sentiment which  during the times of [[Communist Yugoslavia]], increased to the level of [[state policy]]. Its main agenda was a result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarians and the new Macedonian nation, because Macedonians could confirm themselves as a separate community with its own history, only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. This policy has continued in the new Republic of Macedonia after 1990, although with less intensity. Thus, the Bulgarian part of the identity of the Slavic-speaking population in Vardar Macedonia has died out.{{efn|See:<ref>\"Within Greece, and also within the new kingdom of Yugoslavia, which Serbia had joined in 1918, the ejection of the Bulgarian church, the closure of Bulgarian schools, and the banning of publication in Bulgarian, together with the expulsion or flight to Bulgaria of a large proportion of the Macedonian Slav intelligentsia, served as the prelude to campaigns of forcible cultural and linguistic assimilation...In both countries, these policies of de-bulgarization and assimilation were pursued, with fluctuating degrees of vigor, right through to 1941, when the Second World War engulfed the Balkan peninsula. The degree of these policies' success, however, remains open to question. The available evidence suggests that Bulgarian national sentiment among the Macedonian Slavs of Yugoslavia and Greece remained strong throughout the interwar period, though they lacked the means to offer more than passive resistance to official policies.\" For more see: F.

Once again, the Exarchist clergy and Bulgarian teachers were expelled, all Bulgarian-language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian clubs, societies, and organizations dissolved, The Serbianization of family surnames proceeded as before the war, with Stankov becoming Stankovic and Atanasov entered in the books by Atanackovic... Thousands of Macedonians left for Bulgaria. Though there were fewer killings of \"Bulgarians\" (a pro-Bulgarian source claimed 342 such instances and 47 additional disappearances in 1918 \u2013 1924), the conventional forms of repression (jailings, internments etc.) were applied more systematically and with greater effect than before (the same source lists 2,900 political arrests in the same period)...

Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness.

The rich cultural heritage of the Macedonians is accented in the folklore, the picturesque traditional folk costumes, decorations and ornaments in city and village homes, the architecture, the monasteries and churches, iconostasis, wood-carving and so on. The culture of Macedonians can roughly be explained as a Balkanic, closely related to that of [[Bulgarians]] and [[Serbs]].\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Robevihouse.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] architecture in [[Ohrid]].]]\n[[File:Makedonski Nosii 2.jpg|thumb|right|Macedonian girls in traditional folk costumes.]]\nThe typical Macedonian village house is influelnced by [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman Architecture]] .Presented as a construction with two floors, with a hard facade composed of large stones and a wide balcony on the second floor. In villages with predominantly agricultural economy, the first floor was often used as a storage for the harvest, while in some villages the first floor was used as a cattle-pen.\n\nThe stereotype for a traditional Macedonian city house is a two-floor building with white fa\u00e7ade, with a forward extended second floor, and black wooden elements around the windows and on the edges.\n\n===Cinema and theater===\n{{main|Cinema of North Macedonia}}\n\nThe history of film making in North Macedonia dates back over 110 years. The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by [[Manakis brothers|Janaki and Milton Manaki]] in [[Bitola]]. In 1995 [[Before the Rain (1994 film)|Before the Rain]] became the first Macedonian movie to be nominated for an Academy Award.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 67th Academy Awards {{!}} 1995 |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1995 |website=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=27 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1993 to 1994, 1,596 performances were held in the newly formed republic, and more than 330,000 people attended. The Macedonian National Theater (drama, opera, and ballet companies), the Drama Theater, the Theater of the Nationalities (Albanian and Turkish drama companies) and the other theater companies comprise about 870 professional actors, singers, ballet dancers, directors, playwrights, set and costume designers, etc. There is also a professional theatre for children and three amateur theaters. For the last thirty years a traditional festival of Macedonian professional theaters has been taking place in [[Prilep]] in honor of [[Vojdan \u010cernodrinski]], the founder of the modern Macedonian theater. Each year a festival of amateur and experimental Macedonian theater companies is held in [[Ko\u010dani]].\n\n===Music and art===\n{{main|Music of North Macedonia}}\n\nMacedonian music has many things in common with the music of neighboring [[Balkan]] countries, but maintains its own distinctive sound.\n\nThe founders of modern Macedonian painting included [[Lazar Licenovski]], [[Nikola Martinoski]], [[Dimitar Pandilov]], and [[Vangel Kodzoman]]. They were succeeded by an exceptionally talented and fruitful generation, consisting of [[Borka Lazeski]], [[Dimitar Kondovski]], [[Petar Mazev]] who are now deceased, and [[Rodoljub Anastasov]] and many others who are still active. Others include: [[Vasko Taskovski]] and [[Vangel Naumovski]]. In addition to [[Dimo Todorovski]], who is considered to be the founder of modern [[Macedonian sculpture]], the works of [[Petar Hadzi Boskov]], [[Boro Mitrikeski]], [[Novak Dimitrovski]] and [[Tome Serafimovski]] are also outstanding.\n\n===Economy===\nIn the past, the Macedonian population was predominantly involved with agriculture, with a very small portion of the people who were engaged in trade (mainly in the cities). But after the creation of the People's Republic of Macedonia which started a social transformation based on Socialist principles, a middle and heavy industry were started.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Macedonian language}}\n\nThe Macedonian language ({{lang|mk|\u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a}}) is a member of the Eastern group of [[South Slavic languages]]. [[Standard Macedonian]] was implemented as the official language of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] after being [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] in the 1940s, and has accumulated a thriving [[Macedonian literature|literary tradition]].\n\nThe closest relative of Macedonian is [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]],<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Levinson|O'Leary|1992|p=239}}</ref> followed by [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]. All the [[South Slavic languages]], including Macedonian, form a [[dialect continuum]], in which Macedonian is situated between Bulgarian and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. The [[Torlakian]] dialect group is intermediate between Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian, comprising some of the northernmost [[Dialects of the Macedonian language|dialects of Macedonian]] as well as varieties spoken in southern Serbia.\n\nThe [[Macedonian alphabet]] is an adaptation of the [[Cyrillic script]], as well as language-specific conventions of spelling and punctuation. It is rarely [[Romanization of Macedonian|Romanized]].\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church|Roman Catholicism in North Macedonia|Macedonian Greek Catholic Church|Protestantism in North Macedonia|Islam in North Macedonia}}\n[[File:2011 Ochryda, Cerkiew \u015bw. Pantelejmona (02).jpg|thumb|right|250px|One of the well-known monasteries \u2013 [[Saint Panteleimon, Ohrid|St. Panteleimon]] in Ohrid.]]\n\nMost Macedonians are members of the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church]]. The official name of the church is Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric and is the body of Christians who are united under the Archbishop of Ohrid and North Macedonia, exercising jurisdiction over Macedonian Orthodox Christians in the Republic of North Macedonia and in [[exarchate]]s in the [[Macedonian diaspora]].\n\nThe church gained autonomy from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1959 and declared the restoration of the historic [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. On 19 July 1967, the Macedonian Orthodox Church declared [[autocephaly]] from the Serbian church. Due to protest from the Serbian Orthodox Church, the move was not recognised by any of the churches of the [[Eastern Orthodox Communion]], and since then, the Macedonian Orthodox Church is not in communion with any Orthodox Church.<ref>The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3. By Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley. p. 381</ref> A small number of Macedonians belong to the [[Roman Catholic]] and the [[Protestant Church|Protestant]] churches.\n\nBetween the 15th and the 20th centuries, during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], a number of Orthodox Macedonian Slavs converted to Islam. Today in the Republic of North Macedonia, they are regarded as [[Macedonian Muslims]], who constitute the second largest religious community of the country.\n\n===Names===\n{{Main|Culture of North Macedonia#Macedonian names|l1=Macedonian names}}\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Macedonian cuisine}}\n[[File:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0432\u043e \u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430(\u0442\u0430\u0444\u0447\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0435) (3).jpg|thumb|right|[[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]], the [[national dish]] of Macedonians.]]\nMacedonian cuisine is a representative of the cuisine of the [[Balkans]]\u2014reflecting Mediterranean (Greek) and Middle Eastern (Turkish) influences, and to a lesser extent Italian, German and Eastern European (especially Hungarian) ones. The relatively warm climate in North Macedonia provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Thus, Macedonian cuisine is particularly diverse.\n\n[[Shopska salad]], a food from [[Bulgaria]], is an appetizer and side dish which accompanies almost every meal. Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its [[dairy products]], wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as [[rakija]]. [[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]] and [[mastika]] are considered the national dish and drink of North Macedonia, respectively.\n\n==Symbols==\n: ''See also: [[Flags of North Macedonia]]'', ''[[Symbols of North Macedonia]]''\n\n* '''''Sun''''': The official [[flag of the Republic of North Macedonia]], adopted in 1995, is a yellow sun with eight broadening rays extending to the edges of the red field.\n* '''''Coat of arms''''': After independence in 1991, North Macedonia retained the [[Coat of arms of North Macedonia|coat of arms]] adopted in 1946 by the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Macedonia on its second extraordinary session held on 27 July 1946, later on altered by article 8 of the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Macedonia. The coat-of-arms is composed by a double bent garland of ears of wheat, tobacco and poppy, tied by a ribbon with the embroidery of a traditional folk costume. In the center of such a circular room there are mountains, rivers, lakes and the sun. All this is said to represent \"the richness of our country, our struggle, and our freedom\".\n\n'''Unofficial symbols'''\n* '''''[[Golden Lion of North Macedonia|Lion]]''''': The lion first appears in the [[Fojnica Armorial]] from 17th century, where the coat of arms of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] is included among those of other entities. On the coat of arms is a crown; inside a yellow crowned lion is depicted standing rampant, on a red background. On the bottom enclosed in a red and yellow border is written \"Macedonia\". The use of the lion to represent Macedonia was continued in foreign heraldic collections throughout the 16th to 18th centuries.<ref>Matkovski, Aleksandar, ''Grbovite na Makedonija'', Skopje, 1970.</ref><ref>\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440 \u041c\u0430\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438 (1990) \u0413\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u041c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430, Skopje, Macedonia&nbsp;\u2014 {{ISBN|86-15-00160-X}}<br></ref> Nevertheless, during the late 19th century the [[Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization]] arose, which modeled itself after the earlier [[Internal Revolutionary Organization|Bulgarian revolutionary traditions]] and adopted their symbols as the [[Bulgarian lion|lion]], etc.<ref>Duncan M.

However, this symbol is not totally accepted while the state [[coat of arms of Bulgaria]] is somewhat similar.\n* '''''[[Vergina Flag (North Macedonia)|Vergina Sun]]:''''' (official flag, 1992\u20131995) The [[Vergina Sun]] is used unofficially by various  associations and cultural groups in the Macedonian diaspora. The [[Vergina]] Sun is believed to have been associated with [[Greeks|ancient Greek]] kings such as [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], although it was used as an ornamental design long before the Macedonian period. The symbol was discovered in the present-day [[Greece|Greek]] region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Greeks]] regard it as a misappropriation of a [[Greece|Hellenic symbol]], unrelated to Slavic cultures, and a direct claim on the legacy of Philip II. In 1995, [[Greece]] lodged a claim for [[Trademark|trademark protection]] of the Vergina Sun as a state symbol under [[WIPO]].<ref>[http://www.wipo.int/cgi-6te/guest/ifetch5?ENG+6TER+15+1151315-REVERSE+0+0+1055+F+125+431+101+25+SEP-0/HITNUM,B+KIND%2fEmblem+]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060329000458/http://www.wipo.int/cgi-6te/guest/ifetch5?ENG%206TER%2015%201151315-REVERSE%200%200%201055%20F%20125%20431%20101%2025%20SEP-0%2FHITNUM%2CB%20KIND%2FEmblem%20 |title= wipo.int|date=29 March 2006 }}</ref> In [[Greece]] the symbol against a blue field is used vastly in the area of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and it has official status.The Vergina sun on a red field was the first flag of the independent Republic of Macedonia, until it was removed from the state flag under an agreement reached between the Republic of Macedonia and [[Greece]] in September 1995.<ref>Floudas, Demetrius Andreas; {{cite news |publisher=24 (1996) Journal of Political and Military Sociology, 285|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_199601/ai_n8752910 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060127053906/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_199601/ai_n8752910 |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 January 2006 | title= A Name for a Conflict or a Conflict for a Name?

In the 1920 Yugoslav parliamentary elections, 25% of the total Communist vote came from Macedonia, but participation was low (only 55%),  mainly because the pro-Bulgarian IMRO organised a boycott against the elections. In the following years, the communists attempted to enlist the pro-IMRO sympathies of the population in their cause. In the context of this attempt, in 1924 the Comintern organized the filed signing of the so-called [[May Manifesto]], in which independence of partitioned Macedonia was required.<ref>Victor Roudometof, ''Nationalism, Globalization, and Orthodoxy: The Social Origins of Ethnic Conflict in the Balkans (Contributions to the Study of World History)'', Praeger, 2001, p.187</ref> In 1925 with the help of the Comintern, the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United)]] was created, composed of former left-wing [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) members.

The sense of belonging to a separate Macedonian nation gained credence during World War II when ethnic Macedonian communist partisan detachments were formed. In 1943 the Communist Party of Macedonia was established and the resistance movement grew up. After the World War II ethnic Macedonian institutions were created in the three parts of the region of Macedonia, then under communist control,<ref name=\"Barbara Jelavich\">History of the Balkans, Vol. 2: Twentieth Century.

However if the Yugoslavs would recognize the Slavic inhabitants of Vardar Macedonia as Bulgarians, it would  mean that the area should be part of Bulgaria. Practically in [[post-World War II]] Macedonia, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's state policy of forced [[Serbianisation]] was changed with a new one \u2014 of [[Macedonization]]. The codification of the Macedonian language and the recognition of the Macedonian nation had the main goal: finally to ban any [[Bulgarophilia]] among the Macedonians and to build a new consciousness, based on identification with Yugoslavia. As result Yugoslavia introduced again an abrupt ''de-Bulgarization'' of the people in the [[PR Macedonia]], such as it already had conducted in the [[Vardar Banovina]] during the [[Interwar period]]. Around 100,000 pro-Bulgarian elements were imprisoned for violations of the special ''Law for the protection of Macedonian national honor'', and over 1,200 were allegedly killed. In this way generations of students grew up educated in strong anti-Bulgarian sentiment which  during the times of [[Communist Yugoslavia]], increased to the level of [[state policy]]. Its main agenda was a result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarians and the new Macedonian nation, because Macedonians could confirm themselves as a separate community with its own history, only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. This policy has continued in the new Republic of Macedonia after 1990, although with less intensity. Thus, the Bulgarian part of the identity of the Slavic-speaking population in Vardar Macedonia has died out.{{efn|See:<ref>\"Within Greece, and also within the new kingdom of Yugoslavia, which Serbia had joined in 1918, the ejection of the Bulgarian church, the closure of Bulgarian schools, and the banning of publication in Bulgarian, together with the expulsion or flight to Bulgaria of a large proportion of the Macedonian Slav intelligentsia, served as the prelude to campaigns of forcible cultural and linguistic assimilation...In both countries, these policies of de-bulgarization and assimilation were pursued, with fluctuating degrees of vigor, right through to 1941, when the Second World War engulfed the Balkan peninsula. The degree of these policies' success, however, remains open to question. The available evidence suggests that Bulgarian national sentiment among the Macedonian Slavs of Yugoslavia and Greece remained strong throughout the interwar period, though they lacked the means to offer more than passive resistance to official policies.\" For more see: F.

Once again, the Exarchist clergy and Bulgarian teachers were expelled, all Bulgarian-language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian clubs, societies, and organizations dissolved, The Serbianization of family surnames proceeded as before the war, with Stankov becoming Stankovic and Atanasov entered in the books by Atanackovic... Thousands of Macedonians left for Bulgaria. Though there were fewer killings of \"Bulgarians\" (a pro-Bulgarian source claimed 342 such instances and 47 additional disappearances in 1918 \u2013 1924), the conventional forms of repression (jailings, internments etc.) were applied more systematically and with greater effect than before (the same source lists 2,900 political arrests in the same period)... Like Kosovo, Macedonia was slated for Serb settlements and internal colonization. The authorities projected the settlement of 50,000 families in Macedonia, though only 4,200 families had been placed in 280 colonies by 1940.\" For more see: Ivo Banac,  \"The National Question in Yugoslavia.

Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs, and to create an national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

The anti-Bulgariansim (or Bulgarophobia) increased almost to the level of state ideology during the ideological monopoly of the League of Communists of Macedonia, and still continues to do so today, although with less ferocity... However, it is more important to say openly that a great deal of these anti-Bulgarian sentiments result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarian and the Macedonian nations. Macedonia could confirm itself as a state with its own past, present and future only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. For more see: Mirjana Maleska.

It is strongly bound with their native land and the surrounding in which they live. The rich cultural heritage of the Macedonians is accented in the folklore, the picturesque traditional folk costumes, decorations and ornaments in city and village homes, the architecture, the monasteries and churches, iconostasis, wood-carving and so on. The culture of Macedonians can roughly be explained as a Balkanic, closely related to that of [[Bulgarians]] and [[Serbs]].\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Robevihouse.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] architecture in [[Ohrid]].]]\n[[File:Makedonski Nosii 2.jpg|thumb|right|Macedonian girls in traditional folk costumes.]]\nThe typical Macedonian village house is influelnced by [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman Architecture]] .Presented as a construction with two floors, with a hard facade composed of large stones and a wide balcony on the second floor. In villages with predominantly agricultural economy, the first floor was often used as a storage for the harvest, while in some villages the first floor was used as a cattle-pen.\n\nThe stereotype for a traditional Macedonian city house is a two-floor building with white fa\u00e7ade, with a forward extended second floor, and black wooden elements around the windows and on the edges.\n\n===Cinema and theater===\n{{main|Cinema of North Macedonia}}\n\nThe history of film making in North Macedonia dates back over 110 years. The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by [[Manakis brothers|Janaki and Milton Manaki]] in [[Bitola]]. In 1995 [[Before the Rain (1994 film)|Before the Rain]] became the first Macedonian movie to be nominated for an Academy Award.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 67th Academy Awards {{!}} 1995 |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1995 |website=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=27 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1993 to 1994, 1,596 performances were held in the newly formed republic, and more than 330,000 people attended. The Macedonian National Theater (drama, opera, and ballet companies), the Drama Theater, the Theater of the Nationalities (Albanian and Turkish drama companies) and the other theater companies comprise about 870 professional actors, singers, ballet dancers, directors, playwrights, set and costume designers, etc. There is also a professional theatre for children and three amateur theaters. For the last thirty years a traditional festival of Macedonian professional theaters has been taking place in [[Prilep]] in honor of [[Vojdan \u010cernodrinski]], the founder of the modern Macedonian theater. Each year a festival of amateur and experimental Macedonian theater companies is held in [[Ko\u010dani]].\n\n===Music and art===\n{{main|Music of North Macedonia}}\n\nMacedonian music has many things in common with the music of neighboring [[Balkan]] countries, but maintains its own distinctive sound.\n\nThe founders of modern Macedonian painting included [[Lazar Licenovski]], [[Nikola Martinoski]], [[Dimitar Pandilov]], and [[Vangel Kodzoman]]. They were succeeded by an exceptionally talented and fruitful generation, consisting of [[Borka Lazeski]], [[Dimitar Kondovski]], [[Petar Mazev]] who are now deceased, and [[Rodoljub Anastasov]] and many others who are still active. Others include: [[Vasko Taskovski]] and [[Vangel Naumovski]]. In addition to [[Dimo Todorovski]], who is considered to be the founder of modern [[Macedonian sculpture]], the works of [[Petar Hadzi Boskov]], [[Boro Mitrikeski]], [[Novak Dimitrovski]] and [[Tome Serafimovski]] are also outstanding.\n\n===Economy===\nIn the past, the Macedonian population was predominantly involved with agriculture, with a very small portion of the people who were engaged in trade (mainly in the cities). But after the creation of the People's Republic of Macedonia which started a social transformation based on Socialist principles, a middle and heavy industry were started.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Macedonian language}}\n\nThe Macedonian language ({{lang|mk|\u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a}}) is a member of the Eastern group of [[South Slavic languages]]. [[Standard Macedonian]] was implemented as the official language of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] after being [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] in the 1940s, and has accumulated a thriving [[Macedonian literature|literary tradition]].\n\nThe closest relative of Macedonian is [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]],<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Levinson|O'Leary|1992|p=239}}</ref> followed by [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]. All the [[South Slavic languages]], including Macedonian, form a [[dialect continuum]], in which Macedonian is situated between Bulgarian and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. The [[Torlakian]] dialect group is intermediate between Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian, comprising some of the northernmost [[Dialects of the Macedonian language|dialects of Macedonian]] as well as varieties spoken in southern Serbia.\n\nThe [[Macedonian alphabet]] is an adaptation of the [[Cyrillic script]], as well as language-specific conventions of spelling and punctuation. It is rarely [[Romanization of Macedonian|Romanized]].\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church|Roman Catholicism in North Macedonia|Macedonian Greek Catholic Church|Protestantism in North Macedonia|Islam in North Macedonia}}\n[[File:2011 Ochryda, Cerkiew \u015bw.

The official name of the church is Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric and is the body of Christians who are united under the Archbishop of Ohrid and North Macedonia, exercising jurisdiction over Macedonian Orthodox Christians in the Republic of North Macedonia and in [[exarchate]]s in the [[Macedonian diaspora]].\n\nThe church gained autonomy from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1959 and declared the restoration of the historic [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. On 19 July 1967, the Macedonian Orthodox Church declared [[autocephaly]] from the Serbian church. Due to protest from the Serbian Orthodox Church, the move was not recognised by any of the churches of the [[Eastern Orthodox Communion]], and since then, the Macedonian Orthodox Church is not in communion with any Orthodox Church.<ref>The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3. By Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley. p. 381</ref> A small number of Macedonians belong to the [[Roman Catholic]] and the [[Protestant Church|Protestant]] churches.\n\nBetween the 15th and the 20th centuries, during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], a number of Orthodox Macedonian Slavs converted to Islam. Today in the Republic of North Macedonia, they are regarded as [[Macedonian Muslims]], who constitute the second largest religious community of the country.\n\n===Names===\n{{Main|Culture of North Macedonia#Macedonian names|l1=Macedonian names}}\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Macedonian cuisine}}\n[[File:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0432\u043e \u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430(\u0442\u0430\u0444\u0447\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0435) (3).jpg|thumb|right|[[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]], the [[national dish]] of Macedonians.]]\nMacedonian cuisine is a representative of the cuisine of the [[Balkans]]\u2014reflecting Mediterranean (Greek) and Middle Eastern (Turkish) influences, and to a lesser extent Italian, German and Eastern European (especially Hungarian) ones. The relatively warm climate in North Macedonia provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Thus, Macedonian cuisine is particularly diverse.\n\n[[Shopska salad]], a food from [[Bulgaria]], is an appetizer and side dish which accompanies almost every meal. Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its [[dairy products]], wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as [[rakija]]. [[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]] and [[mastika]] are considered the national dish and drink of North Macedonia, respectively.\n\n==Symbols==\n: ''See also: [[Flags of North Macedonia]]'', ''[[Symbols of North Macedonia]]''\n\n* '''''Sun''''': The official [[flag of the Republic of North Macedonia]], adopted in 1995, is a yellow sun with eight broadening rays extending to the edges of the red field.\n* '''''Coat of arms''''': After independence in 1991, North Macedonia retained the [[Coat of arms of North Macedonia|coat of arms]] adopted in 1946 by the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Macedonia on its second extraordinary session held on 27 July 1946, later on altered by article 8 of the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Macedonia. The coat-of-arms is composed by a double bent garland of ears of wheat, tobacco and poppy, tied by a ribbon with the embroidery of a traditional folk costume. In the center of such a circular room there are mountains, rivers, lakes and the sun. All this is said to represent \"the richness of our country, our struggle, and our freedom\".\n\n'''Unofficial symbols'''\n* '''''[[Golden Lion of North Macedonia|Lion]]''''': The lion first appears in the [[Fojnica Armorial]] from 17th century, where the coat of arms of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] is included among those of other entities. On the coat of arms is a crown; inside a yellow crowned lion is depicted standing rampant, on a red background. On the bottom enclosed in a red and yellow border is written \"Macedonia\".

The [[Vergina]] Sun is believed to have been associated with [[Greeks|ancient Greek]] kings such as [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], although it was used as an ornamental design long before the Macedonian period. The symbol was discovered in the present-day [[Greece|Greek]] region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Greeks]] regard it as a misappropriation of a [[Greece|Hellenic symbol]], unrelated to Slavic cultures, and a direct claim on the legacy of Philip II.

In [[Afghanistan]] (where the [[Tajiks|Tajik people]] minority forms the principal part of the wider Persophone population), this language is less influenced by [[Turkic languages]], is regarded as a form of [[Dari language|Dari]] and as such has co-official language status. The Tajik of Tajikistan has diverged from Persian as spoken in Afghanistan and [[Iran]] due to political borders, geographical isolation, the standardization process and the influence of [[Russian language|Russian]] and neighboring Turkic languages. The standard language is based on the northwestern dialects of Tajik (region of old major city of [[Samarqand]]), which have been somewhat influenced by the neighboring [[Uzbek language]] as a result of geographical proximity. Tajik also retains numerous archaic elements in its vocabulary, pronunciation and grammar that have been lost elsewhere in the Persophone world, in part due to its relative isolation in the mountains of [[Central Asia]].\n\n==Name==\n\nUp to and including the nineteenth century, speakers in Afghanistan and Central Asia had no separate name for the language and simply regarded themselves as speaking \"Farsi\" which is the [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] for the Persian language. The term \"Tajik\", derived from the Persian for \"foreigner\", was an exonym used by Turkic speakers to refer to Persian speakers (the word [[Tat people (Iran)|Tat]] has a similar origin), though since adopted by the speakers themselves.<ref>Ben Walter, ''Gendering Human Security in Afghanistan in a Time of Western Intervention'' (Routledge 2017), p. 51: for more details, see the article on [[Tajik people]].</ref>\n\nIn 1989, with the growth in [[T\u0101jik people|Tajik]] nationalism, a law was enacted declaring Tajik the [[official language|state language]]. In addition, the law officially equated Tajik with [[Persian language|Persian]], placing the word ''Farsi'' (the endonym for the Persian language) after Tajik. The law also called for a gradual reintroduction of the Perso-Arabic alphabet.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=sgW_HEcULMYC&pg=PA219&dq=tajikistan+alphabet+struggle&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9_6nUJOlO5KQ0QGV_4D4Cw&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=tajikistan%20alphabet%20struggle&f=false ed.

Despite these differences, Bukhori is [[Mutual intelligibility|readily intelligible]] to other Tajik-speakers, particularly speakers of northern dialects.\n\nA very important moment in the development of the contemporary Tajik, especially of the spoken language, is the tendency in changing its dialectal orientation.

Tajik Persian grammar is almost identical to the classical Persian grammar (and the grammar of modern varieties such as Iranian Persian), although there are notable differences.<ref>Perry, J. R. 2005</ref> The most notable difference between classical Persian grammar and Tajik Persian grammar is the construction of the present progressive tense in each language. In Tajik, the present progressive form consists of a present progressive participle, from the verb \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043d ''istodan'' 'to stand', and a cliticized form of the verb -ac\u0442 ''-ast'' 'to be'.<ref name=Ido />\n<br />\n:{|\n|-\n| \u041c\u0430\u043d || \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0431 || \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0430 || \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0434\u0430-\u0430\u043c\n|-\n| ''man'' || ''maktub'' || ''navi\u0161ta'' || ''istoda-am''\n|-\n| I || letter || write || be\n|-\n|colspan=9| 'I am writing a letter.'\n|}\n\nIn Classical Persian, the present progressive form consists of the verb \u062f\u0627\u0631 ''d\u0101r'' 'to have' followed by a conjugated verb in either the simple present tense, the habitual past tense, or the habitual past perfect tense.<ref>Windfuhr, Gernot.

The plural is marked by either the suffix -\u04b3\u043e ''-ho'' or -\u043e\u043d ''-on'' (with contextual variants -\u0451\u043d ''-yon'' and -\u0433\u043e\u043d ''-gon''), although Arabic loan words may use Arabic forms. There is no definite article, but the indefinite article exists in the form of the number \"one\" \u044f\u043a ''yak'',  and -\u0435 ''-e'', the first positioned before the noun and the second joining the noun as a suffix. When a noun is used as a [[direct object]], it is marked by the suffix -\u0440\u043e ''-ro'', e.g. \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0440\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043c (''Rustam-ro zadam''), \"I hit Rustam\". This direct object suffix is added to the word after any plural suffixes. The form -\u0440\u043e can be literary or formal. In older forms of the Persian language, -\u0440\u043e could indicate both direct and indirect objects and some phrases used in modern [[Persian language|Persian]] and Tajik have maintained this suffix on indirect objects, as seen in the following example: (\u0425\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e \u0448\u0443\u043a\u0440 ''Xudo-ro \u0161ukr'' - \"Thank God\"). Modern [[Persian language|Persian]] does not use the direct object marker as a suffix on the noun, but rather, as a stand-alone [[morpheme]].<ref name=\"Khojayori, Nasrullo 2009\"/>\n\n===Prepositions===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Simple prepositions\n|-\n!

Most modern [[loan word]]s in Tajik come from [[Russian language|Russian]] as a result of the position of Tajikistan within the [[Soviet Union]]. The vast majority of these Russian loanwords which have entered the Tajik language through the fields of socioeconomics, technology, and government, where most of the concepts and vocabulary of these fields have been borrowed from the Russian language. The introduction of Russian loanwords into the Tajik language was largely justified under the [[Soviet]] policy of modernization and the necessary subordination of all languages to Russian for the achievement of a [[Communist]] state.<ref>Marashi, Mehdi, and Mohammad Ali Jazayery. Persian Studies in North America: Studies in Honor of Mohammad Ali Jazayery. Bethesda, MD: Iran, 1994.</ref> Vocabulary also comes from the geographically close [[Uzbek language]] and, as is usual in [[Islam]]ic countries, from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Since the late 1980s, an effort has been made to replace loanwords with native equivalents, using either old terms that had fallen out of use, or coined terminology. Many of the coined terms for modern items such as \u0433\u0430\u0440\u043c\u043a\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a (''garmkunak''), meaning 'heater' and \u0447\u0430\u043d\u0433\u043a\u0430\u0448\u0430\u043a (''\u010dangka\u0161ak''), meaning 'vacuum cleaner' differ from their Afghan and Iranian equivalents, adding to the difficulty in intelligibility between Tajik and other forms of [[Persian language|Persian]].\n\nIn the table below, [[Persian language|Persian]] refers to the standard language of Iran, which differs somewhat from the [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]] Persian of Afghanistan.

In the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]], the use of the Latin script was later replaced in 1939 by the Cyrillic script.<ref>Windfuhr, Gernot. \"Persian and Tajik.\" The Iranian Languages. New York, NY: Routledge, 2009. 420.</ref> The Tajik alphabet added six additional letters to the Cyrillic script inventory and these additional letters are distinguished in the Tajik orthography by the use of diacritics.<ref>Windfuhr, Gernot. \"Persian and Tajik.\" The Iranian Languages.

While the New Persian language was descended primarily from [[Middle Persian]], it also incorporated substantial elements of other [[Middle Iranian languages|Iranian languages]] of ancient Central Asia, such as [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]].\n\nFollowing the [[Arab]] conquest of Iran and most of Central Asia in the 8th century AD, [[Arabic]] for a time became the court language, and [[Persian language|Persian]] and other Iranian languages were relegated to the private sphere. In the 9th century AD, following the rise of the [[Samanid]]s, whose state was centered around the cities of [[Bukhoro]] ([[Buxoro]]), [[Samarqand]] and [[Herat]], and covered much of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and northeastern Iran, New Persian emerged as the court language and swiftly displaced Arabic. Arabic influence continued to show itself in the form of the [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic]] script used to write the language (replaced in Tajik by Latin and then Cyrillic in the 20th century) and a large number of Arabic loanwords.\n\nNew Persian became the lingua franca of Central Asia for centuries, although it eventually lost ground to the [[Chaghatai language]] in much of its former domains as a growing number of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribes moved into the region from the east. Since the 16th century AD, Tajik has come under increasing pressure from neighboring [[Turkic languages]]. Once spoken in areas of [[Turkmenistan]], such as [[Merv]], Tajik is today virtually non-existent in that country. [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] has also largely replaced Tajik in most areas of modern Uzbekistan. Nevertheless, Tajik persisted in pockets, notably in Samarqand, Bukhoro and [[Surxondaryo Province]], as well as in much of what is today Tajikistan.\n\nThe [[Russian Empire]] in [[Russian Turkestan]] implemented [[Turkification]] upon the Ferghana and Sarmakand Tajiks replacing the Tajik language with Uzbek resulting in an Uzbek dominant speaking Samarkand whereas decades before Tajik was the dominant language in Samarkand.<ref name=\"NourzhanovBleuer2013\">{{cite book|author1=Kirill Nourzhanov|author2=Christian Bleuer|title=Tajikistan: A Political and Social History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nR6oAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA22#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=8 October 2013|publisher=ANU E Press|isbn=978-1-925021-16-5|pages=22\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe creation of the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]] within the [[Soviet Union]] in 1929 helped to safeguard the future of Tajik, as it became an official language of the republic alongside [[Russian language|Russian]]. Still, substantial numbers of Tajik-speakers remained outside the borders of the republic, mostly in the neighboring [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]], which created a source of tension between [[T\u0101jik people|Tajiks]] and [[Uzbeks]]. Neither Samarqand nor Bukhoro was included in the nascent Tajik S.S.R., despite their immense historical importance in Tajik history. After the creation of the Tajik S.S.R., a large number of ethnic Tajiks from the Uzbek S.S.R. migrated there, particularly to the region of the capital, [[Dushanbe]], exercising a substantial influence in the republic's political, cultural and economic life. The influence of this influx of ethnic Tajik immigrants from the Uzbek S.S.R. is most prominently manifested in the fact that literary Tajik is based on their northwestern dialects of the language, rather than the central dialects that are spoken by the natives in the Dushanbe region and adjacent areas.\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union and Tajikistan's independence in 1991, the government of Tajikistan has made substantial efforts to promote the use of Tajik in all spheres of public and private life. Tajik is gaining ground among the once-[[Russified]] upper classes, and continues its role as the vernacular of the majority of the country's population. There has been a rise in the number of Tajik publications. Increasing contact with media from Iran and Afghanistan, after decades of isolation under the Soviets, is also having an effect on the development of the language.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Tajikistan|Languages}}\n* [[Academy of Persian Language and Literature]]\n* [[Bukhori]]\n* [[Iranian people]]\n* [[Iranian Studies]]\n* [[List of Persian poets and authors]]\n* [[List of Tajik singers]]\n* [[Tajik alphabet]]\n* [[Tajik Wikipedia]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* Azim Baizoyev, John Hayward: [https://archive.org/details/BeginnerTajik A beginner's guide to Tajiki]. - 1. publ. - London [u. a.]: RoutledgeCurzon, 2004.

In [[Afghanistan]] (where the [[Tajiks|Tajik people]] minority forms the principal part of the wider Persophone population), this language is less influenced by [[Turkic languages]], is regarded as a form of [[Dari language|Dari]] and as such has co-official language status. The Tajik of Tajikistan has diverged from Persian as spoken in Afghanistan and [[Iran]] due to political borders, geographical isolation, the standardization process and the influence of [[Russian language|Russian]] and neighboring Turkic languages. The standard language is based on the northwestern dialects of Tajik (region of old major city of [[Samarqand]]), which have been somewhat influenced by the neighboring [[Uzbek language]] as a result of geographical proximity. Tajik also retains numerous archaic elements in its vocabulary, pronunciation and grammar that have been lost elsewhere in the Persophone world, in part due to its relative isolation in the mountains of [[Central Asia]].\n\n==Name==\n\nUp to and including the nineteenth century, speakers in Afghanistan and Central Asia had no separate name for the language and simply regarded themselves as speaking \"Farsi\" which is the [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] for the Persian language. The term \"Tajik\", derived from the Persian for \"foreigner\", was an exonym used by Turkic speakers to refer to Persian speakers (the word [[Tat people (Iran)|Tat]] has a similar origin), though since adopted by the speakers themselves.<ref>Ben Walter, ''Gendering Human Security in Afghanistan in a Time of Western Intervention'' (Routledge 2017), p. 51: for more details, see the article on [[Tajik people]].</ref>\n\nIn 1989, with the growth in [[T\u0101jik people|Tajik]] nationalism, a law was enacted declaring Tajik the [[official language|state language]]. In addition, the law officially equated Tajik with [[Persian language|Persian]], placing the word ''Farsi'' (the endonym for the Persian language) after Tajik. The law also called for a gradual reintroduction of the Perso-Arabic alphabet.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=sgW_HEcULMYC&pg=PA219&dq=tajikistan+alphabet+struggle&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9_6nUJOlO5KQ0QGV_4D4Cw&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=tajikistan%20alphabet%20struggle&f=false ed.

This Tajik diaspora is also the result of the poor state of the economy of Tajikistan, and each year approximately one million men leave Tajikistan in order to gain employment in Russia.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2013/07/201372393525174524.html | title=Tajikistan's missing men &#124; Tajikistan &#124; al Jazeera}}</ref>\n\n=== Dialects ===\nTajik dialects can be approximately split into the following groups:\n\n# Northern dialects ([[Sughd Region|Northern Tajikistan]], [[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and the [[Varzob]] valley region of [[Dushanbe]]).<ref name=\"Windfuhr, Gernot 2009\">Windfuhr, Gernot. \"Persian and Tajik.\" The Iranian Languages.

It is chiefly distinguished by the inclusion of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] terms, principally religious vocabulary, and a historical use of the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. Despite these differences, Bukhori is [[Mutual intelligibility|readily intelligible]] to other Tajik-speakers, particularly speakers of northern dialects.\n\nA very important moment in the development of the contemporary Tajik, especially of the spoken language, is the tendency in changing its dialectal orientation. The dialects of Northern Tajikistan were the foundation of the prevalent standard Tajik, while the Southern dialects did not enjoy either popularity or prestige. Now all politicians and public officials make their speeches in the Kulob dialect, which is also used in broadcasting.<ref>E.K. Sobirov (Institute of Linguistics, Russian Academy of Sciences).

Stress also does not fall on [[enclitic]]s, nor on the marker of the direct object.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Tajik grammar}}\nThe word order of Tajiki Persian is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]]. Tajik Persian grammar is almost identical to the classical Persian grammar (and the grammar of modern varieties such as Iranian Persian), although there are notable differences.<ref>Perry, J. R. 2005</ref> The most notable difference between classical Persian grammar and Tajik Persian grammar is the construction of the present progressive tense in each language. In Tajik, the present progressive form consists of a present progressive participle, from the verb \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043d ''istodan'' 'to stand', and a cliticized form of the verb -ac\u0442 ''-ast'' 'to be'.<ref name=Ido />\n<br />\n:{|\n|-\n| \u041c\u0430\u043d || \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0431 || \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0430 || \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0434\u0430-\u0430\u043c\n|-\n| ''man'' || ''maktub'' || ''navi\u0161ta'' || ''istoda-am''\n|-\n| I || letter || write || be\n|-\n|colspan=9| 'I am writing a letter.'\n|}\n\nIn Classical Persian, the present progressive form consists of the verb \u062f\u0627\u0631 ''d\u0101r'' 'to have' followed by a conjugated verb in either the simple present tense, the habitual past tense, or the habitual past perfect tense.<ref>Windfuhr, Gernot. Persian Grammar: History and State of Its Study. De Gruyter, 1979. Trends in Linguistics. State-Of-The-Art Reports.</ref>\n\n:{|\n|-\n|colspan=9|                \n|-\n| ''man'' || ''d\u0101r-am'' || ''k\u0101r'' || ''kon-am''\n|-\n| I || have || work || do\n|-\n|colspan=9|'I am working.'\n|}\n\n===Nouns===\n\nNouns are not marked for [[grammatical gender]], although they are marked for number.\n\nTwo forms of number exist in Tajik, singular and plural. The plural is marked by either the suffix -\u04b3\u043e ''-ho'' or -\u043e\u043d ''-on'' (with contextual variants -\u0451\u043d ''-yon'' and -\u0433\u043e\u043d ''-gon''), although Arabic loan words may use Arabic forms. There is no definite article, but the indefinite article exists in the form of the number \"one\" \u044f\u043a ''yak'',  and -\u0435 ''-e'', the first positioned before the noun and the second joining the noun as a suffix. When a noun is used as a [[direct object]], it is marked by the suffix -\u0440\u043e ''-ro'', e.g. \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0440\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043c (''Rustam-ro zadam''), \"I hit Rustam\". This direct object suffix is added to the word after any plural suffixes. The form -\u0440\u043e can be literary or formal. In older forms of the Persian language, -\u0440\u043e could indicate both direct and indirect objects and some phrases used in modern [[Persian language|Persian]] and Tajik have maintained this suffix on indirect objects, as seen in the following example: (\u0425\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e \u0448\u0443\u043a\u0440 ''Xudo-ro \u0161ukr'' - \"Thank God\"). Modern [[Persian language|Persian]] does not use the direct object marker as a suffix on the noun, but rather, as a stand-alone [[morpheme]].<ref name=\"Khojayori, Nasrullo 2009\"/>\n\n===Prepositions===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Simple prepositions\n|-\n!

Most modern [[loan word]]s in Tajik come from [[Russian language|Russian]] as a result of the position of Tajikistan within the [[Soviet Union]]. The vast majority of these Russian loanwords which have entered the Tajik language through the fields of socioeconomics, technology, and government, where most of the concepts and vocabulary of these fields have been borrowed from the Russian language. The introduction of Russian loanwords into the Tajik language was largely justified under the [[Soviet]] policy of modernization and the necessary subordination of all languages to Russian for the achievement of a [[Communist]] state.<ref>Marashi, Mehdi, and Mohammad Ali Jazayery. Persian Studies in North America: Studies in Honor of Mohammad Ali Jazayery. Bethesda, MD: Iran, 1994.</ref> Vocabulary also comes from the geographically close [[Uzbek language]] and, as is usual in [[Islam]]ic countries, from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Since the late 1980s, an effort has been made to replace loanwords with native equivalents, using either old terms that had fallen out of use, or coined terminology. Many of the coined terms for modern items such as \u0433\u0430\u0440\u043c\u043a\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a (''garmkunak''), meaning 'heater' and \u0447\u0430\u043d\u0433\u043a\u0430\u0448\u0430\u043a (''\u010dangka\u0161ak''), meaning 'vacuum cleaner' differ from their Afghan and Iranian equivalents, adding to the difficulty in intelligibility between Tajik and other forms of [[Persian language|Persian]].\n\nIn the table below, [[Persian language|Persian]] refers to the standard language of Iran, which differs somewhat from the [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]] Persian of Afghanistan. Another Iranian language, [[Pashto language|Pashto]], has also been included for comparative purposes.\n\n{|border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" class=\"wikitable\"\n!Tajik !! \u043c\u043e\u04b3<br /><small>(''moh'')</small> !! \u043d\u0430\u0432<br /><small>(''nav'')</small> !! \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440<br /><small>(''modar'')</small> !! \u0445\u043e\u04b3\u0430\u0440<br /><small>(''xohar'')</small> !! \u0448\u0430\u0431<br /><small>(''\u0161ab'')</small> !! \u0431\u0438\u043d\u04e3<br /><small>(''bin\u012b'')</small> !! \u0441\u0435<br /><small>(''se'')</small> !! \u0441\u0438\u0451\u04b3<br /><small>(''siyoh'')</small> !! \u0441\u0443\u0440\u0445<br /><small>(''surx'')</small> !! \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0434<br /><small>(''zard'')</small> !! \u0441\u0430\u0431\u0437<br /><small>(''sabz'')</small> !! \u0433\u0443\u0440\u0433<br /><small>(''gurg'')</small>\n|-\n! colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;

While the New Persian language was descended primarily from [[Middle Persian]], it also incorporated substantial elements of other [[Middle Iranian languages|Iranian languages]] of ancient Central Asia, such as [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]].\n\nFollowing the [[Arab]] conquest of Iran and most of Central Asia in the 8th century AD, [[Arabic]] for a time became the court language, and [[Persian language|Persian]] and other Iranian languages were relegated to the private sphere. In the 9th century AD, following the rise of the [[Samanid]]s, whose state was centered around the cities of [[Bukhoro]] ([[Buxoro]]), [[Samarqand]] and [[Herat]], and covered much of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and northeastern Iran, New Persian emerged as the court language and swiftly displaced Arabic. Arabic influence continued to show itself in the form of the [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic]] script used to write the language (replaced in Tajik by Latin and then Cyrillic in the 20th century) and a large number of Arabic loanwords.\n\nNew Persian became the lingua franca of Central Asia for centuries, although it eventually lost ground to the [[Chaghatai language]] in much of its former domains as a growing number of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribes moved into the region from the east. Since the 16th century AD, Tajik has come under increasing pressure from neighboring [[Turkic languages]]. Once spoken in areas of [[Turkmenistan]], such as [[Merv]], Tajik is today virtually non-existent in that country. [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] has also largely replaced Tajik in most areas of modern Uzbekistan. Nevertheless, Tajik persisted in pockets, notably in Samarqand, Bukhoro and [[Surxondaryo Province]], as well as in much of what is today Tajikistan.\n\nThe [[Russian Empire]] in [[Russian Turkestan]] implemented [[Turkification]] upon the Ferghana and Sarmakand Tajiks replacing the Tajik language with Uzbek resulting in an Uzbek dominant speaking Samarkand whereas decades before Tajik was the dominant language in Samarkand.<ref name=\"NourzhanovBleuer2013\">{{cite book|author1=Kirill Nourzhanov|author2=Christian Bleuer|title=Tajikistan: A Political and Social History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nR6oAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA22#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=8 October 2013|publisher=ANU E Press|isbn=978-1-925021-16-5|pages=22\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe creation of the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]] within the [[Soviet Union]] in 1929 helped to safeguard the future of Tajik, as it became an official language of the republic alongside [[Russian language|Russian]]. Still, substantial numbers of Tajik-speakers remained outside the borders of the republic, mostly in the neighboring [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]], which created a source of tension between [[T\u0101jik people|Tajiks]] and [[Uzbeks]]. Neither Samarqand nor Bukhoro was included in the nascent Tajik S.S.R., despite their immense historical importance in Tajik history. After the creation of the Tajik S.S.R., a large number of ethnic Tajiks from the Uzbek S.S.R. migrated there, particularly to the region of the capital, [[Dushanbe]], exercising a substantial influence in the republic's political, cultural and economic life. The influence of this influx of ethnic Tajik immigrants from the Uzbek S.S.R. is most prominently manifested in the fact that literary Tajik is based on their northwestern dialects of the language, rather than the central dialects that are spoken by the natives in the Dushanbe region and adjacent areas.\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union and Tajikistan's independence in 1991, the government of Tajikistan has made substantial efforts to promote the use of Tajik in all spheres of public and private life. Tajik is gaining ground among the once-[[Russified]] upper classes, and continues its role as the vernacular of the majority of the country's population. There has been a rise in the number of Tajik publications. Increasing contact with media from Iran and Afghanistan, after decades of isolation under the Soviets, is also having an effect on the development of the language.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Tajikistan|Languages}}\n* [[Academy of Persian Language and Literature]]\n* [[Bukhori]]\n* [[Iranian people]]\n* [[Iranian Studies]]\n* [[List of Persian poets and authors]]\n* [[List of Tajik singers]]\n* [[Tajik alphabet]]\n* [[Tajik Wikipedia]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* Azim Baizoyev, John Hayward: [https://archive.org/details/BeginnerTajik A beginner's guide to Tajiki]. - 1. publ. - London [u. a.]: RoutledgeCurzon, 2004.

[[Persian people|Persians]] contributed to the world of Mathematics alongside Arabs.\n\nIn the 9th century, the [[Persian people|Persian]] mathematician [[Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b]] wrote several important books on the Hindu\u2013Arabic numerals and on methods for solving equations. His book ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'', written about 825, along with the work of [[Al-Kindi]], were instrumental in spreading [[Indian mathematics]] and [[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system|Indian numerals]] to the West. The word ''[[algorithm]]'' is derived from the Latinization of his name, Algoritmi, and the word ''[[algebra]]'' from the title of one of his works, ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Al-Kit\u0101b al-mukhta\u1e63ar f\u012b h\u012bs\u0101b al-\u011fabr wa\u2019l-muq\u0101bala]]'' (''The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing'').

[[Galileo]] observed the moons of Jupiter in orbit about that planet, using a telescope based on a toy imported from Holland. [[Tycho Brahe]] had gathered an enormous quantity of mathematical data describing the positions of the planets in the sky. By his position as Brahe's assistant, [[Johannes Kepler]] was first exposed to and seriously interacted with the topic of planetary motion. Kepler's calculations were made simpler by the contemporaneous invention of [[logarithm]]s by [[John Napier]] and [[Jost B\u00fcrgi]]. Kepler succeeded in formulating mathematical laws of planetary motion.<ref>{{cite book\n | last =Struik\n | first =Dirk\n | title =A Concise History of Mathematics\n | publisher =Courier Dover Publications\n | edition =3rd.\n | year =1987\n | pages =[https://archive.org/details/concisehistoryof0000stru_m6j1/page/89 89]\n | isbn =978-0-486-60255-4\n | url =https://archive.org/details/concisehistoryof0000stru_m6j1/page/89\n }}</ref>\nThe [[analytic geometry]] developed by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] (1596\u20131650) allowed those orbits to be plotted on a graph, in [[Cartesian coordinates]].\n\nBuilding on earlier work by many predecessors, [[Isaac Newton]] discovered the laws of physics explaining [[Kepler's Laws]], and brought together the concepts now known as [[calculus]]. Independently, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who is arguably one of the most important mathematicians of the 17th century, developed calculus and much of the calculus notation still in use today. Science and mathematics had become an international endeavor, which would soon spread over the entire world.<ref>Eves, Howard, An Introduction to the History of Mathematics, Saunders, 1990, {{ISBN|0-03-029558-0}}, p. 379, \"...the concepts of calculus...(are) so far reaching and have exercised such an impact on the modern world that it is perhaps correct to say that without some knowledge of them a person today can scarcely claim to be well educated.\"</ref>\n\nIn addition to the application of mathematics to the studies of the heavens, [[applied mathematics]] began to expand into new areas, with the correspondence of [[Pierre de Fermat]] and [[Blaise Pascal]]. Pascal and Fermat set the groundwork for the investigations of [[probability theory]] and the corresponding rules of [[combinatorics]] in their discussions over a game of [[gambling]]. Pascal, with his [[Pascal's Wager|wager]], attempted to use the newly developing probability theory to argue for a life devoted to religion, on the grounds that even if the probability of success was small, the rewards were infinite. In some sense, this foreshadowed the development of [[utility theory]] in the 18th\u201319th century.\n\n=== 18th century ===\n[[File:Leonhard Euler.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Leonhard Euler]] by [[Emanuel Handmann]].]]\n\nThe most influential mathematician of the 18th century was arguably [[Leonhard Euler]]. His contributions range from founding the study of [[graph theory]] with the [[Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg]] problem to standardizing many modern mathematical terms and notations. For example, he named the square root of minus 1 with the symbol [[Imaginary unit|<span style=\"font-family:times new Roman;\">''i''</span>]], and he popularized the use of the Greek letter <math>\\pi</math> to stand for the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. He made numerous contributions to the study of topology, graph theory, calculus, combinatorics, and complex analysis, as evidenced by the multitude of theorems and notations named for him.\n\nOther important European mathematicians of the 18th century included [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], who did pioneering work in number theory, algebra, differential calculus, and the calculus of variations, and [[Laplace]] who, in the age of [[Napoleon]], did important work on the foundations of [[celestial mechanics]] and on [[statistics]].\n\n== Modern ==\n\n=== 19th century ===\n<!-- Modern period stars here:\n * Mathematical analysis: Bolzano, Cauchy, Riemann, Weierstrass\n * \"Purely existential\" proofs by Dedekind and Hilbert\n * Dirichlet's \"arbitrary function\"\n * Cantor's different kinds of infinity\n * Concentration on structures instead of calculation (abstract algebra, non-Euclidean geometry)\n * Institutionalization\n-->\n[[Image:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].]]\nThroughout the 19th century mathematics became increasingly abstract. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777\u20131855) epitomizes this trend. He did revolutionary work on [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of [[complex variable]]s, in [[geometry]], and on the convergence of [[series (mathematics)|series]], leaving aside his many contributions to science. He also gave the first satisfactory proofs of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] and of the [[quadratic reciprocity law]].\n\n[[Image:noneuclid.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Behavior of lines with a common perpendicular in each of the three types of geometry]]\nThis century saw the development of the two forms of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], where the [[parallel postulate]] of [[Euclidean geometry]] no longer holds.\nThe Russian mathematician [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] and his rival, the Hungarian mathematician [[J\u00e1nos Bolyai]], independently defined and studied [[hyperbolic geometry]], where uniqueness of parallels no longer holds. In this geometry the sum of angles in a triangle add up to less than 180\u00b0. [[Elliptic geometry]] was developed later in the 19th century by the German mathematician [[Bernhard Riemann]]; here no parallel can be found and the angles in a triangle add up to more than 180\u00b0. Riemann also developed [[Riemannian geometry]], which unifies and vastly generalizes the three types of geometry, and he defined the concept of a [[manifold]], which generalizes the ideas of [[curve]]s and [[Surface (topology)|surfaces]].\n\nThe 19th century saw the beginning of a great deal of [[abstract algebra]]. [[Hermann Grassmann]] in Germany gave a first version of [[vector space]]s, [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in Ireland developed [[noncommutative algebra]]. The British mathematician [[George Boole]] devised an algebra that soon evolved into what is now called [[Boolean algebra]], in which the only numbers were 0 and 1. Boolean algebra is the starting point of [[mathematical logic]] and has important applications in [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]].\n[[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], [[Bernhard Riemann]], and [[Karl Weierstrass]] reformulated the calculus in a more rigorous fashion.\n\nAlso, for the first time, the limits of mathematics were explored. [[Niels Henrik Abel]], a Norwegian, and [[\u00c9variste Galois]], a Frenchman, proved that there is no general algebraic method for solving polynomial equations of degree greater than four ([[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]]). Other 19th-century mathematicians utilized this in their proofs that straightedge and compass alone are not sufficient to [[trisect an arbitrary angle]], to construct the side of a cube twice the volume of a given cube, nor to construct a square equal in area to a given circle. Mathematicians had vainly attempted to solve all of these problems since the time of the ancient Greeks. On the other hand, the limitation of three [[dimension]]s in geometry was surpassed in the 19th century through considerations of [[parameter space]] and [[hypercomplex number]]s.\n\nAbel and Galois's investigations into the solutions of various polynomial equations laid the groundwork for further developments of [[group theory]], and the associated fields of [[abstract algebra]]. In the 20th century physicists and other scientists have seen group theory as the ideal way to study [[symmetry]].\n\nIn the later 19th century, [[Georg Cantor]] established the first foundations of [[set theory]], which enabled the rigorous treatment of the notion of infinity and has become the common language of nearly all mathematics. Cantor's set theory, and the rise of [[mathematical logic]] in the hands of [[Peano]], [[L.E.J. Brouwer]], [[David Hilbert]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[A.N. Whitehead]], initiated a long running debate on the [[foundations of mathematics]].\n\nThe 19th century saw the founding of a number of national mathematical societies: the [[London Mathematical Society]] in 1865, the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Math\u00e9matique de France]] in 1872, the [[Circolo Matematico di Palermo]] in 1884, the [[Edinburgh Mathematical Society]] in 1883, and the [[American Mathematical Society]] in 1888. The first international, special-interest society, the [[Quaternion Society]], was formed in 1899, in the context of a [[hyperbolic quaternion#Historical review|vector controversy]].\n\nIn 1897, Hensel introduced [[p-adic number]]s.\n\n=== 20th century === <!-- Hibert's problems, foundational crisis, Bourbaki -->\nThe 20th century saw mathematics become a major profession. Every year, thousands of new Ph.D.s in mathematics were awarded, and jobs were available in both teaching and industry. An effort to catalogue the areas and applications of mathematics was undertaken in [[Klein's encyclopedia]].\n\nIn a 1900 speech to the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], [[David Hilbert]] set out a list of [[Hilbert's problems|23 unsolved problems in mathematics]]. These problems, spanning many areas of mathematics, formed a central focus for much of 20th-century mathematics. Today, 10 have been solved, 7 are partially solved, and 2 are still open. The remaining 4 are too loosely formulated to be stated as solved or not.\n\n[[Image:Four Colour Map Example.svg|thumb|left|upright|A map illustrating the [[Four Color Theorem]]]]\nNotable historical conjectures were finally proven. In 1976, [[Wolfgang Haken]] and [[Kenneth Appel]] proved the [[four color theorem]], controversial at the time for the use of a computer to do so. [[Andrew Wiles]], building on the work of others, proved [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] in 1995. [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] and [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] proved that the [[continuum hypothesis]] is [[logical independence|independent]] of (could neither be proved nor disproved from) the [[ZFC|standard axioms of set theory]]. In 1998 [[Thomas Callister Hales]] proved the [[Kepler conjecture]].\n\nMathematical collaborations of unprecedented size and scope took place. An example is the [[classification of finite simple groups]] (also called the \"enormous theorem\"), whose proof between 1955 and 2004 required 500-odd journal articles by about 100 authors, and filling tens of thousands of pages. A group of French mathematicians, including [[Jean Dieudonn\u00e9]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]], publishing under the [[pseudonym]] \"[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]\", attempted to exposit all of known mathematics as a coherent rigorous whole. The resulting several dozen volumes has had a controversial influence on mathematical education.<ref>Maurice Mashaal, 2006. ''Bourbaki: A Secret Society of Mathematicians''. [[American Mathematical Society]]. {{ISBN|0-8218-3967-5|978-0-8218-3967-6}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Relativistic precession.svg|thumb|Newtonian (red) vs. Einsteinian orbit (blue) of a lone planet orbiting a star, with [[General relativity#Orbital effects and the relativity of direction|relativistic precession of apsides]]]]\n[[Differential geometry]] came into its own when [[Einstein]] used it in [[general relativity]]. Entirely new areas of mathematics such as [[mathematical logic]], [[topology]], and [[John von Neumann]]'s [[game theory]] changed the kinds of questions that could be answered by mathematical methods. All kinds of [[Mathematical structure|structures]] were abstracted using axioms and given names like [[metric space]]s, [[topological space]]s etc. As mathematicians do, the concept of an abstract structure was itself abstracted and led to [[category theory]]. [[Grothendieck]] and [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]] recast [[algebraic geometry]] using [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf theory]]. Large advances were made in the qualitative study of [[dynamical systems theory|dynamical systems]] that [[Henri Poincar\u00e9|Poincar\u00e9]] had begun in the 1890s.\n[[Measure theory]] was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Applications of measures include the [[Lebesgue integral]], [[Kolmogorov]]'s axiomatisation of [[probability theory]], and [[ergodic theory]]. [[Knot theory]] greatly expanded. [[Quantum mechanics]] led to the development of [[functional analysis]]. Other new areas include [[Laurent Schwartz]]'s [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution theory]], [[Fixed-point theorem|fixed point theory]], [[singularity theory]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Thom]]'s [[catastrophe theory]], [[model theory]], and [[Benoit Mandelbrot|Mandelbrot]]'s [[fractals]]. [[Lie theory]] with its [[Lie group]]s and [[Lie algebra]]s became one of the major areas of study.\n\n[[Non-standard analysis]], introduced by [[Abraham Robinson]], rehabilitated the [[infinitesimal]] approach to calculus, which had fallen into disrepute in favour of the theory of [[Limit of a function|limits]], by extending the field of real numbers to the [[Hyperreal number]]s which include infinitesimal and infinite quantities. An even larger number system, the [[surreal number]]s were discovered by [[John Horton Conway]] in connection with [[combinatorial game]]s.\n\nThe development and continual improvement of [[computer]]s, at first mechanical analog machines and then digital electronic machines, allowed [[industry]] to deal with larger and larger amounts of data to facilitate mass production and distribution and communication, and new areas of mathematics were developed to deal with this: [[Alan Turing]]'s [[computability theory]]; [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]]; [[Derrick Henry Lehmer]]'s use of [[ENIAC]] to further number theory and the [[Lucas-Lehmer test]]; [[R\u00f3zsa P\u00e9ter]]'s [[recursive function theory]]; [[Claude Shannon]]'s [[information theory]]; [[signal processing]]; [[data analysis]]; [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]] and other areas of [[operations research]]. In the preceding centuries much mathematical focus was on [[calculus]] and continuous functions, but the rise of computing and communication networks led to an increasing importance of [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] concepts and the expansion of [[combinatorics]] including [[graph theory]]. The speed and data processing abilities of computers also enabled the handling of mathematical problems that were too time-consuming to deal with by pencil and paper calculations, leading to areas such as [[numerical analysis]] and [[symbolic computation]]. Some of the most important methods and [[algorithm]]s of the 20th century are: the [[simplex algorithm]], the [[Fast Fourier Transform]], [[error-correcting code]]s, the [[Kalman filter]] from [[control theory]] and the [[RSA algorithm]] of [[public-key cryptography]].\n\nAt the same time, deep insights were made about the limitations to mathematics. In 1929 and 1930, it was proved the truth or falsity of all statements formulated about the [[natural number]]s plus one of addition and multiplication, was [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]], i.e. could be determined by some algorithm. In 1931, [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] found that this was not the case for the natural numbers plus both addition and multiplication; this system, known as [[Peano arithmetic]], was in fact [[incompleteness theorem|incompletable]]. (Peano arithmetic is adequate for a good deal of [[number theory]], including the notion of [[prime number]].) A consequence of G\u00f6del's two [[incompleteness theorem]]s is that in any mathematical system that includes Peano arithmetic (including all of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[geometry]]), truth necessarily outruns proof, i.e. there are true statements that [[Incompleteness theorem|cannot be proved]] within the system. Hence mathematics cannot be reduced to mathematical logic, and [[David Hilbert]]'s dream of making all of mathematics complete and consistent needed to be reformulated.\n\n[[Image:GammaAbsSmallPlot.png|thumb|right|The [[absolute value]] of the Gamma function on the complex plane.]]\nOne of the more colorful figures in 20th-century mathematics was [[Srinivasa Aiyangar Ramanujan]] (1887\u20131920), an Indian [[autodidact]] who conjectured or proved over 3000 theorems, including properties of [[highly composite number]]s, the [[partition function (number theory)|partition function]] and its [[asymptotics]], and [[Ramanujan theta function|mock theta functions]]. He also made major investigations in the areas of [[gamma function]]s, [[modular form]]s, [[divergent series]], [[General hypergeometric function|hypergeometric series]] and [[prime number]] theory.\n\n[[Paul Erd\u0151s]] published more papers than any other mathematician in history, working with hundreds of collaborators. Mathematicians have a game equivalent to the [[Kevin Bacon Game]], which leads to the [[Erd\u0151s number]] of a mathematician. This describes the \"collaborative distance\" between a person and Paul Erd\u0151s, as measured by joint authorship of mathematical papers.\n\n[[Emmy Noether]] has been described by many as the most important woman in the history of mathematics.<ref>{{citation|authorlink=Pavel Alexandrov|last=Alexandrov|first=Pavel S.|chapter=In Memory of Emmy Noether | title = Emmy Noether: A Tribute to Her Life and Work|editor1-first =James W | editor1-last = Brewer | editor2-first = Martha K | editor2-last = Smith | place = New York | publisher= Marcel Dekker | year= 1981 | isbn = 978-0-8247-1550-2 |pages= 99\u2013111}}.</ref> She studied the theories of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[algebra over a field|algebras]].\n\nAs in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: by the end of the century there were hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] was dozens of pages long.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classifications2000.pdf|title=Mathematics Subject Classification 2000}}</ref> More and more [[mathematical journal]]s were published and, by the end of the century, the development of the [[World Wide Web]] led to online publishing.\n\n=== 21st century ===\n{{See also|List of unsolved problems in mathematics#Problems solved since 1995}}\nIn 2000, the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] announced the seven [[Millennium Prize Problems]], and in 2003 the [[Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]] was solved by [[Grigori Perelman]] (who declined to accept an award, as he was critical of the mathematics establishment).\n\nMost mathematical journals now have online versions as well as print versions, and many online-only journals are launched.

It is likely the sexagesimal system was chosen because 60 can be evenly divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20 and 30.<ref name=\"Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 25\"/> Also, unlike the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values, much as in the [[decimal]] system.<ref name=\"Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26\"/> The power of the Babylonian notational system lay in that it could be used to represent fractions as easily as whole numbers; thus multiplying two numbers that contained fractions was no different than multiplying integers, similar to our modern notation.<ref name=\"Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26\"/> The notational system of the Babylonians was the best of any civilization until the [[Renaissance]],<ref name=\"Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 27\">{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=\"Mesopotamia\" p. 27}}</ref> and its power allowed it to achieve remarkable computational accuracy; for example, the Babylonian tablet [[YBC 7289]] gives an approximation of {{radic|2}} accurate to five decimal places.<ref name=\"Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 27\"/> The Babylonians lacked, however, an equivalent of the decimal point, and so the place value of a symbol often had to be inferred from the context.<ref name=\"Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26\"/> By the Seleucid period, the Babylonians had developed a zero symbol as a placeholder for empty positions; however it was only used for intermediate positions.<ref name=\"Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26\"/> This zero sign does not appear in terminal positions, thus the Babylonians came close but did not develop a true place value system.<ref name=\"Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26\"/>\n\nOther topics covered by Babylonian mathematics include fractions, algebra, quadratic and cubic equations, and the calculation of [[Regular number|regular]] [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] [[Twin prime|pairs]].<ref>{{cite book | authorlink = Aaboe | last = Aaboe | first = Asger | title = Episodes from the Early History of Mathematics | year = 1998 | publisher = Random House | location = New York | pages = 30\u201331}}</ref> The tablets also include multiplication tables and methods for solving [[linear equation|linear]], [[quadratic equation]]s and [[cubic equation]]s, a remarkable achievement for the time.<ref>{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=\"Mesopotamia\" p. 33}}</ref> Tablets from the Old Babylonian period also contain the earliest known statement of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].<ref>{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=\"Mesopotamia\" p. 39}}</ref> However, as with Egyptian mathematics, Babylonian mathematics shows no awareness of the difference between exact and approximate solutions, or the solvability of a problem, and most importantly, no explicit statement of the need for [[mathematical proof|proofs]] or logical principles.<ref name=\"Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 41\"/>\n\n== Egyptian ==\n{{Main|Egyptian mathematics}}\n[[File:Moskou-papyrus.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Image of Problem 14 from the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]].

Independently, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who is arguably one of the most important mathematicians of the 17th century, developed calculus and much of the calculus notation still in use today. Science and mathematics had become an international endeavor, which would soon spread over the entire world.<ref>Eves, Howard, An Introduction to the History of Mathematics, Saunders, 1990, {{ISBN|0-03-029558-0}}, p. 379, \"...the concepts of calculus...(are) so far reaching and have exercised such an impact on the modern world that it is perhaps correct to say that without some knowledge of them a person today can scarcely claim to be well educated.\"</ref>\n\nIn addition to the application of mathematics to the studies of the heavens, [[applied mathematics]] began to expand into new areas, with the correspondence of [[Pierre de Fermat]] and [[Blaise Pascal]]. Pascal and Fermat set the groundwork for the investigations of [[probability theory]] and the corresponding rules of [[combinatorics]] in their discussions over a game of [[gambling]]. Pascal, with his [[Pascal's Wager|wager]], attempted to use the newly developing probability theory to argue for a life devoted to religion, on the grounds that even if the probability of success was small, the rewards were infinite. In some sense, this foreshadowed the development of [[utility theory]] in the 18th\u201319th century.\n\n=== 18th century ===\n[[File:Leonhard Euler.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Leonhard Euler]] by [[Emanuel Handmann]].]]\n\nThe most influential mathematician of the 18th century was arguably [[Leonhard Euler]]. His contributions range from founding the study of [[graph theory]] with the [[Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg]] problem to standardizing many modern mathematical terms and notations. For example, he named the square root of minus 1 with the symbol [[Imaginary unit|<span style=\"font-family:times new Roman;\">''i''</span>]], and he popularized the use of the Greek letter <math>\\pi</math> to stand for the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. He made numerous contributions to the study of topology, graph theory, calculus, combinatorics, and complex analysis, as evidenced by the multitude of theorems and notations named for him.\n\nOther important European mathematicians of the 18th century included [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], who did pioneering work in number theory, algebra, differential calculus, and the calculus of variations, and [[Laplace]] who, in the age of [[Napoleon]], did important work on the foundations of [[celestial mechanics]] and on [[statistics]].\n\n== Modern ==\n\n=== 19th century ===\n<!-- Modern period stars here:\n * Mathematical analysis: Bolzano, Cauchy, Riemann, Weierstrass\n * \"Purely existential\" proofs by Dedekind and Hilbert\n * Dirichlet's \"arbitrary function\"\n * Cantor's different kinds of infinity\n * Concentration on structures instead of calculation (abstract algebra, non-Euclidean geometry)\n * Institutionalization\n-->\n[[Image:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].]]\nThroughout the 19th century mathematics became increasingly abstract. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777\u20131855) epitomizes this trend. He did revolutionary work on [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of [[complex variable]]s, in [[geometry]], and on the convergence of [[series (mathematics)|series]], leaving aside his many contributions to science. He also gave the first satisfactory proofs of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] and of the [[quadratic reciprocity law]].\n\n[[Image:noneuclid.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Behavior of lines with a common perpendicular in each of the three types of geometry]]\nThis century saw the development of the two forms of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], where the [[parallel postulate]] of [[Euclidean geometry]] no longer holds.\nThe Russian mathematician [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] and his rival, the Hungarian mathematician [[J\u00e1nos Bolyai]], independently defined and studied [[hyperbolic geometry]], where uniqueness of parallels no longer holds. In this geometry the sum of angles in a triangle add up to less than 180\u00b0. [[Elliptic geometry]] was developed later in the 19th century by the German mathematician [[Bernhard Riemann]]; here no parallel can be found and the angles in a triangle add up to more than 180\u00b0. Riemann also developed [[Riemannian geometry]], which unifies and vastly generalizes the three types of geometry, and he defined the concept of a [[manifold]], which generalizes the ideas of [[curve]]s and [[Surface (topology)|surfaces]].\n\nThe 19th century saw the beginning of a great deal of [[abstract algebra]]. [[Hermann Grassmann]] in Germany gave a first version of [[vector space]]s, [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in Ireland developed [[noncommutative algebra]]. The British mathematician [[George Boole]] devised an algebra that soon evolved into what is now called [[Boolean algebra]], in which the only numbers were 0 and 1. Boolean algebra is the starting point of [[mathematical logic]] and has important applications in [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]].\n[[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], [[Bernhard Riemann]], and [[Karl Weierstrass]] reformulated the calculus in a more rigorous fashion.\n\nAlso, for the first time, the limits of mathematics were explored. [[Niels Henrik Abel]], a Norwegian, and [[\u00c9variste Galois]], a Frenchman, proved that there is no general algebraic method for solving polynomial equations of degree greater than four ([[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]]). Other 19th-century mathematicians utilized this in their proofs that straightedge and compass alone are not sufficient to [[trisect an arbitrary angle]], to construct the side of a cube twice the volume of a given cube, nor to construct a square equal in area to a given circle. Mathematicians had vainly attempted to solve all of these problems since the time of the ancient Greeks. On the other hand, the limitation of three [[dimension]]s in geometry was surpassed in the 19th century through considerations of [[parameter space]] and [[hypercomplex number]]s.\n\nAbel and Galois's investigations into the solutions of various polynomial equations laid the groundwork for further developments of [[group theory]], and the associated fields of [[abstract algebra]]. In the 20th century physicists and other scientists have seen group theory as the ideal way to study [[symmetry]].\n\nIn the later 19th century, [[Georg Cantor]] established the first foundations of [[set theory]], which enabled the rigorous treatment of the notion of infinity and has become the common language of nearly all mathematics. Cantor's set theory, and the rise of [[mathematical logic]] in the hands of [[Peano]], [[L.E.J. Brouwer]], [[David Hilbert]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[A.N. Whitehead]], initiated a long running debate on the [[foundations of mathematics]].\n\nThe 19th century saw the founding of a number of national mathematical societies: the [[London Mathematical Society]] in 1865, the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Math\u00e9matique de France]] in 1872, the [[Circolo Matematico di Palermo]] in 1884, the [[Edinburgh Mathematical Society]] in 1883, and the [[American Mathematical Society]] in 1888. The first international, special-interest society, the [[Quaternion Society]], was formed in 1899, in the context of a [[hyperbolic quaternion#Historical review|vector controversy]].\n\nIn 1897, Hensel introduced [[p-adic number]]s.\n\n=== 20th century === <!-- Hibert's problems, foundational crisis, Bourbaki -->\nThe 20th century saw mathematics become a major profession. Every year, thousands of new Ph.D.s in mathematics were awarded, and jobs were available in both teaching and industry. An effort to catalogue the areas and applications of mathematics was undertaken in [[Klein's encyclopedia]].\n\nIn a 1900 speech to the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], [[David Hilbert]] set out a list of [[Hilbert's problems|23 unsolved problems in mathematics]]. These problems, spanning many areas of mathematics, formed a central focus for much of 20th-century mathematics. Today, 10 have been solved, 7 are partially solved, and 2 are still open. The remaining 4 are too loosely formulated to be stated as solved or not.\n\n[[Image:Four Colour Map Example.svg|thumb|left|upright|A map illustrating the [[Four Color Theorem]]]]\nNotable historical conjectures were finally proven. In 1976, [[Wolfgang Haken]] and [[Kenneth Appel]] proved the [[four color theorem]], controversial at the time for the use of a computer to do so. [[Andrew Wiles]], building on the work of others, proved [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] in 1995. [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] and [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] proved that the [[continuum hypothesis]] is [[logical independence|independent]] of (could neither be proved nor disproved from) the [[ZFC|standard axioms of set theory]]. In 1998 [[Thomas Callister Hales]] proved the [[Kepler conjecture]].\n\nMathematical collaborations of unprecedented size and scope took place. An example is the [[classification of finite simple groups]] (also called the \"enormous theorem\"), whose proof between 1955 and 2004 required 500-odd journal articles by about 100 authors, and filling tens of thousands of pages. A group of French mathematicians, including [[Jean Dieudonn\u00e9]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]], publishing under the [[pseudonym]] \"[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]\", attempted to exposit all of known mathematics as a coherent rigorous whole. The resulting several dozen volumes has had a controversial influence on mathematical education.<ref>Maurice Mashaal, 2006. ''Bourbaki: A Secret Society of Mathematicians''. [[American Mathematical Society]]. {{ISBN|0-8218-3967-5|978-0-8218-3967-6}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Relativistic precession.svg|thumb|Newtonian (red) vs. Einsteinian orbit (blue) of a lone planet orbiting a star, with [[General relativity#Orbital effects and the relativity of direction|relativistic precession of apsides]]]]\n[[Differential geometry]] came into its own when [[Einstein]] used it in [[general relativity]]. Entirely new areas of mathematics such as [[mathematical logic]], [[topology]], and [[John von Neumann]]'s [[game theory]] changed the kinds of questions that could be answered by mathematical methods. All kinds of [[Mathematical structure|structures]] were abstracted using axioms and given names like [[metric space]]s, [[topological space]]s etc. As mathematicians do, the concept of an abstract structure was itself abstracted and led to [[category theory]]. [[Grothendieck]] and [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]] recast [[algebraic geometry]] using [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf theory]]. Large advances were made in the qualitative study of [[dynamical systems theory|dynamical systems]] that [[Henri Poincar\u00e9|Poincar\u00e9]] had begun in the 1890s.\n[[Measure theory]] was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Applications of measures include the [[Lebesgue integral]], [[Kolmogorov]]'s axiomatisation of [[probability theory]], and [[ergodic theory]]. [[Knot theory]] greatly expanded. [[Quantum mechanics]] led to the development of [[functional analysis]]. Other new areas include [[Laurent Schwartz]]'s [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution theory]], [[Fixed-point theorem|fixed point theory]], [[singularity theory]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Thom]]'s [[catastrophe theory]], [[model theory]], and [[Benoit Mandelbrot|Mandelbrot]]'s [[fractals]]. [[Lie theory]] with its [[Lie group]]s and [[Lie algebra]]s became one of the major areas of study.\n\n[[Non-standard analysis]], introduced by [[Abraham Robinson]], rehabilitated the [[infinitesimal]] approach to calculus, which had fallen into disrepute in favour of the theory of [[Limit of a function|limits]], by extending the field of real numbers to the [[Hyperreal number]]s which include infinitesimal and infinite quantities. An even larger number system, the [[surreal number]]s were discovered by [[John Horton Conway]] in connection with [[combinatorial game]]s.\n\nThe development and continual improvement of [[computer]]s, at first mechanical analog machines and then digital electronic machines, allowed [[industry]] to deal with larger and larger amounts of data to facilitate mass production and distribution and communication, and new areas of mathematics were developed to deal with this: [[Alan Turing]]'s [[computability theory]]; [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]]; [[Derrick Henry Lehmer]]'s use of [[ENIAC]] to further number theory and the [[Lucas-Lehmer test]]; [[R\u00f3zsa P\u00e9ter]]'s [[recursive function theory]]; [[Claude Shannon]]'s [[information theory]]; [[signal processing]]; [[data analysis]]; [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]] and other areas of [[operations research]]. In the preceding centuries much mathematical focus was on [[calculus]] and continuous functions, but the rise of computing and communication networks led to an increasing importance of [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] concepts and the expansion of [[combinatorics]] including [[graph theory]]. The speed and data processing abilities of computers also enabled the handling of mathematical problems that were too time-consuming to deal with by pencil and paper calculations, leading to areas such as [[numerical analysis]] and [[symbolic computation]]. Some of the most important methods and [[algorithm]]s of the 20th century are: the [[simplex algorithm]], the [[Fast Fourier Transform]], [[error-correcting code]]s, the [[Kalman filter]] from [[control theory]] and the [[RSA algorithm]] of [[public-key cryptography]].\n\nAt the same time, deep insights were made about the limitations to mathematics. In 1929 and 1930, it was proved the truth or falsity of all statements formulated about the [[natural number]]s plus one of addition and multiplication, was [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]], i.e. could be determined by some algorithm. In 1931, [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] found that this was not the case for the natural numbers plus both addition and multiplication; this system, known as [[Peano arithmetic]], was in fact [[incompleteness theorem|incompletable]]. (Peano arithmetic is adequate for a good deal of [[number theory]], including the notion of [[prime number]].) A consequence of G\u00f6del's two [[incompleteness theorem]]s is that in any mathematical system that includes Peano arithmetic (including all of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[geometry]]), truth necessarily outruns proof, i.e. there are true statements that [[Incompleteness theorem|cannot be proved]] within the system. Hence mathematics cannot be reduced to mathematical logic, and [[David Hilbert]]'s dream of making all of mathematics complete and consistent needed to be reformulated.\n\n[[Image:GammaAbsSmallPlot.png|thumb|right|The [[absolute value]] of the Gamma function on the complex plane.]]\nOne of the more colorful figures in 20th-century mathematics was [[Srinivasa Aiyangar Ramanujan]] (1887\u20131920), an Indian [[autodidact]] who conjectured or proved over 3000 theorems, including properties of [[highly composite number]]s, the [[partition function (number theory)|partition function]] and its [[asymptotics]], and [[Ramanujan theta function|mock theta functions]]. He also made major investigations in the areas of [[gamma function]]s, [[modular form]]s, [[divergent series]], [[General hypergeometric function|hypergeometric series]] and [[prime number]] theory.\n\n[[Paul Erd\u0151s]] published more papers than any other mathematician in history, working with hundreds of collaborators. Mathematicians have a game equivalent to the [[Kevin Bacon Game]], which leads to the [[Erd\u0151s number]] of a mathematician. This describes the \"collaborative distance\" between a person and Paul Erd\u0151s, as measured by joint authorship of mathematical papers.\n\n[[Emmy Noether]] has been described by many as the most important woman in the history of mathematics.<ref>{{citation|authorlink=Pavel Alexandrov|last=Alexandrov|first=Pavel S.|chapter=In Memory of Emmy Noether | title = Emmy Noether: A Tribute to Her Life and Work|editor1-first =James W | editor1-last = Brewer | editor2-first = Martha K | editor2-last = Smith | place = New York | publisher= Marcel Dekker | year= 1981 | isbn = 978-0-8247-1550-2 |pages= 99\u2013111}}.</ref> She studied the theories of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[algebra over a field|algebras]].\n\nAs in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: by the end of the century there were hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] was dozens of pages long.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classifications2000.pdf|title=Mathematics Subject Classification 2000}}</ref> More and more [[mathematical journal]]s were published and, by the end of the century, the development of the [[World Wide Web]] led to online publishing.\n\n=== 21st century ===\n{{See also|List of unsolved problems in mathematics#Problems solved since 1995}}\nIn 2000, the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] announced the seven [[Millennium Prize Problems]], and in 2003 the [[Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]] was solved by [[Grigori Perelman]] (who declined to accept an award, as he was critical of the mathematics establishment).\n\nMost mathematical journals now have online versions as well as print versions, and many online-only journals are launched. There is an increasing drive towards [[Open access (publishing)|open access publishing]], first popularized by the [[arXiv]].\n\n== Future ==\n{{Main|Future of mathematics}}\n\nThere are many observable trends in mathematics, the most notable being that the subject is growing ever larger, computers are ever more important and powerful, the application of mathematics to bioinformatics is rapidly expanding, and the volume of data being produced by science and industry, facilitated by computers, is explosively expanding.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[History of algebra]]\n* [[History of calculus]]\n* [[History of combinatorics]]\n* [[History of the function concept]]\n* [[History of geometry]]\n* [[History of logic]]\n* [[History of mathematical notation]]\n* [[History of numbers]]\n* [[History of number theory]]\n* [[History of statistics]]\n* [[History of trigonometry]]\n* [[History of writing numbers]]\n* [[Kenneth O.

If no goals are scored during extra time, the winners are decided by a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]]. In the final, which is played as a single match, if the score is level at the end of normal time, extra time is played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if the score is still level.<ref name=\"regulations\"/>\n<section begin=Format />\nThe mechanism of the draws for each round is as follows:\n*In the draw for the round of 16, the eight group winners are seeded, and the eight group runners-up are unseeded. The seeded teams are drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg.

If no goals are scored during extra time, the winners are decided by a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]]. In the final, which is played as a single match, if the score is level at the end of normal time, extra time is played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if the score is still level.<ref name=\"regulations\"/>\n<section begin=Format />\nThe mechanism of the draws for each round is as follows:\n*In the draw for the round of 16, the eight group winners are seeded, and the eight group runners-up are unseeded. The seeded teams are drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same group or the same association cannot be drawn against each other.\n*In the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals, there are no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association can be drawn against each other.
