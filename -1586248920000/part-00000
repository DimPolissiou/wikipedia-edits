{"title_page": "Decanter centrifuge", "text_new": "A [[centrifuge]] is a device that employs a high [[rotational speed]] to separate components of different [[Density|densities]]. This becomes relevant in the majority of industrial jobs where solids, liquids and gases are merged into a single mixture and the separation of these different phases is necessary. A '''decanter centrifuge''' (also known as [[solid bowl centrifuge]]) separates continuously solid materials from liquids in the slurry, and therefore plays an important role in the [[wastewater treatment]], chemical, oil, and food processing industries. There are several factors that affect the performance of a decanter centrifuge, and some design [[Heuristic|heuristics]] to be followed which are dependent upon given applications. \n\n== Operating principle ==\n\nThe operating principle of a decanter centrifuge is based on separation via [[buoyancy]]. Naturally, a component with a higher [[density]] would fall to the bottom of a mixture, while the less dense component would be suspended above it. A decanter centrifuge increases the rate of settling through the use of continuous rotation, producing a [[g-force]] equivalent to between 1000 and 4000 [[G's]]. This reduces the settling time of the components by a large magnitude, whereby mixtures previously having to take hours to settle can be settled in a matter of seconds using a decanter centrifuge. This form of separation enables more rapid and controllable results.\n\n=== How does it work ===\nThe feed product is pumped into the decanter centrifuge through the inlet. Feed goes into a horizontal bowl, which rotates. The bowl is composed of a cylindrical part and a conical part. The separation takes place in the cylindrical part of the bowl. The fast rotation generates [[centrifugal force|centrifugal forces]] up to 4000 x g. Under these forces, the solid particles with higher density are collected and compacted on the wall of the bowl. A scroll (also screw or screw conveyor) rotates inside the bowl at a slightly different speed. This speed difference is called the differential speed. This way the scroll is transporting the settled particles along the cylindrical part of the bowl and up to the end conical part of the bowl. At the smallest end of the conical part of the bowl, the dewatered solids leave the bowl via discharge opening. The clarified liquid leaves through a paring disc (internal centripetal pump).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alfalaval.com/products/separation/centrifugal-separators/decanters/foodec/|title=Foodec|website=www.alfalaval.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}</ref>\n\n=== 3-phase separation with a decanter ===\nWith a 3 phase decanter centrifuge, it is possible to separate 3 phases from each other in one process step only. For example, two liquids which cannot be mixed because of different densities (e.g. oil and water) are separated from a solids phase. The heavy liquid (water) collects in the middle between the oil and the solids layer. Thus the two liquids separated from each other can be drawn off from the decanter. The solids are transported via the scroll to the discharge openings as it happens also in 2-phase separation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hillerzentri.de/functioning-of-a-decanter-centrifuge.html|title=Functioning of a decanter centrifuge - Hiller separation & process|last=GmbH|first=Hiller|website=www.hillerzentri.de|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}</ref>\n\nTypical applications of 3-phase separation are the production of edible oils such as [[olive oil]], [[oil sludge]] processing, the production of [[biodiesel]] etc.\n\n== Parameters and influencing factors of the separation==\n=== Feed, throughput and residence time ===\nThrough the feed, the separation medium to be processed can be input into the centre of the infeed chamber of the scroll, where it is accelerated.

A characteristic feature of the bowl is its cylindrical/conical shape.\n\n=== Differential speed ===\nThere is a differential speed between the decanter bowl and the scroll, which is created by a gear unit on the industrial decanter centrifuges. The differential speed determines the solid content in the outfeed.\n\n=== Filling volume / Weir discs or overflow weir ===\nPond depth / Weir discs\n\nThe clarified liquid flows to the cylindrical end of the bowl in the decanter centrifuge, from where it runs out through openings in the bowl cover. These openings contain precisely adjustable weir discs/weir plates by means of which the pond depth in the bowl can be set. The weir discs determine the filling volume of the bowl.\n\n== Range of applications ==\n\nThe main application of decanter centrifuges is to separate large amounts of solids from liquids on a continuous basis.

Hard surfacing and abrasion protection materials are required for the scroll to reduce wear and therefore reduce the maintenance of the scroll wear.\n\n== Designs available ==\n\nThe main types of decanter centrifuges are the vertical orientation, horizontal orientation and Conveyor/Scroll.\n\nIn vertical decanter centrifuges, the rotating assembly is mounted vertically with its weight supported by a single bearing at the bottom or suspended from the top.<ref name=\"Perry's\" /> The gearbox and bowl are suspended from the drive head, which is connected to the frame.<ref name=\"Perry's\" /> The vertical decanter allows for high temperature and/or high-pressure operation due to the orientation and the rotational seals provided at one end.

A schematic diagram of a Horizontal Decanter Centrifuge]]\n\nIn conveyor decanter centrifuges the conveyor or scroll fits inside a rotating bowl and carries the solids settled against the wall, pushing them across a beach towards the underflow where the solids discharge. The conveyor allows for an increase in separation efficiency and feed capacity.\n\n== Decanter centrifuges process characteristics ==\n\nThe separation process in a decanter centrifuge relies on a few process characteristics such as centrifugal force or G-force, sedimentation rate and separating factor, differential speed between the conveyor and bowl, and clarity of the liquid discharge.\n\nDecanter centrifuges require a [[centrifugal force]] for the separation of the solids from the liquid. This characteristic is dependent on the radius of the centrifuge and its angular rotational speed. A decanter centrifuge applies a force equivalent to several thousand G's, which reduces the settling time of the particles. It is also favoured to maintain a large [[G-force]], which will result in an improved separation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hiller-us.com/sludge-dewatering.php |title=Sludge Dewatering Systems for Liquid/Solid Separation with a Decanter Centrifuge |publisher=Hiller Separation & Process |date= |accessdate=2013-11-04}}</ref>\n\nThe rate at which sedimentation occurs is an important characteristic of the decanter centrifuge [[separation process]]. The [[sedimentation]] rate is influenced by the particle size, the shapes of the particles, their differential densities and the viscosity between the particles and the liquid. This process characteristic can be improved by utilizing flocculating agents. The sedimentation rate is also dependent on the separating factor of the decanter centrifuge, which is related to the centrifugal force.<ref name=\"Perry's\" />\n\nThe exterior bowl and the scroll conveyor rotate at different high speeds. This differential speed between the two is accountable for the sedimentation throughout the decanter centrifuge cylinder. A high differential speed results in a smaller residence time of the cake settlement, so it is necessary to keep the cake thickness to a minimum to avoid impairing the discharge quality. Keeping the cake thickness to a minimum also aids in the improvement of the cake [[dewatering]] process. For this reason, it is necessary to obtain an optimal differential speed to balance the cake thickness and quality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wx-separate.com/3zs/art42.htm |title=Products-Products |publisher=Wuxi Zhongda Centrifugal Machinery Co., Ltd. |accessdate=2013-11-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015052200/http://www.wx-separate.com/3zs/art42.htm |archivedate=2013-10-15 }}</ref>\n\nThe characteristic above all affects the clarity of the liquid output which is dependent on the volumetric throughout rate,<ref name=\"Perry's\" /> where a higher flow rate will result in a poor liquid clarity. Another characteristic that influences the clarity of the liquid output is the differential speed. A low differential speed results in a better clarity, therefore, aiding in the separation process. The G-Force also plays a role in the clarity of the liquid discharge. Higher G-force results in an increase in the separation of the solid particles from the liquid and yields a better clarity.<ref name=\"Schwarz\">{{citation |last=Schwarz |first=Nils |title=Selecting the right centrifuge - The jargon demystified |url=http://www.sgconsulting.co.za/images/Selecting%20the%20right%20centrifuge.pdf |accessdate=2013-11-04}}</ref>\n\n== Design heuristics ==\n\nDesign heuristics are methods based on experience which serve the purpose of reducing the need for calculations with regards to equipment sizing, operating parameters or performance.\n\nOne of the important design heuristics to be considered when employing decanter centrifuges is the scale of the process. Decanter centrifuges should ideally be used in large scale processes. This is to optimise economic value since smaller scale processes do not necessarily require such costly equipment to attain the desired product.<ref name=\"Petrides2000\">{{citation |last=Petrides |first=Demetri |year=2000 |title=Bioprocess Design and Economics |url=http://people.ufpr.br/~meleiro/graduacao/tq066/Bioproc_Design.pdf |accessdate=2013-11-04 |isbn=0-19-512340-9}}</ref>\n\nAnother design heuristic to be considered is the length to diameter ratio of the decanter centrifuge. A length to diameter ratio of 2, 3 and 4 are commonly used. Decanter centrifuges with the same diameter but the longer length would have a higher capacity for conveying solids and attain a larger suspension volume, which would enhance the settling out of fine solids.<ref name=\"Schwarz\" />\n\nThe beach angle at the conical section of a decanter centrifuge is a design heuristic, which must also be taken into consideration. The slippage force acting on solids in the direction of the liquid pool increases by a large magnitude when solids exit the pool onto the beach. A decanter centrifuge possessing a small cone angle is able to produce a lower slippage force compared to a large cone angle. A low cone angle is beneficial when solids do not compact properly and possess a soft texture. Additionally, low cone angles result in a lower wear rate on the scroll and are beneficial when being used with very compact solids requiring a large magnitude of torque to move.<ref name=\"Schwarz\" />\n\nThe magnitude of centrifugal force being used must also be considered. Centrifugal force aids with dewatering but hinders the transport of cake in the dry beach. Hence, a tradeoff exists between cake conveyance and cake dewatering. A balance between the two is necessary for setting the pool and G-force for a particular application.<ref name=\"Perry's\" /> Additionally, a larger centrifuge will produce better separation than a smaller centrifuge with the same bowl speed as a greater G-force would be produced.<ref name=\"Schwarz\" />\n\nIn the cylindrical section of the decanter centrifuge, the pool should ideally be shallow in order to maximise G-force for separation. Alternatively, a deeper pool is advantageous when the cake layer is too thick and the finer particles entrain into the fast liquid stream since a thicker buffer liquid layer is present to help settle suspended solids. The compromise between cake dryness and clarity of centrate is to be considered. The reason behind this trade-off is that in losing fine solids to centrate, the cake with bigger particles is able to dewater more effectively which results in a drier cake. Optimal pool for a particular application should be identified through the conduction of tests.<ref name=\"Perry's\" />\n\nAnother important heuristic is the differential speed, which controls cake transport. A high differential speed would give rise to a high solids throughput. A high differential speed also reduces cake residence time.<ref name=\"Perry's\" />\n\n== Post-treatment systems ==\n\nThe production of a waste stream is small in comparison to the overall process output; however can still pose a number of significant problems. Firstly, the volume of waste in the process reduces the available volume to be used for the process. Direct disposal into the environment of especially oil wastes can be detrimental to the surroundings if a treatment is not applied. The post-treatment system applied to the waste product should depend on the specific treated product required.<ref>Hertle, A. 2012, Treat oily waste with decanter centrifuge plants, Hiller GmbH Vilsbiburg, Germany</ref> The objectives of post-treatment can range from achieving a product that can be safely disposed, recycled into the refining process or requires an adequate water phase to be re-used in the process.\n\nThe objectives of post-treatment vary between different industries where in order to perform an efficient and economical process; the decanter centrifuge must be tailored to the task at hand. In the food manufacturing industry, decanter centrifuges are utilised in oil extraction machines. An oil extraction machine can process up to fifteen metric tonnes per hour of organic wastes and are found either within the process plant or outdoors if designed for the climate.<ref>{{citation |last1=Langhauser |first1=Karen |date=2009-01-21 |title=From waste stream to revenue stream |url=http://www.foodmanufacturing.com/articles/2009/01/waste-stream-revenue-stream |newspaper=Food Manufacturing |accessdate=2013-11-04 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The waste material enters the inlet chute and is softened into a sludge which is then steam heated. This mixture then enters a three-phase decanter centrifuge, also known as a tricanter centrifuge.\n\nA tricanter centrifuge operates on a similar principle to decanter centrifuges but instead separates three phases, consisting of a suspended solids phase and two immiscible liquids.<ref name=\"Perry's\" /> Sedimentation of the suspended solids occurs as normal where they accumulate on the wall of the bowl and are conveyed out of the centrifuge. The two liquid phases are separated using a dual discharge system where the lighter liquid phase such as oil, is separated over a ring dam via gravity, and water, which is commonly the heavier liquid phase, is discharged using a stationary impeller under pressure. Each of the three components, solid, oil and water, are distributed to different storage tanks.\n\n== New development ==\n\nThe rapid development of the decanter centrifuge over the 20th century saw it expand into a vast range of over 100 industrial applications.<ref name=\"viscotherm\">{{citation|publisher=Viscotherm |year=2012 |title=Getting better centrifuge performance |place=Switzerland |url=http://viscotherm.com/images/New%20developments-e-Mar29-1.pdf |accessdate=2013-11-04 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Further development since then has seen the refinement of machine design and control methods, improving its overall performance, which allows the system to respond quickly to varying feed conditions. The newest development in decanter centrifuge technology aims to achieve enhanced control of the separation process occurring inside the decanter. The way in which manufacturers aim to address this is by utilising variable mechanical devices in the rotating part of the decanter centrifuge. To control the separation process, the operational parameters should be transferred from the rotating part to the stationary part of the decanter whilst also constantly controlling and maintaining the mechanical device inside the process region. This can be achieved using hydraulic and electronic transfer systems. A hydraulic drive motor is easily able to access the rotating area of the decanter centrifuge.\n\nThere are numerous manufacturers specialising in mechanical separation technology that have adopted these new designs into industry standard equipment. This advanced technology has allowed decanter centrifuges to operate up to 250 cubic metres per hour <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flottweg.com/product-lines/decanter/ |title=Flottweg centrifuges and decanter for solid-liquid separation |publisher=Flottweg}}</ref> and has developed numerous designs such as the Z8E decanter, known as the world's largest decanter centrifuge with an adjustable impeller, which supplies a torque of 24,000 newton metres. Other designs can reduce power consumption by up to thirty percent due to a large slurry discharge, and are best utilised in the water treatment industry.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Centrifuges]]\n[[Category:Water treatment]]\n[[Category:Waste treatment technology]]\n", "text_old": "A [[centrifuge]] is a device which employs a high [[rotational speed]] to separate components of different [[Density|densities]].

This orientation is the most common design implemented in the industry. \n \n[[File:Horizontal Decanter Centrifuge.png|thumb|center|500px|Figure 1. A schematic diagram of a Horizontal Decanter Centrifuge]]\n\nIn conveyor decanter centrifuges the conveyor or scroll fits inside a rotating bowl and carries the solids settled against the wall, pushing them across a beach towards the underflow where the solids discharge. The conveyor allows for an increase in separation efficiency and feed capacity.\n\n== Decanter centrifuges process characteristics ==\n\nThe separation process in a decanter centrifuge relies on a few process characteristics such as centrifugal force or G-force, sedimentation rate and separating factor, differential speed between the conveyor and bowl, and clarity of the liquid discharge.\n\nDecanter centrifuges require a [[centrifugal force]] for the separation of the solids from the liquid. This characteristic is dependent on the radius of the centrifuge and its angular rotational speed. A decanter centrifuge applies a force equivalent to several thousand G's, which reduces the settling time of the particles. It is also favoured to maintain a large [[G-force]], which will result in an improved separation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hiller-us.com/sludge-dewatering.php |title=Sludge Dewatering Systems for Liquid/Solid Separation with a Decanter Centrifuge |publisher=Hiller Separation & Process |date= |accessdate=2013-11-04}}</ref>\n\nThe rate at which sedimentation occurs is an important characteristic of the decanter centrifuge [[separation process]]. The [[sedimentation]] rate is influenced by the particle size, the shapes of the particles, their differential densities and the viscosity between the particles and the liquid. This process characteristic can be improved by utilizing flocculating agents. The sedimentation rate is also dependent on the separating factor of the decanter centrifuge, which is related to the centrifugal force.<ref name=\"Perry's\" />\n\nThe exterior bowl and the scroll conveyor rotate at different high speeds. This differential speed between the two is accountable for the sedimentation throughout the decanter centrifuge cylinder. A high differential speed results in a smaller residence time of the cake settlement, so it is necessary to keep the cake thickness to a minimum to avoid impairing the discharge quality. Keeping the cake thickness to a minimum also aids in the improvement of the cake [[dewatering]] process. For this reason, it is necessary to obtain an optimal differential speed to balance the cake thickness and quality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wx-separate.com/3zs/art42.htm |title=Products-Products |publisher=Wuxi Zhongda Centrifugal Machinery Co., Ltd. |accessdate=2013-11-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015052200/http://www.wx-separate.com/3zs/art42.htm |archivedate=2013-10-15 }}</ref>\n\nThe characteristic above all affects the clarity of the liquid output which is dependent on the volumetric throughout rate,<ref name=\"Perry's\" /> where a higher flow rate will result in a poor liquid clarity. Another characteristic that influences the clarity of the liquid output is the differential speed. A low differential speed results in a better clarity, therefore, aiding in the separation process. The G-Force also plays a role in the clarity of the liquid discharge. Higher G-force results in an increase in the separation of the solid particles from the liquid and yields a better clarity.<ref name=\"Schwarz\">{{citation |last=Schwarz |first=Nils |title=Selecting the right centrifuge - The jargon demystified |url=http://www.sgconsulting.co.za/images/Selecting%20the%20right%20centrifuge.pdf |accessdate=2013-11-04}}</ref>\n\n== Design heuristics ==\n\nDesign heuristics are methods based on experience which serve the purpose of reducing the need for calculations with regards to equipment sizing, operating parameters or performance.\n\nOne of the important design heuristics to be considered when employing decanter centrifuges is the scale of the process. Decanter centrifuges should ideally be used in large scale processes. This is to optimise economic value since smaller scale processes do not necessarily require such costly equipment to attain the desired product.<ref name=\"Petrides2000\">{{citation |last=Petrides |first=Demetri |year=2000 |title=Bioprocess Design and Economics |url=http://people.ufpr.br/~meleiro/graduacao/tq066/Bioproc_Design.pdf |accessdate=2013-11-04 |isbn=0-19-512340-9}}</ref>\n\nAnother design heuristic to be considered is the length to diameter ratio of the decanter centrifuge. A length to diameter ratio of 2, 3 and 4 are commonly used. Decanter centrifuges with the same diameter but the longer length would have a higher capacity for conveying solids and attain a larger suspension volume, which would enhance the settling out of fine solids.<ref name=\"Schwarz\" />\n\nThe beach angle at the conical section of a decanter centrifuge is a design heuristic, which must also be taken into consideration. The slippage force acting on solids in the direction of the liquid pool increases by a large magnitude when solids exit the pool onto the beach. A decanter centrifuge possessing a small cone angle is able to produce a lower slippage force compared to a large cone angle. A low cone angle is beneficial when solids do not compact properly and possess a soft texture. Additionally, low cone angles result in a lower wear rate on the scroll and are beneficial when being used with very compact solids requiring a large magnitude of torque to move.<ref name=\"Schwarz\" />\n\nThe magnitude of centrifugal force being used must also be considered. Centrifugal force aids with dewatering but hinders the transport of cake in the dry beach. Hence, a tradeoff exists between cake conveyance and cake dewatering. A balance between the two is necessary for setting the pool and G-force for a particular application.<ref name=\"Perry's\" /> Additionally, a larger centrifuge will produce better separation than a smaller centrifuge with the same bowl speed as a greater G-force would be produced.<ref name=\"Schwarz\" />\n\nIn the cylindrical section of the decanter centrifuge, the pool should ideally be shallow in order to maximise G-force for separation. Alternatively, a deeper pool is advantageous when the cake layer is too thick and the finer particles entrain into the fast liquid stream since a thicker buffer liquid layer is present to help settle suspended solids. The compromise between cake dryness and clarity of centrate is to be considered. The reason behind this trade-off is that in losing fine solids to centrate, the cake with bigger particles is able to dewater more effectively which results in a drier cake. Optimal pool for a particular application should be identified through the conduction of tests.<ref name=\"Perry's\" />\n\nAnother important heuristic is the differential speed, which controls cake transport. A high differential speed would give rise to a high solids throughput. A high differential speed also reduces cake residence time.<ref name=\"Perry's\" />\n\n== Post-treatment systems ==\n\nThe production of a waste stream is small in comparison to the overall process output; however can still pose a number of significant problems. Firstly, the volume of waste in the process reduces the available volume to be used for the process. Direct disposal into the environment of especially oil wastes can be detrimental to the surroundings if a treatment is not applied. The post-treatment system applied to the waste product should depend on the specific treated product required.<ref>Hertle, A. 2012, Treat oily waste with decanter centrifuge plants, Hiller GmbH Vilsbiburg, Germany</ref> The objectives of post-treatment can range from achieving a product that can be safely disposed, recycled into the refining process or requires an adequate water phase to be re-used in the process.\n\nThe objectives of post-treatment vary between different industries where in order to perform an efficient and economical process; the decanter centrifuge must be tailored to the task at hand. In the food manufacturing industry, decanter centrifuges are utilised in oil extraction machines. An oil extraction machine can process up to fifteen metric tonnes per hour of organic wastes and are found either within the process plant or outdoors if designed for the climate.<ref>{{citation |last1=Langhauser |first1=Karen |date=2009-01-21 |title=From waste stream to revenue stream |url=http://www.foodmanufacturing.com/articles/2009/01/waste-stream-revenue-stream |newspaper=Food Manufacturing |accessdate=2013-11-04 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The waste material enters the inlet chute and is softened into a sludge which is then steam heated. This mixture then enters a three-phase decanter centrifuge, also known as a tricanter centrifuge.\n\nA tricanter centrifuge operates on a similar principle to decanter centrifuges but instead separates three phases, consisting of a suspended solids phase and two immiscible liquids.<ref name=\"Perry's\" /> Sedimentation of the suspended solids occurs as normal where they accumulate on the wall of the bowl and are conveyed out of the centrifuge. The two liquid phases are separated using a dual discharge system where the lighter liquid phase such as oil, is separated over a ring dam via gravity, and water, which is commonly the heavier liquid phase, is discharged using a stationary impeller under pressure. Each of the three components, solid, oil and water, are distributed to different storage tanks.\n\n== New development ==\n\nThe rapid development of the decanter centrifuge over the 20th century saw it expand into a vast range of over 100 industrial applications.<ref name=\"viscotherm\">{{citation|publisher=Viscotherm |year=2012 |title=Getting better centrifuge performance |place=Switzerland |url=http://viscotherm.com/images/New%20developments-e-Mar29-1.pdf |accessdate=2013-11-04 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Further development since then has seen the refinement of machine design and control methods, improving its overall performance, which allows the system to respond quickly to varying feed conditions. The newest development in decanter centrifuge technology aims to achieve enhanced control of the separation process occurring inside the decanter. The way in which manufacturers aim to address this is by utilising variable mechanical devices in the rotating part of the decanter centrifuge. To control the separation process, the operational parameters should be transferred from the rotating part to the stationary part of the decanter whilst also constantly controlling and maintaining the mechanical device inside the process region. This can be achieved using hydraulic and electronic transfer systems. A hydraulic drive motor is easily able to access the rotating area of the decanter centrifuge.\n\nThere are numerous manufacturers specialising in mechanical separation technology that have adopted these new designs into industry standard equipment. This advanced technology has allowed decanter centrifuges to operate up to 250 cubic metres per hour <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flottweg.com/product-lines/decanter/ |title=Flottweg centrifuges and decanter for solid-liquid separation |publisher=Flottweg}}</ref> and has developed numerous designs such as the Z8E decanter, known as the world's largest decanter centrifuge with an adjustable impeller, which supplies a torque of 24,000 newton metres. Other designs can reduce power consumption by up to thirty percent due to a large slurry discharge, and are best utilised in the water treatment industry.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Centrifuges]]\n[[Category:Water treatment]]\n[[Category:Waste treatment technology]]\n", "name_user": "Martin Borsje", "label": "safe", "comment": "language improvement", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decanter_centrifuge"}

The tune spread through a generation of aspiring guitarists, changing its spelling as it went. Before the record was released, [[Bert Jansch]] had learnt it from a 1961 tape borrowed from Len Partridge. Jansch included it on his 1965 debut album as \"Angie\". The spelling ''Anji'' became the more widely used after it appeared on [[Simon & Garfunkel]]'s 1966 album ''[[Sounds of Silence (album)|Sounds of Silence]]''.{{Contradict-inline|The Sound of Silence|reason=According to [[The Sound of Silence]], the release date would be September 12, 1965.|date=September 2019}} In 1969, the same name for [[Chicken Shack]]'s ''100 Ton Chicken'' was used.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nAnji soon became a rite of passage for many acoustic finger-style guitarists. [[Arlen Roth]] has recorded \"Anji\" on two separate albums of his.\n\nSome other musicians of note who have covered Anji are [[John Renbourn]], [[Lillebj\u00f8rn Nilsen]], [[Gordon Giltrap]], Clive Carroll and the anarchist group [[Chumbawamba]], who used the guitar piece as a basis for their anti-war song \"[[Jacob's Ladder (Not in My Name)]]\".{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} added\n\nAngi is the second track on the first CD of the Topic Records 70 year anniversary boxed set ''[[Three Score and Ten]]''.\n\n===Folk fame===\nDavy Graham came to the attention of guitarists through his appearance in a 1959 broadcast of the [[BBC TV]] arts series ''Monitor'', produced by [[Ken Russell]] and titled ''Hound Dogs and Bach Addicts: The Guitar Craze'', in which he played an acoustic instrumental version of \"[[Cry Me a River (1953 song)|Cry Me a River]]\".<ref name=timesobit/> During the 1960s, Graham released a string of albums of music from all around the world in all kinds of genres. 1964's ''[[Folk, Blues and Beyond]]'' and the following year's collaboration with the folk singer [[Shirley Collins]], ''Folk Roots, New Routes'', are frequently cited{{By whom|date=May 2013}} among his most influential album releases. ''[[Large as Life and Twice as Natural]]'' includes his cover of [[Joni Mitchell]]'s \"[[Both Sides, Now]]\" alongside unprecedented explorations of Eastern Modes and scales played in Faustian takes on a Gibson J45 steel string guitar.\n\nHis continuous touring of the world as a beat mystic traveller, picking up and then recording different styles of music for the guitar, has resulted in many musicians crediting him with founding [[world music]].<ref>Simon Broughton, Mark Ellingham, Richard Trillo: ''World Music: The Rough Guide'', Rough Guides, 1999, {{ISBN|1-85828-635-2}}. p. 81. \"Graham, who worshipped blues gods like Big Bill Broonzy and Leadbelly and modern jazz icons Thelonious Monk and Charlie Mingus...was equally intrigued by far eastern music and indeed any other strange styles he chanced upon, and was constantly off on different tangents, inventing new fusion styles that no-one else could get near.

He inspired many famous practitioners of the fingerstyle acoustic guitar such as [[Bert Jansch]], [[Wizz Jones]], [[John Renbourn]], [[Martin Carthy]], [[John Martyn]], [[Paul Simon]] and [[Jimmy Page]],  who based his solo \"[[White Summer]]\" on Graham's \"She Moved Through the Fair\".  Graham is probably best known for his acoustic instrumental, \"[[Anji (song)|Anji]]\" and for popularizing [[DADGAD]] tuning, later widely adopted by acoustic guitarists.<ref>The [[DADGAD]] article, for example, lists users of this tuning, including [[M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 Domhnaill]], [[D\u00e1ith\u00ed Sproule]], [[Russian Circles]], [[Stan Rogers]], [[Jimmy Page]], [[Artie Traum]], [[Pierre Bensusan]], [[Eric Roche]], [[Laurence Juber]], [[Tony McManus (musician)|Tony McManus]], [[Bert Jansch]], [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]], [[Dick Gaughan]], [[Imaad Wasif]], [[Jeff Tweedy]], [[Paul McSherry]], [[DEPAPEPE]], [[Ben Chasny]] and [[Trey Anastasio]].</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nGraham was born in [[Market Bosworth]], Leicestershire, England,<ref name=\"Colin Harper: Dazzling Stranger\">\n{{cite book\n| last=Harper\n| first=Colin\n| title=Dazzling Stranger:Bert Jansch and the British Folk and Blues Revival\n| date=August 2006\n| edition=2nd\n| publisher=Bloomsbury\n| location=London\n| isbn=978-0-7475-8725-5}}</ref><ref name=\"BP\">\"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-38082496 Folk musician Davy Graham honoured with birthplace plaque]\", [[BBC]], 27 November 2016.

Colin Harper credits Graham with single-handedly inventing the concept of the folk guitar instrumental.<ref name=\"Colin Harper: Dazzling Stranger\"/> \"Angi\", named after his then girlfriend, appeared on his debut EP ''3/4 AD'' in April 1962. The tune spread through a generation of aspiring guitarists, changing its spelling as it went. Before the record was released, [[Bert Jansch]] had learnt it from a 1961 tape borrowed from Len Partridge. Jansch included it on his 1965 debut album as \"Angie\". The spelling ''Anji'' became the more widely used after it appeared on [[Simon & Garfunkel]]'s 1966 album ''[[Sounds of Silence (album)|Sounds of Silence]]''.{{Contradict-inline|The Sound of Silence|reason=According to [[The Sound of Silence]], the release date would be September 12, 1965.|date=September 2019}} In 1969, the same name for [[Chicken Shack]]'s ''100 Ton Chicken'' was used.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nAnji soon became a rite of passage for many acoustic finger-style guitarists. [[Arlen Roth]] has recorded \"Anji\" on two separate albums of his.\n\nSome other musicians of note who have covered Anji are [[John Renbourn]], [[Lillebj\u00f8rn Nilsen]], [[Gordon Giltrap]], Clive Carroll and the anarchist group [[Chumbawamba]], who used the guitar piece as a basis for their anti-war song \"[[Jacob's Ladder (Not in My Name)]]\".{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} added\n\nAngi is the second track on the first CD of the Topic Records 70 year anniversary boxed set ''[[Three Score and Ten]]''.\n\n===Folk fame===\nDavy Graham came to the attention of guitarists through his appearance in a 1959 broadcast of the [[BBC TV]] arts series ''Monitor'', produced by [[Ken Russell]] and titled ''Hound Dogs and Bach Addicts: The Guitar Craze'', in which he played an acoustic instrumental version of \"[[Cry Me a River (1953 song)|Cry Me a River]]\".<ref name=timesobit/> During the 1960s, Graham released a string of albums of music from all around the world in all kinds of genres. 1964's ''[[Folk, Blues and Beyond]]'' and the following year's collaboration with the folk singer [[Shirley Collins]], ''Folk Roots, New Routes'', are frequently cited{{By whom|date=May 2013}} among his most influential album releases. ''[[Large as Life and Twice as Natural]]'' includes his cover of [[Joni Mitchell]]'s \"[[Both Sides, Now]]\" alongside unprecedented explorations of Eastern Modes and scales played in Faustian takes on a Gibson J45 steel string guitar.\n\nHis continuous touring of the world as a beat mystic traveller, picking up and then recording different styles of music for the guitar, has resulted in many musicians crediting him with founding [[world music]].<ref>Simon Broughton, Mark Ellingham, Richard Trillo: ''World Music: The Rough Guide'', Rough Guides, 1999, {{ISBN|1-85828-635-2}}. p. 81. \"Graham, who worshipped blues gods like Big Bill Broonzy and Leadbelly and modern jazz icons Thelonious Monk and Charlie Mingus...was equally intrigued by far eastern music and indeed any other strange styles he chanced upon, and was constantly off on different tangents, inventing new fusion styles that no-one else could get near. The big rewards eluded him, but for many, Davy Graham was \u2014 still is \u2014 the man.\"</ref> However, though Graham recorded in a variety of genres and loved to play the [[oud]], he was no purist, absorbing all his influences into his own ever-expanding conception of the possibilities of guitar music. Quizzed, for instance, on his introduction of a [[chord progression]] into an [[Arabic maqam]], his amiable retort was to the effect that, if he felt like it and it sounded alright, why shouldn't he?{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nDavy appears (uncredited) playing guitar in a pub in Joseph Losey's 1963 film \"the Servant\".\n\n===Retirement===\nGraham married the American singer [[Holly Gwinn]] in the late 1960s and recorded the albums ''The Holly Kaleidosope'' and ''Godington Boundary'' with her in 1970, shortly before Gwinn had to return to the US and he was unable to follow her, because of his visa problem due to a [[marijuana]] conviction.<ref name=guardianobit/>\nHe later described himself as having been \"a casualty of too much self-indulgence\",<ref name=timesobit/> becoming a heroin addict in imitation of his jazz heroes.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/3834429/Davy-Graham.html | location=London | work=The Telegraph | title=Obituary: Davy Graham | date=18 December 2008}}</ref> During this period, he taught acoustic guitar and also undertook charity work, particularly for various mental health charities. For several years he was on the executive council of [[Mind (charity)|Mind]]<ref name=timesobit/> and he was involved for some time with the mystic [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|Osho]] (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh).\n\nIn 1976 Graham recorded ''All That Moody'', essentially a private pressing that remains his most collectible vinyl record owing to its \"moody\" nature and rarity.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} He recorded two further groundbreaking albums for Kicking Mule, 1978's ''The Complete Guitarist'' and 1980's ''Dance For Two People''.\n\nHe continued to play concerts, but dedicated the main thrust of his life to studying languages; he was fluent in Gaelic, French, and Greek and could hold his own in Turkish. \nHe collected poems and folk songs and would regale his neighbours. After some time he became increasingly disinhibited. His penultimate album ''Playing in Traffic'' was so titled as he was frustrated by trying to learn Bach in the noise of 11 Lyme St, Camden where a boatyard used to operate on the canal just outside his bedroom.\n\n===Rediscovery and death===\nHe was the subject of a 2005 BBC Radio documentary, ''Whatever Happened to Davy Graham?''<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/radio2_aod.shtml?radio2%2Fr2_davygraham |title=Archived copy |access-date=13 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226042234/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/radio2_aod.shtml?radio2%2Fr2_davygraham |archive-date=26 February 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and in 2006 featured in the [[BBC Four]] documentary ''Folk Britannia''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/music/features/folk-britannia.shtml |title=BBC iPlayer - BBC Four |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-02-28}}</ref>\n\nMany people sought out Graham over the years and tried to encourage him to return to the stage to play live; the last of this long line of seekers was [[Mark Pavey]],{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} who arranged some outings with guitarists and old friends including [[Bert Jansch]], [[Duck Baker]] and [[Martin Carthy]].

It was announced in May 2015 and separated from [[Google+]], the company's former [[social network]].\n\nGoogle Photos gives users free, unlimited storage for photos up to 16&nbsp;[[megapixel]]s and videos up to 1080p&nbsp;[[Display resolution|resolution]]. The service automatically analyzes photos, identifying various visual features and subjects. Users can search for anything in photos, with the service returning results from three major categories: People, Places, and Things. The [[computer vision]] of Google Photos recognizes faces (not only those of humans, but pets as well), grouping similar ones together (this feature is only available in certain countries due to privacy laws); geographic landmarks (such as the [[Eiffel Tower]]); and subject matter, including birthdays, buildings, animals, food, and more. \n\nDifferent forms of [[machine learning]] in the Photos service allow recognition of photo contents,  automatically generate albums, animate similar photos into quick videos, surface past memories at significant times, and improve the quality of photos and videos. In May 2017, Google announced several updates to Google Photos, including reminders for and suggested sharing of photos, shared photo libraries between two users, and physical albums, with Photos automatically suggesting collections based on face, location, trip, or other distinction.\n\nGoogle Photos acts as a backup when photos are sent or in Google terms 'Shared'. This is just a common [[Remote backup service|backup tool]] when photos are shared between social media or other platforms or apps.\n\nGoogle Photos received critical acclaim after its decoupling from Google+ in 2015. Reviewers liked the updated Photos service for its recognition technology, search, apps, and loading times. Nevertheless, privacy concerns were raised, including Google's motivation for building the service, as well as its relationship to governments and possible laws requiring Google to hand over a user's entire photo history. Google Photos has seen strong user adoption. It reached 100&nbsp;million users after five months, 200&nbsp;million after one year, and 500&nbsp;million as of May 2017, with Google announcing that over 1.2&nbsp;billion photos are uploaded to the service every day, with the grand total of all uploaded content measuring over 13.7&nbsp;[[petabyte]]s of storage. For comparison, at the end of 2017, the entire [[Internet Archive]] held almost 40 petabytes.<ref>{{cite web|url=<!--https://archive.org/~tracey/mrtg/du.html-->|title=Used Paired Space|publisher=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Google Photos reached its 1 billion users mark.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708328/google-photos-users-gallery-go-1-billion|title=Google Photos passes the 1 billion users mark|first=Jon|last=Porter|date=July 24, 2019|website=The Verge}}</ref>\n\n== Features ==\nThe service has apps for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] operating systems, and a website.<ref name=\"Announcement\" /> Users back up their photos to the cloud service, which become accessible for all of their devices.<ref name=\"Recode review\" />\n\nThe Photos service analyzes and organizes images into groups and can identify features such as beaches, skylines, or \"snowstorm in Toronto\".<ref name=\"Announcement\"/> From the application's search window, users are shown potential searches for groups of photos in three major categories: People, Places, and Things.<ref name=\"Recode review\"/> The service analyzes photos for similar faces and groups them together in the People category.<ref name=\"Recode review\"/> It can also track faces as they age.<ref name=\"Announcement\"/> The Places category uses [[geotagging]] data but can also determine locations in older pictures by analyzing for major landmarks (e.g., photos containing the [[Eiffel Tower]]).<ref name=\"Recode review\"/> The Things category processes photos for their subject matter: birthdays, buildings, cats, concerts, food, graduations, posters, screenshots, etc. Users can manually remove categorization errors.<ref name=\"Recode review\"/>\n\nRecipients of shared images can view web galleries without needing to download the app.<ref name=\"Announcement\"/> Users can swipe their fingers across the screen to adjust the service's photo editing settings, as opposed to using sliders.<ref name=\"The Verge: hands\"/> Images can be easily shared with social networks (Google+, Facebook, [[Twitter]]) and other services.

Dvorak compared such a scenario to inviting others to \"scrounge through your underwear drawer\". He criticized the service's sync functions, and preferred folders of images over an unsorted \"flat database\". Dvorak also highlighted the service's poor choice of photos to animate and lack of longevity guarantees, considering the company's abrupt cancellation of [[Google Reader]].

It was announced in May 2015 and separated from [[Google+]], the company's [[social network]].\n\nGoogle Photos gives users free, unlimited storage for photos up to 16&nbsp;[[megapixel]]s and videos up to 1080p&nbsp;[[Display resolution|resolution]]. The service automatically analyzes photos, identifying various visual features and subjects. Users can search for anything in photos, with the service returning results from three major categories: People, Places, and Things. The [[computer vision]] of Google Photos recognizes faces (not only those of humans, but pets as well), grouping similar ones together (this feature is only available in certain countries due to privacy laws); geographic landmarks (such as the [[Eiffel Tower]]); and subject matter, including birthdays, buildings, animals, food, and more. \n\nDifferent forms of [[machine learning]] in the Photos service allow recognition of photo contents,  automatically generate albums, animate similar photos into quick videos, surface past memories at significant times, and improve the quality of photos and videos. In May 2017, Google announced several updates to Google Photos, including reminders for and suggested sharing of photos, shared photo libraries between two users, and physical albums, with Photos automatically suggesting collections based on face, location, trip, or other distinction.\n\nGoogle Photos acts as a backup when photos are sent or in Google terms 'Shared'. This is just a common [[Remote backup service|backup tool]] when photos are shared between social media or other platforms or apps.\n\nGoogle Photos received critical acclaim after its decoupling from Google+ in 2015. Reviewers liked the updated Photos service for its recognition technology, search, apps, and loading times. Nevertheless, privacy concerns were raised, including Google's motivation for building the service, as well as its relationship to governments and possible laws requiring Google to hand over a user's entire photo history. Google Photos has seen strong user adoption. It reached 100&nbsp;million users after five months, 200&nbsp;million after one year, and 500&nbsp;million as of May 2017, with Google announcing that over 1.2&nbsp;billion photos are uploaded to the service every day, with the grand total of all uploaded content measuring over 13.7&nbsp;[[petabyte]]s of storage. For comparison, at the end of 2017, the entire [[Internet Archive]] held almost 40 petabytes.<ref>{{cite web|url=<!--https://archive.org/~tracey/mrtg/du.html-->|title=Used Paired Space|publisher=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Google Photos reached its 1 billion users mark.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708328/google-photos-users-gallery-go-1-billion|title=Google Photos passes the 1 billion users mark|first=Jon|last=Porter|date=July 24, 2019|website=The Verge}}</ref>\n\n== Features ==\nThe service has apps for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] operating systems, and a website.<ref name=\"Announcement\" /> Users back up their photos to the cloud service, which become accessible for all of their devices.<ref name=\"Recode review\" />\n\nThe Photos service analyzes and organizes images into groups and can identify features such as beaches, skylines, or \"snowstorm in Toronto\".<ref name=\"Announcement\"/> From the application's search window, users are shown potential searches for groups of photos in three major categories: People, Places, and Things.<ref name=\"Recode review\"/> The service analyzes photos for similar faces and groups them together in the People category.<ref name=\"Recode review\"/> It can also track faces as they age.<ref name=\"Announcement\"/> The Places category uses [[geotagging]] data but can also determine locations in older pictures by analyzing for major landmarks (e.g., photos containing the [[Eiffel Tower]]).<ref name=\"Recode review\"/> The Things category processes photos for their subject matter: birthdays, buildings, cats, concerts, food, graduations, posters, screenshots, etc. Users can manually remove categorization errors.<ref name=\"Recode review\"/>\n\nRecipients of shared images can view web galleries without needing to download the app.<ref name=\"Announcement\"/> Users can swipe their fingers across the screen to adjust the service's photo editing settings, as opposed to using sliders.<ref name=\"The Verge: hands\"/> Images can be easily shared with social networks (Google+, Facebook, [[Twitter]]) and other services.

It lies 651 km south of Bangkok. It is the capital of [[Surat Thani Province]]. The city has a population of 132,040 (2019), and an area of 68.97 square kilometers. The city's population density is 1,914 inhabitants per km\u00b2. \n\nSurat Thani is near the mouth of the [[Tapi River, Thailand|Tapi River]] on the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. The city offers no major tourist attractions in itself, and is mainly known to tourists as the jumping-off point to [[Ko Samui]], [[Ko Tao]], and [[Ko Pha Ngan]]. It is the regional commercial center, with a seaport dealing in the main products of the province, rubber and coconuts.\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe city received its name, which means \"city of good people\", by King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI) in 1915. The name was given to the city due to the intense devotion of the locals to [[Buddhism]].

It lies 651 km south of Bangkok. It is the capital of [[Surat Thani Province]]. The city has a population of 132,040 (2019), and an area of 68.97 square kilometers. The city's population density is 1,914 inhabitants per km\u00b2. \n\nSurat Thani is near the mouth of the [[Tapi River, Thailand|Tapi River]] on the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. The city offers no major tourist attractions in itself, and is mainly known to tourists as the jumping-off point to [[Ko Samui]], [[Ko Tao]], and [[Ko Pha Ngan]]. It is the regional commercial center, with a seaport dealing in the main products of the province, rubber and coconuts.\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe city received its name, which means \"city of good people\", by King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI) in 1915. The name was given to the city due to the intense devotion of the locals to [[Buddhism]]. Previously the city was known as '''Bandon''' ({{lang-th|\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e19}}), meaning \"village on higher ground\". The name of the city is taken from the [[India]]n city [[Surat]] in [[Gujarat]] on the Indian River Tapi. King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI) gave this name to his city as he was impressed with the Indian city.\n\n==History==\nOn 21 December 1930 Surat Thani became a sanitary district (''[[sukhaphiban]]''),<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=47|issue=\u0e01|pages=271\u2013273|script-title=th:\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e21\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e42\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23 \u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e01\u0e32\u0e28 \u0e43\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e1a\u0e31\u0e0d\u0e0d\u0e31\u0e15\u0e34\u0e08\u0e31\u0e14\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e02\u0e32\u0e20\u0e34\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25 \u0e08\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 \u0e21\u0e13\u0e11\u0e25\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2473/A/271.PDF|format=PDF|date=December 21, 1930|language=Thai}}</ref> which was upgraded to a town (''[[thesaban mueang]]'') on 7 December 1935, with a municipal area of 2.67&nbsp;km\u00b2.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=51|issue=\u0e01|pages=1758\u20131762|script-title=th:\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e01\u0e24\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e35\u0e01\u0e32\u0e08\u0e31\u0e14\u0e15\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 \u0e08\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 \u0e1e\u0e38\u0e17\u0e18\u0e28\u0e31\u0e01\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a \u0e52\u0e54\u0e57\u0e58|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2478/A/1758.PDF|format=PDF|date=December 10, 1935|language=Thai}}</ref> The area of the municipality was enlarged to 6.95&nbsp;km\u00b2 on 14 October 1958,<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=75|issue=79 \u0e01|pages=555\u2013558|script-title=th:\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e01\u0e24\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e35\u0e01\u0e32\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e35\u0e48\u0e22\u0e19\u0e41\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e07\u0e40\u0e02\u0e15\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 \u0e08\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 \u0e1e.\u0e28. \u0e52\u0e55\u0e50\u0e51|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2501/A/079/555.PDF|format=PDF|date=October 14, 1958|language=Thai}}</ref> and on 22 December 1994 it was further enlarged to 68.97&nbsp;km\u00b2.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=111|issue=59 \u0e01|pages=29\u201332|script-title=th:\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e01\u0e24\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e35\u0e01\u0e32\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e35\u0e48\u0e22\u0e19\u0e41\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e07\u0e40\u0e02\u0e15\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 \u0e08\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 (\u0e09\u0e1a\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48 \u0e52) \u0e1e.\u0e28. \u0e52\u0e55\u0e53\u0e57|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2537/A/059/29.PDF\n|format=PDF|date=December 21, 1994|language=Thai}}</ref> On 4 May 2007, the town was upgraded to city status (''[[thesaban nakhon]]'').<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=124|issue=Special<!--\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e40\u0e28\u0e29--> 67 \u0e07|pages=15|script-title=th:\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e01\u0e32\u0e28\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e23\u0e27\u0e07\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e14\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 \u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07 \u0e40\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e35\u0e48\u0e22\u0e19\u0e41\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e07\u0e10\u0e32\u0e19\u0e30\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 \u0e2d\u0e33\u0e40\u0e20\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 \u0e08\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35 \u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2550/E/067/15.PDF|format=PDF|date=June 4, 2007|language=Thai}}</ref>\n\nSince 1969 Surat Thani is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Diocese of Surat Thani]], responsible for about 6,000 Catholics in southern Thailand.\n\n==Transportation==\n===Rail===\nSurat Thani is connected with [[Bangkok]] by the [[State Railway of Thailand#Southern Line|Southern Line]] of the [[State Railway of Thailand]].

He is currently signed to [[WWE]], where he performs on the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw brand]].\n\nAfter his successful amateur wrestling career at [[Bismarck State College]] and the [[University of Minnesota]], Lesnar signed with WWE (then the World Wrestling Federation) in 2000. He was assigned to its [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental]] [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW), where he was a three-time [[OVW Southern Tag Team Championship|OVW Southern Tag Team Champion]] with [[Shelton Benjamin]].

Following his match with [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] at [[WrestleMania XX]], Lesnar left WWE and pursued a career in the [[National Football League]] (NFL).<ref name=\"start NFL\"/> He was named a [[defensive tackle]] for the [[Minnesota Vikings]], but was cut prior to the start of the 2004 season.<ref name=\"NFL cut\"/> In 2005, Lesnar returned to professional wrestling and signed with [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW), where he won the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]] in his first match. After a contractual dispute with NJPW, he also wrestled as [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship (IGF)|IWGP Heavyweight Champion]] in the [[Inoki Genome Federation]] (IGF).\n\nIn 2006, Lesnar pursued a career in mixed martial arts (MMA), as he signed with [[Hero's]] and won his first fight, against [[Kim Min-soo (judoka)|Min-Soo Kim]], in June 2007.<ref name=\"MMA1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/a/elitexc-june2/?cur=page1|title=Brock Lesnar vs. Min Soo Kim|accessdate=March 22, 2008|publisher=UGO.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302160526/http://ugo.com/a/elitexc-june2/?cur=page1|archivedate=March 2, 2008}}</ref> He then signed with the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) the following October. Lesnar lost in his UFC debut against [[Frank Mir]] and then won his second fight against [[Heath Herring]]. In November 2008, Lesnar defeated [[Randy Couture]] to become the [[UFC Heavyweight Champion]]. Shortly after a successful title defense in a rematch with Mir, Lesnar was sidelined due to [[diverticulitis]].

Two years later, at [[WrestleMania XXX]], Lesnar defeated [[The Undertaker]] to end his [[The Streak (wrestling)|undefeated streak]] at [[WrestleMania]]. He achieved [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world champion]] status five times after this, having won the WWE World Heavyweight/WWE Championship in 2014 and 2019 as well as the [[WWE Universal Championship]] in 2017, 2018, and 2019. His first reign as Universal Champion was the longest world title reign in WWE since 1988 at 504 days (though recognized as 503 days by WWE), the sixth-longest world championship reign in the promotion's history. In June 2016, at ''[[UFC 199]]'', the UFC advertised Lesnar's return to fight at ''[[UFC 200]]'' even though he was still contracted with WWE.
