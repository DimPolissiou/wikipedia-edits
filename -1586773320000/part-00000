At age 11, he returned with widowed mother and children to Agnone, Italy, seat of the Marinelli family bell makers.  Leonidas graduated the Volta Institute of Naples, October, 1925. In January, 1926, he emigrated to New York City and supported himself as a meter tester while working his way through [[Cooper Union]] Night School of Electrical Engineering. In 1929 Dr. [[Gioacchino Failla]], former student of [[Marie Curie]], hired Marinelli at the biophysical laboratory at Memorial Cancer Hospital, New York City, known today as [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center]]).  Hardly a year later, Leonidas adapted the x-ray [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] unit for the measurement of low-level gamma ray radiation, not previously quantifiable, which made X-ray and radium radiation comparable by the same unit.  By 1933 he coauthored his first publication with [[Gioacchino Failla|Failla]], [[Edith Quimby]], and [[John E. Rose]]. In 1938 he completed all course requirements for the PhD at [[Columbia University]] and had published 5 papers in radiological journals.\n\n==Career and Profession==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nIn 1935 Marinelli became an Assistant [[Physicist]] \n\nIn the 1940s Marinelli became an independent [[scientist]].

At age 11, he returned with widowed mother and children to Agnone, Italy, seat of the Marinelli family bell makers.  Leonidas graduated the Volta Institute of Naples, October, 1925. In January, 1926, he emigrated to New York City and supported himself as a meter tester while working his way through [[Cooper Union]] Night School of Electrical Engineering. In 1929 Dr. [[Gioacchino Failla]], former student of [[Marie Curie]], hired Marinelli at the biophysical laboratory at Memorial Cancer Hospital, New York City, known today as [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center]]).  Hardly a year later, Leonidas adapted the x-ray [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] unit for the measurement of low-level gamma ray radiation, not previously quantifiable, which made X-ray and radium radiation comparable by the same unit.  By 1933 he coauthored his first publication with [[Gioacchino Failla|Failla]], [[Edith Quimby]], and [[John E. Rose]]. In 1938 he completed all course requirements for the PhD at [[Columbia University]] and had published 5 papers in radiological journals.\n\n==Career and Profession==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nIn 1935 Marinelli became an Assistant [[Physicist]] \n\nIn the 1940s Marinelli became an independent [[scientist]].

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond.

The report concluded that the crash was caused by a [[Buk missile system|Buk 9M38-series surface-to-air missile]] with a 9N314M [[warhead]]. The warhead detonated outside and above the left-hand side of the cockpit. The impact killed the three people in the cockpit and caused structural damage to the airplane leading to an in-flight break-up resulting in a wreckage area of 50 square kilometres and loss of the lives of all 298 occupants.<ref name=\"DSB_Final_Report\"/> Based on evidence they were able to exclude meteor strikes, the airplane having technical defects, a bomb, and an air-to-air attack as causes of the crash.

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond.

The report concluded that the crash was caused by a [[Buk missile system|Buk 9M38-series surface-to-air missile]] with a 9N314M [[warhead]]. The warhead detonated outside and above the left-hand side of the cockpit. The impact killed the three people in the cockpit and caused structural damage to the airplane leading to an in-flight break-up resulting in a wreckage area of 50 square kilometres and loss of the lives of all 298 occupants.<ref name=\"DSB_Final_Report\"/> Based on evidence they were able to exclude meteor strikes, the airplane having technical defects, a bomb, and an air-to-air attack as causes of the crash.

His wife, Sandra Newell, suggested modelling their [[tea service]] since they were sitting down for tea at the time. He sketched the teapot free-hand using graph paper and a pencil.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Utah Teapot - CHM Revolution|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/computer-graphics-music-and-art/15/206|website=Computer History Museum|accessdate=20 March 2016}}</ref> Following that, he went back to the computer laboratory and edited [[b\u00e9zier curve|b\u00e9zier]] control points on a [[Tektronix]] [[storage tube]], again by hand. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n[[File:Original Utah Teapot.jpg|thumb|The actual [[Melitta]] teapot that [[Martin Newell (computer graphics)|Martin Newell]] modelled, displayed at the [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]] (1990\u2013present)]]\n\nThe teapot shape contained a number of elements that made it ideal for the graphics experiments of the time: it was round, contained [[saddle point]]s, had a [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]] greater than zero because of the hole in the handle, could project a shadow on itself, and could be displayed accurately without a surface texture.\n\nNewell made the mathematical data that described the teapot's geometry (a set of three-dimensional [[coordinates]]) publicly available, and soon other researchers began to use the same data for their computer graphics experiments. These researchers needed something with roughly the same characteristics that Newell had, and using the teapot data meant they did not have to laboriously enter geometric data for some other object. Although technical progress has meant that the act of rendering the teapot is no longer the challenge it was in 1975, the teapot continued to be used as a reference object for increasingly advanced graphics techniques.\n\nOver the following decades, editions of computer graphics journals (such as the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[SIGGRAPH]]'s quarterly) regularly featured versions of the teapot: faceted or smooth-shaded, wireframe, bumpy, translucent, refractive, even leopard-skin and furry teapots were created.\n\nHaving no surface to represent its base, the original teapot model was not intended to be seen from below. Later versions of the [[data set]] fixed this.\n\nThe real teapot is ~33% taller (ratio 4:3){{citation needed|date=November 2011}} than the computer model. [[Jim Blinn]] stated that he scaled the model on the vertical axis during a demo in the lab to demonstrate that they could manipulate it. They preferred the appearance of this new version and decided to save the file out of that preference.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Seymour|first1=Mike|title=Founders Series: Industry Legend Jim Blinn |url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/founders-series-industry-legend-jim-blinn/|website=fxguide.com|accessdate=15 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729175832/http://www.fxguide.com/featured/founders-series-industry-legend-jim-blinn|archivedate=2012-07-29|date=2012-07-25}}</ref>\n\nThe original, physical teapot was purchased from [[Zions Co-operative Mercantile Institution|ZCMI]] (a department store in [[Salt Lake City]]) in 1974. It was donated to the [[The Computer Museum, Boston|Boston Computer Museum]] in 1984, where it was on display until 1990. It now resides in the ephemera collection at the [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]] where it is catalogued as \"Teapot used for Computer Graphics rendering\" and bears the catalogue number X00398.1984.<ref>{{cite web |title=Original Utah Teapot at the Computer History Museum |url=http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/X398.84 |website=Computer History Museum |date=2001-09-28}}</ref> Versions of the teapot are still sold today by Friesland Porzellan in Germany,<ref name=Teekanne/> who were the original makers of the teapot as they were once part of the Melitta Group.<ref name=FrieslandPorzel/>\n\nVersions of the teapot model \u2014 or sample scenes containing it \u2014 are distributed with or freely available for nearly every current rendering and modelling program and even many graphic [[API]]s, including [[AutoCAD]], [[Houdini (software)|Houdini]], [[Lightwave 3D]], [[Modo (software)|MODO]], [[POV-Ray]], [[3ds Max]], and the [[OpenGL]] and [[Direct3D]] helper libraries. Some [[RenderMan Interface Specification|RenderMan]]-compliant [[rendering (computer graphics)|renderers]] support the teapot as a built-in geometry by calling <code>RiGeometry(\"teapot\", RI_NULL)</code>. Along with the expected cubes and spheres, the [[OpenGL Utility Toolkit|GLUT]] library even provides the function <code>glutSolidTeapot()</code> as a graphics primitive, as does its [[Direct3D]] counterpart [[D3DX]] (<code>D3DXCreateTeapot()</code>). However version 11 of DirectX does not provide this functionality anymore. Mac OS X Tiger and Leopard also include the teapot as part of [[Quartz Composer]]; Leopard's teapot supports [[bump mapping]]. [[BeOS]] included a small demo of a rotating 3D teapot, intended to show off the platform's multimedia facilities.\n\nTeapot scenes are commonly used for renderer self-tests and benchmarks.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wald |first=Ingo |first2=Carsten |last2=Benthin |first3=Philipp |last3=Slusallek |title=A Simple and Practical Method for Interactive Ray Tracing of Dynamic Scenes |journal=Technical Report, Computer Graphics Group |year=2002 |url=http://graphics.cg.uni-saarland.de/fileadmin/cguds/papers/2002/DynRT/DynamicRayTracing.pdf |publisher=Saarland University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323191204/http://graphics.cg.uni-saarland.de/fileadmin/cguds/papers/2002/DynRT/DynamicRayTracing.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Klimaszewski |first=K. |last2=Sederberg |first2=T.W. |title=Faster ray tracing using adaptive grids |journal=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications |year=1997 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=42\u201351 |doi=10.1109/38.576857 |url=https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1669&context=facpub }}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n[[File:The Six Platonic Solids.png|thumb|right|\"The Six Platonic Solids\", an image that includes the Utah teapot as among the standard [[Platonic solid]]s]]\nOne famous [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray-traced]] image, by [[James Arvo]] and David Kirk in 1987,<ref name=\"Arvo_1987\">{{cite journal |first1= James |last1= Arvo |first2= David |last2= Kirk |title= Fast ray tracing by ray classification |year= 1987 |journal= [[SIGGRAPH]] |volume= 21 |issue= 4 |pages= 55\u201364 |doi= 10.1145/37402.37409 }}</ref> shows six stone columns, five of which are surmounted by the [[Platonic solid]]s ([[tetrahedron]], [[cube]], [[octahedron]], [[dodecahedron]], [[icosahedron]]).

His wife, Sandra Newell, suggested modelling their [[tea service]] since they were sitting down for tea at the time. He sketched the teapot free-hand using graph paper and a pencil.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Utah Teapot - CHM Revolution|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/computer-graphics-music-and-art/15/206|website=Computer History Museum|accessdate=20 March 2016}}</ref> Following that, he went back to the computer laboratory and edited [[b\u00e9zier curve|b\u00e9zier]] control points on a [[Tektronix]] [[storage tube]], again by hand. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n[[File:Original Utah Teapot.jpg|thumb|The actual [[Melitta]] teapot that [[Martin Newell (computer graphics)|Martin Newell]] modelled, displayed at the [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]] (1990\u2013present)]]\n\nThe teapot shape contained a number of elements that made it ideal for the graphics experiments of the time: it was round, contained [[saddle point]]s, had a [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]] greater than zero because of the hole in the handle, could project a shadow on itself, and could be displayed accurately without a surface texture.\n\nNewell made the mathematical data that described the teapot's geometry (a set of three-dimensional [[coordinates]]) publicly available, and soon other researchers began to use the same data for their computer graphics experiments. These researchers needed something with roughly the same characteristics that Newell had, and using the teapot data meant they did not have to laboriously enter geometric data for some other object. Although technical progress has meant that the act of rendering the teapot is no longer the challenge it was in 1975, the teapot continued to be used as a reference object for increasingly advanced graphics techniques.\n\nOver the following decades, editions of computer graphics journals (such as the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[SIGGRAPH]]'s quarterly) regularly featured versions of the teapot: faceted or smooth-shaded, wireframe, bumpy, translucent, refractive, even leopard-skin and furry teapots were created.\n\nHaving no surface to represent its base, the original teapot model was not intended to be seen from below. Later versions of the [[data set]] fixed this.\n\nThe real teapot is ~33% taller (ratio 4:3){{citation needed|date=November 2011}} than the computer model. [[Jim Blinn]] stated that he scaled the model on the vertical axis during a demo in the lab to demonstrate that they could manipulate it. They preferred the appearance of this new version and decided to save the file out of that preference.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Seymour|first1=Mike|title=Founders Series: Industry Legend Jim Blinn |url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/founders-series-industry-legend-jim-blinn/|website=fxguide.com|accessdate=15 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729175832/http://www.fxguide.com/featured/founders-series-industry-legend-jim-blinn|archivedate=2012-07-29|date=2012-07-25}}</ref>\n\nThe original, physical teapot was purchased from [[Zions Co-operative Mercantile Institution|ZCMI]] (a department store in [[Salt Lake City]]) in 1974. It was donated to the [[The Computer Museum, Boston|Boston Computer Museum]] in 1984, where it was on display until 1990. It now resides in the ephemera collection at the [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]] where it is catalogued as \"Teapot used for Computer Graphics rendering\" and bears the catalogue number X00398.1984.<ref>{{cite web |title=Original Utah Teapot at the Computer History Museum |url=http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/X398.84 |website=Computer History Museum |date=2001-09-28}}</ref> Versions of the teapot are still sold today by Friesland Porzellan in Germany,<ref name=Teekanne/> who were the original makers of the teapot as they were once part of the Melitta Group.<ref name=FrieslandPorzel/>\n\nVersions of the teapot model \u2014 or sample scenes containing it \u2014 are distributed with or freely available for nearly every current rendering and modelling program and even many graphic [[API]]s, including [[AutoCAD]], [[Houdini (software)|Houdini]], [[Lightwave 3D]], [[Modo (software)|MODO]], [[POV-Ray]], [[3ds Max]], and the [[OpenGL]] and [[Direct3D]] helper libraries. Some [[RenderMan Interface Specification|RenderMan]]-compliant [[rendering (computer graphics)|renderers]] support the teapot as a built-in geometry by calling <code>RiGeometry(\"teapot\", RI_NULL)</code>. Along with the expected cubes and spheres, the [[OpenGL Utility Toolkit|GLUT]] library even provides the function <code>glutSolidTeapot()</code> as a graphics primitive, as does its [[Direct3D]] counterpart [[D3DX]] (<code>D3DXCreateTeapot()</code>). However version 11 of DirectX does not provide this functionality anymore. Mac OS X Tiger and Leopard also include the teapot as part of [[Quartz Composer]]; Leopard's teapot supports [[bump mapping]]. [[BeOS]] included a small demo of a rotating 3D teapot, intended to show off the platform's multimedia facilities.\n\nTeapot scenes are commonly used for renderer self-tests and benchmarks.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wald |first=Ingo |first2=Carsten |last2=Benthin |first3=Philipp |last3=Slusallek |title=A Simple and Practical Method for Interactive Ray Tracing of Dynamic Scenes |journal=Technical Report, Computer Graphics Group |year=2002 |url=http://graphics.cg.uni-saarland.de/fileadmin/cguds/papers/2002/DynRT/DynamicRayTracing.pdf |publisher=Saarland University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323191204/http://graphics.cg.uni-saarland.de/fileadmin/cguds/papers/2002/DynRT/DynamicRayTracing.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Klimaszewski |first=K. |last2=Sederberg |first2=T.W. |title=Faster ray tracing using adaptive grids |journal=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications |year=1997 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=42\u201351 |doi=10.1109/38.576857 |url=https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1669&context=facpub }}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n[[File:The Six Platonic Solids.png|thumb|right|\"The Six Platonic Solids\", an image that includes the Utah teapot as among the standard [[Platonic solid]]s]]\nOne famous [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray-traced]] image, by [[James Arvo]] and David Kirk in 1987,<ref name=\"Arvo_1987\">{{cite journal |first1= James |last1= Arvo |first2= David |last2= Kirk |title= Fast ray tracing by ray classification |year= 1987 |journal= [[SIGGRAPH]] |volume= 21 |issue= 4 |pages= 55\u201364 |doi= 10.1145/37402.37409 }}</ref> shows six stone columns, five of which are surmounted by the [[Platonic solid]]s ([[tetrahedron]], [[cube]], [[octahedron]], [[dodecahedron]], [[icosahedron]]).
