The word ''steganography'' comes from New Latin ''steganographia'', which combines the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''stegan\u00f3s'' ({{wiktell|\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2}}), meaning \"covered or concealed\", and ''-graphia'' ({{wiktell|\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae}}) meaning \"writing\".<ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/steganography ]</ref>\n\nThe first recorded use of the term was in 1499 by [[Johannes Trithemius]] in his ''[[Steganographia]]'', a treatise on cryptography and steganography, disguised as a book on magic. Generally, the hidden messages appear to be (or to be part of) something else: images, articles, shopping lists, or some other cover text. For example, the hidden message may be in [[invisible ink]] between the visible lines of a private letter. Some implementations of steganography that lack a [[shared secret]] are forms of [[security through obscurity]], and key-dependent steganographic schemes adhere to [[Kerckhoffs's principle]].<ref name=stegokey>{{cite journal|last=Fridrich|first=Jessica|author2=M.

Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating in countries in which [[encryption]] is illegal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/11986/|title=Confounding Carnivore: How to Protect Your Online Privacy|publisher=[[AlterNet]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716093719/http://www.alternet.org/story/11986/|archivedate=2007-07-16|accessdate=2008-09-02|last=Pahati|first=OJ|date=2001-11-29}}</ref>\n\nWhereas cryptography is the practice of protecting the contents of a message alone, steganography is concerned both with concealing the fact that a secret message is being sent and its contents.\n\nSteganography includes the concealment of information within computer files. In digital steganography, electronic communications may include steganographic coding inside of a transport layer, such as a document file, image file, program or protocol. Media files are ideal for steganographic transmission because of their large size. For example, a sender might start with an innocuous image file and adjust the color of every hundredth [[pixel]] to correspond to a letter in the alphabet. The change is so subtle that someone who is not specifically looking for it is unlikely to notice the change.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Chart in the hand of Dr John Dee.

[[Wax tablet]]s were in common use then as reusable writing surfaces, sometimes used for shorthand.\n\nIn his work ''Polygraphiae,'' [[Johannes Trithemius]] developed his so-called \"[[Ave Maria Cipher|Ave-Maria-Cipher]]\" that can hide information in a Latin praise of God. \"''Auctor Sapientissimus Conseruans Angelica Deferat Nobis Charitas Potentissimi Creatoris''\" for example contains the concealed word ''VICIPEDIA''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0002/bsb00026190/images/index.html?seite=71|title=Polygraphiae (cf. p. 71f) |publisher = Digitale Sammlungen |language = German |accessdate=2015-05-27}}</ref>\n\n==Techniques==\n\n[[File:Steganography in the hand of John Dee.png|thumb|Deciphering the code.

This particular form of steganography is called a [[null cipher]].\n* Messages written in [[Morse code]] on [[yarn]] and then knitted into a piece of clothing worn by a courier.\n* Messages written on envelopes in the area covered by [[postage stamp]]s.\n* In the early days of the printing press, it was common to mix different typefaces on a printed page because the printer did not have enough copies of some letters in one typeface. Thus, a message could be hidden by using two or more different typefaces, such as normal or italic.\n*[[File:Microdot camera markiv.jpg|thumb|A [[microdot]] camera]]During and after World War II, [[espionage]] agents used photographically-produced [[microdot]]s to send information back and forth. Microdots were typically minute (less than the size of the [[full stop|period]] produced by a [[typewriter]]). World War II microdots were embedded in the paper and covered with an adhesive, such as [[collodion]] that was reflective and so was detectable by viewing against glancing light. Alternative techniques included inserting microdots into slits cut into the edge of postcards.\n* During World War II, [[Velvalee Dickinson]], a spy for [[Japan]] in [[New York City]], sent information to accommodation addresses in neutral [[South America]]. She was a dealer in [[doll]]s, and her letters discussed the quantity and type of doll to ship. The stegotext was the doll orders, and the concealed \"plaintext\" was itself encoded and gave information about ship movements, etc. Her case became somewhat famous and she became known as the Doll Woman.\n* During World War II, [[photosensitive glass]] was declared secret{{By whom|date=September 2019}}, and used for transmitting information to Allied armies.\n* [[Jeremiah Denton]] repeatedly blinked his eyes in [[Morse code]] during the 1966 televised press conference that he was forced into as an American [[prisoner-of-war]] by his North Vietnamese captors, spelling out \"T-O-R-T-U-R-E\". That confirmed for the first time to the [[US Naval Intelligence]] and other Americans that the North Vietnamese were torturing American prisoners-of-war.\n*In 1968, crew members of the [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|USS ''Pueblo'']] intelligence ship, held as prisoners by [[North Korea]], communicated in sign language during staged photo opportunities, to inform the United States that they were not defectors but captives of the North Koreans. In other photos presented to the US, crew members gave \"[[the finger]]\" to the unsuspecting North Koreans, in an attempt to discredit photos that showed them smiling and comfortable.\n\n=== Digital messages ===\n[[Image:Steganography original.png|frame|Image of a tree with a steganographically hidden image.

Some techniques of CPS/IoT steganography overlap with network steganography, i.e. hiding data in communication protocols used in CPS/the IoT. However, specific techniques hide data in CPS components. For instance, data can be stored in unused registers of IoT/CPS components and in the states of IoT/CPS actuators.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wendzel|first1=Steffen|last2=Mazurczyk|first2=Wojciech|last3=Haas|first3=Georg|title=Don't You Touch My Nuts: Information Hiding In Cyber Physical Systems Using Smart Buildings|journal=Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE Security & Privacy Workshops|language=English|publisher=IEEE}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tuptuk|first1=Nilufer|last2=Hailes|first2=Stephen|title=Covert channel attacks in pervasive computing|journal=Proceedings 2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)}}</ref>\n\n===Printed===\nDigital steganography output may be in the form of printed documents. A message, the ''[[plaintext]]'', may be first encrypted by traditional means, producing a ''[[ciphertext]]''. Then, an innocuous ''covertext'' is modified in some way so as to contain the ciphertext, resulting in the ''stegotext''. For example, the letter size, spacing, [[typeface]], or other characteristics of a covertext can be manipulated to carry the hidden message. Only a recipient who knows the technique used can recover the message and then decrypt it. [[Francis Bacon]] developed [[Bacon's cipher]] as such a technique.\n\nThe ciphertext produced by most digital steganography methods, however, is not printable.  Traditional digital methods rely on perturbing noise in the channel file to hide the message, and as such, the channel file must be transmitted to the recipient with no additional noise from the transmission.  Printing introduces much noise in the ciphertext, generally rendering the message unrecoverable.

However, some terms appear specifically in software and are easily confused. These are the most relevant ones to digital steganographic systems:\n\nThe ''payload'' is the data covertly communicated. The ''carrier'' is the signal, stream, or data file that hides the payload, which differs from the ''channel'', which typically means the type of input, such as a JPEG image. The resulting signal, stream, or data file with the encoded payload is sometimes called the ''package'', ''stego file'', or ''covert message''. The proportion of bytes, samples, or other signal elements modified to encode the payload is called the ''encoding density'' and is typically expressed as a number between 0 and 1.\n\nIn a set of files, the files that are considered likely to contain a payload are ''suspects''. A ''suspect'' identified through some type of statistical analysis can be referred to as a ''candidate''.\n\n==Countermeasures and detection==\nDetecting physical steganography requires careful physical examination, including the use of magnification, developer chemicals and [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]]. It is a time-consuming process with obvious resource implications, even in countries that employ many people to spy on their fellow nationals. However, it is feasible to screen mail of certain suspected individuals or institutions, such as prisons or prisoner-of-war (POW) camps.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], prisoner of war camps gave prisoners specially-treated [[paper]] that would reveal [[invisible ink]]. An article in the 24 June 1948 issue of ''Paper Trade Journal'' by the Technical Director of the [[United States Government Printing Office]] had Morris S. Kantrowitz describe in general terms the development of this paper. Three prototype papers (''Sensicoat'', ''Anilith'', and ''Coatalith'') were used to manufacture postcards and stationery provided to German prisoners of war in the US and Canada. If POWs tried to write a hidden message, the special paper rendered it visible. The US granted at least two [[patent]]s related to the technology, one to Kantrowitz, {{US Patent|2515232}}, \"Water-Detecting paper and Water-Detecting Coating Composition Therefor,\" patented 18 July 1950, and an earlier one, \"Moisture-Sensitive Paper and the Manufacture Thereof,\" {{US Patent|2445586}}, patented 20 July 1948. A similar strategy issues prisoners with writing paper ruled with a water-soluble ink that runs in contact with water-based invisible ink.\n\nIn computing, steganographically encoded package detection is called [[steganalysis]]. The simplest method to detect modified files, however, is to compare them to known originals. For example, to detect information being moved through the graphics on a website, an analyst can maintain known clean copies of the materials and then compare them against the current contents of the site. The differences, if the carrier is the same, comprise the payload. In general, using extremely high compression rates makes steganography difficult but not impossible. Compression errors provide a hiding place for data, but high compression reduces the amount of data available to hold the payload, raising the encoding density, which facilitates easier detection (in extreme cases, even by casual observation).\n\nThere are a variety of basic tests that can be done to identify whether or not a secret message exists. This process is not concerned with the extraction of the message, which is a different process and a separate step. The most basic approaches of [[steganalysis]] are visual or aural attacks, structural attacks, and statistical attacks. These approaches attempt to detect the steganographic algorithms that were used.<ref name=Wanyer2009>Wayner, Peter (2009). ''Disappearing Cryptography: Information Hiding : Steganography & Watermarking'', . Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Amsterdam;Boston.</ref> These algorithms range from unsophisticated to very sophisticated, with early algorithms being much easier to detect due to statistical anomalies that were present. The size of the message that is being hidden is a factor in how difficult it is to detect. The overall size of the cover object also plays a factor as well. If the cover object is small and the message is large, this can distort the statistics and make it easier to detect. A larger cover object with a small message decreases the statistics and gives it a better chance of going unnoticed.\n\nSteganalysis that targets a particular algorithm has much better success as it is able to key in on the anomalies that are left behind. This is because the analysis can perform a targeted search to discover known tendencies since it is aware of the behaviors that it commonly exhibits. When analyzing an image the least significant bits of many images are actually not random. The camera sensor, especially lower end sensors are not the best quality and can introduce some random bits. This can also be affected by the file compression done on the image. Secret messages can be introduced into the least significant bits in an image and then hidden.  A steganography tool can be used to camouflage the secret message in the least significant bits but it can introduce a random area that is too perfect. This area of perfect randomization stands out and can be detected by comparing the least significant bits to the next-to-least significant bits on image that hasn't been compressed.<ref name=Wanyer2009 />\n\nGenerally though, there are many techniques known to be able to hide messages in data using steganographic techniques. None are, by definition, obvious when users employ standard applications, but some can be detected by specialist tools. Others, however, are resistant to detection - or rather it is not possible to reliably distinguish data containing a hidden message from data containing just noise - even when the most sophisticated analysis is performed. Steganography is being used to hide cyber attacks, referred to as ''Stegware'', and detection is therefore not an adequate defence. The only way of defeating the threat is to transform data in a way that destroys any hidden messages,<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319943090|title=Defenders Guide to Steganography|year=2017|doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.21608.98561|last1=Wiseman|first1=Simon}}</ref> a process called [[Content Threat Removal]].\n\n==Applications==\n===Use in modern printers===\n{{Main|Printer steganography}}\nSome modern computer printers use steganography, including [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[Xerox]] brand color laser printers. The printers add tiny yellow dots to each page. The barely-visible dots contain encoded printer serial numbers and date and time stamps.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2005/10/16 |title=Secret Code in Color Printers Lets Government Track You; Tiny Dots Show Where and When You Made Your Print |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date=16 October 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Example from modern practice===\nThe larger the cover message (in binary data, the number of [[bit]]s) relative to the hidden message, the easier it is to hide the hidden message (as an analogy, the larger the \"haystack\", the easier it is to hide a \"needle\"). So [[digital image|digital picture]]s, which contain much data, are sometimes used to hide messages on the [[Internet]] and on other digital communication media. It is not clear how common this practice actually is.\n\nFor example, a 24-bit [[bitmap]] uses 8 bits to represent each of the three color values (red, green, and blue) of each [[pixel]]. The blue alone has 2<sup>8</sup> different levels of blue intensity. The difference between 11111111 and 11111110 in the value for blue intensity is likely to be undetectable by the human eye. Therefore, the [[least significant bit]] can be used more or less undetectably for something else other than color information. If that is repeated for the green and the red elements of each pixel as well, it is possible to encode one letter of [[ASCII]] text for every three [[pixel]]s.\n\nStated somewhat more formally, the objective for making steganographic encoding difficult to detect is to ensure that the changes to the carrier (the original signal) because of the injection of the payload (the signal to covertly embed) are visually (and ideally, statistically) negligible. The changes are indistinguishable from the [[noise floor]] of the carrier. All media can be a carrier, but media with a large amount of redundant or compressible information is better suited.\n\nFrom an [[information theory|information theoretical]] point of view, that means that the [[Communication channel|channel]] must have more [[channel capacity|capacity]] than the \"surface\" [[signal (information theory)|signal]] requires. There must be [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]]. For a digital image, it may be [[noise]] from the imaging element; for [[digital audio]], it may be noise from recording techniques or [[amplifier|amplification]] equipment. In general, electronics that digitize an [[analog (signal)|analog signal]] suffer from several noise sources, such as [[Johnson-Nyquist noise|thermal noise]], [[flicker noise]], and [[shot noise]]. The noise provides enough variation in the captured digital information that it can be exploited as a noise cover for hidden data. In addition, [[lossy compression]] schemes (such as [[JPEG]]) always introduce some error to the decompressed data, and it is possible to exploit that for steganographic use, as well.\n\nAlthough steganography and digital watermarking seem similar, they are not. In steganography, the hidden message should remain intact until it reaches its destination. Steganography can be used for [[digital watermark]]ing in which a message (being simply an identifier) is hidden in an image so that its source can be tracked or verified (for example, [[Coded Anti-Piracy]]) or even just to identify an image (as in the [[EURion constellation]]). In such a case, the technique of hiding the message (here, the watermark) must be robust to prevent tampering. However, digital watermarking sometimes requires a brittle watermark, which can be modified easily, to check whether the image has been tampered with. That is the key difference between steganography and digital watermarking.\n\n===Alleged use by intelligence services===\nIn 2010, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] alleged that the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Russian foreign intelligence service]] uses customized steganography software for embedding encrypted text messages inside image files for certain communications with \"illegal agents\" (agents without diplomatic cover) stationed abroad.<ref>{{cite web|title=Criminal complaint by Special Agent Ricci against alleged Russian agents|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/062810complaint2.pdf|publisher=United States Department of Justice}}</ref>\n\n===Distributed steganography===\nThere are distributed steganography methods,<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Distributed Steganography |publisher=[[IEEE]] |date=October 2011|doi=10.1109/IIHMSP.2011.20 |isbn=978-1-4577-1397-2 |title=2011 Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing |last1=Liao |first1=Xin |last2=Wen |first2=Qiao-yan |last3=Shi |first3=Sha |pages=153\u2013156 }}</ref> including methodologies that distribute the payload through multiple carrier files in diverse locations to make detection more difficult.

The word ''steganography'' comes from New Latin ''steganographia'', which combines the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''stegan\u00f3s'' ({{wiktell|\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2}}), meaning \"covered or concealed\", and ''-graphia'' ({{wiktell|\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae}}) meaning \"writing\".<ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/steganography ]</ref>\n\nThe first recorded use of the term was in 1499 by [[Johannes Trithemius]] in his ''[[Steganographia]]'', a treatise on cryptography and steganography, disguised as a book on magic. Generally, the hidden messages appear to be (or to be part of) something else: images, articles, shopping lists, or some other cover text. For example, the hidden message may be in [[invisible ink]] between the visible lines of a private letter. Some implementations of steganography that lack a [[shared secret]] are forms of [[security through obscurity]], and key-dependent steganographic schemes adhere to [[Kerckhoffs's principle]].<ref name=stegokey>{{cite journal|last=Fridrich|first=Jessica|author2=M.

In digital steganography, electronic communications may include steganographic coding inside of a transport layer, such as a document file, image file, program or protocol. Media files are ideal for steganographic transmission because of their large size. For example, a sender might start with an innocuous image file and adjust the color of every hundredth [[pixel]] to correspond to a letter in the alphabet. The change is so subtle that someone who is not specifically looking for it is unlikely to notice the change.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Chart in the hand of Dr John Dee.

This particular form of steganography is called a [[null cipher]].\n* Messages written in [[Morse code]] on [[yarn]] and then knitted into a piece of clothing worn by a courier.\n* Messages written on envelopes in the area covered by [[postage stamp]]s.\n* In the early days of the printing press, it was common to mix different typefaces on a printed page because the printer did not have enough copies of some letters in one typeface. Thus, a message could be hidden by using two or more different typefaces, such as normal or italic.\n*[[File:Microdot camera markiv.jpg|thumb|A [[microdot]] camera]]During and after World War II, [[espionage]] agents used photographically-produced [[microdot]]s to send information back and forth. Microdots were typically minute (less than the size of the [[full stop|period]] produced by a [[typewriter]]). World War II microdots were embedded in the paper and covered with an adhesive, such as [[collodion]] that was reflective and so was detectable by viewing against glancing light. Alternative techniques included inserting microdots into slits cut into the edge of postcards.\n* During World War II, [[Velvalee Dickinson]], a spy for [[Japan]] in [[New York City]], sent information to accommodation addresses in neutral [[South America]]. She was a dealer in [[doll]]s, and her letters discussed the quantity and type of doll to ship. The stegotext was the doll orders, and the concealed \"plaintext\" was itself encoded and gave information about ship movements, etc. Her case became somewhat famous and she became known as the Doll Woman.\n* During World War II, [[photosensitive glass]] was declared secret{{By whom|date=September 2019}}, and used for transmitting information to Allied armies.\n* [[Jeremiah Denton]] repeatedly blinked his eyes in [[Morse code]] during the 1966 televised press conference that he was forced into as an American [[prisoner-of-war]] by his North Vietnamese captors, spelling out \"T-O-R-T-U-R-E\". That confirmed for the first time to the [[US Naval Intelligence]] and other Americans that the North Vietnamese were torturing American prisoners-of-war.\n*In 1968, crew members of the [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|USS ''Pueblo'']] intelligence ship, held as prisoners by [[North Korea]], communicated in sign language during staged photo opportunities, to inform the United States that they were not defectors but captives of the North Koreans.

Some techniques of CPS/IoT steganography overlap with network steganography, i.e. hiding data in communication protocols used in CPS/the IoT. However, specific techniques hide data in CPS components. For instance, data can be stored in unused registers of IoT/CPS components and in the states of IoT/CPS actuators.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wendzel|first1=Steffen|last2=Mazurczyk|first2=Wojciech|last3=Haas|first3=Georg|title=Don't You Touch My Nuts: Information Hiding In Cyber Physical Systems Using Smart Buildings|journal=Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE Security & Privacy Workshops|language=English|publisher=IEEE}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tuptuk|first1=Nilufer|last2=Hailes|first2=Stephen|title=Covert channel attacks in pervasive computing|journal=Proceedings 2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)}}</ref>\n\n===Printed===\nDigital steganography output may be in the form of printed documents. A message, the ''[[plaintext]]'', may be first encrypted by traditional means, producing a ''[[ciphertext]]''. Then, an innocuous ''covertext'' is modified in some way so as to contain the ciphertext, resulting in the ''stegotext''. For example, the letter size, spacing, [[typeface]], or other characteristics of a covertext can be manipulated to carry the hidden message. Only a recipient who knows the technique used can recover the message and then decrypt it. [[Francis Bacon]] developed [[Bacon's cipher]] as such a technique.\n\nThe ciphertext produced by most digital steganography methods, however, is not printable.  Traditional digital methods rely on perturbing noise in the channel file to hide the message, and as such, the channel file must be transmitted to the recipient with no additional noise from the transmission.  Printing introduces much noise in the ciphertext, generally rendering the message unrecoverable.  There are techniques that address this limitation, one notable example being ASCII Art Steganography.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pictureworthsthousandwords.appspot.com/|title=ASCII Art Steganography|author=Vincent Chu}}</ref>\n\n[[File:HP Color Laserjet 3700 schutz g.jpg|thumb|Yellow dots from a laser printer]]\nAlthough not classic steganography, some types of modern color laser printers integrate the model, serial number and timestamps on each printout for traceability reasons using a dot-matrix code made of small, yellow dots not recognizable to the naked eye\u200a\u2014\u200asee [[printer steganography]] for details.\n\n=== Using puzzles ===\nThe art of concealing data in a puzzle can take advantage of the degrees of freedom in stating the puzzle, using the starting information to encode a key within the puzzle / puzzle image.\n\nFor instance, steganography using [[sudoku]] puzzles has as many keys as there are possible solutions of a sudoku puzzle, which is {{val|6.71|e=21}}.<ref>{{cite book|title=2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing|last1=B.r.|first1=Roshan Shetty|last2=J.|first2=Rohith|last3=V.|first3=Mukund|last4=Honwade|first4=Rohan|last5=Rangaswamy|first5=Shanta|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4244-5104-3|pages=623\u2013626|chapter=Steganography Using Sudoku Puzzle|doi=10.1109/ARTCom.2009.116}}</ref>\n\n=== Network ===\n\nIn 1977, '''''Kent''''' concisely described the potential for covert channel signaling in general network communication protocols, even if the traffic is encrypted (in a footnote) in \"Encryption-Based Protection for Interactive User/Computer Communication,\" Proceedings of the Fifth Data Communications Symposium, September 1977.\n\nIn 1987, '''Girling''' first studied covert channels on a local area network (LAN), identified and realised three obvious covert channels (two storage channels and one timing channel), and his research paper entitled \u201cCovert channels in LAN\u2019s\u201d published in ''IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering'', vol.

However, some terms appear specifically in software and are easily confused. These are the most relevant ones to digital steganographic systems:\n\nThe ''payload'' is the data covertly communicated. The ''carrier'' is the signal, stream, or data file that hides the payload, which differs from the ''channel'', which typically means the type of input, such as a JPEG image. The resulting signal, stream, or data file with the encoded payload is sometimes called the ''package'', ''stego file'', or ''covert message''. The proportion of bytes, samples, or other signal elements modified to encode the payload is called the ''encoding density'' and is typically expressed as a number between 0 and 1.\n\nIn a set of files, the files that are considered likely to contain a payload are ''suspects''. A ''suspect'' identified through some type of statistical analysis can be referred to as a ''candidate''.\n\n==Countermeasures and detection==\nDetecting physical steganography requires careful physical examination, including the use of magnification, developer chemicals and [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]]. It is a time-consuming process with obvious resource implications, even in countries that employ many people to spy on their fellow nationals. However, it is feasible to screen mail of certain suspected individuals or institutions, such as prisons or prisoner-of-war (POW) camps.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], prisoner of war camps gave prisoners specially-treated [[paper]] that would reveal [[invisible ink]]. An article in the 24 June 1948 issue of ''Paper Trade Journal'' by the Technical Director of the [[United States Government Printing Office]] had Morris S. Kantrowitz describe in general terms the development of this paper. Three prototype papers (''Sensicoat'', ''Anilith'', and ''Coatalith'') were used to manufacture postcards and stationery provided to German prisoners of war in the US and Canada. If POWs tried to write a hidden message, the special paper rendered it visible. The US granted at least two [[patent]]s related to the technology, one to Kantrowitz, {{US Patent|2515232}}, \"Water-Detecting paper and Water-Detecting Coating Composition Therefor,\" patented 18 July 1950, and an earlier one, \"Moisture-Sensitive Paper and the Manufacture Thereof,\" {{US Patent|2445586}}, patented 20 July 1948. A similar strategy issues prisoners with writing paper ruled with a water-soluble ink that runs in contact with water-based invisible ink.\n\nIn computing, steganographically encoded package detection is called [[steganalysis]]. The simplest method to detect modified files, however, is to compare them to known originals. For example, to detect information being moved through the graphics on a website, an analyst can maintain known clean copies of the materials and then compare them against the current contents of the site. The differences, if the carrier is the same, comprise the payload. In general, using extremely high compression rates makes steganography difficult but not impossible. Compression errors provide a hiding place for data, but high compression reduces the amount of data available to hold the payload, raising the encoding density, which facilitates easier detection (in extreme cases, even by casual observation).\n\nThere are a variety of basic tests that can be done to identify whether or not a secret message exists. This process is not concerned with the extraction of the message, which is a different process and a separate step. The most basic approaches of [[steganalysis]] are visual or aural attacks, structural attacks, and statistical attacks. These approaches attempt to detect the steganographic algorithms that were used.<ref name=Wanyer2009>Wayner, Peter (2009). ''Disappearing Cryptography: Information Hiding : Steganography & Watermarking'', . Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Amsterdam;Boston.</ref> These algorithms range from unsophisticated to very sophisticated, with early algorithms being much easier to detect due to statistical anomalies that were present. The size of the message that is being hidden is a factor in how difficult it is to detect. The overall size of the cover object also plays a factor as well. If the cover object is small and the message is large, this can distort the statistics and make it easier to detect. A larger cover object with a small message decreases the statistics and gives it a better chance of going unnoticed.\n\nSteganalysis that targets a particular algorithm has much better success as it is able to key in on the anomalies that are left behind. This is because the analysis can perform a targeted search to discover known tendencies since it is aware of the behaviors that it commonly exhibits. When analyzing an image the least significant bits of many images are actually not random. The camera sensor, especially lower end sensors are not the best quality and can introduce some random bits. This can also be affected by the file compression done on the image. Secret messages can be introduced into the least significant bits in an image and then hidden.  A steganography tool can be used to camouflage the secret message in the least significant bits but it can introduce a random area that is too perfect. This area of perfect randomization stands out and can be detected by comparing the least significant bits to the next-to-least significant bits on image that hasn't been compressed.<ref name=Wanyer2009 />\n\nGenerally though, there are many techniques known to be able to hide messages in data using steganographic techniques. None are, by definition, obvious when users employ standard applications, but some can be detected by specialist tools. Others, however, are resistant to detection - or rather it is not possible to reliably distinguish data containing a hidden message from data containing just noise - even when the most sophisticated analysis is performed. Steganography is being used to hide cyber attacks, referred to as ''Stegware'', and detection is therefore not an adequate defence. The only way of defeating the threat is to transform data in a way that destroys any hidden messages,<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319943090|title=Defenders Guide to Steganography|year=2017|doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.21608.98561|last1=Wiseman|first1=Simon}}</ref> a process called [[Content Threat Removal]].\n\n==Applications==\n===Use in modern printers===\n{{Main|Printer steganography}}\nSome modern computer printers use steganography, including [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[Xerox]] brand color laser printers. The printers add tiny yellow dots to each page. The barely-visible dots contain encoded printer serial numbers and date and time stamps.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2005/10/16 |title=Secret Code in Color Printers Lets Government Track You; Tiny Dots Show Where and When You Made Your Print |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date=16 October 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Example from modern practice===\nThe larger the cover message (in binary data, the number of [[bit]]s) relative to the hidden message, the easier it is to hide the hidden message (as an analogy, the larger the \"haystack\", the easier it is to hide a \"needle\"). So [[digital image|digital picture]]s, which contain much data, are sometimes used to hide messages on the [[Internet]] and on other digital communication media. It is not clear how common this practice actually is.\n\nFor example, a 24-bit [[bitmap]] uses 8 bits to represent each of the three color values (red, green, and blue) of each [[pixel]]. The blue alone has 2<sup>8</sup> different levels of blue intensity. The difference between 11111111 and 11111110 in the value for blue intensity is likely to be undetectable by the human eye. Therefore, the [[least significant bit]] can be used more or less undetectably for something else other than color information. If that is repeated for the green and the red elements of each pixel as well, it is possible to encode one letter of [[ASCII]] text for every three [[pixel]]s.\n\nStated somewhat more formally, the objective for making steganographic encoding difficult to detect is to ensure that the changes to the carrier (the original signal) because of the injection of the payload (the signal to covertly embed) are visually (and ideally, statistically) negligible. The changes are indistinguishable from the [[noise floor]] of the carrier. All media can be a carrier, but media with a large amount of redundant or compressible information is better suited.\n\nFrom an [[information theory|information theoretical]] point of view, that means that the [[Communication channel|channel]] must have more [[channel capacity|capacity]] than the \"surface\" [[signal (information theory)|signal]] requires. There must be [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]]. For a digital image, it may be [[noise]] from the imaging element; for [[digital audio]], it may be noise from recording techniques or [[amplifier|amplification]] equipment. In general, electronics that digitize an [[analog (signal)|analog signal]] suffer from several noise sources, such as [[Johnson-Nyquist noise|thermal noise]], [[flicker noise]], and [[shot noise]]. The noise provides enough variation in the captured digital information that it can be exploited as a noise cover for hidden data. In addition, [[lossy compression]] schemes (such as [[JPEG]]) always introduce some error to the decompressed data, and it is possible to exploit that for steganographic use, as well.\n\nAlthough steganography and digital watermarking seem similar, they are not. In steganography, the hidden message should remain intact until it reaches its destination. Steganography can be used for [[digital watermark]]ing in which a message (being simply an identifier) is hidden in an image so that its source can be tracked or verified (for example, [[Coded Anti-Piracy]]) or even just to identify an image (as in the [[EURion constellation]]). In such a case, the technique of hiding the message (here, the watermark) must be robust to prevent tampering. However, digital watermarking sometimes requires a brittle watermark, which can be modified easily, to check whether the image has been tampered with. That is the key difference between steganography and digital watermarking.\n\n===Alleged use by intelligence services===\nIn 2010, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] alleged that the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Russian foreign intelligence service]] uses customized steganography software for embedding encrypted text messages inside image files for certain communications with \"illegal agents\" (agents without diplomatic cover) stationed abroad.<ref>{{cite web|title=Criminal complaint by Special Agent Ricci against alleged Russian agents|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/062810complaint2.pdf|publisher=United States Department of Justice}}</ref>\n\n===Distributed steganography===\nThere are distributed steganography methods,<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Distributed Steganography |publisher=[[IEEE]] |date=October 2011|doi=10.1109/IIHMSP.2011.20 |isbn=978-1-4577-1397-2 |title=2011 Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing |last1=Liao |first1=Xin |last2=Wen |first2=Qiao-yan |last3=Shi |first3=Sha |pages=153\u2013156 }}</ref> including methodologies that distribute the payload through multiple carrier files in diverse locations to make detection more difficult.

As a result, fights have broken out at unemployment lines and there is a growing concern of the increasing unrest among the newly unemployed population.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/australia-to-see-25-year-high-in-unemployment-report/1803909 |title=Australia to see 25-year high in unemployment: Report |website=aa.com.tr |access-date=15 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nestegg.com.au/invest-money/economy/treasury-expects-10-unemployment |title=Treasury expects 10% unemployment |last=Ormsby|first=Grace |date=14 April 2020 |website=nestegg.com.au  |access-date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAs of April 2020, up to a million people have been laid off due to effects of the recession.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Henriques-Gomes |first=Luke |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/24/newly-unemployed-australians-queue-at-centrelink-offices-as-mygov-website-crashes-again |title=Newly unemployed Australians queue at Centrelink offices as MyGov website crashes again |date=24 March 2020 |work=The Guardian |access-date=26 March 2020 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Over 280,000 individuals applied for unemployment support at the peak day.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/surge-in-demand-280-000-ask-centrelink-for-help-in-one-day-20200325-p54dwn.html |title='Surge in demand': 280,000 ask Centrelink for help in one day |last=Bonyhady |first=Nick |date=25 March 2020 |website=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=26 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Canada ===\nIn Canada, the respective unemployment figure was 1 million for the month of March.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52232674 |title=Canada lost a record one million jobs in March |date=9 April 2020 |work=BBC News |access-date=10 April 2020 }}</ref>\n\n=== Japan ===\n\nJapan's 2019 4th quarter GDP shrank 7.1% from the previous quarter <ref>{{Cite news |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Japan-s-Q4-GDP-downgraded-to-annualized-7.1-contraction|title=Japan's Q4 GDP downgraded to annualized 7.1% contraction |date=9 March 2020 |work=Nikkei Asian Review |access-date=20 April 2020 }}</ref> due to two main factors.

Music in Africa is very important when it comes to religion.  Songs and music are used in rituals and religious ceremonies, to pass down stories from generation to generation, as well as to sing and dance to.\n\nTraditional music in most of the continent is passed down orally (or aurally) and is not written. In [[sub-Saharan African music traditions]], it frequently relies on percussion instruments of every variety, including [[xylophone]]s, [[djembe]]s, [[drums]], and tone-producing instruments such as the [[mbira]] or \"thumb piano.\"<ref name=\"Columbia University\">{{cite web|title=Definitions of Styles and Genres: Traditional and Contemporary African Music|url=http://www.colum.edu/cbmr/Resources/style-genre-definitions.html|work=CBMR|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=3 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Estrella|first=Espie|title=African music|url=http://musiced.about.com/od/historyofmusic/a/africanmusic.htm|work=Music Education|publisher=about.com|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe music and dance of the [[African diaspora]], formed to varying degrees on African musical traditions, include [[music of the United States|American music]] and many [[Caribbean music|Caribbean]] genres, such as [[soca music|soca]], [[calypso music|calypso]] (see [[kaiso]]) and [[zouk]]. [[Latin American music]] genres such as the [[Cuban rumba|rumba]], [[conga (music)|conga]], [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|bomba]], [[cumbia]], [[Salsa music|salsa]] and [[samba]] were founded on the music of [[African slave trade|enslaved Africans]], and have in turn influenced [[African popular music]].<ref name=\"Columbia University\" />\n\nLike the music of Asia, India and the Middle East, it is a highly rhythmic music. African music consists of complex rhythmic patterns, often involving one rhythm played against another to create a ''polyrhythm''. The most common polyrhythm plays three beats on top of two, like a triplet played against straight notes.\nBeyond the rhythmic nature of the music, African music differs from Western music in that the various parts of the music do not necessarily combine in a harmonious fashion. African musicians aim to express life, in all its aspects, through the medium of sound. Each instrument or part may represent a particular aspect of life, or a different character; the through-line of each instrument/part matters more than how the different instruments and parts fit together. African music does not have a written tradition; there is little or no written music to study or analyze. This makes it almost impossible to notate the music \u2013 especially the melodies and harmonies \u2013 using the Western staff. There are subtle differences in pitch and intonation that do not easily translate to Western notation. African music most closely adheres to Western tetratonic (three-notes), pentatonic (five-note), hexatonic (six-note), and heptatonic (seven-note) scales.

None of this is performed outside its intended socialess context and much of it is associated with a particular dance. Some of it, performed by professional musicians, is [[religious music|sacral music]] or ceremonial and courtly music performed at royal courts.\n\nMusicologically, Sub-Saharan Africa may be divided into four regions:<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n* The '''eastern''' region ''(light green regions on map)'' includes the [[music of Uganda]], [[Music of Kenya|Kenya]], [[Music of Rwanda|Rwanda]], [[Music of Burundi|Burundi]], [[Music of Tanzania|Tanzania]], [[Music of Malawi|Malawi]], [[Music of Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Music of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe]] as well as the islands of [[Music of Madagascar|Madagascar]], [[Music of the Seychelles|the Seychelles]], [[Music of Mauritius|Mauritius]] and [[Comorian music|Comor]]. Many of these have been influenced by [[Arabic music]] and also by the [[music of India]], [[Music of Indonesia|Indonesia]] and [[music of Polynesia|Polynesia]], though the region's indigenous musical traditions are primarily in the mainstream of the sub-Saharan [[Niger\u2013Congo language|Niger\u2013Congo-speaking peoples]].\n* The '''southern''' region ''(brown region on map)'' includes the [[music of South Africa]], [[Music of Lesotho|Lesotho]], [[Music of Swaziland|Swaziland]], [[Music of Botswana|Botswana]], [[Music of Namibia|Namibia]] and [[Music of Angola|Angola]].\n* The '''central''' region ''(dark blue region on map)'' includes the [[music of Chad]], [[Music of the Central African Republic|the Central African Republic]], [[Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Music of Zambia|Zambia]], including [[Pygmy music]].\n* [[West African music]] ''(yellow region on map)'' includes the [[music of Senegal]] and [[Music of The Gambia|the Gambia]], of [[Music of Guinea|Guinea]] and [[Music of Guinea-Bissau|Guinea-Bissau]], [[Music of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone]] and [[Music of Liberia|Liberia]], of the inland plains of [[Music of Mali|Mali]], [[Music of Niger|Niger]] and [[Music of Burkina Faso|Burkina Faso]], the coastal nations of [[Music of Cote d'Ivoire|Cote d'Ivoire]], [[Music of Ghana|Ghana]], [[Music of Togo|Togo]], [[Music of Benin|Benin]], [[Music of Nigeria|Nigeria]], [[Music of Cameroon|Cameroon]], [[Music of Gabon|Gabon]] and [[Music of the Republic of the Congo|the Republic of the Congo]] as well as islands such as [[Music of Sao Tome and Principe|Sao Tome and Principe]].\n\n[[Southern Africa|Southern]], [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[West Africa]] are similarly in the broad Sub-Saharan musical tradition.

According to Kubik, the vocal style of Muslim West African singers \"using [[melisma]], wavy intonation, and so forth is a heritage of that large region of West Africa that had been in contact with the [[Arabic world|Arabic]]-[[Islamic world]] of the [[Maghreb]] since the seventh and eighth centuries.\" In terms of instrumentation, Kubik notes that stringed instruments (including ancestors of the [[banjo]]) were traditionally favored by Muslim West Africans, while drumming was traditionally favored by non-Muslim West Africans.<ref name=\"Curiel\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Musical instruments ==\n[[File:Abderrahmane Abdelli.jpg|thumb|right|[[Algeria]]n musician [[Abderrahmane Abdelli]] playing the [[oud]]]]\n\nBesides vocalisation, which uses various techniques such as complex hard [[melisma]] and [[yodel]], a wide array of [[musical instrument]]s are used. African musical instruments include a wide range of [[drum (musical instrument)|drums]], [[slit gong]]s, [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]] and [[double bell]]s, different types of [[harp]]s, and harp-like instruments such as the [[Kora (instrument)|Kora]] and the [[Ngoni (instrument)|ngoni]],  as well as [[fiddle]]s, many kinds of [[xylophone]] and [[lamellophone]] such as the [[mbira]], and different types of [[wind instrument]] like [[flute]]s and [[trumpet]]s. Additionally, [[string instrument]]s are also used, with the [[lute]]-like [[oud]] and [[Ngoni (instrument)|Ngoni]] serving as musical accompaniment in some areas.\n\nThere are five groups of sub-Saharan African musical instruments: membranophones, chordophones, aerophones, idiophones, and percussion.  Membranophones are the drums, including kettles, clay pots, and barrels.  Chordophones are stringed instruments like harps and fiddles.  Aerophones are another name for wind instruments.  These can include flutes and trumpets, similar to the instruments you hear in American music.  Idiophones are rattles and shakers, while percussion can be sounds like foot-stomping and hand-clapping.<ref name=\"contemporary-african-art.com\">http://www.contemporary-african-art.com/african-musical-instruments.html</ref>  Many of the wooden instruments have shapes or pictures carved out into them to represent ancestry.  Some are decorated with feathers or beads.<ref name=\"contemporary-african-art.com\"/>\n\nDrums used in African traditional music include [[talking drum]]s, [[bougarabou]] and [[djembe]] in [[West Africa]], [[water drum]]s in [[Central Africa|Central]] and West Africa, and the different types of [[ngoma drums]] (or engoma) in Central and [[Southern Africa]]. Other percussion instruments include many [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]] and [[Shaker (musical instrument)|shakers]], such as the [[Kashaka|kosika]] (kashaka), [[rain stick]], bells and wood sticks. Also, Africa has lots of other types of drums, and lots of flutes, and lots of stringed and wind instruments.\n\nThe playing of [[polyrhythm]]s is one of the most universal characteristics of Sub-Sarahan music, in contrast to [[polyphony]] in Western music. Several uniquely designed instruments have evolved there over time to facilitate the playing of simultaneous contrasting rhythms. The [[mbira]], [[kalimba]], [[Kora (instrument)|Kora]], [[Ngoni (instrument)|Ngoni]] and dousn'gouni are examples of these instruments which organize notes not in the usual single linear order from bass to treble, but in two separated rank arrays which allows additional ease in playing [[cross rhythm]]s. The continuing influence of this principle can be seen in the 20th century American instruments the [[gravi-kora]] and [[gravikord]] which are new modern examples.\n\n== Relationship to language ==\nMany [[Languages of Africa|languages spoken in Africa]] are [[tonal language]]s, leading to a close connection between music and language in some local cultures. These particular communities use vocal sounds and movements with their music as well. In singing, the tonal pattern or the text puts some constraints on the melodic patterns. On the other hand, in instrumental music a native speaker of a language can often perceive a text or texts in the music. This effect also forms the basis of [[drum (communication)|drum languages]] ([[talking drum]]s).<ref>''GCSE Music \u2013 Edexcel Areas of Study'', Coordination Group Publications, UK, 2006, p. 35, quoting examination board syllabus.</ref>\n\n== Influences on African music ==\n[[File:Drumming (7250728078).jpg|thumb|right|Traditional drummers in [[Ghana]]]]\n\nHistorically, several factors have influenced the [[Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony|traditional music of Africa]]. The music has been influenced by language, the environment, a variety of cultures, politics, and population movement, all of which are intermingled. Each African group evolved in a different area of the continent, which means that they ate different foods, faced different weather conditions, and came in contact with different groups than other societies did. Each group moved at different rates and to different places than others, and thus each was influenced by different people and circumstances. Furthermore, each society did not necessarily operate under the same government, which also significantly influenced their music styles.<ref>Nketia, J. H. Kwabena. ''The Music of Africa''. New York: Norton and Company, 1974. Print.</ref>\n\n=== Influence on North American music ===\n{{See also|African-American music}}\n\nAlthough African American music is widely known and loved, and much popular North American music emerged from it, White American music also has strong African roots. The musical traditions of the Irish and Scottish settlers merged with African-American musical elements to become [[Old-time music|old-time]] and [[Blue grass music|bluegrass]], among other genres.\n\nAfrican music has been a major factor in the shaping of what we know today as [[Dixieland]], the [[blues]] and [[jazz]]. These styles have all borrowed from African rhythms and sounds, brought over the Atlantic Ocean by slaves. African music in Sub-Saharan Africa is mostly upbeat [[polyrhythm]]ic and joyful, whereas the blues should be viewed as an aesthetic development resulting from the conditions of slavery in the new world.\n\n[[File:Traffic 1973.jpg|thumb|right|[[Steve Winwood|Steve Winwood's]] [[progressive rock]]/[[jazz rock]] band [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] often used West African rhythms]]\n\nOn his album ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]'', the American folk musician [[Paul Simon]] employs African bands, rhythms and melodies as a musical backdrop for his own lyrics; especially [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]]. In the early 1970s, [[Remi Kabaka]], an [[Afro-rock]] avant-garde drummer, laid the initial drum patterns that created the Afro-rock sounds in bands such as [[Ginger Baker]]'s [[Ginger Baker's Air Force|Airforce]], [[The Rolling Stones]], and [[Steve Winwood]]'s [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]].

Songs such as \"[[Circle of Life]]\" and \"[[He Lives in You]]\" combine of [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and English lyrics, as well as traditional African styles of music with more modern western styles. Additionally, the Disney film incorporates numerous words from the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] [[Swahili language]]. The phrase ''hakuna matata'', for example, is an actual Swahili phrase that does in fact mean \"no worries\". Characters such as [[Simba]], Kovu, and Zira are also Swahili words, meaning \"lion\", \"scar\", and \"hate\", respectively.<ref>\"The Characters.\" ''Lion King Pride.'' 2008. Disney, 1997\u20132008.

Non-commercial African American radio stations promoted African music as part of their cultural and political missions in the 1960s and 1970s. African music also found eager audiences at Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and appealed particularly to activists in the civil rights and Black Power movements.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/19649475/African_Sounds_in_the_American_South_Community_Radio_Historically_Black_Colleges_and_Musical_Pan-Africanism \"African Sounds in the American South: Community Radio, Historically Black Colleges, and Musical Pan Africanism,\"] The Journal of Popular Music Studies, December 2015</ref>\n\n== Popular music ==\n{{Main|African popular music}}\n\n[[File:Miriam Makeba 2011.jpg|thumb|right|[[Miriam Makeba]] during a performance]]\n\nAfrican popular music, like [[Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony|African traditional music]], is vast and varied. Most contemporary genres of African popular music build on cross-pollination with western popular music. Many [[List of popular music genres|genres of popular music]], including [[blues]], [[jazz]] and [[African Rumba|rumba]], derive to varying degrees from musical traditions from Africa, taken to the Americas by enslaved Africans. These rhythms and sounds have subsequently been adapted by newer genres like [[Rock music|rock]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. Similarly, African popular music has adopted elements, particularly the musical instruments and [[recording studio]] techniques of western music.\n\nOne of the most important 20th century singers of South African popular music was [[Miriam Makeba]], who played a key-role, in the 60s, in drawing global audience's attention to African music and its meaning.  Zenzile Miriam Makeba was said to have been one of the most influential and popular musicians of Africa, beginning in the 1950s. She was a part of three bands, including one all-woman band and two others.  She performed all types of jazz music, traditional African music, and music that was popular in western Africa at the time.  Miriam played a majority of her music in the form of \"mbube\", which was \"a style of vocal harmony which drew on American jazz, ragtime, and Anglican church hymns, as well as indigenous styles of music.\"  After she moved to the U.S., problems with Makeba's passport occurred and she had to stay in America, it was said that she put an American twist on most of her African music.  She had a very diverse scale of her vocal range and could hit almost any note.<ref>[[Miriam Makeba#Musical style and themes]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2017}} \"The Empress of African Music\" died at the age of 76.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/11/miriam-makeba-obituary</ref>\n\nThe Afro-Euro hybrid style, the Cuban [[son (music)|son]], has had an influence on certain popular music in Africa. Some of the first guitar bands on the continent played covers of Cuban songs.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Roberts, John Storm (1986: cassette) ''Afro-Cuban Comes Home: The Birth and Growth of Congo Music'', Original Music.</ref> The early guitar-based bands from the [[Congo Basin|Congo]] called their music ''rumba'' (although it was son rather than rumba-based). The Congolese style eventually evolved into what became known as [[soukous]].\n\n== Music industry ==\nFor African artists concerts were the one of the fews ways to earn in the industry.

Music in Africa is very important when it comes to religion.  Songs and music are used in rituals and religious ceremonies, to pass down stories from generation to generation, as well as to sing and dance to.\n\nTraditional music in most of the continent is passed down orally (or aurally) and is not written. In [[sub-Saharan African music traditions]], it frequently relies on percussion instruments of every variety, including [[xylophone]]s, [[djembe]]s, [[drums]], and tone-producing instruments such as the [[mbira]] or \"thumb piano.\"<ref name=\"Columbia University\">{{cite web|title=Definitions of Styles and Genres: Traditional and Contemporary African Music|url=http://www.colum.edu/cbmr/Resources/style-genre-definitions.html|work=CBMR|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=3 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Estrella|first=Espie|title=African music|url=http://musiced.about.com/od/historyofmusic/a/africanmusic.htm|work=Music Education|publisher=about.com|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe music and dance of the [[African diaspora]], formed to varying degrees on African musical traditions, include [[music of the United States|American music]] and many [[Caribbean music|Caribbean]] genres, such as [[soca music|soca]], [[calypso music|calypso]] (see [[kaiso]]) and [[zouk]]. [[Latin American music]] genres such as the [[Cuban rumba|rumba]], [[conga (music)|conga]], [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|bomba]], [[cumbia]], [[Salsa music|salsa]] and [[samba]] were founded on the music of [[African slave trade|enslaved Africans]], and have in turn influenced [[African popular music]].<ref name=\"Columbia University\" />\n\nLike the music of Asia, India and the Middle East, it is a highly rhythmic music. African music consists of complex rhythmic patterns, often involving one rhythm played against another to create a ''polyrhythm''. The most common polyrhythm plays three beats on top of two, like a triplet played against straight notes.\nBeyond the rhythmic nature of the music, African music differs from Western music in that the various parts of the music do not necessarily combine in a harmonious fashion. African musicians aim to express life, in all its aspects, through the medium of sound. Each instrument or part may represent a particular aspect of life, or a different character; the through-line of each instrument/part matters more than how the different instruments and parts fit together. African music does not have a written tradition; there is little or no written music to study or analyze. This makes it almost impossible to notate the music \u2013 especially the melodies and harmonies \u2013 using the Western staff. There are subtle differences in pitch and intonation that do not easily translate to Western notation. African music most closely adheres to Western tetratonic (three-notes), pentatonic (five-note), hexatonic (six-note), and heptatonic (seven-note) scales. Harmonization of the melody is accomplished by singing in parallel thirds, fourths, or fifths. Another distinguishing form of African music is its call-and-response nature: one voice or instrument plays a short melodic phrase, and that phrase is echoed by another voice or instrument. The call-and-response nature extends to the rhythm, where one drum will play a rhythmic pattern, echoed by another drum playing the same pattern. African music is also highly improvised. A core rhythmic pattern is typically played, with drummers then improvising new patterns over the static original patterns.\n\n== Music by regions ==\n=== North Africa and the Horn of Africa ===\n{{Main|Middle Eastern and North African music traditions|Arabic music|Middle Eastern music}}\n\n[[North Africa]] is the seat of [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Carthage]], civilizations with strong ties to the [[ancient Near East]] and which influenced the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman cultures]].

[http://www.richardhodges.com/ladzekpo/Developmental.html \"Cultural Understanding of Polyrhythm\"]. Foundation Course in African Music.</ref>\n\nAfrican [[traditional music]] is frequently functional in nature. Performances may be long and often involve the participation of the audience.<ref name=\"Study, Coordination Group Publications 2006, page 36\">''GCSE Music \u2013 Edexcel Areas of Study'', Coordination Group Publications, UK, 2006, p. 36.</ref> There are, for example, little different kinds of [[work song]]s, songs accompanying [[childbirth]], [[marriage]], [[hunting]] and political activities, music to ward off evil spirits and to pay respects to good spirits, the dead and the ancestors. None of this is performed outside its intended socialess context and much of it is associated with a particular dance. Some of it, performed by professional musicians, is [[religious music|sacral music]] or ceremonial and courtly music performed at royal courts.\n\nMusicologically, Sub-Saharan Africa may be divided into four regions:<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n* The '''eastern''' region ''(light green regions on map)'' includes the [[music of Uganda]], [[Music of Kenya|Kenya]], [[Music of Rwanda|Rwanda]], [[Music of Burundi|Burundi]], [[Music of Tanzania|Tanzania]], [[Music of Malawi|Malawi]], [[Music of Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Music of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe]] as well as the islands of [[Music of Madagascar|Madagascar]], [[Music of the Seychelles|the Seychelles]], [[Music of Mauritius|Mauritius]] and [[Comorian music|Comor]]. Many of these have been influenced by [[Arabic music]] and also by the [[music of India]], [[Music of Indonesia|Indonesia]] and [[music of Polynesia|Polynesia]], though the region's indigenous musical traditions are primarily in the mainstream of the sub-Saharan [[Niger\u2013Congo language|Niger\u2013Congo-speaking peoples]].\n* The '''southern''' region ''(brown region on map)'' includes the [[music of South Africa]], [[Music of Lesotho|Lesotho]], [[Music of Swaziland|Swaziland]], [[Music of Botswana|Botswana]], [[Music of Namibia|Namibia]] and [[Music of Angola|Angola]].\n* The '''central''' region ''(dark blue region on map)'' includes the [[music of Chad]], [[Music of the Central African Republic|the Central African Republic]], [[Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Music of Zambia|Zambia]], including [[Pygmy music]].\n* [[West African music]] ''(yellow region on map)'' includes the [[music of Senegal]] and [[Music of The Gambia|the Gambia]], of [[Music of Guinea|Guinea]] and [[Music of Guinea-Bissau|Guinea-Bissau]], [[Music of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone]] and [[Music of Liberia|Liberia]], of the inland plains of [[Music of Mali|Mali]], [[Music of Niger|Niger]] and [[Music of Burkina Faso|Burkina Faso]], the coastal nations of [[Music of Cote d'Ivoire|Cote d'Ivoire]], [[Music of Ghana|Ghana]], [[Music of Togo|Togo]], [[Music of Benin|Benin]], [[Music of Nigeria|Nigeria]], [[Music of Cameroon|Cameroon]], [[Music of Gabon|Gabon]] and [[Music of the Republic of the Congo|the Republic of the Congo]] as well as islands such as [[Music of Sao Tome and Principe|Sao Tome and Principe]].\n\n[[Southern Africa|Southern]], [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[West Africa]] are similarly in the broad Sub-Saharan musical tradition. They also have several ancillary influences, from the [[Islamic world|Muslim regions]] of Africa, and in modern times, the [[Americas]] and [[Western Europe]].\n[[File:PDP-CH_-_Dominique_Manzadi_-_Muatubaba_Kungbekinga_-_African_music_in_Azande_language_-_Ngoma-1493-j2990.flac|left|thumb|Azande song from the Congo performed with xylophone.]]\n[[West African music]] has regional variations, with [[Muslim]] regions incorporating elements of [[Islamic music]] and non-Muslim regions more influenced by indigenous traditions, according to the historian [[Sylviane Diouf]] and [[ethnomusicologist]] [[Gerhard Kubik]].<ref name=\"Curiel\">{{cite news |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/08/15/INGMC85SSK1.DTL |title=Muslim Roots of the Blues |work=[[SFGate]] |publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate=24 August 2005 |first=Jonathan |last=Curiel |authorlink=Jonathan Curiel |date=15 August 2004 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905161734/http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2004%2F08%2F15%2FINGMC85SSK1.DTL |archivedate=5 September 2005 }}</ref> According to Diouf, traditional Muslim West African Music incorporates elements of the [[Adhan|Islamic call to prayer]] (originating from [[Bilal ibn Rabah]], an [[Abyssinian people|Abyssinian]] [[Islam in Africa|African Muslim]] in the early 7th century), including lyrics praising God, melody, note changes, \"words that seem to quiver and shake\" in the vocal chords, dramatic changes in [[musical scale]]s, and nasal [[Intonation (music)|intonation]]. According to Kubik, the vocal style of Muslim West African singers \"using [[melisma]], wavy intonation, and so forth is a heritage of that large region of West Africa that had been in contact with the [[Arabic world|Arabic]]-[[Islamic world]] of the [[Maghreb]] since the seventh and eighth centuries.\" In terms of instrumentation, Kubik notes that stringed instruments (including ancestors of the [[banjo]]) were traditionally favored by Muslim West Africans, while drumming was traditionally favored by non-Muslim West Africans.<ref name=\"Curiel\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Musical instruments ==\n[[File:Abderrahmane Abdelli.jpg|thumb|right|[[Algeria]]n musician [[Abderrahmane Abdelli]] playing the [[oud]]]]\n\nBesides vocalisation, which uses various techniques such as complex hard [[melisma]] and [[yodel]], a wide array of [[musical instrument]]s are used. African musical instruments include a wide range of [[drum (musical instrument)|drums]], [[slit gong]]s, [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]] and [[double bell]]s, different types of [[harp]]s, and harp-like instruments such as the [[Kora (instrument)|Kora]] and the [[Ngoni (instrument)|ngoni]],  as well as [[fiddle]]s, many kinds of [[xylophone]] and [[lamellophone]] such as the [[mbira]], and different types of [[wind instrument]] like [[flute]]s and [[trumpet]]s. Additionally, [[string instrument]]s are also used, with the [[lute]]-like [[oud]] and [[Ngoni (instrument)|Ngoni]] serving as musical accompaniment in some areas.\n\nThere are five groups of sub-Saharan African musical instruments: membranophones, chordophones, aerophones, idiophones, and percussion.  Membranophones are the drums, including kettles, clay pots, and barrels.  Chordophones are stringed instruments like harps and fiddles.  Aerophones are another name for wind instruments.  These can include flutes and trumpets, similar to the instruments you hear in American music.  Idiophones are rattles and shakers, while percussion can be sounds like foot-stomping and hand-clapping.<ref name=\"contemporary-african-art.com\">http://www.contemporary-african-art.com/african-musical-instruments.html</ref>  Many of the wooden instruments have shapes or pictures carved out into them to represent ancestry.  Some are decorated with feathers or beads.<ref name=\"contemporary-african-art.com\"/>\n\nDrums used in African traditional music include [[talking drum]]s, [[bougarabou]] and [[djembe]] in [[West Africa]], [[water drum]]s in [[Central Africa|Central]] and West Africa, and the different types of [[ngoma drums]] (or engoma) in Central and [[Southern Africa]]. Other percussion instruments include many [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]] and [[Shaker (musical instrument)|shakers]], such as the [[Kashaka|kosika]] (kashaka), [[rain stick]], bells and wood sticks. Also, Africa has lots of other types of drums, and lots of flutes, and lots of stringed and wind instruments.\n\nThe playing of [[polyrhythm]]s is one of the most universal characteristics of Sub-Sarahan music, in contrast to [[polyphony]] in Western music. Several uniquely designed instruments have evolved there over time to facilitate the playing of simultaneous contrasting rhythms. The [[mbira]], [[kalimba]], [[Kora (instrument)|Kora]], [[Ngoni (instrument)|Ngoni]] and dousn'gouni are examples of these instruments which organize notes not in the usual single linear order from bass to treble, but in two separated rank arrays which allows additional ease in playing [[cross rhythm]]s. The continuing influence of this principle can be seen in the 20th century American instruments the [[gravi-kora]] and [[gravikord]] which are new modern examples.\n\n== Relationship to language ==\nMany [[Languages of Africa|languages spoken in Africa]] are [[tonal language]]s, leading to a close connection between music and language in some local cultures. These particular communities use vocal sounds and movements with their music as well. In singing, the tonal pattern or the text puts some constraints on the melodic patterns. On the other hand, in instrumental music a native speaker of a language can often perceive a text or texts in the music. This effect also forms the basis of [[drum (communication)|drum languages]] ([[talking drum]]s).<ref>''GCSE Music \u2013 Edexcel Areas of Study'', Coordination Group Publications, UK, 2006, p. 35, quoting examination board syllabus.</ref>\n\n== Influences on African music ==\n[[File:Drumming (7250728078).jpg|thumb|right|Traditional drummers in [[Ghana]]]]\n\nHistorically, several factors have influenced the [[Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony|traditional music of Africa]]. The music has been influenced by language, the environment, a variety of cultures, politics, and population movement, all of which are intermingled. Each African group evolved in a different area of the continent, which means that they ate different foods, faced different weather conditions, and came in contact with different groups than other societies did. Each group moved at different rates and to different places than others, and thus each was influenced by different people and circumstances. Furthermore, each society did not necessarily operate under the same government, which also significantly influenced their music styles.<ref>Nketia, J. H. Kwabena. ''The Music of Africa''. New York: Norton and Company, 1974. Print.</ref>\n\n=== Influence on North American music ===\n{{See also|African-American music}}\n\nAlthough African American music is widely known and loved, and much popular North American music emerged from it, White American music also has strong African roots. The musical traditions of the Irish and Scottish settlers merged with African-American musical elements to become [[Old-time music|old-time]] and [[Blue grass music|bluegrass]], among other genres.\n\nAfrican music has been a major factor in the shaping of what we know today as [[Dixieland]], the [[blues]] and [[jazz]]. These styles have all borrowed from African rhythms and sounds, brought over the Atlantic Ocean by slaves. African music in Sub-Saharan Africa is mostly upbeat [[polyrhythm]]ic and joyful, whereas the blues should be viewed as an aesthetic development resulting from the conditions of slavery in the new world.\n\n[[File:Traffic 1973.jpg|thumb|right|[[Steve Winwood|Steve Winwood's]] [[progressive rock]]/[[jazz rock]] band [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] often used West African rhythms]]\n\nOn his album ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]'', the American folk musician [[Paul Simon]] employs African bands, rhythms and melodies as a musical backdrop for his own lyrics; especially [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]]. In the early 1970s, [[Remi Kabaka]], an [[Afro-rock]] avant-garde drummer, laid the initial drum patterns that created the Afro-rock sounds in bands such as [[Ginger Baker]]'s [[Ginger Baker's Air Force|Airforce]], [[The Rolling Stones]], and [[Steve Winwood]]'s [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]]. He continued to work with Winwood, [[Paul McCartney]], and [[Mick Jagger]] throughout the decade.<ref>Azam, O. A.

Songs such as \"[[Circle of Life]]\" and \"[[He Lives in You]]\" combine of [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and English lyrics, as well as traditional African styles of music with more modern western styles. Additionally, the Disney film incorporates numerous words from the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] [[Swahili language]]. The phrase ''hakuna matata'', for example, is an actual Swahili phrase that does in fact mean \"no worries\". Characters such as [[Simba]], Kovu, and Zira are also Swahili words, meaning \"lion\", \"scar\", and \"hate\", respectively.<ref>\"The Characters.\" ''Lion King Pride.'' 2008. Disney, 1997\u20132008.

Non-commercial African American radio stations promoted African music as part of their cultural and political missions in the 1960s and 1970s. African music also found eager audiences at Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and appealed particularly to activists in the civil rights and Black Power movements.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/19649475/African_Sounds_in_the_American_South_Community_Radio_Historically_Black_Colleges_and_Musical_Pan-Africanism \"African Sounds in the American South: Community Radio, Historically Black Colleges, and Musical Pan Africanism,\"] The Journal of Popular Music Studies, December 2015</ref>\n\n== Popular music ==\n{{Main|African popular music}}\n\n[[File:Miriam Makeba 2011.jpg|thumb|right|[[Miriam Makeba]] during a performance]]\n\nAfrican popular music, like [[Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony|African traditional music]], is vast and varied. Most contemporary genres of African popular music build on cross-pollination with western popular music. Many [[List of popular music genres|genres of popular music]], including [[blues]], [[jazz]] and [[African Rumba|rumba]], derive to varying degrees from musical traditions from Africa, taken to the Americas by enslaved Africans. These rhythms and sounds have subsequently been adapted by newer genres like [[Rock music|rock]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. Similarly, African popular music has adopted elements, particularly the musical instruments and [[recording studio]] techniques of western music.\n\nOne of the most important 20th century singers of South African popular music was [[Miriam Makeba]], who played a key-role, in the 60s, in drawing global audience's attention to African music and its meaning.  Zenzile Miriam Makeba was said to have been one of the most influential and popular musicians of Africa, beginning in the 1950s. She was a part of three bands, including one all-woman band and two others.  She performed all types of jazz music, traditional African music, and music that was popular in western Africa at the time.  Miriam played a majority of her music in the form of \"mbube\", which was \"a style of vocal harmony which drew on American jazz, ragtime, and Anglican church hymns, as well as indigenous styles of music.\"  After she moved to the U.S., problems with Makeba's passport occurred and she had to stay in America, it was said that she put an American twist on most of her African music.  She had a very diverse scale of her vocal range and could hit almost any note.<ref>[[Miriam Makeba#Musical style and themes]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2017}} \"The Empress of African Music\" died at the age of 76.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/11/miriam-makeba-obituary</ref>\n\nThe Afro-Euro hybrid style, the Cuban [[son (music)|son]], has had an influence on certain popular music in Africa. Some of the first guitar bands on the continent played covers of Cuban songs.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Roberts, John Storm (1986: cassette) ''Afro-Cuban Comes Home: The Birth and Growth of Congo Music'', Original Music.</ref> The early guitar-based bands from the [[Congo Basin|Congo]] called their music ''rumba'' (although it was son rather than rumba-based). The Congolese style eventually evolved into what became known as [[soukous]].\n\n== Music industry ==\nFor African artists concerts were the one of the fews ways to earn in the industry.

He argued that contrary to Crosland's assertions, the government could exercise little control over Britain's largest companies, which were likely to continue consolidating into an [[oligopoly]] that, by the 1980s, could raise prices high enough that governments following [[Keynesian economics]] would be unable to ensure their citizens the opportunity for [[full employment]] that they had been able to since the war, and exploit [[transfer pricing]] to avoid paying British taxes. Holland called for  returning to nationalisation, arguing that taking control of the top 25 companies that way would result in a market with more competition and less inflation.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\nHolland's ideas formed the basis of the [[Alternative Economic Strategy]] (AES) promoted by [[Tony Benn]], then [[Secretary of State for Industry]] in the Labour governments of [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]] as they considered responses to [[Pound sterling#1976 sterling crisis|the sterling crisis]] in 1976. The AES called on Britain to adopt a [[protectionism|protectionist]] stance in international trade, including reversing [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|its recent decision to join the European Common Market]], and impose no incomes policy to combat inflation. Benn believed that this approach was more in keeping with Labour's traditional policies and would have its strongest supporters in the unions and outside of them vigorously supporting the government against opposition from the financial sector and commanding heights of industry. It was ultimately rejected in favor of the [[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]] and extensive cuts in public spending as the condition of an [[International Monetary Fund]] loan that supported the pound.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\nThe left wing of the Labour Party, while critical of the revisionist approach and the Social Contract, was not universally supportive of the AES either. Many thought it did not go far enough, or avoided the issue of nationalisation. [[Feminism in the United Kingdom|Feminists]] in particular criticised it for its focus on traditionally male-dominated manufacturing jobs and ignoring the broader issues that the increasing amount of women in the workforce faced, preferring a focus on broader social issues rather than just working conditions and pay, the traditional areas unions had negotiated with employers.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\n===1960s\u201370s labour law reforms===\n\nIn 1968 Wilson's government appointed the [[Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations|Donovan Commission]] to review [[United Kingdom labour law|British labour law]] with an eye toward reducing the days lost to strikes every year; many Britons had come to believe the unions were too powerful despite the country's economic growth since the war. It found much of the problem to lie in a parallel system of 'official' signed agreements between unions and employers, and [[Side letter|'unofficial', often unwritten ones]] at the local level, between [[shop steward]]s and managers, which often took precedence in practice over the official ones. The government responded with ''[[In Place of Strife]]'' a [[white paper]] by [[Secretary of State for Employment]] [[Barbara Castle]], which recommended restrictions on unions' ability to strike, such as requiring strikes take place after a member vote and fining unions for unofficial strikes.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 36\">L\u00f3pez, 36</ref>\n\nThe [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) vigorously opposed making Castle's recommendations law, and Callaghan, then [[Home Secretary]], led a cabinet revolt which led to its abandonment. Callaghan did not believe it would be effective in curtailing unofficial strikes, that the proposals could not pass, and the effort would create unnecessary tension between the government and the unions that were key to its political strength.<ref name=\"Lopez 37\">{{cite book|last=Callaghan|first=James|authorlink=James Callaghan|title=Time and Chance|page=274|date=1987|publisher=Collins|isbn=9780002165150}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, 37</ref>\n\nAfter the Conservatives won [[1970 United Kingdom general election|the following year's election]], they implemented their own legislation to address the issue. The [[Industrial Relations Act 1971]], modeled in part on the U.S. [[Taft-Hartley Act]], passed over determined union opposition, included many of the same provisions as ''In Place of Strife'', and explicitly stated that formal [[collective bargaining agreement]]s would have the force of law unless they had [[disclaimer]]s to the contrary. It also created a [[National Industrial Relations Court]] to handle disputes and put unions under a central registry to enforce their rules.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 38\">L\u00f3pez, 38</ref>\n\nNew Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] hoped that the new law would not only address the strike issue but the steep [[inflation]] plaguing the British economy (along with other industrial capitalist economies) at the time, eliminating the need for a separate [[incomes policy]] by having a moderating effect on pay increases demanded by unions. Ongoing union resistance to the Industrial Relations Act led to a [[House of Lords]] ruling in their favor over demonstrations and widespread unofficial strikes following the [[Pentonville Five]]'s imprisonment for continuing to picket a London container depot in violation of a court order, which undermined the legislation. Coal miners [[UK miners' strike (1972)|officially went on strike]] for the first time in almost half a century in 1972; after two months the strike was settled with the miners getting a 21 per cent increase, less than half of what they had originally sought.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\">L\u00f3pez, 39</ref>\n\nHeath as a result turned to an incomes policy; inflation continued to worsen. Its implementation was abandoned in 1973 when [[1973 oil shock|that year's oil embargo]] nearly doubled prices within months. To meet demand for heat in the wintertime, the government had to return to coal, giving the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] more leverage. The government declared a [[state of emergency]] that November, and at the beginning of 1974 limited all nonessential businesses to [[Three-Day Week|three days of electricity each week]] to conserve power. Miners, who had seen their rise from two years before turn into a pay cut in real terms due to the inflation the government had not brought under control, voted overwhelmingly to go on strike in late January.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\" />\n\nTwo weeks later, the government responded by calling [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|an election]], running on the slogan \"Who Governs Britain?\". At the end of the month the Conservatives no longer did; Labour and Wilson returned, but [[hung parliament|without a majority]]. They were able to pass the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]], which repealed the Heath government's Industrial Relations Act.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\" /> \n\nIn [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October]] they won a majority of three seats; still they needed a coalition with the [[Liberal Party (United Kingdom)|Liberal Party]] to have a majority on many issues. Callaghan, now [[Foreign Secretary]], warned his fellow Cabinet members at the time of the possibility of \"a breakdown of democracy\", telling them that \"If I were a young man, I would emigrate.\"<ref name=\"beckett2010\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NURERF4hb8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA175#v=onepage&f=false | title=When the Lights Went Out: Britain in the Seventies | publisher=Faber & Faber | author=Beckett, Andy | year=2010 | pages=175 | isbn=978-0-571-22137-0}}</ref>\n\n===Incomes policy===\n\nWilson, and Callaghan, who succeeded him as Prime Minister after Wilson resigned for health reasons in 1976, continued to fight inflation, which peaked at 26.9 per cent in the 12 months to August 1975. While demonstrating to markets [[fiscal responsibility]] the government wished to avoid large increases in unemployment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Colin Hay |title=Chronicles of a Death Foretold: the Winter of Discontent and Construction of the Crisis of British Keynesianism |journal=Parliamentary Affairs |year=2010 |volume=63 |pages=446\u201370 |doi=10.1093/pa/gsp056 |issue=3}}</ref> As part of the campaign to bring down inflation, the government had agreed a \"[[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]]\" with the TUC which allowed for a voluntary [[incomes policy]] in which the pay rises for workers were held down to limits set by the government. Previous governments had brought in incomes policies backed by [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]], but the social contract agreed that this would not happen.<ref name=bbc/>\n\n====Phases I and II====\nPhase I of the pay policy was announced on 11 July 1975 with a [[white paper]] entitled ''The Attack on Inflation''. This proposed a limit on wage rises of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]6 per week for all earning below \u00a38,500 annually.  The [[TUC General Council]] had accepted these proposals by 19 votes to 13. On 5 May 1976 the TUC accepted a new policy for 1976 increases, beginning 1 August, of between \u00a32.50 and \u00a34 per week with further years outlined.  At the Annual Congress on 8 September 1976 the TUC rejected a motion which called for a return to free [[collective bargaining]] (which meant no incomes policy at all) once Phase I expired on 1 August 1977. This new policy was Phase II of the incomes policy.<ref name=hay> Hay, \"The winter of discontent thirty years on.\"</ref>\n\n====Phase III====\nOn 15 July 1977, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]] announced Phase III of the incomes policy in which there was to be a phased return to free collective bargaining, without \"a free-for-all\".  After prolonged negotiations, the TUC agreed to continue with the modest increases recommended for 1977\u201378 under Phase II limits and not to try to reopen pay agreements made under the previous policy, while the Government agreed not to intervene in pay negotiations. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] criticised the power of the unions and lack of any stronger policy to cover the period from the summer of 1978. The inflation rate continued to fall through 1977 and by 1978 the annual rate fell below 10 per cent.<ref name=hay/>\n\nAt the end of the year [[Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|Bernard Donoughue]], Callaghan's chief policy advisor, sent him a memo analysing possible election dates. He concluded that the following October or November would be the best option, as the economy was likely to remain in good shape through then. After that, he wrote, the outlook was unclear, with pressure from the government's own incomes policy likely.<ref name=\"The Heat of the Kitchen\">{{cite book|last=Donoughue|first=Bernard|authorlink=Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|title=The Heat of the Kitchen: An Autobiography|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/yE4KAQAAMAAJ?hl=en|page=298|date=2003|isbn=9781842750513}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA61 56\u201357]</ref>\n\n====Five per cent limit====\nAt a May 1978 Downing Street lunch with editors and reporters from the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', Callaghan asked if they believed it was possible that the planned Phase IV would succeed, as he believed it would if the unions and their members understood it was the best way to keep Labour in power. Most told him that it would be difficult, but not impossible. [[Geoffrey Goodman]] disagreed, saying in his view it would be impossible for the union leaders to keep their membership from demanding higher pay increases. \"If that is the case, then I will go over the heads of the trade union leadership and appeal directly to their members\u2014and the voters\", the prime minister responded. \"We have to hold the line on pay or else the government will fall.\"<ref name=\"Goodman 220\u201321\">{{cite book |last1=Goodman |first1=Geoffrey |authorlink1=Geoffrey Goodman |title=From Bevan to Blair: Fifty Years Reporting from the Political Frontline |date=2003 |publisher=Pluto Press |isbn=9780745321783 |pages=220\u201321 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VqlZAAAAMAAJ}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA60 60\u201361]</ref>\n\nHaving prepared for the imminent end of the [[incomes policy]], global inflation supervened and was coming towards [[Interest rate#Historical interest rates|record levels during the 1978\u201382 period]].{{refn|And therefore a second trigger for a rise in [[inflation]]|group= n}} On 21 July 1978 [[Denis Healey]] introduced a new White Paper which set a guideline for pay rises of 5 per cent in the year from 1 August. Callaghan was determined to keep inflation down to single figures, however trade union leaders warned the government that the 5 per cent limit was unachievable, and urged a more flexible approach with a range of settlements between 5 and 8 per cent. [[Terry Duffy]] president of the AUEW described the limit as 'political suicide'. Denis Healey also privately expressed scepticism about the achievability of the limit. The TUC voted overwhelmingly on 26 July to reject the limit and insist on a return to [[collective bargaining|free collective bargaining]] as they were promised.<ref name=\"Conroy\">{{cite book |last1=Conroy |first1=Harry |title=Callaghan |date=2006 |publisher=Haus Publishing |isbn=1-904950-70-1 |pages=109-124}}</ref><ref name=hay/> \n\nIt had been widely expected that Callaghan would call a general election in the autumn of 1978, and that the 5 per cent limit would be revised if Labour won. At a private dinner before that year's TUC conference, Callaghan discussed election strategy with the leaders of major unions. He asked whether he should call an autumn election; with the exception of Scanlon they all urged him to call for one no later than November. Any later, they said, and they could not guarantee their memberships would remain on the job and off the picket line through the winter.<ref name=\"Goodman 226\u201327\">Goodman, 226\u201327, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA60 60\u201361]</ref>\n\nUnexpectedly however on 7 September, Callaghan announced that he would not be calling a general election that autumn but seeking to go through the winter with continued pay restraint so that the economy would be in a better state in preparation for a spring election, therefore the 5 per cent limit stood. The pay limit was officially termed \"Phase IV\" but most referred to it as \"the 5 per cent limit\". Although the government did not make the 5 per cent limit a legal requirement, it decided to impose penalties on private and public government contractors who broke the limit.<ref name=hay/><ref name=\"Davies\">{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=A.J. |title=To Build a New Jerusalem |date=1996 |isbn=0-349-10809-9 |pages=363-368}}</ref>\n\n===Changes in labour movement===\n\nBetween 1966 and 1979, Britain's unions were changing and becoming more diverse. Most of the increase in union membership was driven by women returning to or entering the workforce\u201473 per cent of them joined a union during that period against 19.3 per cent of men newly in work, as manufacturing jobs, traditionally heavily male, disappeared. Black and Asian workers also filled union ranks; in 1977 61 per cent of black men in work belonged to a union as opposed to 47 per cent of white men.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\">L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA32 32\u201333]</ref> Asian women became the face of the labour movement during the 1976\u201378 [[Grunwick dispute]] over pay and conditions at a film processing plant in suburban London.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 57\u201359\">L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA61 57\u201359]</ref>\n\nWithin unions, power was also devolving to the rank and file. The political upheavals of the late 1960s in Europe and the United States had brought [[participatory democracy]] to the fore, and workers felt [[Industrial democracy|they should be taking decisions]], including about when and whether to strike, that had hitherto been the province of union leadership. [[Hugh Scanlon]], who took over as head of the [[Amalgamated Engineering Union|Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers]] (AUEW) in 1967, and [[Jack Jones (trade unionist)|Jack Jones]], general secretary of the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]] (TGWU) from shortly afterward, were known among union leaders as \"the dubious duo\" for their advocacy for devolution.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\" />\n\n====Dissatisfied public employees====\n\nMany new members were also coming from government jobs. In 1974, about half of the total British workforce was unionised, but 83.1 per cent of all public-sector workers were. In the health sector that reached 90 per cent. Many of the government workers joining unions were women.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\" /> \n\nThe public employees were in a particularly difficult position with regard to incomes policy. Governments kept their employees' pay, already lower than their private-sector colleagues, low both because they could and because they wanted to set an example for the private sector, an example the private sector rarely followed. Their unions were also frustrated that their growing numbers had not yet translated into corresponding influence within the TUC.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 111\">L\u00f3pez, 111</ref>\n\nThese matters came to a head with the 1977 fire brigadiers' strike, a strike that many brigadiers were conflicted about since they knew they would be abandoning their own profession's duty to protect life, but felt that they could no longer make ends meet with their pay packets. They asked a 30 per cent increase, 20 per cent over the government's limit at the time, and a limit to 42 hours of work each week. The government responded by declaring a [[state of emergency]] and bringing in Army troops as replacements. The TUC voted late in the strike to not campaign in support of the brigadiers, in order to maintain its relationship with the government.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 57\u201359\" />\n\n===\"Stepping Stones\" and hardening of Conservative position on unionism===\n\n[[Margaret Thatcher]] was elected [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative leader]] to succeed Heath in 1975. She had been known as a member of his Cabinet, where she served as [[Secretary of State for Education]], for her advocacy of market-based solutions over government intervention in the economy, and had become convinced, as she wrote later, by that experience that the only thing more damaging to the British economy than Labour's socialist policies was her own party's attempts to emulate them. Influenced by writers such as [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Colm Brogan]], she came to believe the power of British unions under the [[postwar consensus]] had come at the expense of Britain as a whole.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 55\u201357\">L\u00f3pez, 55\u201357</ref>\n\nIn 1977 two of her advisors, [[John Hoskyns]] and Norman Strauss, prepared a report called \"[[John Hoskyns#The Stepping Stones Report, 1977|Stepping Stones]]\" which diagrammed the [[vicious cycle]] through which they believed the unions' influence exacerbated Britain's ongoing economic difficulties, such as [[unemployment in the United Kingdom|unemployment]] and inflation. Thatcher made it available to her [[Shadow Cabinet of Margaret Thatcher|shadow cabinet]] with the authors' recommendation that they all read it.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hoskyns|first1=John|authorlink1=John Hoskyns|last2=Strauss|first2=Norman|title=Stepping Stones|url=https://c59574e9047e61130f13-3f71d0fe2b653c4f00f32175760e96e7.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/5B6518B5823043FE9D7C54846CC7FE31.pdf|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date=14 November 1977|accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> By the end of the year she had formed a steering group to develop a specific policy aimed at curbing union power under a Tory government, and a media strategy that would invest the public in this.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 55\u201357\" />\n\nTo implement the media strategy, the party hired the advertising firm of [[Saatchi & Saatchi]], whose 1978 \"[[Labour Isn't Working]]\" campaign has been credited with persuading Callaghan not to hold an election that year. In 1978 Britain's largest tabloid, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', dropped its longtime support for Labour to instead embrace the Tories. Editor [[Larry Lamb (newspaper editor)|Larry Lamb]] met frequently with Thatcher's media advisor [[Gordon Reece]] to plan and refine strategy.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 18\">L\u00f3pez, 18</ref> During the later phases of the Grunwick dispute, as strikers took to the streets to march and sometimes clashed violently with the police, the Tories began using the media coverage to leverage \"Stepping Stones\"' critique of unionism.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 58\u201359\">L\u00f3pez, 58\u201359</ref>\n\n==Ford negotiations==\n\nAlthough not an official guideline, the pay rise set by [[Ford of Britain]] was accepted throughout private industry as a benchmark for negotiations.  Ford had enjoyed a good year, and could afford to offer a large pay rise to its workers.  The company was, however, also a major government contractor.  Ford's management therefore made a pay offer within the 5 per cent guidelines. In response, 15,000 Ford workers, mostly from the [[Transport and General Workers Union]] (TGWU), began an unofficial strike on 22 September 1978, which subsequently became an official TGWU action on 5 October.  The number of participants grew to 57,000.\n\nDuring the strike, [[Vauxhall Motors]] employees accepted an 8.5 per cent rise.  After long negotiation in which they weighed the chances of suffering from government sanctions against the continued damage of the strike, Ford eventually revised their offer to 17 per cent and decided to accept the sanctions; Ford workers accepted the rise on 22 November.\n\n==Political difficulties==\nAs the Ford strike was starting, the Labour Party conference began at [[Blackpool]]. Terry Duffy, the delegate from [[Liverpool Wavertree (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Wavertree]] Constituency Labour Party and a supporter of the [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] group, moved a motion on 2 October which demanded \"that the Government immediately cease intervening in wage negotiations\". Despite a plea from [[Michael Foot]] not to put the motion to the vote, the resolution was carried by 4,017,000 to 1,924,000. The next day, the Prime Minister accepted the fact of defeat by saying \"I think it was a lesson in democracy yesterday\", but insisted that he would not let up on the fight against inflation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Labour Party|title=Report of the Annual Conference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjCNAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Labour Representation Committee|page=235}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the government's situation in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] was increasingly difficult; through by-elections it had lost its majority of three seats in 1976 and had been forced to put together a [[Lab-Lib pact#1977|pact]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1977 in order to keep winning votes on legislation; the pact lapsed in July 1978.  A decision to grant extra parliamentary seats to [[Northern Ireland]] afforded temporary support from the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], but the Unionists were clear that this support would be withdrawn immediately after the Bill to grant extra seats had been passed &ndash; it was through the Ulster Unionists agreeing to abstain that the government defeated a [[motion of no confidence]] by 312 to 300 on 9 November.<ref name=hay/>\n\n===Further negotiation at the TUC===\nBy the middle of November it was clear that Ford would offer an increase substantially over the 5 per cent limit. The government subsequently entered into intense negotiations with the TUC, hoping to produce an agreement on pay policy that would prevent disputes and show political unity in the run-up to the general election. A limited and weak formula was eventually worked out and put to the General Council of the TUC on 14 November, but its General Council vote was tied 14\u201314, with the formula being rejected on the chair's casting vote. One important personality on the TUC General Council had changed earlier in 1978 with [[Moss Evans]] replacing [[Jack Jones (trade union leader)|Jack Jones]] at the TGWU. Evans proved a weak leader of his union, although it is doubtful whether Jones could have restrained the actions of some of the TGWU shop stewards.\n\nAfter Ford settled, the government announced on 28 November that sanctions{{clarify|date=August 2013}} would be imposed on Ford, along with 220 other companies, for breach of the pay policy. The announcement of actual sanctions produced an immediate protest from the [[Confederation of British Industry]] which announced that it would challenge their legality. The Conservatives put down a motion in the House of Commons to revoke the sanctions. A co-ordinated protest by left-wing Labour MPs over spending on defence forced the debate set for 7 December to be postponed; however on 13 December an anti-sanctions amendment was passed by 285 to 279. The substantive motion as amended was then passed by 285 to 283. James Callaghan put down a further motion of confidence for the next day, which the government won by ten votes (300 to 290), but accepted that his government could not use sanctions. In effect this deprived the government of any means of enforcing the 5 per cent limit on private industry.\n\n==Severe weather==\n\nA mild autumn turned cold on the morning of 25 November when temperatures recorded at [[Heathrow Airport]] dropped from {{convert|14|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|0|\u00b0C}} overnight, with some snowflakes. Throughout most of the following month, wintry conditions lingered, only for temperatures to rise well above {{convert|10|\u00b0C}} around Christmas. On 30 December, the cold returned, along with rain that soon turned to snow; the next day 1978 ended with Heathrow recording a high of only {{convert|-3|\u00b0C}} amid steady snowfall.<ref name=\"The British and their weather\">{{cite book |last1=Nobbs |first1=Patrick |title=The Story of the British and Their Weather: From Frost Fairs to Indian Summers |date=2015 |publisher=Amberley Publishing Ltd. |isbn=9781445644615 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wUp4BgAAQBAJ&pg=PT92&lpg=PT9 |accessdate=April 20, 2020 |chapter=9; The Winter of Discontent 1978\u201379}}</ref>\n\nThe effects were more severe outside of London. [[Ilfracombe]] and other towns in [[North Devon]] could only be reached by helicopter as many roads could not be adequately cleared. The [[Royal Automobile Club]] blamed local councils, who in turn pointed to unresolved issues with their unions and staff shortages. Two Scottish trains near [[Stirling]] were stuck in the snow, leaving 300 passengers stranded. Only three [[English Football League|League]] football matches could take place over the [[New Year's Day|New Year's]] holiday, and all rugby contests were canceled.<ref name=\"The British and their weather\" />\n\n==Lorry drivers==\nWith the government now having no way of enforcing its pay policy, unions which had not yet put in pay claims began to increase their aim. The first to take  action were [[truck|lorry]] drivers, members of the TGWU. Large numbers of the lorry drivers worked on oil tankers, and drivers working for [[BP]] and [[Esso]] began an overtime ban in support of rises of up to 40 per cent on 18 December. With supplies of oil being disrupted, the [[Cabinet Office]] prepared \"Operation Drumstick\", by which the [[British Army|Army]] were put on standby to take over from the tanker drivers. However, the operation would need the declaration of a [[state of emergency]] in order to allow conscription of the assets of the oil companies, and the government drew back from such a step. Before the situation developed into a crisis the oil companies settled on wage rises of around 15 per cent.\n\nFrom 3 January 1979 an unofficial strike of all TGWU lorry drivers began. With petrol distribution held up, petrol stations closed across the country. The strikers also [[Picketing (protest)|picketed]] the main ports. The strikes were made official on 11 January by the TGWU and 12 January by the United Road Transport Union. With 80 per cent of the nation's goods transported by road, essential supplies were put in danger as striking drivers picketed those firms that continued to work. While the oil tanker drivers were working, the main refineries were also targeted and the tanker drivers let the strikers know where they were going, allowing for flying pickets to turn them back at their destination. More than a million UK workers were laid off temporarily during the disputes.\n\nA further plan was drawn up to call a state of emergency and safeguard essential supplies through the Army, regarding which the government warned the TGWU leadership, which resulted in the union accepting (12 January 1979) a list of emergency supplies which were officially exempt from action. In practice, what counted as an emergency was left up to local officials of the TGWU to determine, and practice across the country varied according to the views of the local shop stewards who established \"dispensation committees\" to decide. When strikers in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] did not allow the correct mix of animal feed through to local farms, the farmers dropped the bodies of dead piglets and chickens outside the union offices; the union contended that the farmers had actually wrung the chicken's necks to kill them, and the piglets had been killed when the sow rolled over and crushed them.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn 29 January, lorry drivers in the South West accepted a deal awarded by an [[arbitration|arbitration panel]] of a rise of up to 20 per cent, just \u00a31 per week less than the union had been striking for; this settlement proved a model which was accepted throughout the country.\n\n==\"Crisis? What crisis?\"==\nOn 10 January, [[James Callaghan]] arrived back from a [[Guadeloupe Conference|summit in Guadeloupe]] in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. Having been tipped off that the press were present, his press secretary Tom McCaffrey advised him to say nothing and return immediately to work, but his political adviser [[Thomas McNally, Baron McNally|Tom McNally]] thought that the image of Callaghan returning and declaring his intent to take control of the situation would be reassuring. Callaghan therefore decided to give a press conference at [[Heathrow Airport]]. To McNally's dismay Callaghan was jocular and referred to having had a swim in the Caribbean during the summit. He was then asked (by a reporter from the ''[[Evening Standard]]'') \"What is your general approach, in view of the mounting chaos in the country at the moment?\" and replied:\n\n{{Quote|Well, that's a judgment that you are making. I promise you that if you look at it from outside, and perhaps you're taking rather a parochial view at the moment, I don't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos.}}\n\nThe next day's edition of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' featured the famous headline \"Crisis? What crisis?\" with a subheading \"Rail, lorry, jobs chaos \u2013 and Jim blames Press\", condemning Callaghan as being \"out of touch\" with British society.<ref name=bbc>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge79.shtml BBC News \u2013 History of the Winter of Discontent]</ref>\n\n==Public sector employees==\n22 January 1979 was the biggest individual day of strike action since the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike]] of 1926, and many workers stayed out indefinitely afterwards.  With many in the private sector having achieved substantial rises, the public sector unions became increasingly concerned to keep pace in terms of pay. The government had already announced a slight weakening of the policy on 16 January, which gave the unions cause for hope that they might win and use free collective bargaining. Train drivers belonging to [[ASLEF]] and the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] had already begun a series of 24-hour strikes, and the [[Royal College of Nursing]] conference on 18 January decided to ask that the pay of nurses be increased to the same level in real terms as 1974, which would mean a 25 per cent average rise.  The public sector unions labelled the date the \"Day of Action\", in which they held a 24-hour strike and marched to demand a \u00a360 per week minimum wage.\n\nWith the succession of strikes having been called and then won, many groups of workers began to take unofficial action \u2013 often without the consent or support of the union leaderships. Ambulance drivers began to take strike action in mid-January, and in parts of the country (London, West Midlands, [[Cardiff]], [[Glasgow]] and the west of Scotland) their action included refusing to attend 999 emergency calls. In these areas, the Army was drafted in to provide a skeleton service. Ancillary hospital staff also went on strike.<ref name=bbc/> On 30 January, the [[Secretary of State for Social Services]] [[David Ennals]] announced that 1,100 of 2,300 [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospitals were only treating emergencies, that practically no ambulance service was operating normally, and that the ancillary health service workers were deciding which cases merited treatment. The media reported with scorn that [[cancer]] patients were being prevented from getting essential treatment.\n\n===Gravediggers' strike===\nA notorious industrial action during the winter, and one which was later frequently referred to by Conservative politicians, was the strike by gravediggers, members of the [[GMWU]] in [[Liverpool]] and in [[Tameside]] near [[Manchester]].<ref>Moore (2014), p. 399.</ref> Eighty gravediggers being on strike, [[Liverpool City Council]] hired a factory in [[Speke]] to store the corpses until they could be buried. The Department of Environment noted that there were 150 bodies stored at the factory at one point, with 25 more added every day. The reports of unburied bodies caused concern with the public.<ref name=\"Travis\">{{cite news|last=Travis|first=Alan|title=National archives: Fear of fights at cemetery gates during 1979 winter of discontent|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/30/liverpool-gravedigger-strikes|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 December 2009}}</ref> On 1 February a persistent journalist asked the Medical Officer of Health for Liverpool, Dr Duncan Bolton, what would be done if the strike continued for months, Bolton speculated that [[burial at sea]] would be considered. Although his response was hypothetical, in the circumstances it caused great alarm. Other alternatives were considered, including allowing the bereaved to dig their own funeral's graves, deploying troops, and engaging private contractors to inter the bodies.  The main concerns were said to be aesthetic because bodies could be safely stored in heat-sealed bags for up to six weeks.<ref name=\"Travis\"/> Bolton later reported being \"horrified\" by the sensationalised reportage of the strike in the mass media.<ref>James Thomas, '\"Bound by History\": The Winter of Discontent in British Politics 1979\u20132004', ''Media, Culture and Society'', 29 (2007), p. 270.</ref> The gravediggers eventually settled for a 14 per cent rise after a fortnight's strike.\n\n===Waste collectors===\nWith many collectors having been on strike since 22 January, local authorities began to run out of space for storing waste and used local parks under their control. The Conservative controlled [[Westminster City Council]] used [[Leicester Square]] in the heart of London's West End for piles of rubbish and, as the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' reported, this attracted [[rat]]s.\n\nOn 21 February, a settlement of the local authority workers' dispute was agreed, whereby workers got an 11 per cent rise, plus \u00a31 per week, with the possibility of extra rises, should a pay comparability study recommend them. Some left-wing local authorities, among them the [[London Borough of Camden]], conceded the union demands in full (known as the \"Camden surplus\") and then saw an investigation by the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|District Auditor]], which eventually ruled it a breach of [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]]{{refn|Owed to the payers, the ratepayers of the area|group= n}} and therefore illegal. Camden Borough councillors, among them [[Ken Livingstone]], avoided [[Surcharge (sanction on public servant)|surcharge]]. Livingstone was Leader of the [[Greater London Council]] at the time the decision not to impose a surcharge was made.\n\n==End of the strikes==\nStrikes by essential services dismayed many senior ministers in the Labour government who had been close to the trade union movement, who had thought it unlikely that trade unionists would take such action. Among these was Prime Minister James Callaghan himself, who had built his political career on his connection to the trade unions, and had practically founded one, the [[Inland Revenue Staff Federation]]. Callaghan called the actions of the strikers \"free collective vandalism\".<ref>{{cite web |title=CALLAGHAN DEPICTS STRIKERS AS VANDALS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/02/archives/callaghan-depicts-strikers-as-vandals-britons-woes-mount-as-workers.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=30 November 2019 |date=2 February 1979}}</ref><ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nThe government was negotiating with the senior union leaders and on 11 February came to agreement on a proposal to be put to the TUC General Council. On 14 February the General Council agreed the concordat, published under the title \"The Economy, the Government, and Trade Union Responsibilities\".{{refn|The significance of a comprehensive agreement on [[Valentine's Day]] was remarked upon by the press{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}|group= n}} By this stage union executives had limited control over their members and strikes did not immediately cease, although they began to wind down from this point. In total in 1979, 29,474,000 working days were lost in industrial disputes, compared with 9,306,000 in 1978.\n\n==Political fallout==\nIn the summer before the Winter of Discontent, the minority Labour government's fortunes in the opinion polls had been improving and suggested that they could gain an overall majority in the event of a general election being held. However, on 7 September 1978, Callaghan announced that no general election would be held that year. Callaghan's failure to call an election would ultimately prove to be a costly mistake for his government.<ref name=calruns>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/7/newsid_2502000/2502781.stm |work=BBC News | title=1978: Callaghan accused of running scared | date=7 September 1978}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thatcher-loc.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margaret Thatcher]], who won the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] and became Prime Minister]]\nThe strikes appeared to have a profound effect on voting intention. According to [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]], Labour had a lead of 5 percentage points over the Conservatives in November 1978, which turned to a Conservative lead of 7.5 percentage points in January 1979, and of 20 percentage points in February. On 1 March, referendums on [[devolution]] to Scotland and Wales were held. That in Wales went strongly against devolution; that in Scotland produced a small majority in favour which did not reach the threshold set by Parliament of 40 per cent of that electorate. The government's decision not to press ahead with devolution immediately led the [[Scottish National Party]] to withdraw support from the government and on 28 March in a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|motion of no confidence the government lost by one vote]], precipitating a [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election]].\n\n[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[Margaret Thatcher]] had already outlined her proposals for restricting trade union power in a [[party political broadcast]] on 17 January in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. During the election campaign the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] made extensive use of the disruption caused during the strike. One broadcast on 23 April began with the Sun's headline \"Crisis? What Crisis?\" being shown and read out by an increasingly desperate voiceover interspersed with film footage of piles of rubbish, closed factories, picketed hospitals and locked graveyards. The scale of the Conservatives' victory in the general election has often been ascribed to the effect of the strikes, as well as their \"[[Labour Isn't Working]]\" campaign, and the party used film of the events of the winter in election campaigns for years to come.\n\nFollowing Thatcher's election win, she brought the [[post-war consensus]] to a halt and made drastic changes to trade union laws (most notably the regulation that unions had to hold a ballot among members before calling strikes) and as a result strikes were at their lowest level for 30 years by the time of the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], which the Conservatives won by a landslide.<ref name=\"83electionyoutube\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7noHkLaZ5VI|title=Conservative Party Election Broadcast (1983)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Organized labour|United Kingdom}}\n\n* [[Three-Day Week]], the [[Heath government]]'s reaction to the [[coal mining|coal miner]]s' [[work-to-rule]] and strikes in 1974, with a similarly disastrous impact on the government's popularity and led to the period of [[Labour government, 1974\u20131979|Labour government]].\n* [[Labour Isn't Working]]\n* [[Strike wave of 1945\u201346]], in U.S., followed by election of conservative Republican majorities in Congress who also passed laws restricting union activities\n* [[Winter of 1946\u201347 in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=n}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Beckett, Andy.

Public sector employee strike actions included an unofficial strike by [[gravedigger]]s working in [[Liverpool]] and [[Tameside]], and strikes by refuse collectors.

Crosland had argued in his book ''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' that the government exerted enough control over private industry that it was not necessary to [[nationalisation|nationalise]] it as [[Clause IV|the party had long called to do]], and that the ultimate goals of [[socialism]] could be as readily achieved by assuring long-term economic stability and building out the social [[welfare state]]. His \"[[The Future of Socialism#Labour revisionism|revisionist]]\" views became Labour's perspective on the [[post-war consensus]], in which both they and the [[Conservative Party (United Kingdom)|Conservative Party]] agreed in principle on a strong government role in the economy, strong unions and a welfare state as foundational to Britain's prosperity.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\">{{cite book |last=L\u00f3pez |first=Tara Martin |title=The Winter of Discontent: Myth, Memory and History |date=2014 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9781781386019 |pages=40\u201345}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, following the surge in radical left-wing politics of the late 1960s, that view was challenged in another Labour figure's book, [[Stuart Holland]]'s ''The Socialist Challenge''. He argued that contrary to Crosland's assertions, the government could exercise little control over Britain's largest companies, which were likely to continue consolidating into an [[oligopoly]] that, by the 1980s, could raise prices high enough that governments following [[Keynesian economics]] would be unable to ensure their citizens the opportunity for [[full employment]] that they had been able to since the war, and exploit [[transfer pricing]] to avoid paying British taxes. Holland called for  returning to nationalisation, arguing that taking control of the top 25 companies that way would result in a market with more competition and less inflation.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\nHolland's ideas formed the basis of the [[Alternative Economic Strategy]] (AES) promoted by [[Tony Benn]], then [[Secretary of State for Industry]] in the Labour governments of [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]] as they considered responses to [[Pound sterling#1976 sterling crisis|the sterling crisis]] in 1976. The AES called on Britain to adopt a [[protectionism|protectionist]] stance in international trade, including reversing [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|its recent decision to join the European Common Market]], and impose no incomes policy to combat inflation. Benn believed that this approach was more in keeping with Labour's traditional policies and would have its strongest supporters in the unions and outside of them vigorously supporting the government against opposition from the financial sector and commanding heights of industry. It was ultimately rejected in favor of the [[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]] and extensive cuts in public spending as the condition of an [[International Monetary Fund]] loan that supported the pound.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\nThe left wing of the Labour Party, while critical of the revisionist approach and the Social Contract, was not universally supportive of the AES either. Many thought it did not go far enough, or avoided the issue of nationalisation. [[Feminism in the United Kingdom|Feminists]] in particular criticised it for its focus on traditionally male-dominated manufacturing jobs and ignoring the broader issues that the increasing amount of women in the workforce faced, preferring a focus on broader social issues rather than just working conditions and pay, the traditional areas unions had negotiated with employers.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\n===1960s\u201370s labour law reforms===\n\nIn 1968 Wilson's government appointed the [[Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations|Donovan Commission]] to review [[United Kingdom labour law|British labour law]] with an eye toward reducing the days lost to strikes every year; many Britons had come to believe the unions were too powerful despite the country's economic growth since the war. It found much of the problem to lie in a parallel system of 'official' signed agreements between unions and employers, and [[Side letter|'unofficial', often unwritten ones]] at the local level, between [[shop steward]]s and managers, which often took precedence in practice over the official ones. The government responded with ''[[In Place of Strife]]'' a [[white paper]] by [[Secretary of State for Employment]] [[Barbara Castle]], which recommended restrictions on unions' ability to strike, such as requiring strikes take place after a member vote and fining unions for unofficial strikes.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 36\">L\u00f3pez, 36</ref>\n\nThe [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) vigorously opposed making Castle's recommendations law, and Callaghan, then [[Home Secretary]], led a cabinet revolt which led to its abandonment. Callaghan did not believe it would be effective in curtailing unofficial strikes, that the proposals could not pass, and the effort would create unnecessary tension between the government and the unions that were key to its political strength.<ref name=\"Lopez 37\">{{cite book|last=Callaghan|first=James|authorlink=James Callaghan|title=Time and Chance|page=274|date=1987|publisher=Collins|isbn=9780002165150}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, 37</ref>\n\nAfter the Conservatives won [[1970 United Kingdom general election|the following year's election]], they implemented their own legislation to address the issue. The [[Industrial Relations Act 1971]], modeled in part on the U.S. [[Taft-Hartley Act]], passed over determined union opposition, included many of the same provisions as ''In Place of Strife'', and explicitly stated that formal [[collective bargaining agreement]]s would have the force of law unless they had [[disclaimer]]s to the contrary. It also created a [[National Industrial Relations Court]] to handle disputes and put unions under a central registry to enforce their rules.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 38\">L\u00f3pez, 38</ref>\n\nNew Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] hoped that the new law would not only address the strike issue but the steep [[inflation]] plaguing the British economy (along with other industrial capitalist economies) at the time, eliminating the need for a separate [[incomes policy]] by having a moderating effect on pay increases demanded by unions. Ongoing union resistance to the Industrial Relations Act led to a [[House of Lords]] ruling in their favor over demonstrations and widespread unofficial strikes following the [[Pentonville Five]]'s imprisonment for continuing to picket a London container depot in violation of a court order, which undermined the legislation. Coal miners [[UK miners' strike (1972)|officially went on strike]] for the first time in almost half a century in 1972; after two months the strike was settled with the miners getting a 21 per cent increase, less than half of what they had originally sought.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\">L\u00f3pez, 39</ref>\n\nHeath as a result turned to an incomes policy; inflation continued to worsen. Its implementation was abandoned in 1973 when [[1973 oil shock|that year's oil embargo]] nearly doubled prices within months. To meet demand for heat in the wintertime, the government had to return to coal, giving the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] more leverage. The government declared a [[state of emergency]] that November, and at the beginning of 1974 limited all nonessential businesses to [[Three-Day Week|three days of electricity each week]] to conserve power. Miners, who had seen their rise from two years before turn into a pay cut in real terms due to the inflation the government had not brought under control, voted overwhelmingly to go on strike in late January.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\" />\n\nTwo weeks later, the government responded by calling [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|an election]], running on the slogan \"Who Governs Britain?\". At the end of the month the Conservatives no longer did; Labour and Wilson returned, but [[hung parliament|without a majority]].

While demonstrating to markets [[fiscal responsibility]] the government wished to avoid large increases in unemployment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Colin Hay |title=Chronicles of a Death Foretold: the Winter of Discontent and Construction of the Crisis of British Keynesianism |journal=Parliamentary Affairs |year=2010 |volume=63 |pages=446\u201370 |doi=10.1093/pa/gsp056 |issue=3}}</ref> As part of the campaign to bring down inflation, the government had agreed a \"[[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]]\" with the TUC which allowed for a voluntary [[incomes policy]] in which the pay rises for workers were held down to limits set by the government. Previous governments had brought in incomes policies backed by [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]], but the social contract agreed that this would not happen.<ref name=bbc/>\n\n====Phases I and II====\nPhase I of the pay policy was announced on 11 July 1975 with a [[white paper]] entitled ''The Attack on Inflation''. This proposed a limit on wage rises of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]6 per week for all earning below \u00a38,500 annually.  The [[TUC General Council]] had accepted these proposals by 19 votes to 13. On 5 May 1976 the TUC accepted a new policy for 1976 increases, beginning 1 August, of between \u00a32.50 and \u00a34 per week with further years outlined.  At the Annual Congress on 8 September 1976 the TUC rejected a motion which called for a return to free [[collective bargaining]] (which meant no incomes policy at all) once Phase I expired on 1 August 1977. This new policy was Phase II of the incomes policy.<ref name=hay> Hay, \"The winter of discontent thirty years on.\"</ref>\n\n====Phase III====\nOn 15 July 1977, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]] announced Phase III of the incomes policy in which there was to be a phased return to free collective bargaining, without \"a free-for-all\".  After prolonged negotiations, the TUC agreed to continue with the modest increases recommended for 1977\u201378 under Phase II limits and not to try to reopen pay agreements made under the previous policy, while the Government agreed not to intervene in pay negotiations. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] criticised the power of the unions and lack of any stronger policy to cover the period from the summer of 1978. The inflation rate continued to fall through 1977 and by 1978 the annual rate fell below 10 per cent.<ref name=hay/>\n\nAt the end of the year [[Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|Bernard Donoughue]], Callaghan's chief policy advisor, sent him a memo analysing possible election dates. He concluded that the following October or November would be the best option, as the economy was likely to remain in good shape through then. After that, he wrote, the outlook was unclear, with pressure from the government's own incomes policy likely.<ref name=\"The Heat of the Kitchen\">{{cite book|last=Donoughue|first=Bernard|authorlink=Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|title=The Heat of the Kitchen: An Autobiography|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/yE4KAQAAMAAJ?hl=en|page=298|date=2003|isbn=9781842750513}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA61 56\u201357]</ref>\n\n====Five per cent limit====\nAt a May 1978 Downing Street lunch with editors and reporters from the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', Callaghan asked if they believed it was possible that the planned Phase IV would succeed, as he believed it would if the unions and their members understood it was the best way to keep Labour in power. Most told him that it would be difficult, but not impossible. [[Geoffrey Goodman]] disagreed, saying in his view it would be impossible for the union leaders to keep their membership from demanding higher pay increases. \"If that is the case, then I will go over the heads of the trade union leadership and appeal directly to their members\u2014and the voters\", the prime minister responded. \"We have to hold the line on pay or else the government will fall.\"<ref name=\"Goodman 220\u201321\">{{cite book |last1=Goodman |first1=Geoffrey |authorlink1=Geoffrey Goodman |title=From Bevan to Blair: Fifty Years Reporting from the Political Frontline |date=2003 |publisher=Pluto Press |isbn=9780745321783 |pages=220\u201321 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VqlZAAAAMAAJ}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA60 60\u201361]</ref>\n\nHaving prepared for the imminent end of the [[incomes policy]], global inflation supervened and was coming towards [[Interest rate#Historical interest rates|record levels during the 1978\u201382 period]].{{refn|And therefore a second trigger for a rise in [[inflation]]|group= n}} On 21 July 1978 [[Denis Healey]] introduced a new White Paper which set a guideline for pay rises of 5 per cent in the year from 1 August. Callaghan was determined to keep inflation down to single figures, however trade union leaders warned the government that the 5 per cent limit was unachievable, and urged a more flexible approach with a range of settlements between 5 and 8 per cent. [[Terry Duffy]] president of the AUEW described the limit as 'political suicide'. Denis Healey also privately expressed scepticism about the achievability of the limit. The TUC voted overwhelmingly on 26 July to reject the limit and insist on a return to [[collective bargaining|free collective bargaining]] as they were promised.<ref name=\"Conroy\">{{cite book |last1=Conroy |first1=Harry |title=Callaghan |date=2006 |publisher=Haus Publishing |isbn=1-904950-70-1 |pages=109-124}}</ref><ref name=hay/> \n\nIt had been widely expected that Callaghan would call a general election in the autumn of 1978, and that the 5 per cent limit would be revised if Labour won. At a private dinner before that year's TUC conference, Callaghan discussed election strategy with the leaders of major unions. He asked whether he should call an autumn election; with the exception of Scanlon they all urged him to call for one no later than November. Any later, they said, and they could not guarantee their memberships would remain on the job and off the picket line through the winter.<ref name=\"Goodman 226\u201327\">Goodman, 226\u201327, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA60 60\u201361]</ref>\n\nUnexpectedly however on 7 September, Callaghan announced that he would not be calling a general election that autumn but seeking to go through the winter with continued pay restraint so that the economy would be in a better state in preparation for a spring election, therefore the 5 per cent limit stood. The pay limit was officially termed \"Phase IV\" but most referred to it as \"the 5 per cent limit\". Although the government did not make the 5 per cent limit a legal requirement, it decided to impose penalties on private and public government contractors who broke the limit.<ref name=hay/><ref name=\"Davies\">{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=A.J. |title=To Build a New Jerusalem |date=1996 |isbn=0-349-10809-9 |pages=363-368}}</ref>\n\n===Changes in labour movement===\n\nBetween 1966 and 1979, Britain's unions were changing and becoming more diverse. Most of the increase in union membership was driven by women returning to or entering the workforce\u201473 per cent of them joined a union during that period against 19.3 per cent of men newly in work, as manufacturing jobs, traditionally heavily male, disappeared. Black and Asian workers also filled union ranks; in 1977 61 per cent of black men in work belonged to a union as opposed to 47 per cent of white men.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\">L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA32 32\u201333]</ref> Asian women became the face of the labour movement during the 1976\u201378 [[Grunwick dispute]] over pay and conditions at a film processing plant in suburban London.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 57\u201359\">L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA61 57\u201359]</ref>\n\nWithin unions, power was also devolving to the rank and file. The political upheavals of the late 1960s in Europe and the United States had brought [[participatory democracy]] to the fore, and workers felt [[Industrial democracy|they should be taking decisions]], including about when and whether to strike, that had hitherto been the province of union leadership. [[Hugh Scanlon]], who took over as head of the [[Amalgamated Engineering Union|Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers]] (AUEW) in 1967, and [[Jack Jones (trade unionist)|Jack Jones]], general secretary of the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]] (TGWU) from shortly afterward, were known among union leaders as \"the dubious duo\" for their advocacy for devolution.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\" />\n\n====Dissatisfied public employees====\n\nMany new members were also coming from government jobs. In 1974, about half of the total British workforce was unionised, but 83.1 per cent of all public-sector workers were. In the health sector that reached 90 per cent. Many of the government workers joining unions were women.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\" /> \n\nThe public employees were in a particularly difficult position with regard to incomes policy. Governments kept their employees' pay, already lower than their private-sector colleagues, low both because they could and because they wanted to set an example for the private sector, an example the private sector rarely followed. Their unions were also frustrated that their growing numbers had not yet translated into corresponding influence within the TUC.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 111\">L\u00f3pez, 111</ref>\n\nThese matters came to a head with the 1977 fire brigadiers' strike, a strike that many brigadiers were conflicted about since they knew they would be abandoning their own profession's duty to protect life, but felt that they could no longer make ends meet with their pay packets. They asked a 30 per cent increase, 20 per cent over the government's limit at the time, and a limit to 42 hours of work each week. The government responded by declaring a [[state of emergency]] and bringing in Army troops as replacements. The TUC voted late in the strike to not campaign in support of the brigadiers, in order to maintain its relationship with the government.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 57\u201359\" />\n\n===\"Stepping Stones\" and hardening of Conservative position on unionism===\n\n[[Margaret Thatcher]] was elected [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative leader]] to succeed Heath in 1975. She had been known as a member of his Cabinet, where she served as [[Secretary of State for Education]], for her advocacy of market-based solutions over government intervention in the economy, and had become convinced, as she wrote later, by that experience that the only thing more damaging to the British economy than Labour's socialist policies was her own party's attempts to emulate them. Influenced by writers such as [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Colm Brogan]], she came to believe the power of British unions under the [[postwar consensus]] had come at the expense of Britain as a whole.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 55\u201357\">L\u00f3pez, 55\u201357</ref>\n\nIn 1977 two of her advisors, [[John Hoskyns]] and Norman Strauss, prepared a report called \"[[John Hoskyns#The Stepping Stones Report, 1977|Stepping Stones]]\" which diagrammed the [[vicious cycle]] through which they believed the unions' influence exacerbated Britain's ongoing economic difficulties, such as [[unemployment in the United Kingdom|unemployment]] and inflation. Thatcher made it available to her [[Shadow Cabinet of Margaret Thatcher|shadow cabinet]] with the authors' recommendation that they all read it.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hoskyns|first1=John|authorlink1=John Hoskyns|last2=Strauss|first2=Norman|title=Stepping Stones|url=https://c59574e9047e61130f13-3f71d0fe2b653c4f00f32175760e96e7.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/5B6518B5823043FE9D7C54846CC7FE31.pdf|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date=14 November 1977|accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> By the end of the year she had formed a steering group to develop a specific policy aimed at curbing union power under a Tory government, and a media strategy that would invest the public in this.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 55\u201357\" />\n\nTo implement the media strategy, the party hired the advertising firm of [[Saatchi & Saatchi]], whose 1978 \"[[Labour Isn't Working]]\" campaign has been credited with persuading Callaghan not to hold an election that year. In 1978 Britain's largest tabloid, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', dropped its longtime support for Labour to instead embrace the Tories. Editor [[Larry Lamb (newspaper editor)|Larry Lamb]] met frequently with Thatcher's media advisor [[Gordon Reece]] to plan and refine strategy.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 18\">L\u00f3pez, 18</ref> During the later phases of the Grunwick dispute, as strikers took to the streets to march and sometimes clashed violently with the police, the Tories began using the media coverage to leverage \"Stepping Stones\"' critique of unionism.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 58\u201359\">L\u00f3pez, 58\u201359</ref>\n\n==Ford negotiations==\n\nAlthough not an official guideline, the pay rise set by [[Ford of Britain]] was accepted throughout private industry as a benchmark for negotiations.  Ford had enjoyed a good year, and could afford to offer a large pay rise to its workers.  The company was, however, also a major government contractor.  Ford's management therefore made a pay offer within the 5 per cent guidelines. In response, 15,000 Ford workers, mostly from the [[Transport and General Workers Union]] (TGWU), began an unofficial strike on 22 September 1978, which subsequently became an official TGWU action on 5 October.  The number of participants grew to 57,000.\n\nDuring the strike, [[Vauxhall Motors]] employees accepted an 8.5 per cent rise.  After long negotiation in which they weighed the chances of suffering from government sanctions against the continued damage of the strike, Ford eventually revised their offer to 17 per cent and decided to accept the sanctions; Ford workers accepted the rise on 22 November.\n\n==Political difficulties==\nAs the Ford strike was starting, the Labour Party conference began at [[Blackpool]]. Terry Duffy, the delegate from [[Liverpool Wavertree (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Wavertree]] Constituency Labour Party and a supporter of the [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] group, moved a motion on 2 October which demanded \"that the Government immediately cease intervening in wage negotiations\". Despite a plea from [[Michael Foot]] not to put the motion to the vote, the resolution was carried by 4,017,000 to 1,924,000. The next day, the Prime Minister accepted the fact of defeat by saying \"I think it was a lesson in democracy yesterday\", but insisted that he would not let up on the fight against inflation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Labour Party|title=Report of the Annual Conference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjCNAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Labour Representation Committee|page=235}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the government's situation in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] was increasingly difficult; through by-elections it had lost its majority of three seats in 1976 and had been forced to put together a [[Lab-Lib pact#1977|pact]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1977 in order to keep winning votes on legislation; the pact lapsed in July 1978.  A decision to grant extra parliamentary seats to [[Northern Ireland]] afforded temporary support from the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], but the Unionists were clear that this support would be withdrawn immediately after the Bill to grant extra seats had been passed &ndash; it was through the Ulster Unionists agreeing to abstain that the government defeated a [[motion of no confidence]] by 312 to 300 on 9 November.<ref name=hay/>\n\n===Further negotiation at the TUC===\nBy the middle of November it was clear that Ford would offer an increase substantially over the 5 per cent limit. The government subsequently entered into intense negotiations with the TUC, hoping to produce an agreement on pay policy that would prevent disputes and show political unity in the run-up to the general election. A limited and weak formula was eventually worked out and put to the General Council of the TUC on 14 November, but its General Council vote was tied 14\u201314, with the formula being rejected on the chair's casting vote. One important personality on the TUC General Council had changed earlier in 1978 with [[Moss Evans]] replacing [[Jack Jones (trade union leader)|Jack Jones]] at the TGWU. Evans proved a weak leader of his union, although it is doubtful whether Jones could have restrained the actions of some of the TGWU shop stewards.\n\nAfter Ford settled, the government announced on 28 November that sanctions{{clarify|date=August 2013}} would be imposed on Ford, along with 220 other companies, for breach of the pay policy. The announcement of actual sanctions produced an immediate protest from the [[Confederation of British Industry]] which announced that it would challenge their legality. The Conservatives put down a motion in the House of Commons to revoke the sanctions. A co-ordinated protest by left-wing Labour MPs over spending on defence forced the debate set for 7 December to be postponed; however on 13 December an anti-sanctions amendment was passed by 285 to 279. The substantive motion as amended was then passed by 285 to 283. James Callaghan put down a further motion of confidence for the next day, which the government won by ten votes (300 to 290), but accepted that his government could not use sanctions. In effect this deprived the government of any means of enforcing the 5 per cent limit on private industry.\n\n==Severe weather==\n\nA mild autumn turned cold on the morning of 25 November when temperatures recorded at [[Heathrow Airport]] dropped from {{convert|14|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|0|\u00b0C}} overnight, with some snowflakes. Throughout most of the following month, wintry conditions lingered, only for temperatures to rise well above {{convert|10|\u00b0C}} around Christmas. On 30 December, the cold returned, along with rain that soon turned to snow; the next day 1978 ended with Heathrow recording a high of only {{convert|-3|\u00b0C}} amid steady snowfall.<ref name=\"The British and their weather\">{{cite book |last1=Nobbs |first1=Patrick |title=The Story of the British and Their Weather: From Frost Fairs to Indian Summers |date=2015 |publisher=Amberley Publishing Ltd. |isbn=9781445644615 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wUp4BgAAQBAJ&pg=PT92&lpg=PT9 |accessdate=April 20, 2020 |chapter=9; The Winter of Discontent 1978\u201379}}</ref>\n\nThe effects were more severe outside of London. [[Ilfracombe]] and other towns in [[North Devon]] could only be reached by helicopter as many roads could not be adequately cleared. The [[Royal Automobile Club]] blamed local councils, who in turn pointed to unresolved issues with their unions and staff shortages. Two Scottish trains near [[Stirling]] were stuck in the snow, leaving 300 passengers stranded. Only three League football matches could take place over the [[New Year's Day|New Year's]] holiday, and all rugby contests were canceled.<ref name=\"The British and their weather\" />\n\n==Lorry drivers==\nWith the government now having no way of enforcing its pay policy, unions which had not yet put in pay claims began to increase their aim. The first to take  action were [[truck|lorry]] drivers, members of the TGWU. Large numbers of the lorry drivers worked on oil tankers, and drivers working for [[BP]] and [[Esso]] began an overtime ban in support of rises of up to 40 per cent on 18 December. With supplies of oil being disrupted, the [[Cabinet Office]] prepared \"Operation Drumstick\", by which the [[British Army|Army]] were put on standby to take over from the tanker drivers. However, the operation would need the declaration of a [[state of emergency]] in order to allow conscription of the assets of the oil companies, and the government drew back from such a step. Before the situation developed into a crisis the oil companies settled on wage rises of around 15 per cent.\n\nFrom 3 January 1979 an unofficial strike of all TGWU lorry drivers began. With petrol distribution held up, petrol stations closed across the country. The strikers also [[Picketing (protest)|picketed]] the main ports. The strikes were made official on 11 January by the TGWU and 12 January by the United Road Transport Union. With 80 per cent of the nation's goods transported by road, essential supplies were put in danger as striking drivers picketed those firms that continued to work. While the oil tanker drivers were working, the main refineries were also targeted and the tanker drivers let the strikers know where they were going, allowing for flying pickets to turn them back at their destination. More than a million UK workers were laid off temporarily during the disputes.\n\nA further plan was drawn up to call a state of emergency and safeguard essential supplies through the Army, regarding which the government warned the TGWU leadership, which resulted in the union accepting (12 January 1979) a list of emergency supplies which were officially exempt from action. In practice, what counted as an emergency was left up to local officials of the TGWU to determine, and practice across the country varied according to the views of the local shop stewards who established \"dispensation committees\" to decide. When strikers in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] did not allow the correct mix of animal feed through to local farms, the farmers dropped the bodies of dead piglets and chickens outside the union offices; the union contended that the farmers had actually wrung the chicken's necks to kill them, and the piglets had been killed when the sow rolled over and crushed them.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn 29 January, lorry drivers in the South West accepted a deal awarded by an [[arbitration|arbitration panel]] of a rise of up to 20 per cent, just \u00a31 per week less than the union had been striking for; this settlement proved a model which was accepted throughout the country.\n\n==\"Crisis? What crisis?\"==\nOn 10 January, [[James Callaghan]] arrived back from a [[Guadeloupe Conference|summit in Guadeloupe]] in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. Having been tipped off that the press were present, his press secretary Tom McCaffrey advised him to say nothing and return immediately to work, but his political adviser [[Thomas McNally, Baron McNally|Tom McNally]] thought that the image of Callaghan returning and declaring his intent to take control of the situation would be reassuring. Callaghan therefore decided to give a press conference at [[Heathrow Airport]]. To McNally's dismay Callaghan was jocular and referred to having had a swim in the Caribbean during the summit. He was then asked (by a reporter from the ''[[Evening Standard]]'') \"What is your general approach, in view of the mounting chaos in the country at the moment?\" and replied:\n\n{{Quote|Well, that's a judgment that you are making. I promise you that if you look at it from outside, and perhaps you're taking rather a parochial view at the moment, I don't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos.}}\n\nThe next day's edition of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' featured the famous headline \"Crisis? What crisis?\" with a subheading \"Rail, lorry, jobs chaos \u2013 and Jim blames Press\", condemning Callaghan as being \"out of touch\" with British society.<ref name=bbc>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge79.shtml BBC News \u2013 History of the Winter of Discontent]</ref>\n\n==Public sector employees==\n22 January 1979 was the biggest individual day of strike action since the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike]] of 1926, and many workers stayed out indefinitely afterwards.  With many in the private sector having achieved substantial rises, the public sector unions became increasingly concerned to keep pace in terms of pay. The government had already announced a slight weakening of the policy on 16 January, which gave the unions cause for hope that they might win and use free collective bargaining. Train drivers belonging to [[ASLEF]] and the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] had already begun a series of 24-hour strikes, and the [[Royal College of Nursing]] conference on 18 January decided to ask that the pay of nurses be increased to the same level in real terms as 1974, which would mean a 25 per cent average rise.  The public sector unions labelled the date the \"Day of Action\", in which they held a 24-hour strike and marched to demand a \u00a360 per week minimum wage.\n\nWith the succession of strikes having been called and then won, many groups of workers began to take unofficial action \u2013 often without the consent or support of the union leaderships. Ambulance drivers began to take strike action in mid-January, and in parts of the country (London, West Midlands, [[Cardiff]], [[Glasgow]] and the west of Scotland) their action included refusing to attend 999 emergency calls. In these areas, the Army was drafted in to provide a skeleton service. Ancillary hospital staff also went on strike.<ref name=bbc/> On 30 January, the [[Secretary of State for Social Services]] [[David Ennals]] announced that 1,100 of 2,300 [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospitals were only treating emergencies, that practically no ambulance service was operating normally, and that the ancillary health service workers were deciding which cases merited treatment. The media reported with scorn that [[cancer]] patients were being prevented from getting essential treatment.\n\n===Gravediggers' strike===\nA notorious industrial action during the winter, and one which was later frequently referred to by Conservative politicians, was the strike by gravediggers, members of the [[GMWU]] in [[Liverpool]] and in [[Tameside]] near [[Manchester]].<ref>Moore (2014), p. 399.</ref> Eighty gravediggers being on strike, [[Liverpool City Council]] hired a factory in [[Speke]] to store the corpses until they could be buried. The Department of Environment noted that there were 150 bodies stored at the factory at one point, with 25 more added every day. The reports of unburied bodies caused concern with the public.<ref name=\"Travis\">{{cite news|last=Travis|first=Alan|title=National archives: Fear of fights at cemetery gates during 1979 winter of discontent|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/30/liverpool-gravedigger-strikes|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 December 2009}}</ref> On 1 February a persistent journalist asked the Medical Officer of Health for Liverpool, Dr Duncan Bolton, what would be done if the strike continued for months, Bolton speculated that [[burial at sea]] would be considered. Although his response was hypothetical, in the circumstances it caused great alarm. Other alternatives were considered, including allowing the bereaved to dig their own funeral's graves, deploying troops, and engaging private contractors to inter the bodies.  The main concerns were said to be aesthetic because bodies could be safely stored in heat-sealed bags for up to six weeks.<ref name=\"Travis\"/> Bolton later reported being \"horrified\" by the sensationalised reportage of the strike in the mass media.<ref>James Thomas, '\"Bound by History\": The Winter of Discontent in British Politics 1979\u20132004', ''Media, Culture and Society'', 29 (2007), p. 270.</ref> The gravediggers eventually settled for a 14 per cent rise after a fortnight's strike.\n\n===Waste collectors===\nWith many collectors having been on strike since 22 January, local authorities began to run out of space for storing waste and used local parks under their control. The Conservative controlled [[Westminster City Council]] used [[Leicester Square]] in the heart of London's West End for piles of rubbish and, as the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' reported, this attracted [[rat]]s.\n\nOn 21 February, a settlement of the local authority workers' dispute was agreed, whereby workers got an 11 per cent rise, plus \u00a31 per week, with the possibility of extra rises, should a pay comparability study recommend them. Some left-wing local authorities, among them the [[London Borough of Camden]], conceded the union demands in full (known as the \"Camden surplus\") and then saw an investigation by the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|District Auditor]], which eventually ruled it a breach of [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]]{{refn|Owed to the payers, the ratepayers of the area|group= n}} and therefore illegal. Camden Borough councillors, among them [[Ken Livingstone]], avoided [[Surcharge (sanction on public servant)|surcharge]]. Livingstone was Leader of the [[Greater London Council]] at the time the decision not to impose a surcharge was made.\n\n==End of the strikes==\nStrikes by essential services dismayed many senior ministers in the Labour government who had been close to the trade union movement, who had thought it unlikely that trade unionists would take such action. Among these was Prime Minister James Callaghan himself, who had built his political career on his connection to the trade unions, and had practically founded one, the [[Inland Revenue Staff Federation]]. Callaghan called the actions of the strikers \"free collective vandalism\".<ref>{{cite web |title=CALLAGHAN DEPICTS STRIKERS AS VANDALS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/02/archives/callaghan-depicts-strikers-as-vandals-britons-woes-mount-as-workers.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=30 November 2019 |date=2 February 1979}}</ref><ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nThe government was negotiating with the senior union leaders and on 11 February came to agreement on a proposal to be put to the TUC General Council. On 14 February the General Council agreed the concordat, published under the title \"The Economy, the Government, and Trade Union Responsibilities\".{{refn|The significance of a comprehensive agreement on [[Valentine's Day]] was remarked upon by the press{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}|group= n}} By this stage union executives had limited control over their members and strikes did not immediately cease, although they began to wind down from this point. In total in 1979, 29,474,000 working days were lost in industrial disputes, compared with 9,306,000 in 1978.\n\n==Political fallout==\nIn the summer before the Winter of Discontent, the minority Labour government's fortunes in the opinion polls had been improving and suggested that they could gain an overall majority in the event of a general election being held. However, on 7 September 1978, Callaghan announced that no general election would be held that year. Callaghan's failure to call an election would ultimately prove to be a costly mistake for his government.<ref name=calruns>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/7/newsid_2502000/2502781.stm |work=BBC News | title=1978: Callaghan accused of running scared | date=7 September 1978}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thatcher-loc.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margaret Thatcher]], who won the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] and became Prime Minister]]\nThe strikes appeared to have a profound effect on voting intention. According to [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]], Labour had a lead of 5 percentage points over the Conservatives in November 1978, which turned to a Conservative lead of 7.5 percentage points in January 1979, and of 20 percentage points in February. On 1 March, referendums on [[devolution]] to Scotland and Wales were held. That in Wales went strongly against devolution; that in Scotland produced a small majority in favour which did not reach the threshold set by Parliament of 40 per cent of that electorate. The government's decision not to press ahead with devolution immediately led the [[Scottish National Party]] to withdraw support from the government and on 28 March in a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|motion of no confidence the government lost by one vote]], precipitating a [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election]].\n\n[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[Margaret Thatcher]] had already outlined her proposals for restricting trade union power in a [[party political broadcast]] on 17 January in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. During the election campaign the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] made extensive use of the disruption caused during the strike. One broadcast on 23 April began with the Sun's headline \"Crisis? What Crisis?\" being shown and read out by an increasingly desperate voiceover interspersed with film footage of piles of rubbish, closed factories, picketed hospitals and locked graveyards. The scale of the Conservatives' victory in the general election has often been ascribed to the effect of the strikes, as well as their \"[[Labour Isn't Working]]\" campaign, and the party used film of the events of the winter in election campaigns for years to come.\n\nFollowing Thatcher's election win, she brought the [[post-war consensus]] to a halt and made drastic changes to trade union laws (most notably the regulation that unions had to hold a ballot among members before calling strikes) and as a result strikes were at their lowest level for 30 years by the time of the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], which the Conservatives won by a landslide.<ref name=\"83electionyoutube\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7noHkLaZ5VI|title=Conservative Party Election Broadcast (1983)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Organized labour|United Kingdom}}\n\n* [[Three-Day Week]], the [[Heath government]]'s reaction to the [[coal mining|coal miner]]s' [[work-to-rule]] and strikes in 1974, with a similarly disastrous impact on the government's popularity and led to the period of [[Labour government, 1974\u20131979|Labour government]].\n* [[Labour Isn't Working]]\n* [[Strike wave of 1945\u201346]], in U.S., followed by election of conservative Republican majorities in Congress who also passed laws restricting union activities\n* [[Winter of 1946\u201347 in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=n}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Beckett, Andy.
