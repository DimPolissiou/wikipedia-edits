Although it grows best in warm climates, the natural northern limit of the species is not due to a lack of cold tolerance, but to specific reproductive requirements: further north, regeneration is prevented by [[ice]] damage to seedlings. Larger trees are able to tolerate much lower temperatures and lower humidity.\n\nIn 2012 [[scuba diver]]s discovered an [[Submerged forest|underwater cypress forest]] several miles off the coast of [[Mobile, Alabama]], in 60 feet of water. The forest contains trees that could not be dated with radiocarbon methods, indicating that they are more than 50,000 years old and thus most likely lived in the early glacial interval of the last ice age. The cypress forest is well preserved, and when samples are cut they still smell like fresh cypress. A team, which has not yet published its results in a peer-reviewed journal, is studying the site. One possibility is that hurricane Katrina exposed the grove of bald cypress, which had been protected under ocean floor sediments.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/37977-underwater-cypress-forest-discovered.html|title=Primeval Underwater Forest Discovered in Gulf of Mexico|publisher=Live Science|accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reproduction and early growth==\n[[File:2014-11-02 14 12 30 Bald Cypress foliage during autumn along Hunters Ridge Drive in Hopewell Township, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|right|Foliage in autumn just before shedding]]\nThe bald cypress is monoecious.

Seeds will not germinate under water, but some will remain viable for 30 months under water. By contrast, seeds usually fail to germinate on better drained soils because of the lack of surface water. Thus, a soil saturated but not flooded for a period of one to three months after seedfall is required for germination.<ref name=\"Agriculture, Forest Service 1965\"/>\n\n[[File:Bald Cypress swamp and Spanish Moss.jpg|thumb|left|Bald cypress swamp and Spanish moss at First Landing State Park in Virginia Beach, VA]]\nAfter germination, seedlings must grow fast enough to keep at least part of their crowns above floodwaters for most of the growing season.<ref>Conner, William H, 1988, Natural and artificial regeneration of baldcypress [Taxodium distichum (L.)

Nursery beds are sown in spring with pretreated seeds or in fall with untreated seeds. Seedlings usually reach {{convert|75|to|100|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in height during their first (and usually only) year in the nursery. Average size of 1-0 nursery-grown seedlings in a seed source test including 72 families was {{convert|81.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|1.1|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nControl of competing vegetation may be necessary for a year or more for bald cypress planted outside of swamps. Five years after planting on a harrowed and bedded, poorly drained site in Florida, survival was high, but heights had increased only {{convert|30|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}, probably because of heavy herbaceous competition. Seedlings grown in a [[Crayfish|crawfish]] [[Aquaculture|pond]] in [[Louisiana]], where weed control and soil moisture were excellent through June, averaged {{convert|2.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|3.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} diameter at breast heigh after five years. However, a replicate of the same sources planted in an old soybean field, where weed control and soil moisture were poor, resulted in the same diameter, but a smaller average seedling height of {{convert|2.1|m|ft|abbr=on}}<!-- (John R. Toliver, unpublished data)-->. When planted in a residential yard and weeded and watered, they averaged {{convert|3.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall three years later.\n\n===Vegetative reproduction===\n\nBald cypress is one of the few conifer species that sprouts. Thrifty sprouts are generally produced from stumps of young trees, but trees up to 60 years old also send up healthy sprouts if the trees are cut during the fall or winter. However, survival of these sprouts is often poor, and those that live are usually poorly shaped and do not make quality sawtimber trees. Stumps of trees up to 200 years old may also sprout, but the sprouts are not as vigorous and are more subject to wind damage as the stump decays. In the only report on the rooting of bald cypress cuttings found in the literature, cuttings from trees five years old rooted better than those from older trees.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:Bald cypress Atchafalaya Basin.jpg|left|thumb|125px|A bald cypress in the Atchafalaya Basin of Louisiana]]\n[[File:Bald cypress knees in duckweed.JPG|thumb|left|125px|Bald cypress knees in [[duckweed]]]]\nThe seeds remain viable for less than one year, and are dispersed in two ways. One is by water: the seeds float and move on water until flooding recedes or the cone is deposited on shore. The second is by wildlife: [[squirrel]]s eat seeds, but often drop some scales from the cones they harvest. Seeds do not germinate under water and rarely germinate on well-drained soils; seedlings normally become established on continuously saturated, but not flooded, soils for one to three months. After germination, seedlings must grow quickly to escape floodwaters; they often reach a height of 20\u201375&nbsp;cm (up to 100&nbsp;cm in fertilized [[nursery (horticulture)|nursery]] conditions) in their first year. Seedlings die if inundated for more than about two to four weeks. Natural regeneration is therefore prevented on sites that are always flooded during the growing season. Although vigorous saplings and stump sprouts can produce viable seed, most specimens do not produce seed until they are about 30 years old. In good conditions, bald cypress grows fairly fast when young, then more slowly with age. Trees have been measured to reach 3 m in five years, 21 m in 41 years, and 36 m in height in 96 years; height growth has largely ceased by the time the trees are 200 years old. Some individuals can live over 1,000 years. Determination of the age of an old tree may be difficult because of frequent missing or false [[growth ring|ring]]s of stemwood caused by variable and stressful growing environments.\n\n[[File:Cypress 8001.JPG|thumb|Bald cypress forest in winter, showing \"knees\" and (brown) high flood level, Lynches River, [[Johnsonville, South Carolina]]]]\nBald cypress trees growing in swamps have a peculiarity of growth called [[cypress knee]]s. These are woody projections from the root system project above the ground or water. Their function was once thought to be to provide [[oxygen]] to the roots, which grow in the low dissolved oxygen waters typical of a swamp (as in [[mangrove]]s). However, evidence for this is scant; in fact, roots of swamp-dwelling specimens whose knees are removed do not decrease in oxygen content and the trees continue to thrive. Another more likely function is structural support and stabilization. Bald cypress trees growing on flood-prone sites tend to form buttressed bases, but trees grown on drier sites may lack this feature. Buttressed bases and a strong, intertwined root system allow them to resist very strong winds; even [[hurricane]]s rarely overturn them.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />\n\nMany agents damage ''T. distichum'' trees. The main damaging (in some cases lethal) agent is the [[fungus]] ''Lauriliella taxodii<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.speciesfungorum.org/Names/SynSpecies.asp?RecordID=819213|title=Species Fungorum - Species synonymy|website=www.speciesfungorum.org|access-date=2019-01-21}}</ref>'', which causes a brown pocket rot known as \"pecky cypress.\" It attacks the heartwood of living trees, usually from the crown down to the roots. A few other fungi attack the sapwood and the heartwood of the tree, but they do not usually cause serious damage. [[Insect]]s such as the cypress flea beetle (''[[Systena marginalis]]'') and the bald cypress leafroller (''[[Archips goyerana]]'') can seriously damage trees by destroying leaves, cones or bark. [[Coypu|Nutrias]] also clip and unroot young bald cypress seedlings, sometimes killing a whole plantation in a short amount of time.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />\n\n==Conservation==\nIn 2002, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources identified ''T. distichum'' as a state protected plant with the status of Threatened. Globally, the species is listed as of [[Least-concern species|Least Concern]] by the [[IUCN]].\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n[[File:Taxodium distichum02.jpg|thumb|right|<center>Timber</center>]]\nThe bald cypress is hardy and can be planted in hardiness zones 4 through 10 in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arborday.org/trees/treeguide/treedetail.cfm?itemID=787|title=Baldcypress Tree on the Tree Guide at arborday.org|website=www.arborday.org|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref> The species is a popular [[ornamental tree]] that is cultivated for its light, feathery foliage and orangey brown to dull red autumnal color. In cultivation it thrives on a wide range of soils, including well-drained sites where it would not grow naturally because juvenile seedlings cannot compete with other vegetation. Cultivation is successful far north of its native range, even to southern [[Canada]]. It is also commonly planted in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and other [[temperateness|temperate]] and [[subtropical]] locales. It does, however, require hot summers for good growth. When planted in locales with the cool summers of [[oceanic climate]]s, growth is healthy but very slow; some specimens in northeastern [[England]] have only grown to 4\u20135 m tall in 50 years<ref>Tree Register of the British Isles</ref> and do not produce cones. One of the oldest specimens in [[Europe]] was planted in the 1900s in the [[Arboretum de P\u00e9zanin]] in [[Burgundy]], [[France]].\n\nBald cypress has great merchantable yields.

The forest contains trees that could not be dated with radiocarbon methods, indicating that they are more than 50,000 years old and thus most likely lived in the early glacial interval of the last ice age. The cypress forest is well preserved, and when samples are cut they still smell like fresh cypress. A team, which has not yet published its results in a peer-reviewed journal, is studying the site.

Seeds will not germinate under water, but some will remain viable for 30 months under water. By contrast, seeds usually fail to germinate on better drained soils because of the lack of surface water. Thus, a soil saturated but not flooded for a period of one to three months after seedfall is required for germination.<ref name=\"Agriculture, Forest Service 1965\"/>\n\n[[File:Bald Cypress swamp and Spanish Moss.jpg|thumb|left|Bald cypress swamp and Spanish moss at First Landing State Park in Virginia Beach, VA]]\nAfter germination, seedlings must grow fast enough to keep at least part of their crowns above floodwaters for most of the growing season.<ref>Conner, William H, 1988, Natural and artificial regeneration of baldcypress [Taxodium distichum (L.)

Nursery beds are sown in spring with pretreated seeds or in fall with untreated seeds. Seedlings usually reach {{convert|75|to|100|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in height during their first (and usually only) year in the nursery. Average size of 1-0 nursery-grown seedlings in a seed source test including 72 families was {{convert|81.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|1.1|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nControl of competing vegetation may be necessary for a year or more for bald cypress planted outside of swamps. Five years after planting on a harrowed and bedded, poorly drained site in Florida, survival was high, but heights had increased only {{convert|30|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}, probably because of heavy herbaceous competition. Seedlings grown in a [[Crayfish|crawfish]] [[Aquaculture|pond]] in [[Louisiana]], where weed control and soil moisture were excellent through June, averaged {{convert|2.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|3.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} diameter at breast heigh after five years. However, a replicate of the same sources planted in an old soybean field, where weed control and soil moisture were poor, resulted in the same diameter, but a smaller average seedling height of {{convert|2.1|m|ft|abbr=on}}<!-- (John R. Toliver, unpublished data)-->. When planted in a residential yard and weeded and watered, they averaged {{convert|3.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall three years later.\n\n===Vegetative reproduction===\n\nBald cypress is one of the few conifer species that sprouts. Thrifty sprouts are generally produced from stumps of young trees, but trees up to 60 years old also send up healthy sprouts if the trees are cut during the fall or winter. However, survival of these sprouts is often poor, and those that live are usually poorly shaped and do not make quality sawtimber trees. Stumps of trees up to 200 years old may also sprout, but the sprouts are not as vigorous and are more subject to wind damage as the stump decays. In the only report on the rooting of bald cypress cuttings found in the literature, cuttings from trees five years old rooted better than those from older trees.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:Bald cypress Atchafalaya Basin.jpg|left|thumb|125px|A bald cypress in the Atchafalaya Basin of Louisiana]]\n[[File:Bald cypress knees in duckweed.JPG|thumb|left|125px|Bald cypress knees in [[duckweed]]]]\nThe seeds remain viable for less than one year, and are dispersed in two ways. One is by water: the seeds float and move on water until flooding recedes or the cone is deposited on shore. The second is by wildlife: [[squirrel]]s eat seeds, but often drop some scales from the cones they harvest. Seeds do not germinate under water and rarely germinate on well-drained soils; seedlings normally become established on continuously saturated, but not flooded, soils for one to three months. After germination, seedlings must grow quickly to escape floodwaters; they often reach a height of 20\u201375&nbsp;cm (up to 100&nbsp;cm in fertilized [[nursery (horticulture)|nursery]] conditions) in their first year. Seedlings die if inundated for more than about two to four weeks. Natural regeneration is therefore prevented on sites that are always flooded during the growing season. Although vigorous saplings and stump sprouts can produce viable seed, most specimens do not produce seed until they are about 30 years old. In good conditions, bald cypress grows fairly fast when young, then more slowly with age. Trees have been measured to reach 3 m in five years, 21 m in 41 years, and 36 m in height in 96 years; height growth has largely ceased by the time the trees are 200 years old. Some individuals can live over 1,000 years. Determination of the age of an old tree may be difficult because of frequent missing or false [[growth ring|ring]]s of stemwood caused by variable and stressful growing environments.\n\n[[File:Cypress 8001.JPG|thumb|Bald cypress forest in winter, showing \"knees\" and (brown) high flood level, Lynches River, [[Johnsonville, South Carolina]]]]\nBald cypress trees growing in swamps have a peculiarity of growth called [[cypress knee]]s. These are woody projections from the root system project above the ground or water. Their function was once thought to be to provide [[oxygen]] to the roots, which grow in the low dissolved oxygen waters typical of a swamp (as in [[mangrove]]s). However, evidence for this is scant; in fact, roots of swamp-dwelling specimens whose knees are removed do not decrease in oxygen content and the trees continue to thrive. Another more likely function is structural support and stabilization. Bald cypress trees growing on flood-prone sites tend to form buttressed bases, but trees grown on drier sites may lack this feature. Buttressed bases and a strong, intertwined root system allow them to resist very strong winds; even [[hurricane]]s rarely overturn them.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />\n\nMany agents damage ''T. distichum'' trees. The main damaging (in some cases lethal) agent is the [[fungus]] ''Lauriliella taxodii<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.speciesfungorum.org/Names/SynSpecies.asp?RecordID=819213|title=Species Fungorum - Species synonymy|website=www.speciesfungorum.org|access-date=2019-01-21}}</ref>'', which causes a brown pocket rot known as \"pecky cypress.\" It attacks the heartwood of living trees, usually from the crown down to the roots. A few other fungi attack the sapwood and the heartwood of the tree, but they do not usually cause serious damage. [[Insect]]s such as the cypress flea beetle (''[[Systena marginalis]]'') and the bald cypress leafroller (''[[Archips goyerana]]'') can seriously damage trees by destroying leaves, cones or bark. [[Coypu|Nutrias]] also clip and unroot young bald cypress seedlings, sometimes killing a whole plantation in a short amount of time.<ref name=\"Silvics\" />\n\n==Conservation==\nIn 2002, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources identified ''T. distichum'' as a state protected plant with the status of Threatened. Globally, the species is listed as of [[Least-concern species|Least Concern]] by the [[IUCN]].\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n[[File:Taxodium distichum02.jpg|thumb|right|<center>Timber</center>]]\nThe bald cypress is hardy and can be planted in hardiness zones 4 through 10 in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arborday.org/trees/treeguide/treedetail.cfm?itemID=787|title=Baldcypress Tree on the Tree Guide at arborday.org|website=www.arborday.org|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref> The species is a popular [[ornamental tree]] that is cultivated for its light, feathery foliage and orangey brown to dull red autumnal color. In cultivation it thrives on a wide range of soils, including well-drained sites where it would not grow naturally because juvenile seedlings cannot compete with other vegetation. Cultivation is successful far north of its native range, even to southern [[Canada]]. It is also commonly planted in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and other [[temperateness|temperate]] and [[subtropical]] locales. It does, however, require hot summers for good growth. When planted in locales with the cool summers of [[oceanic climate]]s, growth is healthy but very slow; some specimens in northeastern [[England]] have only grown to 4\u20135 m tall in 50 years<ref>Tree Register of the British Isles</ref> and do not produce cones. One of the oldest specimens in [[Europe]] was planted in the 1900s in the [[Arboretum de P\u00e9zanin]] in [[Burgundy]], [[France]].\n\nBald cypress has great merchantable yields. In virgin stands, yields from 112\u2013196 m\u00b3/ha were common, and some stands may have exceeded 1,000 m\u00b3/ha.

L.C. Rich. |access-date=2019-01-14}}{{USDA}}</ref>  The odorless wood, which closely resembles that of other ''[[Cupressus]]'' species, has long been valued for its resistance to water. Still usable prehistoric wood is often found in swamps as far north as New Jersey, and occasionally as far north as Connecticut, although it is more common in the southeastern states. This partially mineralized wood is harvested from swamps in the southeastern states, and is greatly prized for special uses such as for carvings. The fungus ''Lauriliella taxodii''<ref name=\":3\" /> causes a specific form of the wood called \"pecky cypress\", which is used for decorative wall [[paneling]].\n\nThe bald cypress was designated the official [[list of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of [[Louisiana]] in 1963.<ref>{{cite book|title=Louisiana Almanac, 2006-2007|page=431|last1=Calhoun|first1=Milburn|last2=Frois|first2=Jeanne|isbn=978-1-58980-307-7|publisher=Pelican Publishing|edition=17th|date=31 May 2006}}</ref> Some consider it to be a symbol of the southern swamps of the [[United States]].\n\nThe bald cypress was used by Native Americans to create coffins, homes, drums and canoes. [[Joshua Brown (Texas pioneer)|Joshua D.
