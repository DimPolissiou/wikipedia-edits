{"title_page": "Golden-section search", "text_new": "[[Image:GoldenSectionSearch.png|thumb|325px|right|Diagram of a golden-section search. The initial triplet of ''x'' values is {x1,x2,x3}. If f(x<sub>4</sub>)=f<sub>4a</sub>, the triplet {x<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>,x<sub>4</sub>} is chosen for the next iteration. If f(x<sub>4</sub>)=f<sub>4b</sub>, the triplet {x<sub>2</sub>,x<sub>4</sub>,x<sub>3</sub>} is chosen.]]\n\nThe '''golden-section search''' is a technique for finding an [[extremum]] (minimum or maximum) of a function inside a specified interval. For a strictly [[unimodal function]] with an extremum inside the interval, it will find that extremum, while for an interval containing multiple extrema (possibly including the interval boundaries), it will converge to one of them. If the only extremum on the interval is on a boundary of the interval, it will converge to that boundary point. The method operates by successively narrowing the range of values on the specified interval, which makes it relatively slow, but very robust. The technique derives its name from the fact that the algorithm maintains the function values for four points whose three interval widths are in the ratio ''2-&phi;:2&phi;-3:2-&phi;'' where ''&phi;'' is the [[golden ratio]]. These ratios are maintained for each iteration and are maximally efficient. Excepting boundary points, when searching for a minimum, the central point is always less than or equal to the outer points, assuring that a minimum is contained between the outer points. The converse is true when searching for a maximum. The algorithm is the limit of [[#Fibonacci_search|Fibonacci search]] (also described below) for many function evaluations. Fibonacci search and golden-section search were discovered by [[Jack Kiefer (mathematician)|Kiefer]] (1953) (see also Avriel and Wilde (1966)).\n\n==Basic idea==\n\nThe discussion here is posed in terms of searching for a minimum (searching for a maximum is similar) of a [[Unimodal function|unimodal]] function. Unlike finding a zero, where two function evaluations with opposite sign are sufficient to bracket a root, when searching for a minimum, three values are necessary. The golden-section search is an efficient way to progressively reduce the interval locating the minimum. The key is to observe that regardless of how many points have been evaluated, the minimum lies within the interval defined by the two points adjacent to the point with the least value so far evaluated.\n\nThe diagram above illustrates a single step in the technique for finding a minimum. The functional values of <math>f(x)</math> are on the vertical axis, and the horizontal axis is the ''x'' parameter. The value of <math>f(x)</math> has already been evaluated at the three points: <math>x_1</math>, <math>x_2</math>, and <math>x_3</math>. Since <math>f_2</math> is smaller than either <math>f_1</math> or <math>f_3</math>, it is clear that a minimum lies inside the interval from <math>x_1</math> to <math>x_3</math>.\n\nThe next step in the minimization process is to \"probe\" the function by evaluating it at a new value of ''x'', namely <math>x_4</math>. It is most efficient to choose <math>x_4</math> somewhere inside the largest interval, i.e. between <math>x_2</math> and <math>x_3</math>.

For a strictly [[unimodal function]] with an extremum inside the interval, it will find that extremum, while for an interval containing multiple extrema (possibly including the interval boundaries), it will converge to one of them. If the only extremum on the interval is on a boundary of the interval, it will converge to that boundary point. The method operates by successively narrowing the range of values on the specified interval, which makes it relatively slow, but very robust. The technique derives its name from the fact that the algorithm maintains the function values for four points whose three interval widths are in the ratio ''2-&phi;:2&phi;-3:2-&phi;'' where ''&phi;'' is the [[golden ratio]]. These ratios are maintained for each iteration and are maximally efficient. Excepting boundary points, when searching for a minimum, the central point is always less than or equal to the outer points, assuring that a minimum is contained between the outer points. The converse is true when searching for a maximum. The algorithm is the limit of [[#Fibonacci_search|Fibonacci search]] (also described below) for many function evaluations. Fibonacci search and golden-section search were discovered by [[Jack Kiefer (mathematician)|Kiefer]] (1953) (see also Avriel and Wilde (1966)).\n\n==Basic idea==\n\nThe discussion here is posed in terms of searching for a minimum (searching for a maximum is similar) of a [[Unimodal function|unimodal]] function. Unlike finding a zero, where two function evaluations with opposite sign are sufficient to bracket a root, when searching for a minimum, three values are necessary. The golden-section search is an efficient way to progressively reduce the interval locating the minimum. The key is to observe that regardless of how many points have been evaluated, the minimum lies within the interval defined by the two points adjacent to the point with the least value so far evaluated.\n\nThe diagram above illustrates a single step in the technique for finding a minimum. The functional values of <math>f(x)</math> are on the vertical axis, and the horizontal axis is the ''x'' parameter. The value of <math>f(x)</math> has already been evaluated at the three points: <math>x_1</math>, <math>x_2</math>, and <math>x_3</math>. Since <math>f_2</math> is smaller than either <math>f_1</math> or <math>f_3</math>, it is clear that a minimum lies inside the interval from <math>x_1</math> to <math>x_3</math>.\n\nThe next step in the minimization process is to \"probe\" the function by evaluating it at a new value of ''x'', namely <math>x_4</math>. It is most efficient to choose <math>x_4</math> somewhere inside the largest interval, i.e. between <math>x_2</math> and <math>x_3</math>.  From the diagram, it is clear that if the function yields <math>f_{4a}</math>, then a minimum lies between <math>x_1</math> and <math>x_4</math>, and the new triplet of points will be <math>x_1</math>, <math>x_2</math>, and <math>x_4</math>. However, if the function yields the value <math>f_{4b}</math>, then a minimum lies between <math>x_2</math> and <math>x_3</math>, and the new triplet of points will be <math>x_2</math>, <math>x_4</math>, and <math>x_3</math>. Thus, in either case, we can construct a new narrower search interval that is guaranteed to contain the function's minimum.\n\n==Probe point selection==\n\nFrom the diagram above, it is seen that the new search interval will be either between <math>x_1</math> and <math>x_4</math> with a length of ''a''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''c'', or between <math>x_2</math> and <math>x_3</math> with a length of ''b''. The golden-section search requires that these intervals be equal. If they are not, a run of \"bad luck\" could lead to the wider interval being used many times, thus slowing down the rate of convergence. To ensure that ''b'' = ''a''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''c'', the algorithm should choose <math>x_4 = x_1 + (x_3 - x_2)</math>.\n\nHowever, there still remains the question of where <math>x_2</math> should be placed in relation to <math>x_1</math> and <math>x_3</math>. The golden-section search chooses the spacing between these points in such a way that these points have the same proportion of spacing as the subsequent triple <math>x_1, x_2, x_4</math> or <math>x_2, x_4, x_3</math>. By maintaining the same proportion of spacing throughout the algorithm, we avoid a situation in which <math>x_2</math> is very close to <math>x_1</math> or <math>x_3</math> and guarantee that the interval width shrinks by the same constant proportion in each step.\n\nMathematically, to ensure that the spacing after evaluating <math>f(x_4)</math> is proportional to the spacing prior to that evaluation, if <math>f(x_4)</math> is <math>f_{4a}</math> and our new triplet of points is <math>x_1</math>, <math>x_2</math>, and <math>x_4</math>, then we want\n\n:<math>\\frac{c}{a} = \\frac{a}{b}.</math>\n\nHowever, if <math>f(x_4)</math> is <math>f_{4b}</math> and our new triplet of points is <math>x_2</math>, <math>x_4</math>, and <math>x_3</math>, then we want\n\n:<math>\\frac{c}{b - c} = \\frac{a}{b}.</math>\n\nEliminating ''c'' from these two simultaneous equations yields\n\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)^2 - \\frac{b}{a} = 1,</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>\\frac{b}{a} = \\varphi,</math>\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the [[golden ratio]]:\n\n:<math>\\varphi = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} = 1.618033988\\ldots</math>\n\nThe appearance of the golden ratio in the proportional spacing of the evaluation points is how this search [[algorithm]] gets its name.\n\n==Termination condition==\n\nAny number of termination conditions may be applied, depending upon the application.

In order to approximate the probe positions of golden section search while probing only integer sequence indices, the variant of the algorithm for this case typically maintains a bracketing of the solution in which the length of the bracketed interval is a [[Fibonacci number]]. For this reason, the sequence variant of golden section search is often called ''[[Fibonacci search technique|Fibonacci search]]''.\n\nFibonacci search was first devised by [[Jack Kiefer (statistician)|Kiefer]] (1953) as a [[minimax]] search for the maximum (minimum) of a unimodal function in an interval.\n;;;\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ternary search]]\n* [[Brent's method]]\n* [[Binary search]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{citation\n | last = Kiefer\n | first = J.\n | authorlink = Jack Kiefer (mathematician)\n | title = Sequential minimax search for a maximum\n | jstor = 2032161\n | journal = [[Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society]]\n | volume = 4\n | year = 1953\n | issue = 3\n | pages = 502\u2013506\n | mr = 0055639 \n | doi = 10.2307/2032161| doi-access = free\n }}\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Avriel\n | first1 = Mordecai\n | last2 = Wilde\n | first2 = Douglass J.\n | title = Optimality proof for the symmetric Fibonacci search technique\n | journal = [[Fibonacci Quarterly]]\n | volume = 4\n | year = 1966\n | pages = 265\u2013269\n | mr = 0208812 }}\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Press | first1=WH | last2=Teukolsky | first2=SA | last3=Vetterling | first3=WT | last4=Flannery | first4=BP | year=2007 | title=Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing | edition=3rd | publisher=Cambridge University Press |  publication-place=New York | isbn=978-0-521-88068-8 | chapter=Section 10.2.

The \"Lest We Forget\" coin was reissued in 2009. In 2010, the Principality issued a $30 gold- and silver-plated brass coin to mark the 40th anniversary of independence. Following the death of his wife in 2013, Casley authorised a special commemorative coin to celebrate her life.<ref name=Coins/>\n\n===Commemorative coins===\n[[File:Hutt River Province coin 1991.JPG|left|thumb|A 1991 20-dollar coin was part of a series commemorating [[Operation Desert Storm]]]]\nIn the 1970s, Kevin Gale was hired to manage the marketing of Principality coins and stamps. In 1995 Gale died and it was found that in addition to promoting Principality coins and stamps, he had registered \"Hutt River Province\" as the name of a Queensland company of which he was sole owner and from which no profits were forwarded to the Principality.\n\nFrom 1984 to 1989, [[Johnson Matthey|Johnson Matthey Refining, Rochester, New York]], a manufacturer of precious metal products, manufactured limited numbers of commemorative coins for Mel Wacks, who had been appointed exclusive American distributor by Leonard Casley.\n\nIn 1989, production was transferred to the Continental Coin Company (in California). From 1989 to 1995, the mint produced various themed commemorative Hutt River Province coins which were sold on the US market. Although the total number of coins minted is unknown, it is known that 10,000 $20 coins were minted in 1991 to mark the 50th anniversary of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Up to 200 different commemorative coins in three denominations each ($5, $10 and $20) are believed to have been minted to commemorate Desert Storm, World War II, The Fathers of Baseball, etc. Prince Leonard authorized all these coins and received samples as well as royalties. All of these Principality coins are contained in the standard catalogue of ''Unusual World Coins'' by Colin Bruce II, edited by Tom Michael and George Cuhaj.

In 1920 his mother moved with the two children to [[Darmstadt]] , where the family came from. From 1921 to 1930 he went to school in Darmstadt.\n\nIn 1930 de Beauclair began studying general mechanical engineering at the [[Darmstadt University of Technology]]. After completing his studies, he was initially taken on as a research assistant and then as an assistant at the Institute for Practical Mathematics (IPM), headed by [[Alwin Walther]]. There he was involved in the construction of an automatic calculator with punched tape programming, which was destroyed during the bombing of Darmstadt like the entire IPM. He also worked on the development of devices for Fourier analysis . From 1939 he developed together with Hans-Joachim Dreyer, both from IPM to the company OTT in [[Kempten]], a new type of electromechanical cutting wheel integration system to solve differential equations, the DGM-IPM-Ott, of which there are still assemblies in the inventory of the German Museum Munich.\n\nIn 1942 he met [[Konrad Zuse]] in Berlin, who showed him the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3 computer system]]. As head of the precision engineering workshop at the IPM, de Beauclair subsequently supported Zuse with the work on the [[Z4 (computer)|Z4]] Among other things, the IPM supplied punching devices for punched tape that were used to control the program sequence and to save intermediate results. Zuse and de Beauclair became friends. In January 1945, de Beauclair became Dr.-Ing. With Alwin Walther at the TU Darmstadt with a thesis on multidimensional Fourier synthesis doctorate.\n\nIn April 1945, like many other men, he was interned by the French military for no reason, and brought to [[Alsace]] while traveling to the Allg\u00e4u .

Due to the microfilming, the documents should also be available in the EDP after processing and should therefore remain legally valid. In addition, the banks tried to save storage space in the early 1960s.
