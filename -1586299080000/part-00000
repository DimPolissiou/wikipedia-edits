The song was written, or at least begun, in the summer of 1974, after Dylan's [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|comeback tour]] with [[The Band]] that year. Dylan recorded the song in September 1974, but as with some other songs from ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'', re-recorded it in December 1974. Between the recordings, he often reworked the lyrics. A live version of the song was released on Dylan's 1976 album ''[[Hard Rain (Bob Dylan album)|Hard Rain]]'', and all of the studio outtakes from the September sessions were released on the deluxe edition of ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 14: More Blood, More Tracks]]'' in 2018. Some reviewers have speculated that the song is a reflection on Dylan's personal life, and in particular on his deteriorating relationship with his wife [[Sara Dylan]], whilst Dylan has denied that it is autobiographical.\n\n== Background and recording ==\nThe song was written, or at least begun, in the summer of 1974, after Dylan's [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|comeback tour]] with [[The Band]] that year and a separation from [[Sara Dylan]], who he had married in 1965.

The song was written, or at least begun, in the summer of 1974, after Dylan's [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|comeback tour]] with [[The Band]] that year. Dylan recorded the song in September 1974, but as with some other songs from ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'', re-recorded it in December 1974. Between the recordings, he often reworked the lyrics. A live version of the song was released on Dylan's 1976 album ''[[Hard Rain (Bob Dylan album)|Hard Rain]]'', and all of the studio outtakes from the September sessions were released on the deluxe edition of ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 14: More Blood, More Tracks]]'' in 2018. Some reviewers have speculated that the song is a reflection on Dylan's personal life, and in particular on his deteriorating relationship with his wife [[Sara Dylan]], whilst Dylan has denied that it is autobiographical.\n\n== Background and recording ==\nThe song was written, or at least begun, in the summer of 1974, after Dylan's [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|comeback tour]] with [[The Band]] that year and a separation from [[Sara Dylan]], who he had married in 1965. Dylan had moved to a farm in Minnesota with his brother, David Zimmerman and there started to write the songs that were recorded for his album ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]''.<ref name=\"UNCUT\">{{cite web |url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/shelter-from-the-storm-the-inside-story-of-bob-dylan-s-blood-on-the-tracks-15656/ |title=Shelter From The Storm \u2013 the inside story of Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks |last=Hasted |first=Nick |date=15 November 2013 |work=Uncut |access-date=6 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715011356/https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/shelter-from-the-storm-the-inside-story-of-bob-dylan-s-blood-on-the-tracks-15656 |archive-date=15 July 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the Spring of 1974, Dylan had taken art classes at [[Carnegie Hall]] and was influenced by his tutor [[Norman Raeben]].<ref name=\"UNCUT\" /><ref name=\"Rogovoy2009\">{{cite book|author=Seth Rogovoy|title=Bob Dylan: Prophet, Mystic, Poet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IdbgeObYgIkC&pg=PA160|date=24 November 2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-5983-2|pages=160\u2013}}</ref> and, in particular, Raeben's view of [[time]].<ref name=\"GillOdegard2004\">{{cite book|author1=Andy Gill|author2=Kevin Odegard|title=A Simple Twist of Fate: Bob Dylan and the Making of Blood on the Tracks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tt0HAQAAMAAJ|date=January 2004|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81231-6}}</ref> Dylan was later to say that \"Idiot Wind\" was \"a song I wanted to make as a painting.\"<ref name=\"Flanagan2010\">{{cite book|author=Bill Flanagan|title=Written in My Soul: Conversations with Rock's Great Songwriters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUAqAAAAQBAJ|date=1 April 2010|publisher=RosettaBooks|isbn=978-0-7953-1081-2|access-date=6 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506011534/https://books.google.com/books?id=BUAqAAAAQBAJ|archive-date=6 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> \"Idiot Wind\" was a derogatory phrase employed by Raeben and this may have inspired Dylan's use of it, although the term also appears in the poem ''June 1940'' by [[Weldon Kees]] and that may have been the reference point.<ref name=\"Wilentz2011\">{{cite book|author=Sean Wilentz|title=Bob Dylan in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sb5UygkZlH0C&pg=PA140|date=15 February 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4070-7411-5|pages=140\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDylan first recorded \"Idiot Wind\" in New York City on 12 September 1974 during the initial ''Blood on the Tracks'' sessions at [[A & R Recording|A&R Studios]].

He has played in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[History of the St. Louis Rams|St. Louis Rams]], [[Philadelphia Eagles]], [[Minnesota Vikings]], and [[Arizona Cardinals]]. Bradford attended [[Putnam City North High School]] in [[Oklahoma City]], where he starred in football, basketball and golf. As a senior quarterback in 2005, he threw for 2,029 yards and 17 touchdowns in 12 games. Bradford was not highly recruited coming out of high school, but he did receive a scholarship offer from the [[University of Oklahoma]], which he accepted. After a redshirt season in 2006, Bradford threw for 3,121 yards and 36 touchdowns as a redshirt freshman. In 2008, Bradford became only the second sophomore to win the [[Heisman Trophy]] as he led the highest-scoring offense in NCAA history, throwing for 4,720 yards with 50 touchdowns and just eight interceptions. He again led the nation in passing and also added five rushing touchdowns as the Sooners went 12-1 and advanced to the BCS national title game.\n\nBradford declared for the NFL Draft following the 2009 season and was drafted by the [[St. Louis Rams]] with the [[List of first overall National Football League draft picks|first overall]] selection in the [[2010 NFL Draft]]. That year, Bradford set the record for most completions by a rookie in NFL history, which helped earn him the [[NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year]] award. Prior to the start of the 2015 season, the Rams traded Bradford along with a 2015 fifth round pick to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in exchange for quarterback [[Nick Foles]], a 2015 fourth-round pick, and a 2016 second-round pick. Following his 2015 campaign with the Eagles, in which he set career-highs in passing yards (3,725), completion percentage (65%) and yards per attempt (7.0), the [[Minnesota Vikings]] acquired Bradford after their starting quarterback [[Teddy Bridgewater]] was lost to a season-ending knee injury before the start of the season.\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early years==\nBradford was born to Kent and Martha Bradford in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].<ref name=\"soonersports.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.soonersports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/football-depth-chart.html |title=Official Site of the Oklahoma Sooners |publisher=SoonerSports.com |date=September 22, 2010 |access-date=September 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925221001/http://www.soonersports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/football-depth-chart.html |archive-date=September 25, 2010 |df= }}</ref>  He attended [[Putnam City North High School]] in Oklahoma City, where he starred in [[high school football|football]], basketball, baseball, and golf for the Putnam City North Panthers.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.twincities.com/2016/09/24/vikings-qb-sam-bradford-was-an-all-everything-athlete-until-football-won-out/ |title=Vikings QB Sam Bradford was an all-everything athlete until football won out |date=September 24, 2016 |work=Twin Cities |access-date=January 25, 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref> Bradford played as a [[pitcher]] in [[baseball]], but gave up after his freshman year.

He has played in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[History of the St. Louis Rams|St. Louis Rams]], [[Philadelphia Eagles]], [[Minnesota Vikings]], and [[Arizona Cardinals]]. Bradford attended [[Putnam City North High School]] in [[Oklahoma City]], where he starred in football, basketball and golf. As a senior quarterback in 2005, he threw for 2,029 yards and 17 touchdowns in 12 games. Bradford was not highly recruited coming out of high school, but he did receive a scholarship offer from the [[University of Oklahoma]], which he accepted. After a redshirt season in 2006, Bradford threw for 3,121 yards and 36 touchdowns as a redshirt freshman. In 2008, Bradford became only the second sophomore to win the [[Heisman Trophy]] as he led the highest-scoring offense in NCAA history, throwing for 4,720 yards with 50 touchdowns and just eight interceptions. He again led the nation in passing and also added five rushing touchdowns as the Sooners went 12-1 and advanced to the BCS national title game.\n\nBradford declared for the NFL Draft following the 2009 season and was drafted by the [[St. Louis Rams]] with the [[List of first overall National Football League draft picks|first overall]] selection in the [[2010 NFL Draft]]. That year, Bradford set the record for most completions by a rookie in NFL history, which helped earn him the [[NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year]] award. Prior to the start of the 2015 season, the Rams traded Bradford along with a 2015 fifth round pick to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in exchange for quarterback [[Nick Foles]], a 2015 fourth-round pick, and a 2016 second-round pick. Following his 2015 campaign with the Eagles, in which he set career-highs in passing yards (3,725), completion percentage (65%) and yards per attempt (7.0), the [[Minnesota Vikings]] acquired Bradford after their starting quarterback [[Teddy Bridgewater]] was lost to a season-ending knee injury before the start of the season.\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early years==\nBradford was born to Kent and Martha Bradford in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].<ref name=\"soonersports.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.soonersports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/football-depth-chart.html |title=Official Site of the Oklahoma Sooners |publisher=SoonerSports.com |date=September 22, 2010 |access-date=September 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925221001/http://www.soonersports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/football-depth-chart.html |archive-date=September 25, 2010 |df= }}</ref>  He attended [[Putnam City North High School]] in Oklahoma City, where he starred in [[high school football|football]], basketball, baseball, and golf for the Putnam City North Panthers.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.twincities.com/2016/09/24/vikings-qb-sam-bradford-was-an-all-everything-athlete-until-football-won-out/ |title=Vikings QB Sam Bradford was an all-everything athlete until football won out |date=September 24, 2016 |work=Twin Cities |access-date=January 25, 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref> Bradford played as a [[pitcher]] in [[baseball]], but gave up after his freshman year.

Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012\u201313 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |title=Longest serving managers |publisher=League Managers Association |accessdate=14 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207195645/http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |archivedate=7 February 2015 |df=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2019\u201320 season, 6 managers have been sacked as of 28 December: [[Javi Gracia]] and [[Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores]] of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], [[Mauricio Pochettino]] of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Unai Emery]] of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Marco Silva]] of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Manuel Pellegrini]] of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].\n\nThere have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Professor Sue Bridgewater of the [[University of Liverpool]] and Dr. Bas ter Weel of the [[University of Amsterdam]], performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/soccernomics-does-sacking-manager-actually-make-difference |title=Soccernomics: Does sacking the manager actually make a difference? |date=13 March 2016 |work=FourFourTwo|access-date=14 December 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alex Ferguson.jpg|thumb|upright|Former Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] was the longest serving and most successful manager in Premier League history.|alt=The torso and head of a grey-haired white man in a football stadium.

Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012\u201313 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |title=Longest serving managers |publisher=League Managers Association |accessdate=14 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207195645/http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |archivedate=7 February 2015 |df=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2019\u201320 season, 6 managers have been sacked as of 28 December: [[Javi Gracia]] and [[Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores]] of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], [[Mauricio Pochettino]] of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Unai Emery]] of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Marco Silva]] of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Manuel Pellegrini]] of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].\n\nThere have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Professor Sue Bridgewater of the [[University of Liverpool]] and Dr. Bas ter Weel of the [[University of Amsterdam]], performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/soccernomics-does-sacking-manager-actually-make-difference |title=Soccernomics: Does sacking the manager actually make a difference? |date=13 March 2016 |work=FourFourTwo|access-date=14 December 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alex Ferguson.jpg|thumb|upright|Former Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] was the longest serving and most successful manager in Premier League history.|alt=The torso and head of a grey-haired white man in a football stadium.

The seat was created for the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]]. Since 2005 the MP has been [[David Davies (Welsh politician)|David Davies]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\nThe [[Monmouth (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Monmouth Welsh Assembly constituency]], created in 1999, has normally the same boundaries as the Westminster constituency. These cover a large area, omitting the mainly urban areas of [[Blaenau Gwent]] in the west and [[Newport, Wales]] in the south.\n\n==History==\nThe constituency is considered a safe seat of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] although the seat has been won by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in three general elections \u2013 in addition to the [[1991 Monmouth by-election|1991 by-election]].\n\nThe current MP is the Conservative [[David Davies (Welsh politician)|David Davies]], elected in 2005 and a former member for the Welsh Assembly seat of the same name. To avoid confusion with the Yorkshire Conservative [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], he is named in Hansard as \"David T.C. Davies\".\n\n== Boundaries ==\n\n[[Image:WalesGwent.png|frame|right|[[Preserved counties of Wales|Preserved county]] of [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]]<br> boundaries as defined in 2003.]]\n\n=== 1983 onwards ===\nThe constituency is one of eight covering the [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved county]] of [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]]. The other seven are [[Blaenau Gwent (UK Parliament constituency)|Blaenau Gwent]], [[Caerphilly (UK Parliament constituency)|Caerphilly]], [[Islwyn (UK Parliament constituency)|Islwyn]], [[Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney]], [[Newport East (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport East]], [[Newport West (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport West]] and [[Torfaen (UK Parliament constituency)|Torfaen]]. Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, however, straddles the boundary with the preserved county of [[Mid Glamorgan]]. It covers most of current local authority of [[Monmouthshire]], with the main towns being [[Chepstow]] and [[Monmouth]].\n\nFor the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], there were no changes to the boundaries of the Monmouth constituency stemming from the Fifth Review of the [[Boundary Commission for Wales]].<ref>[http://www.bcomm-wales.gov.uk/ Boundary Commission for Wales website]<br>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2006/20061041.htm ''The Parliamentary Constituencies and Assembly Electoral Regions (Wales) Order 2006'', OPSI website]</ref> Likewise there were no boundary changes in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]].\n\n=== 1918 to 1983 ===\nAs first used in the 1918 general election, the constituency was a creation of the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] as one of six constituencies covering the [[Monmouthshire (historic)|county of Monmouth]]. Prior to the 1918 election the county had been covered, nominally, by the county constituencies of [[Northern Monmouthshire]], [[Southern Monmouthshire]], and [[Western Monmouthshire]], and the [[Monmouth Boroughs (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouth Boroughs]] [[borough constituency]]. By 1918, however, administrative county boundaries were out of alignment with constituency boundaries. The new constituency boundaries took account of the new [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government]] boundaries.\n\nThe other Monmouthshire constituencies defined by the 1918 legislation were the county constituencies of [[Abertillery (UK Parliament constituency)|Abertillery]], [[Bedwellty (UK Parliament constituency)|Bedwellty]], [[Ebbw Vale (UK Parliament constituency)|Ebbw Vale]] and [[Pontypool (UK Parliament constituency)|Pontypool]], and the [[borough constituency]] of [[Newport (Monmouthshire) (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport]]. This general pattern was maintained until 1983, nine years after the administrative county they were based on had been abolished, but there were some boundary changes during the 1918 to 1983 period.\n\n[[Image:WalesMonmouthshireTrad.png|frame|right|[[Monmouthshire (historic)|County of Monmouth]]]]\nIn 1918 the Monmouth constituency was defined as consisting of the [[municipal borough]]s of [[Abergavenny]], and [[Monmouth]], the [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]s of Caerleon, Chepstow, and Usk, the [[rural district]]s of Abergavenny, Chepstow, Magor, Monmouth, Cwmbran and Pontypool, and part of the rural district of St Mellons.<ref name=\"Graig\">''[[Boundaries of Parliamentary Constituencies 1885-1972]]'' ({{ISBN|0-900178-09-4}}), F.

The result was the same list of boroughs and districts as for the 1951 election.<ref name=\"Graig\"/> 1951 boundaries were used also in the general elections of [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959]], [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]], [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966]], [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]], [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974]], [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] and [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]].\n\nIn 1974, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the local government county of Monmouth was abolished. For the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], new constituency boundaries were drawn, taking account of new local government boundaries.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\nThe

The seat was created for the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]]. Since 2005 the MP has been [[David Davies (Welsh politician)|David Davies]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\nThe [[Monmouth (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Monmouth Welsh Assembly constituency]], created in 1999, has normally the same boundaries as the Westminster constituency. These cover a large area, omitting the mainly urban areas of [[Blaenau Gwent]] in the west and [[Newport, Wales]] in the south.\n\n==History==\nThe constituency is considered a safe seat of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] although the seat has been won by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in three general elections \u2013 in addition to the [[1991 Monmouth by-election|1991 by-election]].\n\nThe current MP is the Conservative [[David Davies (Welsh politician)|David Davies]], elected in 2005 and a former member for the Welsh Assembly seat of the same name. To avoid confusion with the Yorkshire Conservative [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], he is named in Hansard as \"David T.C. Davies\".\n\n== Boundaries ==\n\n[[Image:WalesGwent.png|frame|right|[[Preserved counties of Wales|Preserved county]] of [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]]<br> boundaries as defined in 2003.]]\n\n=== 1983 onwards ===\nThe constituency is one of eight covering the [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved county]] of [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]]. The other seven are [[Blaenau Gwent (UK Parliament constituency)|Blaenau Gwent]], [[Caerphilly (UK Parliament constituency)|Caerphilly]], [[Islwyn (UK Parliament constituency)|Islwyn]], [[Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney]], [[Newport East (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport East]], [[Newport West (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport West]] and [[Torfaen (UK Parliament constituency)|Torfaen]]. Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, however, straddles the boundary with the preserved county of [[Mid Glamorgan]]. It covers most of current local authority of [[Monmouthshire]], with the main towns being [[Chepstow]] and [[Monmouth]].\n\nFor the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], there were no changes to the boundaries of the Monmouth constituency stemming from the Fifth Review of the [[Boundary Commission for Wales]].<ref>[http://www.bcomm-wales.gov.uk/ Boundary Commission for Wales website]<br>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2006/20061041.htm ''The Parliamentary Constituencies and Assembly Electoral Regions (Wales) Order 2006'', OPSI website]</ref> Likewise there were no boundary changes in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]].\n\n=== 1918 to 1983 ===\nAs first used in the 1918 general election, the constituency was a creation of the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] as one of six constituencies covering the [[Monmouthshire (historic)|county of Monmouth]]. Prior to the 1918 election the county had been covered, nominally, by the county constituencies of [[Northern Monmouthshire]], [[Southern Monmouthshire]], and [[Western Monmouthshire]], and the [[Monmouth Boroughs (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouth Boroughs]] [[borough constituency]]. By 1918, however, administrative county boundaries were out of alignment with constituency boundaries. The new constituency boundaries took account of the new [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government]] boundaries.\n\nThe other Monmouthshire constituencies defined by the 1918 legislation were the county constituencies of [[Abertillery (UK Parliament constituency)|Abertillery]], [[Bedwellty (UK Parliament constituency)|Bedwellty]], [[Ebbw Vale (UK Parliament constituency)|Ebbw Vale]] and [[Pontypool (UK Parliament constituency)|Pontypool]], and the [[borough constituency]] of [[Newport (Monmouthshire) (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport]]. This general pattern was maintained until 1983, nine years after the administrative county they were based on had been abolished, but there were some boundary changes during the 1918 to 1983 period.\n\n[[Image:WalesMonmouthshireTrad.png|frame|right|[[Monmouthshire (historic)|County of Monmouth]]]]\nIn 1918 the Monmouth constituency was defined as consisting of the [[municipal borough]]s of [[Abergavenny]], and [[Monmouth]], the [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]s of Caerleon, Chepstow, and Usk, the [[rural district]]s of Abergavenny, Chepstow, Magor, Monmouth, Cwmbran and Pontypool, and part of the rural district of St Mellons.<ref name=\"Graig\">''[[Boundaries of Parliamentary Constituencies 1885-1972]]'' ({{ISBN|0-900178-09-4}}), F. W. S. Craig 1972<br>Craig attributes the 1951 alteration to ''SI 1851/1390'' under section 2(3) of the [[House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949]]</ref> The same boundaries were used for the [[United Kingdom general election|general election]]s of [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]], [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923]], [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924]], [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]], [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]], [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]] and [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]].\n\nNew boundaries, created by the [[House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949]], were used for the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]], and the Monmouth constituency was defined as consisting of the municipal boroughs of Abergavenny and Monmouth, the urban districts of Caerleon, Chepstow, Cwmbran and Usk, and the rural districts of Abergavenny, Chepstow, [[Magor and St Mellons Rural District|Magor and St Mellons]], Monmouth, and Pontypool.<ref name=\"Graig\"/>\n\nFor the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951 general election]], there was some alteration to the boundaries of rural district of Magor and St Mellons.<ref name=\"Graig\"/>\n\nThe constituency was redefined again for the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]], taking account of new local government boundaries. The result was the same list of boroughs and districts as for the 1951 election.<ref name=\"Graig\"/> 1951 boundaries were used also in the general elections of [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959]], [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]], [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966]], [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]], [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974]], [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] and [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]].\n\nIn 1974, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the local government county of Monmouth was abolished. For the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], new constituency boundaries were drawn, taking account of new local government boundaries.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\nThe

She currently competes part-time in the [[ARCA Menards Series]], driving the No. 30 Ford for [[Rette Jones Racing]].\n\n==Racing career==\n===Early career===\nVan Wieringen began racing [[motocross]] at the age of five and eventually moved to [[kart racing]]. In 2011, she made the transition to full-sized race cars and scored a feature win at Spartan Speedway in [[Mason, MI]]. The following season, she won the Outlaw Super Late Model Championship at [[Springport Motor Speedway]]. Moving to the JEGS/CRA All-Star Series in 2013, Van Wieringen became the first female to win on the All-Stars Tour on September 22, 2013 at [[Lucas Oil Raceway]].<ref name=\"AboutD\">{{cite web | url=http://dominiqueracing.com/about/ | title=Dominique's Story | publisher=Dominique Van Wieringen Racing | accessdate=December 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nVan Wieringen signed with [[NEMCO Motorsports]] for the 2015 season, running super late models in various [[CRA Super Series]] and [[CARS Tour|CARS-Tour]] events, occasionally as a teammate to [[John Hunter Nemechek]]. After modest success, including leading several races and earning a few top-5s, along with some frustrations,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.foxsports.com/nascar/shake-and-bake/dominique-van-wieringen-fairgrounds-speedway-nashville-all-american-400-102015 | title=Take that!

She was awarded an honorable mention in the \"Breakout Driver\" category for her rookie campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hometracks.nascar.com/nknps-east/story/best-2016-kn-pro-series-east_12282016|title=Best of 2016: K&N Pro Series East|publisher=NASCAR|date=2016-12-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, she returned to Rette Jones Racing for one K&N Pro Series East race, finishing third at [[Langley Speedway (Virginia)|Langley Speedway]].\n\n===Camping World Truck Series===\nFollowing the conclusion of the [[2016 NASCAR K&N Pro Series East]] season, Van Wieringen made her debut in the [[NASCAR Camping World Truck Series]] at [[Phoenix International Raceway]] for [[Young's Motorsports]] in a partnership with Rette Jones, who provided the truck for that race. While running 15th on lap 26, she was shoved into turn 1 by [[Austin Wayne Self]] which would force her into [[Tommy Joe Martins]] and end her night early, she would finish 31st.<ref name=\"MSTD\">{{cite web | url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-truck/news/dominique-van-wieringen-to-make-nascar-truck-debut-at-phoenix-847457/ | title=Dominique Van Wieringen to make NASCAR Truck debut at Phoenix | publisher=Motorsport.com | date=November 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Years without a ride===\nIn 2018, Van Wieringen would make a return to racing while being an intern engineer for [[Joe Gibbs Racing]] in [[Modified stock car racing|Modified]]\u2019s at Corrigan Oil Speedway where she would score the pole and lead every lap up until a left front tire blew taking her out for the rest of the night.\n\nIn 2019, she would run the full schedule at [[Springport Motor Speedway]], driving her Van Wieringen Racing No. 7 Chevrolet. In all 5 of those races, she would win and take home the Track Championship.\n\n===ARCA Menards Series===\nVan Wieringen participated in ARCA's [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] testing in January 2020, and posted the fastest time in one of the sessions. She drove the No. 30 for her former team, Rette Jones Racing. RJR later signed her back to run the race at the track in February of that year. In the race, she was involved in [[The Big One (motorsport)|the big one]] and finished 25th.\n\n==Personal life==\nVan Wieringen is a [[Mechanical engineering]] student at the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]].<ref name=\"AboutD\"/> Her younger brother, Tristan, is also a race car driver, and he also drives for the Rette Jones team, running part-time in the [[ARCA Menards Series East]] for [[2020 ARCA Menards Series East|2020]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://speedsport.com/stock-cars/arca-stock-cars/van-wieringens-double-down-with-rette-jones-racing/ |title=Van Wieringen's Double Down with Rette Jones Racing |website=Speed Sport |date=February 6, 2020 |accessdate=February 8, 2020}}</ref> Her dad, Murray, owns DuroByte Motorsports, a [[Late model racing|Super Late Model]] [[Driver development program]], which currently fields the No. 5 [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] for Michael Clancy.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cra-racing.com/2015/08/17-year-old-tristan-van-wieringen-to-make-first-jegscra-all-stars-tour-start-of-2015/ | title=17-Year-Old Tristan Van Wieringen To Make First JEGS/CRA All-Stars Tour Start Of 2015 | publisher=CRA-Racing.com | date=August 5, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

In 2011, she made the transition to full-sized race cars and scored a feature win at Spartan Speedway in [[Mason, MI]]. The following season, she won the Outlaw Super Late Model Championship at [[Springport Motor Speedway]]. Moving to the JEGS/CRA All-Star Series in 2013, Van Wieringen became the first female to win on the All-Stars Tour on September 22, 2013 at [[Lucas Oil Raceway]].<ref name=\"AboutD\">{{cite web | url=http://dominiqueracing.com/about/ | title=Dominique's Story | publisher=Dominique Van Wieringen Racing | accessdate=December 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nVan Wieringen signed with [[NEMCO Motorsports]] for the 2015 season, running super late models in various [[CRA Super Series]] and [[CARS Tour|CARS-Tour]] events, occasionally as a teammate to [[John Hunter Nemechek]].

Over time, the group grew in number and expanded its activities by taking on educational responsibilities as well. After establishing \"Midreshet B'Yahad\", a Seminar Center of Judaism, Society and Zionism Studies, the group realized the need for a [[yeshiva]] as the next step in strengthening the existing projects by bringing youth to Yeruham.\n\nThe leader of this group, Shmuel Friedman Ben-Shalom, approached [[:he:\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5_\u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2|Rabbi Eliyhau Blumenzweig]], who at the time taught at [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], with a proposition to be the Rosh Yeshiva, which he accepted.

A typical day in Yeshiva will include two sessions of intensive Talmud study (''iyun'') and one of extensive study (''bekiut''). \n\nShachris at the Yeshiva is at 6:30am, followed by halachah seder until 8:00am. Breakfast is from 8:00am-8:30am. After breakfast is morning seder, which is typically gemara iyun, and it goes from 8:30am-1:00pm. Following morning seder is lunch and a break from 1:00pm-3pm. Mincha is at 3:00pm, followed by afternoon seder, from about 3:20pm-7:30pm. Afternoon seder consists of more iyun gemara, followed by a couple hours of emmunah. Many of the students use the entire afternoon seder for learning machshava, tanach, mussar, and emmunah. From 7:30pm-8:00pm is Maariv, followed by supper from 8:00pm-8:30pm. Night seder consists of learning bekiut, and it goes from 8:30pm until at least 11:00pm, although there is no given time for night seder to end, and many students learn until much later.[[File:Hayeshiva.jpg|thumb|Lunch room of the Yeshiva]]'''Daily Schedule''': \n\nShachrit: 6:30am-8:00am\n\nBreakfast: 8:00am-8:30am\n\nMorning seder: 8:30am-1:00pm\n\nLunch/break: 1:00pm-3:00pm\n\nMincha: 3:00pm-3:20pm\n\nAfternoon seder: 3:20pm-7:30pm\n\nSupper: 7:30pm-8:00pm\n\nMarriv: 8:00pm-8:30pm \n\nNight seder: 8:30pm-11:00pm (or later)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/26/46/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yhy.co.il|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>\n\nThe yeshiva guides its students to base their perspective upon the teachings of [[Yehuda Halevi|Rabbi Yehuda Halevi]] and the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Maharal of Prague]] in accordance with the ideology of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], as is often customary in Religious Zionist yeshivas. With the goal of educating students to deal independently with the challenges they face living as an observant Jews in modern time in mind, the yeshiva encourages a broader study of Biblical, rabbinic, and other classical and modern sources. Hence, the yeshiva curriculum contains weekly classes in [[Tanakh]], [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Hasidic philosophy]], and the works of Jewish scholars such as [[Maimonides]], [[Nachmanides]], [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] and many more.\n\n==Educational approach==\nThe yeshiva educates its students to be aware of their surroundings and attentive to the needs of society in general. The yeshiva believes that the keys to solving Israel\u2019s socioeconomic gaps lie in integration and education. All the students volunteer in the community mainly in the field of education.

Mincha is at 3:00pm, followed by afternoon seder, from about 3:20pm-7:30pm. Afternoon seder consists of more iyun gemara, followed by a couple hours of emmunah. Many of the students use the entire afternoon seder for learning machshava, tanach, mussar, and emmunah. From 7:30pm-8:00pm is Maariv, followed by supper from 8:00pm-8:30pm. Night seder consists of learning bekiut, and it goes from 8:30pm until at least 11:00pm, although there is no given time for night seder to end, and many students learn until much later.[[File:Hayeshiva.jpg|thumb|Lunch room of the Yeshiva]]'''Daily Schedule''': \n\nShachrit: 6:30am-8:00am\n\nBreakfast: 8:00am-8:30am\n\nMorning seder: 8:30am-1:00pm\n\nLunch/break: 1:00pm-3:00pm\n\nMincha: 3:00pm-3:20pm\n\nAfternoon seder: 3:20pm-7:30pm\n\nSupper: 7:30pm-8:00pm\n\nMarriv: 8:00pm-8:30pm \n\nNight seder: 8:30pm-11:00pm (or later)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/26/46/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yhy.co.il|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>\n\nThe yeshiva guides its students to base their perspective upon the teachings of [[Yehuda Halevi|Rabbi Yehuda Halevi]] and the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Maharal of Prague]] in accordance with the ideology of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], as is often customary in Religious Zionist yeshivas.\nWith the goal of educating students to deal independently with the challenges they face living as an observant Jews in modern time in mind, the yeshiva encourages a broader study of Biblical, rabbinic, and other classical and modern sources.

''Tucker''{{'}}s [[main battery]] consisted of five [[Dual-purpose gun|dual-purpose]] [[38 caliber 5-inch (127 mm) guns]].\n\nFirst assigned to the [[United States Battle Fleet]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]], ''Tucker'' operated along the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. After participating in [[naval exercise]]s in the [[Caribbean Sea]], she returned to duty in [[Territory of Hawaii|Hawaii]]. She then went on a goodwill tour to New Zealand, returning to Hawaii and docking at [[Pearl Harbor]]. When the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7{{nbsp}}December 1941, ''Tucker'' was undergoing an overhaul and was not attacked. Soon afterward, she began escorting convoys between the West Coast and Hawaii. ''Tucker'' was then tasked with escort duty to islands in the [[South Pacific Ocean|Sourth Pacific]].\n\n''Tucker'' steamed out of port on 1 August 1942, escorting a [[cargo ship]] to [[Espiritu Santo]]. They entered its harbor three days later, where the destroyer unknowingly entered a defensive [[minefield]] laid by the US Navy. ''Tucker'' struck at least one [[Naval mine|mine]] that tore her almost in two, sinking her and killing three sailors; the rest of the crew survived.\n\n==Design==\n\n===General characteristics===  \nThe [[Mahan-class destroyer]]s were improved versions of the preceding [[Farragut-class destroyer (1934)|''Farragut'' class]].{{sfn|Reiilly| 1983| p=28}} The ''Mahan''s' [[standard displacement]] was {{convert|150|LT|t|0|lk=in}} larger, and they were equipped with a more efficient steam [[propulsion]] system and designed to carry 12 torpedo tubes, an increase of four over the Farragut-class.  \n{{snf|Friedman| 2004| p=88}} \n\n''Tucker'' [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|1500|LT|t|0|lk=on}}\nat [[standard load]] and {{convert|1725|LT|t}} at [[deep load]].

''Tucker''{{'}}s [[main battery]] consisted of five [[Dual-purpose gun|dual-purpose]] [[38 caliber 5-inch (127 mm) guns]].\n\nFirst assigned to the [[United States Battle Fleet]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]], ''Tucker'' operated along the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. After participating in [[naval exercise]]s in the [[Caribbean Sea]], she returned to duty in [[Territory of Hawaii|Hawaii]]. She then went on a goodwill tour to New Zealand, returning to Hawaii and docking at [[Pearl Harbor]]. When the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7{{nbsp}}December 1941, ''Tucker'' was undergoing an overhaul and was not attacked. Soon afterward, she began escorting convoys between the West Coast and Hawaii. ''Tucker'' was then tasked with escort duty to islands in the [[South Pacific Ocean|Sourth Pacific]].\n\n''Tucker'' steamed out of port on 1 August 1942, escorting a [[cargo ship]] to [[Espiritu Santo]]. They entered its harbor three days later, where the destroyer unknowingly entered a defensive [[minefield]] laid by the US Navy. ''Tucker'' struck at least one [[Naval mine|mine]] that tore her almost in two, sinking her and killing three sailors; the rest of the crew survived.\n\n==Design==\n\n===General characteristics===  \nThe [[Mahan-class destroyer]]s were improved versions of the preceding [[Farragut-class destroyer (1934)|''Farragut'' class]].{{sfn|Reiilly| 1983| p=28}} The ''Mahan''s' [[standard displacement]] was {{convert|150|LT|t|0|lk=in}} larger, and they were equipped with a more efficient steam [[propulsion]] system and designed to carry 12 torpedo tubes, an increase of four over the Farragut-class.  \n{{snf|Friedman| 2004| p=88}} \n\n''Tucker'' [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|1500|LT|t|0|lk=on}}\nat [[standard load]] and {{convert|1725|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship's [[length overall|overall length]] was {{convert|341|ft|m|1}}, her [[beam (nautical)|beam]] was {{convert|35|ft|6|in|m|1}}, and her [[draft (hull)|draft]] was {{convert|10|ft|7|in|m|1}}. Her peace-time complement consisted of 158 officers and enlisted men.{{snf|Friedman|2004|pp=465\u2013466}}\n\nShe had a [[Tripod mast|tripod]] [[foremast]] and a pole mainmast. To improve the [[antiaircraft]] [[field of fire (weaponry)|field of fire]], her [[tripod]] foremast was constructed without nautical [[rigging]].{{sfn|Friedman|2004|p=88}} The destroyer was fitted with emergency [[diesel generators]], replacing the storage batteries of earlier destroyers. Gun crew shelters were also built fore and aft for the superimposed guns. A third set of quadruple torpedo tubes was added, with one mounted on the [[centerline (nautical)|centerline]] and two in the side positions.{{sfn |Friedman|2004|p=88}}\n\n===Machinery and armament===\n''Tucker'' was fitted with four [[water-tube boiler]]s built by either [[Babcock & Wilcox]] or [[Foster Wheeler]]. They generated the steam that propelled the two [[General Electric]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, developing {{convert|46,000|shp|abbr=on|lk=on}} for a maximum speed of {{convert|37|kn|lk=in}}. ''Tucker'' carried a maximum of {{convert|523|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]], with a trial range of {{convert|7300|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn|lk=in}}. The ship's\nwartime ranges were {{convert|6940|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn|lk=in}} and {{convert|4360|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|20|kn|lk=in}}.\nThe ship's design incorporated a new generation of land-based propulsion machinery. The boilers were capable of reaching {{convert|650\u2013700|F|C|sigfig=2}}, powering the high-pressure turbines with [[double reduction gearing|double reduction gears]] that enabled the turbines to run faster and more efficiently than in previous destroyer designs.{{sfn|Friedman|2004|p=88}}\n\n''Tucker''{{'}}s [[main battery]] consisted of five [[Dual-purpose gun|dual-purpose]] [[38 caliber 5-inch (127 mm) guns]], equipped with the MK{{nbsp}}33 gun [[fire-control system]].{{sfn|Friedman|2004|p=465}} \nThe ship's antiaircraft battery had four water-cooled [[.50 caliber machine gun]]s (12.7&nbsp;mm).{{sfn|Hodges|Friedman|1979|p=111}} The ship was fitted with three quadruple torpedo-tube mounts for twelve {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo]]es, guided by the Mark{{nbsp}}27 torpedo fire-control system.
