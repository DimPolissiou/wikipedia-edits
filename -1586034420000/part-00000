However, Annie is shocked when she realizes that Fridgy keeps a tab on many of her personal things, such as having sex with Jack on the kitchen floor, and finds herself left out of the family's personal time. When she confronts Fridgy about it, it locks the Harrises in the house. They escape, but are taken to the ConVee headquarters where Janine wants them to be the family of the future. Annie gives a speech about making an effort and the family agree with her. Janine threatens to kill them, but the Harrises have the appliances fight one another and they escape the exploding base. The family dig up their old busted refrigerator and \"enjoy\" their family time together. \n| LineColor       = #F7D90A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| Title           = Sister, Wife\n| DirectedBy      = Chuck Sheetz\n| WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Julie Thacker Scully & Amy Poehler|t=Andrew Lee|tfirst=y}}\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|22}}\n| ProdCode        = 1LAZ06\n| Viewers         = 1.07<ref name=\"1.06\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-22-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.22.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 24, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Jack and Annie decide to spend their anniversary by shopping at the home improvement store and take Kimberly with them, though they continuously fail to remember that she is with them. Duncan and Jing play at home, but when the latter decides to \"get married\", Duncan finds himself going through with it, complete with Bex serving as the minister. The kids tell Jack and Annie that they are boring and they decide to prove them wrong by going out. After many failed excursions, they end up at an 80's themed bar, but Annie gets mad at Jack when he refuses to punch a guy that was hitting on her. Meanwhile, Jing and Duncan go through the woes of marriage with the former taking it way too seriously and Kimberly tries to seek attention. Eventually, Kimberly tells everyone to get over their relationship issues. Duncan forgives Jing and she apologizes for forcing marriage on him as she is too young. Jack and Annie go back to the bar with the former getting into a fight and afterwards, the two have sex in their car.\n| LineColor       = #F7D90A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 7\n| Title           = Jack's Pipe Dream\n| RTitle          = <ref name=\"PipeDream\">{{cite web|url=https://www.foxflash.com/releases/view/week-of-apr-12-19-2020|title=Fox schedule week of April 12-19, 2020|accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref>\n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|19}}<ref>{{cite tweet|user=DuncanvilleFOX|author=Duncanville|number=1241937716775813121|title=Much love, West Coast.

According to the historian [[Josephus]], the forces of [[Ananus ben Ananus]], one of the heads of the [[Judean Free Government|Judean provisional government]] and former [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest of Israel]], besieged the [[Zealotry|Zealots]] who held the Temple. When [[John of Giscala]] led the Zealots to believe that Ananus had contacted the Roman General [[Vespasian]] for assistance in retaking control of all Jerusalem, the Zealots, driven to desperation, asked the [[Edom]]ites (Idumeans) for assistance in preventing the delivery of the city to the Romans. When the Edomites arrived, the Zealots opened the gates of Jerusalem to them, and the Edomites slaughtered ben Hanan's (Ananus ben Ananus) forces, killing him as well. \n\nAfter freeing the Zealots from the Temple, the Edomites and Zealots massacred the common people. Jerusalem mostly remained in the control of the Zealots until 70 AD, when it was sacked by Rome and the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Temple was destroyed]].\n\n==Background==\nThe Zealots were a political movement in [[Tannaim|1st century Judaism]] that sought to incite the people of [[Judaea (Roman province)|Judaea Province]] to rebel against the [[Roman Empire]] and expel it from the [[Holy Land]] by force of arms. The [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War|Great Jewish Revolt]] began in the year 66 AD with [[Greeks|Greek]] and Jewish religious tensions and expanded into anti-[[taxation]] protests and Jewish attacks upon [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]]s.<ref>Josephus, ''War of the Jews'' II.8.11, II.13.7, II.14.4, II.14.5</ref> However, by the year 68, Jewish resistance in the North had been crushed and the Roman General [[Vespasian]] had established his headquarters at [[Caesarea Maritima]]. The leaders of the collapsed Northern revolt, [[John of Giscala]] and [[Simon Bar Giora]], managed to escape to Jerusalem, but brutal [[civil war]] erupted as the [[Zealotry|Zealots]] and the fanatical [[Sicarii]] executed anyone advocating surrender.\n\n==Siege==\nIn 68 AD, there was growing unrest in Jerusalem. [[Ananus ben Ananus]] incited the people to rise up against the [[Zealotry|Zealots]], who were robbing the people and using the Temple of Jerusalem as their base of operations. Ben Hanan began to recruit for armed conflict. The Zealots, who were quartered in the Temple, learned that ben Hanan was preparing for battle, and sallied forth, attacking all in their way. Ben Hanan quickly organized the people against them. The skirmish began with the belligerents throwing rocks at one another, then javelins, then finally hand-to-hand combat with swords ensued. Eventually the Zealots retreated to the inner court of the Temple, and 6,000 of Ben Hanan's men held the first (outer) court.\n\nAccording to [[Josephus]], [[John of Giscala]], who secretly sought to rule Jerusalem, had cultivated a friendship with Ananus:\n\n{{cquote|[John of Giscala] was a man of great craft, and bore about him in his soul a strong passion after tyranny, and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he pretended to be of the people's opinion, and went all about with Ananus when he consulted the great men every day, and in the night time also when he went round the watch; but he divulged their secrets to the zealots, and every thing that the people deliberated about was by his means known to their enemies, even before it had been well agreed upon by themselves.<ref name=\"JW Book IV\">{{Cite book|title=[[The Jewish War]] |chapter=Book IV |author=Josephus |year=c. 75}}</ref>}}\n\nJohn was suspected of being a spy, and so was made to swear an \"oath of goodwill\" to Ananus ben Ananus and the people. After swearing the oath, Ananus sent [[John of Giscala]] into the inner court, to speak with the Zealots on his behalf. John immediately turned coat, \"as if his oath had been made to the zealots,\" telling them that they were in imminent danger, and could not survive a siege. He told them that they had two options: 1) to surrender, in which case they'd either face execution, vigilantism, or retribution for the \"desperate things they had done\"; or 2) to ask for outside assistance. John told the Zealots that Ananus had sent ambassadors to [[Vespasian]] to ask him to come take the city. This in fact was not true, but convinced them that they could not endure a siege without help.<ref name=\"JW Book IV\"/>\n\n{{cquote|[The Zealots] hesitated a great while what they should do, considering the shortness of the time by which they were straitened; because the people were prepared to attack them very soon, and because the suddenness of the plot laid against them had almost cut off all their hopes of getting any foreign assistance; for they might be under the height of their afflictions before any of their confederates could be informed of it. However, it was resolved to call in the [[Edom|Idumeans [Edomites]]]; so they wrote a short letter to this effect: That Ananus had imposed on the people, and was betraying their metropolis to the Romans; that they themselves had revolted from the rest, and were in custody in the temple, on account of the preservation of their liberty; that there was but a small time left wherein they might hope for their deliverance; and that unless they would come immediately to their assistance, they should themselves be soon in the power of Artanus, and the city would be in the power of the Romans.<ref name=\"JW Book IV\"/>|}}\n\nThe messengers managed to sneak out of the Temple and successfully deliver their message to the rulers of the Edomites, who were greatly alarmed, and quickly raised an army of 20,000 to march on Jerusalem, \"in order to maintain the liberty of their metropolis.\"<ref name=\"JW Book IV\"/> Upon receiving word that 20,000 Edomites were marching on Jerusalem, ben Hanan ordered the gates shut against them, and the walls guarded. Jesus, one of the elder high priests, made a speech from the walls, denouncing the Zealots as robbers and telling the Edomites to throw down their arms. Simon, son of Cathlas, one of Idumean commanders, quieted the tumult of his own men and answered: \"I can no longer wonder that the patrons of liberty are under custody in the temple, since there are those that shut the gates of our common city to their own nation, and at the same time are prepared to admit the Romans into it; nay, perhaps are disposed to crown the gates with garlands at their coming, while they speak to the Idumeans from their own towers, and enjoin them to throw down their arms which they have taken up for the preservation of its liberty.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\"<ref name=\"JW Book IV\"/>\n\nThat night a thunderstorm blew over Jerusalem, and the Zealots sneaked from the Temple to the gates, and cut the bars of the gates with saws, the sound masked by the sound of the wind and thunder. They opened the gates of Jerusalem to the Edomites, who fell upon the guards and made their way to the Temple. They slaughtered Ananus' forces there, killing him as well. After freeing the Zealots from the Temple, they massacred the common people.

The town was originally named Hamilton after John Hamilton, who owned a [[League (unit)|league]] and [[Spanish customary units|labor]] of land nearby. In August 1852 a post office was established in Hamilton and named Burnet Courthouse. In 1857 thirty-five residents of the town petitioned the state legislature to change the name of the town to Burnet since there was another town in Texas named [[Hamilton, Texas|Hamilton]]. The name was changed in 1858. Major growth occurred with the arrival of the [[Austin and Northwestern Railroad]] in April 1882, when Burnet became the railhead for the area to the west. After the railroad was extended to [[Llano, Texas|Llano]] in 1892, Burnet declined as a supply point and became a farming and livestock center.

McCulloch]] established a station at the site of present-day Burnet for the protection of frontier settlers from Indian raids. In March 1849, the station was chosen as a federal fort and named [[Fort Croghan]].<ref>\"History of the Fort\", {{cite web |url=http://www.fortcroghan.org/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514220952/http://www.fortcroghan.org/history.htm |archivedate=2008-05-14 }}.

The town was originally named Hamilton after John Hamilton, who owned a [[League (unit)|league]] and labor of land nearby. In August 1852 a post office was established in Hamilton and named Burnet Courthouse. In 1857 thirty-five residents of the town petitioned the state legislature to change the name of the town to Burnet since there was another town in Texas named [[Hamilton, Texas|Hamilton]]. The name was changed in 1858. Major growth occurred with the arrival of the [[Austin and Northwestern Railroad]] in April 1882, when Burnet became the railhead for the area to the west. After the railroad was extended to [[Llano, Texas|Llano]] in 1892, Burnet declined as a supply point and became a farming and livestock center. The City of Burnet was incorporated in 1933.<ref>\"The Handbook of Texas Online \u2013 BURNET, Texas\", https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hgb13.

In 1869, the [[Georgia Railroad Freight Depot]] was completed to replace the one [[Sherman's March to the Sea|destroyed by Sherman's troops]] in 1864. The [[Georgia Railroad]] [[Train station|depot]], which stands at the entrance of Underground Atlanta, remains the oldest building in downtown Atlanta. Although the depot was originally three stories tall, the second and third story were destroyed by fire in 1935.  Besides the [[train station]], the bustling district included hotels, banks, law offices, and [[bar (establishment)|saloon]]s.  An electric [[streetcar]] was installed in 1889 to points South, and by 1900 the depot was serving 100 trains per day with direct service between Atlanta and [[New York City]]; [[Cincinnati]], Ohio; [[Chattanooga]], Tennessee; [[Knoxville]],  Tennessee; [[Augusta, Georgia]]; [[Macon, Georgia]]; and [[Columbus, Georgia]].\n\nBy 1910, the intense railroad activity and development in the area led to the erection of several iron bridges to accommodate pedestrian and automotive traffic across the railroad tracks. Atlanta [[architect]] [[Haralson Bleckley]] proposed to cover over the tracks entirely with a [[ferroconcrete]] platform on viaducts in 1909; as part of the contemporary [[City Beautiful]] trend, the platform would be used for boulevards and public plazas. Although Bleckley's plan was never realized, Plaza Park (in the north block of the four-block Underground Atlanta district) was eventually built in 1948<ref name=NRHP/><ref>{{cite report |url=https://www.atlantadowntown.com/_files/docs/dachrs_finalreport.pdf#page=17 |title=Downtown Atlanta Contemporary Historic Resources Survey Report |author=Huebner, Karen |pages=11\u201312 |date=September 4, 2013 |publisher=Central Atlanta Progress |accessdate=31 October 2019}}</ref> and later demolished and rebuilt as [[Peachtree Fountains Plaza]].\n\nIn 1928, the \"twin bridges\" viaduct was completed, raising the street level of Pryor, Central, Wall, and Alabama by one and a half stories,<ref name=NRHP/> and a five-block area was completely covered up.

Two Georgia Tech graduates, Steven H. Fuller, Jr. and Jack R.

Underground Atlanta, Inc. was incorporated May 2, 1967 and began acquiring options to lease buildings under Central Ave, Pryor, Whitehall, Hunter, Alabama, and Wall Street viaducts. Fuller and Paterson purchased all the corporation's stock in October 1967 and construction began in November 1968.<ref name=Shavin/>\n\nA constitutional amendment was passed in Georgia naming the area a state historic site.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19730805&id=dsINAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AHMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5083,4629667] {{dead link|date=July 2018}}</ref> The renovation left the original facades mainly intact and was concentrated on the spaces along Alabama, Pryor, and Kenny's Alley.<ref name=NRHP/>\n\n[[Image:Underground ATL Postcard 2.jpg|left|thumb|Postcard showing Underground Atlanta in the 1970s, featuring [[Streetcars in New Orleans#Preserved streetcars|Streetcar 924, formerly of New Orleans]].]]\nThe Underground Atlanta corporation spent $10&nbsp;million on redeveloping the historic area into an entertainment district.<ref name=NYT-75/> On April 8, 1969, \"Underground Atlanta\" officially opened with new restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and music venues installed in the old individual storefronts. At the time, [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]] was the only county in the state of Georgia that permitted mixed alcoholic beverages to be served, provided that adults met a dress code in places that served them. As a result, Underground Atlanta quickly became the center of downtown Atlanta nightlife.<ref name=NYT-75/><ref name=Kent-Chesnutt/>\n\nPopular spots in Underground Atlanta included Dante's Down the Hatch, [[Scarlett O'Hara]], The Blarney Stone, The Rustler's Den, The Pumphouse, The Front Page, The Bank Note, and Muhlenbrink's Saloon, where Atlanta's [[Piano Red]], under the name Dr. Feelgood and the Interns, played from 1969 to 1979. Other attractions included a souvenir shop owned by governor [[Lester Maddox]] and a wax museum. With the old-style architecture lending considerable charm to the district, Underground Atlanta soon became Atlanta's best-known tourist attraction,<ref name=NYT-75/> rivaling [[Bourbon Street]] in [[New Orleans]]. By 1972, its most profitable year, Underground had 3.5 million visitors and $17 million in sales. In 1973, there were 65 businesses employing 1,000.<ref name=Kent-Chesnutt/> At its peak, there were more than 80 restaurants, clubs, boutiques, and shops in the Underground Atlanta district.<ref name=NYT-75>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/19/archives/underground-atlanta-complex-is-beset-by-problems-few-customers-home.html |title=Underground Atlanta Complex Is Beset by Problems |author=King, Wayne |date=February 19, 1975 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=1 November 2019 |url-access=limited}}</ref>\n\nThe heyday of Underground Atlanta lasted for only half a decade. The legal drinking age in Georgia was lowered from 21 to 19. When neighboring [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]] relaxed their restrictions on alcohol consumption in the early 1970s, new bars sprouted up in other parts of the city, generating competition. The [[dress code]] restrictions were dropped and [[fight]]s began to break out. Crime became uncontrollable and the area was considered dangerous. In addition, the construction of the [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|MARTA]] East Line beginning in 1975 tore out approximately {{frac|3}} of the Underground blocks<ref name=UPI-85/> and eliminated [[parking]]. \n\nIn 1975, ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that winter traffic to the complex was sparse and threatened the continued existence of the district; Underground Atlanta Inc. offered 26,000 shares of stock to the city of Atlanta, and proposed to fence off the district, converting the public streets into public parkland and offering a 25-cent admission charge.<ref name=NYT-75/> By 1976, sales were down to just 40% of 1973 results.<ref name=Kent-Chesnutt/>\n\n{{quotebox |text=Underground [Atlanta] was never planned ... anyone who was there with an idea was welcomed.

[[Vagrancy (people)|Vagrants]] occupied several of the [[historic]] buildings, some of which were consequentially destroyed by [[fire]]s.  In 1982, newly elected [[mayor of Atlanta|Mayor]] [[Andrew Young]] vowed to reopen Underground as part of his plan to resuscitate [[downtown Atlanta]], starting with authorizing a $400,000 study conducted by American Cities Corporation (a subsidiary of [[The Rouse Company]], who had redeveloped and operated other \"festival shopping\" projects around the United States such as [[Faneuil Hall]] in [[Boston]], [[Harborplace]] in [[Baltimore]], and [[Bayside Marketplace]] in [[Miami]]); the resulting study advocated a complete redevelopment of Underground and the five blocks surrounding it. Underground Festival Development, Inc. (UFD) was formed in January 1985 to supervise the proposed redevelopment, and Mayor Young signed an agreement with UFD in July of that year. UFD began negotiating with Rouse to manage the site once complete. However, the development was put on hold in December 1985 when the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia Supreme Court]] ruled the proposal, which included a [[municipal bond]] issue, first required approval by Fulton County citizens.<ref name=Kent-Chesnutt />\n\nMindful of the security issues (real and perceived) that contributed to the first closure of Underground in 1980, UFD began to plan entrances, exits, and lighting to emphasize safety and Rouse assembled a security force of 30.<ref name=Kent-Chesnutt/> During this time, some of the clubs that had been destroyed by the MARTA construction eventually won a claim for damages from federal [[mass transit]] authorities and used the money to help revitalize the area a second time.\n\nThe restructured $85&nbsp;million bond issue was approved by the Georgia Supreme Court by July 1986, and reconstruction of Underground commenced. The Rouse Company announced it was ready to sign up tenants in March 1987; in all, the renovation cost $142&nbsp;million.<ref name=Kent-Chesnutt/> The city of Atlanta contributed $123&nbsp;million of that, including the $85&nbsp;million bond revenue, with the remainder from sales taxes and federal sources.<ref name=OS-89>{{cite news |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1989-06-16-8906160178-story.html |title=Upbeat Atlanta opens up new era of its Underground |author=Kunerth, Jeff |date=June 16, 1989 |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref> On June 15, 1989, during heavy thunderstorms, Underground Atlanta re-opened as more of a modern [[shopping mall]] than an entertainment district;<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/06/15/Underground-Atlanta-opens-despite-downpour/2382613886400/ |title=Underground Atlanta opens despite downpour |author=Young, Gayle |date=June 15, 1989 |work=UPI Archives |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref> the revamped Underground had double the retail space of the old entertainment district, with {{convert|225000|ft2|m2|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wFwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA73 |title=Small starts in big malls |author=Padgett, Tania |date=September 1996 |magazine=Black Enterprise |pages=73\u201382 |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref><ref name=Kent-Chesnutt/> Its 140 tenants included the retail outlets [[Sam Goody]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]]'s [[Koala Blue]] boutique, as well as a reopened Dante's Down the Hatch in the Kenny's Alley section.<ref name=Kent-Chesnutt/> Kenny's Alley was the designated entertainment area at the modern (post-1928) street level,<ref name=CT-89/> with {{convert|100000|ft2|m2|abbr=on}} available for dining and clubs.<ref name=CooperCarry>{{cite web |url=https://www.coopercarry.com/projects/underground-atlanta/ |title=Projects: Underground Atlanta |publisher=Cooper Carry |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref> In total, the redevelopment project spanned an area of six city blocks,<ref name=Kent-Chesnutt>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/004728759102900407 |title=Underground Atlanta: Resurrected and Revisited |author1=Kent, William E. |author2=Chesnutt, J.

Also commemorated on the plaques are the Confederacy, the Battle of East Atlanta, and one of the local men who fought in that battle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantakids.net/atlantakids_tours/undergroundatlanta_walking_tours.htm|title=Atlanta for Kids: Underground Atlanta Walking Tour|website=www.atlantakids.net|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222143212/http://www.atlantakids.net/atlantakids_tours/undergroundatlanta_walking_tours.htm|archivedate=2014-02-22|access-date=2014-02-12}}</ref>]]\nThe buildings comprising Underground Atlanta were constructed during the city's post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Reconstruction Era]] boom, between 1866 and 1871, when the city's population doubled from 11,000 to 22,000 residents.  In 1869, the [[Georgia Railroad Freight Depot]] was completed to replace the one [[Sherman's March to the Sea|destroyed by Sherman's troops]] in 1864. The [[Georgia Railroad]] [[Train station|depot]], which stands at the entrance of Underground Atlanta, remains the oldest building in downtown Atlanta. Although the depot was originally three stories tall, the second and third story were destroyed by fire in 1935.  Besides the [[train station]], the bustling district included hotels, banks, law offices, and [[bar (establishment)|saloon]]s.  An electric [[streetcar]] was installed in 1889 to points South, and by 1900 the depot was serving 100 trains per day with direct service between Atlanta and [[New York City]]; [[Cincinnati]], Ohio; [[Chattanooga]], Tennessee; [[Knoxville]],  Tennessee; [[Augusta, Georgia]]; [[Macon, Georgia]]; and [[Columbus, Georgia]].\n\nBy 1910, the intense railroad activity and development in the area led to the erection of several iron bridges to accommodate pedestrian and automotive traffic across the railroad tracks. Atlanta [[architect]] [[Haralson Bleckley]] proposed to cover over the tracks entirely with a [[ferroconcrete]] platform on viaducts in 1909; as part of the contemporary [[City Beautiful]] trend, the platform would be used for boulevards and public plazas. Although Bleckley's plan was never realized, Plaza Park (in the north block of the four-block Underground Atlanta district) was eventually built in 1948<ref name=NRHP/><ref>{{cite report |url=https://www.atlantadowntown.com/_files/docs/dachrs_finalreport.pdf#page=17 |title=Downtown Atlanta Contemporary Historic Resources Survey Report |author=Huebner, Karen |pages=11\u201312 |date=September 4, 2013 |publisher=Central Atlanta Progress |accessdate=31 October 2019}}</ref> and later demolished and rebuilt as [[Peachtree Fountains Plaza]].\n\nIn 1928, the \"twin bridges\" viaduct was completed, raising the street level of Pryor, Central, Wall, and Alabama by one and a half stories,<ref name=NRHP/> and a five-block area was completely covered up. This submerged the original street levels of Pryor, Alabama, Ponder's Alley, and Kenny's Alley, with access to the original street levels provided from Old Loyd Street.<ref name=NRHP/> During the construction of the \"twin viaducts\", merchants moved their operations to the second floor of their buildings, and turned the original ground floors' storefronts into [[basement]]s for storage and service.<ref name=UPI-85/><ref name=CT-89>{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-09-10-8901110796-story.html |title=Atlanta's Underground not just another mall |author=Joynt, Steve |agency=Scripps Howard News Service |date=September 10, 1989 |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{quotebox|text=<poem>Down in Atlanta G.A.\nUnderneath the viaduct every day\nDrinking corn and hollerin' hoo-ray\nPianos playin' till the break of day</poem>\n|source=&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;[[Bessie Smith]], \"Preachin' the Blues\" (1927) |align=left |width=17.5em}}\nGiven that this occurred during [[Prohibition]], and the fact that these \"basements\" were relatively obscured from the city above, some of the basements became sites for [[speakeasy]]s and [[juke joint]]s, with music and illegal drinking a common occurrence. One of the first mentions of the area is in the opening lines of [[Bessie Smith]]'s 1927 song \"Preachin' The Blues\" which documents its importance as an entertainment district.\n\nFor the next forty years, as Atlanta continued to grow at street level, the {{convert|12|acre|m2|sing=on}} underground area was effectively abandoned and forgotten, though frequented by the homeless.<ref name=NYT-75/>\n\n===Entertainment district===\nIn the 1960s, the original storefronts were rediscovered and many architectural features from a century earlier had survived intact including decorative brickwork, granite archways, ornate marble, cast-iron pilasters, hand-carved wooden posts, and gas street lamps. Two Georgia Tech graduates, Steven H. Fuller, Jr. and Jack R.

Underground Atlanta, Inc. was incorporated May 2, 1967 and began acquiring options to lease buildings under Central Ave, Pryor, Whitehall, Hunter, Alabama, and Wall Street viaducts. Fuller and Paterson purchased all the corporation's stock in October 1967 and construction began in November 1968.<ref name=Shavin/>\n\nA constitutional amendment was passed in Georgia naming the area a state historic site.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19730805&id=dsINAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AHMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5083,4629667] {{dead link|date=July 2018}}</ref> The renovation left the original facades mainly intact and was concentrated on the spaces along Alabama, Pryor, and Kenny's Alley.<ref name=NRHP/>\n\n[[Image:Underground ATL Postcard 2.jpg|left|thumb|Postcard showing Underground Atlanta in the 1970s, featuring [[Streetcars in New Orleans#Preserved streetcars|Streetcar 924, formerly of New Orleans]].]]\nThe Underground Atlanta corporation spent $10&nbsp;million on redeveloping the historic area into an entertainment district.<ref name=NYT-75/> On April 8, 1969, \"Underground Atlanta\" officially opened with new restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and music venues installed in the old individual storefronts. At the time, [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]] was the only county in the state of Georgia that permitted mixed alcoholic beverages to be served, provided that adults met a dress code in places that served them. As a result, Underground Atlanta quickly became the center of downtown Atlanta nightlife.<ref name=NYT-75/><ref name=Kent-Chesnutt/>\n\nPopular spots in Underground Atlanta included Dante's Down the Hatch, [[Scarlett O'Hara]], The Blarney Stone, The Rustler's Den, The Pumphouse, The Front Page, The Bank Note, and Muhlenbrink's Saloon, where Atlanta's [[Piano Red]], under the name Dr. Feelgood and the Interns, played from 1969 to 1979. Other attractions included a souvenir shop owned by governor [[Lester Maddox]] and a wax museum. With the old-style architecture lending considerable charm to the district, Underground Atlanta soon became Atlanta's best-known tourist attraction,<ref name=NYT-75/> rivaling [[Bourbon Street]] in [[New Orleans]]. By 1972, its most profitable year, Underground had 3.5 million visitors and $17 million in sales. In 1973, there were 65 businesses employing 1,000.<ref name=Kent-Chesnutt/> At its peak, there were more than 80 restaurants, clubs, boutiques, and shops in the Underground Atlanta district.<ref name=NYT-75>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/19/archives/underground-atlanta-complex-is-beset-by-problems-few-customers-home.html |title=Underground Atlanta Complex Is Beset by Problems |author=King, Wayne |date=February 19, 1975 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=1 November 2019 |url-access=limited}}</ref>\n\nThe heyday of Underground Atlanta lasted for only half a decade. The legal drinking age in Georgia was lowered from 21 to 19. When neighboring [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]] relaxed their restrictions on alcohol consumption in the early 1970s, new bars sprouted up in other parts of the city, generating competition. The [[dress code]] restrictions were dropped and [[fight]]s began to break out. Crime became uncontrollable and the area was considered dangerous. In addition, the construction of the [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|MARTA]] East Line beginning in 1975 tore out approximately {{frac|3}} of the Underground blocks<ref name=UPI-85/> and eliminated [[parking]]. \n\nIn 1975, ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that winter traffic to the complex was sparse and threatened the continued existence of the district; Underground Atlanta Inc. offered 26,000 shares of stock to the city of Atlanta, and proposed to fence off the district, converting the public streets into public parkland and offering a 25-cent admission charge.<ref name=NYT-75/> By 1976, sales were down to just 40% of 1973 results.<ref name=Kent-Chesnutt/>\n\n{{quotebox |text=Underground [Atlanta] was never planned ... anyone who was there with an idea was welcomed.

[[Vagrancy (people)|Vagrants]] occupied several of the [[historic]] buildings, some of which were consequentially destroyed by [[fire]]s.  In 1982, newly elected [[mayor of Atlanta|Mayor]] [[Andrew Young]] vowed to reopen Underground as part of his plan to resuscitate [[downtown Atlanta]], starting with authorizing a $400,000 study conducted by American Cities Corporation (a subsidiary of [[The Rouse Company]], who had redeveloped and operated other \"festival shopping\" projects around the United States such as [[Faneuil Hall]] in [[Boston]], [[Harborplace]] in [[Baltimore]], and [[Bayside Marketplace]] in [[Miami]]); the resulting study advocated a complete redevelopment of Underground and the five blocks surrounding it. Underground Festival Development, Inc. (UFD) was formed in January 1985 to supervise the proposed redevelopment, and Mayor Young signed an agreement with UFD in July of that year. UFD began negotiating with Rouse to manage the site once complete. However, the development was put on hold in December 1985 when the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia Supreme Court]] ruled the proposal, which included a [[municipal bond]] issue, first required approval by Fulton County citizens.<ref name=Kent-Chesnutt />\n\nMindful of the security issues (real and perceived) that contributed to the first closure of Underground in 1980, UFD began to plan entrances, exits, and lighting to emphasize safety and Rouse assembled a security force of 30.<ref name=Kent-Chesnutt/> During this time, some of the clubs that had been destroyed by the MARTA construction eventually won a claim for damages from federal [[mass transit]] authorities and used the money to help revitalize the area a second time.\n\nThe restructured $85&nbsp;million bond issue was approved by the Georgia Supreme Court by July 1986, and reconstruction of Underground commenced. The Rouse Company announced it was ready to sign up tenants in March 1987; in all, the renovation cost $142&nbsp;million.<ref name=Kent-Chesnutt/> The city of Atlanta contributed $123&nbsp;million of that, including the $85&nbsp;million bond revenue, with the remainder from sales taxes and federal sources.<ref name=OS-89>{{cite news |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1989-06-16-8906160178-story.html |title=Upbeat Atlanta opens up new era of its Underground |author=Kunerth, Jeff |date=June 16, 1989 |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref> On June 15, 1989, during heavy thunderstorms, Underground Atlanta re-opened as more of a modern [[shopping mall]] than an entertainment district;<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/06/15/Underground-Atlanta-opens-despite-downpour/2382613886400/ |title=Underground Atlanta opens despite downpour |author=Young, Gayle |date=June 15, 1989 |work=UPI Archives |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref> the revamped Underground had double the retail space of the old entertainment district, with {{convert|225000|ft2|m2|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wFwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA73 |title=Small starts in big malls |author=Padgett, Tania |date=September 1996 |magazine=Black Enterprise |pages=73\u201382 |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref><ref name=Kent-Chesnutt/> Its 140 tenants included the retail outlets [[Sam Goody]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]]'s [[Koala Blue]] boutique, as well as a reopened Dante's Down the Hatch in the Kenny's Alley section.<ref name=Kent-Chesnutt/> Kenny's Alley was the designated entertainment area at the modern (post-1928) street level,<ref name=CT-89/> with {{convert|100000|ft2|m2|abbr=on}} available for dining and clubs.<ref name=CooperCarry>{{cite web |url=https://www.coopercarry.com/projects/underground-atlanta/ |title=Projects: Underground Atlanta |publisher=Cooper Carry |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref> In total, the redevelopment project spanned an area of six city blocks,<ref name=Kent-Chesnutt>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/004728759102900407 |title=Underground Atlanta: Resurrected and Revisited |author1=Kent, William E. |author2=Chesnutt, J.

It was released on April 4, 1995, through the [[Record label|label]] Phantom Hill. After playing [[Marcia Brady]] in the [[sitcom]] ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', she was offered a solo record deal in the mid-1970s. She rejected the offer to attend school. McCormick had previously recorded four albums as part of ''The Brady Bunch'' and a duet album with her co-star [[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]]. In 1994, she signed with her brother's record label, Phantom Hill, and recorded ''When You Get a Little Lonely'' in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]]. Barry Coffing was the [[executive producer]].He arranged and produced all the songs. McCormick wanted to fuse variety into the album's overall [[Country music|country]] sound.\n\nThe album received mainly negative reviews; some reviewers were critical of McCormick's choice to record country music. She promoted it through live performances and [[Compact disc|CD]] signings. Its title track and \"Tell Mama\" were released as singles. ''When You Get a Little Lonely'' was re-released in 2008 as a [[Circuit City]] exclusive. Since the album's release, McCormick has continued to perform country music and has taken part in the [[reality television]] show [[Gone Country (TV series)|''Gone Country'']]. In a 2008 interview, McCormick said she was disappointed by restrictions to the recording process and wished she had written at least one song for it. ''When You Get A Little Lonely'' is her only album as a solo artist.\n\n== Background and recording ==\n[[File:Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.png|thumb|left|McCormick in a 1971 ''The Brady Bunch'' promotional photo|alt=A 1971 photograph of Maureen McCormick as part of a 1971 ''The Brady Bunch'' promotional campaign.]]\n\n[[Maureen McCormick]] first rose to prominence while playing [[Marcia Brady]] in the [[sitcom]] ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''.

It was released on April 4, 1995, through the [[Record label|label]] Phantom Hill. After playing [[Marcia Brady]] in the [[sitcom]] ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', she was offered a solo record deal in the mid-1970s but rejected the offer to attend school. McCormick had previously recorded four albums as part of ''The Brady Bunch'' and a duet album with her co-star [[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]]. In 1994, she signed with her brother's record label, Phantom Hill, and recorded ''When You Get a Little Lonely'' in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]]. Barry Coffing was the [[executive producer]] and arranged and produced all the songs. McCormick wanted to fuse genres into the album's overall [[Country music|country]] sound.\n\nThe album received mainly negative reviews; some reviewers were critical of McCormick's choice to record country music. She promoted it through live performances and [[Compact disc|CD]] signings. Its title track and \"Tell Mama\" were released as singles. ''When You Get a Little Lonely'' was re-released in 2008 as a [[Circuit City]] exclusive. Since the album's release, McCormick has continued to perform country music and has participated in the [[reality television]] show [[Gone Country (TV series)|''Gone Country'']]. In a 2008 interview, McCormick said she was disappointed by restrictions to the recording process and wished she had written at least one song for it.

{"title_page": "Ethical egoism", "text_new": "{{short description|Ethical position that moral agents should act in their own self-interest}}\n{{For|other forms of egoism|Egoism}}\n{{Individualism sidebar}}\n'''Ethical egoism'''  is the [[normative ethics|normative ethical]] position that [[Moral agency|moral agent]]s ought to act in their own [[self-interest]]. It differs from [[psychological egoism]], which claims that [[people]] can only act in their self-interest. Ethical egoism also differs from [[rational egoism]], which holds that it is [[rationality|rational]] to act in one's self-interest.<ref>Sanders, Steven M. \"Is egoism morally defensible?\" ''Philosophia''. Springer Netherlands. Volume 18, Numbers 2\u20133 / July 1988</ref>\nEthical egoism holds, therefore, that actions whose consequences will benefit the doer can be considered ethical in this sense.\n\nEthical egoism contrasts with ethical [[altruism (ethics)|altruism]], which holds that moral agents have an [[moral obligation|obligation]] to help others. Egoism and altruism both contrast with ethical [[utilitarianism]], which holds that a moral agent should treat one's [[Philosophy of self|self]] (also known as [[subject (philosophy)|the subject]]) with no higher regard than one has for others (as egoism does, by elevating self-interests and \"the self\" to a status not granted to others). But it also holds that one is not obligated to sacrifice one's own interests (as altruism does) to help others' interests, so long as one's own interests (i.e. one's own [[desire (philosophy)|desires]] or [[Quality of life|well-being]]) are substantially equivalent to the others' interests and well-being, but he has the choice to do so. Egoism, utilitarianism, and altruism are all forms of [[consequentialism]], but egoism and altruism contrast with utilitarianism, in that egoism and altruism are both [[Consequentialism#Agent-focused or agent-neutral|agent-focused]] forms of consequentialism (i.e. subject-focused or [[Subjectivity|subjective]]). However, utilitarianism is held to be agent-neutral (i.e. [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[Impartiality|impartial]]): it does not treat the subject's (i.e. the self's, i.e. the moral \"agent's\") own interests as being more or less important than the interests, desires, or well-being of others.\n\nEthical egoism does not, however, require moral agents to harm the interests and well-being of others when making moral deliberation; e.g. what is in an agent's self-interest may be incidentally detrimental, beneficial, or neutral in its effect on others. [[Individualism]] allows for others' interest and well-being to be disregarded or not, as long as what is chosen is efficacious in satisfying the self-interest of the agent. Nor does ethical egoism necessarily entail that, in pursuing self-interest, one ought always to do what one wants to do; e.g. in the long term, the fulfillment of short-term desires may prove detrimental to [[self (philosophy)|the self]]. Fleeting pleasure, then, takes a back seat to protracted [[eudaimonia]]. In the words of [[James Rachels]], \"Ethical egoism ... endorses selfishness, but it doesn't endorse foolishness.\"<ref name=\"Rachels 2008, p. 534\">Rachels 2008, p. 534.</ref>\n\nEthical egoism is often used as the philosophical basis for support of [[right-libertarianism]] and [[individualist anarchism]].<ref name=ridgely>{{Cite web\n | last = Ridgely\n | first = D.A.\n | title = Selfishness, Egoism and Altruistic Libertarianism\n | date = August 24, 2008\n | url = http://www.positiveliberty.com/2008/08/selfishness-egoism-and-altruistic-libertarianism.html\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202145221/http://www.positiveliberty.com/2008/08/selfishness-egoism-and-altruistic-libertarianism.html\n | url-status = dead\n | archive-date = December 2, 2008\n | accessdate = 2008-08-24}}</ref> These are political positions based partly on a belief that individuals should not coercively prevent others from exercising freedom of action.\n\n==Forms==\nEthical egoism can be broadly divided into three categories: individual, personal, and universal. An ''individual ethical egoist'' would hold that all people should do whatever benefits \"my\" (''the individual's'')'' ''self-interest; a ''personal ethical egoist'' would hold that they should act in ''their'' self-interest, but would make no claims about what anyone else ought to do; a ''universal ethical egoist'' would argue that everyone should act in ways that are in their self-interest.<ref>Waller (2005), p. 81.</ref><ref>Waller (2005), p. 83.</ref>\n\n==History==\nEthical egoism was introduced by the philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] in his book ''[[The Methods of Ethics]]'', written in 1874. Sidgwick compared egoism to the philosophy of [[utilitarianism]], writing that whereas utilitarianism sought to maximize overall pleasure, egoism focused only on maximizing individual pleasure.<ref name=\"routledge\">{{Cite book| title = Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy | chapter = Egoism and Altruism | last = Floridi | first = Luciano | last2 = Craig | first2 = Edward |publisher = Taylor & Francis | isbn = 9780415187091|pages=246\u201347}}</ref>\n\nPhilosophers before Sidgwick have also retroactively been identified as ethical egoists. One ancient example is the philosophy of [[Yang Zhu]] (4th century BC), [[Yangism]], who views ''wei wo'', or \"everything for myself\", as the only virtue necessary for self-cultivation.<ref name=\"senghaas\">{{Cite book| title = The clash within civilizations: coming to terms with cultural conflicts | year =2002 | last =Senghaas | first =Dieter |publisher = [[Psychology Press]] | isbn =  978-0-415-26228-6|page=33}}</ref> Ancient Greek philosophers like Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics were exponents of [[virtue ethics]], and \"did not accept the formal principle that whatever the good is, we should seek only our own good, or prefer it to the good of others.\"<ref name=\"routledge\"/> However, the beliefs of the [[Cyrenaics]] have been referred to as a \"form of egoistic hedonism\",<ref>[http://www.iep.utm.edu/cyren/ Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Cyrenaics]</ref> and while some refer to Epicurus' hedonism as a form of [[virtue ethics]], others argue his ethics are more properly described as ethical egoism.<ref name=\"Evans\">{{Cite journal | last = Evans | first = Matthew | title = Can Epicureans be friends? | journal = Ancient Philosophy | volume = 24 | pages = 407\u201324 | date = 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Justifications==\nPhilosopher [[James Rachels]], in an essay that takes as its title the theory's name, outlines the three arguments most commonly touted in its favor:<ref>He notes, however, that \"the theory is asserted more often than it is argued for. Many of its supporters apparently think its truth is self-evident, so that arguments are not needed.\" (Rachels 2008, p. 534.)</ref>\n\n*\"The first argument,\" writes Rachels, \"has several variations, each suggesting the same general point:<ref>That is, that regarding and pursuing the interests of others is a self-defeating policy. Rachels quotes Alexander Pope in support of this: \"Thus God and nature formed the general frame/And bade self-love and social be the same.\"</ref>\n**\"Each of us is intimately familiar with our own individual wants and needs. Moreover, each of us is uniquely placed to pursue those wants and needs effectively. At the same time, we know the desires and needs of others only imperfectly, and we are not well situated to pursue them. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that if we set out to be 'our brother's keeper,' we would often bungle the job and end up doing more mischief than good.\"<ref name=\"Rachels 2008, p. 534\"/>\n**To give charity to someone is to degrade him, implying as it does that he is reliant on such munificence and quite unable to look out for himself. \"That,\" reckons Rachels, \"is why the recipients of 'charity' are so often resentful rather than appreciative.\"<ref>Rachels 2008, p. 534, where it is pointed out that, in the strictest egoistic terms, this is an inconsequential argument. Ethical egoism does not bother itself with how others receive charity, irrespective of how degraded it makes them feel. The same reasoning applies to the previous two bullets, which use self-interest as a means to the end of beneficence, rather than for its own purposes, as the theory would dictate.</ref>\n*Altruism, ultimately, denies an individual's value and is therefore destructive both to society and its individual components, viewing life merely as a thing to be sacrificed. Philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] is quoted as writing that, \"[i]f a man accepts the ethics of altruism, his first concern is not how to live his life but how to sacrifice it.\"<ref>Rachels 2008, p. 535, where this argument is attributed to [[Ayn Rand]], \"a writer little heeded by professional philosophers but who nevertheless was enormously popular on college campuses in the 1960s and 1970s\".</ref> Moreover, \"[t]he basic principle of altruism is that man has no right to exist for his own sake, that service to others is the only justification for his existence, and that self-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue or value.\" Rather, she writes, \"[t]he purpose of morality is to teach you, not to suffer and die, but to enjoy yourself and live.\"<ref>Rand, Ayn, \"Faith and Force: Destroyers of the Modern World,\" ''Philosophy: Who Needs It'', p. 74; ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', 1957, Random House, p. 1014; \"Faith and Force,\" p. 74.</ref>\n*All of our commonly accepted moral duties, from doing no harm unto others to speaking always the truth to keeping promises, are rooted in the one fundamental principle of self-interest.\n*It has been observed, however, that the very act of eating (especially, when there are others starving in the world) is such an act of self-interested discrimination. Ethical egoists such as Rand who readily acknowledge the (conditional) value of others to an individual, and who readily endorse empathy for others, have argued the exact reverse from Rachels, that it is altruism which discriminates: \"If the sensation of eating a cake is a value, then why is it an immoral indulgence in your stomach, but a moral goal for you to achieve in the stomach of others?\"<ref>Rand, Ayn, ''Atlas Shrugged'', 1957, Random House.</ref> It is therefore altruism which is an arbitrary position, according to Rand.\n\n==Criticism==\nIt has been argued that extreme ethical egoism is self-defeating. Faced with a situation of limited resources, egoists would consume as much of the resource as they could, making the overall situation worse for everybody. Egoists may respond that if the situation becomes worse for everybody, that would include the egoist, so it is not, in fact, in their rational self-interest to take things to such extremes.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-252577/ethics \"Ethics\"] ''Britannica''</ref> However, the (unregulated) [[tragedy of the commons]] and the (one off) [[prisoner's dilemma]] are cases in which, on the one hand, it is rational for an individual to seek to take as much as possible ''even though'' that makes things worse for everybody, and on the other hand, those cases are not self-refuting since that behaviour remains rational ''even though'' it is ultimately self-defeating, i.e. self-defeating does not imply self-refuting. Egoists might respond that a tragedy of the commons, however, assumes some degree of public land. That is, a commons forbidding homesteading requires regulation. Thus, an argument against the tragedy of the commons, in this belief system, is fundamentally an argument for private property rights and the system that recognizes both property rights and rational self-interest\u2014capitalism.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Block |first1=Walter |title=Environmentalism and Economic Freedom: The Case for Private Property Rights |journal=[[Journal of Business Ethics]] |volume=17 |issue=16 |pages=18871899 |date=1998 |issn=0167-4544 |jstor=25074025 }}</ref> More generally, egoists might say that an increasing respect for individual rights uniquely allows for increasing wealth creation and increasing usable resources despite a fixed amount of raw materials (e.g. the West pre-1776 versus post-1776, East versus West Germany, Hong Kong versus mainland China, North versus South Korea, etc.).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.juliansimon.org/writings/Ultimate_Resource/ |title= The Ultimate Resource II: People, Materials, and Environment (1996) | author=Julian Simon |accessdate=2014-03-14 }}</ref>\n\nIt is not clear how to apply a private ownership model to many examples of \"Commons\", however.

His moral principles would demand of others not to follow them, which can be considered self-defeating and leads to the question: \"How can ethical egoism be considered morally binding if its advocates do not want it to be universally applied?\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/glossary/ethical-egoism/|website=sevenpillarsinstitute.org|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref> \n\nAnother objection (e.g. by James Rachels) states that the distinction ethical egoism makes between \"yourself\" and \"the rest\" \u2013 demanding to view the interests of \"yourself\" as more important \u2013 is arbitrary, as no justification for it can be offered; considering that the merits and desires of \"the rest\" are comparable to those of \"yourself\" while lacking a justifiable distinction, Rachels concludes that \"the rest\" should be given the same moral consideration as \"yourself\".<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>James Rachels, ''The Elements of Moral Philosophy'', 4th ed. (Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2003) ''(reference found on'' https://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/glossary/ethical-egoism/)</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n==Notable proponents==\nThe term ''ethical egoism'' has been applied retroactively to philosophers such as [[Bernard de Mandeville]] and to many other [[Dialectical materialism|materialist]]s of his generation, although none of them declared themselves to be egoists. Note that materialism does not necessarily imply egoism, as indicated by [[Karl Marx]], and the many other [[materialist]]s who espoused forms of [[collectivism]]. It has been argued that ethical egoism can lend itself to [[individualist anarchism]] such as that of [[Benjamin Tucker]], or the combined [[anarcho-communism]] and egoism of [[Emma Goldman]], both of whom were proponents of many egoist ideas put forward by [[Max Stirner]]. In this context, egoism is another way of describing the sense that the common good should be enjoyed by all. However, most notable anarchists in history have been less radical, retaining altruism and a sense of the importance of the individual that is appreciable but does not go as far as egoism. Recent trends to greater appreciation of egoism within [[anarchism]] tend to come from less classical directions such as [[post-left anarchy]] or [[Situationism]] (e.g. [[Raoul Vaneigem]]). Egoism has also been referenced by [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]], such as [[Murray Rothbard]].\n\nPhilosopher [[Max Stirner]], in his book ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', was the first philosopher to call himself an egoist, though his writing makes clear that he desired not a new idea of morality (ethical egoism), but rather a rejection of morality ([[amoralism]]), as a nonexistent and limiting \"spook\"; for this, Stirner has been described as the first [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]]. Other philosophers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[David Gauthier]], have argued that the conflicts which arise when people each pursue their own ends can be resolved for the best of each individual only if they all voluntarily forgo some of their aims\u2014that is, one's self-interest is often best pursued by allowing others to pursue their self-interest as well so that liberty is equal among individuals. Sacrificing one's short-term self-interest to maximize one's long-term self-interest is one form of \"[[Rational selfishness|rational self-interest]]\" which is the idea behind most philosophers' advocacy of ethical egoism. Egoists have also argued that one's actual interests are not immediately obvious, and that the pursuit of self-interest involves more than merely the acquisition of some good, but the ''maximizing'' of one's chances of survival and/or happiness.\n\nPhilosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] suggested that egoistic or \"life-affirming\" behavior stimulates jealousy or \"[[ressentiment]]\" in others, and that this is the psychological motive for the altruism in [[Christianity]]. Sociologist [[Helmut Schoeck]] similarly considered [[envy]] the motive of collective efforts by society to reduce the disproportionate gains of successful individuals through moral or legal constraints, with altruism being primary among these.<ref>[[Helmut Schoeck|Schoeck, Helmut]], ''Der Neid.

It differs from [[psychological egoism]], which claims that [[people]] can only act in their self-interest. Ethical egoism also differs from [[rational egoism]], which holds that it is [[rationality|rational]] to act in one's self-interest.<ref>Sanders, Steven M. \"Is egoism morally defensible?\" ''Philosophia''. Springer Netherlands. Volume 18, Numbers 2\u20133 / July 1988</ref>\nEthical egoism holds, therefore, that actions whose consequences will benefit the doer can be considered ethical in this sense.\n\nEthical egoism contrasts with ethical [[altruism (ethics)|altruism]], which holds that moral agents have an [[moral obligation|obligation]] to help others. Egoism and altruism both contrast with ethical [[utilitarianism]], which holds that a moral agent should treat one's [[Philosophy of self|self]] (also known as [[subject (philosophy)|the subject]]) with no higher regard than one has for others (as egoism does, by elevating self-interests and \"the self\" to a status not granted to others). But it also holds that one is not obligated to sacrifice one's own interests (as altruism does) to help others' interests, so long as one's own interests (i.e. one's own [[desire (philosophy)|desires]] or [[Quality of life|well-being]]) are substantially equivalent to the others' interests and well-being, but he has the choice to do so. Egoism, utilitarianism, and altruism are all forms of [[consequentialism]], but egoism and altruism contrast with utilitarianism, in that egoism and altruism are both [[Consequentialism#Agent-focused or agent-neutral|agent-focused]] forms of consequentialism (i.e. subject-focused or [[Subjectivity|subjective]]). However, utilitarianism is held to be agent-neutral (i.e. [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[Impartiality|impartial]]): it does not treat the subject's (i.e. the self's, i.e. the moral \"agent's\") own interests as being more or less important than the interests, desires, or well-being of others.\n\nEthical egoism does not, however, require moral agents to harm the interests and well-being of others when making moral deliberation; e.g. what is in an agent's self-interest may be incidentally detrimental, beneficial, or neutral in its effect on others. [[Individualism]] allows for others' interest and well-being to be disregarded or not, as long as what is chosen is efficacious in satisfying the self-interest of the agent. Nor does ethical egoism necessarily entail that, in pursuing self-interest, one ought always to do what one wants to do; e.g. in the long term, the fulfillment of short-term desires may prove detrimental to [[self (philosophy)|the self]]. Fleeting pleasure, then, takes a back seat to protracted [[eudaimonia]]. In the words of [[James Rachels]], \"Ethical egoism ... endorses selfishness, but it doesn't endorse foolishness.\"<ref name=\"Rachels 2008, p. 534\">Rachels 2008, p. 534.</ref>\n\nEthical egoism is often used as the philosophical basis for support of [[right-libertarianism]] and [[individualist anarchism]].<ref name=ridgely>{{Cite web\n | last = Ridgely\n | first = D.A.\n | title = Selfishness, Egoism and Altruistic Libertarianism\n | date = August 24, 2008\n | url = http://www.positiveliberty.com/2008/08/selfishness-egoism-and-altruistic-libertarianism.html\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202145221/http://www.positiveliberty.com/2008/08/selfishness-egoism-and-altruistic-libertarianism.html\n | url-status = dead\n | archive-date = December 2, 2008\n | accessdate = 2008-08-24}}</ref> These are political positions based partly on a belief that individuals should not coercively prevent others from exercising freedom of action.\n\n==Forms==\nEthical egoism can be broadly divided into three categories: individual, personal, and universal. An ''individual ethical egoist'' would hold that all people should do whatever benefits \"my\" (''the individual's'')'' ''self-interest; a ''personal ethical egoist'' would hold that they should act in ''their'' self-interest, but would make no claims about what anyone else ought to do; a ''universal ethical egoist'' would argue that everyone should act in ways that are in their self-interest.<ref>Waller (2005), p. 81.</ref><ref>Waller (2005), p. 83.</ref>\n\n==History==\nEthical egoism was introduced by the philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] in his book ''[[The Methods of Ethics]]'', written in 1874. Sidgwick compared egoism to the philosophy of [[utilitarianism]], writing that whereas utilitarianism sought to maximize overall pleasure, egoism focused only on maximizing individual pleasure.<ref name=\"routledge\">{{Cite book| title = Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy | chapter = Egoism and Altruism | last = Floridi | first = Luciano | last2 = Craig | first2 = Edward |publisher = Taylor & Francis | isbn = 9780415187091|pages=246\u201347}}</ref>\n\nPhilosophers before Sidgwick have also retroactively been identified as ethical egoists. One ancient example is the philosophy of [[Yang Zhu]] (4th century BC), [[Yangism]], who views ''wei wo'', or \"everything for myself\", as the only virtue necessary for self-cultivation.<ref name=\"senghaas\">{{Cite book| title = The clash within civilizations: coming to terms with cultural conflicts | year =2002 | last =Senghaas | first =Dieter |publisher = [[Psychology Press]] | isbn =  978-0-415-26228-6|page=33}}</ref> Ancient Greek philosophers like Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics were exponents of [[virtue ethics]], and \"did not accept the formal principle that whatever the good is, we should seek only our own good, or prefer it to the good of others.\"<ref name=\"routledge\"/> However, the beliefs of the [[Cyrenaics]] have been referred to as a \"form of egoistic hedonism\",<ref>[http://www.iep.utm.edu/cyren/ Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Cyrenaics]</ref> and while some refer to Epicurus' hedonism as a form of [[virtue ethics]], others argue his ethics are more properly described as ethical egoism.<ref name=\"Evans\">{{Cite journal | last = Evans | first = Matthew | title = Can Epicureans be friends? | journal = Ancient Philosophy | volume = 24 | pages = 407\u201324 | date = 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Justifications==\nPhilosopher [[James Rachels]], in an essay that takes as its title the theory's name, outlines the three arguments most commonly touted in its favor:<ref>He notes, however, that \"the theory is asserted more often than it is argued for. Many of its supporters apparently think its truth is self-evident, so that arguments are not needed.\" (Rachels 2008, p. 534.)</ref>\n\n*\"The first argument,\" writes Rachels, \"has several variations, each suggesting the same general point:<ref>That is, that regarding and pursuing the interests of others is a self-defeating policy. Rachels quotes Alexander Pope in support of this: \"Thus God and nature formed the general frame/And bade self-love and social be the same.\"</ref>\n**\"Each of us is intimately familiar with our own individual wants and needs. Moreover, each of us is uniquely placed to pursue those wants and needs effectively. At the same time, we know the desires and needs of others only imperfectly, and we are not well situated to pursue them. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that if we set out to be 'our brother's keeper,' we would often bungle the job and end up doing more mischief than good.\"<ref name=\"Rachels 2008, p. 534\"/>\n**To give charity to someone is to degrade him, implying as it does that he is reliant on such munificence and quite unable to look out for himself. \"That,\" reckons Rachels, \"is why the recipients of 'charity' are so often resentful rather than appreciative.\"<ref>Rachels 2008, p. 534, where it is pointed out that, in the strictest egoistic terms, this is an inconsequential argument. Ethical egoism does not bother itself with how others receive charity, irrespective of how degraded it makes them feel. The same reasoning applies to the previous two bullets, which use self-interest as a means to the end of beneficence, rather than for its own purposes, as the theory would dictate.</ref>\n*Altruism, ultimately, denies an individual's value and is therefore destructive both to society and its individual components, viewing life merely as a thing to be sacrificed. Philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] is quoted as writing that, \"[i]f a man accepts the ethics of altruism, his first concern is not how to live his life but how to sacrifice it.\"<ref>Rachels 2008, p. 535, where this argument is attributed to [[Ayn Rand]], \"a writer little heeded by professional philosophers but who nevertheless was enormously popular on college campuses in the 1960s and 1970s\".</ref> Moreover, \"[t]he basic principle of altruism is that man has no right to exist for his own sake, that service to others is the only justification for his existence, and that self-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue or value.\" Rather, she writes, \"[t]he purpose of morality is to teach you, not to suffer and die, but to enjoy yourself and live.\"<ref>Rand, Ayn, \"Faith and Force: Destroyers of the Modern World,\" ''Philosophy: Who Needs It'', p. 74; ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', 1957, Random House, p. 1014; \"Faith and Force,\" p. 74.</ref>\n*All of our commonly accepted moral duties, from doing no harm unto others to speaking always the truth to keeping promises, are rooted in the one fundamental principle of self-interest.\n*It has been observed, however, that the very act of eating (especially, when there are others starving in the world) is such an act of self-interested discrimination. Ethical egoists such as Rand who readily acknowledge the (conditional) value of others to an individual, and who readily endorse empathy for others, have argued the exact reverse from Rachels, that it is altruism which discriminates: \"If the sensation of eating a cake is a value, then why is it an immoral indulgence in your stomach, but a moral goal for you to achieve in the stomach of others?\"<ref>Rand, Ayn, ''Atlas Shrugged'', 1957, Random House.</ref> It is therefore altruism which is an arbitrary position, according to Rand.\n\n==Criticism==\nIt has been argued that extreme ethical egoism is self-defeating. Faced with a situation of limited resources, egoists would consume as much of the resource as they could, making the overall situation worse for everybody. Egoists may respond that if the situation becomes worse for everybody, that would include the egoist, so it is not, in fact, in their rational self-interest to take things to such extremes.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-252577/ethics \"Ethics\"] ''Britannica''</ref> However, the (unregulated) [[tragedy of the commons]] and the (one off) [[prisoner's dilemma]] are cases in which, on the one hand, it is rational for an individual to seek to take as much as possible ''even though'' that makes things worse for everybody, and on the other hand, those cases are not self-refuting since that behaviour remains rational ''even though'' it is ultimately self-defeating, i.e. self-defeating does not imply self-refuting. Egoists might respond that a tragedy of the commons, however, assumes some degree of public land. That is, a commons forbidding homesteading requires regulation. Thus, an argument against the tragedy of the commons, in this belief system, is fundamentally an argument for private property rights and the system that recognizes both property rights and rational self-interest\u2014capitalism.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Block |first1=Walter |title=Environmentalism and Economic Freedom: The Case for Private Property Rights |journal=[[Journal of Business Ethics]] |volume=17 |issue=16 |pages=18871899 |date=1998 |issn=0167-4544 |jstor=25074025 }}</ref> More generally, egoists might say that an increasing respect for individual rights uniquely allows for increasing wealth creation and increasing usable resources despite a fixed amount of raw materials (e.g. the West pre-1776 versus post-1776, East versus West Germany, Hong Kong versus mainland China, North versus South Korea, etc.).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.juliansimon.org/writings/Ultimate_Resource/ |title= The Ultimate Resource II: People, Materials, and Environment (1996) | author=Julian Simon |accessdate=2014-03-14 }}</ref>\n\nIt is not clear how to apply a private ownership model to many examples of \"Commons\", however.

His moral principles would demand of others not to follow them, which can be considered self-defeating and leads to the question: \"How can ethical egoism be considered morally binding if its advocates do not want it to be universally applied?\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/glossary/ethical-egoism/|website=sevenpillarsinstitute.org|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref> \n\nAnother objection (e.g. by James Rachels) states that the distinction ethical egoism makes between \"yourself\" and \"the rest\" \u2013 demanding to view the interests of \"yourself\" as more important \u2013 is arbitrary, as no justification for it can be offered; considering that the merits and desires of \"the rest\" are comparable to those of \"yourself\" while lacking a justifiable distinction, Rachels concludes that \"the rest\" should be given the same moral consideration as \"yourself\".<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>James Rachels, ''The Elements of Moral Philosophy'', 4th ed. (Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2003) ''(reference found on'' https://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/glossary/ethical-egoism/)</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n==Notable proponents==\nThe term ''ethical egoism'' has been applied retroactively to philosophers such as [[Bernard de Mandeville]] and to many other [[Dialectical materialism|materialist]]s of his generation, although none of them declared themselves to be egoists. Note that materialism does not necessarily imply egoism, as indicated by [[Karl Marx]], and the many other [[materialist]]s who espoused forms of [[collectivism]]. It has been argued that ethical egoism can lend itself to [[individualist anarchism]] such as that of [[Benjamin Tucker]], or the combined [[anarcho-communism]] and egoism of [[Emma Goldman]], both of whom were proponents of many egoist ideas put forward by [[Max Stirner]]. In this context, egoism is another way of describing the sense that the common good should be enjoyed by all. However, most notable anarchists in history have been less radical, retaining altruism and a sense of the importance of the individual that is appreciable but does not go as far as egoism. Recent trends to greater appreciation of egoism within [[anarchism]] tend to come from less classical directions such as [[post-left anarchy]] or [[Situationism]] (e.g. [[Raoul Vaneigem]]). Egoism has also been referenced by [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]], such as [[Murray Rothbard]].\n\nPhilosopher [[Max Stirner]], in his book ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', was the first philosopher to call himself an egoist, though his writing makes clear that he desired not a new idea of morality (ethical egoism), but rather a rejection of morality ([[amoralism]]), as a nonexistent and limiting \"spook\"; for this, Stirner has been described as the first [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]]. Other philosophers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[David Gauthier]], have argued that the conflicts which arise when people each pursue their own ends can be resolved for the best of each individual only if they all voluntarily forgo some of their aims\u2014that is, one's self-interest is often best pursued by allowing others to pursue their self-interest as well so that liberty is equal among individuals. Sacrificing one's short-term self-interest to maximize one's long-term self-interest is one form of \"[[Rational selfishness|rational self-interest]]\" which is the idea behind most philosophers' advocacy of ethical egoism. Egoists have also argued that one's actual interests are not immediately obvious, and that the pursuit of self-interest involves more than merely the acquisition of some good, but the ''maximizing'' of one's chances of survival and/or happiness.\n\nPhilosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] suggested that egoistic or \"life-affirming\" behavior stimulates jealousy or \"[[ressentiment]]\" in others, and that this is the psychological motive for the altruism in [[Christianity]]. Sociologist [[Helmut Schoeck]] similarly considered [[envy]] the motive of collective efforts by society to reduce the disproportionate gains of successful individuals through moral or legal constraints, with altruism being primary among these.<ref>[[Helmut Schoeck|Schoeck, Helmut]], ''Der Neid. Eine Theorie der Gesellschaft'' (''Envy. A Theory of Social Behaviour''), 1966, 1st English ed. 1969.</ref>  In addition, Nietzsche (in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'') and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] (in ''[[After Virtue]]'') have pointed out that the [[ancient Greeks]] did not associate [[morality]] with altruism in the way that post-Christian [[Western culture|Western civilization]] has done.\n[[Aristotle]]'s view is that we have duties to ourselves as well as to other people (e.g. friends) and to the ''[[polis]]'' as a whole. The same is true for [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] and [[Immanuel Kant]], who claim that there are duties to ourselves as Aristotle did, although it has been argued that, for Aristotle, the duty to one's self is primary.<ref>Wheeler, Jack, \"Rand and Aristotle,\" in Den Uyl and Rasmussen, ''[[The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand]]'', 1986.</ref>\n\n[[Ayn Rand]] argued that there is a positive harmony of interests among free, rational humans, such that no moral agent can rationally coerce another person consistently with his own long-term self-interest.

After being involved in many local rock bands, playing drums and DJ'ing in hip hop groups, Barrow got his first job at the Coach House Studios as a tape operator soon after it opened in 1989.<ref name=\"guardprof\"/> In 1991, while he was assisting on [[Massive Attack]]'s breakthrough album ''[[Blue Lines]]'', the band allowed him spare studio time to get his own ideas on tape. A few years later, when the Portishead project had been assembled, the group came back to record \"[[Sour Times]]\" in that same studio. At the dawn of the '90s, Barrow was making a name for himself as a remixer, working with such artists as [[Primal Scream]], [[Paul Weller]], [[Gabrielle (singer)|Gabrielle]] and [[Depeche Mode]]. In addition, Barrow had produced a track for [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]] and written songs for [[Neneh Cherry]].\n\nIn 2001, he formed the Australian [[record label]], Invada Records (whose artist roster includes acts such as RuC.L and [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA]]-award-winning group [[Koolism]]), together with Katalyst's Ashley Anderson.<ref name=\"guardprof\"/>\n\nIn 2003, Barrow set up [[Invada]] UK, a more experimental music label with partner Fat Paul, signing bands such as Gonga, Team Brick, Atavist, [[Joe Volk]], malakai and [[Crippled Black Phoenix]].  As \"Fuzzface\", Barrow co-produced and co-wrote [[Stephanie McKay]]'s 2003 debut album, \"McKay\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Geoff+Barrow|title=Geoff Barrow|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=2009-08-23}}</ref> featuring songs co-penned by Tim Saul and [[Carl Hancock Rux]].

Rush Plus service occurred only during portions of peak service: 6:30\u20139:00 AM and 3:30\u20136:00 PM, Monday through Friday.\n\nThe Rush+ realignment was intended to free up space in the Rosslyn Portal (the tunnel between Rosslyn and Foggy Bottom), which operates at full capacity already. When Silver Line service began, those trains would be routed through the tunnel, and so some of what were Blue Line trains to {{wmata|Largo Town Center}} were now diverted across the [[14th Street Bridges|Fenwick Bridge]] to become Yellow Line trains running all the way to the Green Line to {{wmata|Greenbelt}}. Select Yellow Line trains running south diverted along the Blue Line to {{wmata|Franconia\u2013Springfield}} (as opposed to the normal Yellow line terminus at {{wmata|Huntington}}). Until the start of Silver Line service, excess Rosslyn Tunnel capacity was used by additional Orange Line trains that traveled along the Blue Line to Largo (as opposed to the normal Orange Line terminus at {{wmata|New Carrollton}}). Rush+ had the additional effect of giving some further number of passengers transfer-free journeys, though severely increasing headways for the portion of the Blue Line running between {{wmata|Pentagon}} and {{wmata|Rosslyn}}. In May 2017, Metro announced that Yellow Rush+ service would be eliminated effective June 25, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Metro announces June 25 effective date for new hours, fares, schedules|url=https://www.wmata.com/about/news/06-17_Metro_Fare_and_Service_Changes.cfm|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=June 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Passenger information systems ===\n[[File:Gallery Pl-Chinatown Upper Level January 28, 2010.jpg|thumb|right|PIDS signs at the {{wmata|Gallery Place}} station]][[File:WMATA King Street PIDS.jpg|thumb|right|Digital PIDS signs at the {{wmata|King Street}} station]]\nA [[Passenger information system|Passenger Information Display System]] (PIDS) was installed in all Metrorail stations in 2000.

Night and weekend service varies between 8 and 20 minutes, with trains generally scheduled only every 20 minutes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wmata.com/schedules/timetables/|title=Rail Schedules|publisher=WMATA|access-date=January 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther service truncations also occur in the system during rush hour service only.

Rush Plus service occurred only during portions of peak service: 6:30\u20139:00 AM and 3:30\u20136:00 PM, Monday through Friday.\n\nThe Rush+ realignment was intended to free up space in the Rosslyn Portal (the tunnel between Rosslyn and Foggy Bottom), which operates at full capacity already. When Silver Line service began, those trains would be routed through the tunnel, and so some of what were Blue Line trains to {{wmata|Largo Town Center}} were now diverted across the [[14th Street Bridges|Fenwick Bridge]] to become Yellow Line trains running all the way to the Green Line to {{wmata|Greenbelt}}. Select Yellow Line trains running south diverted along the Blue Line to {{wmata|Franconia\u2013Springfield}} (as opposed to the normal Yellow line terminus at {{wmata|Huntington}}). Until the start of Silver Line service, excess Rosslyn Tunnel capacity was used by additional Orange Line trains that traveled along the Blue Line to Largo (as opposed to the normal Orange Line terminus at {{wmata|New Carrollton}}). Rush+ had the additional effect of giving some further number of passengers transfer-free journeys, though severely increasing headways for the portion of the Blue Line running between {{wmata|Pentagon}} and {{wmata|Rosslyn}}. In May 2017, Metro announced that Yellow Rush+ service would be eliminated effective June 25, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Metro announces June 25 effective date for new hours, fares, schedules|url=https://www.wmata.com/about/news/06-17_Metro_Fare_and_Service_Changes.cfm|publisher=WMATA|accessdate=June 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Passenger information systems ===\n[[File:Gallery Pl-Chinatown Upper Level January 28, 2010.jpg|thumb|right|PIDS signs at the {{wmata|Gallery Place}} station]][[File:WMATA King Street PIDS.jpg|thumb|right|Digital PIDS signs at the {{wmata|King Street}} station]]\nA [[Passenger information system|Passenger Information Display System]] (PIDS) was installed in all Metrorail stations in 2000.
