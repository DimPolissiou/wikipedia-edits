In tribute to him, the number of elementary entities ([[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, [[ion]]s or other particles) in 1 [[mole (unit)|mole]] of a substance, {{val|6.02214076e23}}, is known as the [[Avogadro constant]], one of the seven [[SI]] base units and represented by ''N''<sub>A</sub>.\n\n==Biography==\nAmedeo Avogadro was born in [[Turin]] to a noble family of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (now part of [[Italy]]) in the year 1776. He graduated in [[ecclesiastical law]] at the late age of 20 and began to practice. Soon after, he dedicated himself to [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] (then called ''positive philosophy'')<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Aglio |first1=Linda S. |last2=Litvak |first2=Eva A. |last3=Desai |first3=Sukumar P. |title=History of anaesthesia |journal=European Journal of Anaesthesiology |date=January 2016 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=1\u20133 |doi=10.1097/EJA.0000000000000356}}</ref>, and in 1809 started teaching them at a ''liceo'' (high school) in [[Vercelli]], where his family lived and had some property.\n\nIn 1811, he published an article with the title ''Essai d'une mani\u00e8re de d\u00e9terminer les masses relatives des mol\u00e9cules \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires des corps, et les proportions selon lesquelles elles entrent dans ces combinaisons'' (\"Essay on a manner  of Determining the Relative Masses of the Elementary Molecules of Bodies and the Proportions by Which They Enter These Combinations\"), which contains Avogadro's hypothesis. Avogadro submitted this essay to [[Jean-Claude Delam\u00e9therie]]'s ''Journal de Physique, de Chimie et d'Histoire naturelle'' (\"Journal of Physics, Chemistry and Natural History\").\n\nIn 1820, he became a professor of physics at the University of Turin. Turin was now the capital of  the restored Savoyard [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] under [[Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia|Victor Emmanuel I]]. Avogadro was active in the [[Piedmont insurrection|revolutionary movement]] of March 1821. As a result, he lost his chair in 1823 (or, as the university officially declared, it was \"very glad to allow this interesting scientist to take a rest from heavy teaching duties, in order to be able to give better attention to his researches\").

In tribute to him, the number of elementary entities ([[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, [[ion]]s or other particles) in 1 [[mole (unit)|mole]] of a substance, {{val|6.02214076e23}}, is known as the [[Avogadro constant]], one of the seven [[SI]] base units and represented by ''N''<sub>A</sub>.\n\n==Biography==\nAmedeo Avogadro was born in [[Turin]] to a noble family of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (now part of [[Italy]]) in the year 1776. He graduated in [[ecclesiastical law]] at the late age of 20 and began to practice. Soon after, he dedicated himself to [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] (then called ''positive philosophy'')<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Aglio |first1=Linda S. |last2=Litvak |first2=Eva A. |last3=Desai |first3=Sukumar P. |title=History of anaesthesia |journal=European Journal of Anaesthesiology |date=January 2016 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=1\u20133 |doi=10.1097/EJA.0000000000000356}}</ref>, and in 1809 started teaching them at a ''liceo'' (high school) in [[Vercelli]], where his family lived and had some property.\n\nIn 1811, he published an article with the title ''Essai d'une mani\u00e8re de d\u00e9terminer les masses relatives des mol\u00e9cules \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires des corps, et les proportions selon lesquelles elles entrent dans ces combinaisons'' (\"Essay on a manner  of Determining the Relative Masses of the Elementary Molecules of Bodies and the Proportions by Which They Enter These Combinations\"), which contains Avogadro's hypothesis. Avogadro submitted this essay to [[Jean-Claude Delam\u00e9therie]]'s ''Journal de Physique, de Chimie et d'Histoire naturelle'' (\"Journal of Physics, Chemistry and Natural History\").\n\nIn 1820, he became a professor of physics at the University of Turin. Turin was now the capital of  the restored Savoyard [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] under [[Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia|Victor Emmanuel I]]. Avogadro was active in the [[Piedmont insurrection|revolutionary movement]] of March 1821. As a result, he lost his chair in 1823 (or, as the university officially declared, it was \"very glad to allow this interesting scientist to take a rest from heavy teaching duties, in order to be able to give better attention to his researches\"). Eventually, King [[Charles Albert of Savoy|Charles Albert]] granted a Constitution (''[[Statuto Albertino]]'') in 1848. Well before this, Avogadro had been recalled to the university in Turin in 1833, where he taught for another twenty years.\n\nLittle is known about Avogadro's private life, which appears to have been sober and religious.

[[Freedmen]] comprised a majority of the population and had been electing Republican candidates to office. Members of an Alabama chapter of the [[White League]], a [[paramilitary]] group supporting the Democratic Party's drive to regain conservative political power in the county and state, attacked black Republicans at the polls. \n\nThe members of the White League killed at least seven black voters and wounded 70, while driving away more than 1,000 unarmed blacks at the polls. In attacking the polling place in [[Spring Hill, Barbour County, Alabama|Spring Hill]], the League influenced the outcome of the elections. They turned all Republicans out of office and Democratic candidates took a majority of offices up for election.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[White League]] had formed in 1874 as an insurgent, white Democratic [[paramilitary]] group in [[Grant Parish]] and nearby parishes<ref>\"Parishes\" in the State of Louisiana are administrative regions basically analogous to \"Counties\" in most other States of the United States of America.</ref> on the [[Red River of the South]] in [[Louisiana]]. The League was founded by members of the white militia who had committed the [[Colfax Massacre]] in Louisiana in 1873, killing numerous blacks in order to turn out Republicans from parish offices as part of the disputed 1872 gubernatorial election. Historians such as George Rabe consider groups such as the White League and [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] as a \"military arm\" of the Democratic Party. Their members worked openly to disrupt Republican meetings, and attacked and intimidated voters to suppress black voting. They courted press attention rather than operating secretly, as had the [[Ku Klux Klan]].\n\nChapters spread to Alabama and other states in the Deep South. A similar paramilitary group was the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], which originated in Mississippi and became active in the Carolinas. Both paramilitary groups contributed to the Democrats' regaining control in the state legislatures in the late 1870s. The Red Shirts were still active in the 1890s and were implicated in the [[Wilmington Insurrection of 1898]] in North Carolina.<ref>[http://www.history.ncdcr.gov/1898-wrrc/report/Chapter3.pdf LeRae Umfleet, \"Chapter 3: Practical Politics\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924030434/http://www.history.ncdcr.gov/1898-wrrc/report/Chapter3.pdf |date=2015-09-24 }}, ''1898 Wilmington Race Riot Commission Report'', North Carolina Dept. of Cultural Resources</ref>\n\n==Events==\nOn election day, November 3, 1874, an Alabama chapter of the [[White League]] repeated actions taken earlier that year in [[Presidency_of_Ulysses_S._Grant#Vicksburg_riots|Vicksburg, Mississippi]].

But, Republican voters reflected the black majority in the county, as well as white supporters. They outnumbered Democratic voters by a margin greater than two to one.

In Barbour County, the Democrats auctioned off as \"slaves\" (for a maximum cost of $2 per month), or otherwise silenced all Republican witnesses to the events. They were intimidated from testifying to the coup if the case went to federal court.<ref name=\"Curtin 2000 p. 56\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nDue to the actual and threatened violence by the White League, black voters began to stay away from the polls in Barbour County. They no longer voted in sufficient number to retain a majority of Republican officeholders. White conservative Democrats continued to intimidate black voters was through the late 19th century, especially after a Populist-Republican alliance elected some fusion candidates in the Deep South, as well as local Republican officials in many states.  \n\nIn 1875, [[Mississippi]] Democrats also used widespread intimidation to control local elections, which became known as the [[Mississippi Plan]]. Such violence was adopted by chapters in other cities and counties. Democrats regained control of Alabama and other state legislatures. Reconstruction ended with the withdrawal of federal troops as part of a compromise to elect [[United_States_presidential_election,_1876|Rutherford B Hayes]].\n\nIn 1901 the Democratic-dominated state legislature in Alabama, like other southern states, followed Mississippi's lead to end such election-related violence by passing a new constitution that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks]] by such measures as [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], [[literacy tests]], [[grandfather clauses]] and [[white primaries]]. Poll taxes and literacy tests also disfranchised tens of thousands of poor whites in Alabama. Although the Democratic legislature had promised whites would not be affected by the new measures, politicians wanted to preclude poor whites allying with blacks in Populist-Republican coalitions.<ref name=\"Glenn Feldman 2004, pp. 135\u2013136\">Glenn Feldman, ''The Disenfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, pp.&nbsp;135\u2013136</ref> With disfranchisement achieved, the legislature passed laws imposing [[racial segregation]] and other elements of [[Jim Crow]], a system that lasted well into the 1960s. At that time, the gains of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] led to Congressional passage of legislation in the mid-1960s that prohibited segregation and began to enforce the constitutional rights for minorities to suffrage and equal protection under the law.\n\nIn 1979, to commemorate the election riot, the state erected a historical marker located at the intersection of U.S. Highway 82 and Barbour County Road 49 near Comer, Alabama. \n\nIt reads:\n:Near here is Old Spring Hill, the site of one of the polling places for the November 3, 1874 local, state and national elections. Elias M. Keils, [[scalawag]] and Judge of the City Court of [[Eufaula, Alabama|Eufaula]], was United States supervisor at the Spring Hill ballot box. William, his 16 year-old son, was with him. After the polls closed, a mob broke into the building, extinguished the lights, destroyed the poll box and began shooting. During the riot, Willie Keils was mortally wounded. The resulting Congressional investigation received national attention. This bloody episode marked the end of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] domination in Barbour County. - Erected by the [[Historic Chattahoochee Commission]], 1979.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite news|last=Wilentz |first=Sean |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/opinion/14wilentz.html?scp=2  |title=Who's Buried in the History Books? |work=The New York Times |date=May 13, 2010 |accessdate=May 24, 2011}}\n* [http://www.hcc-al-ga.org/tour_markers.cfm?GetPage=1&County=1 \"Historic Markers \u00bb Alabama\"], Historic Chattahoochee Commission\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Election Riot Of 1874}}\n[[Category:Riots and civil disorder in Alabama]]\n[[Category:Barbour County, Alabama]]\n[[Category:1874 riots]]\n[[Category:1874 elections in the United States]]\n[[Category:Political riots]]\n[[Category:Political history of Alabama]]\n[[Category:Political violence in the United States]]\n[[Category:1874 in Alabama]]\n[[Category:1874 Alabama elections]]\n[[Category:Riots and civil disorder during the Reconstruction Era]]\n[[Category:November 1874 events]]\n[[Category:White League]]\n[[Category:Rebellions in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox civilian attack\n|title=Election riot of 1874\n|subheader=Part of the [[Reconstruction Era]]\n|image = \n|caption=  \n|location= [[Eufaula, Alabama]]\n|target= Republican voters, and county officials\n|year= 1874\n|date= November 3\n|time=\n|timezone=\n|type= * [[Coup d'\u00e9tat]]\n* [[Electoral fraud]]\n* [[Mass murder]]\n|casualties= 7 Black Republicans and 1 son of a Republican judge dead, at least 70 injured.\n|perps= [[White League]]\n|dfens=\n|motive=\n}}\n\nThe '''Election Riot of 1874''', or '''Coup of 1874''', took place on election day, November 3, 1874, near [[Eufaula, Alabama]] in [[Barbour County, Alabama|Barbour County]].

At that time, the gains of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] led to Congressional passage of legislation in the mid-1960s that prohibited segregation and began to enforce the constitutional rights for minorities to suffrage and equal protection under the law.\n\nIn 1979, to commemorate the election riot, the state erected a historical marker located at the intersection of U.S. Highway 82 and Barbour County Road 49 near Comer, Alabama. \n\nIt reads:\n:Near here is Old Spring Hill, the site of one of the polling places for the November 3, 1874 local, state and national elections. Elias M. Keils, [[scalawag]] and Judge of the City Court of [[Eufaula, Alabama|Eufaula]], was United States supervisor at the Spring Hill ballot box. William, his 16 year-old son, was with him. After the polls closed, a mob broke into the building, extinguished the lights, destroyed the poll box and began shooting. During the riot, Willie Keils was mortally wounded. The resulting Congressional investigation received national attention. This bloody episode marked the end of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] domination in Barbour County. - Erected by the [[Historic Chattahoochee Commission]], 1979.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite news|last=Wilentz |first=Sean |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/opinion/14wilentz.html?scp=2  |title=Who's Buried in the History Books? |work=The New York Times |date=May 13, 2010 |accessdate=May 24, 2011}}\n* [http://www.hcc-al-ga.org/tour_markers.cfm?GetPage=1&County=1 \"Historic Markers \u00bb Alabama\"], Historic Chattahoochee Commission\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Election Riot Of 1874}}\n[[Category:Riots and civil disorder in Alabama]]\n[[Category:Barbour County, Alabama]]\n[[Category:1874 riots]]\n[[Category:1874 elections in the United States]]\n[[Category:Political riots]]\n[[Category:Political history of Alabama]]\n[[Category:Political violence in the United States]]\n[[Category:1874 in Alabama]]\n[[Category:1874 Alabama elections]]\n[[Category:Riots and civil disorder during the Reconstruction Era]]\n[[Category:November 1874 events]]\n[[Category:White League]]\n[[Category:Rebellions in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Mangokeylime", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_riot_of_1874"}
