In his use of dynamic composition, illusionistic perspective and dramatic foreshortening, Correggio prefigured the [[Baroque]] art of the 17th century and the [[Rococo]] art of the 18th century. He is considered a master of [[chiaroscuro]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Correggio - The Holy Night - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|230px|[[Nativity (Correggio)|''Nativity'']] (c.1529\u201330)]]\nAntonio Allegri was born in [[Correggio, Italy|Correggio]], a small town near [[Reggio Emilia]]. His date of birth is uncertain (around 1489). His father was a merchant.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Otherwise little is known about Correggio's early life or training. It is, however, often assumed that he had his first artistic education from his father's brother, the painter [[Lorenzo Allegri (painter)|Lorenzo Allegri]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ricci|first=Conrado|title=Antonio Allegri da Correggio: His Life, his Friends, and his Time|year=1896|page=[https://archive.org/details/antonioallegrida00riccuoft/page/43 43]|publisher=William Heinemann|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/antonioallegrida00riccuoft}}</ref>\n\nIn 1503\u20131505 he was apprenticed to [[Francesco Bianchi Ferrara]] in [[Modena]], where he probably became familiar with the classicism of artists like [[Lorenzo Costa]] and [[Francesco Francia]], evidence of which can be found in his first works. After a trip to [[Mantua]] in 1506, he returned to Correggio, where he stayed until 1510. To this period is assigned the ''Adoration of the Child with St. Elizabeth and John'', which shows clear influences from Costa and [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]. In 1514 he probably finished three [[Tondo (art)|tondos]] for the entrance of the [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|church of Sant'Andrea in Mantua]], and then returned to Correggio, where, as an independent and increasingly renowned artist, he signed a contract for the Madonna altarpiece in the local monastery of St. Francis (now in the [[Dresden Gem\u00e4ldegalerie]]).\n\nOne of his sons, [[Pomponio Allegri]], became an undistinguished painter. Both father and son occasionally referred to themselves using the Latinized form of the family name, Laeti.<ref> [[Henry Fuseli]], Aphorisms. A history of art in the schools of Italy, in ''The Life and Writings of Henry Fuseli, Esq. M.A.R.A.'', Vol. III, p. 91</ref>\n\n==Works in Parma==\n\nBy 1516, Correggio was in Parma, where he spent most of the remainder of his career. Here, he befriended [[Michelangelo Anselmi]], a prominent [[Mannerist]] painter. In 1519 he married Girolama Francesca di Braghetis, also of Correggio, who died in 1529.<ref name=\"eb\" />\nFrom this period are the ''Madonna and Child with the Young Saint John'', ''Christ Leaving His Mother'' and the lost ''Madonna of Albinea''.\n\nCorreggio's first major commission (February\u2013September 1519) was the ceiling decoration of a private chamber<!--NOT CLEAR IF A DINING ROOM OR ELSE!--> of the mother-superior (abbess Giovanna Piacenza) of the convent of St. Paul in Parma, now known as [[Camera di San Paolo]]. Here he painted an arbor pierced by oculi opening to glimpses of playful cherubs. Below the oculi are [[lunette]]s with images of statues in feigned monochromic marble. The fireplace is frescoed with an image of Diana. The iconography of the scheme is complex, combining images of classical marbles with whimsical colorful ''bambini''.  \n\nHe then painted the illusionistic ''[[Vision of St. John on Patmos]]'' (1520\u201321) for the dome of the church of [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Parma|San Giovanni Evangelista]]. \nThree years later he decorated the dome of the [[Cathedral of Parma]] with a startling ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Correggio)|Assumption of the Virgin]]'', crowded with layers of receding figures in [[Melozzo]]'s perspective (''[[sotto in su]]'', from down to up).<ref name=\"eb\">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Correggio|first= William Michael|last= Rossetti|authorlink=William Michael Rossetti}}</ref>\nThese two works represented a highly novel illusionistic ''sotto in su'' treatment of dome decoration that would exert a profound influence upon future fresco artists, from [[Carlo Cignani]] in his fresco ''Assumption of the Virgin'', in the cathedral church of [[Forl\u00ec]], to [[Gaudenzio Ferrari]] in his frescoes for the cupola of ''Santa Maria dei Miracoli'' in [[Saronno]], to [[Il Pordenone|Pordenone]] in his now-lost fresco from [[Treviso]], and to the baroque elaborations of [[Giovanni Lanfranco|Lanfranco]] and [[Baciccio]] in Roman churches. The massing of spectators in a vortex, creating both narrative and decoration, the illusionistic obliteration of the architectural roof-plane, and the thrusting perspective towards divine infinity, were devices without precedent, and which depended on the extrapolation of the mechanics of perspective. The recession and movement implied by the figures presage the dynamism that would characterize [[Baroque]] painting.\n\nOther masterpieces include ''[[The Lamentation]]'' and ''[[The Martyrdom of Four Saints]]'', both at the Galleria Nazionale of Parma. The ''Lamentation'' is haunted by a lambency rarely seen in Italian painting prior to this time.{{fact|date=April 2019}} The ''Martyrdom'' is also remarkable for resembling later Baroque compositions such as [[Bernini]]'s ''[[Truth (Bernini)|Truth]]'' and [[Ercole Ferrata]]'s ''Death of Saint Agnes'', showing a gleeful saint entering martyrdom.{{fact|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Mythological series based on Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''==\n[[File:Antonio Allegri, called Correggio - Jupiter and Io - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|230px|''[[Jupiter and Io]]'' (c. 1531) typifies the unabashed eroticism, radiance, and cool, pearly colors associated with Correggio's best work.]]\n\nAside from his religious output, Correggio conceived a now-famous set of paintings depicting the ''Loves of Jupiter'' as described in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''. The voluptuous series was commissioned by [[Federico II Gonzaga]] of Mantua, probably to decorate his private Ovid Room in the [[Palazzo Te]]. However, they were given to the visiting Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and thus left Italy within years of their completion.\n\n''[[Leda and the Swan (Correggio)|Leda and the Swan]]'' \u2013 acquired by [[Frederick the Great]] in 1753; now in Staatliche Museen of [[Berlin]] \u2013 is a tumult of incidents: in the centre Leda straddles a swan, and on the right, a shy but satisfied maiden. ''[[Dana\u00eb (Correggio)|Dana\u00eb]]'', now in Rome's [[Borghese Gallery]], depicts the maiden as she is impregnated by a curtain of gilded divine rain. Her lower torso semi-obscured by sheets, Danae appears more demure and gleeful than [[Titian]]'s 1545 version of the same topic, where the rain is more accurately numismatic. The picture once called ''Antiope and the Satyr'' is now correctly identified as ''[[Venus and Cupid with a Satyr]]''.\n\n''[[Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle]]'' depicts the young man aloft in literal amorous flight. Some have interpreted the conjunction of man and eagle as a metaphor for the evangelist John; however, given the erotic context of this and other paintings, this seems unlikely. This painting and its partner, the masterpiece of ''[[Jupiter and Io]]'', are in [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] of [[Vienna]]. ''[[Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle]]'', one of the four mythological paintings commissioned by Federico II Gonzaga, is a proto-[[Baroque]] work due to its depiction of movement, drama, and diagonal compositional arrangement.\n\n==Death==\nReturning to his home town in later years, Correggio died there suddenly on 5 March, 1534, aged 46. The following day he was buried in San Francesco in Correggio near his youthful masterpiece, the 'Madonna di San Francesco', housed today in Dresden. The precise location of his tomb is now unknown.\n\n==Evaluation==\n[[File:Correggio - Leda and the Swan - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Leda and the Swan'' (c. 1532)]]\n\nCorreggio was remembered by his contemporaries as a shadowy, melancholic and introverted character. An enigmatic and eclectic artist, he appears to have emerged from no major apprenticeship. In addition to the influence of Costa, there are echoes of [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s style in his work, and a response to [[Leonardo da Vinci]], as well. Correggio had little immediate influence in terms of apprenticed successors, but his works are now considered to have been revolutionary and influential on subsequent artists. A half-century after his death Correggio's work was well known to [[Vasari]], who felt that he had not had enough \"Roman\" exposure to make him a better painter. In the 18th and 19th centuries, his works were often noted in the diaries of foreign visitors to Italy, which led to a reevaluation of his art during the period of [[Romanticism]]. The flight of the Madonna in the vault of the cupola of the Cathedral of Parma inspired many scenographical decorations in lay and religious palaces during those centuries.\n\nCorreggio's illusionistic experiments, in which imaginary spaces replace the natural reality, seem to prefigure many elements of [[Mannerist]], [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] stylistic approaches. He appears to have fostered artistic grandchildren, for example, Giovannino di Pomponio Allegri (1521\u20131593).<ref>[http://www.museoilcorreggio.org/allegati/guida%20breve%20italiano%20museo%20fogli%20singoli_101104010007.pdf Guida al Museo il Correggio].</ref> Correggio had no direct disciples outside of Parma, where he was influential on the work of [[Giovanni Maria Francesco Rondani]], [[Parmigianino]], [[Bernardo Gatti]], [[Francesco Madonnina]], and [[Giorgio Gandini del Grano]].\n\n==Selected works==\n[[File:Correggio -

In his use of dynamic composition, illusionistic perspective and dramatic foreshortening, Correggio prefigured the [[Baroque]] art of the 17th century and the [[Rococo]] art of the 18th century. He is considered a master of [[chiaroscuro]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Correggio - The Holy Night - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|230px|[[Nativity (Correggio)|''Nativity'']] (c.1529\u201330)]]\nAntonio Allegri was born in [[Correggio, Italy|Correggio]], a small town near [[Reggio Emilia]]. His date of birth is uncertain (around 1489). His father was a merchant.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Otherwise little is known about Correggio's early life or training. It is, however, often assumed that he had his first artistic education from his father's brother, the painter [[Lorenzo Allegri (painter)|Lorenzo Allegri]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ricci|first=Conrado|title=Antonio Allegri da Correggio: His Life, his Friends, and his Time|year=1896|page=[https://archive.org/details/antonioallegrida00riccuoft/page/43 43]|publisher=William Heinemann|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/antonioallegrida00riccuoft}}</ref>\n\nIn 1503\u20131505 he was apprenticed to [[Francesco Bianchi Ferrara]] in [[Modena]], where he probably became familiar with the classicism of artists like [[Lorenzo Costa]] and [[Francesco Francia]], evidence of which can be found in his first works. After a trip to [[Mantua]] in 1506, he returned to Correggio, where he stayed until 1510. To this period is assigned the ''Adoration of the Child with St. Elizabeth and John'', which shows clear influences from Costa and [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]. In 1514 he probably finished three [[Tondo (art)|tondos]] for the entrance of the [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|church of Sant'Andrea in Mantua]], and then returned to Correggio, where, as an independent and increasingly renowned artist, he signed a contract for the Madonna altarpiece in the local monastery of St. Francis (now in the [[Dresden Gem\u00e4ldegalerie]]).\n\nOne of his sons, [[Pomponio Allegri]], became an undistinguished painter. Both father and son occasionally referred to themselves using the Latinized form of the family name, Laeti.<ref> [[Henry Fuseli]], Aphorisms. A history of art in the schools of Italy, in ''The Life and Writings of Henry Fuseli, Esq. M.A.R.A.'', Vol. III, p. 91</ref>\n\n==Works in Parma==\n\nBy 1516, Correggio was in Parma, where he spent most of the remainder of his career. Here, he befriended [[Michelangelo Anselmi]], a prominent [[Mannerist]] painter. In 1519 he married Girolama Francesca di Braghetis, also of Correggio, who died in 1529.<ref name=\"eb\" />\nFrom this period are the ''Madonna and Child with the Young Saint John'', ''Christ Leaving His Mother'' and the lost ''Madonna of Albinea''.\n\nCorreggio's first major commission (February\u2013September 1519) was the ceiling decoration of a private chamber<!--NOT CLEAR IF A DINING ROOM OR ELSE!--> of the mother-superior (abbess Giovanna Piacenza) of the convent of St. Paul in Parma, now known as [[Camera di San Paolo]]. Here he painted an arbor pierced by oculi opening to glimpses of playful cherubs. Below the oculi are [[lunette]]s with images of statues in feigned monochromic marble. The fireplace is frescoed with an image of Diana. The iconography of the scheme is complex, combining images of classical marbles with whimsical colorful ''bambini''.  \n\nHe then painted the illusionistic ''[[Vision of St. John on Patmos]]'' (1520\u201321) for the dome of the church of [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Parma|San Giovanni Evangelista]]. \nThree years later he decorated the dome of the [[Cathedral of Parma]] with a startling ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Correggio)|Assumption of the Virgin]]'', crowded with layers of receding figures in [[Melozzo]]'s perspective (''[[sotto in su]]'', from down to up).<ref name=\"eb\">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Correggio|first= William Michael|last= Rossetti|authorlink=William Michael Rossetti}}</ref>\nThese two works represented a highly novel illusionistic ''sotto in su'' treatment of dome decoration that would exert a profound influence upon future fresco artists, from [[Carlo Cignani]] in his fresco ''Assumption of the Virgin'', in the cathedral church of [[Forl\u00ec]], to [[Gaudenzio Ferrari]] in his frescoes for the cupola of ''Santa Maria dei Miracoli'' in [[Saronno]], to [[Il Pordenone|Pordenone]] in his now-lost fresco from [[Treviso]], and to the baroque elaborations of [[Giovanni Lanfranco|Lanfranco]] and [[Baciccio]] in Roman churches. The massing of spectators in a vortex, creating both narrative and decoration, the illusionistic obliteration of the architectural roof-plane, and the thrusting perspective towards divine infinity, were devices without precedent, and which depended on the extrapolation of the mechanics of perspective. The recession and movement implied by the figures presage the dynamism that would characterize [[Baroque]] painting.\n\nOther masterpieces include ''[[The Lamentation]]'' and ''[[The Martyrdom of Four Saints]]'', both at the Galleria Nazionale of Parma. The ''Lamentation'' is haunted by a lambency rarely seen in Italian painting prior to this time.{{fact|date=April 2019}} The ''Martyrdom'' is also remarkable for resembling later Baroque compositions such as [[Bernini]]'s ''[[Truth (Bernini)|Truth]]'' and [[Ercole Ferrata]]'s ''Death of Saint Agnes'', showing a gleeful saint entering martyrdom.{{fact|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Mythological series based on Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''==\n[[File:Antonio Allegri, called Correggio - Jupiter and Io - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|230px|''[[Jupiter and Io]]'' (c. 1531) typifies the unabashed eroticism, radiance, and cool, pearly colors associated with Correggio's best work.]]\n\nAside from his religious output, Correggio conceived a now-famous set of paintings depicting the ''Loves of Jupiter'' as described in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''. The voluptuous series was commissioned by [[Federico II Gonzaga]] of Mantua, probably to decorate his private Ovid Room in the [[Palazzo Te]]. However, they were given to the visiting Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and thus left Italy within years of their completion.\n\n''[[Leda and the Swan (Correggio)|Leda and the Swan]]'' \u2013 acquired by [[Frederick the Great]] in 1753; now in Staatliche Museen of [[Berlin]] \u2013 is a tumult of incidents: in the centre Leda straddles a swan, and on the right, a shy but satisfied maiden. ''[[Dana\u00eb (Correggio)|Dana\u00eb]]'', now in Rome's [[Borghese Gallery]], depicts the maiden as she is impregnated by a curtain of gilded divine rain. Her lower torso semi-obscured by sheets, Danae appears more demure and gleeful than [[Titian]]'s 1545 version of the same topic, where the rain is more accurately numismatic. The picture once called ''Antiope and the Satyr'' is now correctly identified as ''[[Venus and Cupid with a Satyr]]''.\n\n''[[Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle]]'' depicts the young man aloft in literal amorous flight. Some have interpreted the conjunction of man and eagle as a metaphor for the evangelist John; however, given the erotic context of this and other paintings, this seems unlikely. This painting and its partner, the masterpiece of ''[[Jupiter and Io]]'', are in [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] of [[Vienna]]. ''[[Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle]]'', one of the four mythological paintings commissioned by Federico II Gonzaga, is a proto-[[Baroque]] work due to its depiction of movement, drama, and diagonal compositional arrangement.\n\n==Death==\nReturning to his home town in later years, Correggio died there suddenly on 5 March, 1534. The following day he was buried in San Francesco in Correggio near his youthful masterpiece, the 'Madonna di San Francesco', housed today in Dresden. The precise location of his tomb is now unknown.\n\n==Evaluation==\n[[File:Correggio - Leda and the Swan - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Leda and the Swan'' (c. 1532)]]\n\nCorreggio was remembered by his contemporaries as a shadowy, melancholic and introverted character. An enigmatic and eclectic artist, he appears to have emerged from no major apprenticeship. In addition to the influence of Costa, there are echoes of [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s style in his work, and a response to [[Leonardo da Vinci]], as well. Correggio had little immediate influence in terms of apprenticed successors, but his works are now considered to have been revolutionary and influential on subsequent artists. A half-century after his death Correggio's work was well known to [[Vasari]], who felt that he had not had enough \"Roman\" exposure to make him a better painter. In the 18th and 19th centuries, his works were often noted in the diaries of foreign visitors to Italy, which led to a reevaluation of his art during the period of [[Romanticism]]. The flight of the Madonna in the vault of the cupola of the Cathedral of Parma inspired many scenographical decorations in lay and religious palaces during those centuries.\n\nCorreggio's illusionistic experiments, in which imaginary spaces replace the natural reality, seem to prefigure many elements of [[Mannerist]], [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] stylistic approaches. He appears to have fostered artistic grandchildren, for example, Giovannino di Pomponio Allegri (1521\u20131593).<ref>[http://www.museoilcorreggio.org/allegati/guida%20breve%20italiano%20museo%20fogli%20singoli_101104010007.pdf Guida al Museo il Correggio].</ref> Correggio had no direct disciples outside of Parma, where he was influential on the work of [[Giovanni Maria Francesco Rondani]], [[Parmigianino]], [[Bernardo Gatti]], [[Francesco Madonnina]], and [[Giorgio Gandini del Grano]].\n\n==Selected works==\n[[File:Correggio -

Since his father, Agnolo, was a tailor (Italian: ''[[:wiktionary:sarto|sarto]]''), he became known as \"del Sarto\" (meaning \"tailor's son\").<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Shearman|first=John|title=Andrea del Sarto|publisher=Oxford|year=1965|isbn=|location=}}</ref>  Since 1677<!--is this a ref. to Cinelli, Bellezze di Firenze?--> some have attributed the surname Vannucchi with little documentation. By 1494 Andrea was apprenticed to a [[goldsmith]], and then to a [[woodcarver]] and painter named Gian Barile, with whom he remained until 1498.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=969}} According to his late biographer [[Lives of the Painters|Vasari]], he then apprenticed to [[Piero di Cosimo]], and later with [[Raffaellino del Garbo]] (Carli).\n\nAndrea and an older friend [[Franciabigio]] decided to open a joint studio at a lodging together in the Piazza del Grano. The  first product of their partnership may have been the ''Baptism of Christ'' for the Florentine [[Compagnia dello Scalzo]], the beginning of a [[monochrome]] [[fresco]] series.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=969}} By the time the partnership was dissolved, Sarto's style bore the stamp of individuality. According to the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', it \"is marked throughout his career by an interest, exceptional among Florentines, in effects of colour and atmosphere and by sophisticated informality and natural expression of emotion.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrea-del-Sarto |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\n==Frescoes at SS Annunziata in Florence==\nFrom 1509 to 1514 the [[Servite Order]] employed Del Sarto, [[Franciabigio]] and [[Andrea Feltrini]] in a programme of [[fresco]]es at [[Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mega.it/eng/egui/monu/chssann.htm |title=mega.it |publisher=mega.it |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref>  Sarto completed seven frescoes in the forecourt or atrium (the chiostro dei voti) before the Servite church, five of which illustrated the ''Life and miracles of [[Filippo Benizzi]]'',<ref>[http://rubens.anu.edu.au/raid5/italy2004/florence/churches/ss_annunziata/front_cloister/dsc07633.JPG ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204092026/http://rubens.anu.edu.au/raid5/italy2004/florence/churches/ss_annunziata/front_cloister/dsc07633.JPG |date=February 4, 2006 }}</ref> a Servite saint who died in 1285 (canonized 1671). He executed them rapidly, depicting the saint healing a leper through the gift of his undertunic; predicting the bad end of some blasphemers; and restoring [[exorcism|a girl possessed with a devil]]. The two final frescoes of the series depicted the healing of a child at the death bed of Filippo Benizzi and the curing of sick adults and children through his relic garment held at the church. All five frescoes were completed before the close of 1510.<ref name=\":0\" /> The original contract also required him to paint five scenes of the life and miracles of St Sebastian, but he told the Servites that he no longer wished to continue with the second cycle, most likely due to the low remuneration. The Servites convinced him to do two more frescoes in the forecourt, though of a different subject matter: a ''Procession of the Magi'' (or ''Adoration'', containing a self-portrait) finished in 1511 and a ''Nativity of the Virgin''. These paintings met with respect, the correctness of the contours being particularly admired, and earned for Sarto the nickname of \"Andrea senza errori\" (Andrea the perfect). Towards 1512 he painted an ''Annunciation'' in the [[monastery]] of S. Gallo and a ''Marriage of Saint Catherine'' (Dresden).\n\nBy 1514 Andrea had finished his last two frescoes in the Chiostro dei Vorti (SS. Annunziata), including his masterpiece, the [[Nativity of the Virgin (del Sarto)|''Nativity of the Virgin'']], which fuses the influence of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]] and [[Fra Bartolomeo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/g/ghirland/domenico/6tornab/61tornab/2birth.html |title=Compare it to Ghirlandaio's Quattrocento treatment |publisher=Wga.hu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref> By November 1515 he had finished at the nearby Chiostro of the Confraternity of St John the Baptist, commonly known as the Scalzo the ''Allegory of Justice'' and the ''Baptist preaching in the desert'', followed in 1517 by ''John Baptizing the People''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Visit to France==\n[[Image:Sarto life.jpg|thumb|left|Del Sarto's most ambitious monument, in terms of the amount of time he devoted to it, is the [[grisaille]] series in the Chiostro dello Scalzo.]]\nBefore the end of 1516, a Piet\u00e0 of Del Sarto's composition, and afterwards a Madonna, were sent to the [[France|French]] Court. This led to an invitation from [[Francis I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]], in 1518, and he journeyed to Paris in June of that year, along with his pupil Andrea Squarzzella, leaving his wife, Lucrezia, in Florence.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}\n\nAccording to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Andrea's pupil and biographer,<ref name = \"vasari\"/> Lucrezia wrote to Andrea and demanded he return to Italy. The King assented, but only on the understanding that his absence from [[France]] was to be short.  He then entrusted Andrea with a sum of money to be expended in purchasing works of art for the French Court.  By Vasari's account, Andrea took the money and used it to buy himself a house in Florence, thus ruining his reputation and preventing him from ever returning to France.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}} The story inspired [[Robert Browning]]'s poem-monologue \"[[Andrea del Sarto (poem)|Andrea del Sarto Called the 'Faultless Painter']]\" (1855),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.stonehill.edu/geverett/rb/sarto.htm |title=Stonehill |publisher=Faculty.stonehill.edu |accessdate=2012-09-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120195210/http://faculty.stonehill.edu/geverett/rb/sarto.htm |archivedate=2012-11-20 }}</ref> but is now believed by some historians to be apocryphal.<ref>[http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/264.html#1 University of Toronto Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104195856/http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/264.html#1 |date=January 4, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Later works in Florence==\n[[File:Andrea del Sarto - Assumption of the Virgin (Poppi Altarpiece) - WGA0416.jpg|thumb|''Assumption of the Virgin'' (Poppi Altarpiece), 1530]]\n[[File:Andrea del Sarto, Head of Saint John the Baptist, c. 1523, NGA 73856.jpg|thumb|left|''Head of Saint John the Baptist'', c. 1523, [[National Gallery of Art]]]]\nIn 1520 he resumed work in Florence, and executed the ''Faith'' and ''Charity''  in the cloister of the Scalzo. These were succeeded by the ''Dance of the [[Salome|Daughter of Herodias]]'', the ''Beheading of the Baptist'',  the ''Presentation of his head to [[Herod Antipas|Herod]]'', an allegory of Hope, the ''Apparition of the Angel to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zacharias]]'' (1523) and the monochrome ''Visitation''.  This last was painted in the autumn of 1524, after Andrea had returned from Luco in [[Mugello region|Mugello]], whence an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] in Florence had driven him and his family. In 1525 he returned to paint in the Annunziata cloister the ''[[Madonna del Sacco (Andrea del Sarto)|Madonna del Sacco]]'', a [[lunette]] named after a sack against which Joseph is represented propped.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}} In this painting the generous virgin's gown and her gaze indicate his influence on the early style of pupil [[Jacopo Pontormo|Pontormo]].\n\nIn 1523 Andrea painted a copy of the portrait group of [[Pope Leo X]] by Raphael; this copy is now in the [[Museo di Capodimonte]] in [[Naples]], while the original remains at the Pitti Palace. The Raphael painting was owned by [[Ottaviano de' Medici]], and requested by [[Federico II Gonzaga]], Duke of [[Mantua]].  Unwilling to part with the original, Ottaviano retained Andrea to produce a copy, which he passed to the Duke as the original. The imitation was so faithful that even [[Giulio Romano]], who had himself manipulated the original to some extent, was completely fooled; and, on showing the copy years afterwards to Vasari, who knew the truth, he could be convinced that it was not genuine only when a private mark on the canvas was pointed out to him by Vasari.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}\n\nAndrea's final work at the Scalzo was the ''Nativity of the Baptist'' (1526).

All five frescoes were completed before the close of 1510.<ref name=\":0\" /> The original contract also required him to paint five scenes of the life and miracles of St Sebastian, but he told the Servites that he no longer wished to continue with the second cycle, most likely due to the low remuneration. The Servites convinced him to do two more frescoes in the forecourt, though of a different subject matter: a ''Procession of the Magi'' (or ''Adoration'', containing a self-portrait) finished in 1511 and a ''Nativity of the Virgin''. These paintings met with respect, the correctness of the contours being particularly admired, and earned for Sarto the nickname of \"Andrea senza errori\" (Andrea the perfect). Towards 1512 he painted an ''Annunciation'' in the [[monastery]] of S. Gallo and a ''Marriage of Saint Catherine'' (Dresden).\n\nBy 1514 Andrea had finished his last two frescoes in the Chiostro dei Vorti (SS.

By Vasari's account, Andrea took the money and used it to buy himself a house in Florence, thus ruining his reputation and preventing him from ever returning to France.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}} The story inspired [[Robert Browning]]'s poem-monologue \"[[Andrea del Sarto (poem)|Andrea del Sarto Called the 'Faultless Painter']]\" (1855),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.stonehill.edu/geverett/rb/sarto.htm |title=Stonehill |publisher=Faculty.stonehill.edu |accessdate=2012-09-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120195210/http://faculty.stonehill.edu/geverett/rb/sarto.htm |archivedate=2012-11-20 }}</ref> but is now believed by some historians to be apocryphal.<ref>[http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/264.html#1 University of Toronto Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104195856/http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/264.html#1 |date=January 4, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Later works in Florence==\n[[File:Andrea del Sarto - Assumption of the Virgin (Poppi Altarpiece) - WGA0416.jpg|thumb|''Assumption of the Virgin'' (Poppi Altarpiece), 1530]]\n[[File:Andrea del Sarto, Head of Saint John the Baptist, c. 1523, NGA 73856.jpg|thumb|left|''Head of Saint John the Baptist'', c. 1523, [[National Gallery of Art]]]]\nIn 1520 he resumed work in Florence, and executed the ''Faith'' and ''Charity''  in the cloister of the Scalzo. These were succeeded by the ''Dance of the [[Salome|Daughter of Herodias]]'', the ''Beheading of the Baptist'',  the ''Presentation of his head to [[Herod Antipas|Herod]]'', an allegory of Hope, the ''Apparition of the Angel to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zacharias]]'' (1523) and the monochrome ''Visitation''.  This last was painted in the autumn of 1524, after Andrea had returned from Luco in [[Mugello region|Mugello]], whence an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] in Florence had driven him and his family. In 1525 he returned to paint in the Annunziata cloister the ''[[Madonna del Sacco (Andrea del Sarto)|Madonna del Sacco]]'', a [[lunette]] named after a sack against which Joseph is represented propped.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}} In this painting the generous virgin's gown and her gaze indicate his influence on the early style of pupil [[Jacopo Pontormo|Pontormo]].\n\nIn 1523 Andrea painted a copy of the portrait group of [[Pope Leo X]] by Raphael; this copy is now in the [[Museo di Capodimonte]] in [[Naples]], while the original remains at the Pitti Palace. The Raphael painting was owned by [[Ottaviano de' Medici]], and requested by [[Federico II Gonzaga]], Duke of [[Mantua]].  Unwilling to part with the original, Ottaviano retained Andrea to produce a copy, which he passed to the Duke as the original. The imitation was so faithful that even [[Giulio Romano]], who had himself manipulated the original to some extent, was completely fooled; and, on showing the copy years afterwards to Vasari, who knew the truth, he could be convinced that it was not genuine only when a private mark on the canvas was pointed out to him by Vasari.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}\n\nAndrea's final work at the Scalzo was the ''Nativity of the Baptist'' (1526).

The lists are extremely incomplete for players from the [[City Rovers]] club who had no scoring whatsoever for their 24\u201317 win over [[Grafton Athletic]], and their 66\u201313 win over the same opponents. In total the City team was missing the scorers of 112 of its points. Likewise [[Devonport United]] was missing scorers for 7 points, [[Newton Rangers]] for 13, Maritime for 3, [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] for 15, and [[Grafton Athletic]] for 30 (from the two matches with City). In addition to this a number of teams featured brothers and often there was no distinction made as to which of the Grey brothers of Maritime it was. H Grey scored 4 tries, while C grey was credited with 3, along with 2 conversions, however \"Grey\" was credited with 8 tries, 1 conversion, 1 penalty, and a drop goal which could have been either of the aforementioned players in each instance. Also Ponsonby had a try and conversion credited to McGregor but they could have been scored by either E McGregor or [[Dougie McGregor]].\n\n[[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] replicated the feat of his younger brother [[George Davidson (athlete)|George]] of the previous season by leading the point scoring while playing for Maritime. George had qualified for the Antwerp Olympics where he ran 5th in the 200m final and did not play in the Auckland Rugby League competition at all in 1920. He was to return and join his brothers in the City Rovers team from the 1921 season onwards.\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Rank!!Player!!Team!!Tries\n|-\n|1||[[George Paki]]||City Rovers||9\n|-\n|1||J McGregor||Maritime||9\n|-\n|3||C Nicholson||Devonport United||8\n|-\n|3||[[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]]||Devonport United||8\n|-\n|5||A Eustace||Marist Old Boys||6\n|-\n|6||E McGregor||Ponsonby United||5\n|-\n|6||[[Wally Somers]]||Newton Rangers||5\n|-\n|6||[[Ernie Herring]]||Maritime||5\n|-\n|6||[[Bert Avery]]||Maritime||5\n|-\n|6||[[Bill Stormont]]||Marist||5\n|-\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Rank!!Player!!Team!!Tries!!Con!!Pen!!Mark!!Drop Goal!!Points\n|-\n|1||[[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]]||City Rovers||8||14||6||0||0||64\n|-\n|2||[[Craddock Dufty]]||Newton Rangers||1||17||10||0||0||57\n|-\n|3||A Cross||Ponsonby United||0||9||6||0||0||30\n|-\n|4||J McGregor||Maritime||9||1||0||0||0||29\n|-\n|5||[[George Paki]]||City Rovers||9||0||0||0||0||27\n|-\n|6||A Sutton||Maritime||4||4||1||1||1||26\n|-\n|7||C Nicholson||Devonport United||8||0||0||0||0||24\n|-\n|8||[[Bill Stormont]]||Marist Old Boys||5||2||1||0||0||21\n|-\n|8||Billy Ghent||Marist Old Boys||3||3||3||0||0||21\n|-\n|10||[[Maurice Wetherill]]||City Rovers||4||4||0||0||0||20\n|-\n|10||Stewart||Devonport United||0||6||4||0||0||20\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Thacker Shield==\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] defended the [[Thacker Shield]] from Federal (of [[Christchurch]]) at Victoria Park in front of 10,000 spectators.

The lists are extremely incomplete for players from the [[City Rovers]] club who had no scoring whatsoever for their 24\u201317 win over [[Grafton Athletic]], and their 66\u201313 win over the same opponents. In total the City team was missing the scorers of 112 of its points. Likewise [[Devonport United]] was missing scorers for 7 points, [[Newton Rangers]] for 13, Maritime for 3, [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] for 15, and [[Grafton Athletic]] for 30 (from the two matches with City). In addition to this a number of teams featured brothers and often there was no distinction made as to which of the Grey brothers of Maritime it was. H Grey scored 4 tries, while C grey was credited with 3, along with 2 conversions, however \"Grey\" was credited with 8 tries, 1 conversion, 1 penalty, and a drop goal which could have been either of the aforementioned players in each instance. Also Ponsonby had a try and conversion credited to McGregor but they could have been scored by either E McGregor or [[Dougie McGregor]].\n\n[[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] replicated the feat of his younger brother [[George Davidson (athlete)|George]] of the previous season by leading the point scoring while playing for Maritime. George had qualified for the Antwerp Olympics where he ran 5th in the 200m final and did not play in the Auckland Rugby League competition at all in 1920. He was to return and join his brothers in the City Rovers team from the 1921 season onwards.\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Rank!!Player!!Team!!Tries\n|-\n|1||[[George Paki]]||City Rovers||9\n|-\n|1||J McGregor||Maritime||9\n|-\n|3||C Nicholson||Devonport United||8\n|-\n|3||[[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]]||Devonport United||8\n|-\n|5||A Eustace||Marist Old Boys||6\n|-\n|6||E McGregor||Ponsonby United||5\n|-\n|6||[[Wally Somers]]||Newton Rangers||5\n|-\n|6||[[Ernie Herring]]||Maritime||5\n|-\n|6||[[Bert Avery]]||Maritime||5\n|-\n|6||[[Bill Stormont]]||Marist||5\n|-\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Rank!!Player!!Team!!Tries!!Con!!Pen!!Mark!!Drop Goal!!Points\n|-\n|1||[[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]]||City Rovers||8||14||6||0||0||64\n|-\n|2||[[Craddock Dufty]]||Newton Rangers||1||17||10||0||0||57\n|-\n|3||A Cross||Ponsonby United||0||9||6||0||0||30\n|-\n|4||J McGregor||Maritime||9||1||0||0||0||29\n|-\n|5||[[George Paki]]||City Rovers||9||0||0||0||0||27\n|-\n|6||A Sutton||Maritime||4||4||1||1||1||26\n|-\n|7||C Nicholson||Devonport United||8||0||0||0||0||24\n|-\n|8||[[Bill Stormont]]||Marist Old Boys||5||2||1||0||0||21\n|-\n|8||Billy Ghent||Marist Old Boys||3||3||3||0||0||21\n|-\n|10||[[Maurice Wetherill]]||City Rovers||4||4||0||0||0||20\n|-\n|10||Stewart||Devonport United||0||6||4||0||0||20\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Thacker Shield==\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] defended the [[Thacker Shield]] from Federal (of [[Christchurch]]) at Victoria Park in front of 10,000 spectators.

The statue was begun in 1803, with Napoleon requesting to be shown in a French General's uniform, Canova rejected this, insisting on an allusion to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the [[Roman mythology|Roman god]] of [[War]].<ref name=\"wga.hu3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/c/canova/2/1mars.html|title=Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker by CANOVA, Antonio|website=wga.hu}}</ref> It was completed in 1806.<ref name=\"wga.hu4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/c/canova/2/2mars.html|title=Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker by CANOVA, Antonio|website=wga.hu}}</ref> In 1811, the statue arrived in Paris, but not installed; neither was its bronze copy in the Foro Napoleonico in Milan.<ref name=\"wga.hu3\"/> In 1815, the original went to [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]], after his victory at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] against Napoleon.<ref name=\"wga.hu4\"/>\n\n{{quote|If one could make statues by caressing marble, I would say that this statue was formed by wearing out the marble that surrounded it with caresses and kiss|[[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]] on the ''[[Venus Victrix (Canova)|Venus Victrix]]''<ref name=\"DoA-5\"/>}}\n\n''[[Venus Victrix (Canova)|Venus Victrix]]'' was originally conceived as a robed and recumbent sculpture of [[Pauline Bonaparte|Pauline Borghese]] in the guise of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].

Canova designed, financed, and partly built the structure himself.<ref name=\"GoV\"/> The structure was to be a testament to Canova's piety.<ref name=\"Batschmann\"/> The building's design was inspired by combining the [[Parthenon]] and the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] together.<ref name=\"GoV\"/><ref name=\"CA\"/> On 11 July 1819, Canova laid the foundation stone dressed in red Papal uniform and decorated with all his medals.<ref name=\"Batschmann\"/> It first opened in 1830, and was finally completed in 1836.<ref name=\"Batschmann\"/> After the foundation-stone of this edifice had been laid, Canova returned to Rome; but every succeeding autumn he continued to visit Possagno to direct the workmen and encourage them with rewards.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nDuring the period that intervened between commencing operations at Possagno and his death, he executed or finished some of his most striking works.

He is known for portraits and nudes in a [[modern art|modern]] style characterized by elongation of faces, necks, and figures that were not received well during his lifetime but later found acceptance. Modigliani spent his youth in Italy, where he studied the art of antiquity and the Renaissance. In 1906 he moved to Paris, where he came into contact with such artists as [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]]. By 1912 Modigliani was exhibiting highly stylized sculptures with Cubists of the [[Section d'Or]] group at the [[Salon d'Automne]].\n \nModigliani's oeuvre includes paintings and drawings. From 1909 to 1914 he devoted himself mainly to sculpture. His main subject was portraits and full figures, both in the images and in the sculptures. Modigliani had little success while alive, but after his death achieved great popularity. He died of [[tuberculous meningitis|tubercular meningitis]], at the age of 34, in Paris.\n\n==Family and early life==\n[[File:Modigliani Birthplace Livorno.jpg|thumb|upright|Modigliani's birthplace in [[Livorno]]]]\n\nModigliani was born into a [[Sephardic Jewish]] family in [[Livorno]], Italy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/modiglianis-sephardic-jewish-background-didnt-know/|title=Heroes \u2013 Trailblazers of the Jewish People|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> A port city, Livorno had long served as a refuge for those persecuted for their religion, and was home to a large [[History of the Jews in Livorno|Jewish community]]. His maternal great-great-grandfather, Solomon Garsin, had immigrated to Livorno in the 18th century as a refugee.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 13| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}</ref>\n\nModigliani's mother, Eug\u00e9nie Garsin, born and raised in [[Marseille]], was descended from an intellectual, scholarly family of Sephardic ancestry that for generations had lived along the Mediterranean coastline. Fluent in many languages, her ancestors were authorities on sacred Jewish texts and had founded a school of [[Talmud]]ic studies. Family legend traced the family lineage to the 17th-century Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]]. The family business was a credit agency with branches in Livorno, Marseille, Tunis, and London, though their fortunes ebbed and flowed.<ref>Secrest, ''Modigilani,'' Alfred Knopf, 2011, pp. 16\u201318</ref><ref name=\"Beyond the Myth\">[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=030010264X Klein, Mason, et al., ''Modigliani: Beyond the Myth'', page 197. The Jewish Museum and Yale University Press, 2004]</ref>\n\nModigliani's father, Flaminio, was a member of an Italian Jewish family of successful businessmen and entrepreneurs. While not as culturally sophisticated as the Garsins, they knew how to invest in and develop thriving business endeavors. When the Garsin and Modigliani families announced the engagement of their children, Flaminio was a wealthy young mining [[engineer]]. He managed the mine in Sardinia and also managed the almost {{convert|30000|acres|0|abbr=on}} of timberland the family owned.<ref>Secrest (2011), ''Modigilani,''pp. 24\u201325</ref>\n\nA reversal in fortune occurred to this prosperous family in 1883. An economic downturn in the price of metal plunged the Modiglianis into bankruptcy. Ever resourceful, Modigliani's mother used her social contacts to establish a school and, along with her two sisters, made the school into a successful enterprise.<ref>Secrest (2011), ''Modigilani,'' pp. 34\u201335</ref>\n\nAmedeo Modigliani was the fourth child, whose birth coincided with the disastrous financial collapse of his father's business interests. Amedeo's birth saved the family from ruin; according to an ancient law, creditors could not seize the bed of a pregnant woman or a mother with a newborn child. The bailiffs entered the family's home just as Eugenia went into labour; the family protected their most valuable assets by piling them on top of her.\n\nModigliani had a close relationship with his mother, who taught him at home until he was 10. Beset with health problems after an attack of [[pleurisy]] when he was about 11, a few years later he developed a case of [[typhoid fever]]. When he was 16 he was taken ill again and contracted the [[tuberculosis]] which would later claim his life. After Modigliani recovered from the second bout of pleurisy, his mother took him on a tour of southern Italy: [[Naples]], [[Capri]], [[Rome]] and [[Amalfi]], then north to [[Florence]] and [[Venice]].<ref>{{Cite book| last = Fifield | first = William | date = 19 June 1978 | title = Modigliani: A Biography | publisher = W.H.

When he was 11 years of age, she had noted in her diary: \"The child's character is still so unformed that I cannot say what I think of it. He behaves like a spoiled child, but he does not lack intelligence. We shall have to wait and see what is inside this chrysalis. Perhaps an artist?\"<ref>{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson | page = 14| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}</ref>\n\n==Art student years==\nModigliani is known to have drawn and painted from a very early age, and thought himself \"already a painter\", his mother wrote,<ref name=\"Mann 1980 12\">{{Cite book| last = Mann | first = Carol | year = 1980 | title = Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | isbn = 0-500-20176-5 | page = 12}}</ref> even before beginning formal studies. Despite her misgivings that launching him on a course of studying art would impinge upon his other studies, his mother indulged the young Modigliani's passion for the subject.\n\nAt the age of fourteen, while sick with typhoid fever, he raved in his delirium that he wanted, above all else, to see the paintings in the [[Palazzo Pitti]] and the [[Uffizi]] in Florence. As Livorno's local museum housed only a sparse few paintings by the [[Italian Renaissance]] masters, the tales he had heard about the great works held in Florence intrigued him, and it was a source of considerable despair to him, in his sickened state, that he might never get the chance to view them in person. His mother promised that she would take him to Florence herself, the moment he was recovered. Not only did she fulfil this promise, but she also undertook to enroll him with the best painting master in Livorno, [[Guglielmo Micheli]].\n\n===Micheli and the Macchiaioli===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}<!--only 2 citations-->\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani, c.1915, Portrait de Picasso, oil on cardboard, 43.2 x 26.7 cm.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of Pablo Picasso,'' 1915, private collection]]\n[[File:Modigliani in Venice - Calle dell'Avogaria (a S.Sebastiano), 1633.jpg|thumb|His home in Venice.]]\nModigliani worked in Micheli's Art School from 1898 to 1900. Among his colleagues in that studio would have been [[Llewelyn Lloyd (painter)|Llewelyn Lloyd]], [[Giulio Cesare Vinzio]], [[Manlio Martinelli]], [[Gino Romiti]], [[Renato Natali]], and [[Oscar Ghiglia]]. Here his earliest formal artistic instruction took place in an atmosphere steeped in a study of the styles and themes of 19th-century Italian art. In his earliest Parisian work, traces of this influence, and that of his studies of [[Renaissance art]], can still be seen. His nascent work was influenced by such Parisian artists as [[Giovanni Boldini]] and [[Toulouse-Lautrec]].\n\nModigliani showed great promise while with Micheli, and ceased his studies only when he was forced to, by the onset of tuberculosis.\n\nIn 1901, whilst in Rome, Modigliani admired the work of [[Domenico Morelli]], a painter of dramatic religious and literary scenes. Morelli had served as an inspiration for a group of iconoclasts who were known by the title \"the [[Macchiaioli]]\" (from ''macchia''&nbsp;\u2014\"dash of colour\", or, more derogatively, \"stain\"), and Modigliani had already been exposed to the influences of the Macchiaioli. This localized [[Landscape art|landscape]] movement reacted against the bourgeois stylings of the academic genre painters. While sympathetically connected to (and actually pre-dating) the [[French Impressionism|French Impressionists]], the Macchiaioli did not make the same impact upon international art culture as did the contemporaries and followers of [[Monet]], and are today largely forgotten outside Italy.\n\nModigliani's connection with the movement was through Guglielmo Micheli, his first art teacher. Micheli was not only a Macchiaiolo himself, but had been a pupil of the famous [[Giovanni Fattori]], a founder of the movement. Micheli's work, however, was so fashionable and the genre so commonplace that the young Modigliani reacted against it, preferring to ignore the obsession with landscape that, as with French Impressionism, characterized the movement. Micheli also tried to encourage his pupils to paint ''[[en plein air]]'', but Modigliani never really got a taste for this style of working, sketching in caf\u00e9s, but preferring to paint indoors, and especially in his own studio. Even when compelled to paint landscapes (three are known to exist),<ref>{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 16| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}</ref> Modigliani chose a proto-[[Cubism|Cubist]] palette more akin to [[C\u00e9zanne]] than to the Macchiaioli.\n\nWhile with Micheli, Modigliani studied not only landscape, but also portraiture, still life, and the nude. His fellow students recall that the last was where he displayed his greatest talent, and apparently this was not an entirely academic pursuit for the teenager: when not painting nudes, he was occupied with seducing the household maid.<ref name=\"Mann 1980 12\" />\n\nDespite his rejection of the Macchiaioli approach, Modigliani nonetheless found favour with his teacher, who referred to him as \"Superman\", a pet name reflecting the fact that Modigliani was not only quite adept at his art, but also that he regularly quoted from Nietzsche's ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''. Fattori himself would often visit the studio, and approved of the young artist's innovations.<ref name=\"Mann-1980-16\">{{Cite book| last = Mann | first = Carol | year = 1980 | title = Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | isbn = 0-500-20176-5 | page = 16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1902, Modigliani continued what was to be a lifelong infatuation with [[life drawing]], enrolling in the Scuola Libera di Nudo, or \"Free School of Nude Studies\", of the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze|Accademia di Belle Arti]] in Florence. A year later, while still suffering from tuberculosis, he moved to Venice, where he registered to study at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia|Regia Accademia ed Istituto di Belle Arti]].\nIt is in Venice that he first smoked [[hashish]] and, rather than studying, began to spend time frequenting disreputable parts of the city. The impact of these lifestyle choices upon his developing artistic style is open to conjecture, although these choices do seem to be more than simple [[teenage rebellion]], or the cliched [[hedonism]] and [[bohemianism]] that was almost expected of artists of the time; his pursuit of the seedier side of life appears to have roots in his appreciation of radical philosophies, including those of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]].\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani - Chaim Soutine (1917).jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of [[Chaim Soutine]],'' 1916]]\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani - Caryatid.jpg|thumb|upright|''Caryatid'', now at [[The New Art Gallery Walsall]] ]]\n\n===Early literary influences===\nHaving been exposed to erudite philosophical literature as a young boy under the tutelage of Isaco Garsin, his maternal grandfather, he continued to read and be influenced through his art studies by the writings of Nietzsche, [[Baudelaire]], [[Giosu\u00e8 Carducci|Carducci]], [[Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont]], and others, and developed the belief that the only route to true creativity was through defiance and disorder.\n\nLetters that he wrote from his 'sabbatical' in Capri in 1901 clearly indicate that he is being more and more influenced by the thinking of Nietzsche. In these letters, he advised friend Oscar Ghiglia;\n\n<blockquote>(hold sacred all) which can exalt and excite your intelligence... (and) ... seek to provoke ... and to perpetuate ... these fertile stimuli, because they can push the intelligence to its maximum creative power.<ref name=\"Werner 1967 17\">{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 17| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe work of [[Lautr\u00e9amont]] was equally influential at this time. This doomed poet's ''[[Les Chants de Maldoror]]'' became the seminal work for the Parisian [[Surrealists]] of Modigliani's generation, and the book became Modigliani's favourite to the extent that he learnt it by heart.<ref name=\"Mann-1980-16\" /> The poetry of Lautr\u00e9amont is characterized by the juxtaposition of fantastical elements, and by sadistic imagery; the fact that Modigliani was so taken by this text in his early teens gives a good indication of his developing tastes. Baudelaire and [[D'Annunzio]] similarly appealed to the young artist, with their interest in corrupted beauty, and the expression of that insight through [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] imagery.\n\nModigliani wrote to Ghiglia extensively from Capri, where his mother had taken him to assist in his recovery from tuberculosis. These letters are a sounding board for the developing ideas brewing in Modigliani's mind. Ghiglia was seven years Modigliani's senior, and it is likely that it was he who showed the young man the limits of his horizons in Livorno. Like all precocious teenagers, Modigliani preferred the company of older companions, and Ghiglia's role in his adolescence was to be a sympathetic ear as he worked himself out, principally in the convoluted letters that he regularly sent, and which survive today.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Mann | first = Carol | year = 1980 | title = Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | isbn = 0-500-20176-5 | pages = 19\u201322}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Dear friend, I write to pour myself out to you and to affirm myself to myself.

In fact, his arrival at the centre of artistic experimentation coincided with the arrival of two other foreigners who were also to leave their marks upon the art world: [[Gino Severini]] and [[Juan Gris]].\n\nHe later befriended [[Jacob Epstein]], they aimed to set up a studio together with a shared vision to create a Temple of Beauty to be enjoyed by all, for which Modigliani created drawings and paintings of the intended stone caryatids for \u2018The Pillars of Tenderness\u2019 which would support the imagined temple.<ref>{{cite web|title=Modigliani Caryatid Drawings|url=http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|work=The New Art Gallery Walsall Catalogue|publisher=[[The New Art Gallery Walsall]]|accessdate=2013-05-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130707074343/http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|archivedate=2013-07-07}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Le Bateau-Lavoir, circa 1910.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Le Bateau-Lavoir]] in 1910]]\nModigliani [[Squatting|squat]]ted in the [[Bateau-Lavoir]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Modigliani Caryatid Drawings|url=http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|publisher=[[The New Art Gallery Walsall]]|accessdate=2013-06-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130707074343/http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|archivedate=2013-07-07}}</ref> a [[commune]] for penniless artists in [[Montmartre]], renting himself a studio in Rue Caulaincourt. Even though this artists' quarter of Montmartre was characterized by generalized poverty, Modigliani himself presented\u2014initially, at least\u2014as one would expect the son of a family trying to maintain the appearances of its lost financial standing to present: his wardrobe was dapper without ostentation, and the studio he rented was appointed in a style appropriate to someone with a finely attuned taste in plush drapery and Renaissance reproductions. He soon made efforts to assume the guise of the bohemian artist, but, even in his brown corduroys, scarlet scarf and large black hat, he continued to appear as if he were slumming it, having fallen upon harder times.<ref name=\"Werner 1967 17\" />\n\nWhen he first arrived in Paris, he wrote home regularly to his mother, he sketched his nudes at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi]], and he drank wine in moderation. He was at that time considered by those who knew him as a bit reserved, verging on the asocial.<ref name=\"Werner 1967 17\" /> He is noted to have commented, upon meeting [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] who, at the time, was wearing his trademark workmen's clothes, that even though the man was a genius, that did not excuse his uncouth appearance.<ref name=\"Werner 1967 17\" />\n\n===Transformation===\nWithin a year of arriving in Paris, however, his demeanour and reputation had changed dramatically. He transformed himself from a dapper academician artist into a sort of prince of vagabonds.\n\nThe poet and journalist [[Louis Latourette]], upon visiting the artist's previously well-appointed studio after his transformation, discovered the place in upheaval, the Renaissance reproductions discarded from the walls, the plush drapes in disarray. Modigliani was already an alcoholic and a drug addict by this time, and his studio reflected this. Modigliani's behaviour at this time sheds some light upon his developing style as an artist, in that the studio had become almost a sacrificial effigy for all that he resented about the academic art that had marked his life and his training up to that point.\n\nNot only did he remove all the trappings of his bourgeois heritage from his studio, but he also set about destroying practically all of his own early work, which he described as \"Childish baubles, done when I was a dirty bourgeois\".<ref name=\"Werner 1967 19\">{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 19| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}</ref>\n\nThe motivation for this violent rejection of his earlier self is the subject of considerable speculation. From the time of his arrival in Paris, Modigliani consciously crafted a charade persona for himself and cultivated his reputation as a hopeless drunk and voracious drug user. His escalating intake of drugs and alcohol may have been a means by which Modigliani masked his tuberculosis from his acquaintances, few of whom knew of his condition.<ref>Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 181, 183</ref> Tuberculosis\u2014the leading cause of death in France by 1900<ref>Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 181</ref>\u2014was highly communicable, there was no cure, and those who had it were feared, ostracized, and pitied. Modigliani thrived on camaraderie and would not let himself be isolated as an invalid; he used drink and drugs as palliatives to ease his physical pain, helping him to maintain a fa\u00e7ade of vitality and allowing him to continue to create his art.<ref>Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 298</ref>\n\nModigliani's use of drink and drugs intensified from about 1914 onward. After years of remission and recurrence, this was the period during which the symptoms of his tuberculosis worsened, signaling that the disease had reached an advanced stage.<ref>Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 182</ref>\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani - Nu Couch\u00e9 au coussin Bleu.jpg|thumb|''Nu Couch\u00e9 au coussin Bleu'', one of the finest examples of reclining nudes by Modigliani, 1916<ref>{{cite web|url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/.../279754.pdf |title=Women in Art, PDF|publisher=shareholder.com|accessdate=7 September 2018}}{{dl|date=September 2018}}</ref>]]\n\nHe sought the company of artists such as [[Maurice Utrillo|Utrillo]] and [[Chaim Soutine|Soutine]], seeking acceptance and validation for his work from his colleagues.<ref name=\"Werner 1967 19\" /> Modigliani's behavior stood out even in these [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] surroundings: he carried on frequent affairs, drank heavily, and used [[absinthe]] and [[hashish]].

Salmon claimed that whereas Modigliani was a totally pedestrian artist when sober, \"...from the day that he abandoned himself to certain forms of debauchery, an unexpected light came upon him, transforming his art.

He was constantly sketching, making as many as a hundred drawings a day. However, many of his works were lost\u2014destroyed by him as inferior, left behind in his frequent changes of address, or given to girlfriends who did not keep them.<ref name=\"werner-24\" />\n\nHe was first influenced by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], but around 1907 he became fascinated with the work of [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]]. Eventually he developed his own unique style, one that cannot be adequately categorized with those of other artists.\n\nHe met the first serious love of his life, Russian poet [[Anna Akhmatova]], in 1910, when he was 26. They had studios in the same building, and although 21-year-old Anna had recently married, they began an affair.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/11532201/Modigliani-and-the-Russian-beauty-the-affair-that-changed-him.html \"Modigliani and the Russian beauty: the affair that changed him\"] Retrieved 21 July 2015</ref> Anna was tall with dark hair, pale skin and grey-green eyes: she embodied Modigliani's aesthetic ideal and the pair became engrossed in each other.

Soon he was back in Paris, this time renting a [[studio]] in [[Montparnasse]]. He originally saw himself as a sculptor rather than a painter, and was encouraged to continue after [[Paul Guillaume]], an ambitious young art dealer, took an interest in his work and introduced him to sculptor [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]].

Jeanne began to pose for him and appears in several of his paintings. Jeanne H\u00e9buterne became a principal subject for Modigliani's art.\n\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani, 1919, Jeanne H\u00e9buterne, oil on canvas, 91.4 x 73 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|left|Amedeo Modigliani, 1919, ''Jeanne H\u00e9buterne'', oil on canvas, 91.4 x 73 cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\nOn December 3, 1917, Modigliani's first one-man [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] opened at the [[Berthe Weill]] Gallery in Paris. The chief of the Paris police was scandalized by Modigliani's nudes and forced him to close the exhibition within a few hours after its opening.\n\nTowards the end of the First World War, early in 1918, Modigliani left Paris with H\u00e9buterne to escape from the war and travelled to Nice and Cagnes-sur-Mer. They would spend a year in France. During that time they had a busy social life with many friends, including [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]].

Modigliani then got engaged to her, but Jeanne's parents were against the marriage, especially because of Modigliani's reputation as an alcoholic and drug user. However, Modigliani officially recognized her daughter as his child. The wedding plans were shattered independently of Jeanne's parents' resistance when Modigliani discovered he had a severe form of tuberculosis.\n\n==Death and funeral==\n\nAlthough he continued to paint, Modigliani's health deteriorated rapidly, and his alcohol-induced blackouts became more frequent.\n\nIn 1920, after not hearing from him for several days, a neighbour checked on the family and found Modigliani in bed delirious and holding onto H\u00e9buterne. A doctor was summoned, but little could be done because Modigliani was in the final stage of his disease, [[tubercular meningitis]]. He died on January 24, 1920, at the [[H\u00f4pital de la Charit\u00e9]].\n\nThere was an enormous funeral, attended by many from the artistic communities in Montmartre and Montparnasse. When Modigliani died, twenty-one-year-old H\u00e9buterne was eight months pregnant with their second child.\n\nA day later, H\u00e9buterne was taken to her parents' home. There, inconsolable, she threw herself out of a fifth-floor window, two days after Modigliani's death, killing herself and her unborn child. Modigliani was buried in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]].

Working during that fertile period of \u201cisms,\u201d [[Cubism]], [[Dada]]ism, [[Surrealism]], [[Futurism]], Modigliani did not choose to be categorized within any of these prevailing, defining confines. He was unclassifiable, stubbornly insisting on his difference. He was an artist putting down paint on canvas creating works not to shock and outrage, but to say, \u201cThis is what I see.\u201d\n\nMore appreciated over the years by collectors than academicians and critics, Modigliani was indifferent to staking a claim for himself in the intellectual [[avant-garde]] of the art world. One can say he recognized the merit of [[Jean Cocteau]]\u2019s proclamation: \u201cNe t'attardes pas avec l'avant-garde\u201d (\u201cDon\u2019t wait with the avant-garde\u201d).<ref>Secrest, Meryle, ''Modigliani'', Alfred A.

He is known for portraits and nudes in a [[modern art|modern]] style characterized by elongation of faces, necks, and figures that were not received well during his lifetime but later found acceptance. Modigliani spent his youth in Italy, where he studied the art of antiquity and the Renaissance. In 1906 he moved to Paris, where he came into contact with such artists as [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]]. By 1912 Modigliani was exhibiting highly stylized sculptures with Cubists of the [[Section d'Or]] group at the [[Salon d'Automne]].\n \nModigliani's oeuvre includes paintings and drawings. From 1909 to 1914 he devoted himself mainly to sculpture. His main subject was portraits and full figures, both in the images and in the sculptures. Modigliani had little success while alive, but after his death achieved great popularity. He died of [[tuberculous meningitis|tubercular meningitis]], at the age of 35, in Paris.\n\n==Family and early life==\n[[File:Modigliani Birthplace Livorno.jpg|thumb|upright|Modigliani's birthplace in [[Livorno]]]]\n\nModigliani was born into a [[Sephardic Jewish]] family in [[Livorno]], Italy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/modiglianis-sephardic-jewish-background-didnt-know/|title=Heroes \u2013 Trailblazers of the Jewish People|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> A port city, Livorno had long served as a refuge for those persecuted for their religion, and was home to a large [[History of the Jews in Livorno|Jewish community]].

Fluent in many languages, her ancestors were authorities on sacred Jewish texts and had founded a school of [[Talmud]]ic studies. Family legend traced the family lineage to the 17th-century Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]]. The family business was a credit agency with branches in Livorno, Marseille, Tunis, and London, though their fortunes ebbed and flowed.<ref>Secrest, ''Modigilani,'' Alfred Knopf, 2011, pp. 16\u201318</ref><ref name=\"Beyond the Myth\">[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=030010264X Klein, Mason, et al., ''Modigliani: Beyond the Myth'', page 197. The Jewish Museum and Yale University Press, 2004]</ref>\n\nModigliani's father, Flaminio, was a member of an Italian Jewish family of successful businessmen and entrepreneurs. While not as culturally sophisticated as the Garsins, they knew how to invest in and develop thriving business endeavors. When the Garsin and Modigliani families announced the engagement of their children, Flaminio was a wealthy young mining [[engineer]]. He managed the mine in Sardinia and also managed the almost {{convert|30000|acres|0|abbr=on}} of timberland the family owned.<ref>Secrest (2011), ''Modigilani,''pp. 24\u201325</ref>\n\nA reversal in fortune occurred to this prosperous family in 1883. An economic downturn in the price of metal plunged the Modiglianis into bankruptcy. Ever resourceful, Modigliani's mother used her social contacts to establish a school and, along with her two sisters, made the school into a successful enterprise.<ref>Secrest (2011), ''Modigilani,'' pp. 34\u201335</ref>\n\nAmedeo Modigliani was the fourth child, whose birth coincided with the disastrous financial collapse of his father's business interests. Amedeo's birth saved the family from ruin; according to an ancient law, creditors could not seize the bed of a pregnant woman or a mother with a newborn child. The bailiffs entered the family's home just as Eugenia went into labour; the family protected their most valuable assets by piling them on top of her.\n\nModigliani had a close relationship with his mother, who taught him at home until he was 10. Beset with health problems after an attack of [[pleurisy]] when he was about 11, a few years later he developed a case of [[typhoid fever]]. When he was 16 he was taken ill again and contracted the [[tuberculosis]] which would later claim his life. After Modigliani recovered from the second bout of pleurisy, his mother took him on a tour of southern Italy: [[Naples]], [[Capri]], [[Rome]] and [[Amalfi]], then north to [[Florence]] and [[Venice]].<ref>{{Cite book| last = Fifield | first = William | date = 19 June 1978 | title = Modigliani: A Biography | publisher = W.H.

When he was 11 years of age, she had noted in her diary: \"The child's character is still so unformed that I cannot say what I think of it. He behaves like a spoiled child, but he does not lack intelligence. We shall have to wait and see what is inside this chrysalis.

Despite her misgivings that launching him on a course of studying art would impinge upon his other studies, his mother indulged the young Modigliani's passion for the subject.\n\nAt the age of fourteen, while sick with typhoid fever, he raved in his delirium that he wanted, above all else, to see the paintings in the [[Palazzo Pitti]] and the [[Uffizi]] in Florence. As Livorno's local museum housed only a sparse few paintings by the [[Italian Renaissance]] masters, the tales he had heard about the great works held in Florence intrigued him, and it was a source of considerable despair to him, in his sickened state, that he might never get the chance to view them in person. His mother promised that she would take him to Florence herself, the moment he was recovered. Not only did she fulfil this promise, but she also undertook to enroll him with the best painting master in Livorno, [[Guglielmo Micheli]].\n\n===Micheli and the Macchiaioli===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}<!--only 2 citations-->\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani, c.1915, Portrait de Picasso, oil on cardboard, 43.2 x 26.7 cm.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of Pablo Picasso,'' 1915, private collection]]\n[[File:Modigliani in Venice - Calle dell'Avogaria (a S.Sebastiano), 1633.jpg|thumb|His home in Venice.]]\nModigliani worked in Micheli's Art School from 1898 to 1900. Among his colleagues in that studio would have been [[Llewelyn Lloyd (painter)|Llewelyn Lloyd]], [[Giulio Cesare Vinzio]], [[Manlio Martinelli]], [[Gino Romiti]], [[Renato Natali]], and [[Oscar Ghiglia]]. Here his earliest formal artistic instruction took place in an atmosphere steeped in a study of the styles and themes of 19th-century Italian art. In his earliest Parisian work, traces of this influence, and that of his studies of [[Renaissance art]], can still be seen. His nascent work was influenced by such Parisian artists as [[Giovanni Boldini]] and [[Toulouse-Lautrec]].\n\nModigliani showed great promise while with Micheli, and ceased his studies only when he was forced to, by the onset of tuberculosis.\n\nIn 1901, whilst in Rome, Modigliani admired the work of [[Domenico Morelli]], a painter of dramatic religious and literary scenes. Morelli had served as an inspiration for a group of iconoclasts who were known by the title \"the [[Macchiaioli]]\" (from ''macchia''&nbsp;\u2014\"dash of colour\", or, more derogatively, \"stain\"), and Modigliani had already been exposed to the influences of the Macchiaioli. This localized [[Landscape art|landscape]] movement reacted against the bourgeois stylings of the academic genre painters. While sympathetically connected to (and actually pre-dating) the [[French Impressionism|French Impressionists]], the Macchiaioli did not make the same impact upon international art culture as did the contemporaries and followers of [[Monet]], and are today largely forgotten outside Italy.\n\nModigliani's connection with the movement was through Guglielmo Micheli, his first art teacher. Micheli was not only a Macchiaiolo himself, but had been a pupil of the famous [[Giovanni Fattori]], a founder of the movement. Micheli's work, however, was so fashionable and the genre so commonplace that the young Modigliani reacted against it, preferring to ignore the obsession with landscape that, as with French Impressionism, characterized the movement. Micheli also tried to encourage his pupils to paint ''[[en plein air]]'', but Modigliani never really got a taste for this style of working, sketching in caf\u00e9s, but preferring to paint indoors, and especially in his own studio. Even when compelled to paint landscapes (three are known to exist),<ref>{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 16| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}</ref> Modigliani chose a proto-[[Cubism|Cubist]] palette more akin to [[C\u00e9zanne]] than to the Macchiaioli.\n\nWhile with Micheli, Modigliani studied not only landscape, but also portraiture, still life, and the nude. His fellow students recall that the last was where he displayed his greatest talent, and apparently this was not an entirely academic pursuit for the teenager: when not painting nudes, he was occupied with seducing the household maid.<ref name=\"Mann 1980 12\" />\n\nDespite his rejection of the Macchiaioli approach, Modigliani nonetheless found favour with his teacher, who referred to him as \"Superman\", a pet name reflecting the fact that Modigliani was not only quite adept at his art, but also that he regularly quoted from Nietzsche's ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''. Fattori himself would often visit the studio, and approved of the young artist's innovations.<ref name=\"Mann-1980-16\">{{Cite book| last = Mann | first = Carol | year = 1980 | title = Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | isbn = 0-500-20176-5 | page = 16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1902, Modigliani continued what was to be a lifelong infatuation with [[life drawing]], enrolling in the Scuola Libera di Nudo, or \"Free School of Nude Studies\", of the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze|Accademia di Belle Arti]] in Florence. A year later, while still suffering from tuberculosis, he moved to Venice, where he registered to study at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia|Regia Accademia ed Istituto di Belle Arti]].\nIt is in Venice that he first smoked [[hashish]] and, rather than studying, began to spend time frequenting disreputable parts of the city. The impact of these lifestyle choices upon his developing artistic style is open to conjecture, although these choices do seem to be more than simple [[teenage rebellion]], or the cliched [[hedonism]] and [[bohemianism]] that was almost expected of artists of the time; his pursuit of the seedier side of life appears to have roots in his appreciation of radical philosophies, including those of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]].\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani - Chaim Soutine (1917).jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of [[Chaim Soutine]],'' 1916]]\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani - Caryatid.jpg|thumb|upright|''Caryatid'', now at [[The New Art Gallery Walsall]] ]]\n\n===Early literary influences===\nHaving been exposed to erudite philosophical literature as a young boy under the tutelage of Isaco Garsin, his maternal grandfather, he continued to read and be influenced through his art studies by the writings of Nietzsche, [[Baudelaire]], [[Giosu\u00e8 Carducci|Carducci]], [[Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont]], and others, and developed the belief that the only route to true creativity was through defiance and disorder.\n\nLetters that he wrote from his 'sabbatical' in Capri in 1901 clearly indicate that he is being more and more influenced by the thinking of Nietzsche. In these letters, he advised friend Oscar Ghiglia;\n\n<blockquote>(hold sacred all) which can exalt and excite your intelligence... (and) ... seek to provoke ... and to perpetuate ... these fertile stimuli, because they can push the intelligence to its maximum creative power.<ref name=\"Werner 1967 17\">{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 17| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe work of [[Lautr\u00e9amont]] was equally influential at this time. This doomed poet's ''[[Les Chants de Maldoror]]'' became the seminal work for the Parisian [[Surrealists]] of Modigliani's generation, and the book became Modigliani's favourite to the extent that he learnt it by heart.<ref name=\"Mann-1980-16\" /> The poetry of Lautr\u00e9amont is characterized by the juxtaposition of fantastical elements, and by sadistic imagery; the fact that Modigliani was so taken by this text in his early teens gives a good indication of his developing tastes. Baudelaire and [[D'Annunzio]] similarly appealed to the young artist, with their interest in corrupted beauty, and the expression of that insight through [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] imagery.\n\nModigliani wrote to Ghiglia extensively from Capri, where his mother had taken him to assist in his recovery from tuberculosis. These letters are a sounding board for the developing ideas brewing in Modigliani's mind. Ghiglia was seven years Modigliani's senior, and it is likely that it was he who showed the young man the limits of his horizons in Livorno. Like all precocious teenagers, Modigliani preferred the company of older companions, and Ghiglia's role in his adolescence was to be a sympathetic ear as he worked himself out, principally in the convoluted letters that he regularly sent, and which survive today.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Mann | first = Carol | year = 1980 | title = Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | isbn = 0-500-20176-5 | pages = 19\u201322}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Dear friend, I write to pour myself out to you and to affirm myself to myself.

In fact, his arrival at the centre of artistic experimentation coincided with the arrival of two other foreigners who were also to leave their marks upon the art world: [[Gino Severini]] and [[Juan Gris]].\n\nHe later befriended [[Jacob Epstein]], they aimed to set up a studio together with a shared vision to create a Temple of Beauty to be enjoyed by all, for which Modigliani created drawings and paintings of the intended stone caryatids for \u2018The Pillars of Tenderness\u2019 which would support the imagined temple.<ref>{{cite web|title=Modigliani Caryatid Drawings|url=http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|work=The New Art Gallery Walsall Catalogue|publisher=[[The New Art Gallery Walsall]]|accessdate=2013-05-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130707074343/http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|archivedate=2013-07-07}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Le Bateau-Lavoir, circa 1910.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Le Bateau-Lavoir]] in 1910]]\nModigliani [[Squatting|squat]]ted in the [[Bateau-Lavoir]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Modigliani Caryatid Drawings|url=http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|publisher=[[The New Art Gallery Walsall]]|accessdate=2013-06-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130707074343/http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/shop/modigiliani-and-epstein|archivedate=2013-07-07}}</ref> a [[commune]] for penniless artists in [[Montmartre]], renting himself a studio in Rue Caulaincourt. Even though this artists' quarter of Montmartre was characterized by generalized poverty, Modigliani himself presented\u2014initially, at least\u2014as one would expect the son of a family trying to maintain the appearances of its lost financial standing to present: his wardrobe was dapper without ostentation, and the studio he rented was appointed in a style appropriate to someone with a finely attuned taste in plush drapery and Renaissance reproductions. He soon made efforts to assume the guise of the bohemian artist, but, even in his brown corduroys, scarlet scarf and large black hat, he continued to appear as if he were slumming it, having fallen upon harder times.<ref name=\"Werner 1967 17\" />\n\nWhen he first arrived in Paris, he wrote home regularly to his mother, he sketched his nudes at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi]], and he drank wine in moderation. He was at that time considered by those who knew him as a bit reserved, verging on the asocial.<ref name=\"Werner 1967 17\" /> He is noted to have commented, upon meeting [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] who, at the time, was wearing his trademark workmen's clothes, that even though the man was a genius, that did not excuse his uncouth appearance.<ref name=\"Werner 1967 17\" />\n\n===Transformation===\nWithin a year of arriving in Paris, however, his demeanour and reputation had changed dramatically. He transformed himself from a dapper academician artist into a sort of prince of vagabonds.\n\nThe poet and journalist [[Louis Latourette]], upon visiting the artist's previously well-appointed studio after his transformation, discovered the place in upheaval, the Renaissance reproductions discarded from the walls, the plush drapes in disarray. Modigliani was already an alcoholic and a drug addict by this time, and his studio reflected this. Modigliani's behaviour at this time sheds some light upon his developing style as an artist, in that the studio had become almost a sacrificial effigy for all that he resented about the academic art that had marked his life and his training up to that point.\n\nNot only did he remove all the trappings of his bourgeois heritage from his studio, but he also set about destroying practically all of his own early work, which he described as \"Childish baubles, done when I was a dirty bourgeois\".<ref name=\"Werner 1967 19\">{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 19| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}</ref>\n\nThe motivation for this violent rejection of his earlier self is the subject of considerable speculation. From the time of his arrival in Paris, Modigliani consciously crafted a charade persona for himself and cultivated his reputation as a hopeless drunk and voracious drug user. His escalating intake of drugs and alcohol may have been a means by which Modigliani masked his tuberculosis from his acquaintances, few of whom knew of his condition.<ref>Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 181, 183</ref> Tuberculosis\u2014the leading cause of death in France by 1900<ref>Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 181</ref>\u2014was highly communicable, there was no cure, and those who had it were feared, ostracized, and pitied. Modigliani thrived on camaraderie and would not let himself be isolated as an invalid; he used drink and drugs as palliatives to ease his physical pain, helping him to maintain a fa\u00e7ade of vitality and allowing him to continue to create his art.<ref>Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 298</ref>\n\nModigliani's use of drink and drugs intensified from about 1914 onward. After years of remission and recurrence, this was the period during which the symptoms of his tuberculosis worsened, signaling that the disease had reached an advanced stage.<ref>Secrest, Meryle, Modigliani, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 182</ref>\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani - Nu Couch\u00e9 au coussin Bleu.jpg|thumb|''Nu Couch\u00e9 au coussin Bleu'', one of the finest examples of reclining nudes by Modigliani, 1916<ref>{{cite web|url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/.../279754.pdf |title=Women in Art, PDF|publisher=shareholder.com|accessdate=7 September 2018}}{{dl|date=September 2018}}</ref>]]\n\nHe sought the company of artists such as [[Maurice Utrillo|Utrillo]] and [[Chaim Soutine|Soutine]], seeking acceptance and validation for his work from his colleagues.<ref name=\"Werner 1967 19\" /> Modigliani's behavior stood out even in these [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] surroundings: he carried on frequent affairs, drank heavily, and used [[absinthe]] and [[hashish]].

Salmon claimed that whereas Modigliani was a totally pedestrian artist when sober, \"...from the day that he abandoned himself to certain forms of debauchery, an unexpected light came upon him, transforming his art. From that day on, he became one who must be counted among the masters of living art.\"<ref name=\"Werner 1967 20\">{{Cite book| last = Werner | first = Alfred | year = 1967 | title = Amedeo Modigliani | location = London | publisher = Thames and Hudson. | page = 20| isbn = 0-8109-0323-7}}</ref>\n\nSome art historians suggest<ref name=\"Werner 1967 20\" /> that it is entirely possible that Modigliani would have achieved even greater artistic heights had he not been immured in, and destroyed by, his own self-indulgences.\n\n===Output===\nDuring his early years in Paris, Modigliani worked at a furious pace. He was constantly sketching, making as many as a hundred drawings a day. However, many of his works were lost\u2014destroyed by him as inferior, left behind in his frequent changes of address, or given to girlfriends who did not keep them.<ref name=\"werner-24\" />\n\nHe was first influenced by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], but around 1907 he became fascinated with the work of [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]]. Eventually he developed his own unique style, one that cannot be adequately categorized with those of other artists.\n\nHe met the first serious love of his life, Russian poet [[Anna Akhmatova]], in 1910, when he was 26. They had studios in the same building, and although 21-year-old Anna had recently married, they began an affair.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/11532201/Modigliani-and-the-Russian-beauty-the-affair-that-changed-him.html \"Modigliani and the Russian beauty: the affair that changed him\"] Retrieved 21 July 2015</ref> Anna was tall with dark hair, pale skin and grey-green eyes: she embodied Modigliani's aesthetic ideal and the pair became engrossed in each other.

From a conservative [[bourgeois]] background, H\u00e9buterne was renounced by her devout [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] family for her liaison with Modigliani, whom they saw as little more than a debauched derelict. Despite her family's objections, soon they were living together.\n\nModigliani ended his relationship with the English poet and art critic Beatrice Hastings and a short time later H\u00e9buterne and Modigliani moved together into a studio on the Rue de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re. Jeanne began to pose for him and appears in several of his paintings. Jeanne H\u00e9buterne became a principal subject for Modigliani's art.\n\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani, 1919, Jeanne H\u00e9buterne, oil on canvas, 91.4 x 73 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|left|Amedeo Modigliani, 1919, ''Jeanne H\u00e9buterne'', oil on canvas, 91.4 x 73 cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\nOn December 3, 1917, Modigliani's first one-man [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] opened at the [[Berthe Weill]] Gallery in Paris. The chief of the Paris police was scandalized by Modigliani's nudes and forced him to close the exhibition within a few hours after its opening.\n\nTowards the end of the First World War, early in 1918, Modigliani left Paris with H\u00e9buterne to escape from the war and travelled to Nice and Cagnes-sur-Mer. They would spend a year in France. During that time they had a busy social life with many friends, including [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]]. [[File:Portr\u00e4t der Jeanne H\u00e9buterne, Amedeo Modigliani.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of [[Jeanne H\u00e9buterne]], 1918]] After he and H\u00e9buterne moved to Nice on November 29, 1918, she gave birth to a daughter whom they named [[Jeanne Modigliani|Jeanne]] (1918\u20131984). In May 1919 they returned to Paris with their infant daughter and moved into an apartment on the rue de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re.\n \nH\u00e9buterne became pregnant again. Modigliani then got engaged to her, but Jeanne's parents were against the marriage, especially because of Modigliani's reputation as an alcoholic and drug user. However, Modigliani officially recognized her daughter as his child. The wedding plans were shattered independently of Jeanne's parents' resistance when Modigliani discovered he had a severe form of tuberculosis.\n\n==Death and funeral==\n\nAlthough he continued to paint, Modigliani's health deteriorated rapidly, and his alcohol-induced blackouts became more frequent.\n\nIn 1920, after not hearing from him for several days, a neighbour checked on the family and found Modigliani in bed delirious and holding onto H\u00e9buterne. A doctor was summoned, but little could be done because Modigliani was in the final stage of his disease, [[tubercular meningitis]]. He died on January 24, 1920, at the [[H\u00f4pital de la Charit\u00e9]].\n\nThere was an enormous funeral, attended by many from the artistic communities in Montmartre and Montparnasse. When Modigliani died, twenty-one-year-old H\u00e9buterne was eight months pregnant with their second child.\n\nA day later, H\u00e9buterne was taken to her parents' home. There, inconsolable, she threw herself out of a fifth-floor window, two days after Modigliani's death, killing herself and her unborn child. Modigliani was buried in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]]. H\u00e9buterne was buried at the [[Cimeti\u00e8re de Bagneux]] near [[Paris]], and it was not until 1930 that her embittered family allowed her body to be moved to rest beside Modigliani. A single tombstone honors them both. His epitaph reads: \"Struck down by death at the moment of glory\". Hers reads: \"Devoted companion to the extreme sacrifice\".<ref name=\"Journal\">{{cite journal |first=Linda |last=Lappin |authorlink=Linda Lappin |date=June 22, 2002 |title=Missing person in Montparnasse: The case of Jeanne Hebuterne |journal=Literary Review |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=785\u2013811 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-91040705.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610085904/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-91040705.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\nManaging only one solo exhibition in his life and giving his work away in exchange for meals in restaurants, Modigliani died destitute.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Amedeo Modigliani 1919.jpg|thumb|upright|Modigliani in 1919, near the end of his life]]\n[[File:AmedeoModigliani.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Modigliani and H\u00e9buterne in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]]]]\n\n===Influences===\nThe linear form of African sculpture and the depictive humanism of the figurative [[Renaissance art|Renaissance painters]] informed his work. Working during that fertile period of \u201cisms,\u201d [[Cubism]], [[Dada]]ism, [[Surrealism]], [[Futurism]], Modigliani did not choose to be categorized within any of these prevailing, defining confines. He was unclassifiable, stubbornly insisting on his difference. He was an artist putting down paint on canvas creating works not to shock and outrage, but to say, \u201cThis is what I see.\u201d\n\nMore appreciated over the years by collectors than academicians and critics, Modigliani was indifferent to staking a claim for himself in the intellectual [[avant-garde]] of the art world. One can say he recognized the merit of [[Jean Cocteau]]\u2019s proclamation: \u201cNe t'attardes pas avec l'avant-garde\u201d (\u201cDon\u2019t wait with the avant-garde\u201d).<ref>Secrest, Meryle, ''Modigliani'', Alfred A.

Nine novels, a play, a documentary, and three feature films have been devoted to his life. Modigliani's sister in Florence adopted his daughter, [[Jeanne Modigliani|Jeanne]] (1918\u20131984). As an adult, she wrote a biography of her father titled ''Modigliani: Man and Myth''.\n\n===Catalogue raisonn\u00e9s===\nThe Modigliani estate is one of the most problematic in the art world.

[[Arthur Pfannstiel]] (1929 and 1956) and [[Joseph Lanthemann]]'s (1970) books are widely dismissed today.

Due to the [[political status of Taiwan]], it is rooted in and overlaps with '''Taiwanese [[Localism (politics)|localism]]''', the promotion and emphasis of Taiwanese culture, society, and [[Taiwanese identity|identity]] within the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]]. This involves the education of history, geography, and [[culture of Taiwan|culture]] from a Taiwan-centric perspective, promoting native languages of Taiwan such as [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], and [[Formosan languages|indigenous languages]], as well as reforms in other aspects.\n\nSince [[History of Taiwan#Democratic reforms|democratisation]] and the development of [[Cross-Strait relations]], localism in Taiwan has evolved into a [[Nationalism|nationalist]] political ideology with a stronger emphasis on self-rule as opposed to [[Chinese unification|unification]]. Taiwanese nationalism seeks to unite residents of Taiwan into a nation and people group of a common Taiwanese identity. This has further led to emergence of a [[Taiwan independence movement]] which has some but not unanimous support from the public.\n\n== History and development ==\n[[File:\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u7b2c\u4e00\u4f4d\u6c11\u9078\u9996\u90fd\u5e02\u9577\u5433\u4e09\u9023\u65bc1951\u5e74\u52dd\u9078\u5f8c First People-elected Mayor of Taipei, the Capital of TAIWAN.jpg|thumb|[[Tangwai movement|Tangwai]] politicians in Taipei in 1951.]]{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n\nNo one can confirm when the concept of localism has started. Some say when the first large wave of Han people emigrated from mainland China to Taiwan in the mid-16th century, they must have wanted to maintain some independence from the control of the ruling class in their original hometown. Others say that only when the [[Kingdom of Tungning]], with its capital at Tainan, was built by the Zheng family in 1662, did this concept appear.\n\nMost Chinese contemporary scholars of Mainland China believe the roots of the localist movement began during the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] (1895 to 1945), when groups organized to lobby the [[Imperial Japan]]ese government for greater Taiwanese autonomy and home rule. After the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) took over Taiwan, the Taiwan home-rule groups were decimated in the wake of the [[February 28 Incident]] of 1947. The KMT viewed Taiwan primarily as a base to retake mainland China and quickly tried to subdue potential political opposition on the island. The KMT did little to promote a unique Taiwanese identity; often newly immigrated Chinese or \"[[Mainland Chinese|mainlander]]s\" as they were called, working in administrative positions, lived in neighborhoods where they were segregated from the Taiwanese. Others, especially poorer refugees, were shunned by the [[Hoklo people|Hoklo Taiwanese]] and lived among aborigines instead. The mainlanders often learned [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Hokkien]]. However, since Mandarin was enforced as the official language of the Republic of China and Taiwanese was not allowed to be spoken in schools, the mainlanders who learned Taiwanese found their new language skills to diminish. As Taiwanese, or any language other than Mandarin, was forbidden in the military posts, many mainlanders whose family lived in [[Military dependents' village|martial villages]] only spoke Mandarin and perhaps their home language (e.g. [[Cantonese]], [[Shanghainese]], etc.). The promotion of [[Chinese nationalism]] within Taiwan and the fact that the ruling group on Taiwan were considered outsiders by some were the reasons cited for both the [[Taiwan independence]] movement and localism.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s there was a shift in power away from the KMT to people native to Taiwan. This, combined with cultural liberalization and the increasing remoteness of the possibility of retaking mainland China, led to a cultural and political movement which emphasized a Taiwan-centered view of history and culture rather than one which was China-centered or even, as before 1946, Japan-centered. localism was strongly supported by President [[Lee Teng-hui]].\n\nThe ''Bentuhua'' movement was sparked in the mid-1970s with the growing expression of ethnic discontent due to unequal distribution of political and cultural power between mainlanders and Taiwanese people. Beginning in the 1960s, Taiwan was enveloped by the problems of rapid industrial development, rural abandonment, labor disputes and the uneven distribution of access to wealth and social power. These changes, combined with the loss of several key allies, forced the KMT regime to institute limited reforms. The reforms permitted under Chiang Ching-kuo allowed indigenization to increase as leading dissidents generated a response to the government's failures. The dissident groups, united under the \"[[tangwai movement|Tangwai]]\", or \u201coutside the party\u201d banner, called for the government to accept the reality that it was only the government of Taiwan and not China. The key demands of the Tangwai involved instituting democracy and seeking international recognition as a sovereign state. Taiwanese demanded full civil rights as guaranteed under the ROC constitution and equal political rights as those experienced by the Mainlander elite.\n\nThe Taiwanese cultural elite fully promoted the development of ''Xiang tu'' literature and cultural activities, including rediscovering Taiwanese nativist literature written under Japanese colonial rule. The [[tangwai movement]] revived symbols of Taiwanese resistance to Japanese rule in the effort to mobilize ethnic Taiwanese. The opposition to the KMT's China-centered cultural policies resulted in dissidents crafting new national-historical narratives that placed the island of Taiwan itself at the center of the island's history. The Taiwanese emerged as a frequently colonized and often oppressed people. The concept of ''bentuhua'' was finally expressed in the cultural domain in the premise of Taiwan as a place with a unique society, culture and history. This principle has been largely adopted for understanding Taiwan's cultural representation and expressed in a variety of cultural activities, including [[Taiwanese literature movement|music, film and the literary and performing arts]].\n\nThe pressures of indigenization and the growing acceptance of a unique Taiwanese cultural identity have met opposition from more conservative elements of Taiwan society. Critics argue that the new perspective creates a \u201cfalse\u201d identity rooted in ethnic nationalism as opposed to an \u201cauthentic\u201d Chinese identity, which is primordial and inherent. Many mainlanders living on Taiwan complain that their own culture is marginalized by ''bentuhua'', and initially expressed fear of facing growing alienation. In the past decade these complaints have subsided somewhat as Taiwan increasingly views itself as a pluralistic society that embraces many cultures and recognizes the rights of all citizens.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, gestures toward localism were increasingly adopted by pro-unification figures who, while supporting the Chinese nationalism of [[Chiang Kai-shek]], saw it as appropriate, or at least advisable, to display more appreciation for cultures of Taiwan. Pro-unification politicians such as [[James Soong]], the former head of the Government Information Office who once oversaw the limitation of Taiwanese dialects, began speaking in Hoklo on semi-formal occasions.\n\n== Name rectification ==\n\nEfforts have been made by the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) government beginning in 2000 to distance itself from [[China]] and rollback earlier sinicisation efforts by taking actions such as removing Chinese influence from items within Taiwan control. While the nationalists may view such efforts as emphasising the importance of Taiwan's culture, this section addresses the perspective of those who likely support the [[Chinese reunification]] of all of [[Greater China]] under a single political entity.\n\n=== Origin ===\n[[File:Wild-lily-movement.jpg|thumb|[[Wild Lily student movement|Wild Lily Movement]] in Taipei.]]\nAt the end of [[World War II]], Chinese [[Kuomintang]] forces [[Retrocession Day|took over]] Taiwan and soon began an effort to [[Sinicize#Taiwan|sinicise]] the population. Taiwanese urban elites were wiped out in the [[February 28 Incident]]. [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]] became the only language allowed in media and school to the exclusion of other [[languages of Taiwan]], as well as Japanese. Public institutions and corporations were given names that included the words \"China\" or \"Chinese\".  School history and geography lessons focused on China with little attention paid to Taiwan.  Street names in Taipei were changed from their original names to Chinese names that reflected the geography of China and Kuomintang ideals.<ref>{{cite conference | first = June Teufel | last = Dreyer | title = Taiwan's Evolving Identity | url = http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=events.event_summary&event_id=31149 | location = Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars | quote = In order to shore up his government\u2019s legitimacy, Chiang set about turning Taiwan\u2019s inhabitants into Chinese.

In response, the CPC publicly reminded its military to be prepared to achieve its goal of \"[[Chinese reunification]]\" (intended to mean making Taiwan a part of the People's Republic of China) through military means. In addition, the CPC sought assistance from the United States to address the matter with Taiwan.

Vocal opponents are primarily the 1949-generation Mainlanders, or older generations of Mainlanders living in Taiwan that had spent their formative years and adulthood on the pre-1949 mainland Republic of China, and native Taiwanese who identify with a pan-Han Chinese cultural identity.  They included people ranging from academics like [[Chien Mu]], reputed to be the last prominent Chinese intellectual opposing the [[conventional wisdom]] take on the [[May Fourth Movement]], politicians like [[Lien Chan]], from a family with a long history of active pan-Chinese patriotism despite being native Taiwanese, to gang mobsters like [[Chang An-lo]], a leader of the notorious [[United Bamboo Gang]].\n\nThe opposing voices were subsequently confined to the fringe in the mid 2000s Taiwan itself. Issues persist, particularly supporters of the [[Pan-Blue coalition]], which advocates retaining a strong link to mainland China, dispute over such issues as what histories to teach. Nonetheless both of the two major political forces in Taiwan reached a consensus, and the movement has overwhelming support among the population.  This is in part due to the 1949-generation Mainlanders have gradually passed on from the scene, and politicians supporting and opposing the Taiwanese independence movement both realize a majority of Taiwan's current residents, either because they are born in Taiwan to Mainlander parents with no collective memories of their ancestral homes, or they are native Taiwanese, thus feeling no historical connotations with the entire pre-1949 Republic of China on mainland China, support the movement as such.\n\nIn mainland China, the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] government has on the surface adopted a neutral policy on localism and its highest-level leaders publicly proclaim it does not consider the localist movement to be either a violation of its [[One China Policy]] or equivalent to the independence movement. Nonetheless, the state-owned media and academics employed by organizations such as universities' Institutes of Taiwan Studies or the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] (CASS) periodically release study results, academic journal articles, or editorials strongly criticizing the movement as \"the cultural arm of Taiwanese independence movement\" ({{zh|links=no|c=\u6587\u5316\u53f0\u7368}}) with the government's tacit approval, showing the PRC government's opposition towards localism.\n\nNowadays, another source of significant opposition to the localist movement remains in the [[overseas Chinese]] communities in Southeast Asia and the Western world, who identify more with the historic pre-1949 mainland Republic of China or pre-localist movement ROC on Taiwan that oriented itself as the rump legitimate government of China. A great many are themselves refugees and dissidents who fled mainland China, either directly or through Hong Kong or Taiwan, during the founding of the People's Republic of China and the subsequent periods of destructive policies (such as the [[Land Reform]], the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]], [[Great Leap Forward]], or the [[Cultural Revolution]]), [[Hong Kong]] anti-Communist immigrants who fled Hong Kong in light of the Handover to the PRC in 1997, or Mainlanders living in Taiwan who moved to the West in response to the localist movement. Conversely, the current population of Taiwan regard these overseas Chinese as foreigners akin to [[Singapore]]an Chinese, as opposed to the pre-localist era when they were labeled as fellow Chinese compatriots. The PRC has capitalized on this window of opportunity in making overtures to the traditionally anti-Communist overseas Chinese communities, including gestures in supporting traditional Chinese culture and dumping explicitly Communist tones in overseas communications. This results in a decline of active political opposition to the PRC from overseas Chinese when compared with the times before the localist movement in Taiwan.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Taiwanese localist movements have pushed localization or pro-Chinese Communist tilts among the traditionally pro-Republic of China individuals and organizations. A prominent example is Chu Hai College, whose academic degree programs were recognized officially by the Hong Kong SAR government in May 2004, and registered as an \"Approved Post-secondary College\" with the Hong Kong SAR government since July of the same year. It has since been renamed the Chu Hai College of Higher Education (\u73e0\u6d77\u5b78\u9662) and no longer registered with the Republic of China's Ministry of Education. New students from 2004 have been awarded degrees in the right of Hong Kong rather than Taiwan.\n\n==Role in domestic politics==\n{{Main|Tangwai movement}}\nEven though it is a broad consensus currently regarding the overall ideology of localism, there are still deep disputes over practical policies between the three main political groups of [[Taiwan independence]], [[Chinese reunification]], and supporters of [[Chinese culture]]. Pro-independence supporters argue that Taiwan is and should be enhancing an identity which is separate from the Chinese one, and in more extreme cases advocates the removal of Chinese \"imprints\". Meanwhile, some would argue that Taiwan should create a distinctive identity that either includes certain Chinese aspect or exists within a broader Chinese one. Those who support Chinese reunification call for a policy of enhancing the Chinese identity. Groups that support [[Chinese reunification]] and [[Chinese nationalism]] have emphasized the distinction between localism and what some perceive as [[desalinisation]] and argued that they do not oppose the promotion of a Taiwanese identity, but rather oppose the use of that identity to separate itself from a broader Chinese one. On the other hand, a few apolitical groups have claimed that most of the political factions merely use these points to win support for elections{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Taiwan|China}}\n* [[Sinocentrism]]\n* [[Sinicization]]\n* [[Desinicization]]\n* [[Taiwanese literature movement]]\n* [[Taiwanese people]]\n* [[Formosa Alliance]]\n* [[Tangwai movement]]\n* [[Taiwanese literature movement]]\n* [[Taiwan independence movement]]\n* [[Formosa Alliance]]\n* [[Taiwanese people]]\n* [[History of Taiwan]]\n* [[February 28 Incident]]\n* [[Qiandao Lake Incident]]\n* [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis]]\n* [[Seediq Bale]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n2.

Due to the [[political status of Taiwan]], it is rooted in and overlaps with '''Taiwanese [[Localism (politics)|localism]]''', the promotion and emphasis of Taiwanese culture, society, and [[Taiwanese identity|identity]] within the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]]. This involves the education of history, geography, and [[culture of Taiwan|culture]] from a Taiwan-centric perspective, promoting native languages of Taiwan such as [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], and [[Formosan languages|indigenous languages]], as well as reforms in other aspects.\n\nSince [[History of Taiwan#Democratic reforms|democratisation]] and the development of [[Cross-Strait relations]], localism in Taiwan has evolved into a [[Nationalism|nationalist]] political ideology with a stronger emphasis on self-rule as opposed to [[Chinese unification|unification]]. Taiwanese nationalism seeks to unite residents of Taiwan into a nation and people group of a common Taiwanese identity. This has further led to emergence of a [[Taiwan independence movement]] which has some but not unanimous support from the public.\n\n== History and development ==\n[[File:\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u7b2c\u4e00\u4f4d\u6c11\u9078\u9996\u90fd\u5e02\u9577\u5433\u4e09\u9023\u65bc1951\u5e74\u52dd\u9078\u5f8c First People-elected Mayor of Taipei, the Capital of TAIWAN.jpg|thumb|[[Tangwai movement|Tangwai]] politicians in Taipei in 1951.]]{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n\nNo one can confirm when the concept of localism has started. Some say when the first large wave of Han people emigrated from mainland China to Taiwan in the mid-16th century, they must have wanted to maintain some independence from the control of the ruling class in their original hometown. Others say that only when the [[Kingdom of Tungning]], with its capital at Tainan, was built by the Zheng family in 1662, did this concept appear.\n\nMost Chinese contemporary scholars of Mainland China believe the roots of the localist movement began during the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] (1895 to 1945), when groups organized to lobby the [[Imperial Japan]]ese government for greater Taiwanese autonomy and home rule. After the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) took over Taiwan, the Taiwan home-rule groups were decimated in the wake of the [[February 28 Incident]] of 1947. The KMT viewed Taiwan primarily as a base to retake mainland China and quickly tried to subdue potential political opposition on the island. The KMT did little to promote a unique Taiwanese identity; often newly immigrated Chinese or \"[[Mainland Chinese|mainlander]]s\" as they were called, working in administrative positions, lived in neighborhoods where they were segregated from the Taiwanese. Others, especially poorer refugees, were shunned by the [[Hoklo people|Hoklo Taiwanese]] and lived among aborigines instead. The mainlanders often learned [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Hokkien]]. However, since Mandarin was enforced as the official language of the Republic of China and Taiwanese was not allowed to be spoken in schools, the mainlanders who learned Taiwanese found their new language skills to diminish. As Taiwanese, or any language other than Mandarin, was forbidden in the military posts, many mainlanders whose family lived in [[Military dependents' village|martial villages]] only spoke Mandarin and perhaps their home language (e.g. [[Cantonese]], [[Shanghainese]], etc.). The promotion of [[Chinese nationalism]] within Taiwan and the fact that the ruling group on Taiwan were considered outsiders by some were the reasons cited for both the [[Taiwan independence]] movement and localism.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s there was a shift in power away from the KMT to people native to Taiwan. This, combined with cultural liberalization and the increasing remoteness of the possibility of retaking mainland China, led to a cultural and political movement which emphasized a Taiwan-centered view of history and culture rather than one which was China-centered or even, as before 1946, Japan-centered. localism was strongly supported by President [[Lee Teng-hui]].\n\nThe ''Bentuhua'' movement was sparked in the mid-1970s with the growing expression of ethnic discontent due to unequal distribution of political and cultural power between mainlanders and Taiwanese people. Beginning in the 1960s, Taiwan was enveloped by the problems of rapid industrial development, rural abandonment, labor disputes and the uneven distribution of access to wealth and social power. These changes, combined with the loss of several key allies, forced the KMT regime to institute limited reforms. The reforms permitted under Chiang Ching-kuo allowed indigenization to increase as leading dissidents generated a response to the government's failures. The dissident groups, united under the \"[[tangwai movement|Tangwai]]\", or \u201coutside the party\u201d banner, called for the government to accept the reality that it was only the government of Taiwan and not China. The key demands of the Tangwai involved instituting democracy and seeking international recognition as a sovereign state. Taiwanese demanded full civil rights as guaranteed under the ROC constitution and equal political rights as those experienced by the Mainlander elite.\n\nThe Taiwanese cultural elite fully promoted the development of ''Xiang tu'' literature and cultural activities, including rediscovering Taiwanese nativist literature written under Japanese colonial rule. The [[tangwai movement]] revived symbols of Taiwanese resistance to Japanese rule in the effort to mobilize ethnic Taiwanese. The opposition to the KMT's China-centered cultural policies resulted in dissidents crafting new national-historical narratives that placed the island of Taiwan itself at the center of the island's history. The Taiwanese emerged as a frequently colonized and often oppressed people. The concept of ''bentuhua'' was finally expressed in the cultural domain in the premise of Taiwan as a place with a unique society, culture and history. This principle has been largely adopted for understanding Taiwan's cultural representation and expressed in a variety of cultural activities, including [[Taiwanese literature movement|music, film and the literary and performing arts]].\n\nThe pressures of indigenization and the growing acceptance of a unique Taiwanese cultural identity have met opposition from more conservative elements of Taiwan society. Critics argue that the new perspective creates a \u201cfalse\u201d identity rooted in ethnic nationalism as opposed to an \u201cauthentic\u201d Chinese identity, which is primordial and inherent. Many mainlanders living on Taiwan complain that their own culture is marginalized by ''bentuhua'', and initially expressed fear of facing growing alienation. In the past decade these complaints have subsided somewhat as Taiwan increasingly views itself as a pluralistic society that embraces many cultures and recognizes the rights of all citizens.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, gestures toward localism were increasingly adopted by pro-unification figures who, while supporting the Chinese nationalism of [[Chiang Kai-shek]], saw it as appropriate, or at least advisable, to display more appreciation for cultures of Taiwan. Pro-unification politicians such as [[James Soong]], the former head of the Government Information Office who once oversaw the limitation of Taiwanese dialects, began speaking in Hoklo on semi-formal occasions.\n\n== Name rectification ==\n\nEfforts have been made by the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) government beginning in 2000 to distance itself from [[China]] and rollback earlier sinicisation efforts by taking actions such as removing Chinese influence from items within Taiwan control. While the nationalists may view such efforts as emphasising the importance of Taiwan's culture, this section addresses the perspective of those who likely support the [[Chinese reunification]] of all of [[Greater China]] under a single political entity.\n\n=== Origin ===\n[[File:Wild-lily-movement.jpg|thumb|[[Wild Lily student movement|Wild Lily Movement]] in Taipei.]]\nAt the end of [[World War II]], Chinese [[Kuomintang]] forces [[Retrocession Day|took over]] Taiwan and soon began an effort to [[Sinicize#Taiwan|sinicise]] the population. Taiwanese urban elites were wiped out in the [[February 28 Incident]].

In response, the CPC publicly reminded its military to be prepared to achieve its goal of \"[[Chinese reunification]]\" (intended to mean making Taiwan a part of the People's Republic of China) through military means. In addition, the CPC sought assistance from the United States to address the matter with Taiwan. As part of making the upcoming U.S. visit by then vice-president [[Hu Jintao]] go smoothly, the United States cautioned the [[Chen Shui-bian]] administration not to \"go too far\" in [[cross-Strait relations]].<ref>[[Ming Pao|Hong Kong Ming Pao]] (12 April 2002) [[Open Source Center|World News Connection]] ''U.S. Cautions Taiwan Not To \"Go Too Far\" in Cross-Strait Relations.''</ref>\n\nIn April 2005, the Communist Party of China (CPC) general secretary Hu Jintao and the former ROC Vice President and then chairman of the Kuomintang party (KMT) [[Lien Chan]] shook hands.

Vocal opponents are primarily the 1949-generation Mainlanders, or older generations of Mainlanders living in Taiwan that had spent their formative years and adulthood on the pre-1949 mainland Republic of China, and native Taiwanese who identify with a pan-Han Chinese cultural identity.  They included people ranging from academics like [[Chien Mu]], reputed to be the last prominent Chinese intellectual opposing the [[conventional wisdom]] take on the [[May Fourth Movement]], politicians like [[Lien Chan]], from a family with a long history of active pan-Chinese patriotism despite being native Taiwanese, to gang mobsters like [[Chang An-lo]], a leader of the notorious [[United Bamboo Gang]].\n\nThe opposing voices were subsequently confined to the fringe in the mid 2000s Taiwan itself. Issues persist, particularly supporters of the [[Pan-Blue coalition]], which advocates retaining a strong link to mainland China, dispute over such issues as what histories to teach. Nonetheless both of the two major political forces in Taiwan reached a consensus, and the movement has overwhelming support among the population.  This is in part due to the 1949-generation Mainlanders have gradually passed on from the scene, and politicians supporting and opposing the Taiwanese independence movement both realize a majority of Taiwan's current residents, either because they are born in Taiwan to Mainlander parents with no collective memories of their ancestral homes, or they are native Taiwanese, thus feeling no historical connotations with the entire pre-1949 Republic of China on mainland China, support the movement as such.\n\nIn mainland China, the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] government has on the surface adopted a neutral policy on localism and its highest-level leaders publicly proclaim it does not consider the localist movement to be either a violation of its [[One China Policy]] or equivalent to the independence movement. Nonetheless, the state-owned media and academics employed by organizations such as universities' Institutes of Taiwan Studies or the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] (CASS) periodically release study results, academic journal articles, or editorials strongly criticizing the movement as \"the cultural arm of Taiwanese independence movement\" (Chinese: \u6587\u5316\u53f0\u7368) with the government's tacit approval, showing the PRC government's opposition towards localism.\n\nNowadays, another source of significant opposition to the localist movement remains in the [[overseas Chinese]] communities in Southeast Asia and the Western world, who identify more with the historic pre-1949 mainland Republic of China or pre-localist movement ROC on Taiwan that oriented itself as the rump legitimate government of China. A great many are themselves refugees and dissidents who fled mainland China, either directly or through Hong Kong or Taiwan, during the founding of the People's Republic of China and the subsequent periods of destructive policies (such as the [[Land Reform]], the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]], [[Great Leap Forward]], or the [[Cultural Revolution]]), [[Hong Kong]] anti-Communist immigrants who fled Hong Kong in light of the Handover to the PRC in 1997, or Mainlanders living in Taiwan who moved to the West in response to the localist movement. Conversely, the current population of Taiwan regard these overseas Chinese as foreigners akin to [[Singapore]]an Chinese, as opposed to the pre-localist era when they were labeled as fellow Chinese compatriots. The PRC has capitalized on this window of opportunity in making overtures to the traditionally anti-Communist overseas Chinese communities, including gestures in supporting traditional Chinese culture and dumping explicitly Communist tones in overseas communications. This results in a decline of active political opposition to the PRC from overseas Chinese when compared with the times before the localist movement in Taiwan.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Taiwanese localist movements have pushed localization or pro-Chinese Communist tilts among the traditionally pro-Republic of China individuals and organizations. A prominent example is Chu Hai College, whose academic degree programs were recognized officially by the Hong Kong SAR government in May 2004, and registered as an \"Approved Post-secondary College\" with the Hong Kong SAR government since July of the same year. It has since been renamed the Chu Hai College of Higher Education (\u73e0\u6d77\u5b78\u9662) and no longer registered with the Republic of China's Ministry of Education. New students from 2004 have been awarded degrees in the right of Hong Kong rather than Taiwan.\n\n==Role in domestic politics==\n{{Main|Tangwai movement}}\nEven though it is a broad consensus currently regarding the overall ideology of localism, there are still deep disputes over practical policies between the three main political groups of [[Taiwan independence]], [[Chinese reunification]], and supporters of [[Chinese culture]]. Pro-independence supporters argue that Taiwan is and should be enhancing an identity which is separate from the Chinese one, and in more extreme cases advocates the removal of Chinese \"imprints\". Meanwhile, some would argue that Taiwan should create a distinctive identity that either includes certain Chinese aspect or exists within a broader Chinese one. Those who support Chinese reunification call for a policy of enhancing the Chinese identity. Groups that support [[Chinese reunification]] and [[Chinese nationalism]] have emphasized the distinction between localism and what some perceive as [[desalinisation]] and argued that they do not oppose the promotion of a Taiwanese identity, but rather oppose the use of that identity to separate itself from a broader Chinese one. On the other hand, a few apolitical groups have claimed that most of the political factions merely use these points to win support for elections{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Taiwan|China}}\n* [[Sinocentrism]]\n* [[Sinicization]]\n* [[Desinicization]]\n* [[Taiwanese literature movement]]\n* [[Taiwanese people]]\n* [[Formosa Alliance]]\n* [[Tangwai movement]]\n* [[Taiwanese literature movement]]\n* [[Taiwan independence movement]]\n* [[Formosa Alliance]]\n* [[Taiwanese people]]\n* [[History of Taiwan]]\n* [[February 28 Incident]]\n* [[Qiandao Lake Incident]]\n* [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis]]\n* [[Seediq Bale]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n2.
