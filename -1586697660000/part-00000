Classified as a [[new religious movement]], its practitioners harken back to the [[Slavic paganism|historical belief systems]] of the [[Slavs|Slavic peoples]] of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]. \"Rodnovery\" is a widely accepted self-descriptor within the community, although there are Rodnover organisations which further characterise the religion as [[Vedism]], [[Orthodoxy]], and [[Old Believers|Old Belief]].\n\n<!--Slavic Native Faith beliefs and practices-->  \nRodnovers typically regard their religion as a faithful continuation of ancient beliefs that survived as folk religion or as conscious \"double belief\" following the [[Christianisation of the Slavs]] in the Middle Ages.{{refn|group=note|The idea that indigenous Slavic religion was preserved in a conscious \"double belief\" following the Christianisation of the Slavs is put into question by some contemporary scholars.}} Rodnovery draws upon surviving historical and archaeological sources, folk religion and also non-Slavic sources such as [[Hinduism]] (as they are believed to be coming from the same Indo-European source). [[Slavic Native Faith's theology and cosmology|Rodnover theology and cosmology]] may be described as [[pantheism]] and [[polytheism]]\u2014worship of the supreme God of the universe and of the multiple gods, ancestors and spirits of nature identified through Slavic culture. Adherents usually meet together in groups to conduct religious ceremonies. These typically entail the invocation of gods, sacrifices and the pouring of libations, dances and a communal meal.\n\n<!--Slavic Native Faith views on morality and Slavic identity-->  \nRodnover ethical thinking emphasises the good of the collective over the rights of the individual. The religion is [[patriarchy|patriarchal]], and attitudes towards sex and gender are generally conservative.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Rodnovery has developed distinctive strains of [[Slavic Native Faith's identity and political philosophy|political and identitary philosophy]]. Rodnover organisations often characterise themselves as [[ethnic religion]]s, emphasising that the religion is bound to Slavic ethnicity. This often manifests as [[ethnic nationalism]], opposition to [[miscegenation]] and the belief in the fundamental difference of racial groups. Rodnovers often glorify Slavic history, criticising the impact of Christianity in Slavic countries and arguing that these nations will play a central role in the world's future. Rodnovers share a strong feeling that their religion represents a paradigmatic shift which will overcome [[Slavic Native Faith and mono-ideologies|the mental constraints imposed through feudalism and the continuation of what they call \"mono-ideologies\"]].\n\n<!--History of the movement--> \nThe contemporary organised Rodnovery movement arose from a multiplicity of sources and charismatic leaders just at the brink of the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and spread rapidly by the mid-1990s and the 2000s. Antecedents are to be found in late 18th- and 19th-century Slavic [[Romanticism]], which glorified the pre-Christian beliefs of Slavic societies. Active religious practitioners devoted to establishing Slavic Native Faith appeared in Poland and Ukraine in the 1930s and 1940s. Following the [[Second World War]] and the establishment of [[communist state]]s throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]], new variants were established by Slavic emigrants living in Western countries, being later introduced in Central and Eastern European countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

A. E. Musin, an academic and deacon of the Russian Orthodox Church published an article about the \"problem of double belief\" as recently as 1991. In this article he divides scholars between those who say that Russian Orthodoxy adapted to entrenched indigenous faith, continuing the Soviet idea of an \"undefeated paganism\", and those who say that Russian Orthodoxy is an out-and-out syncretic religion.{{sfn|Rock|2007|p=110}} Slavic Native Faith adherents, as far as they are concerned, believe that they can take traditional folk culture, remove the obviously Christian elements and be left with something that authentically reflects the historical beliefs of the Slavic peoples.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=134}}\n\nIvakhiv says that despite the intense efforts of Christian authorities, the Christianisation of the Slavs, and especially of Russians, was very slow and resulted in a \"thorough synthesis of Pagan and Christian elements\", reflected for instance in the refashioning of gods as Christian saints ([[Perun]] as [[Elijah|Saint Elias]], [[Veles (god)|Veles]] as [[Saint Blaise|Saint Blasius]] and [[Yarilo]] as [[Saint George]]) and in the overlapping of Christian festivals on Pagan ones.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|pp=212\u2013214}} The scholar of Russian folk religion Linda J.

The shared underpinning is a [[pantheism|pantheistic]] view that is [[holism|holistic]] in its understanding of the universe.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=102}} Similarly to the ancient Slavic religion, a common theological stance among Rodnovers is that of [[monism]], by which the many different gods (polytheism) are seen as manifestations of the single, universal God\u2014generally identified by the concept of ''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]'',{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}} also known as ''Sud'' (\"Judge\") and ''Prabog'' (\"Pre-God\", \"First God\") among [[South Slavs]].{{sfn|Mathieu-Colas|2017}} In the Russian and Ukrainian centres of Rodnover theology, the concept of Rod has been emphasised as particularly important.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|p=142}}\n\nThe root *''rod'' is attested in sources about pre-Christian religion referring to divinity and ancestrality.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=288}} Mathieu-Colas defines Rod as the \"primordial God\", but the term also literally means the generative power of family and \"kin\", \"birth\", \"origin\" and \"fate\" as well.{{sfn|Mathieu-Colas|2017}} Its negative form, ''urod'', means something wrenched, deformed, degenerated, monstrous.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}} Sometimes, the meaning of the word is left deliberately obscure among Rodnovers, allowing for a variety of different interpretations.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}} Cosmologically speaking, Rod is conceived as the spring of universal [[emanationism|emanation]], which articulates in a cosmic hierarchy of gods; Rod expresses itself as ''Prav'' (literally \"Right\" or \"Order\"; cf. Greek ''[[Orthotes]]'', Sanskrit ''[[\u1e5ata]]'') in primordial undeterminacy ([[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]), through a dual dynamism, represented by [[Belobog]] (\"White God\") and [[Chernobog]] (\"Black God\"), the forces of waxing and waning, and then giving rise to the world in its three qualities, ''[[Prav-Yav-Nav]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Rabotkina|1y=2013|1p=240|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=1998|2p=8, note 35}} [[Triglav (mythology)|Triglav]] (\"Three-Headed One\") and [[Svetovid]] (\"Worldseer\") are concepts representing the ''[[axis mundi]]'' and, respectively, the three qualities of reality and their realisation in the four dimensions of space.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|loc=''passim''}}\n\nWhen emphasising this monism, Rodnovers may define themselves as ''rodnianin'', \"believers in God\"{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=269}} (or \"in nativity\", \"in genuinity\"). Already the pioneering Ukrainian leader Shaian argued that God manifests as a variety of different deities.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=130}} This theological explanation is called \"manifestationism\" by some contemporary Rodnovers and implies the idea of a spirit\u2013matter continuum; the different gods, who proceed from the supreme God, generate differing categories of things not as their external creations (as objects), but embodying themselves as these entities. In their view, beings are the progeny of gods; even phenomena such as the thunder are conceived in this way as embodiments of these gods (in this case, [[Perun]]).{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=66}} In the wake of this theology, it is common among Slavic Native Faith practitioners to say that \"we are not God's slaves, but God's sons\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}} Some Rodnover groups espouse the idea that specific Slavic populations are the sons of peculiar facets of God; for instance, groups who rely upon the tenth-century manuscript ''The Lay of Igor's Host'' may affirm the idea that Russians are the grandchildren of [[Dazhbog]] (the \"Giving God\", \"Day God\").{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}\n\nPantheons of deities are not unified among practitioners of Slavic Native Faith.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|pp=289\u2013290}} Different Rodnover groups often have a preference for a particular deity over others.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=290}} The Union of Russian Rodnover Communities founded and led by Vadim Kazakov recognises a pantheon of over thirty deities emanated by the supreme Rod;<ref name=\"Adversus paganos\">{{cite magazine |last1=Belov |first1=Maxim |last2=Garanov |first2=Yuri |date=10 February 2015 |title=Adversus Paganos |publisher=Journal of the Ascension Cathedral of Astrakhan |website=astrsobor.ru |url=http://astrsobor.ru/adversus-paganos-novaya-istoriya-protiv-yazychnikov/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523191143/http://astrsobor.ru/adversus-paganos-novaya-istoriya-protiv-yazychnikov/ |archive-date=23 May 2017 |access-date=7 July 2017}}</ref> these include attested deities from Slavic pre-Christian and folk traditions, Slavicised Hindu deities (such as ''Vyshen'', i.e. [[Vishnu]], and ''Intra'', i.e. [[Indra]]), Iranian deities (such as [[Simargl]] and Khors), deities from the ''Book of Veles'' (such as Pchelich) and figures from Slavic folk tales such as the wizard [[Koschei]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=95}} Another Russian Rodnover leader, Nikolai Speransky (''[[volkhv]]'' Velimir), emphasises a [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] eternal struggle between forces of [[good and evil]]; the former represented by Belobog, who created the human soul, and the latter by Chernobog, who created the human body.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=93}} Rodnovers also believe and worship [[tutelary deity|tutelary deities]] of specific elements, lands and environments,{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=204}} such as waters, forests and the household.

Although some Rodnovers believe in an afterlife, ''[[Vyraj|Iriy]]'' or ''Vyriy'', they argue that retribution is not deferred to such future; since gods manifest themselves as the natural phenomena, and in people as lineage descendants, Rodnovers believe that actions and their outcomes unfold and are to be dealt with in the present world.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=188}} People are viewed as having unique responsibilities towards their own contexts: for instance, the right of parents is to take care of their children, the right of ancestors is to be honoured, and the land deserves to be recked and cultivated.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=79}} Rodnovers blame Christianity for transferring personal responsibility into a transcendent future, when actions will be judged by God and people either smitten or forgiven for their sins, in fact exempting people from responsibility.

Aitamurto summarised these views as: patriarchy, solidarity and homogeneity, with the latter two seen as intrinsically related.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} Shnirelman observed that Rodnovers' calls for social justice tend to apply only to their own perceived ethnic community.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} There have been difficulties with Rodnover involvement in the wider environmentalist movement as a result of many environmentalists' unease with the racial and anti-Christian themes that are prominent in the religion.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=121}}\n\nWithin Rodnovery, gender roles are generally conservative.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Rodnovers often subscribe to the view that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their tasks also differ.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Men are seen as innately disposed towards \"public\" life and abstract thought, while women are seen as better realising themselves in the \"private\" administration of the family and the resources of the house.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=86}} Rodnovers therefore reinforce traditional values in Slavic countries rather than being [[counterculture|countercultural]], presenting themselves as a stabilising and responsible social force. They may even view their upholding of social traditionalism as a counterculture in itself, standing in the face of [[modernism]] and [[globalism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=161}}\n\nIdeas and practices perceived as coming from Western liberal society\u2014which Rodnovers perceive as degenerate\u2014are denounced as threats to Slavic culture; for instance, alcohol and drug consumption, various sexual behaviours and [[miscegenation]] are commonly rejected by Rodnovers, while they emphasise healthy family life in harmonious environments.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=88}} Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that \"hardly any women\" in Russian Rodnovery would call themselves [[feminism|feminists]], partly due to Rodnover beliefs on gender and partly due to the negative associations that the word \"feminism\" has in Russian culture.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} In adopting such a conservative stance to sexual ethics, practitioners of Rodnovery can adopt [[misogyny|misogynistic]] and [[homophobia|homophobic]] attitudes.{{sfn|Dost\u00e1lov\u00e1|2013|p=178}} Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that it would be \"difficult to imagine that any Rodnover community would accept members who are openly homosexual\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Many groups in both Russia and Ukraine critique mixed-race unions;{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2013|1pp=72\u201373|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2017|2p=98|3a1=Lesiv|3y=2017|3p=143}} for instance, the [[Ynglist Church]]'s doctrine articulates a condemnation of race mixing as unhealthy.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=88}}\n\nThe Russian-based Circle of Pagan Tradition distinguishes itself for its more accommodating positions\u2014compared to those of other organisations\u2014about the coexistence of different lifestyles, holding that tolerance should be a key value.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} They reflect their stance in the slogan \"unity in diversity\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} This organisation has also placed greater emphasis on environmentalist issues over nationalist ones, and has called on its members to vote for the [[Green Russia]] party.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=202}}\n\n==Identity and political philosophy==\n{{Main|Slavic Native Faith's identity and political philosophy}}\n[[File:Slavic europe.svg|thumb|upright|Map of countries in Central and Eastern Europe where Slavic languages predominate.

For instance, the Association of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSIDU RUNVira), one of the churches of the Ukrainian [[Sylenkoite]] branch of Rodnovery, holds unique weekly \"Holy Hour of Self-Realisation\", in which practitioners read from Sylenko's ''Maha Vira'', sermons are given, the ancestors are commemorated, and prayers and hymns are given.

Another term for a community, though not frequently used, is ''artel''.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} A form of organisation of Rodnover communities consists in the establishment of places for common living, such as fortresses (''[[kremlin]]'') or citadels (''gorodok''), in which temples are umbegone by buildings for various social uses.

Ceremonial accuracy is often considered essential for the efficacy of a ritual. Nevertheless, Rodnover rituals may be regarded as flexible frameworks, wherein there is room for elaboration and experimentation. The sources that Rodnovers rely upon are valued scholars like [[Vladimir Dal]] and [[Boris Rybakov]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}}\n\nThe common Rodnover ritual calendar is based on the Slavic folk tradition, whose crucial events are the four [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es set in the four phases of the year.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}} Slavic Native Faith has been described as following \"the cycles of nature\".{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=109}} A festival that is believed to be the most important by many Rodnovers is that of the summer solstice, the [[Kupala Night|''Kupala'' Night]] (June 23\u201324), although also important are the winter solstice festival ''Karachun'' and ''[[Koliada]]'' (December 24\u201325), and the spring equinox festival Shrovetide\u2014called ''Komoeditsa'' or ''[[Maslenitsa]]'' (March 24). Festivals celebrated in spring include the Day of Yarilo and the ''Krasnaya Gorka'' (literally \"Red Hill\", celebrated between April 30\u2013May 1), the latter dedicated to ancestor worship; while in autumn Rodnovers celebrate the Day of [[Marzanna]] and that of Mokosh (November 10). Other festivals include the Days of Veles (multiple, in January and February) and the Day of Perun (August 2), the latter considered to be the most important holiday of the year by some Rodnover organisations.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}}\n\nUsually, the organisation of festivals involves three layers of society: there is a patronising \"core\" of practitioners, who are often professionally affirmed people, usually belonging to the intellectual class; then there is the population of committed adherents; and then there is a loose \"periphery\" constituted by sympathisers, generally relatives and friends of the committed followers. Aitmurto notes that festivals are usually set in the evenings, the weekends and on public holidays, in order to allow everyone's participation.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=64}} Shizhenskii and Aitamurto described one Kupala festival, held over the course of three days outside [[Maloyaroslavets]] in Russia; at this event, weddings, purification rituals, and name-giving ceremonies took place, accompanied by musical performances, martial arts, and folkloric plays, while a market sold traditional handicrafts.{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=120}} The interplay with the gods and the cycle of nature which they represent is displayed through large-scale ceremonies which Aitamurto defines as \"aesthetically lavish\", vectors of a great deal of creativity. For instance, the end of winter is marked by burning straw images of Marzanna, the goddess of winter, while celebrating the victory of Yarilo, the god of the full swing of natural forces; the end of summer, instead, is marked by the burial of an image of Yarilo.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=69}}\n\nSome Slavic Native Faith organisations have appropriated or reappropriated Christian festivals.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138\u2013139}} The same Kupala Night is a reappropriation, being the day of the year when Christian churches set the [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138\u2013139}} The calendar of one of the organisations of the [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] includes holidays that have been de-Christianised, such as a \"Christmas of Dazhboh's Light\" and an \"Easter of the Eternal Resurrection\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=228}} The common Rodnover calendar leaves room for national and regional variations; for instance, the same Native Ukrainian National Faith's organisation observes holidays devoted to Ukrainian national heroes such as Shevchenko, [[Ivan Franko]], [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], and [[Hryhory Skovoroda]], as well as those devoted to more abstract concepts such as \"Ukrainian Ancient Literature\" and \"New Ukrainian Literature\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=28}}\n\n===Artistic and other pursuits===\n[[File:Festival Ringing Cedars 2014 June 22 \u0418\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 60.jpg|thumb|Russian Rodnovers engaged in a martial arts dare.]]\n\nA number of Rodnovers have expressed their religion through visual arts; among practitioners, [[Svyatoslav I of Kiev]] is one of the most popular subjects.<ref name=Gizbrekht2016>{{cite article |last=Gizbrekht |first=Andrey Ivanovich |year=2016 |title=\u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u044b \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0434\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \"\u042f\u0437\u044b\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\" (\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430) |trans-title=The images of public figures of Russian history in the discourse of modern \"Pagan art\" (based on fine arts material) |url=https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/obrazy-deyateley-rossiyskoy-istorii-v-diskurse-sovremennogo-yazycheskogo-iskusstva-na-materiale-izobrazitelnogo-tvorchestva |publisher=\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b}} \u0423\u0414\u041a 298.9:7.044/.046.</ref> Rodnover rituals and festivals often include [[martial arts]] displays; these sometimes symbolise seasonal change, such as the victory of spring over winter, or can be regarded as manifestations of bravery, strength, and honesty.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=95}} Slavic-hill wrestling (\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u043e-\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0431\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0431\u0430, ''Slavyano-goritskaya bor'ba'') was established by the Russian Rodnover Aleksandr Belov.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=69}}{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=39}} Other martial arts styles that are popular among Rodnovers are \"bench wrestling\" (''lavochki'') and \"wall against wall\" (''stenka na stenku'').{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=288}}\n\n==History==\nThe origins of Slavic Native Faith have been traced to the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement of late eighteenth and nineteenth-century Europe, which was a reaction against [[rationalism]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=215}} This was accompanied by a growth in [[nationalism]] across Europe, as intellectuals began to assert their own national heritage.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=215}} Whereas calls to re-establish pre-Christian belief systems existed within the German and Austrian far-right nationalist movements during the early twentieth century, the same did not happen in its Russian counterpart.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=285}}\n\n[[File:O S\u0142awia\u0144szczy\u017anie przed chrze\u015bcija\u0144stwem.

In doing so, pre-Christian belief systems underwent a rehabilitation.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|pp=285\u2013286}} Russian Native Faith originated in the [[Soviet dissidents]]' circles of the 1970s.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=185}} An intellectual circle that cultivated themes of Slavic indigenous religion formed as a wing of the predominantly Orthodox Christian [[samizdat]] nationalist journal ''Veche'' (1971\u20131974). Such group included Anatoly Ivanov, the artist [[Konstantin Vasilyev]] (1942\u20131974), and Nikolai Bogdanov, among others. Vasilyev's art is widely celebrated within the Rodnover community. Ivanov, who declared himself a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] and subscribed to \"Arism\" or \"Slavism\", published a fervently anti-Christian pamphlet entitled \"The Christian Plague\" (''Khristianskaya chuma''). Throughout the 1970s, the nationalist dissident movement split into two branches, an Orthodox Christian one and another one that developed [[National Bolshevism]], which eventually continued to harbour Pagan traditionalists.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=26\u201327}} Other influential texts in this period were Valery Yemelyanov's ''Desionizatsiya'' (\"De-Sionisation\") and later Istarkhov's ''Udar russkikh bogov'' (\"The Strike of Russian Gods\").{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=186}}\n\nIn the Soviet Union, Slavic Native Faith groups had to operate in secret, although a few small groups were known to exist in Moscow and Leningrad.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=146}} These groups were closely linked to the nationalistic circles operating during the 1980s.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=146}} In Moscow, an [[occultism|occult]] circle was established by Yevgeny Golovin and Yuri Mamleyev; although not explicitly Pagan, they were influenced by occult Pagan thinkers like [[Guido von List]] and sought a return to a pre-Christian [[Aryan]] world.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=287}} In the early 1980s, the \"[[Pamyat]]\" movement was established by figures active at the Metropolitan Moscow Palace of Culture, which similarly looked with fondness on ancient Aryan culture.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=287}} Several Russian nationalists also began to state that pre-Christian belief systems were the true religion of the Russian people; Apollon Kuzmin did so in his 1988 book ''Padenie Peruna'' (\"The Fall of Perun\").{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=288}} In 1986, Viktor Bezverkhy established the Leningrad ([[Saint Petersburg]])-based Society of the Mages (''Obshchestvo Volkhvov''), an explicitly [[white supremacism|white supremacist]] and anti-Semitic organisation;

they formed the Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSID RUNVira) and secured legal control of the temple in Spring Glen.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=227}} A second group, the Association of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSIDU RUNVira), maintained links with Sylenko himself, whom it regards as a prophet, and adopted his ''Maha Vira'' as a sacred text.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} Despite the animosity that existed between these rival Ukrainian groups, there was some collaboration between them.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=232}} In 2003, the First Forum of Rodnovers was held in the country, resulting in two public proclamations: the first urged the country's government to protect what the Rodnovers regarded as sacred sites and objects, and the second called on the government not to go ahead with the proposed privatisation of agricultural land.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=232}} That same year, a group called Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith was established;

By his own words: \"God's grace came upon me, and following the will of God I have proclaimed a new understanding of God\". According to believers, he acquired this knowledge through \"breath of his ancestors\" being united with them \"by divine holiness\".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=134}} The Federation of Ukrainian Rodnovers, which directly inherits Volodymyr Shaian's Orthodoxy, in the person of its leader Halyna Lozko has advanced vehement critiques of Sylenkoism, calling Lev Sylenko a \"false prophet\" and accusing him of trying to lead Ukrainians in the \"quagmire of cosmopolitan monotheism\", the \"fruit of Judaic religions which aim for global world domination\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=22}}\n\n====Yagnovery, Ladovery, and Orantism====\nYagnovery (Ukrainian: \u042f\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0440\u0430), Ladovery (\u041b\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0440\u0430) and Orantism (\u041e\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0437\u043c) are branches of Rodnovery that are present in Ukraine.{{sfn|Rabotkina|2013|p=238}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kutuzova |first=N.

According to the movement, which presents itself as the true, Orthodox, olden religion of the Russians, Yngly is the fiery order of reality through which the supreme God\u2014called by the name \"Ramha\" in Ynglist theology\u2014ongoingly generates the universe. They believe that \"[[Yngling]]\", a name that identifies the earliest royal dynasties of [[Scandinavia]], means \"offspring of Yngly\", and that the historical Ynglings migrated to Scandinavia from the region of Omsk, which was a spiritual centre of the early [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]]. They hold that the ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'' of the [[Edda]] (itself composed by [[Snorri Sturluson]] on the basis of an older ''[[Ynglingatal]]''), proves their ideas about the origins of the Ynglings in Omsk and is ultimately a more recent version of texts contained in their own sacred books, the ''Slavo-Aryan Vedas''.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nThe spiritual academy of the Ynglist Church teaches their Vedas, \"Aryan mathematics\" and grammar, and health techniques.

Ynglists organise yearly gatherings (''veche'') in summer.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=51}}\n\nThe Ynglist Church was prosecuted in the early 2000s for [[ethnic hatred]] according to Russian laws, and its headquarters in Omsk were liquidated.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=51}} Despite this, it continues to operate as an unregistered religious phenomenon represented by a multiplicity of communities. Ynglism meets widespread disapproval within mainstream Rodnovery, and the international ''veche'' has declared it a false religion. Nevertheless, according to Aitamurto (2016), on the basis of the amount of literature that Ynglists publish and the presence of their representatives at various Rodnover conferences, is clear that Ynglism has a \"substantial number of followers\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=51}}\n\n====Ringing Cedars' Anastasianism====\n{{Main|Ringing Cedars' Anastasianism}}\n\nThe Ringing Cedars (Russian: \u0417\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u041a\u0435\u0434\u0440\u044b) or Anastasianism is a spiritual movement that overlaps with Rodnovery. The Ringing Cedars' movement arises from the writings of [[Vladimir Megre]] (Puzakov), codified in a series of ten books, whose teachings are attributed to an [[archetype|archetypal]] Siberian wise woman known as Anastasia.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=52}} These books teach what Rasa Pranskevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 has defined as a \"cosmological pantheism\",{{sfn|Pranskevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117|2015|p=446}} in which nature is the manifested \"thought of God\" and human thought has the power to commune with him and to actively participate in his creation.{{sfn|Pranskevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117|2015|pp=450\u2013451}}\n\nAnastasians have established rural villages all over Russia, \"kinship homesteads\" (\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c\u0435, ''rodovoye pomest'ye''), where they conduct a harmonious life in at least a hectare of land. The name \"Ringing Cedars\" derives from the beliefs held by Anastasians about the spiritual qualities of the [[Pinus sibirica|Siberian cedar]]. In his writings, Megre identifies the ideal society which the Ringing Cedars' movement aims at establishing as \"Vedic\", and many of his teachings are identical to those of other movements of Rodnovery.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=52\u201353}}\n\n====Tezaurus' Authentism====\n{{Main|Authentism}}\n\nAuthentism (Russian: \u0410\u0443\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0437\u043c), incorporated as the \"Tezaurus Spiritual Union\" (\u0414\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437 \"\u0422\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0443\u0440\u0443\u0441\"), is a Rodnover spiritual philosophy and psychological order created by the psychologist Sergey Petrovich Semenov in 1984, in Saint Petersburg. The movement is based on the teachings of the ''Russian Veda'', considered an expression of Slavic paganism, Russian cosmism and [[psychoanalysis]]. The aim of the Authentist philosophical practice is to reveal one's own true spiritual essence, which is identical with God, [[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]\u2014which is viewed as the complementary unity of [[Belobog]]/[[Svetovid|Sventovid]] and [[Chernobog]]/[[Veles (god)|Veles]]\u2014and therefore the unity of mankind and God, which characterises Russia's special mission opposed to Western individualism.{{sfn|Popov|2016|loc=\u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0438 / New Russian religions}}\n\n==Demographics==\n===Eastern Slavic nations===\n\n====Russia====\n{{main|Slavic Native Faith in Russia}}\n[[File:Festival Ringing Cedars 2014 June 22 \u0414\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043d 06.jpg|thumb|Group of Ringing Cedars' Rodnovers in Russia.]]\n\nWriting in 2000, Shnirelman noted that Rodnovery was \"growing rapidly\" within the Russian Federation.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=18}} In 2016, Aitamurto noted that there was \"no reliable information\" on the number of Rodnovers in Russia, but that it was \"plausible\" that there were \"several tens of thousands\" of practitioners active in the country.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=63}} This was partly because there were several Rodnover groups active on the social network [[VK (social networking)|VK]] which had over 10,000 members.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=63}} Estimates from some research institutes, often reported by Russian Orthodox Church organs, put the number of Native Faith practitioners in the few millions.<ref name=\"Adversus paganos\"/>\n\nAitamurto observed that a \"substantial number\" of adherents\u2014and in particular those who had been among the earliest\u2014belonged to the \"technical intelligentsia\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=64}} Similarly, Shnirelman noted that the founders of Russian Rodnovery were \"well-educated urbanised intellectuals\" who had become frustrated with \"cosmopolitan urban culture\".{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=88}} [[Physics|Physicists]] were particularly well represented; in this Aitamurto drew comparisons to the high number of computer professionals who were present in the Pagan communities of Western countries.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=64}} The movement also involved a significant number of people who had a background in the Soviet or Russian Army,{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1a2=Gaidukov|1y=2013|1p=147|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2013|2p=73}} or in policing and security.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=73}} The \"vast majority\" of Russian Rodnovers were young and there were a greater proportion of men than women.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=64}} A questionnaire distributed at the Kupala festival in Maloyaroslavets suggested that Rodnovers typically had above-average levels of education, with a substantial portion working as business owners or managers.{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=121}} A high proportion were also involved in specialist professions such as engineering, academia, or information technology, and the majority lived in cities.{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nThe historian [[Marlene Laruelle]] suggested that Rodnovery was likely to remain a marginalised religion in comparison to Russian Orthodoxy, but that its main significance for Russian society had been by diffusing \"historical themes\"\u2014particularly regarding an ancient Aryan race\u2014to a far wider audience, including many who were Orthodox or non-religious.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=298}} A number of youth subcultures have been identified as introducing people to Rodnovery, among them heavy metal, historical re-enactment, and the admirers of [[J.

Classified as a [[new religious movement]], its practitioners harken back to the [[Slavic paganism|historical belief systems]] of the [[Slavs|Slavic peoples]] of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]. \"Rodnovery\" is a widely accepted self-descriptor within the community, although there are Rodnover organisations which further characterise the religion as [[Vedism]], [[Orthodoxy]], and [[Old Believers|Old Belief]].\n\n<!--Slavic Native Faith beliefs and practices-->  \nRodnovers typically regard their religion as a faithful continuation of ancient beliefs that survived as folk religion or as conscious \"double belief\" following the [[Christianisation of the Slavs]] in the Middle Ages.{{refn|group=note|The idea that indigenous Slavic religion was preserved in a conscious \"double belief\" following the Christianisation of the Slavs is put into question by some contemporary scholars.}} Rodnovery draws upon surviving historical and archaeological sources, folk religion and also non-Slavic sources such as [[Hinduism]] (as they are believed to be coming from the same Indo-European source). [[Slavic Native Faith's theology and cosmology|Rodnover theology and cosmology]] may be described as [[pantheism]] and [[polytheism]]\u2014worship of the supreme God of the universe and of the multiple gods, ancestors and spirits of nature identified through Slavic culture. Adherents usually meet together in groups to conduct religious ceremonies. These typically entail the invocation of gods, sacrifices and the pouring of libations, dances and a communal meal.\n\n<!--Slavic Native Faith views on morality and Slavic identity-->  \nRodnover ethical thinking emphasises the good of the collective over the rights of the individual. The religion is [[patriarchy|patriarchal]], and attitudes towards sex and gender are generally conservative.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Rodnovery has developed distinctive strains of [[Slavic Native Faith's identity and political philosophy|political and identitary philosophy]]. Rodnover organisations often characterise themselves as [[ethnic religion]]s, emphasising that the religion is bound to Slavic ethnicity. This often manifests as [[ethnic nationalism]], opposition to [[miscegenation]] and the belief in the fundamental difference of racial groups. Rodnovers often glorify Slavic history, criticising the impact of Christianity in Slavic countries and arguing that these nations will play a central role in the world's future. Rodnovers share a strong feeling that their religion represents a paradigmatic shift which will overcome [[Slavic Native Faith and mono-ideologies|the mental constraints imposed through feudalism and the continuation of what they call \"mono-ideologies\"]].\n\n<!--History of the movement--> \nThe contemporary organised Rodnovery movement arose from a multiplicity of sources and charismatic leaders just at the brink of the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and spread rapidly by the mid-1990s and the 2000s. Antecedents are to be found in late 18th- and 19th-century Slavic [[Romanticism]], which glorified the pre-Christian beliefs of Slavic societies. Active religious practitioners devoted to establishing Slavic Native Faith appeared in Poland and Ukraine in the 1930s and 1940s. Following the [[Second World War]] and the establishment of [[communist state]]s throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]], new variants were established by Slavic emigrants living in Western countries, being later introduced in Central and Eastern European countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In recent times, the movement has been increasingly [[Pagan studies|studied in academic scholarship]].\n\n==Overview==\n{{See also|Slavic paganism}}\n[[File:Russian Rodnover women.jpg|thumb|Russian Rodnover women with child.]]\n\n[[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] regard Slavic Native Faith as a [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Lesiv|1y=2013a|1pp=6\u20137|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2013|2p=62|3a1=Skrylnikov|3y=2016|4a1=Shizhenskii|4a2=Aitamurto|4y=2017|4p=115}} They also characterise it as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2002|1p=197|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=284|3a1=Dost\u00e1lov\u00e1|3y=2013|3p=165|4a1=Gaidukov|4y=2013|4p=315|5a1=Shnirelman|5y=2013|5pp=62, 73}} The movement has no overarching structure,{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=316}} or accepted religious authority,{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=120}} and contains much diversity in terms of belief and practice.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}} The sociologist of religion Kaarina Aitamurto suggests that Rodnovery is sufficiently heterogeneous that it could be regarded itself not as a singular religion but as \"an umbrella term that gathers together various forms of religiosity\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}}\n\n[[File:Szczodre Gody MIR 1.jpg|thumb|right|A Polish Rodnover outdoors altar.]]\n\nThe scholar of religion Alexey Gaidukov described \"Slavic Neopaganism\" as a term pertaining to \"all quasi-religious, political, ideological and philosophical systems which are based on the reconstruction and construction of pre-Christian Slavic traditions\".{{sfn|Gaidukov|2013|p=316}} The scholar of religion Adrian Ivakhiv describes the religion as a movement which \"harkens back to the pre-Christian beliefs and practices of ancient Slavic peoples\",{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=209}} while according to the historian and ethnologist [[Victor Schnirelmann|Victor A.

Rather, he describes the movement as having been \"built up artificially by urbanised intellectuals who use fragments of early pre-Christian local beliefs and rites in order to restore national spirituality\".{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=19}} In this way, Slavic Native Faith has been understood\u2014at least in part\u2014as an [[invented tradition]],{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=236|2a1=Laruelle|2y=2008|2p=284|3a1=Lesiv|3y=2013b|3p=136}} or a form of ''[[Folklorismus]]''.{{sfn|Radulovic|2017|p=69}} Simpson notes, studying the specific context of Poland, that unlike historical Slavic beliefs, which were integral to the everyday fabric of their society, modern Slavic Native Faith believers have to develop new forms of social organisation which set them apart from established society.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=113}} Textual evidence for historical Slavic religion is scant, has been produced by Christian writers hostile to the systems being described and is usually open to multiple interpretations.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=89}}\n\nIn developing Slavic Native Faith, practitioners draw upon the primary sources about the historical religion of Slavic peoples, as well as elements drawn from later Slavic folklore, official and popular Christian belief and from non-Slavic societies.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=128}} Among these foreign influences have been beliefs and practices drawn from [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Germanic Heathenry]],{{sfnm|1a1=Laruelle|1y=2008|1p=289|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2017|2p=90}} [[Siberian shamanism]],{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=32}} as well as ideas drawn from various forms of [[Western esotericism|esotericism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2017|1p=88|2a1=Radulovic|2y=2017|2p=71}} Other influences include documents like the ''[[Book of Veles]]'', which claim to be genuine accounts of historical Slavic religion but which academics recognise as later compositions.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=90}} According to the folklorist Mariya Lesiv, through this syncretic process, \"a ''new'' religion is being created on the basis of the synthesis of elements from various traditions\".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=14}} Many Rodnovers do not acknowledge this practice of [[syncretism]] and instead profess an explicitly anti-syncretic attitude, emphasising the need to retain the \"purity\" of the religion and thus maintain its \"authenticity\".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=141}}\n\n===Slavic folk religion and double belief===\n[[File:\u0418\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0446\u044b \u00ab\u041e\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u00bb .jpg|thumb|''The Fiery Chariot of the Word''\u201419th-century [[Russian icon]] of the ''[[Theotokos]]'' as [[Ognyena Maria]] (\"Fiery Mary\"), fire goddess sister of [[Perun]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Rou\u010dek |editor-first=Joseph Slabey |title=Ognyena Maria |encyclopedia=Slavonic Encyclopedia |year=1949 |publisher=Philosophical Library |location=New York}} p. 905</ref> Belief in a [[mother goddess]] as the receptacle of life, [[Mat Syra Zemlya]] (\"Damp Mother Earth\"), was preserved in Russian folk religion up to the 20th century, often disguised as the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] of Christianity.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|pp=15, 16}} The fiery \"six-petaled roses\" that umbego the Ognyena are one of the variants of the whirling symbol of the supreme God (Rod) and of its sons.{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|p=17}}]]\n\nA different perspective is offered by [[Svetlana Chervonnaya]], who sees the return to folk beliefs among Slavs as part of a broader phenomenon that is happening to \"the mass religious mind\" not merely of Slavic or Eastern European peoples, but to peoples all over [[Asia]], and that expresses itself in new mythologemes endorsed by national elites.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Alybyna |first=Tatiana |year=2014 |title=Vernacular Beliefs and Official Traditional Religion |url=https://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/134723/AR_Alybina.pdf?sequence=2 |journal=Approaching Religion |volume=4 |number=1 |pages=89\u2013100 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707181157/https://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/134723/AR_Alybina.pdf?sequence=2 |archive-date=7 July 2017}} Cites: Chervonnaya, Svetlana (1998).

A. E. Musin, an academic and deacon of the Russian Orthodox Church published an article about the \"problem of double belief\" as recently as 1991. In this article he divides scholars between those who say that Russian Orthodoxy adapted to entrenched indigenous faith, continuing the Soviet idea of an \"undefeated paganism\", and those who say that Russian Orthodoxy is an out-and-out syncretic religion.{{sfn|Rock|2007|p=110}} Slavic Native Faith adherents, as far as they are concerned, believe that they can take traditional folk culture, remove the obviously Christian elements and be left with something that authentically reflects the historical beliefs of the Slavic peoples.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=134}}\n\nIvakhiv says that despite the intense efforts of Christian authorities, the Christianisation of the Slavs, and especially of Russians, was very slow and resulted in a \"thorough synthesis of Pagan and Christian elements\", reflected for instance in the refashioning of gods as Christian saints ([[Perun]] as [[Elijah|Saint Elias]], [[Veles (god)|Veles]] as [[Saint Blaise|Saint Blasius]] and [[Yarilo]] as [[Saint George]]) and in the overlapping of Christian festivals on Pagan ones.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|pp=212\u2013214}} The scholar of Russian folk religion Linda J.

Greek ''[[Orthotes]]'', Sanskrit ''[[\u1e5ata]]'') in primordial undeterminacy ([[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]), through a dual dynamism, represented by [[Belobog]] (\"White God\") and [[Chernobog]] (\"Black God\"), the forces of waxing and waning, and then giving rise to the world in its three qualities, ''[[Prav-Yav-Nav]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Rabotkina|1y=2013|1p=240|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=1998|2p=8, note 35}} [[Triglav (mythology)|Triglav]] (\"Three-Headed One\") and [[Svetovid]] (\"Worldseer\") are concepts representing the ''[[axis mundi]]'' and, respectively, the three qualities of reality and their realisation in the four dimensions of space.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|loc=''passim''}}\n\nWhen emphasising this monism, Rodnovers may define themselves as ''rodnianin'', \"believers in God\"{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=269}} (or \"in nativity\", \"in genuinity\"). Already the pioneering Ukrainian leader Shaian argued that God manifests as a variety of different deities.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=130}} This theological explanation is called \"manifestationism\" by some contemporary Rodnovers and implies the idea of a spirit\u2013matter continuum; the different gods, who proceed from the supreme God, generate differing categories of things not as their external creations (as objects), but embodying themselves as these entities. In their view, beings are the progeny of gods; even phenomena such as the thunder are conceived in this way as embodiments of these gods (in this case, [[Perun]]).{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=66}} In the wake of this theology, it is common among Slavic Native Faith practitioners to say that \"we are not God's slaves, but God's sons\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}} Some Rodnover groups espouse the idea that specific Slavic populations are the sons of peculiar facets of God; for instance, groups who rely upon the tenth-century manuscript ''The Lay of Igor's Host'' may affirm the idea that Russians are the grandchildren of [[Dazhbog]] (the \"Giving God\", \"Day God\").{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}\n\nPantheons of deities are not unified among practitioners of Slavic Native Faith.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|pp=289\u2013290}} Different Rodnover groups often have a preference for a particular deity over others.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=290}} The Union of Russian Rodnover Communities founded and led by Vadim Kazakov recognises a pantheon of over thirty deities emanated by the supreme Rod;<ref name=\"Adversus paganos\">{{cite magazine |last1=Belov |first1=Maxim |last2=Garanov |first2=Yuri |date=10 February 2015 |title=Adversus Paganos |publisher=Journal of the Ascension Cathedral of Astrakhan |website=astrsobor.ru |url=http://astrsobor.ru/adversus-paganos-novaya-istoriya-protiv-yazychnikov/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523191143/http://astrsobor.ru/adversus-paganos-novaya-istoriya-protiv-yazychnikov/ |archive-date=23 May 2017 |access-date=7 July 2017}}</ref> these include attested deities from Slavic pre-Christian and folk traditions, Slavicised Hindu deities (such as ''Vyshen'', i.e. [[Vishnu]], and ''Intra'', i.e. [[Indra]]), Iranian deities (such as [[Simargl]] and Khors), deities from the ''Book of Veles'' (such as Pchelich) and figures from Slavic folk tales such as the wizard [[Koschei]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=95}} Another Russian Rodnover leader, Nikolai Speransky (''[[volkhv]]'' Velimir), emphasises a [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] eternal struggle between forces of [[good and evil]]; the former represented by Belobog, who created the human soul, and the latter by Chernobog, who created the human body.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=93}} Rodnovers also believe and worship [[tutelary deity|tutelary deities]] of specific elements, lands and environments,{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=204}} such as waters, forests and the household.

Although some Rodnovers believe in an afterlife, ''[[Vyraj|Iriy]]'' or ''Vyriy'', they argue that retribution is not deferred to such future; since gods manifest themselves as the natural phenomena, and in people as lineage descendants, Rodnovers believe that actions and their outcomes unfold and are to be dealt with in the present world.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=188}} People are viewed as having unique responsibilities towards their own contexts: for instance, the right of parents is to take care of their children, the right of ancestors is to be honoured, and the land deserves to be recked and cultivated.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=79}} Rodnovers blame Christianity for transferring personal responsibility into a transcendent future, when actions will be judged by God and people either smitten or forgiven for their sins, in fact exempting people from responsibility. According to Rodnovers, justice and truth have to be realised in this life, so that \"[[turning the other cheek]]\", waiving agency and intervention in the things of this world, is considered immoral and equivalent to welcoming wrongness.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=96}} In other words, fleeing from the commitment towards the forces at play in the present context is the same as denying the gods; it disrupts morality, impairing the individual, society and the world itself.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=79}}\n\n[[File:Rodnover wedding in Russia.jpg|thumb|left|Rodnover wedding ceremony.]]\n\nRodnovers value individual responsibility as the cornerstone for the further maturation of humanity, equating the conversion to Rodnovery with such maturation.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=142}} This emphasis on individuality is not at odds with the value of solidarity, since collective responsibility is seen as arising from the union of the right free decisions of reflexive individuals. By using terms of [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], Aitamurto says that what Rodnovers reject is \"egoistic individualism\", not \"moral individualism\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=116}} Immediately related to the morality of a responsible community is the respect for the natural world in general, or what Aitamurto defines \"ecological responsibility\".{{sfnm|1a1=Aitamurto|1y=2016|1p=138|2a1=Simpson|2y=2013|2p=120}}\n\nRodnover ethics deal with a wide range of contemporary social issues.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2000|p=18}} Through the categories of contemporary sociology, Rodnover views are generally defined [[conservatism|conservative]]. Aitamurto summarised these views as: patriarchy, solidarity and homogeneity, with the latter two seen as intrinsically related.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} Shnirelman observed that Rodnovers' calls for social justice tend to apply only to their own perceived ethnic community.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=72}} There have been difficulties with Rodnover involvement in the wider environmentalist movement as a result of many environmentalists' unease with the racial and anti-Christian themes that are prominent in the religion.{{sfn|Simpson|2013|p=121}}\n\nWithin Rodnovery, gender roles are generally conservative.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Rodnovers often subscribe to the view that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their tasks also differ.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Men are seen as innately disposed towards \"public\" life and abstract thought, while women are seen as better realising themselves in the \"private\" administration of the family and the resources of the house.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=86}} Rodnovers therefore reinforce traditional values in Slavic countries rather than being [[counterculture|countercultural]], presenting themselves as a stabilising and responsible social force. They may even view their upholding of social traditionalism as a counterculture in itself, standing in the face of [[modernism]] and [[globalism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=161}}\n\nIdeas and practices perceived as coming from Western liberal society\u2014which Rodnovers perceive as degenerate\u2014are denounced as threats to Slavic culture; for instance, alcohol and drug consumption, various sexual behaviours and [[miscegenation]] are commonly rejected by Rodnovers, while they emphasise healthy family life in harmonious environments.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=88}} Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that \"hardly any women\" in Russian Rodnovery would call themselves [[feminism|feminists]], partly due to Rodnover beliefs on gender and partly due to the negative associations that the word \"feminism\" has in Russian culture.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} In adopting such a conservative stance to sexual ethics, practitioners of Rodnovery can adopt [[misogyny|misogynistic]] and [[homophobia|homophobic]] attitudes.{{sfn|Dost\u00e1lov\u00e1|2013|p=178}} Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that it would be \"difficult to imagine that any Rodnover community would accept members who are openly homosexual\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=152}} Many groups in both Russia and Ukraine critique mixed-race unions;{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2013|1pp=72\u201373|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2017|2p=98|3a1=Lesiv|3y=2017|3p=143}} for instance, the [[Ynglist Church]]'s doctrine articulates a condemnation of race mixing as unhealthy.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=88}}\n\nThe Russian-based Circle of Pagan Tradition distinguishes itself for its more accommodating positions\u2014compared to those of other organisations\u2014about the coexistence of different lifestyles, holding that tolerance should be a key value.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} They reflect their stance in the slogan \"unity in diversity\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=201}} This organisation has also placed greater emphasis on environmentalist issues over nationalist ones, and has called on its members to vote for the [[Green Russia]] party.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=202}}\n\n==Identity and political philosophy==\n{{Main|Slavic Native Faith's identity and political philosophy}}\n[[File:Slavic europe.svg|thumb|upright|Map of countries in Central and Eastern Europe where Slavic languages predominate.

Some Rodnover organisations require that participants wear traditional Slavic clothes for such gatherings, although there is much freedom in interpreting what constitutes \"traditional clothes\", this definition generally referring to folkloric needlecraft open to a wide range of artistic patterns.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=70}}{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=290}}\n\nBesides the rites of outgang from Christianity (''raskrestitsia''), Rodnovers practise rituals of initiation of the new members into the community of Slavic Native Faith.

Some groups, such as male brotherhoods, practise the cutting of a second \"life line\" on the palm of the hand of converts, symbolising the new \"blood bond\" that is formed with other members.{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=292}}\n\n===Communities, citadels and temples===\n[[File:\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044c.jpg|thumb|A building of the Slavic Kremlin Vitalya Sundakova in the [[Podolsky District]], Moscow Oblast, Russia.]]\n\nRodnover organisations have inherited ideas of commonality and social governance from Slavic and Russian history.

Aitamurto (2008) characterises the ''veche'' as a model of organisation \"from below and to the top\", following descriptions given by Rodnovers themselves\u2014that is to say a grassroots form of governance which matures into a consensual authority and/or decision-making. Local Rodnover groups usually call themselves ''obshchina'' (the term for traditional peasant communities), while ''skhod'', ''sobor'' and ''mir'' are used for informal meetings or to refer to traditional Russian ideas of commonality. Another term for a community, though not frequently used, is ''artel''.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} A form of organisation of Rodnover communities consists in the establishment of places for common living, such as fortresses (''[[kremlin]]'') or citadels (''gorodok''), in which temples are umbegone by buildings for various social uses.

They are those responsible for holding rites for worshipping the gods and leading communities and religious festivals. Volkhvs are the higher rank of the sacerdotal hierarchy, while zhrets are of a lower authority.{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=272, note 11}}\n\nThough the majority of Rodnover priests are males, Rodnover groups do not exclude women from the priesthood, so that a parallel female priesthood is constituted by the two ranks of ''zhritsa'' and ''vedunya'' (\"seeresses\"). Prestige is not limited to male priests; a priestess, [[Halyna Lozko]] from Ukraine, is an acknowledged authority within the Rodnover movement.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}} In 2012, a number of Rodnover organisations in Russia made an agreement for the mutual recognition of their priesthood and for the uniformisation of ordination policies.{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}}\n\n===Calendars and holidays===\n{{Main|Slavic Native Faith's calendars and holidays}}\n[[File:Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a goddess at Vodokres holiday.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a goddess' pole on Vodokre\u0161 holiday in the countryside.]]\n\nAccording to Aitamurto, rituals play \"a central role in defining, learning and transmitting the religion\", and thus they constitute an important complement to theology within Rodnovery. Ceremonial accuracy is often considered essential for the efficacy of a ritual. Nevertheless, Rodnover rituals may be regarded as flexible frameworks, wherein there is room for elaboration and experimentation. The sources that Rodnovers rely upon are valued scholars like [[Vladimir Dal]] and [[Boris Rybakov]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}}\n\nThe common Rodnover ritual calendar is based on the Slavic folk tradition, whose crucial events are the four [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es set in the four phases of the year.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}} Slavic Native Faith has been described as following \"the cycles of nature\".{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=109}} A festival that is believed to be the most important by many Rodnovers is that of the summer solstice, the [[Kupala Night|''Kupala'' Night]] (June 23\u201324), although also important are the winter solstice festival ''Karachun'' and ''[[Koliada]]'' (December 24\u201325), and the spring equinox festival Shrovetide\u2014called ''Komoeditsa'' or ''[[Maslenitsa]]'' (March 24). Festivals celebrated in spring include the Day of Yarilo and the ''Krasnaya Gorka'' (literally \"Red Hill\", celebrated between April 30\u2013May 1), the latter dedicated to ancestor worship; while in autumn Rodnovers celebrate the Day of [[Marzanna]] and that of Mokosh (November 10). Other festivals include the Days of Veles (multiple, in January and February) and the Day of Perun (August 2), the latter considered to be the most important holiday of the year by some Rodnover organisations.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=67}}\n\nUsually, the organisation of festivals involves three layers of society: there is a patronising \"core\" of practitioners, who are often professionally affirmed people, usually belonging to the intellectual class; then there is the population of committed adherents; and then there is a loose \"periphery\" constituted by sympathisers, generally relatives and friends of the committed followers. Aitmurto notes that festivals are usually set in the evenings, the weekends and on public holidays, in order to allow everyone's participation.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=64}} Shizhenskii and Aitamurto described one Kupala festival, held over the course of three days outside [[Maloyaroslavets]] in Russia; at this event, weddings, purification rituals, and name-giving ceremonies took place, accompanied by musical performances, martial arts, and folkloric plays, while a market sold traditional handicrafts.{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=120}} The interplay with the gods and the cycle of nature which they represent is displayed through large-scale ceremonies which Aitamurto defines as \"aesthetically lavish\", vectors of a great deal of creativity. For instance, the end of winter is marked by burning straw images of Marzanna, the goddess of winter, while celebrating the victory of Yarilo, the god of the full swing of natural forces; the end of summer, instead, is marked by the burial of an image of Yarilo.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=69}}\n\nSome Slavic Native Faith organisations have appropriated or reappropriated Christian festivals.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138\u2013139}} The same Kupala Night is a reappropriation, being the day of the year when Christian churches set the [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist]].{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|pp=138\u2013139}} The calendar of one of the organisations of the [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] includes holidays that have been de-Christianised, such as a \"Christmas of Dazhboh's Light\" and an \"Easter of the Eternal Resurrection\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=228}} The common Rodnover calendar leaves room for national and regional variations; for instance, the same Native Ukrainian National Faith's organisation observes holidays devoted to Ukrainian national heroes such as Shevchenko, [[Ivan Franko]], [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], and [[Hryhory Skovoroda]], as well as those devoted to more abstract concepts such as \"Ukrainian Ancient Literature\" and \"New Ukrainian Literature\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=28}}\n\n===Artistic and other pursuits===\n[[File:Festival Ringing Cedars 2014 June 22 \u0418\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 60.jpg|thumb|Russian Rodnovers engaged in a martial arts dare.]]\n\nA number of Rodnovers have expressed their religion through visual arts; among practitioners, [[Svyatoslav I of Kiev]] is one of the most popular subjects.<ref name=Gizbrekht2016>{{cite article |last=Gizbrekht |first=Andrey Ivanovich |year=2016 |title=\u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u044b \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0434\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \"\u042f\u0437\u044b\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\" (\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430) |trans-title=The images of public figures of Russian history in the discourse of modern \"Pagan art\" (based on fine arts material) |url=https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/obrazy-deyateley-rossiyskoy-istorii-v-diskurse-sovremennogo-yazycheskogo-iskusstva-na-materiale-izobrazitelnogo-tvorchestva |publisher=\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b}} \u0423\u0414\u041a 298.9:7.044/.046.</ref> Rodnover rituals and festivals often include [[martial arts]] displays; these sometimes symbolise seasonal change, such as the victory of spring over winter, or can be regarded as manifestations of bravery, strength, and honesty.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=95}} Slavic-hill wrestling (\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u043e-\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0431\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0431\u0430, ''Slavyano-goritskaya bor'ba'') was established by the Russian Rodnover Aleksandr Belov.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2013|p=69}}{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=39}} Other martial arts styles that are popular among Rodnovers are \"bench wrestling\" (''lavochki'') and \"wall against wall\" (''stenka na stenku'').{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=288}}\n\n==History==\nThe origins of Slavic Native Faith have been traced to the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement of late eighteenth and nineteenth-century Europe, which was a reaction against [[rationalism]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]].{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=215}} This was accompanied by a growth in [[nationalism]] across Europe, as intellectuals began to assert their own national heritage.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=215}} Whereas calls to re-establish pre-Christian belief systems existed within the German and Austrian far-right nationalist movements during the early twentieth century, the same did not happen in its Russian counterpart.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=285}}\n\n[[File:O S\u0142awia\u0144szczy\u017anie przed chrze\u015bcija\u0144stwem.

In doing so, pre-Christian belief systems underwent a rehabilitation.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|pp=285\u2013286}} Russian Native Faith originated in the [[Soviet dissidents]]' circles of the 1970s.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=185}} An intellectual circle that cultivated themes of Slavic indigenous religion formed as a wing of the predominantly Orthodox Christian [[samizdat]] nationalist journal ''Veche'' (1971\u20131974). Such group included Anatoly Ivanov, the artist [[Konstantin Vasilyev]] (1942\u20131974), and Nikolai Bogdanov, among others. Vasilyev's art is widely celebrated within the Rodnover community. Ivanov, who declared himself a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] and subscribed to \"Arism\" or \"Slavism\", published a fervently anti-Christian pamphlet entitled \"The Christian Plague\" (''Khristianskaya chuma''). Throughout the 1970s, the nationalist dissident movement split into two branches, an Orthodox Christian one and another one that developed [[National Bolshevism]], which eventually continued to harbour Pagan traditionalists.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=26\u201327}} Other influential texts in this period were Valery Yemelyanov's ''Desionizatsiya'' (\"De-Sionisation\") and later Istarkhov's ''Udar russkikh bogov'' (\"The Strike of Russian Gods\").{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=186}}\n\nIn the Soviet Union, Slavic Native Faith groups had to operate in secret, although a few small groups were known to exist in Moscow and Leningrad.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=146}} These groups were closely linked to the nationalistic circles operating during the 1980s.{{sfn|Aitamurto|Gaidukov|2013|p=146}} In Moscow, an [[occultism|occult]] circle was established by Yevgeny Golovin and Yuri Mamleyev;

By his own words: \"God's grace came upon me, and following the will of God I have proclaimed a new understanding of God\". According to believers, he acquired this knowledge through \"breath of his ancestors\" being united with them \"by divine holiness\".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=134}} The Federation of Ukrainian Rodnovers, which directly inherits Volodymyr Shaian's Orthodoxy, in the person of its leader Halyna Lozko has advanced vehement critiques of Sylenkoism, calling Lev Sylenko a \"false prophet\" and accusing him of trying to lead Ukrainians in the \"quagmire of cosmopolitan monotheism\", the \"fruit of Judaic religions which aim for global world domination\".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=22}}\n\n====Yagnovery, Ladovery, and Orantism====\nYagnovery (Ukrainian: \u042f\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0440\u0430), Ladovery (\u041b\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0440\u0430) and Orantism (\u041e\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0437\u043c) are branches of Rodnovery that are present in Ukraine.{{sfn|Rabotkina|2013|p=238}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kutuzova |first=N.

Ynglism meets widespread disapproval within mainstream Rodnovery, and the international ''veche'' has declared it a false religion. Nevertheless, according to Aitamurto (2016), on the basis of the amount of literature that Ynglists publish and the presence of their representatives at various Rodnover conferences, is clear that Ynglism has a \"substantial number of followers\".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=51}}\n\n====Ringing Cedars' Anastasianism====\n{{Main|Ringing Cedars' Anastasianism}}\n\nThe Ringing Cedars (Russian: \u0417\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u041a\u0435\u0434\u0440\u044b) or Anastasianism is a spiritual movement that overlaps with Rodnovery. The Ringing Cedars' movement arises from the writings of [[Vladimir Megre]] (Puzakov), codified in a series of ten books, whose teachings are attributed to an [[archetype|archetypal]] Siberian wise woman known as Anastasia.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=52}} These books teach what Rasa Pranskevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 has defined as a \"cosmological pantheism\",{{sfn|Pranskevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117|2015|p=446}} in which nature is the manifested \"thought of God\" and human thought has the power to commune with him and to actively participate in his creation.{{sfn|Pranskevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117|2015|pp=450\u2013451}}\n\nAnastasians have established rural villages all over Russia, \"kinship homesteads\" (\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c\u0435, ''rodovoye pomest'ye''), where they conduct a harmonious life in at least a hectare of land. The name \"Ringing Cedars\" derives from the beliefs held by Anastasians about the spiritual qualities of the [[Pinus sibirica|Siberian cedar]]. In his writings, Megre identifies the ideal society which the Ringing Cedars' movement aims at establishing as \"Vedic\", and many of his teachings are identical to those of other movements of Rodnovery.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=52\u201353}}\n\n====Tezaurus' Authentism====\n{{Main|Authentism}}\n\nAuthentism (Russian: \u0410\u0443\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0437\u043c), incorporated as the \"Tezaurus Spiritual Union\" (\u0414\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437 \"\u0422\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0443\u0440\u0443\u0441\"), is a Rodnover spiritual philosophy and psychological order created by the psychologist Sergey Petrovich Semenov in 1984, in Saint Petersburg. The movement is based on the teachings of the ''Russian Veda'', considered an expression of Slavic paganism, Russian cosmism and [[psychoanalysis]].

Red wine is made from dark-colored [[grape varieties]]. The actual [[Wine color|color of the wine]] can range from violet, typical of young wines, through red for mature wines, to brown for older red wines. The juice from most purple grapes is actually greenish-white; the red color comes from anthocyan pigments (also called [[anthocyanin]]s) present in the skin of the grape; exceptions are the relatively uncommon [[teinturier]] varieties, which actually have red flesh and produce red juice.\n\n=== White wine ===\n{{Main|White wine}}\nFermentation of the non-colored [[Juice vesicles|grape pulp]] produces white wine. The grapes from which white wine is produced are typically green or yellow. Some varieties are well-known, such as the [[Chardonnay]], [[Sauvignon blanc|Sauvignon]], and [[Riesling]]. Other white wines are blended from multiple varieties; [[Tokay (grape)|Tokay]], [[Sherry]], and [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]] are examples of these. Dark-skinned grapes may be used to produce white wine if the wine-maker is careful not to let the skin stain the [[wort]] during the separation of the pulp-juice. [[Pinot noir]], for example, is commonly used to produce [[champagne]].\n\nDry (non-sweet) white wine is the most common, derived from the complete fermentation of the [[wort]]. Sweet wines are produced when the fermentation is interrupted before all the grape sugars are converted into alcohol. Sparkling wines, which are mostly white wines, are produced by not allowing [[carbon dioxide]] from the fermentation to escape during fermentation, which takes place in the bottle rather than in the barrel.\n\n===Sparkling wine ===\n{{Main|Sparkling wine}}\n\n=== Ros\u00e9 wine ===\n{{Main|Ros\u00e9 wine}}\nA ros\u00e9 wine incorporates some of the [[wine color|color]] from the grape skins, but not enough to qualify it as a [[red wine]]. It may be the oldest known type of wine, as it is the most straightforward to make with the [[Maceration (wine)|skin contact method]]. The pink color can range from a pale orange to a vivid near-purple, depending on the varietals used and wine-making techniques. There are three primary ways to produce ros\u00e9 wine: skin contact (allowing dark grape skins to stain the [[wort]]), saign\u00e9e (removing juice from the [[must]] early in fermentation and continuing fermentation of the juice separately), and [[Blending (alcohol production)|blending]] (uncommon and discouraged in most wine growing regions). Ros\u00e9 wines can be made still, [[Semi-sparkling wines|semi-sparkling]], or [[sparkling wine|sparkling]], with a wide range of [[sweetness (wine)|sweetness levels]] from [[dryness (taste)|dry]] [[Proven\u00e7al (wine)|Proven\u00e7al]] ros\u00e9 to sweet [[White Zinfandel]]s and blushes. Ros\u00e9 wines are made from a wide variety of grapes all over the world.<ref name=\"Oxford\">J.

Other than the grape [[variety (botany)|varieties]] traditionally used for wine-making, most fruits naturally lack either sufficient fermentable sugars, relatively low acidity, yeast nutrients needed to promote or maintain fermentation, or a combination of these three characteristics. This is probably one of the main reasons why wine derived from grapes has historically been more prevalent by far than other types, and why specific types of fruit wine have generally been confined to regions in which the fruits were native or introduced for other reasons.\n\n=== Mead (honey wine) ===\n{{Main|Mead}}\nMead, also called honey wine, is created by fermenting [[honey]] with water, sometimes with various fruits, spices, grains, or [[hops]].

When one of these varieties is used as the predominant grape (usually defined by law as minimums of 75% to 85%), the result is a \"[[varietal]]\" as opposed to a \"blended\" wine. Blended wines are not necessarily inferior to varietal wines, rather they are a different style of wine-making.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/dining/drinks/wine-school-california-grenache.html|title=Don't Judge a Wine by the Grape on Its Label|date=2018-02-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nWine can also be made from other species of grape or from [[Hybrid (grapes)|hybrids]], created by the [[genetic crossing (vine)|genetic crossing]] of two species. ''[[Vitis labrusca|V. labrusca]]'' (of which the [[Concord grape]] is a [[cultivar]]), ''[[Vitis aestivalis|V. aestivalis]]'', ''[[Vitis rupestris|V. rupestris]]'', ''[[Vitis rotundifolia|V. rotundifolia]]'' and ''[[Vitis riparia|V. riparia]]'' are native [[North America]]n grapes usually grown to eat fresh or for grape juice, jam, or jelly, and only occasionally made into wine.\n\nHybridization is different from [[grafting]]. Most of the world's vineyards are planted with European ''V. vinifera'' vines that have been grafted onto North American species' rootstock, a common practice due to their resistance to [[phylloxera]], a root louse that eventually kills the vine. In the late 19th century, most of Europe's vineyards (excluding some of the driest in the south) were devastated by the infestation, leading to widespread vine deaths and eventual replanting. Grafting is done in every wine-producing region in the world except in [[Argentina]], the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Chile]]\u2014the only places not yet exposed to the insect.<ref name=\"Robinson pg 97\">{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Jancis |title=Jancis Robinson's Wine Course: A Guide to the World of Wine |date=28 April 2006 |publisher=Abbeville Press |isbn=978-0-7892-0883-5 |page=97}}</ref>\n\nIn the context of wine production, ''[[terroir]]'' is a concept that encompasses the varieties of grapes used, elevation and shape of the vineyard, type and chemistry of soil, climate and seasonal conditions, and the local yeast cultures.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fraga|first1=Helder|last2=Malheiro|first2=Aureliano C.|last3=Moutinho-Pereira|first3=Jos\u00e9|last4=Cardoso|first4=Rita M.|last5=Soares|first5=Pedro M.

European wines tend to be classified by region (e.g. [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]], [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja]] and [[Chianti]]), while non-European wines are most often classified by grape (e.g. [[Pinot noir]] and [[Merlot]]). Market recognition of particular regions has recently been leading to their increased prominence on non-European wine labels. Examples of recognized non-European locales include [[Napa Valley AVA|Napa Valley]], Santa Clara Valley, [[Sonoma Valley AVA|Sonoma Valley]], Anderson Valley, and [[Mendocino County]] in California; [[Willamette Valley (wine)|Willamette Valley]] and [[Rogue Valley AVA|Rogue Valley]] in [[Oregon (wine)|Oregon]]; [[Columbia Valley (wine)|Columbia Valley]] in [[Washington (wine)|Washington]]; [[Barossa Valley (wine)|Barossa Valley]] in [[South Australia (wine)|South Australia]]; [[Hunter Valley (wine)|Hunter Valley]] in [[New South Wales (wine)|New South Wales]]; Luj\u00e1n de Cuyo in [[Argentina (wine)|Argentina]]; Central Valley in [[Chile (wine)|Chile]]; Vale dos Vinhedos in [[Brazil]]; [[Hawke's Bay Region|Hawke's Bay]] and [[Marlborough Region|Marlborough]] in [[New Zealand (wine)|New Zealand]]; and in [[Canadian wine|Canada]], the [[Okanagan Valley (wine)|Okanagan Valley]] of [[British Columbia wine|British Columbia]], and the [[Niagara Peninsula]] and [[Essex County, Ontario|Essex County]] regions of [[Ontario wine|Ontario]] are the three largest producers.\n\nSome blended wine names are marketing terms whose use is governed by [[trademark]] law rather than by specific wine laws. For example, [[Meritage]] (sounds like \"heritage\") is generally a Bordeaux-style blend of [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] and Merlot, but may also include [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit Verdot]], and [[Malbec]].

Wines contain many chemical compounds similar or identical to those in fruits, vegetables, and [[spice]]s. The [[sweetness of wine]] is determined by the amount of residual sugar in the wine after fermentation, relative to the acidity present in the wine. [[Dry wine]], for example, has only a small amount of residual sugar. Some wine labels suggest opening the bottle and letting the wine \"breathe\" for a couple of hours before serving, while others recommend drinking it immediately. [[Decanter|Decanting]] (the act of pouring a wine into a special container just for breathing) is a controversial subject among wine enthusiasts. In addition to aeration, decanting with a filter allows the removal of bitter sediments that may have formed in the wine. Sediment is more common in older bottles, but aeration may benefit younger wines.<ref name=\"Johnson & Robinson pg 46\">{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |author2=Jancis Robinson  |title=The World Atlas of Wine |date=13 September 2001 |publisher=Mitchell Beazley |isbn=978-1-84000-332-1 |page=46}}</ref>\n\nDuring aeration, a younger wine's exposure to air often \"relaxes\" the drink, making it smoother and better integrated in aroma, texture, and flavor.

Drinking enough to cause a [[blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible [[euphoria]], increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a [[Alcohol flush reaction|flushed, red appearance in the face]] and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes [[lethargy]], [[sedation]], balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g. slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes [[stupor]], unconsciousness, [[anterograde amnesia]], vomiting, and death may occur due to inhalation of vomit ([[pulmonary aspiration]]) while unconscious and [[respiratory depression]] (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a [[coma]] (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal [[alcohol poisoning]]. As with all alcoholic drinks, [[drinking and driving|drinking while driving]], operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have penalties against drunk driving.\n\nWines can trigger positive emotions in a short period of time, such as feelings of relaxation and comfort.

Tucked inside the package is a tap affixed to the [[bag in box]], or bladder, that is later extended by the consumer for serving the contents. Box wine can stay acceptably fresh for up to a month after opening because the bladder collapses as wine is dispensed, limiting contact with air and, thus, slowing the rate of oxidation. In contrast, bottled wine [[oxidize]]s more rapidly after opening because of the increasing ratio of air to wine as the contents are dispensed; it can degrade considerably in a few days.

The glass used to make bottles is a nontoxic, naturally occurring substance that is completely recyclable, whereas the plastics used for box-wine containers are typically much less environmentally friendly. However, wine-bottle manufacturers have been cited for [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] violations. A ''New York Times'' editorial suggested that box wine, being lighter in package weight, has a reduced [[carbon footprint]] from its distribution; however, box-wine plastics, even though possibly recyclable, can be more labor-intensive (and therefore expensive) to process than glass bottles.

Fine restaurants and some private homes have wine cellars. In an active wine cellar, temperature and humidity are maintained by a climate-control system.

Because wine is a natural, perishable food product, all types\u2014including red, white, sparkling, and fortified\u2014can spoil when exposed to heat, light, vibration or fluctuations in temperature and humidity.

Wine refrigerators are not ideal for aging, but rather serve to chill wine to the proper temperature for drinking. These refrigerators keep the humidity low (usually under 50%), below the optimal humidity of 50% to 70%. Lower humidity levels can dry out corks over time, allowing oxygen to enter the bottle, which reduces the wine's quality through oxidation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://intowine.com/wine-fridges-and-wine-cabinets|title=Wine Fridges and Wine Cabinets}}</ref> While some types of alcohol are sometimes stored in freezer, such as [[vodka]], it is not possible to safely freeze wine in the bottle, as there is insufficient room for it to expand as it freezes and the bottle will usually crack. Certain shapes of bottle may allow the cork to be pushed out by the ice, but if the bottle is frozen on its side, the wine in the narrower neck will invariably freeze first, preventing this.\n\n== Professions ==\nThere are a large number of occupations and professions that are part of the wine industry, ranging from the individuals who grow the grapes, prepare the wine, bottle it, sell it, assess it, market it and finally make recommendations to clients and serve the wine.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Related professions\n!Name\n!Description\n|-\n|Cellar master\n|A person in charge of a wine cellar\n|-\n|[[Cooper (profession)|Cooper]]\n|A craftsperson of wooden barrels and casks.

[[Yeast in winemaking|Yeast]] consumes the [[sugar]] in the [[Grape|grapes]] and converts it to [[ethanol]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[heat]]. Different varieties of grapes and [[Strain (biology)|strains]] of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the grape's growing environment ([[terroir]]), and the production process.

Red wine is made from dark-colored [[grape varieties]]. The actual [[Wine color|color of the wine]] can range from violet, typical of young wines, through red for mature wines, to brown for older red wines. The juice from most purple grapes is actually greenish-white; the red color comes from anthocyan pigments (also called [[anthocyanin]]s) present in the skin of the grape; exceptions are the relatively uncommon [[teinturier]] varieties, which actually have red flesh and produce red juice.\n\n=== White wine ===\n{{Main|White wine}}\nFermentation of the non-colored [[Juice vesicles|grape pulp]] produces white wine. The grapes from which white wine is produced are typically green or yellow. Some varieties are well-known, such as the [[Chardonnay]], [[Sauvignon blanc|Sauvignon]], and [[Riesling]]. Other white wines are blended from multiple varieties; [[Tokay (grape)|Tokay]], [[Sherry]], and [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]] are examples of these. Dark-skinned grapes may be used to produce white wine if the wine-maker is careful not to let the skin stain the [[wort]] during the separation of the pulp-juice. [[Pinot noir]], for example, is commonly used to produce [[champagne]].\n\nDry (non-sweet) white wine is the most common, derived from the complete fermentation of the [[wort]]. Sweet wines are produced when the fermentation is interrupted before all the grape sugars are converted into alcohol. Sparkling wines, which are mostly white wines, are produced by not allowing [[carbon dioxide]] from the fermentation to escape during fermentation, which takes place in the bottle rather than in the barrel.\n\n===Sparkling wine ===\n{{Main|Sparkling wine}}\n\n=== Ros\u00e9 wine ===\n{{Main|Ros\u00e9 wine}}\nA ros\u00e9 wine incorporates some of the [[wine color|color]] from the grape skins, but not enough to qualify it as a [[red wine]]. It may be the oldest known type of wine, as it is the most straightforward to make with the [[Maceration (wine)|skin contact method]]. The pink color can range from a pale orange to a vivid near-purple, depending on the varietals used and wine-making techniques. There are three primary ways to produce ros\u00e9 wine: skin contact (allowing dark grape skins to stain the [[wort]]), saign\u00e9e (removing juice from the [[must]] early in fermentation and continuing fermentation of the juice separately), and [[Blending (alcohol production)|blending]] (uncommon and discouraged in most wine growing regions). Ros\u00e9 wines can be made still, [[Semi-sparkling wines|semi-sparkling]], or [[sparkling wine|sparkling]], with a wide range of [[sweetness (wine)|sweetness levels]] from [[dryness (taste)|dry]] [[Proven\u00e7al (wine)|Proven\u00e7al]] ros\u00e9 to sweet [[White Zinfandel]]s and blushes. Ros\u00e9 wines are made from a wide variety of grapes all over the world.<ref name=\"Oxford\">J.

Other than the grape [[variety (botany)|varieties]] traditionally used for wine-making, most fruits naturally lack either sufficient fermentable sugars, relatively low acidity, yeast nutrients needed to promote or maintain fermentation, or a combination of these three characteristics. This is probably one of the main reasons why wine derived from grapes has historically been more prevalent by far than other types, and why specific types of fruit wine have generally been confined to regions in which the fruits were native or introduced for other reasons.\n\n=== Mead (honey wine) ===\n{{Main|Mead}}\nMead, also called honey wine, is created by fermenting [[honey]] with water, sometimes with various fruits, spices, grains, or [[hops]].

When one of these varieties is used as the predominant grape (usually defined by law as minimums of 75% to 85%), the result is a \"[[varietal]]\" as opposed to a \"blended\" wine. Blended wines are not necessarily inferior to varietal wines, rather they are a different style of wine-making.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/dining/drinks/wine-school-california-grenache.html|title=Don't Judge a Wine by the Grape on Its Label|date=2018-02-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nWine can also be made from other species of grape or from [[Hybrid (grapes)|hybrids]], created by the [[genetic crossing (vine)|genetic crossing]] of two species. ''[[Vitis labrusca|V. labrusca]]'' (of which the [[Concord grape]] is a [[cultivar]]), ''[[Vitis aestivalis|V. aestivalis]]'', ''[[Vitis rupestris|V. rupestris]]'', ''[[Vitis rotundifolia|V. rotundifolia]]'' and ''[[Vitis riparia|V. riparia]]'' are native [[North America]]n grapes usually grown to eat fresh or for grape juice, jam, or jelly, and only occasionally made into wine.\n\nHybridization is different from [[grafting]]. Most of the world's vineyards are planted with European ''V. vinifera'' vines that have been grafted onto North American species' rootstock, a common practice due to their resistance to [[phylloxera]], a root louse that eventually kills the vine. In the late 19th century, most of Europe's vineyards (excluding some of the driest in the south) were devastated by the infestation, leading to widespread vine deaths and eventual replanting. Grafting is done in every wine-producing region in the world except in [[Argentina]], the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Chile]]\u2014the only places not yet exposed to the insect.<ref name=\"Robinson pg 97\">{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Jancis |title=Jancis Robinson's Wine Course: A Guide to the World of Wine |date=28 April 2006 |publisher=Abbeville Press |isbn=978-0-7892-0883-5 |page=97}}</ref>\n\nIn the context of wine production, ''[[terroir]]'' is a concept that encompasses the varieties of grapes used, elevation and shape of the vineyard, type and chemistry of soil, climate and seasonal conditions, and the local yeast cultures.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fraga|first1=Helder|last2=Malheiro|first2=Aureliano C.|last3=Moutinho-Pereira|first3=Jos\u00e9|last4=Cardoso|first4=Rita M.|last5=Soares|first5=Pedro M.

European wines tend to be classified by region (e.g. [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]], [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja]] and [[Chianti]]), while non-European wines are most often classified by grape (e.g. [[Pinot noir]] and [[Merlot]]). Market recognition of particular regions has recently been leading to their increased prominence on non-European wine labels. Examples of recognized non-European locales include [[Napa Valley AVA|Napa Valley]], Santa Clara Valley, [[Sonoma Valley AVA|Sonoma Valley]], Anderson Valley, and [[Mendocino County]] in California; [[Willamette Valley (wine)|Willamette Valley]] and [[Rogue Valley AVA|Rogue Valley]] in [[Oregon (wine)|Oregon]]; [[Columbia Valley (wine)|Columbia Valley]] in [[Washington (wine)|Washington]]; [[Barossa Valley (wine)|Barossa Valley]] in [[South Australia (wine)|South Australia]]; [[Hunter Valley (wine)|Hunter Valley]] in [[New South Wales (wine)|New South Wales]]; Luj\u00e1n de Cuyo in [[Argentina (wine)|Argentina]]; Central Valley in [[Chile (wine)|Chile]]; Vale dos Vinhedos in [[Brazil]]; [[Hawke's Bay Region|Hawke's Bay]] and [[Marlborough Region|Marlborough]] in [[New Zealand (wine)|New Zealand]]; and in [[Canadian wine|Canada]], the [[Okanagan Valley (wine)|Okanagan Valley]] of [[British Columbia wine|British Columbia]], and the [[Niagara Peninsula]] and [[Essex County, Ontario|Essex County]] regions of [[Ontario wine|Ontario]] are the three largest producers.\n\nSome blended wine names are marketing terms whose use is governed by [[trademark]] law rather than by specific wine laws. For example, [[Meritage]] (sounds like \"heritage\") is generally a Bordeaux-style blend of [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] and Merlot, but may also include [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit Verdot]], and [[Malbec]].

Wines contain many chemical compounds similar or identical to those in fruits, vegetables, and [[spice]]s. The [[sweetness of wine]] is determined by the amount of residual sugar in the wine after fermentation, relative to the acidity present in the wine. [[Dry wine]], for example, has only a small amount of residual sugar. Some wine labels suggest opening the bottle and letting the wine \"breathe\" for a couple of hours before serving, while others recommend drinking it immediately. [[Decanter|Decanting]] (the act of pouring a wine into a special container just for breathing) is a controversial subject among wine enthusiasts. In addition to aeration, decanting with a filter allows the removal of bitter sediments that may have formed in the wine. Sediment is more common in older bottles, but aeration may benefit younger wines.<ref name=\"Johnson & Robinson pg 46\">{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |author2=Jancis Robinson  |title=The World Atlas of Wine |date=13 September 2001 |publisher=Mitchell Beazley |isbn=978-1-84000-332-1 |page=46}}</ref>\n\nDuring aeration, a younger wine's exposure to air often \"relaxes\" the drink, making it smoother and better integrated in aroma, texture, and flavor.

Drinking enough to cause a [[blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible [[euphoria]], increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a [[Alcohol flush reaction|flushed, red appearance in the face]] and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes [[lethargy]], [[sedation]], balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g. slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes [[stupor]], unconsciousness, [[anterograde amnesia]], vomiting, and death may occur due to inhalation of vomit ([[pulmonary aspiration]]) while unconscious and [[respiratory depression]] (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a [[coma]] (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal [[alcohol poisoning]]. As with all alcoholic drinks, [[drinking and driving|drinking while driving]], operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have penalties against drunk driving.\n\nWines can trigger positive emotions in a short period of time, such as feelings of relaxation and comfort. The context and quality of wine can affect the mood and emotions, too.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Danner|first1=Lukas|last2=Ristic|first2=Renata|last3=Johnson|first3=Trent E|last4=Meiselman|first4=Herbert L|last5=Hoek|first5=Annet C|title=Context and wine quality effects on consumers' mood, emotions, liking and willingness to pay for Australian Shiraz wines|journal=Food Research International|date=Nov 2016|volume=89|issue=Pt 1|pages=254\u2013265|doi=10.1016/j.foodres.2016.08.006|pmid=28460912}}</ref>\n\n=== Long-term effects ===\n{{See also|Long-term effects of alcohol consumption}}\n[[File:Possible long-term effects of ethanol.svg|thumb|left|Most significant of the possible [[Long-term effects of alcohol consumption|long-term effects]] of [[ethanol]], one of the constituents of wine.

Tucked inside the package is a tap affixed to the [[bag in box]], or bladder, that is later extended by the consumer for serving the contents. Box wine can stay acceptably fresh for up to a month after opening because the bladder collapses as wine is dispensed, limiting contact with air and, thus, slowing the rate of oxidation. In contrast, bottled wine [[oxidize]]s more rapidly after opening because of the increasing ratio of air to wine as the contents are dispensed; it can degrade considerably in a few days.

The glass used to make bottles is a nontoxic, naturally occurring substance that is completely recyclable, whereas the plastics used for box-wine containers are typically much less environmentally friendly. However, wine-bottle manufacturers have been cited for [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] violations. A ''New York Times'' editorial suggested that box wine, being lighter in package weight, has a reduced [[carbon footprint]] from its distribution; however, box-wine plastics, even though possibly recyclable, can be more labor-intensive (and therefore expensive) to process than glass bottles.

Fine restaurants and some private homes have wine cellars. In an active wine cellar, temperature and humidity are maintained by a climate-control system. Passive wine cellars are not climate-controlled, and so must be carefully located. Because wine is a natural, perishable food product, all types\u2014including red, white, sparkling, and fortified\u2014can spoil when exposed to heat, light, vibration or fluctuations in temperature and humidity.

Wine refrigerators are not ideal for aging, but rather serve to chill wine to the proper temperature for drinking. These refrigerators keep the humidity low (usually under 50%), below the optimal humidity of 50% to 70%. Lower humidity levels can dry out corks over time, allowing oxygen to enter the bottle, which reduces the wine's quality through oxidation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://intowine.com/wine-fridges-and-wine-cabinets|title=Wine Fridges and Wine Cabinets}}</ref> While some types of alcohol are sometimes stored in freezer, such as [[vodka]], it is not possible to safely freeze wine in the bottle, as there is insufficient room for it to expand as it freezes and the bottle will usually crack. Certain shapes of bottle may allow the cork to be pushed out by the ice, but if the bottle is frozen on its side, the wine in the narrower neck will invariably freeze first, preventing this.\n\n== Professions ==\nThere are a large number of occupations and professions that are part of the wine industry, ranging from the individuals who grow the grapes, prepare the wine, bottle it, sell it, assess it, market it and finally make recommendations to clients and serve the wine.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Related professions\n!Name\n!Description\n|-\n|Cellar master\n|A person in charge of a wine cellar\n|-\n|[[Cooper (profession)|Cooper]]\n|A craftsperson of wooden barrels and casks.
