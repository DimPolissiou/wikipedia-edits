Rector]] depicting the 1897 [[boxing]] match between [[James J. Corbett]] and [[Bob Fitzsimmons]] in [[Carson City, Nevada]] on [[St. Patrick's Day]]. Originally running for more than 100 minutes, it was the [[Feature length|longest]] film released to date; as such, it was the world's first [[feature film]]. The technology that allowed this is known as the [[Latham loop]]. Rector claimed to have invented the device, but its invention is disputed. He used three such equipped cameras placed adjacently and filming on 63mm [[nitrate film]].  Only fragments of the film survive.  The known fragments were transferred in the 1980s from a print owned by Jean A. LeRoy of New York City, the transfer done on a specially built [[optical printer]] to convert the film to [[35mm movie film|35mm film]].\n\nThe film was also the first to be shot in [[widescreen]], with an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of about 1.65:1.

This was not unusual for a boxing film, although each round would previously have been presented as a separate attraction.  What made this film exceptional is a five-minute introduction that showed former champion [[John L. Sullivan]] (whom Corbett defeated in 1892) and his manager, [[Billy Madden]], introducing the event, the introduction of referee [[George Siler]], and both boxers entering the ring in their robes.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|22}}\n\nThe one-minute rests between each round were captured on film and when it was reissued it included a ten-minute epilogue of the empty ring at the end of the fight, into which members of the audience eventually stormed. Even with these approximate timings, the film ran a minimum of 71 minutes, and sources generally report that it exceeded 90 or 100 minutes.  The film climaxes with Fitzsimmons hitting Corbett in the [[solar plexus]] for a knockout and Corbett crawling outside the space of the camera so that he is not visible above the waist.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|22}}\n\n==Production==\nEnoch J. Rector had been an employee of the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company, which filmed ''[[Corbett and Courtney Before the Kinetograph]]'' (1894) in six one minute rounds, each exhibited via the [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] [[Kinetoscope]] as a separate [[peep show]] for a separate fee.<ref name= \"Musser1990\">{{cite book |last= Musser|first= Charles|date= 1990|title= The Emergence of Cinema: The American Screen to 1907|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IEUMWToGOtUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|location= Berkeley|publisher= University of California Press|isbn= 0-520-08533-7|author-link= Charles Musser}}</ref>{{rp|194}} Some time after leaving the company, Rector arranged for the film with boxing promoter [[Dan Stuart (promoter)|Dan Stuart]].<ref name= \"Condon2009\">{{cite book |last= Condon|first= Dennis|date= 2009|chapter= Irish Audiences Watch Their First US Feature: The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight (1897)|title= Screening Irish-America: A Reader|location= Dublin|publisher= Irish Academic Press|pages= 135\u2013147|isbn= 9780716529910|editor-last= Barton|editor-first= Ruth}}</ref>{{rp|137}} Stuart offered $10,000 to the winner of the bout in an agreement signed by both boxers on 4 January 1897.

Much attention was given to the fact that Rose Julian Fitzsimmons, Bob's wife, viewed the live match from a box with other female companions, such as dancers [[Lo\u00efe Eiler]] and [[Ida Eiler]], while women otherwise did not mix with the crowd.

One of these was by \"Matinee Girl,\" a reporter for the ''[[New York Dramatic Mirror]]'' (who may or may not have been a real woman), who reported in the June 12, 1897 issue viewing the film with some shame, admiration for Corbett, and disappointment at his loss.  He points out that she name-drops Brady, which identifies her as an \"insider.\"<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|34}} The other article he found by a woman was \"Alice Rix at the Veriscope\" from the ''Examiner'' Sunday Magazine.<ref>''Examiner'', July 18, 1897, p. 72</ref>  [[Alice Rix]], known for a particular brand of \"[[sob sister]]\" journalism (along with [[Nellie Bly]] and [[Dorothy Dix]]), claimed that when she viewed the film at the [[Olympia Theatre, New York|Olympia Theatre]], she counted only sixty women in an audience of a thousand, and found the [[dress circle]] empty.

She proceeded to describe the entire medium of motion pictures as \"awful.\"<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|36\u201337}}\n\nStreible reproduces a drawing that accompanied Rix's article depicting two women in attendance of the film. One appears to be younger and leaning forward, watching the film with interest, while the other, apparently an older woman acting as chaperon, is turned away from the screen and uninterested in the film, even dismayed at the younger woman's interest. He notes that \"respectable women\" had been allowed to attend theater for only about a generation, and that Broadway did not actively court women or families as audience members until 1865.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|38}} The pre-war audience had primarily been men and prostitutes.<ref>{{cite book |last= Allen|first= Robert C.|date= 1991|title= Horrible Prettiness:  Burlesque and American Culture|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4IoXcZyKKJoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|location= Chapel Hill|publisher= The University of North Carolina Press|page= 86|isbn= 0-8078-4316-4|author-link= Robert C.

Musser notes that ''[[The Boston Herald]]'' went so far as to call the film the \"proper\" thing for ladies to see.<ref name= \"Musser1990\" />{{rp|200}} Streible, citing the research of [[Antonia Lant]], contrasts paintings of women in theater audiences by [[Mary Cassatt]], [[Claude Monet]], and [[Berthe Morisot]] with this drawing by making it appear that the fact that women were allowed to look was more important than that the act of looking being allowed to them.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|46}} That the younger woman is leaning indicates that what she is looking at is, in fact, what is important to her rather than the simple privilege of looking.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|39}}\n\nStreible also touches on potential [[homoerotic]] interest in the film, citing work on [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] photos by [[Thomas Waugh]].  He concludes that prizefighting, as opposed to [[physical culture]], was not associated with aesthetics or male beauty, Corbett excepted.  The aesthetics of the boxing scene were better known for broken jaws and [[cauliflower ears]], such that one's [[sexual orientation]] probably had little bearing on one's appreciation of the film, and of a sport surrounded by [[homophobic]] press.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|41}}\n\nMusser, in his discussion of subsequent feature-length fight films, that subsequent to ''The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight'', no boxing film drew comparable audience numbers and that women stopped attending in significant numbers.,<ref name= \"Musser1990\" />{{rp|208}} reinforcing Streible's theories of hype and female interest in Corbett the matinee idol.\n\nDenis Condon discusses how class, rather than gender, affected audience response to the film in Dublin.<ref name= \"Condon2009\" /> The significance of the film's reception in Ireland derives from the fact that Corbett was Irish by birth and often contrasted to the English-born Fitzsimmons, who himself was the son of an Irish blacksmith, a fact that no newspaper noted at the time.  He notes a surprising absence, in response to the film, of ethnic partisanship, in spite of the St. Patrick's Day day of the fight, the Irish-English tension of 1898, and heavy antagonism of the Irish-American Corbett and the English Fitzsimmons, who is elsewhere described as Anglo-Australian.  Audiences put aside political fervors and suspended their knowledge, pretending that they were watching a live performance.<ref name= \"Condon2009\" />{{rp|144}} Irish women did not attend, possibly because [[The Lyric Hall]], where the film was shown, often featured live boxing and sexually risqu\u00e9 material, and thus considered an inappropriate place for a respectable woman, while another theatre nearby was regarded as more family-friendly.<ref name= \"Condon2009\" />{{rp|141}}\n\n==Legacy==\nQuick to compete, [[Siegmund Lubin]] created a film the same year known as ''[[Reproduction of the Corbett and Fitzsimmons Fight]]'', staged on a rooftop with two freight handlers from the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].  Each round was shot on only 50 feet of 35 millimeter film stock at a very slow speed.

Rector]] depicting the 1897 [[boxing]] match between [[James J. Corbett]] and [[Bob Fitzsimmons]] in [[Carson City, Nevada]] on [[St. Patrick's Day]].  Originally running for more than 100 minutes, it was the [[Feature length|longest]] film released to date; as such, it was the world's first [[feature film]].  The technology that allowed this is known as the [[Latham loop]], and Rector was a rival for claiming the invention of the device.  He used three such equipped cameras placed adjacently and filming on 63mm [[nitrate film]].  Only fragments of the film survive.  The known fragments were transferred in the 1980s from a print owned by Jean A. LeRoy of New York City, the transfer done on a specially built [[optical printer]] to convert the film to [[35mm movie film|35mm film]].\n\nThe film was also the first to be shot in [[widescreen]], with an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of about 1.65:1.

This was not unusual for a boxing film, although each round would previously have been presented as a separate attraction.  What made this film exceptional is a five-minute introduction that showed former champion [[John L. Sullivan]] (whom Corbett defeated in 1892) and his manager, [[Billy Madden]], introducing the event, the introduction of referee [[George Siler]], and both boxers entering the ring in their robes.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|22}}\n\nThe one-minute rests between each round were captured on film and when it was reissued it included a ten-minute epilogue of the empty ring at the end of the fight, into which members of the audience eventually stormed. Even with these approximate timings, the film ran a minimum of 71 minutes, and sources generally report that it exceeded 90 or 100 minutes.  The film climaxes with Fitzsimmons hitting Corbett in the [[solar plexus]] for a knockout and Corbett crawling outside the space of the camera so that he is not visible above the waist.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|22}}\n\n==Production==\nEnoch J. Rector had been an employee of the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company, which filmed ''[[Corbett and Courtney Before the Kinetograph]]'' (1894) in six one minute rounds, each exhibited via the [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] [[Kinetoscope]] as a separate [[peep show]] for a separate fee.<ref name= \"Musser1990\">{{cite book |last= Musser|first= Charles|date= 1990|title= The Emergence of Cinema: The American Screen to 1907|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IEUMWToGOtUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|location= Berkeley|publisher= University of California Press|isbn= 0-520-08533-7|author-link= Charles Musser}}</ref>{{rp|194}} Some time after leaving the company, Rector arranged for the film with boxing promoter [[Dan Stuart (promoter)|Dan Stuart]].<ref name= \"Condon2009\">{{cite book |last= Condon|first= Dennis|date= 2009|chapter= Irish Audiences Watch Their First US Feature: The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight (1897)|title= Screening Irish-America: A Reader|location= Dublin|publisher= Irish Academic Press|pages= 135\u2013147|isbn= 9780716529910|editor-last= Barton|editor-first= Ruth}}</ref>{{rp|137}} Stuart offered $10,000 to the winner of the bout in an agreement signed by both boxers on 4 January 1897.

Much attention was given to the fact that Rose Julian Fitzsimmons, Bob's wife, viewed the live match from a box with other female companions, such as dancers [[Lo\u00efe Eiler]] and [[Ida Eiler]], while women otherwise did not mix with the crowd.  As much as 60% of the Chicago audience was composed of women.<ref name= \"Musser1990\" /> As [[Miriam Hansen]] put it, \"it afforded women the forbidden sight of male bodies in seminudity, engaged in intimate and intense physical action.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Hansen|first= Miriam|date= 1991|title= Babel and Babylon: Spectatorship in American Silent Film|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8nFG8zMWI-0C&lpg=PA1&dq=Miriam%20Hansen%20The%20Corbett-Fitzsimmons%20Fight&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false|location= Cambridge|publisher= Harvard University Press|isbn= 0-674-05831-3}}</ref> She argues a connection between the female reception of this film and the large female audience for [[Rudolph Valentino]] two decades later, who was typically shown stripped to the waist and beaten in his films.\n\nStreible calls this into debate, and suggests that the size of the female audience is predominantly self-generated [[Boilerplate text|boilerplate]].

One of these was by \"Matinee Girl,\" a reporter for the ''[[New York Dramatic Mirror]]'' (who may or may not have been a real woman), who reported in the June 12, 1897 issue viewing the film with some shame, admiration for Corbett, and disappointment at his loss.  He points out that she name-drops Brady, which identifies her as an \"insider.\"<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|34}} The other article he found by a woman was \"Alice Rix at the Veriscope\" from the ''Examiner'' Sunday Magazine.<ref>''Examiner'', July 18, 1897, p. 72</ref>  [[Alice Rix]], known for a particular brand of \"[[sob sister]]\" journalism (along with [[Nellie Bly]] and [[Dorothy Dix]]), claimed that when she viewed the film at the [[Olympia Theatre, New York|Olympia Theatre]], she counted only sixty women in an audience of a thousand, and found the [[dress circle]] empty.

One appears to be younger and leaning forward, watching the film with interest, while the other, apparently an older woman acting as chaperon, is turned away from the screen and uninterested in the film, even dismayed at the younger woman's interest. He notes that \"respectable women\" had been allowed to attend theater for only about a generation, and that Broadway did not actively court women or families as audience members until 1865.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|38}} The pre-war audience had primarily been men and prostitutes.<ref>{{cite book |last= Allen|first= Robert C.|date= 1991|title= Horrible Prettiness:  Burlesque and American Culture|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4IoXcZyKKJoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|location= Chapel Hill|publisher= The University of North Carolina Press|page= 86|isbn= 0-8078-4316-4|author-link= Robert C.

He concludes that prizefighting, as opposed to [[physical culture]], was not associated with aesthetics or male beauty, Corbett excepted.  The aesthetics of the boxing scene were better known for broken jaws and [[cauliflower ears]], such that one's [[sexual orientation]] probably had little bearing on one's appreciation of the film, and of a sport surrounded by [[homophobic]] press.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|41}}\n\nMusser, in his discussion of subsequent feature-length fight films, that subsequent to ''The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight'', no boxing film drew comparable audience numbers and that women stopped attending in significant numbers.,<ref name= \"Musser1990\" />{{rp|208}} reinforcing Streible's theories of hype and female interest in Corbett the matinee idol.\n\nDenis Condon discusses how class, rather than gender, affected audience response to the film in Dublin.<ref name= \"Condon2009\" /> The significance of the film's reception in Ireland derives from the fact that Corbett was Irish by birth and often contrasted to the English-born Fitzsimmons, who himself was the son of an Irish blacksmith, a fact that no newspaper noted at the time.  He notes a surprising absence, in response to the film, of ethnic partisanship, in spite of the St. Patrick's Day day of the fight, the Irish-English tension of 1898, and heavy antagonism of the Irish-American Corbett and the English Fitzsimmons, who is elsewhere described as Anglo-Australian.  Audiences put aside political fervors and suspended their knowledge, pretending that they were watching a live performance.<ref name= \"Condon2009\" />{{rp|144}} Irish women did not attend, possibly because [[The Lyric Hall]], where the film was shown, often featured live boxing and sexually risqu\u00e9 material, and thus considered an inappropriate place for a respectable woman, while another theatre nearby was regarded as more family-friendly.<ref name= \"Condon2009\" />{{rp|141}}\n\n==Legacy==\nQuick to compete, [[Siegmund Lubin]] created a film the same year known as ''[[Reproduction of the Corbett and Fitzsimmons Fight]]'', staged on a rooftop with two freight handlers from the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].

Manufactured by [[STMicroelectronics]].]]\n\nThe '''ARM Cortex-M''' is a group of [[32-bit]] [[reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processor cores licensed by [[Arm Holdings]].  These cores are optimized for low-cost and energy-efficient microcontrollers, which have been embedded in tens of billions of consumer devices.<ref>[http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m ARM Cortex-M website; arm.com]</ref>   The cores consist of the Cortex-M0, Cortex-M0+, Cortex-M1, Cortex-M3, Cortex-M4, Cortex-M7, Cortex-M23, Cortex-M33, Cortex-M35P, Cortex-M55.<ref name=\"M0-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M0+-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M1-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M3-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M4-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M7-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M23-TRM\"/>  The Cortex-M4 / M7 / M33 / M35P / M55 cores have an [[Floating-point unit|FPU]] silicon option, and when included in the silicon these cores are sometimes known as \"Cortex-Mx with FPU\" or \"Cortex-MxF\", where 'x' is the core number.\n\n==Overview==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:9px;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Announced\n|-\n!

Core\n|-\n| 2004 || [[#Cortex-M3|Cortex-M3]]\n|-\n| 2007 || [[#Cortex-M1|Cortex-M1]]\n|-\n| 2009 || [[#Cortex-M0|Cortex-M0]]\n|-\n| 2010 || [[#Cortex-M4|Cortex-M4]]\n|-\n| 2012 || [[#Cortex-M0+|Cortex-M0+]]\n|-\n| 2014 || [[#Cortex-M7|Cortex-M7]]\n|-\n| 2016 || [[#Cortex-M23|Cortex-M23]]\n|-\n| 2016 || [[#Cortex-M33|Cortex-M33]]\n|-\n| 2018 || [[#Cortex-M35P|Cortex-M35P]]\n|-\n| 2020 || [[#Cortex-M55|Cortex-M55]]\n|}\n{{See also|ARM architecture|List of ARM cores}}\n\nThe ARM Cortex-M family are ARM microprocessor cores which are designed for use in [[microcontroller]]s, [[ASIC]]s, [[application-specific integrated circuit#Application-specific standard product|ASSP]]s, [[FPGA]]s, and [[system on a chip|SoC]]s.  Cortex-M cores are commonly used as dedicated microcontroller chips, but also are \"hidden\" inside of SoC chips as power management controllers, I/O controllers, system controllers, touch screen controllers, smart battery controllers, and sensors controllers.\n\nThough 8-bit microcontrollers were very popular in the past, Cortex-M has slowly been chipping away at the 8-bit market as the prices of low-end Cortex-M chips have moved downward.  Cortex-M have become a popular replacements for 8-bit chips in applications that benefit from 32-bit math operations, and replacing older legacy ARM cores such as [[ARM7]] and [[ARM9]].\n\n===License===\n[[Arm Holdings]] neither manufactures nor sells CPU devices based on its own designs, but rather licenses the processor architecture to interested parties. Arm offers a variety of licensing terms, varying in cost and deliverables. To all licensees, Arm provides an integratable hardware description of the ARM core, as well as complete software development toolset and the right to sell manufactured [[silicon]] containing the ARM CPU.\n\n===Silicon customization===\nIntegrated Device Manufacturers (IDM) receive the ARM Processor [[Intellectual property|IP]] as [[Logic synthesis|synthesizable]] [[Register transfer level|RTL]] (written in [[Verilog]]). In this form, they have the ability to perform architectural level optimizations and extensions. This allows the manufacturer to achieve custom design goals, such as higher clock speed, very low power consumption, instruction set extensions (including floating point), optimizations for size, debug support, etc.  To determine which components have been included in a particular Arm CPU chip, consult the manufacturer datasheet and related documentation.\n\nSome of the silicon options for the Cortex-M cores are:\n* SysTick timer: A 24-bit system timer that extends the functionality of both the processor and the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC). When present, it also provides an additional configurable priority SysTick interrupt.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/> Though the SysTick timer is optional, it is very rare to find a Cortex-M microcontroller without it.  If a Cortex-M33 microcontroller has the Security Extension option, then it has two SysTicks, one Secure and one Non-secure.\n* Bit-Band: Maps a complete word of memory onto a single bit in the bit-band region. For example, writing to an alias word will set or clear the corresponding bit in the bit-band region. This allows every individual bit in the bit-band region to be directly accessible from a word-aligned address. In particular, individual bits can be set, cleared, or toggled from C/C++ without performing a read-modify-write sequence of instructions.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/>  Though the bit-band is optional, it is less common to find a Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 microcontroller without it.  Some Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+ microcontrollers have bit-band. \n* Memory Protection Unit (MPU): Provides support for protecting regions of memory through enforcing privilege and access rules. It supports up to eight different regions, each of which can be split into a further eight equal-size sub-regions.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/>\n* Tightly-Coupled Memory (TCM): Low-latency RAM that is used to hold critical routines, data, stacks.  Other than cache, it is typically the fastest RAM in the microcontroller.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ <big>ARM Cortex-M optional components</big>\n|-\n! ARM Core !!

New Thumb-1 instructions were added as each legacy ARMv5 / ARMv6 / ARMv6T2 architectures were released. Some 16-bit Thumb-1 instructions were removed from the Cortex-M cores:\n* The \"BLX <immediate>\" instruction doesn't exist because it was used to switch from Thumb-1 to ARM instruction set.  The \"BLX <register>\" instruction is still available in the Cortex-M.\n* SETEND doesn't exist because on-the-fly switching of data endian mode is no longer supported.\n* Co-processor instructions were not supported on Cortex-M cores, until the silicon option was reintroduced in \"ARMv8-M Mainline\" for ARM Cortex-M33/M35P cores.\n* The SWI instruction was renamed to SVC, though the instruction binary coding is the same.

A documentation package for ARM chips typically consists of a collection of documents from the IC manufacturer as well as the CPU core vendor ([[Arm Holdings]]).\n\nA typical top-down documentation tree is:\n\n;Documentation tree (top to bottom)\n# IC manufacturer website.\n# IC manufacturer marketing slides.\n# IC manufacturer datasheet for the exact physical chip.\n# IC manufacturer reference manual that describes common peripherals and aspects of a physical chip family.\n# ARM core website.\n# ARM core generic user guide.\n# ARM core technical reference manual.\n# ARM architecture reference manual.\n\nIC manufacturers have additional documents, such as: evaluation board user manuals, application notes, getting started guides, software library documents, errata, and more.

Cortex-M cores are commonly used as dedicated microcontroller chips, but also are \"hidden\" inside of SoC chips as power management controllers, I/O controllers, system controllers, touch screen controllers, smart battery controllers, and sensors controllers.\n\nThough 8-bit microcontrollers were very popular in the past, Cortex-M has slowly been chipping away at the 8-bit market as the prices of low-end Cortex-M chips have moved downward.  Cortex-M have become a popular replacements for 8-bit chips in applications that benefit from 32-bit math operations, and replacing older legacy ARM cores such as [[ARM7]] and [[ARM9]].\n\n===License===\n[[Arm Holdings]] neither manufactures nor sells CPU devices based on its own designs, but rather licenses the processor architecture to interested parties. Arm offers a variety of licensing terms, varying in cost and deliverables. To all licensees, Arm provides an integratable hardware description of the ARM core, as well as complete software development toolset and the right to sell manufactured [[silicon]] containing the ARM CPU.\n\n===Silicon customization===\nIntegrated Device Manufacturers (IDM) receive the ARM Processor [[Intellectual property|IP]] as [[Logic synthesis|synthesizable]] [[Register transfer level|RTL]] (written in [[Verilog]]). In this form, they have the ability to perform architectural level optimizations and extensions. This allows the manufacturer to achieve custom design goals, such as higher clock speed, very low power consumption, instruction set extensions (including floating point), optimizations for size, debug support, etc.  To determine which components have been included in a particular Arm CPU chip, consult the manufacturer datasheet and related documentation.\n\nSome of the silicon options for the Cortex-M cores are:\n* SysTick timer: A 24-bit system timer that extends the functionality of both the processor and the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC). When present, it also provides an additional configurable priority SysTick interrupt.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/> Though the SysTick timer is optional, it is very rare to find a Cortex-M microcontroller without it.  If a Cortex-M33 microcontroller has the Security Extension option, then it has two SysTicks, one Secure and one Non-secure.\n* Bit-Band: Maps a complete word of memory onto a single bit in the bit-band region. For example, writing to an alias word will set or clear the corresponding bit in the bit-band region. This allows every individual bit in the bit-band region to be directly accessible from a word-aligned address. In particular, individual bits can be set, cleared, or toggled from C/C++ without performing a read-modify-write sequence of instructions.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/>  Though the bit-band is optional, it is less common to find a Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 microcontroller without it.  Some Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+ microcontrollers have bit-band. \n* Memory Protection Unit (MPU): Provides support for protecting regions of memory through enforcing privilege and access rules. It supports up to eight different regions, each of which can be split into a further eight equal-size sub-regions.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/>\n* Tightly-Coupled Memory (TCM): Low-latency RAM that is used to hold critical routines, data, stacks.  Other than cache, it is typically the fastest RAM in the microcontroller.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ <big>ARM Cortex-M optional components</big>\n|-\n! ARM Core !!

Legacy cores allowed \"on-the-fly\" changing of the data [[endianness|endian]] mode.\n* [[Coprocessor|Co-processor]] were not supported on Cortex-M cores, until the silicon option was reintroduced in \"ARMv8-M Mainline\" for ARM Cortex-M33/M35P cores.\n\nThe capabilities of the 32-bit ARM instruction set is duplicated in many ways by the Thumb-1 and Thumb-2 instruction sets, but some ARM features don't have a similar feature:\n* The SWP and SWPB (swap) ARM instructions don't have a similar feature in Cortex-M.\n\nThe 16-bit Thumb-1 instruction set has evolved over time since it was first released in the legacy [[ARM7|ARM7T]] cores with the ARMv4T architecture.  New Thumb-1 instructions were added as each legacy ARMv5 / ARMv6 / ARMv6T2 architectures were released. Some 16-bit Thumb-1 instructions were removed from the Cortex-M cores:\n* The \"BLX <immediate>\" instruction doesn't exist because it was used to switch from Thumb-1 to ARM instruction set.  The \"BLX <register>\" instruction is still available in the Cortex-M.\n* SETEND doesn't exist because on-the-fly switching of data endian mode is no longer supported.\n* Co-processor instructions were not supported on Cortex-M cores, until the silicon option was reintroduced in \"ARMv8-M Mainline\" for ARM Cortex-M33/M35P cores.\n* The SWI instruction was renamed to SVC, though the instruction binary coding is the same. However, the SVC handler code is different from the SWI handler code, because of changes to the exception models.\n\n==Cortex-M0==\n{{Infobox CPU\n|name = Cortex-M0\n|arch = [[ARM architecture#Thumb|Thumb-1]] (most),<br/>[[ARM architecture#Thumb-2|Thumb-2]] (some)\n|microarch = ARMv6-M\n}}\n\nThe Cortex-M0 core is optimized for small silicon die size and use in the lowest price chips.\n\nKey features of the Cortex-M0 core are:<ref name=\"M0-TRM\">[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0432c/DDI0432C_cortex_m0_r0p0_trm.pdf Cortex-M0 r0p0 Technical Reference Manual; Arm Holdings.]</ref>\n* ARMv6-M architecture<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/>\n* 3-stage [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]]\n* Instruction sets:\n** Thumb-1 (most), missing CBZ, CBNZ, IT\n** Thumb-2 (some), only BL, DMB, DSB, ISB, MRS, MSR\n** 32-bit hardware integer multiply with 32-bit result\n* 1 to 32 [[interrupt]]s, plus [[non-maskable interrupt|NMI]]\n\n'''Silicon options:'''\n* Hardware integer multiply speed: 1 or 32 cycles.\n\n===Chips===\nThe following microcontrollers are based on the Cortex-M0 core:\n* ABOV Semiconductor AC30M1x64\n* [[Cypress Semiconductor|Cypress]] PSoC 4000, 4100, 4100M, 4200, 4200DS, 4200L, 4200M \n* [[Infineon Technologies|Infineon]] [[Infineon XMC|XMC1100]], XMC1200, XMC1300, XMC1400, TLE984x\n*[[Dialog Semiconductor]] DA1458x, DA1468x\n* [[Nordic Semiconductor|Nordic]] [[nRF51]]\n* [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] [[LPC1100]], [[LPC1200]]\n* [[Nuvoton|nuvoTon]] NuMicro M0 Family\n* Sonix SN32F700\n* [[STMicroelectronics|ST]] [[STM32#STM32 F0|STM32 F0]]\n* [[Toshiba]] TX00\n* Vorago VA10800 (extreme temperature), VA10820 (radiation hardened)\n\nThe following chips have a Cortex-M0 as a secondary core:\n* [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] [[LPC4300]] (one Cortex-M4F + one Cortex-M0)\n* [[Texas Instruments]] SimpleLink Wireless MCUs CC1310 and CC2650 (one programmable Cortex-M3 + one Cortex-M0 network processor + one proprietary Sensor Controller Engine)\n\n==Cortex-M0+==\n{{Infobox CPU\n|name = Cortex-M0+\n|arch = [[ARM architecture#Thumb|Thumb-1 (most)]],<br/>[[ARM architecture#Thumb-2|Thumb-2 (some)]]\n|microarch = ARMv6-M\n}}\n[[File:Freescale FRDM-KL25Z board with KL25Z128VLK (ARM Cortex-M0+ MCU).JPG|thumb|right| [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] ([[Freescale]]) FRDM-KL25Z Board with KL25Z128VLK (Kinetis L)]]\nThe Cortex-M0+ is an optimized superset of the Cortex-M0.

In the past, 8-bit microcontroller documentation would typically fit in a single document, but as microcontrollers have evolved, so has everything required to support them.  A documentation package for ARM chips typically consists of a collection of documents from the IC manufacturer as well as the CPU core vendor ([[Arm Holdings]]).\n\nA typical top-down documentation tree is:\n\n;Documentation tree (top to bottom)\n# IC manufacturer website.\n# IC manufacturer marketing slides.\n# IC manufacturer datasheet for the exact physical chip.\n# IC manufacturer reference manual that describes common peripherals and aspects of a physical chip family.\n# ARM core website.\n# ARM core generic user guide.\n# ARM core technical reference manual.\n# ARM architecture reference manual.\n\nIC manufacturers have additional documents, such as: evaluation board user manuals, application notes, getting started guides, software library documents, errata, and more.

It was first aired on February 7, 2008, on ABC in the United States and on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] in Canada.<ref name=\"Ios0U\" />\n\nThe episode includes the first appearances of the main characters [[Miles Straume]] and [[Charlotte Lewis (Lost)|Charlotte Lewis]] and the supporting character [[Frank Lapidus]]. [[Ken Leung]] played Miles Straume, [[Rebecca Mader]] played Charlotte Lewis and [[Jeff Fahey]] played Frank Lapidus. The actors were given fake scenes when auditioning to limit the leak of story information or [[Spoiler (media)|spoiler]]s.  Mader and Fahey were different from the writers' visions of Charlotte and Frank, but the writers changed the characters to suit them.  Also, the role of Miles was changed for Leung. The episode was written by co-executive producer [[Drew Goddard]] and co-producer [[Brian K. Vaughan]] and directed by co-executive producer [[Stephen Williams (director)|Stephen Williams]].<ref name=\"press\" />\n\nThe beginning of the episode is set on December 21, 2004, or 91 days after the original characters crash-land on a tropical island from [[Oceanic Airlines]] Flight&nbsp;815. During the show, flashbacks introduce the island's latest arrivals&nbsp;\u2013 four people from an offshore freighter who landed on the island.  The main action is of [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]] ([[Terry O'Quinn]]) leading his group to the Barracks. He begins to find out why [[Ben Linus]] ([[Michael Emerson]]) is afraid of the newcomers. \"Confirmed Dead\" was watched by 17 million Americans and received generally positive critical reception as reviewers praised the introduction of the new characters.<ref name=\"adrjO\" />\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe episode's five flashbacks focus on the reactions and activities of the freighter's crew who made contact with the Oceanic 815 survivors; [[Daniel Faraday]] ([[Jeremy Davies]]) is shown crying while watching a newscast confirming the deaths of all Oceanic 815 passengers. His caretaker asks why he is crying, and he answers that he does not know. [[Miles Straume]] ([[Ken Leung]]) is a [[mediumship|medium]] hired by an elderly woman to remove the ghost of her grandson from her home. After conversing with the spirit, Miles finds a hidden cache of money and drugs. [[List of Lost characters|Charlotte Lewis]] ([[Rebecca Mader]]) is an [[anthropologist]] who finds a polar bear skeleton bearing a [[Dharma Initiative]] collar buried in the Tunisian desert. [[Frank Lapidus]] ([[Jeff Fahey]]) is an alcoholic who was originally scheduled to pilot flight 815. He phones the Oceanic hotline while watching the newscast and claims that the footage of the plane wreckage being aired on television is not authentic, while [[Naomi Dorrit]] ([[Marsha Thomason]]) is shown in a posthumous flashback, criticizing her employer [[List of Lost characters#Matthew Abaddon|Matthew Abaddon]] ([[Lance Reddick]]) for his choice in her coworkers.<ref name=\"episode\" />\n\nAfter Daniel parachutes from a failing helicopter onto the island, he uses Naomi's phone to contact [[List of Lost characters#George Minkowski|George Minkowski]] ([[Fisher Stevens]]) on the ship that he came from.<ref name=\"eDfVT\" /> The next morning, on December 22, 2004, two of the flight 815 survivors \u2013 [[Jack Shephard]] ([[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]]) and [[Kate Austen]] ([[Evangeline Lilly]]) \u2013 help Daniel find his colleagues, as the rival group led by Locke attempts to do the same. Jack and Kate find Miles, who demands to see Naomi's body, and reasons that Naomi was killed by Kate as Naomi said a code on the phone before dying. Kate confesses then that Naomi was killed by John Locke. Locke's group finds Charlotte, takes her prisoner, and disposes of her tracking device. Daniel's third colleague, helicopter pilot Frank, fires a flare into the sky, leading Jack's group to him. Frank tells Jack's group that he managed to land the helicopter intact. After finding out that [[Juliet Burke]] ([[Elizabeth Mitchell]]) is one of the [[Others (Lost)|Others]], Miles demands to know where [[Ben Linus|Ben]] ([[Michael Emerson]]) is, as locating him is the freighter crew's primary objective.<ref name=\"episode\" /> In Locke's group, several people become discontent with Locke's revelation that he is following the instructions of [[Walt Lloyd]] ([[Malcolm David Kelley]]), who had left the island a month earlier,<ref name=\"paym3\" /> and they also question why Ben is being kept alive. Locke holds him at gunpoint, and Ben starts to reveal information about the ''Kahana'' crew, specifically Charlotte's identity and that he has a spy aboard the ship.<ref name=\"episode\" />\n\n== Production ==\n\n[[File:Jeff Fahey.jpg|thumb|right|Fahey in 2004 without a beard]]\n\nWhile casting the \"freighter folk\"&nbsp;\u2013 the nickname that ''Lost''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s executive producers/writers/[[show runner]]s [[Damon Lindelof]] and [[Carlton Cuse]] use to refer to Daniel, Charlotte, Miles and Frank<ref name=\"ew\" />&nbsp;\u2013 fake names, occupations and scenes were temporarily assigned, to limit the leak of [[Spoiler (media)|spoiler]]s.<ref name=\"0xDHj\" />  After seeing Ken Leung [[Remember When (The Sopranos episode)|guest star]] on [[HBO]]'s ''[[The Sopranos]]'' in April 2007, Lindelof and Cuse wrote the role of Miles specifically for him,<ref name=\"VPeFG\" /> although it was initially reported that Leung would be playing the part of \"brilliant mathematician\" \"Russell\".<ref name=\"GCPRE\" />  The name Miles Straume was simply chosen because the writer-producers thought that \"it would be cool if his name sounded like '[[maelstrom]]{{'\"}}.<ref name=\"ew\" />  Had he not taken the part, Lindelof and Cuse claim that Miles would have been scrapped and a new and very different character would have been written into the story instead.  Leung, who was originally contracted as a recurring guest star, was quoted as saying that \"Miles doesn't know how to be social, which is great, because I don't know how to be social.\"<ref name=\"JlFkO\" />  Costume designer Roland Sanchez wanted to base one of the freighter folk's clothing after that of [[Keith Richards]], specifically a picture in which he wore a sleeveless vest, which he admired.  Sanchez believed that Miles fitted the haggard look and bought an [[Armani#Armani Exchange|Armani Exchange]] jacket, cut off the sleeves and added a hood, and that this outfit helped Leung to develop Miles.<ref name=\"HR4hv\" />  Co-executive producer/writer [[Edward Kitsis]] had been pitching the name \"Lapidus\" for years, finally naming an unseen character in the [[Expos\u00e9 (Lost)|fourteenth episode of the third season]] Rick Lapidus.<ref name=\"QECXy\" />   Unsatisfied, Kitsis developed the character \"Frank Lapidus, Helicopter Pilot\".<ref name=\"ew\" />  According to the show runners, recurring guest star Jeff Fahey \"was the first and only choice for the role\".  They also commended his \"intense eyes\" and stated that \"he has exactly the right sensibilities\" for the part.<ref name=\"ofKRE\" />  Frank was not envisioned with a beard, however, the writer-producers allowed Fahey to keep it for the role.  The writer-producers have said that Frank \"never takes anything at face value [and is] a true conspiracy nut [who] has probably seen every episode of ''[[The X-Files]]'', [which will] pay off for him\".<ref name=\"3SfG3\" />\n\nRebecca Mader's audition scene was a fake flashback and she was disappointed that it was not used for the show.<ref name=\"BJ3NC\" />  The character's name was spoiled months in advance of broadcast.  Charlotte was originally envisioned as an American;<ref name=\"MLBYO\" /> however, the writers preferred Mader's natural English accent to her fake American accent and they changed Charlotte accordingly.  ''Lost''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s writer-producers compared Mader to \"a young [[Nicole Kidman]]\".<ref name=\"oKrP2\" />  During the casting process, Charlotte was described as a \"successful academic\".<ref name=\"R5e2P\" />  It was falsely rumored that [[Kristen Bell]] was offered the role of Charlotte;<ref name=\"TxQyu\" /> Bell had actually spoken to the producers about having a part; however, no role was offered to her.<ref name=\"hwqKz\" />  Despite never having seen ''Lost'', Mader decided that she \"was not going to leave [the auditioning] room until [she] made [Lindelof and Cuse] fall in love with [her]\".<ref name=\"nubSb\" />  Mader subsequently began to watch the first three seasons of ''Lost'' and was watching the [[Walkabout (Lost)|fourth episode]] when she received the news that she had been chosen for the role.<ref name=\"ugo\" />  In the next two to three weeks, Mader&nbsp;\u2013 who was then signed on as a recurring guest star&nbsp;\u2013 watched the rest of the first three seasons, watching the [[Through the Looking Glass (Lost)|third-season finale]] a matter of hours before she began shooting her first \"Confirmed Dead\" scene, in which Charlotte meets Locke and his group.  Mader was told little about her character by the writer-producers, except that \"she was sort of like a female [[Indiana Jones]] type\".  Mader has found it challenging but fun to play a character with an unknown backstory and motives.  Charlotte's full name is Charlotte Staples Lewis, which is an homage to the author [[C. S. Lewis|C.S. Lewis]], best known for ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' and various books about [[Christianity]].  Lewis was one of Mader's favorite authors as a child and found it \"wicked\" and \"cool\" for her character to be named after him.<ref name=\"V2uTw\" />  Mader also enjoyed that she only requires a small amount of hair and makeup done, saying that \"I just wanted to rough it.  I wanted to roll around in the mud with a gun.\"<ref name=\"xHzK0\" />  Mader claims that she has \"never had so much fun in [her] life\" as when she is shooting ''Lost''.<ref name=\"3LIjh\" /> In the episode, Charlotte's birthday is said to be July 2, 1979. This led to a minor continuity error in the fifth-season episode \"[[LaFleur (Lost)|LaFleur]]\", when Charlotte is depicted as being a little girl in 1974. Executive producers Cuse and Lindelof claimed in a podcast that the original script for \"Confirmed Dead\" listed Charlotte's birthday as being in 1970 and that Mader had it changed because she did not want people to think she was significantly older than she actually is. This caused a controversy when Mader later stated on her blog that Gregg Nations, the script coordinator, was the one who suggested the change. Cuse and Lindelof later conceded that she was right.<ref name=\"k3VYE\" /><ref name=\"EXBaQ\" />\n\nMost or all of the episode was shot from September 11<ref name=\"duhMl\" /> to 23, 2007<ref name=\"WTdbb\" /> and filming overlapped with the [[The Economist (Lost)|following episode]].<ref name=\"oL7kT\" />  The Tunisian desert scene was filmed on location in [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]], like the rest of the episode, at a stone quarry with industrial fans blowing fake sand.<ref name=\"ugo\" />  A typical ''Lost'' episode contains fifty [[visual effects]] shots.  Among scenes created entirely or partially with effects are the opening scene of \"Confirmed Dead\", which shows what appears to be the wreckage of 815 underwater and the scene from Daniel's perspective as he parachutes from the helicopter to the ground.  In Frank's flashback, he drops a toy plane, which spirals into a small aquarium.  This shot was not intended to use effects; however, \"it's impossible to get a toy plane to spiral the way you want it to\", according to supervisor Mitch Suskin.  A tank with still water and rocks on the bottom was filmed and the plane was added in editing.  Suskin said that creating effects for \"Confirmed Dead\" \"was slightly too leisurely\" because the episode aired over four months after post-production began.<ref name=\"dkxf9\" />\n\nIn fall 2007, ''Lost''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s writers presented ABC executives with the story that a salvage vessel called the ''Christiane I'' looking for the ''[[Exodus (Lost)|Black Rock]]'', among other things, in the [[Sunda Trench]] would come across what would appear to be the wreckage of 815.  ABC hired the Australian company Hoodlum to design a $3&nbsp;million [[viral marketing]] [[alternate reality game]] (ARG) titled ''[[Find 815]]''.<ref name=\"dboLH\" />  ''Find 815'' ran from December 28, 2007 to January 31, 2008, beginning with a press release issued from ABC Medianet announcing the fictitious return of the fictional Oceanic Airlines' return to business.<ref name=\"HNPF9\" />  The ARG&nbsp;\u2013 apparently the largest ever&nbsp;\u2013 followed Sam Thomas, an Oceanic technician who had lost his girlfriend in the crash, as he received cryptic e-mails from ''The Maxwell Group'' (a division of [[List of Lost characters#Widmore and employees|Widmore]] Industries, but nonexistent in ''Lost''), joined the crew of the ''Christiane I'' and ultimately uncovered 815.<ref name=\"K7yS2\" />  Because ''Find 815'' was produced separately from the show and without the show's writers, it contradicts events in the TV series.<ref name=\"o71gv\" />  In \"Confirmed Dead\", 815 is found by a man not present in the game named Ron; Thomas is not mentioned.  Lindelof and Cuse dismissed the game as not being [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] (not containing genuine information within the [[fictional universe]]) and was largely just a bonus for fans during the between-seasons hiatus.<ref name=\"UqblE\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\"Confirmed Dead\" was watched by 15.292&nbsp;million American viewers live or recorded and watched within six hours of broadcast, ranking ''Lost'' seventh in the weekly chart.<ref name=\"0gNqc\" />  It was watched by a total of 16.963&nbsp;million viewers, including those who watched within seven days of broadcast; this number went toward the year-end season average.<ref name=\"RVVQw\" />  The episode received a 6.5/16 in the key adults 18\u201349 demographic.<ref name=\"cpfbP\" />  In Canada, it ranked sixth for the week with 1.702&nbsp;million viewers.<ref name=\"mpyDi\" />  In the [[United Kingdom]], ''Lost'' was watched by 1.2&nbsp;million viewers&nbsp;\u2013 a larger audience than that of the season premiere.<ref name=\"NYnHV\" />  In Australia, \"Confirmed Dead\" brought in 853,000 viewers, ranking seventy-first for the week.<ref name=\"HW7mA\" />  American critics were sent screener DVDs of \"The Beginning of the End\" and \"Confirmed Dead\" on January 28, 2008 with instructions not to reveal major plot points in reviews.  Among the journalists who gave vague and positive reviews were Mary McNamara of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'',<ref name=\"PQ15k\" /> Adam Buckman of the ''[[New York Post]]'',<ref name=\"zCPEO\" /> Maureen Ryan of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'',<ref name=\"yowdg\" /> Diane Werts of ''[[Newsday]]''<ref name=\"WoCuw\" /> and Tim Goodman of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.<ref name=\"NYBtk\" />  According to Oscar Dahl of [[BuddyTV]], \"Confirmed Dead\" \"was met with almost universal love from the ''Lost'' fan base\"<ref name=\"foh1x\" /> and according to Jon Lachonis of ''[[UGO Networks|UGO]]'', the new characters were well received by the fan scene.<ref name=\"ugo\" />\n\nAlan Sepinwall of ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' wrote that \"after an underwhelming pre-credits sequence&nbsp;... this sucker moved, and lots of things happened.  We met our four new regulars, squeezed in useful flashbacks about [them] and even found out the real reason they're on the island&nbsp; ... The flipside of all this business is that 'Confirmed Dead' didn't have the same emotional resonance as '[The] Beginning of the End'&nbsp;... but you clearly can't have everything in every episode.\"<ref name=\"IYNQF\" />  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s James Poniewozik said that \"What amazed [him] about this episode was the economy and precision with which it introduced&nbsp;... the crew of the downed chopper from [the freighter].  Each got just one flashback and a little time on the island, and yet by the end of the episode, I felt I had a true handle on what they were like as individuals.\"<ref name=\"8jrnQ\" />  Jeff Jensen of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' thought that \"Confirmed Dead\" \"was downright alive with fascinating new characters, mind-blowing new possibilities, and exciting new theory fodder\"; however, he had heard complaints from others who received the preview screeners that they found the episode to be flawed.  They considered the scene where 815 is found to be cheating the flashback formula because Daniel only experiences it by watching it on television, Frank's safe landing of the helicopter to be a mystery, Naomi's flashback to be cheating ''Lost'' rules because she is dead and Ben's manipulation of Locke to be an overused storyline.<ref name=\"vu6s6\" />  [[E!]]'s [[Kristin Dos Santos]] exclaimed \"hot damn!\" in response to the scene where 815 is found in the Sunda Trench.  She also thought that \"Juliet and Kate giggling at Jack's 'wink thing' was hilarious\" and it was \"awesome to see [the pilot] again\".<ref name=\"Wcm3Z\" />  Nikki Stafford of ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' highlighted \"watching Dan's landing from his point of view.  You can feel his panic as he's free-falling through the air, looks up at his parachute, looks down to see himself about to hit the trees&nbsp;... it was amazing.\"<ref name=\"hwiyA\" />  [[IGN]]'s Chris Carabott gave \"Confirmed Dead\" an 8/10, writing that it \"isn't a disappointing episode by any means but it definitely suffers from being a 'setup' episode for these four new characters\" and praising the new actors by writing that \"Leung does an adequate job of getting Miles' arrogant brand of confidence across while Davies presents Faraday's awkward mannerisms well.  Fahey's Lapidus has exceptional screen presence that even overshadows the regular cast members to an extent.\"<ref name=\"DnskE\" />  Erin Martell of [[AOL]]'s [[TV Squad]] said that \"Watching 'Confirmed Dead' was like watching my dream episode of ''Lost'' [because] people asked direct questions for once&nbsp;... [and] this episode was all about the Freighties.\"<ref name=\"Lj4D1\" />  A day after the original broadcast, BuddyTV's Dahl claimed that \"[the audience is] on an epic journey, one that has been as entertaining and engrossing as any TV series has ever been\".<ref name=\"Nj2cZ\" /> In contrast, ''[[TV Guide]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Michael Ausiello]] of  said that it \"was thirty-one flavors of awesome&nbsp;... [however] the negatives outweighed the positives\".  He had problems with Claire's lack of grief for [[Charlie Pace]]'s ([[Dominic Monaghan]]) death and Jack waiting so long to find out the freighter folk's main objective.<ref name=\"FRwRG\" />  Ben Rawson-Jones of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' gave \"Confirmed Dead\" three out of five stars, calling it \"so-so\", but commenting that \"the new revelations in the episode are fairly startling and provide a momentary distraction from the frustrations.\"<ref name=\"gnVTf\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|1=30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"press\">''[[ABC Studios|ABC Medianet]]'', (January 18, 2008) \"[http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=011808_12 Four Strangers Arrive on the Island, Leading the Survivors to Question the Intentions of Their Supposed Rescuers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212115500/http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=011808_12 |date=2013-12-12}}\".

In Frank's flashback, he drops a toy plane, which spirals into a small aquarium.  This shot was not intended to use effects; however, \"it's impossible to get a toy plane to spiral the way you want it to\", according to supervisor Mitch Suskin.  A tank with still water and rocks on the bottom was filmed and the plane was added in editing.  Suskin said that creating effects for \"Confirmed Dead\" \"was slightly too leisurely\" because the episode aired over four months after post-production began.<ref>Raugust, Karen, (March 4, 2008) \"[http://vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3568 ''Lost'': Season 4&nbsp;\u2013 VFX Interrupts]\", VFXWorld.
