For example, senior constable and sergeant ranks are plastic ranks on the sleeve of the uniform. SDU, Marine Police, and the Counterterrorism Response Unit have their ranks at the back of the helmet or vest. Inspector to senior superintendent ranks have an insignia on the collar of the uniform. Superintendents also have a white stripe fitted on the police hat. Chief Superintendents and up have a white stripe on their hats, a slide with a silver vertical line on the collar of the uniform, a black baton, and a red whistle or a black and white whistle on the front right pocket.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Uniforms==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2019}}\n{{multiple image\n| align  = right\n| footer = Police officers in summer uniform in 1954.

The older khaki uniforms were used for many decades. Hong Kong Police Force uniform currently comprises:\n\nUniform Branch: Dark navy blue jacket with the words 'Police', in English and Chinese, in reflective white tape, on the front left breast and back. Light blue shirts are worn by most officers, whilst white shirts are worn by senior officers. Dark blue cargo trousers and black caps are worn by all officers.\n\nTactical Units: these uniforms are identical to those of the Uniform Branch officers, although berets are worn rather than caps and trousers are tucked into boots. Riot helmets are worn for riot control.\n*[[Disruptive Pattern Material]] (e.g. SBD and SDU)\n*[[Battle Dress Uniform]] (e.g. SDU)\n\nTraffic branch: Reflective yellow jacket and navy blue riding trousers. In warmer weather, reflective vests with white sleeves are an alternative.\n\nFrom the return of HKPF, all patrol officers and inspectors had their whistle taken off. The same summer uniform and winter uniform was worn until 2005.\n\nSenior Constable, Sergeant and Station Sergeant ranks had their ranks moved to their shoulder slides.\n\n===Ceremonial uniform===\nThey are white (similar to [[Uniforms of the British Army#No.3: Warm weather ceremonial uniform|No.3 Warm weather ceremonial uniform]]) or dark tunic. [[Ceremonial weapon|Sword design]] was based on [[Pattern 1897 infantry officer's sword|1897 pattern]] [[British Army]] infantry officer's sword and used for formal occasions such as parade out or [[Legal Opening Day]]. They are fitted with a black whistle on the front right pocket and insignia on the collar for commissioned officers. A Sam Browne belt is worn too.\n\n===Retired uniforms===\nSummer Uniform: Green [[Khaki drill]] tropical shirts and trousers or [[Bermuda shorts]], worn with black [[Sam Browne Belt]]s. Females wore summer beige shirts with skirts. This uniform was worn until about 2005 when the force switched to a slightly modernized version of the Winter Uniform, to be worn all year round. The Green uniform can be seen in some of the older Hong Kong and Hollywood movies.\n\nWinter Uniform: [[Cornflower blue]] (or white, for commissioned officers) shirts with necktie, worn under a navy blue tunic and Sam Browne Belt, with navy blue uniform trousers. Tunic may be removed under warmer weather.\n\nUntil 1998, all officers wore a whistle lanyard over the left shoulder running under the epaulet with the double cord attached to a whistle tucked in to the left breast tunic pocket. Uniform colour was black, however officers who had received a Commissioner of Police Commendation, or HE Governor's Commendation, were issued with and could wear a plaited black, yellow and red (Force colours) lanyard (for CP's Commendation) or red for Governor's.\n<ref>https://www.police.gov.hk/offbeat/617/letter.html</ref><ref>http://gmic.co.uk/topic/42758-commisioner39s-commendations/</ref>\n\n==Vehicles==\n{{Main|Police vehicles in Hong Kong}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Police cars on Chater Road on 2014-10-13.JPG|thumb|200px|Police cars on a road in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]]]]\n[[File:HKPF Police Patrol BoatNo.63.JPG|thumb|200px|HKPF Police Patrol Boat]]\n\nMost police vehicles in Hong Kong are white, with a blue and red [[3M]] [[retroreflective]] stripe around on the sides of the vehicle with wording \"\u8b66 Police \u5bdf\" in white, the only exception being the [[armoured personnel carrier]]s specially designed for the [[Police Tactical Unit (Hong Kong)|Police Tactical Unit]], which are wholly dark blue and with wording \"\u8b66 Police \u5bdf\" on a light blue background in white on the sides of the vehicle.

All police vehicles are government property and so bear licence plates starting with \"AM\".\n\nSince 2008, the Hong Kong Police Force have brought in the use of [[Battenburg markings]] for new police vehicles of the Traffic Branch Headquarters. In addition, these new vehicles show the Force crest on the front part of the vehicle, which the Force has not used in the design of new vehicles for the last two decades.\n\nThe Hong Kong Police Force has ordered 10 new electric scooters for their officers to help reduce pollution in central Hong Kong. Emergency Unit, Police Tactical Unit, and Traffic Police have identification markings on the back of the car (no motorcycles of Traffic Police), for example, PTUD 1/3. This means PTU D Team 1st Team 3rd car. EU is like this: EUKW 23. EU means Emergency Unit, KW means Kowloon West, and 23 means the 23rd car of the Kowloon Emergency Unit.

For example, senior constable and sergeant ranks are plastic ranks on the sleeve of the uniform. SDU, Marine Police, and the Counterterrorism Response Unit have their ranks at the back of the helmet or vest. Inspector to senior superintendent ranks have an insignia on the collar of the uniform. Superintendents also have a white stripe fitted on the police hat. Chief Superintendents and up have a white stripe on their hats, a slide with a silver vertical line on the collar of the uniform, a black baton, and a red whistle or a black and white whistle on the front right pocket.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Uniforms==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2019}}\n{{multiple image\n| align  = right\n| footer = Police officers in summer uniform in 1954.

The older khaki uniforms were used for many decades. Hong Kong Police Force uniform currently comprises:\n\nUniform Branch: Dark navy blue jacket with the words 'Police', in English and Chinese, in reflective white tape, on the front left breast and back. Light blue shirts are worn by most officers, whilst white shirts are worn by senior officers. Dark blue cargo trousers and black caps are worn by all officers.\n\nTactical Units: these uniforms are identical to those of the Uniform Branch officers, although berets are worn rather than caps and trousers are tucked into boots. Riot helmets are worn for riot control.\n*[[Disruptive Pattern Material]] (e.g. SBD and SDU)\n*[[Battle Dress Uniform]] (e.g. SDU)\n\nTraffic branch: Reflective yellow jacket and navy blue riding trousers. In warmer weather, reflective vests with white sleeves are an alternative.\n\nFrom the return of HKPF, all patrol officers and inspectors had their whistle taken off. The same summer uniform and winter uniform was worn until 2005.\n\nSenior Constable, Sergeant and Station Sergeant ranks had their ranks moved to their shoulder slides.\n\n===Ceremonial uniform===\nThey are white (similar to [[Uniforms of the British Army#No.3: Warm weather ceremonial uniform|No.3 Warm weather ceremonial uniform]]) or dark tunic. [[Ceremonial weapon|Sword design]] was based on [[Pattern 1897 infantry officer's sword|1897 pattern]] [[British Army]] infantry officer's sword and used for formal occasions such as parade out or [[Legal Opening Day]]. They are fitted with a black whistle on the front right pocket and insignia on the collar for commissioned officers. A Sam Browne belt is worn too.\n\n===Retired uniforms===\nSummer Uniform: Green [[Khaki drill]] tropical shirts and trousers or [[Bermuda shorts]], worn with black [[Sam Browne Belt]]s. Females wore summer beige shirts with skirts. This uniform was worn until about 2005 when the force switched to a slightly modernized version of the Winter Uniform, to be worn all year round. The Green uniform can be seen in some of the older Hong Kong and Hollywood movies.\n\nWinter Uniform: [[Cornflower blue]] (or white, for commissioned officers) shirts with necktie, worn under a navy blue tunic and Sam Browne Belt, with navy blue uniform trousers. Tunic may be removed under warmer weather.\n\nUntil 1998, all officers wore a whistle lanyard over the left shoulder running under the epaulet with the double cord attached to a whistle tucked in to the left breast tunic pocket. Uniform colour was black, however officers who had received a Commissioner of Police Commendation, or HE Governor's Commendation, were issued with and could wear a plaited black, yellow and red (Force colours) lanyard (for CP's Commendation) or red for Governor's.\n<ref>https://www.police.gov.hk/offbeat/617/letter.html</ref><ref>http://gmic.co.uk/topic/42758-commisioner39s-commendations/</ref>\n\n==Vehicles==\n{{Main|Police vehicles in Hong Kong}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Police cars on Chater Road on 2014-10-13.JPG|thumb|200px|Police cars on a road in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]]]]\n[[File:HKPF Police Patrol BoatNo.63.JPG|thumb|200px|HKPF Police Patrol Boat]]\n\nMost police vehicles in Hong Kong are white, with a blue and red [[3M]] [[retroreflective]] stripe around on the sides of the vehicle with wording \"\u8b66 Police \u5bdf\" in white, the only exception being the [[armoured personnel carrier]]s specially designed for the [[Police Tactical Unit (Hong Kong)|Police Tactical Unit]], which are wholly dark blue and with wording \"\u8b66 Police \u5bdf\" on a light blue background in white on the sides of the vehicle. Most police vehicles in Hong Kong are equipped with both red and blue [[emergency vehicle lighting]]. The vehicles which are assigned to [[Hong Kong International Airport|airport]] duties have additional yellow emergency vehicle lighting. All police vehicles are government property and so bear licence plates starting with \"AM\".\n\nSince 2008, the Hong Kong Police Force have brought in the use of [[Battenburg markings]] for new police vehicles of the Traffic Branch Headquarters. In addition, these new vehicles show the Force crest on the front part of the vehicle, which the Force has not used in the design of new vehicles for the last two decades.\n\nThe Hong Kong Police Force has ordered 10 new electric scooters for their officers to help reduce pollution in central Hong Kong. Emergency Unit, Police Tactical Unit, and Traffic Police have identification markings on the back of the car (no motorcycles of Traffic Police), for example, PTUD 1/3. This means PTU D Team 1st Team 3rd car. EU is like this: EUKW 23. EU means Emergency Unit, KW means Kowloon West, and 23 means the 23rd car of the Kowloon Emergency Unit. Traffic Police cars include TKW 2. T means Traffic Police, KW means Kowloon West, and 2 means the second car of the Kowloon West Traffic Unit.

Although located in Germany, the school follows a traditional U.S. curriculum and traditional U.S. school activities.\n\n==History==\n\n==== 1940s ====\nWiesbaden High School was established in 1948 using a former German school building on Lahnstrasse. Prior to its opening, American high school students in Wiesbaden attended high school in [[Frankfurt American High School|Frankfurt]]. The initial school population was 56 students and nine faculty members. In 1949\u201350, the school was named '''General H.H. Arnold High School''' after [[Henry H. Arnold]], [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] and [[General of the Air Force]] during and immediately after [[World War II]]. The [[Berlin Blockade]] (Berlin Airlift) which started in Wiesbaden <ref>http://www.wiesbaden.army.mil/sites/about/history.asp</ref> coincided with the opening of the school, with many of the students\u2019 parents involved. \n\n==== 1950s ====\nIn January 1955, the school moved from Lahnstrasse to its present location on Texasstra\u00dfe just outside the Wiesbaden city limits. Students from outlying communities lived in dormitories during the school week. Later, students from [[Rhein Main Air Base]] and the [[Darmstadt]] Military community were bused to the school until the closure of these military facilities. \n\n==== 1960s / 1970s ====\nBy the 1970s the school population was up to 1800 students, recording its peak (1,809) the '72-'73 school year.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dodea.edu/WiesbadenHS/about.cfm|title=About Our School|last=Communications|first=DoDEA|website=www.dodea.edu|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> \n\n==== 1980s / 1990s ====\nAt the end of the 1980s the school's population was over 850 and nearly all students were either Air Force or Army [[Military dependent|dependents]], few others were children of [[United States federal civil service|DoD civilians]] or [[Expatriate|expatriates]]. After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] on November 9, 1989, and subsequent collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] and [[Soviet Union]], the [[Cold War]] effectively ended December 25, 1991. The student body began to decline rapidly as U.S. forces drew down their presence in Europe. By 1993, the student population dropped below 500 with the closure of numerous regional installations, including the USAF Wiesbaden Hospital, [[Europaviertel (Wiesbaden)|Lindsey Air Station]], Mainz Army Depot, [[Lee Barracks]], and Camp Pieri.<ref>{{Cite web|url=file:///C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Wikipedia%20Articles/Warriors%20newsletterWinter2018.pdf|title=Warrior Gazzette, December 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Wiesbaden High School / Gen.

The campus has remained behind enhanced [[physical security]] measures ever since. The school's populace increased to 600 students by 2005.<ref name=\":4\" />  In 2006 the school was officially renamed Wiesbaden High School. Despite the change, its historical name of 57 years, Gen.

The school's post-[[Cold War]] transformation also resulted in a reversal of key demographics, with Army [[Military dependent|dependents]] becoming the school's majority and Air Force [[Military dependent|dependents]] in the minority. This reality led to an eventual change of the school's [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|JROTC]] program, from Air Force to Army. Wiesbaden's long-standing Air Force [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|JROTC]] program had been one of only four in Germany, and seven in Europe.     \n\n==== 2010s ====\nBy 2010, a multi-phased transformation of the 55-year-old campus had already begun. Demolition began with the iconic space station-like Dependent Youth Activities (DYA) building, who's futuristic profile stood prominently next to the football field. It was a recreational facility that provided a lunchtime hangout and alternative eatery to the cafeteria. From 2011 to 2014, select buildings were eliminated and added, ushering the new gym, a specialized curriculum building, and multi-purpose building.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://wiesbadenhigh.com/WiesbadenWarriors/Newsletters/July2012WarriorNewsletterSample.pdf|title=Wiesbaden Warriors Newsletter, July 2012|last=|first=|date=|website=Wiesbaden Warriors Alumni Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> By summer of 2017, the three-story main building was completed, making Wiesbaden High School the first 21st century-designed High School in DoDEA-Europe.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/dodea-s-first-21st-century-school-gets-kudos-at-official-opening-1.487609|title=DODEA\u2019s first \u201821st-century school\u2019 gets kudos at official opening|website=Stars and Stripes|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> The graduating class of 2018 was the first to graduate using the fully-completed facility.

Arnold High School Crest.png|thumb|The General H. H. Arnold High School crest, an icon of the school's traditions and lore.]]\n'''Protecting the school crest''' is arguably the most unique tradition remembered by school alumni. Although there are variants of the crest's lore, a general take is that no one was allowed to walk on the school crest, and it was the seniors' responsibility to enforce it. This 'rule' was essential because 'the warrior' was buried beneath the crest and if anyone were to walk on it, his spirit would turn over. If that occurred, it was considered bad luck and the probable cause of losing any football game. During some periods of the school's history, it was acceptable for seniors to walk on the crest, a earned privilege.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 2005, at the conclusion of First Lady, Laura Bush's, message to 400 assembled 'Warriors,' she remarked, \"And there is one more important bit of advice I forgot to mention, and this is especially important for the lower class men: Whatever you do, don't walk on the Crest.\"<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/strong-family-base-at-home-important-for-deployed-troops-first-lady-tells-students-1.29799|title=Strong family base at home important for deployed troops, first lady tells students|website=Stars and Stripes|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>     \n\nThe crest was embedded into the floor of the main foyer during the '69/'70 school year.<ref name=\":2\" /> It comprises a mosaic-tiled blue shield with a black and red outline, featuring the school's symbolic profile of warrior with [[War bonnet|headdress]] and the school's former name (H H Arnold High School). The entire inlay (with border frame) is approximately 4' x 5'. The crest was carefully removed during the 2010-2017 campus transformation. The crest has been prominently displayed in the school's new facilities since 2017.    \n\n'''Graduating in the [[Kurhaus, Wiesbaden|Kurhaus]]''' is a special honor for those who earn a diploma from this school. Graduates have had the privilege of celebrating their milestone within the [[Kurhaus, Wiesbaden|Kurhaus]]' palace-like splendor, a tradition carried almost as long as the school has existed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/22385/wiesbaden_high_graduates_mark_rite_of_passage_in_historic_german_kurhaus|title=Wiesbaden High graduates mark rite of passage in historic German Kurhaus|website=www.army.mil|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>  \n\n'''The homecoming Bonfire''' was an anticipated feature of homecoming weekends, thought to recharge the spirit of the Warriors' teams.

H. Arnold High School is prominently featured in [[Larry Collins (writer)|Larry Collins]]' 1989 fictional [[Cold War]] spy thriller, ''Maze''. Several pages detail student interactions and traditional events at the school. The novel describes the school's annual homecoming bonfire, on a Friday night before the football team plays rival [[Frankfurt American High School|Frankfurt High School]]. Cheerleaders lead the spirited event for a crowd of nearly 2,000 spectators. The school's most significant moment in the story is when a car bomb is detonated in the school's parking lot, leveling half of the gym. The terrorist attack at the school puts the nation on edge, adding fuel to the existing tensions between [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and [[Moscow]]. The school is referred to at least a dozen times by the names: General H. H. Arnold High School, Arnold High School, and the Wiesbaden High School. \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.dodea.edu/WiesbadenHS/ Wiesbaden High School]\n**[http://generalhharnold.ning.com/''' General H.

Arnold High School Crest.png|thumb|The General H. H. Arnold High School crest, an icon of the school's traditions and lore.]]\n'''Protecting the school crest''' is arguably the most unique tradition remembered by school alumni. Although there are variants of the crest's lore, a general take is that no one was allowed to walk on the school crest, and it was the seniors' responsibility to enforce it. This 'rule' was essential because 'the warrior' was buried beneath the crest and if anyone were to walk on it, his spirit would turn over. If that occurred, it was considered bad luck and the probable cause of losing any football game. During some periods of the school's history, it was acceptable for seniors to walk on the crest, a earned privilege.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 2005, at the conclusion of First Lady, Laura Bush's, message to 400 assembled 'Warriors,' she remarked, \"And there is one more important bit of advice I forgot to mention, and this is especially important for the lower class men: Whatever you do, don't walk on the Crest.\"<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/strong-family-base-at-home-important-for-deployed-troops-first-lady-tells-students-1.29799|title=Strong family base at home important for deployed troops, first lady tells students|website=Stars and Stripes|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>     \n\nThe crest was embedded into the floor of the main foyer during the '69/'70 school year.<ref name=\":2\" /> It comprises a mosaic-tiled blue shield with a black and red outline, featuring the school's symbolic profile of warrior with [[War bonnet|headdress]] and the school's former name (H H Arnold High School).

Increased restrictions and labeling of cannabis as a poison began in many states from 1906 onward, and outright prohibitions began in the 1920s. By the mid-1930s cannabis was regulated as a drug in every state, including 35 states that adopted the [[Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act]].<ref name=\"druglibrary.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/vlr/vlr3.htm |title=Richard J.

Multiple efforts to [[Removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act|reschedule cannabis]] under the CSA have failed, and the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative]]'' and ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' that the federal government has a right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, even for medical purposes.  Despite this, states and other jurisdictions have continued to implement policies that conflict with federal law, beginning with the passage of California's [[California Proposition 215 (1996)|Proposition 215]] in 1996.

Poison laws generally either required labels on the packaging indicating the harmful effects of the drugs or prohibited sale outside of licensed pharmacies and without a doctor's prescription.

The new revisions aimed to restrict all narcotics, including cannabis, as poisons, limit their sale to pharmacies, and require doctor's prescriptions. The first instance was in the [[District of Columbia]] in 1906, under \"An act to regulate the practice of pharmacy and the sale of poisons in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes\". The act was updated in 1938 to the Federal Pure Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act of 1938 which remains in effect even today, creating a legal paradox for federal sentencing. Under this act, the framework for prescription and non-prescription drugs and foods are set, along with standards as well as the enforcing agency, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). \"Goods found in violation of the law were subject to seizure and destruction at the expense of the manufacturer. That, combined with a legal requirement that all convictions be published (Notices of Judgment), proved to be important tools in the enforcement of the statute and had a deterrent effect upon would-be violators.\" Marijuana remains under this law defined as a \"dangerous drug\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/taxact/woodward.htm |title=Statement Of Dr. William C.

Silk was much more expensive than hemp and imported largely from Japan. There was more money in a substitute for silk. DuPont focused early on thin stockings for women. As a commercial product, nylon was a revolution in textiles. Strong and water-resistant, it was possible to make very thin fibers from cheap raw materials. The first sales in 1938 in New York of nylon stockings created a line with 4000 middle class women. For years to come, nylon demand was greater than DuPont could produce. And the DuPont Group was very big; it could move on if nylon had not become a success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caimateriali.org/index.php?id=32|title=the history of nylon|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"Wolfe2008\">{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Nylon: A Revolution in Textiles|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/nylon-a-revolution-in-textiles|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|volume=26|issue=3|last1=Wolfe|first1=Audra J.|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/carotherspolymers/first-nylon-plant-historical-resource.pdf|title=American Chemical Society: THE FIRST NYLON PLANT. 1995|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hanfstengel.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Hemp, bast with fibers.

Therefore, under federal law violators are prosecuted because the [[Commerce Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]] grants the federal government jurisdiction, pursuant to the U.S. Controlled Substances Act, to prosecute marijuana offenses.\n\nIn ''Gonzales'' the defendants argued that because the cannabis in question had been grown, transported, and consumed entirely within California and in compliance with California medical cannabis laws, their activity did not implicate interstate commerce, and as such could not be regulated by the federal government through the Commerce Clause.\n\nThe Supreme Court disagreed, reasoning that cannabis grown within California for medical purposes is indistinguishable from illicit marijuana and that because the intrastate medical cannabis market contributes to the interstate illicit marijuana market, the Commerce Clause applies. Even where California citizens are using medical cannabis in compliance with state law, those individuals and businesses can still be prosecuted by federal authorities for violating federal law.<ref>Supreme Court.

Increased restrictions and labeling of cannabis as a poison began in many states from 1906 onward, and outright prohibitions began in the 1920s.

Multiple efforts to [[Removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act|reschedule cannabis]] under the CSA have failed, and the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[United States v.

Despite this, states and other jurisdictions have continued to implement policies that conflict with federal law, beginning with the passage of California's [[California Proposition 215 (1996)|Proposition 215]] in 1996.

The new revisions aimed to restrict all narcotics, including cannabis, as poisons, limit their sale to pharmacies, and require doctor's prescriptions. The first instance was in the [[District of Columbia]] in 1906, under \"An act to regulate the practice of pharmacy and the sale of poisons in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes\". The act was updated in 1938 to the Federal Pure Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act of 1938 which remains in effect even today, creating a legal paradox for federal sentencing. Under this act, the framework for prescription and non-prescription drugs and foods are set, along with standards as well as the enforcing agency, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). \"Goods found in violation of the law were subject to seizure and destruction at the expense of the manufacturer. That, combined with a legal requirement that all convictions be published (Notices of Judgment), proved to be important tools in the enforcement of the statute and had a deterrent effect upon would-be violators.\" Marijuana remains under this law defined as a \"dangerous drug\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/taxact/woodward.htm |title=Statement Of Dr. William C.

In New York, reform legislation began under the Towns-Boylan Act, which targeted all \"habit-forming drugs\", restricted their sale, prohibited refills in order to prevent habituation, prohibited sale to people with a habit, and prohibited doctors who were themselves habituated from selling them.<ref>{{cite news|title=TO MAKE IT TO GET HABIT DRUGS; Towns-Boylan Bill at Albany Would Stop the Loopholes in Present Prescription Law.|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 26, 1914|location=New York City|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1914/01/26/archives/to-make-it-harder-to-get-habit-drugs-townsboylan-bill-at-albany.html}}</ref> Shortly after, several amendments were passed by the New York Board of Health, including adding cannabis to the list of habit-forming drugs.<ref>{{cite news|title=MUZZLES THE DOGS ALL THE YEAR 'ROUND; Health Board Seeks to Stop the Increase of Rabies by Sanitary Law.

The committee took into consideration the fact that the federal government had already passed the [[Harrison Act]] in 1914 and the Federal Import and Export Act in 1922. Many people assumed that the Harrison Act was all that was necessary. The Harrison Act, however, was a revenue-producing act and, while it provided penalties for violation, it did not give the states themselves authority to exercise police power in regard to seizure of drugs used in illicit trade, or in regard to punishment of those responsible.

They argue that the reason for developing nylon was to produce a fiber that could compete with [[silk]] and [[rayon]] in, for example, thin stockings for women. Silk was much more expensive than hemp and imported largely from Japan. There was more money in a substitute for silk. DuPont focused early on thin stockings for women. As a commercial product, nylon was a revolution in textiles. Strong and water-resistant, it was possible to make very thin fibers from cheap raw materials. The first sales in 1938 in New York of nylon stockings created a line with 4000 middle class women. For years to come, nylon demand was greater than DuPont could produce.

Therefore, under federal law violators are prosecuted because the [[Commerce Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]] grants the federal government jurisdiction, pursuant to the U.S. Controlled Substances Act, to prosecute marijuana offenses.\n\nIn ''Gonzales'' the defendants argued that because the cannabis in question had been grown, transported, and consumed entirely within California and in compliance with California medical cannabis laws, their activity did not implicate interstate commerce, and as such could not be regulated by the federal government through the Commerce Clause.\n\nThe Supreme Court disagreed, reasoning that cannabis grown within California for medical purposes is indistinguishable from illicit marijuana and that because the intrastate medical cannabis market contributes to the interstate illicit marijuana market, the Commerce Clause applies. Even where California citizens are using medical cannabis in compliance with state law, those individuals and businesses can still be prosecuted by federal authorities for violating federal law.<ref>Supreme Court.

first states to legalize recreational use of cannabis when voters approved [[Colorado Amendment 64]] and [[Washington Initiative 502]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Washington, Colorado Allow Recreational

Each regulated cannabis in a way similar to alcohol, allowing possession of up to an ounce for adults ages 21 and older, with [[DUID]] provisions similar to those against drunk driving. Unlike Initiative 502, Amendment 64 allowed for personal cultivation of up to six plants. Both allowed for commercial cultivation and sales, subject to regulation and taxes.\n\n====Cole Memorandum (2013)====\nAfter the first states legalized in 2012, the Justice Department issued the [[Cole Memorandum]] in August 2013, seeking to clarify how federal law would be enforced.  The memo specified eight conditions which would merit enforcement of federal law, such as the distribution of cannabis to minors or the diversion of cannabis across state borders.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rough|first1=Lisa|title=The Cole Memo: What Is It and What Does It Mean?|url=https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/what-is-the-cole-memo|accessdate=January 21, 2018|work=Leafly|date=September 14, 2017}}</ref>  Aside from these situations, the memo generally allowed for the commercial distribution of cannabis in states where such activity has been legalized.

These laws were similar in nature to those of Colorado and Washington, except the D.C. initiative did not contain an allowance for commercial sale.  A rider attached to the 2014 \"Cromnibus\" bill further prevented D.C. council members from enacting legislation to allow for commercial sale.<ref>{{cite news|title=Washington DC legalizes marijuana possession and use|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-31634827|accessdate=February 26, 2015|work=BBC News|date=February 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Cummings|first1=William|title=Pot now legal in D.C. despite threats from Congress|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/02/25/dc-marijuana-legalization/24033803/|accessdate=February 26, 2015|work=USA Today|date=February 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== Indian Reservation legalization allowed (2014) ====\nIn December 2014, the Justice Department announced a policy to allow recognized Indian tribes to legalize the use and sale of cannabis on their lands.

Since then, the housing market has rebounded considerably. According to Opendoor, zip code 85338 in Goodyear was the fifth most popular place in the Phoenix metro area to buy a home, based on home sales. There are also a variety of home options in 2019 to accommodate families, those who are single, and seniors.

The [[Cleveland Indians]] of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[American League]] moved their spring training facility to Goodyear from [[Winter Haven, Florida]] and rejoined the [[Cactus League]] in February 2009, after a 15-year absence. Before that, the Indians held spring training for many years in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]].\n\nOn April 7, 2008, Goodyear's city council unanimously approved a [[memorandum]] to fund a new $33 million [[baseball]] spring training complex for Major League Baseball's [[Cincinnati Reds]] and Cleveland Indians. This includes a 10,000-seat park, [[Goodyear Ballpark]], that opened in 2009. The Reds and the Indians have separate offices, clubhouses and practice fields. The Indians had held their spring training in Tucson for many years until moving to Winter Haven in 1993. They agreed in 2006 to return their spring training location to Arizona at Goodyear.\n\nThe [[Goodyear Centennials]], of the [[Freedom Pro Baseball League]], played their home games at the Goodyear Ballpark. Two other baseball teams in the [[Arizona League]], the [[Arizona League Indians]] and the [[Arizona League Reds]], also play at the stadium.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Air===\n[[Phoenix Goodyear Airport]] is located here. It has an 8,500&nbsp;ft runway capable of handling large jet aircraft. This airport, used by many international airlines for aircraft maintenance and storage, has no active commercial air service.\n\n===Rail===\n[[Union Pacific]] operates a railroad that goes through Goodyear. Rail lines provide Goodyear with access to 23 states in the western two-thirds of the United States.\n\n===Road transport===\n[[Interstate 10 in Arizona|Interstate 10]] goes through Goodyear, heading west to [[Buckeye, Arizona|Buckeye]] and [[Los Angeles]]. I-10 heads east to Phoenix, [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], and the [[Southern United States|Southern states]].\n\nThe city is also served by the western ends of several bus routes of the [[Valley Metro Bus (Phoenix)|Valley Metro Bus]].<ref name=\"valley_metro\">{{cite book|title=Transit Book|date=July 2012|publisher=[[Valley Metro]]|url=http://www.valleymetro.org/|accessdate=August 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOther roads and highways serve the area. [[Arizona State Route 303|Loop 303]] starts as Cotton Lane then heads up north to Surprise and then to [[Interstate 17]]. [[Van Buren Street (Arizona)|Van Buren Street]], McDowell, Indian School and Camelback Roads are major arterial roads leading from the extreme western Phoenix area to past Scottsdale, in the east. MC 85 (Maricopa County Highway 85) is a highway running from [[Arizona State Route 85]] in Buckeye to central Phoenix. The highway passes the southern sections of Goodyear.\n\n====Road improvements====\nInterstate 10 was built through Goodyear in the late 20th century. Between 2008 and 2014, the road had significant expansions. It was expanded from 2 lanes in each direction to 5 or 6 (including one HOV lane starting near Loop 303 going east). There were also new interchanges, including Exit 122 (Perryville Road), Exit 123 (Citrus Road) and Exit 125 (Sarival Avenue).\n\n=====Loop 303 improvement=====\nThe [[Arizona Department of Transportation]] built a new interchange near the Interstate 10/Loop 303 junctions. The interchange is being expanded from a [[diamond interchange]] to a [[stack interchange]]. As a result, Loop 303 under Interstate 10 was cleared, and Exit 124 on [[Interstate 10]] has been shut down; the new interchange was completed in 2014.\n\nSouth of Interstate 10, Loop 303 is being planned to extend to a future State Route 30.<ref>{{cite web|title=Loop 303 South of I-10|url=http://www.azdot.gov/Highways/Valley_Freeways/Freeway_Maps/Loop_303.asp|accessdate=December 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818092415/http://azdot.gov/Highways/Valley_Freeways/Freeway_Maps/Loop_303.asp|archive-date=August 18, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=====State Route 30 (Formerly State Route 801)=====\n[[Arizona State Route 30]] (originally designated as State Route 801) is a proposed highway south of Interstate 10 that will relieve traffic congestion.

The [[Cleveland Indians]] of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[American League]] moved their spring training facility to Goodyear from [[Winter Haven, Florida]] and rejoined the [[Cactus League]] in February 2009, after a 15-year absence. Before that, the Indians held spring training for many years in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]].\n\nOn April 7, 2008, Goodyear's city council unanimously approved a [[memorandum]] to fund a new $33 million [[baseball]] spring training complex for Major League Baseball's [[Cincinnati Reds]] and Cleveland Indians. This includes a 10,000-seat park, [[Goodyear Ballpark]], that opened in 2009. The Reds and the Indians have separate offices, clubhouses and practice fields. The Indians had held their spring training in Tucson for many years until moving to Winter Haven in 1993. They agreed in 2006 to return their spring training location to Arizona at Goodyear.\n\nThe [[Goodyear Centennials]], of the [[Freedom Pro Baseball League]], played their home games at the Goodyear Ballpark. Two other baseball teams in the [[Arizona League]], the [[Arizona League Indians]] and the [[Arizona League Reds]], also play at the stadium.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Air===\n[[Phoenix Goodyear Airport]] is located here. It has an 8,500&nbsp;ft runway capable of handling large jet aircraft. This airport, used by many international airlines for aircraft maintenance and storage, has no active commercial air service.\n\n===Rail===\n[[Union Pacific]] operates a railroad that goes through Goodyear.

MC 85 (Maricopa County Highway 85) is a highway running from [[Arizona State Route 85]] in Buckeye to central Phoenix. The highway passes the southern sections of Goodyear.\n\n====Road improvements====\nInterstate 10 was built through Goodyear in the late 20th century. Between 2008 and 2014, the road had significant expansions. It was expanded from 2 lanes in each direction to 5 or 6 (including one HOV lane starting near Loop 303 going east). There were also new interchanges, including Exit 122 (Perryville Road), Exit 123 (Citrus Road) and Exit 125 (Sarival Avenue).\n\n=====Loop 303 improvement=====\nThe [[Arizona Department of Transportation]] built a new interchange near the Interstate 10/Loop 303 junctions. The interchange is being expanded from a [[diamond interchange]] to a [[stack interchange]]. As a result, Loop 303 under Interstate 10 was cleared, and Exit 124 on [[Interstate 10]] has been shut down; the new interchange was completed in 2014.\n\nSouth of Interstate 10, Loop 303 is being planned to extend to a future State Route 30.<ref>{{cite web|title=Loop 303 South of I-10|url=http://www.azdot.gov/Highways/Valley_Freeways/Freeway_Maps/Loop_303.asp|accessdate=December 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818092415/http://azdot.gov/Highways/Valley_Freeways/Freeway_Maps/Loop_303.asp|archive-date=August 18, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=====State Route 30 (Formerly State Route 801)=====\n[[Arizona State Route 30]] (originally designated as State Route 801) is a proposed highway south of Interstate 10 that will relieve traffic congestion.
