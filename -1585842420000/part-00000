{"title_page": "George Washington and slavery", "text_new": "[[File:GW-painting.jpg|thumb|right|''George Washington'' ([[John Trumbull]], 1780), with [[William Lee (valet)|William Lee]], Washington's enslaved personal servant|alt=painting]]\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2016}}\n\nIt is the paradox of '''George Washington and slavery''' that the man who successfully fought a war in the name of liberty owned slaves his entire adult life.  He became uneasy with [[Slavery in the colonial United States|an institution]] that was ingrained in the economic and social fabric of [[Colony of Virginia|his native Virginia]], and ultimately provided for the emancipation of his slaves in his will. \n\n[[George Washington|Washington]] inherited his first ten slaves at the age of eleven on the death of his father in 1743. In adulthood his personal slaveholding increased through inheritance, purchase and natural increase. In 1759, he gained control of [[Dowry|dower]] slaves belonging to the Custis estate on his marriage to [[Martha Dandridge Custis]]. Washington's early attitudes to slavery reflected the prevailing Virginia [[Planter class|planter]] views of the day, and so he demonstrated no moral qualms about the institution. He became skeptical about the economic efficacy of slavery before the [[American Revolutionary War]], and expressed support in private for abolition by a gradual legislative process after the war. Washington remained dependent on slave labor, and by the time of his death in 1799 there were 317 slaves at Mount Vernon, 124 owned by Washington and the remainder managed by him as his own property but belonging to other people.\n\nWashington was a demanding master. He provided his slaves with basic food, clothing and accommodation comparable to general practise at the time but not always adequate, and with medical care. In return, he expected them to work diligently from sunrise to sunset over the six-day working week that was standard at the time. Some three-quarters of the slaves labored in the fields, while most of the remainder worked at the main residence as domestic servants and artisans. They supplemented their diet by hunting, trapping, and growing vegetables in their free time, and bought extra rations, clothing and housewares with income from the sale of game and produce. They built their own community around marriage and family, though because Washington allocated slaves to farms according to the demands of the business without regard for their relationships, many husbands lived separately from their wives and children. Washington used both reward and punishment to encourage and discipline his slaves, but was constantly disappointed when they failed to meet his exacting standards. They resisted enslavement by various means, including theft to supplement food and clothing and as another source of income, by feigning illness, and by running away.\n\nWashington's first doubts about slavery surfaced in the 1760s, when the transition from tobacco to grain crops at his [[Mount Vernon]] estate left him with a surplus of slaves, prompting him to question the economic viability of slavery. As commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1775, he initially refused to accept blacks, free or slave, into the ranks, but reversed this position due to the demands of war. The first indication of moral doubt appeared during efforts to sell some of his slaves in 1778, when Washington expressed his distaste for selling them at a public venue and his desire that slave families not be split up as a result of the sale. His public words and deeds at the end of the American Revolutionary War betrayed no antislavery sentiments. Politically, Washington was concerned that such a divisive issue as [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] should not threaten national unity, and he never spoke publicly about the institution. Privately, Washington considered plans in the mid 1790s to free all the slaves he controlled, but they could not be realized because of his failure to secure his own financial security and the refusal of his family to cooperate. His will provided for the emancipation of his own slaves, the only [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] to do so. Because many of his slaves were married to Martha's dower slaves, whom he could not legally free, Washington stipulated that, with the exception of his valet William Lee who was freed immediately, his slaves be emancipated on the death of Martha. She freed them in 1801, a year before her own death, but her dower slaves were passed to her grandchildren and remained in bondage.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|History of slavery in Virginia}}\n[[File:The Leading Facts of American History (1910) - The First Negro Slaves Brought to Virginia.png|thumb|First slaves arriving in Virginia|alt=Black and white illustration]]\nSlavery was introduced into the English [[colony of Virginia]] when the first Africans were transported to [[Old Point Comfort|Point Comfort]] in 1619. Those who accepted Christianity became \"Christian servants\" with time-limited servitude, or even freed, but this mechanism for ending bondage was gradually shut down. In 1667, the [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia Assembly]] passed a law that barred [[baptism]] as a means of conferring freedom. Africans who had been baptised before arriving in Virginia could be granted the status of [[Indentured servitude|indentured servant]] until 1682, when another law declared them to be slaves. Whites and blacks in the lowest stratum of Virginian society shared common disadvantages and a common lifestyle, which included intermarriage until the Assembly made such unions punishable by banishment in 1691.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 41\u201343</ref>\n\nIn 1671, Virginia counted 6,000 white indentured servants among its 40,000 population but only 2,000 blacks, up to a third of whom in some counties were free. Towards the end of the 17th century, British policy shifted in favor of retaining cheap labor rather than shipping it to the colonies, and the supply of indentured servants in Virginia began to dry up; by 1715, annual immigration was in the hundreds, compared with 1,500\u20132,000 in the 1680s. As tobacco planters put more land under cultivation, they made up the shortfall in labor with increasing numbers of slaves. The institution was rooted in race with the [[Virginia Slave Codes of 1705]], and from around 1710 the growth in the slave population was fueled by natural increase. Between 1700 and 1750 the number of slaves in the colony increased from 13,000 to 105,000, nearly eighty percent of them born in Virginia.<ref>Wiencek 2003 43\u201346</ref> In Washington's lifetime, slavery was deeply ingrained in the economic and social fabric of Virginia, where some forty percent of the population and virtually all African Americans were enslaved.<ref>Henriques 2008 p. 146</ref>\n\nGeorge Washington was born February 22, 1732, the first child of his father [[Augustine Washington|Augustine]]'s second marriage. Augustine was a tobacco planter with some {{convert|10,000|acre|ha}} of land and 50 slaves. On his death in 1743, he left his {{convert|2,500|acre|ha|adj=on}} Little Hunting Creek to George's older half-brother [[Lawrence Washington (1718\u20131752)|Lawrence]], who renamed it [[Mount Vernon]]. Washington inherited the {{convert|260|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Ferry Farm]] and ten slaves.<ref>Chernow 2010 pp. 22\u201328</ref> He leased Mount Vernon two years after Lawrence's death in 1752 and inherited it in 1761.<ref>Chernow 2010 pp. 82, 137</ref> He was an aggressive land speculator, and by 1774 he had amassed some {{convert|32,000|acre|ha}} of land in the [[Ohio Country]] on Virginia's western frontier.

Horses and mules were bred in stables there, and tropical plants were grown in a greenhouse. Trades such as blacksmithing, carpentry, barrel making (coopering), food production and preservation, spinning, weaving and shoe making were carried out in other buildings at Mansion House Farm. Some crops were grown at this farm, but the main agricultural business was conducted at the four outlying farms located in a radius of between {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km|spell=in}} and {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} from the mansion: Dogue Run Farm, Muddy Hole Farm, Union Farm (formed from the earlier Ferry Farm and French's Farm) and River Farm.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 4</ref> A farm manager responsible for the running of the estate reported directly to Washington, while an overseer was employed at each of the farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 78\u201379</ref>}}\n\n[[File:A Map of Washington's Farms at Mt. Vernon (1830 engraving).jpg|thumb|left|upright=2|Mount Vernon estate|alt=Black and white map showing farms at Mount Vernon]]\nAgricultural land required labor to be productive, and in the 18th-century American south that meant slave labor. Washington inherited slaves from Lawrence, acquired more as part of the terms of leasing Mount Vernon and inherited slaves again on the death of Lawrence's widow in 1761.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 11</ref><ref>Morgan 2000 p. 281</ref> On his marriage in 1759 to [[Martha Dandridge Custis]], Washington gained control of eighty-four [[Dowry|dower]] slaves.

Of that total, 103 belonged to Washington, the remainder being dower slaves, and 122 were productive men and women. Six were listed as dead or incapacitated, and the remaining eighty-eight were children. By the time of Washington's death in 1799, the slave population at Mount Vernon had increased to 317 people, including 143 children. Of that total, he owned 124, leased 40 and controlled 153 dower slaves.<ref>Morgan 2000 pp. 281\u2013282, 298</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 16\u201317</ref>\n\n==Slavery at Mount Vernon==\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=25%\n|quote=George Washington is a hard master, very severe, a hard husband, a hard father, a hard governor.

They were kept busy year round, their tasks varying with the season.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 117\u2013118</ref> The remainder worked as domestic servants in the main residence or as artisans, such as carpenters, [[joiner]]s, [[Cooper (profession)|coopers]], [[Hand spinning|spinners]] and seamstresses.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 109\u2013111</ref> Between 1766 and 1799, seven dower slaves worked at one time or another as overseers.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 86, 343\u2013344</ref> Slaves were expected to work from sunrise to sunset over a six-day work week that was standard on Virginia plantations. With two hours off for meals, their workdays would range between seven and a half hours to thirteen hours, depending on season. They were given three or four days off at Christmas and a day each at Easter and [[Whitsunday]].<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 106\u2013107, 122\u2013123</ref> Domestic slaves started early, worked into the evenings and did not necessarily have Sundays and holidays free.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 110, 124, 134</ref> On special occasions when slaves were required to put in extra effort, such as working through a holiday or bringing in the harvest, they were paid or compensated with extra time off.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 123\u2013124</ref>\n\nThere were elements of patriarchy and paternalism in Washington's attitudes to his workforce; he thought of his workers as part of an extended family in which he occupied the position of a father figure, with mutual obligations between master and servant.<ref>Morgan 2000 p. 282</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 45\u201348</ref> He instructed his overseers to treat slaves \"with humanity and tenderness\" when sick.<ref name=Morgan2005-410 /> Slaves who were less able, through injury, disability or age, were given light duties, while those too sick to work were generally, though not always, excused work while they recovered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 120, 125</ref> Washington provided them with good, sometimes costly medical care{{snd}}when a slave named Cupid fell ill with [[pleurisy]], Washington had him taken to the main house where he could be better cared for and personally checked on him throughout the day.<ref>Twohig 2003 p. 117</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 100</ref> The humanitarian concern for the welfare of his slaves was mixed with an economic consideration for the lost productivity arising from sickness and death among the labor force.<ref name=\"Twohig 2001 p. 116\">Twohig 2001 p. 116</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 46</ref> Although Washington insisted on an emotional distance between master and slave, there are examples of genuine affection, such as was the case with his valet [[William Lee (valet)|William Lee]], and evidence that slaves were able to approach him with their concerns and grievances.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 51\u201353, 97</ref>\n\n===Living conditions===\n[[File:Slave cabin at pioneer farm - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|left|Modern reconstruction of a slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph]]\nAt the main residence, most slaves were housed in a two-story [[Framing (construction)|frame building]] known as the \"Quarters for Families\". This was replaced in 1792 by brick-built accommodation wings either side of the greenhouse comprising four rooms in total, each of some {{convert|600|sqft|m2}}. The [[Mount Vernon Ladies' Association]] have concluded these rooms were communal areas furnished with bunks that allowed little privacy for the predominantly male occupants. Other slaves at the main residence lived over the outbuildings where they worked or in log cabins.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162\u2013164, 166\u2013167</ref> Such cabins were the standard slave accommodation at the outlying farms, comparable to the accommodation occupied by the lower strata of free white society across the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake area]] and by slaves on other Virginia plantations.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162, 167, 169</ref> They provided a single room that ranged in size from 168 square feet (15.6 m2) to 246 square feet (22.9 m2) to house a family.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168\u2013169</ref> The cabins were often poorly constructed, daubed with mud for draft- and water-proofing, with dirt floors. Some cabins were built as duplexes; some single-unit cabins were small enough to be moved with carts.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168, 170</ref> There are few sources which shed light on living conditions in these cabins, but one visitor in 1798 wrote, \"husband and wife sleep on a mean pallet, the children on the ground; a very bad fireplace, some utensils for cooking, but in the middle of this poverty some cups and a teapot.\" Other sources suggest the interiors were smokey, dirty and dark, with only a shuttered opening for a window and the fireplace for illumination at night.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 170\u2013172</ref>\n\nWashington provided slaves with a blanket each fall at most, which they used for their own bedding and which they were required to use to gather leaves for livestock bedding.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 175\u2013176</ref> Slaves at the outlying farms were issued with a basic set of clothing each year, comparable to the clothing issued on other Virginia plantations. Slaves slept and worked in their clothes, leaving them to spend many months in garments that were worn, ripped and tattered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 177\u2013178</ref> Domestic slaves at the main residence who came into regular contact with visitors were better clothed; butlers, waiters and body servants were dressed in a [[livery]] based on the three-piece suit of an 18th-century gentleman, and maids were provided with finer quality clothing than their counterparts in the fields.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 179\u2013181</ref>\n\nWashington desired his slaves to be fed adequately but no more.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 244\u2013245</ref> Each slave was provided with a basic daily food ration of {{convert|1|USqt|l|spell=in}} or more of [[cornmeal]], up to {{convert|8|oz|g|spell=in}} of herring and occasionally some meat, a fairly typical ration for slaves in Virginia that was adequate in terms of the calorie requirement for a young man engaged in moderately heavy agricultural labor but nutritionally deficient.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 221\u2013222, 245</ref> The basic ration was supplemented by slaves' own efforts hunting (for which some slaves were allowed guns) and trapping game. They grew their own vegetables in small garden plots they were permitted to maintain in their own time, on which they also reared poultry.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 229\u2013231</ref>\n\nWashington often tipped slaves on his visits to other estates, and it is likely that his own slaves were similarly rewarded by visitors to Mount Vernon. Slaves occasionally earned money through their normal work or for particular services rendered{{snd}}for example, Washington rewarded three of his own slaves with cash for good service in 1775, a slave received a fee for the care of a mare that was being bred in 1798 and the chef [[Hercules (chef)|Hercules]] profited well by selling slops from the presidential kitchen.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 193\u2013194</ref> Slaves also earned money from their own endeavors, by selling to Washington or at the market in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] food they had caught or grown and small items they had made.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 197, 231</ref> They used the proceeds to purchase from Washington or the shops in Alexandria better clothing, housewares and extra provisions such as flour, pork, whiskey, tea, coffee and sugar.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 194, 195\u2013196, 232</ref>\n\n===Family and community===\n[[File:Slave Cabin interior 01 - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|Interior of the reconstructed slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph showing single bedding on a pallet on a dirt floor]]\nAlthough the law did not recognize slave marriages, Washington did, and by 1799 some two-thirds of the adult slaves at Mount Vernon were married.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 128</ref> To minimize time lost in getting to the workplace and thus increase productivity, slaves were accommodated at the farm on which they worked. Because of the unequal distribution of males and females across the five farms, slaves often found partners on different farms, and in their day to day lives husbands were routinely separated from their wives and children. Only thirty-six of the ninety-six married slaves at Mount Vernon in 1799 lived together, while thirty-eight had spouses who lived on separate farms and twenty-two had spouses who lived on other plantations.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 122</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 132\u2013133</ref> The evidence suggests couples that were separated did not regularly visit during the week, and doing so prompted complaints from Washington that slaves were too exhausted to work after such \"night walking\", leaving Saturday nights/Sundays and holidays as the main time such families could spend together.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 134, 136, 202</ref> Despite the stress and anxiety caused by this indifference to family stability{{snd}}on one occasion an overseer wrote that the separation of families \"seems like death to them\"{{snd}}marriage was the foundation on which slaves established their own community, and longevity in these unions was not uncommon.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 127, 130\u2013131, 132</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 123</ref>\n\nLarge families that covered multiple generations, along with their attendant marriages, were part of a slave community-building process that transcended ownership. Washington's head carpenter Isaac, for example, lived with his wife Kitty, a dower-slave milkmaid, at Mansion House Farm. The couple had nine daughters ranging in age from six to twenty-seven in 1799, and the marriages of four of those daughters had extended the family to other farms within and outside the Mount Vernon estate and produced three grandchildren.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\">Thompson 2019 p. 135</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 p. 421</ref> Children were born into slavery, their ownership determined by the ownership of their mothers.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\">Thompson 2019 p. 309</ref> The value attached to the birth of a slave child, if it was noted at all, is indicated in the weekly report of one overseer, which stated, \"Increase 9 Lambs & 1 male child of Lynnas.\" New mothers received a new blanket and three to five weeks of light duties to recover. An infant remained with its mother at her place of work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 151\u2013152</ref> Older children, the majority of whom lived in single-parent households in which the mother worked from dawn to dusk, performed small family chores but were otherwise left to play largely unsupervised until they reached an age when they could begin to be put to work for Washington, usually somewhere between eleven and fourteen years old.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 158\u2013160</ref> In 1799, nearly sixty percent of the slave population was under nineteen years old and nearly thirty-five percent under nine.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\"/>\n\nThere is evidence that slaves passed on their African cultural values through telling stories, among them [[Joel Chandler Harris]]'s tales of [[Br'er Rabbit]] which, with their origins in Africa and stories of a powerless individual triumphing through wit and intelligence over powerful authority, would have resonated with the slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 203</ref> African-born slaves brought with them some of the religious rituals of their ancestral home, and there is an undocumented tradition of voodoo being practiced at one of the Mount Vernon farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 211\u2013213</ref> Although the slave condition made it impossible to adhere to the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], some slave names betray a Muslim cultural origin.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 213\u2013214</ref> [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] reached out to American-born slaves in Virginia, and some of the Mount Vernon slaves are known to have been christened before Washington acquired the estate.

The probability of paternal relationships between slaves and hired white workers is indicated by some surnames: Betty and Tom Davis, probably the children of Thomas Davis, a white weaver at Mount Vernon in the 1760s; George Young, likely the son of a man of the same name who was a clerk at Mount Vernon in 1774; and [[Oney Judge]] and her sister Delphy, the daughters of Andrew Judge, an indentured tailor at Mount Vernon in the 1770s and 1780s.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 138\u2013139</ref> There is evidence to suggest that white overseers{{snd}}working in close proximity to slaves under the same demanding master and physically and socially isolated from their own peer group, a situation that drove some to drink{{snd}}indulged in sexual relations with their charges.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 140\u2013141</ref> Some white visitors to Mount Vernon seemed to have expected slave women to provide sexual favors.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 141\u2013142</ref> The living arrangements left some slave females alone and vulnerable, and the Mount Vernon research historian Mary V. Thompson writes that relationships \"could have been the result of mutual attraction and affection, very real demonstrations of power and control, or even exercises in the manipulation of an authority figure.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 140</ref>{{efn|There is an oral tradition among the descendants of the freedman [[West Ford (slave)|West Ford]] that he was the son of Washington and Venus, a slave belonging to Washington's brother [[John Augustine Washington]].

Food was stolen both to supplement rations and to sell, and Washington believed the selling of tools was another source of income for slaves. Because cloth and clothing were commonly stolen, Washington required seamstresses to show the results of their work and the leftover scraps before issuing them with more material. Sheep were washed before shearing to prevent the theft of wool, and storage areas were kept locked and keys left with trusted individuals.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 269\u2013271</ref> In 1792, Washington ordered the culling of slaves' dogs he believed were being used in a spate of livestock theft and ruled that slaves who nevertheless kept dogs without authorization were to be \"severely punished\" and their dogs hanged.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 201</ref>\n\nAnother means by which slaves resisted, one that was virtually impossible to prove, was feigning illness. Over the years Washington became increasingly skeptical about absenteeism due to sickness among his slaves and concerned about the diligence or ability of his overseers in recognizing genuine cases. Between 1792 and 1794, while Washington was away from Mount Vernon as President, the number of days lost to sickness increased tenfold compared to 1786, when he was resident at Mount Vernon and able to control the situation personally. In one case, Washington suspected a slave of frequently avoiding work over a period of decades through acts of deliberate self harm.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 261\u2013263, 264\u2013265</ref>\n\nSlaves asserted some independence and frustrated Washington by the pace and quality of their work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 105, 265</ref> In 1760, Washington noted that four of his carpenters quadrupled their output of timber under his personal supervision.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 93\u201394</ref> Thirty-five years later, he described his carpenters as an \"idle...set of rascals\" who would take a month or more to complete at Mount Vernon work that was being done in two or three days in Philadelphia. The output of seamstresses dropped off when Martha was away, and spinners found they could slacken by playing the overseers off against Martha.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266\u2013267</ref> Tools were regularly lost or damaged, thus stopping work, and Washington despaired of employing innovations that might improve efficiency because he believed the slaves were too clumsy to operate the new machinery involved.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266, 268</ref>\n\nThe most emphatic act of resistance was to run away, and between 1760 and 1799 at least forty-seven slaves under Washington's control did so.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 275</ref> Seventeen of these, fourteen men and three women, escaped to a British warship that anchored in the Potomac near Mount Vernon in 1781.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 278, 279</ref> In general, the best chance of success lay with second- or third-generation African-American slaves who had good English, possessed skills that would allow them to support themselves as free people and were in close enough contact with their masters to receive special privileges. Thus it was that Judge, an especially talented seamstress, and Hercules escaped in 1796 and 1797 respectively and eluded recapture.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 281, 284\u2013286</ref> Washington took seriously the recapture of fugitives, and in three cases an escaped slave was sold off in the West Indies after recapture, effectively a death sentence in the severe conditions slaves had to endure there.<ref name=\"Wiencek 2003 p. 132\">Wiencek 2003 p. 132</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 411\u2013412</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 161</ref>\n\n===Control===\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=25%\n|quote=Slavery was a system in which enslaved people lived in fear; fear of being sold, fear of being separated from their families or their children or their parents, fear of not being in control of their bodies or their lives, fear of never knowing freedom.

By 1766, he had transitioned his business from the labor-intensive planting of tobacco to the less demanding farming of grain crops. His slaves were employed on a greater variety of tasks that needed more skills than tobacco planting required of them; as well as the cultivation of grains and vegetables, they were employed in cattle herding, spinning, weaving and carpentry. The transition left Washington with a surplus of slaves and revealed to him the inefficiencies of the slave labor system.<ref name=Morgan2005p413>Morgan 2005 p. 413</ref><ref name=Twohig118>Twohig 2001 p. 118</ref>\n\nThere is little evidence that Washington seriously questioned the ethics of slavery before the Revolution.<ref name=Twohig118 /> In the 1760s he often participated in tavern lotteries, events in which defaulters' debts were settled by raffling off their assets to a high-spirited crowd.<ref>Chernow 2010 p. 162</ref> In 1769, Washington co-managed one such lottery in which fifty-five slaves were sold, among them six families and five females with children. The more valuable married males were raffled together with their wives and children; less valuable slaves were separated from their families into different lots. Robin and Bella, for example, were raffled together as husband and wife while their children, twelve-year-old Sukey and seven-year-old Betty, were listed in a separate lot. Only chance dictated whether the family would remain together, and with 1,840 tickets on sale the odds were not good.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 178\u2013180</ref>\n\nThe historian [[Henry Wiencek]] concludes that the repugnance Washington felt at this cruelty in which he had participated prompted his decision not to break up slave families by sale or purchase, and marks the beginning of a transformation in Washington's thinking about the morality of slavery.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 135, 188</ref> Wiencek writes that in 1775 Washington took more slaves than he needed rather than break up the family of a slave he had agreed to accept in payment of a debt.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 188</ref> The historians [[Philip D.

Morgan writes that in 1772, Washington was \"all business\" and \"might have been buying livestock\" in purchasing more slaves who were to be, in Washington's words, \"strait Limb'd, & in every respect strong & likely, with good Teeth & good Countenance.\" Morgan gives a different account of the 1775 purchase, writing that Washington resold the slave because of the slave's resistance to being separated from family and that the decision to do so was \"no more than the conventional piety of large Virginia planters who usually said they did not want to break up slave families{{snd}}and often did it anyway.\"<ref name=Morgan2005p412>Morgan 2005 p. 412</ref><ref name=Henriques159>Henriques 2008 p. 159</ref>\n\n===American Revolution===\n[[File:List of George Washington's taxable property in Truro Parish Virginia including slaves 1788.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Washington's taxable property in April 1788: 121 slaves, 98 horses, 4 mules and a chariot|alt=Original document]]\nFrom the late 1760s, Washington became increasingly radicalized against the North American colonies' subservient status within the [[British Empire]].<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 69</ref> In 1774 he was a key participant in agreeing the [[Fairfax Resolves]] which, alongside the assertion of colonial rights, condemned the [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slave trade]] on moral grounds.<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 75</ref><ref name=Twohig118 /> He began to express the growing rift with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in terms of slavery, stating in the summer of 1774 that the British authorities were \"endeavouring by every piece of Art & despotism to fix the Shackles of Slavry{{sic}}\" upon the colonies. Two years later, on taking command of the [[Continental Army]] at Cambridge at the start of the [[American Revolutionary War]], he wrote in orders to his troops that \"it is a noble Cause we are engaged in, it is the Cause of virtue and mankind...freedom or Slavery must be the result of our conduct.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 p.64</ref>\n\nWashington shared the common southern concern about arming blacks or slaves and initially refused to accept either into the ranks of the Continental Army.

He sought to liberate himself from an economically unviable system, not to liberate his slaves. They were still a property from which he expected to profit.

The single pre-1788 pamphlet of the six in ''Tracts on Slavery'' was ''A Serious Address to the Rulers of America, on the Inconsistency of Their Conduct Respecting Slavery'', published in 1783. It was the first pamphlet in the volume, and Washington had written his signature on the cover, as he did with the first pamphlet in each of the thirty-six volumes. Of the eleven pamphlets on slavery that were, presumably, not considered to be worth binding, eight were published before 1788. One of them, published in 1785, was never read.

On returning to France, Lafayette purchased a plantation in the French colony of Cayenne, modern-day [[French Guiana]], and advised Washington of his progress by letter in 1786. Lafayette had taken concerns about the abrupt emancipation of slaves into account, paying and educating the slaves he settled on the plantation before freeing them. He became a leading figure in antislavery movements in France and Great Britain. Washington would not have known of Lafayette's antislavery activities in Cayenne or Europe from Lafayette himself; although the two continued to correspond for the rest of Washington's life, the subject of slavery virtually disappeared from their letters.

He presided over the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, during which it became obvious just how explosive the issue was and how willing the antislavery faction was to sacrifice abolition on the altar of national unity under a strong federal government. The support of the southern states for the new constitution was secured by granting them concessions that protected slavery, including the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] and the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]], plus clauses that guaranteed the transatlantic slave trade for at least twenty years and federal aid for the suppression of any slave rebellion.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 422</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 124\u2013125</ref>\n\nWashington's preeminent position ensured that any actions he took with regard to his own slaves would become a statement in a national debate about slavery that threatened to divide the country. Wiencek suggests Washington considered making precisely such a statement on taking up the presidency in 1789. A passage in the notebook of Washington's biographer [[David Humphreys (soldier)|David Humphreys]]{{efn|Humphreys was a former aide to Washington and had begun an eighteen-month stay at Mount Vernon in 1787 to assist Washington with his correspondence and write his biography.<ref>Ellis 2004 p. 153</ref>}} dated to late 1788 or early 1789 recorded a statement that presaged Washington's emancipation of his slaves in his will a decade later. Wiencek argues the passage was a draft for a public announcement Washington was considering in which he would declare the emancipation of some of his slaves. It marks, Wiencek believes, a moral epiphany in Washington's thinking, the moment he decided not only to emancipate his slaves but also to use the occasion to set the example Lafayette had urged in 1783.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\">Wiencek 2003 pp. 272\u2013275</ref> Other historians dispute Wiencek's conclusion; Henriques and [[Joseph Ellis]] concur with Philip Morgan's opinion that Washington experienced no epiphanies in a \"long and hard-headed struggle\" in which there was no single turning point. Morgan argues that Humphreys' passage is the \"private expression of remorse\" from a man unable to extricate himself from the \"tangled web\" of \"mutual dependency\" on slavery, and that Washington believed public comment on such a divisive subject was best avoided for the sake of national unity.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 421\u2013423, 425</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 311 n22</ref><ref name=Henriques159 />{{efn|Wiencek bases his argument on the fact that the passage was written in the past tense and appears in Humphreys' notebook amid drafts Humphreys had written for public statements Washington was to make about assuming the presidency.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\" /> Philip Morgan points out that the passage was Humphreys' words in Washington's voice and appears just after a summary Humphreys had written of [[Thomas Clarkson]]'s 1788 ''An Essay on the Impolicy of the African Slave Trade''.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 423 n31</ref> Kenneth Morgan characterizes the passage as \"a remark made in [Washington's] voice by David Humphreys.\"<ref name=Morgan2000p298 /> Fritz Hirschfeld writes that the passage was written by Humphreys during direct dictation or from memory of Washington's exact words, and believes it highly improbable that they were not Washington's own words.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 213 n5</ref>}}\n\n====As President====\n{{See also|Presidency of George Washington}}\n[[File:George Washington 1795.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|''President George Washington'' by Gilbert Stuart (1795) |alt=Portrait painting]]\nWashington took up the presidency at a time when revolutionary sentiment against slavery was giving way to a resurgence of proslavery interests. No state considered making slavery an issue during the ratification of the new constitution, southern states reinforced their slavery legislation and prominent antislavery figures were muted about the issue in public. Washington understood there was little widespread organized support for abolition.<ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 125\u2013126</ref> He had a keen sense both of the fragility of the fledgling Republic and of his place as a unifying figure, and he was determined not to endanger either by confronting an issue as divisive and entrenched as slavery.<ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 126\u2013128</ref><ref>Morgan 2000 pp. 290, 295</ref> He presided over an administration that passed a resolution in 1790 affirming states' rights to regulate treatment of slaves and legislate on slavery free of congressional interference, provided material and financial support in French efforts to suppress the [[Haitian Revolution|Saint Domingue slave revolt]] in 1791 and implemented the proslavery [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]].<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 275\u2013276</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 p. 130</ref><ref name=Morgan2000-297>Morgan 2000 p. 297</ref> He also signed into law the [[Slave Trade Act of 1794]] that sought to limit American involvement in the [[Atlantic slave trade|international slave trade]].<ref>Stathis 2014 pp. 17\u201318</ref> Washington never spoke publicly on the issue of slavery during his eight years as president, nor did he respond to, much less act upon, any of the antislavery petitions he received. He described a 1790 Quaker petition to [[United States Congress|Congress]] urging an immediate end to the slave trade as \"an illjudged piece of business\" that \"occasioned a great waste of time.\" The issue of slavery was not mentioned in either his last address to Congress or his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]].<ref>Twohig 2001 p. 126</ref><ref>Boller 1961 pp. 85, 87</ref><ref>Ferling 2009 p. 363</ref>\n\nLate in his presidency, Washington told his [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Edmund Randolph]], that in the event of a confrontation between the antislavery North and proslavery South, he had \"made up his mind to remove and be of the Northern.\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 362</ref> In 1798, he imagined just such a conflict when he said, \"I can clearly foresee that nothing but the rooting out of slavery can perpetuate the existence of our union.\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 361\u2013362</ref><ref name=\"Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373\"/> But there is no indication Washington ever favored an immediate end to slavery.

This plan would have involved breaking up slave families, but it was designed with an end goal of raising enough finances to fund their eventual emancipation (a detail Washington kept secret) and prevent the Custis heirs from permanently splitting up families by sale.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 339\u2013342</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 303\u2013304</ref>{{efn|The dower slaves had already begun to be transferred to Martha's granddaughters as the Custis heirs married.

Not only would Washington have been deprived of their services if they were freed, most of the slaves he took with him to Philadelphia were dower slaves, which meant that he would have had to compensate the Custis estate for the loss.

In the months that followed, he considered a plan that betrayed a continuing prioritisation of profit above his concerns about the institution of slavery. The plan involved repossessing tenancies in [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley]] and [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]] Counties and transferring half of his Mount Vernon slaves to work them. It would, Washington hoped, \"yield more nett profit\" which might \"benefit myself and not render the [slaves'] condition worse\", despite the disruption such relocation would have had on the slave families.

His valet, William Lee, was freed immediately and his remaining 123 slaves were to be emancipated on the death of Martha.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 5</ref><ref name=Morgan2005p404 /> The deferral was intended to postpone the pain of separation that would occur when his slaves were freed but their spouses among the dower slaves remained in bondage, a situation which affected twenty couples and their children.

He became uneasy with [[Slavery in the colonial United States|an institution]] that was ingrained in the economic and social fabric of [[Colony of Virginia|his native Virginia]], and ultimately provided for the emancipation of his slaves in his will. \n\n[[George Washington|Washington]] inherited his first ten slaves at the age of eleven on the death of his father in 1743. In adulthood his personal slaveholding increased through inheritance, purchase and natural increase. In 1759, he gained control of [[Dowry|dower]] slaves belonging to the Custis estate on his marriage to [[Martha Dandridge Custis]]. Washington's early attitudes to slavery reflected the prevailing Virginia [[Planter class|planter]] views of the day, and so he demonstrated no moral qualms about the institution. He became skeptical about the economic efficacy of slavery before the [[American Revolutionary War]], and expressed support in private for abolition by a gradual legislative process after the war. Washington remained dependent on slave labor, and by the time of his death in 1799 there were 317 slaves at Mount Vernon, 124 owned by Washington and the remainder managed by him as his own property but belonging to other people.\n\nWashington was a demanding master. He provided his slaves with basic food, clothing and accommodation comparable to general practise at the time but not always adequate, and with medical care. In return, he expected them to work diligently from sunrise to sunset over the six-day working week that was standard at the time. Some three-quarters of the slaves labored in the fields, while most of the remainder worked at the main residence as domestic servants and artisans. They supplemented their diet by hunting, trapping, and growing vegetables in their free time, and bought extra rations, clothing and housewares with income from the sale of game and produce. They built their own community around marriage and family, though because Washington allocated slaves to farms according to the demands of the business without regard for their relationships, many husbands lived separately from their wives and children. Washington used both reward and punishment to encourage and discipline his slaves, but was constantly disappointed when they failed to meet his exacting standards. They resisted enslavement by various means, including theft to supplement food and clothing and as another source of income, by feigning illness, and by running away.\n\nWashington's first doubts about slavery surfaced in the 1760s, when the transition from tobacco to grain crops at his [[Mount Vernon]] estate left him with a surplus of slaves, prompting him to question the economic viability of slavery. As commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1775, he initially refused to accept blacks, free or slave, into the ranks, but reversed this position due to the demands of war. The first indication of moral doubt appeared during efforts to sell some of his slaves in 1778, when Washington expressed his distaste for selling them at a public venue and his desire that slave families not be split up as a result of the sale. His public words and deeds at the end of the American Revolutionary War betrayed no antislavery sentiments. Politically, Washington was concerned that such a divisive issue as [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] should not threaten national unity, and he never spoke publicly about the institution. Privately, Washington considered plans in the mid 1790s to free all the slaves he controlled, but they could not be realized because of his failure to secure his own financial security and the refusal of his family to cooperate. His will provided for the emancipation of his own slaves, the only [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] to do so. Because many of his slaves were married to Martha's dower slaves, whom he could not legally free, Washington stipulated that, with the exception of his valet William Lee who was freed immediately, his slaves be emancipated on the death of Martha. She freed them in 1801, a year before her own death, but her dower slaves were passed to her grandchildren and remained in bondage.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|History of slavery in Virginia}}\n[[File:The Leading Facts of American History (1910) - The First Negro Slaves Brought to Virginia.png|thumb|First slaves arriving in Virginia|alt=Black and white illustration]]\nSlavery was introduced into the English [[colony of Virginia]] when the first Africans were transported to [[Old Point Comfort|Point Comfort]] in 1619. Those who accepted Christianity became \"Christian servants\" with time-limited servitude, or even freed, but this mechanism for ending bondage was gradually shut down. In 1667, the [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia Assembly]] passed a law that barred [[baptism]] as a means of conferring freedom. Africans who had been baptised before arriving in Virginia could be granted the status of [[Indentured servitude|indentured servant]] until 1682, when another law declared them to be slaves. Whites and blacks in the lowest stratum of Virginian society shared common disadvantages and a common lifestyle, which included intermarriage until the Assembly made such unions punishable by banishment in 1691.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 41\u201343</ref>\n\nIn 1671, Virginia counted 6,000 white indentured servants among its 40,000 population but only 2,000 blacks, up to a third of whom in some counties were free. Towards the end of the 17th century, British policy shifted in favor of retaining cheap labor rather than shipping it to the colonies, and the supply of indentured servants in Virginia began to dry up; by 1715, annual immigration was in the hundreds, compared with 1,500\u20132,000 in the 1680s. As tobacco planters put more land under cultivation, they made up the shortfall in labor with increasing numbers of slaves. The institution was rooted in race with the [[Virginia Slave Codes of 1705]], and from around 1710 the growth in the slave population was fueled by natural increase. Between 1700 and 1750 the number of slaves in the colony increased from 13,000 to 105,000, nearly eighty percent of them born in Virginia.<ref>Wiencek 2003 43\u201346</ref> In Washington's lifetime, slavery was deeply ingrained in the economic and social fabric of Virginia, where some forty percent of the population and virtually all African Americans were enslaved.<ref>Henriques 2008 p. 146</ref>\n\nGeorge Washington was born February 22, 1732, the first child of his father [[Augustine Washington|Augustine]]'s second marriage. Augustine was a tobacco planter with some {{convert|10,000|acre|ha}} of land and 50 slaves. On his death in 1743, he left his {{convert|2,500|acre|ha|adj=on}} Little Hunting Creek to George's older half-brother [[Lawrence Washington (1718\u20131752)|Lawrence]], who renamed it [[Mount Vernon]].

Horses and mules were bred in stables there, and tropical plants were grown in a greenhouse. Trades such as blacksmithing, carpentry, barrel making (coopering), food production and preservation, spinning, weaving and shoe making were carried out in other buildings at Mansion House Farm. Some crops were grown at this farm, but the main agricultural business was conducted at the four outlying farms located in a radius of between {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km|spell=in}} and {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} from the mansion: Dogue Run Farm, Muddy Hole Farm, Union Farm (formed from the earlier Ferry Farm and French's Farm) and River Farm.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 4</ref> A farm manager responsible for the running of the estate reported directly to Washington, while an overseer was employed at each of the farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 78\u201379</ref>}}\n\n[[File:A Map of Washington's Farms at Mt.

They were kept busy year round, their tasks varying with the season.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 117\u2013118</ref> The remainder worked as domestic servants in the main residence or as artisans, such as carpenters, [[joiner]]s, [[Cooper (profession)|coopers]], [[Hand spinning|spinners]] and seamstresses.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 109\u2013111</ref> Between 1766 and 1799, seven dower slaves worked at one time or another as overseers.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 86, 343\u2013344</ref> Slaves were expected to work from sunrise to sunset over a six-day work week that was standard on Virginia plantations. With two hours off for meals, their workdays would range between seven and a half hours to thirteen hours, depending on season. They were given three or four days off at Christmas and a day each at Easter and [[Whitsunday]].<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 106\u2013107, 122\u2013123</ref> Domestic slaves started early, worked into the evenings and did not necessarily have Sundays and holidays free.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 110, 124, 134</ref> On special occasions when slaves were required to put in extra effort, such as working through a holiday or bringing in the harvest, they were paid or compensated with extra time off.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 123\u2013124</ref>\n\nThere were elements of patriarchy and paternalism in Washington's attitudes to his workforce; he thought of his workers as part of an extended family in which he occupied the position of a father figure, with mutual obligations between master and servant.<ref>Morgan 2000 p. 282</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 45\u201348</ref> He instructed his overseers to treat slaves \"with humanity and tenderness\" when sick.<ref name=Morgan2005-410 /> Slaves who were less able, through injury, disability or age, were given light duties, while those too sick to work were generally, though not always, excused work while they recovered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 120, 125</ref> Washington provided them with good, sometimes costly medical care{{snd}}when a slave named Cupid fell ill with [[pleurisy]], Washington had him taken to the main house where he could be better cared for and personally checked on him throughout the day.<ref>Twohig 2003 p. 117</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 100</ref> The humanitarian concern for the welfare of his slaves was mixed with an economic consideration for the lost productivity arising from sickness and death among the labor force.<ref name=\"Twohig 2001 p. 116\">Twohig 2001 p. 116</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 46</ref> Although Washington insisted on an emotional distance between master and slave, there are examples of genuine affection, such as was the case with his valet [[William Lee (valet)|William Lee]], and evidence that slaves were able to approach him with their concerns and grievances.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 51\u201353, 97</ref>\n\n===Living conditions===\n[[File:Slave cabin at pioneer farm - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|left|Modern reconstruction of a slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph]]\nAt the main residence, most slaves were housed in a two-story [[Framing (construction)|frame building]] known as the \"Quarters for Families\". This was replaced in 1792 by brick-built accommodation wings either side of the greenhouse comprising four rooms in total, each of some {{convert|600|sqft|m2}}. The [[Mount Vernon Ladies' Association]] have concluded these rooms were communal areas furnished with bunks that allowed little privacy for the predominantly male occupants. Other slaves at the main residence lived over the outbuildings where they worked or in log cabins.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162\u2013164, 166\u2013167</ref> Such cabins were the standard slave accommodation at the outlying farms, comparable to the accommodation occupied by the lower strata of free white society across the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake area]] and by slaves on other Virginia plantations.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162, 167, 169</ref> They provided a single room that ranged in size from 168 square feet (15.6 m2) to 246 square feet (22.9 m2) to house a family.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168\u2013169</ref> The cabins were often poorly constructed, daubed with mud for draft- and water-proofing, with dirt floors. Some cabins were built as duplexes; some single-unit cabins were small enough to be moved with carts.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168, 170</ref> There are few sources which shed light on living conditions in these cabins, but one visitor in 1798 wrote, \"husband and wife sleep on a mean pallet, the children on the ground; a very bad fireplace, some utensils for cooking, but in the middle of this poverty some cups and a teapot.\" Other sources suggest the interiors were smokey, dirty and dark, with only a shuttered opening for a window and the fireplace for illumination at night.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 170\u2013172</ref>\n\nWashington provided slaves with a blanket each fall at most, which they used for their own bedding and which they were required to use to gather leaves for livestock bedding.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 175\u2013176</ref> Slaves at the outlying farms were issued with a basic set of clothing each year, comparable to the clothing issued on other Virginia plantations. Slaves slept and worked in their clothes, leaving them to spend many months in garments that were worn, ripped and tattered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 177\u2013178</ref> Domestic slaves at the main residence who came into regular contact with visitors were better clothed; butlers, waiters and body servants were dressed in a [[livery]] based on the three-piece suit of an 18th-century gentleman, and maids were provided with finer quality clothing than their counterparts in the fields.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 179\u2013181</ref>\n\nWashington desired his slaves to be fed adequately but no more.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 244\u2013245</ref> Each slave was provided with a basic daily food ration of {{convert|1|USqt|l|spell=in}} or more of [[cornmeal]], up to {{convert|8|oz|g|spell=in}} of herring and occasionally some meat, a fairly typical ration for slaves in Virginia that was adequate in terms of the calorie requirement for a young man engaged in moderately heavy agricultural labor but nutritionally deficient.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 221\u2013222, 245</ref> The basic ration was supplemented by slaves' own efforts hunting (for which some slaves were allowed guns) and trapping game. They grew their own vegetables in small garden plots they were permitted to maintain in their own time, on which they also reared poultry.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 229\u2013231</ref>\n\nWashington often tipped slaves on his visits to other estates, and it is likely that his own slaves were similarly rewarded by visitors to Mount Vernon. Slaves occasionally earned money through their normal work or for particular services rendered{{snd}}for example, Washington rewarded three of his own slaves with cash for good service in 1775, a slave received a fee for the care of a mare that was being bred in 1798 and the chef [[Hercules (chef)|Hercules]] profited well by selling slops from the presidential kitchen.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 193\u2013194</ref> Slaves also earned money from their own endeavors, by selling to Washington or at the market in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] food they had caught or grown and small items they had made.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 197, 231</ref> They used the proceeds to purchase from Washington or the shops in Alexandria better clothing, housewares and extra provisions such as flour, pork, whiskey, tea, coffee and sugar.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 194, 195\u2013196, 232</ref>\n\n===Family and community===\n[[File:Slave Cabin interior 01 - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|Interior of the reconstructed slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph showing single bedding on a pallet on a dirt floor]]\nAlthough the law did not recognize slave marriages, Washington did, and by 1799 some two-thirds of the adult slaves at Mount Vernon were married.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 128</ref> To minimize time lost in getting to the workplace and thus increase productivity, slaves were accommodated at the farm on which they worked. Because of the unequal distribution of males and females across the five farms, slaves often found partners on different farms, and in their day to day lives husbands were routinely separated from their wives and children. Only thirty-six of the ninety-six married slaves at Mount Vernon in 1799 lived together, while thirty-eight had spouses who lived on separate farms and twenty-two had spouses who lived on other plantations.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 122</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 132\u2013133</ref> The evidence suggests couples that were separated did not regularly visit during the week, and doing so prompted complaints from Washington that slaves were too exhausted to work after such \"night walking\", leaving Saturday nights/Sundays and holidays as the main time such families could spend together.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 134, 136, 202</ref> Despite the stress and anxiety caused by this indifference to family stability{{snd}}on one occasion an overseer wrote that the separation of families \"seems like death to them\"{{snd}}marriage was the foundation on which slaves established their own community, and longevity in these unions was not uncommon.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 127, 130\u2013131, 132</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 123</ref>\n\nLarge families that covered multiple generations, along with their attendant marriages, were part of a slave community-building process that transcended ownership. Washington's head carpenter Isaac, for example, lived with his wife Kitty, a dower-slave milkmaid, at Mansion House Farm. The couple had nine daughters ranging in age from six to twenty-seven in 1799, and the marriages of four of those daughters had extended the family to other farms within and outside the Mount Vernon estate and produced three grandchildren.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\">Thompson 2019 p. 135</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 p. 421</ref> Children were born into slavery, their ownership determined by the ownership of their mothers.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\">Thompson 2019 p. 309</ref> The value attached to the birth of a slave child, if it was noted at all, is indicated in the weekly report of one overseer, which stated, \"Increase 9 Lambs & 1 male child of Lynnas.\" New mothers received a new blanket and three to five weeks of light duties to recover. An infant remained with its mother at her place of work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 151\u2013152</ref> Older children, the majority of whom lived in single-parent households in which the mother worked from dawn to dusk, performed small family chores but were otherwise left to play largely unsupervised until they reached an age when they could begin to be put to work for Washington, usually somewhere between eleven and fourteen years old.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 158\u2013160</ref> In 1799, nearly sixty percent of the slave population was under nineteen years old and nearly thirty-five percent under nine.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\"/>\n\nThere is evidence that slaves passed on their African cultural values through telling stories, among them [[Joel Chandler Harris]]'s tales of [[Br'er Rabbit]] which, with their origins in Africa and stories of a powerless individual triumphing through wit and intelligence over powerful authority, would have resonated with the slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 203</ref> African-born slaves brought with them some of the religious rituals of their ancestral home, and there is an undocumented tradition of voodoo being practiced at one of the Mount Vernon farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 211\u2013213</ref> Although the slave condition made it impossible to adhere to the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], some slave names betray a Muslim cultural origin.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 213\u2013214</ref> [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] reached out to American-born slaves in Virginia, and some of the Mount Vernon slaves are known to have been christened before Washington acquired the estate. There is evidence in the historical record from 1797 that Mount Vernon slaves had contacts with [[Baptists]], [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Quakers]].<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 208\u2013209</ref> The three religions advocated abolition, raising hopes of freedom among the slaves, and the congregation of the Alexandria Baptist Church, founded in 1803, included slaves formerly owned by Washington.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 209, 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n===Mulattoes===\nIn 1799 there were some twenty [[mulatto]] (mixed race) slaves at Mount Vernon. The probability of paternal relationships between slaves and hired white workers is indicated by some surnames: Betty and Tom Davis, probably the children of Thomas Davis, a white weaver at Mount Vernon in the 1760s; George Young, likely the son of a man of the same name who was a clerk at Mount Vernon in 1774; and [[Oney Judge]] and her sister Delphy, the daughters of Andrew Judge, an indentured tailor at Mount Vernon in the 1770s and 1780s.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 138\u2013139</ref> There is evidence to suggest that white overseers{{snd}}working in close proximity to slaves under the same demanding master and physically and socially isolated from their own peer group, a situation that drove some to drink{{snd}}indulged in sexual relations with their charges.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 140\u2013141</ref> Some white visitors to Mount Vernon seemed to have expected slave women to provide sexual favors.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 141\u2013142</ref> The living arrangements left some slave females alone and vulnerable, and the Mount Vernon research historian Mary V. Thompson writes that relationships \"could have been the result of mutual attraction and affection, very real demonstrations of power and control, or even exercises in the manipulation of an authority figure.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 140</ref>{{efn|There is an oral tradition among the descendants of the freedman [[West Ford (slave)|West Ford]] that he was the son of Washington and Venus, a slave belonging to Washington's brother [[John Augustine Washington]]. A case made by the historian Henry Wiencek is, according to the historian Philip Morgan, \"so circumstantial as to be fanciful,\" and there is no evidence that Washington ever met Venus, let alone fathered a child by her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 147\u2013151</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 419, 420 n26</ref>}}\n\n===Resistance===\n[[File:Oney Judge Runaway Ad.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement placed in the ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' after Oney Judge absconded from the President's House in 1796|alt=Newspaper clipping]]\nThe frequent comments Washington made about \"rogueries\" and \"old tricks\" indicate the resistance of the slaves against the system.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 261</ref> The most common act of resistance was theft, so common that Washington made allowances for it as part of normal wastage. Food was stolen both to supplement rations and to sell, and Washington believed the selling of tools was another source of income for slaves. Because cloth and clothing were commonly stolen, Washington required seamstresses to show the results of their work and the leftover scraps before issuing them with more material. Sheep were washed before shearing to prevent the theft of wool, and storage areas were kept locked and keys left with trusted individuals.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 269\u2013271</ref> In 1792, Washington ordered the culling of slaves' dogs he believed were being used in a spate of livestock theft and ruled that slaves who nevertheless kept dogs without authorization were to be \"severely punished\" and their dogs hanged.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 201</ref>\n\nAnother means by which slaves resisted, one that was virtually impossible to prove, was feigning illness. Over the years Washington became increasingly skeptical about absenteeism due to sickness among his slaves and concerned about the diligence or ability of his overseers in recognizing genuine cases. Between 1792 and 1794, while Washington was away from Mount Vernon as President, the number of days lost to sickness increased tenfold compared to 1786, when he was resident at Mount Vernon and able to control the situation personally. In one case, Washington suspected a slave of frequently avoiding work over a period of decades through acts of deliberate self harm.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 261\u2013263, 264\u2013265</ref>\n\nSlaves asserted some independence and frustrated Washington by the pace and quality of their work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 105, 265</ref> In 1760, Washington noted that four of his carpenters quadrupled their output of timber under his personal supervision.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 93\u201394</ref> Thirty-five years later, he described his carpenters as an \"idle...set of rascals\" who would take a month or more to complete at Mount Vernon work that was being done in two or three days in Philadelphia. The output of seamstresses dropped off when Martha was away, and spinners found they could slacken by playing the overseers off against Martha.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266\u2013267</ref> Tools were regularly lost or damaged, thus stopping work, and Washington despaired of employing innovations that might improve efficiency because he believed the slaves were too clumsy to operate the new machinery involved.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266, 268</ref>\n\nThe most emphatic act of resistance was to run away, and between 1760 and 1799 at least forty-seven slaves under Washington's control did so.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 275</ref> Seventeen of these, fourteen men and three women, escaped to a British warship that anchored in the Potomac near Mount Vernon in 1781.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 278, 279</ref> In general, the best chance of success lay with second- or third-generation African-American slaves who had good English, possessed skills that would allow them to support themselves as free people and were in close enough contact with their masters to receive special privileges. Thus it was that Judge, an especially talented seamstress, and Hercules escaped in 1796 and 1797 respectively and eluded recapture.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 281, 284\u2013286</ref> Washington took seriously the recapture of fugitives, and in three cases an escaped slave was sold off in the West Indies after recapture, effectively a death sentence in the severe conditions slaves had to endure there.<ref name=\"Wiencek 2003 p. 132\">Wiencek 2003 p. 132</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 411\u2013412</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 161</ref>\n\n===Control===\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=25%\n|quote=Slavery was a system in which enslaved people lived in fear; fear of being sold, fear of being separated from their families or their children or their parents, fear of not being in control of their bodies or their lives, fear of never knowing freedom.

And that was the psycholgical violence of slavery. That's how slave owners maintained control over enslaved people.\n|author=Jessie MacLeod<br/>Associate Curator<br/>George Washington's Mount Vernon<ref>MacLeod</ref>}}\nWashington used both reward and punishment to encourage discipline and productivity in his slaves.<ref name=Hirschfeld36>Hirschfeld p. 36</ref> In one case he suggested \"admonition and advice\" would be more effective than \"further correction\", and he occasionally appealed to a slave's sense of pride to encourage better performance. Rewards in the form of better blankets and clothing fabric were given to the \"most deserving\", and there are examples of cash payments being awarded for good behavior.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 259\u2013260</ref> He opposed the use of the lash in principle, but saw the practice as a necessary evil and sanctioned its occasional use, generally as a last resort, on both male and female slaves if they did not, in his words, \"do their duty by fair means.\"<ref name=Hirschfeld36 /> There are accounts of carpenters being whipped in 1758 when the overseer \"could see a fault\", of a slave called Jemmy being whipped for stealing corn and escaping in 1773 and of a seamstress called Charlotte being whipped in 1793 by an overseer \"determined to lower Spirit or skin her Back\" for impudence and refusing to work.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 125</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 248, 432 n6 & n7</ref>\n\nWashington regarded the \"passion\" with which one of his overseers administered floggings to be counter-productive, and Charlotte's protest that she had not been whipped in fourteen years indicates the frequency with which physical punishment was used.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 125\u2013126</ref><ref>MVLA Resistance & Punishment</ref> Whippings were administered by overseers after review, a system Washington required to ensure slaves were spared capricious and extreme punishment.

One wrote that \"in private and particularly with his servants, its violence sometimes broke out.\" Another reported that Washington's servants \"seemed to watch his eye and to anticipate his every wish; hence a look was equivalent to a command.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 43\u201345</ref> Threats of demotion to fieldwork, corporal punishment and being shipped to the West Indies were part of the system by which he controlled his slaves.<ref name=\"Wiencek 2003 p. 132\"/><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 247\u2013248, 249\u2013250</ref>\n\n==Evolution of Washington's attitudes==\n[[File:Junius Brutus Stearns - George Washington as Farmer at Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Painting|''Washington as Farmer at Mount Vernon'' by [[Junius Brutus Stearns]] (1851)]]\nWashington's early views on slavery were no different from any Virginia [[Planter class|planter]] of the time.<ref name=\"Twohig 2001 p. 116\"/> He demonstrated no moral qualms about the institution and referred to his slaves as \"a Species of Property.\"<ref>Ellis 2004 p. 45</ref> The economics of slavery prompted the first doubts in Washington about the institution, marking the beginning of a slow evolution in his attitude towards it. By 1766, he had transitioned his business from the labor-intensive planting of tobacco to the less demanding farming of grain crops. His slaves were employed on a greater variety of tasks that needed more skills than tobacco planting required of them; as well as the cultivation of grains and vegetables, they were employed in cattle herding, spinning, weaving and carpentry. The transition left Washington with a surplus of slaves and revealed to him the inefficiencies of the slave labor system.<ref name=Morgan2005p413>Morgan 2005 p. 413</ref><ref name=Twohig118>Twohig 2001 p. 118</ref>\n\nThere is little evidence that Washington seriously questioned the ethics of slavery before the Revolution.<ref name=Twohig118 /> In the 1760s he often participated in tavern lotteries, events in which defaulters' debts were settled by raffling off their assets to a high-spirited crowd.<ref>Chernow 2010 p. 162</ref> In 1769, Washington co-managed one such lottery in which fifty-five slaves were sold, among them six families and five females with children. The more valuable married males were raffled together with their wives and children; less valuable slaves were separated from their families into different lots. Robin and Bella, for example, were raffled together as husband and wife while their children, twelve-year-old Sukey and seven-year-old Betty, were listed in a separate lot. Only chance dictated whether the family would remain together, and with 1,840 tickets on sale the odds were not good.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 178\u2013180</ref>\n\nThe historian [[Henry Wiencek]] concludes that the repugnance Washington felt at this cruelty in which he had participated prompted his decision not to break up slave families by sale or purchase, and marks the beginning of a transformation in Washington's thinking about the morality of slavery.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 135, 188</ref> Wiencek writes that in 1775 Washington took more slaves than he needed rather than break up the family of a slave he had agreed to accept in payment of a debt.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 188</ref> The historians [[Philip D.

Morgan writes that in 1772, Washington was \"all business\" and \"might have been buying livestock\" in purchasing more slaves who were to be, in Washington's words, \"strait Limb'd, & in every respect strong & likely, with good Teeth & good Countenance.\" Morgan gives a different account of the 1775 purchase, writing that Washington resold the slave because of the slave's resistance to being separated from family and that the decision to do so was \"no more than the conventional piety of large Virginia planters who usually said they did not want to break up slave families{{snd}}and often did it anyway.\"<ref name=Morgan2005p412>Morgan 2005 p. 412</ref><ref name=Henriques159>Henriques 2008 p. 159</ref>\n\n===American Revolution===\n[[File:List of George Washington's taxable property in Truro Parish Virginia including slaves 1788.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Washington's taxable property in April 1788: 121 slaves, 98 horses, 4 mules and a chariot|alt=Original document]]\nFrom the late 1760s, Washington became increasingly radicalized against the North American colonies' subservient status within the [[British Empire]].<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 69</ref> In 1774 he was a key participant in agreeing the [[Fairfax Resolves]] which, alongside the assertion of colonial rights, condemned the [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slave trade]] on moral grounds.<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 75</ref><ref name=Twohig118 /> He began to express the growing rift with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in terms of slavery, stating in the summer of 1774 that the British authorities were \"endeavouring by every piece of Art & despotism to fix the Shackles of Slavry{{sic}}\" upon the colonies.

Five of the six were published in or after 1788.{{efn|''Tracts on Slavery'' was one volume in a set of thirty-six that Washington had bound probably sometime after 1795. The volumes covered subjects that generally were of importance to him, such as agriculture, the Revolution, the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] and politics. The single pre-1788 pamphlet of the six in ''Tracts on Slavery'' was ''A Serious Address to the Rulers of America, on the Inconsistency of Their Conduct Respecting Slavery'', published in 1783. It was the first pamphlet in the volume, and Washington had written his signature on the cover, as he did with the first pamphlet in each of the thirty-six volumes. Of the eleven pamphlets on slavery that were, presumably, not considered to be worth binding, eight were published before 1788. One of them, published in 1785, was never read. The implication is that Washington became more interested in the subject in the early 1790s.<ref>Furstenberg 2011 pp. 251\u2013253, 260, 263\u2013264</ref>}} All six shared common themes that slaves first had to be educated about the obligations of liberty before they could be emancipated, a belief Washington is reported to have expressed himself in 1798, and that abolition should be realized by a gradual legislative process, an idea that began to appear in Washington's correspondence during the [[Confederation Period|Confederation period]].<ref>Furstenberg 2011 pp. 250\u2013253, 273\u2013275, 285</ref><ref name=\"Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373\">Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n\nWashington was not impressed by what Dorothy Twohig{{snd}}a former editor-in-chief of [[The Washington Papers]]{{snd}}described as the \"imperious demands\" and \"evangelical piety\" of Quaker efforts to advance abolition, and in 1786 he complained about their \"tamper[ing] with & seduc[ing]\" slaves who \"are happy & content to remain with their present masters.\"<ref>Twohig 2001 p. 129</ref><ref name=Morgan2005p419>Morgan 2005 p. 419</ref> Only the most radical of abolitionists called for immediate emancipation.

On returning to France, Lafayette purchased a plantation in the French colony of Cayenne, modern-day [[French Guiana]], and advised Washington of his progress by letter in 1786. Lafayette had taken concerns about the abrupt emancipation of slaves into account, paying and educating the slaves he settled on the plantation before freeing them. He became a leading figure in antislavery movements in France and Great Britain. Washington would not have known of Lafayette's antislavery activities in Cayenne or Europe from Lafayette himself; although the two continued to correspond for the rest of Washington's life, the subject of slavery virtually disappeared from their letters.

He presided over the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, during which it became obvious just how explosive the issue was and how willing the antislavery faction was to sacrifice abolition on the altar of national unity under a strong federal government. The support of the southern states for the new constitution was secured by granting them concessions that protected slavery, including the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] and the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]], plus clauses that guaranteed the transatlantic slave trade for at least twenty years and federal aid for the suppression of any slave rebellion.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 422</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 124\u2013125</ref>\n\nWashington's preeminent position ensured that any actions he took with regard to his own slaves would become a statement in a national debate about slavery that threatened to divide the country.

A passage in the notebook of Washington's biographer [[David Humphreys (soldier)|David Humphreys]]{{efn|Humphreys was a former aide to Washington and had begun an eighteen-month stay at Mount Vernon in 1787 to assist Washington with his correspondence and write his biography.<ref>Ellis 2004 p. 153</ref>}} dated to late 1788 or early 1789 recorded a statement that presaged Washington's emancipation of his slaves in his will a decade later. Wiencek argues the passage was a draft for a public announcement Washington was considering in which he would declare the emancipation of some of his slaves. It marks, Wiencek believes, a moral epiphany in Washington's thinking, the moment he decided not only to emancipate his slaves but also to use the occasion to set the example Lafayette had urged in 1783.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\">Wiencek 2003 pp. 272\u2013275</ref> Other historians dispute Wiencek's conclusion; Henriques and [[Joseph Ellis]] concur with Philip Morgan's opinion that Washington experienced no epiphanies in a \"long and hard-headed struggle\" in which there was no single turning point. Morgan argues that Humphreys' passage is the \"private expression of remorse\" from a man unable to extricate himself from the \"tangled web\" of \"mutual dependency\" on slavery, and that Washington believed public comment on such a divisive subject was best avoided for the sake of national unity.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 421\u2013423, 425</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 311 n22</ref><ref name=Henriques159 />{{efn|Wiencek bases his argument on the fact that the passage was written in the past tense and appears in Humphreys' notebook amid drafts Humphreys had written for public statements Washington was to make about assuming the presidency.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\" /> Philip Morgan points out that the passage was Humphreys' words in Washington's voice and appears just after a summary Humphreys had written of [[Thomas Clarkson]]'s 1788 ''An Essay on the Impolicy of the African Slave Trade''.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 423 n31</ref> Kenneth Morgan characterizes the passage as \"a remark made in [Washington's] voice by David Humphreys.\"<ref name=Morgan2000p298 /> Fritz Hirschfeld writes that the passage was written by Humphreys during direct dictation or from memory of Washington's exact words, and believes it highly improbable that they were not Washington's own words.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 213 n5</ref>}}\n\n====As President====\n{{See also|Presidency of George Washington}}\n[[File:George Washington 1795.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|''President George Washington'' by Gilbert Stuart (1795) |alt=Portrait painting]]\nWashington took up the presidency at a time when revolutionary sentiment against slavery was giving way to a resurgence of proslavery interests.

[[Martha Parke Custis Peter|Young Martha]] brought sixty-one slaves to her marriage with Thomas Peter in 1795, [[Elizabeth Parke Custis Law|Eliza]] married [[Thomas Law (1756\u20131834)|Thomas Law]] the next year and [[Eleanor Parke Custis Lewis|Nelly]] was wed to [[Lawrence Lewis (1767\u20131839)|Lawrence Lewis]] in 1799. Peter had begun selling off slaves soon after his marriage, splitting up families and systematically separating girls as young as four years old from their parents. Wiencek suggests Martha's servant [[Oney Judge|Ona Judge]], who as a dower slave was destined to become a Custis property, fled from Philadelphia in 1796 to avoid being sold.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 338\u2013342</ref>}} None of these schemes could be realized because of his failure to sell or rent land at the right prices, the refusal of the Custis heirs to agree to them and his own reluctance to separate families.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 423\u2013424</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 342</ref> Wiencek speculates that, because Washington gave such serious consideration to freeing his slaves knowing full well the political ramifications that would follow, one of his goals was to make a public statement that would sway opinion towards abolition.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 342\u2013343</ref> Philip Morgan argues that Washington freeing his slaves while President in 1794 or 1796 would have had no profound effect, and would have been greeted with public silence and private derision by white southerners.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 428\u2013429</ref>\n\nAs Washington subordinated his desire for emancipation to his efforts to secure financial independence, he took care to retain his slaves.<ref>Ellis 2004 pp. 258\u2013260</ref> In 1791, he arranged for those who served in his personal retinue while he was President in Philadelphia to be rotated out of the state before they became eligible for emancipation after six months residence per [[An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery|Pennsylvanian law]]. Not only would Washington have been deprived of their services if they were freed, most of the slaves he took with him to Philadelphia were dower slaves, which meant that he would have had to compensate the Custis estate for the loss. Because of his concerns for his public image and that the prospect of emancipation would generate discontent among the slaves before they became eligible for emancipation, he instructed that they be shuffled back to Mount Vernon \"under pretext that may deceive both them and the Public.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 59\u201360</ref>\n\nWashington spared no expense in efforts to recover Hercules and Judge when they absconded. In Judge's case, Washington persisted for three years. He tried to persuade her to return when his agent eventually tracked her to New Hampshire, but refused to promise her her freedom after his death; \"However well disposed I might be to a gradual emancipation,\" he said, \"or even to an entire emancipation of that description of People (if the latter was in itself practicable at this moment) it would neither be politic or just to reward unfaithfulness with a premature preference.\" Both Hercules and Judge eluded capture.<ref name=\"Ellis 2004 p. 260\"/> Washington's search for a new chef to replace Hercules in 1797 is the last known instance in which he considered buying a slave, despite his resolve \"never to become the Master of another Slave by purchase\", though in the end he chose to hire a white chef.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 15</ref>\n\n==Posthumous emancipation==\n[[File:GW-will.jpg|thumb|Washington's will published in the Connecticut Journal, February 20, 1800|alt=newspaper clipping]]\nIn July 1799, five months before his death, Washington wrote his will, in which he stipulated that his slaves should be freed. In the months that followed, he considered a plan that betrayed a continuing prioritisation of profit above his concerns about the institution of slavery. The plan involved repossessing tenancies in [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley]] and [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]] Counties and transferring half of his Mount Vernon slaves to work them. It would, Washington hoped, \"yield more nett profit\" which might \"benefit myself and not render the [slaves'] condition worse\", despite the disruption such relocation would have had on the slave families. The plan died with Washington on December 14, 1799.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 404, 424</ref>{{efn|Philip Morgan speculates on the unlikely possibility that, had the plan proved profitable, Washington might have changed his will and retracted the manumission of his slaves.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 425</ref>}}\n\nWashington's slaves were the subjects of the longest provisions in the twenty-nine-page will, taking three pages in which his instructions were more forceful than in the rest of the document. His valet, William Lee, was freed immediately and his remaining 123 slaves were to be emancipated on the death of Martha.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 5</ref><ref name=Morgan2005p404 /> The deferral was intended to postpone the pain of separation that would occur when his slaves were freed but their spouses among the dower slaves remained in bondage, a situation which affected twenty couples and their children. It is possible Washington hoped Martha and her heirs who would inherit the dower slaves would solve this problem by following his example and emancipating them.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 354</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 216</ref><ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\"/> Those too old or infirm to work were to be supported by his estate, as mandated by state law. Washington went beyond the legal requirement to support and maintain younger slaves until adulthood, stipulating that those children whose education could not be undertaken by parents were to be taught reading, writing and a useful trade by their masters and then be freed at the age of twenty-five.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 294</ref> Washington was particularly pointed in forbidding the sale or transportation of any of his slaves out of Virginia before their emancipation.<ref name=Morgan2005p404 /> Including the Dandridge slaves, who were emancipated under similar terms, more than 160 slaves were freed.<ref name=\"Morgan2005pp404\u2013405\" /><ref name=gwpapers /> Although he was not alone among Virginian slaveowners in freeing their slaves, he was the only Founding Father to do so.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 427</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Slave Memorial - Mt. Vernon.jpg|thumb|right|Slave burial ground memorial at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph]]\nAny hopes Washington may have had that his example and prestige would influence the thinking of others, including his own family, proved to be unfounded. His action was ignored by southern slaveholders, and slavery continued at Mount Vernon.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 359</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 216\u2013217</ref> Already from 1795, dower slaves were being transferred to Martha's three granddaughters as the Custis heirs married.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 341</ref> Martha felt threatened by the fact that she was surrounded with slaves whose freedom depended on her death and freed her late husband's slaves on January 1, 1801.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 311</ref>{{efn|There is a suggestion that slaves were implicated in starting a fire at the main residence after Washington's death, and there were rumors that Martha was in danger, including one that slaves planned to poison her. Other factors that may have influenced her decision to free Washington's slaves early include concerns about the expense of maintaining slaves that were not necessary to operate the estate and about discontent among the dower slaves if they continued to mix with slaves who were to be freed.<ref>Schwartz 2017 pp. 29\u201333</ref>}}\n\nThe able-bodied slaves were cut loose and left to support themselves and their families.<ref>Schwartz 2017 pp. 34\u201335</ref> Within a few months, almost all of Washington's former slaves had left Mount Vernon, leaving 121 adult and working-age children still working the estate. Five freedwomen were listed as remaining: an unmarried mother of two children; two women, one of them with three children, married to Washington slaves too old to work; and two women who were married to dower slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 311\u2013312</ref> William Lee remained at Mount Vernon, where he worked as a shoemaker.<ref>Schwartz 2017 p. 27</ref> After Martha's death on May 22, 1802, most of the remaining dower slaves passed to her grandson, [[George Washington Parke Custis]], to whom she bequeathed the only slave she held in her own name.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 341, 358</ref>\n\nThere are few records of how the newly freed slaves fared.<ref>Schwartz 2017 p. 35</ref> Custis later wrote that \"although many of them, with a view to their liberation, had been instructed in mechanic trades, yet they succeeded very badly as freemen; so true is the axiom, 'that the hour which makes man a slave, takes half his worth away'.\" The son-in-law of Custis's sister wrote in 1853 that the descendants of those who remained slaves, many of them now in his possession, had been \"prosperous, contented and happy,\" while those who had been freed had led a life of \"vice, dissipation and idleness\" and had, in their \"sickness, age and poverty\", become a burden to his in-laws.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 316</ref> Such reports were influenced by the innate racism of the well-educated, upper-class authors and ignored the social and legal impediments that prejudiced the chances of prosperity for former slaves, which included laws that made it illegal to teach freedpeople to read and write and, in 1806, required newly freed slaves to leave the state.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 317, 449 n83</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 215</ref>\n\nThere is evidence that some of Washington's former slaves were able to buy land, support their families and prosper as free people. By 1812, Free Town in [[Truro Parish, Virginia|Truro Parish]], the earliest known free black settlement in Fairfax County, contained seven households of former Washington slaves. By the mid 1800s, a son of Washington's carpenter Davy Jones and two grandsons of his [[postilion]] Joe Richardson had each bought land in Virginia. Francis Lee, younger brother of William, was well known and respected enough to have his obituary printed in the ''Alexandria Gazette'' on his death at Mount Vernon in 1821. Sambo Anderson{{snd}}who hunted game, as he had while Washington's slave, and prospered for a while by selling it to the most respectable families in Alexandria{{snd}}was similarly noted by the gazette when he died near Mount Vernon in 1845.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 317\u2013319</ref> Research published in 2019 has concluded that Hercules worked as a cook in New York, where he died on May 15, 1812.<ref>Ganeshram 2019</ref>\n\nA decade after Washington's death, the Pennsylvanian jurist [[Richard Peters (Continental Congress)|Richard Peters]] wrote that Washington's servants \"were devoted to him; and especially those more immediately about his person. The survivors of them still venerate and adore his memory.\" In his old age, Anderson said he was \"a much happier man when he was a slave than he had ever been since,\" because he then \"had a good kind master to look after all my wants, but now I have no one to care for me.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 322\u2013323</ref> When Judge was interviewed in the 1840s, she expressed considerable bitterness, not at the way she he had been treated as a slave, but at the fact that she had been enslaved. When asked, having experienced the hardships of being a freewoman and having outlived both husband and children, whether she regretted her escape, she replied, \"No, I am free, and have, I trust, been made a child of God by [that] means.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 288\u2013289</ref>\n\n===Political legacy===\nWashington's will was both private testament and public statement on the institution.<ref name=Morgan2005p404>Morgan 2005 p. 404</ref><ref name=Morgan2000p298>Morgan 2000 p. 298</ref> It was published widely{{snd}}in newspapers nationwide, as a pamphlet which, in 1800 alone, extended to thirteen separate editions, and included in other works{{snd}}and became part of the nationalist narrative.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 84\u201385</ref> In the eulogies of the antislavery faction, the inconvenient fact of Washington's slaveholding was downplayed in favor of his final act of emancipation. Washington \"disdained to hold his fellow-creatures in abject domestic servitude,\" wrote the Massachusetts Federalist [[Timothy Bigelow (lawyer)|Timothy Bigelow]] before calling on \"fellow-citizens in the South\" to emulate Washington's example. In this narrative, Washington was a proto-abolitionist who, having added the freedom of his slaves to the freedom from British slavery he had won for the nation, would be mobilized to serve the antislavery cause.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 84\u201386</ref>\n\nAn alternative narrative more in line with proslavery sentiments embraced rather than excised Washington's ownership of slaves. Washington was cast as a paternal figure, the benevolent father not only of his country but also of a family of slaves bound to him by affection rather than coercion.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 92\u201394</ref> In this narrative, slaves idolized Washington and wept at his deathbed, and in an 1807 biography, [[Aaron Bancroft]] wrote, \"In domestick{{sic}} and private life, he blended the authority of the master with the care and kindness of the guardian and friend.\"<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 94, 96\u201397</ref> The competing narratives allowed both [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] and [[Confederate States of America|South]] to claim Washington as the father of their countries during the [[American Civil War]] that ended slavery more than half a century after his death.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 100\u2013101</ref>\n\n===Memorial===\nIn 1929, a plaque was embedded in the ground at Mount Vernon less than {{convert|50|yd|m|round=5}} from the crypt housing the remains of Washington and Martha, marking a plot neglected by both groundsmen and tourist guides where slaves had been buried in unmarked graves. The inscription read, \"In memory of the many faithful colored servants of the Washington family, buried at Mount Vernon from 1760 to 1860. Their unidentified graves surround this spot.\" The site remained untended and ignored in the visitor literature until the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association erected a more prominent monument surrounded with plantings and inscribed, \"In memory of the Afro Americans who served as slaves at Mount Vernon this monument marking their burial ground dedicated September 21, 1983.\" In 1985, a [[ground-penetrating radar]] survey identified sixty-six possible burials. As of late 2017, an archaeological project begun in 2014 has identified, without disturbing the contents, sixty-three burial plots in addition to seven plots known before the project began.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 217\u2013218</ref><ref>MVLA Slave Burial Ground Archaeology</ref><ref>MVLA Forgotten No Longer</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Chernow |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Chernow |title=Washington, A Life |title-link=Washington: A Life |type=E-Book |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London, United Kingdom |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-141-96610-6 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Joseph J. |authorlink=Joseph Ellis |title=His Excellency: George Washington |publisher=Alfred A.

On the other side Mohan Bhatnagar ([[Kunal Karan Kapoor]]) an honest and daring reporter who works for a Hindi news daily called ''Prabhat Leher''. Megha and Mohan's journey starts hating each other due to some misunderstandings. Meanwhile, Mohan befriends with Navika (nanhi)([[Ashnoor Kaur]]) Daughter of Megha when Mohan helps her in printing an ad - not knowing that it's a matrimonial ad for her widowed mother Megha, this intensifies Megha's hate for Mohan even though Mohan didn't do it intentionally.\n\nThe story turns interesting when Mohan collects evidence against Amar vyas and produces it in front of the committee which was constituted to look into the case of the flyover collapse for which Amar was held responsible, initially Mohan backsteps about presenting evidence before committee after learning that he is Navika's father and Megha's late husband, but his ideals and principles force him to go against them. This makes Megha furious and he also loses the friendship of Navika however they get reconciled after some time.\nDue to financial problems, Megha starts working in ''Prabhat Leher'' the same newspaper Mohan works for. Mohan learns that the evidence he presented in front of committee is fake and he was betrayed by Dinanath a rich Industrialist and the real man behind collapse of flyover and deliberately implicated dead Amar vyas for escaping from imprisonment. Mohan repents for his blunder and asks for Megha's forgiveness for falsely implicating her honest late husband. Mohan starts admiring the inner strength of Megha and her commitment towards her family and children. Mohan develops respect for Megha for her bold, simple, and caring for others nature who eventually falls in love with her but he doesn't express it to anyone not even to his servant and friend Guru who always makes fun of him by linking him to Megha indirectly.\n\nMohan helps Megha from her boss Pratik who tries to misbehave with her. Megha then understands the true intentions of Mohan and both become good friends after that. Megha helps Mohan in challenging her Ex-girlfriend Rashmi when she insults Mohan for being unsuccessful in his life and also mocks him that he can't get a wife like her in his life. Megha persuades Mohan to pretend him as her husband and both go to the farmhouse of Rashmi and spends a day there with which Mohan's love for Megha augments. Later Mohan yelps Megha in proving her husband's innocence by going to Bhopal along with Megha and her father in law and procures evidence to prove Amar's innocence with some twists and turns in the plot which will thrill audiences.                             \nAfter proving Amar's innocence Mohan reveals his feelings for Megha but Megha leaves unanswered as she doesn't want to hurt him by rejecting his love and she is afraid of losing friendship with Mohan. But, when Mohan goes to cover a story about drug Mafia he gets shot by the mafia. Megha takes him to the hospital and the fear of losing him makes her realise her feelings for Mohan after understanding that she fell in love with him but,she conceals her feeling because she believes that marrying Mohan will ruin his life as this marriage will only become a burden for him and also because of Mohan's mother who hates Megha and her children. After some drama both get married.\n\n===Season 2===\nSeason 2 starts with a 12-year leap when Navika (Nanhi) is all grown up and resigns her job when she is asked to do a program about step families. The story goes back to 2002 when Navika was smaller and narrates the mystery of Addhu, (Adhitya) Megha's son who gets lost in the Indore railway station, as they are unable to find him, it snaps ties between Megha and Mohan as Megha thinks it was all her fault that she married Mohan and they part ways, never to see each other for 12 years. However Navika joins Mohan's newspaper and works there with no other choice and with hate to Mohan. But soon she proved worthy by finishing a political report of an illegal politician, Purrushottam Singh Tilkadhari. His grandson, Beera Singh Tilkadhari, falls in love with Navika and helps her reunite Mohan and Megha. Soon Mohan brings back Addhu who is now mentally thrown off with help of Manoj (Tilkadhari's assistant). But soon Mohan finds out that Addhu is Munna and Munna is Addhu and brings the real Addhu home. But Addhu puts him in jail. After so much encounters Megha and others forgive Addhu but Addhu does not forgive Mohan. Meanwhile, Beera and Navika get married. Mohan takes his family for a picnic where he dies by falling down a high cliff and the story takes a two-year leap and Megha takes Mohan's adopted daughter Rimjhim to Mumbai to find her real mother as wished by Rimjhim. Megha meets a look alike of Mohan, Vaasu and is soon very happy to know that it is her believed to be dead husband Mohan who doesn't remember the past. She fights with Vaasu's mother Aai who killed her step son; the real Vaasu; and Megha and Mohan once again return to Indore and reunite to live happily forever.\n\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*  [[Kunal Karan Kapoor]] as Mohan Bhatnagar /Vasu aka Monu - Megha's husband, Navika,Adithya and Rijhim's adopted father \n*  [[Aakanksha Singh]] as Megha Bhatnagar/Vyas - Mohan's wife, Amar's ex-wife, Navika and Adhithya's mother, Rijhim's adopted mother\n*  Jayashree Venketaramanan as Navika Singh Tilakdari aka Nanhi/Chavanni(n\u00e9e Bhatnagar/Vyas) - Amar and Megha's daughter,Mohan's adopted daughter,Aditya's sister,Rijhim's adopted sister, Beera's wife\n** [[Ashnoor Kaur]] as Young Navika Bhatnagar/Vyas aka Nanhi/Chavanni\n*  [[Kanwar Dhillon]] as Aditya Bhatnagar/Vyas aka Addu/Munna(Fake) - Amar and Megha's son, Mohan's adopted son, Navika's brother,Rijhim's adopted brother\n** [[Vishesh Bansal]]/[[Shivansh Kotia]] as Young Aditya Bhatnagar/ Vyas aka Addu \n*  [[Reem Sheikh]] as Rijhim Bhatnagar - Megha and Mohan's adopted daughter, Navika and Adithya's adopted sister\n*  [[Dushyant Wagh]] as Gurucharan Brijwasi aka Guru - Mohan's brother\n*  Madhuri Sanjeev as Bela Vyas \n*  Rinku Karmarkar as Renu Vyas - Sanjay's wife, Tanmay's mother\n*  Akhlaque Khan as Tanmay Vyas as Tannu - Renu and Sanjay's son,Navika and Adithya's cousin\n** Nirav Soni as Young Tanmay Vyas\n*  [[Siddharth Arora]] as Beera Singh Tilakdari - Navika's husband\n*  [[Manish Gandhi]] as Munna/Adithya Bhatnagar(Fake) - A disabled guy who pretends as Megha's son with help of Adhitya\n*  [[Rohit Bhardwaj]]  as Amar Vedkant Vyas - Megha's ex-husband,Navika and Adithya's father(Dead)\n*  [[Khalid Siddiqui]] as Manav Chaturvedi \n*  [[Anjan Srivastav]] as Vedkant Vyas,Amar's father\n* Madhuri Bhandiwdekar as Saroj Vedkant Vyas,Amar's mother  \n*  [[Neelu Kohli]] as Indu Bhatnagar\n*  Vikram Kapadia  as Arvind Bhatnagar\n* Sachin Parikh as Sanjay Vedkant Vyas\n* [[Navina Bole]] as Koel \n* Ankush Bali as Karan \n* [[Prinal Oberoi]] as Ridhima \n*  Puneet Panjwani as Prateek Agarwal \n* [[Sadiya Siddiqui]]as Prerana Agarwal\n* [[Mehendi Jain]] as Nidhi \n*  [[Shabnam Pandey]] as Dimpy \n*  [[Pooja Kanwal Mahtani]] as Rashmi Bharadwaj\n* Shyaam Sasikumar as Gautam \n*  Shilpa Mehta as Rukmini Bharadwaj\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.colorstv.in/uk/shows/show-details/na-bole-tum-na-maine-kuch-kaha-79/ Official webpage at colors.com]\n\n{{Colors Programmes}}\n\n[[Category:Indian drama television series]]\n[[Category:Colors (TV channel) series]]\n[[Category:2012 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2012 Indian television series endings]]\n[[Category:Indian television soap operas]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Indian English|date=May 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2015}}\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2013}}\n{{Infobox Television\n| show_name            = Na Bole Tum Na Maine Kuch Kaha\n| image                = Na bole tum na maine kuch kaha.jpg \n| caption              = A promotional logo image of ''Na Bole Tum Na Maine Kuch Kaha''.\n| genre                = [[Drama (genre)|Drama]]\n| picture_format       = [[1080i]] ([[HDTV]])\n| starring             = [[Kunal Karan Kapoor]] <br> [[Aakanksha Singh]]\n| creator              =  Sunshine Productions\n| creative_director    = Seema Sharma <br> [[Sudhir Sharma]]\n| writer               =  Venita Coelho <br> Sonal Ganatra <br> Subrat Sinha\n| camera               = [[Multi-camera]]\n| country              = [[India]]\n| location             = [[Indore]] <br> [[Mumbai]]\n| language             = [[Hindi]]\n| channel              = [[Viacom 18|Colors TV]]\n| producer             = [[Sudhir Sharma]]\n| company              = Sunshine Productions\n| num_seasons          = 2\n| num_episodes         = 370\n| first_aired          = {{start date|df=yes|2012|1|9}}\n| last_aired           = {{end date|df=yes|2013|9|12}}\n| runtime              = 20 minutes\n| website              = http://colors.in.com/in/shows/na-bole-tum-na-maine-kuch-kaha-79/\n}}\n\n'''''Na Bole Tum Na Maine Kuch Kaha''''' (English: ''You Didn't Speak Nor Did I Say Anything'') is an Indian soap opera which aired on [[Colors TV]] from 9 January 2012 to 12 September 2013.

From the forest team in Forensic Qin Ming to the Guo team in River God, Li Xian is just right on the tough and handsome role. Each of Li Xian's works has a good response. The characters he plays each time are also very characteristic and individual, and he also sees his unique vision. The \"sculpture-like\" figure, the hormonal breath, also reflects his self-discipline and strict requirements on himself (reviewed by Xinhua News, New Express, and Peninsula Metropolis Daily). Li's eyes can speak, and his eyes can pass on the character's soul. His performance is delicate and layered. He can capture people's hearts by his face value, but he is a \u201cnaughter\u201d with strong acting skills. In the face of different situations, his performance instantly switches like a chameleon. In front of the camera, it is either public or casual or erupts, showing natural aura (Review of The Peninsula Metropolis).\n\n\n===Weibo===\nFollowing the successful of his summer drama ''Go Go Squid!''
