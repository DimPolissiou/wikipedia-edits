Some objects found by the Muslims in a redoubt at Khaybar &mdash; a siege-engine, 20 [[:wikt:bale#Etymology 3|bale]]s of [[Yemen]]ite cloth, and 500 cloaks &mdash; point out to an intense trade carried out by the Jews.<ref name=\"veccia\">Veccia Vaglieri, L. \"Khaybar\".

Each of these regions contained several fortresses or redoubts containing homes, storehouses and stables. Each fortress was occupied by a clan and surrounded by cultivated fields and palm-groves. In order to improve their defensive capabilities, the fortresses were raised up on hills or [[basalt]] rocks.<ref name=\"veccia\"/>\n\n[[Ibn Taimiyya]] wrote in his [[Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah|Minhaj al-Sunnah]] that the prophet peace and blessings upon him appointed [[Amr ibn al-As]] as the governor of the Khaybar [[oasis]]<ref>[[Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah]] by [[Ibn Taimiyya]], volume 4 page 460</ref> \nFollowing the death of the prophet peace and blessings upon him, scholars disagreed as to whether Fadak was exclusively his property.\nSome Muslim commentators agree that following the conquest of Fadak, the property belonged exclusively to the prophet peace and blessings upon him, while several others reject this view.<ref name=\"Taymiyyah\">A Shah Waliullah in [[Quratul Ain]] p228 and [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] in [[Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah|Minhaj al-Sunnah]], Dhikr of Fadak</ref>  Various primary sources describe the acquisition of Fadak in the following way: \n<blockquote>\nHalf the Land of Fadak, which was given by Jews after the peace treaty, was purely the property of Rasool Allah (s).

The claim was rejected by the ruling caliph, Abu Bakr, on the grounds that Fadak was public property and arguing that the prophet peace and blessings upon him had no heirs. Sources report that [[Ali]] together with [[Umm Ayman (Barakah)]] testified to the fact that the prophet peace and blessings upon him granted it to Fatimah Zahra, when Abu Bakr requested Fatima to summon witnesses for her claim.<ref>* Ordoni (1990) p. 211</ref> Various primary sources contend that Fadak was gifted by the prophet peace and blessings upon him to Fatima may Allah pleased with her, drawing on the Qur'an as evidence.<ref>Q Al-Hashr, 7</ref>  These include narrations of [[Ibn 'Abbas]] who argued that when the Qur'anic verse on giving rights to kindred was revealed, the prophet peace and blessings upon him called to his daughter and gifted the land of Fadak to her.<ref>[[Dur al-Manthur]] [http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/fadak/tafseer_dur_almanthur_v4_p177.jpg Vol. 4, page 177] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013047/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/fadak/tafseer_dur_almanthur_v4_p177.jpg |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Shahid Jamal Rizvi|first1=Syed|title=Khutba E Fedak Vol.1|publisher=Qur'an O Itrat Foundation|location=Qum|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/?id=axqXDQAAQBAJ|date=2014-11-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Shahid Jamal Rizvi|first1=Syed|title=Khutba E Fedak Vol.2|publisher=Qur'an O Itrat Foundation|location=Qum|page=143|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tRqXDQAAQBAJ|date=2014-11-10}}</ref>\n\nVarious scholars commenting on the Qur'an, Chapter Al-Hashr, verse 7, write that the [[Angel]] [[Gabriel]] came to the prophet peace and blessings upon him and commanded him to give the appropriate rights to the ''\u201cDhul Qurba\u201d'' (near kin). When asked by the prophet peace and blessings upon him, who the \"Dhul Qurba\" referred to, Gabriel replied \"Fatima\" and that by \"rights\" was meant \"Fadak\", upon which the prophet peace and blessings upon him called Fatima may Allah pleased with her and presented Fadak to her.<ref>*[[Ruzatul Safa]] as quoted in [[Tashdheed-ul-Mathaeen]] page 102.</ref>\n\nBesides the above Quranic verses, there some authenticated references for this issue. For example, [[Burhan al-Din al-Marghinani|Ali Ibn Burhanu'd-din Halabi Shafi'i]] writes in his [[Sirat al-Halbiya|Siratu'l-Halabiyya]], p.&nbsp;39 that at first Fatimah complained to Abu Bakr about the fact that she was given the fadak as a gift by the prophet peace and blessings upon him, as the witnesses were unavailable she was forced to allege her right based on the inheritance law. Also it is mentioned in [[Mu'jam Al-Buldan]] of [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], [[Tafsir al-Kabir (al-Razi)|Tafsir al-Kabir]] of [[Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi|Imam Fakhru'd-din Razi]], [[Al-Sawa'iq al-Muhriqah|Sawa'iq al-Muhriqa]] of [[Ibn Hajar al-Haytami|Ibn Hajar]] p.&nbsp;21, [[Comments on the Peak of Eloquence (Ibn Abi al-Hadid)|Sharh al-Nahju'l-Balagha]] of [[Izz al-Din ibn Hibatullah ibn Abi l-Hadid|Ibn Abi'l-Hadid Mu'tazali]] Vol 4, p.&nbsp;80 that Fatima firstly claimed she was given the fadak as a gift but they rejected her witnesses and she suffered and angrily said that she would not talk to [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]] again.<ref>[http://www.al-islam.org/peshawar-nights-sultan-al-waadhim-sayyid-muhammad-al-musawi-ash-shirazi/eighth-session-thursday#fadak-was-gift-not-legacy Peshawar Nights, Sultan al-Wa\u2019adhim As-Sayyid Muhammad al-Musawi ash-Shirazi]</ref>\n\n[[Lesley Hazleton]] describes the dispute as follows: \u00abHazrat Fatimah may Allah be pleased with her sent a message to Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him asking for her share of her father's estate -date palm orchards in the huge oases of Khaybar and Fadak to the north of Medina. His response left her dumbfounded. the prophet's (peace and blessings upon him) estate belonged to the community, not to any individual, Abu Bakr replied. It was part of the Muslim charitable trust to be administered by him as Caliph. [...] There was no denying the populist appeal of the message Abu Bakr sent by denying Fatima's claim: the House of the prophet peace and blessings upon him was the House of Islam, and all were equal within it.\u00bb<ref>After the Prophet peace and blessings upon him: The Epic Story of the Shia-Sunni Split in Islam By Lesley Hazleton, pp. 71-73</ref>\n\nWhen [[Umar]] became Caliph, the value of the land of Fadak along with its dates was 50,000 dirhams.<ref name=\"Hadeed\"/> Ali again claimed Fatima's inheritance during Umar's era, but was denied with the same argument as in the time of Abu Bakr. Umar however, restored the estates in Medina to [[`Abbas ibn `Abd al-Muttalib]] and Ali, as representatives of the prophet's (peace and blessings upon him) clan, the [[Banu Hashim]]. \nDuring [[Uthman]]'s caliphate, [[Marwan I|Marwan ibn al-Hak\u00e2m]], who was his cousin, was made trustee of the Fadak.<ref>Wafa al Wafa (vol 3 p 1000), Tarikh Abu al-Fida (vol 1 p 168)</ref>\n\n=== Sunni view of Fadak ===\nAccording to Sunnis, Fadak was a piece of land, near Khaiber, where Jews lived. Fadak was conquered by the prophet peace and blessings upon him. The Qur'an says: \u201cAnd that which Allah gave as spoil unto His messenger from them, ye urged not any horse or riding-camel for the sake thereof, but Allah giveth His messenger lordship over whom He will. Allah is Able to do all things. That which Allah giveth as spoil unto His messenger from the people of the townships, it is for Allah and His messenger and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, that it become not a commodity between the rich among you. And whatsoever the messenger giveth you, take it. And whatsoever he forbiddeth, abstain (from it). And keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is stern in reprisal.  -(59: 6-7). Thus according to the Qur\u2019an, Fai means such of properties of the unbelievers as are returned to the Muslims without war. It is not to be distributed like booty among the soldiers, but the whole of it is for Allah and His apostle.

Some objects found by the Muslims in a redoubt at Khaybar &mdash; a siege-engine, 20 [[:wikt:bale#Etymology 3|bale]]s of [[Yemen]]ite cloth, and 500 cloaks &mdash; point out to an intense trade carried out by the Jews.<ref name=\"veccia\">Veccia Vaglieri, L. \"Khaybar\".

Each of these regions contained several fortresses or redoubts containing homes, storehouses and stables. Each fortress was occupied by a clan and surrounded by cultivated fields and palm-groves. In order to improve their defensive capabilities, the fortresses were raised up on hills or [[basalt]] rocks.<ref name=\"veccia\"/>\n\n=== Muhammad\u2019s era (629-632 CE) ===\n{{Main|Conquest of Fidak}}\nMuhammad quietly led the march on Khaybar oasis on 7 May AH/ 629 CE with approximately 1500 men and 100\u2013200 horses. Primary sources including the ''[[Sirah Rasul Allah]]'' (Biography of the Prophet) of Ibn Ishaq describe the conquest of Khaybar, detailing the agreement of Muhammad with the Jews to remain in Fadak and cultivate their land, retaining one-half of the produce of the oasis.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040625103910/http://www.hraic.org/hadith/ibn_ishaq.html#khaybar#khaybar Sirat Rasulullah, Chapter 'Khaybar']</ref> This agreement was distinct from the agreement with the Jews of Khaybar, which essentially entailed the practice of [[sharecropping]]. Muhammad retained the revenues of the Fadak region for the poor as ''\u1e63adaqa'', travelers in need, and for his family. \nIt is not entirely clear how Muhammad managed his possession of Fadak. [[Ibn Taimiyya]] wrote in his [[Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah|Minhaj al-Sunnah]] that Muhammad appointed [[Amr ibn al-As]] as the governor of the Khaybar [[oasis]]<ref>[[Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah]] by [[Ibn Taimiyya]], volume 4 page 460</ref> \nFollowing the death of Muhammad, scholars disagreed as to whether Fadak was exclusively his property.\nSome Muslim commentators agree that following the conquest of Fadak, the property belonged exclusively to Muhammad, while several others reject this view.<ref name=\"Taymiyyah\">A Shah Waliullah in [[Quratul Ain]] p228 and [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] in [[Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah|Minhaj al-Sunnah]], Dhikr of Fadak</ref>  Various primary sources describe the acquisition of Fadak in the following way: \n<blockquote>\nHalf the Land of Fadak, which was given by Jews after the peace treaty, was purely the property of Rasool Allah (s). Similarly, 1/3rd of the Valley of Qari and 2 castles of Khaybar were the exclusive property of Muhammad (s) and no one else had a share of it.<ref>[[Al Minhaj bi Sharh Sahih Muslim]] Volume 2, 92.</ref></blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nThe Apostle of Allah received three things exclusively to himself: Banu an-Nadir, Khaybar and Fadak. The Banu an-Nadir property was kept for his emergent needs, Fadak for travellers, and Khaybar was divided by the Apostle of Allah into three sections: two for Muslims, and one as a contribution for his family. If anything remained after making the contribution of his family, he divided it among the poor Emigrants.<ref>Sunan Abi Dawood [http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/abudawud/019.sat.html#019.2961 Book 19, Number 2961] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206152916/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/abudawud/019.sat.html#019.2961 |date=6 December 2006 }}</ref></blockquote> \nAnother primary account describes eleven fruit trees in Fadak, planted by Muhammad himself.<ref name=\"Hadeed\">[[Sharh Ibn Abi Al-Hadeed]], v4, p108</ref> Other scholars who accept the view of Fadak as belonging exclusively to Muhammad after the conquest of Khaybar include:\n*[[Ali bn Ahmad al-Samhudi]]<ref>[[Wafa al-Wafa]], v4, p1280</ref>\n*[[Ibn Hisham]]<ref>[[Sirah Rasul Allah]] by [[Ibn Hisham]], v3, p353</ref>\n*[[Abu al-Fida]]<ref>[[The Concise History of Humanity or Chronicles]], p140, Dhikr Ghazwa Khaybar</ref>\n\n=== Fatimah (Shia View)===\n{{see also|Sermon of Fadak}}\nUpon the death of Muhmmad, his daughter Fatimah declared her claim to inherit Fadak as the estate of her father. The claim was rejected by the ruling caliph, Abu Bakr, on the grounds that Fadak was public property and arguing that Muhammad had no heirs.

When asked by Muhammad, who the \"Dhul Qurba\" referred to, Gabriel replied \"Fatima\" and that by \"rights\" was meant \"Fadak\", upon which Muhammad called Fatima and presented Fadak to her.<ref>*[[Ruzatul Safa]] as quoted in [[Tashdheed-ul-Mathaeen]] page 102.</ref>\n\nBesides the above Quranic verses, there some authenticated references for this issue. For example, [[Burhan al-Din al-Marghinani|Ali Ibn Burhanu'd-din Halabi Shafi'i]] writes in his [[Sirat al-Halbiya|Siratu'l-Halabiyya]], p.&nbsp;39 that at first Fatimah complained to Abu Bakr about the fact that she was given the fadak as a gift by the prophet of Islam, as the witnesses were unavailable she was forced to allege her right based on the inheritance law. Also it is mentioned in [[Mu'jam Al-Buldan]] of [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], [[Tafsir al-Kabir (al-Razi)|Tafsir al-Kabir]] of [[Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi|Imam Fakhru'd-din Razi]], [[Al-Sawa'iq al-Muhriqah|Sawa'iq al-Muhriqa]] of [[Ibn Hajar al-Haytami|Ibn Hajar]] p.&nbsp;21, [[Comments on the Peak of Eloquence (Ibn Abi al-Hadid)|Sharh al-Nahju'l-Balagha]] of [[Izz al-Din ibn Hibatullah ibn Abi l-Hadid|Ibn Abi'l-Hadid Mu'tazali]] Vol 4, p.&nbsp;80 that Fatima firstly claimed she was given the fadak as a gift but they rejected her witnesses and she suffered and angrily said that she would not talk to [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]] again.<ref>[http://www.al-islam.org/peshawar-nights-sultan-al-waadhim-sayyid-muhammad-al-musawi-ash-shirazi/eighth-session-thursday#fadak-was-gift-not-legacy Peshawar Nights, Sultan al-Wa\u2019adhim As-Sayyid Muhammad al-Musawi ash-Shirazi]</ref>\n\n=== After the death of Muhammad ===\n[[Lesley Hazleton]] describes the dispute between [[Fatimah]] and [[Abu Bakr]] as follows: \u00ab[Fatimah] sent a message to Abu Bakr asking for her share of her father's estate -date palm orchards in the huge oases of Khaybar and Fadak to the north of Medina. His response left her dumbfounded. Muhammad's estate belonged to the community, not to any individual, Abu Bakr replied. It was part of the Muslim charitable trust to be administered by him as Caliph. [...] There was no denying the populist appeal of the message Abu Bakr sent by denying Fatima's claim: the House of Muhammad was the House of Islam, and all were equal within it.\u00bb<ref>After the Prophet: The Epic Story of the Shia-Sunni Split in Islam By Lesley Hazleton, pp. 71-73</ref>\n\nWhen [[Umar]] became Caliph, the value of the land of Fadak along with its dates was 50,000 dirhams.<ref name=\"Hadeed\"/> Ali again claimed Fatima's inheritance during Umar's era, but was denied with the same argument as in the time of Abu Bakr. Umar however, restored the estates in Medina to [[`Abbas ibn `Abd al-Muttalib]] and Ali, as representatives of Muhammad's clan, the [[Banu Hashim]]. \nDuring [[Uthman]]'s caliphate, [[Marwan I|Marwan ibn al-Hak\u00e2m]], who was his cousin, was made trustee of the Fadak.<ref>Wafa al Wafa (vol 3 p 1000), Tarikh Abu al-Fida (vol 1 p 168)</ref>\n\n=== Sunni view of Fadak ===\nAccording to Sunnis, Fadak was a piece of land, near Khaiber, where Jews lived. Fadak was conquered by Muhammad. The Qur'an says: \u201cAnd that which Allah gave as spoil unto His messenger from them, ye urged not any horse or riding-camel for the sake thereof, but Allah giveth His messenger lordship over whom He will. Allah is Able to do all things. That which Allah giveth as spoil unto His messenger from the people of the townships, it is for Allah and His messenger and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, that it become not a commodity between the rich among you. And whatsoever the messenger giveth you, take it. And whatsoever he forbiddeth, abstain (from it). And keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is stern in reprisal.  -(59: 6-7). Thus according to the Qur\u2019an, Fai means such of properties of the unbelievers as are returned to the Muslims without war. It is not to be distributed like booty among the soldiers, but the whole of it is for Allah and His apostle. From the Sunnah and Practice of the Prophet of Islam it is evident that Muhammad himself used to manage Fai as the head of the Islamic republic.<ref>http://www.muslimtents.com/shaufi/b16/b16_13.htm</ref>\n\nAccording to Sunnis, Muhammad didn't gift Fadak to his daughter.

Names are reported under the date of death, in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence:\n\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent [[nationality]] (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n\n<!--\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence: Name, age, country of citizenship at birth or nationality if the subject is not eligible (for example, in the case of animals), subsequent nationality (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference. Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n--->\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==April==\n===13===\n\n===12===\n*[[Chung Won-shik]], 91, South Korean politician, [[Prime Minister of South Korea|Prime Minister]] (1991\u20131992), kidney disease.<ref>[https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php%3fud=20200412000220 Ex-Prime Minister Chung passes way at 91]</ref>\n*[[Abdul Majed]], Bangladeshi military officer and convicted murderer, execution by hanging.<ref>[https://www.theweek.in/news/world/2020/04/12/who-is-abdul-majed-executed-for-murdering-bangladesh-founding-father-mujibur-rahman.html Abdul Majed, who murdered Bangladesh founding father and 'hid' in Kolkata, execute]</ref>\n*[[Sir Stirling Moss]], 90, British [[International Motorsports Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] [[Formula One]] driver.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.breaking-news-f1-legend-sir-stirling-moss-dies-age-90.4DnxFpiKWbe2B2ViqYIL5y.html|title=F1 legend Sir Stirling Moss dies, age 90|last=|first=|date=2020-04-12|website=Formula1.com|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\n===11===\n*[[Colby Cave]], 25, Canadian ice hockey player ([[Boston Bruins]], [[Edmonton Oilers]]), complications from intracerebral hemorrhage.<ref>[https://www.nhl.com/oilers/news/rip-colby-cave/c-316592402 RIP, Colby Cave]</ref>\n*[[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Chatelain]], 84, Belgian-born French actress  (''[[La Jet\u00e9e]]''), documentary film director and writer.<ref>[http://www.bel7infos.eu/helene-chatelain-nous-a-quittes-rip/ H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Ch\u00e2telain nous a quitt\u00e9s RIP] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n*[[Stanley Chera]], 77\u201378, American real estate executive, COVID-19.<ref>[https://therealdeal.com/2020/04/11/stanley-chera-titan-of-nyc-retail-dies-of-covid-19/ Stanley Chera, titan of NYC retail, dies of coronavirus]</ref>\n*[[John Horton Conway]], 82, British mathematician ([[Conway's Game of Life]], [[Surreal numbers]]), COVID-19.<ref>[http://maddmaths.simai.eu/news-2/conway-morto/ Il matematico John Horton Conway \u00e8 morto di Covid-19 all'et\u00e0 di 82 anni] {{in lang|it}}</ref>\n*[[Mariano De Nicol\u00f2]], 88, Italian Roman Catholic prelate, Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro|San Marino-Montefeltro]] (1989\u20131995) and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rimini|Rimini]] (1989\u20132007).<ref>[http://www.riminitoday.it/cronaca/morto-vescovo-mariano-de-nicolo.html Si \u00e8 spento dopo una lunga malattia il Vescovo emerito Mariano De Nicol\u00f2] {{in lang|it}}</ref>\n*[[Kristin Jacobs]], 60, American politician, mayor of [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]] (2012\u20132013) and member of the [[Florida House of Representatives]] (since 2014), colon cancer.<ref>[https://www.wjhg.com/wecp/content/news/Florida-Representative-Kristin-Jacobs-passes-away-from-cancer-569566231.html Florida Representative Kristin Jacobs passes away from cancer]</ref>\n*[[Edem Kodjo]], 81, Togolese politician, [[List of prime ministers of Togo|Prime Minister]] (1994\u20131996, 2005\u20132006) and [[Chairperson of the African Union Commission]] (1978\u20131983).<ref>[https://www.africanews.com/2020/04/12/edem-kodjo-togo-mourns-ex-prime-minister-africa-remembers-ex-oau-chief/ Edem Kodjo: Togo mourns ex-Prime Minister, Africa remembers ex-OAU chief]</ref>\n*[[Periklis Korovesis]], 78, Greek journalist and politician, [[Hellenic Parliament|MP]] (2007\u20132009).<ref>[https://www.efsyn.gr/tehnes/media/238830_antio-ston-diko-mas-perikli \u00ab\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bf\u00bb \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03ae] {{in lang|el}}</ref>\n*[[Phil Langley]], 83, American harness racing official, president of the [[United States Trotting Association]] (2003\u20132016).<ref>[https://www.drf.com/news/harness-phil-langley-former-usta-president-dies-83 Harness: Phil Langley, former USTA President, dies at 83]</ref>\n*[[Liu Dehai]], 82, Chinese [[pipa]] player.<ref>[http://www.bjd.com.cn/a/202004/11/WS5e918e47e4b0df866aa94f84.html \u7435\u7436\u5927\u5e08\u5218\u5fb7\u6d77\u75c5\u901d\uff0c\u7ec8\u5e7482\u5c81] {{in lang|zh}}</ref>\n*[[Might and Power]], 26, Australian racehorse, [[Melbourne Cup]] (1997), [[Caulfield Cup]] (1997) and [[W.S.

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death.

Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking.
