She assisted her father in his research projects at the Deception Bay residence. Mackerras attended the [[Brisbane Girls Grammar School]] and was awarded prizes in [[mathematics]]. She enrolled in the [[University of Queensland]] and graduated in 1918 with [[B.Sc.]], and in 1930 with [[M.Sc.]].  From 1918 to 1920, she held the [[Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research|Walter and Eliza Hall]] fellowship in [[Biological economics|enomic biology]]. [[Thomas Harvey Johnston]] was her honours academic advisor and she collaborated with [[Thomas Harvey Johnston|Johnston]] in research that led to several important joint publications. In 1924, she completed the [[Bachelor of Medicine|M.B.]] at the [[University of Sydney]]. During her time at the University of Sydney, she met [[Ian Murray Mackerras]], her future husband. The young couple enjoyed [[sailing]] and [[fishing]] during the weekend breaks, and would not feast on the catch until thorough laboratory analysis of the fish blood for [[haematozoa]].<ref name=Lemon>Lemon, Barbara.

She then opened a small private practice and still found time for a part-time appointment at the [[Rachel Forster Hospital|Rachel Forster Hospital for Women and Children]]. In 1926, when her son was born, she placed her professional career on hold. In 1930, Mackerras joined the unit led by her husband, as assistant [[entomologist]] at the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]]'s division of [[economic entomology]] in Canberra . Her research on [[Calliphoridae|blowfly]] [[infestation]] and [[Bovine ephemeral fever|ephemeral fever]] led to several individual and joint publications with husband Ian Mackerras and [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet]].<ref>Mackerras, M.

To seek a solution to this burgeoning problem affecting the troops, Mackerras, [[Hugh Ward (bacteriologist)|Hugh Ward]] and Bill Keogh proposed an organization that would focus on the scientific investigation of the disease. In 1943, the Land Headquarters Medical Research Unit was established under (Sir) [[Neil Hamilton Fairley]] at [[Cairns, Queensland]]. From 1943, Mackerras was attached to the Medical Research Unit as [[entomologist]] and promoted to [[major]] in March 1944. \nShe actively maintained a colony of infected [[mosquitoes]] that were utilized on volunteers for medical testing. Her work proved beneficial to reduce the [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of [[infection]] in the [[armed forces]], and delivered a scientific basis for studying the effects of pharmaceutical drugs on the malarial parasite. In March 1946, the Medical Research Unit was disbanded and she collaborated with colleagues to publish several important papers on the work with malaria.<ref>Mackerras, M. J., & Ercole, Q. N. (1947).

She assisted her father in his research projects at the Deception Bay residence. Mackerras attended the [[Brisbane Girls Grammar School]] and was awarded prizes in [[mathematics]]. She enrolled in the [[University of Queensland]] and graduated in 1918 with [[B.Sc.]], and in 1930 with [[M.Sc.]].  From 1918 to 1920, she held the [[Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research|Walter and Eliza Hall]] fellowship in [[Biological economics|enomic biology]]. [[Thomas Harvey Johnston]] was her honours academic advisor and she collaborated with [[Thomas Harvey Johnston|Johnston]] in research that led to several important joint publications. In 1924, she completed the [[Bachelor of Medicine|M.B.]] at the [[University of Sydney]]. During her time at the University of Sydney, she met [[Ian Murray Mackerras]], her future husband.

She then opened a small private practice and still found time for a part-time appointment at the [[Rachel Forster Hospital|Rachel Forster Hospital for Women and Children]]. In 1926, when her son was born, she placed her professional career on hold. In 1930, Mackerras joined the unit led by her husband, as assistant [[entomologist]] at the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]]'s division of [[economic entomology]] in Canberra . Her research on [[Calliphoridae|blowfly]] [[infestation]] and [[Bovine ephemeral fever|ephemeral fever]] led to several individual and joint publications with husband Ian Mackerras and [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet]].<ref>Mackerras, M.

To seek a solution to this burgeoning problem affecting the troops, Mackerras, [[Hugh Ward (bacteriologist)|Hugh Ward]] and Bill Keogh proposed an organization that would focus on the scientific investigation of the disease. In 1943, the Land Headquarters Medical Research Unit was established under (Sir) [[Neil Hamilton Fairley]] at [[Cairns, Queensland]]. From 1943, Mackerras was attached to the Medical Research Unit as [[entomologist]] and promoted to [[major]] in March 1944. \nShe actively maintained a colony of infected [[mosquitoes]] that were utilized on volunteers for medical testing. Her work proved beneficial to reduce the [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of [[infection]] in the [[armed forces]], and delivered a scientific basis for studying the effects of pharmaceutical drugs on the malarial parasite. In March 1946, the Medical Research Unit was disbanded and she collaborated with colleagues to publish several important papers on the work with malaria.<ref>Mackerras, M. J., & Ercole, Q. N. (1947).
