As such, he was also deployed as a second striker or as a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central]] [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] on occasion. He was also an accurate [[Free kick (association football)|free kick]] taker. Furthermore, his stature, combined with his long hair and beard, made him a highly recognisable figure on the pitch.{{#tag:ref|See<ref name=\"CdS\">{{cite news |url=https://www.corriere.it/sport/20_aprile_05/casagrande-dall-ascoli-droga-libri-cosi-ho-battuto-l-inferno-4ef90f68-7732-11ea-9a9a-6cb2a51f0129.shtml |title=Casagrande, dall\u2019Ascoli alla droga e ai libri: \u00abCos\u00ec ho battuto l\u2019inferno\u00bb |work=Il Corriere della Sera |language=Italian |date=5 April 2020 |accessdate=6 April 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"repubblica1\">{{cite news |url=https://www.repubblica.it/sport/calcio/serie-a/torino/2017/04/27/news/casagrande_alcol_droga-163999465/ |title=Walter Casagrande: ''Cos\u00ec ho sconfitto i miei demoni'' |work=La Repubblica |language=Italian |last1=Gamba |first1=Emanuele |date=27 April 2017 |accessdate=6 April 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"calciomercato\">{{cite web |url=https://www.calciomercato.com/news/casagrande-l-ascoli-nel-cuore-la-scommessa-con-rozzi-la-doppiett-69246 |title=Casagrande: l'Ascoli nel cuore, la scommessa con Rozzi, la doppietta alla Juve e la droga... |publisher=www.calciomercato.com |language=Italian |last1=Gandolfi |first1=Remo |date=4 November 2019 |accessdate=6 April 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"ilfattoquotidiano1\">{{cite news |url=https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2020/04/03/ti-ricordi-quando-il-toro-di-mondonico-batte-la-juve-nel-derby-davanti-a-kissinger/5759029/ |title=Ti ricordi\u2026 Quando il Toro di Mondonico batt\u00e9 la Juve nel derby davanti a Kissinger |work=Il Fatto Quotidiano |language=Italian |last1=Vella |first1=Cristiano |date=3 April 2020 |accessdate=6 April 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"CdSp\">{{cite news |url=https://www.pressreader.com/italy/corriere-dello-sport/20140629/281724087642058 |title=Casagrande c'\u00e8 vita oltre i demoni |work=Il Corriere dello Sport |page=11 |language=Italian |date=29 June 2014 |accessdate=6 April 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"toro.it\">{{cite web |url=https://www.toro.it/rubriche/pillole-storia/15-aprile-1963-nasce-walter-casagrande/208932/ |title=15 aprile 1963: nasce Walter Casagrande |publisher=Toro.it |language=Italian |last1=Milano |first1=Fabio |date=15 April 2018 |accessdate=6 April 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"toronews2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.toronews.net/mondo-granata/walter-casagrande-e-le-doppiette-storiche-contro-juve-e-ajax/ |title=Walter Casagrande, le doppiette storiche contro Juventus e Ajax |publisher=Toro News |language=Italian |last1=De Rito |first1=Marco |date=15 April 2018 |accessdate=6 April 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"toronews3\">{{cite web |url=https://www.toronews.net/toro/fame-di-gol/ |title=Fame di gol |publisher=Toro News |language=Italian |last1=Ferrero |first1=Michele |date=26 June 2007 |accessdate=9 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://resources.fifa.com/image/upload/mexico-1986-part-500906.pdf?cloudid=vkami8gmuo9mpkbuzfhs |title=Mexico 1986 |publisher=FIFA.com |accessdate=9 April 2020 }}</ref>|name=\"playing-style\"|group=\"nb\"}}\n\n==Later life==\nFollowing his retirement from professional football, Casagrande worked as an analyst.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/paris-saint-germain/story/3385178/neymar-sr-hits-back-at-after-spoiled-and-a-monster?src=com |title=Casagrande calls 'spoiled' Neymar 'a monster,' Neymar Sr. hits back |publisher=ESPN FC |date=15 February 2018 |accessdate=6 April 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 2007, Casagrande was involved in a weekend traffic accident, and was briefly in a coma after his car rolled and hit parked cars.

The film was later dubbed into Hindi as ''Ekkadiki'' by Goldmines Telefilms in 2017. This film is being remade in Tamil as ''[[Aayiram Jenmangal (2019 film)|Aayiram Jenmangal]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nArjun ([[Nikhil Siddharth]]) after finishing his exam waits at marriage registrar office for his girlfriend Ayesha to arrive and marry her, but Ayesha doesn't show up, leaving Arjun heart broken. Few years later a cousin of Arjun's friend, named Kishore ([[Vennela Kishore]]) gets mentally disturbed who feels possession of some spirit in his body. For treatment Arjun takes Kishore to [[Kerala]]. While Kishore is  being treated, Arjun is attracted to a girl named Amala ([[Hebah Patel]]),  who reminded him about Ayesha in terms of attitude. After finishing Kishore's treatment, Arjun is once again left heartbroken as Amala leaves the place without even informing him. Arjun goes after Amala to her village, Vijayawada, and gets shocked by knowing that Amala met with an accident four years back and the girl whom he met in Kerala is not Amala. Back in Hyderabad, Arjun meets the girl who posed to be Amala and finds that her actual name is Nithya and gets to know that in the past Nithya was possessed by a spirit whose name was Amala and for treatment Nithya went to Kerala. Gradually, Nithya and Arjun grow closer. But at that time Amala's spirit enters another girl's body whose name is Parvati ([[Nandita Swetha]]) and comes to Arjun's house. Arjun, although tensed, maintains a normal behaviour with Amala. Gradually Arjun's close behavior with Nithya makes Amala (Parvati) furious and emotional as she becomes possessive about Arjun. At that point, Amala reveals the truth that she is none other than Ayesha ([[Avika Gor]]) (actual name is Amala but Arjun thought as Ayesha)- the same girl to whom Arjun was supposed to get married, but unfortunately on the day of marriage, she meets with an accident and dies on the spot. She says that she saved the girl named Parvathi when she was attempting a suicide because she was supposed to marry her uncle whom she doesn't like. After hearing all this Arjun feels guilty and sad that he couldn't identify her and he tries to stop her but Amala does not pay heed to any of his pleas. Amala feels that Arjun no longer loves her and leaves Parvathi's body. After gaining consciousness, Parvathi is unable to recognize Arjun and at this point of time Parvathi's uncle ([[Raja Ravindra]]) comes there and beats up Arjun. When he is about to kill Arjun, Amala once again enters Parvathi's body and saves Arjun.

This film is being remade in Tamil as ''[[Aayiram Jenmangal (2019 film)|Aayiram Jenmangal]]''.\n==Plot==\nArjun ([[Nikhil Siddharth]]) after finishing his exam waits at marriage registrar office for his girlfriend Ayesha to arrive and marry her, but Ayesha doesn't show up, leaving Arjun heart broken. Few years later a cousin of Arjun's friend,  named Kishore ([[Vennela Kishore]]) gets mentally disturbed who feels possession of some spirit in his body. For treatment Arjun takes Kishore to [[Kerala]]. While Kishore is  being treated, Arjun is attracted to a girl named Amala ([[Hebah Patel]]),  who reminded him about Ayesha in terms of attitude. After finishing Kishore's treatment, Arjun is once again left heartbroken as Amala leaves the place without even informing him. Arjun goes after Amala to her village, Vijayawada, and gets shocked by knowing that Amala met with an accident four years back and the girl whom he met in Kerala is not Amala. Back in Hyderabad, Arjun meets the girl who posed to be Amala and finds that her actual name is Nithya and gets to know that in the past Nithya was possessed by a spirit whose name was Amala and for treatment Nithya went to Kerala. Gradually, Nithya and Arjun grow closer. But at that time Amala's spirit enters another girl's body whose name is Parvati ([[Nandita Swetha]]) and comes to Arjun's house. Arjun, although tensed, maintains a normal behaviour with Amala. Gradually Arjun's close behavior with Nithya makes Amala (Parvati) furious and emotional as she becomes possessive about Arjun. At that point, Amala reveals the truth that she is none other than Ayesha ([[Avika Gor]]) (actual name is Amala but Arjun thought as Ayesha)- the same girl to whom Arjun was supposed to get married, but unfortunately on the day of marriage, she meets with an accident and dies on the spot. She says that she saved the girl named Parvathi when she was attempting a suicide because she was supposed to get married to her uncle whom she doesn't like. After hearing all this Arjun feels guilty and sad that he couldn't identify her and he tries to stop her but Amala does not pay heed to any of his pleas. Amala feels that Arjun no longer loves her and leaves Parvathi's body. After gaining consciousness, Parvathi is unable to recognize Arjun and at this point of time Parvathi's uncle ([[Raja Ravindra]]) comes there and beats up Arjun. When he is about to kill Arjun, Amala once again enters Parvathi's body and saves Arjun. While in the hospital, Amala gets to know from Nithya that Arjun is still in love with her and that's why he said no to Nithya's love proposal, but at this time Kishore with the help of Swamiji, who cured him in Kerala makes Amala's soul leave Parvathi body and captures it.Swami consoles Arjun that it's against God's will for a soul to live on earth after death.A few months later Arjun meets Nithya on road and he finds that some of her behaviour resembles that of Amala(it is shown in the credits that's the bottle in which Amala was captured is now broken implying that it was in fact Amala in Nithya's body again) and ends up proposing her for marriage and Parvati returns home but her uncle says to marry the guy of her choice and runs away because of her behaviour in Arjun's house.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Nikhil Siddharth]] as Arjun  \n*[[Hebah Patel]] as  Nithya / Amala (Voice dubbed by Lipsika)\n*[[Nandita Swetha]] as  Parvathi /Amala (Voice dubbed by Kranthi)\n*[[Avika Gor]] as Amala/Ayesha (Kamala in hindi version) (Voice dubbed by Mahathi)\n*[[Vennela Kishore]] as Kishore\n*[[Annapoorna (actress)|Annapoorna]] as Nithya's grandmother\n*[[Sathya (Telugu actor)|Sathya]] as Satya, Arjun's friend \n*Sudharshan as Arjun's friend \n*Josh Ravi as Arjun's friend\n*[[Viva Harsha]] as Arjun's friend \n*[[Tanikella Bharani]] as Amala's father\n*[[Raja Ravindra]] as Parvathi's uncle\n*[[Pruthviraj Balireddy|Prudhviraj]] as Dr. Akash\n*[[Praveen (actor)|Praveen]] as Ghanta Ram\n*[[Fish Venkat]]\n*Swamiji (Voice dubbed by [[R.C.M.

Bhagwata comes to the stage. He is a character in the Play and also is the narrator of the play. He seeks blessings from Lord Ganesha for the successful performance of the play. Through his narration, he takes the audience to a place, called as Dharampur and introduces the audience to the king Dharmsheel. Then he puts up some rhetorical questions on incompleteness of man and God; and also on the perfection of a man. During his narration, he introduces two characters who are mutual friends. The first one is Devdutta. He is a sharp minded and highly intellectual person. He has defeated poets and Pandits with his knowledge. He is a son of [[Brahmin]]. The second one is Kapila. He is a muscular man. He has a great physical strength and he is a son of Lohar ([[Blacksmith|Black Smith]]). Both Dev Datt and Kapila are in contrast as the former lacks power and strength, the latter lacks knowledge and intellectual. According to the playwright, the head of Devdutta (knowledge) and the body of Kapila (physical strength) accomplish a complete man. The narrator compares their pair to the pair of Ram-Laxman, Luv-Kush and Krishna-Balram. All these are the pairs of great brothers in Hindu mythology.\n\nA character, Actor-1 appears on the stage shouting and running towards Bhagwata. He tells Bhagwata that he has just seen a strange creature that looks like a horse (by face) but speaks like a man. That creature has the head of a horse and the rest of the body of a man. Without paying any heed to his talks, Bhagwata asks him to get ready for the play. But he runs away from the stage and soon after he comes back shouting again. Now a strange creature appears on the stage. As earlier described by the Actor-1, the creature has the head of a horse and the body of a man. For a moment, Bhagwata thinks that someone is wearing the mask of horse. He tries to remove the mask but realizes that it is truly half a man and a half horse. Now the creature starts to introduce itself before Bhagwata, Actor-1 and the audience.\n\nThe creature introduces himself as Hayavadana and starts to narrate his story. He tells that once upon a time, a princess had to choose a groom for her marriage. So many Princes approached from far and wide. But the princess fell in love with a horse of an Arabian Prince. She became desperate to marry that horse. Eventually her parents allowed her to do so. She was married to the horse. After 15 years of  their marriage, the horse transformed into a celestial being. Now the princess rejected him as her husband. That celestial being cursed her to be a Mare (female horse) and she became so. The princess give birth to Hayavadana. Now Hayavadana wants to get rid of this cursed life. Bhagwata asks him to go to goddess Kali temple in chitrkut. He also asks the Actor-1 to accompany him on the way. They leave. \n\nNow Bhagwata moves ahead with the story of the play. Devdutta and Kapila appear on the stage. Devdutta tells Kapil that he wants to marry a woman, namely Padmini. With utmost desire to marry Padmini, he pledges to sacrifice his head to Goddess Kali and his arms to Rudra. Kapila goes to Padmini and presents the Proposal to marry Devdutta. Devdatta and Padmini Marry. By the time, Devdutta realizes that Padmini is attracted towards Kapila and vice-versa. Now Padmini is pregnant. Devdutta knowingly tries to put off the program of visiting Ujjain. He tells Kapila that Padmini is ill. But Padmini gives her consent before Kapila. They all three e leave for Ujjain. Padmini repeatedly praises Kapila's physical strength before Devdutta. Devdutta feels jealous but he does not blame Padmini. Kapila and Padmini go to Rudra Temple but Devdutta denies to accompany them. Devdutta knows that Kapila has such a physical strength and beauty that any woman can get attracted towards him. Devdutta goes to goddess Kali temple where he reminds himself of his pledge to sacrifice his head to the Goddess Kali. He Wishes for the Wellness of Kapila and Padmini. He beheads himself with a sword and dies. \n\nMeanwhile, Kapila and Padmini come out of the temple. Kapila gets worried on finding Devdutta nowhere. He leaves Padmini and starts searching for his friend. Finally he reaches in the same Temple and feels shocked to see his friend dead. He feels himself responsible for all this. Kapila takes the same sword and beheads himself. Soon Padmini reaches there and she has no clue how they got died. She considers herself responsible for the dual between the two friends and their deaths. She provokes the Goddess Kali and also tries to kill herself. The Goddess Kali appears and stops her. The Goddess asks her to place the heads with their respective body so that the Goddess will re-join them with her magical powers and bring them back to life. The Goddess also appreciates the two friends. Padmini follows the command in a hurry. The Goddess disappears. Padmini, being thankful to goddess kali, gets a bit relaxed. But soon she realizes her mistake. She has mistakenly placed the heads with irrespective body. So now Devdutta's head is joined with Kapila's body and vice-versa. Soon they regain their senses. For a moment, the two friends are confused. Both make a claim for Padmini. The man with Devdutta's head, makes a plea that head is the master of the body. So he has the right over Padmini. The man with Kapila's head makes a plea that Padmini has remained with Devdutta's body. So he has the right over Padmini. Meanwhile Bhagwata, the narrator, comes on the stage. All all the characters become statues for a moment and the narrator addresses the audience. He asks them to think of a solution to this problem. Act 1 ends.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hayavadana/act-1|title=LitCharts|website=LitCharts|language=en|access-date=2020-01-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200113150030/https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hayavadana/act-1|archive-date=2020-01-13|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Act - II ===\nThe act begins as the narrator repeats the same question- \" What is the solution? \". He also talks about the story of ''\u2032[[Vikramaditya]] and [[Vetala|Betaal]]\u2032'' <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32198806-vikram-and-betaal |title=Vikram And Betaal |website=www.goodreads.com |publisher=[[Amazon]] [[Goodreads]] |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> where the king Vikrama replies to Betaal that the mind (head) is the master of the body. It is head that gives recognition to an individual. Bhagwata tells that they all three go to a hermit seeking solution for this problem. The words of hermit are heard on the stage that Devdutta's head is the Swami (husband) of Padmini. Devdutta and Padmini accept this in delight. Kapila, being disappointed, leaves for the forest. The time passes. Devdutta brings some dolls. These dolls also play the role of narrator. He starts losing his physical strength and as a result they are losing mutual interest. A child is born. Devduta goes to buy new dolls from the fair in Ujjain. Bhagwata again appears on the stage and tells that Kapila has regained his physical strength. Padmini meets him in the forest and also tell him that it is Kapila's son as it is born from Kapila's body. But Kapila does not accept it. Being a little reluctant, they get ready to fulfill their physical desires.  \n\nIn search of his wife, Devdutta reaches there in the forest. Finding them together, he finds himself the similar situation as he was before. To put an Ultimate end to this problem, Devdutta takes out the sword and challenges Kapila for a dual. Both gets killed. Padmini finds herself lonely. Bhagwata comes there and she hands him over the child and the same dolls. She asks him to hand it over to Devdutta's Brahmin father Vidyasagar after five years. She leaves the stage by declaring that she is going to perform Sati. Bhagwata decides to end the play with his speech. A loud shout is heard on the stage. Actor-1 comes and claims that he has heard Hayavadana chanting National Anthem and patriotic songs. Then Actor-2 appears with Devdutta's son of age 5 now. The boy has two dolls. Hayavadana comes there. Bhagwata and Actor-2 are talking lightly and creating fun. They all starts laughing. That boy too starts laughing and the dolls slip out of his hand. Bhagwata says that the boy hasn't expressed any emotions of happiness, anger, sorrow in past 5 years. Today he is smiling just because of Hayavadana.  \n\nNow Hayavadana tells his story. when he was trying to behead himself in the temple, the goddess Kali appeared. Hayavadana tells his desire. The goddess Kali without listening to him fully, gives him blessings. Hayavadana becomes a complete Horse instead of becoming a complete man. Yet he is satisfied. He still has ability to speak like a man. He wants to lose this voice. He is singing national Anthem as he believes that people who sing national anthem, lose their voice early. Meanwhile he sobs. The boy starts sings a tragic song which was chanted by his mother, Padmini. Hayavadana tries to laugh and his voice completely changes into a horse'. Now Hayavadana is a complete horse. \n\nBhagwata asks the Actor to go Brahmin Vidyasagar and informs him that his grandson is coming to him riding on a great horse. Bhagwata  thanks Lord Ganesha for the successful performance of the play.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hayavadana/act-2|title=LitCharts|website=LitCharts|language=en|access-date=2020-01-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200113150018/https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hayavadana/act-2|archive-date=2020-01-13|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Indian plays]]\n[[Category:1971 plays]]\n[[Category:Kannada literature]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Girish Karnad Screening Cornell.JPG|thumb|Author Girish Karnad (1938-2019)]]\n'''Hayavadana'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095925443|title=Hayavadana - Oxford Reference|website=www.oxfordreference.com|language=en|doi=10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095925443|access-date=2020-01-14|doi-broken-date=2020-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114032732/https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095925443|archive-date=2020-01-14|url-status=live}}</ref> (''meaning: Horse face'') is a 1971 Indian [[Kannada language]] two-[[Act (drama)|act]] [[Play (theatre)|play]] written by [[Girish Karnad]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/an-ode-to-history-girish-karnad-play-theatre-5867716/ |title=Eight young theatre directors join forces to direct Girish Karnad\u2019s acclaimed play, Hayavadana |date=2019-08-01 |website=The Indian Express |publisher=[[The Indian Express]] |location=India |publication-place=India |access-date=2020-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027050235/https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/an-ode-to-history-girish-karnad-play-theatre-5867716/ |archive-date=2019-10-27 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.goodreads.com/work/best_book/3369790-hayavadana |title=Hayavadana |website=www.goodreads.com |publisher=[[Amazon]] [[Goodreads]] |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> The plot is based on [[Kathasaritsagara]] and [[Thomas Mann]]'s retelling of [[The Transposed Heads|Transposed Heads]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dramadose.com/review-hayavadana/|title=Review: Hayavadana|date=2012-12-11|website=DramaDose|language=en|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref> It's twin play is ''Nagamandala'' (1988).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mumbaitheatreguide.com/dramas/english/02-hayavadana-english-play-preview.asp#|title=HAYAVADANA English Play/Drama - www.MumbaiTheatreGuide.com|website=www.mumbaitheatreguide.com|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> Hayavadana presents the story of two friends ''Devdutta'' and ''Kaplia''; and their love interest ''Padmini''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/events/patna/girish-karnads-hayavadana-enthralls-all-in-patna/articleshow/63609107.cms|title=Hayavadana: Girish Karnad's Hayavadana enthralls all in Patna {{!}} Patna News - Times of India|last=Apr 4|first=Saurav Singh {{!}}|last2=2018|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=2020-01-14|last3=Ist|first3=12:55|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406045417/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/events/patna/girish-karnads-hayavadana-enthralls-all-in-patna/articleshow/63609107.cms|archive-date=2018-04-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Characters  ==\n*Bhagwata - the main narrator of the play\n*Devdutta - One of the two friends, A man of knowledge\n*Kapila - Devdutta's Friend, A man with great physical strength\n*Padmini - A beautiful woman, love interest of the two friends\n*Hayavadana - A strange creature with the Head of a Horse and body of a man\n*Actor-1 - An assistant to Bhagwata\n*[[Goddess Kali]] - the Goddess who brings Devdutta and Kapila back to life.  \n*The Boy - Son of Devdutta and Padmini\n*Vidyasagar (only referenced) - Devdutta's father\n\n== Plot ==\n\n=== Act - I ===\nThe play opens with worship to [[Ganesha|Lord Ganesha]].

The Goddess asks her to place the heads with their respective body so that the Goddess will re-join them with her magical powers and bring them back to life. The Goddess also appreciates the two friends. Padmini follows the command in a hurry. The Goddess disappears. Padmini, being thankful to goddess kali, gets a bit relaxed. But soon she realizes her mistake. She has mistakenly placed the heads with irrespective body. So now Devdutta's head is joined with Kapila's body and vice-versa. Soon they regain their senses. For a moment, the two friends are confused. Both make a claim for Padmini. The man with Devdutta's head, makes a plea that head is the master of the body. So he has the right over Padmini. The man with Kapila's head makes a plea that Padmini has remained with Devdutta's body. So he has the right over Padmini. Meanwhile Bhagwata, the narrator, comes on the stage. All all the characters become statues for a moment and the narrator addresses the audience. He asks them to think of a solution to this problem. Act 1 ends.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hayavadana/act-1|title=LitCharts|website=LitCharts|language=en|access-date=2020-01-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200113150030/https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hayavadana/act-1|archive-date=2020-01-13|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Act - II ===\nThe act begins as the narrator repeats the same question- \" What is the solution? \". He also talks about the story of ''\u2032[[Vikramaditya]] and [[Vetala|Betaal]]\u2032'' <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32198806-vikram-and-betaal |title=Vikram And Betaal |website=www.goodreads.com |publisher=[[Amazon]] [[Goodreads]] |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> where the king Vikrama replies to Betaal that the mind (head) is the master of the body. It is head that gives recognition to an individual. Bhagwata tells that they all three go to a hermit seeking solution for this problem. The words of hermit are heard on the stage that Devdutta's head is the Swami (husband) of Padmini. Devdutta and Padmini accept this in delight. Kapila, being disappointed, leaves for the forest. The time passes. Devdutta brings some dolls. These dolls also play the role of narrator. He starts losing his physical strength and as a result they are losing mutual interest. A child is born. Devduta goes to buy new dolls from the fair in Ujjain. Bhagwata again appears on the stage and tells that Kapila has regained his physical strength. Padmini meets him in the forest and also tell him that it is Kapila's son as it is born from Kapila's body. But Kapila does not accept it. Being a little reluctant, they get ready to fulfill their physical desires.  \n\nIn search of his wife, Devdutta reaches there in the forest. Finding them together, he finds himself the similar situation as he was before. To put an Ultimate end to this problem, Devdutta takes out the sword and challenges Kapila for a dual. Both gets killed. Padmini finds herself lonely. Bhagwata comes there and she hands him over the child and the same dolls. She asks him to hand it over to Devdutta's Brahmin father Vidyasagar after five years. She leaves the stage by declaring that she is going to perform Sati. Bhagwata decides to end the play with his speech. A loud shout is heard on the stage. Actor-1 comes and claims that he has heard Hayavadana chanting National Anthem and patriotic songs. Then Actor-2 appears with Devdutta's son of age 5 now. The boy has two dolls. Hayavadana comes there. Bhagwata and Actor-2 are talking lightly and creating fun. They all starts laughing. That boy too starts laughing and the dolls slip out of his hand. Bhagwata says that the boy hasn't expressed any emotions of happiness, anger, sorrow in past 5 years. Today he is smiling just because of Hayavadana.  \n\nNow Hayavadana tells his story. when he was trying to behead himself in the temple, the goddess Kali appeared. Hayavadana tells his desire. The goddess Kali without listening to him fully, gives him blessings. Hayavadana becomes a complete Horse instead of becoming a complete man. Yet he is satisfied. He still has ability to speak like a man. He wants to lose this voice. He is singing national Anthem as he believes that people who sing national anthem, lose their voice early. Meanwhile he sobs. The boy starts sings a tragic song which was chanted by his mother, Padmini. Hayavadana tries to laugh and his voice completely changes into a horse'. Now Hayavadana is a complete horse. \n\nBhagwata asks the Actor to go Brahmin Vidyasagar and informs him that his grandson is coming to him riding on a great horse. Bhagwata  thanks Lord Ganesha for the successful performance of the play.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hayavadana/act-2|title=LitCharts|website=LitCharts|language=en|access-date=2020-01-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200113150018/https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hayavadana/act-2|archive-date=2020-01-13|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Indian plays]]\n[[Category:1971 plays]]\n[[Category:Kannada literature]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Add italic title", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayavadana"}
