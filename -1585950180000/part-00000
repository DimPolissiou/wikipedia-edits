From 1955, Bourdin worked mostly with ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' as well as other publications including ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''. He shot ad campaigns for [[Chanel]], [[Charles Jourdan]], [[Pentax]] and [[Bloomingdale's]].\n\nHis work is collected by important institutions including [[Tate]] in London,<ref name=\"tate-collection\">{{cite web|last1=Tate|title=Tate, Collection|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/search?aid=13592&sort=date&type=artwork}}</ref> [[MoMA]], [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] and [[Getty Museum]]. The first retrospective exhibition of his work was held at the [[Victoria & Albert Museum]] in London in 2003, and then toured the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in Melbourne, Australia, and the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]] in Paris. The [[Tate]] is permanently exhibiting a part of its collection (one of the largest) with works made between 1950 and 1955.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tate|title=Tate, Texture and Photography|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/display/texture-and-photography}}</ref>\n\nHe is considered as one of the best known [[photography|photographers]] of fashion and advertising of the second half of the 20th century. He set the stage for a new kind of fashion photography. \"While conventional fashion images make beauty and clothing their central elements, Bourdin\u2019s photographs offer a radical alternative.\"<ref name=\"victoriaalbertmuseum\">{{cite news|title=Victoria and Albert Museum: Photographs by Guy Bourdin| url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/p/guy-bourdin-exhibition}}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\nBourdin was born 2 December 1928 in [[Paris]], [[France]].  His parents separated when he was an infant and he was sent to live with his paternal grandparents who owned a house in Normandy.  His grandparents were also owners of a restaurant in Paris called Brasserie Bourdin. When his father, who was only 18 at the time of his birth, remarried, Bourdin was again under his care. Apparently Bourdin only saw his mother once when she arrived at the Brasserie to present him with a gift. Thereafter, his only communication with his mother took place in the side-by-side phone booths of the Brasserie where his participation would be ensured by a locked door. At the age of eighteen Bourdin embarked on a cycling tour in Provence during which he met art-dealer Lucien Henry.  Bourdin passed six months living at Henry's house where he concentrated on painting and drawing until it was time for his mandatory military service.\n\nBourdin was first introduced to photography during his service in the Air Force. Stationed in [[Dakar]] (1948\u201349), Bourdin received his initial photographic training, working as an aerial photographer. When he returned to Paris after his service, he supported himself with a number of menial jobs, including as a salesman of camera lenses and also continued to paint, draw and take pictures. During this time he exhibited some of his drawings and in 1950 sought out the mentorship of American expatriate and prodigious [[Surrealist]] [[Man Ray]]. Bourdin was turned away from Man Ray's door six times by his wife and on the seventh finally succeeding in gaining the artist's company when Man Ray himself answered the door and invited Bourdin in. Bourdin had indeed succeeded in gaining the confidence of Man Ray, who later wrote the catalogue for Bourdin's first exhibition in 1952 after accepting him as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. \n\nBourdin made his first exhibition of drawings and paintings at Galerie, Rue de la Bourgogne, Paris. His first photographic exhibition was in 1953. He exhibited under the pseudonym \"Edwin Hallan\" in his early career. His first fashion shots were published in the February 1955 issue of ''[[Vogue Paris]]''. As a contemporary of [[Helmut Newton]], who also worked extensively for Vogue, Bourdin helped establish what contemporary photography is today.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite news|title=Dreamgirls: The photographs of Guy Bourdin | publisher= [[BBC News]]}}</ref> Newton observed, \"Between him and me the magazine became pretty irresistible in many ways and we complemented each other. If he had been alone or I had been alone it wouldn't have worked.\" He continued to work for the magazine until 1987.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAn editor of ''Vogue'' magazine introduced Bourdin to shoe designer [[Charles Jourdan]], who became his patron, and Bourdin shot Jourdan's ad campaigns between 1967 and 1981. His quirky anthropomorphic compositions, intricate ''mise en scene'' ads were recognised as distinctly Bourdin-esque and were always eagerly anticipated by the media.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nIn 1985, Bourdin turned down the [[Grand Prix National de la Photographie]], awarded by the [[Ministry of Culture (France)|French Ministry of Culture]], but his name is retained on the list of award winners. {{citation needed|date=August 2015}} He died of cancer in 1991. <ref>{{cite web|author=Gaby Wood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/apr/13/features.review27 |title=Death becomes her &#124; From the Observer |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}</ref> According to [[Manolo Blahnik]], Bourdin's creative legacy is so immense that his shoes will never be filled by another.<ref>https://lonewolfmag.com/sinister-sexuality-guy-bourdin-photographer/</ref>\n\n==Style==\nGuy Bourdin was among the first to imagine fashion photographies that contained fascinating narratives, dramatic effects with intense color saturation, hyper-realism and cropped compositions while he established the idea that the product is secondary to the image.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.louise-alexander.com/artist/guy-bourdin/|title=Guy Bourdin|website=Louise Alexander Gallery \u2013 Contemporary Art Gallery|publisher=Louise Alexander Gallery|access-date=2018-05-03}}</ref>\n\nBourdin's photographs are often richly sensual but also rely heavily on provocation and ability to shock. Bourdin configured a whole new visual vocabulary with which to associate the goods of haute-couture. The narratives were strange and mysterious, inspired by literature, cinema and art history. Evident through astute reading of his compositional and thematic presentation, Bourdin profited from the influence of a diverse collection of contemporaries: first and foremost, his mentor Man Ray, but also the photographer [[Edward Weston]], surrealist painters [[Magritte]] and [[Balthus]], and Spanish surrealist filmmaker [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]].\n\n== Collections ==\nBourdin's work is held in the following public collections:\n* [[Tate]], London: 27 works acquired in 2014\n* [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London<ref>{{cite web|title=Victoria and Albert Museum \u2013 Guy Bourdin exhibition|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O118900/cracks-on-a-surface-photograph-bourdin-guy/ }}</ref>\n* [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York<ref>{{cite web|title=MoMa Collection|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/artists/8189?locale=en}}</ref>\n* [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]<ref>{{cite web|title=National Portrait Gallery Collection|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw280074/Francis-Bacon?LinkID=mp155974&role=art&rNo=0?locale=en}}</ref>\n* [[International Center of Photography]], New York City<ref>{{cite web|title=ICP Collection|url=http://www.icp.org/browse/archive/constituents/guy-bourdin?all/all/all/all/0 }}</ref>\n* [[Getty Museum]], Los Angeles, California<ref>{{cite web|title=Getty Collection|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/artists/18952/guy-bourdin-french-1928-1991/}}</ref>\n* [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], San Francisco, California<ref>{{cite web|title=SFMoMa Collection|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/artist/Guy_Bourdin}}</ref>\n* [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]], Houston, Texas<ref>{{cite web|title=Museum of Fine Art Houston Collection|url=https://collections.mfah.org/art/search?q=Guy+Bourdin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322021935/https://collections.mfah.org/art/search?q=Guy+Bourdin|url-status=dead|archive-date=2016-03-22}}</ref>\n* [[Mus\u00e9e de l'Elys\u00e9e]], Lausanne, Switzerland<ref>{{cite web|title=Mus\u00e9e de l'Elys\u00e9e Collection|url=http://www.elysee.ch/collections-et-bibliotheque/les-collections/photographes/}}</ref>\n* [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], Detroit, Portrait of Kelly Williams at Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi\n\n== Books ==\n* ''Guy Bourdin.''

{"title_page": "Zugangserschwerungsgesetz", "text_new": "{{Expand German|Zugangserschwerungsgesetz|date=May 2011}}\nThe '''Zugangserschwerungsgesetz''' (Access Impediment Act, or ZugErschwG) was a [[Germany|German]] law that aimed to make it difficult to access sites on the [[World Wide Web]] with depictions of sexual activity by and against children ([[child pornography]]). The [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Federal Criminal Police Office]] would maintain a list of sites found to contain child pornography as defined by German criminal law. A two-fold strategy was intended: if it proved impossible to have offending sites taken down in appropriate time, German [[Internet service provider]]s would be required to block access to the sites through methods such as [[DNS cache poisoning|DNS poisoning]]. Surfers would be redirected to a page showing a \u201cstop\u201d sign. Prosecution ''solely'' because of an attempt to access blocked site or domain was not planned.\n\nThe move to introduce [[Block (Internet)|Internet blocking]] started in 2008; it was promoted by [[Ursula von der Leyen]], then minister for family affairs, who campaigned for ISPs to introduce blocking through self-regulatory agreements with the government.

The [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Federal Criminal Police Office]] would maintain a list of sites found to contain child pornography as defined by German criminal law. A two-fold strategy was intended: if it proved impossible to have offending sites taken down in appropriate time, German [[Internet service provider]]s would be required to block access to the sites through methods such as [[DNS cache poisoning|DNS poisoning]]. Surfers would be redirected to a page showing a \u201cstop\u201d sign. Prosecution ''solely'' because of an attempt to access blocked site or domain was not planned.\n\nThe move to introduce [[Block (Internet)|Internet blocking]] started in 2008; it was promoted by [[Ursula von der Leyen]], then minister for family affairs, who campaigned for ISPs to introduce blocking through self-regulatory agreements with the government.
