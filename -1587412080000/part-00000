Underground, near Gollum's lair under the Misty Mountains, Bilbo accidentally finds a [[One Ring|magic ring of invisibility]] that, unbeknownst to him, belongs to Gollum. After playing a riddle game with Bilbo, Gollum plans to use the Ring to kill and eat Bilbo. Upon discovering that he has lost the Ring, Gollum deduces that Bilbo had it from his last riddle - \"What have I got in my pocket?\u201d - and chases after him, but by then Bilbo has discovered the Ring's power and disappeared. Bilbo at first thought to kill Gollum, but spares his life out of pity and leaps over him to escape.<ref group=T name=\"Riddles\"/>\n\nBy the end of the journey, Bilbo has become wiser and more confident, having saved the day in many precarious situations. He rescues the Dwarves from giant spiders with the magic ring and a short [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Sting|Elven-sword]] that he had acquired. He uses the magic ring to sneak around in dangerous places, and he uses his wits to smuggle the 13 Dwarves out of the Wood-elves' prison. When tensions arose over ownership of the treasures beneath the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo uses the Arkenstone, a stolen heirloom jewel, as leverage in an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a compromise between the Dwarves, the Wood-elves, and the Men of Lake-town. In so doing, Bilbo strains his relationship with Thorin; however, the two are reconciled at Thorin's deathbed following the Battle of the Five Armies. In addition to becoming wealthy from his share of the Dwarves' treasure, Bilbo finds that he has traded respectability for experience and wisdom. At the end of the book, Gandalf proclaims that Bilbo is no longer the Hobbit that he had been.\n\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n\n''The Lord of the Rings'', begins with Bilbo's \"eleventy-first\" (111th) birthday, 60 years after the beginning of ''[[The Hobbit]]''.

After playing a riddle game with Bilbo, Gollum plans to use the Ring to kill and eat Bilbo. Upon discovering that he has lost the Ring, Gollum deduces that Bilbo had it from his last riddle - \"What have I got in my pocket?\u201d - and chases after him, but by then Bilbo has discovered the Ring's power and disappeared.

He rescues the Dwarves from giant spiders with the magic ring and a short [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Sting|Elven-sword]] that he had acquired. He uses the magic ring to sneak around in dangerous places, and he uses his wits to smuggle the 13 Dwarves out of the Wood-elves' prison. When tensions arose over ownership of the treasures beneath the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo uses the Arkenstone, a stolen heirloom jewel, as leverage in an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a compromise between the Dwarves, the Wood-elves, and the Men of Lake-town. In so doing, Bilbo strains his relationship with Thorin; however, the two are reconciled at Thorin's deathbed following the Battle of the Five Armies. In addition to becoming wealthy from his share of the Dwarves' treasure, Bilbo finds that he has traded respectability for experience and wisdom.

In 1938, he transferred to the drama school of the [[Schauspielhaus (Berlin)|Staatliches Schauspielhaus]] in Berlin. In 1939, because of his membership in the [[German Youth Movement|''B\u00fcndischen Jugend'']] he was imprisoned for many months in the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]. After his release he moved to Vienna, and then in 1944 to Switzerland.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, he starred in many films, like ''[[The Last Bridge|Die letzte Br\u00fccke]]'' (1953) and ''[[Jackboot Mutiny|Es geschah am 20. Juli]]'' (1955). He was also a photographer. His first attempt at directing came three years later with the documentary ''Warum sind sie gegen uns?'' (1958). He became internationally famous with his anti-war film of 1959 called ''[[Die Br\u00fccke (film)|Die Br\u00fccke]]'', which was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].<ref name=\"Oscars1960\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1960 |title=The 32nd Academy Awards (1960) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=27 October 2011|work=oscars.org}}</ref> In 1961, he won the [[Silver Bear for Best Director]] at the [[11th Berlin International Film Festival]] for his film ''[[The Miracle of Father Malachia]]''.<ref name=\"berlinale 1961\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1961/03_preistr_ger_1961/03_Preistraeger_1961.html |title=Berlinale 1961: Prize Winners |accessdate=22 January 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> His break in Hollywood came shortly thereafter when he was chosen to direct [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Yul Brynner]] in the highly acclaimed World War II espionage thriller, ''[[Morituri (1965 film)|Morituri]]'' in 1965.\n\nAfter his death, a fund was started in 2001 and named after him in Munich, the Bernhard Wicki Memorial Fund. Since 2002, it has awarded a film prize, ''The Bridge'', being considered a peace prize. A further prize was endowed in 2006 with 15,000 euros, a prize given in the city of [[Emden]] since 2000. He was a patron of the International Film Festival in Emden-Norderney which first started in 1990.\n\nHe first married Agnes Fink, a fellow acting colleague, and later married Elisabeth Endriss, also a colleague. In the documentary ''Verst\u00f6rung - und eine Art von Poesie'' (June, 2007), Elisabeth Wicki-Endriss portrayed the life and work for Wicki.\n\nHe is buried at the [[Nymphenburg]]er cemetery in Munich (grave number 4-1-23).\n\n==Selected filmography==\n'''Director'''\n* ''Warum sind sie gegen uns?''

In 1938, he transferred to the drama school of the [[Schauspielhaus (Berlin)|Staatliches Schauspielhaus]] in Berlin. In 1939, because of his membership in the [[German Youth Movement|''B\u00fcndischen Jugend'']] he was imprisoned for many months in the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]. After his release he moved to Vienna, and then in 1944 to Switzerland.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, he starred in many films, like ''[[The Last Bridge|Die letzte Br\u00fccke]]'' (1953) and ''[[Jackboot Mutiny|Es geschah am 20. Juli]]'' (1955). He was also a photographer. His first attempt at directing came three years later with the documentary ''Warum sind sie gegen uns?'' (1958). He became internationally famous with his anti-war film of 1959 called ''[[Die Br\u00fccke (film)|Die Br\u00fccke]]'', which was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].<ref name=\"Oscars1960\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1960 |title=The 32nd Academy Awards (1960) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=27 October 2011|work=oscars.org}}</ref> In 1961, he won the [[Silver Bear for Best Director]] at the [[11th Berlin International Film Festival]] for his film ''[[The Miracle of Father Malachia]]''.<ref name=\"berlinale 1961\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1961/03_preistr_ger_1961/03_Preistraeger_1961.html |title=Berlinale 1961: Prize Winners |accessdate=22 January 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> His break in Hollywood came shortly thereafter when he was chosen to direct [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Yul Brynner]] in the highly acclaimed World War II espionage thriller, ''[[Morituri (1965 film)|Morituri]]'' in 1965.\n\nAfter his death, a fund was started in 2001 and named after him in Munich, the Bernhard Wicki Memorial Fund. Since 2002, it has awarded a film prize, ''The Bridge'', being considered a peace prize. A further prize was endowed in 2006 with 15,000 euros, a prize given in the city of [[Emden]] since 2000. He was a patron of the International Film Festival in Emden-Norderney which first started in 1990.\n\nHe first married Agnes Fink, a fellow acting colleague, and later married Elisabeth Endriss, also a colleague. In the documentary ''Verst\u00f6rung - und eine Art von Poesie'' (June, 2007), Elisabeth Wicki-Endriss portrayed the life and work for Wicki.\n\nHe is buried at the [[Nymphenburg]]er cemetery in Munich (grave number 4-1-23).\n\n==Selected filmography==\n'''Director'''\n* ''Warum sind sie gegen uns?''

In the first years of the 20th century she toured with a variety of stage productions, eventually gaining work on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in supporting roles. From 1908 until 1913 she was leading lady of the [[Orpheum Players]] at [[Philadelphia]]'s [[Chestnut Street Theatre]]. In 1919 she abandoned the stage temporarily to make silent films, completing ten before returning to Broadway the following year. In the 1930s Barney turned her attention to radio, beginning with the title role of an [[NBC Blue]] summer program titled ''[[Tish (radio program)|Tish]]'' in 1932. For Carrington she was a series regular, most notably playing matronly characters in  ''[[Rosemary (radio series)|Rosemary]]'', ''[[Pepper Young's Family]]'', and ''[[When a Girl Marries]]''.
