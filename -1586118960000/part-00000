The regiment served as [[mounted infantry]] from March 17, 1863, to November 1, 1864, notably as part of the [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]] during the [[Tullahoma campaign|Tullahoma]] and [[Chickamauga campaign|Chickamauga]] Campaigns.\n\n==Initial Infantry Service==\nThe 72nd Indiana Infantry was organized at [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]], [[Indiana]] and mustered in for a three-year enlistment at [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, on August 16, 1862, under the command of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Abram O. Miller.\n\n==Conversion to Mounted Infantry ==\n\nIn December 1862, the regiment received a new brigade commander, Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]. After frustrating chases on foot after mounted rebel cavalry raiders, the brigade was converted to mounted infantry. At the same time, Wilder proposed to the regiments in the brigade the private purchase of repeating rifles. The 72nd voted to go ahead with the conversion to mounted infantry and the purchase of the rifles. Along with the other regiments in the brigade, the 72nd chose [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], as their weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> \n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade,\" the 72nd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\nAfter intense training and development of new tactics, the \"Lightning Brigade\" was ready for service.

The 72nd drove the enemy before it along the seven mile length of the gap until they were halted by four brigades of infantry and four batteries of guns at the southeastern exit. The massive superiority of firepower the 17th and its brethren had with the Spencers allowed them to entrench and hold the southern entrance against numerous assaults by numerically superior rebel infantry and artillery through the rainy day until the sodden remainder of the XIV Corps slogged to join them at their position.\n\nWith the Lightning Brigade, the 72nd found itself detached from the XIV Corps to serve as a mobile reserve for all three of the Corps within the Cumberland. After playing a key role in the [[Second Battle of Chattanooga|feint]] that forced Bragg from Chattanooga, the regiment raided, skirmished, and scouted through the summer into the [[Chickamauga Campaign]]. The brigade distinguished itself with its performance at [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]]. During the battle, it maintained integrity and discipline exacting high casualties on its attackers. After the battle, it retreated with the army to Chattanooga where it was besieged. \n\nThe performance of the brigade had demonstrated the value of mounted infantry, and Wilder and the regiments were commended. During the reorganization after Grant took command in the city, the brigade was broken up and the regiments were transferred to the Cavalry Corps. The 72nd and the [[123rdh Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|123rd Illinois]] were assigned to 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps.\n\n==Service History==\n\nIts assignments were as follows:\n* 40th Brigade, 12th Division, [[Army of the Ohio]], to November 1862. \n* 2nd Brigade, 5th Division, Center, [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], [[Army of the Cumberland]], to January 1863. \n* 2nd Brigade, 5th Division, XIV Corps, to June 1863. \n* 1st Brigade, 4th Division, XIV Corps, to October 1863.* \n* Wilder's Mounted Infantry Brigade, Cavalry Corps, Army of the Cumberland, to December 1863. \n* 3rd Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division, Army of the Cumberland, to January 1864. \n* 3rd Brigade, Grierson's Cavalry Division, [[XVI Corps (Union Army)|XVI Corps]], [[Army of the Tennessee]], to March 1864. \n* 3rd Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division, Army of the Cumberland, to October 1864. \n* 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, Wilson's Cavalry Corps, Military Division Mississippi, to June 1865.\n\nThe 72nd Indiana Infantry mustered out of service at [[Nashville, Tennessee]], on June 26, 1865.\n\n==Detailed service==\nLeft Indiana for Lebanon, Kentucky, August 17.

The borough is located in the [[Lehigh Valley]] region of eastern Pennsylvania. As of the 2010 census, Northampton's population was 9,926. \n\nIt was known as a center of cement manufacturing. [[Atlas Portland Cement Company]], the world's largest at one time, was among the local companies for nearly 100 years before it closed in 1982. The county was also a center of heavy industry, dominated by [[Bethlehem Steel]].\n\n==History==\nNorthampton and surrounding areas of the [[Lehigh Valley]] are rich in [[limestone]], which is commonly used in the production of [[cement]]. The [[Atlas Portland Cement Company]], based here from 1895 to 1982, was the world's largest cement company at one time, and one of dozens in the area. It produced some 8 million barrels of cement for construction of the [[Panama Canal]], most of what was used on the project. Atlas was bought by another company in 1980 and ceased operation here in 1982; its last smokestack here was demolished in 1993. Today technology and automation mean that the cement industry can manufacture a great amount of product with 150-200 workers, rather than the thousands who worked in these plants earlier in the 20th century.<ref name=\"atlasMus\"/> \n\nThe Atlas Memorial Cement Museum, which was opened in 1997 here, was founded by Edward Pany, who worked at the company in summers during the 1950s. His father, an immigrant from [[Austria]], worked all his life at Atlas. Immigrant workers from Poland, Ukraine, and other eastern European nations also worked here. The museum commemorates the importance of this industry and Atlas Cement in the area.<ref name=\"atlasMus\">{{cite web|title=Cement museum nurtures nostalgia in Pennsylvania|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-05-20/news/0605200196_1_cement-dust-largest-cement-producer-atlas-plant|last=Duck|first=Michael|publisher=Chicago Tribune| date=20 May 2006|website=tribunedigital-chicagotribune}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nNorthampton is located {{convert|8|mi|km}} north of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]] and {{convert|15|mi|km}} west of [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]] at {{Coord|40|41|2|N|75|29|29|W|type:city}} (40.683896, -75.491353).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer |quote= 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough/city has a total area of {{convert|2.7|sqmi|km2}}; {{convert|2.6|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} (3.70%), water.

The [[population density]] was 3,619.1 people per square mile (1,396.7/km<sup>2</sup>). There were 4,023 housing units at an average density of 1,548.1 per square mile (597.4/km<sup>2</sup>). The racial makeup of the borough was 98.21% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.35% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.05% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.44% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.39% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.55% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 1.74% of the population.\n\nThere were 3,869 households, out of which 30.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.3% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 10.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.9% were non-families. 27.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.40 and the average family size was 2.92.\n\nIn the borough the population was spread out, with 22.4% under the age of 18, 5.8% from 18 to 24, 32.2% from 25 to 44, 21.0% from 45 to 64, and 18.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females there were 91.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.1 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the borough was $40,982, and the median income for a family was $49,482. Males had a median income of $37,033 versus $26,422 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the borough was $19,516. About 1.3% of families and 3.7% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 1.4% of those under age 18 and 5.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==History==\nNorthampton was created from the villages of Siegfried, Newport and Stemton, which together were formed into an alliance in 1902. \n\nDue to the limestone formations in the region, Northampton became a global center for the manufacturing of [[cement]]. [[Atlas Portland Cement Company]], the largest such company in the world at one time, operated here from 1895 to 1982. It supplied most of the cement used in the construction of the [[Panama Canal]].<ref name=\"atlasMus\" />\n\n\nIn 1909, Atlas petitioned county courts to change the alliance into a borough, reportedly because the change would make it easier for the company to send and receive mail. The Atlas Portland Cement Company plant closed in 1982. Borough residents, many of them former Atlas employees or their descendants, still identify strongly with the company and its history. For example, the [[Northampton Area School District]] mascot is the \"Konkrete Kid.\"<ref name=\"nasd\">http://www.nasdschools.org/high-school.cfm?subpage=9</ref> In addition, in 1996 the Atlas Memorial Cement Museum was opened in the borough\n\nHistorical community events included the Northampton Jack Frost Parade every October before Halloween, celebrating the onset of winter. It includes marching bands and floats.\n\nAnother event that occurred during the 1940s and 1950s was the Northampton County Fair, which was held every year and was spread out across the Lappawinzo Fish & Game Club property North of Northampton (off Kreidersville Road). There were huge numbers of vendor stands, fair rides, animals, shows/performances, 4-H Club judgings, as well as Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey shows. Visitors came from all over the East Coast during the two-week event and hourly buses ran from downtown Northampton and nearby cities to the Fair.\n\nPart of the opening sequence of the 1992 film ''[[School Ties]]'' was filmed in downtown Northampton due to the town's preservation of older buildings, which fit with the 1950s setting of the film.\n\n==Public education==\nThe borough is served by the [[Northampton Area School District]]. There are 4 elementary schools, a middle school and one high school.\n\nThe Borough is also home to Good Shepherd Catholic School in the 4th Ward. It serves grades Pre-K to 8th grade. It is part of the [[Diocese of Allentown]]. There was St. John's school but it closed in 2003.\n\n==Museums==\n*The Atlas Cement Memorial Museum, based in Northampton\n==Sister city==\n*{{flagicon|AUT}} [[Stegersbach]],

The borough is located in the [[Lehigh Valley]] region of eastern Pennsylvania. As of the 2010 census, Northampton's population was 9,926. \n\nIt was known as a center of cement manufacturing. [[Atlas Portland Cement Company]], the world's largest at one time, was among the local companies for nearly 100 years before it closed in 1982. The county was also a center of heavy industry, dominated by [[Bethlehem Steel]].\n\n==History==\nNorthampton and surrounding areas of the [[Lehigh Valley]] are rich in [[limestone]], which is commonly used in the production of [[cement]]. The [[Atlas Portland Cement Company]], based here from 1895 to 1982, was the world's largest cement company at one time, and one of dozens in the area. It produced some 8 million barrels of cement for construction of the [[Panama Canal]], most of what was used on the project. Atlas was bought by another company in 1980 and ceased operation here in 1982; its last smokestack here was demolished in 1993. Today technology and automation mean that the cement industry can manufacture a great amount of product with 150-200 workers, rather than the thousands who worked in these plants earlier in the 20th century.<ref name=\"atlasMus\"/> \n\nThe Atlas Memorial Cement Museum, which was opened in 1997 here, was founded by Edward Pany, who worked at the company in summers during the 1950s. His father, an immigrant from [[Austria]], worked all his life at Atlas. Immigrant workers from Poland, Ukraine, and other eastern European nations also worked here. The museum commemorates the importance of this industry and Atlas Cement in the area.<ref name=\"atlasMus\">{{cite web|title=Cement museum nurtures nostalgia in Pennsylvania|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-05-20/news/0605200196_1_cement-dust-largest-cement-producer-atlas-plant|last=Duck|first=Michael|publisher=Chicago Tribune| date=20 May 2006|website=tribunedigital-chicagotribune}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nNorthampton is located {{convert|8|mi|km}} north of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]] and {{convert|15|mi|km}} west of [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]] at {{Coord|40|41|2|N|75|29|29|W|type:city}} (40.683896, -75.491353).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer |years= 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough/city has a total area of {{convert|2.7|sqmi|km2}}; {{convert|2.6|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} (3.70%), water.

The [[population density]] was 3,619.1 people per square mile (1,396.7/km<sup>2</sup>). There were 4,023 housing units at an average density of 1,548.1 per square mile (597.4/km<sup>2</sup>). The racial makeup of the borough was 98.21% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.35% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.05% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.44% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.39% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.55% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 1.74% of the population.\n\nThere were 3,869 households, out of which 30.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.3% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 10.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.9% were non-families. 27.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.40 and the average family size was 2.92.\n\nIn the borough the population was spread out, with 22.4% under the age of 18, 5.8% from 18 to 24, 32.2% from 25 to 44, 21.0% from 45 to 64, and 18.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females there were 91.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.1 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the borough was $40,982, and the median income for a family was $49,482. Males had a median income of $37,033 versus $26,422 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the borough was $19,516. About 1.3% of families and 3.7% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 1.4% of those under age 18 and 5.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==History==\nNorthampton was created from the villages of Siegfried, Newport and Stemton, which together were formed into an alliance in 1902. \n\nDue to the limestone formations in the region, Northampton became a global center for the manufacturing of [[cement]]. [[Atlas Portland Cement Company]], the largest such company in the world at one time, operated here from 1895 to 1982. It supplied most of the cement used in the construction of the [[Panama Canal]].<ref name=\"atlasMus\" />\n\n\nIn 1909, Atlas petitioned county courts to change the alliance into a borough, reportedly because the change would make it easier for the company to send and receive mail. The Atlas Portland Cement Company plant closed in 1982. Borough residents, many of them former Atlas employees or their descendants, still identify strongly with the company and its history. For example, the [[Northampton Area School District]] mascot is the \"Konkrete Kid.\"<ref name=\"nasd\">http://www.nasdschools.org/high-school.cfm?subpage=9</ref> In addition, in 1996 the Atlas Memorial Cement Museum was opened in the borough\n\nHistorical community events included the Northampton Jack Frost Parade every October before Halloween, celebrating the onset of winter. It includes marching bands and floats.\n\nAnother event that occurred during the 1940s and 1950s was the Northampton County Fair, which was held every year and was spread out across the Lappawinzo Fish & Game Club property North of Northampton (off Kreidersville Road). There were huge numbers of vendor stands, fair rides, animals, shows/performances, 4-H Club judgings, as well as Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey shows. Visitors came from all over the East Coast during the two-week event and hourly buses ran from downtown Northampton and nearby cities to the Fair.\n\nPart of the opening sequence of the 1992 film ''[[School Ties]]'' was filmed in downtown Northampton due to the town's preservation of older buildings, which fit with the 1950s setting of the film.\n\n==Public education==\nThe borough is served by the [[Northampton Area School District]]. There are 4 elementary schools, a middle school and one high school.\n\nThe Borough is also home to Good Shepherd Catholic School in the 4th Ward. It serves grades Pre-K to 8th grade. It is part of the [[Diocese of Allentown]]. There was St. John's school but it closed in 2003.\n\n==Museums==\n*The Atlas Cement Memorial Museum, based in Northampton\n==Sister city==\n*{{flagicon|AUT}} [[Stegersbach]], [[Austria]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[http://www.northamptonboro.com/ Official website]\n*[http://www.northamptoncounty.org/northampton/site/default.asp Northampton County official website]\n{{Geographic Location\n| Centre    = Northampton\n| Northeast = [[Bath, Pennsylvania|Bath]]\n| North     = [[Cherryville, Pennsylvania|Cherryville]]\n| East      = [[Allen Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Allen Township]]\n| Southeast = \n| South     = [[North Catasauqua, Pennsylvania|North Catasauqua]]\n| Southwest = \n| West      = [[Cementon, Pennsylvania|Cementon]], [[Coplay, Pennsylvania|Coplay]]\n| Northwest = \n}}\n{{Northampton County, Pennsylvania}}\n{{New York metropolitan area}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1867]]\n[[Category:Boroughs in Northampton County, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian communities in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Quebec99", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixed reference", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northampton,_Pennsylvania"}

The county was named for [[David Moffat|David H. Moffat]], a Colorado tycoon who died in 1911. His railroad, the [[Denver, Northwestern & Pacific Railway|Denver, Northwestern & Pacific]], attempted to build a route from [[Denver]] to [[Salt Lake City]]. In 1913, a reorganized railroad, the [[Denver and Salt Lake Railway|Denver & Salt Lake]], reached as far as [[Craig, Colorado|Craig]], the county seat, but no farther. In the late 1890s and early 1900s, all state District Courts were held in Denver, in the State courthouse there, due to a lack of funds to build courthouses locally. All murder trials were held in Denver, in the District Courts.\n\nAllegedly, so many murders occurred between sheep farmers from Wyoming and cattle ranchers from Colorado that the presiding judges\u2014tired of presiding over these murder trials\u2014requested that the State legislature split Routt County into what is now Routt and Moffat counties; the legislature complied.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|4751|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|4743|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|7.6|sqmi}} (0.2%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is the second-largest county by area in Colorado.\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Routt County, Colorado|Routt County]] &ndash; east\n* [[Rio Blanco County, Colorado|Rio Blanco County]] &ndash; south\n* [[Uintah County, Utah]] &ndash; west\n* [[Daggett County, Utah]] &ndash; west\n* [[Sweetwater County, Wyoming]] &ndash; north\n* [[Carbon County, Wyoming]] &ndash; north\n\n===National protected areas===\n*[[Browns Park National Wildlife Refuge]]\n*[[Dinosaur National Monument]]\n*[[Routt National Forest]]\n*[[White River National Forest]]\n*[[Yampa River State Park]]\n\n===Scenic byway===\n*[[Dinosaur Diamond Prehistoric Highway National Scenic Byway]]\n\n===Major highways===\n[[File:Moffat County, Colorado.JPG|225px|thumbnail|right|Entering Moffat County from the east on U.S. Route 40.]]\n\n* [[Image:US 40.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 40 in Colorado|U.S. Highway 40]]\n* [[Image:Colorado 13.svg|20px]] [[Colorado State Highway 13|State Highway 13]]\n* [[Image:Colorado 64.svg|20px]] [[Colorado State Highway 64|State Highway 64]]\n* [[Image:Colorado 317.svg|20px]] [[Colorado State Highway 317|State Highway 317]]\n* [[Image:Colorado 318.svg|20px]] [[Colorado State Highway 318|State Highway 318]]\n* [[Image:Colorado 394.svg|20px]] [[Colorado State Highway 394|State Highway 394]]\n* [[Image:WY-70.svg|20px]] [[Wyoming Highway 70]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 5129\n|1930= 4861\n|1940= 5086\n|1950= 5946\n|1960= 7061\n|1970= 6525\n|1980= 13133\n|1990= 11357\n|2000= 13184\n|2010= 13795\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=13188\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 12, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 8, 2014}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=June 8, 2014}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/co190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 8, 2014}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

The county was named for [[David Moffat|David H. Moffat]], a Colorado tycoon who died in 1911. His railroad, the [[Denver, Northwestern & Pacific Railway|Denver, Northwestern & Pacific]], attempted to build a route from [[Denver]] to [[Salt Lake City]]. In 1913, a reorganized railroad, the [[Denver and Salt Lake Railway|Denver & Salt Lake]], reached as far as [[Craig, Colorado|Craig]], the county seat, but no farther. In the late 1890s and early 1900s, all state District Courts were held in Denver, in the State courthouse there, due to a lack of funds to build courthouses locally. All murder trials were held in Denver, in the District Courts.\n\nAllegedly, so many murders occurred between sheep farmers from Wyoming and cattle ranchers from Colorado that the presiding judges\u2014tired of presiding over these murder trials\u2014requested that the State legislature split Routt County into what is now Routt and Moffat counties; the legislature complied.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|4751|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|4743|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|7.6|sqmi}} (0.2%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is the second-largest county by area in Colorado.\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Routt County, Colorado|Routt County]] &ndash; east\n* [[Rio Blanco County, Colorado|Rio Blanco County]] &ndash; south\n* [[Uintah County, Utah]] &ndash; west\n* [[Daggett County, Utah]] &ndash; west\n* [[Sweetwater County, Wyoming]] &ndash; north\n* [[Carbon County, Wyoming]] &ndash; north\n\n===National protected areas===\n*[[Browns Park National Wildlife Refuge]]\n*[[Dinosaur National Monument]]\n*[[Routt National Forest]]\n*[[White River National Forest]]\n*[[Yampa River State Park]]\n\n===Scenic byway===\n*[[Dinosaur Diamond Prehistoric Highway National Scenic Byway]]\n\n===Major highways===\n[[File:Moffat County, Colorado.JPG|225px|thumbnail|right|Entering Moffat County from the east on U.S. Route 40.]]\n\n* [[Image:US 40.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 40 in Colorado|U.S. Highway 40]]\n* [[Image:Colorado 13.svg|20px]] [[Colorado State Highway 13|State Highway 13]]\n* [[Image:Colorado 64.svg|20px]] [[Colorado State Highway 64|State Highway 64]]\n* [[Image:Colorado 317.svg|20px]] [[Colorado State Highway 317|State Highway 317]]\n* [[Image:Colorado 318.svg|20px]] [[Colorado State Highway 318|State Highway 318]]\n* [[Image:Colorado 394.svg|20px]] [[Colorado State Highway 394|State Highway 394]]\n* [[Image:WY-70.svg|20px]] [[Wyoming Highway 70]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 5129\n|1930= 4861\n|1940= 5086\n|1950= 5946\n|1960= 7061\n|1970= 6525\n|1980= 13133\n|1990= 11357\n|2000= 13184\n|2010= 13795\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=13188\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 12, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 8, 2014}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=June 8, 2014}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/co190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 8, 2014}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

As of 2013 census, the town has a population of 10,137 inhabitants, while the municipality has 25,720 inhabitants.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\nThe first written document about Modri\u010da is 13th century charter of Hungarian King Bela IV in which Modri\u010da is mentioned as spring: \"...fons Modricha, ubi cadit in Boznam\", but it all indicates that it was minor stream which was flowing into Bosna river. According to traditional stories, Modri\u010da was named after the small river with blue, mountain water. It is assumed that the small river is Dusa. According to other narratives, area bears the name of the old Slavic marks of the blue sky and distances, which are more discerned on the horizon than visible \u2013 modrina (the blue)/modri\u010da.\n\nThere is archaeological evidence of human presence in the territory of present-day Modrica municipality back in the Paleolithic - Old Stone Age. This is evidenced by traces discovered at the site Gradina in the village of Dugo Polje above the valley of Bosna river.\nTraces of ancient Neolithic farmers were found in several places, among others at locations Kuli\u0161te in Kruskovo Polje, at Zdralovo brdo in village Kladari, at location Prljaca, then in villages Vranjak, Kuznjaca, Skugric, Dugo Polje, etc. At Dobor hill is important site with seven archaeological layers of the Iron Age. Traces of old Slavic settlements can be found in several places in Modrica municipality. In the charter of Kotromanic from 1323 mentioned is parish Nenaviste with settlements Modrica and Jakes.\n\nThe events were developing around Dobor fortress which presage the end of the Bosnian national independence. Those were conflicts with Hungarians in 1393/94 and 1408th, and the cut of 170 Bosnian boyars on the ramparts of the fort. These areas then became cruel war frontier in a fit of the Turks, and they won Dobor and Modrica in the 1536th. After the defeat of the Turks at Vienna 1683rd, in the next two centuries this was the border area, and that means - the zone of conflicts, rebellions, devastation and economic stagnation. During Austrian-Hungarian rule, in 1897 Modrica has been included in list of such towns that Bosnia and Herzegovina had only 66.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century economic and cultural - educational conditions are slowly improving. Memory was recorded that school existed, maybe even at the end of the 18th century, and in any case from the second half of the 19th century. Modrica was a nursery of schools in the rural area. From 1929\u201339, Modri\u010da was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] and from 1939-41 of the [[Banovina of Croatia]] within the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nThe conditions improved in the second half of 20th century. because in 1947 railroad \u0160amac-Sarajevo passed through city, with a branch line Modri\u0107a-Grada\u010dac built in 1951. Then some factories in the city were built: oil refinery, factories  of paper and plastic boxes Pamo and Plastmo, flour mill, shoe factory \"Vjekoslav Bakuli\u0107\", clolor dis-solver factory \"Hemija\" and small wood factory \"8th September\", together with a required town infrastructure (residential buildings, secondary school, sport hall),. The wheat and cattle\u00a0 farm \"Dr. Mujbegovi\u0107\" (later Petar Mrkonji\u010d) was also expanded.

As of 2013 census, the town has a population of 10,137 inhabitants, while the municipality has 25,720 inhabitants.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\nThe first written document about Modri\u010da is 13th century charter of Hungarian King Bela IV in which Modri\u010da is mentioned as spring: \"...fons Modricha, ubi cadit in Boznam\", but it all indicates that it was minor stream which was flowing into Bosna river. According to traditional stories, Modri\u010da was named after the small river with blue, mountain water. It is assumed that the small river is Dusa. According to other narratives, area bears the name of the old Slavic marks of the blue sky and distances, which are more discerned on the horizon than visible \u2013 modrina (the blue)/modri\u010da.\n\nThere is archaeological evidence of human presence in the territory of present-day Modrica municipality back in the Paleolithic - Old Stone Age. This is evidenced by traces discovered at the site Gradina in the village of Dugo Polje above the valley of Bosna river.\nTraces of ancient Neolithic farmers were found in several places, among others at locations Kuli\u0161te in Kruskovo Polje, at Zdralovo brdo in village Kladari, at location Prljaca, then in villages Vranjak, Kuznjaca, Skugric, Dugo Polje, etc. At Dobor hill is important site with seven archaeological layers of the Iron Age. Traces of old Slavic settlements can be found in several places in Modrica municipality. In the charter of Kotromanic from 1323 mentioned is parish Nenaviste with settlements Modrica and Jakes.\n\nThe events were developing around Dobor fortress which presage the end of the Bosnian national independence. Those were conflicts with Hungarians in 1393/94 and 1408th, and the cut of 170 Bosnian boyars on the ramparts of the fort. These areas then became cruel war frontier in a fit of the Turks, and they won Dobor and Modrica in the 1536th. After the defeat of the Turks at Vienna 1683rd, in the next two centuries this was the border area, and that means - the zone of conflicts, rebellions, devastation and economic stagnation. During Austrian-Hungarian rule, in 1897 Modrica has been included in list of such towns that Bosnia and Herzegovina had only 66.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century economic and cultural - educational conditions are slowly improving. Memory was recorded that school existed, maybe even at the end of the 18th century, and in any case from the second half of the 19th century. Modrica was a nursery of schools in the rural area. From 1929-39, Modri\u010da was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] and from 1939-41 of the [[Banovina of Croatia]] within the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nThe conditions improved in the second half of 20th century. because in 1947 railroad \u0160amac-Sarajevo passed through city, with a branch line Modri\u0107a-Grada\u010dac built in 1951. Then some factories in the city were built: oil refinery, factories  of paper and plastic boxes Pamo and Plastmo, flour mill, shoe factory \"Vjekoslav Bakuli\u0107\", clolor dis-solver factory \"Hemija\" and small wood factory \"8th September\", together with a required town infrastructure (residential buildings, secondary school, sport hall),. The wheat and cattle\u00a0 farm \"Dr. Mujbegovi\u0107\" (later Petar Mrkonji\u010d) was also expanded. Volleyball team \"Modri\u010da\" won the national championship of Yugoslavia in 1979. \n\nAfter the 1992\u201395 [[Bosnian War]], prewar municipal borders were changed, villages of Jake\u0161, Pe\u0107nik and Modri\u010dki Lug were excluded from Modri\u010da and included in new Vukosavlje municipality, and a few villages from the western part of prewar Grada\u010dac municipality were included, thus the size of the municipality changed substantially.\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |Population of settlements \u2013 Modri\u010da municipality\n|-\n|\n|Settlement\n|1948.\n|1953.\n|1961.\n|1971.\n|1981.\n|1991.\n|2013.\n|-\n|\n|Total\n|19,746\n|39,156\n|\n|31,622\n|34,541\n|35,413\n|25,720\n|-\n|1\n|Botajica\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,019\n|579\n|-\n|2\n|\u010cardak\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,006\n|353\n|-\n|3\n|Dobrinja\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|437\n|446\n|-\n|4\n|Donji Skugri\u0107\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|910\n|-\n|5\n|Dugo Polje\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,596\n|994\n|-\n|6\n|Garevac\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|2,795\n|2,993\n|-\n|7\n|Kladari Donji\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,046\n|362\n|-\n|8\n|Kladari Gornji\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|448\n|359\n|-\n|9\n|Koprivna\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|2,218\n|1,151\n|-\n|10\n|Kr\u010devljani\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|282\n|253\n|-\n|11\n|Milo\u0161evac\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,735\n|1,323\n|-\n|12\n|'''Modri\u010da'''\n|3,072\n|\n|5,032\n|7,324\n|9,630\n|10,454\n|10,137\n|-\n|13\n|Skugri\u0107 Gornji\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,453\n|785\n|-\n|14\n|Tarevci\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|2,322\n|2,719\n|-\n|15\n|Tolisa\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|858\n|358\n|-\n|16\n|Vranjak\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|2,370\n|1,419\n|}\n\n===Ethnic composition===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Ethnic composition \u2013 Modri\u010da town\n|-\n|\n|2013.\n|1991.\n|1981.\n|1971.\n|-\n|Total\n|10,137 (100,0%)\n|10,454 (100,0%)\n|9,630 (100,0%)\n|7,324 (100,0%)\n|-\n|Serbs\n|6,952 (73,81%)\n|2,420 (23,15%)\n|1,841 (19,12%)\n|1,428 (19,50%)\n|-\n|Bosniaks\n|1,836 (19,49%)\n|5,252 (50,24%)\n|4,815 (50,00%)\n|4,910 (67,04%)\n|-\n|Others\n|284 (3,015%)\n|301 (2,879%)\n|138 (1,433%)\n|49 (0,669%)\n|-\n|Roma\n|168 (1,784%)\n|\n|38 (0,395%)\n|3 (0,041%)\n|-\n|Croats\n|157 (1,667%)\n|1 134 (10,85%)\n|838 (8,702%)\n|732 (9,995%)\n|-\n|Montenegrins\n|13 (0,138%)\n|\n|29 (0,301%)\n|25 (0,341%)\n|-\n|Slovenes\n|6 (0,064%)\n|\n|4 (0,042%)\n|3 (0,041%)\n|-\n|Macedonians\n|2 (0,021%)\n|\n|3 (0,031%)\n|4 (0,055%)\n|-\n|Albanians\n|1 (0,011%)\n|\n|15 (0,156%)\n|12 (0,164%)\n|-\n|Yugoslavs\n|\n|1 347 (12,89%)\n|1 904 (19,77%)\n|154 (2,103%)\n|-\n|Hungarias\n|\n|\n|5 (0,052%)\n|4 (0,055%)\n|}\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Ethnic composition \u2013 Modri\u010da municipality\n|-\n|\n|2013.\n|1991.\n|1981.\n|1971.\n|-\n|Total\n|25,720 (100,0%)\n|35,613 (100,0%)\n|34,541 (100,0%)\n|31,622 (100,0%)\n|-\n|Serbs\n|20,227 (78,64%)\n|12,534 (35,20%)\n|13,012 (37,67%)\n|13,457 (42,56%)\n|-\n|Bosniaks\n|3,101 (12,06%)\n|10,375 (29,13%)\n|8,578 (24,83%)\n|8,356 (26,42%)\n|-\n|Croats\n|1,674 (6,509%)\n|9,805 (27,53%)\n|9,598 (27,79%)\n|9,418 (29,78%)\n|-\n|Others\n|718 (2,792%)\n|1,048 (2,943%)\n|476 (1,378%)\n|138 (0,436%)\n|-\n|Yugoslavs\n|\n|1,851 (5,198%)\n|2,755 (7,976%)\n|180 (0,569%)\n|-\n|Roma\n|\n|\n|38 (0,110%)\n|3 (0,009%)\n|-\n|Montenegrins\n|\n|\n|37 (0,107%)\n|32 (0,101%)\n|-\n|Albanians\n|\n|\n|29 (0,084%)\n|16 (0,051%)\n|-\n|Macedonians\n|\n|\n|7 (0,020%)\n|10 (0,032%)\n|-\n|Slovenes\n|\n|\n|6 (0,017%)\n|4 (0,013%)\n|-\n|Hungarias\n|\n|\n|5 (0,014%)\n|8 (0,025%)\n|}\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Rafinerija2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Modri\u010da oil refinery]]\nThe Modri\u010da oil refinery, currently owned by Russian investors, is located in Modri\u010da.\n\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered employed people per their core activity (as of 2016):<ref name=\"stats17\">{{cite web|title=Cities and Municipalities of Republika Srpska 2017|url=http://www2.rzs.rs.ba/static/uploads/bilteni/gradovi_i_opstine_republike_srpske/2017/Gradovi_Opstine_Republike_Srpske_2017_WEB.pdf|website=rzs.rs.ba|accessdate=21 October 2018|date=December 2017|format=PDF|language=Serbian}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- \n!
