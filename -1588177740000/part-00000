The first and last control points are always the end points of the curve; however, the intermediate control points (if any) generally do not lie on the curve. The sums in the following sections are to be understood as [[Affine space#Affine combinations and barycenter|affine combinations]], the coefficients sum to 1.\n\n===Linear B\u00e9zier curves===\nGiven distinct points '''P'''<sub>0</sub> and '''P'''<sub>1</sub>, a linear B\u00e9zier curve is simply a [[straight line]] between those two points. The curve is given by\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{B}(t)=\\mathbf{P}_0 + t(\\mathbf{P}_1-\\mathbf{P}_0)=(1-t)\\mathbf{P}_0 + t\\mathbf{P}_1 \\mbox{ , } 0 \\le t \\le 1</math>\nand is equivalent to [[linear interpolation]].\n\n===Quadratic B\u00e9zier curves===\n[[File:Quadratic Beziers in string art.svg|thumb|upright|Quadratic B\u00e9ziers in [[string art]]: The end points ('''&bull;''') and control point ('''&times;''') define the quadratic B\u00e9zier curve ('''\u22ef''').]]\nA quadratic B\u00e9zier curve is the path traced by the function '''B'''(''t''), given points '''P'''<sub>0</sub>, '''P'''<sub>1</sub>, and '''P'''<sub>2</sub>,\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{B}(t) = (1 - t)[(1 - t) \\mathbf P_0 + t \\mathbf P_1] + t [(1 - t) \\mathbf P_1 + t \\mathbf P_2] \\mbox{ , } 0 \\le t \\le 1</math>,\n\nwhich can be interpreted as the linear interpolant of corresponding points on the linear B\u00e9zier curves from '''P'''<sub>0</sub> to '''P'''<sub>1</sub> and from '''P'''<sub>1</sub> to '''P'''<sub>2</sub> respectively.

We have\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{B}(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^n b_{i, n}(t)\\mathbf{P}_i,\\quad 0 \\le t \\le 1</math>\n\nwhere the polynomials\n\n:<math>b_{i,n}(t) = {n\\choose i} t^i (1 - t)^{n - i},\\quad i = 0, \\ldots, n</math>\n\nare known as [[Bernstein polynomial|Bernstein basis polynomials]] of degree ''n''.\n\nNote that ''t''<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, (1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''t'')<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, and that the [[binomial coefficient]], <math>\\scriptstyle {n \\choose i}</math>, is:\n\n:<math>{n \\choose i} = \\frac{n!}{i!(n - i)!}</math>\n\nThe points '''P'''<sub>''i''</sub> are called ''control points'' for the B\u00e9zier curve. The [[polygon]] formed by connecting the B\u00e9zier points with [[line (mathematics)|lines]], starting with '''P'''<sub>0</sub> and finishing with '''P'''<sub>''n''</sub>, is called the ''B\u00e9zier polygon'' (or ''control polygon''). The [[convex hull]] of the B\u00e9zier polygon contains the B\u00e9zier curve.\n\n===Polynomial form===\nSometimes it is desirable to express the B\u00e9zier curve as a [[polynomial]] instead of a sum of less straightforward [[Bernstein polynomial]]s. Application of the [[binomial theorem]] to the definition of the curve followed by some rearrangement will yield:\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{B}(t) = \\sum_{j = 0}^n {t^j \\mathbf{C}_j}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{C}_j = \\frac{n!}{(n - j)!} \\sum_{i = 0}^j \\frac{(-1)^{i + j} \\mathbf{P}_i}{i! (j - i)!} =\n\\prod_{m = 0}^{j - 1} (n - m) \\sum_{i = 0}^j \\frac{(-1)^{i + j} \\mathbf{P}_i}{i! (j - i)!}\n.</math>\n\nThis could be practical if <math>\\mathbf{C}_j</math> can be computed prior to many evaluations of <math>\\mathbf{B}(t)</math>; however one should use caution as high order curves may lack [[numeric stability]] ([[de Casteljau's algorithm]] should be used if this occurs). Note that the [[empty product]] is 1.\n\n===Properties===\n[[File:quadratic_to_cubic_Bezier_curve.svg|thumb|upright|A cubic B\u00e9zier curve (yellow) can be made identical to a quadratic one (black) by\n<div style=\"margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em\">1.

More generally, an ''n''-piece cubic B\u00e9zier curve can approximate a circle, when each inner control point is the distance <math>\\textstyle\\frac{4}{3}\\tan(t/4)</math> from an outer control point on a unit circle, where ''t'' is 360/''n'' degrees, and ''n'' > 2.\n* Every quadratic B\u00e9zier curve is also a cubic B\u00e9zier curve, and more generally, every degree ''n'' B\u00e9zier curve is also a degree ''m'' curve for any ''m'' > ''n''. In detail, a degree ''n'' curve with control points '''P'''<sub>0</sub>, ..., '''P'''<sub>''n''</sub> is equivalent (including the parametrization) to the degree ''n'' + 1 curve with control points '''P''''<sub>0</sub>, ..., '''P''''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>, where <math>\\mathbf P'_k=\\tfrac{k}{n+1}\\mathbf P_{k-1}+\\left(1-\\tfrac{k}{n+1}\\right)\\mathbf P_k</math>.\n* B\u00e9zier curves have the [[variation diminishing property]].

For curves with points and weights on a circle, the weights can be scaled without changing the curve's shape. <ref>{{ cite journal |author= J.

As the curve is completely contained in the [[convex hull]] of its [[Control point (mathematics)|control points]], the points can be graphically displayed and used to manipulate the curve intuitively. [[Affine transformation]]s such as [[translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[rotation]] can be applied on the curve by applying the respective transform on the control points of the curve.\n\n[[Quadratic function|Quadratic]] and [[Cubic function|cubic]] B\u00e9zier curves are most common. Higher degree curves are more [[computationally expensive]] to evaluate. When more complex shapes are needed, low order B\u00e9zier curves are patched together, producing a [[composite B\u00e9zier curve]]. A composite B\u00e9zier curve is commonly referred to as a \"path\" in [[vector graphics]] languages (like [[PostScript]]), vector graphics standards (like [[SVG]]) and vector graphics programs (like [[Artline (program)|Artline]]<!-- 1990 -->, [[Timeworks Publisher]]<!-- early 1990s -->, [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[CorelDraw]], [[Inkscape]], and [[Allegro (software library)|Allegro]]). In order to make composite B\u00e9zier curves appear smooth (which is generally desirable), it suffices to force the control point at which two constituent B\u00e9zier curves meet to lie on the line defined by the two control points on either side. This guarantees that the resulting curve is G1 continuous, meaning that the first derivative is continuous everywhere.\n\nThe simplest method for scan converting ([[Rasterisation|rasterizing]]) a B\u00e9zier curve is to evaluate it at many closely spaced points and scan convert the approximating sequence of line segments. However, this does not guarantee that the rasterized output looks sufficiently smooth, because the points may be spaced too far apart. Conversely it may generate too many points in areas where the curve is close to linear. A common adaptive method is recursive subdivision, in which a curve's control points are checked to see if the curve approximates a straight line to within a small tolerance. If not, the curve is subdivided parametrically into two segments, 0 \u2264 ''t'' \u2264 0.5 and 0.5 \u2264 ''t'' \u2264 1, and the same procedure is applied recursively to each half. There are also forward differencing methods, but great care must be taken to analyse error propagation.<ref name=\"Xuexiang\"/>\n\nAnalytical methods where a B\u00e9zier is intersected with each scan line involve finding roots of cubic polynomials (for cubic B\u00e9ziers) and dealing with multiple roots, so they are not often used in practice.<ref name=\"Xuexiang\">{{cite web |title=Complex Quadratic B\u00e9zier Curve on Unit Circle |author1=Xuexiang Li |last-author-amp=yes |author2=Junxiao Xue |publisher=School of Software, Zhengzhou University |location=Zhengzhou, China |url=https://www.atlantis-press.com/php/download_paper.php?id=12403}}</ref>\n\nThe rasterisation algorithm used in [[Metafont]] is based on discretising the curve, so that it is approximated by a sequence of \"[[rook (chess)|rook]] moves\" that are purely vertical or purely horizontal, along the pixel boundaries. To that end, the plane is first split into eight 45\u00b0 sectors (by the coordinate axes and the two lines <math> y = \\pm x </math>), then the curve is decomposed into smaller segments such that the ''direction'' of a curve segment stays within one sector; since the curve velocity is a second degree polynomial, finding the <math>t</math> values where it is parallel to one of these lines can be done by solving quadratic equations. Within each segment, either horizontal or vertical movement dominates, and the total number of steps in either direction can be read off from the endpoint coordinates; in for example the 0\u201345\u00b0 sector horizontal movement to the right dominates, so it only remains to decide between which steps to the right the curve should make a step up.<ref>Parts 19\u201322 of {{cite book |last1=Knuth |first1=Donald E. |author-link=Donald Knuth |title=Metafont: The Program |date=1986 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-201-13438-1}}</ref>\n\n===Animation===\nIn animation applications, such as [[Adobe Flash]] and [[Synfig]], B\u00e9zier curves are used to outline, for example, movement.

Other languages and imaging tools (such as [[PostScript]], [[Asymptote (vector graphics language)|Asymptote]], [[Metafont]], and [[SVG]]) use composite B\u00e9ziers composed of '''cubic''' B\u00e9zier curves for drawing curved shapes.

The exact splitting algorithm is implementation dependent, only the flatness criteria must be respected to reach the necessary precision and to avoid non-monotonic local changes of curvature. The \"smooth curve\" feature of charts in [[Microsoft Excel]] also uses this algorithm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xlrotor.com/resources/files.shtml |title=smooth_curve_bezier_example_file.xls |website=Rotating Machinery Analysis, Inc. |accessdate=2011-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718131613/http://www.xlrotor.com/resources/files.shtml |archivedate=2011-07-18 }}</ref>\n\nBecause arcs of circles and ellipses cannot be exactly represented by B\u00e9zier curves, they are first approximated by B\u00e9zier curves, which are in turn approximated by arcs of circles. This is inefficient as there exists also approximations of all B\u00e9zier curves using arcs of circles or ellipses, which can be rendered incrementally with arbitrary precision. Another approach, used by modern hardware graphics adapters with accelerated geometry, can convert exactly all B\u00e9zier and conic curves (or surfaces) into [[non-uniform rational B-spline|NURBS]], that can be rendered incrementally without first splitting the curve recursively to reach the necessary flatness condition. This approach also allows preserving the curve definition under all linear or perspective 2D and 3D transforms and projections.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nFont engines, like [[FreeType]], draw the font's curves (and lines) on a pixellated surface using a process known as [[font rasterization]].<ref name=freetype>{{cite web |title=FreeType Glyph Conventions / VI.

The first and last control points are always the end points of the curve; however, the intermediate control points (if any) generally do not lie on the curve. The sums in the following sections are to be understood as [[Affine space#Affine combinations and barycenter|affine combinations]], the coefficients sum to 1.\n\n===Linear B\u00e9zier curves===\nGiven distinct points '''P'''<sub>0</sub> and '''P'''<sub>1</sub>, a linear B\u00e9zier curve is simply a [[straight line]] between those two points. The curve is given by\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{B}(t)=\\mathbf{P}_0 + t(\\mathbf{P}_1-\\mathbf{P}_0)=(1-t)\\mathbf{P}_0 + t\\mathbf{P}_1 \\mbox{ , } 0 \\le t \\le 1</math>\nand is equivalent to [[linear interpolation]].\n\n===Quadratic B\u00e9zier curves===\n[[File:Quadratic Beziers in string art.svg|thumb|upright|Quadratic B\u00e9ziers in [[string art]]: The end points ('''&bull;''') and control point ('''&times;''') define the quadratic B\u00e9zier curve ('''\u22ef''').]]\nA quadratic B\u00e9zier curve is the path traced by the function '''B'''(''t''), given points '''P'''<sub>0</sub>, '''P'''<sub>1</sub>, and '''P'''<sub>2</sub>,\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{B}(t) = (1 - t)[(1 - t) \\mathbf P_0 + t \\mathbf P_1] + t [(1 - t) \\mathbf P_1 + t \\mathbf P_2] \\mbox{ , } 0 \\le t \\le 1</math>,\n\nwhich can be interpreted as the linear interpolant of corresponding points on the linear B\u00e9zier curves from '''P'''<sub>0</sub> to '''P'''<sub>1</sub> and from '''P'''<sub>1</sub> to '''P'''<sub>2</sub> respectively.

As ''t'' increases from 0 to 1, the curve departs from '''P'''<sub>0</sub> in the direction of '''P'''<sub>1</sub>, then bends to arrive at '''P'''<sub>2</sub> from the direction of '''P'''<sub>1</sub>.\n\nThe second derivative of the B\u00e9zier curve with respect to ''t'' is\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{B}''(t) = 2(\\mathbf{P}_2 - 2 \\mathbf{P}_1 + \\mathbf{P}_0) \\,.</math>\n\n===Cubic B\u00e9zier curves===\nFour points '''P'''<sub>0</sub>, '''P'''<sub>1</sub>, '''P'''<sub>2</sub> and '''P'''<sub>3</sub> in the plane or in higher-dimensional space define a cubic B\u00e9zier curve.\nThe curve starts at '''P'''<sub>0</sub> going toward '''P'''<sub>1</sub> and arrives at '''P'''<sub>3</sub> coming from the direction of '''P'''<sub>2</sub>. Usually, it will not pass through '''P'''<sub>1</sub> or '''P'''<sub>2</sub>; these points are only there to provide directional information.

We have\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{B}(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^n b_{i, n}(t)\\mathbf{P}_i,\\quad 0 \\le t \\le 1</math>\n\nwhere the polynomials\n\n:<math>b_{i,n}(t) = {n\\choose i} t^i (1 - t)^{n - i},\\quad i = 0, \\ldots, n</math>\n\nare known as [[Bernstein polynomial|Bernstein basis polynomials]] of degree ''n''.\n\nNote that ''t''<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, (1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''t'')<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, and that the [[binomial coefficient]], <math>\\scriptstyle {n \\choose i}</math>, is:\n\n:<math>{n \\choose i} = \\frac{n!}{i!(n - i)!}</math>\n\nThe points '''P'''<sub>''i''</sub> are called ''control points'' for the B\u00e9zier curve. The [[polygon]] formed by connecting the B\u00e9zier points with [[line (mathematics)|lines]], starting with '''P'''<sub>0</sub> and finishing with '''P'''<sub>''n''</sub>, is called the ''B\u00e9zier polygon'' (or ''control polygon''). The [[convex hull]] of the B\u00e9zier polygon contains the B\u00e9zier curve.\n\n===Polynomial form===\nSometimes it is desirable to express the B\u00e9zier curve as a [[polynomial]] instead of a sum of less straightforward [[Bernstein polynomial]]s. Application of the [[binomial theorem]] to the definition of the curve followed by some rearrangement will yield:\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{B}(t) = \\sum_{j = 0}^n {t^j \\mathbf{C}_j}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{C}_j = \\frac{n!}{(n - j)!} \\sum_{i = 0}^j \\frac{(-1)^{i + j} \\mathbf{P}_i}{i! (j - i)!} =\n\\prod_{m = 0}^{j - 1} (n - m) \\sum_{i = 0}^j \\frac{(-1)^{i + j} \\mathbf{P}_i}{i! (j - i)!}\n.</math>\n\nThis could be practical if <math>\\mathbf{C}_j</math> can be computed prior to many evaluations of <math>\\mathbf{B}(t)</math>; however one should use caution as high order curves may lack [[numeric stability]] ([[de Casteljau's algorithm]] should be used if this occurs). Note that the [[empty product]] is 1.\n\n===Properties===\n[[File:quadratic_to_cubic_Bezier_curve.svg|thumb|upright|A cubic B\u00e9zier curve (yellow) can be made identical to a quadratic one (black) by\n<div style=\"margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em\">1.

More generally, an ''n''-piece cubic B\u00e9zier curve can approximate a circle, when each inner control point is the distance <math>\\textstyle\\frac{4}{3}\\tan(t/4)</math> from an outer control point on a unit circle, where ''t'' is 360/''n'' degrees, and ''n'' > 2.\n* Every quadratic B\u00e9zier curve is also a cubic B\u00e9zier curve, and more generally, every degree ''n'' B\u00e9zier curve is also a degree ''m'' curve for any ''m'' > ''n''. In detail, a degree ''n'' curve with control points '''P'''<sub>0</sub>, ..., '''P'''<sub>''n''</sub> is equivalent (including the parametrization) to the degree ''n'' + 1 curve with control points '''P''''<sub>0</sub>, ..., '''P''''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>, where <math>\\mathbf P'_k=\\tfrac{k}{n+1}\\mathbf P_{k-1}+\\left(1-\\tfrac{k}{n+1}\\right)\\mathbf P_k</math>.\n* B\u00e9zier curves have the [[variation diminishing property]].

As the curve is completely contained in the [[convex hull]] of its [[Control point (mathematics)|control points]], the points can be graphically displayed and used to manipulate the curve intuitively. [[Affine transformation]]s such as [[translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[rotation]] can be applied on the curve by applying the respective transform on the control points of the curve.\n\n[[Quadratic function|Quadratic]] and [[Cubic function|cubic]] B\u00e9zier curves are most common. Higher degree curves are more [[computationally expensive]] to evaluate. When more complex shapes are needed, low order B\u00e9zier curves are patched together, producing a [[composite B\u00e9zier curve]]. A composite B\u00e9zier curve is commonly referred to as a \"path\" in [[vector graphics]] languages (like [[PostScript]]), vector graphics standards (like [[SVG]]) and vector graphics programs (like [[Artline (program)|Artline]]<!-- 1990 -->, [[Timeworks Publisher]]<!-- early 1990s -->, [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[CorelDraw]], [[Inkscape]], and [[Allegro (software library)|Allegro]]). In order to make composite B\u00e9zier curves appear smooth (which is generally desirable), it suffices to force the control point at which two constituent B\u00e9zier curves meet to lie on the line defined by the two control points on either side. This guarantees that the resultant curve is C1 continuous, meaning that the first derivative is continuous everywhere.\n\nThe simplest method for scan converting ([[Rasterisation|rasterizing]]) a B\u00e9zier curve is to evaluate it at many closely spaced points and scan convert the approximating sequence of line segments. However, this does not guarantee that the rasterized output looks sufficiently smooth, because the points may be spaced too far apart. Conversely it may generate too many points in areas where the curve is close to linear. A common adaptive method is recursive subdivision, in which a curve's control points are checked to see if the curve approximates a straight line to within a small tolerance. If not, the curve is subdivided parametrically into two segments, 0 \u2264 ''t'' \u2264 0.5 and 0.5 \u2264 ''t'' \u2264 1, and the same procedure is applied recursively to each half. There are also forward differencing methods, but great care must be taken to analyse error propagation.<ref name=\"Xuexiang\"/>\n\nAnalytical methods where a B\u00e9zier is intersected with each scan line involve finding roots of cubic polynomials (for cubic B\u00e9ziers) and dealing with multiple roots, so they are not often used in practice.<ref name=\"Xuexiang\">{{cite web |title=Complex Quadratic B\u00e9zier Curve on Unit Circle |author1=Xuexiang Li |last-author-amp=yes |author2=Junxiao Xue |publisher=School of Software, Zhengzhou University |location=Zhengzhou, China |url=https://www.atlantis-press.com/php/download_paper.php?id=12403}}</ref>\n\nThe rasterisation algorithm used in [[Metafont]] is based on discretising the curve, so that it is approximated by a sequence of \"[[rook (chess)|rook]] moves\" that are purely vertical or purely horizontal, along the pixel boundaries. To that end, the plane is first split into eight 45\u00b0 sectors (by the coordinate axes and the two lines <math> y = \\pm x </math>), then the curve is decomposed into smaller segments such that the ''direction'' of a curve segment stays within one sector; since the curve velocity is a second degree polynomial, finding the <math>t</math> values where it is parallel to one of these lines can be done by solving quadratic equations. Within each segment, either horizontal or vertical movement dominates, and the total number of steps in either direction can be read off from the endpoint coordinates; in for example the 0\u201345\u00b0 sector horizontal movement to the right dominates, so it only remains to decide between which steps to the right the curve should make a step up.<ref>Parts 19\u201322 of {{cite book |last1=Knuth |first1=Donald E. |author-link=Donald Knuth |title=Metafont: The Program |date=1986 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-201-13438-1}}</ref>\n\n===Animation===\nIn animation applications, such as [[Adobe Flash]] and [[Synfig]], B\u00e9zier curves are used to outline, for example, movement.

The exact splitting algorithm is implementation dependent, only the flatness criteria must be respected to reach the necessary precision and to avoid non-monotonic local changes of curvature.

This is inefficient as there exists also approximations of all B\u00e9zier curves using arcs of circles or ellipses, which can be rendered incrementally with arbitrary precision. Another approach, used by modern hardware graphics adapters with accelerated geometry, can convert exactly all B\u00e9zier and conic curves (or surfaces) into [[non-uniform rational B-spline|NURBS]], that can be rendered incrementally without first splitting the curve recursively to reach the necessary flatness condition. This approach also allows preserving the curve definition under all linear or perspective 2D and 3D transforms and projections.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nFont engines, like [[FreeType]], draw the font's curves (and lines) on a pixellated surface using a process known as [[font rasterization]].<ref name=freetype>{{cite web |title=FreeType Glyph Conventions / VI.

He starred in over 150 [[Malayalam film]]s. During his film career, he was primarily an action star and was particularly famous for his [[macho]] image and unique style. He was reputed for his chauvinistic appeal and well known for performing [[stunt]]s of a dangerous nature on his own.

Boys High School when he joined the [[Indian Navy]]. The first accolades for his acting skills reached him when he was a naval sailor. He used to act in plays at various functions such as anniversaries. The encouragement from his friends and colleagues in the Navy gave him the desire to act in films. Jayan served in the Indian Navy for 16 years, culminating in the rank of [[Master Chief Petty Officer|Master CPO]]. By the end of his navy days, he had begun efforts to start small businesses at [[Ernakulam]] and became a regular inhabitant of the Cochin Tourist Home. During his life at Ernakulam, he would meet some of his lifelong friends. It was such a chance meeting while on leave, with Rajan Prakash who is the veteran Malayalam actor [[Jose Prakash]]'s son, who owned a dry cleaning shop in Cochin, that eventually landed him a role in the movie ''Shapa Moksham''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://actorjayan.ning.com/photo/jayan20-1?context=latest |title=Ormapperukkangalil- Jose Prakash memoirs on Jayan |publisher=chithrabhoomi |date=10 November 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811032714/http://actorjayan.ning.com/photo/jayan20-1?context=latest |archive-date=11 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A year later, he left the Indian Navy and started trying his hand at various civilian jobs, working for companies in Cochin for a few years till his acting career began to succeed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://actorjayan.ning.com/photo/jayan21-1?context=latest |title=Ormapperukkangalil (2)- Jose Prakash memoirs on Jayan |publisher=chithrabhoomi |date=10 November 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811032846/http://actorjayan.ning.com/photo/jayan21-1?context=latest |archive-date=11 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Jayan's younger brother Soman Nair (Ajayan) also acted in 20+ films after Jayan's death.But he was not succeeded in films like Jayan.Ajayan has 3 children .His younger son Adithyan Jayan is a famous TV serial actor in Malayalam.\n\n===Film career===\n\n====Random appearances and early career====\nJayan did make a few random uncredited appearances in some movies of the early 1970s, the first of which was in ''Postmane Kanmanilla''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/Jayannewsclippingmemories.jpg |title=Actor Jayan in memories |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-04-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715081324/http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/Jayannewsclippingmemories.jpg |archive-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iho4gz1833I |title=Remembering Jayan on his anniversary |publisher=asianet |date= |accessdate=2011-04-16}}</ref> These minor appearances were before he attained the screen name Jayan.

Jayan started his career by acting in minor roles starting with ''Shapa Moksham'' (1974). Jayan got his first major break appearing as a villain in ''Panchami'' (1976), playing a forest ranger. Jayan's performance in this film was appreciated in the industry and his physical appearance was also noticed for the first time. His next notable role was in ''[[Thacholi Ambu]]'' (1978), in which he appeared in a supporting role. In the same year, he acted as a sage in the Sreekumaran Thampi film ''Etho Oru Swapnam'', which was well received by critics. But what made Jayan a superstar was his [[antihero]] role in ''[[Sharapancharam]]'' (1979, ''Bed of Arrows''). He catapulted to fame riding on [[machismo]] roles that endeared him to the masses, and he established himself as one of the most popular Malayalam film actors of his time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forumkeralam.com/malayalam-cinema/5931-jayan-film-festival-kairali-tv.html |title=Jayan The Immortal Superstar |publisher=forumkeralam.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711021334/http://www.forumkeralam.com/malayalam-cinema/5931-jayan-film-festival-kairali-tv.html |archive-date=11 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He is generally regarded as the first action hero in Malayalam cinema.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manoramaonline.com/advt/movie/jayan/index.htm |title=Nostalgia- Jayan Memories |publisher=manoramaonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metromatinee.com/artist/Jayan-329 |title=Metromatinee.com- Action Hero Jayan |publisher=metromatinee.com |accessdate=2011-01-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105053530/http://www.metromatinee.com/artist/Jayan-329 |archivedate=5 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n====Superstardom====\n''Sharapancharam'' broke all box-office records set in the Malayalam movie industry till it's time and became the highest grossing movie of 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianterminal.com/forum/first-cut-first-show/53038-highest-grossed-malayalam-movies-from-1980-to-2009-must-see.html |title=List of highest grossing films |publisher=indianterminal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}</ref>\nIt's box-office records were broken by another Jayan film, ''Angadi'' (Market) in the following year, which cemented his popularity among the masses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianterminal.com/forum/first-cut-first-show/53038-highest-grossed-malayalam-movies-from-1980-to-2009-must-see.html |title=List of yearwise top grossers in malayalam |publisher=indianterminal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}</ref> In films such as ''Manushya Mrugam'', ''Aavesham'' etc. he played double roles. During his career, he received only a few critically appreciated roles perhaps partly due to his commercial hero image and partly due to the lack of films that garnered critical appreciation at the time. The focus was always on his unmatched drawing power as an action star and by 1980, at the peak of his career, he had attained a genuine superhero image. Movies exploited Jayan's masculine physique and he appeared bare-chested in numerous scenes. His on-screen attire (most famously his [[Elvis]] [[bellbottoms]]), his masculine image and later the nature of his death transformed him into a [[legend]] in Kerala. Jayan was also known for his unique method of dialogue delivery and he has contributed many memorable lines to the Malayalam film history.\n\n====Multistar films====\nJayan acted in several [[ensemble cast|multistar]] movies, mostly with [[Prem Nazir]]. The duo acted in films such as ''Nayattu, Love in Singapore, Chandrahasam, [[Thacholi Ambu]], [[Kannappanunni]], Palattu Kunjikkannan, Mamangam, Prabhu'' etc. all of which were top grossing movies at the box office. He also acted with other popular actors of the time, such as [[M. G. Soman|Soman]], [[Sukumaran]] and [[Madhu (actor)|Madhu]] in many films. In early films before 1979 (e.g. ''Thacholi Ambu'' and ''Panchami''), he had negative or supporting roles. But later films in the beginning of 1980 relied heavily on Jayan's drawing power as an action hero and placed him as the central character. In 1980, the duo Jayan and Prem Nazir were cast in ''Ariyapedatha Rahasiyam'' by [[P. Venu]], that showcased the famous fight scene in Malayalam cinema. Prem Nazir agreed to play a supporting role in ''Nayattu'', which was very unlikely for a superstar of those times. He had agreed to do this as a token of friendship with Jayan and the director Sreekumaran Thamby. The duo had many actions films together such as ''Irumbazhikal'', ''Love in Singapore'' etc. where the box office draw was huge.\n\n==Death==\n[[Image:JayanHelicopterStunt.jpg|right|thumb|This picture was taken seconds before his death]]\nOn 16 November 1980, Jayan died in an accident on the set of the movie ''[[Kolilakkam]]'' (English: ''Shockwave''). The climactic scene of the movie was being filmed in [[Sholavaram]], near [[Madras]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. Jayan always performed his own stunts, and for this movie he was performing a particularly dangerous stunt that involved him boarding an airborne helicopter from a moving motorbike. The shot was accepted by the director in the first take; altogether three shots were filmed.\n\nAccording to the film's production executive, Jayan insisted on yet another re-take as he was not satisfied with its perfection. During the re-take, the helicopter lost its balance and crashed along with Jayan who was hanging onto the landing skids, and he later succumbed to his injuries.\n\n[[File:JayanLastViewCrowd.jpg|right|thumb|A snap of the huge crowd assembled at [[Quilon]] city to see Jayan on his cremation]]\nAfter his death was confirmed, a slide was added during the theatre show of his movie ''Deepam'', which was running in packed houses, informing viewers of his death.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manoramaonline.com/advt/movie/jayan_special/index.htm |title=Jayan- A Golden Memory |publisher=Manoramaonline |date=16 November 2009 |accessdate=2011-06-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118151435/http://www.manoramaonline.com/advt/movie/jayan_special/index.htm |archive-date=18 November 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A large number of his fans burst into tears and ran out of the buildings, while many continued to watch the movie, refusing to believe it and taking it for an ingenious promotion for some upcoming project.<ref name=\"MW 211111\"/>\n\nJayan's body was taken to [[Trivandrum]] via [[aeroplane]] and later it was taken to his home in [[Quilon]], where he was cremated. Thousands paid homage to the late actor, and the police had to take huge measures to deal with the crowds. His mother Bharathiyamma became bedridden after this incident, and she too died two years later.\n\nSome [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] emerged regarding the circumstances of his death, primarily because the pilot and his co-star [[Balan K. Nair]], who was in the helicopter, survived with minor or no injuries. Nevertheless, it has been confirmed as a genuine accident.\n\n==The Aftermath==\n[[File:JayanCitizenWatch.jpg|right|thumb|The Citizen watch that Jayan had used during the shoot of the film ''Kolilakkam'']]\nAfter Jayan's death, several films were released claiming to be his last film, including the genuine one, ''Kolilakkam''. In all these films, Jayan's voice was dubbed by Aleppey Ashraf, a popular [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressionist]] of the time. Many projects meant for him were recast, such as ''Thusharam'' by I.V. Sasi, P.G. Vishwambaran's ''Sphodanam,'' and Sasi Kumar's ''Dhruva Sangamam''. Numerous other projects were cancelled entirely. One stunt scene and two songs were already shot with Jayan for C.V. Hariharans ''Garjanam'', but after his death, it was recast with [[Rajinikanth]], becoming his second film in Malayalam released in 1981.\n\n===Imposter Movement===\nDue to his unrivalled popularity that continued many years after his death, random bit scenes were added to numerous films that showed random gestures or shots of him walking by the side during fight scenes. Attempts were made to bring in impostors who tried to imitate his style and mannerisms, enabling several artists from the field of mimicry to show up on the big screen. But these experiments failed miserably, and proved especially ineffective in fight and stunt scenes. Then, directors and producers started a search for new actors to replace him. This movement led to debuts of actors who resembled Jayan in physical appearance (e.g. [[Ratheesh]]), those with stage names sounding similar to his (for example, his own brother who appeared as Ajayan), and those with similar mannerisms and style (e.g. [[Bheeman Raghu]]).<ref>Mathrubhumi weekly, 21 November 2010, Page 24</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2002/12/24/stories/2002122405970400.htm |title=Actor Ratheesh dead |publisher=The Hindu |date=24 December 2002 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}</ref> One of them, [[Mammootty]], who started with the stage name [[Sajin]], would later go on to become one of the popular future stars in the industry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://actorjayan.ning.com/photo/jayan87-1?context=latest |title=Chamayangalode (4)- Sajin and Jayan's throne |publisher=ning.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811032938/http://actorjayan.ning.com/photo/jayan87-1?context=latest |archive-date=11 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHowever, all these attempts to replace Jayan with a new star with a similar image yielded disappointing results. It is now one of the most popular quotes in Malayalam cinema \"Jayan's throne remains vacant and will forever be so\".\n\n===Resurgence in the 2000s===\nIn the late 1990s and early 21st century, there was a resurgence of Jayan's screen persona in [[Kerala]] and his old movie scenes came to prominence again.<ref>{{citation|title=Because I have a voice|author=Arvind Narrain & Gautam Bhan|publisher=Yoda Press|year=2005|isbn=81-902272-2-X|pages=75, 85, 87}}</ref> It was owed mostly to programs by popular [[mimicry]] stage artists in the State, whose imitations of the star's mannerisms caught on and soon became commonplace in college stage events, television programs and mimicry stage shows along with quotes of superhuman strength known as [[Jayan quotes]]. However, it has been pointed out that many grotesquely imitated screen dialogues of Jayan are not actually his, but that of dubbing artist Aleppey Ashraf, who dubbed for many of his characters after his death.\n\nThe \"comeback\" of Jayan and his renewed popularity lately may be taken as an affirmation that Jayan has not been replaced even nearly three decades after his death. Today, Jayan is best remembered as the first and best action star of Malayalam cinema, so far, besides his trademark colourful attire, risky stunts, machismo mannerisms and unique speaking style. He has rightly won immortality in the hearts of the Malayalam film fans as a martyr in his yearning to thrill and entertain them even by putting his life at stake. [[Madhu (actor)|Madhu]], a famous actor prominent in the 1960s, once stated in an interview: \"Jayan will forever be young and alive. No one can ever visualise him as an old man.\"\n\nA film titled ''Avatharam'' presently under production, is attempting to bring back his screen persona using advanced technologies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hindu.com/2011/01/18/stories/2011011851360200.htm |title=The Hindu Report-Action star Jayan to reappear in movie |publisher=hindu.com |date= 18 January 2011|accessdate=2011-01-19 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://flashnewstoday.com/index.php/late-jayan-returns-to-silver-screen/ |title=Jayans returns to silver screen |publisher=flashnewstoday.com |date=24 January 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}</ref> A documentary on Jayan's life and death ''Jayan \u2013 The Man behind the Legend'' is nearing completion for release in the near future.\n\n==Legacy==\nJayan is perhaps the only actor thus far in the history of Malayalam film industry who remains a marketable superstar decades after his demise, to this day. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://english.manoramaonline.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/2019/11/16/actor-jayan-malayalam-movies-action-hero-dress-circle.html |title=Jayan's memories live on though Malayalam cinema lost its first action hero four decades ago |publisher= Onmanorama.com |date= |accessdate=2019-11-17}}</ref> In the state of Kerala, he is a true icon of popular culture, whose life and image has made him a legend over time.\n\nMurali Jayan has claimed to be actor Jayan's son and has been legally asking for a DNA test.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Superhero image and commercial success===\nThrough his machismo roles and staggering stunt feats, Jayan had attained a real-life Superhero image amongst the fans, masses and colleagues alike.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/Jayannewsclippingmemories.jpg |title=Ormakalile Jayan |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715081324/http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/Jayannewsclippingmemories.jpg |archive-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His colourful attire and unique bass voice also helped him capture the imagination of the average viewer as the manly action hero.

The years 1979, 1980 and 1981 became known as \"Jayan years\" in the industry due to the widespread release and success of his movies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/jnote0052.jpg |title=Ethiralikal illatha supertharam |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715081329/http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/jnote0052.jpg |archive-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His films ''Sharapancharam'' and ''Angadi'', released in 1979 and 1980 respectively, were record breakers and became the highest grossers of their respective years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianterminal.com/forum/first-cut-first-show/53038-highest-grossed-malayalam-movies-from-1980-to-2009-must-see.html |title=Highest grossing malayalam films |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-17}}</ref> His final film, ''Kolilakkam'' was the highest grosser in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianterminal.com/forum/first-cut-first-show/53038-highest-grossed-malayalam-movies-from-1980-to-2009-must-see.html |title=List of top-grossing malayalam films year-wise list |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-17}}</ref> The noteworthy point is that a large percentage of films released during his peak years lacked a strong plot and were mostly cheap low budget remakes of successful movies from other language sectors of Indian cinema. Many of these films came out astoundingly successful due to his sheer presence and some avoided failures due to his small cameo appearances.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/JayanFilms.jpg |title=The Superstar of Superstars |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715081335/http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/JayanFilms.jpg |archive-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Thousands of fans used to visit theatres repeatedly just to see his fascinating stunts and fight scenes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/RavikumaronJayan.jpg |title=Heartthrob of millions-Ravikumar remembers Jayan |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715081341/http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/RavikumaronJayan.jpg |archive-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Daredevilry===\nJayan was a high-risk taker and throughout his career, he was popular for stellar performances in a fight and stunt sequences. Dangerous and thrilling stunts were often featured in action films with Jayan in the lead. These were usually highlighted during fight scenes as added promotions to his machismo image and daredevilry. Numerous movies in which he has acted have one or more notable stunt performances.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/jnote0052-1.jpg |title=Dhurantha Nakshathram |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715081314/http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/jnote0052-1.jpg |archive-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[Image:TheShipCraneStunt.jpg|left|thumbnail|The famed ship crane stunt in the film ''Chandrahasam'']]\nA few prominent examples may be ''Puthiya Velicham'' (\"New Light\", 1979) in which he performs train stunts jumping onto and from a fast-running goods train, ''Aavesham'' (\"Inspiration\", 1979) which shows the actor swimming through the dangerous waters of [[Hogenakkal Falls]], through a major part of the climax sequence without using any kind of safety measures. Movies like ''Thadavara'' (\"Prison\", 1981) and ''Sharapancharam'' (1979) demonstrate his brilliant horse riding skills performing almost effortlessly on horseback, while films like ''Mamangam'' involved dangerous fights with wild animals. In a film called ''Moorkhan'' (\"Cobra\", 1981) he broke through a brick wall riding on a motorbike (a Royal Enfield Bullet) and it also featured sequences that had the actor sliding along ropes tied at high elevations. Perhaps the most famous movie stunt featuring Jayan came in ''Chandrahasam'' (\"Moonsword\", 1980) in which he held on to the UV clamp of a massive ship crane and was elevated to a height of around 200 feet before jumping off to the top of the vessel. In one of his final stunt scenes, in ''Ariyappedatha Rahasyam'' (\"Secret never known\", 1981) he was involved in a fight scene with an elephant.\n\n==Influence on Malayalam cinema==\nThe meteoric rise of Jayan had literally a texture changing impact on the Malayalam film industry. It changed forever the hero concept that existed previously for many years and gave rise to a new genre of film characters with more manly characteristics.\n\n===Memorable roles===\nMost critics often consider Jayan's main hero role in ''Sharapancharam'', ''Angadi'', ''Venalil Oru Mazha'' and ''Puthiya Velicham'' to be his best. His most popular character may be the educated labourer in ''Angadi''. The sage's role played by him in ''Etho Oru Swapnam'' was well appreciated by critics and would easily feature among his most memorable roles. The supporting role in ''Kannappanunni'', Thacholi Ambu, the villainous ranger in ''Panchami'' and the rapist in ''Kanthavalayam'' are also critically acclaimed characters. Some other popular roles were in films like ''Ithikkara Pakki'', ''Mamangam'', ''Puthiya Velicham'', ''Karimpana'', ''Ariyapedatha Rahasiyam'', ''Chaakara'' and ''[[Kazhukan]]''. While acknowledging his undisputed popularity as a commercial superstar that has never faded over time, general critical opinion on his skills as an actor is divided.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/Jayanarticlebydirector.jpg |title=Jayan sammanicha vismayangal |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715081309/http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/Jayanarticlebydirector.jpg |archive-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> While there are criticisms from some corners that he depended more on his features such as his catching physique, bass voice, personal charisma, unique style and mannerisms to garner attention, many others rate him as a great actor who developed his own unique style to leave a lasting impression on every single role he took up. The fact that his peak time as an actor lasted only a few years is often pointed out in reply to criticisms, and considering the short period of his active film career, he may have delivered more critically appreciated performances than most of his contemporaries. But these were always under the shadow of a large majority of films that were able to achieve commercial success capitalising on his drawing power, but had weak plots and less critical acclaim. Some believe that if he'd had a longer career, he would have eventually transformed into a great character actor over time who could excel in commercial and parallel streams alike, after a period of decline in Malayalam films that followed [[Sathyaneshan Nadar|Sathyan]]'s demise. His most popular films like ''Sharapancharam'' and ''Angadi'' were both critical and commercial successes. Though he is remembered as an icon of commercial cinema, due to the short span of his career and the generic nature of commercial hero roles of the time, his actual acting talents may have been largely underutilised.\n\n===Song sequences===\nFilm songs are an integral part of Indian cinema and the same is true for Malayalam films. Jayan has acted in several memorable song sequences which bring about nostalgic memories about the actor. Song sequences in Jayan films also helped shape the future film song sector in commercial cinema. The song \"Kannum Kannum\" in the film ''Angadi'' presents one of the most popular song sequences in Malayalam cinema involving Jayan and Seema. Its success led to the teaming together of this pair in numerous movies. Another popular song involving the Jayan-Seema pair is \"Kasthuri Manmizhi\" from the movie ''Manushya Mrugam''. A song that hit tremendous popularity was \"Cham Chacha Chum Chacha\" in ''Love in Singapore'' and Kombil Kilukkam ketti in \"Karimpana\". The mass popularity of this song sequence later inspired a whole new category of film songs with lyrics that lack any particular meaning, but with a fast beat and dance appeal that came to be known as \"Adipoli\" songs. There is a song in the film ''Etho Oru Swapnam'' called \"Oru Mugham Mathram Kannil\", which became popular due to its melodious and nostalgic nature.\n\"Ezham Malika Mele\" from Sarppam, directed by Baby was a superhit song paired by Jayan and Seema. Another hit from this team was \"Pournami Penne: in Arifa hassan's ''Benz Vasu'' and it was hummed by the youth of that time.\n\n==Memorials==\nThere is a Jayan memorial Arts & Sports club functioning at Thevally near the actor's hometown. The residential area at his birthplace has been renamed \"Olayil Jayan Nagar\" in his honour.....\n\nAttingal ajayan And  Vimal Venu peringome create so many short films and documentaries about JAYAN...\n\n===Jayan Cultural Forum===\n''Jayan Samskarika Vethi'' or Jayan Cultural Forum has been established recently, which consists of his fans and well wishers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldmalayalamcinema.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/poovachal-khader-conferred-the-ragamalika-jayan-award/ |title=Ragamalika Jayan Award for Poovachal Khader|publisher=Wordpress|date=15 November 2010 |accessdate=2011-05-07}}</ref> It is headed by the actor's nephew Kannan Nair, and aims at uniting his diverse fan base consisting of young and old people from several generations under a single platform.

Efforts are being made to construct a permanent memorial at Mulankadakam where he was cremated, and also to open a library and museum near his home.\n\n==In media==\n\n===Media on Jayan===\n* A book titled ''Jayan Americayil?'' (Jayan in America?) came out in 1981 and had record sales at the time. It circulated the rumour that Jayan was alive in America with an injured eye and that it was a look-alike who was killed in the accident.\n* Another book ''Jayante Maranam Kolapathakamo'' (Jayan's death, a murder) was also published in 1981, capitalising on the conspiracy theories and mystery surrounding the superstar's death.\n* The actor's life was serialised in a Malayalam film magazine and then brought out as ''Jayante Katha''.\n* An elaborate biography named ''Jayan : Abhralokathintey Ithihasa Naayakan'' is being completed and will reportedly be published in 2011.{{update after|2011|12|31}}\n* A documentary ''Jayan-The Man behind the Legend'' is under production and is set to be released in 2011.{{update after|2011|12|31}}\n\n===In popular culture===\n\n====Print media====\n* The actor's domination and commercial success in the 1970s is mentioned in the book ''Because I have a Voice''. It focuses on Jayan's masculine image.\n* Jayan's famous emotional English dialogue in street slang is included at number 7 in Outlook magazine's Terrific 13 lists published in the 13th anniversary edition of the magazine, in the section '13 Cheesiest Chalkiest dialogues in Indian Cinema'.\n\n====Films====\n* In the movie ''Aye Auto'', there is a reference to Jayan's English dialogue in ''Angadi''.\n* The movies ''Dupe Dupe Dupe'' and ''Aparanmar Nagarathil'' had Jayan impersonators in the lead.\n* In the film ''Pattanathil Bhootham'', the popular Jayan song sequence ''Cham Chacha Chumchacha'' is played out with impersonation. The horse oiling scene from ''Sharapancharam'' is also reconstructed.\n* In ''Chotta Mumbai'', a Jayan-Nazir mixed song sequence is played out with Jayan attire used in the song sequence of the popular Nazir song ''Chettikulangara''.\n* In the film ''Shikkar'', Jayan's image is used in the sets of a fight scene in a bid to stress the adventurous setting of the film.\n* In ''Thanthonni'', Jayan's voice and dialogue tone is imitated.\n* The film ''Valiyangadi'' was promoted as a sequel to Jayan's ''Angadi''.\n* In the film ''[[Ennu Ninte Moideen]]'', Jayan's stunt sequence and the celebrated row with \"Alavalathi Shaji\" from the film ''[[Lisa (1978 film)]]' is shown in a theatre scene. \n* The famous song \"Kannum Kannum\" from Jayan's film ''Angadi'' is included with Mammooty impersonating Jayan's style in the film ''Venicele Vyapari''.\n* The recent hit ''Kattapanayile Hruthik Roshan'' has the actor Siddique acting as an ardent fan of Jayan and impersonates his style for seeing his movies.\n\n====Return to the silver screen====\nIn December 2010, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of his death, it was announced that a new movie with Jayan in the lead is in the works, using advanced animation and graphics technologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frames.mathrubhumi.com/movies/malayalam/153194/ |title=Mathrubhumi-Avatharam to have Jayan in the lead |publisher=mathrubhumi.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-18}}</ref> The movie, titled ''Avatharam'' (Incarnation), was announced to be directed by [[Vijeesh Mani]] and scripted by T.

He starred in over 150 [[Malayalam film]]s. During his film career, he was primarily an action star and was particularly famous for his [[macho]] image and unique style. He was reputed for his chauvinistic appeal and well known for performing [[stunt]]s of a dangerous nature on his own. By the late 1970s, he became the most popular [[lead actor]] and [[bankable star]] of [[Malayalam cinema]] and has been acclaimed as the first [[action hero]] of Malayalam cinema.<ref>Mathrubhumi weekly, 2010 November 21 issue, Page 9</ref>\n\nHis superhuman image has also transformed him into an iconic figure of popular culture among [[Malayali]]s around the world, with widespread impersonations on stage and television programs based on his screen persona. It was accompanied by a cartoon, email and SMS phenomenon in the early 2000s, portraying him as a comic superhero with [[Jayan quotes|unique quotes]] of superhuman strength attributed to the action star becoming widespread.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ekerala.net/r.php?url=http://www.hackorama.com/jayan/quotes.shtml&title=jayan |title=Those unmistakable Jayan dialogues |publisher=ekerala.net |date= |accessdate=2011-01-19 }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ekerala.net/r.php?url=http://www.ananthapuri.com/board/topic.asp?topic_id=94&title=jayan |title=Jayan jokes and quotes |publisher=ananthapuri.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-19 }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> These movements were fuelled by a renewed fascination with his style of dialogue delivery and his machismo image.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WpvBKWze3U |title=Typical Jayan dialogue |publisher=asianet |date= |accessdate=2011-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9dMEh3bNs |title=Immortal Action Hero Jayan in his typical role. |publisher=Saina |date= |accessdate=2011-02-04}}</ref> These were claimed to honour his memories, but were also criticised for parodying the legendary actor years after his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2006/07/02/stories/2006070202300200.htm |title=Reminiscing about Jayan and his ways |publisher=The Hindu |date=2 July 2006 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}</ref><ref name=\"MW 211111\">Mathrubhumi weekly, 21 November 2010, Page 10</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early life===\n\nJayan was born in [[Quilon]], [[Travancore]] as the first child of his father Thevalli, Kottaram Veetil Madhavan Pillai and mother Bharathiyamma.

Boys High School when he joined the [[Indian Navy]]. The first accolades for his acting skills reached him when he was a naval sailor. He used to act in plays at various functions such as anniversaries. The encouragement from his friends and colleagues in the Navy gave him the desire to act in films. Jayan served in the Indian Navy for 16 years, culminating in the rank of [[Master Chief Petty Officer|Master CPO]]. By the end of his navy days, he had begun efforts to start small businesses at [[Ernakulam]] and became a regular inhabitant of the Cochin Tourist Home. During his life at Ernakulam, he would meet some of his lifelong friends. It was such a chance meeting while on leave, with Rajan Prakash who is the veteran Malayalam actor [[Jose Prakash]]'s son, who owned a dry cleaning shop in Cochin, that eventually landed him a role in the movie ''Shapa Moksham''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://actorjayan.ning.com/photo/jayan20-1?context=latest |title=Ormapperukkangalil- Jose Prakash memoirs on Jayan |publisher=chithrabhoomi |date=10 November 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811032714/http://actorjayan.ning.com/photo/jayan20-1?context=latest |archive-date=11 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A year later, he left the Indian Navy and started trying his hand at various civilian jobs, working for companies in Cochin for a few years till his acting career began to succeed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://actorjayan.ning.com/photo/jayan21-1?context=latest |title=Ormapperukkangalil (2)- Jose Prakash memoirs on Jayan |publisher=chithrabhoomi |date=10 November 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811032846/http://actorjayan.ning.com/photo/jayan21-1?context=latest |archive-date=11 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Jayan's younger brother Soman Nair (Ajayan) also acted in 20+ films after Jayan's death.But he was not succeeded in films like Jayan.Ajayan has 3 children .His younger son Adithyan Jayan is a famous TV serial actor in Malayalam.\n\n===Film career===\n\n====Random appearances and early career====\nJayan did make a few random uncredited appearances in some movies of the early 1970s, the first of which was in ''Postmane Kanmanilla''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/Jayannewsclippingmemories.jpg |title=Actor Jayan in memories |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-04-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715081324/http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/Jayannewsclippingmemories.jpg |archive-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iho4gz1833I |title=Remembering Jayan on his anniversary |publisher=asianet |date= |accessdate=2011-04-16}}</ref> These minor appearances were before he attained the screen name Jayan.

Jayan started his career by acting in minor roles starting with ''Shapa Moksham'' (1974). Jayan got his first major break appearing as a villain in ''Panchami'' (1976), playing a forest ranger. Jayan's performance in this film was appreciated in the industry and his physical appearance was also noticed for the first time. His next notable role was in ''[[Thacholi Ambu]]'' (1978), in which he appeared in a supporting role. In the same year, he acted as a sage in the Sreekumaran Thampi film ''Etho Oru Swapnam'', which was well received by critics. But what made Jayan a superstar was his [[antihero]] role in ''[[Sharapancharam]]'' (1979, ''Bed of Arrows''). He catapulted to fame riding on [[machismo]] roles that endeared him to the masses, and he established himself as one of the most popular Malayalam film actors of his time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forumkeralam.com/malayalam-cinema/5931-jayan-film-festival-kairali-tv.html |title=Jayan The Immortal Superstar |publisher=forumkeralam.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711021334/http://www.forumkeralam.com/malayalam-cinema/5931-jayan-film-festival-kairali-tv.html |archive-date=11 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He is generally regarded as the first action hero in Malayalam cinema.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manoramaonline.com/advt/movie/jayan/index.htm |title=Nostalgia- Jayan Memories |publisher=manoramaonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metromatinee.com/artist/Jayan-329 |title=Metromatinee.com- Action Hero Jayan |publisher=metromatinee.com |accessdate=2011-01-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105053530/http://www.metromatinee.com/artist/Jayan-329 |archivedate=5 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n====Superstardom====\n''Sharapancharam'' broke all box-office records set in the Malayalam movie industry till it's time and became the highest grossing movie of 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianterminal.com/forum/first-cut-first-show/53038-highest-grossed-malayalam-movies-from-1980-to-2009-must-see.html |title=List of highest grossing films |publisher=indianterminal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}</ref>\nIt's box-office records were broken by another Jayan film, ''Angadi'' (Market) in the following year, which cemented his popularity among the masses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianterminal.com/forum/first-cut-first-show/53038-highest-grossed-malayalam-movies-from-1980-to-2009-must-see.html |title=List of yearwise top grossers in malayalam |publisher=indianterminal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}</ref> In films such as ''Manushya Mrugam'', ''Aavesham'' etc. he played double roles. During his career, he received only a few critically appreciated roles perhaps partly due to his commercial hero image and partly due to the lack of films that garnered critical appreciation at the time. The focus was always on his unmatched drawing power as an action star and by 1980, at the peak of his career, he had attained a genuine superhero image. Movies exploited Jayan's masculine physique and he appeared bare-chested in numerous scenes. His on-screen attire (most famously his [[Elvis]] [[bellbottoms]]), his masculine image and later the nature of his death transformed him into a [[legend]] in Kerala. Jayan was also known for his unique method of dialogue delivery and he has contributed many memorable lines to the Malayalam film history.\n\n====Multistar films====\nJayan acted in several [[ensemble cast|multistar]] movies, mostly with [[Prem Nazir]]. The duo acted in films such as ''Nayattu, Love in Singapore, Chandrahasam, [[Thacholi Ambu]], [[Kannappanunni]], Palattu Kunjikkannan, Mamangam, Prabhu'' etc. all of which were top grossing movies at the box office. He also acted with other popular actors of the time, such as [[M. G. Soman|Soman]], [[Sukumaran]] and [[Madhu (actor)|Madhu]] in many films. In early films before 1979 (e.g. ''Thacholi Ambu'' and ''Panchami''), he had negative or supporting roles. But later films in the beginning of 1980 relied heavily on Jayan's drawing power as an action hero and placed him as the central character. In 1980, the duo Jayan and Prem Nazir were cast in ''Ariyapedatha Rahasiyam'' by [[P. Venu]], that showcased the famous fight scene in Malayalam cinema. Prem Nazir agreed to play a supporting role in ''Nayattu'', which was very unlikely for a superstar of those times. He had agreed to do this as a token of friendship with Jayan and the director Sreekumaran Thamby. The duo had many actions films together such as ''Irumbazhikal'', ''Love in Singapore'' etc. where the box office draw was huge.\n\n==Death==\n[[Image:JayanHelicopterStunt.jpg|right|thumb|This picture was taken seconds before his death]]\nOn 16 November 1980, Jayan died in an accident on the set of the movie ''[[Kolilakkam]]'' (English: ''Shockwave''). The climactic scene of the movie was being filmed in [[Sholavaram]], near [[Madras]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. Jayan always performed his own stunts, and for this movie he was performing a particularly dangerous stunt that involved him boarding an airborne helicopter from a moving motorbike. The shot was accepted by the director in the first take; altogether three shots were filmed.\n\nAccording to the film's production executive, Jayan insisted on yet another re-take as he was not satisfied with its perfection. During the re-take, the helicopter lost its balance and crashed along with Jayan who was hanging onto the landing skids, and he later succumbed to his injuries.\n\n[[File:JayanLastViewCrowd.jpg|right|thumb|A snap of the huge crowd assembled at [[Quilon]] city to see Jayan on his cremation]]\nAfter his death was confirmed, a slide was added during the theatre show of his movie ''Deepam'', which was running in packed houses, informing viewers of his death.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manoramaonline.com/advt/movie/jayan_special/index.htm |title=Jayan- A Golden Memory |publisher=Manoramaonline |date=16 November 2009 |accessdate=2011-06-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118151435/http://www.manoramaonline.com/advt/movie/jayan_special/index.htm |archive-date=18 November 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A large number of his fans burst into tears and ran out of the buildings, while many continued to watch the movie, refusing to believe it and taking it for an ingenious promotion for some upcoming project.<ref name=\"MW 211111\"/>\n\nJayan's body was taken to [[Trivandrum]] via [[aeroplane]] and later it was taken to his home in [[Quilon]], where he was cremated. Thousands paid homage to the late actor, and the police had to take huge measures to deal with the crowds. His mother Bharathiyamma became bedridden after this incident, and she too died two years later.\n\nSome [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] emerged regarding the circumstances of his death, primarily because the pilot and his co-star [[Balan K. Nair]], who was in the helicopter, survived with minor or no injuries. Nevertheless, it has been confirmed as a genuine accident.\n\n==The Aftermath==\n[[File:JayanCitizenWatch.jpg|right|thumb|The Citizen watch that Jayan had used during the shoot of the film ''Kolilakkam'']]\nAfter Jayan's death, several films were released claiming to be his last film, including the genuine one, ''Kolilakkam''. In all these films, Jayan's voice was dubbed by Aleppey Ashraf, a popular [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressionist]] of the time. Many projects meant for him were recast, such as ''Thusharam'' by I.V. Sasi, P.G. Vishwambaran's ''Sphodanam,'' and Sasi Kumar's ''Dhruva Sangamam''. Numerous other projects were cancelled entirely. One stunt scene and two songs were already shot with Jayan for C.V. Hariharans ''Garjanam'', but after his death, it was recast with [[Rajinikanth]], becoming his second film in Malayalam released in 1981.\n\n===Imposter Movement===\nDue to his unrivalled popularity that continued many years after his death, random bit scenes were added to numerous films that showed random gestures or shots of him walking by the side during fight scenes. Attempts were made to bring in impostors who tried to imitate his style and mannerisms, enabling several artists from the field of mimicry to show up on the big screen. But these experiments failed miserably, and proved especially ineffective in fight and stunt scenes. Then, directors and producers started a search for new actors to replace him. This movement led to debuts of actors who resembled Jayan in physical appearance (e.g. [[Ratheesh]]), those with stage names sounding similar to his (for example, his own brother who appeared as Ajayan), and those with similar mannerisms and style (e.g. [[Bheeman Raghu]]).<ref>Mathrubhumi weekly, 21 November 2010, Page 24</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2002/12/24/stories/2002122405970400.htm |title=Actor Ratheesh dead |publisher=The Hindu |date=24 December 2002 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}</ref> One of them, [[Mammootty]], who started with the stage name [[Sajin]], would later go on to become one of the popular future stars in the industry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://actorjayan.ning.com/photo/jayan87-1?context=latest |title=Chamayangalode (4)- Sajin and Jayan's throne |publisher=ning.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811032938/http://actorjayan.ning.com/photo/jayan87-1?context=latest |archive-date=11 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHowever, all these attempts to replace Jayan with a new star with a similar image yielded disappointing results. It is now one of the most popular quotes in Malayalam cinema \"Jayan's throne remains vacant and will forever be so\".\n\n===Resurgence in the 2000s===\nIn the late 1990s and early 21st century, there was a resurgence of Jayan's screen persona in [[Kerala]] and his old movie scenes came to prominence again.<ref>{{citation|title=Because I have a voice|author=Arvind Narrain & Gautam Bhan|publisher=Yoda Press|year=2005|isbn=81-902272-2-X|pages=75, 85, 87}}</ref> It was owed mostly to programs by popular [[mimicry]] stage artists in the State, whose imitations of the star's mannerisms caught on and soon became commonplace in college stage events, television programs and mimicry stage shows along with quotes of superhuman strength known as [[Jayan quotes]]. However, it has been pointed out that many grotesquely imitated screen dialogues of Jayan are not actually his, but that of dubbing artist Aleppey Ashraf, who dubbed for many of his characters after his death.\n\nThe \"comeback\" of Jayan and his renewed popularity lately may be taken as an affirmation that Jayan has not been replaced even nearly three decades after his death. Today, Jayan is best remembered as the first and best action star of Malayalam cinema, so far, besides his trademark colourful attire, risky stunts, machismo mannerisms and unique speaking style. He has rightly won immortality in the hearts of the Malayalam film fans as a martyr in his yearning to thrill and entertain them even by putting his life at stake. [[Madhu (actor)|Madhu]], a famous actor prominent in the 1960s, once stated in an interview: \"Jayan will forever be young and alive. No one can ever visualise him as an old man.\"\n\nA film titled ''Avatharam'' presently under production, is attempting to bring back his screen persona using advanced technologies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hindu.com/2011/01/18/stories/2011011851360200.htm |title=The Hindu Report-Action star Jayan to reappear in movie |publisher=hindu.com |date= 18 January 2011|accessdate=2011-01-19 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://flashnewstoday.com/index.php/late-jayan-returns-to-silver-screen/ |title=Jayans returns to silver screen |publisher=flashnewstoday.com |date=24 January 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}</ref> A documentary on Jayan's life and death ''Jayan \u2013 The Man behind the Legend'' is nearing completion for release in the near future.\n\n==Legacy==\nJayan is perhaps the only actor thus far in the history of Malayalam film industry who remains a marketable superstar decades after his demise, to this day. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://english.manoramaonline.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/2019/11/16/actor-jayan-malayalam-movies-action-hero-dress-circle.html |title=Jayan's memories live on though Malayalam cinema lost its first action hero four decades ago |publisher= Onmanorama.com |date= |accessdate=2019-11-17}}</ref> In the state of Kerala, he is a true icon of popular culture, whose life and image has made him a legend over time.\n\nMurali Jayan has claimed to be actor Jayan's son and has been legally asking for a DNA test.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Superhero image and commercial success===\nThrough his machismo roles and staggering stunt feats, Jayan had attained a real-life Superhero image amongst the fans, masses and colleagues alike.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/Jayannewsclippingmemories.jpg |title=Ormakalile Jayan |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715081324/http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/Jayannewsclippingmemories.jpg |archive-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His colourful attire and unique bass voice also helped him capture the imagination of the average viewer as the manly action hero.

The years 1979, 1980 and 1981 became known as \"Jayan years\" in the industry due to the widespread release and success of his movies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/jnote0052.jpg |title=Ethiralikal illatha supertharam |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715081329/http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/jnote0052.jpg |archive-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His films ''Sharapancharam'' and ''Angadi'', released in 1979 and 1980 respectively, were record breakers and became the highest grossers of their respective years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianterminal.com/forum/first-cut-first-show/53038-highest-grossed-malayalam-movies-from-1980-to-2009-must-see.html |title=Highest grossing malayalam films |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-17}}</ref> His final film, ''Kolilakkam'' was the highest grosser in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianterminal.com/forum/first-cut-first-show/53038-highest-grossed-malayalam-movies-from-1980-to-2009-must-see.html |title=List of top-grossing malayalam films year-wise list |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-17}}</ref> The noteworthy point is that a large percentage of films released during his peak years lacked a strong plot and were mostly cheap low budget remakes of successful movies from other language sectors of Indian cinema.

Dangerous and thrilling stunts were often featured in action films with Jayan in the lead. These were usually highlighted during fight scenes as added promotions to his machismo image and daredevilry. Numerous movies in which he has acted have one or more notable stunt performances.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/jnote0052-1.jpg |title=Dhurantha Nakshathram |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715081314/http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/jnote0052-1.jpg |archive-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[Image:TheShipCraneStunt.jpg|left|thumbnail|The famed ship crane stunt in the film ''Chandrahasam'']]\nA few prominent examples may be ''Puthiya Velicham'' (\"New Light\", 1979) in which he performs train stunts jumping onto and from a fast-running goods train, ''Aavesham'' (\"Inspiration\", 1979) which shows the actor swimming through the dangerous waters of [[Hogenakkal Falls]], through a major part of the climax sequence without using any kind of safety measures. Movies like ''Thadavara'' (\"Prison\", 1981) and ''Sharapancharam'' (1979) demonstrate his brilliant horse riding skills performing almost effortlessly on horseback, while films like ''Mamangam'' involved dangerous fights with wild animals. In a film called ''Moorkhan'' (\"Cobra\", 1981) he broke through a brick wall riding on a motorbike (a Royal Enfield Bullet) and it also featured sequences that had the actor sliding along ropes tied at high elevations. Perhaps the most famous movie stunt featuring Jayan came in ''Chandrahasam'' (\"Moonsword\", 1980) in which he held on to the UV clamp of a massive ship crane and was elevated to a height of around 200 feet before jumping off to the top of the vessel. In one of his final stunt scenes, in ''Ariyappedatha Rahasyam'' (\"Secret never known\", 1981) he was involved in a fight scene with an elephant.\n\n==Influence on Malayalam cinema==\nThe meteoric rise of Jayan had literally a texture changing impact on the Malayalam film industry. It changed forever the hero concept that existed previously for many years and gave rise to a new genre of film characters with more manly characteristics.\n\n===Memorable roles===\nMost critics often consider Jayan's main hero role in ''Sharapancharam'', ''Angadi'', ''Venalil Oru Mazha'' and ''Puthiya Velicham'' to be his best. His most popular character may be the educated labourer in ''Angadi''. The sage's role played by him in ''Etho Oru Swapnam'' was well appreciated by critics and would easily feature among his most memorable roles. The supporting role in ''Kannappanunni'', Thacholi Ambu, the villainous ranger in ''Panchami'' and the rapist in ''Kanthavalayam'' are also critically acclaimed characters. Some other popular roles were in films like ''Ithikkara Pakki'', ''Mamangam'', ''Puthiya Velicham'', ''Karimpana'', ''Ariyapedatha Rahasiyam'', ''Chaakara'' and ''[[Kazhukan]]''. While acknowledging his undisputed popularity as a commercial superstar that has never faded over time, general critical opinion on his skills as an actor is divided.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/Jayanarticlebydirector.jpg |title=Jayan sammanicha vismayangal |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715081309/http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/Jayanarticlebydirector.jpg |archive-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> While there are criticisms from some corners that he depended more on his features such as his catching physique, bass voice, personal charisma, unique style and mannerisms to garner attention, many others rate him as a great actor who developed his own unique style to leave a lasting impression on every single role he took up. The fact that his peak time as an actor lasted only a few years is often pointed out in reply to criticisms, and considering the short period of his active film career, he may have delivered more critically appreciated performances than most of his contemporaries. But these were always under the shadow of a large majority of films that were able to achieve commercial success capitalising on his drawing power, but had weak plots and less critical acclaim. Some believe that if he'd had a longer career, he would have eventually transformed into a great character actor over time who could excel in commercial and parallel streams alike, after a period of decline in Malayalam films that followed [[Sathyaneshan Nadar|Sathyan]]'s demise. His most popular films like ''Sharapancharam'' and ''Angadi'' were both critical and commercial successes. Though he is remembered as an icon of commercial cinema, due to the short span of his career and the generic nature of commercial hero roles of the time, his actual acting talents may have been largely underutilised.\n\n===Song sequences===\nFilm songs are an integral part of Indian cinema and the same is true for Malayalam films. Jayan has acted in several memorable song sequences which bring about nostalgic memories about the actor. Song sequences in Jayan films also helped shape the future film song sector in commercial cinema. The song \"Kannum Kannum\" in the film ''Angadi'' presents one of the most popular song sequences in Malayalam cinema involving Jayan and Seema. Its success led to the teaming together of this pair in numerous movies. Another popular song involving the Jayan-Seema pair is \"Kasthuri Manmizhi\" from the movie ''Manushya Mrugam''. A song that hit tremendous popularity was \"Cham Chacha Chum Chacha\" in ''Love in Singapore'' and Kombil Kilukkam ketti in \"Karimpana\". The mass popularity of this song sequence later inspired a whole new category of film songs with lyrics that lack any particular meaning, but with a fast beat and dance appeal that came to be known as \"Adipoli\" songs. There is a song in the film ''Etho Oru Swapnam'' called \"Oru Mugham Mathram Kannil\", which became popular due to its melodious and nostalgic nature.\n\"Ezham Malika Mele\" from Sarppam, directed by Baby was a superhit song paired by Jayan and Seema. Another hit from this team was \"Pournami Penne: in Arifa hassan's ''Benz Vasu'' and it was hummed by the youth of that time.\n\n==Memorials==\nThere is a Jayan memorial Arts & Sports club functioning at Thevally near the actor's hometown. The residential area at his birthplace has been renamed \"Olayil Jayan Nagar\" in his honour.....\n\nAttingal ajayan And  Vimal Venu peringome create so many short films and documentaries about JAYAN...\n\n===Jayan Cultural Forum===\n''Jayan Samskarika Vethi'' or Jayan Cultural Forum has been established recently, which consists of his fans and well wishers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldmalayalamcinema.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/poovachal-khader-conferred-the-ragamalika-jayan-award/ |title=Ragamalika Jayan Award for Poovachal Khader|publisher=Wordpress|date=15 November 2010 |accessdate=2011-05-07}}</ref> It is headed by the actor's nephew Kannan Nair, and aims at uniting his diverse fan base consisting of young and old people from several generations under a single platform.

It circulated the rumour that Jayan was alive in America with an injured eye and that it was a look-alike who was killed in the accident.\n* Another book ''Jayante Maranam Kolapathakamo'' (Jayan's death, a murder) was also published in 1981, capitalising on the conspiracy theories and mystery surrounding the superstar's death.\n* The actor's life was serialised in a Malayalam film magazine and then brought out as ''Jayante Katha''.\n* An elaborate biography named ''Jayan : Abhralokathintey Ithihasa Naayakan'' is being completed and will reportedly be published in 2011.{{update after|2011|12|31}}\n* A documentary ''Jayan-The Man behind the Legend'' is under production and is set to be released in 2011.{{update after|2011|12|31}}\n\n===In popular culture===\n\n====Print media====\n* The actor's domination and commercial success in the 1970s is mentioned in the book ''Because I have a Voice''. It focuses on Jayan's masculine image.\n* Jayan's famous emotional English dialogue in street slang is included at number 7 in Outlook magazine's Terrific 13 lists published in the 13th anniversary edition of the magazine, in the section '13 Cheesiest Chalkiest dialogues in Indian Cinema'.\n\n====Films====\n* In the movie ''Aye Auto'', there is a reference to Jayan's English dialogue in ''Angadi''.\n* The movies ''Dupe Dupe Dupe'' and ''Aparanmar Nagarathil'' had Jayan impersonators in the lead.\n* In the film ''Pattanathil Bhootham'', the popular Jayan song sequence ''Cham Chacha Chumchacha'' is played out with impersonation. The horse oiling scene from ''Sharapancharam'' is also reconstructed.\n* In ''Chotta Mumbai'', a Jayan-Nazir mixed song sequence is played out with Jayan attire used in the song sequence of the popular Nazir song ''Chettikulangara''.\n* In the film ''Shikkar'', Jayan's image is used in the sets of a fight scene in a bid to stress the adventurous setting of the film.\n* In ''Thanthonni'', Jayan's voice and dialogue tone is imitated.\n* The film ''Valiyangadi'' was promoted as a sequel to Jayan's ''Angadi''.\n* In the film ''[[Ennu Ninte Moideen]]'', Jayan's stunt sequence and the celebrated row with \"Alavalathi Shaji\" from the film ''[[Lisa (1978 film)]]' is shown in a theatre scene. \n* The famous song \"Kannum Kannum\" from Jayan's film ''Angadi'' is included with Mammooty impersonating Jayan's style in the film ''Venicele Vyapari''.\n* The recent hit ''Kattapanayile Hruthik Roshan'' has the actor Siddique acting as an ardent fan of Jayan and impersonates his style for seeing his movies.\n\n====Return to the silver screen====\nIn December 2010, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of his death, it was announced that a new movie with Jayan in the lead is in the works, using advanced animation and graphics technologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frames.mathrubhumi.com/movies/malayalam/153194/ |title=Mathrubhumi-Avatharam to have Jayan in the lead |publisher=mathrubhumi.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-18}}</ref> The movie, titled ''Avatharam'' (Incarnation), was announced to be directed by [[Vijeesh Mani]] and scripted by T.

In the series, which is set on the planet Gunsmoke, Vash is the most feared outlaw who has earned a bounty of [[Fictional currency|$$]]60 billion (\"double dollar\") and the nickname {{nihongo|\"The Humanoid Typhoon\"|\u4eba\u9593\u53f0\u98a8}} after accidentally destroying a city with his supernatural powers. He is a skilled gunman who battles bounty hunters as well as assassins working for his twin brother, [[Millions Knives]]. Despite his reputation, Vash displays a kindhearted personality by refusing to murder his enemies and by befriending civilians.  \n\nNightow created Vash as a strong gunner who would stand out because of his [[pacifist]] ways, traits that are different from those of the stereotypical protagonist of action films. Vash's designs primarily feature a red coat and blond hair. The manga was adapted for television as an [[anime]] series in which Vash was voiced by [[Masaya Onosaka]] as an adult and [[K\u014dki Miyata]] as a child. For the English dub, [[Johnny Yong Bosch]] voices him as an adult and [[Bryce Papenbrook]] as a child. The character also appears in the 2010 film ''[[Trigun: Badlands Rumble]]'' among other [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]]. Nightow was surprised at Vash's popularity with Western audiences. \n\nCritics praised the mixture of seriousness and goofiness of Vash's character. However, his pacifism received a more mixed response; while some reviewers praised it as a part of Vash's heroic traits, others disliked the negative consequences when his pacifist choices failed. He remained popular in the anime adaptation, and has appeared in multiple \"best character\" lists and articles. Onosaka and Bosch were praised for their performances, though critics favored Onosaka.\n\n== Concept and creation ==\n[[File:Yasuhiro Nightow 20110630 Japan Expo 1.jpg|thumb|left|Yasuhiro Nightow created Vash the Stampede.|alt=A black haired Japanese man wearing glasses.]]\n\nVash was created by ''[[Trigun]]'' [[manga]] author [[Yasuhiro Nightow]] who aimed to give him a serious personality with a childish side.

As a result, Vash avoids killing enemies' thanks to his skills with different fireweapons by disarming his enemies or avoiding mortal wounds. Vash's cheerful personality was made to keep this trait, with his catchphrase being: \"Hey, sorry. Love and peace?\". In order to make Vash a strong fighter, Nightow gave him an eyesight good enough for him to face gun fighters.<ref name=\"name\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ramenparados.com/12th-japan-expo-entrevista-yasuhiro/|title=[12th Japan Expo] Entrevista a Yasuhiro Nightow|publisher=Ramen Para Dos|language=Spanish|accessdate=March 8, 2020|date=July 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424005617/http://ramenparados.com/12th-japan-expo-entrevista-yasuhiro/|archive-date=April 24, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> While making the series, Nightow was surprised by Vash's popularity with Western readers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://international.ucla.edu/institute/article/110449|title=Anime Expo 2009: interview with Yasuhiro Nightow and Satoshi Nishimura|publisher=UCLA|accessdate=March 11, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200212214256/https://international.ucla.edu/institute/article/110449|archive-date=February 12, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Comparing Vash's manga characterization with his [[anime]] persona, Nightow said in the manga Vash does not have as many crushes on the women he meets.<ref name=\"sumire\">{{cite web|title=Puff Magazine Interview|website=[[Yahoo!

However, he could not reveal the reason for this to the fanbase. During the series' climax, Vash's blond hair would become completely black as a secondary effect of overusing his supernatural powers in the story. Despite his efforts in his design, Nightow regrets giving Vash and antagonist [[Legato Bluesummers]] detailed eyes because he drew them inconsistently in the manga.<ref name=\"dark\"/> \n\nNightow said the making of Vash's gun was a major problem because it had to look dangerous and reliable, but also visually attractive. In the gun's original design, there was no way of opening it to insert bullets so Nightow instead used a picture of an upside-down [[Gun barrel|barrel]] as inspiration.

In the series, which is set on the planet Gunsmoke, Vash is the most feared outlaw who has earned a bounty of [[Fictional currency|$$]]60 billion (\"double dollar\") and the nickname {{nihongo|\"The Humanoid Typhoon\"|\u4eba\u9593\u53f0\u98a8}} after accidentally destroying a city with his supernatural powers. He is a skilled gunman who battles bounty hunters as well as assassins working for his twin brother, [[Millions Knives]]. Despite his reputation, Vash displays a kindhearted personality by refusing to murder his enemies and by befriending civilians.  \n\nNightow created Vash as a strong gunner who would stand out because of his [[pacifist]] ways, traits that are different from those of the stereotypical protagonist of action films. Vash's designs primarily feature a red coat and blond hair. The manga was adapted for television as an [[anime]] series in which Vash was voiced by [[Masaya Onosaka]] as an adult and [[K\u014dki Miyata]] as a child. For the English dub, [[Johnny Yong Bosch]] voices him as an adult and [[Bryce Papenbrook]] as a child. The character also appears in the 2010 film ''[[Trigun: Badlands Rumble]]'' among other [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]]. Nightow was surprised at Vash's popularity with Western audiences. \n\nCritics praised the mixture of seriousness and goofiness of Vash's character. However, his pacifism received a more mixed response; while some reviewers praised it as a part of Vash's heroic traits, others disliked the negative consequences when his pacifist choices failed. He remained popular in the anime adaptation, and has appeared in multiple \"best character\" lists and articles. Onosaka and Bosch were praised for their performances, though critics favored Onosaka.\n\n== Concept and creation ==\n[[File:Yasuhiro Nightow 20110630 Japan Expo 1.jpg|thumb|left|Yasuhiro Nightow created Vash the Stampede.|alt=A black haired Japanese man wearing glasses.]]\n\nVash was created by ''[[Trigun]]'' [[manga]] author [[Yasuhiro Nightow]] who aimed to give him a serious personality with a childish side.

In 1914, [[Rosa A.

Gonz\u00e1lez authored two books related to her field in which she denounced the discrimination against women and nurses in Puerto Rico.

Gonzale's publication convinced [[James R. Beverly]], the Interim Governor of Puerto Rico, to sign Ley 77 (Law 77) in May 1930. The law established a Nurses Examining Board responsible for setting and enforcing standards of nursing education and practices. It also stipulated that the Board of Medical Examiners include two nurses.

Since a large portion of the male population of the U.S. was sent to war, there was a sudden need of manpower to fulfill the jobs left behind. Puerto Ricans, both male and female, found themselves employed in factories and ship docks, producing both domestic and warfare goods. The new migrants gained the knowledge and working skills that became useful even after the war had ended. For the first time the military also provided a steady source of income for women.<ref name=\"PR Women\"/><ref>\"LAS WACS\"-Participacion de la Mujer Boricua en la Seginda Guerra Mundial; by: Carmen Garcia Rosado; page 60; 1ra.

One of the things that most of the migrants had in common was that they wanted a better way of life than was available in Puerto Rico and although each held personal reasons for migrating their decision generally was rooted in the island's impoverished conditions as well as the public policies that sanctioned migration.\n\n====Impact in the U.S. educational system====\n\nMany Puerto Rican women have made important contributions to the educational system in the United States. Some contributed in the field of education, another was responsible in ending ''[[de jure]]'' segregation in the United States. Yet, another educator made the ultimate sacrifice and gave her life for her students.\n\nOne of the migrants was Dr. [[Antonia Pantoja]]. Pantoja's was an educator, social worker, feminist, civil rights leader, founder of the Puerto Rican Forum, [[Boricua College]], ''Producer'' and founder of ''[[ASPIRA]]''. ''ASPIRA'' (Spanish for \"aspire\") is a non-profit organization that promoted a positive self-image, commitment to community, and education as a value as part of the ASPIRA Process to Puerto Rican and other Latino youth in New York City. In 1996, President [[Bill Clinton]] presented Dr. Pantoja with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], making her the first Puerto Rican woman to receive this honor.<ref name=\"OF\">[http://www.aspira.org/manuals/our-founder-dra-antonia-pantoja \"Our Founder\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724201903/http://www.aspira.org/manuals/our-founder-dra-antonia-pantoja |date=July 24, 2013 }}, retrieved October 3, 2013</ref><ref name=\"LU\">[http://www.nl.edu/academics/cas/ace/resources/antoniapantoja.cfm Louis University]</ref><ref name=\"NASW\">[http://www.socialworkers.org/diversity/ethnic/pantoja.asp NASW] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003053844/http://www.socialworkers.org/diversity/ethnic/pantoja.asp |date=October 3, 2013 }} retrieved, October 3, 2013</ref>\n\nAnother Puerto Rican woman whose actions had an impact on the educational system of the United States was [[Felicitas Mendez]] (maiden name: Gomez).

In 1914, [[Rosa A.

Gonz\u00e1lez authored two books related to her field in which she denounced the discrimination against women and nurses in Puerto Rico.

Gonzale's publication convinced [[James R. Beverly]], the Interim Governor of Puerto Rico, to sign Ley 77 (Law 77) in May 1930. The law established a Nurses Examining Board responsible for setting and enforcing standards of nursing education and practices. It also stipulated that the Board of Medical Examiners include two nurses.

Since a large portion of the male population of the U.S. was sent to war, there was a sudden need of manpower to fulfill the jobs left behind. Puerto Ricans, both male and female, found themselves employed in factories and ship docks, producing both domestic and warfare goods. The new migrants gained the knowledge and working skills that became useful even after the war had ended. For the first time the military also provided a steady source of income for women.<ref name=\"PR Women\"/><ref>\"LAS WACS\"-Participacion de la Mujer Boricua en la Seginda Guerra Mundial; by: Carmen Garcia Rosado; page 60; 1ra.

One of the things that most of the migrants had in common was that they wanted a better way of life than was available in Puerto Rico and although each held personal reasons for migrating their decision generally was rooted in the island's impoverished conditions as well as the public policies that sanctioned migration.\n\n====Impact in the U.S. educational system====\n\nMany Puerto Rican women have made important contributions to the educational system in the United States. Some contributed in the field of education, another was responsible in ending ''[[de jure]]'' segregation in the United States. Yet, another educator made the ultimate sacrifice and gave her life for her students.\n\nOne of the migrants was Dr. [[Antonia Pantoja]]. Pantoja's was an educator, social worker, feminist, civil rights leader, founder of the Puerto Rican Forum, [[Boricua College]], ''Producer'' and founder of ''[[ASPIRA]]''. ''ASPIRA'' (Spanish for \"aspire\") is a non-profit organization that promoted a positive self-image, commitment to community, and education as a value as part of the ASPIRA Process to Puerto Rican and other Latino youth in New York City. In 1996, President [[Bill Clinton]] presented Dr. Pantoja with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], making her the first Puerto Rican woman to receive this honor.<ref name=\"OF\">[http://www.aspira.org/manuals/our-founder-dra-antonia-pantoja \"Our Founder\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724201903/http://www.aspira.org/manuals/our-founder-dra-antonia-pantoja |date=July 24, 2013 }}, retrieved October 3, 2013</ref><ref name=\"LU\">[http://www.nl.edu/academics/cas/ace/resources/antoniapantoja.cfm Louis University]</ref><ref name=\"NASW\">[http://www.socialworkers.org/diversity/ethnic/pantoja.asp NASW] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003053844/http://www.socialworkers.org/diversity/ethnic/pantoja.asp |date=October 3, 2013 }} retrieved, October 3, 2013</ref>\n\nAnother Puerto Rican woman whose actions had an impact on the educational system of the United States was [[Felicitas Mendez]] (maiden name: Gomez).

McInnes said that the Proud Boys was a \"drinking club [he] started several years ago as a joke\". Despite the formality of the letter, in a podcast on 4 January 2019, McInnes called the neighbours \"assholes\", described their behaviour as \"cunty\" and said \"If you have that sign on your lawn, you\u2019re a fucking retard.\"<ref name=lawnsigns />\n\nOne Larchmont resident said about McInnes: \"I don't care what Gavin says, I've done my research ...

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

This was the sixth-ever PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the [[2009 swine flu pandemic]].

A UN Crisis Management Team was activated as a result, allowing coordination of the entire United Nations response, which the WHO states will allow them to \"focus on the health response while the other agencies can bring their expertise to bear on the wider social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak\".<ref name=\"AutoDW-191\" />\n\nOn 25 February, the WHO declared that \"the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic,\" stating that while it was still too early to call it a pandemic, countries should nonetheless be \"in a phase of preparedness\".<ref name=\"AutoDW-193\" />\n\nOn 28 February, WHO officials said the coronavirus threat assessment at the global level would be raised from \"high\" to \"very high\", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.

This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready,\" urging that the right response measures could help the world avoid \"the worst of it\".

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
