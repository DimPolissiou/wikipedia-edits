Its initial name was UDMC Seafood Centre, which was later changed in 2000 to its current name. Popularized for housing several major local seafood restaurants, the seafood centre serves local favourites such as [[chilli crab]], [[black pepper crab]] and [[mee goreng]]. In 2005, the Seafood Centre was upgraded to give it a modernised look, and better facilities. Many of the features were revamped, and a number of old tenants vacated for new tenants to take their place.\n\nPlans for the seafood centre were first announced in July 1977, with five seafood restaurants from Upper East Coast Road.<ref name=\":1\"/> The owners of the restaurants were initially unhappy with the offer to move, citing reduced seating and patronage at the new site.<ref>{{cite news |title=Move to E.

For these restaurants, the business was generally better than at their old premises, with restaurant owners noting increased takings, and their patrons were also satisfied with the\nnew location. However, there was also much unhappiness among restaurant owners and customers over the inconvenience of the seafood centre.<ref name=\":4\"/> In 1990, renovations were carried out at the restaurants. That same year, all the restaurants at the centre were fined, while two, Golden Lagoon and Jumbo, were suspended for two weeks for violations of health regulations, such as poor hygiene practices. Nevertheless, business did not seem to be affected, with a Straits Times reporter noting that they still drew large crowds in the evening.<ref name=\":9\"/>\n\nThrough the rest of the 1980s and 1990s, the restaurants at the centre did generally well, and many tourists patronised them. However, by 2015, customer numbers had decreased considerably, with those at Red House Seafood falling by 35 percent in the two years prior. In March 2015, Red House Seafood closed, with a landscaped lawn taking its place, and with their leases having expired, two other restaurants, No Signboard Seafood and Fisherman's Village, also closed.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\n===Marine Cove===\n[[File:Marine Cove, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Marine Cove]]\nMarine Cove (formerly known as the East Coast Recreation Centre), is a building complex in Area C at East Coast Park where in the past, many [[caf\u00e9]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s were located.

He did this to facilitate the import of scrap metal from the Americans who were engaged in the Vietnam war at the time. It was built in the reclaimed land of East Coast under the East Coast reclamation. It was used by [[Singapore Armed Forces]] in 1975 to receive the refugees after the surrender of Saigon to the North Vietnamese forces. An SAF Field Hospital was deployed to Bedok Jetty to provide first aid and other essential medical services to all Singapore bound refugee boats fleeing South Vietnam following the [[Fall of Saigon]] in 1975.\n\nIn the 1980s, the jetty became popular among fishing enthusiasts. However, by 1988, the jetty was in a poor state, with The Straits Times noting its corroded railings and cracked support beams. In March that year, the Public Works Department closed the jetty for a $1.1 million facelift, consisting of repairs to the jetty's deck and supports.<ref>{{cite news |title=$1m facelift for Bedok's favourite fishing spot |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19880223-1.2.24.17 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=23 February 1988 |accessdate=12 November 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=10 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:View of Bedok Jetty from East Coast Park, Singapore - 20101120.jpg|thumb|View of Bedok Jetty from East Coast Park]]\n\n===Siglap Canal===\nLocated near Area C4, a new lawn and lookout deck in East Coast Park was opened to provide visitors with an additional area for recreational activities as well as a community space.

Tenders for the restaurants were called in February 1985.<ref>{{cite news |title=New $5.4 m haunt for seafood lovers |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19850223-1.2.24.16 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=23 February 1985 |accessdate=1 November 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=9 }}</ref>\n\nAfter renovations, the first six restaurants at the seafood centre opened for business in October 1985. For these restaurants, the business was generally better than at their old premises, with restaurant owners noting increased takings, and their patrons were also satisfied with the\nnew location. However, there was also much unhappiness among restaurant owners and customers over the inconvenience of the seafood centre.<ref name=\":4\"/> In 1990, renovations were carried out at the restaurants. That same year, all the restaurants at the centre were fined, while two, Golden Lagoon and Jumbo, were suspended for two weeks for violations of health regulations, such as poor hygiene practices. Nevertheless, business did not seem to be affected, with a Straits Times reporter noting that they still drew large crowds in the evening.<ref name=\":9\"/>\n\nThrough the rest of the 1980s and 1990s, the restaurants at the centre did generally well, and many tourists patronised them. However, by 2015, customer numbers had decreased considerably, with those at Red House Seafood falling by 35 percent in the two years prior. In March 2015, Red House Seafood closed, with a landscaped lawn taking its place, and with their leases having expired, two other restaurants, No Signboard Seafood and Fisherman's Village, also closed.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\n===Marine Cove===\n[[File:Marine Cove, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Marine Cove]]\nMarine Cove (formerly known as the East Coast Recreation Centre), is a building complex in Area C at East Coast Park where in the past, many [[caf\u00e9]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s were located. It also used to have a [[bowling alley]] and a [[billiards]] saloon.\n\nConstruction of the East Coast Recreation Centre began in April 1980, and it was completed in early 1982 at a cost of $3.5 million. Touted by its developer to have something for each member of the family, <ref>{{cite news |title=East Coast centre for recreation coming up |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/biztimes19800119-1.2.54 |work=Business Times |location=Singapore |date=19 January 1980 |accessdate=15 October 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=12 }}</ref> it featured a computer library offering computer classes, a music school, an amusement room with video games, restaurants and sports facilities.<ref name=\":3\"/> Initially, due to insufficient available parking spaces, an additional car park was initially opened on a grass verge, and a permanent car park was eventually built.<ref>{{cite news |title=Where the grass is greener |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19821104-1.2.48 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=4 November 1982 |accessdate=15 October 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=10 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, as part of the new E-zone theme park, the complex underwent an eight-month renovation in 1996. Among the changes were the construction of a room and a building to house [[Sega]] gaming machines. With the renovation, all tenants but McDonalds' moved out.<ref name=\":A\"/>\n\nThe location was sold to Rock Productions, New Creation Church's business arm, in 2002, and it was subsequently renamed Marine Cove. With the land handed back to NParks in 2011, the area was closed for redevelopment the following year.<ref name=\":5\"/> The new Marine Cove featuring a greater variety of dining options and a 3,500sqm children's playground at the redeveloped facility, reopened on 28 June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marine Cove at East Coast Park to reopen end-June|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/marine-cove-at-east-coast/2900694.html}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|title = 2 new developments to offer visitors more recreational options at East Coast park|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/2-new-developments-to-offer-visitors-more-recreational-options-at-east-coast|website = The Straits Times|access-date = 2016-01-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716011727/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/2-new-developments-to-offer-visitors-more-recreational-options-at-east-coast |archive-date=16 July 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Bedok Jetty===\n'''Bedok Jetty''' is the longest fishing jetty (250 m) in [[Singapore]]. It is located in [https://web.archive.org/web/20120330094954/http://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/images/park_images/ECP_MAP_E_F.JPG Area F] of East Coast Park.\n\nIt is the most popular jetty for fishing in Singapore, but it is also frequented by cyclists, rollerbladers, joggers or park visitors since it is a part of East Coast Park.\n\nBedok Jetty was originally built by a local businessman Mr Yap Swee Hong at a cost of $1.5m in 1966. He did this to facilitate the import of scrap metal from the Americans who were engaged in the Vietnam war at the time. It was built in the reclaimed land of East Coast under the East Coast reclamation. It was used by [[Singapore Armed Forces]] in 1975 to receive the refugees after the surrender of Saigon to the North Vietnamese forces. An SAF Field Hospital was deployed to Bedok Jetty to provide first aid and other essential medical services to all Singapore bound refugee boats fleeing South Vietnam following the [[Fall of Saigon]] in 1975.\n\nIn the 1980s, the jetty became popular among fishing enthusiasts. However, by 1988, the jetty was in a poor state, with The Straits Times noting its corroded railings and cracked support beams. In March that year, the Public Works Department closed the jetty for a $1.1 million facelift, consisting of repairs to the jetty's deck and supports.<ref>{{cite news |title=$1m facelift for Bedok's favourite fishing spot |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19880223-1.2.24.17 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=23 February 1988 |accessdate=12 November 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=10 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:View of Bedok Jetty from East Coast Park, Singapore - 20101120.jpg|thumb|View of Bedok Jetty from East Coast Park]]\n\n===Siglap Canal===\nLocated near Area C4, a new lawn and lookout deck in East Coast Park was opened to provide visitors with an additional area for recreational activities as well as a community space. The enhancements were carried out with drainage upgrading for a 230m section of the Siglap Canal to the sea.\n\n===Parkland Green===\nParkland Green is a {{convert|4|ha|acres|abbr=on}} cluster of restaurants, cafes and shops next to Carpark C1. \n\nParkland Green opened to much fanfare in September 2014, and in its first few months of operation, experienced high footfall, especially on weekends. However, with the imposition of parking fees for its carpark and the opening of Marine Cove in June 2016, customer numbers and revenues sharply decreased in the second half of 2016.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite news |last=Singh |first=Bryna |date=11 December 2016 |title=Where are the crowds? |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/where-are-the-crowds |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |accessdate=8 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808142457/https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/where-are-the-crowds |archive-date=8 August 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe park is accessible by East Coast Park Service Road with numerous exits along the [[East Coast Parkway]]. The place provides ample parking space with many carparks situated along with various areas of the park. [[SBS Transit]] Bus Service 401 stops along the East Coast Park Service Road from [[Bedok Bus Interchange]] during weekends and public holidays. [[Underpass]]es link the park to the nearby [[Marine Parade]] housing estate.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe park is also connected to other parks in Singapore through the Park Connector Network, being part of the Eastern Coastal Park Connector Network. Within the park, footpaths and cycling paths allow access to pedestrians and cyclists respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nparks.gov.sg/~/media/nparks-real-content/gardens-parks-and-nature/park-connector-network/00-pcn-overview-page/ecpcn_d5.ashx |title=A Guide to Eastern Coastal Park Connector Network (ECPCN) Cycling Trail |website=nparks.gov.sg |publisher=NParks |accessdate=5 December 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of parks in Singapore]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons|East Coast Park}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20141226093639/http://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/ National Parks Board, Singapore]  \n*[https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/parks-and-nature-reserves/east-coast-park East Coast Park]\n\n{{Parks in Singapore}}\n{{Places in Singapore}}\n\n[[Category:Parks in Singapore]]\n[[Category:Bedok]]\n[[Category:Marine Parade]]\n[[Category:Tampines]]\n[[Category:Kallang]]\n[[Category:Marina East]]\n[[Category:Venues of the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics]]\n", "name_user": "Twofingered Typist", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDescription:edit for flow; added WP link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_Park"}

He was known especially for his war poetry, but also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction (including the Hartwarp books). Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse. <ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

During the 1930s he moved on from journalism and poetry to publishing novels and collections of short stories. However, it was the advent of the [[Second World War]] that enabled Pudney to find his subject - the effect that war has on the lives of ordinary people - and with it, his audience.<ref name=times>''The Times'' obituary, 11 November 1977, p 17</ref> In 1940 he was commissioned into the [[Royal Air Force]] as an intelligence officer and as a member of the [[Air Ministry]]'s Creative Writers Unit. It was while he was serving as squadron intelligence officer at [[RAF St Eval]] in Cornwall that Pudney wrote one of the best-known poems of the war.<ref name=dnb/> ''For Johnny'' evoked popular fellow-feeling in the London of 1941. Written during an air raid, it was published first in the ''News Chronicle'', and featured significantly in the film ''[[The Way to the Stars]]'':\n\n<poem>\nDo not despair\nFor Johnny-head-in-air;\nHe sleeps as sound\nAs Johnny underground.\n\nFetch out no shroud\nFor Johnny-in-the-cloud;\nAnd keep your tears\nFor him in after years.\n\nBetter by far\nFor Johnny-the-bright-star,\nTo keep your head,\nAnd see his children fed.\n</poem>\n\n==Later Career==\nIn the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|UK General Election of July 1945]], Pudney stood as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate for [[Sevenoaks (UK Parliament constituency)|Sevenoaks]], polling 14,947 votes, or 36 per cent.<ref>''The International Who's Who'' (Europa Publications Limited, 1963) p. 857</ref><ref>[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge45/i17.htm UK General Election results July 1945] at keele.ac.uk, accessed 10 January 2009</ref>\n\nAfter the war he continued to write and worked as an [[editing|editor]], as a director of magazines and publishing companies. He was with the ''[[News Review]]'' from 1948 to 1950, and as a director and literary adviser at the publishing houses Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. His later poetry, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic. Of his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''.\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married Crystal Selwyn Herbert,<ref>[http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/ww2/pudney/ John Pudney (1909 - 1977) - The War Poets Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417054114/http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/ww2/pudney/ |date=17 April 2013 }}</ref> the daughter of [[A.

Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse. <ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

During the 1930s he moved on from journalism and poetry to publishing novels and collections of short stories. However, it was the advent of the [[Second World War]] that enabled Pudney to find his subject - the effect that war has on the lives of ordinary people - and with it, his audience.<ref name=times>''The Times'' obituary, 11 November 1977, p 17</ref> In 1940 he was commissioned into the [[Royal Air Force]] as an intelligence officer and as a member of the [[Air Ministry]]'s Creative Writers Unit.

In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. His later poetry, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic.

Starring [[Michael Douglas]], [[Glenn Close]] and [[Anne Archer]], the film centers on a married person who has a weekend affair that ends up escalating to a point that he struggles to get out of.\n\n''Fatal Attraction'' was released on September 18, 1987 by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It received positive reviews from critics, but had generated controversy at the time of its release. The film became a huge box office success, grossing $320.1 million against a $14 million budget, becoming the [[1987 in film| second highest-grossing film of 1987]] in the US and highest grossing worldwide in 1987.\nAt the [[60th Academy Awards]], it received six nominations: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Close), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for Archer), [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].\n\n==Plot==\nDan Gallagher is a successful, happily married [[Manhattan]] lawyer whose work leads him to meet Alexandra \"Alex\" Forrest, an editor for a [[Publishing|publishing company]]. While his wife, Beth, and daughter, Ellen, are out of town for the weekend, Dan has an affair with Alex. Although it was initially understood by both as just a fling, Alex starts clinging to him.\n\nDan spends a second unplanned evening with Alex after she persistently asks him over. When Dan tries to leave, she cuts her wrists in a suicide attempt. He helps her bandage the cuts, stays with her overnight to make sure she is all right, and leaves in the morning. He thinks the affair is forgotten, but she shows up at various places to see him. She waits at his office one day to apologize and invites him to a performance of ''[[Madame Butterfly]]'', but he politely turns her down. She then continues to call him until he tells his secretary that he will no longer take her calls. \n\nAlex then phones his home at all hours, claiming that she is [[pregnant]], won't consider an [[abortion]] and plans to keep the baby. Although he wants nothing to do with her, she argues that he must take responsibility. After he changes his home phone number, she shows up at his apartment (which is for sale) and meets Beth, feigning interest as a buyer. Later that night, Dan goes to Alex's apartment to confront her, which results in a scuffle. In response, she replies that she will not be ignored.\n\nDan moves his family to [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford]], but this does not deter Alex. She has a tape recording delivered to him filled with verbal abuse. She stalks him in a parking garage, pours acid on his car, and follows him home one night to spy on him, Beth, and Ellen from the bushes in their yard; the sight of their content family literally makes her sick to her stomach. Her obsession escalates further when Dan approaches the police to apply for a [[restraining order]] against Alex (claiming that it is \"for a client\"). The lieutenant claims that he cannot violate her rights without [[probable cause]], and that the \"client\" has to own up to his [[adultery]].\n\nAt one point, while the Gallaghers are not home, Alex kills Ellen's pet rabbit, and puts it on their stove to boil. After this, Dan tells Beth of the affair and Alex's supposed pregnancy. Enraged, she demands that Dan leave. Before he goes, Dan calls Alex to tell her that Beth knows about the affair. Beth gets on the phone and warns Alex that she will kill her if she persists. Without Dan and Beth's knowledge, Alex picks up Ellen from school and takes her to an amusement park. Beth panics when she cannot find Ellen. She drives around frantically searching and rear-ends a car stopped at an intersection. Beth gets injured and is then hospitalized. Alex later takes Ellen home, asking her for a kiss on the cheek.\n\nDan barges into Alex's apartment and attacks her, choking her and coming close to strangling her. He stops himself, but as he does, she lunges at him with a kitchen knife. He overpowers her but decides to put the knife down and leave, while Alex is leaning against the kitchen counter, smiling. The police begin to search for her after Dan tells her about this. Following Beth's release from the hospital, she forgives Dan and they return home.\n\nBeth prepares a bath for herself when Alex suddenly appears, again with a kitchen knife. She starts to explain her resentment of Beth, nervously fidgeting (which causes Alex to cut her own leg) and then attacks Beth. Dan hears the screaming, rushes in, wrestles Alex into the bathtub, and seemingly drowns her. She suddenly emerges from the water, swinging the knife, but is shot in the chest and killed by Beth, who went searching for Dan's gun. The final scene shows police cars outside the Gallaghers' house. As Dan finishes delivering his statement to the police, he walks inside, where Beth is waiting for him. They embrace and proceed to the living room as the camera focuses on a picture of them and Ellen.\n\n[[File:Glenn Close 2012.jpg|thumb|Glenn Close in 2012]]\n[[File:Michael Douglas - Streets.JPG|thumb|Michael Douglas]]\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as Dan Gallagher - husband of Beth, father of Ellen, and a New York attorney who has an affair with his co worker Alex Forrest and later regrets it.\n* [[Glenn Close]] as Alexandra \"Alex\" Forrest - Dan's co worker and [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], who becomes obsessed with him.

In Meyer's book \"The View from the Bridge: Memories of Star Trek and a Life in Hollywood\", he explains that in late 1986 producer [[Stanley R. Jaffe]] asked him to look at the script developed by Dearden, and he wrote a four-page memo making suggestions for the script including a new ending for the movie. A few weeks later he met with director [[Adrian Lyne]] and gave him some additional suggestions. Ultimately Meyer was asked to redraft the script on the basis of his suggestions, which ended up being the shooting script.\n\n===Casting===\nProducers [[Sherry Lansing]] and [[Stanley R.

Before the audition, she let her naturally frizzy hair \"go wild\" because she was impatient at putting it up, and she wore a slimming black dress she thought made her look \"fabulous\" to audition.<ref>{{cite magazine| url=https://www.ew.com/article/2011/10/07/reunion-fatal-attraction/| title=From the archives: Fatal Attraction\u2019s Glenn Close, Michael Douglas reunite| author=Jess Cagle| magazine=Entertainment Weekly| date=2011-10-07| access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref> This impressed Lansing, because Close \"came in looking completely different...right away she was into the part.\"<ref>{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ivSI9tY2OI&t=815s| title=Fatal Attraction (1987) The Making Of Part 1 & 2| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2017-09-05| access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref> Close and Douglas performed a scene from early in the script, where Alex flirts with Dan in a caf\u00e9, and Close came away \"convinced my career was over, that I was finished, I had completely blown my chances.\"<ref name=\"Oxford Union\"/> Lansing and Lyne, however, were both convinced that she was right for the role; Lyne stated that \"an extraordinary erotic transformation took place.

She was uncomfortable with the bunny boiling scene, which she thought was too extreme, but she was assured on consulting the psychologists that such an action was entirely possible and that Alex's behavior corresponded to someone who had experienced incestual sexual abuse as a child.<ref name=\"Oxford Union\"/>\n\n===Alternate ending===\nAlex Forrest was originally scripted slashing her throat at the film's end with the knife Dan had left on the counter, so as to make it appear that Dan had murdered her. After seeing her husband being taken away by police, Beth finds a revealing cassette tape that Alex sent Dan in which she threatens to kill herself. Upon realizing Alex's intentions, Beth takes the tape to the police, which acquits Dan of the murder. The last scene shows, in flashback, Alex taking her own life by slashing her throat while listening to ''Madame Butterfly''.\n\nAfter doing test screenings, Joseph Farrell (who handled the test screenings) suggested that Paramount shoot a new ending.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/business/joseph-farrell-dies-at-76-used-market-research-to-shape-films.html</ref><ref>https://articles.latimes.com/1999/nov/07/magazine/tm-30884</ref> Alex is killed by a gunshot during the three-week reshoot of the action scene. Alex's killing by Beth juxtaposes the relationship between the two characters; with Alex being victimized and Beth violently protecting her family.<ref name = autogenerated1 />\n\nIn the 2002 Special Edition [[DVD]], Close comments that she had doubts about re-shooting the film's ending because she believed the character would \"self-destruct and commit suicide\".<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Close eventually gave in on her concerns, and filmed the new sequence after having fought against the change for two weeks.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Close has described how protective she was of her character, whom she \"never thought of as a villain\",<ref>{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IY8lxuo_yA&t=1s| title=Fatal Attraction Reunion Interview| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2010-03-06| access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref> stating that: \"I wasn't playing a generality, I wasn't playing a clich\u00e9. I was playing a very specific, deeply disturbed, fragile human being, whom I had grown to love.\"<ref name=\"Oxford Union\"/> However, though the ending made Alex into a \"psychopath\" against Close's wishes, she has also acknowledged that the film would not have experienced the enormous success it did without the new ending, because it gave the audience \"a sense of catharsis, a hope, that somehow the family unit would survive the nightmare.\" <ref name=\"Oxford Union\"/>\n\nThe film's first Japanese release used the original ending. The original ending also appeared on a special edition [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] release by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] in 1992, and was included on the film's DVD release a decade later.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fatal Attraction (Special Collector's Edition) (1987)|url=https://www.amazon.com/Attraction-Special-Collectors-Michael-Douglas/dp/B00003CXA0/|website=[[Amazon (website)|Amazon]] (United States)|accessdate=14 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Anchor|Reaction|Reception}} \n''Fatal Attraction'' spent eight weeks at #1 in the U.S. and eventually grossed $156.6 million domestically, making the film the second-highest-grossing film of 1987 in the U.S. behind ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]''.

According to a study of 148 people conducted by Randy and Lori Sansone, over half of the people who were found guilty of stalking-related incidents also experienced [[borderline personality disorder]] among other [[mental health]] concerns. It can be noted that Alex Forrest's femininity was seen as toxic and fearful to the people in the film that she interacted with, which is a crucial representation of women as possessive and psychotic when it comes to dominance over a man. People who experience borderline personality disorder can also have higher risks of issues like [[bipolar disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]].<ref name=pmid20532158>{{cite journal |pmid=20532158 |pmc=2882283 |year=2010 |author1=Sansone |first1=R.

Starring [[Michael Douglas]], [[Glenn Close]] and [[Anne Archer]], the film centers on a married man who has a weekend affair with a woman who refuses to allow it to end and becomes obsessed with him.\n\n''Fatal Attraction'' was released on September 18, 1987 by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It received positive reviews from critics, but had generated controversy at the time of its release. The film became a huge box office success, grossing $320.1 million against a $14 million budget, becoming the [[1987 in film| second highest-grossing film of 1987]] in the US and highest grossing worldwide in 1987.\nAt the [[60th Academy Awards]], it received six nominations: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Close), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for Archer), [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].\n\n==Plot==\nDan Gallagher is a successful, happily married [[Manhattan]] lawyer whose work leads him to meet Alexandra \"Alex\" Forrest, an editor for a [[Publishing|publishing company]]. While his wife, Beth, and daughter, Ellen, are out of town for the weekend, Dan has an affair with Alex. Although it was initially understood by both as just a fling, Alex starts clinging to him.\n\nDan spends a second unplanned evening with Alex after she persistently asks him over. When Dan tries to leave, she cuts her wrists in a suicide attempt. He helps her bandage the cuts, stays with her overnight to make sure she is all right, and leaves in the morning. He thinks the affair is forgotten, but she shows up at various places to see him. She waits at his office one day to apologize and invites him to a performance of ''[[Madame Butterfly]]'', but he politely turns her down. She then continues to call him until he tells his secretary that he will no longer take her calls. \n\nAlex then phones his home at all hours, claiming that she is [[pregnant]], won't consider an [[abortion]] and plans to keep the baby. Although he wants nothing to do with her, she argues that he must take responsibility. After he changes his home phone number, she shows up at his apartment (which is for sale) and meets Beth, feigning interest as a buyer. Later that night, Dan goes to Alex's apartment to confront her, which results in a scuffle. In response, she replies that she will not be ignored.\n\nDan moves his family to [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford]], but this does not deter Alex. She has a tape recording delivered to him filled with verbal abuse. She stalks him in a parking garage, pours acid on his car, and follows him home one night to spy on him, Beth, and Ellen from the bushes in their yard; the sight of their content family literally makes her sick to her stomach. Her obsession escalates further when Dan approaches the police to apply for a [[restraining order]] against Alex (claiming that it is \"for a client\"). The lieutenant claims that he cannot violate her rights without [[probable cause]], and that the \"client\" has to own up to his [[adultery]].\n\nAt one point, while the Gallaghers are not home, Alex kills Ellen's pet rabbit, and puts it on their stove to boil. After this, Dan tells Beth of the affair and Alex's supposed pregnancy. Enraged, she demands that Dan leave. Before he goes, Dan calls Alex to tell her that Beth knows about the affair. Beth gets on the phone and warns Alex that she will kill her if she persists. Without Dan and Beth's knowledge, Alex picks up Ellen from school and takes her to an amusement park. Beth panics when she cannot find Ellen. She drives around frantically searching and rear-ends a car stopped at an intersection. Beth gets injured and is then hospitalized. Alex later takes Ellen home, asking her for a kiss on the cheek.\n\nDan barges into Alex's apartment and attacks her, choking her and coming close to strangling her. He stops himself, but as he does, she lunges at him with a kitchen knife. He overpowers her but decides to put the knife down and leave, while Alex is leaning against the kitchen counter, smiling. The police begin to search for her after Dan tells her about this. Following Beth's release from the hospital, she forgives Dan and they return home.\n\nBeth prepares a bath for herself when Alex suddenly appears, again with a kitchen knife. She starts to explain her resentment of Beth, nervously fidgeting (which causes Alex to cut her own leg) and then attacks Beth. Dan hears the screaming, rushes in, wrestles Alex into the bathtub, and seemingly drowns her. She suddenly emerges from the water, swinging the knife, but is shot in the chest and killed by Beth, who went searching for Dan's gun. The final scene shows police cars outside the Gallaghers' house. As Dan finishes delivering his statement to the police, he walks inside, where Beth is waiting for him. They embrace and proceed to the living room as the camera focuses on a picture of them and Ellen.\n\n[[File:Glenn Close 2012.jpg|thumb|Glenn Close in 2012]]\n[[File:Michael Douglas - Streets.JPG|thumb|Michael Douglas]]\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as Dan Gallagher - husband of Beth, father of Ellen, and a New York attorney who has an affair with his co worker Alex Forrest and later regrets it.\n* [[Glenn Close]] as Alexandra \"Alex\" Forrest - Dan's co worker and [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], who becomes obsessed with him.

In Meyer's book \"The View from the Bridge: Memories of Star Trek and a Life in Hollywood\", he explains that in late 1986 producer [[Stanley R. Jaffe]] asked him to look at the script developed by Dearden, and he wrote a four-page memo making suggestions for the script including a new ending for the movie. A few weeks later he met with director [[Adrian Lyne]] and gave him some additional suggestions. Ultimately Meyer was asked to redraft the script on the basis of his suggestions, which ended up being the shooting script.\n\n===Casting===\nProducers [[Sherry Lansing]] and [[Stanley R. Jaffe]] both had serious doubts about casting Glenn Close because they did not think she could be sexual enough for the role of Alex.<ref name=\"Oxford Union\">{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDWDhntzc-w| title=Glenn Close Full Address & Q&A Oxford Union| author=Oxford Union| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2018-05-04| access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref> Close was persistent, so that after meeting with Jaffe several times in New York, she was asked to fly out to Los Angeles to read with Michael Douglas in front of Adrian Lyne and Lansing. Before the audition, she let her naturally frizzy hair \"go wild\" because she was impatient at putting it up, and she wore a slimming black dress she thought made her look \"fabulous\" to audition.<ref>{{cite magazine| url=https://www.ew.com/article/2011/10/07/reunion-fatal-attraction/| title=From the archives: Fatal Attraction\u2019s Glenn Close, Michael Douglas reunite| author=Jess Cagle| magazine=Entertainment Weekly| date=2011-10-07| access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref> This impressed Lansing, because Close \"came in looking completely different...right away she was into the part.\"<ref>{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ivSI9tY2OI&t=815s| title=Fatal Attraction (1987) The Making Of Part 1 & 2| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2017-09-05| access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref> Close and Douglas performed a scene from early in the script, where Alex flirts with Dan in a caf\u00e9, and Close came away \"convinced my career was over, that I was finished, I had completely blown my chances.\"<ref name=\"Oxford Union\"/> Lansing and Lyne, however, were both convinced that she was right for the role; Lyne stated that \"an extraordinary erotic transformation took place.

She was uncomfortable with the bunny boiling scene, which she thought was too extreme, but she was assured on consulting the psychologists that such an action was entirely possible and that Alex's behavior corresponded to someone who had experienced incestual sexual abuse as a child.<ref name=\"Oxford Union\"/>\n\n===Alternate ending===\nAlex Forrest was originally scripted slashing her throat at the film's end with the knife Dan had left on the counter, so as to make it appear that Dan had murdered her. After seeing her husband being taken away by police, Beth finds a revealing cassette tape that Alex sent Dan in which she threatens to kill herself. Upon realizing Alex's intentions, Beth takes the tape to the police, which acquits Dan of the murder. The last scene shows, in flashback, Alex taking her own life by slashing her throat while listening to ''Madame Butterfly''.\n\nAfter doing test screenings, Joseph Farrell (who handled the test screenings) suggested that Paramount shoot a new ending.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/business/joseph-farrell-dies-at-76-used-market-research-to-shape-films.html</ref><ref>https://articles.latimes.com/1999/nov/07/magazine/tm-30884</ref> Alex is killed by a gunshot during the three-week reshoot of the action scene. Alex's killing by Beth juxtaposes the relationship between the two characters; with Alex being victimized and Beth violently protecting her family.<ref name = autogenerated1 />\n\nIn the 2002 Special Edition [[DVD]], Close comments that she had doubts about re-shooting the film's ending because she believed the character would \"self-destruct and commit suicide\".<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Close eventually gave in on her concerns, and filmed the new sequence after having fought against the change for two weeks.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Close has described how protective she was of her character, whom she \"never thought of as a villain\",<ref>{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IY8lxuo_yA&t=1s| title=Fatal Attraction Reunion Interview| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2010-03-06| access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref> stating that: \"I wasn't playing a generality, I wasn't playing a clich\u00e9. I was playing a very specific, deeply disturbed, fragile human being, whom I had grown to love.\"<ref name=\"Oxford Union\"/> However, though the ending made Alex into a \"psychopath\" against Close's wishes, she has also acknowledged that the film would not have experienced the enormous success it did without the new ending, because it gave the audience \"a sense of catharsis, a hope, that somehow the family unit would survive the nightmare.\" <ref name=\"Oxford Union\"/>\n\nThe film's first Japanese release used the original ending. The original ending also appeared on a special edition [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] release by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] in 1992, and was included on the film's DVD release a decade later.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fatal Attraction (Special Collector's Edition) (1987)|url=https://www.amazon.com/Attraction-Special-Collectors-Michael-Douglas/dp/B00003CXA0/|website=[[Amazon (website)|Amazon]] (United States)|accessdate=14 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Anchor|Reaction|Reception}} \n''Fatal Attraction'' spent eight weeks at #1 in the U.S. and eventually grossed $156.6 million domestically, making the film the second-highest-grossing film of 1987 in the U.S. behind ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]''.

According to a study of 148 people conducted by Randy and Lori Sansone, over half of the people who were found guilty of stalking-related incidents also experienced [[borderline personality disorder]] among other [[mental health]] concerns. It can be noted that Alex Forrest's femininity was seen as toxic and fearful to the people in the film that she interacted with, which is a crucial representation of women as possessive and psychotic when it comes to dominance over a man. People who experience borderline personality disorder can also have higher risks of issues like [[bipolar disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]].<ref name=pmid20532158>{{cite journal |pmid=20532158 |pmc=2882283 |year=2010 |author1=Sansone |first1=R.

Since then, the regiment has filled both a ceremonial and protective role as well as an operational one. In 1900, the regiment provided a [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] of personnel to form the [[Irish Guards]]; while later, in 1915 it also provided the basis of the [[Welsh Guards]] upon their formation.\n\nThe regiment's early history saw it take part in numerous conflicts including the [[War of Spanish Succession]], the [[War of Austrian Succession]], the [[Seven Years' War]], and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; at the end of this period the regiment was granted the \"Grenadier\" designation by a Royal Proclamation.  During the [[Victorian Era]], the regiment took part in the [[Crimean War]], the [[Anglo-Egyptian War]], the [[Mahdist War]], and the [[Second Boer War]].  \n\nDuring the [[First World War]], the Grenadier Guards was expanded from three [[battalion]]s to five, of which four served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], while later during the [[Second World War]], six battalions were raised, and several were converted to an armoured role as part of the [[Guards Armoured Division]]. These units fought in [[Battle of France|France]], [[North-West Europe Campaign of 1944\u201345|North-West Europe]], [[North African campaign|North Africa]] and [[Italian campaign (World War II)|Italy]]. \n\nAfter the Second World War the regiment was reduced first to three battalions, then to two, and finally to one battalion in the mid-1990s. Major deployments during this time have included operations in [[1947\u20131948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Malayan Emergency|Malaya]], [[Cyprus Emergency|Cyprus]], [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Gulf War]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]].\n\n==History==\nThe Grenadier Guards trace their lineage back to 1656,<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1998|p=4}}</ref> when [[Lord Wentworth's Regiment]] was raised from gentlemen of the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] by the then heir to the throne, Prince Charles (later [[King of England|King]] [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]), in [[Bruges]], in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] (present-day Belgium), where it formed a part of the exiled King's bodyguard.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/britain-and-belgium-mark-360th-anniversary-of-the-grenadier-guards |title=Britain and Belgium mark 360th anniversary of the Grenadier Guards |date=2 September 2016 |publisher=Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|accessdate=4 September 2016}}</ref> A few years later, a similar regiment known as [[John Russell's Regiment of Guards]] was formed.<ref name=Fraser6>{{harvnb|Fraser|1998|p=6}}</ref> In 1665, these two regiments were combined to form the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards, consisting of 24 [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of men.<ref name=Fraser6/> Since then the Grenadier Guards have served ten Kings and four Queens, including the current [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]].

Since then, the regiment has filled both a ceremonial and protective role as well as an operational one. In 1900, the regiment provided a [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] of personnel to form the [[Irish Guards]]; while later, in 1915 it also provided the basis of the [[Welsh Guards]] upon their formation.\n\nThe regiment's early history saw it take part in numerous conflicts including the [[War of Spanish Succession]], the [[War of Austrian Succession]], the [[Seven Years' War]], and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; at the end of this period the regiment was granted the \"Grenadier\" designation by a Royal Proclamation.  During the [[Victorian Era]], the regiment took part in the [[Crimean War]], the [[Anglo-Egyptian War]], the [[Mahdist War]], and the [[Second Boer War]].  \n\nDuring the [[First World War]], the Grenadier Guards was expanded from three [[battalion]]s to five, of which four served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], while later during the [[Second World War]], six battalions were raised, and several were converted to an armoured role as part of the [[Guards Armoured Division]]. These units fought in [[Battle of France|France]], [[North-West Europe Campaign of 1944\u201345|North-West Europe]], [[North African campaign|North Africa]] and [[Italian campaign (World War II)|Italy]]. \n\nAfter the Second World War the regiment was reduced first to three battalions, then to two, and finally to one battalion in the mid-1990s. Major deployments during this time have included operations in [[1947\u20131948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Malayan Emergency|Malaya]], [[Cyprus Emergency|Cyprus]], [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Gulf War]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]].\n\n==History==\nThe Grenadier Guards trace their lineage back to 1656,<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1998|p=4}}</ref> when [[Lord Wentworth's Regiment]] was raised from gentlemen of the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] by the then heir to the throne, Prince Charles (later [[King of England|King]] [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]), in [[Bruges]], in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] (present-day Belgium), where it formed a part of the exiled King's bodyguard.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/britain-and-belgium-mark-360th-anniversary-of-the-grenadier-guards |title=Britain and Belgium mark 360th anniversary of the Grenadier Guards |date=2 September 2016 |publisher=Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|accessdate=4 September 2016}}</ref> A few years later, a similar regiment known as [[John Russell's Regiment of Guards]] was formed.<ref name=Fraser6>{{harvnb|Fraser|1998|p=6}}</ref> In 1665, these two regiments were combined to form the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards, consisting of 24 [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of men.<ref name=Fraser6/> Since then the Grenadier Guards have served ten Kings and four Queens, including the current [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]].

A whiplash injury may be the result of impulsive retracting of the [[spine (anatomy)|spine]], mainly the ligament: [[anterior longitudinal ligament]] which is stretched or tears, as the head snaps forward and then back again causing a whiplash injury.<ref name=\"Medline\">{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000025|Whiplash}}</ref>\n\nA whiplash injury from an automobile accident is called a cervical acceleration\u2013deceleration injury. Cadaver studies have shown that as an automobile occupant is hit from behind, the forces from the seat back compress the kyphosis of the thoracic spine, which provides an axial load on the lumbar spine and cervical spine. This forces the cervical spine to deform into an S-shape where the lower cervical spine is forced into a [[kyphosis]] while the upper cervical spine maintains its [[lordosis]]. As the injury progresses, the whole cervical spine is finally hyper-extended.\n\nWhiplash may be caused by any motion similar to a [[rear-end collision]] in a [[motor vehicle]], such as may take place on a [[roller coaster]]<ref>[http://www.spinalinjuryfoundation.org/research%20PDF/rollercoasterneckpain.pdf Roller Coaster Neck Pain], from the Spinal Injury Foundation</ref> or other rides at an [[amusement park]], [[sports]] injuries such as skiing accidents, other modes of transportation such as airplane travel, or from being hit, kicked or shaken.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.montazem.de/english/html/whiplash_injury.html | title = Whiplash injury | date = 2006-08-23  }}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.\n\nWhiplash associated disorders sometimes include injury to the cerebrum. In a severe cervical acceleration\u2013deceleration syndrome, a brain injury known as a coup-contra-coup injury occurs. A coup-contra-coup injury occurs as the brain is accelerated into the cranium as the head and neck hyperextend, and is then accelerated into the other side as the head and neck rebound to hyper-flexion or neutral position.\n\n\"Volunteer studies of experimental, low-velocity rear-end collisions have shown a percentage of subjects to report short-lived symptoms\",<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s004140000193 | last1 = Castro | first1 = W.

A 1000-case, four-year observational study published in 2012 said that the \"missing link\" in whiplash injuries is the [[trapezius muscle]] which may be damaged through eccentric [[muscle contraction]] during the whiplash mechanism described above and below.<ref name=\"Bismil\"/>  Another study<ref>Gorski JM and Schwartz LH,  [http://jbjs.org/content/85/4/635 Shoulder Impingement Presenting as Neck Pain].

Hence the pathology in whiplash may have been missed and the treatment ineffective.\n\n==Mechanism==\nWhiplash can be described as a sudden strain to the muscles, bones and nerves in the neck. The neck is made up of seven vertebrae, referred to as the cervical vertebrae. The first two cervical vertebrae, the axis and atlas, are shaped differently from the remaining five. The atlas and axis are responsible for movement of the skull from side to side (cervical rotation to the right and left); also moving forward and backward (cervical flexion and extension). Excessive extension and flexion can disrupt the vertebrae.\n\nThere are four phases that occur during \"whiplash\": Initial position (before the collision), retraction, extension and rebound.  In the initial position there is no force on the neck it is stable due to inertia.<ref>Stemper, D. B., Yoganandan, N., Pintar, A.F., and Rao D.R. (2006)</ref> Anterior longitudinal ligament injuries in whiplash may lead to cervical instability.<ref>Medical Engineering And Physics, 28(6), 515-524.</ref> They explain that during the retraction phase that is when the actual \"whiplash\" occurs, since there is an unusual loading of soft tissues. The next phase is the extension, the whole neck and head switches to extension, and it is stopped or limited by the head restraint.  The rebound phase transpires as result of the phases that are mentioned.\n\nDuring the retraction phase the spine forms an S-Shaped curve, and this caused by the flexion in the upper planes and hyperextension at the lower planes and this exceed their physiological limits this phase the injuries occur to the lower cervical vertebrae. At the extension phase all cervical vertebrae and the head are fully extended, but do not surpass their physiological limits. Most of the injuries happen in C-5 and C-6.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Panjabi M.M. |author2=Cholewicki J. |author3=Nibu K. |author4=Grauer N.J |author5=Babat B.L. |author6=Dvorack J. | year = 1998 | title = Mechanism of whiplash injury | url = | journal = Clinical Biomechanics | volume = 13 | issue = 4\u20135| pages = 239\u2013249 | doi=10.1016/s0268-0033(98)00033-3|pmid=11415793 }}</ref>\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nWhile the time associated with a specific collision will vary, the following provides an example of the occupant and seat interaction sequence for a collision lasting approximately 300 milliseconds.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!0 ms\n|\n*\tRear car structure is impacted and begins to move forward and/or crushes\n*\tOccupant remains stationary\n*\tNo occupant forces\n|-\n!100 ms\n|\n*\tVehicle seat accelerates and pushes into occupant's torso (i.e. central portion of the body in contact with seat)\n*\tThe torso loads the seat and is accelerated forward (seat will deflect rearward) \n*\tHead remains stationary due to inertia\n|-\n!150 ms\n|\n*\tTorso is accelerated by the vehicle seat and may start to ramp up the seat\n*\tLower neck is pulled forward by the accelerated torso/seat\n*\tThe head rotates and extends rapidly rearward hyper-extending the neck\n|-\n!175 ms\n|\n*\tHead is still moving backwards\n*\tVehicle seat begins to spring forward\n*\tThe torso continues to be accelerated forward\n*\tThe head rotation rearward is increased and is fully extended\n|-\n!300 ms\n|\n*\tHead and torso are accelerated forward\n*\tNeck is \"whipped\" forward rotating and hyper-flexing the neck forward\n*\tThe head accelerates due to neck motion and moves ahead of the seat back\n|}\n\n==Diagnosis==\nDiagnosis occurs through a patient history, head and neck examination, [[X-ray]]s to rule out [[bone fracture]]s and may involve the use of [[medical imaging]] to determine if there are other injuries.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.webmd.com/back-pain/tc/whiplash-topic-overview | title =Whiplash \u2014 Topic Overview | publisher = [[WebMD]] | date = 2006-11-16 | accessdate = 2008-01-18 }}</ref>\n\n===Qu\u00e9bec Task Force===\nThe ''Qu\u00e9bec Task Force'' (''QTF'') has divided whiplash-associated disorders into five grades.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pastakia|first=Khushnum|last2=Kumar|first2=Saravana|date=2011-04-27|title=Acute whiplash associated disorders (WAD)|journal= Open Access Emergency Medicine|volume=3|pages=29\u201332|doi=10.2147/OAEM.S17853|issn=1179-1500|pmc=4753964|pmid=27147849}}</ref>\n\n* Grade 0: no neck pain, stiffness, or any physical signs are noticed\n* Grade 1: neck complaints of pain, stiffness or tenderness only but no physical signs are noted by the examining physician.\n* Grade 2: neck complaints and the examining physician finds decreased range of motion and point tenderness in the neck.\n* Grade 3: neck complaints plus neurological signs such as decreased deep tendon reflexes, weakness and sensory deficits.\n* Grade 4: neck complaints and fracture or dislocation, or injury to the spinal cord.\n\n==Prevention==\nThe focus of preventive measures to date has been on the design of [[car seat]]s, primarily through the introduction of head restraints, often called [[headrest]]s. This approach is potentially problematic given the underlying assumption that purely mechanical factors cause whiplash injuries \u2014 an unproven theory. So far the injury reducing effects of head restraints appears to have been low, approximately 5\u201310%, because car seats have become stiffer in order to increase [[crashworthiness]]  of cars in high-speed rear-end collisions which in turn could increase the risk of whiplash injury in low-speed rear impact collisions. Improvements in the geometry of car seats through better design and energy absorption could offer additional benefits. Active devices move the body in a crash in order to shift the loads on the car seat.<ref name=\"vv-folksam\" />\n \nFor the last 40 years, vehicle safety researchers have been designing and gathering information on the ability of head restraints to mitigate injuries resulting from rear-end collisions. As a result, different types of head restraints have been developed by various manufactures to protect their occupants from whiplash.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Zuby DS, Lund AK |title=Preventing minor neck injuries in rear crashes\u2014forty years of progress |journal=J.

The device may permit horizontal displacement, known as tilt adjustment, and/or vertical displacement, known as height adjustment. \n \n'''Active head restraint''' \u2014 refers to a device designed to automatically improve head restraint position and/or geometry during an impact\". \n \n'''Automatically adjusting head restraint''' \u2014 refers to a head restraint that automatically adjusts the position of the head restraint when the seat position is adjusted. \n \nA major issue in whiplash prevention is the lack of proper adjustment of the seat safety system by both drivers and passengers. Studies have shown that a well designed and adjusted head restraint could prevent potentially injurious head-neck kinematics in rear-end collisions by limiting the differential movement of the head and torso. The primary function of a head restraint is to minimize the relative rearward movement of the head and neck during rear impact. During a rear-end collision, the presence of an effective head restraint behind the occupant's head can limit the differential movement of the head and torso. A properly placed head restraint where one can sufficiently protect his/her head lower the chances of head injury by up to 35% during a rear-end collision.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Farmer CM, Wells JK, Lund AK |title=Effects of head restraint and seat redesign on neck injury risk in rear-end crashes |journal=Traffic Inj Prev |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=83\u201390 |date=June 2003 |pmid=16210192 |doi=10.1080/15389580309867 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Farmer CM, Zuby DS, Wells JK, Hellinga LA |title=Relationship of dynamic seat ratings to real-world neck injury rates |journal=Traffic Inj Prev |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=561\u20137 |date=December 2008 |pmid=19058103 |doi=10.1080/15389580802393041 }}</ref>\n \nIn contrast to a properly adjusted head restraint, research suggests that there may be an increased risk of neck injuries if the head restraint is incorrectly positioned. More studies by manufacturers and automobile safety organizations are currently undergoing to examine the best ways to reduce head and torso injuries during a rear-end impact with different geometries of the head restraint and seat-back systems. \n \nIn most passenger vehicles where manually adjustable head restraints are fitted, proper use requires sufficient knowledge and awareness by occupants. When driving, the height of the head restraint is critical in influencing injury risk. A restraint should be at least as high as the head's center of gravity, or about 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) below the top of the head. The backset, or distance behind the head, should be as small as possible. Backsets of more than 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) have been associated with increased symptoms of neck injury in crashes.\nIn a sitting position, the minimum height of the restraint should correspond to the top of the driver's ear or even higher. In addition, there should be minimal distance between the back of head and the point where it first meets the restraint. \n \nDue to low public awareness of the consequence of incorrect positioning of head restraints, some passenger vehicle manufactures have designed and implemented a range of devices into their models to protect their occupants.\n\nSome current systems are:\n* [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[Mercedes-Benz A-Class|A-Class]] Active Head Restraint (AHR)<ref name=\"vv-folksam\" /><ref>[http://www.all4engineers.com/index.php;do=show/lng=en/alloc=1/id=3121/sid=138427026044eb7d129e03b285836696 Long Fibre-Reinforced Polyamide for Crash-Active Car Headrests], August 22, 2006</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}},\n* [[Saab automobile|Saab]] (Responsible for the first active head restraint), [[Opel]], [[Ford]], [[Nissan]], [[Subaru]], [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]], and [[Peugeot]] \u2014 Active Head restraint (SAHR)<ref name=\"vv-folksam\" /><ref>[http://www.carpages.co.uk/saab/saab-active-head-restraints-22-11-05.asp Top Safety Ratings For Saab Active Head Restraints], UK Motor Search Engine, August 22, 2006</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}},\n* [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]] and [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] \u2014 Whiplash Protection System/Whiplash Prevention System ([[WHIPS]])<ref>[http://www.volvoclub.org.uk/press/releases/2004/whiplash_protection_system.shtml Volvo Seat Is Benchmark For Whiplash Protection], Volvo Owners Club, August 22, 2006</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, and\n* [[Toyota]] \u2014 Whiplash Injury Lessening (WIL).<ref name=\"vv-folksam\" />{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nThe [http://www.iihs.org/ Insurance Institute for Highway Safety] (IIHS) and other testing centers around the world have been involved in testing the effectiveness of head restraint and seat systems in laboratory conditions to assess their ability to prevent or mitigate whiplash injuries.

The main purpose with early rehabilitation is to reduce the risk for development of Whiplash syndrome. Early rehabilitation for whiplash depends on the grade category. It can be categorized as grade 0 being no pain to grade 4 with a cervical bone fracture or dislocation.  Grade 4 obviously needs admission to hospital while grade 0-3 can be managed as outpatients. The symptoms from the potential injury to the cervical spine may be debilitating, and pain was reported to be one of the biggest stressor events experienced in daily living, so it is important to begin rehabilitation immediately to prevent future pain.<ref name=\"Bring-2012\">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Bring | first1 = A. | last2 = Soderlund | first2 = A. | last3 = Wasteson | first3 = E. | last4 = Asenl\u00f6f | first4 = P. | title = Daily stressors in patients with acute whiplash associated disorders. | journal = Disabil Rehabil | volume = 34 | issue = 21 | pages = 1783\u20139 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.3109/09638288.2012.662571 | pmid = 22512410 }}</ref>\n\nCurrent research supports that active mobilization rather than a soft collar results in a more prompt recovery both in the short<ref name=\"Schnabel-2004\">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Schnabel | first1 = M. | last2 = Ferrari | first2 = R. | last3 = Vassiliou | first3 = T. | last4 = Kaluza | first4 = G. | title = Randomised, controlled outcome study of active mobilisation compared with collar therapy for whiplash injury. | journal = Emerg Med J | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 306\u201310 |date=May 2004 | doi =  10.1136/emj.2003.010165| pmid = 15107368 | pmc=1726332}}</ref> and long term<ref name=\"Rosenfeld-2003\">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Rosenfeld | first1 = M. | last2 = Seferiadis | first2 = A. | last3 = Carlsson | first3 = J. | last4 = Gunnarsson | first4 = R. | title = Active intervention in patients with whiplash-associated disorders improves long-term prognosis: a randomized controlled clinical trial. | journal = Spine | volume = 28 | issue = 22 | pages = 2491\u20138 | year=2003 | doi = 10.1097/01.BRS.0000090822.96814.13 | pmid = 14624083 | pmc=}}</ref> perspective.

A whiplash injury may be the result of impulsive retracting of the [[spine (anatomy)|spine]], mainly the ligament: [[anterior longitudinal ligament]] which is stretched or tears, as the head snaps forward and then back again causing a whiplash injury.<ref name=\"Medline\">{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000025|Whiplash}}</ref>\n\nA whiplash injury from an automobile accident is called a cervical acceleration\u2013deceleration injury. Cadaver studies have shown that as an automobile occupant is hit from behind, the forces from the seat back compress the kyphosis of the thoracic spine, which provides an axial load on the lumbar spine and cervical spine. This forces the cervical spine to deform into an S-shape where the lower cervical spine is forced into a [[kyphosis]] while the upper cervical spine maintains its [[lordosis]]. As the injury progresses, the whole cervical spine is finally hyper-extended.\n\nWhiplash may be caused by any motion similar to a [[rear-end collision]] in a [[motor vehicle]], such as may take place on a [[roller coaster]]<ref>[http://www.spinalinjuryfoundation.org/research%20PDF/rollercoasterneckpain.pdf Roller Coaster Neck Pain], from the Spinal Injury Foundation</ref> or other rides at an [[amusement park]], [[sports]] injuries such as skiing accidents, other modes of transportation such as airplane travel, or from being hit, kicked or shaken.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.montazem.de/english/html/whiplash_injury.html | title = Whiplash injury | date = 2006-08-23  }}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.\n\nWhiplash associated disorders sometimes include injury to the cerebrum. In a severe cervical acceleration\u2013deceleration syndrome, a brain injury known as a coup-contra-coup injury occurs. A coup-contra-coup injury occurs as the brain is accelerated into the cranium as the head and neck hyperextend, and is then accelerated into the other side as the head and neck rebound to hyper-flexion or neutral position.\n\n\"Volunteer studies of experimental, low-velocity rear-end collisions have shown a percentage of subjects to report short-lived symptoms\",<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s004140000193 | last1 = Castro | first1 = W.

A 1000-case, four-year observational study published in 2012 said that the \"missing link\" in whiplash injuries is the [[trapezius muscle]] which may be damaged through eccentric [[muscle contraction]] during the whiplash mechanism described above and below.<ref name=\"Bismil\"/>  Another study<ref>Gorski JM and Schwartz LH,  [http://jbjs.org/content/85/4/635 Shoulder Impingement Presenting as Neck Pain].

Whiplash due to The Referred Shoulder Impingement Syndrome was successfully treated using conventional treatments for shoulder impingement including anti inflammatory steroids and non steroids, and by avoiding the overhead position of shoulder impingement during the day and night time.<ref>Gorski JM and Schwartz LH, Shoulder Impingement Presenting as Neck Pain. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery VOL 85-A \u00b7 NUMBER 4 \u00b7 APRIL 2003 p635-638(ibid)</ref>{{how|date=June 2015}}  All of this work demonstrates that historically and indeed presently whiplash patients' pain sources may be missed if it is outside of the neck.  Hence the pathology in whiplash may have been missed and the treatment ineffective.\n\n==Mechanism==\nWhiplash can be described as a sudden strain to the muscles, bones and nerves in the neck. The neck is made up of seven vertebrae, referred to as the cervical vertebrae. The first two cervical vertebrae, the axis and atlas, are shaped differently from the remaining five. The atlas and axis are responsible for movement of the skull from side to side (cervical rotation to the right and left); also moving forward and backward (cervical flexion and extension). Excessive extension and flexion can disrupt the vertebrae.\n\nThere are four phases that occur during \"whiplash\": Initial position (before the collision), retraction, extension and rebound.  In the initial position there is no force on the neck it is stable due to inertia.<ref>Stemper, D. B., Yoganandan, N., Pintar, A.F., and Rao D.R. (2006)</ref> Anterior longitudinal ligament injuries in whiplash may lead to cervical instability.<ref>Medical Engineering And Physics, 28(6), 515-524.</ref> They explain that during the retraction phase that is when the actual \"whiplash\" occurs, since there is an unusual loading of soft tissues. The next phase is the extension, the whole neck and head switches to extension, and it is stopped or limited by the head restraint.  The rebound phase transpires as result of the phases that are mentioned.\n\nDuring the retraction phase the spine forms an S-Shaped curve, and this caused by the flexion in the upper planes and hyperextension at the lower planes and this exceed their physiological limits this phase the injuries occur to the lower cervical vertebrae. At the extension phase all cervical vertebrae and the head are fully extended, but do not surpass their physiological limits. Most of the injuries happen in C-5 and C-6.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Panjabi M.M. |author2=Cholewicki J. |author3=Nibu K. |author4=Grauer N.J |author5=Babat B.L. |author6=Dvorack J. | year = 1998 | title = Mechanism of whiplash injury | url = | journal = Clinical Biomechanics | volume = 13 | issue = 4\u20135| pages = 239\u2013249 | doi=10.1016/s0268-0033(98)00033-3|pmid=11415793 }}</ref>\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nWhile the time associated with a specific collision will vary, the following provides an example of the occupant and seat interaction sequence for a collision lasting approximately 300 milliseconds.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!0 ms\n|\n*\tRear car structure is impacted and begins to move forward and/or crushes\n*\tOccupant remains stationary\n*\tNo occupant forces\n|-\n!100 ms\n|\n*\tVehicle seat accelerates and pushes into occupant's torso (i.e. central portion of the body in contact with seat)\n*\tThe torso loads the seat and is accelerated forward (seat will deflect rearward) \n*\tHead remains stationary due to inertia\n|-\n!150 ms\n|\n*\tTorso is accelerated by the vehicle seat and may start to ramp up the seat\n*\tLower neck is pulled forward by the accelerated torso/seat\n*\tThe head rotates and extends rapidly rearward hyper-extending the neck\n|-\n!175 ms\n|\n*\tHead is still moving backwards\n*\tVehicle seat begins to spring forward\n*\tThe torso continues to be accelerated forward\n*\tThe head rotation rearward is increased and is fully extended\n|-\n!300 ms\n|\n*\tHead and torso are accelerated forward\n*\tNeck is \"whipped\" forward rotating and hyper-flexing the neck forward\n*\tThe head accelerates due to neck motion and moves ahead of the seat back\n|}\n\n==Diagnosis==\nDiagnosis occurs through a patient history, head and neck examination, [[X-ray]]s to rule out [[bone fracture]]s and may involve the use of [[medical imaging]] to determine if there are other injuries.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.webmd.com/back-pain/tc/whiplash-topic-overview | title =Whiplash \u2014 Topic Overview | publisher = [[WebMD]] | date = 2006-11-16 | accessdate = 2008-01-18 }}</ref>\n\n===Qu\u00e9bec Task Force===\nThe ''Qu\u00e9bec Task Force'' (''QTF'') has divided whiplash-associated disorders into five grades.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pastakia|first=Khushnum|last2=Kumar|first2=Saravana|date=2011-04-27|title=Acute whiplash associated disorders (WAD)|journal= Open Access Emergency Medicine|volume=3|pages=29\u201332|doi=10.2147/OAEM.S17853|issn=1179-1500|pmc=4753964|pmid=27147849}}</ref>\n\n* Grade 0: no neck pain, stiffness, or any physical signs are noticed\n* Grade 1: neck complaints of pain, stiffness or tenderness only but no physical signs are noted by the examining physician.\n* Grade 2: neck complaints and the examining physician finds decreased range of motion and point tenderness in the neck.\n* Grade 3: neck complaints plus neurological signs such as decreased deep tendon reflexes, weakness and sensory deficits.\n* Grade 4: neck complaints and fracture or dislocation, or injury to the spinal cord.\n\n==Prevention==\nThe focus of preventive measures to date has been on the design of [[car seat]]s, primarily through the introduction of head restraints, often called [[headrest]]s. This approach is potentially problematic given the underlying assumption that purely mechanical factors cause whiplash injuries \u2014 an unproven theory. So far the injury reducing effects of head restraints appears to have been low, approximately 5\u201310%, because car seats have become stiffer in order to increase [[crashworthiness]]  of cars in high-speed rear-end collisions which in turn could increase the risk of whiplash injury in low-speed rear impact collisions. Improvements in the geometry of car seats through better design and energy absorption could offer additional benefits. Active devices move the body in a crash in order to shift the loads on the car seat.<ref name=\"vv-folksam\" />\n \nFor the last 40 years, vehicle safety researchers have been designing and gathering information on the ability of head restraints to mitigate injuries resulting from rear-end collisions. As a result, different types of head restraints have been developed by various manufactures to protect their occupants from whiplash.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Zuby DS, Lund AK |title=Preventing minor neck injuries in rear crashes\u2014forty years of progress |journal=J.

The device may permit horizontal displacement, known as tilt adjustment, and/or vertical displacement, known as height adjustment. \n \n'''Active head restraint''' \u2014 refers to a device designed to automatically improve head restraint position and/or geometry during an impact\". \n \n'''Automatically adjusting head restraint''' \u2014 refers to a head restraint that automatically adjusts the position of the head restraint when the seat position is adjusted. \n \nA major issue in whiplash prevention is the lack of proper adjustment of the seat safety system by both drivers and passengers. Studies have shown that a well designed and adjusted head restraint could prevent potentially injurious head-neck kinematics in rear-end collisions by limiting the differential movement of the head and torso. The primary function of a head restraint is to minimize the relative rearward movement of the head and neck during rear impact. During a rear-end collision, the presence of an effective head restraint behind the occupant's head can limit the differential movement of the head and torso. A properly placed head restraint where one can sufficiently protect his/her head lower the chances of head injury by up to 35% during a rear-end collision.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Farmer CM, Wells JK, Lund AK |title=Effects of head restraint and seat redesign on neck injury risk in rear-end crashes |journal=Traffic Inj Prev |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=83\u201390 |date=June 2003 |pmid=16210192 |doi=10.1080/15389580309867 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Farmer CM, Zuby DS, Wells JK, Hellinga LA |title=Relationship of dynamic seat ratings to real-world neck injury rates |journal=Traffic Inj Prev |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=561\u20137 |date=December 2008 |pmid=19058103 |doi=10.1080/15389580802393041 }}</ref>\n \nIn contrast to a properly adjusted head restraint, research suggests that there may be an increased risk of neck injuries if the head restraint is incorrectly positioned. More studies by manufacturers and automobile safety organizations are currently undergoing to examine the best ways to reduce head and torso injuries during a rear-end impact with different geometries of the head restraint and seat-back systems. \n \nIn most passenger vehicles where manually adjustable head restraints are fitted, proper use requires sufficient knowledge and awareness by occupants. When driving, the height of the head restraint is critical in influencing injury risk. A restraint should be at least as high as the head's center of gravity, or about 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) below the top of the head. The backset, or distance behind the head, should be as small as possible. Backsets of more than 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) have been associated with increased symptoms of neck injury in crashes.\nIn a sitting position, the minimum height of the restraint should correspond to the top of the driver's ear or even higher. In addition, there should be minimal distance between the back of head and the point where it first meets the restraint. \n \nDue to low public awareness of the consequence of incorrect positioning of head restraints, some passenger vehicle manufactures have designed and implemented a range of devices into their models to protect their occupants.\n\nSome current systems are:\n* [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[Mercedes-Benz A-Class|A-Class]] Active Head Restraint (AHR)<ref name=\"vv-folksam\" /><ref>[http://www.all4engineers.com/index.php;do=show/lng=en/alloc=1/id=3121/sid=138427026044eb7d129e03b285836696 Long Fibre-Reinforced Polyamide for Crash-Active Car Headrests], August 22, 2006</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}},\n* [[Saab automobile|Saab]] (Responsible for the first active head restraint), [[Opel]], [[Ford]], [[Nissan]], [[Subaru]], [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]], and [[Peugeot]] \u2014 Active Head restraint (SAHR)<ref name=\"vv-folksam\" /><ref>[http://www.carpages.co.uk/saab/saab-active-head-restraints-22-11-05.asp Top Safety Ratings For Saab Active Head Restraints], UK Motor Search Engine, August 22, 2006</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}},\n* [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]] and [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] \u2014 Whiplash Protection System/Whiplash Prevention System ([[WHIPS]])<ref>[http://www.volvoclub.org.uk/press/releases/2004/whiplash_protection_system.shtml Volvo Seat Is Benchmark For Whiplash Protection], Volvo Owners Club, August 22, 2006</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, and\n* [[Toyota]] \u2014 Whiplash Injury Lessening (WIL).<ref name=\"vv-folksam\" />{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nThe [http://www.iihs.org/ Insurance Institute for Highway Safety] (IIHS) and other testing centers around the world have been involved in testing the effectiveness of head restraint and seat systems in laboratory conditions to assess their ability to prevent or mitigate whiplash injuries.

The main purpose with early rehabilitation is to reduce the risk for development of Whiplash syndrome. Early rehabilitation for whiplash depends on the grade category. It can be categorized as grade 0 being no pain to grade 4 with a cervical bone fracture or dislocation.  Grade 4 obviously needs admission to hospital while grade 0-3 can be managed as outpatients. The symptoms from the potential injury to the cervical spine may be debilitating, and pain was reported to be one of the biggest stressor events experienced in daily living, so it is important to begin rehabilitation immediately to prevent future pain.<ref name=\"Bring-2012\">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Bring | first1 = A. | last2 = Soderlund | first2 = A. | last3 = Wasteson | first3 = E. | last4 = Asenl\u00f6f | first4 = P. | title = Daily stressors in patients with acute whiplash associated disorders. | journal = Disabil Rehabil | volume = 34 | issue = 21 | pages = 1783\u20139 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.3109/09638288.2012.662571 | pmid = 22512410 }}</ref>\n\nCurrent research supports that active mobilization rather than a soft collar results in a more prompt recovery both in the short<ref name=\"Schnabel-2004\">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Schnabel | first1 = M. | last2 = Ferrari | first2 = R. | last3 = Vassiliou | first3 = T. | last4 = Kaluza | first4 = G. | title = Randomised, controlled outcome study of active mobilisation compared with collar therapy for whiplash injury. | journal = Emerg Med J | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 306\u201310 |date=May 2004 | doi =  10.1136/emj.2003.010165| pmid = 15107368 | pmc=1726332}}</ref> and long term<ref name=\"Rosenfeld-2003\">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Rosenfeld | first1 = M. | last2 = Seferiadis | first2 = A. | last3 = Carlsson | first3 = J. | last4 = Gunnarsson | first4 = R. | title = Active intervention in patients with whiplash-associated disorders improves long-term prognosis: a randomized controlled clinical trial. | journal = Spine | volume = 28 | issue = 22 | pages = 2491\u20138 | year=2003 | doi = 10.1097/01.BRS.0000090822.96814.13 | pmid = 14624083 | pmc=}}</ref> perspective.

Pusheen was created in 2010 by [[Claire Belton]] and Andrew Duff for a comic strip on their website, Everyday Cute. More recently, the Pusheen character has been used in social media posts and on the Pusheen blog.\n\nOn the official Pusheen website, Pusheen is described as being a female tabby cat who loves blogging, snacking, and going on adventures. The original comic strip series included characters modeled after Belton, Duff, their dog named Carm (short for \u201cCarmen\u201d), and Pusheen, a chubby grey tabby cat based on Belton's cat that now lives with her parents in [[Oregon]]. Pusheen's name stems from the word {{lang|ga|[[Wiktionary:puis\u00edn|puis\u00edn]]}}, which means kitten in [[Irish language|Irish]]. Pusheen is sometimes seen with her sister, Stormy and her brother, Pip. Occasionally, Pusheen and Stormy are drawn in different themes, such as Pusheenosaurus Rex, where Pusheen is a dinosaur and Stormy is in a dinosaur egg. She can also be a Pusheenicorn, Purrmaid, and many other themes. Pusheen has a mom, dad, husband, a sister named Stormy, a brother named Pip, two kids, and an array of furry friends, including Sloth the sloth, Bo the parakeet, and Cheek the hamster. \n\n==History==\nPusheen first appeared in May 2010 in the comic strip \"Pusheen Things\" on Claire Belton and Andrew Duff's website, Everyday Cute.<ref name=\"Everyday Cute\">{{cite web|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101028150124/http://everydaycute.com/?p=25|url=http://everydaycute.com/?p=25 |title= Comic 1: Pusheen Things|publisher=Everyday Cute |date=May 2010 |archivedate=October 28, 2010 |accessdate=February 24, 2016}}</ref> In 2011, Belton and Duff launched a spin-off site dedicated to Pusheen.
