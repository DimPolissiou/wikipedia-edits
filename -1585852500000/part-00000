En la mente del asesino''] all spoke of the consequences of the war, the perversions of war which changes the nautre of human beings, now, after, in the future and before. The perversions of war most interests Villaronga.}}</ref> Since childhood, his father encouraged his love for films and from early in his life he wanted to become a film director. He worked as an actor and made some shorts.\n\nVillaronga made his directorial debut in 1986 with the film ''[[Tras el cristal]]'', which was selected by the [[Berlin film festival]] receiving critical praise and many awards. The plot follows a former Nazi doctor, now paralyzed and depending on an iron lung to live, who begins to be taken care of by a young man, one of the children he abused during the war.\n''Tras el cristal'' already shows some of the key elements in Villaronga's filmography: a disturbed childhood marked by violence an early discovery of sexuality.\n\nHis second film, ''[[Moon Child (1989 film)|El ni\u00f1o de la Luna]]'' (1989), is about a child who goes to Africa to join a tribe awaiting the arrival of white child God. In 1992 he made a documentary, ''Al Andaluz'', produced by Segetel and the [[MoMa]] of [[New York city]]. For some years Villaronga tried unsuccessfully to find financing to adapt a novel by [[Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda]], ''Muerte en Primavera''. Instead he had to take some commission works. One of these was ''El pasajero clandestino'', a made for television project that lacked the personal characteristics of his filmography.\n\nCalled by actress [[Mar\u00eda Barranco]], Villaronga directed ''99.99'' a horror film more in synch with his themes, and that won some awards in festivals specialized in fantastic cinema. In 2000, Villaronga came back with a project of his own: ''[[The Sea (2000 film)|El mar]]'', a story set in [[Mallorca]] about three former childhood friends, traumatized by the violence they experienced during the Spanish civil war, that are reunited ten years later as young adults in a sanitary of tubercular patiences. The key elements in Villaronga's filmography are present in this story: childhood, sexual awakening, homosexuality and violence.\n\nIn 2002, Villaronga  co-directed with [[Lydia Zimmermann]] and [[Lydia Zimmermann#Isaac Pierre Racine|Isaac Pierre Racine]] the film ''[[Aro Tolbukhin. En la mente del asesino|En la mente del asesino]]''. In 2005 he directed a music video for French superstar [[Myl\u00e8ne Farmer]]'s song ''[[Fuck Them All]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mylene.net/mylene/c_fuck-them-all.php|title=Mylene.Net - Le site r\u00e9f\u00e9rence sur Myl\u00e8ne Farmer|author =Julien AUTIER|author2 =Philippe LEZE|author3 =Guillaume DATEZ|author4 =Sarah HOFER|last-author-amp =yes|work=mylene.net|accessdate=30 March 2016}}</ref> In 2007 he made ''Despu\u00e9s de la lluvia'', a made for television project adapting a stage play. It was only until 2010 with ''Pa negre'', when Villaronga finally achieved wider appeal.

The perversions of war most interests Villaronga.}}</ref> Since childhood, his father encouraged his love for films and from early in his life he wanted to become a film director. He worked as an actor and made some shorts.\n\nVillaronga made his directorial debut in 1986 with the film ''[[Tras el cristal]]'', which was selected by the [[Berlin film festival]] receiving critical praise and many awards. The plot follows a former Nazi doctor, now paralyzed and depending on an iron lung to live, who begins to be taken care of by a young man, one of the children he abused during the war.\n''Tras el cristal'' already shows some of the key elements in Villaronga's filmography: a disturbed childhood marked by violence an early discovery of sexuality.\n\nHis second film, ''[[Moon Child (1989 film)|El ni\u00f1o de la Luna]]'' (1989), is about a child who goes to Africa to join a tribe awaiting the arrival of white child God. In 1992 he made a documentary, ''Al Andaluz'', produced by Segetel and the [[MoMa]] of [[New York city]]. For some years Villaronga tried unsuccessfully to find financing to adapt a novel by [[Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda]], ''Muerte en Primavera''. Instead he had to take some commission works. One of these was ''El pasajero clandestino'', a made for television project that lacked the personal characteristics of his filmography.\n\nCalled by actress [[Mar\u00eda Barranco]], Villaronga directed ''99.99'' a horror film more in synch with his themes, and that won some awards in festivals specialized in fantastic cinema. In 2000, Villaronga came back with a project of his own: ''[[The Sea (2000 film)|El mar]]'', a story set in [[Mallorca]] about three former childhood friends, traumatized by the violence they experienced during the Spanish civil war, that are reunited ten years later as young adults in a sanitary of tubercular patiences. The key elements in Villaronga's filmography are present in this story: childhood, sexual awakening, homosexuality and violence.\n\nIn 2002, Villaronga  co-directed with [[Lydia Zimmermann]] and [[Lydia Zimmermann#Isaac Pierre Racine|Isaac Pierre Racine]] the film ''[[Aro Tolbukhin. En la mente del asesino|En la mente del asesino]]''. In 2005 he directed a music video for French superstar [[Myl\u00e8ne Farmer]]'s song ''[[Fuck Them All]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mylene.net/mylene/c_fuck-them-all.php|title=Mylene.Net - Le site r\u00e9f\u00e9rence sur Myl\u00e8ne Farmer|author =Julien AUTIER|author2 =Philippe LEZE|author3 =Guillaume DATEZ|author4 =Sarah HOFER|last-author-amp =yes|work=mylene.net|accessdate=30 March 2016}}</ref> In 2007 he made ''Despu\u00e9s de la lluvia'', a made for television project adapting a stage play. It was only until 2010 with ''Pa negre'', when Villaronga finally achieved wider appeal.

It is a natural harbor on the [[Malabar coast]], located 20&nbsp;km north-west of [[Kanyakumari (town)|Kanyakumari]] ([[Cape Comorin]]), the southernmost tip of India. As of 2011, the town had a population of 47,007.\n\n==History==\nColachel is an ancient port town, that [[Vasco da Gama]] called \u2018Colachi\u2019. Before the State re-organization in 1956, it was part of the [[Travancore State]]. After the defeat of the Dutch by King [[Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma]] in 1741, a victory pillar had been erected near the beach in commemoration of the victory.

It was the first time in [[History of India|Indian history]] that an Asian country defeated a [[Navy|European naval force]].<ref>[http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2202/stories/20050128006501300.htm The Hindu] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630210727/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2202/stories/20050128006501300.htm |date=30 June 2006 }} \u2014 A different battle at Colachal</ref>\n\nThe Dutch marines landed in Colachel with artillery and captured the land up to [[Padmanabhapuram]], then the capital of Travancore. The arrival of Marthanda Varma from the north forced the Dutch to take up defensive positions in Colachel, where they were attacked and defeated by the Travancore forces.  Twenty-eight high level Dutch officers, including Admiral D'lennoy, were captured.  The defeat of the Dutch in Colachael was the turning point of the [[Battle of Colachel|Travancore-Dutch War]]. D'lennoy went on to serve the Travancore kingdom for the next two decades and was promoted to the post of the ''Valiya kappithan'' (Senior Admiral) of the Travancore forces. He modernised the Travancore army, and built the ''Nedumkottai'', a line of fortifications in the north of the kingdom, which held up the army of [[Tipu Sultan]] in 1791, during his ill-fated invasion of Travancore. D'lennoy is buried in the [[Udayagiri Fort]], also known as ''Dillanai kottai'' (D'lennoy's fort) which is located 7&nbsp;kilometres north of Padmanabhapuram (about 14&nbsp;kilometres from [[Nagercoil]]).\n\n==Colachel Pillar==\n\nColachel is currently in the Kanya Kumari District of the [[Tamil Nadu]] State of India, and is an important port on the west coast of that state.

In the battle of Colachal, Capt. Eustace De Lannoy, the Dutch Naval Forces Commander, was captured. In order to commemorate this victory of the Travancore Army over the Dutch at Colachel, the Travancore Government installed '''The Colachel Pillar''' at the very spot where the Dutch had capitulated to the King of Travancore. The Colachel Pillar stands 17 feet high and has a radius of four feet.

In Colachel, it caused the death of around 500 people. As the land near the coastline is flat and at sea level with no seawall(Anti sea erosion), water travelled inland carving out new streams and estuaries. The waves were reported to be around 5m high and a run up height of 2.6m. Maximum number of casualties happened near the A.V.M. Canal as well as around the open trenches being used by the local coconut fibre industry.<ref>[http://www.iitk.ac.in/nicee/RP/2006_Effect_EQSpectra.pdf Effect of 2004 Tsunami pages S446-S447]</ref>  Colachel is said to be the last place(southwards) which is affected severely by tsunami.\n\nThe government and several non-governmental agencies have been providing relief works for those affected by the tsunami.\n\n==Folk Arts==\nThough the natives of Colachel do not earn a living by performing folk arts, several folk arts are being practised in temples and churches during the annual festivals. Ayya Narayana swamy Temples in Thiru Aadu Vassipu (Aakilathirattu Ammanai reading), Villupattu, Kaniankoothu, Thiruvathirai Kali, Kalial and Ottam Thullal are some of the folk arts performed during temple festivals. Most usually, rural artists and natives perform Kadhaprasangam, Natagam (drama), rural dances, etc. during the annual festivals of churches and temples.\n\n==Politics==\nColachel assembly constituency is part of [[Kanyakumari (Lok Sabha constituency)]] (previously Nagercoil).<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://archive.eci.gov.in/se2001/background/S22/TN_ACPC.pdf \n |title=List of Parliamentary and Assembly Constituencies \n |accessdate=2008-10-13 \n |work=Tamil Nadu \n |publisher=Election Commission of India \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031131000/http://archive.eci.gov.in/se2001/background/S22/TN_ACPC.pdf \n |archivedate=2008-10-31 \n}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Tamil Nadu}}\n{{Regions of Kanyakumari}}\n{{Municipalities of Tamil Nadu}}\n\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Kanyakumari district]]\n", "name_user": "Uziel302", "label": "safe", "comment": "Marticulation->Matriculation -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colachel"}

The [[Hall of Fame]] opened in 1999 in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], USA.<ref name=Grasso>{{cite book |last1=Grasso |first1=John |title=Historical Dictionary of Basketball |date=2010 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810875067 |page=453 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nZUarsZyzokC&pg=PA453 |language=en}}</ref>  It is the only facility of its kind dedicated to all levels of women's basketball.  Knoxville is known for having a large women's basketball following as well as being the home of the [[University of Tennessee]]'s [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|Lady Vols]] basketball team previously coached by women's coach [[Pat Summitt]], who was part of the first class inducted.  With the 2017 Induction, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame celebrated its 19th anniversary and added six new members to its hall, honoring 157 inductees.\n\nInductees may be nominated in the following categories: Coach, Veteran Coach, Player, International Player, Veteran Player, Contributor,  and Official.\n\n==Highlights==\n\n===Women's Basketball Hall of Fame campus===\nThe Women's Basketball Hall of Fame is home to the world's largest basketball sitting on the north rotunda of the hall, measuring 30 feet tall and weighing 10 tons.\n\nThe WBHOF Basketball Courts in the north rotunda of the hall allow one to test one's basketball skills on three different courts representing the hall's mission statement of \"honoring the past, celebrating the present, and promoting the future\" of women's basketball.  The courts also are home to a timed dribbling course and a passing skills area.  There is also a photo area where you can pretend to be players from different eras in history.\n\n====Pat Summitt Rotunda====\nPat Summitt Rotunda is located at the entrance of the WBHOF.  This area remembers founding board member and Class of 1999 inductee Pat Summitt.<ref>{{cite web |title=No Summitt anniversary at Women's Basketball Hall of Fame |url=https://www.wbir.com/article/news/local/no-summitt-anniversary-at-womens-basketball-hall-of-fame/51-452841991 |website=wbir.com |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe courtyard outside of the Pat Summitt Rotunda is shaped like a basketball and is made of numerous bricks with personalized inscriptions. Many of the bricks are engraved to honor guests, inductees and a host of other who have chosen to leave their legacy at the hall of fame.\n\n====Hall of Honor====\nThe Hall of Honor is the location within the Hall of Fame that recognizes the achievements of each of the inductees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitknoxville.com/listings/womens-basketball-hall-of-fame/127/|title=Women's Basketball Hall of Fame|website=www.visitknoxville.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-12}}</ref>\n\n====Eastman Statue====\nThe Eastman Statue, sculptured by Elizabeth MacQueen, is erected at the entrance to the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.  This 17-foot-tall bronze statue exemplifies Women's Basketball Hall of Fame's mission to \"honor the past, celebrate the present and promote the future: of women's basketball. Each year, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame presents its current class of Inductees with a replica of the Eastman statue, known as the \"Eastman\".\n\n===Trailblazers of the Game===\n\n====All American Red Heads====\nThe All American Red Heads played for 50 years, from 1936 to 1986 which is still the longest running women's professional team.  The Red Heads were founded by Mr. and Mrs.C. M. Olson in Cassville, Missouri.  C. M. Olson was the former coach-owner of a male exhibition basketball team called Olson's Terrible Swedes.  Known for their on-court antics, this inspired C. M. Olson's wife, Doyle, and the women who worked in her beauty salons to form a professional basketball exhibition team. In 1954, Coach Orwell Moore and his wife Lorene \"Butch\" Moore bought the Red heads and moved the team to Caraway, Arkansas. Lorene Moore played on the team for eleven years, scoring 35,426 points during her career. The Red Heads were so popular that during the years 1964-1971 there may have been as many as three Red Head teams traveling the country. In 1972, the Red Heads won 500 out of 642 games played against men's team. Throughout the years the All American Red Heads played in all 50 states as well as Mexico, Canada, and the Philippines. The team has been featured in national magazines such as Life, Look, Sports Illustrated and Women's Sports, and they were widely considered as the greatest women's basketball team in the world. Coach Moore retired and disbanded the Red Heads in 1986 after 50 years of play The All American Red Heads still have annual reunions today.\n\n====Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club====\nThe Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club was founded in 1915 by John Percy Page. The origins of the club can be traced to the McDougall Commercial Girls High School Basketball team in Edmonton, Canada. When team members graduated high school, they convinced coach John Percy Page to continue the team as a Club sport. Membership with the Club was exclusive, only 38 women ever wore the Grad jersey. Winnie Martin (Tait) was the First Captain of the Edmonton Grads, playing from 1915-1924. The Grads played 522 games officially in Canada, the United States and Europe. The Club tallied a 502-20 record in 25 years of play The Edmonton Commercial Graduates are widely considered the greatest women's team ever assembled. Financially restrained, members often chipped in to raise funds for national play. Their strong dedication to the game and will to persevere in a time when women's basketball was largely ignored makes the Edmonton Grads praiseworthy John Percy Page coached the club to 18 Canadian Championships The Club attended four sets of Olympic Games: Paris in 1924, Amsterdam in 1928, Los Angeles in 1932, and Berlin in 1936 where they received 4 unofficial Olympic titles The Club played its last game on June 5, 1940, defeating a Chicago team 62-52 Dr. James A. Naismith was quoted to say, \"There is no team that I mention more frequently in talking about the game. My admiration is not only for your remarkable record of games won (which itself would make you stand out in the history of basketball) but also for your record of clean play, versatility in meeting teams at their own style, and more especially for your unbroken record of good sportsmanship.\"\n\n====Wayland Baptist Flying Queens====\nClaude Hutcherson, a Wayland graduate and owner of Hutcherson Air Service, provided air transportation for the Queens to games in Mexico in 1948. That encounter blossomed into a full sponsorship of the team in 1950, a change that brought with it a new mascot - the Hutcherson Flying Queens. Five decades later, Wayland is still atop the world of women's basketball for they still remain the only women's team in history to win 1,300 games. Long before Connecticut became a dominant power in women's basketball, the Flying Queens of Wayland Baptist thrived on innovation, talent and glamour, playing on athletic scholarships, traveling by private planes, warming up with ostentatious drills learned from the Harlem Globetrotters and winning every game for nearly five seasons. The Wayland Baptist University women's team achieved a 131-game winning streak from November 1953 to March 1958 before losing 46-42 to Nashville Business School. During that time the Flying Queens captured four consecutive AAU national championships.\n\n====Mighty Macs====\nThe 1972-74 Mighty Macs team captured the first three Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) championships. Immaculata is considered the birthplace of modern college women's basketball. In addition, to winning the first three college national championships, the Mighty Macs were the first women's team along with the University of Maryland to appear on National television. They were also the first women's team, along with Queen's College, to play at Madison Square Garden. Their inspirational story was made into a feature-length theatrical movie called The Mighty Macs and released by Sony Pictures in 2011. The 1972-74 teams have produced 3 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams; Janet Ruch Boltz, Denise Conway Crawford, Janet Young Eline, [[Theresa Shank|Theresa Shank Grentz]] (Class of 2001), Barbara Deuble Kelly, Tina Krah, Patricia Mulhern Loughran, Judy Marra Martelli, Sue Forsyth O'Grady, Rene Muth Portland, Betty Ann Hoffman Quinn, [[Cathy Rush]] (Class of 2000), Mary Scharff, [[Marianne Stanley|Marianne Crawford Stanley]] (Class of 2002), Maureen Stuhlman, and Marie Liguori Williams.\n\n====Delta State teams====\nThe 1975, 1976, and 1977 Delta State teams captured three consecutive AIAW championships. After finishing 16\u20132 in the 1973-74 revival season following a 40-year layoff of the women's basketball program, Delta State proceeded to end Immaculata College's three-year AIAW national championship reign in season No. 2 by going undefeated at 28-0. Delta State followed its first AIAW national crown by also winning the next two as the Lady Statesmen defeated Immaculata (69-64) at Penn State and then LSU (68-55) at Minnesota. During their three championship years, Delta State compiled a 93-4 record (28-0, 33-1, 32-3), including a then-record 51 straight wins. The 1975-77 teams have produced 2 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame inductees, Margaret Wade and Lusia Harris Stewart. The WBCA Wade Trophy, considered the Heisman of women's basketball, is named in honor of Lily Margaret Wade. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams: Angel Fortenberry, Ann Logue, Beth Trussell, Cornelia Ward, Debbie Brock, Jackie Caston, Janie Evans, Jill Rhodes, Judy Davis, Kathy Lewis, Key Crump, Laurie Ann Harper, [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris Stewart]] (Class of 1999), Lynn Adubato, Mandy Fortenberyy, [[Margaret Wade]] (Class of 1999), Mary Logue, Melissa Thames, Melissa Ward, Mimi Williams, Pam Piazza, Romona Von Boeckman, Sheri Haynes, Tish Fahey, Virginia Shackelford, and Wanda Hairston.\n\n====USA Women's Basketball teams====\nThe 1976 USA Women's Basketball team captured the United States' first medal in Olympic women's basketball history winning the silver medal. The USA's silver medal finish served a notice to the rest of the world that the United States would be a force in Olympic women's basketball. Since the 1976 Olympics, the USA Women's Basketball Teams have compiled a record of 55 and 1 and captured 7 gold medals and 1 bronze in Olympic play. The 1976 USA Olympic Women's Basketball Team paved the way for United States dominance. The 1976 team has produced 11 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees.  [[Ann Meyers Drysdale]] (Class of 1999), [[Nancy Lieberman]] (Class of 1999), [[Billie Moore]] (Class of 1999), [[Pat Summitt]] (Class of 1999), Mary Anne O'Conner, [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris Stewart]] (Class of 1999), Gail Marquis, [[Nancy Dunkle]] (Class of 2000), [[Sue Gunter]] (Class of 2000), [[Patricia Roberts]] (Class of 2000), [[Sue Rojcewicz]] (Class of 2000), Charlotte Lewis, [[Juliene Simpson]] (Class of 2000), [[Cindy Brogdon]] (Class of 2002), Jeanne Rowlands, Gail Weldon.\n\nThe 1996 USA Olympic Basketball Team dominated its competition to reclaim the Olympic gold medal in Atlanta. Rolling to an 8-0 Olympic mark, the USA, which began training on October 2, 1995, compiled a 52-0 record during its pre-Olympic competition to finish with an overall 60-0 record. More popular than any previous women's basketball team, the USA drew a record 202,556 fans during the Olympics for an average of 25,320 a game.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The 1996 Olympic Team includes 10 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees.

The Panel met annually to vote on a National Champion and retroactively ranked basketball back to 1901. When Paul Helms died in 1957, United Savings and Loan became the Helms Foundation's benefactor and eventually became known as the Citizens Savings Athletic Foundation. The Foundation officially dissolved in 1982. Thirteen Helms Foundation members are also Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees: Alline Banks (Sprouse), Joan Crawford, Lyrlyne Greer, Rita Horkey, Doris Rogers, Margaret Sexton, Hazel Walker, Katherine Washington, Nera White, John Head, Claude Hutcherson, Harley Redin, and [[Lometa Odom]].\n\n==Inductees==\n\n===Class of 1999===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Senda Berenson Abbott|Senda Abbott]]\n* [[Lidia Alexeyeva]]\n* [[Carol Blazejowski]]<ref name=Grasso />\n* [[Joanne Bracker]]\n* [[Jody Conradt]]\n* [[Joan Crawford (basketball)|Joan Crawford]]\n* [[Denise Curry]]\n* [[Anne Donovan]]\n* [[Carol Eckman]]\n\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Betty Jo Graber]]\n* [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris-Stewart]]\n* [[John L.

The [[Hall of Fame]] opened in 1999 in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], USA.<ref name=Grasso>{{cite book |last1=Grasso |first1=John |title=Historical Dictionary of Basketball |date=2010 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810875067 |page=453 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nZUarsZyzokC&pg=PA453 |language=en}}</ref>  It is the only facility of its kind dedicated to all levels of women's basketball.  Knoxville is known for having a large women's basketball following as well as being the home of the [[University of Tennessee]]'s [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|Lady Vols]] basketball team previously coached by women's coach [[Pat Summitt]], who was part of the first class inducted.  With the 2017 Induction, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame celebrated its 19th anniversary and added six new members to its hall, honoring 157 inductees.\n\nInductees may be nominated in the following categories: Coach, Veteran Coach, Player, International Player, Veteran Player, Contributor,  and Official.\n\n==Highlights==\n\n===Women's Basketball Hall of Fame campus===\nThe Women's Basketball Hall of Fame is home to the world's largest basketball sitting on the north rotunda of the hall, measuring 30 feet tall and weighing 10 tons.\n\nThe WBHOF Basketball Courts in the north rotunda of the hall allow one to test one's basketball skills on three different courts representing the hall's mission statement of \"honoring the past, celebrating the present, and promoting the future\" of women's basketball.  The courts also are home to a timed dribbling course and a passing skills area.  There is also a photo area where you can pretend to be players from different eras in history.\n\n====Pat Summitt Rotunda====\nPat Summitt Rotunda is located at the entrance of the WBHOF.  This area remembers founding board member and Class of 1999 inductee Pat Summitt.<ref>{{cite web |title=No Summitt anniversary at Women's Basketball Hall of Fame |url=https://www.wbir.com/article/news/local/no-summitt-anniversary-at-womens-basketball-hall-of-fame/51-452841991 |website=wbir.com |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe courtyard outside of the Pat Summitt Rotunda is shaped like a basketball and is made of numerous bricks with personalized inscriptions. Many of the bricks are engraved to honor guests, inductees and a host of other who have chosen to leave their legacy at the hall of fame.\n\n====Hall of Honor====\nThe Hall of Honor is the location within the Hall of Fame that recognizes the achievements of each of the inductees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitknoxville.com/listings/womens-basketball-hall-of-fame/127/|title=Women's Basketball Hall of Fame|website=www.visitknoxville.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-12}}</ref>\n\n====Eastman Statue====\nThe Eastman Statue, sculptured by Elizabeth MacQueen, is erected at the entrance to the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.  This 17-foot-tall bronze statue exemplifies Women's Basketball Hall of Fame's mission to \"honor the past, celebrate the present and promote the future: of women's basketball. Each year, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame presents its current class of Inductees with a replica of the Eastman statue, known as the \"Eastman\".\n\n===Trailblazers of the Game===\n\n====All American Red Heads====\nThe All American Red Heads played for 50 years, from 1936 to 1986 which is still the longest running women's professional team.  The Red Heads were founded by Mr. and Mrs.C. M. Olson in Cassville, Missouri.  C. M. Olson was the former coach-owner of a male exhibition basketball team called Olson's Terrible Swedes.  Known for their on-court antics, this inspired C. M. Olson's wife, Doyle, and the women who worked in her beauty salons to form a professional basketball exhibition team. In 1954, Coach Orwell Moore and his wife Lorene \"Butch\" Moore bought the Red heads and moved the team to Caraway, Arkansas. Lorene Moore played on the team for eleven years, scoring 35,426 points during her career. The Red Heads were so popular that during the years 1964-1971 there may have been as many as three Red Head teams traveling the country. In 1972, the Red Heads won 500 out of 642 games played against men's team. Throughout the years the All American Red Heads played in all 50 states as well as Mexico, Canada, and the Philippines. The team has been featured in national magazines such as Life, Look, Sports Illustrated and Women's Sports, and they were widely considered as the greatest women's basketball team in the world. Coach Moore retired and disbanded the Red Heads in 1986 after 50 years of play The All American Red Heads still have annual reunions today.\n\n====Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club====\nThe Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club was founded in 1915 by John Percy Page. The origins of the club can be traced to the McDougall Commercial Girls High School Basketball team in Edmonton, Canada. When team members graduated high school, they convinced coach John Percy Page to continue the team as a Club sport. Membership with the Club was exclusive, only 38 women ever wore the Grad jersey. Winnie Martin (Tait) was the First Captain of the Edmonton Grads, playing from 1915-1924. The Grads played 522 games officially in Canada, the United States and Europe. The Club tallied a 502-20 record in 25 years of play The Edmonton Commercial Graduates are widely considered the greatest women's team ever assembled. Financially restrained, members often chipped in to raise funds for national play. Their strong dedication to the game and will to persevere in a time when women's basketball was largely ignored makes the Edmonton Grads praiseworthy John Percy Page coached the club to 18 Canadian Championships The Club attended four sets of Olympic Games: Paris in 1924, Amsterdam in 1928, Los Angeles in 1932, and Berlin in 1936 where they received 4 unofficial Olympic titles The Club played its last game on June 5, 1940, defeating a Chicago team 62-52 Dr. James A. Naismith was quoted to say, \"There is no team that I mention more frequently in talking about the game. My admiration is not only for your remarkable record of games won (which itself would make you stand out in the history of basketball) but also for your record of clean play, versatility in meeting teams at their own style, and more especially for your unbroken record of good sportsmanship.\"\n\n====Wayland Baptist Flying Queens====\nClaude Hutcherson, a Wayland graduate and owner of Hutcherson Air Service, provided air transportation for the Queens to games in Mexico in 1948. That encounter blossomed into a full sponsorship of the team in 1950, a change that brought with it a new mascot - the Hutcherson Flying Queens. Five decades later, Wayland is still atop the world of women's basketball for they still remain the only women's team in history to win 1,300 games. Long before Connecticut became a dominant power in women's basketball, the Flying Queens of Wayland Baptist thrived on innovation, talent and glamour, playing on athletic scholarships, traveling by private planes, warming up with ostentatious drills learned from the Harlem Globetrotters and winning every game for nearly five seasons. The Wayland Baptist University women's team achieved a 131-game winning streak from November 1953 to March 1958 before losing 46-42 to Nashville Business School. During that time the Flying Queens captured four consecutive AAU national championships.\n\n====Mighty Macs====\nThe 1972-74 Mighty Macs team captured the first three Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) championships. Immaculata is considered the birthplace of modern college women's basketball. In addition, to winning the first three college national championships, the Mighty Macs were the first women's team along with the University of Maryland to appear on National television. They were also the first women's team, along with Queen's College, to play at Madison Square Garden. Their inspirational story was made into a feature-length theatrical movie called The Mighty Macs and released by Sony Pictures in 2011. The 1972-74 teams have produced 3 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams; Janet Ruch Boltz, Denise Conway Crawford, Janet Young Eline, [[Theresa Shank|Theresa Shank Grentz]] (Class of 2001), Barbara Deuble Kelly, Tina Krah, Patricia Mulhern Loughran, Judy Marra Martelli, Sue Forsyth O'Grady, Rene Muth Portland, Betty Ann Hoffman Quinn, [[Cathy Rush]] (Class of 2000), Mary Scharff, [[Marianne Stanley|Marianne Crawford Stanley]] (Class of 2002), Maureen Stuhlman, and Marie Liguori Williams.\n\n====Delta State teams====\nThe 1975, 1976, and 1977 Delta State teams captured three consecutive AIAW championships. After finishing 16\u20132 in the 1973-74 revival season following a 40-year layoff of the women's basketball program, Delta State proceeded to end Immaculata College's three-year AIAW national championship reign in season No. 2 by going undefeated at 28-0. Delta State followed its first AIAW national crown by also winning the next two as the Lady Statesmen defeated Immaculata (69-64) at Penn State and then LSU (68-55) at Minnesota. During their three championship years, Delta State compiled a 93-4 record (28-0, 33-1, 32-3), including a then-record 51 straight wins. The 1975-77 teams have produced 2 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame inductees, Margaret Wade and Lusia Harris Stewart. The WBCA Wade Trophy, considered the Heisman of women's basketball, is named in honor of Lily Margaret Wade. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams: Angel Fortenberry, Ann Logue, Beth Trussell, Cornelia Ward, Debbie Brock, Jackie Caston, Janie Evans, Jill Rhodes, Judy Davis, Kathy Lewis, Key Crump, Laurie Ann Harper, [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris Stewart]] (Class of 1999), Lynn Adubato, Mandy Fortenberyy, [[Margaret Wade]] (Class of 1999), Mary Logue, Melissa Thames, Melissa Ward, Mimi Williams, Pam Piazza, Romona Von Boeckman, Sheri Haynes, Tish Fahey, Virginia Shackelford, and Wanda Hairston.\n\n====USA Women's Basketball teams====\nThe 1976 USA Women's Basketball team captured the United States' first medal in Olympic women's basketball history winning the silver medal. The USA's silver medal finish served a notice to the rest of the world that the United States would be a force in Olympic women's basketball. Since the 1976 Olympics, the USA Women's Basketball Teams have compiled a record of 55 and 1 and captured 7 gold medals and 1 bronze in Olympic play. The 1976 USA Olympic Women's Basketball Team paved the way for United States dominance. The 1976 team has produced 11 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees.  [[Ann Meyers Drysdale]] (Class of 1999), [[Nancy Lieberman]] (Class of 1999), [[Billie Moore]] (Class of 1999), [[Pat Summitt]] (Class of 1999), Mary Anne O'Conner, [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris Stewart]] (Class of 1999), Gail Marquis, [[Nancy Dunkle]] (Class of 2000), [[Sue Gunter]] (Class of 2000), [[Patricia Roberts]] (Class of 2000), [[Sue Rojcewicz]] (Class of 2000), Charlotte Lewis, [[Juliene Simpson]] (Class of 2000), [[Cindy Brogdon]] (Class of 2002), Jeanne Rowlands, Gail Weldon.\n\nThe 1996 USA Olympic Basketball Team dominated its competition to reclaim the Olympic gold medal in Atlanta. Rolling to an 8-0 Olympic mark, the USA, which began training on October 2, 1995, compiled a 52-0 record during its pre-Olympic competition to finish with an overall 60-0 record. More popular than any previous women's basketball team, the USA drew a record 202,556 fans during the Olympics for an average of 25,320 a game.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The 1996 Olympic Team includes 10 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees.

The Panel met annually to vote on a National Champion and retroactively ranked basketball back to 1901. When Paul Helms died in 1957, United Savings and Loan became the Helms Foundation's benefactor and eventually became known as the Citizens Savings Athletic Foundation. The Foundation officially dissolved in 1982. Thirteen Helms Foundation members are also Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees: Alline Banks (Sprouse), Joan Crawford, Lyrlyne Greer, Rita Horkey, Doris Rogers, Margaret Sexton, Hazel Walker, Katherine Washington, Nera White, John Head, Claude Hutcherson, Harley Redin, and [[Lometa Odom]].\n\n==Inductees==\n\n===Class of 1999===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Senda Berenson Abbott|Senda Abbott]]\n* [[Lidia Alexeyeva]]\n* [[Carol Blazejowski]]<ref name=Grasso />\n* [[Joanne Bracker]]\n* [[Jody Conradt]]\n* [[Joan Crawford (basketball)|Joan Crawford]]\n* [[Denise Curry]]\n* [[Anne Donovan]]\n* [[Carol Eckman]]\n\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Betty Jo Graber]]\n* [[Lusia Harris|Lusia Harris-Stewart]]\n* [[John L.
