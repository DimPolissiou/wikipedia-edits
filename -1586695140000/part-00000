Founded in 1515 as a free [[grammar school]] next to [[Manchester Cathedral|Manchester Parish Church]],<ref name=\"Bentley\">{{cite book |last=Bentley |first= James |title=Dare to be wise: a history of The Manchester Grammar School|publisher=James and James|year= 1990 |isbn= 0-907383-04-1}}</ref><ref name=\"Mumford\">{{Cite book|last=Mumford|first=Alfred Alexander|title=The Manchester Grammar School, 1515\u20131915: A Regional Study of the Advancement of Learning in Manchester Since the Reformation|publisher=BiblioBazaar|year=2010|isbn=1-143-58385-X}}</ref>  it moved in 1931 to its present site at [[Fallowfield]]. In accordance with its founder's wishes, MGS has remained a predominantly academic school and belongs to the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]].\n\nIn the post-war period, MGS was a [[direct-grant grammar school]]. It chose to become an independent school in 1976 after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] abolished the Direct Grant System.<ref>{{cite hansard | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1978/mar/22/direct-grant-schools | house=House of Commons | date=22 March 1978 |title=Direct Grant Schools |speaker=Miss Margaret Jackson |position=[[Under-Secretary of State]] | column_start=582W | column_end=586W }}</ref>  Fees for 2016\u20132017 were \u00a311,970 per annum.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mgs.org/209/fees-and-assistance |title=Fees and Assistance |publisher=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Motto, coat of arms and school badges==\n[[File:Sapere avde.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sapere Aude]], the Manchester Grammar School school motto]]\n\nThe school's [[motto]] is ''[[wikt:sapere aude|Sapere Aude]]'' (\"Dare to be Wise\"), which was also the motto of the [[County Borough Council|council]] of the former [[County Borough of Oldham]] (now, with the same coat of arms, the [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham]]),<ref name=\"Bentley\"/> granted on 7 November 1894. ''Sapere aude'' is a quotation from [[Horace]], famously used by [[Immanuel Kant]] and also the motto of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref name=\"COA\">{{cite web|title=The Coat of Arms|url=https://www.mgsarchives.org/the-coat-of-arms|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Senior School badge is an outline of an owl, carrying a banner with the word \"dom\" on it. This is a [[Canting arms|heraldic \"canting\"]] reference to its founder, Hugh Oldham, and the badge should be read as \"owl-dom\". This suggests that he pronounced his name, as the local accent in Oldham still tends to do, as \"Ow[l]dem\". Owls are also to be seen in the shield of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham|Borough of Oldham]].<ref name=\"COA\" />\n\nThere is possibly a second significance to the \"dom\" of which Hugh Oldham, as a bishop, would have been very well aware. D.O.M. was and is a standard abbreviation for ''Deo Optimo Maximo'' meaning \"To God, the Best and the Greatest\", a phrase of dedication often required to be written by schoolboys before the Reformation and in Roman Catholic education since, at the head of a new piece of work, a practice continued into adult life by many as they committed a new undertaking into God's hands. This badge replaced the original one when the school colours changed from red, black and yellow to dark and light blue to reflect its connection with the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nThe Junior School badge, which depicts the face of an owl, was introduced to blazers and ties in 2008.<ref name=\"COA\" />\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\n[[Image:HrXhrm6hrs580h9.JPG|upright|right|thumb|A drawing of the Chetham's Gatehouse circa 1600.]]\nThe founder, Hugh Oldham, a Manchester-born man, attended [[Exeter College, Oxford]] and [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], after having been tutored in the house of [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby]]. Historical accounts suggest that he was not a particularly learned man, but was in Royal service, being a favoured prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Lady Margaret Beaufort|Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby]], mother of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], and became recognised for his administrative abilities. He was appointed [[Bishop of Exeter]] in 1505. His great wealth came from his water-powered corn mills on the [[River Irk]] near Manchester, which were subsequently used to fund the school's endowment.\n\nOn 2 July 1515 he signed an endowment trust deed establishing the Manchester Free Grammar School for Lancashire Boys. A site was purchased in September 1516 and construction took place between April 1517 and August 1518. The combined cost was \u00a3218.13s.5d, largely given by Oldham, but with the help of his and the Bexwyke (Beswick) family who had provided an earlier endowment for a school within the parish church. A more elaborate deed in 1525 set the detailed rules for the school until the late 19th century.\n\nThe original deed promoted \"Godliness and good learning\" and established that any boy showing sufficient academic ability, regardless of background, might attend, free of charge. The school was situated between [[Manchester Cathedral]], then a collegiate church, and the church's domestic quarters, subsequently [[Chetham's School of Music]].\n\nLater, Oldham's great friend [[Richard Foxe]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]], wished to found a monastery. Oldham, however, convinced him instead to found [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]] in Oxford and contributed 6000 marks. Oldham also had a hand in the founding of [[Brasenose College, Oxford]].\n\n===Early history===\nThe original foundation provided a school house in the curtilage of Manchester's Parish Church and two graduates (the 'High Master' and the 'Usher') to teach Latin and later Greek, to any children who presented themselves. The school was intended to prepare pupils for university and eventually the Church or the legal profession. Typically, pupils would have stayed for 8 to 10 years before leaving for university. There was often enough money to fund bursaries or exhibitions for pupils.\n\nIn 1654, the world's first free public library was formed next door to MGS in what had been the church's living quarters. This was facilitated by a bequest from a wealthy businessman (and ex-pupil) [[Humphrey Chetham]], which also served to create a [[Charity school|bluecoat]] orphanage there, schooling 40 poor boys.\n\nBy the 18th century, there are thought to have been between 50 and 100 boys in the grammar school at any one time, three or four of whom each year were awarded exhibitions to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. An extra room had been built onto the school house for boys who needed instruction in English before they started [[Latin]], and another master was employed to teach them.\n\n[[File:Manchester Grammar School class in 1908.jpg|thumb|right|Classroom at the old site]]\nThe 1515 building was replaced on the same site in 1776. This was on two levels, an Upper School for the Latin and Greek pupils, a Lower School for the English pupils. Boarding-houses were added and many of the Upper School pupils were boarders from surrounding counties. When De Quincy came as a boarder in 1800, classes were held at roughly 7.00am to 9.00, 9.30 to 12.00 and 3.00pm to 5.00.<ref>Most of the material in the first part of this section is taken from ''The Manchester Grammar School 1515\u20131965'', edited by J A Graham and B A Phythian (both of whom were members of the school's teaching staff at the time), Manchester University Press, 1965</ref>\n\nBy 1808 consideration was being given to moving from the site, as it was becoming insalubrious, but this proved impossible as the deed could not be changed except by Act of Parliament.\n\n<blockquote>\nGoing from the Old Church to Long Millgate&nbsp;... one is in an almost undisguised working men's quarter, for even the shops and beerhouses hardly take the trouble to exhibit a trifling degree of cleanliness&nbsp;... [The Irk, immediately beside the school,] is a narrow, coal black, foul smelling stream full of debris and refuse.<ref>[[Engels]], quoted in ''MGS 1515\u20131965'' referenced above</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Image:Chethams manchester exterior.jpg|right|thumb|Manchester Grammar extension built in the 1870s (The old site)]]\nA commercial school, in parallel with the classical school, and more suited to Manchester's business climate, was established in the 1830s. By this time the school was getting richer on the proceeds of the mills which provided its funding and had a growing surplus on account. Its 'feoffees' (or governors) were mostly landed gentry from outside Manchester and they were heavily criticised for running the school to suit the needs of their offspring rather than as originally intended, the poor of Manchester. This led to a long running suit at the Court of Chancery, which eventually promoted the commercial side at the expense of the classical side of the school.\n\nThe area around the school continued to change. During the 1840s, [[Manchester Victoria station|Victoria railway station]] was completed opposite the school and the church became [[Manchester Cathedral]]. Then, in the 1870s, a new building, the Manchester Grammar Extension, was built, designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]], and including new classrooms, laboratories and a gymnasium, reflecting the wider curriculum that had developed since the 1830s. It was connected to the original by a first-storey bridge. It was said that the bridge's purpose was not for ease of movement between the parts of the school, but rather to dwarf Chetham's gatehouse both in terms of size and grandeur.\n\nThe tenure of [[Michael George Glazebrook]] as High Master, beginning in 1888, saw the introduction of three changes according to pupil [[Ernest Barker]]: a system of [[prefects#Academic|prefects]] to keep order, the singing of [[school song]]s conducted by [[John Farmer (1835-1901)|John Farmer]], and the wearing of school-caps and school-hats.<ref>[[Ernest Barker]] (1953) ''Age and Youth'', page 267, [[Oxford University Press]]</ref>\n\n===Recent history===\nBy the early 20th century the school was increasingly receiving funding from the state. This was negligible in 1901, fees providing three quarters of the income, most of the remainder being from the foundation. But by 1931, state grants contributed nearly 30% of the total, and the number of pupils had increased to 1,100.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nIn 1930 the school moved out of the [[Manchester city centre|city centre]] to accommodate a growing pupil body and provide a wider range of facilities. The new location chosen was in [[Rusholme]], off Old Hall Lane, where the school still stands today.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nBoth of the school's earlier buildings lay empty, and while the former was destroyed in the [[Second World War]], the latter, renamed the Long Millgate Building, became a teacher training college in the 1950s. In 1969, [[Chetham's School of Music]] was founded and occupied what had been the orphanage. When the teacher training college closed in 1978, Chetham's took over the premises.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nAfter the [[Education Act 1944]], MGS became a [[direct grant grammar school]], which meant that the bulk of funding was provided by government. Entry was by merit (based on examination) and parents were means-tested and fees paid primarily by local education authorities on a sliding scale. Fees paid by parents amounted to less than 20% of the total income. It reverted to independent status in 1976 after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] \u2013 in the person of Education Secretary [[Shirley Williams]] \u2013 abolished the direct-grant funding system. Bursaries continue to support the merit based recruitment system, by abating fees for less well off pupils.<ref>Figures from ''MGS 1515\u20131965'' referenced above</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Assisted Places Scheme]] was rescinded in the late 1990s, MGS was the first school to react with a seminal \"Bursary Appeal\", whose patron is [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]. The appeal has accumulated a value of over \u00a317.5m and finances bursaries, given to boys whose parents are unable to afford the school fees (currently \u00a312,930 per annum). Scholarships are not awarded.\n\nIn 2015 the school walked 500 miles to celebrate its 500 years anniversary. Boys and teachers were asked to raise money for the \"Bursary Appeal\" and walk a mile each. Over 240 pupils currently receive help from the fund.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fees and Assistance - The Manchester Grammar School|url = http://www.mgs.org/209/fees-and-assistance|website = www.mgs.org|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}</ref>\n<!-- (by which one quarter of the places were directly funded by central government with the rest attracting fees, some paid by the Local Education Authority, some by private pupils and a few funded by so-called Foundation Scholarships awarded on the basis of performance in the school entrance examinations).-->\n\n== Buildings ==\n=== Main building ===\n[[Image:MGS Main Building in Snow.jpg|right|thumb|MGS main building in 2007]]\nThe main building was designed in 1929 by Francis Jones and [[Percy Worthington]]. In keeping with the style of Oxbridge, it features a quadrangle and a grandiose Memorial Hall. Entrance to the quad is by a tripartite arch under a clock tower cupola. There is also the Paton Library (named after J.L. Paton, a former High Master), MGS Archive Room (formerly the Alan Garner Junior Library, which has since become part of the Paton Library), Common Room, Refectory, Medical Centre, Book Shop, Gymnasium and Swimming Pool. This is in addition to classrooms (subjects taught in this building are Art and Design, Mathematics, Economics, Classical Civilisation, Computing, Greek, History, Latin, Religion and Philosophy) and administrative offices. The MGS Theatre has recently undergone extensive rebuilding, to provide a modern and comfortable auditorium, together with studios for rehearsals and drama teaching. The Drama Centre Campaign is chaired by Sir [[Nicholas Hytner]] (Director of the National Theatre and a former pupil) who brought [[Alan Bennett]] and the actors from ''[[The History Boys]]'' to launch the campaign in 2006.\n\nThe main building also houses the Parker Art Hall which is a three-storey arts studio, situated in the south side of the main building. It is named after former High Master J.G. Parker. It includes a ceramics department with two kilns on the ground floor and also a dark room for photography.\n\nSince opening in 1931 the site at Fallowfield has seen many additions to the accommodation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==== Mason building ====\nThis is the school's language department, named after P.G. Mason, a former High Master, during whose tenure the building was erected. On the ground floor there are the Language Labs, two suites of listening stations, mainly used to practise the listening parts of national exams. This building was originally the school's Sixth Form block, and was built in 1966\u201367. The foundation stone was laid by the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] on the occasion of her visit in 1965. By 1970 the shoddiness of the workmanship and materials used was revealed by the cracks which had already started appearing in the internal walls. It is joined to the main building on the ground floor by the Paton Library.\n\n==== Marks building ====\nNamed after former pupil [[Simon Marks]] son of Michael Marks, founder of the [[Marks & Spencer]] empire. It is just west of the main building, and was erected in 1958. Major extensions were made by addition of the first floor (after a gift of \u00a350,000 from Lord Marks) and the [[Israel Sieff, Baron Sieff|Israel Sieff]] Lecture Theatre (after a gift of \u00a35,000 from Lord Marks' brother-in-law), which were opened on 19 September 1962.<ref>Ulula Autumn 1962</ref> It currently hosts the following departments: Physics, General Science (taken by Year 7 and 8 pupils \u2013 before the subject splits into the usual three divisions), Geography, Computing and Mathematics. There are five physics laboratories, including one for radioactive experimentation, on the ground floor. The main computer room is situated on the first floor of the Marks building.\n\n====Theatres and drama  ====\nSieff Theatre is named after former pupil, [[Israel Sieff]], is situated at the end of the Marks Building and was refurbished in 2006; it is used for lectures and assemblies, as well as being the venue to Muslim Friday prayers. The school has replaced its original Lecture Theatre with a new Drama Centre. This was opened in November 2010.\n\n==== Sports hall and rectory building====\nThe Michael Atherton Sports Hall was opened by [[Mike Atherton]] (a former pupil) in 1997 and subsequently used by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra in recording of a live CD. The sports hall was severely damaged in a gale in February 2014 and had to be demolished. There are also 2 squash courts adjacent to the sports hall. The former rectory of St James's Birch-in-Rusholme (the adjacent redundant church) it is located near the Sports Hall, and is the home of the Biology Department. However, only A-level biology is taught there. A new sports hall was opened in 2016.<ref name=\"new sports hall\">{{cite web|title=Ex-England cricket captain Mike Atherton returns to Manchester Grammar School to open new sports hall|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/mike-atherton-cricket-manchester-grammar-10482508|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Music school ====\nLocated at the rear of the school, it is the building where the music department is based. There is a music library in the basement as well as a dozen or so music practice rooms, each having a piano, used for private lessons. It contains a keyboard suite allowing first and second years to learn basic keyboard playing and a hall on the west side used primarily for orchestra rehearsals. The original part of the building where the practice rooms are now located had been used in the 1950s and '60s as a bicycle shed.<ref>Len Brown, Old Mancunian, 1952\u201358</ref>\n\n=== Junior School buildings ===\n[[File:MGS Bexwyke Lodge.jpg|thumb|Bexwyke Lodge]]\nIn September 2008, MGS opened a Junior School for pupils in Years 5 and 6 and its doors open to Years 3 and 4 in September 2011; boys entering the Junior School do not sit an entrance exam but attend an assessment day and gain automatic admission into Year 7. The Junior School buildings are both state-of-the-art timber buildings, constructed from sustainable materials imported from [[Estonia]].\n\nJunior School pupils in Years 3, 4 and 5 are located in Plessyngton Lodge. Year 6 pupils work in Bexwyke Lodge, and 1 class of year 5 previously worked in Bexyke Lodge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=360&Itemid=320 |title=Bexwyke and Plessyngton Lodges |publisher=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=28 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mgs.org/the-mgs-junior-school/the-lodges |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140328180304/http://mgs.org/the-mgs-junior-school/the-lodges |archivedate=28 March 2014 |title=The Lodges |work=The Manchester Grammar School |year=2015 |accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Outdoor Study and Pursuits Centres===\nThe school owns the '''Owls' Nest''', a large hut situated in [[Disley]], south of Manchester, near to [[Lyme Park]]. The original ex-Army hut was opened at Christmas 1920, but it was destroyed by a [[Manchester Blitz|German bomb on 23 December 1940]], and a replacement was provided in 1950.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121&Itemid=116 |title=Owls' Nest page |work=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=6 October 2010}}</ref> The building is used by forms and activity groups of the school as a base for outdoor trips and camping expeditions. It is most frequently used by classes in Years 7 and 8, who spend a weekend there with their form teacher and form prefects. Wide games such as \"British Bulldog\" take place in the surrounding fields, and [[orienteering]] challenges in nearby Lyme Park. It is also used by school clubs such as the MGS Astronomical Society who use it for observational weekends because it is away from the lights of Manchester. The name refers to the school's logo of the owl.\n\nThere are four annual '''School Camps''', which have been in existence for many decades. They are held at [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], [[River Wye|Wye (Herefordshire)]], [[Bassenthwaite]] and [[Borrowdale]]. In Grasmere, the school has its own campsite donated by Old Mancunians in 1931. Visits to camps take part in the annual Activities Week, which is a week in which an impressive array of co-curricular activities are on offer to pupils.\n\nIn 2009 MGS opened the Old School House, its new outdoor study and pursuits centre in [[Kirkby Stephen]], Cumbria. Set on a hillside with stunning views of the [[Vale of Eden]] and the [[Lake District]] [[fell]]s, the facility offers opportunities such as [[The Duke of Edinburgh's Award|D of E expeditions]], choral and concert practice, art workshops and courses on the Theory of Knowledge. The purchase of the Old School House was partially financed by Old Mancunian, John Young and his wife Elizabeth.\n\n==School organisation==\n===Academic life===\nThe school was among the first in the UK to adopt the International Mathematics GCSE.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Soon afterwards, MGS also adopted the three Sciences and today it offers the IGCSE in most subjects. The main difference between IGCSE and GCSE is that the [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education|IGCSE]] does not have a compulsory coursework element, primarily because it would be too costly to moderate around the world. The maths and science departments decided that pupils were finding the coursework (which forms a fifth of the marks awarded in the national GCSE) undemanding and tedious and so made the switch in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4745367.stm|title=School drops 'tedious' maths GCSE|work=BBC News|date=4 August 2005}}</ref> In 2009 the GCSE was replaced by the IGCSE in most subjects (see below). At the same time the school began to offer additional GCSEs in Electronics and Mandarin Chinese, as well as Economics at A Level. \n\nSubjects available at GCSE/IGCSE are:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/175/academic-departments|title=Academic Departments - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n* Art and Design (GCSE)\n* Biology\n* Chemistry\n* Classical Civilisation (GCSE)\n* Classical Greek (GCSE)\n* Computer Science\n* Drama (GCSE)\n* English Language\n* English Literature\n* Electronics (GCSE)\n* Geography\n* History\n* Latin (GCSE)\n* Mathematics & Further Mathematics (GCSE)\n* Modern Languages (French, Spanish, Italian, German, Russian (GCSE), Mandarin Chinese (GCSE))\n* Music\n* Physics\n* Religious Studies\n\nAll the above subjects are available as Post-16 Qualifications (A-Level, International A-Level or Pre-U) as well as Politics and Economics.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe school is known for its outstanding academic results. In 2017 91% of all A-Level grades were A*-B and at GCSE/IGCSE 68% of all grades were at the A* level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/177/results|title=Results - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n===Community Action===\nVolunteering or \"Community Action\" at the school is an important part of school life. Pupils visit many primary schools in less fortunate areas during their lunch breaks to help younger children to read. Every Christmas, presents donated by the local community are distributed by MGS pupils in [[City of Salford|Salford]] to families who would otherwise not be able to afford presents for their children. During sixth form options, some pupils hold a coffee morning at a residential care home for the elderly in Salford. Other activities include paired reading at primary schools, distribution of food at Harvest and gifts at Christmas in deprived areas of Salford, visiting the elderly, teaching English as an additional language, recycling schemes, gardening, working with specialist schools or volunteering at the [[Chinatown, Manchester|Manchester Chinese Centre]] and many more. Lots of MGS boys take part in the Millennium Volunteers V scheme (now 'Vinvolved') and receive certificates for logging their volunteering activities. There are plans for many more community action projects, including the launching of a new Community Action website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/188/service|title=Service - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n===Partnerships with local schools===\nTwo girls' schools are situated nearby: [[Manchester High School for Girls]] and [[Withington Girls' School]]. MGS often collaborates with them particularly in music and drama events.\n\nIn 2013 the school founded in partnership with [[Manchester City Council]] and [[Urban Splash]], [[New Islington]] Free School.\n\n===Partnerships in Africa===\nMGS is also twinned with a school in [[Uganda]]. MGS became linked with the [[Busoga College|Busoga College Mwiri]] in 1990 as a consequence of their support for the Busoga Trust. The school donated second-hand science equipment, textbooks and, in 1998, equipped the Mwiri computer centre with almost one hundred PCs. A succession of MGS pupils have been to Mwiri to teach for a term in their gap year and five members of MGS staff and the School Medical Officer have made a combined total of over 20 visits to Mwiri. Some of MGS's pupils first formers (year 7) visited the college in 2003. In return Chairmen of Governors, Headmasters and Deputy Heads from Mwiri have visited MGS. A programme has been initiated to enable one member of the Mwiri staff each year to visit MGS for three weeks in September. This scheme was the brainchild of former Head of Physics, Roger Hand, who retired in 2008.\n\n==Publications==\nThere are three publications focusing on the school.\n\n'''''Ulula''''' is an annual full-colour magazine detailing life at MGS during the year. It contains a comprehensive review of activities of the societies, results achieved by the sports teams, dramatic and musical performances, as well as a selection of literary and fine art work made by the boys. It also serves to announce new appointments, retirements and departures of staff members.

In accordance with its founder's wishes, MGS has remained a predominantly academic school and belongs to the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]].\n\nIn the post-war period, MGS was a [[direct-grant grammar school]]. It chose to become an independent school in 1976 after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] abolished the Direct Grant System.<ref>{{cite hansard | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1978/mar/22/direct-grant-schools | house=House of Commons | date=22 March 1978 |title=Direct Grant Schools |speaker=Miss Margaret Jackson |position=[[Under-Secretary of State]] | column_start=582W | column_end=586W }}</ref>  Fees for 2016\u20132017 were \u00a311,970 per annum.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mgs.org/209/fees-and-assistance |title=Fees and Assistance |publisher=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Motto, coat of arms and school badges==\n[[File:Sapere avde.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sapere Aude]], the Manchester Grammar School school motto]]\n\nThe school's [[motto]] is ''[[wikt:sapere aude|Sapere Aude]]'' (\"Dare to be Wise\"), which was also the motto of the [[County Borough Council|council]] of the former [[County Borough of Oldham]] (now, with the same coat of arms, the [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham]]),<ref name=\"Bentley\"/> granted on 7 November 1894. ''Sapere aude'' is a quotation from [[Horace]], famously used by [[Immanuel Kant]] and also the motto of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref name=\"COA\">{{cite web|title=The Coat of Arms|url=https://www.mgsarchives.org/the-coat-of-arms|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Senior School badge is an outline of an owl, carrying a banner with the word \"dom\" on it. This is a [[Canting arms|heraldic \"canting\"]] reference to its founder, Hugh Oldham, and the badge should be read as \"owl-dom\". This suggests that he pronounced his name, as the local accent in Oldham still tends to do, as \"Ow[l]dem\". Owls are also to be seen in the shield of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham|Borough of Oldham]].<ref name=\"COA\" />\n\nThere is possibly a second significance to the \"dom\" of which Hugh Oldham, as a bishop, would have been very well aware. D.O.M. was and is a standard abbreviation for ''Deo Optimo Maximo'' meaning \"To God, the Best and the Greatest\", a phrase of dedication often required to be written by schoolboys before the Reformation and in Roman Catholic education since, at the head of a new piece of work, a practice continued into adult life by many as they committed a new undertaking into God's hands. This badge replaced the original one when the school colours changed from red, black and yellow to dark and light blue to reflect its connection with the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nThe Junior School badge, which depicts the face of an owl, was introduced to blazers and ties in 2008.<ref name=\"COA\" />\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\n[[Image:HrXhrm6hrs580h9.JPG|upright|right|thumb|A drawing of the Chetham's Gatehouse circa 1600.]]\nThe founder, Hugh Oldham, a Manchester-born man, attended [[Exeter College, Oxford]] and [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], after having been tutored in the house of [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby]]. Historical accounts suggest that he was not a particularly learned man, but was in Royal service, being a favoured prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Lady Margaret Beaufort|Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby]], mother of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], and became recognised for his administrative abilities. He was appointed [[Bishop of Exeter]] in 1505. His great wealth came from his water-powered corn mills on the [[River Irk]] near Manchester, which were subsequently used to fund the school's endowment.\n\nOn 2 July 1515 he signed an endowment trust deed establishing the Manchester Free Grammar School for Lancashire Boys. A site was purchased in September 1516 and construction took place between April 1517 and August 1518. The combined cost was \u00a3218.13s.5d, largely given by Oldham, but with the help of his and the Bexwyke (Beswick) family who had provided an earlier endowment for a school within the parish church. A more elaborate deed in 1525 set the detailed rules for the school until the late 19th century.\n\nThe original deed promoted \"Godliness and good learning\" and established that any boy showing sufficient academic ability, regardless of background, might attend, free of charge. The school was situated between [[Manchester Cathedral]], then a collegiate church, and the church's domestic quarters, subsequently [[Chetham's School of Music]].\n\nLater, Oldham's great friend [[Richard Foxe]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]], wished to found a monastery. Oldham, however, convinced him instead to found [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]] in Oxford and contributed 6000 marks. Oldham also had a hand in the founding of [[Brasenose College, Oxford]].\n\n===Early history===\nThe original foundation provided a school house in the curtilage of Manchester's Parish Church and two graduates (the 'High Master' and the 'Usher') to teach Latin and later Greek, to any children who presented themselves. The school was intended to prepare pupils for university and eventually the Church or the legal profession. Typically, pupils would have stayed for 8 to 10 years before leaving for university. There was often enough money to fund bursaries or exhibitions for pupils.\n\nIn 1654, the world's first free public library was formed next door to MGS in what had been the church's living quarters. This was facilitated by a bequest from a wealthy businessman (and ex-pupil) [[Humphrey Chetham]], which also served to create a [[Charity school|bluecoat]] orphanage there, schooling 40 poor boys.\n\nBy the 18th century, there are thought to have been between 50 and 100 boys in the grammar school at any one time, three or four of whom each year were awarded exhibitions to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. An extra room had been built onto the school house for boys who needed instruction in English before they started [[Latin]], and another master was employed to teach them.\n\n[[File:Manchester Grammar School class in 1908.jpg|thumb|right|Classroom at the old site]]\nThe 1515 building was replaced on the same site in 1776. This was on two levels, an Upper School for the Latin and Greek pupils, a Lower School for the English pupils. Boarding-houses were added and many of the Upper School pupils were boarders from surrounding counties. When De Quincy came as a boarder in 1800, classes were held at roughly 7.00am to 9.00, 9.30 to 12.00 and 3.00pm to 5.00.<ref>Most of the material in the first part of this section is taken from ''The Manchester Grammar School 1515\u20131965'', edited by J A Graham and B A Phythian (both of whom were members of the school's teaching staff at the time), Manchester University Press, 1965</ref>\n\nBy 1808 consideration was being given to moving from the site, as it was becoming insalubrious, but this proved impossible as the deed could not be changed except by Act of Parliament.\n\n<blockquote>\nGoing from the Old Church to Long Millgate&nbsp;... one is in an almost undisguised working men's quarter, for even the shops and beerhouses hardly take the trouble to exhibit a trifling degree of cleanliness&nbsp;... [The Irk, immediately beside the school,] is a narrow, coal black, foul smelling stream full of debris and refuse.<ref>[[Engels]], quoted in ''MGS 1515\u20131965'' referenced above</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Image:Chethams manchester exterior.jpg|right|thumb|Manchester Grammar extension built in the 1870s (The old site)]]\nA commercial school, in parallel with the classical school, and more suited to Manchester's business climate, was established in the 1830s. By this time the school was getting richer on the proceeds of the mills which provided its funding and had a growing surplus on account. Its 'feoffees' (or governors) were mostly landed gentry from outside Manchester and they were heavily criticised for running the school to suit the needs of their offspring rather than as originally intended, the poor of Manchester. This led to a long running suit at the Court of Chancery, which eventually promoted the commercial side at the expense of the classical side of the school.\n\nThe area around the school continued to change. During the 1840s, [[Manchester Victoria station|Victoria railway station]] was completed opposite the school and the church became [[Manchester Cathedral]]. Then, in the 1870s, a new building, the Manchester Grammar Extension, was built, designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]], and including new classrooms, laboratories and a gymnasium, reflecting the wider curriculum that had developed since the 1830s. It was connected to the original by a first-storey bridge. It was said that the bridge's purpose was not for ease of movement between the parts of the school, but rather to dwarf Chetham's gatehouse both in terms of size and grandeur.\n\nThe tenure of [[Michael George Glazebrook]] as High Master, beginning in 1888, saw the introduction of three changes according to pupil [[Ernest Barker]]: a system of [[prefects#Academic|prefects]] to keep order, the singing of [[school song]]s conducted by [[John Farmer (1835-1901)|John Farmer]], and the wearing of school-caps and school-hats.<ref>[[Ernest Barker]] (1953) ''Age and Youth'', page 267, [[Oxford University Press]]</ref>\n\n===Recent history===\nBy the early 20th century the school was increasingly receiving funding from the state. This was negligible in 1901, fees providing three quarters of the income, most of the remainder being from the foundation. But by 1931, state grants contributed nearly 30% of the total, and the number of pupils had increased to 1,100.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nIn 1930 the school moved out of the [[Manchester city centre|city centre]] to accommodate a growing pupil body and provide a wider range of facilities. The new location chosen was in [[Rusholme]], off Old Hall Lane, where the school still stands today.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nBoth of the school's earlier buildings lay empty, and while the former was destroyed in the [[Second World War]], the latter, renamed the Long Millgate Building, became a teacher training college in the 1950s. In 1969, [[Chetham's School of Music]] was founded and occupied what had been the orphanage. When the teacher training college closed in 1978, Chetham's took over the premises.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nAfter the [[Education Act 1944]], MGS became a [[direct grant grammar school]], which meant that the bulk of funding was provided by government. Entry was by merit (based on examination) and parents were means-tested and fees paid primarily by local education authorities on a sliding scale. Fees paid by parents amounted to less than 20% of the total income. It reverted to independent status in 1976 after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] \u2013 in the person of Education Secretary [[Shirley Williams]] \u2013 abolished the direct-grant funding system. Bursaries continue to support the merit based recruitment system, by abating fees for less well off pupils.<ref>Figures from ''MGS 1515\u20131965'' referenced above</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Assisted Places Scheme]] was rescinded in the late 1990s, MGS was the first school to react with a seminal \"Bursary Appeal\", whose patron is [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]. The appeal has accumulated a value of over \u00a317.5m and finances bursaries, given to boys whose parents are unable to afford the school fees (currently \u00a39,660 per annum). Scholarships are not awarded.\n\nIn 2015 the school walked 500 miles to celebrate its 500 years anniversary. Boys and teachers were asked to raise money for the \"Bursary Appeal\" and walk a mile each. Over 240 pupils currently receive help from the fund.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fees and Assistance - The Manchester Grammar School|url = http://www.mgs.org/209/fees-and-assistance|website = www.mgs.org|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}</ref>\n<!-- (by which one quarter of the places were directly funded by central government with the rest attracting fees, some paid by the Local Education Authority, some by private pupils and a few funded by so-called Foundation Scholarships awarded on the basis of performance in the school entrance examinations).-->\n\n== Buildings ==\n=== Main building ===\n[[Image:MGS Main Building in Snow.jpg|right|thumb|MGS main building in 2007]]\nThe main building was designed in 1929 by Francis Jones and [[Percy Worthington]]. In keeping with the style of Oxbridge, it features a quadrangle and a grandiose Memorial Hall. Entrance to the quad is by a tripartite arch under a clock tower cupola. There is also the Paton Library (named after J.L. Paton, a former High Master), MGS Archive Room (formerly the Alan Garner Junior Library, which has since become part of the Paton Library), Common Room, Refectory, Medical Centre, Book Shop, Gymnasium and Swimming Pool. This is in addition to classrooms (subjects taught in this building are Art and Design, Mathematics, Economics, Classical Civilisation, Computing, Greek, History, Latin, Religion and Philosophy) and administrative offices. The MGS Theatre has recently undergone extensive rebuilding, to provide a modern and comfortable auditorium, together with studios for rehearsals and drama teaching. The Drama Centre Campaign is chaired by Sir [[Nicholas Hytner]] (Director of the National Theatre and a former pupil) who brought [[Alan Bennett]] and the actors from ''[[The History Boys]]'' to launch the campaign in 2006.\n\nThe main building also houses the Parker Art Hall which is a three-storey arts studio, situated in the south side of the main building. It is named after former High Master J.G. Parker. It includes a ceramics department with two kilns on the ground floor and also a dark room for photography.\n\nSince opening in 1931 the site at Fallowfield has seen many additions to the accommodation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==== Mason building ====\nThis is the school's language department, named after P.G. Mason, a former High Master, during whose tenure the building was erected. On the ground floor there are the Language Labs, two suites of listening stations, mainly used to practise the listening parts of national exams. This building was originally the school's Sixth Form block, and was built in 1966\u201367. The foundation stone was laid by the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] on the occasion of her visit in 1965. By 1970 the shoddiness of the workmanship and materials used was revealed by the cracks which had already started appearing in the internal walls. It is joined to the main building on the ground floor by the Paton Library.\n\n==== Marks building ====\nNamed after former pupil [[Simon Marks]] son of Michael Marks, founder of the [[Marks & Spencer]] empire. It is just west of the main building, and was erected in 1958. Major extensions were made by addition of the first floor (after a gift of \u00a350,000 from Lord Marks) and the [[Israel Sieff, Baron Sieff|Israel Sieff]] Lecture Theatre (after a gift of \u00a35,000 from Lord Marks' brother-in-law), which were opened on 19 September 1962.<ref>Ulula Autumn 1962</ref> It currently hosts the following departments: Physics, General Science (taken by Year 7 and 8 pupils \u2013 before the subject splits into the usual three divisions), Geography, Computing and Mathematics. There are five physics laboratories, including one for radioactive experimentation, on the ground floor. The main computer room is situated on the first floor of the Marks building.\n\n====Theatres and drama  ====\nSieff Theatre is named after former pupil, [[Israel Sieff]], is situated at the end of the Marks Building and was refurbished in 2006; it is used for lectures and assemblies, as well as being the venue to Muslim Friday prayers. The school has replaced its original Lecture Theatre with a new Drama Centre. This was opened in November 2010.\n\n==== Sports hall and rectory building====\nThe Michael Atherton Sports Hall was opened by [[Mike Atherton]] (a former pupil) in 1997 and subsequently used by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra in recording of a live CD. The sports hall was severely damaged in a gale in February 2014 and had to be demolished. There are also 2 squash courts adjacent to the sports hall. The former rectory of St James's Birch-in-Rusholme (the adjacent redundant church) it is located near the Sports Hall, and is the home of the Biology Department. However, only A-level biology is taught there. A new sports hall was opened in 2016.<ref name=\"new sports hall\">{{cite web|title=Ex-England cricket captain Mike Atherton returns to Manchester Grammar School to open new sports hall|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/mike-atherton-cricket-manchester-grammar-10482508|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Music school ====\nLocated at the rear of the school, it is the building where the music department is based. There is a music library in the basement as well as a dozen or so music practice rooms, each having a piano, used for private lessons. It contains a keyboard suite allowing first and second years to learn basic keyboard playing and a hall on the west side used primarily for orchestra rehearsals. The original part of the building where the practice rooms are now located had been used in the 1950s and '60s as a bicycle shed.<ref>Len Brown, Old Mancunian, 1952\u201358</ref>\n\n=== Junior School buildings ===\n[[File:MGS Bexwyke Lodge.jpg|thumb|Bexwyke Lodge]]\nIn September 2008, MGS opened a Junior School for pupils in Years 5 and 6 and its doors open to Years 3 and 4 in September 2011; boys entering the Junior School do not sit an entrance exam but attend an assessment day and gain automatic admission into Year 7. The Junior School buildings are both state-of-the-art timber buildings, constructed from sustainable materials imported from [[Estonia]].\n\nJunior School pupils in Years 3, 4 and 5 are located in Plessyngton Lodge.

The original ex-Army hut was opened at Christmas 1920, but it was destroyed by a [[Manchester Blitz|German bomb on 23 December 1940]], and a replacement was provided in 1950.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121&Itemid=116 |title=Owls' Nest page |work=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=6 October 2010}}</ref> The building is used by forms and activity groups of the school as a base for outdoor trips and camping expeditions. It is most frequently used by classes in Years 7 and 8, who spend a weekend there with their form teacher and form prefects. Wide games such as \"British Bulldog\" take place in the surrounding fields, and [[orienteering]] challenges in nearby Lyme Park. It is also used by school clubs such as the MGS Astronomical Society who use it for observational weekends because it is away from the lights of Manchester. The name refers to the school's logo of the owl.\n\nThere are four annual '''School Camps''', which have been in existence for many decades. They are held at [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], [[River Wye|Wye (Herefordshire)]], [[Bassenthwaite]] and [[Borrowdale]]. In Grasmere, the school has its own campsite donated by Old Mancunians in 1931. Visits to camps take part in the annual Activities Week, which is a week in which an impressive array of co-curricular activities are on offer to pupils.\n\nIn 2009 MGS opened the Old School House, its new outdoor study and pursuits centre in [[Kirkby Stephen]], Cumbria. Set on a hillside with stunning views of the [[Vale of Eden]] and the [[Lake District]] [[fell]]s, the facility offers opportunities such as [[The Duke of Edinburgh's Award|D of E expeditions]], choral and concert practice, art workshops and courses on the Theory of Knowledge. The purchase of the Old School House was partially financed by Old Mancunian, John Young and his wife Elizabeth.\n\n==School organisation==\n===Academic life===\nThe school was among the first in the UK to adopt the International Mathematics GCSE.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Soon afterwards, MGS also adopted the three Sciences and today it offers the IGCSE in most subjects. The main difference between IGCSE and GCSE is that the [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education|IGCSE]] does not have a compulsory coursework element, primarily because it would be too costly to moderate around the world. The maths and science departments decided that pupils were finding the coursework (which forms a fifth of the marks awarded in the national GCSE) undemanding and tedious and so made the switch in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4745367.stm|title=School drops 'tedious' maths GCSE|work=BBC News|date=4 August 2005}}</ref> In 2009 the GCSE was replaced by the IGCSE in most subjects (see below). At the same time the school began to offer additional GCSEs in Electronics and Mandarin Chinese, as well as Economics at A Level. \n\nSubjects available at GCSE/IGCSE are:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/175/academic-departments|title=Academic Departments - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n* Art and Design (GCSE)\n* Biology\n* Chemistry\n* Classical Civilisation (GCSE)\n* Classical Greek (GCSE)\n* Computer Science\n* Drama (GCSE)\n* English Language\n* English Literature\n* Electronics (GCSE)\n* Geography\n* History\n* Latin (GCSE)\n* Mathematics & Further Mathematics (GCSE)\n* Modern Languages (French, Spanish, Italian, German, Russian (GCSE), Mandarin Chinese (GCSE))\n* Music\n* Physics\n* Religious Studies\n\nAll the above subjects are available as Post-16 Qualifications (A-Level, International A-Level or Pre-U) as well as Politics and Economics.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe school is known for its outstanding academic results. In 2017 91% of all A-Level grades were A*-B and at GCSE/IGCSE 68% of all grades were at the A* level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/177/results|title=Results - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n===Community Action===\nVolunteering or \"Community Action\" at the school is an important part of school life. Pupils visit many primary schools in less fortunate areas during their lunch breaks to help younger children to read. Every Christmas, presents donated by the local community are distributed by MGS pupils in [[City of Salford|Salford]] to families who would otherwise not be able to afford presents for their children. During sixth form options, some pupils hold a coffee morning at a residential care home for the elderly in Salford. Other activities include paired reading at primary schools, distribution of food at Harvest and gifts at Christmas in deprived areas of Salford, visiting the elderly, teaching English as an additional language, recycling schemes, gardening, working with specialist schools or volunteering at the [[Chinatown, Manchester|Manchester Chinese Centre]] and many more. Lots of MGS boys take part in the Millennium Volunteers V scheme (now 'Vinvolved') and receive certificates for logging their volunteering activities. There are plans for many more community action projects, including the launching of a new Community Action website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/188/service|title=Service - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n===Partnerships with local schools===\nTwo girls' schools are situated nearby: [[Manchester High School for Girls]] and [[Withington Girls' School]]. MGS often collaborates with them particularly in music and drama events.\n\nIn 2013 the school founded in partnership with [[Manchester City Council]] and [[Urban Splash]], [[New Islington]] Free School.\n\n===Partnerships in Africa===\nMGS is also twinned with a school in [[Uganda]]. MGS became linked with the [[Busoga College|Busoga College Mwiri]] in 1990 as a consequence of their support for the Busoga Trust. The school donated second-hand science equipment, textbooks and, in 1998, equipped the Mwiri computer centre with almost one hundred PCs. A succession of MGS pupils have been to Mwiri to teach for a term in their gap year and five members of MGS staff and the School Medical Officer have made a combined total of over 20 visits to Mwiri. Some of MGS's pupils first formers (year 7) visited the college in 2003. In return Chairmen of Governors, Headmasters and Deputy Heads from Mwiri have visited MGS. A programme has been initiated to enable one member of the Mwiri staff each year to visit MGS for three weeks in September. This scheme was the brainchild of former Head of Physics, Roger Hand, who retired in 2008.\n\n==Publications==\nThere are three publications focusing on the school.\n\n'''''Ulula''''' is an annual full-colour magazine detailing life at MGS during the year. It contains a comprehensive review of activities of the societies, results achieved by the sports teams, dramatic and musical performances, as well as a selection of literary and fine art work made by the boys. It also serves to announce new appointments, retirements and departures of staff members. For those pupils who leave in the year prior to the issue of Ulula, the universities to which they are moving is listed.\n\n''''MGS News'''' is an annual 20-page glossy magazine published in October. It illustrates articles on the successes of MGS pupils, along with features on Old Mancunians and school events and activities. It is produced in-house by the Public Relations Department for promulgation to visitors at open events, current and prospective parents and teachers and the wider MGS community.\n\nThe '''''New Mancunian''''', is the school pupil newspaper which is written and produced by pupils and has won several national awards.<ref>[https://archive.is/20070504211734/http://www.mgs.org/view_page.asp?sel_sub_menu_id=526&sel_menu_id=152&section_id=4&page_id=852 MGS.org ]</ref> This is twinned in nomenclature with the '''''Old Mancunian''''' which is a monthly pamphlet sent out to ex-pupils.\n\nSpecialist publications are produced by societies, such as the Philsoc and Docsoc (science and medical societies respectively) magazines.\n\n==Old Mancunians \u2013 notable alumni==\n{{Main|List of Old Mancunians}}\n{{maincat|People educated at Manchester Grammar School}}\nThe school's alumni are called \"Old Mancunians\", or informally ''Old Mancs'', and include academics, politicians, mathematicians, sportsmen, such as former England cricket captain [[Mike Atherton]], former Lancashire Captain, [[Mark Chilton]], and former Lancashire and England batsman, [[John Crawley]], several notable writers, such as [[Thomas de Quincey]], playwright [[Robert Bolt]], author [[Alan Garner]], after whom the school's Junior Library is named, and journalist and broadcaster [[Martin Sixsmith]]. Other Old Mancunians are [[John Charles Polanyi]] (b. 1929) who won the 1986 [[Nobel Prize]] for Chemistry, actors [[Ben Kingsley]] and [[Robert Powell]], historian [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]], popular science writer [[Brian Clegg (writer)|Brian Clegg]], concert organist [[Daniel Moult]], comic [[Chris Addison]], and cryptographers [[Clifford Cocks]] and [[Malcolm J. Williamson]].  Theatre director [[Nicholas Hytner]] and the pianist [[John Ogdon]] are Old Mancunians.<ref name=\"Bentley\" /> Mathematician and Fields Medalist [[Sir Michael Atiyah]] was also educated at the school for two years.\n\n==High Masters==\nFor full details of [[High Master (academic)|High Master]]s up to 1990 with biographical sketches see Bentley.<ref name=\"Bentley\"/> The names and dates of High Masters are also listed in the entrance hall of MGS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mgs.org/index.php/our-heritage/the-high-masters-of-mgs |title=High Masters of MGS |work=Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=2 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523191927/http://www.mgs.org/index.php/our-heritage/the-high-masters-of-mgs |archivedate=May 23, 2010 }}</ref>\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-break}}\n*1515\u2013\n**          William Pleasington\n**          William Hinde\n**          James Plumtree\n*1534\u2013 \n**          Richard Bradshaw\n**          Thomas Wrench\n**          William Jackson\n*1547\u2013 \n**          Edward Pendleton\n**          William Terrill\n**          James Bateson\n**          Richard Raynton\n*1583\u2013 Thomas Cogan\n*1597\u2013 Edward Chetham\n*1606\u2013 Edward Clayton\n{{col-break}}\n*1616\u2013 John Rowlands\n*1630\u2013 Thomas Harrison\n*1637\u2013 Robert Symonds\n*1638\u2013 [[Ralph Brideoake]]\n*1645\u2013 Nehemiah Paynter\n*1652\u2013 John Wickens\n*1676\u2013 Daniel Hill\n*1677\u2013 William Barrow\n*1720\u2013 Thomas Colburn\n*1722\u2013 John Richards\n*1727\u2013 [[Henry Brooke (divine)|Henry Brook]]\n*1749\u2013 William Purnell\n*1764\u2013 Charles Lawson\n*1807\u2013 [[Jeremiah Smith (Manchester Grammar School)|Jeremiah Smith]]\n*1838\u2013 Robinson Elsdale\n*1840\u2013 John William Richards\n{{col-break}}\n*1842\u2013 Nicholas Germon\n*1859\u2013 [[Frederick William Walker]]\n*1877\u2013 Samuel Dill\n*1888\u2013 [[Michael George Glazebrook]]\n*1890\u2013 [[John Edward King]]\n*    - Sir [[Leon Simon (Zionist)|Leon Simon]]\n*1903\u2013 John Lewis Paton\n*1924\u2013 Douglas Gordon Miller\n*1945\u2013 [[Eric James, Baron James of Rusholme|Eric John Francis James]] (later Lord James of Rusholme)\n*1962\u2013 Peter Geoffrey Mason\n*1978\u2013 David Maland\n*1985\u2013 James Geoffrey Parker\n*1994\u2013 [[George Martin Stephen]]\n*2004\u2013 Christopher Ray\n*2013\u2013 Martin Boulton <ref name=\"HMC 2013 Highmaster\">{{cite web|last=Salmons |first=Heidi |title=New High Master coming home to The Manchester Grammar School |url=http://www.hmc.org.uk/new-high-master-coming-home-to-the-manchester-grammar-school/ |work=HMC |publisher=HMC |accessdate=3 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102185617/http://www.hmc.org.uk/new-high-master-coming-home-to-the-manchester-grammar-school/ |archivedate=2 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\n{{col-end}}<br />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.mgs.org}}\n*[http://www.mgscentral.org Official Virtual Learning Environmen]\n\n{{Schools in Manchester}}\n\n[[Category:Boys' schools in Greater Manchester]]\n[[Category:Primary schools in Manchester]]\n[[Category:Independent schools in Manchester]]\n[[Category:International Baccalaureate schools in England]]\n[[Category:People educated at Manchester Grammar School|.]]\n[[Category:Member schools of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in the 1510s]]\n[[Category:1515 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Alfred Waterhouse buildings]]\n", "name_user": "Christine Noble", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRecent history:update of fee level to 2019/20 charge", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Grammar_School"}

{"title_page": "Motets by Johann Sebastian Bach, discography", "text_new": "This article includes a list of commercial recordings of the [[Motet (Bach)|motets]] of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. Bach motets have often been recorded as a set (typically comprising the six motets catalogued as BWV{{nbsp}}225-230).{{efn|\"BWV\" is [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]], a thematic catalogue of Bach's works.}}  However, other motets are attributed to Bach and there is some doubt about the authorship of [[Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden, BWV 230|''Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden'', BWV 230]], one of the {{abbr|BWV|Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (catalogue of Bach's works)}} \"six\".\n\nA single CD can contain the set of six motets plus other works. For example, [[Maasaki Suzuki]]'s 2009 recording on [[BIS Records|BIS]] includes [[O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht, BWV 118|''O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht'', BWV 118]] (which at one time was categorised as a cantata) and [[Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh. 159|''Ich lasse dich nicht'', BWV Anh. 159]] (the authorship of which has been disputed).<ref name=\"BIS\">{{Cite web |url=https://bis.se/conductors/suzuki-masaaki/bach-motets |title=Bach Motets |website=bis.se (BIS Records) |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref> The motets chosen for a particular recording can reflect the way the balance of opinion changes regarding the status of a particular work. This appears to be the case with the two sets by [[John Eliot Gardiner]] conducting the [[Monteverdi Choir]]. They recorded Bach's motets without {{nowrap|BWV Anh. 159}} in 1980, but included it in their 2011 live recording.<ref name=\"muzie\">[https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX11558 ''Bach: Motets''] and [https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX10438 ''Bach Motets''] at {{url|www.muziekweb.nl}}.</ref>\n\n== Types of choirs ==\nChoirs with [[one voice per part]] (OVPP) are used in some [[historically informed performance]]s of Bach. However, OVPP recordings of the motets are relatively rare. Exceptions include the [[Hilliard Ensemble]]'s second set,<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news |last=Clements |first=Andrew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/may/18/classicalmusicandopera.shopping2 |title=Bach: Motets |date=18 May 2007 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> and [[Konrad Jungh\u00e4nel]] with the group Cantus C\u00f6lln.<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas6\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec6.htm |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 6 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref>\n\nAt least some of the motets would have been first performed by singers from Leipzig's [[Thomanerchor]], which comprises boys and young men. This choir has recorded the motets (initially under [[G\u00fcnther Ramin]] in the 1950s),<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas2\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec2.htm  |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 2 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref> as have other choirs with boys voices such as the [[Choir of New College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"BachCantatas7\"/>\n\n== Instrumental accompaniment ==\nMusic directors need to make choices about the instrumental accompaniment, if any, to be used. One approach is to have instruments doubling the vocal lines, something which is described as playing ''[[colla parte]]''. The opposite approach is to be ''[[a cappella]]'', that is, without an accompaniment. It is also possible to have a compromise with some support for the singers from instruments such as an [[Organ (music)|organ]].\n\nSurviving sources do not make it clear what Bach's approach was to the accompaniment of most of these pieces. In the case of [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]] orchestral parts are extant, indicating that choir I was doubled by strings and choir II by reeds (two [[oboe]]s, [[Taille (instrument)|taille]] and [[bassoon]]). There is also a [[basso continuo]] (separate [[violone]] and organ parts are provided) which underlies both choirs.<ref name=\"bachchoir\">{{Cite web |url=https://bach.org/education/motet-bwv-226/ |title=Motet BWV 226 |website=Bach Choir of Bethlehem |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\nAn accompaniment is also specified for ''Lobet den Herrn''.<ref name=\"Leavis\">{{cite web | url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/731829| title=Bach's Setting of Psalm CXVII (BWV.230) | publisher=OUP | work=[[Music & Letters]].

S. Bach]]\n", "text_old": "This article includes a list of commercial recordings of the [[Motet (Bach)|motets]] of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. Bach motets have often been recorded as a set (typically comprising the six motets catalogued as BWV{{nbsp}}225-230).{{efn|\"BWV\" is [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]], a thematic catalogue of Bach's works.}}  However, other motets are attributed to Bach and there is some doubt about the authorship of [[Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden, BWV 230|''Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden'', BWV 230]], one of the {{abbr|BWV|Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (catalogue of Bach's works)}} \"six\".\n\nA single CD can contain the set of six motets plus other works. For example, [[Maasaki Suzuki]]'s 2009 recording on [[BIS Records|BIS]] includes [[O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht, BWV 118|''O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht'', BWV 118]] (which at one time was categorised as a cantata) and [[Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh. 159|''Ich lasse dich nicht'', BWV Anh. 159]] (the authorship of which has been disputed).<ref name=\"BIS\">{{Cite web |url=https://bis.se/conductors/suzuki-masaaki/bach-motets |title=Bach Motets |website=bis.se (BIS Records) |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref> The motets chosen for a particular recording can reflect the way the balance of opinion changes regarding the status of a particular work. This appears to be the case with the two sets by [[John Eliot Gardiner]] conducting the [[Monteverdi Choir]]. They recorded Bach's motets without {{nowrap|BWV Anh. 159}} in 1980, but included it in their 2011 live recording.<ref name=\"muzie\">[https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX11558 ''Bach: Motets''] and [https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX10438 ''Bach Motets''] at {{url|www.muziekweb.nl}}.</ref>\n\n== Types of choirs ==\nChoirs with [[one voice per part]] (OVPP) are used in some [[historically informed performance]]s of Bach. However, OVPP recordings of the motets are relatively rare. Exceptions include the [[Hilliard Ensemble]]'s second set,<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news |last=Clements |first=Andrew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/may/18/classicalmusicandopera.shopping2 |title=Bach: Motets |date=18 May 2007 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> and [[Konrad Jungh\u00e4nel]] with the group Cantus C\u00f6lln.<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas6\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec6.htm |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 6 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref>\n\nAt least some of the motets would have been first performed by singers from Leipzig's [[Thomanerchor]]. This choir has recorded the motets (initially under [[G\u00fcnther Ramin]] in the 1950s),<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas2\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec2.htm  |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 2 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref> as have other choirs with boys voices such as the [[Choir of New College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"BachCantatas7\"/>\n\n== Instrumental accompaniment ==\nMusic directors need to make choices about the instrumental accompaniment, if any, to be used. One approach is to have instruments doubling the vocal lines, something which is described as playing ''[[colla parte]]''. The opposite approach is to be ''[[a cappella]]'', that is, without an accompaniment. It is also possible to have a compromise with some support for the singers from instruments such as an [[Organ (music)|organ]].\n\nSurviving sources do not make it clear what Bach's approach was to the accompaniment of most of these pieces. In the case of [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]] orchestral parts are extant, indicating that choir I was doubled by strings and choir II by reeds (two [[oboe]]s, [[Taille (instrument)|taille]] and [[bassoon]]). There is also a [[basso continuo]] (separate [[violone]] and organ parts are provided) which underlies both choirs.<ref name=\"bachchoir\">{{Cite web |url=https://bach.org/education/motet-bwv-226/ |title=Motet BWV 226 |website=Bach Choir of Bethlehem |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\nAn accompaniment is also specified for ''Lobet den Herrn''.<ref name=\"Leavis\">{{cite web | url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/731829| title=Bach's Setting of Psalm CXVII (BWV.230) | publisher=OUP | work=[[Music & Letters]].

The actress's casting was announced on 5 December 2011, though she began filming the week before. Sumarwata and her family relocated to Melbourne and purposely moved near to the studio, so she could manage work and be close to her daughter. The actress stated that she was excited about the role, while the show's executive producer [[Richard Jasek]] commented \"She's a wonderful actor and we think her character has so many exciting possibilities for us.\" Sumarwata made her debut screen appearance as Vanessa during the episode broadcast on 14 March 2012.\n\nBefore her arrival on screen, Vanessa was described as someone who embraces life to the full. She is Italian and a professional chef. A ''[[TV Week]]'' writer called Vanessa \"volatile\", while an ''[[Inside Soap]]'' columnist said was \"fiercely independent\". Sumarwata described her character as being someone who wears their heart on their sleeve. The actress stated that Vanessa's background would be explored in the future, adding a new dimension to the character. Vanessa's early storylines focused on a [[one-night stand]] with [[Lucas Fitzgerald]] ([[Scott Major]]), which resulted in pregnancy. Sumarwata thought the storyline was a great way to get viewers talking about the character.\n\nProducers soon established a relationship between Vanessa and [[Rhys Lawson]] ([[Ben Barber]]). The character's mother was also introduced, leading to a sham wedding storyline. Vanessa gives birth to a son and reunites with Lucas. In August 2013, it was revealed that Sumarwata had been written out, and she departed alongside Major on 24 September, as their characters' moved to the countryside. Sumarwata has reprised her role for various guest returns with Major. They returned for the show's 30th anniversary celebrations on 4 March 2015. She then appeared in additional episodes and departed the show on 16 November 2015. Sumarwata made a one episode appearance as Vanessa on 11 March 2019.\n\n==Casting==\nOn 5 December 2011, Daniel Kilkelly of [[Digital Spy]] reported Sumarwata had joined the cast of ''Neighbours'' as regular character, Vanessa Villante.<ref name=\"VanessaDS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a354469/neighbours-casts-new-female-regular-vanessa.html|title='Neighbours' casts new female regular Vanessa|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=5 December 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> Sumarwata relocated to Melbourne from Sydney with her husband and their young daughter, and she filmed her first scenes the week before her casting announcement.<ref name=\"VanessaDS\"/><ref name=\"VanessaC5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/neighbours/news/neighbours-newcomer-set-to-cook-up-a-storm|title=Neighbours newcomer set to cook up a storm|date=5 December 2011|work=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]|publisher=[[Northern & Shell]]|accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> She told Kilkelly \"Everything happened so quickly and it coincided with the move from Sydney - it was very chaotic at first and it did take a while.

The following day, Vanessa assures Lucas that she is not looking for a serious relationship. A month later, Vanessa returns and tells Lucas that she is pregnant. Lucas offends Vanessa when he asks if the baby is his and she quickly leaves. She tells [[Sonya Mitchell]] ([[Eve Morey]]) that she is glad she is on her own. Vanessa is interviewed by Paul Robinson for a job at Lassiter's Hotel. When Paul learns of her pregnancy from Lucas, he offers the job to someone else. Lucas's housemate [[Kate Ramsay]] ([[Ashleigh Brewer]]) invites Vanessa to move in when she discovers Vanessa is sleeping in her car. Vanessa finds employment at [[Erinsborough#Harold's Store|Harold's Store]]. She is briefly hospitalised with severe morning sickness. Vanessa impresses Rhys Lawson with her cooking and they being spending time together. Lucas attends Vanessa's first scan and their relationship improves. Rhys and Vanessa begin dating, and Rhys introduces Vanessa to his mother, [[Elaine Lawson|Elaine]] (Sancia Robinson).\n\nWhen Number 24 is put up for sale, Lucas buys Number 32 for Vanessa and the baby. Vanessa agrees to accompany Rhys on a three month work placement in Japan. However, their trip is cancelled when Rhys badly injures his hand, which affects his career as a surgical intern. Vanessa stands by Rhys when he becomes depressed. Rhys later admits that he has altered his test results, so he can assist in surgeries. Vanessa tells his superior and Rhys blames her for ending his surgical career. They break-up. Vanessa's mother, Francesca, visits and Vanessa tries to hide her pregnancy. When Francesca finds out, she insists that Vanessa and Lucas get married. During the ceremony, Vanessa struggles with her vows and flees the church. Francesca disowns Vanessa when she says she does not love Lucas. Rhys tries to win her back, but Vanessa rejects him. She then realises that Lucas loves her. Rhys takes Vanessa to the hospital when she goes into labour. He stays with her while she gives birth and when he proposes, Vanessa accepts.\n\nVanessa reconciles with her mother and she and Lucas name their son, [[Patrick Villante|Patrick]] (Lucas MacFarlane). Patrick is diagnosed with [[Ebstein's anomaly]] and has to undergo surgery. Vanessa ends her engagement to Rhys and tells Lucas she loves him. Rhys dies and Vanessa spends time with his mother. Patrick undergoes a second surgery, before Vanessa and Lucas bring him home. Lucas's ex-partner, [[Stephanie Scully]] ([[Carla Bonner]]), returns to town and Vanessa befriends her. But she is hurt when Lucas tells Steph that he has testicular cancer first. Lucas proposes and Vanessa accepts. Steph uses manipulation to cause tension between Lucas and Vanessa. When Lucas learns Vanessa was previously married, he calls off the wedding and Vanessa goes to stay with her parents. On her return, she asks Lucas to cut Steph out of his life, so they can repair their relationship. Steph kidnaps Patrick and Vanessa blames Lucas. He manages to find Steph and rescue Patrick.\n\nLucas buys an apartment at Lassiter's and decides to sell Number 32. Vanessa struggles with the idea of making their tenants, [[Lauren Turner (Neighbours)|Lauren]] ([[Kate Kendall]]) and [[Matt Turner (Neighbours)|Matt Turner]] ([[Josef Brown]]) homeless. Vanessa discovers she is pregnant again, which puts further strain on their finances. Lucas begins gambling, making Vanessa doubt her love for him. Her first husband [[Alek Pocoli]] ([[Damian De Montemas]]) tells her they are still married and he gives Vanessa $100,000 for a quick annulment, meaning she and Lucas can keep Number 32. They realise that they cannot get married, as Vanessa's annulment would not be completed in time. But Lucas suggests they hold a commitment ceremony instead. Vanessa and Lucas receive offers for their Lassiter's apartment and his business. They sell up and move to [[Daylesford, Victoria|Daylesford]], where Vanessa gives birth to their daughter [[Sebastiana (Neighbours)|Sebastiana]].\n\nVanessa and Lucas return for the Erinsborough Festival and they bring Sebastiana (Izabella Anderson) with them. They catch up with Toadie and Chris, who tells them he is going to be a father. They return to Daylesford afterwards. After Lucas buys back Fitzgerald Motors, Sonya suspects that Lucas is gambling again. Vanessa explains to her that she sold a cupcake recipe to a bakery, but they had to keep it a secret as they signed a [[non-disclosure agreement]]. Vanessa gets Sonya and Lucas to make up. While passing through Erinsborough, Vanessa agrees to meet with Steph for the first time since Patrick's kidnapping. Steph tells Vanessa that nothing like that will ever happen again and she explains about her treatment. When Steph mentions that her son called her, Toadie reveals that it was not possible and Vanessa suspects Steph is still unwell. The following day, Steph returns to apologise for her behaviour, but Vanessa tells that Toadie's belief is the only reason she has her job at the garage. Vanessa then asks Steph not to contact her or Lucas again. After Toadie and Steph learn that Vanessa made enquires at the hospital about Steph's condition, they confront her. Steph accuses Vanessa of trying to cause her another psychotic break. After calling Lucas, Vanessa tells Steph that they have decided to end her trial period at the garage. Vanessa and Lucas return to Erinsborough for Sonya's memorial, after she dies from ovarian cancer.\n\n==Reception==\nWhen asked by Jason Herbison of ''Inside Soap'' which new character viewers should be looking out for, Jasek chose Vanessa, saying she would take Erinsborough by storm.<ref name=\"RSSecrets\"/> ''TV Week's'' soap critic Andrew Mercado branded Vanessa a \"sexy chef\", while Cameron Adams of the ''[[Herald Sun]]'' called her \"a stone-cold fox\".<ref name=\"Bombshell\"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/ipad/tv/story-fn6bn9st-1226327260882|title=TV: There's no need to renovate The Block|last=Adams|first=Cameron|date=16 April 2012|work=[[Herald Sun]]|publisher=[[The Herald and Weekly Times]]|accessdate=17 April 2012}}</ref> A writer for Channel 5 proclaimed that she was a \"fiery newcomer\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/neighbours/news/sneak-peek-at-new-opening-titles|title=Sneak peek at new opening titles|date=30 April 2012|work=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]|publisher=[[Northern & Shell]]|accessdate=30 April 2012}}</ref> A ''[[Huddersfield Daily Examiner]]'' reporter stated Vanessa had proved to be \"the bane of Lucas' existence\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Soapwatch.-a0290102628|title=Soapwatch|date=19 May 2012|work=[[Huddersfield Daily Examiner]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref> While a ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' soap opera columnist observed that she had \"certainly made an impact since turning up in Erinsborough.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SOAP+STORIES.-a0291891038|title=Soap stories|date=2 June 2012|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref> When asked how fans have reacted to Vanessa, Sumarwata revealed \"I guess it is still early days, however I gather from ''Neighbours<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' digital department - who look after the website and social media - fans are really liking her, which is great considering she arrived with no back-story.\"<ref name=\"AlinInterview\"/> A writer from ''TV Magazine'' said that Vanessa and Lucas lead \"complicated lives\" and that their situation is \"all a bit of a mess\".

The actress's casting was announced on 5 December 2011, though she began filming the week before. Sumarwata and her family relocated to Melbourne and purposely moved near to the studio, so she could manage work and be close to her daughter. The actress stated that she was excited about the role, while the show's executive producer [[Richard Jasek]] commented \"She's a wonderful actor and we think her character has so many exciting possibilities for us.\" Sumarwata made her debut screen appearance as Vanessa during the episode broadcast on 14 March 2012.\n\nBefore her arrival on screen, Vanessa was described as someone who embraces life to the full. She is Italian and a professional chef. A ''[[TV Week]]'' writer called Vanessa \"volatile\", while an ''[[Inside Soap]]'' columnist said was \"fiercely independent\". Sumarwata described her character as being someone who wears their heart on their sleeve. The actress stated that Vanessa's background would be explored in the future, adding a new dimension to the character. Vanessa's early storylines focused on a [[one-night stand]] with [[Lucas Fitzgerald]] ([[Scott Major]]), which resulted in pregnancy. Sumarwata thought the storyline was a great way to get viewers talking about the character.\n\nProducers soon established a relationship between Vanessa and [[Rhys Lawson]] ([[Ben Barber]]). The character's mother was also introduced, leading to a sham wedding storyline. Vanessa gives birth to a son and reunites with Lucas. In August 2013, it was revealed that Sumarwata had been written out, and she departed alongside Major on 24 September, as their characters' moved to the countryside.

The following day, Vanessa assures Lucas that she is not looking for a serious relationship. A month later, Vanessa returns and tells Lucas that she is pregnant. Lucas offends Vanessa when he asks if the baby is his and she quickly leaves. She tells [[Sonya Mitchell]] ([[Eve Morey]]) that she is glad she is on her own. Vanessa is interviewed by Paul Robinson for a job at Lassiter's Hotel. When Paul learns of her pregnancy from Lucas, he offers the job to someone else. Lucas's housemate [[Kate Ramsay]] ([[Ashleigh Brewer]]) invites Vanessa to move in when she discovers Vanessa is sleeping in her car. Vanessa finds employment at [[Erinsborough#Harold's Store|Harold's Store]]. She is briefly hospitalised with severe morning sickness. Vanessa impresses Rhys Lawson with her cooking and they being spending time together. Lucas attends Vanessa's first scan and their relationship improves. Rhys and Vanessa begin dating, and Rhys introduces Vanessa to his mother, [[Elaine Lawson|Elaine]] (Sancia Robinson).\n\nWhen Number 24 is put up for sale, Lucas buys Number 32 for Vanessa and the baby. Vanessa agrees to accompany Rhys on a three month work placement in Japan. However, their trip is cancelled when Rhys badly injures his hand, which affects his career as a surgical intern. Vanessa stands by Rhys when he becomes depressed. Rhys later admits that he has altered his test results, so he can assist in surgeries. Vanessa tells his superior and Rhys blames her for ending his surgical career. They break-up. Vanessa's mother, Francesca, visits and Vanessa tries to hide her pregnancy. When Francesca finds out, she insists that Vanessa and Lucas get married. During the ceremony, Vanessa struggles with her vows and flees the church. Francesca disowns Vanessa when she says she does not love Lucas. Rhys tries to win her back, but Vanessa rejects him. She then realises that Lucas loves her. Rhys takes Vanessa to the hospital when she goes into labour. He stays with her while she gives birth and when he proposes, Vanessa accepts.\n\nVanessa reconciles with her mother and she and Lucas name their son, [[Patrick Villante|Patrick]] (Lucas MacFarlane). Patrick is diagnosed with [[Ebstein's anomaly]] and has to undergo surgery. Vanessa ends her engagement to Rhys and tells Lucas she loves him. Rhys dies and Vanessa spends time with his mother. Patrick undergoes a second surgery, before Vanessa and Lucas bring him home. Lucas's ex-partner, [[Stephanie Scully]] ([[Carla Bonner]]), returns to town and Vanessa befriends her. But she is hurt when Lucas tells Steph that he has testicular cancer first. Lucas proposes and Vanessa accepts. Steph uses manipulation to cause tension between Lucas and Vanessa. When Lucas learns Vanessa was previously married, he calls off the wedding and Vanessa goes to stay with her parents. On her return, she asks Lucas to cut Steph out of his life, so they can repair their relationship. Steph kidnaps Patrick and Vanessa blames Lucas. He manages to find Steph and rescue Patrick.\n\nLucas buys an apartment at Lassiter's and decides to sell Number 32. Vanessa struggles with the idea of making their tenants, [[Lauren Turner (Neighbours)|Lauren]] ([[Kate Kendall]]) and [[Matt Turner (Neighbours)|Matt Turner]] ([[Josef Brown]]) homeless. Vanessa discovers she is pregnant again, which puts further strain on their finances. Lucas begins gambling, making Vanessa doubt her love for him. Her first husband [[Alek Pocoli]] ([[Damian De Montemas]]) tells her they are still married and he gives Vanessa $100,000 for a quick annulment, meaning she and Lucas can keep Number 32. They realise that they cannot get married, as Vanessa's annulment would not be completed in time. But Lucas suggests they hold a commitment ceremony instead. Vanessa and Lucas receive offers for their Lassiter's apartment and his business. They sell up and move to [[Daylesford, Victoria|Daylesford]], where Vanessa gives birth to their daughter [[Sebastiana (Neighbours)|Sebastiana]].\n\nVanessa and Lucas return for the Erinsborough Festival and they bring Sebastiana (Izabella Anderson) with them. They catch up with Toadie and Chris, who tells them he is going to be a father. They return to Daylesford afterwards. After Lucas buys back Fitzgerald Motors, Sonya suspects that Lucas is gambling again. Vanessa explains to her that she sold a cupcake recipe to a bakery, but they had to keep it a secret as they signed a [[non-disclosure agreement]]. Vanessa gets Sonya and Lucas to make up. While passing through Erinsborough, Vanessa agrees to meet with Steph for the first time since Patrick's kidnapping. Steph tells Vanessa that nothing like that will ever happen again and she explains about her treatment. When Steph mentions that her son called her, Toadie reveals that it was not possible and Vanessa suspects Steph is still unwell. The following day, Steph returns to apologise for her behaviour, but Vanessa tells that Toadie's belief is the only reason she has her job at the garage. Vanessa then asks Steph not to contact her or Lucas again. After Toadie and Steph learn that Vanessa made enquires at the hospital about Steph's condition, they confront her. Steph accuses Vanessa of trying to cause her another psychotic break. After calling Lucas, Vanessa tells Steph that they have decided to end her trial period at the garage. Vanessa and Lucas return to Erinsborough for Sonya's memorial, after she dies from ovarian cancer.\n\n==Reception==\nWhen asked by Jason Herbison of ''Inside Soap'' which new character viewers should be looking out for, Jasek chose Vanessa, saying she would take Erinsborough by storm.<ref name=\"RSSecrets\"/> ''TV Week's'' soap critic Andrew Mercado branded Vanessa a \"sexy chef\", while Cameron Adams of the ''[[Herald Sun]]'' called her \"a stone-cold fox\".<ref name=\"Bombshell\"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/ipad/tv/story-fn6bn9st-1226327260882|title=TV: There's no need to renovate The Block|last=Adams|first=Cameron|date=16 April 2012|work=[[Herald Sun]]|publisher=[[The Herald and Weekly Times]]|accessdate=17 April 2012}}</ref> A writer for Channel 5 proclaimed that she was a \"fiery newcomer\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/neighbours/news/sneak-peek-at-new-opening-titles|title=Sneak peek at new opening titles|date=30 April 2012|work=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]|publisher=[[Northern & Shell]]|accessdate=30 April 2012}}</ref> A ''[[Huddersfield Daily Examiner]]'' reporter stated Vanessa had proved to be \"the bane of Lucas' existence\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Soapwatch.-a0290102628|title=Soapwatch|date=19 May 2012|work=[[Huddersfield Daily Examiner]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref> While a ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' soap opera columnist observed that she had \"certainly made an impact since turning up in Erinsborough.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SOAP+STORIES.-a0291891038|title=Soap stories|date=2 June 2012|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref> When asked how fans have reacted to Vanessa, Sumarwata revealed \"I guess it is still early days, however I gather from ''Neighbours<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' digital department - who look after the website and social media - fans are really liking her, which is great considering she arrived with no back-story.\"<ref name=\"AlinInterview\"/> A writer from ''TV Magazine'' said that Vanessa and Lucas lead \"complicated lives\" and that their situation is \"all a bit of a mess\".

He joined the organisation in August 2003, and a condition of his employment was acceptance of the group's [[equal opportunity|equal opportunities]] policy, which required him to ensure \"''that no person... [receive] less favourable treatment on the basis of characteristics, such as... sexual orientation...''\".<ref name=\"transcript\">{{cite web|title=Copy of the official transcript of the Court of Appeal judgement|url=http://www.employmentcasesupdate.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed5719|publisher=Employment Cases Update|accessdate=4 December 2010}}</ref> Relate was also a member of the British Association for Sexual and Relationship Therapy, whose Code of Ethics required the therapist to \"''avoid discrimination... on grounds of... sexual orientation.''\"\n\nAlthough the applicant had found himself capable of assisting same-sex couples in counselling where discussion of sexual issues was not involved, in September 2006 he applied to undertake a diploma course in psycho-sexual therapy (PST) (a new name for sex therapy<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.counsellingberkshire.co.uk/page/psychosexual| title=What is Psychosexual Therapy?| last=Tingle| first=Sarah| accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref>). Managers at Relate considered his raising of a possible conscionable objection to assisting same-sex couples with sexual issues to be incompatible with the organisation's equal opportunities policy and would reduce the number of couples he were able to help. On 12 December 2007, the applicant was asked to confirm in writing he would continue to counsel same-sex clients in both relationship counselling and PST with regard to all the sexual issues they may have brought, and that he would agree to carry out relationship work where it involved same-sex sexual issues.\n\nIn January 2008, McFarlane responded that he was unable to confirm this, and disciplinary proceedings were initiated. During these he confirmed that he would provide the required services to same-sex couples and the proceedings were ended. In March of that year however, he indicated to his supervisor that he might find it difficult to carry out such work, and on 18 March 2008, the applicant was dismissed from his post on the grounds:<ref name=\"transcript\"/>\n:That on 7 January 2008 you stated to Relate that you would comply with its Equal Opportunities policy and Professional Ethics policy in relation to work with same-sex couples and same-sex sexual activities, when you had and have no intention of complying with Relate's policies on those issues.\n\nThe applicant undertook an unsuccessful internal appeal against dismissal, and subsequently applied to the [[Employment Tribunal]], claiming discrimination on the ground of religion or belief, harassment, unfair dismissal and [[wrongful dismissal]]. The claim of wrongful dismissal was accepted on procedural grounds, but the other claims were dismissed, and the applicant appealed against the dismissal of the claims of discrimination and unfair dismissal to the [[Employment Appeal Tribunal]].\n\n==Employment Appeal Tribunal==\nMcFarlane's action before the [[Employment Appeal Tribunal]] was heard on 9\u201310 September 2009, and the judgement issued on 30 November.<ref name=\"EAT\">{{cite web|title=Judgement of the Employment Appeal Tribunal|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/23550345/McFarlane-v-Relate-Avon|publisher=[[Employment Appeal Tribunal]]|date=30 November 2009|accessdate=4 December 2010}}</ref> The Tribunal found that the applicant had suffered neither direct nor indirect discrimination under the [[Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003]] or the [[Human Rights Act 1998]]. The Tribunal made particular reference to remarks by Lord Bingham in the House of Lords decision in ''[[R (Begum) v Headteacher and Governors of Denbigh High School|R (Begum) v Denbigh High School]]'', that \"''The Strasbourg institutions have not been at all ready to find an interference with the right to manifest religious belief in practice or observance where a person has voluntarily accepted an employment or role which does not accommodate that practice or observance and there are other means open to the person to observe his or her religion without undue hardship or inconvenience.''\"<ref name=\"EAT\"/> Reference was also made to ''Ladele v London Borough of Islington'', a Christian registrar's unsuccessful appeal against dismissal for refusing to officiate [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partnership]] ceremonies.\n\n==Court of Appeal==\nMcFarlane applied to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] to be allowed to appeal the decision of the Employment Appeal Tribunal, however his application was refused by [[Patrick Elias|Lord Justice Elias]] on 30 January 2010. A renewed application was made before [[John Laws (judge)|Lord Justice Laws]] on 15 April 2010. It contained a request that his case be heard before a specially constituted court comprising the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] and five Lords Justices with proven sensibility towards religious issues. A witness statement was also submitted in support of the application by the former [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[George Carey|George Carey, Lord Carey of Clifton]]. The statement supported Mr McFarlane's request for a specially constituted court, and also sought to refute suggestions that Christian teaching on same-sex unions was discriminatory and that such views were equivalent to homophobia. The application was refused in a judgement delivered on 29 April 2010.\n\nLord Justice Laws stated that \"''the conferment of any legal protection or preference upon a particular substantive moral position on the ground only that it is espoused by the adherents of a particular faith, however long its tradition, however rich its culture, is deeply unprincipled.''\" As religious beliefs were by their nature impossible to prove, they were necessarily subjective, and could therefore only be considered to bind the behaviour of the believer and not that of anyone else. He went on to state:\n:The promulgation of law for the protection of a position held purely on religious grounds cannot therefore be justified. It is irrational, as preferring the subjective over the objective. But it is also divisive, capricious and arbitrary. We do not live in a society where all the people share uniform religious beliefs. The precepts of any one religion \u2013 any belief system \u2013 cannot, by force of their religious origins, sound any louder in the general law than the precepts of any other. If they did, those out in the cold would be less than citizens; and our constitution would be on the way to a theocracy, which is of necessity autocratic. The law of a theocracy is dictated without option to the people, not made by their judges and governments. The individual conscience is free to accept such dictated law; but the State, if its people are to be free, has the burdensome duty of thinking for itself.\n\nThe application was refused.\n\n==Consequent events==\nMr McFarlane appealed to the [[ECtHR]] on freedom of religion grounds.

Hooker]], is one of the oldest cattle ranches in the United States and the ranch buildings have been designated a National Historic Landmark. It was the first permanent American cattle ranch in [[Arizona]]. Hooker bought neighboring ranches until his operation became the largest ranch in [[Arizona]], totaling {{convert|800|sqmi|km2}}, or about {{convert|30|by|27|mi}}.<ref name=rexallen/> It is located in [[Sulphur Springs Valley]] about {{convert|27|mi}} north of present-day [[Willcox, Arizona]]. The modern ranch is much smaller but is still operational and owned by Jesse Hooker Davis, the sixth generation to live and work on the ranch.\n\n== Founding ==\nBefore the arrival of the Spanish, the valley was visited and may have been occupied by Chiricahua [[Apache]]. Beginning in about 1775, the Mexican government promoted a policy of Indian appeasement that reduced hostilities. By the early 1800s there were a number of Mexican rancheros in the area that managed thousands of cattle on the open range.<ref name=cowbelles>{{cite web|title=Willcox Cowbelles Ranch History display|url=http://www.willcoxrangenews.com/article_cb984cd4-56ee-11e3-8770-001a4bcf887a.html|publisher=Wilcox Range News|date=27 November 2013 |accessdate=7 January 2014}}</ref> As a result of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], the settlers in the northern regions lost the government's protection. Apaches stole or killed most of the cattle, and the settlers who didn't returned to the interior of Mexico were killed. By about 1840 the only evidence of their former presence were some ruins and a few herds of wild cattle. The California Gold Rush that began in 1849 drew a large number of people through the area, but by this time only the Apache occupied the area.<ref name=cowbelles/>\n\nPrior to the Gold Rush, cattle were primarily valued for their hides and [[tallow]]. A mature [[Cattle#Terminology|steer]] rarely fetched more than $4.00 a head (or about ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|4|1849|r=0}}}} today). The miners and merchants who came to California as a result of the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] fed an explosion in the state's population and a concurrent demand for beef. The price of cattle rose up to $75 a head (around ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|75|1865|r=0}}}} today).<ref>{{cite web|title=Rancho San Pedro|url=http://score.rims.k12.ca.us/score_lessons/rancho/pages/gold_ush_1_cattle_boom.htm|publisher=Schools of California Online Resources for Education|accessdate=20 January 2014}}</ref> Ranchers could turn a profit driving cattle from as far as Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona to California even though the Chiricahua [[Apache]]s took many cattle.<ref name=\"hooker\">{{cite book |title= The Descendants of Rev.

Hooker visited each agency to assess how much beef each needed. Hooker followed that contract with another by partnering with pioneer cattlemen William B. Hooper and James M. Barney in a similar venture.\n\nA family legend says that a herd of cattle stampeded and Hooker's range hands found the cattle in what later became known as Sulphur Springs Valley. Hooker liked the valley and decided to start a ranch there.<ref name=banks/>\n\n=== Ranch buildings ===\n[[File:Hooker-ranch-courtyard.png|thumb|left|Enclosed courtyard of the main residence of the Sierra Bonita Ranch]]\n[[File:Sierra-bonita-ranch-barn.png|thumb|The historic wood and adobe barn at the Sierra Bonita Ranch. The sign was painted in 1972 upon the 100th anniversary of the ranch's founding.]]\nHooker established his ranch in 1872 on the site of a former Spanish hacienda, one of those destroyed by the Apache many years before. His main ranch house was a large, rectangular, U-shaped structure {{convert|80|ft|m}} by {{convert|100|ft|m}} surrounding a central patio. The walls were built of two rows of [[adobe]] bricks {{convert|20|in}} thick and {{convert|16|ft}} high. To maximize security, none of the building's outside walls had doors or windows. The only access was through a single gate in a fourth wall, although another door was added in another wall years later when security improved. To maximize self-sufficiency, the patio originally contained a well and a root cellar, but they were later filled in.<ref name=NPS/> The roof had gunports in the parapets.<ref name=banks>{{cite news|last=Banks|first=Leo|title=Est. 1872|url=http://www.rangemagazine.com/features/summer-12/range-su12-est_1872.pdf|accessdate=7 January 2014|newspaper=RangeMagazine.com|date=Summer 2012 |pages=20\u201323}}</ref> Hooker developed a relationship with the Apache Indians who used a trail through the valley near his ranch compound. The trail ran between the United States and Mexico, but Hooker rarely had trouble from them.<ref name=NPS/>\n\nBy 1885, Hooker bought other nearby ranches. He built up his herds and brought in expensive bulls and blooded cows. He maintained a dairy herd that kept the ranch supplied with butter and milk. He put in {{convert|1000|acres}} of [[alfalfa]] and [[timothy-grass|timothy]], and planted acres of corn and artichokes to use as feed for a large number of well-bred hogs. He had hen houses built to supply the ranch with chickens and eggs. He bought six purebred stallions and ran over 500 brood mares that produced horses that became known for their speed, beauty and temperament.<ref name=rexallen>{{cite web|title=Henry Clay Hooker|url=http://www.rexallenmuseum.org/CHF_020.php?inductee=CHF/CHF_018|publisher=Rex Allen Museum|accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe ranch eventually included lands in [[Graham County, Arizona|Graham]] and [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise Counties]]. It became the largest ranch in [[Arizona]], totaling {{convert|800|sqmi|km2}}. Hooker was committed to quality livestock and in the 1880s he improved his herds by importing [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] graded stock.<ref name=NPS /> He was noted for breeding some of the best cattle, horses, sheep, and dogs in the country.<ref name=\"hooker\"/>\n\nHooker built a number of other buildings that still survive, including the original barn, built of adobe and wood. It was decorated in 1972 with the words \"Sierra Bonita Ranch 1872\", in honor of the ranch's centennial. North of the main house is a weather-worn adobe bunkhouse with a tin roof and a large adobe corral for storing hay. Other historic corrals at the ranch are made of adobe and wooden planks.<ref name=NPS/> Some of the older structures have become unusable, but due to the limitations imposed by the National Historic Structures designation, Davis doesn't want to spend money to rebuild them.\n\n=== Ranch social life ===\n[[File:Hooker and dogs sierra bonita ranch.jpg|thumb|Henry C. Hooker mounts a horse near several of his greyhound dogs.]]\nThe ranch became a social center in the southeastern [[Arizona Territory]]. Hooker hosted politicians, government and military officials, artists, writers, and scientists. When invited to dinner, everyone was required to wear a coat, and Hooker kept a few extra on hand for guests who didn't have one. Hooker always dressed like an Eastern gentleman and never wore cowboy clothing, even when on the range.<ref name=rexallen/> Playwright [[Augustus Thomas]] set his play ''[[Arizona (play)|Arizona]]'' at the ranch and based the two primary characters Canby and Bonita on Hooker's family.<ref name=rexallen/>\n\n=== Geography and water supply ===\n\nThe valley is at {{convert|4000|ft|m}}elevation, allowing the ranch to escape extremes of heat and cold, and thus provided an ideal breeding range.<ref name=NPS/> The plentiful [[water supply]] included five springs, creeks that flowed in the spring and fall, and abundant, shallow [[groundwater]] easily tapped by wells. In case of drought, Hooker had ditches dug that brought water from the mountains to reservoirs on his ranch.<ref>{{cite web|last=Munk|first=Joseph|title=Arizona Sketches|url=http://southwest.library.arizona.edu/azsk/body.1_div.7.html|publisher=Grafton Press|location=New York|year=1905|accessdate=7 January 2014}}</ref> Control of a reliable water source gave Hooker the ability to control a range approximately {{convert|30|mi|km}} long and {{convert|30|mi|km}} wide.\n\n=== Cattle operations ===\n[[File:Among the 30,000 cattle of Sierra Bonita Ranch, lassoing a yearling, Arizona, by Underwood & Underwood.jpg|thumb|Steroscopic view of a portion of the 30,000 head of cattle on the Sierra Bonita Ranch.]]\nHooker became the largest supplier of beef to the military in the [[Arizona Territory]]. Hooker Initially suffered heavy losses, both in personnel and supplies, due to [[Apache]] raids. Hooker originally stocked his ranch with [[Texas Longhorn]]s and low-grade [[Corriente cattle|Mexican corrientes]] before replacing them with [[Shorthorn|Durham cattle]].<ref name=banks/> In the 1880s Hooker improved his herds further by importing [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] graded stock.<ref name=NPS>[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/prospector/siteb2.htm Sierra Bonita Ranch, Arizona] at National Park Service.

In the Arizona Territory from 1873\u201391, cattle herds grew from 40,000 to 1.5 million head.<ref name=sayre/> Hooker built a sound operation and was one of the few Arizona ranchers to survive a disastrous drought in 1891, which killed over half the cattle due in part to severe overgrazing. Efforts to restore the rangeland between 1905 and 1934 had limited success, but ranching continued on a smaller scale.<ref name=sayre>Nathan Sayre, \"The Cattle Boom in Southern Arizona: Towards A Critical Political Ecology,\" ''Journal of the Southwest,'' (1999) 41#2 pp 239-271</ref> When he died in 1907, Hooker was still the cattle king of Arizona.<ref name=NPS/>\n\n==Present operations ==\n\nThe Sierra Bonita Ranch was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1964.<ref name=\"nhlsum\"/><ref name=\"nrhpinv\">Marilynn Larew and William Brown (June 20, 1977) {{NHLS url|id=66000181|title=Sierra Bonita Ranch / The Hooker Ranch}}, National Park Service and {{NHLS url|id=66000181|title=Accompanying 21 photos, from 1975.|photos=y}}</ref> It is among the oldest ranches in the United States.<ref name=NPS/>\n\nIt remains an operating [[cattle ranch]] and is owned as of 2012 by Jesse Hooker Davis, great-great-great-grandson of Henry Hooker, who took over management from his grandmother, Jacqueline Hooker Hughes.<ref name=banks/> The ranch currently includes {{convert|45000|acres}}, about one-fifth the size of the operation under its founder, Henry Hooker. Some of the land was lost to homesteaders allowed on the property in the early 20th century by the federal government, and some has been portioned off to other family members.<ref name=banks/> The property currently includes only two of the original five wells, and the ranch no longer includes any of the mountain ranges and their water supplies.\n\nThe adobe ranch house has been remodeled inside, but it still retains the fortress-like appearance of early days.

Hooker]], is one of the oldest cattle ranches in the United States and the ranch buildings have been designated a National Historic Landmark. It was the first permanent American cattle ranch in [[Arizona]]. Hooker bought neighboring ranches until his operation became the largest ranch in [[Arizona]], totaling {{convert|800|sqmi|km2}}, or about  {{convert|30|by|27|mi}}.<ref name=rexallen/> It is located in [[Sulphur Springs Valley]] about {{convert|27|mi}} north of present-day [[Willcox, Arizona]]. The modern ranch is much smaller but is still operational and owned by Jesse Hooker Davis, the sixth generation to live and work on the ranch.\n\n== Founding ==\nBefore the arrival of the Spanish, the valley was visited and may have been occupied by Chiricahua [[Apache]]. Beginning in about 1775, the Mexican government promoted a policy of Indian appeasement that reduced hostilities. By the early 1800s there were a number of Mexican rancheros in the area that managed thousands of cattle on the open range.<ref name=cowbelles>{{cite web|title=Willcox Cowbelles Ranch History display|url=http://www.willcoxrangenews.com/article_cb984cd4-56ee-11e3-8770-001a4bcf887a.html|publisher=Wilcox Range News|date=27 November 2013 |accessdate=7 January 2014}}</ref>  As a result of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], the settlers in the northern regions lost the government's protection. Apaches stole or killed most of the cattle, and the settlers who didn't returned to the interior of Mexico were killed. By about 1840 the only evidence of their former presence were some ruins and a few herds of wild cattle. The California Gold Rush that began in 1849 drew a large number of people through the area, but by this time only the Apache occupied the area.<ref name=cowbelles/>\n\nPrior to the Gold Rush, cattle were primarily valued for their hides and [[tallow]]. A mature [[Cattle#Terminology|steer]] rarely fetched more than $4.00 a head (or about ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|4|1849|r=0}}}} today). The miners and merchants who came to California as a result of the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] fed an explosion in the state's population and a concurrent demand for beef. The price of cattle rose up to $75 a head (around ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|75|1865|r=0}}}} today).<ref>{{cite web|title=Rancho San Pedro|url=http://score.rims.k12.ca.us/score_lessons/rancho/pages/gold_ush_1_cattle_boom.htm|publisher=Schools of California Online Resources for Education|accessdate=20 January 2014}}</ref> Ranchers could turn a profit driving cattle from as far as Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona to California even though the Chiricahua [[Apache]]s took many cattle.<ref name=\"hooker\">{{cite book |title= The Descendants of Rev.

Hooker visited each agency to assess how much beef each needed. Hooker followed that contract with another by partnering with pioneer cattlemen William B. Hooper and James M. Barney in a similar venture.\n\nA family legend says that a herd of cattle stampeded and Hooker's range hands found the cattle in what later became known as Sulphur Springs Valley. Hooker liked the valley and decided to start a ranch there.<ref name=banks/>\n\n=== Ranch buildings ===\n[[File:Hooker-ranch-courtyard.png|thumb|left|Enclosed courtyard of the main residence of the Sierra Bonita Ranch]]\n[[File:Sierra-bonita-ranch-barn.png|thumb|The historic wood and adobe barn at the Sierra Bonita Ranch. The sign was painted in 1972 upon the 100th anniversary of the ranch's founding.]]\nHooker established his ranch in 1872 on the site of a former Spanish hacienda, one of those destroyed by the Apache many years before. His main ranch house was a large, rectangular, U-shaped structure {{convert|80|ft|m}} by {{convert|100|ft|m}} surrounding a central patio. The walls were built of two rows of [[adobe]] bricks {{convert|20|in}} thick and {{convert|16|ft}} high. To maximize security, none of the building's outside walls had doors or windows. The only access was through a single gate in a fourth wall, although another door was added in another wall years later when security improved. To maximize self-sufficiency, the patio originally contained a well and a root cellar, but they were later filled in.<ref name=NPS/> The roof had gunports in the parapets.<ref name=banks>{{cite news|last=Banks|first=Leo|title=Est. 1872|url=http://www.rangemagazine.com/features/summer-12/range-su12-est_1872.pdf|accessdate=7 January 2014|newspaper=RangeMagazine.com|date=Summer 2012 |pages=20\u201323}}</ref> Hooker developed a relationship with the Apache Indians who used a trail through the valley near his ranch compound. The trail ran between the United States and Mexico, but Hooker rarely had trouble from them.<ref name=NPS/>\n\nBy 1885, Hooker bought other nearby ranches. He built up his herds and brought in expensive bulls and blooded cows. He maintained a dairy herd that kept the ranch supplied with butter and milk. He put in {{convert|1000|acres}} of [[alfalfa]] and [[timothy-grass|timothy]], and planted acres of corn and artichokes to use as feed for a large number of well-bred hogs. He had hen houses built to supply the ranch with chickens and eggs. He bought six purebred stallions and ran over 500 brood mares that produced horses that became known for their speed, beauty and temperament.<ref name=rexallen>{{cite web|title=Henry Clay Hooker|url=http://www.rexallenmuseum.org/CHF_020.php?inductee=CHF/CHF_018|publisher=Rex Allen Museum|accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe ranch eventually included lands in [[Graham County, Arizona|Graham]] and [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise Counties]]. It became the largest ranch in [[Arizona]], totaling {{convert|800|sqmi|km2}}. Hooker was committed to quality livestock and in the 1880s he improved his herds by importing [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] graded stock.<ref name=NPS>[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/prospector/siteb2.htm Sierra Bonita Ranch, Arizona] National Park Service.</ref>  He was noted for breeding some of the best cattle, horses, sheep, and dogs in the country.<ref name=\"hooker\"/>\n\nHooker built a number of other buildings that still survive, including the original barn, built of adobe and wood. It was decorated in 1972 with the words \"Sierra Bonita Ranch 1872\", in honor of the ranch's centennial. North of the main house is a weather-worn adobe bunkhouse with a tin roof and a large adobe corral for storing hay. Other historic corrals at the ranch are made of adobe and wooden planks.<ref name=NPS/> Some of the older structures have become unusable, but due to the limitations imposed by the National Historic Structures designation, Davis doesn't want to spend money to rebuild them.\n\n=== Ranch social life ===\n[[File:Hooker and dogs sierra bonita ranch.jpg|thumb|Henry C. Hooker mounts a horse near several of his greyhound dogs.]]\nThe ranch became a social center in the southeastern [[Arizona Territory]]. Hooker hosted politicians, government and military officials, artists, writers, and scientists. When invited to dinner, everyone was required to wear a coat, and Hooker kept a few extra on hand for guests who didn't have one. Hooker always dressed like an Eastern gentleman and never wore cowboy clothing, even when on the range.<ref name=rexallen/> Playwright [[Augustus Thomas]] set his play ''[[Arizona (play)|Arizona]]'' at the ranch and based the two primary characters Canby and Bonita on Hooker's family.<ref name=rexallen/>\n\n=== Geography and water supply ===\n\nThe valley is at {{convert|4000|ft|m}}elevation, allowing the ranch to escape extremes of heat and cold, and thus provided an ideal breeding range.<ref name=NPS/> The plentiful [[water supply]] included five springs, creeks that flowed in the spring and fall, and abundant, shallow [[groundwater]] easily tapped by wells. In case of drought, Hooker had ditches dug that brought water from the mountains to reservoirs on his ranch.<ref>{{cite web|last=Munk|first=Joseph|title=Arizona Sketches|url=http://southwest.library.arizona.edu/azsk/body.1_div.7.html|publisher=Grafton Press|location=New York|year=1905|accessdate=7 January 2014}}</ref>  Control of a reliable water source gave Hooker the ability to control a range approximately {{convert|30|mi|km}} long and {{convert|30|mi|km}} wide.\n\n=== Cattle operations ===\n[[File:Among the 30,000 cattle of Sierra Bonita Ranch, lassoing a yearling, Arizona, by Underwood & Underwood.jpg|thumb|Steroscopic view of a portion of the 30,000 head of cattle on the Sierra Bonita Ranch.]]\nHooker became the largest supplier of beef to the military in the [[Arizona Territory]]. Hooker Initially suffered heavy losses, both in personnel and supplies, due to [[Apache]] raids. Hooker originally stocked his ranch with [[Texas Longhorn]]s and low-grade [[Corriente cattle|Mexican corrientes]] before replacing them with [[Shorthorn|Durham cattle]].<ref name=banks/> In the 1880s Hooker improved his herds further by importing [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] graded stock.<ref name=NPS>[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/prospector/siteb2.htm Sierra Bonita Ranch, Arizona] at National Park Service.

In the Arizona Territory from 1873\u201391, cattle herds grew from 40,000 to 1.5 million head.<ref name=sayre/> Hooker built a sound operation and was one of the few Arizona ranchers to survive a disastrous drought in 1891, which killed over half the cattle due in part to severe overgrazing. Efforts to restore the rangeland between 1905 and 1934 had limited success, but ranching continued on a smaller scale.<ref name=sayre>Nathan  Sayre, \"The Cattle Boom in Southern Arizona: Towards A Critical Political Ecology,\" ''Journal of the Southwest,'' (1999) 41#2 pp 239-271</ref> When he died in 1907, Hooker was still the cattle king of Arizona.<ref name=NPS/>\n\n==Present operations ==\n\nThe Sierra Bonita Ranch was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1964.<ref name=\"nhlsum\"/><ref name=\"nrhpinv\">Marilynn Larew and William Brown (June 20, 1977) {{NHLS url|id=66000181|title=Sierra Bonita Ranch / The Hooker Ranch}}, National Park Service and {{NHLS url|id=66000181|title=Accompanying 21 photos, from 1975.|photos=y}}</ref> It is among the oldest ranches in the United States.<ref name=NPS/>\n\nIt remains an operating [[cattle ranch]] and is owned as of 2012 by Jesse Hooker Davis, great-great-great-grandson of Henry Hooker, who took over management from his grandmother, Jacqueline Hooker Hughes.<ref name=banks/> The ranch currently includes {{convert|45000|acres}}, about one-fifth the size of the operation under its founder, Henry Hooker.

It is shaded by giant [[Populus sect. Aegiros|cottonwood]]s and surrounded by the original adobe corrals, bunkhouses, and barns.

After they got negative feedback on this, they reacted strongly.

The profit would go to the red cross, but after they made a good profit margin. Again all commenters where rudely silenced. \nIt wasn't after the tv-program \"zondag met Lubach\" aired an item pointing out that RUMAG was selling the t-shirts at an higer price then their normal shirts and the donation to the Red Cross was extra, on top of the (already higher) price.\nAgain RUMAG reacted in a childish way, saying that they didn't understand why they were made out to be \"the black sheep\", and countered that they didn't make any profit. \nBecause of the bad publicity and obvious inability to react in a proper way the company founder, van der Heide, resigned.\n\n== Awards ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The club currently competes in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]], the second tier of English football. They were founded in 1886 after the merger of Christchurch Rangers and St Judes Institute, although their official founding date is 1882 which is when Christchurch Rangers were first formed. In the early years after the club's formation in its original home of [[Queen's Park, London]], they played their home games at many different grounds, until finally the club settled into its current location at [[Loftus Road]], renamed [[Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium]] at the beginning of the 2019/20 season.<ref name=QPR />\n\nThe club's achievements include winning the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in [[1966\u201367 Football League Cup|1967]], and they were [[FA Cup]] finalists in [[1981\u201382 FA Cup|1982]].<ref name=QPR>{{cite web|url=http://www.qpr.co.uk/club/history/|title=Queens Park Rangers FC History|website=QPR.co.uk|publisher=Queens Park Rangers FC}}</ref> Their highest ever league finish was achieved in [[1975\u201376 Football League|1975\u201376]] when they were runners-up in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], now known as the [[Premier League]] and qualified for Europe for the first time reaching the quarter-finals of the [[1976\u201377 UEFA Cup]].\n\nQPR have long-standing rivalries with several other clubs in the London area. The most notable of these are [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]].<ref name=QPR />\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Queens Park Rangers F.C.}}\n{{see also|List of Queens Park Rangers F.C. seasons}}\n\n===1880s\u20131970s===\nThe club was formed in 1886, when a team known as '''St Jude's''' (formed in 1884) merged with '''Christchurch Rangers''' (formed in 1882).<ref>{{cite web |title=Our History&nbsp;\u2013 Key dates |url=http://www.qpr.co.uk/club/history/key-dates/ |website=QPR.co.uk |publisher=Queens Park Rangers FC |accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref> The resulting team was called Queen's Park Rangers and their official formation date is considered to be 1882, which is the original founding date of '''Christchurch Rangers.''' The club's name came from the fact most of the players came from the [[Queen's Park, London|Queen's Park]] area of north-west London. St Jude's Institute on Ilbert Street W10 is still in use as a community hall and in July 2011 club icon [[Stan Bowles]] unveiled a plaque celebrating its place in history.\n\nQPR became a professional team in 1889, and played their home games in nearly 20 different stadia (a league record), before permanently settling at [[Loftus Road]] in 1917, although the team would briefly attempt to attract larger crowds by playing at the [[White City Stadium]] for two short spells: 1931 to 1933, and the [[1962\u201363 in English football|1962\u201363]] season.<ref>{{cite book |first=Simon |last=Inglis |title=Football Grounds of Britain |year=1996 |origyear=1985 |edition=3rd |publisher=CollinsWillow |location=London |isbn=978-0-00-218426-7 |pages=305\u20136 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:QPR League Performance.svg|thumb|right|Chart showing the progress of QPR's league finishes from 1920\u201321 season to present]]\n\nQPR were promoted as champions of Division 3 South in the 1947\u201348 season. [[Dave Mangnall]] was the manager as the club participated in four seasons of the Second Division, being relegated in 1951\u201352. [[Tony Ingham]] was signed from [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and went on to make the most ever league appearances for QPR (519). Arguably the club's greatest ever manager,<ref>[http://www.Queensparkrangersfc.com/stock.htm Alec Stock Obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025192647/http://www.queensparkrangersfc.com/stock.htm |date=25 October 2008 }} at QueensParkRangersFC.com</ref> [[Alec Stock]], arrived prior to the start of the [[1959\u201360 in English football|1959\u201360]] season. The [[1960\u201361 in English football|1960\u201361]] season saw QPR achieve their biggest win to date: 9\u20132 vs [[Tranmere Rovers]] in a Division 3 match. In time, Stock, together with [[Jim Gregory (football chairman)|Jim Gregory]] who arrived as chairman in the mid-1960s, helped to achieve a total transformation of the club and its surroundings.\n\nIn [[1966\u201367 in English football|1966\u201367]], QPR won the [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] championship and became the first Third Division club to win the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] on Saturday, 4 March 1967, beating [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] 3\u20132, coming back from a two-goal deficit. It is still the only major trophy that QPR have won. It was also the first League Cup final to be held at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. After winning promotion in 1968 to the [[Football League First Division|top flight]] for the first time in their history, Rangers were relegated after just one season and spent the next four years in [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]]. [[Terry Venables]] joined from Spurs at the beginning of the 1969\u201370 season and [[Rodney Marsh (footballer)|Rodney Marsh]] was sold to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. During this time, new QPR heroes emerged including [[Phil Parkes (footballer born 1950)|Phil Parkes]], [[Don Givens]], [[Dave Thomas (footballer born 1950)|Dave Thomas]] and Stan Bowles. These new signings were in addition to home-grown talent such as [[Dave Clement]], [[Ian Gillard]], [[Mick Leach]] and [[Gerry Francis]].\n\nIn 1974, [[Dave Sexton]] joined as manager and, in 1975\u201376 led QPR to the runners-up spot in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], missing out on the championship by one point with a squad containing seven [[England national football team|England]] internationals and internationals from the [[home nations]]. After completing their 42-game season, QPR sat at the top of the league, one point ahead of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] who went on to defeat [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] to clinch the title. Wolves were relegated to the Second Division that same season. The late 1970s also saw some cup success with Rangers reaching the semi-finals of the [[League Cup]] and in their first entry into European football reached the quarter finals of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] losing to [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] on penalties. Following Sexton's departure in 1977 the club eventually slipped into the Second Division in 1979.\n\n===1980s\u20131990s===\nIn 1980, Terry Venables took over as manager and in 1981 the club installed an [[artificial turf]] pitch. In 1982 QPR, still playing in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], reached the [[1982 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] for the only time in the club's history, facing holders [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. Tottenham won 1\u20130 in a replay. [[1982\u201383 in English football|The following season]] QPR went on to win the Second Division championship and returned to English football's top division. After a respectable fifth-place finish, and [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] qualification, the following year, Venables departed to become manager of [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. In 1988 the club had a new chairman, 24-year-old [[Richard Thompson (businessman)|Richard Thompson]]. Over the next seven years, various managers came and went from [[Loftus Road]] and the club spent many seasons finishing mid table but avoided relegation. The most successful season during this period was the [[1987\u201388 Football League|1987\u201388]] season in which QPR finished fifth, missing out on a UEFA Cup campaign due to the ban on English clubs in European competition as a result of the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. They were also runners up in the [[1986 Football League Cup Final|1986 League Cup]], losing to [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]].\n\n[[File:Queens Park Rangers badge.png|right|thumb|QPR crest used from 1982 until 2008]]\nGerry Francis, a key player in the 1970s QPR side who had proved himself as a successful manager with [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]], was appointed manager in the summer of 1991. In the [[1991\u201392 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season|1991\u201392]] First Division campaign they finished mid-table in the league and were founder members of the new [[Premier League]], finishing fifth, as top London club, in the [[1992\u201393 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season|1992\u201393]] inaugural season. Francis oversaw one of QPR's most famous victories, the 4\u20131 win at [[Old Trafford (football ground)|Old Trafford]] in front of live TV on New Year's Day 1992. Midway through the [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]] season Francis resigned and very quickly became manager of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Ray Wilkins]] was installed as [[player-manager]]. Wilkins led QPR to an eighth-place finish in the Premiership. In July 1995 the club's top goalscorer, [[Les Ferdinand]], was sold for a club record fee of \u00a36&nbsp;million to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].\n\nQPR struggled throughout the following season and were relegated at the end of the [[1995\u201396 in English football|1995\u201396 season]]. QPR then competed in Division 1 until 2001 under a succession of managers. Gerry Francis returned in 1998; however, the [[2000\u201301 in English football|2000\u20132001 season]] proved to be a disaster, and Francis resigned in early 2001.\n\n===2000\u2013present===\nCharismatic former player [[Ian Holloway]] became manager, but was unable to stop Rangers from being relegated to England's third tier for the first time for more than 30 years. Following the [[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u20132004 season]] QPR returned to Division 1 and struggled for consistent form over the next two campaigns before Holloway was suspended amidst rumours of his impending departure for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. A poor series of results and lack of progress at the club saw Holloway's successors [[Gary Waddock]] and later [[John Gregory (footballer)|John Gregory]] \u2013 both former players \u2013 fail to hold on to the manager's job.\n\nDuring this same period, QPR became embroiled in financial and boardroom controversy. Although the club had floated on the [[Alternative Investment Market]] in 1991, in 2001 it entered [[administration (insolvency)|administration]] (receivership). A period of financial hardship followed and the club left administration after receiving a \u00a310m high-interest emergency loan which continued to burden the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/coca_cola/article2271585.ece|title=''The Independent''|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107151413/http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/coca_cola/article2271585.ece|archivedate=7 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Scandals involving the directors, shareholders and others emerged in [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306 season]] and included allegations of blackmail and threats of violence against the club's chairman [[Gianni Paladini]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4751659.stm |work=BBC News |title=QPR boss recalls gunpoint threats |date=8 May 2006 }}</ref> In an unrelated incident, QPR were further rocked by the murder of youth team player [[Kiyan Prince]] on 18 May 2006<ref>{{cite news |first=Genevi\u00e8ve |last=Roberts |title=Boy, 15, stabbed to death outside school |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/article548168.ece |work=The Independent |publisher=Independent News and Media |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101070639/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/article548168.ece |archivedate=1 January 2008 }}</ref> and, in August 2007, the death of teenager and promising first-team player [[Ray Jones (footballer born 1988)|Ray Jones]] in a car crash.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/q/qpr/6963546.stm |title=QPR's Ray Jones dies in car crash |website=BBC Sport |date=25 August 2007 |accessdate=22 September 2019 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing this low point in the club's history as Rangers also faced mounting financial pressure, in the same month it was announced that the club had been bought by wealthy [[Formula One]] businessmen [[Flavio Briatore]] and [[Bernie Ecclestone]] (see ''[[Queens Park Rangers F.C.#Ownership and finances|Ownership and finances]]'' below). During the [[2007\u201308 in English football|2007\u201308]] season, Rangers competed in the [[Football League Championship]] (see also: [[2007\u201308 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season]]). John Gregory's reign as manager came to an end in October 2007 after a string of poor results left QPR at the bottom of the Championship and he was replaced by [[Luigi De Canio]] until the end of the 2007\u201308 season.

football|football]] club based in [[White City, London]]. The club currently competes in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]], the second tier of English football. They were founded in 1886 after the merger of Christchurch Rangers and St Judes Institute, although their official founding date is 1882 which is when Christchurch Rangers were first formed. In the early years after the club's formation in its original home of [[Queen's Park, London]], they played their home games at many different grounds, until finally the club settled into its current location at [[Loftus Road]], renamed [[Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium]] at the beginning of the 2019/20 season.<ref name=QPR />\n\nThe club's achievements include winning the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in [[1966\u201367 Football League Cup|1967]], and they were [[FA Cup]] finalists in [[1981\u201382 FA Cup|1982]].<ref name=QPR>{{cite web|url=http://www.qpr.co.uk/club/history/|title=Queens Park Rangers FC History|website=QPR.co.uk|publisher=Queens Park Rangers FC}}</ref> Their highest ever league finish was achieved in [[1975\u201376 Football League|1975\u201376]] when they were runners-up in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], now known as the [[Premier League]] and qualified for Europe for the first time reaching the quarter-finals of the [[1976\u201377 UEFA Cup]].\n\nQPR have long-standing rivalries with several other clubs in the London area. The most notable of these are [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]].<ref name=QPR />\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Queens Park Rangers F.C.}}\n{{see also|List of Queens Park Rangers F.C. seasons}}\n\n===1880s\u20131970s===\nThe club was formed in 1886, when a team known as '''St Jude's''' (formed in 1884) merged with '''Christchurch Rangers''' (formed in 1882).<ref>{{cite web |title=Our History&nbsp;\u2013 Key dates |url=http://www.qpr.co.uk/club/history/key-dates/ |website=QPR.co.uk |publisher=Queens Park Rangers FC |accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref> The resulting team was called Queen's Park Rangers and their official formation date is considered to be 1882, which is the original founding date of '''Christchurch Rangers.''' The club's name came from the fact most of the players came from the [[Queen's Park, London|Queen's Park]] area of north-west London. St Jude's Institute on Ilbert Street W10 is still in use as a community hall and in July 2011 club icon [[Stan Bowles]] unveiled a plaque celebrating its place in history.\n\nQPR became a professional team in 1889, and played their home games in nearly 20 different stadia (a league record), before permanently settling at [[Loftus Road]] in 1917, although the team would briefly attempt to attract larger crowds by playing at the [[White City Stadium]] for two short spells: 1931 to 1933, and the [[1962\u201363 in English football|1962\u201363]] season.<ref>{{cite book |first=Simon |last=Inglis |title=Football Grounds of Britain |year=1996 |origyear=1985 |edition=3rd |publisher=CollinsWillow |location=London |isbn=978-0-00-218426-7 |pages=305\u20136 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:QPR League Performance.svg|thumb|right|Chart showing the progress of QPR's league finishes from 1920\u201321 season to present]]\n\nQPR were promoted as champions of Division 3 South in the 1947\u201348 season. [[Dave Mangnall]] was the manager as the club participated in four seasons of the Second Division, being relegated in 1951\u201352. [[Tony Ingham]] was signed from [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and went on to make the most ever league appearances for QPR (519). Arguably the club's greatest ever manager,<ref>[http://www.Queensparkrangersfc.com/stock.htm Alec Stock Obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025192647/http://www.queensparkrangersfc.com/stock.htm |date=25 October 2008 }} at QueensParkRangersFC.com</ref> [[Alec Stock]], arrived prior to the start of the [[1959\u201360 in English football|1959\u201360]] season. The [[1960\u201361 in English football|1960\u201361]] season saw QPR achieve their biggest win to date: 9\u20132 vs [[Tranmere Rovers]] in a Division 3 match. In time, Stock, together with [[Jim Gregory (football chairman)|Jim Gregory]] who arrived as chairman in the mid-1960s, helped to achieve a total transformation of the club and its surroundings.\n\nIn [[1966\u201367 in English football|1966\u201367]], QPR won the [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] championship and became the first Third Division club to win the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] on Saturday, 4 March 1967, beating [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] 3\u20132, coming back from a two-goal deficit. It is still the only major trophy that QPR have won. It was also the first League Cup final to be held at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. After winning promotion in 1968 to the [[Football League First Division|top flight]] for the first time in their history, Rangers were relegated after just one season and spent the next four years in [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]]. [[Terry Venables]] joined from Spurs at the beginning of the 1969\u201370 season and [[Rodney Marsh (footballer)|Rodney Marsh]] was sold to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. During this time, new QPR heroes emerged including [[Phil Parkes (footballer born 1950)|Phil Parkes]], [[Don Givens]], [[Dave Thomas (footballer born 1950)|Dave Thomas]] and Stan Bowles. These new signings were in addition to home-grown talent such as [[Dave Clement]], [[Ian Gillard]], [[Mick Leach]] and [[Gerry Francis]].\n\nIn 1974, [[Dave Sexton]] joined as manager and, in 1975\u201376 led QPR to the runners-up spot in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], missing out on the championship by one point with a squad containing seven [[England national football team|England]] internationals and internationals from the [[home nations]]. After completing their 42-game season, QPR sat at the top of the league, one point ahead of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] who went on to defeat [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] to clinch the title. Wolves were relegated to the Second Division that same season. The late 1970s also saw some cup success with Rangers reaching the semi-finals of the [[League Cup]] and in their first entry into European football reached the quarter finals of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] losing to [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] on penalties. Following Sexton's departure in 1977 the club eventually slipped into the Second Division in 1979.\n\n===1980s\u20131990s===\nIn 1980, Terry Venables took over as manager and in 1981 the club installed an [[artificial turf]] pitch. In 1982 QPR, still playing in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], reached the [[1982 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] for the only time in the club's history, facing holders [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. Tottenham won 1\u20130 in a replay. [[1982\u201383 in English football|The following season]] QPR went on to win the Second Division championship and returned to English football's top division. After a respectable fifth-place finish, and [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] qualification, the following year, Venables departed to become manager of [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. In 1988 the club had a new chairman, 24-year-old [[Richard Thompson (businessman)|Richard Thompson]]. Over the next seven years, various managers came and went from [[Loftus Road]] and the club spent many seasons finishing mid table but avoided relegation. The most successful season during this period was the [[1987\u201388 Football League|1987\u201388]] season in which QPR finished fifth, missing out on a UEFA Cup campaign due to the ban on English clubs in European competition as a result of the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. They were also runners up in the [[1986 Football League Cup Final|1986 League Cup]], losing to [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]].\n\n[[File:Queens Park Rangers badge.png|right|thumb|QPR crest used from 1982 until 2008]]\nGerry Francis, a key player in the 1970s QPR side who had proved himself as a successful manager with [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]], was appointed manager in the summer of 1991. In the [[1991\u201392 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season|1991\u201392]] First Division campaign they finished mid-table in the league and were founder members of the new [[Premier League]], finishing fifth, as top London club, in the [[1992\u201393 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season|1992\u201393]] inaugural season. Francis oversaw one of QPR's most famous victories, the 4\u20131 win at [[Old Trafford (football ground)|Old Trafford]] in front of live TV on New Year's Day 1992. Midway through the [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]] season Francis resigned and very quickly became manager of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Ray Wilkins]] was installed as [[player-manager]]. Wilkins led QPR to an eighth-place finish in the Premiership. In July 1995 the club's top goalscorer, [[Les Ferdinand]], was sold for a club record fee of \u00a36&nbsp;million to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].\n\nQPR struggled throughout the following season and were relegated at the end of the [[1995\u201396 in English football|1995\u201396 season]]. QPR then competed in Division 1 until 2001 under a succession of managers. Gerry Francis returned in 1998; however, the [[2000\u201301 in English football|2000\u20132001 season]] proved to be a disaster, and Francis resigned in early 2001.\n\n===2000\u2013present===\nCharismatic former player [[Ian Holloway]] became manager, but was unable to stop Rangers from being relegated to England's third tier for the first time for more than 30 years. Following the [[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u20132004 season]] QPR returned to Division 1 and struggled for consistent form over the next two campaigns before Holloway was suspended amidst rumours of his impending departure for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. A poor series of results and lack of progress at the club saw Holloway's successors [[Gary Waddock]] and later [[John Gregory (footballer)|John Gregory]] \u2013 both former players \u2013 fail to hold on to the manager's job.\n\nDuring this same period, QPR became embroiled in financial and boardroom controversy. Although the club had floated on the [[Alternative Investment Market]] in 1991, in 2001 it entered [[administration (insolvency)|administration]] (receivership). A period of financial hardship followed and the club left administration after receiving a \u00a310m high-interest emergency loan which continued to burden the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/coca_cola/article2271585.ece|title=''The Independent''|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107151413/http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/coca_cola/article2271585.ece|archivedate=7 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Scandals involving the directors, shareholders and others emerged in [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306 season]] and included allegations of blackmail and threats of violence against the club's chairman [[Gianni Paladini]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4751659.stm |work=BBC News |title=QPR boss recalls gunpoint threats |date=8 May 2006 }}</ref> In an unrelated incident, QPR were further rocked by the murder of youth team player [[Kiyan Prince]] on 18 May 2006<ref>{{cite news |first=Genevi\u00e8ve |last=Roberts |title=Boy, 15, stabbed to death outside school |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/article548168.ece |work=The Independent |publisher=Independent News and Media |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101070639/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/article548168.ece |archivedate=1 January 2008 }}</ref> and, in August 2007, the death of teenager and promising first-team player [[Ray Jones (footballer born 1988)|Ray Jones]] in a car crash.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/q/qpr/6963546.stm |title=QPR's Ray Jones dies in car crash |website=BBC Sport |date=25 August 2007 |accessdate=22 September 2019 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing this low point in the club's history as Rangers also faced mounting financial pressure, in the same month it was announced that the club had been bought by wealthy [[Formula One]] businessmen [[Flavio Briatore]] and [[Bernie Ecclestone]] (see ''[[Queens Park Rangers F.C.#Ownership and finances|Ownership and finances]]'' below). During the [[2007\u201308 in English football|2007\u201308]] season, Rangers competed in the [[Football League Championship]] (see also: [[2007\u201308 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season]]). John Gregory's reign as manager came to an end in October 2007 after a string of poor results left QPR at the bottom of the Championship and he was replaced by [[Luigi De Canio]] until the end of the 2007\u201308 season.

It was designed by Dan Bunten (later [[Danielle Bunten Berry]]).\n\n''M.U.L.E.'' was ported to the [[Commodore 64]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], and [[IBM PCjr]].<ref>{{moby developer|id=8515|name=Danielle Berry}}</ref>  Japanese versions also exist for the PC-8801,<ref>{{cite web|title=Entry with PC-88 info and shots at Mobygames|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/pc88/mule|accessdate=19 May 2011}}</ref> the Sharp X1,<ref>{{cite web|title=Entry at thelegacy.de with screenshots of the X1 port|url=http://www.thelegacy.de/Museum/6820/|accessdate=19 May 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DzVfMf3b?url=http://www.thelegacy.de/Museum/6820/|archive-date=27 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> and MSX 2 computers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Entry at Generation-MSX|url=http://www.generation-msx.nl/msxdb/softwareinfo/1224|accessdate=19 May 2011}}</ref>  While it plays like a [[strategy video game|strategy game]], it incorporates aspects that simulate [[economics]].\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\n[[Image:M.U.L.E..png|framed|left|A Multiple Use Labor Element, the eponymous M.U.L.E.]]\n\nSet on the fictional planet Irata (which is ''[[Atari]]'' backwards), the game is an exercise in [[supply and demand]] [[economics]] involving competition among four players, with computer opponents automatically filling in for any missing players. Players are provided with several different choices for the race of their colonist, providing different advantages and disadvantages that can be paired to their respective strategies. To win, players not only compete against each other to amass the largest amount of wealth but must also cooperate for the survival of the colony.\n\nCentral to the game is the acquisition and use of \"M.U.L.E.\"s (''Multiple Use Labor Element'') to develop and harvest resources from the player's [[real estate]]. Depending on how it is outfitted, a M.U.L.E. can be configured to harvest Energy, Food, Smithore (from which M.U.L.E.s are constructed), and Crystite (a valuable mineral available only at the \"Tournament\" level). Players must balance supply and demand of these elements, buying what they need and selling what they don't. Players may also exploit or create shortages by refusing to sell to other players or to the \"store,\" which raises the price of the resource on the following turns. Scheming between players is encouraged by allowing [[collusion]], which initiates a mode allowing a private transaction. Crystite is the one commodity that is not influenced by supply and demand considerations, being deemed to be sold 'off world,' so the strategy with this resource is somewhat different\u2014a player may attempt to maximize production without fear of having too much supply for the demand.\n\nEach resource is required to do certain things on each turn. For instance, if a player is short on Food, there will be less time to take one's turn.  Similarly, if a player is short on Energy, some land plots won't produce any output, while a shortage of Smithore will raise the price of M.U.L.E.s in the store and prevent the store from manufacturing new M.U.L.E.s to make use of one's land.\n\nPlayers must also deal with periodic random events such as run-away M.U.L.E.s, sunspot activity, theft by space pirates, and meteorites,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/081/081722p1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618153951/http://pc.ign.com/articles/081/081722p1.html|archivedate=2007-06-18 |title=PC Retroview: M.U.L.E. - PC Feature at IGN |publisher=Pc.ign.com |date=2000-07-05 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}</ref> with potentially destructive and beneficial effects. Because of [[dynamic game difficulty balancing]], random favorable events never happen to the player currently in first place, while unfavorable events never happen to the player in last place.<ref name=\"cgw199208\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=97 | title=Designing People... | work=Computer Gaming World | date=August 1992 | accessdate=3 July 2014 | pages=48\u201354}}</ref> This same \"leveling of the playfield\" is applied whenever a tie happens in the game (e.g. when two players want to buy a resource at the same price); the player in the losing position automatically wins the tie. The players also can [[Hunt the Wumpus|hunt the mountain wampus]] for a cash reward.\n\n== Development ==\n\nAccording to Jim Rushing (one of the four original partners in Ozark Softscape), ''M.U.L.E.'' was initially called ''Planet Pioneers'' during development.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.worldofmule.net/tiki-index.php?page=MechanicalDonkeysJimRushing | title = Mechanical Donkeys | accessdate = 2009-03-24 | last = Szczepaniak | first = John | work = The Gamer's Quarter, Issue #6 | publisher = World of M.U.L.E. | quote = Rushing: We can discuss more on phone, but ...

The board game [[Monopoly (game)|''Monopoly'']] was used as a model for the game because of its encouragement of social interaction and for several of the game's elements: the acquisition and development of land as a primary task, a production advantage for grouped plots, different species (\u00e0 la the different player tokens), and random events similar to \"Chance\" cards.<ref name = \"CGW\">{{Cite news | date = April 1984 | last = Bunten | first = Dan | author-link = Danielle Bunten Berry | periodical = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Dispatches / Insights from the Strategy Game Design Front| pages = 17, 42 }}</ref>  Additional game features such as claim jumping, loans, and crystite depletion were discarded for adding complexity without enhancing gameplay.\n\nThe setting was inspired by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'', wherein galactic colonization is in the style of the [[American Old West]]: A few pioneers with drive and primitive tools. The M.U.L.E. itself is based on the idea of the [[genetically modified animal]] in Heinlein's novel and given the appearance of a [[AT-AT|''Star Wars'' Imperial Walker]]. Another Heinlein novel, ''[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]]'', provided the decision to not have any government or external authority. In the game's original designs, land was sold by auction, but this caused a [[feedback loop]] in which the wealthiest player had the most land and thus made the most money; thus, the developers created the \"land authority\" that gives each player a free plot of land each turn.<ref name = \"CGW\" />\n\nOzark Softscape developed the game for the [[Atari 8-bit family]] first because of its policy of developing for the most advanced computers then [[porting]] them to other platforms, removing or altering features such as [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s as necessary. Bunten stated that Ozark did not port the game to the [[Apple II]] because \"''M.U.L.E.'' can't be done for an Apple\".<ref name=\"bunten198412\">{{cite news | title=Dispatches / Insights From the Strategy Game Design Front | work=Computer Gaming World | date=December 1984 | author=Bunten, Dan | pages=40}}</ref> The [[IBM PC]] port of ''M.U.L.E'' was developed by K-Byte Software, an affiliate of Electronic Arts, and published by IBM as part of their venture into the home market with the [[IBM PCjr]], but it sold poorly due to being released in 1985 after the latter had been discontinued (although the game did not have any actual PCjr support).\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| CGW = {{rating|5|5}}{{r|brooks199211}}\n}}\n\n''M.U.L.E.'' only sold 30,000 copies<ref name=\"CGW2\">{{Cite news | date = February 1989 | periodical = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Notes on the Conference on Computer Game Design | pages = 16\u201317, 28\u201329, 54\u201355 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Players are provided with several different choices for the race of their colonist, providing different advantages and disadvantages that can be paired to their respective strategies. To win, players not only compete against each other to amass the largest amount of wealth but must also cooperate for the survival of the colony.\n\nCentral to the game is the acquisition and use of \"M.U.L.E.\"s (''Multiple Use Labor Element'') to develop and harvest resources from the player's [[real estate]]. Depending on how it is outfitted, a M.U.L.E. can be configured to harvest Energy, Food, Smithore (from which M.U.L.E.s are constructed), and Crystite (a valuable mineral available only at the \"Tournament\" level). Players must balance supply and demand of these elements, buying what they need and selling what they don't. Players may also exploit or create shortages by refusing to sell to other players or to the \"store,\" which raises the price of the resource on the following turns. Scheming between players is encouraged by allowing [[collusion]], which initiates a mode allowing a private transaction. Crystite is the one commodity that is not influenced by supply and demand considerations, being deemed to be sold 'off world,' so the strategy with this resource is somewhat different\u2014a player may attempt to maximize production without fear of having too much supply for the demand.\n\nEach resource is required to do certain things on each turn. For instance, if a player is short on Food, there will be less time to take one's turn.  Similarly, if a player is short on Energy, some land plots won't produce any output, while a shortage of Smithore will raise the price of M.U.L.E.s in the store and prevent the store from manufacturing new M.U.L.E.s to make use of one's land.\n\nPlayers must also deal with periodic random events such as run-away M.U.L.E.s, sunspot activity, theft by space pirates, and meteorites,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/081/081722p1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618153951/http://pc.ign.com/articles/081/081722p1.html|archivedate=2007-06-18 |title=PC Retroview: M.U.L.E. - PC Feature at IGN |publisher=Pc.ign.com |date=2000-07-05 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}</ref> with potentially destructive and beneficial effects.

The players also can [[Hunt the Wumpus|hunt the mountain wampus]] for a cash reward.\n\n== Development ==\n\nAccording to Jim Rushing (one of the four original partners in Ozark Softscape), ''M.U.L.E.'' was initially called ''Planet Pioneers'' during development.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.worldofmule.net/tiki-index.php?page=MechanicalDonkeysJimRushing | title = Mechanical Donkeys | accessdate = 2009-03-24 | last = Szczepaniak | first = John | work = The Gamer's Quarter, Issue #6 | publisher = World of M.U.L.E. | quote = Rushing: We can discuss more on phone, but ...

The board game [[Monopoly (game)|''Monopoly'']] was used as a model for the game because of its encouragement of social interaction and for several of the game's elements: the acquisition and development of land as a primary task, a production advantage for grouped plots, different species (\u00e0 la the different player tokens), and random events similar to \"Chance\" cards.<ref name = \"CGW\">{{Cite news | date = April 1984 | last = Bunten | first = Dan | author-link = Danielle Bunten Berry | periodical = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Dispatches / Insights from the Strategy Game Design Front| pages = 17, 42 }}</ref>  Additional game features such as claim jumping, loans, and crystite depletion were discarded for adding complexity without enhancing gameplay.\n\nThe setting was inspired by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'', wherein galactic colonization is in the style of the [[American Old West]]: A few pioneers with drive and primitive tools. The M.U.L.E. itself is based on the idea of the [[genetically modified animal]] in Heinlein's novel and given the appearance of a [[AT-AT|''Star Wars'' Imperial Walker]].

At Keela, the line splits with a branch heading south and east to [[Okeelanta, Florida|Okeelanta]] while the main line heads east from Keela to Lake Harbor, where it crosses the [[Miami Canal]] and connects with the east side.\n\nThe northernmost 42 miles of the west side between Sebring and Harrisburg was built in 1916 by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad as part of an effort to extend their [[Haines City Branch]] south to [[Immokalee, Florida|Immokalee]].  Harrisburg was named after the Harris track-laying machine used to construct the line.  Trackage south of Harrisburg to Immokalee, which went as far south as [[Everglades City, Florida|Everglades City]] via the former [[Deep Lake Railroad]] at one time, was abandoned in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Turner\">{{cite book| last =Turner | first =Gregg M. | title =Railroads of Southwest Florida | publisher =Arcadia Publishing | series =Images of America | date =December 1, 1999}}</ref>  \n\nThe Atlantic Coast Line built tracks from Harrisburg to Moore Haven in 1918.  In 1921, the '''Moore Haven & Clewiston Railway''' was built, which extended the Coast Line's tracks to Clewiston.  The Coast Line leased the Moore Haven & Clewiston Railway in 1925, and extended it to Lake Harbor in 1929.  Even in its early days, the line mostly served U.S. Sugar, who built and operated their own small branch near Clewiston and Lake Okeechobee that connected to the Coast Line.  By 1944, the Coast Line completely bought out the Moore Haven & Clewiston Railway.<ref name=\"Turner\"/>\n\nThrough mergers, the Atlantic Coast Line network would become part of [[CSX Transportation]] by 1986. CSX operated the line as their Sebring Subdivision along the main line to the sugar fields and Okeelanta Subdivision on the branch to Okeelanta.<ref>[http://www.multimodalways.org/docs/railroads/companies/SCL/SCL%20ETTs/SCL%20Jville%20%26%20Tampa%20Divs%20ETT%20%238%2010-30-1977.pdf Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Jacksonville Division and Tampa Division Timetable (1977)]</ref>\n\nThe west side was bought from CSX on June 2, 1990, by the [[Brandywine Valley Railroad]], a [[Lukens Steel Company]] subsidiary, and sold to U.S. Sugar on September 17, 1994.
