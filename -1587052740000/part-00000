Jahrhundert entstanden in Russland vor allem in der Gegend um das heutige Sankt Petersburg und in Moskau sp\u00e4ter hierzulande so bezeichnete \u201eRussische Berge\u201c oder auch \u201eRutschberge\u201c. Bei Wintertemperaturen wurden Rampen aus Holz mit Schnee und Eis bedeckt, sodass auf einer mehrere Zentimeter starken Eisschicht diese k\u00fcnstlichen \u201eBerge\u201c hinuntergerutscht werden konnte. Um die Vereisung zu halten, wurde sie t\u00e4glich mit gefrierendem Wasser \u00fcbergossen. Als \u201eSchlitten\u201c wurden zun\u00e4chst Eisbl\u00f6cke benutzt, auf denen ein Sitz aus Holz und Wolle f\u00fcr die Fahrer befestigt wurde. Die Bahnen waren vor allem unter der reicheren Bev\u00f6lkerung und Adeligen beliebt und wurden teilweise aufwendig gestaltet, dekoriert und mit B\u00e4umen umpflanzt. H\u00e4ufig ist zu lesen, Napoleons Soldaten h\u00e4tten die unter dem franz\u00f6sischen Namen Montagnes Russes bekanntgewordene Erfindung w\u00e4hrend des Russlandfeldzugs kennengelernt und sie mit nach Westeuropa, insbesondere nach Frankreich gebracht. Es gibt aber Berichte, nach denen schon 1804 im Quartier des Ternes in Paris ein Russischer Berg in Betrieb war. Wegen h\u00e4ufiger Unf\u00e4lle wurde er stillgelegt.[1] \nRussische Truppen brachten sie 1813 erneut nach Paris, von wo aus sie sich auch im deutschsprachigen Raum eine gewisse Zeit verbreiteten. Man fuhr nun auch ohne Eis auf Schlitten, die in Schienen glitten, \u201e\u2026 welche am Ende des Wegs oft eine aufrechte Schlinge bildeten, die man, durch die Zentrifugalkraft gehalten, mit nach unten h\u00e4ngendem Kopf durchfuhr\u201c.[2][3]\n\nThe sport of luge, like the [[Skeleton (sport)|skeleton]] and the [[bobsleigh]], originated in the health-spa town of [[St Moritz]], [[Switzerland]], in the mid-to-late 19th century, through the endeavours of hotel entrepreneur [[Caspar Badrutt]]. Badrutt successfully sold the idea of winter resorting, as well as rooms with food, drink, and activities. His more adventurous English guests began adapting delivery boys' sleds for recreation, which led to collisions with pedestrians as they sped down the lanes and alleys of the village.\n\nThe first organized meeting of the sport took place in 1883 in [[Switzerland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fil-luge.org/ |title=International Luge Federation |publisher=Fil-luge.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-25}}</ref> In 1913, the Internationale Schlittensportverband or International Sled Sports Federation was founded in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]]. This body governed the sport until 1935, when it was incorporated in the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing]] (FIBT, International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation). After it had been decided that luge would replace the sport of [[Skeleton (sport)|skeleton]] at the [[Olympic Games]], the first [[FIL World Luge Championships|World Championships]] in the sport were held in [[FIL World Luge Championships 1955|1955]] in [[Oslo]] ([[Norway]]). In 1957, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Luge de Course]] (FIL, International Luge Federation) was founded. Luge events were first included in the [[Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Luge at the 1964 Winter Olympics|1964]].\n\nAmericans were slow to adopt the sport of luge. The first luge run in North America was built at [[Lolo Hot Springs, Montana]], in 1965.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Delta Sky Mag|date=January 2011|pages=124}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Briggeman\n| first = Kim\n| title = Lolo Hot Springs was home to first, 'pretty crude' American luge run\n| work = [[Missoulian]]\n| accessdate = 2014-02-07\n| date = 2014-02-06\n| url = http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/lolo-hot-springs-was-home-to-first-pretty-crude-american/article_1f7f3830-8f93-11e3-830f-0019bb2963f4.html\n}}</ref> Although the United States competed in every Olympic luge event from 1964 through 1976, it was not until 1979 that the United States Luge Association was founded. The first artificial American track was completed in that year for use in the 1980 XIII Winter Olympic Games at Lake Placid, New York.<ref name=\"usaluge1\"/>\nSince that time the United States luge program has greatly improved. A second artificial track was constructed near [[Park City, Utah]], for the 2002 XIX Olympic Winter Games at Salt Lake City.\n\n\n==Artificial track luge called olympic luge==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C0223-0007-003, Friedrichroda, Deutsche Meisterschaften, Rennrodeln.jpg|thumb|right|German luger [[Thomas K\u00f6hler]] in 1964]]\n[[File:Mortensen and Griffall.jpg|thumb|Matt Mortensen (top) and Preston Griffall (bottom) are clocked at 80 miles per hour on a run at Sanki Sliding Centre in Krasnaya Polyana, Russia.]]\n\n[[File:Utah Olympic track.jpg|thumb|Curves 11 and 12 on the Utah Olympic track near Park City, Utah.]]\n{{Details|List of bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton tracks}}\n\nA '''luge''' {{IPAc-en|l|u\u02d0|\u0292}} is a small one- or two-person [[sled]] on which one sleds [[Supine position|supine]] (face up) and feet-first. A luger steers by using their [[Calf (leg)|calf]] muscles to flex the sled's runners or by exerting opposite shoulder pressure to the seat.

Most tracks are artificially refrigerated, but artificial tracks without artificial cooling also exist (for example, in [[St. Moritz]]). Tracks tend to be very smooth.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe athletes ride in a flat, aerodynamic position on the sled, keeping their heads low to minimize air resistance. They steer the sled mainly with their calves by applying pressure on the runners\u2014right calf to turn left, left calf to turn right. It takes a precise mix of shifting body weight, applying pressure with calves and rolling the shoulders. There are also handles for minor adjustments. A successful luger maintains complete concentration and relaxation on the sled while traveling at high speeds. Most lugers \"visualize\" the course in their minds before sliding.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Fastest times result from following the perfect \"line\" down the track. Any slight error, such as brush against the wall, costs time. Track conditions are also important. Softer ice tends to slow speeds, while harder ice tends to lead to faster times. Lugers race at speeds averaging {{convert|120|\u2013|145|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} around high banked curves while experiencing a centripetal acceleration of up to 5g. Men's Singles have their start locations near where the [[bobsled]] and [[skeleton(sport)|skeleton]] competitors start at most tracks, while both the Doubles and Women's Singles competition have their starthouse located farther down the track.

They are naturally iced. Tracks can get rough from the braking and steering action. Athletes use a steering rein and drag their hands and use their legs in order to drive around the tight flat corners. Braking is often required in front of curves and is accomplished by the use of spikes built on the bottom of the shoes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMost of the tracks are situated in Austria and Italy, with others in Germany, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Canada, Switzerland, Croatia, Liechtenstein, Turkey, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Bulgaria, Romania, New Zealand and the United States.

A touchpad at the bottom of the run is touched by a competitor signaling a teammate at the top of the run to start.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nRules and procedures for races are very precise:\n* A drawing is held to determine start order for the race. Athletes are assigned a number which is displayed on a bib. During major national and international events, men's singles consists of four runs. Women's singles and doubles competitions consist of two runs. The cumulative time of all runs is used to determine finish order. In all three events, the start order after the first run is determined by the outcome of the previous run, with the last-place slider sliding first, the next-to-last place slider sliding second, and so forth, with the leader of the previous run sliding last.<ref name=\":2\" />\n* Physical measurements of the sled are taken, and the temperature of the sled's steel blades is checked and may not be more than {{convert|5|\u00b0C}} above that of a previously established control temperature. Additionally, for artificial track races, the athlete must first be weighed. This is to determine whether the athlete is entitled to carry extra weight on their body while sliding. Men may use additional weight amounting to 75% of the difference between body weight and a base weight of {{convert|90|kg}}. Women may use additional weight amounting to 50% of the difference between body weight and a base weight of {{convert|70|kg}}. Doubles athletes may use additional weight amounting to 50% of the difference between body weight and a base weight of {{convert|90|kg}}. Additional weight is not allowed if the body weight of the front person and back person together exceeds {{convert|180|kg}}.<ref name=\":2\" /> If one of the partners weighs more than {{convert|90|kg}}, the weight exceeding the {{convert|90|kg}} mark is added to the lighter partner. If there should still be a difference between the partner's weight and the {{convert|90|kg}} mark, the difference can be compensated according to an official weight table.<ref name=\"usaluge2\"/> Between runs, athletes are randomly selected for additional weight checks. Before each run, the sled (with the athlete, for artificial track races) is weighed at the start ramp.\n* Once an athlete is on their sled, they are audibly notified that the track is clear. At this point, a tone sounds and the athlete has thirty seconds to begin their run. A run becomes official when an athlete and their sled, in contact with one another, crosses the finish line. If an athlete and sled are not within contact of one another, the athlete is disqualified from further competition. Disqualifications may also take place for any violation of rules and regulations. Certain disqualifications may be appealed.<ref name=\"usaluge2\"/><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Training==\nThe sport of luge requires an athlete to balance mental and physical fitness. Physically, a luger must have strong neck, upper body, abdominal, and thigh muscles. Athletes also use Wind Tunnels to train<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://freshwater-and-saltwater.webnode.com/title=Rules to play Luge|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|title=Freshwater-and-saltwater}}</ref>  [[Strength training]] is essential to withstand the extreme G-forces of tight turns at high speeds. Since lugers have very little protection other than a visor and helmet, they must be able to endure the physical pounding administered by the track when mistakes are made.\n\n==Risks==\nAs with many [[extreme sports]], luging has risks. Though most injuries involve bumps, bruises, broken bones and concussions, fatalities do occasionally occur.

Badrutt successfully sold the idea of winter resorting, as well as rooms with food, drink, and activities. His more adventurous English guests began adapting delivery boys' sleds for recreation, which led to collisions with pedestrians as they sped down the lanes and alleys of the village.\n\nThe first organized meeting of the sport took place in 1883 in [[Switzerland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fil-luge.org/ |title=International Luge Federation |publisher=Fil-luge.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-25}}</ref> In 1913, the Internationale Schlittensportverband or International Sled Sports Federation was founded in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]]. This body governed the sport until 1935, when it was incorporated in the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing]] (FIBT, International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation). After it had been decided that luge would replace the sport of [[Skeleton (sport)|skeleton]] at the [[Olympic Games]], the first [[FIL World Luge Championships|World Championships]] in the sport were held in [[FIL World Luge Championships 1955|1955]] in [[Oslo]] ([[Norway]]). In 1957, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Luge de Course]] (FIL, International Luge Federation) was founded. Luge events were first included in the [[Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Luge at the 1964 Winter Olympics|1964]].\n\nAmericans were slow to adopt the sport of luge. The first luge run in North America was built at [[Lolo Hot Springs, Montana]], in 1965.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Delta Sky Mag|date=January 2011|pages=124}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Briggeman\n| first = Kim\n| title = Lolo Hot Springs was home to first, 'pretty crude' American luge run\n| work = [[Missoulian]]\n| accessdate = 2014-02-07\n| date = 2014-02-06\n| url = http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/lolo-hot-springs-was-home-to-first-pretty-crude-american/article_1f7f3830-8f93-11e3-830f-0019bb2963f4.html\n}}</ref> Although the United States competed in every Olympic luge event from 1964 through 1976, it was not until 1979 that the United States Luge Association was founded. The first artificial American track was completed in that year for use in the 1980 XIII Winter Olympic Games at Lake Placid, New York.<ref name=\"usaluge1\"/>\nSince that time the United States luge program has greatly improved. A second artificial track was constructed near [[Park City, Utah]], for the 2002 XIX Olympic Winter Games at Salt Lake City.\n\nCaitlin Nash and Natalie Corless, both of Canada, became the first all-female team to compete in a World Cup doubles race in luge in 2019.<ref>https://www.thestar.com/sports/2019/12/14/canadian-lugers-caitlin-nash-and-natalie-corless-become-the-first-female-team-to-compete-in-a-world-cup-doubles-race.html</ref>\n\n==Artificial tracks==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C0223-0007-003, Friedrichroda, Deutsche Meisterschaften, Rennrodeln.jpg|thumb|right|German luger [[Thomas K\u00f6hler]] in 1964]]\n[[File:Mortensen and Griffall.jpg|thumb|Matt Mortensen (top) and Preston Griffall (bottom) are clocked at 80 miles per hour on a run at Sanki Sliding Centre in Krasnaya Polyana, Russia.]]\n\n[[File:Utah Olympic track.jpg|thumb|Curves 11 and 12 on the Utah Olympic track near Park City, Utah.]]\n{{Details|List of bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton tracks}}\n\nArtificial luge tracks have specially designed and constructed banked curves plus walled-in straights. Most tracks are artificially refrigerated, but artificial tracks without artificial cooling also exist (for example, in [[St. Moritz]]). Tracks tend to be very smooth.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe athletes ride in a flat, aerodynamic position on the sled, keeping their heads low to minimize air resistance. They steer the sled mainly with their calves by applying pressure on the runners\u2014right calf to turn left, left calf to turn right. It takes a precise mix of shifting body weight, applying pressure with calves and rolling the shoulders. There are also handles for minor adjustments. A successful luger maintains complete concentration and relaxation on the sled while traveling at high speeds. Most lugers \"visualize\" the course in their minds before sliding.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Fastest times result from following the perfect \"line\" down the track. Any slight error, such as brush against the wall, costs time. Track conditions are also important. Softer ice tends to slow speeds, while harder ice tends to lead to faster times. Lugers race at speeds averaging {{convert|120|\u2013|145|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} around high banked curves while experiencing a centripetal acceleration of up to 5g. Men's Singles have their start locations near where the [[bobsled]] and [[skeleton(sport)|skeleton]] competitors start at most tracks, while both the Doubles and Women's Singles competition have their starthouse located farther down the track.

They are naturally iced. Tracks can get rough from the braking and steering action. Athletes use a steering rein and drag their hands and use their legs in order to drive around the tight flat corners. Braking is often required in front of curves and is accomplished by the use of spikes built on the bottom of the shoes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMost of the tracks are situated in Austria and Italy, with others in Germany, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Canada, Switzerland, Croatia, Liechtenstein, Turkey, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Bulgaria, Romania, New Zealand and the United States.

Athletes are assigned a number which is displayed on a bib. During major national and international events, men's singles consists of four runs. Women's singles and doubles competitions consist of two runs. The cumulative time of all runs is used to determine finish order. In all three events, the start order after the first run is determined by the outcome of the previous run, with the last-place slider sliding first, the next-to-last place slider sliding second, and so forth, with the leader of the previous run sliding last.<ref name=\":2\" />\n* Physical measurements of the sled are taken, and the temperature of the sled's steel blades is checked and may not be more than {{convert|5|\u00b0C}} above that of a previously established control temperature. Additionally, for artificial track races, the athlete must first be weighed. This is to determine whether the athlete is entitled to carry extra weight on their body while sliding. Men may use additional weight amounting to 75% of the difference between body weight and a base weight of {{convert|90|kg}}. Women may use additional weight amounting to 50% of the difference between body weight and a base weight of {{convert|70|kg}}. Doubles athletes may use additional weight amounting to 50% of the difference between body weight and a base weight of {{convert|90|kg}}. Additional weight is not allowed if the body weight of the front person and back person together exceeds {{convert|180|kg}}.<ref name=\":2\" /> If one of the partners weighs more than {{convert|90|kg}}, the weight exceeding the {{convert|90|kg}} mark is added to the lighter partner. If there should still be a difference between the partner's weight and the {{convert|90|kg}} mark, the difference can be compensated according to an official weight table.<ref name=\"usaluge2\"/> Between runs, athletes are randomly selected for additional weight checks. Before each run, the sled (with the athlete, for artificial track races) is weighed at the start ramp.\n* Once an athlete is on their sled, they are audibly notified that the track is clear. At this point, a tone sounds and the athlete has thirty seconds to begin their run. A run becomes official when an athlete and their sled, in contact with one another, crosses the finish line. If an athlete and sled are not within contact of one another, the athlete is disqualified from further competition. Disqualifications may also take place for any violation of rules and regulations. Certain disqualifications may be appealed.<ref name=\"usaluge2\"/><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Training==\nThe sport of luge requires an athlete to balance mental and physical fitness. Physically, a luger must have strong neck, upper body, abdominal, and thigh muscles. Athletes also use Wind Tunnels to train<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://freshwater-and-saltwater.webnode.com/title=Rules to play Luge|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|title=Freshwater-and-saltwater}}</ref>  [[Strength training]] is essential to withstand the extreme G-forces of tight turns at high speeds. Since lugers have very little protection other than a visor and helmet, they must be able to endure the physical pounding administered by the track when mistakes are made.\n\n==Risks==\nAs with many [[extreme sports]], luging has risks. Though most injuries involve bumps, bruises, broken bones and concussions, fatalities do occasionally occur.

He wears a man's conical cap but female garments, following the Greek custom of men playing the roles of women.<br>Later slave women were brought in to play minor female characters and in comedy as well.150-100 BC.]]\nThe '''ancient Greek drama''' was a [[Theatre|theatrical]] [[culture]] that flourished in [[ancient Greece]] from 600 BC. The [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]], which became a significant  cultural, political, and military power during this period, was its center, where it was [[institution]]alised as part of a [[festival]] called the [[Dionysia]], which honored the god [[Dionysus]]. [[Greek tragedy|Tragedy]] (late 500 BC), [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]] (490 BC), and the [[satyr play]] were the three [[drama]]tic [[genre]]s to emerge there. Athens exported the festival to its numerous colonies.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 ('tragodia'), from which the word \"[[tragedy]]\" is derived, is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of two [[Greek language|Greek]] words: \u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 (''tragos'') or \"goat\" and \u1fa0\u03b4\u03ae (''[[ode]]'') meaning \"song\", from \u1f00\u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (''aeidein''), \"to sing\".<ref>[http://m-w.com/dictionary/tragedy Merriam-Webster definition of tragedy]</ref>\nThis etymology indicates a link with the practices of the ancient [[Cult of Dionysus|Dionysian cults]]. It is impossible, however, to know with certainty how these [[Fertility rite|fertility rituals]] became the basis for tragedy and [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]].<ref name=\"Redgeway\">{{harvp|Ridgeway|1910|p=83}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n{{Main|Greek tragedy}}\n\n[[File:2007-05-10 Epidauros, Greece 5.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Panoramic view of [[Ancient Theatre of Epidaurus|the ancient theatre]] at [[Epidaurus]].]]\n\nThe classical Greeks valued the power of spoken word, and it was their main method of communication and storytelling. Bahn and Bahn write, \"To Greeks the spoken word was a living thing and infinitely preferable to the dead symbols of a written language.\" [[Socrates]] himself believed that once something has been written down, it lost its ability for change and growth. For these reasons, among many others, oral storytelling flourished in Greece.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Oral Interpretation|last1=Bahn|first1=Eugene|last2=Bahn|first2=Margaret L.|lastauthoramp=yes|publisher=Burgess Publishing Company|year=1970|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nGreek tragedy as we know it was created in Athens around the time of 532 BC, when [[Thespis]] was the earliest recorded actor. Being a winner of the first theatrical contest held in Athens, he was the ''exarchon'', or leader,<ref>Aristotle, '[[Poetics]]'</ref> of the [[dithyramb]]s performed in and around Attica, especially at the rural [[Dionysia]]. By Thespis' time, the dithyramb had evolved far away from its cult roots. Under the influence of heroic epic, Doric choral lyric and the innovations of the poet Arion, it had become a narrative, ballad-like genre. Because of these, Thespis is often called the \"Father of Tragedy\"; however, his importance is disputed, and Thespis is sometimes listed as late as 16th in the chronological order of Greek tragedians; the statesman [[Solon]], for example, is credited with creating poems in which characters speak with their own voice, and spoken performances of [[Homer]]'s epics by [[rhapsode]]s were popular in festivals prior to 534 BC.<ref name=\"Brockett\">{{harvp|Brockett|1999|pp=16\u201317}}</ref> Thus, Thespis's true contribution to drama is unclear at best, but his name has been given a longer life, in English, as a common term for performer \u2014 i.e., a \"thespian.\"\n\nThe dramatic performances were important to the Athenians \u2013 this is made clear by the creation of a tragedy competition and festival in the City Dionysia. This was organized possibly to foster loyalty among the tribes of Attica (recently created by [[Cleisthenes]]). The festival was created roughly around 508 BC. While no drama texts exist from the sixth century BC, we do know the names of three competitors besides Thespis: Choerilus, Pratinas, and [[Phrynichus (tragic poet)|Phrynichus]]. Each is credited with different innovations in the field.\n\nSome is known about Phrynichus. He won his first competition between 511 BC and 508 BC. He produced tragedies on themes and subjects later exploited in the golden age such as the ''Danaids'', ''Phoenician Women'' and ''Alcestis''. He was the first poet we know of to use a historical subject \u2013 his ''Fall of Miletus'', produced in 493-2, chronicled the fate of the town of Miletus after it was conquered by the Persians. Herodotus reports that \"the Athenians made clear their deep grief for the taking of Miletus in many ways, but especially in this: when Phrynichus wrote a play entitled \"The Fall of Miletus\" and produced it, the whole theatre fell to weeping; they fined Phrynichus a thousand drachmas for bringing to mind a calamity that affected them so personally and forbade the performance of that play forever.\"<ref>[http://perseus.uchicago.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0126:book=6:chapter=21 Herodotus, ''Histories'', 6/21]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He is also thought to be the first to use female characters (though not female performers).<ref>{{harvp|Brockett|1999|p=17}}</ref>\n\nUntil the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic period]], all tragedies were unique pieces written in honour of Dionysus and played only once, so that today we primarily have the pieces that were still remembered well enough to have been repeated when the repetition of old tragedies became fashionable (the accidents of survival, as well as the subjective tastes of the Hellenistic librarians later in Greek history, also played a role in what survived from this period).\n\n==New inventions during the classical period==\n[[File:Theater of Dionysius, Athens, Greece. (2826099154).jpg|thumbnail|left|Theater of Dionysus, Athens, Greece. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]\nAfter the Great Destruction of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] in 480 BCE, the town of Agios Prokopios and acropolis were rebuilt, and theatre became formalized and an even greater part of Athenian culture and civil pride. This century is normally regarded as the [[Age of Pericles|Golden Age]] of Greek drama. The centre-piece of the annual Dionysia, which took place once in winter and once in spring, was a competition between three tragic playwrights at the [[Theatre of Dionysus]]. Each submitted three tragedies, plus a satyr play (a comic, [[burlesque]] version of a mythological subject). Beginning in a first competition in 486 BC each playwright submitted a comedy.<ref>{{harvp|Kuritz|1988|p=21}}</ref> [[Aristotle]] claimed that [[Aeschylus]] added the second actor ([[deuteragonist]]), and that [[Sophocles]] introduced the third ([[tritagonist]]). Apparently the Greek playwrights never used more than three actors based on what is known about Greek theatre.<ref>{{harvp|Kuritz|1988|p=24}}</ref>\n\n[[Greek Tragedy|Tragedy]] and [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]] were viewed as completely separate genres, and no plays ever merged aspects of the two. [[Satyr play]]s dealt with the mythological subject matter of the tragedies, but in a purely comedic manner.\n\n==Hellenistic period==\n\n[[File:Relief with Menander and New Comedy Masks - Princeton Art Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Roman, [[Roman Republic|Republican]] or [[Roman Empire|Early Imperial]], ''Relief of a seated poet ([[Menander]]) with masks of New Comedy'', 1st century B.C. \u2013 early 1st century A.D., [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]\n\nThe power of Athens declined following its defeat in the [[Peloponnesian War]] against the Spartans. From that time on, the theatre started performing old tragedies again. Although its theatrical traditions seem to have lost their vitality, Greek theatre continued into the [[Hellenistic]] period (the period following [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquests in the fourth century BCE). However, the primary Hellenistic theatrical form was not tragedy but '[[Greek comedy#New Comedy|New Comedy]]', comic episodes about the lives of ordinary citizens. The only extant playwright from the period is [[Menander]]. One of New Comedy's most important contributions was its influence on Roman comedy, an influence that can be seen in the surviving works of [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]].\n\n==Architecture==\n{{see also|Roman theatre (structure)}}\n[[File:GriechTheater2.PNG|thumb|right|Labelled drawing of an ancient theatre.

In cities without suitable hills, banks of earth were piled up.<ref name=Lawrence>{{cite book |last1=Lawrence |first1=A. W. |last2=Tomlinson |first2=R.

There were often tall, arched entrances called [[parodos|parodoi]] or [[eisodos|eisodoi]], through which actors and chorus members entered and exited the orchestra. In some theatres, behind the orchestra was a backdrop or scenic wall known as the ''sken\u00e9''. The term \"theatre\" eventually came to mean to the whole area of theatron, orchestra, and sken\u00e9.\n\n[[File:Delphi Composite.jpg|thumb|The Ancient Theatre of [[Delphi]].]]\n===Theatron===\nThe theatron was the seating area, built into a hill to create a natural viewing space. The first seats in Greek theatres (other than just sitting on the ground) were wooden, but around 499 BC the practice of inlaying stone blocks into the side of the hill to create permanent, stable seating became more common. They were called the \"prohedria\" and reserved for priests and a few most respected citizens.\n\n===Sken\u00e9===\nAfter 465 BC, playwrights began using a backdrop or scenic wall, called the ''[[Skene (theatre)|sk\u00ean\u00ea]]'' (from which the word \"[[Scene (drama)|scene]]\" derives), that hung or stood behind the orchestra, and which also served as an area where actors could change their costumes. After 425 BC a stone scene wall, called a paraskenia, became a common supplement to ''sk\u00ean\u00ea''. The paraskenia was a long wall with projecting sides, which may have had doorways for entrances and exits. Just behind the paraskenia was the proskenion (\"in front of the scene\"), which is similar to the modern day [[proscenium]]. The upper story was called the episkenion. Some theatres also had a raised speaking place on the orchestra called the logeion. By the end of the 5th century BC, around the time of the Peloponnesian War, the ''sk\u00ean\u00ea'' was two stories high.\n\nThe death of a character was always heard behind the ''sk\u00ean\u00ea'', for it was considered inappropriate to show a killing in view of the audience.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Conversely, there are scholarly arguments that death in Greek tragedy was portrayed off stage primarily because of dramatic considerations, and not prudishness or sensitivity of the audience.<ref>{{harvp|Pathmanathan|1965}}</ref>\n\nA temple nearby, especially on the right side of the scene, is almost always part of the Greek theater complex. This could justify, as a transposition, the recurrence of the [[pediment]] with the later solidified stone scene.<ref>{{cite book | last = Brni\u0107 | first = Ivica | title = Nahe Ferne: Sakrale Aspekte im Prisma der Profanbauten von Tadao Ando, Louis I.

Originally unraised, Greek theatre would later incorporate a raised stage for easier viewing. This practice would become common after the advent of \"New Comedy,\" which incorporated dramatic portrayal of individual character. The ''[[coryphaeus]]'' was the head chorus member who could enter the story as a character able to interact with the characters of a play. Plays often began in the morning and lasted into the evening.\n\n===Acoustics===\nThe theaters were built on a large scale to accommodate a large number of people on stage and in the audience\u2014up to fourteen thousand{{which|date=July 2019}}. Physics and mathematics played a significant role in the construction of these theaters, as their designers had to be able to create [[acoustics]] in them such that the actors' voices could be heard throughout the theatre, including the very top row of seats. The Greek's understanding of acoustics compares very favorably with the current state of the art{{dubious|date=June 2019}}.\n\n===Scenic elements===\nThere were several scenic elements commonly used in Greek theater:\n\n* ''[[mechane]]'', a [[Crane (machine)|crane]] that gave the impression of a flying actor (thus, ''[[deus ex machina]]'')\n* ''[[Ekkyklema|ekkykl\u00eama]]'', a wheeled platform often used to bring dead characters into view for the audience\n* ''[[Pinax|pinakes]]'', pictures hung to create scenery\n* ''thyromata'', more complex pictures built into the second-level scene (3rd level from ground)\n* [[phallic]] props were used for [[satyr plays]], symbolizing [[fertility]] in honor of [[Dionysus]].\n\n==Masks==\n\n===Masks===\n[[File:Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|Tragic Comic Masks [[Hadrian's Villa]] mosaic]]\n\nThe Ancient Greek term for a [[mask]] is ''prosopon'' (lit., \"face\"),<ref>[http://perseus.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.62:2:190.LSJ Liddell & Scott via Perseus @ UChicago]</ref> and was a significant element in the worship of [[Dionysus]] at [[Athens]], likely used in ceremonial rites and celebrations. Most of the evidence comes from only a few vase paintings of the 5th century BC, such as one showing a mask of the god suspended from a tree with decorated robe hanging below it and dancing and the ''Pronomos'' vase,<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/image?img=1993.01.0669 Tufts.edu]</ref> which depicts actors preparing for a [[Satyr play]].<ref name=\"Vervain 2004. p.255\">{{harvp|Vervain|Wiles|2004|p=255}}</ref> No physical evidence remains available to us, as the masks were made of organic materials and not considered permanent objects, ultimately being dedicated at the altar of Dionysus after performances. Nevertheless, the mask is known to have been used since the time of [[Aeschylus]] and considered to be one of the iconic conventions of classical Greek theatre.<ref>{{harvp|Varakis|2004}}</ref>\n\nMasks were also made for members of the chorus, who play some part in the action and provide a commentary on the events in which they are caught up. Although there are twelve or fifteen members of the tragic chorus they all wear the same mask because they are considered to be representing one character. turkey :>\n\n===Mask details ===\n[[File:3304 - Athens - Sto\u00e0 of Attalus Museum - Theatre mask - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 9 2009.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mask dating from the 4th/3rd century BC, [[Stoa of Attalos]]]]\n\nIllustrations of theatrical masks from 5th century display helmet-like masks, covering the entire face and head, with holes for the eyes and a small aperture for the mouth, as well as an integrated wig. These paintings never show actual masks on the actors in performance; they are most often shown being handled by the actors before or after a performance, that liminal space between the audience and the stage, between myth and reality.<ref name=\"Vervain vjdivimcl\nway in which the mask was to 'melt' into the face and allow the actor to vanish into the role.<ref>{{harvp|Vervain|Wiles|2004|p=256}}</ref> Effectively, the mask transformed the actor as much as memorization of the text. Therefore, performance in ancient Greece did not distinguish the masked actor from the theatrical character.\n\nThe mask-makers were called ''skeuopoios'' or \"maker of the properties,\" thus suggesting that their role encompassed multiple duties and tasks. The masks were most likely made out of light weight, organic materials like stiffened linen, leather, wood, or cork, with the wig consisting of human or animal hair.<ref>{{harvp|Brooke|1962|p=76}}</ref> Due to the visual restrictions imposed by these masks, it was imperative that the actors hear in order to orient and balance themselves. Thus, it is believed that the ears were covered by substantial amounts of hair and not the helmet-mask itself. The mouth opening was relatively small, preventing the mouth being seen during performances. Vervain and Wiles posit that this small size discourages the idea that the mask functioned as a megaphone, as originally presented in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Vervain 2004. p.255\"/> Greek mask-maker, Thanos Vovolis, suggests that the mask serves as a resonator for the head, thus enhancing vocal acoustics and altering its quality. This leads to increased energy and presence, allowing for the more complete metamorphosis of the actor into his character.<ref name=\"Vovolis\">{{harvp|Vovolis|Zamboulakis|2007}}</ref>\n\n===Mask functions===\n[[File:Theatre mask mosaic MAN Napoli Inv9994.jpg|thumb|left|Mosaic detail from the [[House of the Faun]]]]\nIn a large open-air theatre, like the [[Theatre of Dionysus]] in [[Athens]], the classical masks were able to create a sense of dread in the audience creating large scale panic, especially since they had intensely exaggerated facial features and expressions.<ref name=\"Vovolis\"/> They enabled an actor to appear and reappear in several different roles, thus preventing the audience from identifying the actor to one specific character. Their variations help the audience to distinguish sex, age, and social status, in addition to revealing a change in a particular character's appearance, e.g. Oedipus after blinding himself.<ref>{{harvp|Brockett|Ball|2000|p=70}}</ref> Unique masks were also created for specific characters and events in a play, such as [[The Furies]] in [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia|Eumenides]]'' and [[Pentheus]] and [[Cadmus]] in [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Bacchae]]''. Worn by the chorus, the masks created a sense of unity and uniformity, while representing a multi-voiced persona or single organism and simultaneously encouraged interdependency and a heightened sensitivity between each individual of the group. Only 2-3 actors were allowed on the stage at one time, and masks permitted quick transitions from one character to another. There were only male actors, but masks allowed them to play female characters.\n\n===Other costume details===\n[[File:Comedy and tragedy masks.svg|thumb|Comedy and tragedy masks]]\n{{see also|Sock and buskin}}\nThe actors in these plays that had tragic roles wore boots called ''cothurni'' that elevated them above the other actors. The actors with comedic roles only wore a thin soled shoe called a [[sock]]. For this reason, dramatic art is sometimes alluded to as \"Sock and Buskin.\"\n\n[[Melpomene]] is the [[muse]] of tragedy and is often depicted holding the tragic mask and wearing cothurni. [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]] is the muse of comedy and is similarly associated with the mask of comedy and the comedic \"socks\".\n\nMale actors playing female roles would wear a wooden structure on their chests (posterneda) to imitate the look of breasts and another structure on their stomachs (progastreda) to make them appear softer and more lady like. They would also wear white body stockings under their costumes to make their skin appear fairer.\n\nMost costuming detail comes from pottery paintings from that time as costumes and masks were fabricated out of disposable material, so there are little to no remains of any costume from that time. The biggest source of information is the Pronomos Vase where actors are painted at a show's after party.\n\nCostuming would give off a sense of character, as in gender, age, social status, and class. For example, characters of higher class would be dressed in nicer clothing, although everyone was dressed fairly nicely. Contrary to popular belief, they did not dress in only rags and sandals, as they wanted to impress. Some examples of Greek theatre costuming include long robes called the chiton that reached the floor for actors playing gods, heroes, and old men. Actors playing Goddesses and women characters that held a lot of power wore purples and golds. Actors playing Queens and Princesses wore long cloaks that dragged on the ground and were decorated with gold stars and other jewels, and warriors were dressed in a variety of armor and wore helmets adorned with plumes. Costumes were supposed to be colourful and obvious to be easily seen by every seat in the audience.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[List of ancient Greek playwrights]]\n* [[List of ancient Greek theatres]]\n* [[History of theatre]]\n* [[Representation of women in Athenian tragedy]]\n* ''[[Agon|Ag\u00f4n]]''\n* [[Ancient Greek comedy]]\n* [[Archon]]\n* [[Aulos]]\n* [[Buskin]]\n* [[Choregos|Chor\u00eagos]]\n* [[Greek chorus|Chorus]]\n* [[Chorus of the elderly in classical Greek drama]]\n* [[Comedy (drama)|Comedy]]\n* [[Coryphaeus]]\n* ''[[Deus ex machina]]''\n* [[Deuteragonist]]\n* [[Didascaliae]]\n* [[Theatre director|Didaskalos]]\n* [[Dionysia|Dionysia festivals]]\n* [[Dithyramb]]\n* ''[[Eisodos]]''\n* ''[[Ekkyklema|Ekkykl\u00eama]]''\n* [[Episode]]\n* [[Epode]]\n* ''[[Kommos (theatre)|Komm\u00f3s]]''\n* ''[[Mechane|M\u00eachan\u00ea]]''\n* [[Melpomene]]\n* [[Monody]]\n* [[Ode]]\n* [[Onomasti komodein|Onomast\u00ec komod\u00e8in]]\n* [[Orchestra|Orch\u00eastra]]\n* ''[[Parabasis]]''\n* ''[[Parodos|P\u00e1rodos]]''\n* [[Phlyax play]]\n* [[Protagonist]]\n* [[Rhapsode]]\n* [[Satyr play]]\n* ''[[Skene (theatre)|Sk\u00ean\u00ea]]''\n* ''[[Sparagmos]]''\n* ''[[Stasimon|St\u00e1simon]]\n* [[Stichomythia]]\n* [[Strophe|Stroph\u00ea]]\n* [[Thalia (Muse)]]\n* [[Theatre of ancient Rome]]\n* [[Theatre of Dionysus]]\n* [[Theorica|Theoric fund]]\n* [[Thespis]]\n* [[Tragedy]]\n* [[Tritagonist]]\n* [[List of films based on Greek drama]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|21em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Brockett |first=Oscar G. |year=1999 |title=History of the Theatre |publisher=Allyn and Bacon |edition=8th |isbn=9780205290260 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Brockett |first1=Oscar G. |first2=Robert |last2=Ball |year=2000 |title=The Essential Theatre |edition=7th |publisher=Harcourt Brace |location=Orlando, FL |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Brooke |first=Iris |year=1962 |title=Costume in Greek Classical Drama |publisher=Methuen |location=London |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Jansen |first=Jan |year=2000 |title=Lebensqualit\u00e4t im Theater des demokratischen Athen: Kult, Politik und Alte Kom\u00f6die |language=de |trans-title=Quality of life in the theatre of Democratic Athens: cults, politics and ancient comedy |url=http://content.grin.com/data/7/27040.pdf |publisher=GRIN |location=Munich, Germany |isbn=9783638291873 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Kuritz |first=Paul |year=1988 |title=The Making of Theatre History |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |isbn=9780135478615 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal |last=Pathmanathan |first=R.

It is impossible, however, to know with certainty how these [[Fertility rite|fertility rituals]] became the basis for tragedy and [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]].<ref name=\"Redgeway\">{{harvp|Ridgeway|1910|p=83}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n{{Main|Greek tragedy}}\n\n[[File:2007-05-10 Epidauros, Greece 5.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Panoramic view of [[Ancient Theatre of Epidaurus|the ancient theatre]] at [[Epidaurus]].]]\n\nThe classical Greeks valued the power of spoken word, and it was their main method of communication and storytelling. Bahn and Bahn write, \"To Greeks the spoken word was a living thing and infinitely preferable to the dead symbols of a written language.\" [[Socrates]] himself believed that once something has been written down, it lost its ability for change and growth. For these reasons, among many others, oral storytelling flourished in Greece.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Oral Interpretation|last1=Bahn|first1=Eugene|last2=Bahn|first2=Margaret L.|lastauthoramp=yes|publisher=Burgess Publishing Company|year=1970|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nGreek tragedy as we know it was created in Athens around the time of 532 BC, when [[Thespis]] was the earliest recorded actor. Being a winner of the first theatrical contest held in Athens, he was the ''exarchon'', or leader,<ref>Aristotle, '[[Poetics]]'</ref> of the [[dithyramb]]s performed in and around Attica, especially at the rural [[Dionysia]]. By Thespis' time, the dithyramb had evolved far away from its cult roots. Under the influence of heroic epic, Doric choral lyric and the innovations of the poet Arion, it had become a narrative, ballad-like genre. Because of these, Thespis is often called the \"Father of Tragedy\"; however, his importance is disputed, and Thespis is sometimes listed as late as 16th in the chronological order of Greek tragedians; the statesman [[Solon]], for example, is credited with creating poems in which characters speak with their own voice, and spoken performances of [[Homer]]'s epics by [[rhapsode]]s were popular in festivals prior to 534 BC.<ref name=\"Brockett\">{{harvp|Brockett|1999|pp=16\u201317}}</ref> Thus, Thespis's true contribution to drama is unclear at best, but his name has been given a longer life, in English, as a common term for performer \u2014 i.e., a \"thespian.\"\n\nThe dramatic performances were important to the Athenians \u2013 this is made clear by the creation of a tragedy competition and festival in the City Dionysia. This was organized possibly to foster loyalty among the tribes of Attica (recently created by [[Cleisthenes]]). The festival was created roughly around 508 BC. While no drama texts exist from the sixth century BC, we do know the names of three competitors besides Thespis: Choerilus, Pratinas, and [[Phrynichus (tragic poet)|Phrynichus]]. Each is credited with different innovations in the field.\n\nSome is known about Phrynichus. He won his first competition between 511 BC and 508 BC. He produced tragedies on themes and subjects later exploited in the golden age such as the ''Danaids'', ''Phoenician Women'' and ''Alcestis''. He was the first poet we know of to use a historical subject \u2013 his ''Fall of Miletus'', produced in 493-2, chronicled the fate of the town of Miletus after it was conquered by the Persians. Herodotus reports that \"the Athenians made clear their deep grief for the taking of Miletus in many ways, but especially in this: when Phrynichus wrote a play entitled \"The Fall of Miletus\" and produced it, the whole theatre fell to weeping; they fined Phrynichus a thousand drachmas for bringing to mind a calamity that affected them so personally and forbade the performance of that play forever.\"<ref>[http://perseus.uchicago.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0126:book=6:chapter=21 Herodotus, ''Histories'', 6/21]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He is also thought to be the first to use female characters (though not female performers).<ref>{{harvp|Brockett|1999|p=17}}</ref>\n\nUntil the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic period]], all tragedies were unique pieces written in honour of Dionysus and played only once, so that today we primarily have the pieces that were still remembered well enough to have been repeated when the repetition of old tragedies became fashionable (the accidents of survival, as well as the subjective tastes of the Hellenistic librarians later in Greek history, also played a role in what survived from this period).\n\n==New inventions during the classical period==\n[[File:Theater of Dionysius, Athens, Greece. (2826099154).jpg|thumbnail|left|Theater of Dionysus, Athens, Greece. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]\nAfter the Great Destruction of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] in 480 BCE, the town of Agios Prokopios and acropolis were rebuilt, and theatre became formalized and an even greater part of Athenian culture and civil pride. This century is normally regarded as the [[Age of Pericles|Golden Age]] of Greek drama. The centre-piece of the annual Dionysia, which took place once in winter and once in spring, was a competition between three tragic playwrights at the [[Theatre of Dionysus]]. Each submitted three tragedies, plus a satyr play (a comic, [[burlesque]] version of a mythological subject). Beginning in a first competition in 486 BC each playwright submitted a comedy.<ref>{{harvp|Kuritz|1988|p=21}}</ref> [[Aristotle]] claimed that [[Aeschylus]] added the second actor ([[deuteragonist]]), and that [[Sophocles]] introduced the third ([[tritagonist]]). Apparently the Greek playwrights never used more than three actors based on what is known about Greek theatre.<ref>{{harvp|Kuritz|1988|p=24}}</ref>\n\n[[Greek Tragedy|Tragedy]] and [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]] were viewed as completely separate genres, and no plays ever merged aspects of the two. [[Satyr play]]s dealt with the mythological subject matter of the tragedies, but in a purely comedic manner.\n\n==Hellenistic period==\n\n[[File:Relief with Menander and New Comedy Masks - Princeton Art Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Roman, [[Roman Republic|Republican]] or [[Roman Empire|Early Imperial]], ''Relief of a seated poet ([[Menander]]) with masks of New Comedy'', 1st century B.C. \u2013 early 1st century A.D., [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]\n\nThe power of Athens declined following its defeat in the [[Peloponnesian War]] against the Spartans. From that time on, the theatre started performing old tragedies again. Although its theatrical traditions seem to have lost their vitality, Greek theatre continued into the [[Hellenistic]] period (the period following [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquests in the fourth century BCE). However, the primary Hellenistic theatrical form was not tragedy but '[[Greek comedy#New Comedy|New Comedy]]', comic episodes about the lives of ordinary citizens. The only extant playwright from the period is [[Menander]]. One of New Comedy's most important contributions was its influence on Roman comedy, an influence that can be seen in the surviving works of [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]].\n\n==Architecture==\n{{see also|Roman theatre (structure)}}\n[[File:GriechTheater2.PNG|thumb|right|Labelled drawing of an ancient theatre.

In cities without suitable hills, banks of earth were piled up.<ref name=Lawrence>{{cite book |last1=Lawrence |first1=A. W. |last2=Tomlinson |first2=R.

There were often tall, arched entrances called [[parodos|parodoi]] or [[eisodos|eisodoi]], through which actors and chorus members entered and exited the orchestra. In some theatres, behind the orchestra was a backdrop or scenic wall known as the ''sken\u00e9''. The term \"theatre\" eventually came to mean to the whole area of theatron, orchestra, and sken\u00e9.\n\n[[File:Delphi Composite.jpg|thumb|The Ancient Theatre of [[Delphi]].]]\n===Theatron===\nThe theatron was the seating area, built into a hill to create a natural viewing space. The first seats in Greek theatres (other than just sitting on the ground) were wooden, but around 499 BC the practice of inlaying stone blocks into the side of the hill to create permanent, stable seating became more common. They were called the \"prohedria\" and reserved for priests and a few most respected citizens.\n\n===Sken\u00e9===\nAfter 465 BC, playwrights began using a backdrop or scenic wall, called the ''[[Skene (theatre)|sk\u00ean\u00ea]]'' (from which the word \"[[Scene (drama)|scene]]\" derives), that hung or stood behind the orchestra, and which also served as an area where actors could change their costumes. After 425 BC a stone scene wall, called a paraskenia, became a common supplement to ''sk\u00ean\u00ea''. The paraskenia was a long wall with projecting sides, which may have had doorways for entrances and exits. Just behind the paraskenia was the proskenion (\"in front of the scene\"), which is similar to the modern day [[proscenium]]. The upper story was called the episkenion. Some theatres also had a raised speaking place on the orchestra called the logeion. By the end of the 5th century BC, around the time of the Peloponnesian War, the ''sk\u00ean\u00ea'' was two stories high.\n\nThe death of a character was always heard behind the ''sk\u00ean\u00ea'', for it was considered inappropriate to show a killing in view of the audience.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Conversely, there are scholarly arguments that death in Greek tragedy was portrayed off stage primarily because of dramatic considerations, and not prudishness or sensitivity of the audience.<ref>{{harvp|Pathmanathan|1965}}</ref>\n\nA temple nearby, especially on the right side of the scene, is almost always part of the Greek theater complex. This could justify, as a transposition, the recurrence of the [[pediment]] with the later solidified stone scene.<ref>{{cite book | last = Brni\u0107 | first = Ivica | title = Nahe Ferne: Sakrale Aspekte im Prisma der Profanbauten von Tadao Ando, Louis I.

Originally unraised, Greek theatre would later incorporate a raised stage for easier viewing. This practice would become common after the advent of \"New Comedy,\" which incorporated dramatic portrayal of individual character. The ''[[coryphaeus]]'' was the head chorus member who could enter the story as a character able to interact with the characters of a play. Plays often began in the morning and lasted into the evening.\n\n===Acoustics===\nThe theaters were built on a large scale to accommodate a large number of people on stage and in the audience\u2014up to fourteen thousand{{which|date=July 2019}}. Physics and mathematics played a significant role in the construction of these theaters, as their designers had to be able to create [[acoustics]] in them such that the actors' voices could be heard throughout the theatre, including the very top row of seats. The Greek's understanding of acoustics compares very favorably with the current state of the art{{dubious|date=June 2019}}.\n\n===Scenic elements===\nThere were several scenic elements commonly used in Greek theater:\n\n* ''[[mechane]]'', a [[Crane (machine)|crane]] that gave the impression of a flying actor (thus, ''[[deus ex machina]]'')\n* ''[[Ekkyklema|ekkykl\u00eama]]'', a wheeled platform often used to bring dead characters into view for the audience\n* ''[[Pinax|pinakes]]'', pictures hung to create scenery\n* ''thyromata'', more complex pictures built into the second-level scene (3rd level from ground)\n* [[phallic]] props were used for [[satyr plays]], symbolizing [[fertility]] in honor of [[Dionysus]].\n\n==Masks==\n\n===Masks===\n[[File:Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|Tragic Comic Masks [[Hadrian's Villa]] mosaic]]\n\nThe Ancient Greek term for a [[mask]] is ''prosopon'' (lit., \"face\"),<ref>[http://perseus.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.62:2:190.LSJ Liddell & Scott via Perseus @ UChicago]</ref> and was a significant element in the worship of [[Dionysus]] at [[Athens]], likely used in ceremonial rites and celebrations. Most of the evidence comes from only a few vase paintings of the 5th century BC, such as one showing a mask of the god suspended from a tree with decorated robe hanging below it and dancing and the ''Pronomos'' vase,<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/image?img=1993.01.0669 Tufts.edu]</ref> which depicts actors preparing for a [[Satyr play]].<ref name=\"Vervain 2004. p.255\">{{harvp|Vervain|Wiles|2004|p=255}}</ref> No physical evidence remains available to us, as the masks were made of organic materials and not considered permanent objects, ultimately being dedicated at the altar of Dionysus after performances. Nevertheless, the mask is known to have been used since the time of [[Aeschylus]] and considered to be one of the iconic conventions of classical Greek theatre.<ref>{{harvp|Varakis|2004}}</ref>\n\nMasks were also made for members of the chorus, who play some part in the action and provide a commentary on the events in which they are caught up. Although there are twelve or fifteen members of the tragic chorus they all wear the same mask because they are considered to be representing one character.\n\n===Mask details ===\n[[File:3304 - Athens - Sto\u00e0 of Attalus Museum - Theatre mask - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 9 2009.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mask dating from the 4th/3rd century BC, [[Stoa of Attalos]]]]\n\nIllustrations of theatrical masks from 5th century display helmet-like masks, covering the entire face and head, with holes for the eyes and a small aperture for the mouth, as well as an integrated wig. These paintings never show actual masks on the actors in performance; they are most often shown being handled by the actors before or after a performance, that liminal space between the audience and the stage, between myth and reality.<ref name=\"Vervain vjdivimcl\nway in which the mask was to 'melt' into the face and allow the actor to vanish into the role.<ref>{{harvp|Vervain|Wiles|2004|p=256}}</ref> Effectively, the mask transformed the actor as much as memorization of the text. Therefore, performance in ancient Greece did not distinguish the masked actor from the theatrical character.\n\nThe mask-makers were called ''skeuopoios'' or \"maker of the properties,\" thus suggesting that their role encompassed multiple duties and tasks. The masks were most likely made out of light weight, organic materials like stiffened linen, leather, wood, or cork, with the wig consisting of human or animal hair.<ref>{{harvp|Brooke|1962|p=76}}</ref> Due to the visual restrictions imposed by these masks, it was imperative that the actors hear in order to orient and balance themselves. Thus, it is believed that the ears were covered by substantial amounts of hair and not the helmet-mask itself. The mouth opening was relatively small, preventing the mouth being seen during performances. Vervain and Wiles posit that this small size discourages the idea that the mask functioned as a megaphone, as originally presented in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Vervain 2004. p.255\"/> Greek mask-maker, Thanos Vovolis, suggests that the mask serves as a resonator for the head, thus enhancing vocal acoustics and altering its quality. This leads to increased energy and presence, allowing for the more complete metamorphosis of the actor into his character.<ref name=\"Vovolis\">{{harvp|Vovolis|Zamboulakis|2007}}</ref>\n\n===Mask functions===\n[[File:Theatre mask mosaic MAN Napoli Inv9994.jpg|thumb|left|Mosaic detail from the [[House of the Faun]]]]\nIn a large open-air theatre, like the [[Theatre of Dionysus]] in [[Athens]], the classical masks were able to create a sense of dread in the audience creating large scale panic, especially since they had intensely exaggerated facial features and expressions.<ref name=\"Vovolis\"/> They enabled an actor to appear and reappear in several different roles, thus preventing the audience from identifying the actor to one specific character. Their variations help the audience to distinguish sex, age, and social status, in addition to revealing a change in a particular character's appearance, e.g. Oedipus after blinding himself.<ref>{{harvp|Brockett|Ball|2000|p=70}}</ref> Unique masks were also created for specific characters and events in a play, such as [[The Furies]] in [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia|Eumenides]]'' and [[Pentheus]] and [[Cadmus]] in [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Bacchae]]''. Worn by the chorus, the masks created a sense of unity and uniformity, while representing a multi-voiced persona or single organism and simultaneously encouraged interdependency and a heightened sensitivity between each individual of the group. Only 2-3 actors were allowed on the stage at one time, and masks permitted quick transitions from one character to another. There were only male actors, but masks allowed them to play female characters.\n\n===Other costume details===\n[[File:Comedy and tragedy masks.svg|thumb|Comedy and tragedy masks]]\n{{see also|Sock and buskin}}\nThe actors in these plays that had tragic roles wore boots called ''cothurni'' that elevated them above the other actors. The actors with comedic roles only wore a thin soled shoe called a [[sock]]. For this reason, dramatic art is sometimes alluded to as \"Sock and Buskin.\"\n\n[[Melpomene]] is the [[muse]] of tragedy and is often depicted holding the tragic mask and wearing cothurni. [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]] is the muse of comedy and is similarly associated with the mask of comedy and the comedic \"socks\".\n\nMale actors playing female roles would wear a wooden structure on their chests (posterneda) to imitate the look of breasts and another structure on their stomachs (progastreda) to make them appear softer and more lady like. They would also wear white body stockings under their costumes to make their skin appear fairer.\n\nMost costuming detail comes from pottery paintings from that time as costumes and masks were fabricated out of disposable material, so there are little to no remains of any costume from that time. The biggest source of information is the Pronomos Vase where actors are painted at a show's after party.\n\nCostuming would give off a sense of character, as in gender, age, social status, and class. For example, characters of higher class would be dressed in nicer clothing, although everyone was dressed fairly nicely. Contrary to popular belief, they did not dress in only rags and sandals, as they wanted to impress. Some examples of Greek theatre costuming include long robes called the chiton that reached the floor for actors playing gods, heroes, and old men. Actors playing Goddesses and women characters that held a lot of power wore purples and golds. Actors playing Queens and Princesses wore long cloaks that dragged on the ground and were decorated with gold stars and other jewels, and warriors were dressed in a variety of armor and wore helmets adorned with plumes. Costumes were supposed to be colourful and obvious to be easily seen by every seat in the audience.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[List of ancient Greek playwrights]]\n* [[List of ancient Greek theatres]]\n* [[History of theatre]]\n* [[Representation of women in Athenian tragedy]]\n* ''[[Agon|Ag\u00f4n]]''\n* [[Ancient Greek comedy]]\n* [[Archon]]\n* [[Aulos]]\n* [[Buskin]]\n* [[Choregos|Chor\u00eagos]]\n* [[Greek chorus|Chorus]]\n* [[Chorus of the elderly in classical Greek drama]]\n* [[Comedy (drama)|Comedy]]\n* [[Coryphaeus]]\n* ''[[Deus ex machina]]''\n* [[Deuteragonist]]\n* [[Didascaliae]]\n* [[Theatre director|Didaskalos]]\n* [[Dionysia|Dionysia festivals]]\n* [[Dithyramb]]\n* ''[[Eisodos]]''\n* ''[[Ekkyklema|Ekkykl\u00eama]]''\n* [[Episode]]\n* [[Epode]]\n* ''[[Kommos (theatre)|Komm\u00f3s]]''\n* ''[[Mechane|M\u00eachan\u00ea]]''\n* [[Melpomene]]\n* [[Monody]]\n* [[Ode]]\n* [[Onomasti komodein|Onomast\u00ec komod\u00e8in]]\n* [[Orchestra|Orch\u00eastra]]\n* ''[[Parabasis]]''\n* ''[[Parodos|P\u00e1rodos]]''\n* [[Phlyax play]]\n* [[Protagonist]]\n* [[Rhapsode]]\n* [[Satyr play]]\n* ''[[Skene (theatre)|Sk\u00ean\u00ea]]''\n* ''[[Sparagmos]]''\n* ''[[Stasimon|St\u00e1simon]]\n* [[Stichomythia]]\n* [[Strophe|Stroph\u00ea]]\n* [[Thalia (Muse)]]\n* [[Theatre of ancient Rome]]\n* [[Theatre of Dionysus]]\n* [[Theorica|Theoric fund]]\n* [[Thespis]]\n* [[Tragedy]]\n* [[Tritagonist]]\n* [[List of films based on Greek drama]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|21em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Brockett |first=Oscar G. |year=1999 |title=History of the Theatre |publisher=Allyn and Bacon |edition=8th |isbn=9780205290260 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Brockett |first1=Oscar G. |first2=Robert |last2=Ball |year=2000 |title=The Essential Theatre |edition=7th |publisher=Harcourt Brace |location=Orlando, FL |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Brooke |first=Iris |year=1962 |title=Costume in Greek Classical Drama |publisher=Methuen |location=London |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Jansen |first=Jan |year=2000 |title=Lebensqualit\u00e4t im Theater des demokratischen Athen: Kult, Politik und Alte Kom\u00f6die |language=de |trans-title=Quality of life in the theatre of Democratic Athens: cults, politics and ancient comedy |url=http://content.grin.com/data/7/27040.pdf |publisher=GRIN |location=Munich, Germany |isbn=9783638291873 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Kuritz |first=Paul |year=1988 |title=The Making of Theatre History |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |isbn=9780135478615 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal |last=Pathmanathan |first=R.

Saint John Harbour, where the two rivers meet the Bay of Fundy, is a deep water port and ice-free all year long. Partridge Island is in the harbour.\n\nStonehammer [[UNESCO]] Geopark, the first Geopark in North America, is centred around Saint John. The Geopark has been recognized by UNESCO as having exceptional geological significance. The park contains rock formations throughout the Saint John region ranging billions of years.\n\n[[File:St Martins NB covered bridge.jpg|thumb|Covered bridges dot the Greater Saint John region.]]\n\nThe Saint John River itself flows into the [[Bay of Fundy]] through a narrow gorge several hundred feet wide at the centre of the city. It contains a unique phenomenon called the [[Reversing Falls]] where the diurnal tides of the bay reverse the water flow of the river for several kilometres. A series of underwater ledges at the narrowest point of this gorge also create a series of rapids.\n\nThe topography surrounding Saint John is hilly; a result of the influence of two coastal mountain ranges which run along the Bay of Fundy&nbsp;\u2013 the ''St. Croix Highlands'' and the ''Caledonia Highlands''. The soil throughout the region is extremely rocky with frequent granite outcrops. The coastal plain hosts numerous freshwater lakes in the eastern, western and northern parts of the city.\n\nIn Saint John the height difference from low to high [[tide]] is approximately 8 metres (28&nbsp;ft) due to the funnelling effect of the Bay of Fundy as it narrows. The Reversing Falls in Saint John, actually an area of strong rapids, provides one example of the power of these tides; at every high tide, ocean water is pushed through a narrow gorge in the middle of the city and forces the Saint John River to reverse its flow for several hours.\n\n===Neighbourhoods===\n[[File:SaintJohn1894.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Saint John from 1894, including the lower west (then Carleton), and uptown]]\nSaint John is a city of neighbourhoods, with residents closely identifying with their particular area.\n\n[[File:King Edward VII Memorial Bandstand.JPG|thumb|left|King Edward VII Memorial Bandstand]]\n\n====South (End) Central Peninsula\u2014Uptown====\nThe central peninsula on the east side of [[Saint John Harbour]] and the area immediately opposite on the west side are the sites of the original city, which resulted from the merger of Parrtown and Carleton. The western side of the central peninsula subsequently saw increased development and includes the central business district (CBD) and the [[Trinity Royal Heritage Conservation Area]], which together are referred to as \"Uptown\" by residents throughout the city. The term \"Uptown\" came about as people at the slips would go up the hill to the city. In addition, most of the central peninsula is situated on a hill. This central area of Saint John is only rarely called \"Downtown.\" The south end of the central peninsula, south of Duke Street, is appropriately called the South End.\n\n====North End (Portland/Millidgeville)====\nMuch of the North End is made up of the former city of Portland, a predominantly working class area north of the harbour along the Saint John River. Vessels navigating the Saint John River can only transit the Reversing Falls gorge at [[slack tide]], thus Portland became a location during the 19th and 20th centuries where tugboats and paddle wheelers could dock to wait. Being at the beginning of the navigable part of the Saint John River, Portland also became a major terminal for vessels departing to ply their trade upriver.\n\nFurther north of the central part of the city, and northeast of Portland, along the southern bank of the Kennebecasis River is the area of Millidgeville which is generally considered a neighbourhood separate from Portland. The boundary of Millidgeville is typically thought to begin at the \"Y\" intersection of Somerset Street and Millidge Ave or right after Tartan St. It is a middle to upper-class neighbourhood.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Located here is [[University of New Brunswick]], as well as New Brunswick's largest health care centre, the [[Saint John Regional Hospital]], and Saint John's only completely French school and community centre, [[\u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain|Centre Scolaire Communautaire Samuel-de-Champlain]].\n\nThe eastern area of the North End plays host to the city's largest park, and one of Canada's largest urban parks. [[Rockwood Park, Saint John|Rockwood Park]] encompasses {{convert|890|ha|abbr=on}} of upland Acadian mixed forest, many hills and several caves, as well as several freshwater lakes, with an extensive trail network, a golf course, and the [[Cherry Brook Zoo]]. The park was designed by [[Calvert Vaux]] in the mid-to-late 19th century. Mount Pleasant borders the park, and is generally seen as distinct from the traditionally poorer North End.\n\n===={{anchor|East Side}} East Side (Simonds/Loch Lomond)====\n\n[[File:Church, St. Johns.jpg|thumb|Our Lady of the Assumption Catholic Church in Saint John]]\n\nTo the east of the [[Courtney Bay]] / Forebay and south of [[New Brunswick Route 1]] is the East Side, where the city has experienced its greatest suburban sprawl in recent decades with commercial retail centres and residential subdivisions. There has been significant and consistent commercial and retail development in the Westmorland Road-McAllister Drive-Consumer's Drive-Major's Brook Drive-Retail Drive corridor since the 1970s, including McAllister Place, the city's largest shopping mall, which opened in 1978, and with active year-to-year development since 1994. The city's airport is further east on the coastal plain among several lakes at the far eastern edge of the municipality. Far east side is Loch Lomond, including several urban neighbourhoods found here, including Forest Hills, Champlain Heights, and Lakewood Heights. The malls were built by filling in Major's Brook (a tributary to Marsh Creek), making the area prone to flooding.\n\n====West Side (Carleton/Lancaster/Fairville)====\nThe portion of the city west of the Saint John River is collectively referred to as West Side, although West Saint Johners divide this area into several neighbourhoods. As mentioned previously, the Lower West Side is the former working-class neighbourhood known as Carleton at the time of the city's formation in 1785. West and north of the Lower West Side is the former city of Lancaster (commonly referred to as Saint John West), which was amalgamated into Saint John in 1967. The boundary was City Line Street, with the streets east considered to be the \"West Side\", and the streets west of City Kine Street having been renamed from Lancaster, NB to Saint John West, NB.\n\nThe southern part of Lancaster abutting [[Saint John Harbour]] and the Bay of Fundy is Bayshore and the location of [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s Bayshore Yard. The north end of Lancaster, known as Fairville, is home to [[Moosehead Brewery]] and older neighbourhoods clustered along Manawagonish Road. North of Fairville are the communities of [[Milford, New Brunswick|Milford]] and [[Randolph, New Brunswick|Randolph]]. Randolph, which is home to Dominion Park Beach, includes land on the city's largest island, and is joined by the Canal Bridge over Mosquito Cove on Greenhead Road. The area also contains the Irving Pulp and Paper mill, a highly visible manufacturing plant that sits next to the [[Reversing Falls]] and is owned and operated by [[J. D. Irving|J. D. Irving, Ltd.]]\n\nWest of Lancaster, the city hosts its second largest park, and one of the largest coastal urban parks in the country. The [[Irving Nature Park]], along Saints' Rest Beach, sits on an extensive peninsula called [[Taylor's Island, New Brunswick|Taylor's Island]] extending into the western part of the harbour into the Bay of Fundy. The park is partially open to vehicles in summer and features ocean views and walking trails through mixed forests.\n\n====Suburbs====\n\nSaint John's suburbs, just on the edge of the city limit, are [[Rothesay, New Brunswick|Rothesay]], [[Quispamsis]], and [[Grand Bay\u2013Westfield]]. Mainly residential, the suburbs have attracted many of Saint John's residents, leading the city's population to shrink.\n\n===Climate===\n{{climate chart\n| Saint John\n| \u221213.6 | \u22122.7 | 139\n| \u221212.7 | \u22121.9 |  94\n|  \u22127.3 |  2.3 | 118\n|  \u22121.2 |  8.3 | 104\n|   4.0 | 14.8 | 118\n|   8.4 | 19.5 | 101\n|  11.7 | 22.4 | 102\n|  11.6 | 22.2 |  90\n|   7.7 | 17.7 | 117\n|   2.7 | 11.9 | 125\n|  \u22122.1 |  6.0 | 134\n|  \u22129.7 |  0.3 | 149\n| float  = right\n| clear  = none\n| source = Environment Canada<ref>{{cite web\n| publisher = [[Environment Canada]]\n| url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=6250&prov=&lang=e&dCode=1&dispBack=1&StationName=saint_john&SearchType=Contains&province=ALL&provBut=&month1=0&month2=12\n| title = Saint John A\n| work = Canadian Climate Normals 1971\u20132000\n| accessdate = September 30, 2013}}</ref>}}\nThe climate of Saint John is [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb/Dsb: Warm summer subtype|Dfb]]''). The Bay of Fundy never fully freezes, thus moderating the winter temperatures compared with inland locations. Even so, with the prevailing wind blowing from the west (from land to sea), the average January temperature is about {{convert|-8.2|C}}. Summers are usually warm to hot, and daytime temperatures often exceed {{convert|25|C}}. The highest temperature recorded in a given year is usually {{convert|30|or|31|C|0}}. The confluence of cold Bay of Fundy air and inland warmer temperatures often creates onshore winds that bring periods of fog and cooler temperatures during the summer months.\n\nPrecipitation in Saint John totals about {{convert|1295|mm|abbr=on}} annually and is well distributed throughout the year, although the late autumn and early winter are typically the wettest time of year. Snowfalls can often be heavy, but rain is as common as snow in winter, and it is not unusual for the ground to be snow-free even in mid-winter.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Saint John

The city was incorporated in the late 1700s after more than 3,300 Black Loyalist refugees came to Saint John along with more than 10,000 white refugees after the American Revolution. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-black-history-1.5048864 |title=Before Willie O'Ree: New Brunswick's surprising black history contributions|publisher=CBC |accessdate=10 November 2019}}</ref> In the years between 1815 and 1867, when immigration of that era passed its peak, more than 150,000 immigrants from Ireland came to Saint John dramatically changing the city. \n\nThose who came in the earlier period were largely tradesmen, and many stayed in Saint John, becoming the backbone of its builders. But when the Great Irish Potato Famine raged between 1845 and 1852, huge waves of famine refugees flooded the city's shores. It is estimated that between 1845 and 1847, some 30,000 arrived, more people than were living in the city at the time. In 1847, dubbed \"[[Great Famine (Ireland)|Black 47]]\", one of the worst years of the famine, some 16,000 immigrants, most of them from Ireland, arrived at [[Partridge Island (Saint John County)|Partridge Island]]\n, the immigration and quarantine station at the mouth of Saint John Harbour.<ref>Thomas P.

The largest visible minority groups were [[Black people|Black]] (2.1%), [[Chinese people|Chinese]] (1.4%), [[Arabs|Arab]] (0.9%), and [[South Asian People|South Asian]] (0.7%). 5% of Saint Johners are francophone.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=POPC&Code1=0734&Geo2=PR&Code2=13&SearchText=Saint+John&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Language&TABID=1&type=0 |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to religion, 89.2% identify as Christian (47.6% Protestant, 40.3% Roman Catholic, and 1.3% other Christian, mostly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and independent churches). 10.1% state no religious affiliation, and other religions including [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Hinduism]] together comprise less than 1%.\n\n==Municipal government (Common Council)==\n{{See also|List of mayors of Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\nSaint John is one of five chartered cities in Canada, giving it unique legislative powers.<ref name=\"policyschool\">{{cite web |title=Is \u2018Charter-City Status\u2019 a Solution for Financing City Services in Canada \u2014 Or is that a Myth? |url=https://www.policyschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/charter-city-status-kitchen_0.pdf |publisher=University of Calgary |accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Responsibility===\nSaint John is governed by a body of elected officials, referred to as \"Common Council\", whose responsibilities include:\n* Setting the city operational budget\n* Setting the City Water utility budget/ rates\n* Enacting and amending by-laws\n* Rezoning and land-use permissions of properties in Saint John.\n* Setting the capital budget for the city\n* Acting as the Board of Directors for the corporation \"City of Saint John\"\n* Appointing persons to city staff and commissions\n* Overseeing the operation of city commissions and departments\n\n===Composition===\n{{Main|Saint John City Council}}\nThe Common Council consists of:\n* The Mayor, who runs at-large, acts as Chairman of the Board.\n* Two at-large Common Councillors.\n* Two Common Councillors, from each of the city's four wards.\nOne is elected by the council to serve as Deputy Mayor.\n\nAs of 2017, the Council's members are:\n* Mayor: Don Darling\n* Deputy Mayor: [[Shirley McAlary]]\n* Councillor at Large: Gary Sullivan\n* Ward 1: Blake Armstrong, Greg Norton\n* Ward 2: John MacKenzie, Sean Casey\n* Ward 3: Donna Reardon, David Hickey\n* Ward 4: Ray Strowbridge, David Meritthew\n\nIn the [[2007 Saint John, New Brunswick Ward Plebiscite|October 9, 2007 Plebiscite]], it was decided that as of the May 2008 quadrennial municipal elections, the city will be divided into four wards of approximately equal population, with two councillors to be elected by the voters in that ward, and two councillors to be elected at large.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Colsen cove park 009.jpg|thumb|Colsen Cove generating station]]\n[[File:Old Post Office Saint John.JPG|thumb|The Old Post Office]]\nSaint John derived its economy from maritime industries such as shipping, fishing and shipbuilding. Saint John has a long history of shipbuilding at the city's dry dock, which is one of the largest in the world. Since 2003 shipbuilding has ended on the scale it once was, forcing the city to adopt a new economic strategy. The University of New Brunswick, the New Brunswick Museum and the New Brunswick Community College are important institutions, and along with Radian6, Horizon Health Network and many others, they are a part of Saint John's fast-growing research and information-technology sectors. As the city moves away from its industrial past it now begins to capitalize on the growing sector of tourism, hosting over 1.5 million visitors a year and 200,000 cruise ship visitors a year, creating a renaissance in the city's historic downtown (locally known as uptown). Many small businesses have moved into Uptown and large scale waterfront developments are underway, such as the Fundy Quay (condo, hotel and office space), Saint John Law Courts, and the Three Sisters Harbourfront condos.\n\n===Arts & culture===\nThe arts and culture sector plays a large role in Saint John's economy. The Imperial Theatre is home to the highly acclaimed Saint John Theatre Company, and the Symphony New Brunswick and hosts a large collection of plays, concerts and other stage productions year-round. Harbour Station entertainment complex is home to the Saint John Sea Dogs of the QMJHL and the Saint John Riptide of the NBL.\n\nArt galleries in Saint John cover the uptown, more than any other Atlantic Canadian city. Artists like [[Miller Brittain]] and [[Fred Ross (artist)|Fred Ross]] have made Uptown Saint John their home, and now the torch has been passed to artists like Gerard Collins, Cliff Turner and Peter Salmon and their respective galleries. Uptown art galleries also include the Trinity Galleries, Citadel Gallery, Handworks Gallery and the Saint John Arts Centre (SJAC). The SJAC in the Carnegie Building hosts art exhibits, workshops, local songwriters' circles and other shows too small to be featured at the grand Imperial Theatre.\n\n===Heavy industry===\nSaint John maintains industrial infrastructure in the city's East side such as Canada's largest [[Irving Oil Refinery|oil refinery]]. Capitalist [[Kenneth Colin Irving|K.C. Irving]] and his family built his unfettered industrial conglomerate in the city by buying up mills, shipyards, media outlets, and other industrial infrastructure during the 20th century, and still continue to this day. Today Irving dominates the city and province with stakes in oil, forestry, shipbuilding, media and transportation. Irving companies remain dominant employers in the region with North America's first deepwater oil terminal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/CAN_Saint_John_Port_130.php |title=Saint John Port |website=World Port Source |accessdate=January 10, 2019}}</ref> a pulp mill, a paper mill and a tissue paper plant.\n\nOther important economic activity in the city is generated by the [[Port of Saint John]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sjport.com/|title=Port Saint John|website=https://www.sjport.com/}}</ref>\n\nSaint John has a long history of brewers, such as Simeon Jones, The Olands, and James Ready. The city is now home to Moosehead Breweries, James Ready Brewing Co., Big Tide Brewing Co., Picaroon's and other craft brewers. The [[Moosehead Brewery]] (established in 1867, is Canada's only nationally distributed independent brewery [M. Nicholson]), James Ready Brewing Co., the [[New Brunswick Power Corporation]] which operates three electrical generating stations in the region including the [[Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station]], [[Bell Aliant]] which operates out of the former [[New Brunswick Telephone]] headquarters, the Horizon Health Network, which operates 5 hospitals in the Saint John area,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.horizonnb.ca/home/facilities-and-services/facilities.aspx?cat=1&type=hospital |title=Facilities: Hospitals |publisher=Horizon Health Services |accessdate=August 26, 2019}} Hospitals in the Saint John Region: Charlotte County Hospital, Grand Manan Hospital, Saint John Regional Hospital, St. Joseph's Hospital and Sussex Health Centre.</ref> and numerous [[information technology]] companies.

During the 1980s-early 1990s the shipyard was responsible for building 9 of the 12 {{sclass-|Halifax|frigate|0}} multi-purpose patrol [[frigate]]s for the [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|Canadian Navy]]. However, the Irvings closed the shipyard in 2003 and centralized in Halifax.\n\nPrior to the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] in 1959, the Port of Saint John functioned as the winter port for [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] when shipping was unable to traverse the [[sea ice]] in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] and [[St. Lawrence River]]. The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] opened a line to Saint John from Montreal in 1889 across the state of [[Maine]] and transferred the majority of its trans-Atlantic passenger and cargo shipping to the port during the winter months. The port fell into decline following the seaway opening and the start of year-round [[icebreaker]] services in the 1960s. In 1994 CPR left Saint John when it sold the line to [[Short-line railroad|shortline]] operator [[New Brunswick Southern Railway]]. The [[Canadian National Railway]] still services Saint John with a secondary mainline from [[Moncton]]. Despite these setbacks, Port Saint John is the largest port by volume in Eastern Canada, at about 28 million metric tonnes of cargo per year, including [[Shipping container|containers]] and [[bulk cargo]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Port Saint John |url=https://www.sjport.com/ |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Military===\nBesides being the location of several historical forts, such as Fort Howe, Fort Dufferin, Fort Latour, and the [[Carleton Martello Tower]], Saint John is the location of a number of reserve units of the [[Canadian Forces]].\n\n*[[Canadian Forces Naval Reserve|Naval Reserve]]\n** [[HMCS Brunswicker]]\n*[[37 Canadian Brigade Group]]\n** [[3rd Field Artillery Regiment, RCA]]: Regimental headquarters and 115th Field Battery (The Loyal Company)\n** [[Royal New Brunswick Regiment]] (Carleton & York): B Company\n** 37 Service Battalion: Battalion headquarters and a composite logistics company\n** 37 Signal Regiment: 2 Squadron\n\n==Labour==\n\n===Canada's first trade union===\nSaint John is often described as the birthplace of unionism in Canada and is one of the few pre-capitalist colonial settlements in North America. The city has a history of labour achievements and sparked the Canadian labour movement with Canada's first trade union, the Labourers' Benevolent Association (now International Longshoremen's Association Local 273). In 1849 the union was formed when Saint John's longshoremen banded together to lobby for regular pay and a shorter workday. One of their first resolutions was to apply to the city council for permission to erect the bell, which would announce the beginning and end of the labourers' 10-hour workday. As the bell shears were hardly finished when capitalists and merchants in the city objected to the bell and successfully lobbied city hall to keep the bell from being put up. But then, citizens and longshoremen defied the order and erected a larger bell and merchants withdrew their opposition to the \"Labourers' Bell\". ILA Local 273 remain one of the city's strongest trade unions to this day.<ref>{{cite web|title=For Whom The Bells Toll|url=http://www.wfhathewaylabourexhibitcentre.ca/labour-history/for-whom-the-bells-toll/|publisher=Hatheway Labour Exhibit Center|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Saint John Street Railwaymen\u2019s strike and riot of 1914===\nThe [[1914 Saint John street railway strike]] (sometimes called the ''Saint John street railwaymen's strike'')<ref name=Babcock>{{cite journal |last=Babcock |first=Robert H. |date=January 1982 |title=The Saint John Street Railwaymen's Strike and Riot, 1914 |url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/Acadiensis/article/view/11570/0 |journal=[[Acadiensis]] |publisher=[[University of New Brunswick]] |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages= |issn=0044-5851 |access-date=May 13, 2016}}</ref> was a [[strike action|strike]] by workers on the street railway system in the city which lasted from July 22\u201324, 1914, with rioting by Saint John inhabitants occurring on July 23 and 24. The strike was important for shattering the image of Saint John as a conservative town dominated primarily by ethnic and religious (rather than class) divisions, and highlighting tensions between railway industrialists and the local working population.\n\n[[File:1914 Saint John riot aftermath.jpg|thumb|1914 Saint John Railwaymen's Strike riot]]\n\n===October 14, 1976 - the Saint John General Strike===\nThe Saint John General Strike of 1976 was a result of the Bill C-73 passed by Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and the House of Commons in Ottawa on October 14, 1975. This bill limited wage increases to 8% the first year, 6% the second year, and 4% the third year after its enactment. Most provinces of Canada accepted the bill by spring of 1976, but within eighteen months they began to withdraw from the program. After its introduction in 1975, it was not until 1976 that the Anti-Inflation Board (AIB) began to roll back workers' wages. The employees of Irving Pulp and Paper, members of the Canadian Paper Workers Union, were among the first to experience the roll backs implemented by the AIB. The paper workers were required to give back to the employer 9.8% of their previous wage increase the first year, and 11% the second year. The Atlantic Sugar Refinery workers of the Bakery and Confectionary Workers International Union of America soon felt the burden as well. The majority of workers within Saint John were influenced by the AIB by January 1976. On February 5, 1976, the Saint John District and the Labour Council held a conference to plan an organized opposition to the AIB. Fifty-two people came to the meeting as representatives of twenty-six unions in Saint John. The council was led by the Labour Council president, George Vair. They began by educating those present on wage control legislation, but swiftly transitioned into rallying and demonstrating in opposition throughout the city. Five thousand marched from numerous ends of the town to King Square. All major industries in Saint John were shut down.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian workers strike against wage controls, 1976|url=http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/canadian-workers-strike-against-wage-controls-1976|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Irving Oil Refinery strike, 1994-96===\nOn May 12, 1994, at 4:30 pm, members of Local 691 of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers (CEP) union at the Irving Oil Ltd. Refinery went on strike. At this time the refinery's management took over its operations. Irving had argued the refinery might have to shut down and had to bring in a bevy of rollbacks to the workers\u2019 pay and benefits and other changes to the collective agreement. Local 691 argued Irving simply wished to lengthen the work week without paying workers overtime rates. The strike lasted 27 months and was based on Irving\u2019s demands for flexibility of the workers to ensure the refinery was competitive. The strike is seen as symbolic of a rollback of labour and democratic collective bargaining rights that have been in decline across North America.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Steuter|first1=Erin|last2=Martin|first2=Geoff|title=The Myth of the Competitive Challenge: The Irving Oil Refinery Strike, 1994\u201396 and the Canadian Petroleum Industry|url=http://spe.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/spe/article/view/6728|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Uptown Saint John, from Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|Looking east on the Saint John Throughway, right before the Harbour Bridge and the now closed (since 2011) toll plaza]]\n[[File:June 2009 Saint John Transit Bus.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Saint John Transit]] bus in uptown]]\n\n===Air===\nAir service into Saint John is provided by the [[Saint John Airport|Saint John Airport/A\u00e9roport de Saint-Jean]], near Loch Lomond {{convert|8|NM|lk=in}} east northeast of the central business district<ref name=\"CFS\">{{CFS}}</ref> or approximately {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} by road northeast of the city centre.

New Brunswick's solicitor-general 1784\u20131808, Ward Chipman Sr was known to have fancy soir\u00e9es at his home with all the latest songs from London.

In 1801 Humbert published Union Harmony, the first Canadian music book in English. The Mechanics' Institute, built in 1840, was the first large-scale platform for comic opera and concerts.

In 1968 UNBSJ opened a new campus in the city's Tucker Park neighbourhood. This campus has undergone expansion over the years and is the fastest growing component of the UNB system with many new buildings constructed from the 1970s to the first decade of the 21st century. A trend in recent years has been a growth in the number of international students. The city also hosts a [[New Brunswick Community College]] campus in the East End of the city. There has also been a satellite campus of [[Dalhousie Medical School]] added within the UNBSJ campus in 2010, instructing 30 medical students each year.\n\nIn the fall of 2007, a report commissioned by the provincial government recommended UNBSJ and the NBCC be reformed and consolidated into a new polytechnic post-secondary institute. The proposal immediately came under heavy criticism and led to the organizing of several protests in the uptown area, citing the diminishment of UNB as a nationally accredited university, the reduction in accessibility to receive degrees \u2013 and these are only a couple of the reasons why the community was enraged by the recommendation. Support for keeping UNBSJ as it was, and expanding the university under its current structure, fell slightly below 90%. Seeing too much political capital would be lost, and several Saint John MPs were likely not to support the initiative if the policies recommended by the report were legislated, the government abandoned the commission's report and created an intra-provincial post-secondary commission.\n\nSaint John is served by two school boards: [[Anglophone South School District]] schools and [[Francophone Sud School District]] (based out of [[Dieppe, New Brunswick|Dieppe]], [[New Brunswick]]) for the city's only Francophone school, [[\u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain|Centre-Scolaire-Communautaire Samuel-de-Champlain]]. Saint John is also home to Canada's oldest publicly funded school, [[Saint John High School]]. The other high schools in the city are [[Harbour View High School]], [[St. Malachy's High School]], and [[Simonds High School]].\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\n==Twin/sister cities==\n\n* {{flagicon|SLO}} [[Koper]], Slovenia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/iiapublications/SmartBook/Documents/abbd6fd3-4149-4206-8731-eb53a3ffdc31/abbd6fd3-4149-4206-8731-eb53a3ffdc31.pdf |title=Report:  Visit of the Honourable No\u00ebl A.

Saint John Harbour, where the two rivers meet the Bay of Fundy, is a deep water port and ice-free all year long. Partridge Island is in the harbour.\n\nStonehammer [[UNESCO]] Geopark, the first Geopark in North America, is centred around Saint John. The Geopark has been recognized by UNESCO as having exceptional geological significance. The park contains rock formations throughout the Saint John region ranging billions of years.\n\n[[File:St Martins NB covered bridge.jpg|thumb|Covered bridges dot the Greater Saint John region.]]\n\nThe Saint John River itself flows into the [[Bay of Fundy]] through a narrow gorge several hundred feet wide at the centre of the city. It contains a unique phenomenon called the [[Reversing Falls]] where the diurnal tides of the bay reverse the water flow of the river for several kilometres. A series of underwater ledges at the narrowest point of this gorge also create a series of rapids.\n\nThe topography surrounding Saint John is hilly; a result of the influence of two coastal mountain ranges which run along the Bay of Fundy&nbsp;\u2013 the ''St. Croix Highlands'' and the ''Caledonia Highlands''. The soil throughout the region is extremely rocky with frequent granite outcrops. The coastal plain hosts numerous freshwater lakes in the eastern, western and northern parts of the city.\n\nIn Saint John the height difference from low to high [[tide]] is approximately 8 metres (28&nbsp;ft) due to the funnelling effect of the Bay of Fundy as it narrows. The Reversing Falls in Saint John, actually an area of strong rapids, provides one example of the power of these tides; at every high tide, ocean water is pushed through a narrow gorge in the middle of the city and forces the Saint John River to reverse its flow for several hours.\n\n===Neighbourhoods===\n[[File:SaintJohn1894.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Saint John from 1894, including the lower west (then Carleton), and uptown]]\nSaint John is a city of neighbourhoods, with residents closely identifying with their particular area.\n\n[[File:King Edward VII Memorial Bandstand.JPG|thumb|left|King Edward VII Memorial Bandstand]]\n\n====South (End) Central Peninsula\u2014Uptown====\nThe central peninsula on the east side of [[Saint John Harbour]] and the area immediately opposite on the west side are the sites of the original city, which resulted from the merger of Parrtown and Carleton. The western side of the central peninsula subsequently saw increased development and includes the central business district (CBD) and the [[Trinity Royal Heritage Conservation Area]], which together are referred to as \"Uptown\" by residents throughout the city. The term \"Uptown\" came about as people at the slips would go up the hill to the city. In addition, most of the central peninsula is situated on a hill. This central area of Saint John is only rarely called \"Downtown.\" The south end of the central peninsula, south of Duke Street, is appropriately called the South End.\n\n====North End (Portland/Millidgeville)====\nMuch of the North End is made up of the former city of Portland, a predominantly working class area north of the harbour along the Saint John River. Vessels navigating the Saint John River can only transit the Reversing Falls gorge at [[slack tide]], thus Portland became a location during the 19th and 20th centuries where tugboats and paddle wheelers could dock to wait. Being at the beginning of the navigable part of the Saint John River, Portland also became a major terminal for vessels departing to ply their trade upriver.\n\nFurther north of the central part of the city, and northeast of Portland, along the southern bank of the Kennebecasis River is the area of Millidgeville which is generally considered a neighbourhood separate from Portland. The boundary of Millidgeville is typically thought to begin at the \"Y\" intersection of Somerset Street and Millidge Ave or right after Tartan St. It is a middle to upper-class neighbourhood.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Located here is [[University of New Brunswick]], as well as New Brunswick's largest health care centre, the [[Saint John Regional Hospital]], and Saint John's only completely French school and community centre, [[\u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain|Centre Scolaire Communautaire Samuel-de-Champlain]].\n\nThe eastern area of the North End plays host to the city's largest park, and one of Canada's largest urban parks. [[Rockwood Park, Saint John|Rockwood Park]] encompasses {{convert|890|ha|abbr=on}} of upland Acadian mixed forest, many hills and several caves, as well as several freshwater lakes, with an extensive trail network, a golf course, and the [[Cherry Brook Zoo]]. The park was designed by [[Calvert Vaux]] in the mid-to-late 19th century. Mount Pleasant borders the park, and is generally seen as distinct from the traditionally poorer North End.\n\n===={{anchor|East Side}} East Side (Simonds/Loch Lomond)====\n\n[[File:Church, St. Johns.jpg|thumb|Our Lady of the Assumption Catholic Church in Saint John]]\n\nTo the east of the [[Courtney Bay]] / Forebay and south of [[New Brunswick Route 1]] is the East Side, where the city has experienced its greatest suburban sprawl in recent decades with commercial retail centres and residential subdivisions. There has been significant and consistent commercial and retail development in the Westmorland Road-McAllister Drive-Consumer's Drive-Major's Brook Drive-Retail Drive corridor since the 1970s, including McAllister Place, the city's largest shopping mall, which opened in 1978, and with active year-to-year development since 1994. The city's airport is further east on the coastal plain among several lakes at the far eastern edge of the municipality. Far east side is Loch Lomond, including several urban neighbourhoods found here, including Forest Hills, Champlain Heights, and Lakewood Heights. The malls were built by filling in Major's Brook (a tributary to Marsh Creek), making the area prone to flooding.\n\n====West Side (Carleton/Lancaster/Fairville)====\nThe portion of the city west of the Saint John River is collectively referred to as West Side, although West Saint Johners divide this area into several neighbourhoods. As mentioned previously, the Lower West Side is the former working-class neighbourhood known as Carleton at the time of the city's formation in 1785. West and north of the Lower West Side is the former city of Lancaster (commonly referred to as Saint John West), which was amalgamated into Saint John in 1967. The boundary was City Line Street, with the streets east considered to be the \"West Side\", and the streets west of City Kine Street having been renamed from Lancaster, NB to Saint John West, NB.\n\nThe southern part of Lancaster abutting [[Saint John Harbour]] and the Bay of Fundy is Bayshore and the location of [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s Bayshore Yard. The north end of Lancaster, known as Fairville, is home to [[Moosehead Brewery]] and older neighbourhoods clustered along Manawagonish Road. North of Fairville are the communities of [[Milford, New Brunswick|Milford]] and [[Randolph, New Brunswick|Randolph]]. Randolph, which is home to Dominion Park Beach, includes land on the city's largest island, and is joined by the Canal Bridge over Mosquito Cove on Greenhead Road. The area also contains the Irving Pulp and Paper mill, a highly visible manufacturing plant that sits next to the [[Reversing Falls]] and is owned and operated by [[J. D. Irving|J. D. Irving, Ltd.]]\n\nWest of Lancaster, the city hosts its second largest park, and one of the largest coastal urban parks in the country. The [[Irving Nature Park]], along Saints' Rest Beach, sits on an extensive peninsula called [[Taylor's Island, New Brunswick|Taylor's Island]] extending into the western part of the harbour into the Bay of Fundy. The park is partially open to vehicles in summer and features ocean views and walking trails through mixed forests.\n\n====Suburbs====\n\nSaint John's suburbs, just on the edge of the city limit, are [[Rothesay, New Brunswick|Rothesay]], [[Quispamsis]], and [[Grand Bay\u2013Westfield]]. Mainly residential, the suburbs have attracted many of Saint John's residents, leading the city's population to shrink.\n\n===Climate===\n{{climate chart\n| Saint John\n| \u221213.6 | \u22122.7 | 139\n| \u221212.7 | \u22121.9 |  94\n|  \u22127.3 |  2.3 | 118\n|  \u22121.2 |  8.3 | 104\n|   4.0 | 14.8 | 118\n|   8.4 | 19.5 | 101\n|  11.7 | 22.4 | 102\n|  11.6 | 22.2 |  90\n|   7.7 | 17.7 | 117\n|   2.7 | 11.9 | 125\n|  \u22122.1 |  6.0 | 134\n|  \u22129.7 |  0.3 | 149\n| float  = right\n| clear  = none\n| source = Environment Canada<ref>{{cite web\n| publisher = [[Environment Canada]]\n| url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=6250&prov=&lang=e&dCode=1&dispBack=1&StationName=saint_john&SearchType=Contains&province=ALL&provBut=&month1=0&month2=12\n| title = Saint John A\n| work = Canadian Climate Normals 1971\u20132000\n| accessdate = September 30, 2013}}</ref>}}\nThe climate of Saint John is [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb/Dsb: Warm summer subtype|Dfb]]''). The Bay of Fundy never fully freezes, thus moderating the winter temperatures compared with inland locations. Even so, with the prevailing wind blowing from the west (from land to sea), the average January temperature is about {{convert|-8.2|C}}. Summers are usually warm to hot, and daytime temperatures often exceed {{convert|25|C}}. The highest temperature recorded in a given year is usually {{convert|30|or|31|C|0}}. The confluence of cold Bay of Fundy air and inland warmer temperatures often creates onshore winds that bring periods of fog and cooler temperatures during the summer months.\n\nPrecipitation in Saint John totals about {{convert|1295|mm|abbr=on}} annually and is well distributed throughout the year, although the late autumn and early winter are typically the wettest time of year. Snowfalls can often be heavy, but rain is as common as snow in winter, and it is not unusual for the ground to be snow-free even in mid-winter.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Saint John

The city was incorporated in the late 1700s after more than 3,300 Black Loyalist refugees came to Saint John along with more than 10,000 white refugees after the American Revolution. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-black-history-1.5048864 |title=Before Willie O'Ree: New Brunswick's surprising black history contributions|publisher=CBC |accessdate=10 November 2019}}</ref> In the years between 1815 and 1867, when immigration of that era passed its peak, more than 150,000 immigrants from Ireland came to Saint John dramatically changing the city. \n\nThose who came in the earlier period were largely tradesmen, and many stayed in Saint John, becoming the backbone of its builders. But when the Great Irish Potato Famine raged between 1845 and 1852, huge waves of famine refugees flooded the city's shores. It is estimated that between 1845 and 1847, some 30,000 arrived, more people than were living in the city at the time. In 1847, dubbed \"[[Great Famine (Ireland)|Black 47]]\", one of the worst years of the famine, some 16,000 immigrants, most of them from Ireland, arrived at [[Partridge Island (Saint John County)|Partridge Island]]\n, the immigration and quarantine station at the mouth of Saint John Harbour.<ref>Thomas P.

The largest visible minority groups were [[Black people|Black]] (2.1%), [[Chinese people|Chinese]] (1.4%), [[Arabs|Arab]] (0.9%), and [[South Asian People|South Asian]] (0.7%). 5% of Saint Johners are francophone.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=POPC&Code1=0734&Geo2=PR&Code2=13&SearchText=Saint+John&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Language&TABID=1&type=0 |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to religion, 89.2% identify as Christian (47.6% Protestant, 40.3% Roman Catholic, and 1.3% other Christian, mostly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and independent churches). 10.1% state no religious affiliation, and other religions including [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Hinduism]] together comprise less than 1%.\n\n==Municipal government (Common Council)==\n{{See also|List of mayors of Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\nSaint John is one of five chartered cities in Canada, giving it unique legislative powers.<ref name=\"policyschool\">{{cite web |title=Is \u2018Charter-City Status\u2019 a Solution for Financing City Services in Canada \u2014 Or is that a Myth? |url=https://www.policyschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/charter-city-status-kitchen_0.pdf |publisher=University of Calgary |accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Responsibility===\nSaint John is governed by a body of elected officials, referred to as \"Common Council\", whose responsibilities include:\n* Setting the city operational budget\n* Setting the City Water utility budget/ rates\n* Enacting and amending by-laws\n* Rezoning and land-use permissions of properties in Saint John.\n* Setting the capital budget for the city\n* Acting as the Board of Directors for the corporation \"City of Saint John\"\n* Appointing persons to city staff and commissions\n* Overseeing the operation of city commissions and departments\n\n===Composition===\n{{Main|Saint John City Council}}\nThe Common Council consists of:\n* The Mayor, who runs at-large, acts as Chairman of the Board.\n* Two at-large Common Councillors.\n* Two Common Councillors, from each of the city's four wards.\nOne is elected by the council to serve as Deputy Mayor.\n\nAs of 2017, the Council's members are:\n* Mayor: Don Darling\n* Deputy Mayor: [[Shirley McAlary]]\n* Councillor at Large: Gary Sullivan\n* Ward 1: Blake Armstrong, Greg Norton\n* Ward 2: John MacKenzie, Sean Casey\n* Ward 3: Donna Reardon, David Hickey\n* Ward 4: Ray Strowbridge, David Meritthew\n\nIn the [[2007 Saint John, New Brunswick Ward Plebiscite|October 9, 2007 Plebiscite]], it was decided that as of the May 2008 quadrennial municipal elections, the city will be divided into four wards of approximately equal population, with two councillors to be elected by the voters in that ward, and two councillors to be elected at large.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Colsen cove park 009.jpg|thumb|Colsen Cove generating station]]\n[[File:Old Post Office Saint John.JPG|thumb|The Old Post Office]]\nSaint John derived its economy from maritime industries such as shipping, fishing and shipbuilding. Saint John has a long history of shipbuilding at the city's dry dock, which is one of the largest in the world. Since 2003 shipbuilding has ended on the scale it once was, forcing the city to adopt a new economic strategy. The University of New Brunswick, the New Brunswick Museum and the New Brunswick Community College are important institutions, and along with Radian6, Horizon Health Network and many others, they are a part of Saint John's fast-growing research and information-technology sectors. As the city moves away from its industrial past it now begins to capitalize on the growing sector of tourism, hosting over 1.5 million visitors a year and 200,000 cruise ship visitors a year, creating a renaissance in the city's historic downtown (locally known as uptown). Many small businesses have moved into Uptown and large scale waterfront developments are underway, such as the Fundy Quay (condo, hotel and office space), Saint John Law Courts, and the Three Sisters Harbourfront condos.\n\n===Arts & culture===\nThe arts and culture sector plays a large role in Saint John's economy. The Imperial Theatre is home to the highly acclaimed Saint John Theatre Company, and the Symphony New Brunswick and hosts a large collection of plays, concerts and other stage productions year-round. Harbour Station entertainment complex is home to the Saint John Sea Dogs of the QMJHL and the Saint John Riptide of the NBL.\n\nArt galleries in Saint John cover the uptown, more than any other Atlantic Canadian city. Artists like [[Miller Brittain]] and [[Fred Ross (artist)|Fred Ross]] have made Uptown Saint John their home, and now the torch has been passed to artists like Gerard Collins, Cliff Turner and Peter Salmon and their respective galleries. Uptown art galleries also include the Trinity Galleries, Citadel Gallery, Handworks Gallery and the Saint John Arts Centre (SJAC). The SJAC in the Carnegie Building hosts art exhibits, workshops, local songwriters' circles and other shows too small to be featured at the grand Imperial Theatre.\n\n===Heavy industry===\nSaint John maintains industrial infrastructure in the city's East side such as Canada's largest [[Irving Oil Refinery|oil refinery]]. Capitalist [[Kenneth Colin Irving|K.C. Irving]] and his family built his unfettered industrial conglomerate in the city by buying up mills, shipyards, media outlets, and other industrial infrastructure during the 20th century, and still continue to this day. Today Irving dominates the city and province with stakes in oil, forestry, shipbuilding, media and transportation. Irving companies remain dominant employers in the region with North America's first deepwater oil terminal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/CAN_Saint_John_Port_130.php |title=Saint John Port |website=World Port Source |accessdate=January 10, 2019}}</ref> a pulp mill, a paper mill and a tissue paper plant.\n\nOther important economic activity in the city is generated by the [[Port of Saint John]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sjport.com/|title=Port Saint John|website=https://www.sjport.com/}}</ref>\n\nSaint John has a long history of brewers, such as Simeon Jones, The Olands, and James Ready. The city is now home to Moosehead Breweries, James Ready Brewing Co., Big Tide Brewing Co., Picaroon's and other craft brewers. The [[Moosehead Brewery]] (established in 1867, is Canada's only nationally distributed independent brewery [M. Nicholson]), James Ready Brewing Co., the [[New Brunswick Power Corporation]] which operates three electrical generating stations in the region including the [[Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station]], [[Bell Aliant]] which operates out of the former [[New Brunswick Telephone]] headquarters, the Horizon Health Network, which operates 5 hospitals in the Saint John area,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.horizonnb.ca/home/facilities-and-services/facilities.aspx?cat=1&type=hospital |title=Facilities: Hospitals |publisher=Horizon Health Services |accessdate=August 26, 2019}} Hospitals in the Saint John Region: Charlotte County Hospital, Grand Manan Hospital, Saint John Regional Hospital, St. Joseph's Hospital and Sussex Health Centre.</ref> and numerous [[information technology]] companies. There are also a number of [[call centres]] which were established in the 1990s under provincial government incentives.\n\n{{wide image|Stjohnpanoramo.jpg|1800px|View from Fort Howe of the Saint John skyline prior to Peel Plaza}}\n\n===Maritime activities===\n{{main|Port of Saint John}}\nUntil the first decade of the 21st century, Canada's largest shipyard (Irving Shipbuilding) had been an important employer in the city. During the 1980s-early 1990s the shipyard was responsible for building 9 of the 12 {{sclass-|Halifax|frigate|0}} multi-purpose patrol [[frigate]]s for the [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|Canadian Navy]]. However, the Irvings closed the shipyard in 2003 and centralized in Halifax.\n\nPrior to the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] in 1959, the Port of Saint John functioned as the winter port for [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] when shipping was unable to traverse the [[sea ice]] in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] and [[St. Lawrence River]]. The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] opened a line to Saint John from Montreal in 1889 across the state of [[Maine]] and transferred the majority of its trans-Atlantic passenger and cargo shipping to the port during the winter months. The port fell into decline following the seaway opening and the start of year-round [[icebreaker]] services in the 1960s. In 1994 CPR left Saint John when it sold the line to [[Short-line railroad|shortline]] operator [[New Brunswick Southern Railway]]. The [[Canadian National Railway]] still services Saint John with a secondary mainline from [[Moncton]]. Despite these setbacks, Port Saint John is the largest port by volume in Eastern Canada, at about 28 million metric tonnes of cargo per year, including [[Shipping container|containers]] and [[bulk cargo]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Port Saint John |url=https://www.sjport.com/ |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Military===\nBesides being the location of several historical forts, such as Fort Howe, Fort Dufferin, Fort Latour, and the [[Carleton Martello Tower]], Saint John is the location of a number of reserve units of the [[Canadian Forces]].\n\n*[[Canadian Forces Naval Reserve|Naval Reserve]]\n** [[HMCS Brunswicker]]\n*[[37 Canadian Brigade Group]]\n** [[3rd Field Artillery Regiment, RCA]]: Regimental headquarters and 115th Field Battery (The Loyal Company)\n** [[Royal New Brunswick Regiment]] (Carleton & York): B Company\n** 37 Service Battalion: Battalion headquarters and a composite logistics company\n** 37 Signal Regiment: 2 Squadron\n\n==Labour==\n\n===Canada's first trade union===\nSaint John is often described as the birthplace of unionism in Canada and is one of the few pre-capitalist colonial settlements in North America. The city has a history of labour achievements and sparked the Canadian labour movement with Canada's first trade union, the Labourers' Benevolent Association (now International Longshoremen's Association Local 273). In 1849 the union was formed when Saint John's longshoremen banded together to lobby for regular pay and a shorter workday. One of their first resolutions was to apply to the city council for permission to erect the bell, which would announce the beginning and end of the labourers' 10-hour workday. As the bell shears were hardly finished when capitalists and merchants in the city objected to the bell and successfully lobbied city hall to keep the bell from being put up. But then, citizens and longshoremen defied the order and erected a larger bell and merchants withdrew their opposition to the \"Labourers' Bell\". ILA Local 273 remain one of the city's strongest trade unions to this day.<ref>{{cite web|title=For Whom The Bells Toll|url=http://www.wfhathewaylabourexhibitcentre.ca/labour-history/for-whom-the-bells-toll/|publisher=Hatheway Labour Exhibit Center|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Saint John Street Railwaymen\u2019s strike and riot of 1914===\nThe [[1914 Saint John street railway strike]] (sometimes called the ''Saint John street railwaymen's strike'')<ref name=Babcock>{{cite journal |last=Babcock |first=Robert H. |date=January 1982 |title=The Saint John Street Railwaymen's Strike and Riot, 1914 |url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/Acadiensis/article/view/11570/0 |journal=[[Acadiensis]] |publisher=[[University of New Brunswick]] |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages= |issn=0044-5851 |access-date=May 13, 2016}}</ref> was a [[strike action|strike]] by workers on the street railway system in the city which lasted from July 22\u201324, 1914, with rioting by Saint John inhabitants occurring on July 23 and 24. The strike was important for shattering the image of Saint John as a conservative town dominated primarily by ethnic and religious (rather than class) divisions, and highlighting tensions between railway industrialists and the local working population.\n\n[[File:1914 Saint John riot aftermath.jpg|thumb|1914 Saint John Railwaymen's Strike riot]]\n\n===October 14, 1976 - the Saint John General Strike===\nThe Saint John General Strike of 1976 was a result of the Bill C-73 passed by Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and the House of Commons in Ottawa on October 14, 1975. This bill limited wage increases to 8% the first year, 6% the second year, and 4% the third year after its enactment. Most provinces of Canada accepted the bill by spring of 1976, but within eighteen months they began to withdraw from the program. After its introduction in 1975, it was not until 1976 that the Anti-Inflation Board (AIB) began to roll back workers' wages. The employees of Irving Pulp and Paper, members of the Canadian Paper Workers Union, were among the first to experience the roll backs implemented by the AIB. The paper workers were required to give back to the employer 9.8% of their previous wage increase the first year, and 11% the second year. The Atlantic Sugar Refinery workers of the Bakery and Confectionary Workers International Union of America soon felt the burden as well. The majority of workers within Saint John were influenced by the AIB by January 1976. On February 5, 1976, the Saint John District and the Labour Council held a conference to plan an organized opposition to the AIB. Fifty-two people came to the meeting as representatives of twenty-six unions in Saint John. The council was led by the Labour Council president, George Vair. They began by educating those present on wage control legislation, but swiftly transitioned into rallying and demonstrating in opposition throughout the city. Five thousand marched from numerous ends of the town to King Square. All major industries in Saint John were shut down.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian workers strike against wage controls, 1976|url=http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/canadian-workers-strike-against-wage-controls-1976|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Irving Oil Refinery strike, 1994-96===\nOn May 12, 1994, at 4:30 pm, members of Local 691 of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers (CEP) union at the Irving Oil Ltd. Refinery went on strike. At this time the refinery's management took over its operations. Irving had argued the refinery might have to shut down and had to bring in a bevy of rollbacks to the workers\u2019 pay and benefits and other changes to the collective agreement. Local 691 argued Irving simply wished to lengthen the work week without paying workers overtime rates. The strike lasted 27 months and was based on Irving\u2019s demands for flexibility of the workers to ensure the refinery was competitive. The strike is seen as symbolic of a rollback of labour and democratic collective bargaining rights that have been in decline across North America.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Steuter|first1=Erin|last2=Martin|first2=Geoff|title=The Myth of the Competitive Challenge: The Irving Oil Refinery Strike, 1994\u201396 and the Canadian Petroleum Industry|url=http://spe.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/spe/article/view/6728|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Uptown Saint John, from Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|Looking east on the Saint John Throughway, right before the Harbour Bridge and the now closed (since 2011) toll plaza]]\n[[File:June 2009 Saint John Transit Bus.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Saint John Transit]] bus in uptown]]\n\n===Air===\nAir service into Saint John is provided by the [[Saint John Airport|Saint John Airport/A\u00e9roport de Saint-Jean]], near Loch Lomond {{convert|8|NM|lk=in}} east northeast of the central business district<ref name=\"CFS\">{{CFS}}</ref> or approximately {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} by road northeast of the city centre.

Working class fishers, labourers and shipbuilders carried Maritime traditions and folk songs with kitchen parties and outdoor gatherings. But musical high-culture was captured by the wealthy. New Brunswick's solicitor-general 1784\u20131808, Ward Chipman Sr was known to have fancy soir\u00e9es at his home with all the latest songs from London. A notable Loyalist musician, Stephen Humbert, moved in 1783 from New Jersey to Saint John and opened a Sacred Vocal Music School. In 1801 Humbert published Union Harmony, the first Canadian music book in English. The Mechanics' Institute, built in 1840, was the first large-scale platform for comic opera and concerts. In 1950 The Saint John Symphony was founded by Kelsey Jones; by 1983 the organization became [[Symphony New Brunswick]].

In 1968 UNBSJ opened a new campus in the city's Tucker Park neighbourhood. This campus has undergone expansion over the years and is the fastest growing component of the UNB system with many new buildings constructed from the 1970s to the first decade of the 21st century. A trend in recent years has been a growth in the number of international students. The city also hosts a [[New Brunswick Community College]] campus in the East End of the city. There has also been a satellite campus of [[Dalhousie Medical School]] added within the UNBSJ campus in 2010, instructing 30 medical students each year.\n\nIn the fall of 2007, a report commissioned by the provincial government recommended UNBSJ and the NBCC be reformed and consolidated into a new polytechnic post-secondary institute. The proposal immediately came under heavy criticism and led to the organizing of several protests in the uptown area, citing the diminishment of UNB as a nationally accredited university, the reduction in accessibility to receive degrees \u2013 and these are only a couple of the reasons why the community was enraged by the recommendation. Support for keeping UNBSJ as it was, and expanding the university under its current structure, fell slightly below 90%. Seeing too much political capital would be lost, and several Saint John MPs were likely not to support the initiative if the policies recommended by the report were legislated, the government abandoned the commission's report and created an intra-provincial post-secondary commission.\n\nSaint John is served by two school boards: [[Anglophone South School District]] schools and [[Francophone Sud School District]] (based out of [[Dieppe, New Brunswick|Dieppe]], [[New Brunswick]]) for the city's only Francophone school, [[\u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain|Centre-Scolaire-Communautaire Samuel-de-Champlain]]. Saint John is also home to Canada's oldest publicly funded school, [[Saint John High School]].

Players assume the role of a [[space marine]], popularly known as \"[[Doomguy]]\", fighting his way through hordes of invading [[demon]]s from [[Hell]]. The first episode, comprising nine levels, was distributed freely as [[shareware]] and played by an estimated 15\u201320&nbsp;million people within two years; the full game, with two further episodes, was sold via [[mail order]]. An updated version with an additional episode and more difficult levels, ''Ultimate Doom'', was released in 1995 and sold at retail.\n\nAlong with its predecessor ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', ''Doom'' helped define the FPS genre and inspired numerous similar games, known as \"[[Doom clone|''Doom'' clones]]\". It is one of the most significant games in [[video game history]], and is frequently cited as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest games of all time]]. It pioneered [[online distribution]] and technologies including [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]], networked [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer gaming]], and support for customized [[Mod (video games)|modifications]] via packaged files ([[Doom modding|WAD]]s). However, its graphic violence and hellish imagery also made it a [[video game controversies|subject of controversy]].\n\n''Doom'' has been [[Official versions of Doom|ported to numerous platforms]]. The [[Doom (franchise)|''Doom'' franchise]] continued with ''[[Doom II|Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'' (1994) and [[expansion pack]]s including ''[[Master Levels for Doom II]]'' (1995). The [[source code]] was released in 1997, inspiring further adaptations. Id returned to the franchise with ''[[Doom 3]]'' (2004), a horror-focused retelling using the [[id Tech 4]] engine, followed by a 2005 [[Doom (film)|''Doom'' film]]. A new series, returning to the fast-paced action of the originals, began with the 2016 reboot ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', followed in 2020 by ''[[Doom Eternal]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:Doom ingame 1.png|thumb|right|The player armed with a chainsaw confronts an undead sergeant on a bridge over a chemical waste storage in \"Knee-Deep in the Dead\"]]\n\n''Doom'' is a [[first-person shooter]] presented with early [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]]. The player controls an unnamed space marine\u2014later termed the [[Doomguy]]\u2014through a series of [[Level (video games)|levels]] set in military bases on the moons of Mars and in Hell. To finish a level, the player must traverse through the area to reach a marked exit room. Levels are grouped together into named episodes, with the final level focusing on a [[Boss (video games)|boss fight]] with a particularly difficult enemy. While the levels are presented in a 3D perspective, the enemies and objects are instead 2D [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] presented from several set viewing angles, a technique sometimes referred to as [[2.5D]] graphics. Levels are often labyrinthine, and a full screen [[automap]] is available which shows the areas explored to that point.\n\nWhile traversing the levels, the player must fight a variety of enemies, including demons and [[Spirit possession|possessed]] undead humans, while managing supplies of ammunition, [[Health (games)|health]], and armor. Enemies often appear in large groups, and the game features five [[difficulty level]]s which increase the quantity and damage done by enemies, with enemies respawning upon death and moving faster than normal on the hardest difficulty setting. The monsters have very simple behavior, consisting of either moving toward their opponent, or attacking by throwing fireballs, biting, and clawing. They will [[Artificial intelligence in video games|fight each other]] if one monster is accidentally harmed by another, though most monsters are not harmed by other monsters of the same kind. Levels can also include pits of [[toxic waste]], ceilings that lower and crush anything below them, and locked doors which require a [[keycard]], skull-shaped key device, or a remote switch to be opened. The player can find weapons and ammunition placed in the levels or can collect them from dead enemies; weapons include a pistol, a [[chainsaw]], a [[plasma rifle]], and the [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]], among others. The levels also feature [[power-up]]s such as items that give health or armor points, increase the player character's maximum ammunition or health, fill out the automap, give partial invisibility, or allow the player to survive in toxic waste. There are also items which apply time-limited effects such as invulnerability or a [[Berserker#Modern context|berserker]] status.\n\nIn addition to the main [[single-player video game|single-player]] game mode, ''Doom'' features two [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] modes playable over a local network: \"[[cooperative gameplay|cooperative]]\", in which two to four players team up to play through the main game,<ref name=\"DoomVirtualWorlds\"/> and \"[[deathmatch]]\", in which two to four players play against each other. [[Online multiplayer]] was later made available a year after launch through the [[DWANGO]] service.<ref name=\"mastersofdoom\"/> ''Doom'' also contains [[cheat code]]s that allow the player to be invulnerable, obtain every weapon, be able to instantly kill every monster in a particular level, and several other abilities.<ref name=\"DoomCheat\"/><ref name=\"DoomAchieve\"/><ref name=\"DoomExtreme\"/><ref name=\"DoomWorld\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:The anonymous space marine from DOOM.png|thumb|right|The unnamed protagonist of the ''Doom'' series as he appears in ''The Ultimate Doom'']]\n''Doom'' is divided into three episodes: \"Knee-Deep in the Dead\", \"The Shores of Hell\", and \"Inferno\". A fourth episode, \"Thy Flesh Consumed\", was added in an expanded version of the game, ''The Ultimate Doom''. The game itself contains very few plot elements, with the minimal story instead given in the instruction manual and short text segues between episodes.\n\nIn the future, the player character (an unnamed space marine) has been punitively posted to [[Mars]] after assaulting a superior officer, who ordered his unit to fire on civilians. The space marines act as security for the Union Aerospace Corporation's radioactive waste facilities, which are used by the military to perform secret experiments with [[teleportation]] by creating gateways between the two moons of Mars, [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]. Three years later, Deimos disappears entirely and \"something fraggin' evil\" starts pouring out of the teleporter gateways, killing or possessing all personnel. The Martian marine unit is dispatched to investigate, with the player character left to guard the perimeter with only a pistol while the rest of the group proceeds inside the base and is killed. Being unable to pilot the shuttle off of Phobos by himself, he realizes that the only way to escape is to go inside and fight his way through the complexes of the moon base. \n\nAs the last man standing, the player character fights through the onslaught of demonic enemies to keep them from attacking Earth. In \"Knee-Deep in the Dead\", he fights through the high-tech military bases, power plants, computer centers and geological anomalies on Phobos. It ends with the player character entering the teleporter leading to Deimos, only to be overwhelmed by monsters. In \"The Shores of Hell\" he fights through installations on Deimos, similar to those on Phobos, but warped and distorted from the demon invasion and interwoven with beastly architecture. After defeating the titanic [[Cyberdemon]], the marine discovers the vanished moon is floating above [[Hell]]. \"Inferno\" begins after the marine climbs off Deimos to the surface. The marine fights his way through Hell and defeats the Spider Mastermind that planned the invasion. A hidden doorway back to Earth opens for the hero, who has \"proven too tough for Hell to contain\". However, a burning city and a rabbit's head impaled on a stake (named in ''The Ultimate Doom'' as the marine's pet rabbit, Daisy) show that the demons have invaded Earth, setting the stage for ''[[Doom II|Doom II: Hell on Earth]]''. In \"Thy Flesh Consumed\", the marine fights the demons on Earth through a variety of disconnected high-tech bases and demonic temples, though ultimately the forces of Hell prevail in the invasion of Earth.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:John Carmack E3 2006.jpg|thumb|[[John Carmack]] in 2006|alt=Black-and-white photo of the head and shoulders of a man wearing glasses]]\n{{Main|Development of Doom}}\n\n===Concept===\nIn May 1992, [[id Software]] released ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', later called the \"grandfather of 3D shooters\",<ref name=\"CGWHallofFame\"/><ref name=\"VGB\"/> specifically first-person shooters, because it established the fast-paced action and technical prowess commonly expected in the genre and greatly increased the genre's popularity.<ref name=\"CGWHallofFame\"/><ref name=\"AGGreview\"/><ref name=\"IGN100\"/><ref name=\"WIREDretro\"/> Immediately following its release most of the id Software team began work on a set of episodes for the game, titled ''Spear of Destiny'', while id co-founder and lead programmer [[John Carmack]] instead focused on technology research for the company's next game. Following the release of ''Spear of Destiny'' in September 1992, the team began to plan their next title. They wanted to create another 3D game using a new engine Carmack was developing, but were largely tired of ''Wolfenstein''. They initially considered making another game in the ''[[Commander Keen]]'' series, as proposed by co-founder and lead designer [[Tom Hall]], but decided that the platforming gameplay of the series was a poor fit for Carmack's fast-paced 3D engines. Additionally, the other two co-founders of id, designer [[John Romero]] and lead artist [[Adrian Carmack]], wanted to create something in a darker style than the ''Keen'' games. John Carmack then came up with his own concept: a game about using technology to fight demons, inspired by the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' campaigns the team played, combining the styles of ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' and ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''.<ref name=\"MOD118121\"/><ref name=\"GDC2011\"/> The concept originally had a working title of \"Green and Pissed\", but Carmack soon named the proposed game after a line in the film ''[[The Color of Money]]'': \"'What's in the case?' / 'In here? Doom.'\"<ref name=\"MOD118121\"/><ref name=\"MonsterId\"/>\n\nThe team agreed to pursue the ''Doom'' concept, and development began in November 1992.<ref name=\"GDC2011\"/> The initial development team was composed of five people: programmers John Carmack and Romero, artists Adrian Carmack and [[Kevin Cloud]], and designer Hall.<ref name=\"IGNvideo\"/> They moved offices to a dark office building, which they named \"Suite 666\", and drew inspiration from the noises coming from the dentist's office next door. They also decided to cut ties with [[3D Realms|Apogee Software]], their previous publisher, and to instead self-publish ''Doom''.<ref name=\"MOD122123\"/>\n\n===Development===\n[[File:John Romero - Jason Scott interview (6951215353) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[John Romero]] in 2012|alt=Face of a smiling man with long black hair and glasses]]\nEarly in development, rifts in the team began to appear. At the end of November, Hall delivered a [[software design description|design document]], which he named the ''Doom Bible'', that described the plot, backstory, and design goals for the project.<ref name=\"GDC2011\"/> His design was a science fiction horror concept wherein scientists on the Moon open a portal that aliens emerge from. Over a series of levels the player discovers that the aliens are demons while hell steadily infects the level design over the course of the game.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/> John Carmack not only disliked the idea but dismissed the idea of having a story at all: \"Story in a game is like story in a porn movie; it's expected to be there, but it's not that important.\" Rather than a deep story, he wanted to focus on the technological innovations of the game, dropping the levels and episodes of ''Wolfenstein'' in favor of a fast, continuous world. Tom disliked the idea, but the rest of the team sided with Carmack.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/> Hall spent the next few weeks reworking the ''Doom Bible'' to work with Carmack's technological ideas.<ref name=\"GDC2011\"/> Hall was forced to rework it again in December, however, after the team decided that they were unable to create a single, seamless world with the hardware limitations of the time, which contradicted much of the document.<ref name=\"GDC2011\"/>\n\nAt the start of 1993, id put out a press release, touting Hall's story about fighting off demons while \"knee-deep in the dead\". The press release proclaimed the new game features that John Carmack had created, as well as other features, including multiplayer gaming features, that had not yet even been designed.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/> Early versions of the game were built to match the ''Doom Bible''; a \"pre-alpha\" version of the first level included Hall's introductory base scene.<ref name=\"MCV\"/> Initial versions of the game also retain \"arcade\" elements present in ''Wolfenstein 3D'', like score points and score items, but those were removed early in development as they were out of tone.<ref name=\"IGNvideo\"/> Other elements, such as a complex user interface, an inventory system, a secondary shield protection, and [[life (video games)|lives]] were modified and slowly removed over the course of development.<ref name=\"GDC2011\"/><ref name=\"DoomHorizon\"/>\n\n[[File:Sandy Petersen in May 2004.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sandy Petersen]] in 2004|upright]]\nSoon, however, the ''Doom Bible'' as a whole was rejected: Romero wanted a game even \"more brutal and fast\" than ''Wolfenstein'', which did not leave room for the character-driven plot Hall had created. Additionally, the team believed it emphasized realism over entertaining gameplay, and they did not see the need for a design document at all.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/> Some ideas were retained, but the story was dropped and most of the game design was removed.<ref name=\"DSSS249250\"/> By early 1993, levels were being created for the game and a demo was produced. John Carmack and Romero, however, disliked Hall's military base-inspired level design. Romero especially believed that the boxy, flat level designs were uninspiring, too similar to ''Wolfenstein'', and did not show off the engine's capabilities. He began to create his own, more abstract levels for the game, which the rest of the team saw as a great improvement.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/><ref name=\"MattChat\"/>\n\nHall was upset with the reception to his designs and how little impact he was having as the lead designer.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/><ref name=\"MCV\"/> He was also upset with how much he was having to fight with John Carmack in order to get what he saw as obvious gameplay improvements, such as flying enemies, and began to spend less time at work.<ref name=\"GDC2011\"/> In July the other founders of id fired Hall, who went to work for Apogee.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/> He was replaced in September, ten weeks before the game was released, by game designer [[Sandy Petersen]].<ref name=\"Petersen\"/><ref name=\"MOD132147\"/> The team also added a third programmer, [[Dave Taylor (game programmer)|Dave Taylor]].<ref name=\"RomeroGDC\"/> Petersen and Romero designed the rest of ''Doom''{{'}}s levels with different aims: the team believed that Petersen's designs were more technically interesting and varied, while Romero's were more aesthetically interesting.<ref name=\"MOD132147\"/> In late 1993, after the multiplayer component was coded, the development team began playing four-player multiplayer games matches, which Romero termed \"[[deathmatch]]\".<ref name=\"MOD148153\"/> According to Romero, the game's deathmatch mode was inspired by [[fighting game]]s such as ''[[Street Fighter II: The World Warrior|Street Fighter II]]'', ''[[Fatal Fury]]'', and ''[[Art of Fighting]]''.<ref name=\"Deathmatch\"/>\n\n===Engine===\n{{see also|Doom engine}}\n[[Image:NeXTstation.jpg|thumb|A [[NeXTstation]] computer]]\n''Doom'' was programmed largely in the [[ANSI C]] programming language, with a few elements done in [[assembly language]]. Development was done on [[NeXT]] computers running the [[NeXTSTEP]] operating system.<ref name=\"CGWLight\"/> The data used by the game engine, including both level designs and graphics files, are all stored in [[Doom modding|WAD]] files, short for \"Where's All the Data\". This allows for any part of the game's design to be easily changed without needing to adjust the engine code. Carmack designed this system specifically to enable fans to be able to easily modify the game; he had been impressed by the modifications made by fans of ''Wolfenstein 3D'', and wanted to support that with an easily swappable file structure along with releasing the map editor online.<ref name=\"MOD166\"/>\n\nUnlike ''Wolfenstein'', which had flat levels with walls at right angles, the ''Doom'' engine allows for walls and floors at any angle or height, though two traversable areas cannot be on top of each other. The lighting system was based on adjusting the color palette of surfaces directly: rather than calculating how light traveled from light sources to surfaces using [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]], the game calculates the \"light level\" of a small section of a level based on its distance from light sources. It then modifies the color palette of that section's surface textures to mimic how dark it would look.<ref name=\"CGWLight\"/> This same system is used to cause far away surfaces to look darker than close ones.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/> Romero came up with new ways to use Carmack's lighting engine such as strobe lights.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/> He also programmed engine features such as switches and movable stairs and platforms.<ref name=\"GDC2011\"/><ref name=\"IGNvideo\"/> After Romero's level designs started to cause problems with the engine, Carmack began to use [[binary space partitioning]] to quickly select the portion of a level that the player could see at a given time.<ref name=\"GDC2011\"/><ref name=\"MOD132147\"/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hutchison|first=Andrew|date=2008|title=Making the water move: techno-historic limits in the game aesthetics of Myst and Doom.|url=https://espace.curtin.edu.au/handle/20.500.11937/10418|journal=Game Studies |language=en|volume=8|issue=1}}</ref> Taylor, along with programming other features into the game, added [[cheat codes]]; some, such as 'idspispopd', were based on ideas their fans had come up with while eagerly awaiting the game.<ref name=\"IGNvideo\"/>\n\n[[File:Spider Mastermind model.jpg|thumb|right|Model of the Spider Mastermind]]\nAdrian Carmack was the lead artist for ''Doom'', with Kevin Cloud as an additional artist. They designed the monsters to be \"nightmarish\"; their intent was to have graphics that were realistic and dark as opposed to staged or rendered, so a [[mixed media]] approach was taken to the artwork.<ref name=\"DSSS247\"/> The artists sculpted models of some of the enemies, and took pictures of them in [[stop motion]] from five to eight different angles so that they could be rotated realistically in-game; the images were then digitized and converted to 2D characters with a program written by John Carmack.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/> Adrian Carmack made clay models for a few demons, and had [[Gregor Punchatz]] build latex and metal sculptures of the others.<ref name=\"GDC2011\"/><ref name=\"IGNvideo\"/> The weapons were toys, with parts combined from different toys to make more guns.<ref name=\"GDC2011\"/> They scanned themselves as well, using Cloud's arm as the model for the player character's arm holding a gun, and Adrian's snakeskin boots and wounded knee for in-game textures.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/>\n\n=== Music and sound ===\nAs with ''Wolfenstein 3D'', id hired composer [[Bobby Prince]] to create the music and sound effects. Romero directed Prince to make the music in [[techno]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] styles; many tracks were directly inspired by songs by metal bands such as [[Alice in Chains]] and [[Pantera]].<ref name=\"MOD132147\"/><ref name=\"Metal\"/> Prince believed that [[ambient music]] would be more appropriate, and produced numerous tracks in both styles in the hopes of convincing the team; Romero put both styles in the game.<ref name=\"SDF5255\"/> Prince did not make music for specific levels, as they were composed before the levels were completed; instead, Romero assigned each track to each level late in development. Prince created the sound effects based on short descriptions or concept art of a monster or weapon, and adjusted them to match the completed animations.<ref name=\"PrinceDoom\"/> The monster sounds were created from animal noises, and Prince designed all the sounds to be distinct on the limited sound hardware of the time, even when many sounds were playing at once.<ref name=\"MOD132147\"/><ref name=\"SDF5255\"/> He also designed the sound effects to play on different frequencies from those used for the MIDI music, so they would clearly cut through the music.<ref name=\"ComposersPlay4\">{{YouTube|id=_PRGzvSbZcI|title=Composers Play - \"Doom\" Coop with Bobby Prince! - Part 4}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nBecause id planned to self-publish, as ''Doom'' neared completion they had to set up the systems to sell it. Jay Wilbur, who had been brought on as CEO and sole member of the business team, planned the marketing and distribution of ''Doom''. He believed that the mainstream press was uninterested in the game, and as id would make the most money off of copies they sold directly to customers\u2014up to 85 percent of the planned {{US$|40}} price\u2014he decided to leverage the shareware market as much as possible, buying only a single ad in any gaming magazine. Instead, he reached out directly to software retailers, offering them copies of the first ''Doom'' episode for free, allowing them to charge any price for it, in order to spur customer interest in buying the full game directly from id.<ref name=\"MOD132147\"/>\n\n''Doom''{{'}}s original release date was the third quarter of 1993, which the team did not meet. By December 1993, the team was working non-stop on the game, with several employees sleeping at the office; programmer Dave Taylor claimed that working on the game gave him such a rush that he would pass out from the intensity. Id began receiving calls from people interested in the game or angry that it had missed its planned release date, as hype for the game had been building online. At midnight on December 10, 1993, after working for 30 straight hours, the development team at id uploaded the first episode of the game to the internet, letting interested players distribute it for them. So many users were connected to the first network that they planned to upload the game to\u2014the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Parkside]] [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] network\u2014that even after the network administrator increased the number of connections while on the phone with Wilbur, id was unable to connect, forcing them to kick all other users off to allow id to upload the game. When the upload finished thirty minutes later, 10,000 people attempted to download the game at once, crashing the university's network.<ref name=\"MOD148153\"/>\n\nWithin hours of ''Doom''{{'}}s release, university networks were banning ''Doom'' multiplayer games, as a rush of players overwhelmed their systems.<ref name=\"MOD148153\" /> After being alerted by network administrators the morning after release that the game's deathmatch network connection setup was crippling some [[computer network]]s, John Carmack quickly released a patch to change it, though many administrators had to implement ''Doom''-specific rules to keep their networks from crashing due to the overwhelming traffic.<ref name=\"QuickPatch\" /> \n\nIn late 1995, ''Doom'' was estimated to be installed on more computers worldwide than Microsoft's new operating system, [[Windows 95]], even with Microsoft's million-dollar advertising campaigns.<ref name=\"windows-95\" /> Microsoft hired id Software to port Doom to Windows with the [[WinG]] API,<ref name=\"cgw199407\" /> and Microsoft CEO [[Bill Gates]] briefly considered buying the company.<ref name=\"mastersofdoom\" /> Microsoft developed a Windows 95 port of ''Doom'' to promote Windows as a gaming platform. The development team was led by [[Gabe Newell]], who later founded the game company [[Valve Corporation|Valve]].<ref name=\"windows-95\" /> One Windows 95 promotional video had Gates digitally superimposed into the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reelsplatter.com/doommedia.html|title=Bonus movie: Bill Gates \"DOOM\" video|author=Lombardo, Mike|publisher=Reel Splatter|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002034515/http://www.reelsplatter.com/doommedia.html|archivedate=October 2, 2009|accessdate=November 15, 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Expansions and ports===\n{{main|Official versions of Doom}}\n\nThe popularity of ''Doom'' led to the development of an expanded version, ''The Ultimate Doom'' (1995), which includes a fourth episode.<ref name=\"UltDoom\"/> Numerous [[porting|ports]] of the game have been released by other companies. An unofficial port of ''Doom'' to Linux was released by id programmer [[Dave Taylor (game programmer)|Dave Taylor]] in 1994; it was hosted by id but not supported or made official.<ref name=\"Doomlinux\"/> Official ports of ''Doom'' were released for [[32X|Sega 32X]], [[Atari Jaguar]], and [[Mac OS]] in 1994, [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1995, [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]] in 1996, [[Sega Saturn]] in 1997, [[Acorn Computers Ltd|Acorn]] [[Risc PC]] in 1998, [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2001, [[Xbox 360]] in 2006, and [[iOS]] in 2009. Notable exceptions in the list of official ports, as well as Linux, are [[AmigaOS]] and [[Symbian]].<ref name=\"IGNDoomVersions\"/><ref name=\"DoomJaguar\"/><ref name=\"DOOM3BFG\"/> Some of these were bestsellers even many years after the initial release.<ref name=\"PSMags\"/> ''Doom'' has additionally been ported unofficially to numerous platforms; so many ports exist, including for esoteric devices such as smart thermostats and oscilloscopes, that variations on \"It runs ''Doom''\" or \"Can it run ''Doom''?\" are long-running phrases and [[meme]]s.<ref name=\"ItRunsDoom1\"/><ref name=\"ItRunsDoom2\"/><ref name=\"ItRunsDoom3\"/>\n\n===Mods===\nThe ability for others to create custom levels and otherwise modify the game using WAD files turned out to be a popular aspect of ''Doom''. Gaining the first large [[mod (video games)|mod]]-making community, ''Doom'' affected the culture surrounding first-person shooters, and also the industry. Several future professional [[game designer]]s started their careers making ''Doom'' WADs as a hobby, among them [[Tim Willits]], who later became the lead designer at id Software.\n\nThe first [[level editor]]s appeared in early 1994, and additional tools have been created that allow most aspects of the game to be edited. Although the majority of WADs contain one or several custom levels mostly in the style of the original game, others implement new monsters and other resources, and heavily alter the gameplay; several popular movies, television series, other video games and other brands from popular culture have been turned into ''Doom'' WADs by fans, including ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball|Dragon Ball Z]]'', ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'', ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'', ''[[Batman]]'', and ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]''.<ref name=\"SonicDoom\"/> Some works, like the ''Theme Doom Patch'', combined enemies from several films, such as ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', and ''[[The Terminator]]''. Some add-on files were also made that changed the sounds made by the various characters and weapons.\n\nAround 1994 and 1995, WADs were primarily distributed online over [[bulletin board system]]s or sold in collections on compact discs in computer shops, sometimes bundled with editing guide books. [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] servers became the primary method in later years. A few WADs have been released commercially, including the ''[[Master Levels for Doom II]]'', which was released in 1995 along with ''Maximum Doom'', a CD containing 1,830 WADs that had been downloaded from the Internet. Several thousand WADs have been created in total: the ''idgames'' FTP archive contains over 18,000 files,<ref name=\"DoomWADFTP\"/> and this represents only a fraction of the complete output of ''Doom'' fans. Third-party programs were also written to handle the loading of various WADs, since the game is a [[DOS]] game and all commands had to be entered on the [[command line]] to run. A typical launcher would allow the player to select which files to load from a menu, making it much easier to start. In 1995, [[WizardWorks]] released the ''D!Zone'' pack featuring hundreds of levels for ''Doom'' and ''Doom II''.<ref name=\"Dragon217\"/> ''D!Zone'' was reviewed in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' by Jay & Dee; Jay gave the pack 1 out of 5 stars, while Dee gave the pack 1\u00bd stars.<ref name=\"Dragon217\"/>\n\nIn 2016, Romero published two new ''Doom'' levels - E1M4b (\"''Phobos Mission Control''\") and E1M8b (\"''Tech Gone Bad''\").<ref name=\"NewLevels\"/><ref name=\"RomeroLevels\"/> In 2018, for the 25th anniversary of DOOM, Romero announced an unofficial 5th Episodic pack of 9 levels. The 5th episode is titled ''Sigil of the Baphomet''. The music for the 5th episode is composed entirely by [[Buckethead]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/10/18134302/sigil-doom-sequel-john-romero-release-date-price|title=John Romero is making a spiritual successor to the original version of Doom|last=Hall|first=Charlie|date=2018-12-10|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = SNES: 54%<ref name=\"GR-SNES\"/><br />PS: 84%<ref name=\"GR-PS\"/><br />GBA: 80%<ref name=\"GR-GBA\"/><br />X360: 80%<ref name=\"GR-X360\"/><br />iOS: 83%<ref name=\"GR-iOS\"/>\n| MC = GBA: 81/100<ref name=\"MC-GBA\"/><br />X360: 82/100<ref name=\"MC-X360\"/><br />iOS: 84/100<ref name=\"MC-iOS\"/>\n| Allgame = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Allgame\"/>\n| Dragon = {{rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"Dragon203\"/>\n| Edge = 7 / 10<ref name=\"Edge\"/>\n| GSpot = 9 /10<ref name=Spot>{{cite web |last=Scisco|first=Peter |date=May 1, 1996 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907042421/http://www.gamespot.com:80/pc/action/ultimatedoom/review.html |title=The Ultimate Doom Review (GameSpot)|publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref>\n| GMaster = 90%<ref name=\"GR-PC\"/>\n| NGen = {{rating|3|5}} (Jaguar)<ref name=\"NG\">{{cite magazine|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=1|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=January 1995|page=92}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[TouchArcade]]''\n| rev1Score = iOS: {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"TouchArcade\"/>\n| rev2 = ''[[Total!]]''\n| rev2Score = SNES: 93%<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Danny|date=October 1995|title=Doom|url=https://archive.org/details/Total046-DoomSNES|journal=[[Total!]]|volume=|issue=46|pages=24\u201327|access-date=February 19, 2019}}</ref>\n| award1Pub = ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''\n| award1 = 1994 Game of the Year{{r|cgw199406}}<br />#5, 150 Best Games of All Time{{r|cgw199611best}}<br />#3, 15 Most Innovative Computer Games{{r|cgw199611mostinnovative}}\n| award2Pub = [[GameSpy]]\n| award2 = #1, Top 50 Games of All Time{{r|gamespy20010701}}\n| award3Pub = [[IGN]]\n| award3 = #44, Top 100 Games of All Time (2003){{r|IGNtop100}}<br />#39, Top 100 Games (2005){{r|IGNtop1002005}}<br />#2, Top 100 Shooters{{r|IGNtopshooters}}\n| award4Pub = ''[[Retro Gamer]]''\n| award4 = #9, Top Retro Games\n| award5Pub = [[Library of Congress]]\n| award5 = [[Game canon]]{{r|Joystiq}}\n| award6Pub = [[GameTrailers]]\n| award6 = #1, Top Ten Breakthrough PC Games{{r|gttopten}}\n| award7Pub = ''[[Game Informer]]''\n| award7 = #7, Top 200 Games of All Time{{r|gi_best}}\n| award8Pub = ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]''\n| award8 = All-TIME 100 Video Games{{r|AccoTimeAllTime}}\n| award9Pub = [[GameSpot]]\n| award9 = The Greatest Games of All Time{{r|shoemaker20060131}}\n| award10Pub = ''[[PC Gamer UK]]''\n| award10 = #3, Top 50 Games of All Time{{r|pcgameruktop50}}\n}}\n\n''Doom'' became a problem at workplaces, both occupying the time of employees and clogging computer networks. [[Intel]],<ref name=\"cgw199403\"/> [[Lotus Development]], and [[Carnegie Mellon University]] were among many organizations reported to form policies specifically disallowing ''Doom''-playing during work hours. At the [[Microsoft]] campus, ''Doom'' was by one account equal to a \"religious phenomenon\".<ref name=\"mastersofdoom\"/> Doom was #1 on ''Computer Gaming World''{{'}}s \"Playing Lately?\" survey for February 1994. One reader said that \"No other game even compares to the addictiveness of NetDoom with four devious players! ... The only game I've stayed up 72+ straight hours to play\", while another reported that \"Linking four people together for a game of Doom is the quickest way to destroy a productive, boring evening of work\".<ref name=\"cgw199404wh\"/>\n\n[[File:Billdoom.png|thumb|To promote [[Windows 95]], [[Bill Gates]], aware of the video game's popularity, showcased a video presentation while digitally superimposed into ''Doom'']]\nAlthough Petersen said ''Doom'' was \"nothing more than the computer equivalent of [[Whack-A-Mole]]\",<ref name=\"schuytema199408\" /> ''Doom'' received critical acclaim and was widely praised in the gaming press, broadly considered to be one of the most important and influential titles in gaming history. Upon release, ''[[GamesMaster]]'' gave it a 90% rating.<ref name=\"GR-PC\" /> ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' gave it five stars, praising the improvements over ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', the \"fast-moving [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[shoot 'em up]]\" gameplay, and network play.<ref name=\"Dragon203\" /> A common criticism of ''Doom'' was that it was not a true 3D game, since the game engine did not allow corridors and rooms to be stacked on top of one another ([[room-over-room]]), and instead relied on graphical trickery to make it appear that the player character and enemies were moving along differing elevations.<ref name=\"NotTrue3D\" />\n\n''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated in February 1994 that ''Wolfenstein 3D'' fans should \"look forward to a delight of insomnia\", and \"Since networking is supported, bring along a friend to share in the visceral delights\".<ref name=\"cgw199402\"/> A longer review in March 1994 said that ''Doom'' \"was worth the wait ... a wonderfully involved and engaging game\", and its technology \"a new benchmark\" for the gaming industry. The reviewer praised the \"simply ''dazzling''\" graphics\", and reported that \"DeathMatches may be the most intense gaming experience available today\". While criticizing the \"ho-hum endgame\" with a too-easy [[end boss]], he concluded that ''Doom'' \"is a virtuoso performance\".<ref name=\"walker199403\"/>\n\n''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' criticized the \"fairly simple\" gameplay but praised the graphics and levels. The review concluded: \"You\u2019lI be longing for something new in this game. If only you could talk to these creatures, then perhaps you could try and make friends with them, form alliances...

''[[PC Zone]]''{{'}}s David McCandless wrote that the game was played by \"an estimated six million people across the globe\",<ref name=\"gamesthatchanged\"/> while other sources estimate that 10\u201320 million people played ''Doom'' within 24 months of its launch.<ref name=\"wargames\"/>\n\n===Controversies===\n{{See also|List of banned video games}}\n[[File:Doom gibs.png|thumb|''Doom''{{'s}} intense level of graphic violence made the game highly controversial. This screenshot shows the effects of a rocket hitting a group of enemies.]]\n\n''Doom'' was notorious for its high levels of [[graphic violence]]<ref name=\"DoomViolence\"/> and [[Satanism|satanic]] imagery, which generated controversy from a broad range of groups. ''Doom'' for the Genesis 32X was one of the first video games to be given an M for Mature rating from the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] due to its violent gore and nature.<ref name=\"DoomMature\"/> [[Yahoo! Games]] listed it as one of the top ten most controversial games of all time.<ref name=\"DoomYahoo\"/> It was criticized by religious organizations for its diabolic undertones and was dubbed a \"mass murder simulator\" by critic and [[Killology]] Research Group founder [[Dave Grossman (author)|David Grossman]].<ref name=\"DoomKillology\"/> ''Doom'' prompted fears that the then-emerging [[virtual reality]] technology could be used to simulate extremely realistic killing.\n\nThe game again sparked controversy in the United States when it was found that [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], who committed the [[Columbine High School massacre]] on April 20, 1999, were avid players of the game. While planning for the massacre, Harris said in his journal that the killing would be \"like playing ''Doom''\", and \"it'll be like the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|LA riots]], the [[Oklahoma City bombing|Oklahoma bombing]], [[World War II]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], ''[[Duke Nukem 3D|Duke Nukem]]'' and ''Doom'' all mixed together\", and that his shotgun was \"straight out of the game\".<ref name=\"DoomHighSchool\"/> A rumor spread afterwards that Harris had designed a ''Doom'' level that looked like the high school, populated with representations of Harris's classmates and teachers, and that Harris practiced for his role in the shootings by playing the level over and over. Although Harris did design ''Doom'' levels that were never affiliated with the official ''Doom'' release, which later became known as the '[[Doom modding#Miscellaneous|Harris levels]]', none have been found to be based on [[Columbine High School]] and 7 of which can be played today.<ref name=\"The Harris levels\"/>\n\nIn the release versions before 1.2-1.4, the game has been banned in [[Germany]] due to a [[swastika]] in E1M4. The ban was lifted after id Software changed the ''Swastika'', and said that \"it was the homage of ''Wolfenstein 3D''\".{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===''Doom'' franchise===\n{{main|Doom (franchise)}}\n\n''Doom'' has appeared in several forms in addition to video games, including a ''Doom'' comic book, four novels by [[Dafydd Ab Hugh]] and [[Brad Linaweaver]] (loosely based on events and locations in the games), a [[Doom: The Boardgame|''Doom'' board game]] and [[Doom (film)|a live-action film]] starring [[Karl Urban]] and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] released in 2005. The game's development and impact on popular culture is also the subject of the book ''[[Masters of Doom|Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture]]'' by [[David Kushner]].\n\nThe ''Doom'' series remained dormant between 1997 and 2000, when ''[[Doom 3]]'' was finally announced. A retelling of the original ''Doom'' using entirely new graphics technology and a slower paced survival horror approach, ''Doom 3'' was hyped to provide as large a leap in realism and interactivity as the original game and helped renew interest in the franchise when it was released in 2004, under the [[id Tech 4]] game engine.\n\nThe series again remained dormant for 10 years until a remake, simply titled [[Doom (2016 video game)|''Doom'']] and running on the new [[id Tech 6]], was announced with a beta access to players that had pre-ordered ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]''. The game held its closed alpha multiplayer testing in October 2015, as closed and open beta access ran during March to April 2016. Returning to the series' roots in fast-paced action and minimal storytelling, the full game eventually released worldwide on May 13, 2016. The project initially started as ''Doom 4'' in May 2008, set to be a remake of ''[[Doom II|Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'' and ditching the survival horror aspect of ''Doom 3''. Development completely restarted as id's Tim Willits remarked that ''Doom 4'' was \"lacking the personality of the long-running shooter franchise\".<ref name=\"mtv\"/>\n\n===Clones===\n{{Main|First-person shooter}}\n[[File:Doom clone vs first person shooter.png|thumb|The phrase \"[[Doom clone|''Doom'' clone]]\" was initially popular to describe the style of gameplay in ''Doom''-style games, but was gradually replaced by \"[[first-person shooter]]\" after 1996. By 1998, the phrase \"first-person shooter\" had firmly superseded \"''Doom'' clone\".]]\n''Doom'' was influential and dozens of new first-person shooter titles appeared following ''Doom''{{'s}} release, and they were often referred to as \"[[Doom clone|''Doom'' clones]]\" rather than \"first-person shooters\". The term \"''Doom'' clone\" was used to describe the style of gameplay in ''Doom''-style games. While the term was initially popular, it was, after 1996, gradually replaced by \"[[first-person shooter]]\", and the phrase \"first-person shooter\" had firmly superseded \"''Doom'' clone\" around 1998. Some of these were certainly \"[[Clone (computing)|clones]]\", hastily assembled and quickly forgotten, while others explored new grounds of the genre and were highly acclaimed. Many of the games closely imitated features in ''Doom'' such as the selection of weapons and cheat codes. ''Doom''{{'s}} principal rivals were [[3D Realms|Apogee]]'s ''[[Rise of the Triad]]'' and [[Looking Glass Studios]]' ''[[System Shock]]''. The popularity of ''[[Star Wars]]''-themed WADs is rumored to have been the factor that prompted [[LucasArts]] to create their first-person shooter ''[[Dark Forces]]''.<ref name=\"DoomClones\"/>\n\nThe ''Doom'' game engine was licensed by id Software to several other companies, who released their own games using the technology, including ''[[Heretic (video game)|Heretic]]'', ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic]]'', ''[[Strife (1996 video game)|Strife: Quest for the Sigil]]'', and ''[[Doom modding#Total conversions|Hacx: Twitch 'n Kill]]''. A ''Doom''-based game called ''[[Chex Quest]]'' was released in 1996 by [[Ralston Foods]] as a promotion to increase cereal sales,<ref name=\"DoomChex\"/> and the [[United States Marine Corps]] released ''[[Marine Doom]]''.\n\nWhen [[3D Realms]] released ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'' in 1996, a tongue-in-cheek science fiction shooter based on [[Ken Silverman]]'s technologically similar [[Build (game engine)|''Build'' engine]], id Software was nearly finished developing ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', its next-generation game, which mirrored ''Doom''{{'}}s success for much of the remainder of the 1990s and reduced interest in its predecessor (Wolfenstein 3D).\n\n===Community===\nIn addition to the thrilling nature of the single-player game, the [[deathmatch]] mode was an important factor in the game's popularity. ''Doom'' was not the first first-person shooter with a deathmatch mode; ''[[Maze War]]'', an FPS released in 1974, was running multiplayer deathmatch over [[ethernet]] on Xerox computers by 1977. The widespread distribution of PC systems and the violence in ''Doom'' made deathmatching particularly attractive. Two-player multiplayer was possible over a phone line by using a [[modem]], or by linking two PCs with a null-modem cable. Because of its widespread distribution, ''Doom'' hence became the game that introduced deathmatching to a large audience and was also the first game to use the term \"deathmatch\".<ref name=\"Deathmatchterm\"/>\n\nAlthough the popularity of the ''Doom'' games dropped with the release of more modern first-person shooters, the game still retains a strong fan base that continues to this day by playing competitively and creating WADs, and ''Doom''-related news is still tracked at multiple websites such as Doomworld. Interest in ''Doom'' was renewed in 1997, when the [[source code]] for the [[Doom engine|''Doom'' engine]] was released (it was also placed under the [[GNU General Public License]] on October 3, 1999). Fans then began [[porting]] the game to various operating systems, even to previously unsupported platforms such as the [[Dreamcast]]. As for the PC, over 50 different [[List of Doom source ports|''Doom'' source ports]] have been developed. New features such as [[OpenGL]] rendering and [[Scripting language|scripting]] allow WADs to alter the gameplay more radically.\n\nDevoted players have spent years creating [[speedrun]]s for ''Doom'', competing for the quickest completion times and sharing knowledge about routes through the levels and how to exploit [[software bug|bugs]] in the ''Doom'' engine for shortcuts. Achievements include the completion of both ''Doom'' and ''Doom II'' on the \"Ultra-Violence\" difficulty setting in less than 30&nbsp;minutes each. In addition, a few players have also managed to complete ''Doom II'' in a single run on the difficulty setting \"Nightmare!\", on which monsters are more aggressive, launch faster projectiles (or, in the case of the Pinky Demon, simply move faster), and respawn roughly 30&nbsp;seconds after they have been killed (level designer John Romero characterized the idea of such a run as \"[just having to be] impossible\").<ref name=\"DoomNightmare\"/> Movies of most of these runs are available from the COMPET-N website.<ref name=\"DoomCOMPET-N\"/>\n\nOnline co-op and deathmatch play are still continued on [[List of Doom source ports|fan created services]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- unused references -->\n<!-- <ref name=\"DoomRelease\">{{cite web

[[First-person shooter]]\n| modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]], [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]\n}}\n\n'''''Doom''''' is a 1993 [[first-person shooter]] developed by [[id Software]] for [[MS-DOS]]. Players assume the role of a [[space marine]], popularly known as \"[[Doomguy]]\", fighting his way through hordes of invading [[demon]]s from [[Hell]]. The first episode, comprising nine levels, was distributed freely as [[shareware]] and played by an estimated 15\u201320&nbsp;million people within two years; the full game, with two further episodes, was sold via [[mail order]]. An updated version with an additional episode and more difficult levels, ''Ultimate Doom'', was released in 1995 and sold at retail.\n\nAlong with its predecessor ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', ''Doom'' helped define the FPS genre and inspired numerous similar games, known as \"[[Doom clone|''Doom'' clones]]\". It is one of the most significant games in [[video game history]], and is frequently cited as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest games of all time]]. It pioneered [[online distribution]] and technologies including [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]], networked [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer gaming]], and support for customized [[Mod (video games)|modifications]] via packaged files ([[Doom modding|WAD]]s). However, its graphic violence and hellish imagery also made it a [[video game controversies|subject of controversy]].\n\n''Doom'' has been [[Official versions of Doom|ported to numerous platforms]]. The [[Doom (franchise)|''Doom'' franchise]] continued with ''[[Doom II|Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'' (1994) and [[expansion pack]]s including ''[[Master Levels for Doom II]]'' (1995). The [[source code]] was released in 1997, inspiring further adaptations. Id returned to the franchise with ''[[Doom 3]]'' (2004), a horror-focused retelling using the [[id Tech 4]] engine, followed by a 2005 [[Doom (film)|''Doom'' film]]. A new series, returning to the fast-paced action of the originals, began with the 2016 reboot ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', followed in 2020 by ''[[Doom Eternal]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:Doom ingame 1.png|thumb|right|The player armed with a chainsaw confronts an undead sergeant on a bridge over a chemical waste storage in \"Knee-Deep in the Dead\"]]\n\n''Doom'' is a [[first-person shooter]] presented with early [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]]. The player controls an unnamed space marine\u2014later termed the [[Doomguy]]\u2014through a series of [[Level (video games)|levels]] set in military bases on the moons of Mars and in Hell. To finish a level, the player must traverse through the area to reach a marked exit room. Levels are grouped together into named episodes, with the final level focusing on a [[Boss (video games)|boss fight]] with a particularly difficult enemy. While the levels are presented in a 3D perspective, the enemies and objects are instead 2D [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] presented from several set viewing angles, a technique sometimes referred to as [[2.5D]] graphics. Levels are often labyrinthine, and a full screen [[automap]] is available which shows the areas explored to that point.\n\nWhile traversing the levels, the player must fight a variety of enemies, including demons and [[Spirit possession|possessed]] undead humans, while managing supplies of ammunition, [[Health (games)|health]], and armor. Enemies often appear in large groups, and the game features five [[difficulty level]]s which increase the quantity and damage done by enemies, with enemies respawning upon death and moving faster than normal on the hardest difficulty setting. The monsters have very simple behavior, consisting of either moving toward their opponent, or attacking by throwing fireballs, biting, and clawing. They will [[Artificial intelligence in video games|fight each other]] if one monster is accidentally harmed by another, though most monsters are not harmed by other monsters of the same kind. Levels can also include pits of [[toxic waste]], ceilings that lower and crush anything below them, and locked doors which require a [[keycard]], skull-shaped key device, or a remote switch to be opened. The player can find weapons and ammunition placed in the levels or can collect them from dead enemies; weapons include a pistol, a [[chainsaw]], a [[plasma rifle]], and the [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]], among others. The levels also feature [[power-up]]s such as items that give health or armor points, increase the player character's maximum ammunition or health, fill out the automap, give partial invisibility, or allow the player to survive in toxic waste. There are also items which apply time-limited effects such as invulnerability or a [[Berserker#Modern context|berserker]] status.\n\nIn addition to the main [[single-player video game|single-player]] game mode, ''Doom'' features two [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] modes playable over a local network: \"[[cooperative gameplay|cooperative]]\", in which two to four players team up to play through the main game,<ref name=\"DoomVirtualWorlds\"/> and \"[[deathmatch]]\", in which two to four players play against each other. [[Online multiplayer]] was later made available a year after launch through the [[DWANGO]] service.<ref name=\"mastersofdoom\"/> ''Doom'' also contains [[cheat code]]s that allow the player to be invulnerable, obtain every weapon, be able to instantly kill every monster in a particular level, and several other abilities.<ref name=\"DoomCheat\"/><ref name=\"DoomAchieve\"/><ref name=\"DoomExtreme\"/><ref name=\"DoomWorld\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:The anonymous space marine from DOOM.png|thumb|right|The unnamed protagonist of the ''Doom'' series as he appears in ''The Ultimate Doom'']]\n''Doom'' is divided into three episodes: \"Knee-Deep in the Dead\", \"The Shores of Hell\", and \"Inferno\". A fourth episode, \"Thy Flesh Consumed\", was added in an expanded version of the game, ''The Ultimate Doom''. The game itself contains very few plot elements, with the minimal story instead given in the instruction manual and short text segues between episodes.\n\nIn the future, the player character (an unnamed space marine) has been punitively posted to [[Mars]] after assaulting a superior officer, who ordered his unit to fire on civilians. The space marines act as security for the Union Aerospace Corporation's radioactive waste facilities, which are used by the military to perform secret experiments with [[teleportation]] by creating gateways between the two moons of Mars, [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]. Three years later, Deimos disappears entirely and \"something fraggin' evil\" starts pouring out of the teleporter gateways, killing or possessing all personnel. The Martian marine unit is dispatched to investigate, with the player character left to guard the perimeter with only a pistol while the rest of the group proceeds inside the base and is killed. Being unable to pilot the shuttle off of Phobos by himself, he realizes that the only way to escape is to go inside and fight his way through the complexes of the moon base. \n\nAs the last man standing, the player character fights through the onslaught of demonic enemies to keep them from attacking Earth. In \"Knee-Deep in the Dead\", he fights through the high-tech military bases, power plants, computer centers and geological anomalies on Phobos. It ends with the player character entering the teleporter leading to Deimos, only to be overwhelmed by monsters. In \"The Shores of Hell\" he fights through installations on Deimos, similar to those on Phobos, but warped and distorted from the demon invasion and interwoven with beastly architecture. After defeating the titanic [[Cyberdemon]], the marine discovers the vanished moon is floating above [[Hell]]. \"Inferno\" begins after the marine climbs off Deimos to the surface. The marine fights his way through Hell and defeats the Spider Mastermind that planned the invasion. A hidden doorway back to Earth opens for the hero, who has \"proven too tough for Hell to contain\". However, a burning city and a rabbit's head impaled on a stake (named in ''The Ultimate Doom'' as the marine's pet rabbit, Daisy) show that the demons have invaded Earth, setting the stage for ''[[Doom II|Doom II: Hell on Earth]]''. In \"Thy Flesh Consumed\", the marine fights the demons on Earth through a variety of disconnected high-tech bases and demonic temples, though ultimately the forces of Hell prevail in the invasion of Earth.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:John Carmack E3 2006.jpg|thumb|[[John Carmack]] in 2006|alt=Black-and-white photo of the head and shoulders of a man wearing glasses]]\n{{Main|Development of Doom}}\n\n===Concept===\nIn May 1992, [[id Software]] released ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', later called the \"grandfather of 3D shooters\",<ref name=\"CGWHallofFame\"/><ref name=\"VGB\"/> specifically first-person shooters, because it established the fast-paced action and technical prowess commonly expected in the genre and greatly increased the genre's popularity.<ref name=\"CGWHallofFame\"/><ref name=\"AGGreview\"/><ref name=\"IGN100\"/><ref name=\"WIREDretro\"/> Immediately following its release most of the id Software team began work on a set of episodes for the game, titled ''Spear of Destiny'', while id co-founder and lead programmer [[John Carmack]] instead focused on technology research for the company's next game. Following the release of ''Spear of Destiny'' in September 1992, the team began to plan their next title. They wanted to create another 3D game using a new engine Carmack was developing, but were largely tired of ''Wolfenstein''. They initially considered making another game in the ''[[Commander Keen]]'' series, as proposed by co-founder and lead designer [[Tom Hall]], but decided that the platforming gameplay of the series was a poor fit for Carmack's fast-paced 3D engines. Additionally, the other two co-founders of id, designer [[John Romero]] and lead artist [[Adrian Carmack]], wanted to create something in a darker style than the ''Keen'' games. John Carmack then came up with his own concept: a game about using technology to fight demons, inspired by the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' campaigns the team played, combining the styles of ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' and ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''.<ref name=\"MOD118121\"/><ref name=\"GDC2011\"/> The concept originally had a working title of \"Green and Pissed\", but Carmack soon named the proposed game after a line in the film ''[[The Color of Money]]'': \"'What's in the case?' / 'In here? Doom.'\"<ref name=\"MOD118121\"/><ref name=\"MonsterId\"/>\n\nThe team agreed to pursue the ''Doom'' concept, and development began in November 1992.<ref name=\"GDC2011\"/> The initial development team was composed of five people: programmers John Carmack and Romero, artists Adrian Carmack and [[Kevin Cloud]], and designer Hall.<ref name=\"IGNvideo\"/> They moved offices to a dark office building, which they named \"Suite 666\", and drew inspiration from the noises coming from the dentist's office next door. They also decided to cut ties with [[3D Realms|Apogee Software]], their previous publisher, and to instead self-publish ''Doom''.<ref name=\"MOD122123\"/>\n\n===Development===\n[[File:John Romero - Jason Scott interview (6951215353) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[John Romero]] in 2012|alt=Face of a smiling man with long black hair and glasses]]\nEarly in development, rifts in the team began to appear. At the end of November, Hall delivered a [[software design description|design document]], which he named the ''Doom Bible'', that described the plot, backstory, and design goals for the project.<ref name=\"GDC2011\"/> His design was a science fiction horror concept wherein scientists on the Moon open a portal that aliens emerge from. Over a series of levels the player discovers that the aliens are demons while hell steadily infects the level design over the course of the game.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/> John Carmack not only disliked the idea but dismissed the idea of having a story at all: \"Story in a game is like story in a porn movie; it's expected to be there, but it's not that important.\" Rather than a deep story, he wanted to focus on the technological innovations of the game, dropping the levels and episodes of ''Wolfenstein'' in favor of a fast, continuous world. Tom disliked the idea, but the rest of the team sided with Carmack.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/> Hall spent the next few weeks reworking the ''Doom Bible'' to work with Carmack's technological ideas.<ref name=\"GDC2011\"/> Hall was forced to rework it again in December, however, after the team decided that they were unable to create a single, seamless world with the hardware limitations of the time, which contradicted much of the document.<ref name=\"GDC2011\"/>\n\nAt the start of 1993, id put out a press release, touting Hall's story about fighting off demons while \"knee-deep in the dead\". The press release proclaimed the new game features that John Carmack had created, as well as other features, including multiplayer gaming features, that had not yet even been designed.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/> Early versions of the game were built to match the ''Doom Bible''; a \"pre-alpha\" version of the first level included Hall's introductory base scene.<ref name=\"MCV\"/> Initial versions of the game also retain \"arcade\" elements present in ''Wolfenstein 3D'', like score points and score items, but those were removed early in development as they were out of tone.<ref name=\"IGNvideo\"/> Other elements, such as a complex user interface, an inventory system, a secondary shield protection, and [[life (video games)|lives]] were modified and slowly removed over the course of development.<ref name=\"GDC2011\"/><ref name=\"DoomHorizon\"/>\n\n[[File:Sandy Petersen in May 2004.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sandy Petersen]] in 2004|upright]]\nSoon, however, the ''Doom Bible'' as a whole was rejected: Romero wanted a game even \"more brutal and fast\" than ''Wolfenstein'', which did not leave room for the character-driven plot Hall had created. Additionally, the team believed it emphasized realism over entertaining gameplay, and they did not see the need for a design document at all.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/> Some ideas were retained, but the story was dropped and most of the game design was removed.<ref name=\"DSSS249250\"/> By early 1993, levels were being created for the game and a demo was produced. John Carmack and Romero, however, disliked Hall's military base-inspired level design. Romero especially believed that the boxy, flat level designs were uninspiring, too similar to ''Wolfenstein'', and did not show off the engine's capabilities. He began to create his own, more abstract levels for the game, which the rest of the team saw as a great improvement.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/><ref name=\"MattChat\"/>\n\nHall was upset with the reception to his designs and how little impact he was having as the lead designer.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/><ref name=\"MCV\"/> He was also upset with how much he was having to fight with John Carmack in order to get what he saw as obvious gameplay improvements, such as flying enemies, and began to spend less time at work.<ref name=\"GDC2011\"/> In July the other founders of id fired Hall, who went to work for Apogee.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/> He was replaced in September, ten weeks before the game was released, by game designer [[Sandy Petersen]].<ref name=\"Petersen\"/><ref name=\"MOD132147\"/> The team also added a third programmer, [[Dave Taylor (game programmer)|Dave Taylor]].<ref name=\"RomeroGDC\"/> Petersen and Romero designed the rest of ''Doom''{{'}}s levels with different aims: the team believed that Petersen's designs were more technically interesting and varied, while Romero's were more aesthetically interesting.<ref name=\"MOD132147\"/> In late 1993, after the multiplayer component was coded, the development team began playing four-player multiplayer games matches, which Romero termed \"[[deathmatch]]\".<ref name=\"MOD148153\"/> According to Romero, the game's deathmatch mode was inspired by [[fighting game]]s such as ''[[Street Fighter II: The World Warrior|Street Fighter II]]'', ''[[Fatal Fury]]'', and ''[[Art of Fighting]]''.<ref name=\"Deathmatch\"/>\n\n===Engine===\n{{see also|Doom engine}}\n[[Image:NeXTstation.jpg|thumb|A [[NeXTstation]] computer]]\n''Doom'' was programmed largely in the [[ANSI C]] programming language, with a few elements done in [[assembly language]]. Development was done on [[NeXT]] computers running the [[NeXTSTEP]] operating system.<ref name=\"CGWLight\"/> The data used by the game engine, including both level designs and graphics files, are all stored in [[Doom modding|WAD]] files, short for \"Where's All the Data\". This allows for any part of the game's design to be easily changed without needing to adjust the engine code. Carmack designed this system specifically to enable fans to be able to easily modify the game; he had been impressed by the modifications made by fans of ''Wolfenstein 3D'', and wanted to support that with an easily swappable file structure along with releasing the map editor online.<ref name=\"MOD166\"/>\n\nUnlike ''Wolfenstein'', which had flat levels with walls at right angles, the ''Doom'' engine allows for walls and floors at any angle or height, though two traversable areas cannot be on top of each other. The lighting system was based on adjusting the color palette of surfaces directly: rather than calculating how light traveled from light sources to surfaces using [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]], the game calculates the \"light level\" of a small section of a level based on its distance from light sources. It then modifies the color palette of that section's surface textures to mimic how dark it would look.<ref name=\"CGWLight\"/> This same system is used to cause far away surfaces to look darker than close ones.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/> Romero came up with new ways to use Carmack's lighting engine such as strobe lights.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/> He also programmed engine features such as switches and movable stairs and platforms.<ref name=\"GDC2011\"/><ref name=\"IGNvideo\"/> After Romero's level designs started to cause problems with the engine, Carmack began to use [[binary space partitioning]] to quickly select the portion of a level that the player could see at a given time.<ref name=\"GDC2011\"/><ref name=\"MOD132147\"/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hutchison|first=Andrew|date=2008|title=Making the water move: techno-historic limits in the game aesthetics of Myst and Doom.|url=https://espace.curtin.edu.au/handle/20.500.11937/10418|journal=Game Studies |language=en|volume=8|issue=1}}</ref> Taylor, along with programming other features into the game, added [[cheat codes]]; some, such as 'idspispopd', were based on ideas their fans had come up with while eagerly awaiting the game.<ref name=\"IGNvideo\"/>\n\n[[File:Spider Mastermind model.jpg|thumb|right|Model of the Spider Mastermind]]\nAdrian Carmack was the lead artist for ''Doom'', with Kevin Cloud as an additional artist. They designed the monsters to be \"nightmarish\"; their intent was to have graphics that were realistic and dark as opposed to staged or rendered, so a [[mixed media]] approach was taken to the artwork.<ref name=\"DSSS247\"/> The artists sculpted models of some of the enemies, and took pictures of them in [[stop motion]] from five to eight different angles so that they could be rotated realistically in-game; the images were then digitized and converted to 2D characters with a program written by John Carmack.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/> Adrian Carmack made clay models for a few demons, and had [[Gregor Punchatz]] build latex and metal sculptures of the others.<ref name=\"GDC2011\"/><ref name=\"IGNvideo\"/> The weapons were toys, with parts combined from different toys to make more guns.<ref name=\"GDC2011\"/> They scanned themselves as well, using Cloud's arm as the model for the player character's arm holding a gun, and Adrian's snakeskin boots and wounded knee for in-game textures.<ref name=\"MOD124131\"/>\n\n=== Music and sound ===\nAs with ''Wolfenstein 3D'', id hired composer [[Bobby Prince]] to create the music and sound effects. Romero directed Prince to make the music in [[techno]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] styles; many tracks were directly inspired by songs by metal bands such as [[Alice in Chains]] and [[Pantera]].<ref name=\"MOD132147\"/><ref name=\"Metal\"/> Prince believed that [[ambient music]] would be more appropriate, and produced numerous tracks in both styles in the hopes of convincing the team; Romero put both styles in the game.<ref name=\"SDF5255\"/> Prince did not make music for specific levels, as they were composed before the levels were completed; instead, Romero assigned each track to each level late in development. Prince created the sound effects based on short descriptions or concept art of a monster or weapon, and adjusted them to match the completed animations.<ref name=\"PrinceDoom\"/> The monster sounds were created from animal noises, and Prince designed all the sounds to be distinct on the limited sound hardware of the time, even when many sounds were playing at once.<ref name=\"MOD132147\"/><ref name=\"SDF5255\"/> He also designed the sound effects to play on different frequencies from those used for the MIDI music, so they would clearly cut through the music.<ref name=\"ComposersPlay4\">{{YouTube|id=_PRGzvSbZcI|title=Composers Play - \"Doom\" Coop with Bobby Prince! - Part 4}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nBecause id planned to self-publish, as ''Doom'' neared completion they had to set up the systems to sell it. Jay Wilbur, who had been brought on as CEO and sole member of the business team, planned the marketing and distribution of ''Doom''. He believed that the mainstream press was uninterested in the game, and as id would make the most money off of copies they sold directly to customers\u2014up to 85 percent of the planned {{US$|40}} price\u2014he decided to leverage the shareware market as much as possible, buying only a single ad in any gaming magazine. Instead, he reached out directly to software retailers, offering them copies of the first ''Doom'' episode for free, allowing them to charge any price for it, in order to spur customer interest in buying the full game directly from id.<ref name=\"MOD132147\"/>\n\n''Doom''{{'}}s original release date was the third quarter of 1993, which the team did not meet. By December 1993, the team was working non-stop on the game, with several employees sleeping at the office; programmer Dave Taylor claimed that working on the game gave him such a rush that he would pass out from the intensity. Id began receiving calls from people interested in the game or angry that it had missed its planned release date, as hype for the game had been building online. At midnight on December 10, 1993, after working for 30 straight hours, the development team at id uploaded the first episode of the game to the internet, letting interested players distribute it for them. So many users were connected to the first network that they planned to upload the game to\u2014the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Parkside]] [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] network\u2014that even after the network administrator increased the number of connections while on the phone with Wilbur, id was unable to connect, forcing them to kick all other users off to allow id to upload the game. When the upload finished thirty minutes later, 10,000 people attempted to download the game at once, crashing the university's network.<ref name=\"MOD148153\"/>\n\nWithin hours of ''Doom''{{'}}s release, university networks were banning ''Doom'' multiplayer games, as a rush of players overwhelmed their systems.<ref name=\"MOD148153\" /> After being alerted by network administrators the morning after release that the game's deathmatch network connection setup was crippling some [[computer network]]s, John Carmack quickly released a patch to change it, though many administrators had to implement ''Doom''-specific rules to keep their networks from crashing due to the overwhelming traffic.<ref name=\"QuickPatch\" /> \n\nIn late 1995, ''Doom'' was estimated to be installed on more computers worldwide than Microsoft's new operating system, [[Windows 95]], even with Microsoft's million-dollar advertising campaigns.<ref name=\"windows-95\" /> Microsoft hired id Software to port Doom to Windows with the [[WinG]] API,<ref name=\"cgw199407\" /> and Microsoft CEO [[Bill Gates]] briefly considered buying the company.<ref name=\"mastersofdoom\" /> Microsoft developed a Windows 95 port of ''Doom'' to promote Windows as a gaming platform. The development team was led by [[Gabe Newell]], who later founded the game company [[Valve Corporation|Valve]].<ref name=\"windows-95\" /> One Windows 95 promotional video had Gates digitally superimposed into the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reelsplatter.com/doommedia.html|title=Bonus movie: Bill Gates \"DOOM\" video|author=Lombardo, Mike|publisher=Reel Splatter|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002034515/http://www.reelsplatter.com/doommedia.html|archivedate=October 2, 2009|accessdate=November 15, 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Expansions and ports===\n{{main|Official versions of Doom}}\n\nThe popularity of ''Doom'' led to the development of an expanded version, ''The Ultimate Doom'' (1995), which includes a fourth episode.<ref name=\"UltDoom\"/> Numerous [[porting|ports]] of the game have been released by other companies. An unofficial port of ''Doom'' to Linux was released by id programmer [[Dave Taylor (game programmer)|Dave Taylor]] in 1994; it was hosted by id but not supported or made official.<ref name=\"Doomlinux\"/> Official ports of ''Doom'' were released for [[32X|Sega 32X]], [[Atari Jaguar]], and [[Mac OS]] in 1994, [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1995, [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]] in 1996, [[Sega Saturn]] in 1997, [[Acorn Computers Ltd|Acorn]] [[Risc PC]] in 1998, [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2001, [[Xbox 360]] in 2006, and [[iOS]] in 2009. Notable exceptions in the list of official ports, as well as Linux, are [[AmigaOS]] and [[Symbian]].<ref name=\"IGNDoomVersions\"/><ref name=\"DoomJaguar\"/><ref name=\"DOOM3BFG\"/> Some of these were bestsellers even many years after the initial release.<ref name=\"PSMags\"/> ''Doom'' has additionally been ported unofficially to numerous platforms; so many ports exist, including for esoteric devices such as smart thermostats and oscilloscopes, that variations on \"It runs ''Doom''\" or \"Can it run ''Doom''?\" are long-running phrases and [[meme]]s.<ref name=\"ItRunsDoom1\"/><ref name=\"ItRunsDoom2\"/><ref name=\"ItRunsDoom3\"/>\n\n===Mods===\nThe ability for others to create custom levels and otherwise modify the game using WAD files turned out to be a popular aspect of ''Doom''. Gaining the first large [[mod (video games)|mod]]-making community, ''Doom'' affected the culture surrounding first-person shooters, and also the industry. Several future professional [[game designer]]s started their careers making ''Doom'' WADs as a hobby, among them [[Tim Willits]], who later became the lead designer at id Software.\n\nThe first [[level editor]]s appeared in early 1994, and additional tools have been created that allow most aspects of the game to be edited. Although the majority of WADs contain one or several custom levels mostly in the style of the original game, others implement new monsters and other resources, and heavily alter the gameplay; several popular movies, television series, other video games and other brands from popular culture have been turned into ''Doom'' WADs by fans, including ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball|Dragon Ball Z]]'', ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'', ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'', ''[[Batman]]'', and ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]''.<ref name=\"SonicDoom\"/> Some works, like the ''Theme Doom Patch'', combined enemies from several films, such as ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', and ''[[The Terminator]]''. Some add-on files were also made that changed the sounds made by the various characters and weapons.\n\nAround 1994 and 1995, WADs were primarily distributed online over [[bulletin board system]]s or sold in collections on compact discs in computer shops, sometimes bundled with editing guide books. [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] servers became the primary method in later years. A few WADs have been released commercially, including the ''[[Master Levels for Doom II]]'', which was released in 1995 along with ''Maximum Doom'', a CD containing 1,830 WADs that had been downloaded from the Internet. Several thousand WADs have been created in total: the ''idgames'' FTP archive contains over 18,000 files,<ref name=\"DoomWADFTP\"/> and this represents only a fraction of the complete output of ''Doom'' fans. Third-party programs were also written to handle the loading of various WADs, since the game is a [[DOS]] game and all commands had to be entered on the [[command line]] to run. A typical launcher would allow the player to select which files to load from a menu, making it much easier to start.

[[Intel]],<ref name=\"cgw199403\"/> [[Lotus Development]], and [[Carnegie Mellon University]] were among many organizations reported to form policies specifically disallowing ''Doom''-playing during work hours. At the [[Microsoft]] campus, ''Doom'' was by one account equal to a \"religious phenomenon\".<ref name=\"mastersofdoom\"/> Doom was #1 on ''Computer Gaming World''{{'}}s \"Playing Lately?\" survey for February 1994. One reader said that \"No other game even compares to the addictiveness of NetDoom with four devious players! ... The only game I've stayed up 72+ straight hours to play\", while another reported that \"Linking four people together for a game of Doom is the quickest way to destroy a productive, boring evening of work\".<ref name=\"cgw199404wh\"/>\n\n[[File:Billdoom.png|thumb|To promote [[Windows 95]], [[Bill Gates]], aware of the video game's popularity, showcased a video presentation while digitally superimposed into ''Doom'']]\nAlthough Petersen said ''Doom'' was \"nothing more than the computer equivalent of [[Whack-A-Mole]]\",<ref name=\"schuytema199408\" /> ''Doom'' received critical acclaim and was widely praised in the gaming press, broadly considered to be one of the most important and influential titles in gaming history. Upon release, ''[[GamesMaster]]'' gave it a 90% rating.<ref name=\"GR-PC\" /> ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' gave it five stars, praising the improvements over ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', the \"fast-moving [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[shoot 'em up]]\" gameplay, and network play.<ref name=\"Dragon203\" /> A common criticism of ''Doom'' was that it was not a true 3D game, since the game engine did not allow corridors and rooms to be stacked on top of one another ([[room-over-room]]), and instead relied on graphical trickery to make it appear that the player character and enemies were moving along differing elevations.<ref name=\"NotTrue3D\" />\n\n''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated in February 1994 that ''Wolfenstein 3D'' fans should \"look forward to a delight of insomnia\", and \"Since networking is supported, bring along a friend to share in the visceral delights\".<ref name=\"cgw199402\"/> A longer review in March 1994 said that ''Doom'' \"was worth the wait ... a wonderfully involved and engaging game\", and its technology \"a new benchmark\" for the gaming industry. The reviewer praised the \"simply ''dazzling''\" graphics\", and reported that \"DeathMatches may be the most intense gaming experience available today\". While criticizing the \"ho-hum endgame\" with a too-easy [[end boss]], he concluded that ''Doom'' \"is a virtuoso performance\".<ref name=\"walker199403\"/>\n\n''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' criticized the \"fairly simple\" gameplay but praised the graphics and levels. The review concluded: \"You\u2019lI be longing for something new in this game. If only you could talk to these creatures, then perhaps you could try and make friends with them, form alliances... Now, that would be interesting.\"<ref name=\"Edge\"/> The sentiment attracted widespread mockery, and \"if only you could talk to these creatures\" became a running joke in [[gamer culture]]; however, a 2016 piece in the ''[[International Business Times]]'' defended the review as anticipating the dialogue systems of games such as ''[[Skyrim]]'', ''[[Mass Effect]]'' and ''[[Undertale]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/doom-infamous-talk-monsters-review-was-right-side-history-1559763|title=Doom: Infamous \\'talk to the monsters\\' review was on the right side of history|date=2016-05-13|website=International Business Times UK|language=en|access-date=2019-07-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, ''[[PC Gamer UK]]'' named ''Doom'' the third best computer game of all time.

''[[PC Zone]]''{{'}}s David McCandless wrote that the game was played by \"an estimated six million people across the globe\",<ref name=\"gamesthatchanged\"/> while other sources estimate that 10\u201320 million people played ''Doom'' within 24 months of its launch.<ref name=\"wargames\"/>\n\n===Controversies===\n{{See also|List of banned video games}}\n[[File:Doom gibs.png|thumb|''Doom''{{'s}} intense level of graphic violence made the game highly controversial. This screenshot shows the effects of a rocket hitting a group of enemies.]]\n\n''Doom'' was notorious for its high levels of [[graphic violence]]<ref name=\"DoomViolence\"/> and [[Satanism|satanic]] imagery, which generated controversy from a broad range of groups. ''Doom'' for the Genesis 32X was among one of the first video games to be given an M for Mature rating from the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] due to its violent gore and nature.<ref name=\"DoomMature\"/> [[Yahoo! Games]] listed it as one of the top ten most controversial games of all time.<ref name=\"DoomYahoo\"/> It was criticized by religious organizations for its diabolic undertones and was dubbed a \"mass murder simulator\" by critic and [[Killology]] Research Group founder [[Dave Grossman (author)|David Grossman]].<ref name=\"DoomKillology\"/> ''Doom'' prompted fears that the then-emerging [[virtual reality]] technology could be used to simulate extremely realistic killing.\n\nThe game again sparked controversy in the United States when it was found that [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], who committed the [[Columbine High School massacre]] on April 20, 1999, were avid players of the game. While planning for the massacre, Harris said in his journal that the killing would be \"like playing ''Doom''\", and \"it'll be like the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|LA riots]], the [[Oklahoma City bombing|Oklahoma bombing]], [[World War II]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], ''[[Duke Nukem 3D|Duke Nukem]]'' and ''Doom'' all mixed together\", and that his shotgun was \"straight out of the game\".<ref name=\"DoomHighSchool\"/> A rumor spread afterwards that Harris had designed a ''Doom'' level that looked like the high school, populated with representations of Harris's classmates and teachers, and that Harris practiced for his role in the shootings by playing the level over and over. Although Harris did design ''Doom'' levels that were never affiliated with the official ''Doom'' release, which later became known as the '[[Doom modding#Miscellaneous|Harris levels]]', none have been found to be based on [[Columbine High School]] and 7 of which can be played today.<ref name=\"The Harris levels\"/>\n\nIn the release versions before 1.2-1.4, the game has been banned in [[Germany]] due to a [[swastika]] in E1M4. The ban was lifted after id Software changed the ''Swastika'', and said that \"it was the homage of ''Wolfenstein 3D''\".{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===''Doom'' franchise===\n{{main|Doom (franchise)}}\n\n''Doom'' has appeared in several forms in addition to video games, including a ''Doom'' comic book, four novels by [[Dafydd Ab Hugh]] and [[Brad Linaweaver]] (loosely based on events and locations in the games), a [[Doom: The Boardgame|''Doom'' board game]] and [[Doom (film)|a live-action film]] starring [[Karl Urban]] and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] released in 2005. The game's development and impact on popular culture is also the subject of the book ''[[Masters of Doom|Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture]]'' by [[David Kushner]].\n\nThe ''Doom'' series remained dormant between 1997 and 2000, when ''[[Doom 3]]'' was finally announced. A retelling of the original ''Doom'' using entirely new graphics technology and a slower paced survival horror approach, ''Doom 3'' was hyped to provide as large a leap in realism and interactivity as the original game and helped renew interest in the franchise when it was released in 2004, under the [[id Tech 4]] game engine.\n\nThe series again remained dormant for 10 years until a remake, simply titled [[Doom (2016 video game)|''Doom'']] and running on the new [[id Tech 6]], was announced with a beta access to players that had pre-ordered ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]''. The game held its closed alpha multiplayer testing in October 2015, as closed and open beta access ran during March to April 2016. Returning to the series' roots in fast-paced action and minimal storytelling, the full game eventually released worldwide on May 13, 2016. The project initially started as ''Doom 4'' in May 2008, set to be a remake of ''[[Doom II|Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'' and ditching the survival horror aspect of ''Doom 3''. Development completely restarted as id's Tim Willits remarked that ''Doom 4'' was \"lacking the personality of the long-running shooter franchise\".<ref name=\"mtv\"/>\n\n===Clones===\n{{Main|First-person shooter}}\n[[File:Doom clone vs first person shooter.png|thumb|The phrase \"[[Doom clone|''Doom'' clone]]\" was initially popular to describe the style of gameplay in ''Doom''-style games, but was gradually replaced by \"[[first-person shooter]]\" after 1996. By 1998, the phrase \"first-person shooter\" had firmly superseded \"''Doom'' clone\".]]\n''Doom'' was influential and dozens of new first-person shooter titles appeared following ''Doom''{{'s}} release, and they were often referred to as \"[[Doom clone|''Doom'' clones]]\" rather than \"first-person shooters\". The term \"''Doom'' clone\" was used to describe the style of gameplay in ''Doom''-style games. While the term was initially popular, it was, after 1996, gradually replaced by \"[[first-person shooter]]\", and the phrase \"first-person shooter\" had firmly superseded \"''Doom'' clone\" around 1998. Some of these were certainly \"[[Clone (computing)|clones]]\", hastily assembled and quickly forgotten, while others explored new grounds of the genre and were highly acclaimed. Many of the games closely imitated features in ''Doom'' such as the selection of weapons and cheat codes. ''Doom''{{'s}} principal rivals were [[3D Realms|Apogee]]'s ''[[Rise of the Triad]]'' and [[Looking Glass Studios]]' ''[[System Shock]]''. The popularity of ''[[Star Wars]]''-themed WADs is rumored to have been the factor that prompted [[LucasArts]] to create their first-person shooter ''[[Dark Forces]]''.<ref name=\"DoomClones\"/>\n\nThe ''Doom'' game engine was licensed by id Software to several other companies, who released their own games using the technology, including ''[[Heretic (video game)|Heretic]]'', ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic]]'', ''[[Strife (1996 video game)|Strife: Quest for the Sigil]]'', and ''[[Doom modding#Total conversions|Hacx: Twitch 'n Kill]]''. A ''Doom''-based game called ''[[Chex Quest]]'' was released in 1996 by [[Ralston Foods]] as a promotion to increase cereal sales,<ref name=\"DoomChex\"/> and the [[United States Marine Corps]] released ''[[Marine Doom]]''.\n\nWhen [[3D Realms]] released ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'' in 1996, a tongue-in-cheek science fiction shooter based on [[Ken Silverman]]'s technologically similar [[Build (game engine)|''Build'' engine]], id Software was nearly finished developing ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', its next-generation game, which mirrored ''Doom''{{'}}s success for much of the remainder of the 1990s and reduced interest in its predecessor (Wolfenstein 3D).\n\n===Community===\nIn addition to the thrilling nature of the single-player game, the [[deathmatch]] mode was an important factor in the game's popularity. ''Doom'' was not the first first-person shooter with a deathmatch mode; ''[[Maze War]]'', an FPS released in 1974, was running multiplayer deathmatch over [[ethernet]] on Xerox computers by 1977. The widespread distribution of PC systems and the violence in ''Doom'' made deathmatching particularly attractive. Two-player multiplayer was possible over a phone line by using a [[modem]], or by linking two PCs with a null-modem cable. Because of its widespread distribution, ''Doom'' hence became the game that introduced deathmatching to a large audience and was also the first game to use the term \"deathmatch\".<ref name=\"Deathmatchterm\"/>\n\nAlthough the popularity of the ''Doom'' games dropped with the release of more modern first-person shooters, the game still retains a strong fan base that continues to this day by playing competitively and creating WADs, and ''Doom''-related news is still tracked at multiple websites such as Doomworld. Interest in ''Doom'' was renewed in 1997, when the [[source code]] for the [[Doom engine|''Doom'' engine]] was released (it was also placed under the [[GNU General Public License]] on October 3, 1999). Fans then began [[porting]] the game to various operating systems, even to previously unsupported platforms such as the [[Dreamcast]]. As for the PC, over 50 different [[List of Doom source ports|''Doom'' source ports]] have been developed. New features such as [[OpenGL]] rendering and [[Scripting language|scripting]] allow WADs to alter the gameplay more radically.\n\nDevoted players have spent years creating [[speedrun]]s for ''Doom'', competing for the quickest completion times and sharing knowledge about routes through the levels and how to exploit [[software bug|bugs]] in the ''Doom'' engine for shortcuts. Achievements include the completion of both ''Doom'' and ''Doom II'' on the \"Ultra-Violence\" difficulty setting in less than 30&nbsp;minutes each. In addition, a few players have also managed to complete ''Doom II'' in a single run on the difficulty setting \"Nightmare!\", on which monsters are more aggressive, launch faster projectiles (or, in the case of the Pinky Demon, simply move faster), and respawn roughly 30&nbsp;seconds after they have been killed (level designer John Romero characterized the idea of such a run as \"[just having to be] impossible\").<ref name=\"DoomNightmare\"/> Movies of most of these runs are available from the COMPET-N website.<ref name=\"DoomCOMPET-N\"/>\n\nOnline co-op and deathmatch play are still continued on [[List of Doom source ports|fan created services]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- unused references -->\n<!-- <ref name=\"DoomRelease\">{{cite web
