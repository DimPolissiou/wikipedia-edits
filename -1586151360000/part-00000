It was the first to have stereo speakers, a trackpad, and [[Ethernet]] networking built-in.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.laptopmag.com/mobile-life/features/landmark-laptops.aspx?page=5|title=Landmark Laptops: The most important notebooks in computing history \u2013 Apple PowerBook 500 Series|website=Laptop Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627115438/http://www.laptopmag.com/mobile-life/features/landmark-laptops.aspx?page=5|archive-date=June 27, 2012|access-date=May 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIt was the first PowerBook series to use a [[Motorola 68040#Variants|Motorola 68LC040 CPU]] (simultaneous with [[PowerBook Duo|Duo 280]]) and be upgradeable to the [[PowerPC]] architecture via a swap-out CPU daughter card (with the PowerPC and 68040 upgrades for sale), use 9.5-inch Dual Scan passive color/B&W displays, 16-bit stereo sound with stereo speakers, have an expansion bay, PC Card capability, two battery bays (and a ten-minute sleep/clock battery, which allowed for main batteries to be swapped out while in sleep mode), full-size keyboard with F1\u2013F12 function keys, be able to sleep while connected to an external monitor and have a battery contact cover included on the actual batteries. It included a single serial port which could be to connect to a serial printer or a network via Apple's [[LocalTalk]]. In another first, it also included an [[Apple Attachment Unit Interface|AAUI]] port for connecting to [[Ethernet]] networks.\n\nThe 500 series was discontinued completely with the introduction of the ill-fated [[PowerBook 5300]]. The [[PowerBook 190]] was the ''de facto'' successor to the 500 and continued the only 68LC040 processor offering as the low end of the PowerPC-based PowerBook family.\n\nIn a survey taken in November 2000, ''Insanely Great Macintosh'' ranked the 540c No. 2 on its list of the all-time best PowerBook models made.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.insanely-great.com/features/112900.html|title=Top 10 Best PowerBooks of All Time|last=Davison|first=Remy|date=November 29, 2000|website=Insanely Great Mac|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060324140419/http://www.insanely-great.com/features/112900.html|archive-date=March 24, 2006|access-date=May 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe PowerBook 500 series was introduced on May 16, 1994, with the high-end active matrix LCD PowerBook 540c and 540, with the passive matrix 520c and 520 soon after. One of its marketing highlights was the promise of a PowerPC upgrade to its CPU and PC Card (PCMCIA) expansion. The introduction of this model came at the time of Apple's changeover to the new PowerPC chip from the 68k line of CPUs, and Apple's advertising and promise of the PowerPC was the cause of headaches to the company.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The strong demand for its ground-breaking design and Apple's incorrect market prediction that customers would wait for the fully PowerPC PowerBooks resulted in shortages early on.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/POWER-MAC-TOO-POPULAR-3150434.php|title=POWER MAC TOO POPULAR|date=March 15, 1995|website=[[San Francisco Examiner]]|accessdate=June 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn due course{{When|date=June 2016}} the 540 was dropped from the line, 8 MB of additional memory and the modem was offered installed from the factory, hard drive capacity was increased (from 160 and 240 to 320 and 500 MB), and the installed system upped from System 7.1.1 to 7.5. The PC Card Cage was also released, allowing Macintosh users to add [[PCMCIA]] capability to their laptops for the first time.\n\nIn 1995, Apple gave permission for Apple Japan to introduce an updated version, called the 550c, with a bigger display (10.4 inches), CPU with FPU (68040), bigger hard drive, and Japanese keyboard with black case. It was only sold in Japan and never received FCC certification.\n\nWith delays for the new PowerPC PowerBook 5300, demand for the PPC upgrade mounted, and [[Newer Technology]] began to market the upgrade before Apple did, although they had produced the upgrade modules for Apple first. What's more, they offered 117&nbsp;MHz versions over Apple's 100 (actually, 99) MHz offering. Soon thereafter,{{When|date=June 2016}} Newer Technology introduced a 167&nbsp;MHz model that outperformed the fastest [[PowerBook 5300]], the $6,800 5300ce, at a time when problems with that line became a real issue to Apple.\n\nAbout the time Apple introduced the [[PowerBook 1400]], Newer Technology introduced a 183&nbsp;MHz upgrade with 128 KB of L2 cache that kept it ahead of the power curve in performance. Newer Technology stated they could not produce more of the 183&nbsp;MHz upgrades because the supply of connectors was exhausted.\n\n== Impact on the industry ==\n\nThis laptop was the first in the industry to include:\n* 16-bit stereo sound @ 44.1&nbsp;kHz (typical was 8-bit mono @ 22&nbsp;kHz);\n* Trackpad\n* Stereo speakers (located in upper corners of screen);\n* Ethernet via [[Apple Attachment Unit Interface|AAUI]] (a transceiver was used to connect to either UTP or coaxial type wiring);\n* Non specialized internal expansion bay for connecting many types of devices ([[Processor Direct Slot|PDS]] connector in left battery bay);\n* \"Intelligent\" NiMH batteries (that is, had on-board circuitry to monitor health of battery);\n* CPU on a daughter card.\n\nAnd among Apple's PowerBook line the first to have:\n* 68LC040 (with Duo 280), or 68040 (in Japanese model) CPU standard;\n* PowerPC 603e CPU as an upgrade;\n* 9.5-inch displays;\n* 10.4\" display (550c in Japan);\n* Dual Scan passive color and B+W screens;\n* CPU on daughtercard (first in any Mac) (PowerPC and 68040 upgrades);\n* Expansion bay ([[Processor Direct Slot|PDS]] connector in left battery bay);\n* PC Card capability (PCMCIA) via module;\n* Two battery bays (and a 10-minute sleep/clock battery);\n* Full-size keyboard with function keys (F1\u2013F12);\n* Sleep while connected to external monitor;\n* Battery contact cover included on the batteries.\n\n==Engineering==\n\n===Variations across the range===\nAlthough the 500 \"Blackbird\" prototypes were black, only one of the five production models was completely black; that was the 550c, sold only in Japan. The 550c differed from the four two-tone grey models in a few other key respects as well, including a larger active-matrix color screen, a combined Roman/Kanji keyboard, and a full [[Motorola 68040|68040]] processor. The other models were all charcoal grey with darker grey trim, came with a variety of displays (active/passive matrix; color or greyscale), and used the [[68LC040]] processor (a low-cost variant without a [[math co-processor]]). The full-sized keyboard with 12 [[function key]]s, and [[640x480|640\u00d7480]] resolution display was consistent across the family.\n\n===Optional internal modem===\nThe modem was developed with [[Global Village (telecommunications)|Global Village]], and is a unique two-part design. The transceiver with the modem connector is installed in the back, and the modem itself is located next to the CPU daughter card.  It was a [[ITU-T V-Series Recommendations#Interfaces and voiceband modems|V.32 Terbo]], and had a top rate of 19.2&nbsp;kbit/s, but only with other V.32 Terbo modems as there was no official standard. Otherwise it would drop down to 14.4 kbit/s.\nDue to a bug with the new combined printer/modem port, the driver had to be upgraded to 2.5.5, and the Chooser was replaced in the GV install.\n\n==Expansion bay==\nThe 500 series of PowerBooks included the ability to use two batteries at the same time, allowing for 4 hours of battery life from two installed charged batteries.  However the left battery also had an internal PDS slot that allowed for custom modules to be installed.  Despite prototypes having been made, only two devices reached the market.\n\n===PCMCIA \"card cage\"===\nOne is the [[PCMCIA]] module. There were three versions; RevA, RevB and RevC. The RevC is the most useful as it can take 16bit WiFi cards, allowing the possibility to get a Powerbook 5xx connected online or in the home network using a technology that was developed after the Powerbook 5xxs were discontinued by Apple. The different revisions of the PCMCIA module were released by Apple to accommodate the developing PCMCIA standard. These modules are difficult to find, and the RevC module is in particular demand because it alone works with 16-bit [[WiFi]] cards. <br>\nPC Card (PCMCIA) cage, 16-bit, 2 Type I/II or 1 Type III cards, using a 68000 CPU to convert the PC Card protocol to PDS.\n\n===FPU co-processor===\nThe other is the FPU co-processor, to make up for the lack of one in the PowerBook's 68LC040 CPU.\nThe FPU module uses a 68882 FPU co-processor made by Sonnet.\n\n==Production==\nIn total, almost 600,000 PowerBook 500 series units were produced, compared to 300,000 [[PowerBook 5300]] units.\n\n== Models ==\n\n[[Image:PowerBook520c 550c.jpg|thumb|200px|PowerBook 520c and 550c]]\n[[Image:PowerBook520c.jpg|thumb|200px|An Apple PowerBook 520c]]\n\n{| class =\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" \n! \n! 520\n! 520c\n! 540\n! 540c\n! 550c\n|-\n!

It was the first to have stereo speakers, a trackpad, and [[Ethernet]] networking built-in.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.laptopmag.com/mobile-life/features/landmark-laptops.aspx?page=5|title=Landmark Laptops: The most important notebooks in computing history \u2013 Apple PowerBook 500 Series|website=Laptop Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627115438/http://www.laptopmag.com/mobile-life/features/landmark-laptops.aspx?page=5|archive-date=June 27, 2012|access-date=May 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIt was the first PowerBook series to use a [[Motorola 68040#Variants|Motorola 68LC040 CPU]] (simultaneous with [[PowerBook Duo|Duo 280]]) and be upgradeable to the [[PowerPC]] architecture via a swap-out CPU daughter card (with the PowerPC and 68040 upgrades for sale), use 9.5-inch Dual Scan passive color/B&W displays, 16-bit stereo sound with stereo speakers, have an expansion bay, PC Card capability, two battery bays (and a ten-minute sleep/clock battery, which allowed for main batteries to be swapped out while in sleep mode), full-size keyboard with F1\u2013F12 function keys, be able to sleep while connected to an external monitor and have a battery contact cover included on the actual batteries. It included a single serial port which could be to connect to a serial printer or a network via Apple's [[LocalTalk]]. In another first, it also included an [[Apple Attachment Unit Interface|AAUI]] port for connecting to [[Ethernet]] networks.\n\nThe 500 series was discontinued completely with the introduction of the ill-fated [[PowerBook 5300]]. The [[PowerBook 190]] was the ''de facto'' successor to the 500 and continued the only 68LC040 processor offering as the low end of the PowerPC-based PowerBook family.\n\nIn a survey taken in November 2000, ''Insanely Great Macintosh'' ranked the 540c No. 2 on its list of the all-time best PowerBook models made.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.insanely-great.com/features/112900.html|title=Top 10 Best PowerBooks of All Time|last=Davison|first=Remy|date=November 29, 2000|website=Insanely Great Mac|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060324140419/http://www.insanely-great.com/features/112900.html|archive-date=March 24, 2006|access-date=May 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe PowerBook 500 series was introduced on May 16, 1994, with the high-end active matrix LCD PowerBook 540c and 540, with the passive matrix 520c and 520 soon after. One of its marketing highlights was the promise of a PowerPC upgrade to its CPU and PC Card (PCMCIA) expansion. The introduction of this model came at the time of Apple's changeover to the new PowerPC chip from the 68k line of CPUs, and Apple's advertising and promise of the PowerPC was the cause of headaches to the company.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The strong demand for its ground-breaking design and Apple's incorrect market prediction that customers would wait for the fully PowerPC PowerBooks resulted in shortages early on.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/POWER-MAC-TOO-POPULAR-3150434.php|title=POWER MAC TOO POPULAR|date=March 15, 1995|website=[[San Francisco Examiner]]|accessdate=June 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn due course{{When|date=June 2016}} the 540 was dropped from the line, 8 MB of additional memory and the modem was offered installed from the factory, hard drive capacity was increased (from 160 and 240 to 320 and 500 MB), and the installed system upped from System 7.1.1 to 7.5. The PC Card Cage was also released, allowing Macintosh users to add [[PCMCIA]] capability to their laptops for the first time.\n\nIn 1995 Apple gave permission for Apple Japan to introduce an updated version, called the 550c, with a bigger display (10.4 inches), CPU with FPU (68040), bigger hard drive, and Japanese keyboard with black case. It was only sold in Japan, and never received FCC certification.\n\nWith delays in the new PowerPC PowerBook 5300, demand for the PPC upgrade mounted, and [[Newer Technology]] began to market the upgrade before Apple did, although they had produced the upgrade modules for Apple first. What's more, they offered 117&nbsp;MHz versions over Apple's 100 (actually, 99) MHz offering. Soon thereafter,{{When|date=June 2016}} Newer Technology introduced a 167&nbsp;MHz model that outperformed the fastest [[PowerBook 5300]], the $6,800 5300ce, at a time when problems with that line became a real issue to Apple.\n\nAbout the time Apple introduced the [[PowerBook 1400]], Newer Technology introduced a 183&nbsp;MHz upgrade with 128 KB of L2 cache that kept it ahead of the power curve in performance. Newer Technology stated they could not produce more of the 183&nbsp;MHz upgrades because the supply of connectors was exhausted.\n\n== Impact on the industry ==\n\nThis laptop was the first in the industry to include:\n* 16-bit stereo sound @ 44.1&nbsp;kHz (typical was 8-bit mono @ 22&nbsp;kHz);\n* Trackpad\n* Stereo speakers (located in upper corners of screen);\n* Ethernet via [[Apple Attachment Unit Interface|AAUI]] (a transceiver was used to connect to either UTP or coaxial type wiring);\n* Non specialized internal expansion bay for connecting many types of devices ([[Processor Direct Slot|PDS]] connector in left battery bay);\n* \"Intelligent\" NiMH batteries (that is, had on-board circuitry to monitor health of battery);\n* CPU on a daughter card.\n\nAnd among Apple's PowerBook line the first to have:\n* 68LC040 (with Duo 280), or 68040 (in Japanese model) CPU standard;\n* PowerPC 603e CPU as an upgrade;\n* 9.5-inch displays;\n* 10.4\" display (550c in Japan);\n* Dual Scan passive color and B+W screens;\n* CPU on daughtercard (first in any Mac) (PowerPC and 68040 upgrades);\n* Expansion bay ([[Processor Direct Slot|PDS]] connector in left battery bay);\n* PC Card capability (PCMCIA) via module;\n* Two battery bays (and a 10-minute sleep/clock battery);\n* Full-size keyboard with function keys (F1\u2013F12);\n* Sleep while connected to external monitor;\n* Battery contact cover included on the batteries.\n\n==Engineering==\n\n===Variations across the range===\nAlthough the 500 \"Blackbird\" prototypes were black, only one of the five production models was completely black; that was the 550c, sold only in Japan. The 550c differed from the four two-tone grey models in a few other key respects as well, including a larger active-matrix color screen, a combined Roman/Kanji keyboard, and a full [[Motorola 68040|68040]] processor. The other models were all charcoal grey with darker grey trim, came with a variety of displays (active/passive matrix; color or greyscale), and used the [[68LC040]] processor (a low-cost variant without a [[math co-processor]]). The full-sized keyboard with 12 [[function key]]s, and [[640x480|640\u00d7480]] resolution display was consistent across the family.\n\n===Optional internal modem===\nThe modem was developed with [[Global Village (telecommunications)|Global Village]], and is a unique two-part design. The transceiver with the modem connector is installed in the back, and the modem itself is located next to the CPU daughter card.  It was a [[ITU-T V-Series Recommendations#Interfaces and voiceband modems|V.32 Terbo]], and had a top rate of 19.2&nbsp;kbit/s, but only with other V.32 Terbo modems as there was no official standard. Otherwise it would drop down to 14.4 kbit/s.\nDue to a bug with the new combined printer/modem port, the driver had to be upgraded to 2.5.5, and the Chooser was replaced in the GV install.\n\n==Expansion bay==\nThe 500 series of PowerBooks included the ability to use two batteries at the same time, allowing for 4 hours of battery life from two installed charged batteries.  However the left battery also had an internal PDS slot that allowed for custom modules to be installed.  Despite prototypes having been made, only two devices reached the market.\n\n===PCMCIA \"card cage\"===\nOne is the [[PCMCIA]] module. There were three versions; RevA, RevB and RevC. The RevC is the most useful as it can take 16bit WiFi cards, allowing the possibility to get a Powerbook 5xx connected online or in the home network using a technology that was developed after the Powerbook 5xxs were discontinued by Apple. The different revisions of the PCMCIA module were released by Apple to accommodate the developing PCMCIA standard. These modules are difficult to find, and the RevC module is in particular demand because it alone works with 16-bit [[WiFi]] cards. <br>\nPC Card (PCMCIA) cage, 16-bit, 2 Type I/II or 1 Type III cards, using a 68000 CPU to convert the PC Card protocol to PDS.\n\n===FPU co-processor===\nThe other is the FPU co-processor, to make up for the lack of one in the PowerBook's 68LC040 CPU.\nThe FPU module uses a 68882 FPU co-processor made by Sonnet.\n\n==Production==\nIn total, almost 600,000 PowerBook 500 series units were produced, compared to 300,000 [[PowerBook 5300]] units.\n\n== Models ==\n\n[[Image:PowerBook520c 550c.jpg|thumb|200px|PowerBook 520c and 550c]]\n[[Image:PowerBook520c.jpg|thumb|200px|An Apple PowerBook 520c]]\n\n{| class =\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" \n! \n! 520\n! 520c\n! 540\n! 540c\n! 550c\n|-\n!

In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ '''Other on-screen personnel (Part 2)'''\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=4|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=7|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, Liv Morgan faced Natalya.

In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ '''Other on-screen personnel (Part 2)'''\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=4|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=7|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, Liv Morgan faced Natalya.

The Los Angeles bid relied on a majority of existing venues; other venues that are already under construction were planned regardless of the Games. [[Banc of California Stadium]], which opened in 2018 as the home of [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[Los Angeles FC]], will host [[association football|football (soccer)]] and several events in [[Sport of athletics|athletics]].

The torch would then travel on to Inglewood, where the main opening ceremony (including the parade of nations and other traditional protocol) would be held. Other entertainment would be provided to spectators at the Coliseum, including a simulcast of the main portion of the ceremony. Finally, the historic Olympic cauldron at the Coliseum would symbolically be re-ignited upon lighting of the Olympic cauldron in Inglewood. Sixteen days later, the venues for the closing ceremony would be organized in reverse, with an opening segment in Inglewood and the formal protocol (including extinguishing of the cauldron) at the Coliseum.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-la2024-olympic-ceremonies-20170116-story.html|title=L.A. organizers propose linked, simultaneous Olympic ceremonies for Coliseum, Inglewood stadium|last=Wharton|first=David|date=16 January 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=25 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcasting rights==\nIn the United States, the 2028 Games will be broadcast by [[NBC Olympic broadcasts|NBCUniversal properties]], as part of long-term agreements with the IOC through 2032.<ref name=\"USA NBC 2032\">{{cite web|title=IOC awards Olympic Games broadcast rights to NBCUniversal through to 2032|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-awards-olympic-games-broadcast-rights-to-nbcuniversal-through-to-2032|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=27 August 2017|date=7 May 2014}}</ref> The [[Universal Studios Lot]] is planned to be the site of the [[International Broadcast Centre]] for the Games.<ref name=\"NBC_IPC\"/> In addition, NBCUniversal and the organizing committee will coordinate sponsorship sales for the Games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/la-2028-nbcuniversal-olympic-paralympic-sponsorship-sales|title=LA 2028 and NBCUniversal partner for Olympic sponsorship sales |website=SportsPro |access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref>\n\n*{{flag|Brazil}} \u2013 [[Grupo Globo]]<ref>{{cite news|title=IOC reaches agreement for broadcast rights in Brazil with Grupo Globo through to 2032|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-reaches-agreement-for-broadcast-rights-in-brazil-with-grupo-globo-through-to-2032/247620|accessdate=11 December 2015|work=International Olympic Committee|publisher=Olympic.org|date=10 December 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213030204/http://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-reaches-agreement-for-broadcast-rights-in-brazil-with-grupo-globo-through-to-2032/247620|archivedate=13 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n*{{flag|Japan}} \u2013 [[Japan Consortium]]<ref>{{cite news|title=IOC awards broadcast rights to the Japan Consortium through to 2032|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-awards-broadcast-rights-to-the-japan-consortium-through-to-2032|accessdate=14 November 2019|work=IOC|publisher=Olympic.org|date=14 November 2019}}</ref>\n*{{flag|North Korea}} \u2013 [[JTBC]]<ref name=Korea>{{cite news|title=IOC awards 2026-2032 Olympic Games broadcast rights in Korea to JTBC|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-awards-2026-2032-olympic-games-broadcast-rights-in-korea-to-jtbc|accessdate=4 June 2019|work=International Olympic Committee|publisher=Olympic.org|date=4 June 2019}}</ref>\n*{{flag|South Korea}} \u2013 [[JTBC]]<ref name=Korea/>\n*{{flag|United States}} \u2013 [[NBC Olympic broadcasts|NBCUniversal]]<ref name=\"USA NBC 2032\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States|California|Greater Los Angeles}}\n{{IOC seealso|games=2028 Summer Olympics }}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://la28.org LA 2028]\n*[https://www.olympic.org/la-2028 LA 2028 (IOC)]\n\n=== Candidature files ===\n\n* [http://la24-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pdf/LA2024-canditature-part1_english.pdf Stage 1: Vision, Games Concept and Strategy]\n* [http://la24-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pdf/LA2024-canditature-part2_english.pdf Stage 2: Governance, Legal and Venue Funding]\n** [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1356850/LA2024Budget.pdf Budget released Dec. 2nd, 2016]\n* [https://la24-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pdf/LA2024-canditature-part3_english.pdf Stage 3: Games Delivery, Experience and Venue Legacy]\n** [https://web.archive.org/web/20170514231518/http://www.alternativasostenibile.it/sites/default/files/LA2024_Sustainability%20Vision%20Booklet.pdf Sustainability Vision]\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-bef|before=''[[2024 Summer Olympics|Paris]]''}}\n{{s-ttl|title=''Summer Olympic Games'' <br/> [[Los Angeles]]|years=''XXXIV Olympiad'' (2028)}}\n{{s-aft|after=''[[2032 Summer Olympics|TBD]]''}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Bids for the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics}}\n{{Olympic Games}}\n\n\n[[Category:2028 Summer Olympics| ]]\n[[Category:2028 in multi-sport events|Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:2028 in American sports|Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Summer Olympics in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Scheduled multi-sport events|Summer Olympics 2028]]\n[[Category:Sports competitions in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Summer Olympics by year]]\n", "name_user": "220.124.67.86", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2028_Summer_Olympics"}
