Nextcloud is [[free and open-source]], which means that anyone is allowed to install and operate it on their own [[private server]] devices. \n\nNextcloud application functionally is similar to [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Office 365]] or [[Google Drive]], but can be used on home-local computers or for off-premises file storage hosting. Office functionality is limited to x86/x64 based servers as OnlyOffice does not support ARM processors.\nIn contrast to proprietary services the [[open architecture]] enables users to have full control of their data.\n\nThe original [[ownCloud]] developer [[Frank Karlitschek]] [[Fork (software development)|forked]] ownCloud and created Nextcloud, which continues to be actively developed by Karlitschek and other members of the original ownCloud team.\n\nOn January 17, 2020, version 18 was presented in Berlin under the product name ''Nextcloud Hub''. For the first time, an [[Office suite|office package]] (here [[OnlyOffice]]) was directly integrated here and Nextcloud announced as its goal direct competition with [[Office 365|Microsoft Office 365]] and [[Google Docs]]. Furthermore, a partnership with [[1&1 Ionos|Ionos]] was announced at this date. \n\n== Features ==\n\nNextcloud files are stored in conventional directory structures, accessible via [[WebDAV]] if necessary. User files are encrypted during transit and optionally at rest. Nextcloud can synchronise with local [[Client (computing)|clients]] running [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] (Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10), [[macOS]] (10.6 or later), or various [[Linux]] distributions.\n\nNextcloud permits user and group administration (via [[OpenID]] or [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]]). Content can be shared by defining granular read/write permissions between users and groups. Alternatively, Nextcloud users can create public [[URL]]s when sharing files. [[Logfile|Logging]] of file-related actions, as well as disallowing access based on file access rules is also available.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nextcloud.com/blog/file-access-control-a-firewall-for-your-private-files-in-nextcloud/|title=File Access Control \u2013 A firewall for your private files in Nextcloud|accessdate=22 September 2016|date=25 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nNextcloud has planned new features such as [[Website monitoring|monitoring]] capabilities, [[full-text search]] and [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] authentication, as well as audio/[[video conferencing]], expanded [[Federation (information technology)|federation]] and smaller [[user interface]] improvements.<ref>{{cite news |title = Nextcloud adds security and scalability to its private cloud offering |url = http://www.zdnet.com/article/nextcloud-adds-security-and-scalability-to-its-private-cloud-offering/ | author = Steven J.

Developers can offer their extensions to other users for installation via a manufacturer-operated platform. This platform communicates with the Nextcloud instances via an [[open protocol]].  The App Store<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apps.nextcloud.com/|title=Nextcloud App Store}}</ref> contains over 200 extensions. With the help of these extensions, many functionalities can be added, including: \n\n* calendars ([[CalDAV]])\n* contacts ([[CardDAV]])\n* streaming media ([[Ampache]])\n* browser-based [[text editor]]\n* [[Bookmark (World Wide Web)|bookmarking]] service\n* [[URL shortening]] suite\n* gallery\n* [[RSS]] feed reader\n* document viewer tools from within Nextcloud\n* connection to [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Google Drive]] and [[Amazon S3]]\n*Web analytics (Use of [[Matomo (software)]])\n*Integration of [[Content management system|Content management systems]] e.g. Pico CMS\n*Viewer for [[Weather forecasting]]\n*Viewer for [[DICOM]]\n*Viewer for [[Map|Maps]]\n*Managing of [[Cooking recipe|Cooking recipes]]\n\n== Architecture ==\nIn order for desktop machines to synchronize files with their Nextcloud server, desktop clients are available for PCs running [[Windows]], [[macOS]], [[FreeBSD]] or [[Linux]]. Mobile clients exist for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices. Files and other data (such as calendars, contacts or bookmarks) can also be accessed, managed, and uploaded using a web browser without any additional software. Any updates to the file system are pushed to all computers and mobile devices connected to a user's account.\n\nThe Nextcloud server is written in the [[PHP]] and [[JavaScript]] [[scripting language]]s. For [[virtual file system|remote access]], it employs [[SabreDAV|sabre/dav]], an open-source [[WebDAV]] server.<ref>{{cite web|title=ownCloud and sabre/dav|url=https://owncloud.org/blog/owncloud-and-sabredav/|work=owncloud.org|accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> Nextcloud is designed to work with several [[database management system]]s, including [[SQLite]], [[MariaDB]], [[MySQL]], [[Oracle Database]], and [[PostgreSQL]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/12/admin_manual/configuration_database/linux_database_configuration.html|title=Database Configuration - Nextcloud 12 Server Administration Manual 12 documentation}}</ref>\n\nWith Nextcloud 12, a new architecture was developed with the name Global Scale, with the goal of scaling to hundreds of millions of users. It splits users over separate nodes and introduces components to manage the interaction between them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nextcloud announces Global Scale architecture as part of Nextcloud 12|url=https://nextcloud.com/blog/nextcloud-announces-global-scale-architecture-as-part-of-nextcloud-12/|work=nextcloud.com|accessdate=14 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Nextcloud Box ==\nIn September 2016, Nextcloud, in cooperation with [[Western Digital Labs]] and [[Canonical (company)|Canonical]] (the company behind [[Ubuntu]]), released the Nextcloud Box.

Who owns ownCloud itself? And what matters more, short term money or long term responsibility and growth?\"<ref name=\"karlitschek-leaves-owncloud\"/> There have been no official statements about the reason for the fork.

Following American law, we are forced to close the doors of ownCloud, Inc. with immediate effect and terminate the contracts of 8 employees.\". ownCloud Inc. accused Karlitschek of poaching developers, while Nextcloud developers such as Arthur Schiwon stated that he \"decided to quit because not everything in the ownCloud Inc. company world evolved as I imagined\".<ref name=\"what-we-can-learn-from-ownclouds-collapse\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/article/3079866/open-source-tools/what-we-can-learn-from-ownclouds-collapse.html|title=What we can learn from ownCloud's collapse|author=Swapnil Bhartiya|publisher=[[CIO magazine|CIO.com]]|date=6 June 2016|accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref>  ownCloud GmbH continued operations, secured financing from new investors and took over the business of the ownCloud Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://owncloud.com/owncloud-secures-financing-expands-management-team/|title=ownCloud Secures Financing and Expands its Management Team - ownCloud|date=14 July 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Differences to ownCloud ==\n\nWhile Nextcloud was originally a fork of the ownCloud project, there are now many differences.

Nextcloud is [[free and open-source]], which means that anyone is allowed to install and operate it on their own [[private server]] devices. \n\nNextcloud application functionally is similar to [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Office 365]] or [[Google Drive]], but can be used on home-local computers or for off-premises file storage hosting. Office functionality is limited to x86/x64 based servers as OnlyOffice does not support ARM processors.\nIn contrast to proprietary services the [[open architecture]] enables users to have full control of their data.\n\nThe original [[ownCloud]] developer [[Frank Karlitschek]] [[Fork (software development)|forked]] ownCloud and created Nextcloud, which continues to be actively developed by Karlitschek and other members of the original ownCloud team.\n\nOn January 17, 2020, version 18 was presented in Berlin under the product name ''Nextcloud Hub''. For the first time, an [[Office suite|office package]] (here [[OnlyOffice]]) was directly integrated here and Nextcloud announced as its goal direct competition with [[Office 365|Microsoft Office 365]] and [[Google Docs]]. Furthermore, a partnership with [[1&1 Ionos|Ionos]] was announced at this date. \n\n== Features ==\n\nNextcloud files are stored in conventional directory structures, accessible via [[WebDAV]] if necessary. User files are encrypted during transit and optionally at rest. Nextcloud can synchronise with local [[Client (computing)|clients]] running [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] (Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10), [[macOS]] (10.6 or later), or various [[Linux]] distributions.\n\nNextcloud permits user and group administration (via [[OpenID]] or [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]]). Content can be shared by defining granular read/write permissions between users and groups. Alternatively, Nextcloud users can create public [[URL]]s when sharing files. [[Logfile|Logging]] of file-related actions, as well as disallowing access based on file access rules is also available.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nextcloud.com/blog/file-access-control-a-firewall-for-your-private-files-in-nextcloud/|title=File Access Control \u2013 A firewall for your private files in Nextcloud|accessdate=22 September 2016|date=25 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nNextcloud has planned new features such as [[Website monitoring|monitoring]] capabilities, [[full-text search]] and [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] authentication, as well as audio/[[video conferencing]], expanded [[Federation (information technology)|federation]] and smaller [[user interface]] improvements.<ref>{{cite news |title = Nextcloud adds security and scalability to its private cloud offering |url = http://www.zdnet.com/article/nextcloud-adds-security-and-scalability-to-its-private-cloud-offering/ | author = Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols | agency = ZDNet | date = 14 December 2016 | accessdate = 19 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nSince the software is [[Modular programming|modular]], it can be extended with [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]] to implement extra functionality. Developers can offer their extensions to other users for installation via a manufacturer-operated platform. This platform communicates with the Nextcloud instances via an [[open protocol]].  The App Store<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apps.nextcloud.com/|title=Nextcloud App Store}}</ref> contains over 200 extensions. With the help of these extensions, many functionalities can be added, including: \n\n* calendars ([[CalDAV]])\n* contacts ([[CardDAV]])\n* streaming media ([[Ampache]])\n* browser-based [[text editor]]\n* [[Bookmark (World Wide Web)|bookmarking]] service\n* [[URL shortening]] suite\n* gallery\n* [[RSS]] feed reader\n* document viewer tools from within Nextcloud\n* connection to [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Google Drive]] and [[Amazon S3]]\n*Web analytics (Use of [[Matomo (software)]])\n*Integration of [[Content management system|Content management systems]] e.g. Pico CMS\n*Viewer for [[Weather forecasting]]\n*Viewer for [[DICOM]]\n*Viewer for [[Map|Maps]]\n*Managing of [[Cooking recipe|Cooking recipes]]\n\n== Architecture ==\nIn order for desktop machines to synchronize files with their Nextcloud server, desktop clients are available for PCs running [[Windows]], [[macOS]], [[FreeBSD]] or [[Linux]]. Mobile clients exist for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices. Files and other data (such as calendars, contacts or bookmarks) can also be accessed, managed, and uploaded using a web browser without any additional software. Any updates to the file system are pushed to all computers and mobile devices connected to a user's account.\n\nThe Nextcloud server is written in the [[PHP]] and [[JavaScript]] [[scripting language]]s. For [[virtual file system|remote access]], it employs [[SabreDAV|sabre/dav]], an open-source [[WebDAV]] server.<ref>{{cite web|title=ownCloud and sabre/dav|url=https://owncloud.org/blog/owncloud-and-sabredav/|work=owncloud.org|accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> Nextcloud is designed to work with several [[database management system]]s, including [[SQLite]], [[MariaDB]], [[MySQL]], [[Oracle Database]], and [[PostgreSQL]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/12/admin_manual/configuration_database/linux_database_configuration.html|title=Database Configuration - Nextcloud 12 Server Administration Manual 12 documentation}}</ref>\n\nWith Nextcloud 12, a new architecture was developed with the name Global Scale, with the goal of scaling to hundreds of millions of users. It splits users over separate nodes and introduces components to manage the interaction between them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nextcloud announces Global Scale architecture as part of Nextcloud 12|url=https://nextcloud.com/blog/nextcloud-announces-global-scale-architecture-as-part-of-nextcloud-12/|work=nextcloud.com|accessdate=14 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Nextcloud Box ==\nIn September 2016, Nextcloud, in cooperation with [[Western Digital Labs]] and [[Canonical (company)|Canonical]] (the company behind [[Ubuntu]]), released the Nextcloud Box.

Who owns ownCloud itself? And what matters more, short term money or long term responsibility and growth?\"<ref name=\"karlitschek-leaves-owncloud\"/> There have been no official statements about the reason for the fork.

Following American law, we are forced to close the doors of ownCloud, Inc. with immediate effect and terminate the contracts of 8 employees.\". ownCloud Inc. accused Karlitschek of poaching developers, while Nextcloud developers such as Arthur Schiwon stated that he \"decided to quit because not everything in the ownCloud Inc. company world evolved as I imagined\".<ref name=\"what-we-can-learn-from-ownclouds-collapse\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/article/3079866/open-source-tools/what-we-can-learn-from-ownclouds-collapse.html|title=What we can learn from ownCloud's collapse|author=Swapnil Bhartiya|publisher=[[CIO magazine|CIO.com]]|date=6 June 2016|accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref>  ownCloud GmbH continued operations, secured financing from new investors and took over the business of the ownCloud Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://owncloud.com/owncloud-secures-financing-expands-management-team/|title=ownCloud Secures Financing and Expands its Management Team - ownCloud|date=14 July 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Differences to ownCloud ==\n\nWhile Nextcloud was originally a fork of the ownCloud project, there are now many differences.

For example, in the cartoon \"[[Snow Business]]\",<ref>{{cite web |title=Excerpt of \"Song of the Marines\" |url= http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x816o_song-of-the-marines_news |website=Daily Motion}}</ref> when Granny entered a room containing Tweety and [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester]] she said: \"Here I am, boys!\", whereas a 1952 cartoon was entitled ''[[Ain't She Tweet|Ain't '''She''' Tweet]]'' [emphasis added]. Also, his species is ambiguous; although originally and often portrayed as a young [[Domestic canary|canary]], he is also frequently called a rare and valuable \"tweety bird\" as a plot device, and once called \"the only living specimen\". Nevertheless, the [[The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries#Opening song|title song]] of ''The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries'' directly states that the bird is a canary. His shape more closely suggests that of a ''baby'' bird, which is what he was during his early appearances (although the \"baby bird\" aspect has been used in a few later cartoons as a plot device). The yellow feathers were added but otherwise he retained the baby-bird shape.\n\nIn his early appearances in [[Bob Clampett]] cartoons, Tweety is a very aggressive character who tries anything to foil his foe, even kicking his enemy when he is down. One of his most notable malicious moments is in the cartoon ''Birdy and the Beast''. A cat chases Tweety by flying until he remembers that cats cannot fly, causing him to fall. Tweety says sympathetically, \"Awww, the poor kitty cat! He faw down and go (''in a loud, tough, masculine voice'') BOOM!!\" and then grins mischievously. A similar use of that voice is in ''A Tale Of Two Kitties'' when Tweety, wearing an [[Air Raid Precautions#Wardens|air raid warden]]'s helmet, suddenly yells, \"Turn out those lights!\" Tweety's aggressive nature was toned down when [[Friz Freleng]] started directing the series, with the character turning into a more cutesy bird, usually going about his business, and doing little to thwart Sylvester's ill-conceived plots, allowing them to simply collapse on their own; he became even less aggressive when [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] was introduced, but occasionally Tweety still showed a malicious side.\n\n==Creation by Bob Clampett==\n[[Image:ataleoftwokitties restored.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Tweety's debut in ''[[A Tale of Two Kitties]]'']]\n[[Bob Clampett]] created the character that would become Tweety in the 1942 short ''[[A Tale of Two Kitties]]'', pitting him against two hungry cats named [[Babbit and Catstello]] (based on the famous comedians [[Abbott and Costello]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Beck |first1=Jerry |last2=Friedwald |first2=Will |title=Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies: A Complete Illustrated Guide to the Warner Bros. Cartoons |date=1989 |publisher=Henry Holt and Co |isbn=0-8050-0894-2 |page=135}}</ref> On the original model sheet, Tweety was named '''Orson''' which was based on the model sheets in the early 40s (which was also the name of a bird character from an earlier Clampett cartoon ''[[Wacky Blackout]]'').\n\nTweety was created not as a domestic canary, but as a generic (and wild) baby bird in an outdoors nest: naked (pink), jowly, and also far more aggressive and saucy, as opposed to the later, more well-known version of him as a less hot-tempered (but still somewhat ornery) yellow canary. In the documentary ''[[Bugs Bunny: Superstar]]'', animator Clampett stated, in a ''[[sotto voce]]'' \"aside\" to the audience, that Tweety had been based \"on my own naked baby picture\". Clampett did two more shorts with the \"naked genius\", as a [[Jimmy Durante]]-ish cat once called him in ''[[A Gruesome Twosome]]''. The second Tweety short, ''[[Birdy and the Beast]]'', finally bestowed the baby bird with his new name, and gave him his blue eyes.\n\nMany of [[Mel Blanc]]'s characters are known for speech impediments. One of Tweety's most noticeable is that /s/, /k/, and /g/ are changed to /t/, /d/, or (final s) /\u03b8/; for example, \"pussy cat\" comes out as \"putty tat\", later rendered \"puddy tat\", and \"sweetie pie\" comes out as \"tweetie pie\", hence his name. He also has trouble with [[liquid consonant]]s: as with [[Elmer Fudd]], /l/ and /r/ come out as /w/. In ''[[Canary Row]]'' and ''[[Putty Tat Trouble]]'', he begins the cartoon by singing a song about himself, \"I'm a tweet wittow biwd in a giwded cage; Tweety'th my name but I don't know my age, I don't have to wuwy and dat is dat; I'm tafe in hewe fwom dat ol' putty tat.\" (Translation: \"I'm a sweet little bird in a gilded cage...\") Aside from this speech challenge, Tweety's voice is that of [[Bugs Bunny]]'s, done a speed up only (if ''[[The Old Grey Hare]]'', which depicts Bugs as an infant, is any indication of that); the only difference is that Bugs doesn't have trouble pronouncing /s/, /k/ and /g/ as mentioned above.\n\n==Freleng takes over==\nClampett began work on a short that would pit Tweety against a then-unnamed, lisping black and white cat created by [[Friz Freleng]] in 1945. However, Clampett left the studio before going into full production on the short (which had a storyboard produced, where it was titled \"Fat Rat and the Stupid Cat\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/embed/lGuFHxRZGfo?start=953|title=Evolution of SYLVESTER & TWEETY Over 81 Years (1939-2020) Explained|last=|first=|date=Mar 3, 2020|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>), and Freleng took on the project. Freleng toned Tweety down and gave him a cuter appearance, including large blue eyes and yellow feathers. Clampett mentions in ''Bugs Bunny: Superstar'' that the feathers were added to satisfy censors who objected to the naked bird. The first short to team Tweety and the cat, later named [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester]], was 1947's ''[[Tweetie Pie]]'', which won Warner Bros its first [[Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons)]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture |volume=5 |edition=2nd |last=Riggs |first=Thomas |publisher=St. James Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-55862-847-2 |location=Detroit |pages=178\u2013179}}</ref>\n\nSylvester and Tweety proved to be one of the most notable pairings in animation history. Most of their cartoons followed a standard formula:\n\n* The hungry Sylvester wanting to eat the bird, but some major obstacle stands in his way \u2013 usually [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] or her bulldog [[Hector the Bulldog|Hector]] (or occasionally, numerous bulldogs, or another cat who also wants to eat Tweety).\n* Tweety saying his signature lines \"I tawt I taw a puddy tat!\" and \"I did! I did taw a puddy tat!\" (Originally \"I did! I taw a puddy tat!\", but the extra \"did\" got inserted somehow). Eventually, someone must have commented on the grammar of \"...did taw...\"; in later cartoons, Tweety says \"I did! I did tee a puddy tat!\".\n* Sylvester spending the entire film using progressively more elaborate schemes or devices to capture his meal, similar to [[Wile E. Coyote]] in his ongoing efforts to catch the [[Road Runner (Looney Tunes)|Road Runner]], and [[Tom Cat|Tom]]'s attempts to catch [[Jerry Mouse|Jerry]]. Of course, each of his tricks fail, either due to their flaws or, more often than not, because of intervention by either [[Hector the Bulldog]] or an indignant [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] (voiced by [[Bea Benaderet]] and later [[June Foray]]), or after Tweety steers the enemy toward them or another device (such as off the ledge of a tall building or an oncoming train).\n\nIn a few of the cartoons, Sylvester does manage to briefly eat Tweety up with a gulp. However, either Granny or another character makes him spit Tweety out right away. Sylvester was also briefly eaten by Hector the Bulldog, and forced by Granny to spit him out. This occurred during the Christmas special episode, and as a punishment, both Sylvester and Hector were tied up with their mouths gagged shut.\n\nIn 1951, Mel Blanc (with [[Billy May]]'s orchestra) had a hit single with \"[[I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat (song)|I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat]]\", a song performed in character by Tweety and featuring Sylvester. In the lyrics Sylvester sings \"I'd like to eat that Sweetie Pie when he leaves his cage\", implying that Tweety's name is actually Sweetie Pie, altered in its pronunciation by Tweety's [[speech impediment]]. Sylvester, who has his own speech issues involving the sounds /s/ and /p/, slobbers the \"S\" in \"Sweetie Pie\", just as he would the /s/ sounds in his own name. Later the same name was applied to the young, pink female canary in the [[List of Tiny Toon Adventures characters#Sweetie Pie|''Tiny Toon Adventures'']] animated TV series of the early 1990s.\n\nFrom 1945 until the original Warner Bros. Cartoons studio closed, Freleng had almost exclusive use of Tweety at the Warner cartoon studio (much like [[Yosemite Sam]]), with the exception of a brief cameo in ''No Barking'' in 1954, directed by Chuck Jones (that year, Freleng used [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]], a Jones character, for the only time in his career and the only time in a Tweety short, ''[[Dog Pounded]]'').\n\n==Later appearances==\n\nTweety had a small part in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', making [[Eddie Valiant]] ([[Bob Hoskins]]) fall from a [[flag pole]] by playing \"[[This Little Piggy]]\" with Valiant's fingers and releasing his grip. The scene is essentially a re-creation of a gag from ''A Tale of Two Kitties'', with Valiant replacing Catstello as Tweety's victim.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Tweety also starred in the animated TV series ''[[The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries]]'',<ref name=\":0\" /> in which Granny ran a detective agency with the assistance of Tweety, [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester]] and Hector. Tweety has the starring role. The storyline carries into the 2000 direct-to-video feature-length animated film ''[[Tweety's High-Flying Adventure]]''. Tweety's prototype, Orson, also made an appearance in the series.\n\nTweety also appears in ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' as the mentor of Sweetie Pie, and one of the faculty at Acme Looniversity.\n\nIn the 1995 cartoon short ''[[Carrotblanca]]'', a parody/homage to ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', Tweety appeared as \"Usmarte\", a parody of the character Ugarte played by [[Peter Lorre]] in the original film. In several sequences, Tweety was speaking and laughing in character like Peter Lorre. He also does the [[Looney Tunes]] ending instead of [[Porky Pig]] or [[Bugs Bunny]]. This is also notable for being a rare instance where Tweety is playing a villain character.\n\nIn 1996, Tweety appeared in the feature film, ''[[Space Jam]],'' with legendary basketball player [[Michael Jordan]].<ref name=\":0\" /> In the film, Tweety was voiced by Bob Bergen.<ref>{{Citation|title=Space Jam (1996)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117705/fullcredits|accessdate=2018-02-02}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, a younger version of Tweety appeared on ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'', thus coming full circle from his earliest appearances.\n\nIn 2010 Tweety was featured, with his [[Looney Tunes]] co-stars, in [[Cartoon Network]]'s series ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]].''<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/20/movies/20looney.html|title=For Looney Tunes, a Big Left Turn at Albuquerque|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|date=2010-05-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> He is voiced by [[Jeff Bergman]]. He appeared in the episode \"Ridiculous Journey\", where he and Sylvester work together to avoid getting eaten by Taz. He had been revealed to have fought in World War II alongside a young Granny. Sylvester also asked him how old he was, to which Tweety replied, \"I'll never tell.\" Sylvester then asked if Tweety would at least tell him if he (Tweety) was a boy or a girl. Tweety whispered into his ear and Sylvester had a surprised expression and said \"Huh, I was wrong.\"\n\nTweety recently appeared as a recurring character in ''[[New Looney Tunes]]'', where he is once again voiced by [[Bob Bergen]] and has been reverted to the more violent and aggressive personality that Bob Clampett originally gave him.\n\n==Merchandise==\nTweety and Sylvester have been used to endorse products such as [[Miracle Whip]] dressing and [[MCI Communications]] long distance.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1998, the [[United States Post Office]] honored Tweety and Sylvester with a 32-cent postage stamp.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mysticstamp.com/Products/United-States/3205/USA/|title=1998 32c Sylvester &amp; Tweety Imperf Sheet|website=www.mysticstamp.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-02}}</ref> Tweety also appears in products produced by Warner Brothers Studios.\n\n==Modern art==\nBritish artist [[Banksy]]'s 2008 New York art installation ''[[The Village Pet Store and Charcoal Grill]]'' features \"Tweety\", an [[animatronic]] sculpture of an aged and molting version of the character.<ref name=\"CO\">{{cite news |url= https://adage.com/article/creativity-news/banksy-fake-meat-invade-village/131613 |title= Banksy and fake meat invade the Village |last= Patel |first= Kunur |last2= Beer |first2= Jeff |date= 2008-10-09 |work= Creativity Online |publisher= Ad Age |access-date= 2008-10-11 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081012192256/http://creativity-online.com/?action=news:article&newsId=131613&sectionName=ad_critic_news |archive-date= 2008-10-12 }}</ref>\n\n==Comic books==\nWestern Publications produced a comic book about Tweety and Sylvester entitled ''Tweety and Sylvester'', first in [[Dell Comics]] ''[[Four Color]]'' series #406, 489, and 524, then in their own title from [[Dell Comics]] (#4\u201337, 1954\u201362), then later from [[Gold Key Comics]] (#1\u2013102, 1963\u201372).\n\n==Tweety's Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography==\n\n===Supervision: Bob Clampett===\n*''[[A Tale of Two Kitties]]'' (1942)\n\n===Direction: Bob Clampett===\n*''[[Birdy and the Beast]]'' (1944)\n*''[[A Gruesome Twosome]]'' (1945)\n\n===Directed by Friz Freleng===\n*''[[Tweetie Pie]]'' (1947)\n*''[[I Taw a Putty Tat]]'' (1948)\n*''[[Bad Ol' Putty Tat]]'' (1949)\n*''[[Home Tweet Home]]'' (1950)\n*''[[All a Bir-r-r-d]]'' (1950)\n*''[[Canary Row]]'' (1950)\n*''[[Putty Tat Trouble]]'' (1951)\n*''[[Room and Bird]]'' (1951)\n*''[[Tweety's S.O.S.]]'' (1951)\n*''[[Tweet Tweet Tweety]]'' (1951)\n*''[[Gift Wrapped (film)|Gift Wrapped]]'' (1952)\n*''[[Ain't She Tweet]]'' (1952)\n*''[[A Bird in a Guilty Cage]]'' (1952)\n*''[[Snow Business]]'' (1953)\n*''[[Fowl Weather]]'' (1953)\n*''[[Tom Tom Tomcat]]'' (1953)\n*''[[A Street Cat Named Sylvester]]'' (1953)\n*''[[Catty Cornered]]'' (1953)\n*''[[Dog Pounded]]'' (1954)\n*''[[Muzzle Tough]]'' (1954)\n*''[[Satan's Waitin']]'' (1954)\n*''[[Sandy Claws]]'' (1955)\n*''[[Tweety's Circus]]'' (1955)\n*''[[Red Riding Hoodwinked]]'' (1955)\n*''[[Heir-Conditioned]]'' (1955) \u2013 cameo appearance\n*''[[Tweet and Sour]]'' (1956)\n*''[[Tree Cornered Tweety]]'' (1956)\n*''[[Tugboat Granny]]'' (1956)\n*''[[Tweet Zoo]]'' (1957)\n*''[[Tweety and the Beanstalk]]'' (1957)\n*''[[Birds Anonymous]]'' (1957)\n*''[[Greedy for Tweety]]'' (1957)\n*''[[A Pizza Tweety Pie]]'' (1958)\n*''[[A Bird in a Bonnet]]'' (1958)\n*''[[Trick or Tweet]]'' (1959)\n*''[[Tweet and Lovely]]'' (1959)\n*''Tweet Dreams'' (1959)\n*''[[Hyde and Go Tweet]]'' (1960)\n*''[[Trip For Tat]]'' (1960)\n*''[[The Rebel Without Claws]]'' (1961)\n\n====Co-directed by [[Hawley Pratt]]====\n*''[[The Last Hungry Cat]]'' (1961)\n*''[[The Jet Cage]]'' (1962)\n\n===Directed by Gerry Chiniquy===\n*''[[Hawaiian Aye Aye]]'' (1964)-MM\n\n===Directed by Chuck Jones===\n*''No Barking'' (1954) \u2013 cameo appearance-MM\n\n===Post-Golden Age of American animation===\n*''[[Bugs Bunny's Looney Christmas Tales]]'' (1979), voiced by [[Mel Blanc]]\n*''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (1988), voiced by Mel Blanc\n*''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' (1990), voiced by [[Jeff Bergman]] and [[Bob Bergen]]\n*''[[Carrotblanca]]'' (1995), voiced by [[Bob Bergen]]\n*''[[The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries]]'' (1995), voiced by [[Joe Alaskey]]\n*''Superior Duck'' (1996), voiced by [[Eric Goldberg (animator)|Eric Goldberg]] (cameo appearance)\n*''[[Space Jam]]'' (1996), voiced by [[Bob Bergen]]\n*''[[Tweety's High-Flying Adventure]]'' (2000), voiced by [[Joe Alaskey]]\n*''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'' (2001), voiced by [[Samuel Vincent]]\n*''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'' (2003), voiced by [[Eric Goldberg (animator)|Eric Goldberg]]\n*''Museum Scream'' (2004), voiced by [[Billy West]]\n*''[[Bah, Humduck!

For example, in the cartoon \"[[Snow Business]]\",<ref>{{cite web |title=Excerpt of \"Song of the Marines\" |url= http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x816o_song-of-the-marines_news |website=Daily Motion}}</ref> when Granny entered a room containing Tweety and [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester]] she said: \"Here I am, boys!\", whereas a 1952 cartoon was entitled ''[[Ain't She Tweet|Ain't '''She''' Tweet]]'' [emphasis added]. Also, his species is ambiguous; although originally and often portrayed as a young [[Domestic canary|canary]], he is also frequently called a rare and valuable \"tweety bird\" as a plot device, and once called \"the only living specimen\". Nevertheless, the [[The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries#Opening song|title song]] of ''The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries'' directly states that the bird is a canary. His shape more closely suggests that of a ''baby'' bird, which is what he was during his early appearances (although the \"baby bird\" aspect has been used in a few later cartoons as a plot device). The yellow feathers were added but otherwise he retained the baby-bird shape.\n\nIn his early appearances in [[Bob Clampett]] cartoons, Tweety is a very aggressive character who tries anything to foil his foe, even kicking his enemy when he is down. One of his most notable malicious moments is in the cartoon ''Birdy and the Beast''. A cat chases Tweety by flying until he remembers that cats cannot fly, causing him to fall. Tweety says sympathetically, \"Awww, the poor kitty cat! He faw down and go (''in a loud, tough, masculine voice'') BOOM!!\" and then grins mischievously. A similar use of that voice is in ''A Tale Of Two Kitties'' when Tweety, wearing an [[Air Raid Precautions#Wardens|air raid warden]]'s helmet, suddenly yells, \"Turn out those lights!\" Tweety's aggressive nature was toned down when [[Friz Freleng]] started directing the series, with the character turning into a more cutesy bird, usually going about his business, and doing little to thwart Sylvester's ill-conceived plots, allowing them to simply collapse on their own; he became even less aggressive when [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] was introduced, but occasionally Tweety still showed a malicious side.\n\n==Creation by Bob Clampett==\n[[Image:ataleoftwokitties restored.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Tweety's debut in ''[[A Tale of Two Kitties]]'']]\n[[Bob Clampett]] created the character that would become Tweety in the 1942 short ''[[A Tale of Two Kitties]]'', pitting him against two hungry cats named [[Babbit and Catstello]] (based on the famous comedians [[Abbott and Costello]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Beck |first1=Jerry |last2=Friedwald |first2=Will |title=Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies: A Complete Illustrated Guide to the Warner Bros. Cartoons |date=1989 |publisher=Henry Holt and Co |isbn=0-8050-0894-2 |page=135}}</ref> On the original model sheet, Tweety was named '''Orson''' which was based on the model sheets in the early 40s (which was also the name of a bird character from an earlier Clampett cartoon ''[[Wacky Blackout]]'').\n\nTweety was created not as a domestic canary, but as a generic (and wild) baby bird in an outdoors nest: naked (pink), jowly, and also far more aggressive and saucy, as opposed to the later, more well-known version of him as a less hot-tempered (but still somewhat ornery) yellow canary. In the documentary ''[[Bugs Bunny: Superstar]]'', animator Clampett stated, in a ''[[sotto voce]]'' \"aside\" to the audience, that Tweety had been based \"on my own naked baby picture\". Clampett did two more shorts with the \"naked genius\", as a [[Jimmy Durante]]-ish cat once called him in ''[[A Gruesome Twosome]]''. The second Tweety short, ''[[Birdy and the Beast]]'', finally bestowed the baby bird with his new name, and gave him his blue eyes.\n\nMany of [[Mel Blanc]]'s characters are known for speech impediments. One of Tweety's most noticeable is that /s/, /k/, and /g/ are changed to /t/, /d/, or (final s) /\u03b8/; for example, \"pussy cat\" comes out as \"putty tat\", later rendered \"puddy tat\", and \"sweetie pie\" comes out as \"tweetie pie\", hence his name. He also has trouble with [[liquid consonant]]s: as with [[Elmer Fudd]], /l/ and /r/ come out as /w/. In ''[[Canary Row]]'' and ''[[Putty Tat Trouble]]'', he begins the cartoon by singing a song about himself, \"I'm a tweet wittow biwd in a giwded cage; Tweety'th my name but I don't know my age, I don't have to wuwy and dat is dat; I'm tafe in hewe fwom dat ol' putty tat.\" (Translation: \"I'm a sweet little bird in a gilded cage...\") Aside from this speech challenge, Tweety's voice is that of [[Bugs Bunny]]'s, done a speed up only (if ''[[The Old Grey Hare]]'', which depicts Bugs as an infant, is any indication of that); the only difference is that Bugs doesn't have trouble pronouncing /s/, /k/ and /g/ as mentioned above.\n\n==Freleng takes over==\nClampett began work on a short that would pit Tweety against a then-unnamed, lisping black and white cat created by [[Friz Freleng]] in 1945. However, Clampett left the studio before going into full production on the short (which had a storyboard produced, where it was titled \"Fat Rat and the Stupid Cat\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/embed/lGuFHxRZGfo?start=953|title=Evolution of SYLVESTER & TWEETY Over 81 Years (1939-2020) Explained|last=|first=|date=Mar 3, 2020|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>), and Freleng took on the project. Freleng toned Tweety down and gave him a cuter appearance, including large blue eyes and yellow feathers. Clampett mentions in ''Bugs Bunny: Superstar'' that the feathers were added to satisfy censors who objected to the naked bird. The first short to team Tweety and the cat, later named [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester]], was 1947's ''[[Tweetie Pie]]'', which won Warner Bros its first [[Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons)]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture |volume=5 |edition=2nd |last=Riggs |first=Thomas |publisher=St. James Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-55862-847-2 |location=Detroit |pages=178\u2013179}}</ref>\n\nSylvester and Tweety proved to be one of the most notable pairings in animation history. Most of their cartoons followed a standard formula:\n\n* The hungry Sylvester wanting to eat the bird, but some major obstacle stands in his way \u2013 usually [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] or her bulldog [[Hector the Bulldog|Hector]] (or occasionally, numerous bulldogs, or another cat who also wants to eat Tweety).\n* Tweety saying his signature lines \"I tawt I taw a puddy tat!\" and \"I did! I did taw a puddy tat!\" (Originally \"I did! I taw a puddy tat!\", but the extra \"did\" got inserted somehow). Eventually, someone must have commented on the grammar of \"...did taw...\"; in later cartoons, Tweety says \"I did! I did tee a puddy tat!\".\n* Sylvester spending the entire film using progressively more elaborate schemes or devices to capture his meal, similar to [[Wile E. Coyote]] in his ongoing efforts to catch the [[Road Runner (Looney Tunes)|Road Runner]], and [[Tom Cat|Tom]]'s attempts to catch [[Jerry Mouse|Jerry]]. Of course, each of his tricks fail, either due to their flaws or, more often than not, because of intervention by either [[Hector the Bulldog]] or an indignant [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] (voiced by [[Bea Benaderet]] and later [[June Foray]]), or after Tweety steers the enemy toward them or another device (such as off the ledge of a tall building or an oncoming train).\n\nIn a few of the cartoons, Sylvester does manage to briefly eat Tweety up with a gulp. However, either Granny or another character makes him spit Tweety out right away. Sylvester was also briefly eaten by Hector the Bulldog, and forced by Granny to spit him out. This occurred during the Christmas special episode, and as a punishment, both Sylvester and Hector were tied up with their mouths gagged shut.\n\nIn 1951, Mel Blanc (with [[Billy May]]'s orchestra) had a hit single with \"[[I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat (song)|I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat]]\", a song performed in character by Tweety and featuring Sylvester. In the lyrics Sylvester sings \"I'd like to eat that Sweetie Pie when he leaves his cage\", implying that Tweety's name is actually Sweetie Pie, altered in its pronunciation by Tweety's [[speech impediment]]. Sylvester, who has his own speech issues involving the sounds /s/ and /p/, slobbers the \"S\" in \"Sweetie Pie\", just as he would the /s/ sounds in his own name. Later the same name was applied to the young, pink female canary in the [[List of Tiny Toon Adventures characters#Sweetie Pie|''Tiny Toon Adventures'']] animated TV series of the early 1990s.\n\nFrom 1945 until the original Warner Bros. Cartoons studio closed, Freleng had almost exclusive use of Tweety at the Warner cartoon studio (much like [[Yosemite Sam]]), with the exception of a brief cameo in ''No Barking'' in 1954, directed by Chuck Jones (that year, Freleng used [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]], a Jones character, for the only time in his career and the only time in a Tweety short, ''[[Dog Pounded]]'').\n\n==Later appearances==\n\nTweety had a small part in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', making [[Eddie Valiant]] ([[Bob Hoskins]]) fall from a [[flag pole]] by playing \"[[This Little Piggy]]\" with Valiant's fingers and releasing his grip. The scene is essentially a re-creation of a gag from ''A Tale of Two Kitties'', with Valiant replacing Catstello as Tweety's victim.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Tweety also starred in the animated TV series ''[[The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries]]'',<ref name=\":0\" /> in which Granny ran a detective agency with the assistance of Tweety, [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester]] and Hector. Tweety has the starring role. The storyline carries into the 2000 direct-to-video feature-length animated film ''[[Tweety's High-Flying Adventure]]''. Tweety's prototype, Orson, also made an appearance in the series.\n\nTweety also appears in ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' as the mentor of Sweetie Pie, and one of the faculty at Acme Looniversity.\n\nIn the 1995 cartoon short ''[[Carrotblanca]]'', a parody/homage to ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', Tweety appeared as \"Usmarte\", a parody of the character Ugarte played by [[Peter Lorre]] in the original film. In several sequences, Tweety was speaking and laughing in character like Peter Lorre. He also does the [[Looney Tunes]] ending instead of [[Porky Pig]] or [[Bugs Bunny]]. This is also notable for being a rare instance where Tweety is playing a villain character.\n\nIn 1996, Tweety appeared in the feature film, ''[[Space Jam]],'' with legendary basketball player [[Michael Jordan]].<ref name=\":0\" /> In the film, Tweety was voiced by Bob Bergen.<ref>{{Citation|title=Space Jam (1996)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117705/fullcredits|accessdate=2018-02-02}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, a younger version of Tweety appeared on ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'', thus coming full circle from his earliest appearances.\n\nIn 2010 Tweety was featured, with his [[Looney Tunes]] co-stars, in [[Cartoon Network]]'s series ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]].''<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/20/movies/20looney.html|title=For Looney Tunes, a Big Left Turn at Albuquerque|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|date=2010-05-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> He is voiced by [[Jeff Bergman]]. He appeared in the episode \"Ridiculous Journey\", where he and Sylvester work together to avoid getting eaten by Taz. He had been revealed to have fought in World War II alongside a young Granny. Sylvester also asked him how old he was, to which Tweety replied, \"I'll never tell.\" Sylvester then asked if Tweety would at least tell him if he (Tweety) was a boy or a girl.

The song has been reworked into \"Give me Yop\" (Gimme Yop me mamma, Yop me mamma, Yop for when de mornin' come) and the teenagers, who are seen asleep against a toilet-roll holder or propped up in the bathroom, are demanding that their mothers give them the drink.<ref>[McCann relaunches Yoplait Yop drink http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/207362/]</ref><ref>[The clip: Yop - Me Mama https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCpeIKVIHbY]</ref>\n\n=== Availability ===\nYop comes within and between countries in different bottle sizes.

The campaign targeted teenagers and the spot featured teenagers with strong Jamaican accents singing a version of the [[Eddy Grant]] song, [[Gimme Hope Jo'anna]], in their sleep. The song has been reworked into \"Give me Yop\" (Gimme Yop me mamma, Yop me mamma, Yop for when de mornin' come) and the teenagers, who are seen asleep against a toilet-roll holder or propped up in the bathroom, are demanding that their mothers give them the drink.<ref>[McCann relaunches Yoplait Yop drink http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/207362/]</ref><ref>[The clip: Yop - Me Mama https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCpeIKVIHbY]</ref>\n\n=== Availability ===\nYop comes within and between countries in different bottle sizes.

The bridge was designed by [[John Whitton]] and built from 1883 to 1884 by J. S. Bennett, with iron work supplied by [[Westwood, Baillie]], [[England]]. It is also known as the '''Rail Bridge over Murray River, Albury-Wodonga''' and the '''Albury Lattice Railway Bridge''' and '''Murray River Underbridge'''. The bridge is owned by [[RailCorp]], and maintained by the [[Australian Rail Track Corporation]] as part of its lease of the line. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1020>{{cite NSW SHR|5045524|Albury rail bridge over Murray River|hr=01020|accessdate=28 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge is located {{convert|648.465|km}} from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney Central railway station]].\n\n== History ==\nDuring the 20-year period between 1873 and 1893 there was a massive programme of public works in New South Wales, particularly in expanding the road and rail networks. During this period and despite strong economic conditions, the respective chief engineers, for roads (William C Bennett) and for railways ([[John Whitton]]), adopted economic construction methods and materials, for example by using local materials where possible. Consequently, an enormous amount of hardwood timber was used for bridge works; mostly timber beam and timber truss bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1020/>\n\nHowever, long span bridges were required for major river crossings, making timber bridge construction unsuitable at many locations.

The bridge was designed by [[John Whitton]] and built from 1883 to 1884 by J. S. Bennett, with iron work supplied by [[Westwood, Baillie]], [[England]]. It is also known as the '''Rail Bridge over Murray River, Albury-Wodonga''' and the '''Albury Lattice Railway Bridge''' and '''Murray River Underbridge'''. The bridge is owned by [[RailCorp]], and maintained by the [[Australian Rail Track Corporation]] as part of its lease of the line. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1020>{{cite NSW SHR|5045524|Albury rail bridge over Murray River|hr=01020|accessdate=28 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge is located {{convert|648.465|km}} from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney Central railway station]].\n\n== History ==\nDuring the 20-year period between 1873 and 1893 there was a massive programme of public works in New South Wales, particularly in expanding the road and rail networks. During this period and despite strong economic conditions, the respective chief engineers, for roads (William C Bennett) and for railways ([[John Whitton]]), adopted economic construction methods and materials, for example by using local materials where possible. Consequently, an enormous amount of hardwood timber was used for bridge works; mostly timber beam and timber truss bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1020/>\n\nHowever, long span bridges were required for major river crossings, making timber bridge construction unsuitable at many locations. Metal bridge construction was adopted for larger bridges at major river crossings with metal supplied from England. John Whitton adopted the use of wrought iron lattice truss bridges, with twelve such bridges built for the NSW Railways in the late 19th century and 24 wrought iron bridges built for roads.<ref name=nswshr-1020/>\n\nMany of these bridges (for road and rail) remain extant in NSW, including railway lattice bridges at: [[Bathurst Rail Bridge over Macquarie River|Bathurst]] ([[Macquarie River]], 1876), [[Wellington, New South Wales|Wellington]] (Macquarie River, 1881), [[Woolbrook, New South Wales|Woolbrook]] (MacDonald River, 1882), [[Dubbo rail bridge over Macquarie River|Dubbo]] (Macquarie River, 1884), [[Cowra]] ([[Lachlan River]], 1887), [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]] ([[Peel River (New South Wales)|Peel River]], 1882), Albury (Murray River, 1884), and [[Narrandera]] ([[Murrumbidgee River]], 1885).<ref name=nswshr-1020/>\n\nThe Albury Murray River Bridge consists of two {{convert|48.463|m|ft|0|adj=on}} wrought iron lattice girder trusses, a steel opening transom top, and cast iron piers.
