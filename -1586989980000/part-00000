The basic N1 launch vehicle had three stages, which were to carry the L3 lunar payload into low Earth orbit with two cosmonauts. The L3 contained one stage for [[trans-lunar injection]]; another stage used for mid-course corrections, [[lunar orbit]] insertion, and the first part of the descent to the lunar surface; a single-pilot [[LK (spacecraft)|LK Lander]] spacecraft; and a two-pilot [[Soyuz 7K-LOK]] lunar orbital spacecraft for return to Earth.\n\nN1-L3 was underfunded and rushed, starting development in October 1965, almost four years after the Saturn V. The project was badly derailed by the death of its chief designer [[Sergei Korolev]] in 1966. Each of the four attempts to launch an N1 failed, with the second attempt resulting in the vehicle crashing back onto its launch pad shortly after liftoff and causing one of the [[List of the largest artificial non-nuclear explosions#Rank order of largest conventional explosions/detonations by magnitude|largest artificial non-nuclear explosions]] in human history. The N1 program was suspended in 1974, and officially canceled in 1976.

The N-1 was the largest, with a {{convert|50|MT|lb|adj=on}} payload for military [[space station]]s and a later crewed flyby of Venus and Mars in the [[TMK]] (Russian acronym for Heavy Interplanetary Spacecraft) with the development of a [[nuclear thermal rocket|nuclear engine]] upper stage.<ref name=\"sovlun\">Lindroos, Marcus.

Accessed: 4 October 2011.</ref> The N2 was a smaller [[ICBM]] intended to compete with [[Vladimir Chelomei]]'s contemporary [[UR-200]] proposal, and the N3 would replace Korolev's widely used [[R-7 rocket]]. At this point the N-series was under study only, with no hardware built.\n\nThe two other main rocket designers and design bureaus presented competing proposals at the time of the original N-series proposal. [[Vladimir Chelomei]], Korolev's rival, presented his [[Universal Rocket]] (UR) series. The UR rockets used a common lower stage in various clustered configurations to meet a wide variety of payload requirements. [[Mikhail Yangel]], perhaps the most successful of the three but with little political power, presented the small [[R-26 (missile)|R-26]] intended to replace the [[R-16 (missile)|R-16]], the much larger [[R-36 (missile)|R-36]] ICBM, and the SK-100, a space launcher based on a huge cluster of R-16's. In the end the military planners selected Chelomei's [[UR-100]] as the new \"light\" ICBM, and Yangel's R-36 for the \"heavy\" role. They saw no need for any of the larger dedicated launchers, but also gave Korolev funding to develop a [[Molniya (rocket)|Molniya]] (8K78) adaptation of the R-7.\n\nIn March 1961, during a meeting at [[Baikonur]], designers discussed the N1 design, along with the competing [[Valentin Glushko|Glushko]] R-20 design.\n\n===Early Soviet lunar concepts===\n[[File:N1.stl|thumb|260x260px|Static [[3D model]] of the rocket]]\nIn May 1961, the US announced the goal of landing a person on the moon by 1970. During the same month, the ''On Reconsideration of the Plans for Space Vehicles in the Direction of Defense Purposes'' report set the first test launch of the N1 rocket for 1965. In June, Korolev was given a small amount of funding to start N1 development between 1961 and 1963. At the same time, Korolev proposed a lunar mission based on the new [[Soyuz spacecraft]] using an [[Earth orbit rendezvous]] profile. Several [[Soyuz (rocket)|Soyuz]] rocket launches would be used to build up a complete Moon mission package, including one for the Soyuz spacecraft, another for the lunar lander, and a few with cislunar engines and fuel. This approach, driven by the limited capacity of the Soyuz rocket, meant that a rapid launch rate would be required to assemble the complex before any of the components ran out of consumables on-orbit. Korolev subsequently proposed that the N1 be enlarged to allow a single launch lunar landing.\n\nMeanwhile, Chelomei's [[OKB-52]] proposed an alternate mission with much lower risk. Instead of a crewed landing, Chelomei proposed a series of circumlunar missions to beat the US to the vicinity of the moon. He also proposed a new booster for the mission, clustering three of his existing UR-200s (known as the [[SS-10]] in the west) to produce a single larger booster, the UR-500. These plans were dropped when Glushko offered Chelomei the RD-270, which allowed the construction of the [[UR-500]] in a much simpler \"monoblock\" design. He also proposed adapting an existing spacecraft design for the circumlunar mission, the single-cosmonaut [[LK-1]]. Chelomei felt that improvements in early UR-500/LK-1 missions would allow the spacecraft to be adapted for two cosmonauts.\n\nThe Strategic Missile Forces of the Soviet military was reluctant to support a politically motivated project with little military utility, but both Korolev and Chelomei pushed for a lunar mission. Between 1961 and 1964, Chelomei's less aggressive proposal was accepted, and development of his UR-500 and the LK-1 were given a relatively high priority.\n\n===Lunar N1 development starts===\n[[Valentin Glushko]], who then held a near-monopoly on rocket engine design in the Soviet Union, proposed the [[RD-270]] engine using [[unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine]] (UDMH) and [[nitrogen tetroxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) propellants to power the newly enlarged N1 design. These [[hypergolic]] propellants ignite on contact, reducing the complexity of the engine, and were widely used in Glushko's existing engines on various [[ICBM]]s. The full flow [[staged combustion cycle]] RD-270 was in testing before program cancellation, achieving a higher [[specific impulse]] than the [[gas-generator cycle]] [[Rocketdyne F-1]] despite the use of UDMH/N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> propellants with lower potential impulse. The F-1 engine was five years into its development at the time and still experiencing combustion stability problems.\n\nGlushko pointed out that the US [[Titan II GLV]] had successfully flown crew with similar hypergolic propellants. Korolev felt that the toxic nature of the fuels and their exhaust presented a safety risk for crewed space flight, and that kerosene/LOX was a better solution. The disagreement between Korolev and Glushko over the question of fuels ultimately became a major issue that hampered progress.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wade |first1=Mark |title=Korolev, Chelomei, and Glushko - A Work In Progress |url=http://www.friends-partners.org/mwade/articles/korgress.htm |website=astronautix |publisher=astronautix.com |accessdate=19 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Lindroos |first1=Marcus |title=THE SOVIET MANNED LUNAR PROGRAM |url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/science-technology-and-society/sts-471j-engineering-apollo-the-moon-project-as-a-complex-system-spring-2007/readings/soviet_mand_lunr.pdf |website=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |publisher=MIT OpenCourseWare |accessdate=19 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nPersonal issues between the two played a role, with Korolev holding Glushko responsible for his incarceration at the [[Kolyma#Emergence of the Gulag camps|Kolyma Gulag]] in the 1930s and Glushko considering Korolev to be cavalier and autocratic towards things outside his competence. The difference of opinions led to a falling out between Korolev and Glushko. In 1962, a committee was appointed to resolve the dispute and agreed with Korolev. Glushko refused outright to work on LOX/kerosene engines, and with Korolev in general. Korolev eventually gave up and decided to enlist the help of [[Nikolai Dmitriyevich Kuznetsov|Nikolai Kuznetsov]], the [[Kuznetsov Design Bureau|OKB-276]] [[jet engine]] designer, while Glushko teamed up with other rocket designers to build the very successful [[Proton (rocket family)|Proton]], [[Zenit (rocket family)|Zenit]], and [[Energia]] rockets.\n\nKuznetsov, who had limited experience in rocket design, responded with the [[NK-15]], a fairly small engine which would be delivered in several versions tuned to different altitudes. To achieve the required amount of thrust, it was proposed that 30 NK-15s would be used in a clustered configuration. An outer ring of 24 engines and an inner ring of six engines would be separated by an air gap, with airflow supplied via inlets near the top of the booster. The air would be mixed with the exhaust in order to provide some degree of [[air-augmented rocket|thrust augmentation]], as well as engine cooling. The arrangement of 30 rocket engine nozzles on the N1's first stage could have been an attempt at creating a crude version of a toroidal [[aerospike engine]] system; more conventional aerospike engines were also studied.\n\n===N1-L3 lunar complex===\n[[File:KH-8 N1.jpg|thumb|N1 imaged by US [[KH-8 Gambit]] reconnaissance satellite, 19 September 1968]]\nKorolev proposed a larger N1 combined with the new L3 lunar package based on the [[Soyuz 7K-L3]]. The L3 combined rocket stages, the modified [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]], and the new [[LK (spacecraft)|LK lunar lander]] were to be launched by a single N1 to conduct a lunar landing. Chelomei responded with a clustered UR-500-derived vehicle, topped with the L1 spacecraft already under development, and a lander developed by his design bureau. Korolev's proposal was selected as the winner in August 1964, but Chelomei was told to continue with his circumlunar UR-500/L1 work.\n\nWhen Khrushchev was overthrown later in 1964, infighting between the two teams started anew. In October 1965, the Soviet government ordered a compromise; the circumlunar mission would be launched on Chelomei's UR-500 using Korolev's Soyuz spacecraft in place of their own [[Zond program|Zond]] (\"probe\") design, aiming for a launch in 1967, the 50th anniversary of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]]. Korolev, meanwhile, would continue with his original N1-L3 proposal. Korolev had clearly won the argument, but work on the L1 continued anyway, as well as the Zond.\n\nIn 1966, the US [[Project Gemini]] had reversed the Soviet lead in human space exploration, Korolev initially lobbied for a manned circumlunar mission, which was rejected. He was eventually successful on 3 August 1964 when the [[Central Committee]] finally passed a resolution titled \"On work involving the study of the Moon and outer space\" with the objective of landing a cosmonaut on the Moon in the 1967 to 68 time frame, ahead of the American Apollo missions.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lindroos |first1=Marcus |title=THE SOVIET MANNED LUNAR PROGRAM |url=https://fas.org/spp/eprint/lindroos_moon1.htm |website=FAS |publisher=Federation of American Scientists (FAS) |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter Korolev died in 1966 due to complications after minor surgery, work on N1-L3 was taken over by his deputy, [[Vasily Mishin]]. Mishin did not have Korolev's political astuteness or influence and was reputed to be a heavy drinker. These problems contributed to the eventual cancellation of the N1 and the lunar mission as a whole, as did four consecutive launch failures with no successes.\n\n===N1 vehicle serial numbers===\n* N1 1L \u2013 full scale dynamic test model, each stage was individually dynamically tested; the full N1 stack was only tested at 1/4 scale.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vick|first1=Charles P.|last2=Berman|first2=Sara D.|last3=Lindborg|first3=Christina|title=The First Photograph of N1-L3 FSLT & TV (1M1) on the Pad.

The program was terminated in 1974 when Mishin was replaced by Glushko. Two N1Fs were being readied for launch at the time, but these plans were canceled.\n\nThe two flight-ready N1Fs were scrapped and their remains could still be found around Baikonur years later used as shelters and storage sheds. The boosters were deliberately broken up in an effort to cover up the USSR's failed Moon attempts, which was publicly stated to be a paper project in order to fool the US into thinking there was a race going on. This cover story lasted until ''[[glasnost]]'', when the remaining hardware was seen publicly on display.\n\n===Aftermath and engines===\nThe program was followed by the \"Vulkan\" concept for a huge launch vehicle using [[Syntin]]/[[LOX]] propellants, later replaced by [[LH2]]/[[LOX]] on the 2nd and 3rd stages. \"Vulkan\" was superseded by the [[Energia]]/[[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] program in 1976.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Petrovitch|first1=Vassili|title=Vulkan Description|url=http://www.buran-energia.com/energia/vulcain-vulkan-desc.php|website=Buran-Energia.com|publisher=2006-2015 by Vassili Petrovitch|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Wade|first1=Mark|title=Vulkan|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/vulkan.htm|website=Astronautix.com|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=31 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331005227/http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/vulkan.htm|archivedate=31 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nAbout 150 of the upgraded engines for the N1F escaped destruction. Although the rocket as a whole was unreliable, the [[NK-33]] and [[NK-43]] engines are rugged and reliable when used as a standalone unit. In the mid-1990s, Russia sold 36 engines for [[USD|$]]1.1 million each and a license for the production of new engines to the US company [[Aerojet General]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94ePDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA14|title=The Politics and Perils of Space Exploration: Who Will Compete, Who Will Dominate?|last=Dawson|first=Linda|date=2016-11-22|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319388137|location=|pages=14|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe US company [[Kistler Aerospace]] worked on incorporating these engines into a new rocket design with the intention of offering commercial launch services, but the attempt ended in bankruptcy. Aerojet also modified the NK-33 to incorporate thrust vector control capability for [[Orbital Sciences Corporation|Orbital Science]]'s [[Antares (rocket)|Antares]] launch vehicle. Antares used two of these modified AJ-26 engines for first stage propulsion. The first four launches of the Antares were successful, but on the fifth launch the rocket exploded shortly after launch. Preliminary failure analysis by Orbital pointed to a possible turbopump failure in one NK-33/AJ-26. Given Aerojet's previous problems with the NK-33/AJ-26 engine during the modification and test program (two engine failures in static test firings, one of which caused major damage to the test stand) and the later in-flight failure, Orbital decided that the NK-33/AJ-26 was not reliable enough for future use.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rhian|first1=Jason|title=Orbital's Cygnus - on a SpaceX Falcon 9? - SpaceFlight Insider|url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/commercial/orbitals-cygnus-spacex-falcon-9/|website=Spaceflight Insider|publisher=Spaceflight Insider|accessdate=13 February 2016|date=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn Russia, N1 engines were not used again until 2004, when the remaining 70 or so engines were incorporated into a new rocket design, the Soyuz 3.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harvey|first1=Brian|title=The rebirth of the Russian space program 50 years after Sputnik, new frontiers|date=2007|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-71356-4|page=201|edition=1st |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmTz6Phf5WYC&pg=PA201}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Zak|first1=Anatoly|title=The history of the Soyuz-3 launch vehicle.|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/soyuz3_lv.html|website=russianspaceweb.com|publisher=Russian Space Web|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref> {{As of|2005}}, the project has been frozen due to the lack of funding.

This was to negate the pitch or yaw [[Moment (physics)|moment]] diametrically opposing engines in the outer ring would generate, thus maintaining symmetrical thrust.

The N1F Block B replaced the NK-15 engines with upgraded [[NK-43]] engines.\n\nBlock B could withstand the shutdown of one pair of opposing engines (6/8 engines).<ref name=KORD_engines/>\n\n===Block V third stage===\nThe upper stage, '''Block V''' ([[Ve (Cyrillic)|\u0412]]/''V'' being the third letter in the [[Russian alphabet]]), mounted four smaller NK-21 engines in a square.

The N1's Baikonur launch complex could not be reached by heavy barge. To allow transport by rail, all of the stages had to be shipped in pieces and assembled at the launch site.\n\nThe NK-15 engines had a number of valves that were activated by pyrotechnics rather than hydraulic or mechanical means, this being a weight-saving measure. Once shut, the valves could not be re-opened.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harford|first1=James|title=Korolev: how one man masterminded the Soviet drive to beat America to the moon|date=1997|publisher=Wiley|location=New York; Chichester|isbn=9780471327219|page=304}}</ref> This meant that the engines for Block A were only test-fired individually and the entire cluster of 30 engines was never static test fired as a unit. [[Sergei Khrushchev]] stated that only two out of every batch of six engines were tested, and not the units actually intended for use in the booster. As a result, the complex and destructive vibrational modes (which ripped apart propellant lines and turbines), as well as exhaust plume and fluid dynamic problems (causing vehicle roll, vacuum cavitation, and other problems), in Block A were not discovered and worked out before flight.<ref>{{cite web|title=Complex N1-L3 - Tests|url=http://www.energia.ru/en/history/systems/vehicles/vehicle_n1-l3_e.html|website=S.P.

Korolev RSC \"Energia\"|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> Blocks B and V were static test fired as complete units.\n\nBecause of its technical difficulties and lack of funding for a comprehensive test campaign, the N1 never completed a test flight. Twelve test flights were planned, with only four flown. All four uncrewed launches ended in failure before first-stage separation. The longest flight lasted 107 seconds, just before first-stage separation. Two test launches occurred in 1969, one in 1971, and the final one in 1972.\n\n===Comparison with Saturn V===\n{{Further|Saturn V}}\n[[Image:N1+Saturn5.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A comparison of the U.S. Saturn V rocket (left) with the Soviet N1/L3. Note: human at bottom illustrates scale]]\nAt {{convert|105|m|ft|sp=us}}, the N1-L3 was slightly shorter than the American [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo]]-[[Saturn V]] ({{convert|363|ft|m|order=flip|sp=us|disp=comma}}). The N-1 had a smaller overall diameter but a greater maximum diameter ({{convert|17|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=x|/}} vs. {{convert|33|ft|m|order=flip|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=x|/}}). The N1 produced more thrust in each of its first three stages than the corresponding stages of the Saturn V. The N1-L3 produced more [[impulse (physics)|total impulse]] in its first four stages than the Saturn V did in its three (see table below).\n\nThe N1 was intended to place the approximately {{convert|95|t|lb|abbr=on|sp=us|adj=on}} L3 payload into [[low Earth orbit]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harford|first1=James|title=Korolev: how one man masterminded the Soviet drive to beat America to the moon |date=1997 |publisher=Wiley |location=New York; Chichester |isbn=978-0-471-32721-9|page=271}}</ref> with the fourth stage included in the L3 complex was intended to place {{convert|23.5|t|lb|abbr=on|adj=on|sp=us}} into translunar orbit. In comparison, the Saturn V placed the roughly {{convert|100000|lb|t|abbr=on|adj=on|order=flip|sp=us}} Apollo spacecraft plus about {{convert|164100|lb|t|abbr=on|order=flip|sp=us}} of fuel remaining in the [[S-IVB]] third stage for [[translunar injection]] into a similar Earth parking orbit.\n\nThe N1 used [[RP-1|kerosene-based rocket fuel]] in all three of its main stages, while the Saturn V used [[liquid hydrogen]] to fuel its second and third stages, which yielded an overall performance advantage due to the higher [[specific impulse]]. The N1 also wasted available propellant volume by using spherical propellant tanks under a roughly conical external skin, while the Saturn V used most of its available cylindrical skin volume to house capsule-shaped hydrogen and oxygen tanks, with common bulkheads between the tanks in the second and third stages.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe N1-L3 would have been able to convert only 9.3% of its three-stage total impulse into Earth orbit payload [[momentum]] (compared to 12.14% for the Saturn V), and only 3.1% of its four-stage total impulse into translunar payload momentum, compared to 6.2% for the Saturn V.\n\nUnlike [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39]], the N1's Baikonur launch complex could not be reached by heavy barge. To allow transport by rail, all of the stages had to be shipped in pieces and assembled at the launch site. This led to difficulties in testing that contributed to the N1's lack of success.\n\nThe Saturn V also never lost a payload in two development and eleven operational launches, while four N1 development launch attempts all resulted in catastrophic failure, with two payload losses.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !!

After this happened, the KORD shut off Engine #24 to maintain symmetrical thrust. At T+6 seconds, [[pogo oscillation]] in the #2 engine tore several components off their mounts and started a propellant leak. At T+25 seconds, further vibrations ruptured a fuel line and caused [[RP-1]] to spill into the aft section of the booster. When it came into contact with the leaking gas, a fire started. The fire then burned through wiring in the power supply, causing electrical arcing which was picked up by sensors and interpreted by the KORD as a pressurization problem in the turbopumps. The KORD responded by issuing a general command to shut down the entire first stage at T+68 seconds into launch. This signal was also transmitted up to the second and third stages, \"locking\" them and preventing a manual ground command from being sent to start their engines. Telemetry also showed that the power generators in the N-1 continued functioning until the impact with the ground at T+183 seconds. Investigators discovered the remains of the rocket 32 miles (52 kilometers) from the launch pad. Vasily Mishin had initially blamed the generators for the failure, as he could not think of any other reason why all 30 engines would shut down at once, but this was quickly disproven by telemetry data and the recovery of the generators from the crash site. They had survived in good condition and were shipped back to the Istra plant, where they were refurbished and worked without any problems under bench testing. The investigative team did not speculate as to whether the burning first stage could have continued flying if the KORD system had not shut it down. The KORD was found to have a number of serious design flaws and poorly programmed logic. One unforeseen flaw was that its operating frequency, 1000 Hz, happened to perfectly coincide with vibration generated by the propulsion system, and the shutdown of Engine #12 at liftoff was believed to have been caused by pyrotechnic devices opening a valve, which produced a high-frequency oscillation that went into adjacent wiring and was assumed by the KORD to be an overspeed condition in the engine's turbopump. The wiring in Engine #12 was believed to be particularly vulnerable to this effect due to its length; however, other engines had similar wiring and were unaffected.

Boris Chertok claimed that a mass model lunar module was also carried; however, most sources indicate that only the L1S-2 and boost stages were on board N-1 5L. Launch took place at 11:18 PM Moscow time. For a few moments, the rocket lifted into the night sky. As soon as it cleared the tower, there was a flash of light, and debris could be seen falling from the bottom of the first stage. All the engines instantly shut down except engine #18. This caused the N-1 to lean over at a 45-degree angle and drop back onto launch pad [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 110|110 East]].<ref>{{cite web|title=N1 (vehicle 5L) moon rocket Test - launch abort system activated|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoBHBOnscY&noredirect=1|website=YouTube.com|publisher=2015 YouTube, LLC|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref> The nearly 2300 tons of propellant on board triggered a massive blast and shock wave that shattered windows across the launch complex and sent debris flying as far as 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the center of the explosion. Launch crews were permitted outside half an hour after the accident and encountered droplets of unburned RP-1 still raining down from the sky. The majority of the N-1's propellant load had not been consumed in the accident, and most of what had burned was in the first stage of the rocket. However, the worst-case scenario, mixing of the RP-1 and LOX to form an explosive gel, had not occurred. The subsequent investigation revealed that up to 85% of the propellant on board the rocket did not detonate, reducing the force of the blast.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zak|first1=Anatoly|title=The second launch of the N1 rocket (Largest explosion in space history rocks Tyuratam) - The aftermath|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/n1_5l.html|website=RussianSpaceWeb.com|publisher=Russian Space Web|accessdate=24 May 2015|date=6 November 2014}}</ref> The launch escape system had activated at the moment of engine shutdown (T+15 seconds) and pulled the L1S-2 capsule to safety 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) away. Impact with the pad occurred at T+23 seconds. Launch Complex 110 East was thoroughly leveled by the blast, with the concrete pad caved in and one of the lighting towers knocked over and twisted around itself. Despite the devastation, most of the telemetry tapes were found intact in the debris field and examined.\n\nJust before liftoff, the LOX turbopump in the #8 engine exploded (the pump was recovered from the debris and found to have signs of fire and melting). The resultant shock wave severed surrounding propellant lines and started a fire from leaking fuel. The fire damaged various components in the thrust section<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last = Harford\n | first = James\n | title = Korolev : how one man masterminded the Soviet drive to beat America to the moon\n | date = 1997\n | publisher = Wiley\n | location = New York; Chichester\n | isbn = 9780471327219\n | page = 295\n}}\n</ref> leading to the engines gradually being shut down between T+10 and T+12 seconds. The KORD had shut off engines #7, #19, #20, and #21 after detecting abnormal pressure and pump speeds. Telemetry did not provide any explanation as to what shut off the other engines. Engine #18, which had caused the booster to lean over 45 degrees, continued operating until impact, something engineers were never able to satisfactorily explain. It could not be determined exactly why the #8 turbopump had exploded. Working theories were that either a piece of a pressure sensor had broken off and lodged in the pump, or that its impeller blades had rubbed against the metal casing, creating a friction spark that ignited the LOX. The #8 engine had operated erratically prior to shutdown and a pressure sensor detected \"incredible force\" in the pump. Vasily Mishin believed that a pump rotor had disintegrated, but Kuznetsov argued that the NK-15 engines were entirely blameless and Mishin, who had defended the use of Kuznetsov's engines two years earlier, could not publicly come out and challenge him. Kuznetsov succeeded in getting the postflight investigative committee to rule the cause of the engine failure as \"ingestion of foreign debris\". Vladimir Barmin, chief director of launch facilities at Baikonur, also argued that the KORD should be locked for the first 15\u201320 seconds of flight to prevent a shutdown command from being issued until the booster had cleared the pad area.<ref>\n\n{{Citation\n | last = Williams\n | first = David\n | title = Tentatively Identified Missions and Launch Failures\n | publisher = NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n | date = 6 January 2005\n | url = http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/tent_launch.html\n | accessdate = 17 May 2013\n}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n | last = Reynolds\n | first = David West\n | title = Apollo: The Epic Journey to the Moon\n | date = 2002\n | publisher = Tahabi Books\n | location = San Diego, CA 92121\n | isbn = 0-15-100964-3\n | page = [https://archive.org/details/apolloepicjourne00reyn/page/162 162]\n | url = https://archive.org/details/apolloepicjourne00reyn/page/162\n }}\n</ref> The destroyed complex was photographed by American satellites, disclosing that the Soviet Union was building a Moon rocket.<ref name=\"German\"/> After this flight, fuel filters were installed in later models.<ref name=\"German\"/> It also took 18 months to rebuild the launch pad and delayed launches.

The KORD computer sensed an abnormal situation and sent a shutdown command to the first stage, but as noted above, the guidance program had since been modified to prevent this from happening until 50 seconds into launch. The roll, which had initially been 6\u00b0 per second, began rapidly accelerating. At T+39 seconds, the booster was rolling at nearly 40\u00b0 per second, causing the  [[inertial guidance system]] to go into [[gimbal lock]] and at T+48 seconds, the vehicle disintegrated from structural loads. The interstage truss between the second and third stages twisted apart and the latter separated from the stack and at T+50 seconds, the cutoff command to the first stage was unblocked and the engines immediately shut down. The upper stages impacted about 4 miles (7 kilometers) from the launch complex. Despite the engine shutoff, the first and second stages still had enough momentum to travel for some distance before falling to earth about 9 miles (15 kilometers) from the launch complex and blasting a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep|abbr=off|sp=us|order=flip}} crater in the steppe.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last = Harford\n | first = James\n | title = Korolev : how one man masterminded the Soviet drive to beat America to the moon\n | date = 1997\n | publisher = Wiley\n | location = New York; Chichester\n | isbn = 9780471327219\n | page = 298\n}}\n</ref> This N1 had dummy upper stages without the rescue system.

At T+90 seconds, a programmed shutdown of the core propulsion system (the six center engines) was performed to [[Max Q|reduce structural stress on the booster]]. Because of excessive dynamic loads caused by a [[Water hammer|hydraulic shock wave]] when the six engines were shut down abruptly, lines for feeding fuel and oxidizer to the core propulsion system burst and a fire started in the boattail of the booster; in addition, the #4 engine exploded. The first stage broke up starting at T+107 seconds and all telemetry data ceased at T+110 seconds. The launch escape system activated and pulled the Soyuz 7K-LOK to safety. The upper stages were ejected from the stack and crashed into the steppe. An investigation revealed that the abrupt shutdown of the engines led to fluctuations in the fluid columns of the feeder pipes which ruptured and spilled fuel and oxidizer onto the shut down, but still hot, engines. A failure of the #4 engine turbopump was also suspected. It was believed that the launch could have been salvaged had ground controllers sent a manual command to jettison the first stage and begin second stage burn early as the stage failed only 15 seconds before it was due to separate at T+125 seconds and it had reached the nominal burn time of 110 seconds according to the cyclogram.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nositel N-1 Launch Vehicle |url=https://archive.is/W58t |website=myspacemuseum.com/n1.htm |publisher=spacey@interaxs.net |accessdate=20 November 2019}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n | last = Harford\n | first = James\n | title = Korolev : how one man masterminded the Soviet drive to beat America to the moon\n | date = 1997\n | publisher = Wiley\n | location = New York; Chichester\n | isbn = 9780471327219\n | page = 300\n}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Wade |first1=Mark |title=N1 7L State Commission |url=http://astronautix.com/d/details51205.html |website=astronautix.com |publisher=\u00a9 1997-2017 Mark Wade |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Canceled fifth launch===\nVehicle serial number 8L was prepared for August 1974.

The basic N1 launch vehicle had three stages, which were to carry the L3 lunar payload into low Earth orbit with two cosmonauts. The L3 contained one stage for [[trans-lunar injection]]; another stage used for mid-course corrections, [[lunar orbit]] insertion, and the first part of the descent to the lunar surface; a single-pilot [[LK (spacecraft)|LK Lander]] spacecraft; and a two-pilot [[Soyuz 7K-LOK]] lunar orbital spacecraft for return to Earth.\n\nN1-L3 was underfunded and rushed, starting development in October 1965, almost four years after the Saturn V. The project was badly derailed by the death of its chief designer [[Sergei Korolev]] in 1966. Each of the four attempts to launch an N1 failed, with the second attempt resulting in the vehicle crashing back onto its launch pad shortly after liftoff and causing one of the [[List of the largest artificial non-nuclear explosions#Rank order of largest conventional explosions/detonations by magnitude|largest artificial non-nuclear explosions]] in human history. The N1 program was suspended in 1974, and officially canceled in 1976.

Accessed: 4 October 2011.</ref> The N2 was a smaller [[ICBM]] intended to compete with [[Vladimir Chelomei]]'s contemporary [[UR-200]] proposal, and the N3 would replace Korolev's widely used [[R-7 rocket]]. At this point the N-series was under study only, with no hardware built.\n\nThe two other main rocket designers and design bureaus presented competing proposals at the time of the original N-series proposal. [[Vladimir Chelomei]], Korolev's rival, presented his [[Universal Rocket]] (UR) series. The UR rockets used a common lower stage in various clustered configurations to meet a wide variety of payload requirements. [[Mikhail Yangel]], perhaps the most successful of the three but with little political power, presented the small [[R-26 (missile)|R-26]] intended to replace the [[R-16 (missile)|R-16]], the much larger [[R-36 (missile)|R-36]] ICBM, and the SK-100, a space launcher based on a huge cluster of R-16's. In the end the military planners selected Chelomei's [[UR-100]] as the new \"light\" ICBM, and Yangel's R-36 for the \"heavy\" role. They saw no need for any of the larger dedicated launchers, but also gave Korolev funding to develop a [[Molniya (rocket)|Molniya]] (8K78) adaptation of the R-7.\n\nIn March 1961, during a meeting at [[Baikonur]], designers discussed the N1 design, along with the competing [[Valentin Glushko|Glushko]] R-20 design.\n\n===Early Soviet lunar concepts===\n[[File:N1.stl|thumb|260x260px|Static [[3D model]] of the rocket]]\nIn May 1961, the US announced the goal of landing a person on the moon by 1970. During the same month, the ''On Reconsideration of the Plans for Space Vehicles in the Direction of Defense Purposes'' report set the first test launch of the N1 rocket for 1965. In June, Korolev was given a small amount of funding to start N1 development between 1961 and 1963. At the same time, Korolev proposed a lunar mission based on the new [[Soyuz spacecraft]] using an [[Earth orbit rendezvous]] profile. Several [[Soyuz (rocket)|Soyuz]] rocket launches would be used to build up a complete Moon mission package, including one for the Soyuz spacecraft, another for the lunar lander, and a few with cislunar engines and fuel. This approach, driven by the limited capacity of the Soyuz rocket, meant that a rapid launch rate would be required to assemble the complex before any of the components ran out of consumables on-orbit. Korolev subsequently proposed that the N1 be enlarged to allow a single launch lunar landing.\n\nMeanwhile, Chelomei's [[OKB-52]] proposed an alternate mission with much lower risk. Instead of a crewed landing, Chelomei proposed a series of circumlunar missions to beat the US to the vicinity of the moon. He also proposed a new booster for the mission, clustering three of his existing UR-200s (known as the [[SS-10]] in the west) to produce a single larger booster, the UR-500. These plans were dropped when Glushko offered Chelomei the RD-270, which allowed the construction of the [[UR-500]] in a much simpler \"monoblock\" design. He also proposed adapting an existing spacecraft design for the circumlunar mission, the single-cosmonaut [[LK-1]]. Chelomei felt that improvements in early UR-500/LK-1 missions would allow the spacecraft to be adapted for two cosmonauts.\n\nThe Strategic Missile Forces of the Soviet military was reluctant to support a politically motivated project with little military utility, but both Korolev and Chelomei pushed for a lunar mission. Between 1961 and 1964, Chelomei's less aggressive proposal was accepted, and development of his UR-500 and the LK-1 were given a relatively high priority.\n\n===Lunar N1 development starts===\n[[Valentin Glushko]], who then held a near-monopoly on rocket engine design in the Soviet Union, proposed the [[RD-270]] engine using [[unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine]] (UDMH) and [[nitrogen tetroxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) propellants to power the newly enlarged N1 design. These [[hypergolic]] propellants ignite on contact, reducing the complexity of the engine, and were widely used in Glushko's existing engines on various [[ICBM]]s. The full flow [[staged combustion cycle]] RD-270 was in testing before program cancellation, achieving a higher [[specific impulse]] than the [[gas-generator cycle]] [[Rocketdyne F-1]] despite the use of UDMH/N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> propellants with lower potential impulse. The F-1 engine was five years into its development at the time and still experiencing combustion stability problems.\n\nGlushko pointed out that the US [[Titan II GLV]] had successfully flown crew with similar hypergolic propellants. Korolev felt that the toxic nature of the fuels and their exhaust presented a safety risk for crewed space flight, and that kerosene/LOX was a better solution. The disagreement between Korolev and Glushko over the question of fuels ultimately became a major issue that hampered progress.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wade |first1=Mark |title=Korolev, Chelomei, and Glushko - A Work In Progress |url=http://www.friends-partners.org/mwade/articles/korgress.htm |website=astronautix |publisher=astronautix.com |accessdate=19 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Lindroos |first1=Marcus |title=THE SOVIET MANNED LUNAR PROGRAM |url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/science-technology-and-society/sts-471j-engineering-apollo-the-moon-project-as-a-complex-system-spring-2007/readings/soviet_mand_lunr.pdf |website=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |publisher=MIT OpenCourseWare |accessdate=19 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nPersonal issues between the two played a role, with Korolev holding Glushko responsible for his incarceration at the [[Kolyma#Emergence of the Gulag camps|Kolyma Gulag]] in the 1930s and Glushko considering Korolev to be cavalier and autocratic towards things outside his competence. The difference of opinions led to a falling out between Korolev and Glushko. In 1962, a committee was appointed to resolve the dispute and agreed with Korolev. Glushko refused outright to work on LOX/kerosene engines, and with Korolev in general. Korolev eventually gave up and decided to enlist the help of [[Nikolai Dmitriyevich Kuznetsov|Nikolai Kuznetsov]], the [[Kuznetsov Design Bureau|OKB-276]] [[jet engine]] designer, while Glushko teamed up with other rocket designers to build the very successful [[Proton (rocket family)|Proton]], [[Zenit (rocket family)|Zenit]], and [[Energia]] rockets.\n\nKuznetsov, who had limited experience in rocket design, responded with the [[NK-15]], a fairly small engine which would be delivered in several versions tuned to different altitudes. To achieve the required amount of thrust, it was proposed that 30 NK-15s would be used in a clustered configuration. An outer ring of 24 engines and an inner ring of six engines would be separated by an air gap, with airflow supplied via inlets near the top of the booster. The air would be mixed with the exhaust in order to provide some degree of [[air-augmented rocket|thrust augmentation]], as well as engine cooling. The arrangement of 30 rocket engine nozzles on the N1's first stage could have been an attempt at creating a crude version of a toroidal [[aerospike engine]] system; more conventional aerospike engines were also studied.\n\n===N1-L3 lunar complex===\n[[File:KH-8 N1.jpg|thumb|N1 imaged by US [[KH-8 Gambit]] reconnaissance satellite, 19 September 1968]]\nKorolev proposed a larger N1 combined with the new L3 lunar package based on the [[Soyuz 7K-L3]]. The L3 combined rocket stages, the modified [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]], and the new [[LK (spacecraft)|LK lunar lander]] were to be launched by a single N1 to conduct a lunar landing. Chelomei responded with a clustered UR-500-derived vehicle, topped with the L1 spacecraft already under development, and a lander developed by his design bureau. Korolev's proposal was selected as the winner in August 1964, but Chelomei was told to continue with his circumlunar UR-500/L1 work.\n\nWhen Khrushchev was overthrown later in 1964, infighting between the two teams started anew. In October 1965, the Soviet government ordered a compromise; the circumlunar mission would be launched on Chelomei's UR-500 using Korolev's Soyuz spacecraft in place of their own [[Zond program|Zond]] (\"probe\") design, aiming for a launch in 1967, the 50th anniversary of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]]. Korolev, meanwhile, would continue with his original N1-L3 proposal. Korolev had clearly won the argument, but work on the L1 continued anyway, as well as the Zond.\n\nIn 1966, the US [[Project Gemini]] had reversed the Soviet lead in human space exploration, Korolev initially lobbied for a manned circumlunar mission, which was rejected. He was eventually successful on 3 August 1964 when the [[Central Committee]] finally passed a resolution titled \"On work involving the study of the Moon and outer space\" with the objective of landing a cosmonaut on the Moon in the 1967 to 68 time frame, ahead of the American Apollo missions.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lindroos |first1=Marcus |title=THE SOVIET MANNED LUNAR PROGRAM |url=https://fas.org/spp/eprint/lindroos_moon1.htm |website=FAS |publisher=Federation of American Scientists (FAS) |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter Korolev died in 1966 due to complications after minor surgery, work on N1-L3 was taken over by his deputy, [[Vasily Mishin]]. Mishin did not have Korolev's political astuteness or influence and was reputed to be a heavy drinker. These problems contributed to the eventual cancellation of the N1 and the lunar mission as a whole, as did four consecutive launch failures with no successes.\n\n===N1 vehicle serial numbers===\n* N1 1L \u2013 full scale dynamic test model, each stage was individually dynamically tested; the full N1 stack was only tested at 1/4 scale.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vick|first1=Charles P.|last2=Berman|first2=Sara D.|last3=Lindborg|first3=Christina|title=The First Photograph of N1-L3 FSLT & TV (1M1) on the Pad.

The program was terminated in 1974 when Mishin was replaced by Glushko. Two N1Fs were being readied for launch at the time, but these plans were canceled.\n\nThe two flight-ready N1Fs were scrapped and their remains could still be found around Baikonur years later used as shelters and storage sheds.

Antares used two of these modified AJ-26 engines for first stage propulsion. The first four launches of the Antares were successful, but on the fifth launch the rocket exploded shortly after launch. Preliminary failure analysis by Orbital pointed to a possible turbopump failure in one NK-33/AJ-26. Given Aerojet's previous problems with the NK-33/AJ-26 engine during the modification and test program (two engine failures in static test firings, one of which caused major damage to the test stand) and the later in-flight failure, Orbital decided that the NK-33/AJ-26 was not reliable enough for future use.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rhian|first1=Jason|title=Orbital's Cygnus - on a SpaceX Falcon 9? - SpaceFlight Insider|url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/commercial/orbitals-cygnus-spacex-falcon-9/|website=Spaceflight Insider|publisher=Spaceflight Insider|accessdate=13 February 2016|date=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn Russia, N1 engines were not used again until 2004, when the remaining 70 or so engines were incorporated into a new rocket design, the Soyuz 3.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harvey|first1=Brian|title=The rebirth of the Russian space program 50 years after Sputnik, new frontiers|date=2007|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-71356-4|page=201|edition=1st |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmTz6Phf5WYC&pg=PA201}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Zak|first1=Anatoly|title=The history of the Soyuz-3 launch vehicle.|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/soyuz3_lv.html|website=russianspaceweb.com|publisher=Russian Space Web|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref> {{As of|2005}}, the project has been frozen due to the lack of funding.

This was to negate the pitch or yaw [[Moment (physics)|moment]] diametrically opposing engines in the outer ring would generate, thus maintaining symmetrical thrust.

The N1's Baikonur launch complex could not be reached by heavy barge. To allow transport by rail, all of the stages had to be shipped in pieces and assembled at the launch site.\n\nThe NK-15 engines had a number of valves that were activated by pyrotechnics rather than hydraulic or mechanical means, this being a weight-saving measure. Once shut, the valves could not be re-opened.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harford|first1=James|title=Korolev: how one man masterminded the Soviet drive to beat America to the moon|date=1997|publisher=Wiley|location=New York; Chichester|isbn=9780471327219|page=304}}</ref> This meant that the engines for Block A were only test-fired individually and the entire cluster of 30 engines was never static test fired as a unit. [[Sergei Khrushchev]] stated that only two out of every batch of six engines were tested, and not the units actually intended for use in the booster. As a result, the complex and destructive vibrational modes (which ripped apart propellant lines and turbines), as well as exhaust plume and fluid dynamic problems (causing vehicle roll, vacuum cavitation, and other problems), in Block A were not discovered and worked out before flight.<ref>{{cite web|title=Complex N1-L3 - Tests|url=http://www.energia.ru/en/history/systems/vehicles/vehicle_n1-l3_e.html|website=S.P.

Twelve test flights were planned, with only four flown. All four uncrewed launches ended in failure before first-stage separation. The longest flight lasted 107 seconds, just before first-stage separation. Two test launches occurred in 1969, one in 1971, and the final one in 1972.\n\n===Comparison with Saturn V===\n{{Further|Saturn V}}\n[[Image:N1+Saturn5.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A comparison of the U.S. Saturn V rocket (left) with the Soviet N1/L3.

The N-1 had a smaller overall diameter but a greater maximum diameter ({{convert|17|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=x|/}} vs. {{convert|33|ft|m|order=flip|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=x|/}}). The N1 produced more thrust in each of its first three stages than the corresponding stages of the Saturn V. The N1-L3 produced more [[impulse (physics)|total impulse]] in its first four stages than the Saturn V did in its three (see table below).\n\nThe N1 was intended to place the approximately {{convert|95|t|lb|abbr=on|sp=us|adj=on}} L3 payload into [[low Earth orbit]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harford|first1=James|title=Korolev: how one man masterminded the Soviet drive to beat America to the moon |date=1997 |publisher=Wiley |location=New York; Chichester |isbn=978-0-471-32721-9|page=271}}</ref> with the fourth stage included in the L3 complex was intended to place {{convert|23.5|t|lb|abbr=on|adj=on|sp=us}} into translunar orbit. In comparison, the Saturn V placed the roughly {{convert|100000|lb|t|abbr=on|adj=on|order=flip|sp=us}} Apollo spacecraft plus about {{convert|164100|lb|t|abbr=on|order=flip|sp=us}} of fuel remaining in the [[S-IVB]] third stage for [[translunar injection]] into a similar Earth parking orbit.\n\nThe N1 used [[RP-1|kerosene-based rocket fuel]] in all three of its main stages, while the Saturn V used [[liquid hydrogen]] to fuel its second and third stages, which yielded an overall performance advantage due to the higher [[specific impulse]]. The N1 also wasted available propellant volume by using spherical propellant tanks under a roughly conical external skin, while the Saturn V used most of its available cylindrical skin volume to house capsule-shaped hydrogen and oxygen tanks, with common bulkheads between the tanks in the second and third stages.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe N1-L3 would have been able to convert only 9.3% of its three-stage total impulse into Earth orbit payload [[momentum]] (compared to 12.14% for the Saturn V), and only 3.1% of its four-stage total impulse into translunar payload momentum, compared to 6.2% for the Saturn V.\n\nUnlike [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39]], the N1's Baikonur launch complex could not be reached by heavy barge. To allow transport by rail, all of the stages had to be shipped in pieces and assembled at the launch site. This led to difficulties in testing that contributed to the N1's lack of success.\n\nThe Saturn V also never lost a payload in two development and eleven operational launches, while four N1 development launch attempts all resulted in catastrophic failure, with two payload losses.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !!

At T+25 seconds, further vibrations ruptured a fuel line and caused [[RP-1]] to spill into the aft section of the booster. When it came into contact with the leaking gas, a fire started. The fire then burned through wiring in the power supply, causing electrical arcing which was picked up by sensors and interpreted by the KORD as a pressurization problem in the turbopumps. The KORD responded by issuing a general command to shut down the entire first stage at T+68 seconds into launch. This signal was also transmitted up to the second and third stages, \"locking\" them and preventing a manual ground command from being sent to start their engines. Telemetry also showed that the power generators in the N-1 continued functioning until the impact with the ground at T+183 seconds. Investigators discovered the remains of the rocket 32 miles (52 kilometers) from the launch pad. Vasily Mishin had initially blamed the generators for the failure, as he could not think of any other reason why all 30 engines would shut down at once, but this was quickly disproven by telemetry data and the recovery of the generators from the crash site. They had survived in good condition and were shipped back to the Istra plant, where they were refurbished and worked without any problems under bench testing. The investigative team did not speculate as to whether the burning first stage could have continued flying if the KORD system had not shut it down. The KORD was found to have a number of serious design flaws and poorly programmed logic. One unforeseen flaw was that its operating frequency, 1000 Hz, happened to perfectly coincide with vibration generated by the propulsion system, and the shutdown of Engine #12 at liftoff was believed to have been caused by pyrotechnic devices opening a valve, which produced a high-frequency oscillation that went into adjacent wiring and was assumed by the KORD to be an overspeed condition in the engine's turbopump. The wiring in Engine #12 was believed to be particularly vulnerable to this effect due to its length; however, other engines had similar wiring and were unaffected. Also, the system ended up drawing 25V instead of its designed 15V due to the ruptured power lines. The control wiring was relocated and coated with asbestos for fireproofing and the operating frequency changed.<ref name = \"Buran\">[http://www.buran.ru/htm/gud%2019.htm Raketno-kosmicheskii kompleks N1-L3, book: \u0413\u0443\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0438\u043d \u0412.\u0415., \u0421\u043b\u0430\u0431\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041b.\u0418.

Boris Chertok claimed that a mass model lunar module was also carried; however, most sources indicate that only the L1S-2 and boost stages were on board N-1 5L. Launch took place at 11:18 PM Moscow time. For a few moments, the rocket lifted into the night sky. As soon as it cleared the tower, there was a flash of light, and debris could be seen falling from the bottom of the first stage. All the engines instantly shut down except engine #18. This caused the N-1 to lean over at a 45-degree angle and drop back onto launch pad [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 110|110 East]].<ref>{{cite web|title=N1 (vehicle 5L) moon rocket Test - launch abort system activated|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyoBHBOnscY&noredirect=1|website=YouTube.com|publisher=2015 YouTube, LLC|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref> The nearly 2300 tons of propellant on board triggered a massive blast and shock wave that shattered windows across the launch complex and sent debris flying as far as 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the center of the explosion. Launch crews were permitted outside half an hour after the accident and encountered droplets of unburned RP-1 still raining down from the sky. The majority of the N-1's propellant load had not been consumed in the accident, and most of what had burned was in the first stage of the rocket. However, the worst-case scenario, mixing of the RP-1 and LOX to form an explosive gel, had not occurred. The subsequent investigation revealed that up to 85% of the propellant on board the rocket did not detonate, reducing the force of the blast.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zak|first1=Anatoly|title=The second launch of the N1 rocket (Largest explosion in space history rocks Tyuratam) - The aftermath|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/n1_5l.html|website=RussianSpaceWeb.com|publisher=Russian Space Web|accessdate=24 May 2015|date=6 November 2014}}</ref> The launch escape system had activated at the moment of engine shutdown (T+15 seconds) and pulled the L1S-2 capsule to safety 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) away. Impact with the pad occurred at T+23 seconds. Launch Complex 110 East was thoroughly leveled by the blast, with the concrete pad caved in and one of the lighting towers knocked over and twisted around itself. Despite the devastation, most of the telemetry tapes were found intact in the debris field and examined.\n\nJust before liftoff, the LOX turbopump in the #8 engine exploded (the pump was recovered from the debris and found to have signs of fire and melting). The resultant shock wave severed surrounding propellant lines and started a fire from leaking fuel. The fire damaged various components in the thrust section<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last = Harford\n | first = James\n | title = Korolev : how one man masterminded the Soviet drive to beat America to the moon\n | date = 1997\n | publisher = Wiley\n | location = New York; Chichester\n | isbn = 9780471327219\n | page = 295\n}}\n</ref> leading to the engines gradually being shut down between T+10 and T+12 seconds. The KORD had shut off engines #7, #19, #20, and #21 after detecting abnormal pressure and pump speeds. Telemetry did not provide any explanation as to what shut off the other engines. Engine #18, which had caused the booster to lean over 45 degrees, continued operating until impact, something engineers were never able to satisfactorily explain. It could not be determined exactly why the #8 turbopump had exploded. Working theories were that either a piece of a pressure sensor had broken off and lodged in the pump, or that its impeller blades had rubbed against the metal casing, creating a friction spark that ignited the LOX. The #8 engine had operated erratically prior to shutdown and a pressure sensor detected \"incredible force\" in the pump. Vasily Mishin believed that a pump rotor had disintegrated, but Kuznetsov argued that the NK-15 engines were entirely blameless and Mishin, who had defended the use of Kuznetsov's engines two years earlier, could not publicly come out and challenge him. Kuznetsov succeeded in getting the postflight investigative committee to rule the cause of the engine failure as \"ingestion of foreign debris\". Vladimir Barmin, chief director of launch facilities at Baikonur, also argued that the KORD should be locked for the first 15\u201320 seconds of flight to prevent a shutdown command from being issued until the booster had cleared the pad area.<ref>\n\n{{Citation\n | last = Williams\n | first = David\n | title = Tentatively Identified Missions and Launch Failures\n | publisher = NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n | date = 6 January 2005\n | url = http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/tent_launch.html\n | accessdate = 17 May 2013\n}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n | last = Reynolds\n | first = David West\n | title = Apollo: The Epic Journey to the Moon\n | date = 2002\n | publisher = Tahabi Books\n | location = San Diego, CA 92121\n | isbn = 0-15-100964-3\n | page = [https://archive.org/details/apolloepicjourne00reyn/page/162 162]\n | url = https://archive.org/details/apolloepicjourne00reyn/page/162\n }}\n</ref> The destroyed complex was photographed by American satellites, disclosing that the Soviet Union was building a Moon rocket.<ref name=\"German\"/> After this flight, fuel filters were installed in later models.<ref name=\"German\"/> It also took 18 months to rebuild the launch pad and delayed launches.

The KORD computer sensed an abnormal situation and sent a shutdown command to the first stage, but as noted above, the guidance program had since been modified to prevent this from happening until 50 seconds into launch. The roll, which had initially been 6\u00b0 per second, began rapidly accelerating. At T+39 seconds, the booster was rolling at nearly 40\u00b0 per second, causing the  [[inertial guidance system]] to go into [[gimbal lock]] and at T+48 seconds, the vehicle disintegrated from structural loads. The interstage truss between the second and third stages twisted apart and the latter separated from the stack and at T+50 seconds, the cutoff command to the first stage was unblocked and the engines immediately shut down. The upper stages impacted about 4 miles (7 kilometers) from the launch complex. Despite the engine shutoff, the first and second stages still had enough momentum to travel for some distance before falling to earth about 9 miles (15 kilometers) from the launch complex and blasting a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep|abbr=off|sp=us|order=flip}} crater in the steppe.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last = Harford\n | first = James\n | title = Korolev : how one man masterminded the Soviet drive to beat America to the moon\n | date = 1997\n | publisher = Wiley\n | location = New York; Chichester\n | isbn = 9780471327219\n | page = 298\n}}\n</ref> This N1 had dummy upper stages without the rescue system.

At T+90 seconds, a programmed shutdown of the core propulsion system (the six center engines) was performed to [[Max Q|reduce structural stress on the booster]]. Because of excessive dynamic loads caused by a [[Water hammer|hydraulic shock wave]] when the six engines were shut down abruptly, lines for feeding fuel and oxidizer to the core propulsion system burst and a fire started in the boattail of the booster; in addition, the #4 engine exploded. The first stage broke up starting at T+107 seconds and all telemetry data ceased at T+110 seconds. The launch escape system activated and pulled the Soyuz 7K-LOK to safety. The upper stages were ejected from the stack and crashed into the steppe. An investigation revealed that the abrupt shutdown of the engines led to fluctuations in the fluid columns of the feeder pipes which ruptured and spilled fuel and oxidizer onto the shut down, but still hot, engines. A failure of the #4 engine turbopump was also suspected. It was believed that the launch could have been salvaged had ground controllers sent a manual command to jettison the first stage and begin second stage burn early as the stage failed only 15 seconds before it was due to separate at T+125 seconds and it had reached the nominal burn time of 110 seconds according to the cyclogram.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nositel N-1 Launch Vehicle |url=https://archive.is/W58t |website=myspacemuseum.com/n1.htm |publisher=spacey@interaxs.net |accessdate=20 November 2019}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n | last = Harford\n | first = James\n | title = Korolev : how one man masterminded the Soviet drive to beat America to the moon\n | date = 1997\n | publisher = Wiley\n | location = New York; Chichester\n | isbn = 9780471327219\n | page = 300\n}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Wade |first1=Mark |title=N1 7L State Commission |url=http://astronautix.com/d/details51205.html |website=astronautix.com |publisher=\u00a9 1997-2017 Mark Wade |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Canceled fifth launch===\nVehicle serial number 8L was prepared for August 1974.

Born in [[Sanjak of Herzegovina|Ottoman Herzegovina]] into a [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] family, Mehmed was taken from his family at an early age as part of the Ottoman [[dev\u015firme]] system of taking Christian boys to be raised to serve as a [[janissary]]. These boys were forcibly converted to Islam and educated, and the talented ones were used to run the Ottoman imperial system; Sokollu Mehmed Pasha is one of many that made the best of their careers (reaching Grand Vizier rank).\n\nHe rose through the ranks of the Ottoman imperial system, eventually holding positions as commander of the imperial guard (1543\u20131546), [[List of Kapudan Pashas|High Admiral of the Fleet]] (1546\u20131551), [[Governor-General]] of [[Rumelia]] (1551\u20131555), Third [[Vizier]] (1555\u20131561), Second Vizier (1561\u20131565), and as [[Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire|Grand Vizier]] (1565\u20131579, for a total of 14 years, three months, 17 days) under three sultans: [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], [[Selim II]], and [[Murad III]].<ref name=Imamovic>Imamovi\u0107, Mustafa (1996).

One is his relationship to [[Makarije Sokolovi\u0107]]. Traditionally identified as his brother, today some historians consider him to have been either a nephew or distant relative.<ref name=Imamovic/><ref name=Kocan/> The second is the matter of Mehmed's uncle. By some accounts, his uncle was a monk at the [[Mile\u0161eva monastery]] who had his two nephews, Bajica and Makarije (taken to be brothers according to this view), educated there.<ref name=Kocan/> Other sources suggest that his uncle converted to [[Islam]] early.<ref name=Imamovic/>\n\nIn 1516, an Ottoman expedition stealing boys as part of the ''[[dev\u015firme]]'' system reached Sokol. According to folklore, Bajica was either simply taken from his father's home or, due to a reputation as a gifted child, specifically chosen for abduction by the commanding Ye\u015filce Mehmed Bey. The story further holds that his uncle unsuccessfully appealed to the authorities, even offering gold for the child's return.<ref name=Kocan/>\n\n===Janissary education===\nHe was renamed Mehmed and, first in [[Edirne]] and then in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], received a thorough Ottoman indoctrination as a recruit, first as an apprentice [[Janissary]] (in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''Acemi O\u011flan''); then in the ''[[Enderun]]'' or palace school in [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]].\n\nAs proclaimed in [[Baghdad]] on 13 March 1535, Mehmed was sent to be one of the seven retainers of the Imperial Treasurer [[Iskender \u00c7elebi]]. Upon Iskender's death, Mehmed returned to Constantinople. In addition to [[Ottoman Turkish language|Turkish]], he spoke [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Italian language|Venetian-Italian]] and [[Latin language]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n===Early career===\nMehmed in 1541 first became an Imperial Chamberlain and then the head of the Sultan's [[squire]]s. In these positions he became very close to Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] and learned from him.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs a soldier, Mehmed excelled at the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] and the first [[Siege of Vienna]]. In 1546 the [[Kapudan Pasha]] [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] died and Mehmed was appointed his successor. In this capacity he was present at the naval expedition against Trablus (present-day [[Tripoli]] in [[Libya]]). During his five years in this position, Mehmed Pasha greatly strengthened the arsenal of the naval fleet.\n\nMehmed became ''[[Beylerbey]]'' (Governor-General) of [[Rumelia]] in 1551, headquartered in [[Sofia]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mehmed-Pasa-Sokollu|title=Mehmed Pasa Sokollu {{!}} Ottoman vizier|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en}}</ref> While he was visiting the area of his birth, his mother recognized him by the [[birthmark]] on his face and embraced her child for the first time in more than thirty years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nAfter the death of [[John Z\u00e1polya]], king of [[Hungary]] as an Ottoman vassal, in 1540, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]] looked to annex Z\u00e1polya's lands (the [[Eastern Hungarian Kingdom]]). The Hungarian diet had elected infant [[John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya]], the son of Z\u00e1polya and [[Isabella Jagiellon]], as King of Hungary, which broke the [[Treaty of Nagyv\u00e1rad]], and Ferdinand I invaded Hungary. Queen Isabella struggled to rule Hungary for her son. Frater [[George Martinuzzi]], appointed by John as regent, opposed her (he would later be created a Cardinal as reward for his accomplishments in this conflict). Ferdinand I sent mercenary leader (''[[condottiero]]'') Bartolomeo Castoldo with more than 7,000 mercenaries who beat a contingent led by [[P\u00e9ter Petrovics]], killing more than 2,500 of them, near [[Csan\u00e1d]]. The Sultan immediately ordered Sokollu Mehmed Pasha to move into [[Hungary]], so he assembled an army of 90,000 soldiers and fifty-four cannons and also summoned the [[pasha]]s of [[Sanjak of Smederevo|Smederevo]], [[Sanjak of Vidin|Vidin]] and [[Sanjak of Nicopolis|Nicopolis]]. When his forces reached [[Stari Slankamen|Slankamen]] in [[Syrmia]], George Martinuzzi begged Mehmed not to attack Transylvania, arguing that it had remained in the possession of the Sultan. Mehmed rejected negotiation proposals, led Ottoman forces into Transylvania and soon captured 16 cities, including [[Be\u010dej]], [[Zrenjanin|Becskerek]], [[Csan\u00e1d]] and [[Lipova, Arad|Lippa]]. In this campaign, Sokollu won over to his side local Serb-manned garrisons by pointing out to his common ethnicity with them.<ref name=veinstein/> Martinuzzi responded by raising a rebellion in Transylvania, mustering one soldier from every household. Mehmed had to fall back and once again laid siege to [[Temesv\u00e1r]] on 14 October with the main part of his army and 50 cannons. Mehmed demanded surrender, but the city's commander, Istv\u00e1n Losonci, replied with a recommendation for Mehmed's return to Rumelia.\n\nMehmed besieged the city until 28 October but could not seize it. Retreating to [[Belgrade]], he initiated peace negotiations with the Monk-Viceroy. Martinuzzi was assassinated on 17 December 1551, and peace talks ended. Sokollu Mehmed renewed his military campaign in 1552, seizing [[Temesv\u00e1r]] (see [[Siege of Temesv\u00e1r (1552)]]), [[Holl\u00f3k\u0151]], [[Buj\u00e1k]], [[R\u00e9ts\u00e1g]], [[Balassagyarmat]], the whole of [[Banat]] and [[Szolnok]]. Sokollu Mehmed's forces then joined with those of [[Kara Ahmed Pasha|Ahmet Pasha]] advancing towards [[Eger]]. Mehmed's army assembled on the Hill of Egid but [[Siege of Eger (1552)|could not take the city itself]].\n\nIn 1532, Sultan Suleiman [[Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1532\u201355)|had declared war]] on [[Safavid Persia]] following two decades of peace after the climactic [[Battle of Chaldiran]], when the Persian Shah [[Tahmasp I|Tahmasp]] wanted to take advantage of the Sultan's preoccupation with Hungary and started making armed incursions into Ottoman territory. Sokollu Mehmed was dispatched to spend the winter of 1553/1554 in [[Tokat]] to take charge of the final stages of the war against Persia. In June 1554, Mehmed Pasha and the Rumelian troops joined the Sultan's army and took part in the [[Safavid Campaign (1554\u201355)]].\n\n===Vizier===\n\n====Third Vizier====\nImpressed by Sokollu Mehmed's skills, the Sultan made him the Third Vizier in 1555 and he was given a place in the Imperial Council (''[[Divan]]''). His position as Governor-General of Rumelia was given to a [[Serb clans|Herzegovinian]] Janissary ''[[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]'', Pertev Pasha, an old companion of Mehmed's from when they had both served under [[Iskender \u00c7elebi]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nAlmost immediately Sokollu Mehmed had to quell a rebellion around [[Thessalonika|Salonica]], led by Mustafa Bey, who pretended to be the Sultan's late son Mustafa. Sokollu Mehmed took 4,000 horsemen and 3,000 janissaries and quelled the rebellion. Mustafa Bey was hanged.\n\nMehmed's brother, Topuzli-Makarije, became a monk of the Serb [[Hilandar|Chilandar Monastery]] on [[Mount Athos]]. Makarije Sokolovi\u0107 paid a visit to his brother's palace in Constantinople in 1557, where the two brothers discussed the possibility of re-establishing the [[autocephaly]] of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]. Later that same year, Sokollu Mehmed issued an edict (''[[firman]]'') declaring the restoration of the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107]], with Makarije Sokolovi\u0107 as [[Serbian Patriarch]] Makarije I. The edict also guaranteed the rights and religious freedom of all inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nWhen the former Grand Vizier Ahmet Pasha was deposed and hanged, he was replaced by [[R\u00fcstem Pasha]], who had numerous enemies. One of them was [[Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha|Lala Mustafa]], who instigated the Sultan's third son, Bayezid, then ''Beylerbey'' of [[Karaman]], to raise a rebellion against his brother and heir-apparent [[Selim II|Selim]]. Sokollu Mehmed mustered an army and went to [[Konya]], where he decisively defeated Bayezid's forces in May 1559. Bayezid fled to Persia. Sokollu Mehmed remained in Asia and spent the winter negotiating with the Persian Shah regarding Bayezid's extradition.

Maximilian wanted the cities previously taken by [[Telli Hasan Pasha]] restored to him. When negotiations failed, Maximilian declared war and Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha ordered his nephew, Sokollu Mustafa Bey of Bosnia, to advance against Maximilian. Mustafa managed to capture the cities of Krupa and [[Dvor na Uni]]. The Sultan immediately declared war against the Holy Roman Empire, and Sokollu Mehmed began the preparations for the army's advance. The Grand Vizier went ahead, preparing for the arrival of the Sultan, who was leading the main part of the Ottoman forces. After 50 days, they arrived in Belgrade.\n\nPassing through [[Zemun]], one part of the army crossed [[Vara\u017edin]] and struck [[Egar]] before proceeding towards [[Vienna]]. [[Nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinski]] (Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi) had defeated the ''[[sanjakbey]]'' [[Tirhal Mohammed]], executing him and his son, and capturing 17,000 [[ducat]]s. This incurred the Sultan's wrath, and he dispatched Sokollu Mehmed's forces to besiege [[Szigetv\u00e1r]], while Suleiman remained in [[Harsang]]. The commander of [[Buda]], Arslan Pasha, lost the cities of [[V\u00e1rpalota]], [[Veszpr\u00e9m]] and [[Tata, Hungary|Tata]]. The Sultan sent a platoon of fifteen troopers to bring him Arslan Pasha's head, but Arslan had already left his forces three days earlier and was on his way to the Sultan. The Sultan showed Sokollu Mehmed a letter in which Arslan had insulted him, and on 3 August, when Arslan reported to Mehmed's tent with 15 heavily armed horsemen, Sokollu Mehmed criticized Arslan for his conduct, accused him of treason and stripped him of his post, giving it instead to his nephew Sokollu Mustafa Bey{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}.\n\nThe Sultan arrived with Sokollu Mehmed's sons, Kurt Bey and Hasan Bey, at [[P\u00e9cs]].

Sokollu Mehmed rewarded those involved in the capture of Szigetv\u00e1r and increased the soldiers' wages. He sent a part of the army to capture [[Bab\u00f3csa]]. The [[Tartars]], however, spread the news of the Sultan's death, and Sokollu Mustafa Bey wrote to Prince Selim about his father's death. Selim marched immediately towards [[Srem]]. Upon his arrival in [[Vukovar]], Sokollu Mehmed wrote him that it would be best if he went to Belgrade to greet his army for a more formal and effective take-over of the Empire. Selim returned to Belgrade, and Mehmed ordered the army to march towards the town. Forty days after the Sultan's death, in October 1566, the army set out for Belgrade. At the fourth stop on the way to Belgrade, forty-eight days after Suleiman's death, Sokollu Mehmed announced the Sultan's death ceremonially, during the traditional reading of the [[Koran]]. Sokollu Mehmed had Suleiman's body embalmed and ordered the army to proceed to meet the new Sultan in Belgrade. After three marches, the army arrived in [[Sremska Mitrovica]]. Mehmed reminded Selim to send gifts to the viziers, pashas and the army, but Selim's advisors convinced the new Sultan not to do so. Sokollu Mehmed went to Belgrade and swore allegiance to Selim II as his Sultan, and Selim confirmed him as his Grand Vizier.{{sfn|Tezcan|2010|p=98}}\n\nExpecting a mutiny among the military in the capital, Sokollu Mehmed had Suleiman's body sent to Constantinople to restore order amongst the janissaries and other officials, who now demanded more compensation for their past efforts. In Belgrade, Sultan Selim II called a council, as even some of his closest officials were openly mocking him{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}. Sokollu Mehmed assured him that he would manage everything effectively, and distributed gifts to the troops, rewarding them handsomely to regain their loyalty{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}.\n\nOn the fifth day of their stay in Belgrade, the Sultan, Sokollu Mehmed and the army departed for Constantinople. Before they managed to return to the Empire's capital, a mutiny broke out and the road to the city was blocked, and Sokollu Mehmed and Ahmed Pasha had to bribe their way into the city. Order was restored after Sokollu Mehmed convinced the Sultan to promise to send handsome gifts and higher wages to the janissaries. The next morning, each janissary was given standard pay of 40 ducats and an additional 20 ducats as an accession bonus. Soon, the other branches of the military, the [[sipahi]]s and mercenaries, demanded higher wages as well. Mehmed arrested and replaced their ''aghas'' at once, finally stopping all dissent{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}.\n\nTwo years after Selim's accession, on 17 February 1568, Sokollu Mehmed succeeded in concluding at [[Edirne]] a peace treaty with Emperor Maximilian II, whereby the Emperor agreed to pay an annual \"honary present\" of 30,000 ducats.\n\n====Expedition to Sumatra====\nOne of Sokollu\u2019s greatest responsibilities was planning an Ottoman invasion of [[Sumatra]] in 1567. Historical records from the time show that Sokollu played an active role in the strategic execution of the invasion and that he was extremely detailed in the logistics.<ref name=\"Ortega\">{{cite journal|last1=Ortega|first1=Stephen|title=The Ottoman Age of Exploration|journal=The Historian|date=2012|volume=74|issue=1|page=89|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6563.2011.00314_2.x}}</ref> Later on, Sokollu would also participate in the expedition as a commander.

An uprising led by Zaydi Imam in Yemen created a lot of uncertainty in the region which Sokollu had to give imminent priority before taking any further action in Aceh.<ref name=\"Ortega\" /> While the insurrection in Yemen started in the summer of 1567, it was not taking seriously by the Ottoman regime until later in the year, when most of the major cities in the region came under fire by the rebellious factions. It is believed that the cause of the dissatisfaction in Yemen was the intensified Ottoman involvement in the region as a prelude for an expansion in the Indian Ocean. The unhappiness in the Ottoman Yemen also went back to the rule of Governor Mahmud Pasha, a compatriot of Sokollu, who managed to produce large economic gains in the region at the expense of the wellbeing of the population. After Mahmud\u2019s wrongdoings in Yemen had been revealed, Sokollu decided to appoint Koja Sinan, who was assigned the responsibilities to appease the turmoils in Yemen.<ref name =\"fetvaci\">{{cite journal|last1=Fetvaci|first1=E.|last2=Necipoglu|first2=Gulru|title=Viziers and Eunuchs: Transition in Ottoman Manuscript Patronage|journal=ProQuest|date=2005|issue=1566-1617}}</ref><ref name=\"Ortega\" />\n\n====Suez Canal====\nAlthough the rebellions in Yemen once again forced Sokollu to postpone any further military action in Sumatra and the Indian Ocean,<ref name=\"Ortega\" /> it also opened the possibility to promote one of his favorite projects: and attempt to build a canal from the Mediterranean to Suez.<ref name=\"rossi\">{{cite journal|last1=Rossi|first1=N.|last2=Rosand|first2=David|title=Italian Renaissance Depictions of the Ottoman Sultan: Nuances in the Function of Early Modern Italian Portraiture|journal=ProQuest|date=2013}}</ref> He instructed the governor of Egypt to send architects engineers to assess the possibility of this canal, with the purpose of allowing a better connection from Muslims attempting to visit the Holy Cities.<ref name=\"Ortega\" /> Sokollu also was concerned about Muslims from the northeast, Crimea and Anatolia, who had to cross the Black Sea in order to visit the Holy Cities. Thus, he took actions for the construction of an open canal between the Don and the Volga in the north.\n\n====Wars with Russia, Venice and the Holy League====\nMehmed Pasha had little success against [[Muscovy|Russia]], and the first encounter between the Ottoman Empire and her future northern rival presaged the disaster to come. A plan had been devised at Constantinople for connecting the [[Volga]] and [[Don (river)|Don]] by a canal, and in the summer of 1569 a large force of janissaries and cavalry was sent to lay siege to [[Astrakhan]] and begin the canal works, while an Ottoman fleet besieged [[Azov]]. However, a sortie of the garrison of Astrakhan drove back the besiegers.  A Russian army of 15,000 men attacked and scattered the workmen and the [[Tatar]] force sent for their protection, and the Ottoman fleet was destroyed by a storm. Early in 1570 the ambassadors of [[Ivan the Terrible]] concluded at Constantinople a treaty which restored friendly relations between the Sultan and the [[Tsar]].<ref>{{Citation| author=Nikolas K.

In 1570 he dispatched [[Sinan Pasha]] to conquer [[Arabia]]. Sinan Pasha solemnly declared the reign of Sultan Selim II in [[Mecca]] upon finishing his military campaign in [[Hejaz]] and [[Yemen]].\n\nIn 1571-1572, on the order Mehmed's wife Ismihan Sultan (or Esma Han Sultan), the famous architect [[Mimar Sinan]] built the [[Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque (Kad\u0131rga)|Sokollu Mehmed Pa\u015fa Mosque]], which an authoritative guide to Constantinople states to be \"The most beautiful of the smaller mosques in Istanbul, a minor masterpiece by Sinan\".<ref name=freely>J.Freely (1998) ''Istanbul: The Imperial City'', Penguin</ref><ref>[http://newmanservices.com/turkey/thumbs.asp?sokollu Sokollu Mehmet Pasa Mosque 1572 photos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427052933/http://newmanservices.com/turkey/thumbs.asp?sokollu |date=2006-04-27 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the rule of Sokollu Mehmed Pasha as Grand Vizier, the Ottoman navy and army [[Turkish\u2013Venetian War (1570\u20131573)|took]] [[Cyprus]] in 1571 from [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]. The administration of Cyprus was given to Mehmed's old friend, the [[Arab]] Ahmed Pasha. The invasion of Cyprus led to the formation of a so-called [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]], comprising the [[Pope]], [[Habsburg Spain|Spain with Naples and Sicily]], the [[Republic of Venice]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]], and the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]]. On 7 October 1571, the coalition's fleet under the command of [[John of Austria|Don Juan of Austria]] decisively defeated the Ottoman fleet under [[M\u00fcezzinzade Ali Pasha]] in the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]].\n\nSokollu Mehmed Pasha immediately ensured that [[Piyale Pasha]] and [[Ulu\u00e7 Ali Reis]], the new Grand Admiral, were provided with all the necessary means and resources to rebuild the Empire's shattered fleet. By July 1572 the Ottoman fleet already numbered 250 fully equipped warships \"including eight of the largest capital ships ever seen in the Mediterranean\".<ref>S.J.Shaw, [1976] History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, pp.178</ref> It is reported in Turkish chronicles that Sokollu Mehmed Pasha had said to the Venetian Ambassador \"By conquering Cyprus we have cut off one of your arms; at Lepanto by defeating our navy you have only shaved off our beard. However, you know that a cut-off arm cannot be replaced but shaved-off beard grows thicker.\" Indeed, the Holy League ships had to retire to ports and Ottoman naval supremacy in the Mediterranean was restored. The new Ottoman Navy that started a naval expedition in summer of 1573 under Ulu\u00e7 Ali Reis found no rivals in the Mediterranean and ravaged the coasts of Sicily and southern Italy and in 1574 it captured [[Tunis]] from the Hafsids, who for some time had been supported by Spanish troops, thus restoring Ottoman domination of Western Mediterranean.\n\nOn 3 March 1573, the Venetian Republic signed a new peace treaty with the Ottomans under Mehmed Pasha, thereby bringing the Holy League to an end, accepting the loss of Cyprus and increasing the tribute payments. He also extended for eight more years the peace treaty with the Holy Roman Empire and maintained good relations with [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland-Lithuania]] and Russia. He was preparing for a fresh attack on Venice when the Sultan's death on 12 December 1574 cut short his plans.\n\n====Final years====\n\n[[File:Sokullu Mehmed Pa\u015fa T\u00fcrbesi.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Sokollu Mehmed Pasha in Eyup Sultan]]\n\nSokollu Mehmed Pasha's wealth reached its peak around 1573, when the value of his personal property (cash, goods, accounts, objects) amounted to 18 million ducats. Mehmed received the standard Grand Vizier's wage of 20 ducats every day. His wealth increased greatly through gifts and taxes of Ottoman officials: anyone who became a vizier had to pay Mehmed Pasha 50,000-60,000 ducats, and every Governor-General had to pay 15,000-20,000 or even sometimes 30,000-40,000 ducats upon ascending to the office. The provincial governor of Egypt at [[Cairo]] alone dispatched 100,000 ducats to the Grand Vizier every year.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nOn 30 August 1574, Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha installed his nephew [[Antonije Sokolovi\u0107]], then the [[Bishop|Metropolitan]] of [[Herzegovina|Hum]], as the new [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[Archbishop of Ohrid]]. On 23 October the same year, upon the death of Patriarch Makarije's death, Antonije became the new [[Serbian Patriarch]]. Antonije died soon, in 1575, and was replaced by yet another one of Mehmed's nephews, [[Gerasim Sokolovi\u0107]].\n\nWhen Sultan Selim II died, Sokollu Mehmed Pasha again kept this secret until Selim's oldest son Murad arrived from his governor's post in [[Manisa]]. Sokollu Mehmed Pasha acknowledged the new Sultan, [[Murad III]], and remained Grand Vizier, but now he had to cope with the rising political influence of the palace women, first with Sultan's mother [[Nurbanu Sultan]] and then his wife, of Albanian origin, [[Safiye Sultan (wife of Murad III)|Safiye Sultan]]. Murad III gradually soured on Sokollu Mehmed's overwhelming power within the Empire, and the Grand Vizier's influence declined.\n\nSokollu Mehmed Pasha was involved in the succession disputes of the Polish Crown in 1576 and 1577, but this did not reach greater measures.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nSokollu Mehmed signed numerous treaties of friendship with Venice, [[Florence]], Spain, [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Switzerland]]. He also managed to force a number of European states to pay tribute: Austria paid 9,000 ducats; Transylvania 3,000; [[Wallachia]] 7,000; [[Moldavia]] 3,000. Eventually, even Venice had to pay him 4,000 ducats annually. This altogether gave him an annual income of 31,000 gold ducats.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nMehmed was initially known to be opposed to the [[Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1578\u20131590)|war with Persia]], which began in 1578, but was overruled upon eventually, amongst one of the reasons being the constant urgings by Sokollu Mehmed to take advantage of the Ottomans neighboring rival.{{sfn|Sicker|1986|pp=2-3}} Sultan Murad III time afterwards, began to limit his Grand Vizier's powers by slowly removing his allies from high offices. The state secretary Feridun, an old companion of Sokollu mehmed's since the siege of Szigetv\u00e1r, was sent to Belgrade, away from Constantinople. Mehmed's faithful Arab friend, the Governor-General of Cyprus, was lynched by mutinous soldiers. Mehmed's greatest rivals, [[Hamid Efendi]] and Piyale Pasha, arranged the execution of the Grand Vizier's Greek protege, [[Michael Kantakouzenos \u015eeytano\u011flu|Michael Kantakouzenos]]. On 10 October 1578, Sokollu Mustafa Bey, Sokollu Mehmed Pasha's nephew and Governor-General of Budin, was assassinated.

These boys were forcibly converted to Islam and educated, and the talented ones were used to run the Ottoman imperial system; Sokollu Mehmed Pasha is one of many that made the best of their careers (reaching Grand Vizier rank).\n\nHe rose through the ranks of the Ottoman imperial system, eventually holding positions as commander of the imperial guard (1543\u20131546), [[List of Kapudan Pashas|High Admiral of the Fleet]] (1546\u20131551), [[Governor-General]] of [[Rumelia]] (1551\u20131555), Third [[Vizier]] (1555\u20131561), Second Vizier (1561\u20131565), and as [[Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire|Grand Vizier]] (1565\u20131579, for a total of 14 years, three months, 17 days) under three sultans: [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], [[Selim II]], and [[Murad III]].<ref name=Imamovic>Imamovi\u0107, Mustafa (1996).

One is his relationship to [[Makarije Sokolovi\u0107]]. Traditionally identified as his brother, today some historians consider him to have been either a nephew or distant relative.<ref name=Imamovic/><ref name=Kocan/> The second is the matter of Mehmed's uncle. By some accounts, his uncle was a monk at the [[Mile\u0161eva monastery]] who had his two nephews, Bajica and Makarije (taken to be brothers according to this view), educated there.<ref name=Kocan/> Other sources suggest that his uncle converted to [[Islam]] early.<ref name=Imamovic/>\n\nIn 1516, an Ottoman expedition stealing boys as part of the ''[[dev\u015firme]]'' system reached Sokol. According to folklore, Bajica was either simply taken from his father's home or, due to a reputation as a gifted child, specifically chosen for abduction by the commanding Ye\u015filce Mehmed Bey. The story further holds that his uncle unsuccessfully appealed to the authorities, even offering gold for the child's return.<ref name=Kocan/>\n\n===Janissary education===\nHe was renamed Mehmed and, first in [[Edirne]] and then in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], received a thorough Ottoman indoctrination as a recruit, first as an apprentice [[Janissary]] (in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''Acemi O\u011flan''); then in the ''[[Enderun]]'' or palace school in [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]].\n\nAs proclaimed in [[Baghdad]] on 13 March 1535, Mehmed was sent to be one of the seven retainers of the Imperial Treasurer [[Iskender \u00c7elebi]]. Upon Iskender's death, Mehmed returned to Constantinople. In addition to [[Ottoman Turkish language|Turkish]], he spoke [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Italian language|Venetian-Italian]] and [[Latin language]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n===Early career===\nMehmed in 1541 first became an Imperial Chamberlain and then the head of the Sultan's [[squire]]s. In these positions he became very close to Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] and learned from him.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs a soldier, Mehmed excelled at the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] and the first [[Siege of Vienna]]. In 1546 the [[Kapudan Pasha]] [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] died and Mehmed was appointed his successor. In this capacity he was present at the naval expedition against Trablus (present-day [[Tripoli]] in [[Libya]]). During his five years in this position, Mehmed Pasha greatly strengthened the arsenal of the naval fleet.\n\nMehmed became ''[[Beylerbey]]'' (Governor-General) of [[Rumelia]] in 1551, headquartered in [[Sofia]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mehmed-Pasa-Sokollu|title=Mehmed Pasa Sokollu {{!}} Ottoman vizier|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en}}</ref> While he was visiting the area of his birth, his mother recognized him by the [[birthmark]] on his face and embraced her child for the first time in more than thirty years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nAfter the death of [[John Z\u00e1polya]], king of [[Hungary]] as an Ottoman vassal, in 1540, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]] looked to annex Z\u00e1polya's lands (the [[Eastern Hungarian Kingdom]]). The Hungarian diet had elected infant [[John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya]], the son of Z\u00e1polya and [[Isabella Jagiellon]], as King of Hungary, which broke the [[Treaty of Nagyv\u00e1rad]], and Ferdinand I invaded Hungary. Queen Isabella struggled to rule Hungary for her son. Frater [[George Martinuzzi]], appointed by John as regent, opposed her (he would later be created a Cardinal as reward for his accomplishments in this conflict). Ferdinand I sent mercenary leader (''[[condottiero]]'') Bartolomeo Castoldo with more than 7,000 mercenaries who beat a contingent led by [[P\u00e9ter Petrovics]], killing more than 2,500 of them, near [[Csan\u00e1d]]. The Sultan immediately ordered Sokollu Mehmed Pasha to move into [[Hungary]], so he assembled an army of 90,000 soldiers and fifty-four cannons and also summoned the [[pasha]]s of [[Sanjak of Smederevo|Smederevo]], [[Sanjak of Vidin|Vidin]] and [[Sanjak of Nicopolis|Nicopolis]]. When his forces reached [[Stari Slankamen|Slankamen]] in [[Syrmia]], George Martinuzzi begged Mehmed not to attack Transylvania, arguing that it had remained in the possession of the Sultan. Mehmed rejected negotiation proposals, led Ottoman forces into Transylvania and soon captured 16 cities, including [[Be\u010dej]], [[Zrenjanin|Becskerek]], [[Csan\u00e1d]] and [[Lipova, Arad|Lippa]]. In this campaign, Sokollu won over to his side local Serb-manned garrisons by pointing out to his common ethnicity with them.<ref name=veinstein/> Martinuzzi responded by raising a rebellion in Transylvania, mustering one soldier from every household. Mehmed had to fall back and once again laid siege to [[Temesv\u00e1r]] on 14 October with the main part of his army and 50 cannons. Mehmed demanded surrender, but the city's commander, Istv\u00e1n Losonci, replied with a recommendation for Mehmed's return to Rumelia.\n\nMehmed besieged the city until 28 October but could not seize it. Retreating to [[Belgrade]], he initiated peace negotiations with the Monk-Viceroy. Martinuzzi was assassinated on 17 December 1551, and peace talks ended. Sokollu Mehmed renewed his military campaign in 1552, seizing [[Temesv\u00e1r]] (see [[Siege of Temesv\u00e1r (1552)]]), [[Holl\u00f3k\u0151]], [[Buj\u00e1k]], [[R\u00e9ts\u00e1g]], [[Balassagyarmat]], the whole of [[Banat]] and [[Szolnok]]. Sokollu Mehmed's forces then joined with those of [[Kara Ahmed Pasha|Ahmet Pasha]] advancing towards [[Eger]]. Mehmed's army assembled on the Hill of Egid but [[Siege of Eger (1552)|could not take the city itself]].\n\nIn 1532, Sultan Suleiman [[Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1532\u201355)|had declared war]] on [[Safavid Persia]] following two decades of peace after the climactic [[Battle of Chaldiran]], when the Persian Shah [[Tahmasp I|Tahmasp]] wanted to take advantage of the Sultan's preoccupation with Hungary and started making armed incursions into Ottoman territory. Sokollu Mehmed was dispatched to spend the winter of 1553/1554 in [[Tokat]] to take charge of the final stages of the war against Persia. In June 1554, Mehmed Pasha and the Rumelian troops joined the Sultan's army and took part in the [[Safavid Campaign (1554\u201355)]].\n\n===Vizier===\n\n====Third Vizier====\nImpressed by Sokollu Mehmed's skills, the Sultan made him the Third Vizier in 1555 and he was given a place in the Imperial Council (''[[Divan]]''). His position as Governor-General of Rumelia was given to a [[Serb clans|Herzegovinian]] Janissary ''[[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]'', Pertev Pasha, an old companion of Mehmed's from when they had both served under [[Iskender \u00c7elebi]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nAlmost immediately Sokollu Mehmed had to quell a rebellion around [[Thessalonika|Salonica]], led by Mustafa Bey, who pretended to be the Sultan's late son Mustafa. Sokollu Mehmed took 4,000 horsemen and 3,000 janissaries and quelled the rebellion. Mustafa Bey was hanged.\n\nMehmed's brother, Topuzli-Makarije, became a monk of the Serb [[Hilandar|Chilandar Monastery]] on [[Mount Athos]]. Makarije Sokolovi\u0107 paid a visit to his brother's palace in Constantinople in 1557, where the two brothers discussed the possibility of re-establishing the [[autocephaly]] of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]. Later that same year, Sokollu Mehmed issued an edict (''[[firman]]'') declaring the restoration of the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107]], with Makarije Sokolovi\u0107 as [[Serbian Patriarch]] Makarije I. The edict also guaranteed the rights and religious freedom of all inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nWhen the former Grand Vizier Ahmet Pasha was deposed and hanged, he was replaced by [[R\u00fcstem Pasha]], who had numerous enemies. One of them was [[Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha|Lala Mustafa]], who instigated the Sultan's third son, Bayezid, then ''Beylerbey'' of [[Karaman]], to raise a rebellion against his brother and heir-apparent [[Selim II|Selim]]. Sokollu Mehmed mustered an army and went to [[Konya]], where he decisively defeated Bayezid's forces in May 1559. Bayezid fled to Persia. Sokollu Mehmed remained in Asia and spent the winter negotiating with the Persian Shah regarding Bayezid's extradition.

Maximilian wanted the cities previously taken by [[Telli Hasan Pasha]] restored to him. When negotiations failed, Maximilian declared war and Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha ordered his nephew, Sokollu Mustafa Bey of Bosnia, to advance against Maximilian. Mustafa managed to capture the cities of Krupa and [[Dvor na Uni]]. The Sultan immediately declared war against the Holy Roman Empire, and Sokollu Mehmed began the preparations for the army's advance. The Grand Vizier went ahead, preparing for the arrival of the Sultan, who was leading the main part of the Ottoman forces. After 50 days, they arrived in Belgrade.\n\nPassing through [[Zemun]], one part of the army crossed [[Vara\u017edin]] and struck [[Egar]] before proceeding towards [[Vienna]]. [[Nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinski]] (Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi) had defeated the ''[[sanjakbey]]'' [[Tirhal Mohammed]], executing him and his son, and capturing 17,000 [[ducat]]s. This incurred the Sultan's wrath, and he dispatched Sokollu Mehmed's forces to besiege [[Szigetv\u00e1r]], while Suleiman remained in [[Harsang]]. The commander of [[Buda]], Arslan Pasha, lost the cities of [[V\u00e1rpalota]], [[Veszpr\u00e9m]] and [[Tata, Hungary|Tata]]. The Sultan sent a platoon of fifteen troopers to bring him Arslan Pasha's head, but Arslan had already left his forces three days earlier and was on his way to the Sultan. The Sultan showed Sokollu Mehmed a letter in which Arslan had insulted him, and on 3 August, when Arslan reported to Mehmed's tent with 15 heavily armed horsemen, Sokollu Mehmed criticized Arslan for his conduct, accused him of treason and stripped him of his post, giving it instead to his nephew Sokollu Mustafa Bey{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}.\n\nThe Sultan arrived with Sokollu Mehmed's sons, Kurt Bey and Hasan Bey, at [[P\u00e9cs]].

Sokollu Mehmed rewarded those involved in the capture of Szigetv\u00e1r and increased the soldiers' wages. He sent a part of the army to capture [[Bab\u00f3csa]]. The [[Tartars]], however, spread the news of the Sultan's death, and Sokollu Mustafa Bey wrote to Prince Selim about his father's death. Selim marched immediately towards [[Srem]]. Upon his arrival in [[Vukovar]], Sokollu Mehmed wrote him that it would be best if he went to Belgrade to greet his army for a more formal and effective take-over of the Empire. Selim returned to Belgrade, and Mehmed ordered the army to march towards the town. Forty days after the Sultan's death, in October 1566, the army set out for Belgrade. At the fourth stop on the way to Belgrade, forty-eight days after Suleiman's death, Sokollu Mehmed announced the Sultan's death ceremonially, during the traditional reading of the [[Koran]]. Sokollu Mehmed had Suleiman's body embalmed and ordered the army to proceed to meet the new Sultan in Belgrade. After three marches, the army arrived in [[Sremska Mitrovica]]. Mehmed reminded Selim to send gifts to the viziers, pashas and the army, but Selim's advisors convinced the new Sultan not to do so. Sokollu Mehmed went to Belgrade and swore allegiance to Selim II as his Sultan, and Selim confirmed him as his Grand Vizier.{{sfn|Tezcan|2010|p=98}}\n\nExpecting a mutiny among the military in the capital, Sokollu Mehmed had Suleiman's body sent to Constantinople to restore order amongst the janissaries and other officials, who now demanded more compensation for their past efforts. In Belgrade, Sultan Selim II called a council, as even some of his closest officials were openly mocking him{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}. Sokollu Mehmed assured him that he would manage everything effectively, and distributed gifts to the troops, rewarding them handsomely to regain their loyalty{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}.\n\nOn the fifth day of their stay in Belgrade, the Sultan, Sokollu Mehmed and the army departed for Constantinople. Before they managed to return to the Empire's capital, a mutiny broke out and the road to the city was blocked, and Sokollu Mehmed and Ahmed Pasha had to bribe their way into the city. Order was restored after Sokollu Mehmed convinced the Sultan to promise to send handsome gifts and higher wages to the janissaries. The next morning, each janissary was given standard pay of 40 ducats and an additional 20 ducats as an accession bonus. Soon, the other branches of the military, the [[sipahi]]s and mercenaries, demanded higher wages as well. Mehmed arrested and replaced their ''aghas'' at once, finally stopping all dissent{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}.\n\nTwo years after Selim's accession, on 17 February 1568, Sokollu Mehmed succeeded in concluding at [[Edirne]] a peace treaty with Emperor Maximilian II, whereby the Emperor agreed to pay an annual \"honary present\" of 30,000 ducats.\n\n====Expedition to Sumatra====\nOne of Sokollu\u2019s greatest responsibilities was planning an Ottoman invasion of [[Sumatra]] in 1567. Historical records from the time show that Sokollu played an active role in the strategic execution of the invasion and that he was extremely detailed in the logistics.<ref name=\"Ortega\">{{cite journal|last1=Ortega|first1=Stephen|title=The Ottoman Age of Exploration|journal=The Historian|date=2012|volume=74|issue=1|page=89|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6563.2011.00314_2.x}}</ref> Later on, Sokollu would also participate in the expedition as a commander.

An uprising led by Zaydi Imam in Yemen created a lot of uncertainty in the region which Sokollu had to give imminent priority before taking any further action in Aceh.<ref name=\"Ortega\" /> While the insurrection in Yemen started in the summer of 1567, it was not taking seriously by the Ottoman regime until later in the year, when most of the major cities in the region came under fire by the rebellious factions. It is believed that the cause of the dissatisfaction in Yemen was the intensified Ottoman involvement in the region as a prelude for an expansion in the Indian Ocean. The unhappiness in the Ottoman Yemen also went back to the rule of Governor Mahmud Pasha, a compatriot of Sokollu, who managed to produce large economic gains in the region at the expense of the wellbeing of the population. After Mahmud\u2019s wrongdoings in Yemen had been revealed, Sokollu decided to appoint Koja Sinan, who was assigned the responsibilities to appease the turmoils in Yemen.<ref name =\"fetvaci\">{{cite journal|last1=Fetvaci|first1=E.|last2=Necipoglu|first2=Gulru|title=Viziers and Eunuchs: Transition in Ottoman Manuscript Patronage|journal=ProQuest|date=2005|issue=1566-1617}}</ref><ref name=\"Ortega\" />\n\n====Suez Canal====\nAlthough the rebellions in Yemen once again forced Sokollu to postpone any further military action in Sumatra and the Indian Ocean,<ref name=\"Ortega\" /> it also opened the possibility to promote one of his favorite projects: and attempt to build a canal from the Mediterranean to Suez.<ref name=\"rossi\">{{cite journal|last1=Rossi|first1=N.|last2=Rosand|first2=David|title=Italian Renaissance Depictions of the Ottoman Sultan: Nuances in the Function of Early Modern Italian Portraiture|journal=ProQuest|date=2013}}</ref> He instructed the governor of Egypt to send architects engineers to assess the possibility of this canal, with the purpose of allowing a better connection from Muslims attempting to visit the Holy Cities.<ref name=\"Ortega\" /> Sokollu also was concerned about Muslims from the northeast, Crimea and Anatolia, who had to cross the Black Sea in order to visit the Holy Cities. Thus, he took actions for the construction of an open canal between the Don and the Volga in the north.\n\n====Wars with Russia, Venice and the Holy League====\nMehmed Pasha had little success against [[Muscovy|Russia]], and the first encounter between the Ottoman Empire and her future northern rival presaged the disaster to come. A plan had been devised at Constantinople for connecting the [[Volga]] and [[Don (river)|Don]] by a canal, and in the summer of 1569 a large force of janissaries and cavalry was sent to lay siege to [[Astrakhan]] and begin the canal works, while an Ottoman fleet besieged [[Azov]]. However, a sortie of the garrison of Astrakhan drove back the besiegers.  A Russian army of 15,000 men attacked and scattered the workmen and the [[Tatar]] force sent for their protection, and the Ottoman fleet was destroyed by a storm. Early in 1570 the ambassadors of [[Ivan the Terrible]] concluded at Constantinople a treaty which restored friendly relations between the Sultan and the [[Tsar]].<ref>{{Citation| author=Nikolas K.

In 1570 he dispatched [[Sinan Pasha]] to conquer [[Arabia]]. Sinan Pasha solemnly declared the reign of Sultan Selim II in [[Mecca]] upon finishing his military campaign in [[Hejaz]] and [[Yemen]].\n\nIn 1571-1572, on the order Mehmed's wife Ismihan Sultan (or Esma Han Sultan), the famous architect [[Mimar Sinan]] built the [[Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque (Kad\u0131rga)|Sokollu Mehmed Pa\u015fa Mosque]], which an authoritative guide to Constantinople states to be \"The most beautiful of the smaller mosques in Istanbul, a minor masterpiece by Sinan\".<ref name=freely>J.Freely (1998) ''Istanbul: The Imperial City'', Penguin</ref><ref>[http://newmanservices.com/turkey/thumbs.asp?sokollu Sokollu Mehmet Pasa Mosque 1572 photos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427052933/http://newmanservices.com/turkey/thumbs.asp?sokollu |date=2006-04-27 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the rule of Sokollu Mehmed Pasha as Grand Vizier, the Ottoman navy and army [[Turkish\u2013Venetian War (1570\u20131573)|took]] [[Cyprus]] in 1571 from [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]. The administration of Cyprus was given to Mehmed's old friend, the [[Arab]] Ahmed Pasha. The invasion of Cyprus led to the formation of a so-called [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]], comprising the [[Pope]], [[Habsburg Spain|Spain with Naples and Sicily]], the [[Republic of Venice]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]], and the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]]. On 7 October 1571, the coalition's fleet under the command of [[John of Austria|Don Juan of Austria]] decisively defeated the Ottoman fleet under [[M\u00fcezzinzade Ali Pasha]] in the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]].\n\nSokollu Mehmed Pasha immediately ensured that [[Piyale Pasha]] and [[Ulu\u00e7 Ali Reis]], the new Grand Admiral, were provided with all the necessary means and resources to rebuild the Empire's shattered fleet. By July 1572 the Ottoman fleet already numbered 250 fully equipped warships \"including eight of the largest capital ships ever seen in the Mediterranean\".<ref>S.J.Shaw, [1976] History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, pp.178</ref> It is reported in Turkish chronicles that Sokollu Mehmed Pasha had said to the Venetian Ambassador \"By conquering Cyprus we have cut off one of your arms; at Lepanto by defeating our navy you have only shaved off our beard. However, you know that a cut-off arm cannot be replaced but shaved-off beard grows thicker.\" Indeed, the Holy League ships had to retire to ports and Ottoman naval supremacy in the Mediterranean was restored. The new Ottoman Navy that started a naval expedition in summer of 1573 under Ulu\u00e7 Ali Reis found no rivals in the Mediterranean and ravaged the coasts of Sicily and southern Italy and in 1574 it captured [[Tunis]] from the Hafsids, who for some time had been supported by Spanish troops, thus restoring Ottoman domination of Western Mediterranean.\n\nOn 3 March 1573, the Venetian Republic signed a new peace treaty with the Ottomans under Mehmed Pasha, thereby bringing the Holy League to an end, accepting the loss of Cyprus and increasing the tribute payments. He also extended for eight more years the peace treaty with the Holy Roman Empire and maintained good relations with [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland-Lithuania]] and Russia. He was preparing for a fresh attack on Venice when the Sultan's death on 12 December 1574 cut short his plans.\n\n====Final years====\n\n[[File:Sokullu Mehmed Pa\u015fa T\u00fcrbesi.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Sokollu Mehmed Pasha in Eyup Sultan]]\n\nSokollu Mehmed Pasha's wealth reached its peak around 1573, when the value of his personal property (cash, goods, accounts, objects) amounted to 18 million ducats. Mehmed received the standard Grand Vizier's wage of 20 ducats every day. His wealth increased greatly through gifts and taxes of Ottoman officials: anyone who became a vizier had to pay Mehmed Pasha 50,000-60,000 ducats, and every Governor-General had to pay 15,000-20,000 or even sometimes 30,000-40,000 ducats upon ascending to the office. The provincial governor of Egypt at [[Cairo]] alone dispatched 100,000 ducats to the Grand Vizier every year.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nOn 30 August 1574, Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha installed his nephew [[Antonije Sokolovi\u0107]], then the [[Bishop|Metropolitan]] of [[Herzegovina|Hum]], as the new [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[Archbishop of Ohrid]]. On 23 October the same year, upon the death of Patriarch Makarije's death, Antonije became the new [[Serbian Patriarch]]. Antonije died soon, in 1575, and was replaced by yet another one of Mehmed's nephews, [[Gerasim Sokolovi\u0107]].\n\nWhen Sultan Selim II died, Sokollu Mehmed Pasha again kept this secret until Selim's oldest son Murad arrived from his governor's post in [[Manisa]]. Sokollu Mehmed Pasha acknowledged the new Sultan, [[Murad III]], and remained Grand Vizier, but now he had to cope with the rising political influence of the palace women, first with Sultan's mother [[Nurbanu Sultan]] and then his wife, of Albanian origin, [[Safiye Sultan (wife of Murad III)|Safiye Sultan]]. Murad III gradually soured on Sokollu Mehmed's overwhelming power within the Empire, and the Grand Vizier's influence declined.\n\nSokollu Mehmed Pasha was involved in the succession disputes of the Polish Crown in 1576 and 1577, but this did not reach greater measures.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nSokollu Mehmed signed numerous treaties of friendship with Venice, [[Florence]], Spain, [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Switzerland]]. He also managed to force a number of European states to pay tribute: Austria paid 9,000 ducats; Transylvania 3,000; [[Wallachia]] 7,000; [[Moldavia]] 3,000. Eventually, even Venice had to pay him 4,000 ducats annually. This altogether gave him an annual income of 31,000 gold ducats.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nMehmed was initially known to be opposed to the [[Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1578\u20131590)|war with Persia]], which began in 1578, but was overruled upon eventually, amongst one of the reasons being the constant urgings by Sokollu Mehmed to take advantage of the Ottomans neighboring rival.{{sfn|Sicker|1986|pp=2-3}} Sultan Murad III time afterwards, began to limit his Grand Vizier's powers by slowly removing his allies from high offices. The state secretary Feridun, an old companion of Sokollu mehmed's since the siege of Szigetv\u00e1r, was sent to Belgrade, away from Constantinople. Mehmed's faithful Arab friend, the Governor-General of Cyprus, was lynched by mutinous soldiers. Mehmed's greatest rivals, [[Hamid Efendi]] and Piyale Pasha, arranged the execution of the Grand Vizier's Greek protege, [[Michael Kantakouzenos \u015eeytano\u011flu|Michael Kantakouzenos]]. On 10 October 1578, Sokollu Mustafa Bey, Sokollu Mehmed Pasha's nephew and Governor-General of Budin, was assassinated.

In the Fifties, the colors were inverted, the initials written in white over a red background. After the club won the Copa Libertadores, the emblem gained another star which is 50% bigger and is placed above the other four, which represent the three Brazilian championships (1975, 1976 and 1979) and the Brazilian Cup title (1992). However, Inter won the FIFA Club World Cup that same year, and the star symbolizing the Copa Libertadores title was moved down between the four stars representing the club's national honors, and a new diamond star was placed above it to commemorate the world crown. After winning the Libertadores again in 2010, yet another star was added.\n\n===\"Rolo Compressor\": The Steamroller===\n[[File:Time do Internacional, 1953.tif|thumb|Internacional's team, 1953. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil]].]]\nThe Forties were remarkable for the Colorados. One of the greatest squads in the club's history was formed in that decade, which earned the nickname Rolo Compressor, Portuguese for \"Steamroller\". They were an extremely offensive team that played from 1939 to 1948 and won eight Rio Grande do Sul championships. The reason for such superiority dated back to 1926, the year Inter started accepting black players in their squad \u2013 something that was not allowed by rivals Gr\u00eamio until 1952. That decision ended up strengthening the team, which placed no restrictions and always had the best players, and also gave birth to the affectionate nickname of \"The People's Club.\"\n\nThat team included some of the greatest football players in the club's history. Alfeu, Tesourinha, Abigail, Carlitos, Ad\u00e3ozinho, among others. The term \"Rolo Compressor\" was coined to represent Inter's power of \"crushing the opposition\" in their quest for victories. It showed the superiority of the team at that time.\n\n===The club's growth===\nThe end of the Forties marked the beginning of an era of growth for Internacional. The club restored the [[Est\u00e1dio dos Eucaliptos|Eucaliptos]], their old stadium, to host two matches of the FIFA World Cup in 1950 \u2013 Mexico vs Yugoslavia and Mexico vs Switzerland. On the pitch, Inter kept developing great players and provided most of the squad for the national team that won the 1956 Pan-American Games in Mexico.\n\nThe Brazilian Pan-American games squad played their first match on March 1, 1956, when they beat Chile 2\u20131. In the game against Costa Rica, up to then the greatest surprise of the competition, Brazil demolished the opposition by 7\u20131, with goals scored by Larry (3), Chinesinho (3) and Bodinho.\n\nThe final was played against Argentina. A 2\u20132 draw meant the title of the Pan-American Games Mexico 1956 for Tet\u00e9's men on an unbeaten run. Back in Brazil, the players were visited in Rio de Janeiro by the Vice President of the Republic, [[Jo\u00e3o Goulart]] (a former juvenile player for the team), and went to the Catete Palace to receive the trophy from the hands of the President of the Republic, [[Juscelino Kubitschek]].\n\nIn the Sixties, the Eucaliptos was becoming small for the large fan base. It was necessary to build a new stadium. Supporters mobilised and helped build Beira-Rio by donating bricks, iron bars, and cement. Ten years of work elapsed until the new Colorado home was inaugurated on April 6, 1969. The ground's magnitude was reflected in its name: Gigante da Beira-Rio (literally the \"Giant on the River Banks\" in Portuguese).\n\n===An era of titles===\n[[File:Don El\u00edas Figueroa.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Elias Figueroa]] one of the greatest defenders in the history of football and idol of Porto Alegre International.]]\nPerhaps no other time is remembered with more affection and longing by the Internacional supporters than the victorious Seventies. In that decade, Inter became the most successful club in Rio Grande do Sul and in Brazil. The new Beira-Rio stadium met the expectations of the fanatic crowd, and was the stage for some of the best years in Internacional's history. In 1975, after a thrilling victory against Cruzeiro at Beira-Rio, the Colorados secured the Brazilian championship title. The only goal of the match was scored by Chilean star defender El\u00edas Figueroa, with the so-called illuminated goal. The first golden star was now on the chest of every Colorado.\n\nIn 1976, Internacional kept the victorious squad from the previous year and arrived at the top of Brazil's football for the second time. They won the title over Corinthians by winning the final match 2\u20130. Valdomiro was the man of the match and scored the decisive goal. The campaign in 1976 was remarkable: in 23 matches for the Brazilian Championship, Rubens Minelli's men won 19, drew one and lost just three.\n\nThe end of the decade was crowned with yet another great victory. Inter won their third Brazilian title in 1979 after beating Vasco da Gama 2\u20131. With 16 wins, the team did not suffer a single defeat during the championship, a deed yet unmatched by any other club in Brazil. With this victory a third star was added over the club's emblem.\n\n===The world meets Inter===\nIn the 1980s Internacional enhanced its international stature. Led by legends such as [[Paulo Roberto Falc\u00e3o|Falc\u00e3o]], [[Edevaldo de Freitas|Edevaldo]] and [[Jo\u00e3o Batista da Silva|Batista]], Internacional reached the final of the Copa Libertadores in [[1980 Copa Libertadores|1980]] where they were grouped in Group 3 alongside compatriots [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]] and Venezuelan sides [[Deportivo Galicia]] and [[Deportivo T\u00e1chira]]. Internacional finished first in their group with four wins, one tie and one loss (although the defeat surprisingly came from Deportivo Galicia). In the semi-finals stage, the ''Colorados'' were grouped with Argentine side [[Club Atl\u00e9tico V\u00e9lez Sarsfield|V\u00e9lez Sarsfield]] and Colombian powerhouse [[Am\u00e9rica de Cali]]; once again, Inter managed to top the group with two victories over Velez and two draws against America (which was enough to see them reach the final). In the finals, Internacional faced off against [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]], who had already won the Copa Libertadores once in [[1971 Copa Libertadores|1971]]. The ''Colorado'' couldn't break the Uruguayan backline and the first leg, played at the Beira-Rio, finished 0\u20130. At the [[Estadio Centenario]] in [[Montevideo]], Inter were defeated 1\u20130. Despite losing Internacional's most important match ever, it set a precedent of great moments to come in this decade, as the team went on to win the Campeonato Ga\u00facho four years in a row starting in 1981.\n\nInternacional found itself as the base for the national team again, in 1984. The last time this has happened was in 1956, when eight footballers out of the 22-player squad called up for the national team played for Internacional. To represent Brazil in 1984 in Los Angeles, Internacional had their whole squad called up. The eleven players, from the goalkeeper to the number 11, won the silver medal. The team became known as \"Sele/Inter\". After beating Italy and Germany, Brazil won the football silver medal, a deed repeated in 1988, when Inter players such as goalkeeper Taffarel, full-back Luis Carlos Wink and center-back Aloisio defended the Brazilian colors. That same group would help Internacional become runners-up in 1987 and 1988 in the Brazilian championship.\n\nIn 1987, Inter started off well after finishing the first phase in first place of their group with four wins, two ties, and two defeats. In the semi-finals, the squad overcame [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]] after a 0\u20131 victory at the [[Mineir\u00e3o]]. However, in the finals Inter lost the chance at a fourth title after being defeated by [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]], containing famous players as [[Zico]], [[Bebeto]], [[Jorginho (footballer, born 1964)|Jorginho]], [[Jos\u00e9 Leandro Ferreira|Leandro]], [[Edino Nazareth Filho|Edinho]], [[Leonardo Ara\u00fajo|Leonardo]], [[Jorge Lu\u00eds Andrade da Silva|Andrade]], [[Zinho]] and [[Renato Ga\u00facho]] (who was elected the best player in the tournament). Once again in 1988, Inter found itself in the semifinals, this time after finishing second in their group in the first phase. Inter faced a real battle against arch-rivals Gr\u00eamio. The semi-final of the Brazilian Championship meant not only a bye to the final match, but also a place in the Copa Libertadores. The encounter became known as the \"Gre-Nal of the Century.\" With just ten players on the pitch, Inter ended the first half down 1\u20130. In the second half, pushed by a large crowd at Beira-Rio, the Colorados came from behind to defeat Gr\u00eamio with two goals scored by striker Nilson. In the final Inter fell to [[Esporte Clube Bahia|Bahia]] after losing 2\u20131 away on the first leg and failing to capitalize at home with a 0\u20130 tie.\n\nIn the [[1989 Copa Libertadores]], Internacional started poorly; they managed to progress to the Round of 16 but only after finishing third in their group, winning only two matches, drawing once and losing three. However, that would change in the knockout stages as Inter defeated five-times Libertadores winners [[Pe\u00f1arol]] 1\u20132 in Montevideo and 6\u20132 in Porto Alegre. The quarter-finals saw the team face off against Brazilian champions Bahia in a rematch of the Brasileirao finals they disputed a few months earlier; this time, Internacional beat Bahia 1\u20130 at home and ground out a 0\u20130 draw to progress to the semi-finals and exact revenge on the ''tricolor de a\u00e7o''. The semifinals had Internacional face off against a tough opponent: [[Club Olimpia|Olimpia]], who were the reigning champions of [[Paraguay]]. Olimpia, who were winners of the [[1979 Copa Libertadores]], were blossoming in their second golden era with players such as [[Ever Hugo Almeida|Ever Almeida]], [[Gabriel Gonz\u00e1lez (Paraguayan footballer)|Gabriel Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Adriano Samaniego]], and star [[Ra\u00fal Vicente Amarilla]], all coached by legend [[Luis Cubilla]]. The first match took place in [[Asunci\u00f3n]]; Inter managed to win 0\u20131 and were full of confidence in the return leg back home. However, Olimpia managed a spirited comeback and won the return leg 2\u20133 silencing the ''torcidas'' at the Beira-Rio. Inter even had a penalty kick in their favor, which was failed to convert into goal. Since the aggregate was tied at 3\u20133, a penalty shootout ensued to decide the finalist, and Olimpia won 3\u20135, eliminating the ''Colorados''. This elimination has been dubbed by fans as \"O desastre do Beira-Rio\".\n\n===The fourth star===\nIn 1992, Internacional won its fourth national title, the Brazilian Cup, against Fluminense. The first leg in Rio de Janeiro was a 2\u20131 defeat. The return leg before a packed Beira-Rio saw the team coached by [[Ant\u00f4nio Lopes]] come back to win 1\u20130. The club secured the title with the away goals rule.\n\n===Copa Libertadores and afterwards===\n{{See also|2006 Sport Club Internacional season}}\nUnder the leadership of chairman [[Fernando Chagas Carvalho Neto|Fernando Carvalho]] Inter entered the new millennium seeking renewal from their youth teams. The club won four state titles in a row, from 2002 to 2005. The club modernized all its departments and prepared for a new football era. The South American Cup meant a return to the world stage and prepared the team for contesting the Copa Libertadores title. The campaign included eight wins, six draws, and just one defeat, to Ecuador's [[LDU Quito]] in the quarter-finals. To win the title, Internacional had to move past two clubs that had won the tournament three times \u2013 Uruguay's [[Club Nacional de F\u00fatbol|Nacional]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo FC|S\u00e3o Paulo]], who were the defending champions.\n\nAgainst S\u00e3o Paulo, Internacional arguably won the title away in the first leg. Stunning the 80,000 ''s\u00e3o-paulinos'' attending the match at the [[Morumbi]] stadium, [[Rafael S\u00f3bis]] scored twice in the second half before defender [[Edcarlos]] scored for S\u00e3o Paulo. Internacional needed just a draw in the second leg at home, and they left the pitch as South American champions for the first time. Striker [[Fernand\u00e3o]], who, along with [[Tinga (footballer)|Tinga]], scored in the final match at the Beira-Rio stadium, was one of the 14 players finishing as top scorer of the Libertadores, with five goals. He was voted Man of the Match against S\u00e3o Paulo and won a [[Toyota Corolla]] as the prize. Fernand\u00e3o put the car up for auction and gave the money to charity organizations.\n\nInternacional competed in the [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] and shocked the heavily favored European champions [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] with such stars as Ronaldinho and Deco 1\u20130 in the final for their first ever World Championship. They would also win the [[2007 Recopa Sudamericana]]. Amidst all the victories in 2006, International had a bad start to the 2007 season. But to close this winning cycle with a triumph, Inter won the Recopa Sudamericana as they defeated [[Mexico|Mexican club]] [[C.F. Pachuca|Pachuca]] with a final score of 5\u20132. In the first game in [[Mexico]], the team had a good performance but was defeated 2\u20131. [[Alexandre Pato]] opened the scoring. In the second match, supported by over 51,000 fans crammed into Beira-Rio, Inter beat the opponent by a score of 4\u20130&nbsp;\u2013 the biggest win of the competition's history.\n\n===Two-times champion: Inter's success culminates with the greatest prize===\n[[File:EMELEC-INTERNACIONAL 13 (16675274519).jpg|thumbnail|Internacional line-up for [[2015 Copa Libertadores|Copa Libertadores]] game against [[Club Sport Emelec|Emelec]] on 18 March 2015.]]\n\nAfter the Recopa triumph, Internacional struggled to refill the ranks left after the triumphant generation of 2006; the club finished in 11th place in the S\u00e9rie A, which was barely enough to allow Internacional to participate in the [[2008 Copa Sudamericana]]. In 2008, Internacional won their state championship and participated in a friendly tournament called [[Mohammed bin Rashid International Football Championship 2008|Dubai Cup 2008]]. In the same year, Internacional won the Copa Sudamericana, beating Argentine side [[Estudiantes de La Plata]], becoming the first Brazilian winners of the trophy. Internacional repeated the Copa Sudamericana title; finished in a much-improved 6th place in the national league; retained their [[Campeonato Ga\u00facho 2009|state title]]; reached the finals of the [[2009 Copa do Brasil|Copa do Brasil]] (the best finish the club has had since 1999); and won the [[2009 Suruga Bank Championship|Suruga Bank]] tournament. On April 2, 2009, Inter launched its third uniform celebrating its Centenary, with a golden shirt, red shorts and red socks. The golden shirt represented the glories won in their history.<ref name=\"golden shirt\">{{cite web | author= | year= | title= ''Third Uniform'' | publisher=Sport Club Internacional Official web site | url=http://www.internacional.com.br/pagina.php?modulo=2&setor=18&codigo=8510 | accessdate=2009-10-07}}</ref> On August 2009, English club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] announced that a partnership was completed between the two clubs. The team performed extremely well on the 2009 Brazilian Championship, finishing as runners-up to Flamengo by 2 points. With this 2nd place, Internacional qualified to participate, once again, in the [[2010 Copa Libertadores]].\n\nInternacional was the top-seed of Group 5, which also contained Ecuador side Deportivo Quito and Emelec, as well as Cerro from Uruguay. In [[2010 Sport Club Internacional season|the 2010 season,]] Internacional finished first in their group, winning their three home matches and tying their away games, no least thanks to figures such as [[Kl\u00e9ber de Carvalho Corr\u00eaa|Kl\u00e9ber]], [[Alecsandro]], [[Giuliano de Paula|Giuliano]] and Argentine midfielder [[Andr\u00e9s D'Alessandro]].<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2010 | title= D\u00b4Alessandro: \"Hab\u00eda perdido la esperanza\" | publisher=Canchallena | url=https://www.lanacion.com.ar/1296046-dalessandro-habia-perdido-la-esperanza | accessdate=2019-01-11}}</ref> This saw the ''Colorados'' face off against Argentine champions Banfield; the series finished in a tight 3\u20133 scoreline, with Kl\u00e9ber's away goal in Banfield enough to send them through to the quarterfinals. In that stage, Internacional faced [[2009 Copa Libertadores|reigning champions]] Estudiantes, in a rematch of the [[2008 Copa Sudamericana Finals]]. Despite dominating most of the first leg played in Porto Alegre, Internacional only managed a 1\u20130 win. In Argentina, Estudiantes were winning 2\u20130 until the 88th minute, when Giuliano, Internacional's star goalscorer, put the ball in the net to give Inter a much needed goal and see them through to the semifinals to meet S\u00e3o Paulo, in a rematch of the [[2006 Copa Libertadores Finals|finals four years earlier]]. Again, Internacional only managed a 1\u20130 win at home despite dominating the game, and in S\u00e3o Paulo Alecsandro scored the decisive, away goal that saw Inter go through to their third final ever of the competition. Internacional won their second [[List of Copa Libertadores winners|Copa Libertadores title]] after they defeated Guadalajara 1\u20132 in the first leg and 3\u20132 in the second leg to clinch a 5\u20133 aggregate win.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/news/newsid=1287165.html#internacional+crowned+south+american+kings|title=Internacional crowned South American kings|date=2010-08-19|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=2010-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/tim_vickery/08/19/copa.libertadores.wed/|title=Internacional's trophy remains nothing short of remarkable |date=2019-08-19|work=SI.com|accessdate=2010-08-19}}</ref>\n\nThis victory gave Internacional the right to compete once again in the [[2010 FIFA Club World Cup]], with the goal of repeating the 2006 feat and becoming one of the very few Brazilian soccer clubs to have won the [[FIFA Club World Cup|World Cup]] twice. However, they were this time eliminated in the semi-final by the Congolese side [[TP Mazembe]], the African champions, in a 0\u20132 upset that completely stunned Brazilian soccer specialists and fans, and also most international soccer observers.<ref>\"TP Mazembe make history to reach Club World Cup final\".

Retrieved 10 January 2011.</ref>\n\n===Relegation and comeback===\nAfter a pretty good start in the [[2016 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A]], Internacional started to struggle and fell off to the bottom of the table, a run which included a 14-game winless streak. That led to the club's first relegation in its history, only ten years after winning the [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] over a historical [[FC Barcelona]] team. [[SC Internacional]] would eventually be promoted after finishing second in [[2017 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B]].\n\n==Crests==\n<gallery>\nFile:SCInternacionalFirstCrest.JPG|First crest,

({{IPA-pt|\u02cc\u0129te\u027en\u0250sjo\u02c8naw}}), commonly known as '''Inter''', is a Brazilian professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[Porto Alegre]].\n\nFounded in 4 April, 1909 by the Poppe brothers, with the clear goal of being a democratic institution without prejudice. Its colors are red and white and its fans are known as Colorados. It is one of the most successful clubs in Brazil and America in recent years, being the third club with the most international titles in Brazil, with 7 trophies.<ref>{{cite web | author= | year= | title= Quais os times brasileiros com mais t\u00edtulos internacionais?

In the Fifties, the colors were inverted, the initials written in white over a red background. After the club won the Copa Libertadores, the emblem gained another star which is 50% bigger and is placed above the other four, which represent the three Brazilian championships (1975, 1976 and 1979) and the Brazilian Cup title (1992). However, Inter won the FIFA Club World Cup that same year, and the star symbolizing the Copa Libertadores title was moved down between the four stars representing the club's national honors, and a new diamond star was placed above it to commemorate the world crown. After winning the Libertadores again in 2010, yet another star was added.\n\n===\"Rolo Compressor\": The Steamroller===\n[[File:Time do Internacional, 1953.tif|thumb|Internacional's team, 1953. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil]].]]\nThe Forties were remarkable for the Colorados. One of the greatest squads in the club's history was formed in that decade, which earned the nickname Rolo Compressor, Portuguese for \"Steamroller\". They were an extremely offensive team that played from 1939 to 1948 and won eight Rio Grande do Sul championships. The reason for such superiority dated back to 1926, the year Inter started accepting black players in their squad \u2013 something that was not allowed by rivals Gr\u00eamio until 1952. That decision ended up strengthening the team, which placed no restrictions and always had the best players, and also gave birth to the affectionate nickname of \"The People's Club.\"\n\nThat team included some of the greatest football players in the club's history. Alfeu, Tesourinha, Abigail, Carlitos, Ad\u00e3ozinho, among others. The term \"Rolo Compressor\" was coined to represent Inter's power of \"crushing the opposition\" in their quest for victories. It showed the superiority of the team at that time.\n\n===The club's growth===\nThe end of the Forties marked the beginning of an era of growth for Internacional. The club restored the [[Est\u00e1dio dos Eucaliptos|Eucaliptos]], their old stadium, to host two matches of the FIFA World Cup in 1950 \u2013 Mexico vs Yugoslavia and Mexico vs Switzerland. On the pitch, Inter kept developing great players and provided most of the squad for the national team that won the 1956 Pan-American Games in Mexico.\n\nThe Brazilian Pan-American games squad played their first match on March 1, 1956, when they beat Chile 2\u20131. In the game against Costa Rica, up to then the greatest surprise of the competition, Brazil demolished the opposition by 7\u20131, with goals scored by Larry (3), Chinesinho (3) and Bodinho.\n\nThe final was played against Argentina. A 2\u20132 draw meant the title of the Pan-American Games Mexico 1956 for Tet\u00e9's men on an unbeaten run. Back in Brazil, the players were visited in Rio de Janeiro by the Vice President of the Republic, [[Jo\u00e3o Goulart]] (a former juvenile player for the team), and went to the Catete Palace to receive the trophy from the hands of the President of the Republic, [[Juscelino Kubitschek]].\n\nIn the Sixties, the Eucaliptos was becoming small for the large fan base. It was necessary to build a new stadium. Supporters mobilised and helped build Beira-Rio by donating bricks, iron bars, and cement. Ten years of work elapsed until the new Colorado home was inaugurated on April 6, 1969. The ground's magnitude was reflected in its name: Gigante da Beira-Rio (literally the \"Giant on the River Banks\" in Portuguese).\n\n===An era of titles===\n[[File:Don El\u00edas Figueroa.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Elias Figueroa]] one of the greatest defenders in the history of football and idol of Porto Alegre International.]]\nPerhaps no other time is remembered with more affection and longing by the Internacional supporters than the victorious Seventies. In that decade, Inter became the most successful club in Rio Grande do Sul and in Brazil. The new Beira-Rio stadium met the expectations of the fanatic crowd, and was the stage for some of the best years in Internacional's history. In 1975, after a thrilling victory against Cruzeiro at Beira-Rio, the Colorados secured the Brazilian championship title. The only goal of the match was scored by Chilean star defender El\u00edas Figueroa, with the so-called illuminated goal. The first golden star was now on the chest of every Colorado.\n\nIn 1976, Internacional kept the victorious squad from the previous year and arrived at the top of Brazil's football for the second time. They won the title over Corinthians by winning the final match 2\u20130. Valdomiro was the man of the match and scored the decisive goal. The campaign in 1976 was remarkable: in 23 matches for the Brazilian Championship, Rubens Minelli's men won 19, drew one and lost just three.\n\nThe end of the decade was crowned with yet another great victory. Inter won their third Brazilian title in 1979 after beating Vasco da Gama 2\u20131. With 16 wins, the team did not suffer a single defeat during the championship, a deed yet unmatched by any other club in Brazil. With this victory a third star was added over the club's emblem.\n\n===The world meets Inter===\nIn the 1980s Internacional enhanced its international stature. Led by legends such as [[Paulo Roberto Falc\u00e3o|Falc\u00e3o]], [[Edevaldo de Freitas|Edevaldo]] and [[Jo\u00e3o Batista da Silva|Batista]], Internacional reached the final of the Copa Libertadores in [[1980 Copa Libertadores|1980]] where they were grouped in Group 3 alongside compatriots [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]] and Venezuelan sides [[Deportivo Galicia]] and [[Deportivo T\u00e1chira]]. Internacional finished first in their group with four wins, one tie and one loss (although the defeat surprisingly came from Deportivo Galicia). In the semi-finals stage, the ''Colorados'' were grouped with Argentine side [[Club Atl\u00e9tico V\u00e9lez Sarsfield|V\u00e9lez Sarsfield]] and Colombian powerhouse [[Am\u00e9rica de Cali]]; once again, Inter managed to top the group with two victories over Velez and two draws against America (which was enough to see them reach the final). In the finals, Internacional faced off against [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]], who had already won the Copa Libertadores once in [[1971 Copa Libertadores|1971]]. The ''Colorado'' couldn't break the Uruguayan backline and the first leg, played at the Beira-Rio, finished 0\u20130. At the [[Estadio Centenario]] in [[Montevideo]], Inter were defeated 1\u20130. Despite losing Internacional's most important match ever, it set a precedent of great moments to come in this decade, as the team went on to win the Campeonato Ga\u00facho four years in a row starting in 1981.\n\nInternacional found itself as the base for the national team again, in 1984. The last time this has happened was in 1956, when eight footballers out of the 22-player squad called up for the national team played for Internacional. To represent Brazil in 1984 in Los Angeles, Internacional had their whole squad called up. The eleven players, from the goalkeeper to the number 11, won the silver medal. The team became known as \"Sele/Inter\". After beating Italy and Germany, Brazil won the football silver medal, a deed repeated in 1988, when Inter players such as goalkeeper Taffarel, full-back Luis Carlos Wink and center-back Aloisio defended the Brazilian colors. That same group would help Internacional become runners-up in 1987 and 1988 in the Brazilian championship.\n\nIn 1987, Inter started off well after finishing the first phase in first place of their group with four wins, two ties, and two defeats. In the semi-finals, the squad overcame [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]] after a 0\u20131 victory at the [[Mineir\u00e3o]]. However, in the finals Inter lost the chance at a fourth title after being defeated by [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]], containing famous players as [[Zico]], [[Bebeto]], [[Jorginho (footballer, born 1964)|Jorginho]], [[Jos\u00e9 Leandro Ferreira|Leandro]], [[Edino Nazareth Filho|Edinho]], [[Leonardo Ara\u00fajo|Leonardo]], [[Jorge Lu\u00eds Andrade da Silva|Andrade]], [[Zinho]] and [[Renato Ga\u00facho]] (who was elected the best player in the tournament). Once again in 1988, Inter found itself in the semifinals, this time after finishing second in their group in the first phase. Inter faced a real battle against arch-rivals Gr\u00eamio. The semi-final of the Brazilian Championship meant not only a bye to the final match, but also a place in the Copa Libertadores. The encounter became known as the \"Gre-Nal of the Century.\" With just ten players on the pitch, Inter ended the first half down 1\u20130. In the second half, pushed by a large crowd at Beira-Rio, the Colorados came from behind to defeat Gr\u00eamio with two goals scored by striker Nilson. In the final Inter fell to [[Esporte Clube Bahia|Bahia]] after losing 2\u20131 away on the first leg and failing to capitalize at home with a 0\u20130 tie.\n\nIn the [[1989 Copa Libertadores]], Internacional started poorly; they managed to progress to the Round of 16 but only after finishing third in their group, winning only two matches, drawing once and losing three. However, that would change in the knockout stages as Inter defeated five-times Libertadores winners [[Pe\u00f1arol]] 1\u20132 in Montevideo and 6\u20132 in Porto Alegre. The quarter-finals saw the team face off against Brazilian champions Bahia in a rematch of the Brasileirao finals they disputed a few months earlier; this time, Internacional beat Bahia 1\u20130 at home and ground out a 0\u20130 draw to progress to the semi-finals and exact revenge on the ''tricolor de a\u00e7o''. The semifinals had Internacional face off against a tough opponent: [[Club Olimpia|Olimpia]], who were the reigning champions of [[Paraguay]]. Olimpia, who were winners of the [[1979 Copa Libertadores]], were blossoming in their second golden era with players such as [[Ever Hugo Almeida|Ever Almeida]], [[Gabriel Gonz\u00e1lez (Paraguayan footballer)|Gabriel Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Adriano Samaniego]], and star [[Ra\u00fal Vicente Amarilla]], all coached by legend [[Luis Cubilla]]. The first match took place in [[Asunci\u00f3n]]; Inter managed to win 0\u20131 and were full of confidence in the return leg back home. However, Olimpia managed a spirited comeback and won the return leg 2\u20133 silencing the ''torcidas'' at the Beira-Rio. Inter even had a penalty kick in their favor, which was failed to convert into goal. Since the aggregate was tied at 3\u20133, a penalty shootout ensued to decide the finalist, and Olimpia won 3\u20135, eliminating the ''Colorados''. This elimination has been dubbed by fans as \"O desastre do Beira-Rio\".\n\n===The fourth star===\nIn 1992, Internacional won its fourth national title, the Brazilian Cup, against Fluminense. The first leg in Rio de Janeiro was a 2\u20131 defeat. The return leg before a packed Beira-Rio saw the team coached by [[Ant\u00f4nio Lopes]] come back to win 1\u20130. The club secured the title with the away goals rule.\n\n===Copa Libertadores and afterwards===\n{{See also|2006 Sport Club Internacional season}}\nUnder the leadership of chairman [[Fernando Chagas Carvalho Neto|Fernando Carvalho]] Inter entered the new millennium seeking renewal from their youth teams. The club won four state titles in a row, from 2002 to 2005. The club modernized all its departments and prepared for a new football era. The South American Cup meant a return to the world stage and prepared the team for contesting the Copa Libertadores title. The campaign included eight wins, six draws, and just one defeat, to Ecuador's [[LDU Quito]] in the quarter-finals. To win the title, Internacional had to move past two clubs that had won the tournament three times \u2013 Uruguay's [[Club Nacional de F\u00fatbol|Nacional]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo FC|S\u00e3o Paulo]], who were the defending champions.\n\nAgainst S\u00e3o Paulo, Internacional arguably won the title away in the first leg. Stunning the 80,000 ''s\u00e3o-paulinos'' attending the match at the [[Morumbi]] stadium, [[Rafael S\u00f3bis]] scored twice in the second half before defender [[Edcarlos]] scored for S\u00e3o Paulo. Internacional needed just a draw in the second leg at home, and they left the pitch as South American champions for the first time. Striker [[Fernand\u00e3o]], who, along with [[Tinga (footballer)|Tinga]], scored in the final match at the Beira-Rio stadium, was one of the 14 players finishing as top scorer of the Libertadores, with five goals. He was voted Man of the Match against S\u00e3o Paulo and won a [[Toyota Corolla]] as the prize. Fernand\u00e3o put the car up for auction and gave the money to charity organizations.\n\nInternacional competed in the [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] and shocked the heavily favored European champions [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] with such stars as Ronaldinho and Deco 1\u20130 in the final for their first ever World Championship. They would also win the [[2007 Recopa Sudamericana]]. Amidst all the victories in 2006, International had a bad start to the 2007 season. But to close this winning cycle with a triumph, Inter won the Recopa Sudamericana as they defeated [[Mexico|Mexican club]] [[C.F. Pachuca|Pachuca]] with a final score of 5\u20132. In the first game in [[Mexico]], the team had a good performance but was defeated 2\u20131. [[Alexandre Pato]] opened the scoring. In the second match, supported by over 51,000 fans crammed into Beira-Rio, Inter beat the opponent by a score of 4\u20130&nbsp;\u2013 the biggest win of the competition's history.\n\n===Two-times champion: Inter's success culminates with the greatest prize===\n[[File:EMELEC-INTERNACIONAL 13 (16675274519).jpg|thumbnail|Internacional line-up for [[2015 Copa Libertadores|Copa Libertadores]] game against [[Club Sport Emelec|Emelec]] on 18 March 2015.]]\n\nAfter the Recopa triumph, Internacional struggled to refill the ranks left after the triumphant generation of 2006; the club finished in 11th place in the S\u00e9rie A, which was barely enough to allow Internacional to participate in the [[2008 Copa Sudamericana]]. In 2008, Internacional won their state championship and participated in a friendly tournament called [[Mohammed bin Rashid International Football Championship 2008|Dubai Cup 2008]]. In the same year, Internacional won the Copa Sudamericana, beating Argentine side [[Estudiantes de La Plata]], becoming the first Brazilian winners of the trophy. Internacional repeated the Copa Sudamericana title; finished in a much-improved 6th place in the national league; retained their [[Campeonato Ga\u00facho 2009|state title]]; reached the finals of the [[2009 Copa do Brasil|Copa do Brasil]] (the best finish the club has had since 1999); and won the [[2009 Suruga Bank Championship|Suruga Bank]] tournament. On April 2, 2009, Inter launched its third uniform celebrating its Centenary, with a golden shirt, red shorts and red socks. The golden shirt represented the glories won in their history.<ref name=\"golden shirt\">{{cite web | author= | year= | title= ''Third Uniform'' | publisher=Sport Club Internacional Official web site | url=http://www.internacional.com.br/pagina.php?modulo=2&setor=18&codigo=8510 | accessdate=2009-10-07}}</ref> On August 2009, English club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] announced that a partnership was completed between the two clubs. The team performed extremely well on the 2009 Brazilian Championship, finishing as runners-up to Flamengo by 2 points. With this 2nd place, Internacional qualified to participate, once again, in the [[2010 Copa Libertadores]].\n\nInternacional was the top-seed of Group 5, which also contained Ecuador side Deportivo Quito and Emelec, as well as Cerro from Uruguay. In [[2010 Sport Club Internacional season|the 2010 season,]] Internacional finished first in their group, winning their three home matches and tying their away games, no least thanks to figures such as [[Kl\u00e9ber de Carvalho Corr\u00eaa|Kl\u00e9ber]], [[Alecsandro]], [[Giuliano de Paula|Giuliano]] and Argentine midfielder [[Andr\u00e9s D'Alessandro]].<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2010 | title= D\u00b4Alessandro: \"Hab\u00eda perdido la esperanza\" | publisher=Canchallena | url=https://www.lanacion.com.ar/1296046-dalessandro-habia-perdido-la-esperanza | accessdate=2019-01-11}}</ref> This saw the ''Colorados'' face off against Argentine champions Banfield; the series finished in a tight 3\u20133 scoreline, with Kl\u00e9ber's away goal in Banfield enough to send them through to the quarterfinals. In that stage, Internacional faced [[2009 Copa Libertadores|reigning champions]] Estudiantes, in a rematch of the [[2008 Copa Sudamericana Finals]]. Despite dominating most of the first leg played in Porto Alegre, Internacional only managed a 1\u20130 win. In Argentina, Estudiantes were winning 2\u20130 until the 88th minute, when Giuliano, Internacional's star goalscorer, put the ball in the net to give Inter a much needed goal and see them through to the semifinals to meet S\u00e3o Paulo, in a rematch of the [[2006 Copa Libertadores Finals|finals four years earlier]]. Again, Internacional only managed a 1\u20130 win at home despite dominating the game, and in S\u00e3o Paulo Alecsandro scored the decisive, away goal that saw Inter go through to their third final ever of the competition. Internacional won their second [[List of Copa Libertadores winners|Copa Libertadores title]] after they defeated Guadalajara 1\u20132 in the first leg and 3\u20132 in the second leg to clinch a 5\u20133 aggregate win.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/news/newsid=1287165.html#internacional+crowned+south+american+kings|title=Internacional crowned South American kings|date=2010-08-19|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=2010-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/tim_vickery/08/19/copa.libertadores.wed/|title=Internacional's trophy remains nothing short of remarkable |date=2019-08-19|work=SI.com|accessdate=2010-08-19}}</ref>\n\nThis victory gave Internacional the right to compete once again in the [[2010 FIFA Club World Cup]], with the goal of repeating the 2006 feat and becoming one of the very few Brazilian soccer clubs to have won the [[FIFA Club World Cup|World Cup]] twice. However, they were this time eliminated in the semi-final by the Congolese side [[TP Mazembe]], the African champions, in a 0\u20132 upset that completely stunned Brazilian soccer specialists and fans, and also most international soccer observers.<ref>\"TP Mazembe make history to reach Club World Cup final\".

Retrieved 10 January 2011.</ref>\n\n===Relegation and comeback===\nAfter a pretty good start in the [[2016 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A]], Internacional started to struggle and fell off to the bottom of the table, a run which included a 14-game winless streak. That led to the club's first relegation in its history, only ten years after winning the [[2006 FIFA Club World Cup]] over a historical [[FC Barcelona]] team. [[SC Internacional]] would eventually be promoted after finishing second in [[2017 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B]].\n\n==Crests==\n<gallery>\nFile:SCInternacionalFirstCrest.JPG|First crest,

Cartoons]] and later [[DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]]. He wrote and directed many animated cartoon shorts starring [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], [[Porky Pig]], [[Foghorn Leghorn]], [[Hippety Hopper]], The [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]] and among other characters. He was also well known for defining [[Bugs Bunny]]'s look in the [[development of Bugs Bunny|1943]] short ''[[Tortoise Wins by a Hare]]''.\n\n==Career==\nBorn in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], McKimson spent 10 years gaining an art education. He then worked for [[Walt Disney]], stayed with [[List of assets owned by The Walt Disney Company|Disney's studio]] for two years and then joined the [[Romer Grey]] Studio located in [[Altadena, California]], in 1930, a would-be animation shop started by the son of Western author [[Zane Grey]], and financed by Zane Grey's wife. Several cartoons were animated at the Romer Grey Studio, but due to the [[Great Depression]], the studio was unable to close a distribution deal. None of the shorts were released, with only a handful of them being completed (only one of them is known to exist today).\n\nAt the same time he began working for Grey, McKimson was hired by [[Harman and Ising|Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising]], first doing the ink-and-paint duties for the very first ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', then becoming an [[Animator#Inbetweeners and cleanup artists|in-betweener]] before becoming an animator by 1931, when the Romer Grey Studio shut down. At that time he had an accident that gave him a concussion. As a result, he was able to visualize better,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} thus increasing his production and animation. He was the head animator and go-to guy in the late 1930s at the studio, which overwhelmed him. Eventually he worked exclusively with [[Bob Clampett]].<ref name=\"Michael Barrier.com-Interviews: Robert McKimson\">[http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Interviews/McKimson/McKimson.html], Michael Barrier.com-Interviews: Robert McKimson</ref> He was offered a directorial position by [[Leon Schlesinger]] in 1937, but declined, allowing the position to go to animator [[Chuck Jones]].<ref name=\"Michael Barrier.com-Interviews: Robert McKimson\"/> He accepted his own directorial position in late 1944, when [[Frank Tashlin]] left Warner Bros. to direct live-action films.<ref name=\"Michael Barrier.com-Feedback: Frank Tashlin Interview\">[http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Feedback/feedback_tashlin_interview.htm], Michael Barrier.com-Feedback: Frank Tashlin Interview</ref>\n\nMcKimson created characters like [[Foghorn Leghorn]] and the [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]], as well as directing every [[Hippety Hopper]]/[[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]] pairing. He also created [[Speedy Gonzales]] for the 1953 short ''[[Cat-Tails for Two]]'' and directed many others periodically (along with Freleng and other directors) for the remainder of his theatrical career.\n\n[[Image:Pop im Pop.png|thumb|A still from the 1950 Hippety Hopper/Sylvester short ''[[Pop 'im Pop!]]''. This cartoon also introduced Sylvester's son, Sylvester Junior.]]\nMcKimson's first directorial work that he finished, (Frank Tashlin left the cartoon incomplete upon departing) ''[[Daffy Doodles]]'', Daffy draws [[moustache]]s on all the pre-drawn (and even some natural) faces in his sight, was released in early April 1946. His third cartoon entitled ''[[Acrobatty Bunny]]'' would be the first [[Bugs Bunny]] short Mckimson directed. It was released in June 1946.\n\nIn 1953, the Warner Bros. cartoon studio laid off most of its staff for a period of six months due to the 3-D fad at the time, which Jack Warner found to be too costly a process to use for animated cartoons. After the studio re-opened, Freleng and Jones quickly re-assembled their respective units, but McKimson discovered every member of his previous team, apart from writer [[Tedd Pierce]] and background painter Richard H. Thomas, refused to work with him again.{{why|date=April 2014}} At the start of this period, McKimson animated on three of his own shorts, ''[[The Hole Idea]]'', ''[[Dime to Retire]]'', and ''Too Hop to Handle''. (in fact, he was the sole animator credited on ''[[The Hole Idea]]'') <ref name=\"Warner Bros. Cartoon Releases - 1955\">[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0571781/bio], Warner Bros. Cartoon Releases - 1955</ref> Soon, McKimson assembled a new team of artists, including layout man/background painter [[Robert Gribbroek]] and animators [[Warren Batchelder]], [[Ted Bonnicksen]], and [[George Grandpre]]. [[Tom Ray]] and [[Keith Darling]] helped at various points, while Russ Dyson briefly worked with Mckimson in 1956 until Dyson's death that year. McKimson's better known efforts would include ''[[Hillbilly Hare]]'', ''[[A-Lad-In His Lamp]]'', ''[[Stupor Duck]]'', ''[[The Windblown Hare]]'', ''[[Walky Talky Hawky]]'', and ''[[Big Top Bunny]]''.\n\n==Later career==\nMcKimson continued working at Warner's Cartoon Studio as it began to lose staff (including such key personnel such as Jones) in the early 1960s. Over this time, he directed his share of shorts and worked on the feature ''[[The Incredible Mr. Limpet]]''. After the studio closed, he joined [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]], co-owned by his old associate [[Friz Freleng]] and [[David H. DePatie]], who had been a producer at the Warners studio. At DePatie-Freleng, McKimson directed several ''[[The Inspector]]'' shorts and worked on some of the ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' contracted out to DePatie-Freleng by Warner Bros. In 1967, Warner opened its animation studio again, McKimson re-joining its staff in 1968, but the studio was shut down again in 1969. His last Warner Bros. cartoon was ''[[Injun Trouble (1969 film)|Injun Trouble]]'' with [[Cool Cat (Looney Tunes)|Cool Cat]]. ''Injun Trouble'' was also the last of the original ''Looney Tunes'' or ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoon to be produced before the Warner Bros. cartoon studio was closed. McKimson was the one person to be at the studio from the start of the Looney Tunes series through its finish in 1969, first as an animator and then as a director.\n\nAfter a sabbatical, he went back to DePatie-Freleng in 1972 to direct ''[[The Pink Panther Show]]'' shorts, among their other series.\n\n==Death==\nOn September 29, 1977, while having lunch with co-workers Friz Freleng and David H. DePatie, McKimson suffered a sudden [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and died at the age of 66. He had recently completed directing ''[[Misterjaw]]'' and had begun work on ''[[Baggy Pants and the Nitwits]]'' at the time of his death.\n\nMcKimson's body was buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Cemetery]] in [[Glendale, California]].\n\n==Personal life==\nIn addition to being an animator, McKimson was a skilled horseman and polo player, a dedicated bowler, and a Master [[Freemasonry|Mason]]. He had two brothers \u2014 [[Charles McKimson]] (the younger) and [[Thomas McKimson|Tom McKimson]] (the older) \u2014 who also worked as animators along with two sisters Anabel and Aylce McKimson.<ref name=\"Michael Barrier.com-Interviews: Robert McKimson\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cogenweb.com/yuma/data/newspaper/McKimson.htm|title=Robert McKimson|website=www.cogenweb.com|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> Charles was frequently part of McKimson's unit at Warner Bros.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/mckimson_bob.htm Lambiek Comiclopedia article.]\n* {{IMDb name|id=0571781|name=Robert McKimson}}\n{{Looney Tunes & Merrie Melodies}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McKimson, Robert}}\n[[Category:1910 births]]\n[[Category:1977 deaths]]\n[[Category:American animators]]\n[[Category:American animated film directors]]\n[[Category:Artists from Denver]]\n[[Category:Burials at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Animation Studios people]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros.

Cartoons]] and later [[DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]]. He wrote and directed many animated cartoon shorts starring [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], [[Porky Pig]], [[Foghorn Leghorn]], [[Hippety Hopper]], The [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]] and among other characters. He was also well known for defining [[Bugs Bunny]]'s look in the [[development of Bugs Bunny|1943]] short ''[[Tortoise Wins by a Hare]]''.\n\n==Career==\nBorn in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], McKimson spent 10 years gaining an art education. He then worked for [[Walt Disney]], stayed with [[List of assets owned by The Walt Disney Company|Disney's studio]] for two years and then joined the [[Romer Grey]] Studio located in [[Altadena, California]], in 1930, a would-be animation shop started by the son of Western author [[Zane Grey]], and financed by Zane Grey's wife. Several cartoons were animated at the Romer Grey Studio, but due to the [[Great Depression]], the studio was unable to close a distribution deal. None of the shorts were released, with only a handful of them being completed (only one of them is known to exist today).\n\nAt the same time he began working for Grey, McKimson was hired by [[Harman and Ising|Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising]], first doing the ink-and-paint duties for the very first ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', then becoming an [[Animator#Inbetweeners and cleanup artists|in-betweener]] before becoming an animator by 1931, when the Romer Grey Studio shut down. At that time he had an accident that gave him a concussion. As a result, he was able to visualize better,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} thus increasing his production and animation. He was the head animator and go-to guy in the late 1930s at the studio, which overwhelmed him. Eventually he worked exclusively with [[Bob Clampett]].<ref name=\"Michael Barrier.com-Interviews: Robert McKimson\">[http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Interviews/McKimson/McKimson.html], Michael Barrier.com-Interviews: Robert McKimson</ref> He was offered a directorial position by [[Leon Schlesinger]] in 1937, but declined, allowing the position to go to animator [[Chuck Jones]].<ref name=\"Michael Barrier.com-Interviews: Robert McKimson\"/> He accepted his own directorial position in late 1944, when [[Frank Tashlin]] left Warner Bros. to direct live-action films.<ref name=\"Michael Barrier.com-Feedback: Frank Tashlin Interview\">[http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Feedback/feedback_tashlin_interview.htm], Michael Barrier.com-Feedback: Frank Tashlin Interview</ref>\n\nMcKimson created characters like [[Foghorn Leghorn]] and the [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]], as well as directing every [[Hippety Hopper]]/[[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]] pairing. He also created [[Speedy Gonzales]] for the 1953 short ''[[Cat-Tails for Two]]'' and directed many others periodically (along with Freleng and other directors) for the remainder of his theatrical career.\n\n[[Image:Pop im Pop.png|thumb|A still from the 1950 Hippety Hopper/Sylvester short ''[[Pop 'im Pop!]]''. This cartoon also introduced Sylvester's son, Sylvester Junior.]]\nMcKimson's first directorial work that he finished, (Frank Tashlin left the cartoon incomplete upon departing) ''[[Daffy Doodles]]'', Daffy draws [[moustache]]s on all the pre-drawn (and even some natural) faces in his sight, was released in early April 1946. His third cartoon entitled ''[[Acrobatty Bunny]]'' would be the first [[Bugs Bunny]] short Mckimson directed. It was released in June 1946.\n\nIn 1953, the Warner Bros. cartoon studio laid off most of its staff for a period of six months due to the 3-D fad at the time, which Jack Warner found to be too costly a process to use for animated cartoons. After the studio re-opened, Freleng and Jones quickly re-assembled their respective units, but McKimson discovered every member of his previous team, apart from writer [[Tedd Pierce]] and background painter Richard H. Thomas, refused to work with him again.{{why|date=April 2014}} At the start of this period, McKimson animated on three of his own shorts, ''[[The Hole Idea]]'', ''[[Dime to Retire]]'', and ''Too Hop to Handle''. (in fact, he was the sole animator credited on ''[[The Hole Idea]]'') <ref name=\"Warner Bros. Cartoon Releases - 1955\">[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0571781/bio], Warner Bros. Cartoon Releases - 1955</ref> Soon, McKimson assembled a new team of artists, including layout man/background painter [[Robert Gribbroek]] and animators [[Warren Batchelder]], [[Ted Bonnicksen]], and [[George Grandpre]]. [[Tom Ray]] and [[Keith Darling]] helped at various points, while Russ Dyson briefly worked with Mckimson in 1956 until Dyson's death that year. McKimson's better known efforts would include ''[[Hillbilly Hare]]'', ''[[A-Lad-In His Lamp]]'', ''[[Stupor Duck]]'', ''[[The Windblown Hare]]'', ''[[Walky Talky Hawky]]'', and ''[[Big Top Bunny]]''.\n\n==Later career==\nMcKimson continued working at Warner's Cartoon Studio as it began to lose staff (including such key personnel such as Jones) in the early 1960s.
