SARPN.</ref>\n\n==Language groups==\n[[File:Map of African languages.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Clickable map showing the traditional language families, subfamilies and major languages spoken in Africa]]\nMost languages spoken in Africa belong to one of three large [[Language family|language families]]: [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]], [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] and [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger\u2013Congo]]. Another hundred belong to smaller families such as [[Ubangian languages|Ubangian]] (sometimes grouped within Niger-Congo) and the various families called [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]], or the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language families mainly spoken outside Africa; the presence of the latter two dates to 2,600 and 1,500 years ago, respectively. In addition, the languages of Africa include several [[unclassified languages]] and [[sign languages]].\n\nThe earliest Afroasiatic languages are associated with the [[Capsian culture]], the Nilo-Saharan languages are linked with the Khartoum Mesolithic/Neolithic, the Niger-Congo languages are correlated with the west and central African hoe-based farming traditions and the Khoisan languages are matched with the south and southeastern Wilton industries.<ref>{{cite book|title=Language, Volume 61, Issues 3-4|date=1985|publisher=Linguistic Society of America|page=695|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=sG8KAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref> More broadly, the Afroasiatic family is tentatively grouped within the [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic]] superfamily, and the Nilo-Saharan and Niger-Congo phyla form the Niger-Saharan macrophylum.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blench|first1=Roger|title=Archaeology, Language, and the African Past|date=2006|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=0759104662|page=108|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=esFy3Po57A8C&pg=PA108#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Afroasiatic languages===\n{{Main article|Afroasiatic languages}}\n[[Afroasiatic languages]] are spoken throughout [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], [[Western Asia]] and parts of the [[Sahel]]. There are approximately 375 Afroasiatic languages spoken by over 400 million people. The main subfamilies of Afroasiatic are [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Chadic languages|Chadic]], [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]], [[Omotic languages|Omotic]], [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] and [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]. The [[Afroasiatic Urheimat]] is uncertain. The family's most extensive branch, the Semitic languages (including [[Arabic]], [[Amharic]] and [[Hebrew]] among others), is the only branch of Afroasiatic that is spoken outside Africa.<ref>{{cite book|authors=Christopher Ehret; Bernd Heine, Derek Nurse (ed.)|title=African Languages: An Introduction|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University|isbn=0521666295|page=290|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=C7XhcYoFxaQC&pg=PA290|accessdate=12 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nSome of the most widely spoken Afroasiatic languages include [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (a Semitic language, and a recent arrival from West Asia), [[Somali language|Somali]] (Cushitic), [[Berber languages|Berber]] (Berber), [[Hausa language|Hausa]] (Chadic), [[Amharic]] (Semitic) and [[Oromo language|Oromo]] (Cushitic). Of the world's surviving language families, Afroasiatic has the longest written history, as both the [[Akkadian language]] of Mesopotamia and [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] are members.\n\n===Nilo-Saharan languages===\n{{Main article|Nilo-Saharan languages}}\n\n[[Nilo-Saharan languages]] consist of a hundred diverse languages. The family has a speech area that stretches from the [[Nile Valley]] to northern [[Tanzania]] and into [[Nigeria]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]], with the [[Songhay languages]] along the middle reaches of the [[Niger River]] as a geographic outlier. Genetic linkage between these languages has not been conclusively demonstrated, and among linguists, support for the proposal is sparse.<ref>Lyle Campbell & Mauricio J. Mixco, ''A Glossary of Historical Linguistics'' (2007, University of Utah Press)</ref><ref>P.H. Matthews, ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of Linguistics'' (2007, 2nd edition, Oxford)</ref> The languages share some unusual [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], but if they are related, most of the branches must have undergone major restructuring since diverging from their common ancestor. The inclusion of the [[Songhay languages]] is questionable, and doubts have been raised over the [[Koman languages|Koman]], [[Gumuz language|Gumuz]] and [[Kadu languages|Kadu]] branches.\n\nSome of the better known Nilo-Saharan languages are [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], [[Fur language|Fur]], [[Songhay language|Songhay]], [[Nobiin language|Nobiin]] and the widespread [[Nilotic languages|Nilotic family]], which includes the [[Luo dialect|Luo]], [[Dinka language|Dinka]] and [[Maasai language|Maasai]]. The Nilo-Saharan languages are [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]].\n\n===Niger\u2013Congo languages===\n{{Main article|Niger\u2013Congo languages}}\n\nThe [[Niger\u2013Congo languages]] constitute the largest language family spoken in [[West Africa]] and perhaps the world in terms of the number of languages. One of its salient features is an elaborate [[noun class]] system with  grammatical [[agreement (linguistics)|concord]]. A large majority of languages of this family are [[tonal language|tonal]] such as [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Akan language|Ashanti]] and [[Ewe language]]. A major branch of Niger\u2013Congo languages is the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] phylum, which has a wider speech area than the rest of the family (see Niger\u2013Congo B (Bantu) in the map above).\n\nThe [[Niger\u2013Kordofanian languages|Niger\u2013Kordofanian]] language family, joining Niger\u2013Congo with the [[Kordofanian languages]] of south-central [[Sudan]], was proposed in the 1950s by [[Joseph Greenberg]]. Today, linguists often use \"Niger\u2013Congo\" to refer to this entire family, including Kordofanian as a subfamily. One reason for this is that it is not clear whether Kordofanian was the first branch to diverge from rest of Niger\u2013Congo. [[Mande languages|Mande]] has been claimed to be equally or more divergent. Niger\u2013Congo is generally accepted by linguists, though a few question the inclusion of Mande and [[Dogon languages|Dogon]], and there is no conclusive evidence for the inclusion of [[Ubangian languages|Ubangian]].\n\n===Other language families===\nSeveral languages spoken in Africa belong to language families concentrated or originating outside the African continent.\n\n====Austronesian====\n[[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] belongs to the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] languages and is the westernmost branch of the family. It is the national and co-official language of [[Madagascar]] and one of Malagasy dialects called [[Bushi language|Bushi]] is also spoken in [[Mayotte]].\n\nThe ancestors of the Malagasy people migrated to Madagascar around 1,500 years ago from Southeast Asia, more specifically the island of Borneo. The origins of how they arrived to Madagascar remains a mystery, however the Austronesians are known for their seafaring culture. Despite the geographical isolation, Malagasy still has strong resemblance to [[Barito languages]] especially the [[Ma'anyan language]] of southern Borneo.\n\nWith more than 20 million speakers, Malagasy is one of the most widely spoken of the Austronesian languages.\n\n====Indo-European====\n[[Afrikaans]] is [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], as is most of the vocabulary of most African [[creole language]]s. Afrikaans evolved from the [[Dutch language|Dutch vernacular]]<ref>K. Pithouse, C. Mitchell, R.

In [[Namibia]] it is the [[lingua franca]] and in [[Botswana]] and [[Zimbabwe]] it is a minority language of roughly several ten thousand people. Overall 15 to 20 million people are estimated to speak Afrikaans.\n\nSince the [[Colonialism|colonial]] era, Indo-European languages such as [[Afrikaans]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] have held official status in many countries, and are widely spoken, generally as [[lingua franca]]s. (''See [[African French]] and [[Portuguese in Africa|African Portuguese]]''.) [[German language|German]] was once used in [[German colonial empire|Germany's colonies]] there from the late 1800s until World War I, when Britain and France took over and revoked German's official status. Despite this, German is still spoken in [[Namibia]], mostly among the [[White Namibians|white population]]. Although it lost its official status in the 1990s, it has been redesignated as a national language. [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] such as [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] are spoken by [[South Asia]]n expatriates exclusively. In earlier historical times, other Indo-European languages could be found in various parts of the continent, such as [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek]] in Egypt, [[Latin]] and [[Vandalic]] in North Africa and [[Persian language|Modern Persian]] in the [[Horn of Africa]].\n\n====Small families====\nThe three small [[Khoisan]] families of southern Africa have not been shown to be closely related to any other major language family. In addition, there are various other families that have not been demonstrated to belong to one of these families. (The questionable branches of Nilo-Saharan were covered above, and are not repeated here.)\n*[[Mande languages|Mande]], some 70 languages, including the major languages of [[Mali]] and [[Guinea]]. These are generally thought to be divergent Niger\u2013Congo, but debate persists.\n*[[Ubangian languages|Ubangian]], some 70 languages, centered on the languages of the [[Central African Republic]]; may be Niger\u2013Congo\n*[[Khoe languages|Khoe]], around 10 languages, the primary family of Khoisan languages of [[Namibia]] and [[Botswana]]\n*[[Sandawe language|Sandawe]], an isolate of Tanzania, possibly related to Khoe\n*[[Kx'a languages|Kx'a]], a language of Southern Africa\n*[[Tuu languages|Tuu]], or Taa-\u01c3Kwi, two surviving languages\n*[[Hadza language|Hadza]], an isolate of Tanzania\n*[[Bangime language|Bangime]], a likely isolate of Mali\n*[[Jalaa language|Jalaa]], a likely isolate of Nigeria\n*[[Laal language|Laal]], a possible isolate of Chad\n\n''[[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]]'' is a term of convenience covering some 30 languages spoken by around 300,000\u2013400,000 people. There are five Khoisan families that have not been shown to be related to each other: [[Khoe languages|Khoe]], [[Tuu languages|Tuu]] and [[Kx'a languages|Kx'a]], which are found mainly in [[Namibia]] and [[Botswana]], as well as [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]] of [[Tanzania]], which are [[language isolate]]s. A striking feature of Khoisan languages, and the reason they are often grouped together, is their use of [[click consonant]]s. Some neighbouring Bantu languages (notably [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]]) have clicks as well, but these were adopted from Khoisan languages. The Khoisan languages are also [[tonal language|tonal]].\n\n====Creole languages====\nDue partly to its multilingualism and its colonial past, a substantial proportion of the world's [[creole language]]s are to be found in Africa. Some are based on Indo-European languages (e.g. [[Sierra Leone Krio language|Krio]] from English in [[Sierra Leone]] and the very similar [[West African Pidgin English|Pidgin]] in [[Nigeria]]; [[Ghana]] and parts of [[Cameroon]]; [[Cape Verdean Creole]] in [[Cape Verde]] and [[Guinea-Bissau Creole]] in [[Guinea-Bissau]] and [[Senegal]], all from Portuguese; [[Seychellois Creole]] in the [[Seychelles]] and [[Mauritian Creole]] in [[Mauritius]], both from French); some are based on Arabic (e.g. [[Juba Arabic]] in the southern [[Sudan]], or [[Nubi language|Nubi]] in parts of [[Uganda]] and [[Kenya]]); some are based on local languages (e.g. [[Sango language|Sango]], the main language of the [[Central African Republic]]); while in [[Cameroon]] a creole based on French, English and local African languages known as [[Camfranglais]] has started to become popular.\n\n====Unclassified languages====\n{{further|:Category:Unclassified languages of Africa}}\nA fair number of [[unclassified languages]] are reported in Africa. Many remain unclassified simply for lack of data; among the better-investigated ones that continue to resist easy classification are:\n\n* possibly Afroasiatic: [[Ongota language|Ongota]], [[Gomba language|Gomba]]\n* possibly Nilo-Saharan: [[Shabo language|Shabo]]\n* possibly Niger\u2013Congo: [[Jalaa language|Jalaa]], [[Mbre language|Mbre]], [[Bayot language|Bayot]]\n* possibly Khoe: [[Kwadi language|Kwadi]]\n* unknown: [[Laal language|Laal]], [[Mpre language|Mpre]]\nOf these, [[Jalaa language|Jalaa]] is perhaps the most likely to be an isolate.\n\nLess-well investigated languages include [[Rimba language|Irimba]], [[Luo language (Cameroon)|Luo]], [[Mawa language (Nigeria)|Mawa]], [[Rer Bare]] (possibly Bantu), [[Bete language (Nigeria)|Bete]] (evidently Jukunoid), [[Bung language|Bung]] (unclear), [[Kujarg\u00e9 language|Kujarge]] (evidently Chadic), [[Lufu language|Lufu]] (Jukunoid), [[Meroitic language|Meroitic]] (possibly Afroasiatic), [[Oropom language|Oropom]] (possibly spurious) and [[Weyto language|Weyto]] (evidently Cushitic). Several of these are extinct, and adequate comparative data is thus unlikely to be forthcoming.

Austin, Oliver Bond, [[Monik Charette]], David Nathan & Peter Sells (eds). ''Proceedings of Conference on Language Documentation and Linguistic Theory 2''. London: SOAS.</ref> list a number of African languages that have been classified as [[language isolate]]s at one point or another. Many of these are simply unclassified, but Hombert & Philippson believe Africa has about twenty language families, including isolates. Beside the possibilities listed above, there are:\n\n*[[Aasax language|Aasax]] or Aramanik ([[Tanzania]]) ([[South Cushitic languages|South Cushitic]]? contains non-Cushitic lexicon)\n*[[Imeraguen language|Imeraguen]] ([[Mauritania]]) - [[Hassaniyya]] Arabic restructured on an Az\u00ear ([[Soninke language|Soninke]]) base\n*Kara ([[Fer language|Fer]]?) ([[Central African Republic]])\n*[[Oblo language|Oblo]] ([[Cameroon]]) (Adamawa? Extinct?)\n<!--*[[Yeni language|Yeni]] ([[Cameroon]]) is clearly Mambiloid-->\n\n[[Roger Blench]] notes a couple additional possibilities:\n*[[Defaka language|Defaka]] ([[Nigeria]])\n*[[Dompo language|Dompo]] ([[Ghana]])\n\n====Sign languages====\n{{See also|List of sign languages#Africa}}\nMany African countries have national sign languages, such as [[Algerian Sign Language]], [[Tunisian Sign Language]], [[Ethiopian Sign Language]]. Other sign languages are restricted to small areas or single villages, such as [[Adamorobe Sign Language]] in [[Ghana]]. Tanzania has seven, one for each of its schools for the Deaf, all of which are discouraged. Not much is known, since little has been published on these languages\n\nSign language systems extant in Africa include the [[Paget Gorman Sign System]] used in Namibia and [[Angola]], the [[Sudanese sign languages|Sudanese Sign]] languages used in [[Sudan]] and [[South Sudan]], the [[Arab sign-language family|Arab Sign]] languages used across the Arab Mideast, the [[French Sign Language family|Francosign]] languages used in [[Francophone Africa]] and other areas such as [[Ghana]] and [[Tunisia]], and the [[Tanzanian sign languages|Tanzanian Sign]] languages used in [[Tanzania]].\n\n==Language in Africa==\n[[File:Endonyms of Africa.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Africa with native place names]]\nThroughout the long multilingual history of the African continent, African languages have been subject to phenomena like language contact, language expansion, language shift and language death. A case in point is the [[Bantu expansion]], in which Bantu-speaking peoples expanded over most of [[Sub-Equatorial Africa]], displacing Khoi-San speaking peoples from much of [[Southeast Africa]] and [[Southern Africa]] and other peoples from [[Central Africa]]. Another example is the Arab expansion in the 7th century, which led to the extension of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] from its homeland in Asia, into much of North Africa and the Horn of Africa.\n\n[[Trade language]]s are another age-old phenomenon in the African linguistic landscape. Cultural and linguistic innovations spread along trade routes and languages of peoples dominant in trade developed into languages of wider communication ([[lingua franca]]). Of particular importance in this respect are [[Berber language|Berber]] (North and West Africa), [[Dioula language|Jula]] (western West Africa), [[Fula language|Fulfulde]] (West Africa), [[Hausa language|Hausa]] (West Africa), [[Lingala language|Lingala]] (Congo), [[Swahili language|Swahili]] (Southeast Africa), [[Somali language|Somali]] (Horn of Africa) and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (North Africa and Horn of Africa).\n\nAfter gaining independence, many African countries, in the search for national unity, selected one language, generally the former colonial language, to be used in government and education. However, in recent years, African countries have become increasingly supportive of maintaining linguistic diversity.

This can cause divergence of a language on either side of a border (especially when the official languages are different), for example, in orthographic standards. Some notable cross-border languages include [[Berber languages|Berber]] (which stretches across much of North Africa and some parts of West Africa), [[Somali language|Somali]] (stretches across most of the Horn of Africa), Swahili (spoken in the African Great Lakes region), [[Fula language|Fula]] (in the Sahel and West Africa) and [[Luo languages|Luo]] (in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan and Sudan).\n\nSome prominent Africans such as former [[Mali|Malian]] president and former [[Chairperson of the African Union Commission|Chairman of the African Commission]], [[Alpha Oumar Konar\u00e9]], have referred to cross-border languages as a factor that can promote African unity.<ref>[http://www.acalan.org/ African languages for Africa's development] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524135600/http://www.acalan.org/ |date=24 May 2006 }} ACALAN (French & English).</ref>\n\n===Language change and planning===\nLanguage is not static in Africa any more than on other continents. In addition to the (likely modest) impact of borders, there are also cases of [[dialect levelling]] (such as in [[Igbo language|Igbo]] and probably many others), [[Koin\u00e9 language|koin\u00e9s]] (such as [[N'Ko language|N'Ko]] and possibly [[Runyakitara language|Runyakitara]]) and emergence of new dialects (such as [[Sheng (linguistics)|Sheng]]). In some countries, there are official efforts to develop [[Standard language|standardized language]] versions.\n\nThere are also many less widely spoken languages that may be considered [[endangered language]]s.\n\n===Demographics===\n{{Further|Demographics of Africa}}\nOf the 1 billion Africans (in 2009), about 17 percent speak an [[varieties of Arabic|Arabic dialect]]{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}. About 10 percent speak [[Swahili language|Swahili]]{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}, the lingua franca of Southeast Africa; about 5 percent speak a [[Berber languages|Berber]] dialect{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}; and about 5 percent speak [[Hausa language|Hausa]], which serves as a lingua franca in much of the Sahel. Other important West African languages are [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]] and [[Fula language|Fula]]. Major Horn of Africa languages are [[Amharic language|Amharic]], [[Oromo language|Oromo]] and [[Somali language|Somali]]. Important South African languages are [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Afrikaans]].<ref>''[[The Economist]]'', \"Tongues under threat\", 22 January 2011, p. 58.</ref>\n\nEnglish, French and Portuguese are important languages in Africa. About 130 million, 115 million and 35 million Africans, respectively, speak them as either native or secondary languages. Portuguese has become the national language of Angola and  S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, and Portuguese is the official language of Mozambique. The economies of Angola and Mozambique are quickly becoming economic powerhouses in Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angola.org/index.php?page=culture|title=The Embassy of the Republic of Angola - Culture|publisher=}}</ref> Through (among other factors) sheer demographic weight, Africans are increasingly taking ownership {{citation needed|date=December 2015}} of these three world languages as they are having an ever-greater influence on the research, economic growth and development in the African countries where English, French and Portuguese are spoken.\n\n==Linguistic features==\nSome linguistic features are particularly common among languages spoken in Africa, whereas others are less common. Such shared traits probably are not due to a common origin of all African languages. Instead, some may be due to [[language contact]] (resulting in borrowing) and specific idioms and phrases may be due to a similar cultural background.\n\n===Phonological===\nSome widespread phonetic features include:\n* certain types of consonants, such as [[implosive consonant|implosives]] ({{IPA|/\u0253a/}}), [[ejective consonant|ejectives]] ({{IPA|/k\u02bca/}}), the [[labiodental flap]] and in southern Africa, [[Click consonant|clicks]] ({{IPA|/\u01c2a/}}, {{IPA|/\u1d51\u01c3a/}}). True implosives are rare outside Africa, and clicks and the flap almost unheard of.\n* doubly articulated [[Labial-velar consonant|labial-velar stops]] like {{IPA|/k\u0361pa/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261\u0361ba/}} are found in places south of the Sahara.\n* [[prenasalized consonant]]s, like {{IPA|/mpa/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b\u0261a/}}, are widespread in Africa but not common outside it.\n* sequences of stops and fricatives at the beginnings of words, such as {{IPA|/fsa/}}, {{IPA|/pta/}} and {{IPA|/dt\u0361sk\u0361x\u02bca/}}.\n* nasal stops which only occur with nasal vowels, such as {{IPA|[ba]}} vs. {{IPA|[m\u00e3]}} (but both {{IPA|[pa]}} and {{IPA|[p\u00e3]}}), especially in West Africa.\n* vowels contrasting an [[advanced tongue root|advanced or retracted tongue]], commonly called \"tense\" and \"lax\".\n* simple [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] systems which are used for grammatical purposes.\n\nSounds that are relatively uncommon in African languages include [[uvular consonant]]s, [[diphthong]]s and [[front vowel|front rounded vowels]]\n\n[[Tonal language]]s are found throughout the world but are predominantly used in Africa. Both the Nilo-Saharan and the Khoi-San phyla are fully tonal. The large majority of the Niger\u2013Congo languages are also tonal. Tonal languages are also found in the Omotic, Chadic and South & East Cushitic branches of Afroasiatic. The most common type of tonal system opposes two tone levels, High (H) and Low (L). [[Tone contour|Contour tone]]s do occur, and can often be analysed as two or more tones in succession on a single syllable. ''Tone melodies'' play an important role, meaning that it is often possible to state significant generalizations by separating tone sequences (\"melodies\") from the segments that bear them. [[Tonal sandhi]] processes like tone spread, tone shift, downstep and downdrift are common in African languages.\n<!--Many ethnic groups living in the rain forests of Africa transmit messages from one village to another by use of so called ''talking drums''.\nAfrican languages differ in the number of tone levels they have. Most African tonal languages have a two tone system.-->\n\n===Syntactic===\nWidespread syntactical structures include the common use of adjectival verbs and the expression of comparison by means of a verb 'to surpass'. The Niger\u2013Congo languages have large numbers of genders ([[noun class]]es) which cause agreement in verbs and other words. [[grammatical case|Case]], [[grammatical tense|tense]] and other categories may be distinguished only by tone.\n\n===Semantic===\nQuite often, only one term is used for both animal and meat; the word ''nama'' or ''nyama'' for animal/meat is particularly widespread in otherwise widely divergent African languages.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe following is a table displaying the number of speakers of given languages within Africa:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n|-\n!width=15%|Language\n!width=15%|Family\n!width=15% data-sort-type=\"number\"|Native speakers (L1)\n!width=30%|Official status per country\n|-\n| [[Abron language|Abron]] || [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] ||1,393,000<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/abr|title=Abron|website=Ethnologue|language=en|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref>\n|| {{flag|Ghana}}\n|-\n| [[Afar language|Afar]] || [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] ||  || Spoken in  {{flag|Djibouti}}, {{flag|Eritrea}}, {{flag|Ethiopia}}\n|-\n| [[Afrikaans]] || [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] || 7,200,000<ref name=\"statssa-2011-language-1\">{{cite book |title=Census 2011: Census in brief |url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/census/census_2011/census_products/Census_2011_Census_in_brief.pdf |publisher=Statistics South Africa |location=Pretoria |year=2012 |isbn=9780621413885 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513171240/http://www.statssa.gov.za/census/census_2011/census_products/Census_2011_Census_in_brief.pdf |archive-date=13 May 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> || National language in {{flag|Namibia}}, co-official in {{flag|South Africa}}\n|-\n| [[Akan language|Akan]] || [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger\u2013Congo]] || 11,000,000<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Nationalencyklopedin]] \"V\u00e4rldens 100 st\u00f6rsta spr\u00e5k 2007\" The World's 100 Largest Languages in 2007</ref> || None.

SARPN.</ref>\n\n==Language groups==\n[[File:Map of African languages.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Clickable map showing the traditional language families, subfamilies and major languages spoken in Africa]]\nMost languages spoken in Africa belong to one of three large [[Language family|language families]]: [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]], [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] and [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger\u2013Congo]]. Another hundred belong to smaller families such as [[Ubangian languages|Ubangian]] (sometimes grouped within Niger-Congo) and the various families called [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]], or the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language families mainly spoken outside Africa; the presence of the latter two dates to 2,600 and 1,500 years ago, respectively. In addition, the languages of Africa include several [[unclassified languages]] and [[sign languages]].\n\nThe earliest Afroasiatic languages are associated with the [[Capsian culture]], the Nilo-Saharan languages are linked with the Khartoum Mesolithic/Neolithic, the Niger-Congo languages are correlated with the west and central African hoe-based farming traditions and the Khoisan languages are matched with the south and southeastern Wilton industries.<ref>{{cite book|title=Language, Volume 61, Issues 3-4|date=1985|publisher=Linguistic Society of America|page=695|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=sG8KAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref> More broadly, the Afroasiatic family is tentatively grouped within the [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic]] superfamily, and the Nilo-Saharan and Niger-Congo phyla form the Niger-Saharan macrophylum.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blench|first1=Roger|title=Archaeology, Language, and the African Past|date=2006|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=0759104662|page=108|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=esFy3Po57A8C&pg=PA108#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Afroasiatic languages===\n{{Main article|Afroasiatic languages}}\n[[Afroasiatic languages]] are spoken throughout [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], [[Western Asia]] and parts of the [[Sahel]]. There are approximately 375 Afroasiatic languages spoken by over 400 million people. The main subfamilies of Afroasiatic are [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Chadic languages|Chadic]], [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]], [[Omotic languages|Omotic]], [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] and [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]. The [[Afroasiatic Urheimat]] is uncertain. The family's most extensive branch, the Semitic languages (including [[Arabic]], [[Amharic]] and [[Hebrew]] among others), is the only branch of Afroasiatic that is spoken outside Africa.<ref>{{cite book|authors=Christopher Ehret; Bernd Heine, Derek Nurse (ed.)|title=African Languages: An Introduction|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University|isbn=0521666295|page=290|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=C7XhcYoFxaQC&pg=PA290|accessdate=12 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nSome of the most widely spoken Afroasiatic languages include [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (a Semitic language, and a recent arrival from West Asia), [[Somali language|Somali]] (Cushitic), [[Berber languages|Berber]] (Berber), [[Hausa language|Hausa]] (Chadic), [[Amharic]] (Semitic) and [[Oromo language|Oromo]] (Cushitic). Of the world's surviving language families, Afroasiatic has the longest written history, as both the [[Akkadian language]] of Mesopotamia and [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] are members.\n\n===Nilo-Saharan languages===\n{{Main article|Nilo-Saharan languages}}\n\n[[Nilo-Saharan languages]] consist of a hundred diverse languages. The family has a speech area that stretches from the [[Nile Valley]] to northern [[Tanzania]] and into [[Nigeria]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]], with the [[Songhay languages]] along the middle reaches of the [[Niger River]] as a geographic outlier. Genetic linkage between these languages has not been conclusively demonstrated, and among linguists, support for the proposal is sparse.<ref>Lyle Campbell & Mauricio J. Mixco, ''A Glossary of Historical Linguistics'' (2007, University of Utah Press)</ref><ref>P.H. Matthews, ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of Linguistics'' (2007, 2nd edition, Oxford)</ref> The languages share some unusual [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], but if they are related, most of the branches must have undergone major restructuring since diverging from their common ancestor. The inclusion of the [[Songhay languages]] is questionable, and doubts have been raised over the [[Koman languages|Koman]], [[Gumuz language|Gumuz]] and [[Kadu languages|Kadu]] branches.\n\nSome of the better known Nilo-Saharan languages are [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], [[Fur language|Fur]], [[Songhay language|Songhay]], [[Nobiin language|Nobiin]] and the widespread [[Nilotic languages|Nilotic family]], which includes the [[Luo dialect|Luo]], [[Dinka language|Dinka]] and [[Maasai language|Maasai]]. The Nilo-Saharan languages are [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]].\n\n===Niger\u2013Congo languages===\n{{Main article|Niger\u2013Congo languages}}\n\nThe [[Niger\u2013Congo languages]] constitute the largest language family spoken in [[West Africa]] and perhaps the world in terms of the number of languages. One of its salient features is an elaborate [[noun class]] system with  grammatical [[agreement (linguistics)|concord]]. A large majority of languages of this family are [[tonal language|tonal]] such as [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Akan language|Ashanti]] and [[Ewe language]]. A major branch of Niger\u2013Congo languages is the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] phylum, which has a wider speech area than the rest of the family (see Niger\u2013Congo B (Bantu) in the map above).\n\nThe [[Niger\u2013Kordofanian languages|Niger\u2013Kordofanian]] language family, joining Niger\u2013Congo with the [[Kordofanian languages]] of south-central [[Sudan]], was proposed in the 1950s by [[Joseph Greenberg]]. Today, linguists often use \"Niger\u2013Congo\" to refer to this entire family, including Kordofanian as a subfamily. One reason for this is that it is not clear whether Kordofanian was the first branch to diverge from rest of Niger\u2013Congo. [[Mande languages|Mande]] has been claimed to be equally or more divergent. Niger\u2013Congo is generally accepted by linguists, though a few question the inclusion of Mande and [[Dogon languages|Dogon]], and there is no conclusive evidence for the inclusion of [[Ubangian languages|Ubangian]].\n\n===Other language families===\nSeveral languages spoken in Africa belong to language families concentrated or originating outside the African continent.\n\n====Austronesian====\n[[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] belongs to the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] languages and is the westernmost branch of the family. It is the national and co-official language of [[Madagascar]] and one of Malagasy dialects called [[Bushi language|Bushi]] is also spoken in [[Mayotte]].\n\nThe ancestors of the Malagasy people migrated to Madagascar around 1,500 years ago from Southeast Asia, more specifically the island of Borneo. The origins of how they arrived to Madagascar remains a mystery, however the Austronesians are known for their seafaring culture. Despite the geographical isolation, Malagasy still has strong resemblance to [[Barito languages]] especially the [[Ma'anyan language]] of southern Borneo.\n\nWith more than 20 million speakers, Malagasy is one of the most widely spoken of the Austronesian languages.\n\n====Indo-European====\n[[Afrikaans]] is [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], as is most of the vocabulary of most African [[creole language]]s. Afrikaans evolved from the [[Dutch language|Dutch vernacular]]<ref>K. Pithouse, C. Mitchell, R.

In [[Namibia]] it is the [[lingua franca]] and in [[Botswana]] and [[Zimbabwe]] it is a minority language of roughly several ten thousand people. Overall 15 to 20 million people are estimated to speak Afrikaans.\n\nSince the [[Colonialism|colonial]] era, Indo-European languages such as [[Afrikaans]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] have held official status in many countries, and are widely spoken, generally as [[lingua franca]]s. (''See [[African French]] and [[Portuguese in Africa|African Portuguese]]''.) [[German language|German]] was once used in [[German colonial empire|Germany's colonies]] there from the late 1800s until World War I, when Britain and France took over and revoked German's official status. Despite this, German is still spoken in [[Namibia]], mostly among the [[White Namibians|white population]]. Although it lost its official status in the 1990s, it has been redesignated as a national language. [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] such as [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] are spoken by [[South Asia]]n expatriates exclusively. In earlier historical times, other Indo-European languages could be found in various parts of the continent, such as [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek]] in Egypt, [[Latin]] and [[Vandalic]] in North Africa and [[Persian language|Modern Persian]] in the [[Horn of Africa]].\n\n====Small families====\nThe three small [[Khoisan]] families of southern Africa have not been shown to be closely related to any other major language family. In addition, there are various other families that have not been demonstrated to belong to one of these families. (The questionable branches of Nilo-Saharan were covered above, and are not repeated here.)\n*[[Mande languages|Mande]], some 70 languages, including the major languages of [[Mali]] and [[Guinea]]. These are generally thought to be divergent Niger\u2013Congo, but debate persists.\n*[[Ubangian languages|Ubangian]], some 70 languages, centered on the languages of the [[Central African Republic]]; may be Niger\u2013Congo\n*[[Khoe languages|Khoe]], around 10 languages, the primary family of Khoisan languages of [[Namibia]] and [[Botswana]]\n*[[Sandawe language|Sandawe]], an isolate of Tanzania, possibly related to Khoe\n*[[Kx'a languages|Kx'a]], a language of Southern Africa\n*[[Tuu languages|Tuu]], or Taa-\u01c3Kwi, two surviving languages\n*[[Hadza language|Hadza]], an isolate of Tanzania\n*[[Bangime language|Bangime]], a likely isolate of Mali\n*[[Jalaa language|Jalaa]], a likely isolate of Nigeria\n*[[Laal language|Laal]], a possible isolate of Chad\n\n''[[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]]'' is a term of convenience covering some 30 languages spoken by around 300,000\u2013400,000 people. There are five Khoisan families that have not been shown to be related to each other: [[Khoe languages|Khoe]], [[Tuu languages|Tuu]] and [[Kx'a languages|Kx'a]], which are found mainly in [[Namibia]] and [[Botswana]], as well as [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]] of [[Tanzania]], which are [[language isolate]]s. A striking feature of Khoisan languages, and the reason they are often grouped together, is their use of [[click consonant]]s. Some neighbouring Bantu languages (notably [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]]) have clicks as well, but these were adopted from Khoisan languages. The Khoisan languages are also [[tonal language|tonal]].\n\n====Creole languages====\nDue partly to its multilingualism and its colonial past, a substantial proportion of the world's [[creole language]]s are to be found in Africa. Some are based on Indo-European languages (e.g. [[Sierra Leone Krio language|Krio]] from English in [[Sierra Leone]] and the very similar [[West African Pidgin English|Pidgin]] in [[Nigeria]]; [[Ghana]] and parts of [[Cameroon]]; [[Cape Verdean Creole]] in [[Cape Verde]] and [[Guinea-Bissau Creole]] in [[Guinea-Bissau]] and [[Senegal]], all from Portuguese; [[Seychellois Creole]] in the [[Seychelles]] and [[Mauritian Creole]] in [[Mauritius]], both from French); some are based on Arabic (e.g. [[Juba Arabic]] in the southern [[Sudan]], or [[Nubi language|Nubi]] in parts of [[Uganda]] and [[Kenya]]); some are based on local languages (e.g. [[Sango language|Sango]], the main language of the [[Central African Republic]]); while in [[Cameroon]] a creole based on French, English and local African languages known as [[Camfranglais]] has started to become popular.\n\n====Unclassified languages====\n{{further|:Category:Unclassified languages of Africa}}\nA fair number of [[unclassified languages]] are reported in Africa. Many remain unclassified simply for lack of data; among the better-investigated ones that continue to resist easy classification are:\n\n* possibly Afroasiatic: [[Ongota language|Ongota]], [[Gomba language|Gomba]]\n* possibly Nilo-Saharan: [[Shabo language|Shabo]]\n* possibly Niger\u2013Congo: [[Jalaa language|Jalaa]], [[Mbre language|Mbre]], [[Bayot language|Bayot]]\n* possibly Khoe: [[Kwadi language|Kwadi]]\n* unknown: [[Laal language|Laal]], [[Mpre language|Mpre]]\nOf these, [[Jalaa language|Jalaa]] is perhaps the most likely to be an isolate.\n\nLess-well investigated languages include [[Rimba language|Irimba]], [[Luo language (Cameroon)|Luo]], [[Mawa language (Nigeria)|Mawa]], [[Rer Bare]] (possibly Bantu), [[Bete language (Nigeria)|Bete]] (evidently Jukunoid), [[Bung language|Bung]] (unclear), [[Kujarg\u00e9 language|Kujarge]] (evidently Chadic), [[Lufu language|Lufu]] (Jukunoid), [[Meroitic language|Meroitic]] (possibly Afroasiatic), [[Oropom language|Oropom]] (possibly spurious) and [[Weyto language|Weyto]] (evidently Cushitic). Several of these are extinct, and adequate comparative data is thus unlikely to be forthcoming.

Many of these are simply unclassified, but Hombert & Philippson believe Africa has about twenty language families, including isolates. Beside the possibilities listed above, there are:\n\n*[[Aasax language|Aasax]] or Aramanik ([[Tanzania]]) ([[South Cushitic languages|South Cushitic]]? contains non-Cushitic lexicon)\n*[[Imeraguen language|Imeraguen]] ([[Mauritania]]) - [[Hassaniyya]] Arabic restructured on an Az\u00ear ([[Soninke language|Soninke]]) base\n*Kara ([[Fer language|Fer]]?) ([[Central African Republic]])\n*[[Oblo language|Oblo]] ([[Cameroon]]) (Adamawa? Extinct?)\n<!--*[[Yeni language|Yeni]] ([[Cameroon]]) is clearly Mambiloid-->\n\n[[Roger Blench]] notes a couple additional possibilities:\n*[[Defaka language|Defaka]] ([[Nigeria]])\n*[[Dompo language|Dompo]] ([[Ghana]])\n\n====Sign languages====\n{{See also|List of sign languages#Africa}}\nMany African countries have national sign languages, such as [[Algerian Sign Language]], [[Tunisian Sign Language]], [[Ethiopian Sign Language]]. Other sign languages are restricted to small areas or single villages, such as [[Adamorobe Sign Language]] in [[Ghana]]. Tanzania has seven, one for each of its schools for the Deaf, all of which are discouraged. Not much is known, since little has been published on these languages\n\nSign language systems extant in Africa include the [[Paget Gorman Sign System]] used in Namibia and [[Angola]], the [[Sudanese sign languages|Sudanese Sign]] languages used in [[Sudan]] and [[South Sudan]], the [[Arab sign-language family|Arab Sign]] languages used across the Arab Mideast, the [[French Sign Language family|Francosign]] languages used in [[Francophone Africa]] and other areas such as [[Ghana]] and [[Tunisia]], and the [[Tanzanian sign languages|Tanzanian Sign]] languages used in [[Tanzania]].\n\n==Language in Africa==\n[[File:Endonyms of Africa.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Africa with native place names]]\nThroughout the long multilingual history of the African continent, African languages have been subject to phenomena like language contact, language expansion, language shift and language death. A case in point is the [[Bantu expansion]], in which Bantu-speaking peoples expanded over most of [[Sub-Equatorial Africa]], displacing Khoi-San speaking peoples from much of [[Southeast Africa]] and [[Southern Africa]] and other peoples from [[Central Africa]]. Another example is the Arab expansion in the 7th century, which led to the extension of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] from its homeland in Asia, into much of North Africa and the Horn of Africa.\n\n[[Trade language]]s are another age-old phenomenon in the African linguistic landscape. Cultural and linguistic innovations spread along trade routes and languages of peoples dominant in trade developed into languages of wider communication ([[lingua franca]]). Of particular importance in this respect are [[Berber language|Berber]] (North and West Africa), [[Dioula language|Jula]] (western West Africa), [[Fula language|Fulfulde]] (West Africa), [[Hausa language|Hausa]] (West Africa), [[Lingala language|Lingala]] (Congo), [[Swahili language|Swahili]] (Southeast Africa), [[Somali language|Somali]] (Horn of Africa) and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (North Africa and Horn of Africa).\n\nAfter gaining independence, many African countries, in the search for national unity, selected one language, generally the former colonial language, to be used in government and education. However, in recent years, African countries have become increasingly supportive of maintaining linguistic diversity. Language policies that are being developed nowadays are mostly aimed at multilingualism.\n\n===Official languages===\n[[File:Official languages in Africa.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Official languages in Africa:\n{| cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n| {{legend|#FF8C00|[[Afrikaans]]}} || {{legend|#8EB423|[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]}}\n|-\n| {{legend|#19822D|[[Arabic]]}} || {{legend|#DAC716|[[Spanish language|Spanish]]}}\n|-\n| {{legend|#C35A91|[[English language|English]]}} || {{legend|#55433B|[[Swahili language|Swahili]]}}\n|-\n| {{legend|#415096|[[French language|French]]}} || {{legend|#8A8B8D|other languages}}\n|}]]\nBesides the former colonial languages of English, French, Portuguese and Spanish, the following languages are official at the national level in Africa (non-exhaustive list):\n;Afroasiatic\n*[[Arabic]] in [[Algeria]], [[Chad]], [[Comoros]], [[Djibouti]], [[Egypt]], [[Eritrea]], [[Libya]], [[Mauritania]],<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mr.html CIA \u2013 The World Factbook].</ref> [[Morocco]], [[Somalia]],<ref name=\"Charter\">According to article 7 of [http://www.chr.up.ac.za/hr_docs/countries/docs/charterfeb04.pdf ''The Transitional Federal Charter of the Somali Republic''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218004011/http://www.chr.up.ac.za/hr_docs/countries/docs/charterfeb04.pdf |date=18 December 2008 }}: \u201cThe official languages of the Somali Republic shall be Somali (Maay and Maxaatiri) and Arabic.

This can cause divergence of a language on either side of a border (especially when the official languages are different), for example, in orthographic standards. Some notable cross-border languages include [[Berber languages|Berber]] (which stretches across much of North Africa and some parts of West Africa), [[Somali language|Somali]] (stretches across most of the Horn of Africa), Swahili (spoken in the African Great Lakes region), [[Fula language|Fula]] (in the Sahel and West Africa) and [[Luo languages|Luo]] (in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan and Sudan).\n\nSome prominent Africans such as former [[Mali|Malian]] president and former [[Chairperson of the African Union Commission|Chairman of the African Commission]], [[Alpha Oumar Konar\u00e9]], have referred to cross-border languages as a factor that can promote African unity.<ref>[http://www.acalan.org/ African languages for Africa's development] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524135600/http://www.acalan.org/ |date=24 May 2006 }} ACALAN (French & English).</ref>\n\n===Language change and planning===\nLanguage is not static in Africa any more than on other continents. In addition to the (likely modest) impact of borders, there are also cases of [[dialect levelling]] (such as in [[Igbo language|Igbo]] and probably many others), [[Koin\u00e9 language|koin\u00e9s]] (such as [[N'Ko language|N'Ko]] and possibly [[Runyakitara language|Runyakitara]]) and emergence of new dialects (such as [[Sheng (linguistics)|Sheng]]). In some countries, there are official efforts to develop [[Standard language|standardized language]] versions.\n\nThere are also many less widely spoken languages that may be considered [[endangered language]]s.\n\n===Demographics===\n{{Further|Demographics of Africa}}\nOf the 1 billion Africans (in 2009), about 17 percent speak an [[varieties of Arabic|Arabic dialect]]{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}. About 10 percent speak [[Swahili language|Swahili]]{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}, the lingua franca of Southeast Africa; about 5 percent speak a [[Berber languages|Berber]] dialect{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}; and about 5 percent speak [[Hausa language|Hausa]], which serves as a lingua franca in much of the Sahel. Other important West African languages are [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]] and [[Fula language|Fula]]. Major Horn of Africa languages are [[Amharic language|Amharic]], [[Oromo language|Oromo]] and [[Somali language|Somali]]. Important South African languages are [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Afrikaans]].<ref>''[[The Economist]]'', \"Tongues under threat\", 22 January 2011, p. 58.</ref>\n\nEnglish, French and Portuguese are important languages in Africa. About 130 million, 115 million and 35 million Africans, respectively, speak them as either native or secondary languages. Portuguese has become the national language of Angola and  S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, and Portuguese is the official language of Mozambique. The economies of Angola and Mozambique are quickly becoming economic powerhouses in Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angola.org/index.php?page=culture|title=The Embassy of the Republic of Angola - Culture|publisher=}}</ref> Through (among other factors) sheer demographic weight, Africans are increasingly taking ownership {{citation needed|date=December 2015}} of these three world languages as they are having an ever-greater influence on the research, economic growth and development in the African countries where English, French and Portuguese are spoken.\n\n==Linguistic features==\nSome linguistic features are particularly common among languages spoken in Africa, whereas others are less common. Such shared traits probably are not due to a common origin of all African languages. Instead, some may be due to [[language contact]] (resulting in borrowing) and specific idioms and phrases may be due to a similar cultural background.\n\n===Phonological===\nSome widespread phonetic features include:\n* certain types of consonants, such as [[implosive consonant|implosives]] ({{IPA|/\u0253a/}}), [[ejective consonant|ejectives]] ({{IPA|/k\u02bca/}}), the [[labiodental flap]] and in southern Africa, [[Click consonant|clicks]] ({{IPA|/\u01c2a/}}, {{IPA|/\u1d51\u01c3a/}}). True implosives are rare outside Africa, and clicks and the flap almost unheard of.\n* doubly articulated [[Labial-velar consonant|labial-velar stops]] like {{IPA|/k\u0361pa/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261\u0361ba/}} are found in places south of the Sahara.\n* [[prenasalized consonant]]s, like {{IPA|/mpa/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b\u0261a/}}, are widespread in Africa but not common outside it.\n* sequences of stops and fricatives at the beginnings of words, such as {{IPA|/fsa/}}, {{IPA|/pta/}} and {{IPA|/dt\u0361sk\u0361x\u02bca/}}.\n* nasal stops which only occur with nasal vowels, such as {{IPA|[ba]}} vs. {{IPA|[m\u00e3]}} (but both {{IPA|[pa]}} and {{IPA|[p\u00e3]}}), especially in West Africa.\n* vowels contrasting an [[advanced tongue root|advanced or retracted tongue]], commonly called \"tense\" and \"lax\".\n* simple [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] systems which are used for grammatical purposes.\n\nSounds that are relatively uncommon in African languages include [[uvular consonant]]s, [[diphthong]]s and [[front vowel|front rounded vowels]]\n\n[[Tonal language]]s are found throughout the world but are predominantly used in Africa. Both the Nilo-Saharan and the Khoi-San phyla are fully tonal. The large majority of the Niger\u2013Congo languages are also tonal. Tonal languages are also found in the Omotic, Chadic and South & East Cushitic branches of Afroasiatic. The most common type of tonal system opposes two tone levels, High (H) and Low (L). [[Tone contour|Contour tone]]s do occur, and can often be analysed as two or more tones in succession on a single syllable. ''Tone melodies'' play an important role, meaning that it is often possible to state significant generalizations by separating tone sequences (\"melodies\") from the segments that bear them. [[Tonal sandhi]] processes like tone spread, tone shift, downstep and downdrift are common in African languages.\n<!--Many ethnic groups living in the rain forests of Africa transmit messages from one village to another by use of so called ''talking drums''.\nAfrican languages differ in the number of tone levels they have. Most African tonal languages have a two tone system.-->\n\n===Syntactic===\nWidespread syntactical structures include the common use of adjectival verbs and the expression of comparison by means of a verb 'to surpass'. The Niger\u2013Congo languages have large numbers of genders ([[noun class]]es) which cause agreement in verbs and other words. [[grammatical case|Case]], [[grammatical tense|tense]] and other categories may be distinguished only by tone.\n\n===Semantic===\nQuite often, only one term is used for both animal and meat; the word ''nama'' or ''nyama'' for animal/meat is particularly widespread in otherwise widely divergent African languages.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe following is a table displaying the number of speakers of given languages within Africa:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n|-\n!width=15%|Language\n!width=15%|Family\n!width=15% data-sort-type=\"number\"|Native speakers (L1)\n!width=30%|Official status per country\n|-\n| [[Abron language|Abron]] || [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] ||1,393,000<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/abr|title=Abron|website=Ethnologue|language=en|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref>\n|| {{flag|Ghana}}\n|-\n| [[Afar language|Afar]] || [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] ||  || Spoken in  {{flag|Djibouti}}, {{flag|Eritrea}}, {{flag|Ethiopia}}\n|-\n| [[Afrikaans]] || [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] || 7,200,000<ref name=\"statssa-2011-language-1\">{{cite book |title=Census 2011: Census in brief |url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/census/census_2011/census_products/Census_2011_Census_in_brief.pdf |publisher=Statistics South Africa |location=Pretoria |year=2012 |isbn=9780621413885 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513171240/http://www.statssa.gov.za/census/census_2011/census_products/Census_2011_Census_in_brief.pdf |archive-date=13 May 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> || National language in {{flag|Namibia}}, co-official in {{flag|South Africa}}\n|-\n| [[Akan language|Akan]] || [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger\u2013Congo]] || 11,000,000<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Nationalencyklopedin]] \"V\u00e4rldens 100 st\u00f6rsta spr\u00e5k 2007\" The World's 100 Largest Languages in 2007</ref> || None.

{"title_page": "British nationality law and Hong Kong", "text_new": "{{Short description|Status of Hong Kong people in United Kingdom law}}\n{{For|information on the most prominent type of British nationality in Hong Kong|British National (Overseas)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=January 2020}}\n{{EngvarB|date=July 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2014}}\n{{British subjects}}\n'''British nationality law ''' as it pertains to '''Hong Kong''' has been unusual ever since Hong Kong became a [[British colony]] in 1842. From its beginning as a sparsely populated trading port to today's cosmopolitan international financial centre and [[world city]] of over seven million people, the territory has attracted [[refugees]], immigrants and [[expatriates]] alike searching for a new life.\n\nCitizenship matters were complicated by the fact that [[British nationality law]] treated those born in [[:Hong Kong]] as British subjects (although they did not enjoy full rights and citizenship), while the [[People's Republic of China]] did not recognise Hong Kongers with Chinese ancestry as British. The main legal rationale for the Chinese position was that recognising these people as British could be seen as tacit acceptance of a series of treaties which China considers \"[[Unequal treaties|unequal]]\" \u2013 including the ones which ceded the [[Hong Kong Island]], the [[Kowloon Peninsula]] and the land between the Kowloon Peninsula and the [[Sham Chun River]] and neighbouring islands (i.e. the [[New Territories]]) to the UK. The main political reason was to prevent the vast majority of Hong Kong residents from having any recourse to British assistance (e.g. by claiming consular assistance or protection under an external treaty) after the [[handover of Hong Kong]].\n\n==Early colonial era==\n[[English common law]] has the rationale of natural-born citizenship, following the principle of ''[[jus soli]]'', in the theory that people born within the dominion of [[The Crown]], which included self-governing [[British Dominions|dominions]] and [[Crown colonies]], would have a \"natural allegiance\" to the Crown as a \"debt of gratitude\" to the Crown for protecting them through infancy.  As the dominion of the British Empire expanded, [[British subject]]s included not only persons within the United Kingdom but also those throughout the rest of the British Empire.\n\nBy this definition, anyone born in Hong Kong after it became a British colony in 1842 was a British subject. The Naturalisation of Aliens Act 1847 expanded what had been covered in the Naturalisation Act 1844, which applied only to people within the United Kingdom, to all its dominions and colonies. The Act made provisions for naturalisation as well as allowing for acquisition of British subject status by marriage between a foreign woman and a man with British subject status.\n\n===British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914===\n{{main|British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914}}\nThe British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914 (now renamed as \"Status of Aliens Act 1914\") came into force on 1 January 1915, codifying for the first time the law relating to British nationality. No major change was introduced but it set into law how people associated with Hong Kong \u2013 as part of \"His Majesty's dominions\" \u2013 would acquire British subject status.\n\n===British Nationality Act 1948===\n{{Main|British Nationality Act 1948}}\n\nThe [[Commonwealth of Nations]]' heads of government decided in 1948 to embark on a major change in the law of nationality throughout the Commonwealth. It was decided at the conference that the United Kingdom and the self-governing dominions would each adopt separate national citizenship, but retain the common imperial status of British subject. The British Nationality Act 1948 provided for a new status of [[Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies]] (CUKC), consisting of British subjects who had a close relationship (either through birth or descent) with the United Kingdom and its remaining colonies. The Act also provided that British subjects could be known by the alternative title [[Commonwealth citizen]].\n\nThe Act came into force on 1 January 1949 and stipulated that anyone born in \"United Kingdom or a colony\" on or after that date was a CUKC. Those who were British subjects on 31 December 1948 were entitled to acquire CUKC status by declaration. The deadline for this was originally 31 December 1949, but the deadline was extended to 31 December 1962 by the British Nationality Act 1958.\n\nBritish Nationality Acts were passed in 1958, 1964 and 1965, which mainly fine-tuned special provisions about CUKC status acquisition.\n\n===Commonwealth Immigrants Acts===\nUntil 1962, all Commonwealth citizens could enter and stay in the United Kingdom without any restriction. Anticipating immigration waves from former and current colonies in Africa and Asia with the decolonisation of the 1960s, the United Kingdom passed the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962]] and [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968]] to tighten immigration control for CUKCs into the United Kingdom.\n\nAs such, CUKCs connected with Hong Kong were subject to immigration control after 1962.\n\nFinally, under the [[Immigration Act 1971]], the concept of patriality or [[right of abode]] was created. CUKCs and other Commonwealth citizens had the right of abode in the UK only if they, their husband (if female), their parents or their grandparents were connected with the United Kingdom. This placed the UK in the rare position of denying some of its nationals entry into their country of nationality. However, the concept of patriality was only a temporary solution to halt a sudden wave of migration. The British government later reformed the law, resulting in the British Nationality Act 1981.\n\nThese acts shaped an increasingly restrictive immigration policy into the UK for Hong Kong residents even before the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] of 1984.\n\n=== British Nationality Act 1981 and British Dependent Territories Citizenship ===\n[[Image:Old-hongkong-bp.jpg|thumb|A [[British passport]] for a BDTC with connection with Hong Kong]]\nThe [[British Nationality Act 1981]] created new categories of British nationality and renamed British colonial territories. After implementation, all British Crown colonies became [[British Dependent Territories]]. The Act abolished the status of CUKC, and replaced it with three new categories of nationality on 1 January 1983:\n* [[British Citizen]] (for residents of the UK and the [[Crown dependency|Crown dependencies]])\n* [[British Dependent Territories Citizen]] (BDTC) (for the Crown colonies), and\n* [[British Overseas Citizen]] (BOC) (a class of non-inheritable nationality for those who are unable to become a British Citizen, a BDTC or a national of another country)\n\nThe law stated that those who have CUKC status by connection with Hong Kong and those born in Hong Kong on or after 1983 to a parent settled in Hong Kong are BDTCs. The law also stated that British Citizens or BDTCs by descent could not automatically pass on British nationality to a child born outside the United Kingdom or the dependent territories concerned unless a parent acquired citizenship otherwise than by descent.\n\n==After the Sino-British Joint Declaration==\n[[Image:Flag of the United Kingdom.svg|right|100px]] [[Image:Flag of Hong Kong 1959.svg|right|100px]] [[Image:Flag of the People's Republic of China.svg|right|100px]]\nNegotiation concerning the future of Hong Kong started in the late 1970s between Britain and China. With the signing of the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] on 19 December 1984, the future of Hong Kong was set, with China to assume sovereignty of the entire territory of Hong Kong on 1 July 1997.\n\nAt that time, there were some 3.5 million residents of Hong Kong with BDTC status by virtue of their connection with Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Another 2 million were believed to have been eligible to apply to become BDTCs. After the handover, they would have lost this status and became solely [[Chinese nationality law|Chinese nationals]]. At the time, Hong Kong was the largest of the remaining British dependent territories with over 5 million inhabitants.\n\n===Creation of the British National (Overseas) status===\n{{Demographics of Hong Kong}}\n{{Main|British National (Overseas)}}\n\nThe [[Hong Kong Act 1985]] created an additional category of [[British nationality law|British nationality]] known as ''[[British National (Overseas)]]'' or ''BN(O)''. This new category was available only to Hong Kong BDTCs, and any Hong Kong BDTC who wished to do so would be able to acquire the status of BN(O). The status was non-transferable and available only by application, and the deadline to apply was 30 June 1997.\n\n====British Overseas Citizen status for those who are 'otherwise stateless'====\nAny Hong Kong BDTCs who failed to register as a BN(O) by 1 July 1997 and would thereby be rendered stateless (generally because they were a non-ethnic Chinese and therefore could not automatically acquire Chinese nationality), automatically became a [[British Overseas Citizen]] under the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishcitizen.info/StatelessReductionProvisions.pdf |title=Article 6(1), ''Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order, 1986'' |access-date=18 August 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226205835/http://www.britishcitizen.info/StatelessReductionProvisions.pdf |archive-date=26 February 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990: British citizenship for 50,000 Hong Kong families===\n{{Main|British Nationality Selection Scheme}}\nAfter the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989]], many people in Hong Kong began to fear for their future post-1997. Emigration was rampant and a brain-drain was beginning to affect the economy of Hong Kong. To stem the drain, people urged the British government to grant full British citizenship to all Hong Kong BDTCs \u2013 but this request was never accepted. However, the British did agree to creating the [[British Nationality Selection Scheme]], which granted to a select 50,000 people and their families the ability to obtain full British citizenship without having to fulfill the ordinary requirements, under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990.<ref>{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/1990/34/contents|title=British Nationality Act (Hong Kong) 1990}}</ref> Under the Act, the Home Secretary was required to register any person recommended by the [[Governor of Hong Kong]] (as well as the applicant's spouse and minor children) as a British Citizen. Any person who was registered under the act automatically ceased to be a BDTC upon registration as a British Citizen. No person could be registered under the act after 30 June 1997.\n\n===Hong Kong (War Wives and Widows) Act 1996: British citizenship for Hong Kong war wives and widows===\nWomen who had received assurance from the Secretary of State that they would be eligible for settlement in the United Kingdom on the basis of their husband's war service in the defence of Hong Kong may be registered as British Citizens if they were resident in Hong Kong and had not remarried. There is no requirement for the woman to hold (or have held) any form of British nationality. Women registered as British Citizens under this act acquire British citizenship \"otherwise than by descent\" and thus also their children would be [[British Citizen]]s.<ref>{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/1996/41/contents|title=Hong Kong (War Wives and Widows) Act 1996}}</ref>\n\n===British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997: British citizenship for British Nationals (Overseas) without Chinese ancestry===\nAnother special group of solely Hong Kong British nationals were the non-Chinese ethnic minorities of Hong Kong. They are primarily immigrants or children of immigrants from Nepal, India and [[Pakistan]]. After the [[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover]] to China, they would not be accepted as inherently being citizens of the People's Republic. They would be left effectively [[stateless person|stateless]] \u2013 they would have British nationality and [[permanent residency]] and right of abode in Hong Kong, but no right of abode in the UK, nor a right to claim [[Chinese nationality law|Chinese nationality]].\n\nThe ethnic minorities petitioned to be granted full British citizenship,<ref>[http://www.journalism.sfsu.edu/www/pubs/prism/nov95/03.html A Pasage to Nowhere] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910112715/http://www.journalism.sfsu.edu/www/pubs/prism/nov95/03.html |date=10 September 2005 }} (Prism Nov 1995) ''accessed 1 Aug 2010''</ref> and were backed by several politicians [[Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]], then the Shadow Home Secretary said <ref>[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=48962 ]{{dead link|date=January 2020}}</ref> in a letter to the then Home Secretary [[Michael Howard]] dated 30 January 1997 that \"common sense and common humanity demand that we give these people full British citizenship. The limbo in which they will find themselves in July arises directly from the agreements which Britain made with China\".

Hong Kong BDTC status ceased to exist and cannot be regained. An interpretation for implementing Chinese nationality law for Hong Kong was presented at the Nineteenth Session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress on 15 May 1996, a year prior to the Hong Kong handover and came into effect on 1 July 1997. The explanations concerning the implementation of the nationality of Hong Kong citizens is that Hong Kong citizens of Chinese descent are Chinese nationals whether or not they have acquired other foreign citizenship(s). Where such Chinese nationals resident in Hong Kong undergo a change of citizenship (e.g. in accordance with Article 9 of the Nationality Law, which provides that a person who becomes ''settled'' in a foreign country ''and'' acquires foreign citizenship loses his or her Chinese citizenship - Hong Kong is not recognised as foreign territory, before or after 1 July 1997), this must be declared to immigration authorities to be recognised under Chinese nationality law. British nationality acquired in Hong Kong (including BN(O) and under the British Nationality Selection Scheme are specifically not recognised as a change of nationality (as they did not occur after the person became ''settled'' in a foreign country). Therefore, a Hong Kong resident who had acquired non-Chinese citizenship would still be recognised as a Chinese citizen after 1 July 1997 (effectively becoming a [[dual nationality|dual national]]), but if that person declares the change of nationality to immigration authorities, they would effectively cease to be a Chinese national.\n\nThis is reflected in the position the [[Hong Kong Immigration Department]] has on Hong Kong permanent residents of Chinese nationality who were Hong Kong permanent residents immediately before 1 July 1997 and hold non-Chinese nationality or citizenship. Those who were permanent residents before the Handover continue to enjoy right of abode in Hong Kong whether they have remained overseas for long time or hold foreign nationality. They however, will not enjoy foreign consular protection in Hong Kong as long as they do not declare a change of nationality to the Immigration Department.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/residents/immigration/roa/eligible-position-chinese-hold-foreign-passports.html|title=The Position of Residents (including Former Residents) of Chinese Nationality who were Permanent Residents Immediately Before 1 July 1997 and Hold Foreign Passports &#124; Immigration Department|website=www.immd.gov.hk}}</ref>\n\n==Recent groups eligible for a form of British Nationality==\n\n===British citizenship for non-ethnic Chinese which were wrongfully denied===\nIn February 2006, in response to representations made by Lord Avebury and Tameem Ebrahim,<ref>[http://www.britishcitizen.info/CitizenshipDenied_HO_Submission.pdf representations made by Lord Avebury and Tameem Ebrahim, 6 December 2004 (Accessed 1 Aug 2010)]</ref> British authorities announced that six hundred British citizenship applications of ethnic minority children of Indian descent from Hong Kong were wrongly refused.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldlwa/060228wa1.pdf|title=British citizenship applications of ethnic minority children of Indian descent from Hong Kong wrongly refused}}</ref> The applications dated from the period July 1997 onwards.

The only option which would be characterized as fair would be to offer existing BN(O) holders the right to gain full British citizenship. It is likely that many would not take this up as the prospects economic and fiscal of moving to the UK are not favourable to those well-established in Hong Kong. However, I am advised that this would be a breach of the commitments made between China and the UK in the 1984 Joint Declaration on the future of Hong Kong, an international treaty between the two countries; and that to secure Chinese agreement to vary the terms of that treaty would not be possible. On that basis, I see no alternative but to preserve this one anomalous category of citizenship\": Chapter 4, paragraph 12.</ref>\n\nHowever, Goldsmith stated in February 2020: \u201cI want to make it

From its beginning as a sparsely populated trading port to today's cosmopolitan international financial centre and [[world city]] of over seven million people, the territory has attracted [[refugees]], immigrants and [[expatriates]] alike searching for a new life.\n\nCitizenship matters were complicated by the fact that [[British nationality law]] treated those born in [[:Hong Kong]] as British subjects (although they did not enjoy full rights and citizenship), while the [[People's Republic of China]] did not recognise Hong Kongers with Chinese ancestry as British. The main legal rationale for the Chinese position was that recognising these people as British could be seen as tacit acceptance of a series of treaties which China considers \"[[Unequal treaties|unequal]]\" \u2013 including the ones which ceded the [[Hong Kong Island]], the [[Kowloon Peninsula]] and the land between the Kowloon Peninsula and the [[Sham Chun River]] and neighbouring islands (i.e. the [[New Territories]]) to the UK. The main political reason was to prevent the vast majority of Hong Kong residents from having any recourse to British assistance (e.g. by claiming consular assistance or protection under an external treaty) after the [[handover of Hong Kong]].\n\n==Early colonial era==\n[[English common law]] has the rationale of natural-born citizenship, following the principle of ''[[jus soli]]'', in the theory that people born within the dominion of [[The Crown]], which included self-governing [[British Dominions|dominions]] and [[Crown colonies]], would have a \"natural allegiance\" to the Crown as a \"debt of gratitude\" to the Crown for protecting them through infancy.  As the dominion of the British Empire expanded, [[British subject]]s included not only persons within the United Kingdom but also those throughout the rest of the British Empire.\n\nBy this definition, anyone born in Hong Kong after it became a British colony in 1842 was a British subject. The Naturalisation of Aliens Act 1847 expanded what had been covered in the Naturalisation Act 1844, which applied only to people within the United Kingdom, to all its dominions and colonies. The Act made provisions for naturalisation as well as allowing for acquisition of British subject status by marriage between a foreign woman and a man with British subject status.\n\n===British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914===\n{{main|British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914}}\nThe British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914 (now renamed as \"Status of Aliens Act 1914\") came into force on 1 January 1915, codifying for the first time the law relating to British nationality. No major change was introduced but it set into law how people associated with Hong Kong \u2013 as part of \"His Majesty's dominions\" \u2013 would acquire British subject status.\n\n===British Nationality Act 1948===\n{{Main|British Nationality Act 1948}}\n\nThe [[Commonwealth of Nations]]' heads of government decided in 1948 to embark on a major change in the law of nationality throughout the Commonwealth. It was decided at the conference that the United Kingdom and the self-governing dominions would each adopt separate national citizenship, but retain the common imperial status of British subject. The British Nationality Act 1948 provided for a new status of [[Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies]] (CUKC), consisting of British subjects who had a close relationship (either through birth or descent) with the United Kingdom and its remaining colonies. The Act also provided that British subjects could be known by the alternative title [[Commonwealth citizen]].\n\nThe Act came into force on 1 January 1949 and stipulated that anyone born in \"United Kingdom or a colony\" on or after that date was a CUKC. Those who were British subjects on 31 December 1948 were entitled to acquire CUKC status by declaration. The deadline for this was originally 31 December 1949, but the deadline was extended to 31 December 1962 by the British Nationality Act 1958.\n\nBritish Nationality Acts were passed in 1958, 1964 and 1965, which mainly fine-tuned special provisions about CUKC status acquisition.\n\n===Commonwealth Immigrants Acts===\nUntil 1962, all Commonwealth citizens could enter and stay in the United Kingdom without any restriction. Anticipating immigration waves from former and current colonies in Africa and Asia with the decolonisation of the 1960s, the United Kingdom passed the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962]] and [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968]] to tighten immigration control for CUKCs into the United Kingdom.\n\nAs such, CUKCs connected with Hong Kong were subject to immigration control after 1962.\n\nFinally, under the [[Immigration Act 1971]], the concept of patriality or [[right of abode]] was created. CUKCs and other Commonwealth citizens had the right of abode in the UK only if they, their husband (if female), their parents or their grandparents were connected with the United Kingdom. This placed the UK in the rare position of denying some of its nationals entry into their country of nationality. However, the concept of patriality was only a temporary solution to halt a sudden wave of migration. The British government later reformed the law, resulting in the British Nationality Act 1981.\n\nThese acts shaped an increasingly restrictive immigration policy into the UK for Hong Kong residents even before the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] of 1984.\n\n=== British Nationality Act 1981 and British Dependent Territories Citizenship ===\n[[Image:Old-hongkong-bp.jpg|thumb|A [[British passport]] for a BDTC with connection with Hong Kong]]\nThe [[British Nationality Act 1981]] created new categories of British nationality and renamed British colonial territories. After implementation, all British Crown colonies became [[British Dependent Territories]]. The Act abolished the status of CUKC, and replaced it with three new categories of nationality on 1 January 1983:\n* [[British Citizen]] (for residents of the UK and the [[Crown dependency|Crown dependencies]])\n* [[British Dependent Territories Citizen]] (BDTC) (for the Crown colonies), and\n* [[British Overseas Citizen]] (BOC) (a class of non-inheritable nationality for those who are unable to become a British Citizen, a BDTC or a national of another country)\n\nThe law stated that those who have CUKC status by connection with Hong Kong and those born in Hong Kong on or after 1983 to a parent settled in Hong Kong are BDTCs. The law also stated that British Citizens or BDTCs by descent could not automatically pass on British nationality to a child born outside the United Kingdom or the dependent territories concerned unless a parent acquired citizenship otherwise than by descent.\n\n==After the Sino-British Joint Declaration==\n[[Image:Flag of the United Kingdom.svg|right|100px]] [[Image:Flag of Hong Kong 1959.svg|right|100px]] [[Image:Flag of the People's Republic of China.svg|right|100px]]\nNegotiation concerning the future of Hong Kong started in the late 1970s between Britain and China. With the signing of the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] on 19 December 1984, the future of Hong Kong was set, with China to assume sovereignty of the entire territory of Hong Kong on 1 July 1997.\n\nAt that time, there were some 3.5 million residents of Hong Kong with BDTC status by virtue of their connection with Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Another 2 million were believed to have been eligible to apply to become BDTCs. After the handover, they would have lost this status and became solely [[Chinese nationality law|Chinese nationals]]. At the time, Hong Kong was the largest of the remaining British dependent territories with over 5 million inhabitants.\n\n===Creation of the British National (Overseas) status===\n{{Demographics of Hong Kong}}\n{{Main|British National (Overseas)}}\n\nThe [[Hong Kong Act 1985]] created an additional category of [[British nationality law|British nationality]] known as ''[[British National (Overseas)]]'' or ''BN(O)''. This new category was available only to Hong Kong BDTCs, and any Hong Kong BDTC who wished to do so would be able to acquire the status of BN(O). The status was non-transferable and available only by application, and the deadline to apply was 30 June 1997.\n\n====British Overseas Citizen status for those who are 'otherwise stateless'====\nAny Hong Kong BDTCs who failed to register as a BN(O) by 1 July 1997 and would thereby be rendered stateless (generally because they were a non-ethnic Chinese and therefore could not automatically acquire Chinese nationality), automatically became a [[British Overseas Citizen]] under the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishcitizen.info/StatelessReductionProvisions.pdf |title=Article 6(1), ''Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order, 1986'' |access-date=18 August 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226205835/http://www.britishcitizen.info/StatelessReductionProvisions.pdf |archive-date=26 February 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990: British citizenship for 50,000 Hong Kong families===\n{{Main|British Nationality Selection Scheme}}\nAfter the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989]], many people in Hong Kong began to fear for their future post-1997. Emigration was rampant and a brain-drain was beginning to affect the economy of Hong Kong. To stem the drain, people urged the British government to grant full British citizenship to all Hong Kong BDTCs \u2013 but this request was never accepted. However, the British did agree to creating the [[British Nationality Selection Scheme]], which granted to a select 50,000 people and their families the ability to obtain full British citizenship without having to fulfill the ordinary requirements, under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990.<ref>{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/1990/34/contents|title=British Nationality Act (Hong Kong) 1990}}</ref> Under the Act, the Home Secretary was required to register any person recommended by the [[Governor of Hong Kong]] (as well as the applicant's spouse and minor children) as a British Citizen. Any person who was registered under the act automatically ceased to be a BDTC upon registration as a British Citizen. No person could be registered under the act after 30 June 1997.\n\n===Hong Kong (War Wives and Widows) Act 1996: British citizenship for Hong Kong war wives and widows===\nWomen who had received assurance from the Secretary of State that they would be eligible for settlement in the United Kingdom on the basis of their husband's war service in the defence of Hong Kong may be registered as British Citizens if they were resident in Hong Kong and had not remarried. There is no requirement for the woman to hold (or have held) any form of British nationality. Women registered as British Citizens under this act acquire British citizenship \"otherwise than by descent\" and thus also their children would be [[British Citizen]]s.<ref>{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/1996/41/contents|title=Hong Kong (War Wives and Widows) Act 1996}}</ref>\n\n===British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997: British citizenship for British Nationals (Overseas) without Chinese ancestry===\nAnother special group of solely Hong Kong British nationals were the non-Chinese ethnic minorities of Hong Kong. They are primarily immigrants or children of immigrants from Nepal, India and [[Pakistan]]. After the [[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover]] to China, they would not be accepted as inherently being citizens of the People's Republic. They would be left effectively [[stateless person|stateless]] \u2013 they would have British nationality and [[permanent residency]] and right of abode in Hong Kong, but no right of abode in the UK, nor a right to claim [[Chinese nationality law|Chinese nationality]].\n\nThe ethnic minorities petitioned to be granted full British citizenship,<ref>[http://www.journalism.sfsu.edu/www/pubs/prism/nov95/03.html A Pasage to Nowhere] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910112715/http://www.journalism.sfsu.edu/www/pubs/prism/nov95/03.html |date=10 September 2005 }} (Prism Nov 1995) ''accessed 1 Aug 2010''</ref> and were backed by several politicians [[Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]], then the Shadow Home Secretary said <ref>[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=48962 ]{{dead link|date=January 2020}}</ref> in a letter to the then Home Secretary [[Michael Howard]] dated 30 January 1997 that \"common sense and common humanity demand that we give these people full British citizenship. The limbo in which they will find themselves in July arises directly from the agreements which Britain made with China\". He further stated that a claim that BN(O) status amounts to British nationality \"is pure sophistry\".</ref> and media.<ref>''[[The Economist]]'' also said that \"the failure to offer citizenship to most of Hong Kong's residents was shameful\", and \"it was the height of cynicism to hand 6 million people over to a regime of proven brutality without allowing them any means to move elsewhere.\" The article also stated that the real reason that the new Labour government still refused to give full British citizenship to other BDTCs was because if the UK waited until Hong Kong had been disposed of it \"would be seen as highly cynical\", as [[Elizabeth Symons, Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean|The Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean]], a [[Foreign Office]] minister, conceded. (\"Britain's colonial obligations\", 3 July 1997, ''[[The Economist]]'')</ref> The subsequently enacted British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997<ref>{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/1997/20/contents|title=British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997}}</ref> gives them an entitlement to acquire full British citizenship by making an application to register for that status after 1 July 1997.\n\n===Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002: British Overseas Territories Citizen status is not applicable to Hong Kong===\nIn light of the passing of the [[British Overseas Territories Act 2002]], which made provision to substitute the wording of \"British Dependent Territories\" with \"[[British Overseas Territories]]\" in the British Nationality Act 1981 among other new provisions, further clarification was made even though this act did not even apply to Hong Kong. Section 14 of the subsequent Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 stated specifically that a person may not be registered as a [[British Overseas Territories Citizen]] (BOTC) by virtue of a connection with Hong Kong.\n\n===Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009: British citizenship for British Nationals (Overseas) who do not have another nationality or citizenship===\n{{main|Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009}}\nA small group of Hong Kong ethnic minorities had not been eligible for acquiring British citizenship under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997 because they were not ordinarily resident in Hong Kong before 4 February 1997 or they were under 18 / 21 years of age, had dual nationality through their parents on or after 4 February 1997, but had lost it upon turning 18/21.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/british-nationality-hong-kong-act-1997-nationality-policy-guidance|title=Registration as a British citizen: British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997|website=GOV.UK}}</ref> These BN(O)s lost their second nationality due to changes in the nationality laws of certain countries and had, therefore, become de facto stateless. They could register to become [[British citizens]] under section 4B of the [[British Nationality Act 1981]] as amended by [[Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009]] to \"remedy the limbo status of probably the last remaining group of solely British nationals who have no other nationality or citizenship, who have not recently and deliberately given up another nationality or citizenship\".<ref>[[Lord Avebury]] in the [[House of Lords]]</ref> To be eligible for registration, they must demonstrate that they had not lost, through action or inaction, any other nationality on and after 19 March 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/other-british-nationals-nationality-policy-guidance|title=Registration as a British citizen: other British nationals|website=GOV.UK}}</ref> Registration under s4B confers British citizenship by descent.\n\n==Chinese view on nationality of Hong Kong residents==\nThe Chinese government stated in its memorandum of the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] on December 19, 1984 that under the [[Chinese nationality law]], \"all Hong Kong Chinese compatriots, whether they are holders of the 'British Dependent Territories Citizens' Passport' or not, are Chinese nationals\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd6.htm| title = The Joint Declaration - Memoranda (Exchanged Between the Two Sides)|publisher= Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region | accessdate=2020-04-17}}</ref> In 1990, when the [[Gulf War]] started, the Chinese embassy provided  a proof of Chinese citizenship to a Hong Kong Chinese businessman in Kuwait holding a BDTC passport and helped him evacuate.<ref>{{cite book|title=\u4e2d\u570b\u5167\u5730\u8207\u9999\u6e2f\u5730\u5340\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\u885d\u7a81\u8207\u5354\u8abf|trans-title = Conflict and Coordination of Laws of Mainland China and Hong Kong |publisher=Chung Hwa Book Company (Hong Kong) |editor=Dong Likun|year=2016|pages=181-182|language=zh}}</ref> [[Chinese nationality law]] has applied in Hong Kong since the handover on 1 July 1997. Hong Kong BDTC status ceased to exist and cannot be regained. An interpretation for implementing Chinese nationality law for Hong Kong was presented at the Nineteenth Session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress on 15 May 1996, a year prior to the Hong Kong handover and came into effect on 1 July 1997. The explanations concerning the implementation of the nationality of Hong Kong citizens is that Hong Kong citizens of Chinese descent are Chinese nationals whether or not they have acquired other foreign citizenship(s). Where such Chinese nationals resident in Hong Kong undergo a change of citizenship (e.g. in accordance with Article 9 of the Nationality Law, which provides that a person who becomes ''settled'' in a foreign country ''and'' acquires foreign citizenship loses his or her Chinese citizenship - Hong Kong is not recognised as foreign territory, before or after 1 July 1997), this must be declared to immigration authorities to be recognised under Chinese nationality law. British nationality acquired in Hong Kong (including BN(O) and under the British Nationality Selection Scheme are specifically not recognised as a change of nationality (as they did not occur after the person became ''settled'' in a foreign country). Therefore, a Hong Kong resident who had acquired non-Chinese citizenship would still be recognised as a Chinese citizen after 1 July 1997 (effectively becoming a [[dual nationality|dual national]]), but if that person declares the change of nationality to immigration authorities, they would effectively cease to be a Chinese national.\n\nThis is reflected in the position the [[Hong Kong Immigration Department]] has on Hong Kong permanent residents of Chinese nationality who were Hong Kong permanent residents immediately before 1 July 1997 and hold non-Chinese nationality or citizenship. Those who were permanent residents before the Handover continue to enjoy right of abode in Hong Kong whether they have remained overseas for long time or hold foreign nationality. They however, will not enjoy foreign consular protection in Hong Kong as long as they do not declare a change of nationality to the Immigration Department.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/residents/immigration/roa/eligible-position-chinese-hold-foreign-passports.html|title=The Position of Residents (including Former Residents) of Chinese Nationality who were Permanent Residents Immediately Before 1 July 1997 and Hold Foreign Passports &#124; Immigration Department|website=www.immd.gov.hk}}</ref>\n\n==Recent groups eligible for a form of British Nationality==\n\n===British citizenship for non-ethnic Chinese which were wrongfully denied===\nIn February 2006, in response to representations made by Lord Avebury and Tameem Ebrahim,<ref>[http://www.britishcitizen.info/CitizenshipDenied_HO_Submission.pdf representations made by Lord Avebury and Tameem Ebrahim, 6 December 2004 (Accessed 1 Aug 2010)]</ref> British authorities announced that six hundred British citizenship applications of ethnic minority children of Indian descent from Hong Kong were wrongly refused.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldlwa/060228wa1.pdf|title=British citizenship applications of ethnic minority children of Indian descent from Hong Kong wrongly refused}}</ref> The applications dated from the period July 1997 onwards. Where the applicant in such cases confirms that he or she still wishes to receive British citizenship the decision will be reconsidered on request.\n\n===British Overseas Citizen status/British citizenship for certain ethnic Indians (new Indian law)===\nRecent changes to India's ''Citizenship Act, 1955'' (see [[Indian nationality law]]) provide that Indian citizenship by descent can no longer be acquired automatically at the time of birth. This amendment will also allow some children of Indian origin born in Hong Kong after 3 December 2004 who have a BN(O) or BOC parent to automatically acquire BOC status at birth under the provisions for reducing statelessness in [https://web.archive.org/web/20080226205835/http://www.britishcitizen.info/StatelessReductionProvisions.pdf articles 6(2) and 6(3) of the ''Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order, 1986'']. If they have acquired no other nationality after birth, they will be entitled to [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds04/text/41220w04.htm#column_WA123 register for full British citizenship].\n\n===British Overseas Citizen status/British citizenship for certain ethnic Nepalese (reinterpretation of Nepalese law)===\nRecent clarification of [[Nepal citizenship law]] has meant a number of persons born in Hong Kong who failed to renounce their British nationality before the age of 21 and were previously thought to be citizens of Nepal are in fact solely British. The British Government has recently accepted that certain Nepalese passport holders born in Hong Kong before 30 June 1976 are BOCs,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office|title=Foreign & Commonwealth Office|website=GOV.UK}}</ref> and can register for British citizenship if they wish to do so.\n\n===British citizenship for British Nationals (Overseas) who are otherwise stateless===\nThe passage of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 provides a path for British Nationals (Overseas) who had no other citizenship before 19 March 2009 to apply for British citizenship under s.&nbsp;4B of the British Nationality Act 1981. To qualify, they must demonstrate that they had not lost or renounced any other nationalities, through action or inaction, on or after 19 March 2009.\n\n==Future of the British National (Overseas) status: Lord Goldsmith's citizenship review in 2008==\n[[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Lord Goldsmith]] discussed the BN(O) issue in his citizenship review in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/citizenship-report-full.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405223352/http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/citizenship-report-full.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-05|title=Wayback Machine|date=5 April 2008|website=web.archive.org}}</ref> He regarded the BN(O) status as \"anomalous\" in the history of British nationality law, but saw no alternative to preserving this status.<ref>\"Nonetheless to remove this status without putting something significant in its place would be seen as the British reneging on their promise to the people of Hong Kong. The only option which would be characterized as fair would be to offer existing BN(O) holders the right to gain full British citizenship. It is likely that many would not take this up as the prospects economic and fiscal of moving to the UK are not favourable to those well-established in Hong Kong. However, I am advised that this would be a breach of the commitments made between China and the UK in the 1984 Joint Declaration on the future of Hong Kong, an international treaty between the two countries; and that to secure Chinese agreement to vary the terms of that treaty would not be possible. On that basis, I see no alternative but to preserve this one anomalous category of citizenship\": Chapter 4, paragraph 12.</ref>\n\nHowever, Goldsmith stated again in Feb2020. \u201cI want to make it clear: I never intended my report on citizenship to be a statement on any opinion by me that there would be a breach of the arrangements with China if the UK were to offer greater rights,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI do not see why the UK government would be in breach of any obligation undertaken in the joint declaration were it to resolve to extend full right of abode to BN(O) passport holders while continuing to honour their side of the Sino-British Joint Declaration.\u201d\n\n==See also==\n*[[British passport]]\n*[[British National (Overseas) passport]]\n*[[History of British nationality

Today papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 sculptures are used as an economic building material for a variety of traditional and ceremonial activities, as well as in arts and crafts.\n\n==Preparation methods==\n[[Image:Papier mache.jpg|thumb|right|Papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 with the strips method for the creation of a pig]]\n[[File:Paper mache mask with feet with grey background.JPG|thumb|right|Papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mask created with the pulp method]]\nTwo main methods are used to prepare papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. The first method makes use of paper strips glued together with adhesive, and the other uses paper pulp obtained by soaking or boiling paper to which glue is then added.\n\nWith the first method, a form for support is needed on which to glue the paper strips. With the second method, it is possible to shape the pulp directly inside the desired form. In both methods, reinforcements with wire, [[chicken wire]], lightweight shapes, balloons or textiles may be needed.\n\nThe traditional method of making papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 adhesive is to use a mixture of water and flour or other starch, mixed to the consistency of heavy [[cream]]. Other adhesives can be used if thinned to a similar texture, such as [[polyvinyl acetate]]-based glues (wood glue or, in the [[United States]], white [[Elmer's Products, Inc.|Elmer's]] glue). Adding [[oil of cloves]] or other additives such as salt to the mixture reduces the chances of the product developing [[Mold (fungus)|mold]].\n\nFor the paper strips method, the paper is cut or torn into strips, and soaked in the paste until saturated. The saturated pieces are then placed onto the surface and allowed to dry slowly. The strips may be placed on an ''armature'', or skeleton, often of wire mesh over a structural frame, or they can be placed on an object to create a cast. Oil or grease can be used as a release agent if needed. Once dried, the resulting material can be cut, sanded and/or painted, and waterproofed by painting with a suitable water-repelling paint.<ref name= costumes>{{cite book | title = Costumes for Plays and Playing | first = Gail E | last = Haley | year = 2002 | publisher = Parkway Publishers | isbn = 1-887905-62-6 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/costumesforplays00hale }}</ref> Before painting any product of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, the glue must be fully dried, otherwise mold will form and the product will rot from the inside out.\n\nFor the pulp method, the paper is left in water at least overnight to soak, or boiled in abundant water until the paper breaks down to a pulp. The excess water is drained, an adhesive is added and the papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 applied to a form or, especially for smaller or simpler objects, sculpted to shape.\n\n==History==\n=== Imperial China ===\nThe Chinese under the ruling of the [[Han dynasty]] appeared to first use papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 around 200 B.C., not long after they learned how to make paper.

These sheets were used for building coach door panels as well as other structural uses. Theodore Jennens patented a process in 1847 for steaming and pressing these laminated sheets into various shapes, which were then used to manufacture trays, chair backs, and structural panels, usually laid over a wood or metal armature for strength.

The papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 works are also called \"carton piedra\" (rock cardboard) for the rigidness of the final product.<ref name= costumes/> These sculptures today are generally made for certain yearly celebrations, especially for the Burning of Judas during Holy Week and various decorative items for Day of the Dead. However, they also include pi\u00f1atas, mojigangas, masks, dolls and more made for various other occasions. There is also a significant market for collectors as well. Papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 was introduced into Mexico during the colonial period, originally to make items for church. Since then, the craft has developed, especially in central Mexico. In the 20th century, the creation of works by Mexico City artisans Pedro Linares and Carmen Caballo Sevilla were recognized as works of art with patrons such as Diego Rivera. The craft has become less popular with more recent generations, but various government and cultural institutions work to preserve it.\n\n====Paper boats====\nOne common item made in the 19th century in America was the paper [[canoe]], most famously made by Waters & Sons of [[Troy, New York|Troy]], New York. The invention of the continuous sheet paper machine allows paper sheets to be made of any length, and this made an ideal material for building a seamless boat [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]. The paper of the time was significantly stretchier than modern paper, especially when damp, and this was used to good effect in the manufacture of paper boats. A layer of thick, dampened paper was placed over a hull mold and tacked down at the edges. A layer of glue was added, allowed to dry, and sanded down. Additional layers of paper and glue could be added to achieve the desired thickness, and cloth could be added as well to provide additional strength and stiffness. The final product was trimmed, reinforced with wooden strips at the [[keel]] and [[gunwale]]s to provide stiffness, and waterproofed. Paper [[racing shell]]s were highly competitive during the late 19th century. Few examples of paper boats survived. One of the best known paper boats was the canoe, the \"Maria Theresa\", used by Nathaniel Holmes Bishop to travel from New York to Florida in 1874\u201375. An account of his travels was published in the book ''Voyage of the Paper Canoe''.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.cupery.net/SH.html | title = A history of paper boats | publisher = Cupery}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1082 | title = Voyage of the Paper Canoe | first = Nathaniel Holmes | last = Bishop | publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]]}}.</ref>\n\n====Paper masks====\nCreating papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 masks is common among elementary school children and craft lovers. Either one's own face or a balloon can be used as a mold. This is common during Halloween time as a facial mask complements the costume.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://familycrafts.about.com/od/papermache/a/plmaskcraft.htm | title = Family crafts | contribution = How to Make Paper Mache Masks | publisher = About}}.</ref>\n\n====Paper observatory domes====\nPapier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 panels were used in the late 19th century and early 20th century to produce lightweight domes, used primarily for [[observatory|observatories]]. The domes were constructed over a wooden or iron framework, and the first ones were made by the same manufacturer that made the early paper boats, Waters & Sons. The domes used in observatories had to be light in weight so that they could easily be rotated to position the telescope opening in any direction, and large enough so that it could cover the large [[refractor]] [[telescopes]] in use at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cupery.net/dome.html | publisher = Cupery | title=Paper observatory domes}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1884/04/11/106276949.pdf |journal= The New York Times |date= April 11, 1884 |title= Columbia's New Observatory | format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=316698 |title=The special feature of the new observatory at Columbia College will be a paper dome |date=March 19, 1883 |journal=The Harvard Crimson |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126043442/http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=316698 |archivedate=January 26, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n====Paper sabots====\n[[Image:Schenkl projectile.jpg|thumb|right|The Schenkl projectile, used in the [[American Civil War]], used a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 [[Sabot (firearms)|sabot]]]]\nPapier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 was used in a number of firearms as a material to form [[Sabot (firearms)|sabots]]. Despite the extremely high pressures and temperatures in the bore of a firearm, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 proved strong enough to contain the pressure, and push a sub-[[caliber]] projectile out of the barrel with a high degree of accuracy. Papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 sabots were used in everything from small arms, such as the [[Dreyse needle gun|Dreyse]] [[needle gun]], up to [[artillery]], such as the Schenkl projectile.<ref>{{Citation | title = A Treatise on Ordnance and Armor | first = Alexander Lyman | last = Holley |year= 1865 |publisher= Tr\u00fcbner & Co}}</ref><ref name = spon>{{Citation |title= Spon's Dictionary of Engineering | first1 =Edward | last1 = Spon | first2 = Oliver | last2 = Byrne | year = 1872 | publisher = E&FN}}</ref>\n\n==Modern use==\nWith modern plastics and composites taking over the decorative and structural roles that papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 played in the past, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 has become less of a commercial product. There are exceptions, such as [[Micarta]], a modern paper composite, and traditional applications such as the [[pi\u00f1ata]]. It is still used in cases where the ease of construction and low cost are important, such as in [[handicraft|arts and crafts]].\n\n===Carnival floats===\n[[Image:preparazione vendola.jpg|thumb|left|Building of a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mask for the sculpture of [[Nichi Vendola]], in the Carnival of Massafra]]\nPapier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 is commonly used for large, temporary sculptures such as [[Carnival]] [[Float (parade)|floats]]. A basic structure of wood, metal and metal wire mesh, such as [[Chicken wire|poultry netting]], is covered in papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. Once dried, details are added. The papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 is then sanded and painted. Carnival floats can be very large and comprise a number of characters, props and scenic elements, all organized around a chosen theme. They can also accommodate several dozen people, including the operators of the mechanisms. The floats can have movable parts, like the facial features of a character, or its limbs. It is not unusual for local professional architects, engineers, painters, sculptors and ceramists to take part in the design and construction of the floats. [[Mardi Gras in New Orleans|New Orleans Mardi Gras]] float maker Blaine Kern, operator of the [[Mardi Gras World]] float museum, brings Carnival float artists from Italy to work on his floats.<ref>{{cite book | last=Barghetti| first=Adriano | title = 1994\u20132003: 130 anni di storia del Carnevale di Viareggio, Carnevale d\u2019Italia e d\u2019Europa | language = Italian | year=2007 | publisher=Pezzini}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Blues for New Orleans: Mardi Gras And America's Creole Soul | first = Roger D | last = Abrahams |year=2006 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=0-8122-3959-8}}</ref>\n\n===Theatrical use===\nPapier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 is an economic building material for both sets and costume elements.<ref name= costumes/><ref>{{cite book |title=Making the Movies |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.188297 | first =Jeanne | last = Bendick |year=1945 | place =Whittlesey House | publisher = McGraw-Hill}}</ref> It is also employed in puppetry.\nA famous company that popularized it is [[Bread and Puppet Theater]] founded by [[Peter Schumann]].\n\n==War-time uses==\n===Military drop tanks===\nDuring [[World War II]], military aircraft fuel tanks were constructed out of plastic-impregnated paper and used to extend the range or loiter time of aircraft. These tanks were plumbed to the regular fuel system via detachable fittings and dropped from the aircraft when the fuel was expended, allowing short-range aircraft such as fighters to accompany long-range aircraft such as bombers on longer missions as protection forces. Two types of paper tanks were used, a 200-gallon (758 l) [[conformal fuel tank]] made by the United States for the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]], and a 108-gallon (409 l) cylindrical [[drop tank]] made by the British and used by the P-47 and the [[North American P-51 Mustang]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mighty Eighth: Units, Men, and Machines (A History of the US 8th Army Air Force) | first=Roger Anthony | last=Freeman |publisher=Doubleday |year=1970}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=P-51 Mustang | first=William Newby | last=Grant |publisher=Chartwell Books |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-89009-320-7}}</ref>\n\n===Combat decoy===\nFrom about 1915 in [[World War I]], the British were beginning to counter the highly effective sniping of the Germans. Among the techniques the British developed was to employ papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 figures resembling soldiers to draw sniper fire. Some were equipped with an apparatus that produced smoke from a cigarette, to increase the realism of the effect. Bullet holes in the decoys were used to determine the position of enemy snipers who had fired the shots.

One of the best known paper boats was the canoe, the \"Maria Theresa\", used by Nathaniel Holmes Bishop to travel from New York to Florida in 1874\u201375. An account of his travels was published in the book ''Voyage of the Paper Canoe''.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.cupery.net/SH.html | title = A history of paper boats | publisher = Cupery}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1082 | title = Voyage of the Paper Canoe | first = Nathaniel Holmes | last = Bishop | publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]]}}.</ref>\n\n====Paper masks====\nCreating papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 masks is common among elementary school children and craft lovers. Either one's own face or a balloon can be used as a mold. This is common during Halloween time as a facial mask complements the costume.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://familycrafts.about.com/od/papermache/a/plmaskcraft.htm | title = Family crafts | contribution = How to Make Paper Mache Masks | publisher = About}}.</ref>\n\n====Paper observatory domes====\nPapier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 panels were used in the late 19th century and early 20th century to produce lightweight domes, used primarily for [[observatory|observatories]]. The domes were constructed over a wooden or iron framework, and the first ones were made by the same manufacturer that made the early paper boats, Waters & Sons. The domes used in observatories had to be light in weight so that they could easily be rotated to position the telescope opening in any direction, and large enough so that it could cover the large [[refractor]] [[telescopes]] in use at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cupery.net/dome.html | publisher = Cupery | title=Paper observatory domes}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1884/04/11/106276949.pdf |journal= The New York Times |date= April 11, 1884 |title= Columbia's New Observatory | format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=316698 |title=The special feature of the new observatory at Columbia College will be a paper dome |date=March 19, 1883 |journal=The Harvard Crimson |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126043442/http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=316698 |archivedate=January 26, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n====Paper sabots====\n[[Image:Schenkl projectile.jpg|thumb|right|The Schenkl projectile, used in the [[American Civil War]], used a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 [[Sabot (firearms)|sabot]]]]\nPapier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 was used in a number of firearms as a material to form [[Sabot (firearms)|sabots]]. Despite the extremely high pressures and temperatures in the bore of a firearm, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 proved strong enough to contain the pressure, and push a sub-[[caliber]] projectile out of the barrel with a high degree of accuracy. Papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 sabots were used in everything from small arms, such as the [[Dreyse needle gun|Dreyse]] [[needle gun]], up to [[artillery]], such as the Schenkl projectile.<ref>{{Citation | title = A Treatise on Ordnance and Armor | first = Alexander Lyman | last = Holley |year= 1865 |publisher= Tr\u00fcbner & Co}}</ref><ref name = spon>{{Citation |title= Spon's Dictionary of Engineering | first1 =Edward | last1 = Spon | first2 = Oliver | last2 = Byrne | year = 1872 | publisher = E&FN}}</ref>\n\n==Modern use==\nWith modern plastics and composites taking over the decorative and structural roles that papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 played in the past, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 has become less of a commercial product. There are exceptions, such as [[Micarta]], a modern paper composite, and traditional applications such as the [[pi\u00f1ata]]. It is still used in cases where the ease of construction and low cost are important, such as in [[handicraft|arts and crafts]].\n\n===Carnival floats===\n[[Image:preparazione vendola.jpg|thumb|left|Building of a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mask for the sculpture of [[Nichi Vendola]], in the Carnival of Massafra]]\nPapier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 is commonly used for large, temporary sculptures such as [[Carnival]] [[Float (parade)|floats]]. A basic structure of wood, metal and metal wire mesh, such as [[Chicken wire|poultry netting]], is covered in papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. Once dried, details are added. The papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 is then sanded and painted. Carnival floats can be very large and comprise a number of characters, props and scenic elements, all organized around a chosen theme. They can also accommodate several dozen people, including the operators of the mechanisms. The floats can have movable parts, like the facial features of a character, or its limbs. It is not unusual for local professional architects, engineers, painters, sculptors and ceramists to take part in the design and construction of the floats. [[Mardi Gras in New Orleans|New Orleans Mardi Gras]] float maker Blaine Kern, operator of the [[Mardi Gras World]] float museum, brings Carnival float artists from Italy to work on his floats.<ref>{{cite book | last=Barghetti| first=Adriano | title = 1994\u20132003: 130 anni di storia del Carnevale di Viareggio, Carnevale d\u2019Italia e d\u2019Europa | language = Italian | year=2007 | publisher=Pezzini}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Blues for New Orleans: Mardi Gras And America's Creole Soul | first = Roger D | last = Abrahams |year=2006 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=0-8122-3959-8}}</ref>\n\n===Theatrical use===\nPapier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 is an economic building material for both sets and costume elements.<ref name= costumes/><ref>{{cite book |title=Making the Movies |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.188297 | first =Jeanne | last = Bendick |year=1945 | place =Whittlesey House | publisher = McGraw-Hill}}</ref> It is also employed in puppetry.\nA famous company that popularized it is [[Bread and Puppet Theater]] founded by [[Peter Schumann]].\n\n==War-time uses==\n===Military drop tanks===\nDuring [[World War II]], military aircraft fuel tanks were constructed out of plastic-impregnated paper and used to extend the range or loiter time of aircraft. These tanks were plumbed to the regular fuel system via detachable fittings and dropped from the aircraft when the fuel was expended, allowing short-range aircraft such as fighters to accompany long-range aircraft such as bombers on longer missions as protection forces. Two types of paper tanks were used, a 200-gallon (758 l) [[conformal fuel tank]] made by the United States for the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]], and a 108-gallon (409 l) cylindrical [[drop tank]] made by the British and used by the P-47 and the [[North American P-51 Mustang]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mighty Eighth: Units, Men, and Machines (A History of the US 8th Army Air Force) | first=Roger Anthony | last=Freeman |publisher=Doubleday |year=1970}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=P-51 Mustang | first=William Newby | last=Grant |publisher=Chartwell Books |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-89009-320-7}}</ref>\n\n===Combat decoy===\nFrom about 1915 in [[World War I]], the British were beginning to counter the highly effective sniping of the Germans. Among the techniques the British developed was to employ papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 figures resembling soldiers to draw sniper fire. Some were equipped with an apparatus that produced smoke from a cigarette, to increase the realism of the effect. Bullet holes in the decoys were used to determine the position of enemy snipers who had fired the shots. Very high success rates were claimed for this expedient.<ref name=\"Hesketh-Pritchard\">[https://archive.org/details/cu319240279466191920 H.
