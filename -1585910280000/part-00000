System archetypes do not imply that current causes affect past effects.\n\n== Circles of causality ==\n\nThe basic idea of [[system thinking]] is that every action triggers a reaction. In [[system dynamics]] this reaction is called [[feedback]]. There are two types of feedback \u2013 [[positive feedback|reinforcing feedback]] and [[negative feedback|balancing feedback]]. Sometimes a feedback (or a reaction) does not occur immediately \u2013 the process contains delays. Any system can be drawn as a [[diagram]] set up with circles of [[causality]] \u2013 including actions, feedbacks and delays.<ref name=\"ps\" />\n\n== Reinforcing feedback (+) ==\n\n[[positive feedback|Reinforcing feedback]] (or amplifying feedback) accelerates the given trend of a process. If the trend is ascending, the reinforcing (positive) feedback will accelerate the growth. If the trend is descending, it will accelerate the decline. Falling of an avalanche is an example of the reinforcing feedback process.<ref name=\"ps\" />\n\n== Balancing feedback (\u2212) ==\n\n[[negative feedback|Balancing feedback]] (or stabilizing feedback) will work if any [[goal-state]] exists. Balancing process intends to reduce a gap between a current state and a desired state. The balancing (negative) feedback adjusts a present state to a desirable target regardless whether the trend is descending or ascending. An example of the balancing feedback process is staying upright on bicycle (when riding).<ref name=\"ps\" />\n\n== Delays ==\n\nDelays in systems cause people to perceive a response to an action incorrectly. This causes an under- or overestimation of the needed action and results in [[oscillation]], instability or even breakdown.<ref name=\"ps\" />\n\n== Examples of system archetypes ==\n\nThe following System Archetyes describe the most common generic structures. Before effectively addressing a specific situation, the underlying pattern must be identified. The following Flow Diagram should help identifying these archetypes. The links between the different archetypes are an indicator of most common connections. Keep in mind that in every situation, there may be more possible ways to follow, though. Consider that everyone is located somewhere in the flow, and that every possible situation has its own advantages, down-sides, caveats, and options. Nevertheless, correctly identifying and understanding your situation is always the first step of solving your problem in a sustainable way.\n\n[[File:SD Archetypes.png|alt=Overview of common System Dynamics Archetypes|thumb|924x924px|Overview of common System Dynamics Archetypes|none]]\n\n=== Balancing process with delay ===\n\nThis archetype explains the system in which the response to action is delayed. If the agents do not perceive the delayed feedback, they might overshoot or underestimate the requisite action in order to reach their goals. This could be avoided by being patient or by accelerating reactions of the system to realized measures.\nExample: [[supply chain]] ([[Beer distribution game|The Beer Game]])<ref name=\"ps\" />\n[[File:Balancing process with delay.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram \"Balancing process with delay\"''']]\n\n=== Limits to growth ===\n\nThe unprecedented growth is produced by a reinforcing feedback process until the system reaches its peak. The halt of this growth is caused by limits inside or outside of the system. However, if the limits are not properly recognized; the former methods are continuously applied, but more and more aggressively. This results in the contrary of the desired state \u2013 a decrease of the system. The solution lies in the weakening or elimination of the cause of limitation.  \nExample: [[dieting]], learning foreign languages<ref name=\"ps\" /> \n[[File:Limits to growth.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram \"Limits to growth\"''']]\n[[Attractiveness principle|Attractiveness Principle]] is an archetype derived from Limits to Growth. The main difference is that Attractiveness Principle assumes growth is limited with two or more factors.\n\n=== Shifting the burden ===\n\nThe problem is handled by a simple solution with immediate effect, thereby \"healing the symptoms\". The primary source of the problem is overlooked, because its remedy is demanding and has no immediate outcome. The origin of the problem should be identified and solved in the long-term run during which the [[Substance dependence|addiction]] to the [[symptomatic treatment|symptomatic remedy]] decreases. \nExample: [[drug addiction]], paying debts by borrowing<ref name=\"ps\" />\n[[File:Shifting the burden.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram \"Shifting the burden\"''']]\n\n=== Shifting the burden to the intervenor ===\n\nA special case of the \u201cShifting the Burden\u201d systems archetype that occurs when an intervenor is brought in to help solve an ongoing problem. \u00a0Over time, as the intervenor successfully handles the problem, the people within the system become less capable of solving the problem themselves. \u00a0They become even more dependent on the intervenor.  Examples:  ongoing use of outside consultants.\n\nIn simple terms, this is an archetype whereby a system grows increasingly dependent on an outside intervenor to help it function. In the short-term this works, but in the long term the system is unable to function on its \u00a0own due to the dependence on the intervention and eventually fails to perform.\n\n[[File:Shifting the burden to the Intervenor.png|alt=|none|frame|'''Causal loop diagram \"Shifting the burden to the intervenor\"'''|387x387px]]\n\n=== Eroding goals ===\n\nA kind of shifting the burden archetype. As current problems need to be handled immediately, the long-term goals continuously decline. It can be avoided by sticking to the vision. \nExample: balancing the [[public debt]], sliding limits of [[environmental pollution]]<ref name=\"ps\" />\n[[File:Eroding goals.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram \"Eroding goals\"''']]\n\n=== [[Escalation archetype|Escalation]] ===\n\nThis archetype could be seen as a [[non-cooperative game]] where both players suppose that just one of them can win. They are responding to actions of the other player in order to \u201cdefend themselves\u201d. The aggression grows and can result in [[self-destructive behavior]]. The [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] can be broken by one agent stopping to react defensively and turn the game into cooperative one. \nExample: [[arms race]]<ref name=\"ps\" />\n[[File:Escalation.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram \"Escalation\"''']]\n\n=== Success to successful ===\n\nTwo people or activities need the same limited resources. As one of them becomes more successful, more resources are assigned to him/it. The second one becomes less and less successful due to lacking resources, and \u201cprove the right decision\u201d to support the first one. Problems occur if the [[competition]] is unhealthy and interferes with the goals of the whole system. The two activities or agents might be decoupled or they should receive balanced amount of resources.\nExamples: two products of one company, work vs. family<ref name=\"ps\" />\n[[File:Success to the successful.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram \"Success to the successful\"''']]\n\n=== [[Tragedy of the commons]] ===\n\nAgents use common [[scarcity|limited resource]] to profit individually. As the use of the resource is not controlled, the agents would like to continuously raise their [[Economics|benefits]]. The resource is therefore used more and more and the [[revenues]] of the agents are decreasing. The agents are intensifying their [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] until the resource is completely used up or seriously damaged. To protect common resources some form of [[regulation]] should be introduced.\nExample: [[fish stocks]] (The Fishing Game)<ref name=\"ps\" />\n[[File:Tragedy of the commons.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram \"Tragedy of the commons\"''']]\n\n=== Fixes that fail ===\n\nIn the [[fixes that fail]] archetype, the problem is solved by some fix (a specific [[solution]]) with immediate positive effect. Nonetheless, the \u201c[[unintended consequence|side effects]]\u201d of this solution turn out in the future. The best remedy seems to apply the same solution. \nExample: [[saving costs]] on [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]], paying [[interest]] by other [[loans]] (with other interests)<ref name=\"ps\" />\n[[File:Fixes that fail.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram \"Fixes that fail\"''']]\n\n=== [[Growth and underinvestment]] ===\n\nThe limit to growth is the current [[production capacity]]. It can be removed by sufficient [[investment]] in new capacities. If the investment is not aggressive enough (or it is too low), the capacities are overloaded, the [[Quality (business)|quality]] of services declines and the [[demand]] decreases.

It expanded from [[Ashanti Region|Ashanti]] to include the [[Brong-Ahafo Region]], [[Central Region (Ghana)|Central Region]], [[Eastern Region (Ghana)|Eastern Region]], [[Greater Accra Region]] and [[Western Region (Ghana)|Western Region]] of present-day [[Ghana]]. Due to the empire's military prowess, wealth, architecture, sophisticated hierarchy and culture, the Ashanti Kingdom has been extensively studied and has more [[historiographies]] by European, primarily British authors than any other indigenous culture of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].<ref name=\"Collins and Burns (2007), p. 140.\">Collins and Burns (2007), p. 140.</ref> \n\nStarting in the late 17th century, the Ashanti king [[Osei Tutu]] ({{circa| 1695}} &ndash; 1717) and his adviser [[Okomfo Anokye]] established the Ashanti Kingdom, with the [[Asante royal thrones|Golden Stool of Asante]] as a sole unifying symbol.

The current king of the Ashanti Kingdom is [[Otumfuo Nana Osei Tutu II|Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Asantehene]]. The Ashanti Kingdom is the home to [[Lake Bosumtwi]], Ghana's only natural lake. The state's current economic revenue is derived mainly from trading in [[gold bar]]s, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[kola nut]]s and [[agriculture]]; forests have also been cleared to plant [[cassava]], [[maize]] and [[yam (vegetable)|yams]].<ref name=\"Collins and Burns\">Collins and Burns (2007), p. 139.</ref>\n\n==Etymology and origins==\n[[File:KenteCloth.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kente cloth, the traditional garment worn by Ashanti royalty, has been widely adopted throughout the Ashanti Kingdom.]]\n\nThe name ''Asante'' means \"because of war\". The word derives from the [[Twi]] words ''\u0254sa'' meaning \"war\" and ''nti'' meaning \"because of\". This name comes from the Asante's origin as a kingdom created to fight the [[Denkyira]] kingdom.\n\nThe variant name \"Ashanti\" comes from British reports that transcribing \"Asante\" as the British heard it pronounced, ''as-hanti''. The hyphenation was subsequently dropped and the name ''Ashanti'' remained, with various spellings including ''Ashantee'' common into the early 20th century.\n\nBetween the 10th and 12th centuries AD the ethnic [[Akan people]] migrated into the forest belt of Southern Ghana and established several Akan states: \n* [[Ashanti Region|Ashanti]], \n* [[Brong-Ahafo Region|Brong-Ahafo]], \n* [[Assin]]-Denkyira-[[Fante Confederacy]]-[[Mankessim Kingdom]] (present-day [[Central Region, Ghana|Central region]])\n* [[Akyem]]-[[Akwamu]]-[[Akuapem people|Akuapem]]-[[Kwahu]] (present-day [[Eastern Region, Ghana|Eastern region]] and [[Greater Accra Region|Greater Accra]]), and \n* [[Ahanta]]-[[Aowin]]-[[Sefwi people|Sefwi]]-[[Wassa]] (present-day [[Western Region, Ghana|Western region]]).\n\nBefore the Ashanti Kingdom had contact with Europeans, it had a flourishing trade with other African states due to the Ashanti [[gold]] wealth.

According to legend, a meeting of all the clan heads of each of the Ashanti settlements was called just prior to declaring independence from [[Denkyira]]. In this meeting the Golden Stool was commanded down from the heavens by Okomfo Anokye, chief-priest or sage advisor to Asantehene Osei Tutu I and floated down from the heavens into the lap of Osei Tutu I. Okomfo [[Anokye]] declared the stool to be symbolic of the new Asante Union (''the Ashanti Kingdom''), and allegiance was sworn to the stool and to Osei Tutu as the Asantehene.

The [[Ashanti Kingdom]] utterly defeated them at the [[Battle of Feyiase]], proclaiming its independence in 1701. Subsequently, through hard line force of arms and savoir-faire diplomacy, the duo induced the leaders of the other Ashanti city-states to declare allegiance and adherence to [[Kumasi]], the Ashanti capital. From the beginning, King Osei Tutu and priest [[Okomfo Anokye|Anokye]] followed an expansionist and an imperialistic provincial foreign policy. According to folklore, Okomfo Anokye is believed to have visited [[Akrofonso|Agona-Akrofonso]].<ref name=\"History of the Ashanti Empire\"/>\n\n===Under Osei Tutu===\n[[File:Kumasi.png|thumb|Image of an Ashanti home in [[Kumasi]], before British colonization.]]\nRealizing the strengths of a loose confederation of Akan states, Osei Tutu strengthened centralization of the surrounding Akan groups and expanded the powers of the judiciary system within the centralized government. This loose confederation of small city-states grew into a kingdom and eventually an empire looking to expand its borders. Newly conquered areas had the option of joining the empire or becoming tributary states.<ref>Giblert, Erik ''Africa in World History: From Prehistory to the Present'' 2004</ref> [[Opoku Ware I]], Osei Tutu's successor, extended the borders, embracing much of Ghana's territory.<ref>Shillington, loc. cit.</ref>\n\n===European contact===\n[[File:Ashanti English Medieval Ewer.jpg|thumb|The [[Asante Ewer]] was made in [[England]] during reign of [[Richard II]] (1377\u20131399) and was discovered in 1896 in the Asante kingdom. The front of the jug bears the royal arms of England and each of the facets of the lid contains a [[lion]] and a [[stag]]. These symbols date the jug to the last 9 years of Richard's reign, when he adopted the badge of the white hart. Two more English bronze jugs from the same period were found at [[Kumasi]], the Asante capital, at the time as this example. Perhaps all 3 were a set from the household of Richard II. How they came to the west coast of [[Africa]] remains a mystery, but there was extensive trade between West Africa and Western Europe  across the Sahara Desert in the Middle Ages. Now it is in the [[British Museum]], [[London]].]]\nEuropean contact with the Asante on the [[Gulf of Guinea]] coast region of Africa began in the 15th century. This led to trade in [[gold]], [[ivory]], [[Slavery|slaves]], and other goods with the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], which gave rise to kingdoms such as the Ashanti. On May 15, 1817 the Englishman [[Thomas Edward Bowdich|Thomas Bowdich]] entered Kumasi. He remained there for several months, was impressed, and on his return to England wrote a book, ''Mission from Cape Coast Castle to Ashantee.''<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Bowdich\n  | first = Thomas Edward\n  | authorlink = Thomas Edward Bowdich\n  | title = Mission from Cape Coast Castle to Ashantee, with a statistical account of that kingdom, and geographical notices of other parts of the interior of Africa\n  | publisher = J.

But, the governor, Hope Smith, did not meet Ashanti expectations.<ref>Lloyd, pp. 28-38</ref>\n{{angle bracket|}}\n\n===Slavery===\n{{See also|Slavery in West Africa}}\n\nSlavery was historically a tradition in the Ashanti Empire, with slaves typically taken as captives from enemies in warfare. The welfare of their slaves varied from being able to acquire wealth and intermarry with the master's family to being [[Human sacrifice|sacrificed]] in funeral ceremonies. The Ashanti believed that slaves would follow their masters into the afterlife. Slaves could sometimes own other slaves, and could also request a new master if the slave believed he or she was being severely mistreated.<ref>[[Alfred Burdon Ellis]],\n[https://archive.org/details/tshispeakingpeo01elligoog/page/n302 <!-- pg=290 --> , ''The Tshi-speaking peoples of the Gold Coast of West Africa''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610125849/https://books.google.com/books?id=jtMSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA290 |date=2016-06-10 }}, \n1887. p. 290</ref><ref>Rodriguez, Junius P.

They defend the \"humanity\" of Ashanti slavery by noting that those slaves were allowed to marry, and that their children were born free.<ref name=\"History of the Ashanti Empire\">\n[http://www.ashanti.com.au/pb/wp_8078438f.html ''History of the Ashanti Empire''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413213927/http://www.ashanti.com.au/pb/wp_8078438f.html |date=2012-04-13 }}</ref> If a master found a female slave desirable, he might marry her. He preferred such an arrangement to that of a free woman in a conventional marriage, because marriage to an enslaved woman allowed the children to inherit some of the father's [[property]] and status.\n\nThis favored arrangement occurred primarily because of what some men considered their conflict with the [[matrilineality|matrilineal]] system. Under this kinship system, children were considered born into the mother's clan and took their status from her family. Generally her eldest brother served as mentor to her children, particularly for the boys. She was protected by her family. Some Ashanti men felt more comfortable taking a slave girl or pawn wife in marriage, as she would have no ''[[abusua]]'' (older male grandfather, father, uncle or brother) to intercede on her behalf when the couple argued. With an enslaved wife, the master and husband had total control of their children, as she had no kin in the community.\n\n===British relations===\nIn December 1895, the British left Cape Coast with an expeditionary force. It arrived in Kumasi in January 1896 under the command of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]].<ref>\"The Downfall of Prepmeh\" by Robert Baden-Powell, 1896, the American edition is available for download at http://www.thedump.scoutscan.com/dumpinventorybp.php {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027155154/http://www.thedump.scoutscan.com/dumpinventorybp.php |date=2016-10-27 }}</ref> The Asantehene (king) directed the Ashanti to not resist, as he feared a [[genocide]]. Shortly thereafter, Governor William Maxwell arrived in Kumasi as well.\n\nBritain [[annexation|annexed]] the territories of the Ashanti and the Fanti. Asantehene Agyeman Prempeh was deposed and arrested, and he and other Ashanti leaders were sent into exile in the [[Seychelles]]. The Asante Union was dissolved{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}. The British formally declared the state of the Ashanti Kingdom and the coastal regions to be the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] colony. A [[British Resident]] was permanently placed in the city of Kumasi, and soon after a British fort was built there{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}.\n\n===Uprisings of 1900 and since 1935===\nAs a final measure of resistance, the remaining Asante court not exiled to the Seychelles mounted an offensive against the British Residents at the Kumasi Fort. The resistance was led by Asante queen [[Yaa Asantewaa]], Queen-Mother of Ejisu. From March 28 to late September 1900, the Asante and British were engaged in what would become known as the [[War of the Golden Stool]]. In the end, the British were victorious; they exiled Asantewaa and other Asante leaders to the Seychelles to join Asante King Prempeh I.\n\nIn January 1902, Britain finally designated the Ashanti Kingdom as a [[Ashanti Protectorate|protectorate]]. the Ashanti Kingdom was restored to self-rule on 31 January 1935. Asante King Prempeh II was restored in 1957, and the Ashanti Kingdom entered a [[Political union|state union]] with Ghana on independence from the United Kingdom.\n\n===Territorial history timeline===\n{{History Timeline of Ashanti}}\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{cleanup-tense|section|date=September 2013}}\n[[File:Prempeh I.jpg|thumb|[[Prempeh I]], [[Asantehene]] from 1888 to 1931.]]\n\nThe Ashanti government was built upon a sophisticated [[bureaucracy]] in Kumasi, with separate [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]] to handle the state's affairs. Of particular note was Ashanti's Foreign Office based in Kumasi; despite its small size, it allowed the state to pursue complex negotiations with foreign powers. The Office was divided into departments to handle relations separately with the [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]], and [[Arab]]s. Scholars of Ashanti history, such as [[Larry Yarak]] and [[Ivor Wilks|Ivor Wilkes]], disagree over the power of this sophisticated bureaucracy in comparison to the Asantehene, but agree that it was a sign of a highly developed government with a complex system of [[Separation of powers|checks and balances]].\n\n===Asantehene===\nAt the top of Ashanti's power structure sat the ''[[List of rulers of Asante|Asantehene]]'', the King of Ashanti. Each Asantahene was enthroned on the sacred Golden Stool, the Sika 'dwa, an object that came to symbolise the very power of the King. Osei Kwadwo (1764\u20131777) began the [[meritocratic]] system of appointing central officials according to their ability, rather than their birth.<ref>Shillington, p. 195.</ref>\n\nAs King, the ''Asantehene'' held immense power in Ashanti, but did not enjoy [[absolute monarchy|absolute royal rule]]. He was obliged to share considerable legislative and executive powers with Asante's sophisticated bureaucracy. But the ''Asantehene'' was the only person in Ashanti permitted to invoke the [[Capital punishment|death sentence]] in cases of crime. During wartime, the King acted as Supreme Commander of the army, although during the 19th century, the fighting was increasingly handled by the Ministry of War in Kumasi. Each member of the confederacy was also obliged to send annual tribute to Kumasi.\n\nThe ''Ashantihene'' (King of all Ashanti) reigned over all and was King of the division of Kumasi, the nation's capital, and the Ashanti Kingdom. He was elected in the same manner as all other chiefs. In this hierarchical structure, every chief or King swore fealty to the one above him\u2014from village and subdivision, to division, to the chief of Kumasi, and finally the ''Ashantihene'' swore fealty to the [[Sovereign state|State]].\n\nThe [[elder (administrative title)|elders]] circumscribed the power of the ''Ashantihene'', and the chiefs of other divisions considerably checked the power of the King. This in practical effect created a system of checks and balances. As the symbol of the nation, the ''Ashantihene'' received significant deference ritually, for the context was religious in that he was a symbol of the people in the flesh: the living, dead or yet to be born. When the king committed an act not approved of by the counsel of elders or the people, he could possibly be [[impeachment|impeached]], and demoted to a commoner.\n\nThe existence of [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] organizations and the [[Council of State|council]] of elders is evidence of an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] tendency in Ashanti political life. Though older men tend to [[monopoly|monopolize]] political power, Ashanti instituted an organization of young men, the ''nmerante'', that tend to [[democratize]] and [[liberalization|liberalize]] the political process. The council of elders undertake actions only after consulting a representative of the ''nmerante''. Their views must be taken seriously and added into the conversation.\n\n===Obirempon===\nBelow the Asantahene, local power was invested in the ''obirempon'' of each locale. The ''obirempon'' (literally \"big man\") was personally selected by the Asantahene and was generally of loyal, noble lineage, frequently related to the Asantahene. ''Obirempon''s had a fair amount of legislative power in their regions, more than the local nobles of Dahomey but less than the regional governors of the Oyo Empire. In addition to handling the region's administrative and economic matters, the ''obirempon'' also acted as the Supreme Judge of the region, presiding over court cases.\n\n===Residence===\n{{multiple image\n| header = \n| footer = <center>Former and Current Residences of Asantehene.</center>\n| align     = right\n| image1   = King_Koffee_Palace.jpg\n| width1   = 250\n| alt1     = 300\n| caption1 = 1874 Former palace of Asantehene being burned and ransacked by the British after the Third Anglo-Ashanti War.\n| image2   = Manhyia Palace Museum.jpg \n| width2   = 275\n| alt2     = 300\n| caption2 = Manhyia Palace.

From European accounts, the edifice was massive and ornately built. In 1819, English traveler and author, [[Thomas Edward Bowdich]] described the palace as <blockquote> ...an immense building of a variety of oblong courts and regular squares [with] [[entablature]]s exuberantly adorned with bold fan and trellis work of Egyptian character. They have a suite of rooms over them, with small windows of wooden lattice, of intricate but regular carved work, and some have frames cased with thin gold. The squares have a large apartment on each side, open in front, with two supporting pillars, which break the view and give it all the appearance of the proscenium or front of the stage of the older Italian theaters. They are lofty and regular, and the cornices of a very bold cane-work in alto-relievo. A drop-curtain of curiously plaited cane is suspended in front, and in each, we observed chairs and stools embossed with gold, and beds of silk, with scattered regalia.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QQgwAAAAYAAJ&dq|page=291|title=The Monthly Review, Or, Literary Journal|year=1819}}</ref> </blockquote>[[Winwood Reade]] also described his visit to the Ashanti Royal Palace of Kumasi in 1874:\n\n\u201cWe went to the king\u2019s palace, which consists of many courtyards, each surrounded with alcoves and verandahs, and having two gates or doors, so that each yard was a thoroughfare . . . But the part of the palace fronting the street was a stone house, Moorish in its style . . . with a flat roof and a parapet, and suites of apartments on the first floor. It was built by Fanti masons many years ago. The rooms upstairs remind me of Wardour Street. Each was a perfect Old Curiosity Shop. Books in many languages, Bohemian glass, clocks, silver plate, old furniture, Persian rugs, Kidderminster carpets, pictures and engravings, numberless chests and coffers. A sword bearing the inscription From Queen Victoria to the King of Ashantee. A copy of the Times, 17 October 1843. With these were many specimens of Moorish and Ashanti handicraft.\u201d<gallery>\nFile:BOWDICH(1819) p338 PLATE 5 - COOMASSIE, ODUMATA'S SLEEPING ROOM.jpg|Odumata's Sleeping Room (1819).\nFile:BOWDICH(1819) p341 PLATE 7 - COOMASSIE, PART OF A PIAZZA IN THE PALACE.jpg|Piazza in the Palace (1819).\nFile:BOWDICH(1819) p344 PLATE 9 - COOMASSIE, PART OF ADAM STREET.jpg|Adam Street (1819).\n</gallery>\n\n===Elections===\n[[File:BOWDICH(1819) p341 PLATE 8 - COOMASSIE, PART OF A PIAZZA IN THE PALACE.jpg|thumb|left|Plaza of the King's Palace circa 1819.]]\n\nThe [[election]] of Kings and the Asantehene (''King of Kings or emperor'' ) himself followed a pattern. The senior female of the kingly lineage nominated the eligible males. This senior female then consulted the elders, male and female, of that line. The final candidate is then selected. That nomination is then sent to a council of elders, who represent other lineages in the [[town]] or [[district]]. The Elders then present the nomination to the assembled people.\n\nIf the assembled [[citizenship|citizens]] disapprove of the nominee, the process is restarted. Chosen, the new Kings is en-stooled by the Elders, who admonish him with expectations. The chosen Kings swears a solemn oath to the [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth Goddess]] and to his ancestors to fulfill his duties honorably in which he [[Sacrifice|\"sacrifices\"]] himself and his life for the betterment of the ''Oman/Aman'' (state(s).\n\nThis elected and en-stooled King enjoys a great majestic [[ceremony]] to this day with much spectacle and celebration. He reigns with much [[despotism|despotic]] power, including the ability to make judgments of life and death on his subjects. However, he does not enjoy [[absolute rule]]. Upon the stool, the King is sacred, the holy intermediary between people and ancestors. His powers theoretically are more apparent than real. His powers hinge on his attention to the advice and decisions of the Council of Elders. The King can be impeached, de-stooled (de-throned), if the Elders and the people turn against him. He can be reduced to man, subject to derision for his failure.\n\n==Legal system==\n{{More footnotes|section|date=July 2013}}\n [[File:Bonnat GrandChefs.jpg|thumb|300px|The Ashanti Kingdom Obirempons, {{Circa|1873}}, [[Visual arts|Visual Art]] by [[Jules Gros]].]]\n\nThe Ashanti state, in effect, was a [[theocracy]]. It invokes religious, rather than [[secularity|secular]]-legal postulates. What the modern state views as [[crime]]s, Ashanti view practically as [[sin]]s. Antisocial acts disrespect the ancestors, and are only secondarily harmful to the [[community]]. If the chief or [[King]] fails to punish such acts, he invokes the anger of the ancestors and the gods, and is therefore in danger of [[impeachment]]. The penalty for some crimes (sins) is death, but this is seldom imposed; a more common penalty is [[Exile|banishment]] or [[incarceration|imprisonment]].\n\nThe King typically exacts or [[commutation of sentence|commutes]] all [[capital punishment|capital cases]]. These commuted sentences by King and chiefs sometimes occur by [[ransom]] or [[bribery|bribe]]; they are regulated in such a way that they should not be mistaken for [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], but are considered as [[revenue]] to the state, which for the most part welcomes [[wikt:quarrel|quarrel]]s and [[lawsuit|litigation]]. [[Commutation of sentence|Commutations]] tend to be far more frequent than [[Capital punishment|executions]].\n\nAshanti are repulsed by [[murder]], and [[suicide]] is considered murder. They decapitate those who commit suicide, the conventional punishment for murder. The suicide thus had contempt for the court, for only the King may kill an Ashanti.\n\nIn a [[murder]] [[trial]], intent must be established. If the [[homicide]] is accidental, the murderer pays compensation to the lineage of the deceased. The [[insanity|insane]] cannot be executed because of the absence of responsible intent - except for murder or cursing the King; in the case of cursing the king, drunkenness is a valid defense. [[Capital punishment|Capital crimes]] include murder, [[incest]] within the female or male line, and intercourse with a [[menstrual cycle|menstruating]] woman, [[rape]] of a married woman, and [[adultery]] with any of the wives of a chief or the King. [[Assault]]s or insults of a chief or the [[court]] or the King also carried [[capital punishment]].\n\nCursing the King, calling down powers to harm the King, is considered an unspeakable act and carries the weight of [[death]]. One who invokes another to commit such an act must pay a heavy indemnity. Practitioners of harmful (evil) forms of [[Witchcraft|sorcery]] and witchcraft receive death but not by decapitation, for their blood must not be shed. They receive execution by strangling, burning, or drowning.\n\nOrdinarily, families or lineages settle disputes between individuals. Nevertheless, such disputes can be brought to [[trial (law)|trial]] before a chief by uttering the [[taboo]] oath of a chief or the King. In the end, the [[Noble court|King's Court]] is the sentencing court, for only the King can order the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]]. Before the Council of Elders and the King's Court, the litigants orate comprehensively. Anyone present can cross-examine the defendant or the accuser, and if the proceedings do not lead to a [[verdict]], a special witness is called to provide additional [[testimony]]. If there is only one witness, their sworn oath assures the truth is told. Moreover, that he favors or is hostile to either litigant is unthinkable. Cases with no witness, like sorcery or adultery are settled by ordeals, like drinking [[poison]].\n\n[[Veneration of the dead|Ancestor Veneration]] establishes the Ashanti [[morality|moral system]], and it provides the principal foundation for [[government]]al sanctions. The link between mother and child centers the entire network, which includes ancestors and fellow men as well. Its [[judiciary|judicial system]] emphasizes the Ashanti conception of rectitude and good [[behavior]], which favors harmony among the people. The rules were made by '''''Nyame''''' (Supreme [[God]]) and the ancestors, and one must behave accordingly.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana.jpg|thumb|Asante [[Mountain]]s and [[Lake Bosumtwi]] natural [[lake]].]]\n\nThe Ashanti Empire was one of a series of kingdoms along the coast including Dahomey, [[Benin]], and [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]]. The Ashanti Kingdom had mountains and large [[Agriculture|agricultural]] surpluses.<ref name=\"Obeng, J. Pashington page 20\">Obeng, J.

BRILL, 1996.</ref> The southern part of the Ashanti Kingdom is covered with moist semi-[[deciduous forest]] whilst the [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic|Guinea savanna]] covers the northern part of the Ashanti Kingdom. The Guinea Savanna consists of short deciduous and [[Dutch elm disease#Resistant trees|fire resistant trees]]. [[Riparian forest]]s also occur along the [[Afram River]] and streams of the savanna zone. Soils in the Ashanti Kingdom are mainly of two types, [[forest]] ochrosols in southern the Ashanti Kingdom whilst the [[savanna]] ochrosols are confined to northern the Ashanti Kingdom.<ref name=\"Obeng, J. Pashington page 20\"/>\n\nThe predominant [[fauna]] or food rich wildlife and animal species encountered in the Ashanti Kingdom were the [[Hen (bird)|hen]], [[sheep]], [[goat]], [[duck]], [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]], [[rabbit]], [[Guineafowl|guinea fowl]], [[fish]], and the [[porcupine]] which became the national emblem of the Ashanti Kingdom, as well as about thirty multipurpose [[flora]] species of trees and [[shrub]]s and over thirty-five ornamental plants beautifying the Ashanti Kingdom environs. These tree/shrub-crop-animal (hen/fish) components were intensively integrated spatially and/or sequentially on the same land unit of individual Asante houses.<ref name=\"Obeng, J.

Bowdich]].]]\nThe Ashanti prepared the fields by burning before the onset of the rainy season and cultivated with an iron [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]. Fields are left fallow for a couple years, usually after two to four years of cultivation. Plants cultivated include [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, [[yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[Cassava|manioc]], [[maize|corn]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[millet]], [[bean]]s, [[onion]]s, [[peanut]]s, [[tomato]]es, and many [[fruit]]s. Manioc and corn are New World transplants introduced during the [[Atlantic slave trade|Atlantic European trade]]. Many of these [[vegetable]] crops could be harvested twice a year and the [[cassava]] (manioc), after a two-year growth, provides a starchy root. The Ashanti transformed [[palm wine]], maize and millet into [[beer]], a favorite drink; and made use of the oil from palm for many culinary and domestic uses.{{clear|left}}\n\n===Infrastructure===\nInfrastructure such as [[road transport]] and [[communication]] throughout the Ashanti Kingdom was maintained via a network of well-kept [[road]]s from the Ashanti Kingdom to the [[Niger River|Niger river]] and other trade cities.<ref name=\"Davidson (1991)\">Davidson (1991), p. 240.</ref><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 140&ndash;141.</ref>\n\n===Communication===\n[[File:Brit Mus 13sept10 brooches etc 062.jpg|thumb|Akan drum]]\nThe Ashanti invented the [[Fontomfrom]], an Asante [[talking drum]], and they also invented the [[Akan Drum]]. They drummed messages to distances of over {{convert|200|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}}, as rapidly as a [[telegraphy|telegraph]]. [[Asante dialect]] (Twi) and [[Akan language|Akan]], the language of the [[Ashanti people]] is tonal and more meaning is generated by tone.\n\nThe drums reproduced these tones, punctuations, and the accents of a phrase so that the cultivated ear hears the entirety of the phrase itself.\n\nThe Ashanti readily heard and understood the phrases produced by these \"talking drums\". Standard phrases called for meetings of the chiefs or to arms, warned of danger, and broadcast announcements of the death of important figures. Some drums were used for [[proverb]]s and ceremonial presentations.\n\n==Demography==\nThe population history of the Ashanti Kingdom was one of slow centralization. In the early 19th century the Asantehene used the annual tribute to set up a permanent standing army armed with [[rifle]]s, which allowed much closer control of the Ashanti Kingdom. The Ashanti Kingdom was one of the most centralised states in sub-Saharan Africa. Osei Tutu and his successors oversaw a policy of political and cultural unification and the union had reached its full extent by 1750. It remained an alliance of several large city-states which acknowledged the sovereignty of the ruler of Kumasi and the Ashanti Kingdom, known as the Asantehene. The Ashanti Kingdom had dense populations, allowing the creation of substantial [[urban centre]]s.<ref name=\"Obeng, J.

The political genius of the symbolic \"golden stool\" and the fusing effect of a national army however, provided the unity needed to keep the empire viable. Total potential strength was some 80,000 to 200,000 making the Ashanti army bigger than the well known Zulu, and comparable to possibly Africa's largest- the legions of Ethiopia.<ref name=\"Vandervort, op. cit\">Vandervort (1998).</ref> The Ashanti army was described as a fiercely organized one whose king could \"bring 200,000 men into the field and whose warriors were evidently not cowed by [[Snider\u2013Enfield|Snider rifles]] and 7-pounder guns\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZCE1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=9iYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6500,6374935&dq=ashantee&hl=en |title=News.google.com: ''The Newfoundlander - Dec 16, 1873''. |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313050055/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZCE1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=9iYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6500,6374935&dq=ashantee&hl=en |archive-date=March 13, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\nWhile actual forces deployed in the field were less than ''potential'' strength, tens of thousands of soldiers were usually available to serve the needs of the empire. Mobilization depended on small cadres of regulars, who guided and directed levees and contingents called up from provincial governors. Organization was structured around an advance guard, main body, rear guard and two right and left wing flanking elements. This provided flexibility in the forest country the Ashanti armies typically operated in. The approach to the battlefield was typically via converging columns, and tactics included ambushes and extensive maneuvers on the wings. Unique among African armies, the Ashanti deployed medical units to support their fighters. This force was to expand the empire substantially and continually for over a century, and defeated the British in several encounters.<ref name=\"Vandervort, op. cit\"/>\n\n===Wars of the Asante===\n[[File:Ashantee soldier2.jpg|thumb|Ashanti Kingdom [[soldier]], {{Circa|1824}}, by [[Joseph Dupuis]].]]\nFrom 1806 until 1896, the Ashanti Kingdom was in a perpetual state of war involving expansion or defense of its domain. Ashanti exploits against other African forces made it the paramount power in the region. Its impressive performance against the British also earned it the respect of European powers.\n\n===Asante\u2013Fante War===\nIn 1806, the Ashanti pursued two rebel leaders through Fante territory to the coast. The British refusal to surrender the rebels led to an Ashanti attack. This was devastating enough that the British handed over a rebel; the other escaped.<ref>Lloyd, pp. 24-27.</ref> In 1807 disputes with the [[Fante people|Fante]] led to the [[Ashanti\u2013Fante War]], in which the Ashanti were victorious under Asantehene Osei Bonsu (\"Osei, the whale\").\n\n===Ga\u2013Fante War===\nIn the 1811 [[Ga\u2013Fante War]], a coalition of Asante and Ga fought against an alliance of Fante, Akwapim and Akim states.  The Asante war machine was successful early on defeating the alliance in open combat. However, Asante were unable to completely crush their enemies and were forced to withdraw from the Akwapim hills in the face of unconventional warfare. They did, however, manage to capture a British fort.\n\n===Ashanti\u2013Akim\u2013Akwapim War===\nIn 1814 the Ashanti launched an invasion of the Gold Coast, largely to gain access to European traders. In the [[Ashanti\u2013Akim\u2013Akwapim War]], the kingdom faced the Akim\u2013Akwapim alliance. After several battles, some of which went in favor of the Asante and, some of which went in favor of the out numbered Akim\u2013Akwapim alliance the war ended. Even though the outnumbered Akim\u2013Akwapim won some key battles and had moments of glory by 1816, the Ashanti Kingdom was established on the coast.\n\n===Anglo-Ashanti Wars===\n{{Main|Anglo-Ashanti wars}}\n\n====First Anglo-Ashanti War====\n[[File:Aschanti Gefecht 11 july 1824 300dpi.jpg|thumb|left|The Ashanti Kingdom [[army]] engaged with [[British Armed Forces|British forces]] under the command of Col. Sutherland, July 11, 1824.]]\nThe first of the [[Anglo-Ashanti wars]] occurred in 1823. In these conflicts, the Ashanti Kingdom faced off, with varying degrees of success, against the British Empire residing on the coast. The root of the conflict traces back to 1823 when Sir [[Charles MacCarthy (British Army officer)|Charles MacCarthy]], resisting all overtures by the Ashanti to negotiate, led an invading force.  The Ashanti defeated this, killed MacCarthy, took his head for a trophy and swept on to the coast. However, disease forced them back. The Ashanti were so successful in subsequent fighting that in 1826 they again moved on the coast. At first they fought very impressively in an open battle against superior numbers of British allied forces, including Denkyirans. However, the novelty of British rockets caused the Ashanti army to withdraw.<ref>Lloyd, pp. 39-53.</ref> In 1831, a treaty led to 30 years of peace, with the [[Pra River (Ghana)|Pra River]] accepted as the border.\n\n====Second Anglo-Ashanti War====\n[[File:Anglo-Ashanti war 1.jpg|thumb|Ashanti Kingdom force engaged with the British [[42nd Highlanders]];''[[The Graphic]]''.<ref name=\"Anglo-Ashanti wars\">''[[Anglo-Ashanti wars]]''</ref>]]\nWith the exception of a few Ashanti light skirmishes across the Pra in 1853 and 1854, the peace between the Ashanti Kingdom and the British Empire had remained unbroken for over 30 years. Then, in 1863, a large Ashanti delegation crossed the river pursuing a fugitive, Kwesi Gyana. There was fighting, casualties on both sides, but the governor's request for troops from England was declined and sickness forced the withdrawal of his West Indian troops. The war ended in 1864 as a stalemate with both sides losing more men to sickness than any other factor.\n\n====Third Anglo-Ashanti War====\nIn 1869 a European missionary family was taken to Kumasi. They were hospitably welcomed and were used as an excuse for war in 1873. Also, Britain took control of Ashanti land claimed by the Dutch. The Ashanti invaded the new British protectorate. [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|General Wolseley]] and his famous [[Wolseley ring]] were sent against the Ashanti. This was a modern war, replete with press coverage (including by the renowned reporter [[Henry Morton Stanley]]) and printed precise military and medical instructions to the troops.<ref>Lloyd, pp. 88\u2013102.</ref> The British government refused appeals to interfere with British armaments manufacturers who were unrestrained in selling to both sides.<ref>Lloyd, p. 96.</ref>\n\nAll Ashanti attempts at negotiations were disregarded. Wolseley led 2,500 British troops and several thousand West Indian and African troops to Kumasi. The capital was briefly occupied. The British were impressed by the size of the palace and the scope of its contents, including \"rows of books in many languages.\"<ref>Lloyd, pp. 172-74.</ref> The Ashanti had abandoned the capital after a bloody war. The British burned it.<ref>Lloyd, p. 175.</ref>\n\n[[File:Prempeh-124-palaver-and-submission.jpg|thumb|In January 1896, the British formally annexed the Ashanti Kingdom to the [[British Empire]].]]\nThe British and their allies suffered considerable casualties in the war losing numerous soldiers and high ranking army officers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DFEBAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gikDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5217,1873174&dq=ashantee&hl=en|title=The Daily Advertiser - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513112122/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DFEBAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gikDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5217,1873174&dq=ashantee&hl=en|archive-date=13 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> but in the end the firepower was too much to overcome for the Ashanti.  The Asantehene (the king of the Ashanti) signed a British treaty in July 1874 to end the war.\n\n====Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War====\n{{See also|Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War}}\nIn 1895, the Ashanti turned down an unofficial offer to become a British protectorate.\n\nThe Ashanti Kingdom wanting to keep French and European colonial forces out of the Ashanti Kingdom territory (and its gold), the British were anxious to conquer the Ashanti Kingdom once and for all. Despite being in talks with the kingdom about making it a British protectorate, Britain began the Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War in 1895 on the pretext of failure to pay the fines levied on the Asante monarch after the 1874 war. The British were victorious and the Ashanti Kingdom was forced to sign a treaty.\n\n==Culture and society==\n{{see also|Ashanti people}}\n\n===Family===\n[[File:Bonnat Aschantidorf.jpg|right|thumb| Ashanti Kingdom family and city [[neighbourhood]], {{Circa|1873}}.]]\nStanding among families was largely political. The royal family typically topped the hierarchy, followed by the families of the [[Tribal chiefs|chiefs]] of territorial divisions. In each [[chiefdom]], a particular female line provides the chief. A committee of several men eligible for the post elects the chief.\n\n===Clothing===\n{{Main|Kente cloth}}\n\n===Education and children===\n[[File:Aquasi Boachi and Quamin Poko by JL Cornet.jpg|thumb|left|Princes [[Kwasi Boakye]] and Kwame Poku, {{Circa|1840}}.]]\nEducation in the Ashanti Kingdom was conducted by Asante and imported scholars and Ashanti people would often attend schools in Europe for their [[higher education]].\n\nTolerant parents are typical among the Ashanti. Childhood is considered a happy time and children cannot be responsible for their actions. The child is not responsible for their actions until after [[puberty]]. A child is harmless and there is no worry for the control of their [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], the original purpose of all [[funeral|funeral rites]], so the ritual funerals typically given to the deceased Ashanti are not as lavish for the children.\n\nThe Ashanti adored twins when they were born within the [[royal family]] because they were seen as a sign of impending fortune. Ordinarily, boy twins joined the army and twin girls potential wives of the King. If the twins are a boy and girl, no particular career awaits them. Women who bear [[multiple birth|triplets]] are greatly honored because three is regarded as a lucky number. Special [[ritual]]s ensue for the third, sixth, and ninth child. The fifth child (unlucky five) can expect misfortune. Families with many children are well respected and barren women scoffed at.\n\n===Menstruation and impurity===\nThe Ashanti held [[puberty rite]]s only for females. Fathers instruct their sons without public observance. The privacy of boys was respected in the Ashanti kingdom. As [[menstruation]] approaches, a girl goes to her mother's house. When the girl's menstruation is disclosed, the mother announces the good news in the village beating an iron hoe with a stone. Old women come out and sing ''Bara'' (menstrual) songs.\n\nMenstruating women suffered numerous restrictions. The Ashanti viewed them as ritually unclean. They did not cook for men, nor did they eat any food cooked for a man. If a menstruating woman entered the ancestral [[Flush toilet|stool]] (shrine) house, she was arrested, and the punishment could result in death. If this punishment is not exacted, the Ashanti believe, the ghost of the [[ancestor]]s would strangle the [[Tribal chief|chief]]. Menstruating women lived in special houses during their periods as they were forbidden to cross the threshold of men's houses. They swore no [[oath]]s and no oaths were sworn for or against them. They did not participate in any of the [[ceremony|ceremonial]] observances and did not visit any [[sacred]] places.\n\n===Healthcare and death===\n[[File:Ashanti soulwasher by Claire H.jpg|right|thumb|Ashanti soulwasher]]\nSickness and death were major events in the [[Monarchy|kingdom]]. The ordinary [[herbalist]] divined the [[supernatural]] cause of the illness and treated it with [[herbal medicine]]s.\n\n[[File:Bonnat AschantiPriester.jpg|thumb|left|Ashanti Kingdom traditional [[priest]] performing an [[Akan religion|Akan religious]] ceremony, {{Circa |1873}}, by [[Jules Gros]].]]\n\nPeople loathed being alone for long without someone available to perform this [[rite]] before the sick collapsed. The family dressed the deceased in their best clothes, and adorned them with packets of gold dust (money for the after-life), ornaments, and food for the journey \"up the hill\". The body was normally buried within 24 hours. Until that time the funeral party engage in dancing, drumming, shooting of guns, all accompanied by the wailing of relatives. This was done because the Ashanti typically believed that death was not something to be sad about, but rather a part of life. As the Ashanti believed in an after-life, families felt they would be reunited with their ancestors upon death. Funeral rites for the death of a king involved the whole kingdom and were a much more elaborate affair.\n\n===Ceremony===\nThe greatest and most frequent [[ceremony|ceremonies]] of the Ashanti recalled the spirits of departed rulers with an offering of food and drink, asking their favor for the common good, called the ''[[Adae Festival|Adae]]''. The day before the ''Adae'', [[Akan Drum|Akan drums]] broadcast the approaching ceremonies. The stool treasurer gathers sheep and liquor that will be offered. The chief priest officiates the ''Adae'' in the stool house where the ancestors came. The [[priest]] offers each food and a beverage. The public ceremony occurs outdoors, where all the people joined the dancing. Minstrels chant [[ritual]] phrases; the talking drums extol the chief and the ancestors in traditional phrases. The ''Odwera'', the other large ceremony, occurs in September and typically lasted for a week or two. It is a time of cleansing of sin from society the defilement, and for the purification of [[shrine]]s of ancestors and the gods. After the [[sacrifice]] and feast of a black [[Hen (bird)|hen]]\u2014of which both the living and the dead share\u2014a new year begins in which all are clean, strong, and healthy.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[African military systems (1800\u20131900)]]\n* [[African military systems after 1900]]\n* [[African military systems to 1800]]\n* [[Akyempimhene]]\n* [[Anglo-Ashanti wars]]\n* [[Ashanti people|Ashantis]]\n* [[History of Ghana]]\n* [[List of rulers of Asante]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-37710/Asante-empire the Ashanti Kingdom Encyclopedia -

It expanded from [[Ashanti Region|Ashanti]] to include the [[Brong-Ahafo Region]], [[Central Region (Ghana)|Central Region]], [[Eastern Region (Ghana)|Eastern Region]], [[Greater Accra Region]] and [[Western Region (Ghana)|Western Region]] of present-day [[Ghana]]. Due to the empire's military prowess, wealth, architecture, sophisticated hierarchy and culture, the Ashanti Kingdom has been extensively studied and has more [[historiographies]] by European, primarily British authors than any other indigenous culture of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].<ref name=\"Collins and Burns (2007), p. 140.\">Collins and Burns (2007), p. 140.</ref> \n\nStarting in the late 17th century, the Ashanti king [[Osei Tutu]] ({{circa| 1695}} &ndash; 1717) and his adviser [[Okomfo Anokye]] established the Ashanti Kingdom, with the [[Asante royal thrones|Golden Stool of Asante]] as a sole unifying symbol.

The current king of the Ashanti Kingdom is [[Otumfuo Nana Osei Tutu II|Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Asantehene]]. The Ashanti Kingdom is the home to [[Lake Bosumtwi]], Ghana's only natural lake. The state's current economic revenue is derived mainly from trading in [[gold bar]]s, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[kola nut]]s and [[agriculture]]; forests has also been cleared to plant [[cassava]], [[maize]] and [[yam (vegetable)|yams]].<ref name=\"Collins and Burns\">Collins and Burns (2007), p. 139.</ref>\n\n==Etymology and origins==\n[[File:KenteCloth.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kente cloth, the traditional garment worn by Ashanti royalty, has been widely adopted throughout the Ashanti Kingdom.]]\n\nThe name ''Asante'' means \"because of war\". The word derives from the [[Twi]] words ''\u0254sa'' meaning \"war\" and ''nti'' meaning \"because of\". This name comes from the Asante's origin as a kingdom created to fight the [[Denkyira]] kingdom.\n\nThe variant name \"Ashanti\" comes from British reports that transcribing \"Asante\" as the British heard it pronounced, ''as-hanti''. The hyphenation was subsequently dropped and the name ''Ashanti'' remained, with various spellings including ''Ashantee'' common into the early 20th century.\n\nBetween the 10th and 12th centuries AD the ethnic [[Akan people]] migrated into the forest belt of Southern Ghana and established several Akan states: \n* [[Ashanti Region|Ashanti]], \n* [[Brong-Ahafo Region|Brong-Ahafo]], \n* [[Assin]]-Denkyira-[[Fante Confederacy]]-[[Mankessim Kingdom]] (present-day [[Central Region, Ghana|Central region]])\n* [[Akyem]]-[[Akwamu]]-[[Akuapem people|Akuapem]]-[[Kwahu]] (present-day [[Eastern Region, Ghana|Eastern region]] and [[Greater Accra Region|Greater Accra]]), and \n* [[Ahanta]]-[[Aowin]]-[[Sefwi people|Sefwi]]-[[Wassa]] (present-day [[Western Region, Ghana|Western region]]).\n\nBefore the Ashanti Kingdom had contact with Europeans, it had a flourishing trade with other African states due to the Ashanti [[gold]] wealth.

According to legend, a meeting of all the clan heads of each of the Ashanti settlements was called just prior to declaring independence from [[Denkyira]]. In this meeting the Golden Stool was commanded down from the heavens by Okomfo Anokye, chief-priest or sage advisor to Asantehene Osei Tutu I and floated down from the heavens into the lap of Osei Tutu I. Okomfo [[Anokye]] declared the stool to be symbolic of the new Asante Union (''the Ashanti Kingdom''), and allegiance was sworn to the stool and to Osei Tutu as the Asantehene.

The [[Ashanti Kingdom]] utterly defeated them at the [[Battle of Feyiase]], proclaiming its independence in 1701. Subsequently, through hard line force of arms and savoir-faire diplomacy, the duo induced the leaders of the other Ashanti city-states to declare allegiance and adherence to [[Kumasi]], the Ashanti capital. From the beginning, King Osei Tutu and priest [[Okomfo Anokye|Anokye]] followed an expansionist and an imperialistic provincial foreign policy. According to folklore, Okomfo Anokye is believed to have visited [[Akrofonso|Agona-Akrofonso]].<ref name=\"History of the Ashanti Empire\"/>\n\n===Under Osei Tutu===\n[[File:Kumasi.png|thumb|Image of an Ashanti home in [[Kumasi]], before British colonization.]]\nRealizing the strengths of a loose confederation of Akan states, Osei Tutu strengthened centralization of the surrounding Akan groups and expanded the powers of the judiciary system within the centralized government. This loose confederation of small city-states grew into a kingdom and eventually an empire looking to expand its borders. Newly conquered areas had the option of joining the empire or becoming tributary states.<ref>Giblert, Erik ''Africa in World History: From Prehistory to the Present'' 2004</ref> [[Opoku Ware I]], Osei Tutu's successor, extended the borders, embracing much of Ghana's territory.<ref>Shillington, loc. cit.</ref>\n\n===European contact===\n[[File:Ashanti English Medieval Ewer.jpg|thumb|The [[Asante Ewer]] was made in [[England]] during reign of [[Richard II]] (1377\u20131399) and was discovered in 1896 in the Asante kingdom. The front of the jug bears the royal arms of England and each of the facets of the lid contains a [[lion]] and a [[stag]]. These symbols date the jug to the last 9 years of Richard's reign, when he adopted the badge of the white hart. Two more English bronze jugs from the same period were found at [[Kumasi]], the Asante capital, at the time as this example. Perhaps all 3 were a set from the household of Richard II. How they came to the west coast of [[Africa]] remains a mystery, but there was extensive trade between West Africa and Western Europe  across the Sahara Desert in the Middle Ages. Now it is in the [[British Museum]], [[London]].]]\nEuropean contact with the Asante on the [[Gulf of Guinea]] coast region of Africa began in the 15th century. This led to trade in [[gold]], [[ivory]], [[Slavery|slaves]], and other goods with the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], which gave rise to kingdoms such as the Ashanti. On May 15, 1817 the Englishman [[Thomas Edward Bowdich|Thomas Bowdich]] entered Kumasi.

The welfare of their slaves varied from being able to acquire wealth and intermarry with the master's family to being [[Human sacrifice|sacrificed]] in funeral ceremonies. The Ashanti believed that slaves would follow their masters into the afterlife. Slaves could sometimes own other slaves, and could also request a new master if the slave believed he or she was being severely mistreated.<ref>[[Alfred Burdon Ellis]],\n[https://archive.org/details/tshispeakingpeo01elligoog/page/n302 <!-- pg=290 --> , ''The Tshi-speaking peoples of the Gold Coast of West Africa''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610125849/https://books.google.com/books?id=jtMSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA290 |date=2016-06-10 }}, \n1887. p. 290</ref><ref>Rodriguez, Junius P.

He preferred such an arrangement to that of a free woman in a conventional marriage, because marriage to an enslaved woman allowed the children to inherit some of the father's [[property]] and status.\n\nThis favored arrangement occurred primarily because of what some men considered their conflict with the [[matrilineality|matrilineal]] system. Under this kinship system, children were considered born into the mother's clan and took their status from her family. Generally her eldest brother served as mentor to her children, particularly for the boys. She was protected by her family. Some Ashanti men felt more comfortable taking a slave girl or pawn wife in marriage, as she would have no ''[[abusua]]'' (older male grandfather, father, uncle or brother) to intercede on her behalf when the couple argued. With an enslaved wife, the master and husband had total control of their children, as she had no kin in the community.\n\n===British relations===\nIn December 1895, the British left Cape Coast with an expeditionary force. It arrived in Kumasi in January 1896 under the command of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]].<ref>\"The Downfall of Prepmeh\" by Robert Baden-Powell, 1896, the American edition is available for download at http://www.thedump.scoutscan.com/dumpinventorybp.php {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027155154/http://www.thedump.scoutscan.com/dumpinventorybp.php |date=2016-10-27 }}</ref> The Asantehene (king) directed the Ashanti to not resist, as he feared a [[genocide]]. Shortly thereafter, Governor William Maxwell arrived in Kumasi as well.\n\nBritain [[annexation|annexed]] the territories of the Ashanti and the Fanti. Asantehene Agyeman Prempeh was deposed and arrested, and he and other Ashanti leaders were sent into exile in the [[Seychelles]]. The Asante Union was dissolved{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}. The British formally declared the state of the Ashanti Kingdom and the coastal regions to be the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] colony. A [[British Resident]] was permanently placed in the city of Kumasi, and soon after a British fort was built there{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}.\n\n===Uprisings of 1900 and since 1935===\nAs a final measure of resistance, the remaining Asante court not exiled to the Seychelles mounted an offensive against the British Residents at the Kumasi Fort. The resistance was led by Asante queen [[Yaa Asantewaa]], Queen-Mother of Ejisu. From March 28 to late September 1900, the Asante and British were engaged in what would become known as the [[War of the Golden Stool]]. In the end, the British were victorious; they exiled Asantewaa and other Asante leaders to the Seychelles to join Asante King Prempeh I.\n\nIn January 1902, Britain finally designated the Ashanti Kingdom as a [[Ashanti Protectorate|protectorate]]. the Ashanti Kingdom was restored to self-rule on 31 January 1935. Asante King Prempeh II was restored in 1957, and the Ashanti Kingdom entered a [[Political union|state union]] with Ghana on independence from the United Kingdom.\n\n===Territorial history timeline===\n{{History Timeline of Ashanti}}\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{cleanup-tense|section|date=September 2013}}\n[[File:Prempeh I.jpg|thumb|[[Prempeh I]], [[Asantehene]] from 1888 to 1931.]]\n\nThe Ashanti government was built upon a sophisticated [[bureaucracy]] in Kumasi, with separate [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]] to handle the state's affairs. Of particular note was Ashanti's Foreign Office based in Kumasi; despite its small size, it allowed the state to pursue complex negotiations with foreign powers. The Office was divided into departments to handle relations separately with the [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]], and [[Arab]]s. Scholars of Ashanti history, such as [[Larry Yarak]] and [[Ivor Wilks|Ivor Wilkes]], disagree over the power of this sophisticated bureaucracy in comparison to the Asantehene, but agree that it was a sign of a highly developed government with a complex system of [[Separation of powers|checks and balances]].\n\n===Asantehene===\nAt the top of Ashanti's power structure sat the ''[[List of rulers of Asante|Asantehene]]'', the King of Ashanti. Each Asantahene was enthroned on the sacred Golden Stool, the Sika 'dwa, an object that came to symbolise the very power of the King. Osei Kwadwo (1764\u20131777) began the [[meritocratic]] system of appointing central officials according to their ability, rather than their birth.<ref>Shillington, p. 195.</ref>\n\nAs King, the ''Asantehene'' held immense power in Ashanti, but did not enjoy [[absolute monarchy|absolute royal rule]]. He was obliged to share considerable legislative and executive powers with Asante's sophisticated bureaucracy. But the ''Asantehene'' was the only person in Ashanti permitted to invoke the [[Capital punishment|death sentence]] in cases of crime. During wartime, the King acted as Supreme Commander of the army, although during the 19th century, the fighting was increasingly handled by the Ministry of War in Kumasi. Each member of the confederacy was also obliged to send annual tribute to Kumasi.\n\nThe ''Ashantihene'' (King of all Ashanti) reigned over all and was King of the division of Kumasi, the nation's capital, and the Ashanti Kingdom. He was elected in the same manner as all other chiefs. In this hierarchical structure, every chief or King swore fealty to the one above him\u2014from village and subdivision, to division, to the chief of Kumasi, and finally the ''Ashantihene'' swore fealty to the [[Sovereign state|State]].\n\nThe [[elder (administrative title)|elders]] circumscribed the power of the ''Ashantihene'', and the chiefs of other divisions considerably checked the power of the King. This in practical effect created a system of checks and balances. As the symbol of the nation, the ''Ashantihene'' received significant deference ritually, for the context was religious in that he was a symbol of the people in the flesh: the living, dead or yet to be born. When the king committed an act not approved of by the counsel of elders or the people, he could possibly be [[impeachment|impeached]], and demoted to a commoner.\n\nThe existence of [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] organizations and the [[Council of State|council]] of elders is evidence of an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] tendency in Ashanti political life. Though older men tend to [[monopoly|monopolize]] political power, Ashanti instituted an organization of young men, the ''nmerante'', that tend to [[democratize]] and [[liberalization|liberalize]] the political process. The council of elders undertake actions only after consulting a representative of the ''nmerante''. Their views must be taken seriously and added into the conversation.\n\n===Obirempon===\nBelow the Asantahene, local power was invested in the ''obirempon'' of each locale. The ''obirempon'' (literally \"big man\") was personally selected by the Asantahene and was generally of loyal, noble lineage, frequently related to the Asantahene. ''Obirempon''s had a fair amount of legislative power in their regions, more than the local nobles of Dahomey but less than the regional governors of the Oyo Empire. In addition to handling the region's administrative and economic matters, the ''obirempon'' also acted as the Supreme Judge of the region, presiding over court cases.\n\n===Residence===\n{{multiple image\n| header = \n| footer = <center>Former and Current Residences of Asantehene.</center>\n| align     = right\n| image1   = King_Koffee_Palace.jpg\n| width1   = 250\n| alt1     = 300\n| caption1 = 1874 Former palace of Asantehene being burned and ransacked by the British after the Third Anglo-Ashanti War.\n| image2   = Manhyia Palace Museum.jpg \n| width2   = 275\n| alt2     = 300\n| caption2 = Manhyia Palace.

From European accounts, the edifice was massive and ornately built. In 1819, English traveler and author, [[Thomas Edward Bowdich]] described the palace as <blockquote> ...an immense building of a variety of oblong courts and regular squares [with] [[entablature]]s exuberantly adorned with bold fan and trellis work of Egyptian character. They have a suite of rooms over them, with small windows of wooden lattice, of intricate but regular carved work, and some have frames cased with thin gold. The squares have a large apartment on each side, open in front, with two supporting pillars, which break the view and give it all the appearance of the proscenium or front of the stage of the older Italian theaters. They are lofty and regular, and the cornices of a very bold cane-work in alto-relievo. A drop-curtain of curiously plaited cane is suspended in front, and in each, we observed chairs and stools embossed with gold, and beds of silk, with scattered regalia.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QQgwAAAAYAAJ&dq|page=291|title=The Monthly Review, Or, Literary Journal|year=1819}}</ref> </blockquote>[[Winwood Reade]] also described his visit to the Ashanti Royal Palace of Kumasi in 1874:\n\n\u201cWe went to the king\u2019s palace, which consists of many courtyards, each surrounded with alcoves and verandahs, and having two gates or doors, so that each yard was a thoroughfare . . . But the part of the palace fronting the street was a stone house, Moorish in its style . . . with a flat roof and a parapet, and suites of apartments on the first floor. It was built by Fanti masons many years ago. The rooms upstairs remind me of Wardour Street. Each was a perfect Old Curiosity Shop. Books in many languages, Bohemian glass, clocks, silver plate, old furniture, Persian rugs, Kidderminster carpets, pictures and engravings, numberless chests and coffers. A sword bearing the inscription From Queen Victoria to the King of Ashantee. A copy of the Times, 17 October 1843. With these were many specimens of Moorish and Ashanti handicraft.\u201d<gallery>\nFile:BOWDICH(1819) p338 PLATE 5 - COOMASSIE, ODUMATA'S SLEEPING ROOM.jpg|Odumata's Sleeping Room (1819).\nFile:BOWDICH(1819) p341 PLATE 7 - COOMASSIE, PART OF A PIAZZA IN THE PALACE.jpg|Piazza in the Palace (1819).\nFile:BOWDICH(1819) p344 PLATE 9 - COOMASSIE, PART OF ADAM STREET.jpg|Adam Street (1819).\n</gallery>\n\n===Elections===\n[[File:BOWDICH(1819) p341 PLATE 8 - COOMASSIE, PART OF A PIAZZA IN THE PALACE.jpg|thumb|left|Plaza of the King's Palace circa 1819.]]\n\nThe [[election]] of Kings and the Asantehene (''King of Kings or emperor'' ) himself followed a pattern. The senior female of the kingly lineage nominated the eligible males. This senior female then consulted the elders, male and female, of that line. The final candidate is then selected. That nomination is then sent to a council of elders, who represent other lineages in the [[town]] or [[district]]. The Elders then present the nomination to the assembled people.\n\nIf the assembled [[citizenship|citizens]] disapprove of the nominee, the process is restarted. Chosen, the new Kings is en-stooled by the Elders, who admonish him with expectations. The chosen Kings swears a solemn oath to the [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth Goddess]] and to his ancestors to fulfill his duties honorably in which he [[Sacrifice|\"sacrifices\"]] himself and his life for the betterment of the ''Oman/Aman'' (state(s).\n\nThis elected and en-stooled King enjoys a great majestic [[ceremony]] to this day with much spectacle and celebration. He reigns with much [[despotism|despotic]] power, including the ability to make judgments of life and death on his subjects. However, he does not enjoy [[absolute rule]]. Upon the stool, the King is sacred, the holy intermediary between people and ancestors. His powers theoretically are more apparent than real. His powers hinge on his attention to the advice and decisions of the Council of Elders. The King can be impeached, de-stooled (de-throned), if the Elders and the people turn against him. He can be reduced to man, subject to derision for his failure.\n\n==Legal system==\n{{More footnotes|section|date=July 2013}}\n [[File:Bonnat GrandChefs.jpg|thumb|300px|The Ashanti Kingdom Obirempons, {{Circa|1873}}, [[Visual arts|Visual Art]] by [[Jules Gros]].]]\n\nThe Ashanti state, in effect, was a [[theocracy]]. It invokes religious, rather than [[secularity|secular]]-legal postulates. What the modern state views as [[crime]]s, Ashanti view practically as [[sin]]s. Antisocial acts disrespect the ancestors, and are only secondarily harmful to the [[community]]. If the chief or [[King]] fails to punish such acts, he invokes the anger of the ancestors and the gods, and is therefore in danger of [[impeachment]]. The penalty for some crimes (sins) is death, but this is seldom imposed; a more common penalty is [[Exile|banishment]] or [[incarceration|imprisonment]].\n\nThe King typically exacts or [[commutation of sentence|commutes]] all [[capital punishment|capital cases]]. These commuted sentences by King and chiefs sometimes occur by [[ransom]] or [[bribery|bribe]]; they are regulated in such a way that they should not be mistaken for [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], but are considered as [[revenue]] to the state, which for the most part welcomes [[wikt:quarrel|quarrel]]s and [[lawsuit|litigation]]. [[Commutation of sentence|Commutations]] tend to be far more frequent than [[Capital punishment|executions]].\n\nAshanti are repulsed by [[murder]], and [[suicide]] is considered murder. They decapitate those who commit suicide, the conventional punishment for murder. The suicide thus had contempt for the court, for only the King may kill an Ashanti.\n\nIn a [[murder]] [[trial]], intent must be established. If the [[homicide]] is accidental, the murderer pays compensation to the lineage of the deceased. The [[insanity|insane]] cannot be executed because of the absence of responsible intent - except for murder or cursing the King; in the case of cursing the king, drunkenness is a valid defense. [[Capital punishment|Capital crimes]] include murder, [[incest]] within the female or male line, and intercourse with a [[menstrual cycle|menstruating]] woman, [[rape]] of a married woman, and [[adultery]] with any of the wives of a chief or the King. [[Assault]]s or insults of a chief or the [[court]] or the King also carried [[capital punishment]].\n\nCursing the King, calling down powers to harm the King, is considered an unspeakable act and carries the weight of [[death]]. One who invokes another to commit such an act must pay a heavy indemnity. Practitioners of harmful (evil) forms of [[Witchcraft|sorcery]] and witchcraft receive death but not by decapitation, for their blood must not be shed. They receive execution by strangling, burning, or drowning.\n\nOrdinarily, families or lineages settle disputes between individuals. Nevertheless, such disputes can be brought to [[trial (law)|trial]] before a chief by uttering the [[taboo]] oath of a chief or the King. In the end, the [[Noble court|King's Court]] is the sentencing court, for only the King can order the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]]. Before the Council of Elders and the King's Court, the litigants orate comprehensively. Anyone present can cross-examine the defendant or the accuser, and if the proceedings do not lead to a [[verdict]], a special witness is called to provide additional [[testimony]]. If there is only one witness, their sworn oath assures the truth is told. Moreover, that he favors or is hostile to either litigant is unthinkable. Cases with no witness, like sorcery or adultery are settled by ordeals, like drinking [[poison]].\n\n[[Veneration of the dead|Ancestor Veneration]] establishes the Ashanti [[morality|moral system]], and it provides the principal foundation for [[government]]al sanctions. The link between mother and child centers the entire network, which includes ancestors and fellow men as well. Its [[judiciary|judicial system]] emphasizes the Ashanti conception of rectitude and good [[behavior]], which favors harmony among the people. The rules were made by '''''Nyame''''' (Supreme [[God]]) and the ancestors, and one must behave accordingly.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana.jpg|thumb|Asante [[Mountain]]s and [[Lake Bosumtwi]] natural [[lake]].]]\n\nThe Ashanti Empire was one of a series of kingdoms along the coast including Dahomey, [[Benin]], and [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]]. The Ashanti Kingdom had mountains and large [[Agriculture|agricultural]] surpluses.<ref name=\"Obeng, J. Pashington page 20\">Obeng, J. Pashington: \"Asante Catholicism: Religious and Cultural Reproduction Among the Akan of Ghana\", p. 20. BRILL, 1996.</ref> The southern part of the Ashanti Kingdom is covered with moist semi-[[deciduous forest]] whilst the [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic|Guinea savanna]] covers the northern part of the Ashanti Kingdom. The Guinea Savanna consists of short deciduous and [[Dutch elm disease#Resistant trees|fire resistant trees]]. [[Riparian forest]]s also occur along the [[Afram River]] and streams of the savanna zone. Soils in the Ashanti Kingdom are mainly of two types, [[forest]] ochrosols in southern the Ashanti Kingdom whilst the [[savanna]] ochrosols are confined to northern the Ashanti Kingdom.<ref name=\"Obeng, J. Pashington page 20\"/>\n\nThe predominant [[fauna]] or food rich wildlife and animal species encountered in the Ashanti Kingdom were the [[Hen (bird)|hen]], [[sheep]], [[goat]], [[duck]], [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]], [[rabbit]], [[Guineafowl|guinea fowl]], [[fish]], and the [[porcupine]] which became the national emblem of the Ashanti Kingdom, as well as about thirty multipurpose [[flora]] species of trees and [[shrub]]s and over thirty-five ornamental plants beautifying the Ashanti Kingdom environs. These tree/shrub-crop-animal (hen/fish) components were intensively integrated spatially and/or sequentially on the same land unit of individual Asante houses.<ref name=\"Obeng, J.

Bowdich]].]]\nThe Ashanti prepared the fields by burning before the onset of the rainy season and cultivated with an iron [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]. Fields are left fallow for a couple years, usually after two to four years of cultivation. Plants cultivated include [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, [[yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[Cassava|manioc]], [[maize|corn]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[millet]], [[bean]]s, [[onion]]s, [[peanut]]s, [[tomato]]es, and many [[fruit]]s. Manioc and corn are New World transplants introduced during the [[Atlantic slave trade|Atlantic European trade]]. Many of these [[vegetable]] crops could be harvested twice a year and the [[cassava]] (manioc), after a two-year growth, provides a starchy root. The Ashanti transformed [[palm wine]], maize and millet into [[beer]], a favorite drink; and made use of the oil from palm for many culinary and domestic uses.{{clear|left}}\n\n===Infrastructure===\nInfrastructure such as [[road transport]] and [[communication]] throughout the Ashanti Kingdom was maintained via a network of well-kept [[road]]s from the Ashanti Kingdom to the [[Niger River|Niger river]] and other trade cities.<ref name=\"Davidson (1991)\">Davidson (1991), p. 240.</ref><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 140&ndash;141.</ref>\n\n===Communication===\n[[File:Brit Mus 13sept10 brooches etc 062.jpg|thumb|Akan drum]]\nThe Ashanti invented the [[Fontomfrom]], an Asante [[talking drum]], and they also invented the [[Akan Drum]]. They drummed messages to distances of over {{convert|200|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}}, as rapidly as a [[telegraphy|telegraph]]. [[Asante dialect]] (Twi) and [[Akan language|Akan]], the language of the [[Ashanti people]] is tonal and more meaning is generated by tone.\n\nThe drums reproduced these tones, punctuations, and the accents of a phrase so that the cultivated ear hears the entirety of the phrase itself.\n\nThe Ashanti readily heard and understood the phrases produced by these \"talking drums\". Standard phrases called for meetings of the chiefs or to arms, warned of danger, and broadcast announcements of the death of important figures. Some drums were used for [[proverb]]s and ceremonial presentations.\n\n==Demography==\nThe population history of the Ashanti Kingdom was one of slow centralization. In the early 19th century the Asantehene used the annual tribute to set up a permanent standing army armed with [[rifle]]s, which allowed much closer control of the Ashanti Kingdom. The Ashanti Kingdom was one of the most centralised states in sub-Saharan Africa. Osei Tutu and his successors oversaw a policy of political and cultural unification and the union had reached its full extent by 1750. It remained an alliance of several large city-states which acknowledged the sovereignty of the ruler of Kumasi and the Ashanti Kingdom, known as the Asantehene. The Ashanti Kingdom had dense populations, allowing the creation of substantial [[urban centre]]s.<ref name=\"Obeng, J.

The political genius of the symbolic \"golden stool\" and the fusing effect of a national army however, provided the unity needed to keep the empire viable. Total potential strength was some 80,000 to 200,000 making the Ashanti army bigger than the well known Zulu, and comparable to possibly Africa's largest- the legions of Ethiopia.<ref name=\"Vandervort, op. cit\">Vandervort (1998).</ref> The Ashanti army was described as a fiercely organized one whose king could \"bring 200,000 men into the field and whose warriors were evidently not cowed by [[Snider\u2013Enfield|Snider rifles]] and 7-pounder guns\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZCE1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=9iYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6500,6374935&dq=ashantee&hl=en |title=News.google.com: ''The Newfoundlander - Dec 16, 1873''. |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313050055/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZCE1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=9iYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6500,6374935&dq=ashantee&hl=en |archive-date=March 13, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\nWhile actual forces deployed in the field were less than ''potential'' strength, tens of thousands of soldiers were usually available to serve the needs of the empire. Mobilization depended on small cadres of regulars, who guided and directed levees and contingents called up from provincial governors. Organization was structured around an advance guard, main body, rear guard and two right and left wing flanking elements. This provided flexibility in the forest country the Ashanti armies typically operated in. The approach to the battlefield was typically via converging columns, and tactics included ambushes and extensive maneuvers on the wings. Unique among African armies, the Ashanti deployed medical units to support their fighters. This force was to expand the empire substantially and continually for over a century, and defeated the British in several encounters.<ref name=\"Vandervort, op. cit\"/>\n\n===Wars of the Asante===\n[[File:Ashantee soldier2.jpg|thumb|Ashanti Kingdom [[soldier]], {{Circa|1824}}, by [[Joseph Dupuis]].]]\nFrom 1806 until 1896, the Ashanti Kingdom was in a perpetual state of war involving expansion or defense of its domain. Ashanti exploits against other African forces made it the paramount power in the region. Its impressive performance against the British also earned it the respect of European powers.\n\n===Asante\u2013Fante War===\nIn 1806, the Ashanti pursued two rebel leaders through Fante territory to the coast. The British refusal to surrender the rebels led to an Ashanti attack. This was devastating enough that the British handed over a rebel; the other escaped.<ref>Lloyd, pp. 24-27.</ref> In 1807 disputes with the [[Fante people|Fante]] led to the [[Ashanti\u2013Fante War]], in which the Ashanti were victorious under Asantehene Osei Bonsu (\"Osei, the whale\").\n\n===Ga\u2013Fante War===\nIn the 1811 [[Ga\u2013Fante War]], a coalition of Asante and Ga fought against an alliance of Fante, Akwapim and Akim states.  The Asante war machine was successful early on defeating the alliance in open combat. However, Asante were unable to completely crush their enemies and were forced to withdraw from the Akwapim hills in the face of unconventional warfare. They did, however, manage to capture a British fort.\n\n===Ashanti\u2013Akim\u2013Akwapim War===\nIn 1814 the Ashanti launched an invasion of the Gold Coast, largely to gain access to European traders. In the [[Ashanti\u2013Akim\u2013Akwapim War]], the kingdom faced the Akim\u2013Akwapim alliance. After several battles, some of which went in favor of the Asante and, some of which went in favor of the out numbered Akim\u2013Akwapim alliance the war ended. Even though the outnumbered Akim\u2013Akwapim won some key battles and had moments of glory by 1816, the Ashanti Kingdom was established on the coast.\n\n===Anglo-Ashanti Wars===\n{{Main|Anglo-Ashanti wars}}\n\n====First Anglo-Ashanti War====\n[[File:Aschanti Gefecht 11 july 1824 300dpi.jpg|thumb|left|The Ashanti Kingdom [[army]] engaged with [[British Armed Forces|British forces]] under the command of Col. Sutherland, July 11, 1824.]]\nThe first of the [[Anglo-Ashanti wars]] occurred in 1823. In these conflicts, the Ashanti Kingdom faced off, with varying degrees of success, against the British Empire residing on the coast. The root of the conflict traces back to 1823 when Sir [[Charles MacCarthy (British Army officer)|Charles MacCarthy]], resisting all overtures by the Ashanti to negotiate, led an invading force.  The Ashanti defeated this, killed MacCarthy, took his head for a trophy and swept on to the coast. However, disease forced them back. The Ashanti were so successful in subsequent fighting that in 1826 they again moved on the coast. At first they fought very impressively in an open battle against superior numbers of British allied forces, including Denkyirans. However, the novelty of British rockets caused the Ashanti army to withdraw.<ref>Lloyd, pp. 39-53.</ref> In 1831, a treaty led to 30 years of peace, with the [[Pra River (Ghana)|Pra River]] accepted as the border.\n\n====Second Anglo-Ashanti War====\n[[File:Anglo-Ashanti war 1.jpg|thumb|Ashanti Kingdom force engaged with the British [[42nd Highlanders]];''[[The Graphic]]''.<ref name=\"Anglo-Ashanti wars\">''[[Anglo-Ashanti wars]]''</ref>]]\nWith the exception of a few Ashanti light skirmishes across the Pra in 1853 and 1854, the peace between the Ashanti Kingdom and the British Empire had remained unbroken for over 30 years. Then, in 1863, a large Ashanti delegation crossed the river pursuing a fugitive, Kwesi Gyana. There was fighting, casualties on both sides, but the governor's request for troops from England was declined and sickness forced the withdrawal of his West Indian troops. The war ended in 1864 as a stalemate with both sides losing more men to sickness than any other factor.\n\n====Third Anglo-Ashanti War====\nIn 1869 a European missionary family was taken to Kumasi. They were hospitably welcomed and were used as an excuse for war in 1873. Also, Britain took control of Ashanti land claimed by the Dutch. The Ashanti invaded the new British protectorate. [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|General Wolseley]] and his famous [[Wolseley ring]] were sent against the Ashanti. This was a modern war, replete with press coverage (including by the renowned reporter [[Henry Morton Stanley]]) and printed precise military and medical instructions to the troops.<ref>Lloyd, pp. 88\u2013102.</ref> The British government refused appeals to interfere with British armaments manufacturers who were unrestrained in selling to both sides.<ref>Lloyd, p. 96.</ref>\n\nAll Ashanti attempts at negotiations were disregarded. Wolseley led 2,500 British troops and several thousand West Indian and African troops to Kumasi. The capital was briefly occupied. The British were impressed by the size of the palace and the scope of its contents, including \"rows of books in many languages.\"<ref>Lloyd, pp. 172-74.</ref> The Ashanti had abandoned the capital after a bloody war. The British burned it.<ref>Lloyd, p. 175.</ref>\n\n[[File:Prempeh-124-palaver-and-submission.jpg|thumb|In January 1896, the British formally annexed the Ashanti Kingdom to the [[British Empire]].]]\nThe British and their allies suffered considerable casualties in the war losing numerous soldiers and high ranking army officers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DFEBAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gikDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5217,1873174&dq=ashantee&hl=en|title=The Daily Advertiser - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513112122/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DFEBAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gikDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5217,1873174&dq=ashantee&hl=en|archive-date=13 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> but in the end the firepower was too much to overcome for the Ashanti.  The Asantehene (the king of the Ashanti) signed a British treaty in July 1874 to end the war.\n\n====Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War====\n{{See also|Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War}}\nIn 1895, the Ashanti turned down an unofficial offer to become a British protectorate.\n\nThe Ashanti Kingdom wanting to keep French and European colonial forces out of the Ashanti Kingdom territory (and its gold), the British were anxious to conquer the Ashanti Kingdom once and for all. Despite being in talks with the kingdom about making it a British protectorate, Britain began the Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War in 1895 on the pretext of failure to pay the fines levied on the Asante monarch after the 1874 war. The British were victorious and the Ashanti Kingdom was forced to sign a treaty.\n\n==Culture and society==\n{{see also|Ashanti people}}\n\n===Family===\n[[File:Bonnat Aschantidorf.jpg|right|thumb| Ashanti Kingdom family and city [[neighbourhood]], {{Circa|1873}}.]]\nStanding among families was largely political. The royal family typically topped the hierarchy, followed by the families of the [[Tribal chiefs|chiefs]] of territorial divisions. In each [[chiefdom]], a particular female line provides the chief. A committee of several men eligible for the post elects the chief.\n\n===Clothing===\n{{Main|Kente cloth}}\n\n===Education and children===\n[[File:Aquasi Boachi and Quamin Poko by JL Cornet.jpg|thumb|left|Princes [[Kwasi Boakye]] and Kwame Poku, {{Circa|1840}}.]]\nEducation in the Ashanti Kingdom was conducted by Asante and imported scholars and Ashanti people would often attend schools in Europe for their [[higher education]].\n\nTolerant parents are typical among the Ashanti. Childhood is considered a happy time and children cannot be responsible for their actions. The child is not responsible for their actions until after [[puberty]]. A child is harmless and there is no worry for the control of their [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], the original purpose of all [[funeral|funeral rites]], so the ritual funerals typically given to the deceased Ashanti are not as lavish for the children.\n\nThe Ashanti adored twins when they were born within the [[royal family]] because they were seen as a sign of impending fortune. Ordinarily, boy twins joined the army and twin girls potential wives of the King. If the twins are a boy and girl, no particular career awaits them. Women who bear [[multiple birth|triplets]] are greatly honored because three is regarded as a lucky number. Special [[ritual]]s ensue for the third, sixth, and ninth child. The fifth child (unlucky five) can expect misfortune. Families with many children are well respected and barren women scoffed at.\n\n===Menstruation and impurity===\nThe Ashanti held [[puberty rite]]s only for females. Fathers instruct their sons without public observance. The privacy of boys was respected in the Ashanti kingdom. As [[menstruation]] approaches, a girl goes to her mother's house. When the girl's menstruation is disclosed, the mother announces the good news in the village beating an iron hoe with a stone. Old women come out and sing ''Bara'' (menstrual) songs.\n\nMenstruating women suffered numerous restrictions. The Ashanti viewed them as ritually unclean. They did not cook for men, nor did they eat any food cooked for a man. If a menstruating woman entered the ancestral [[Flush toilet|stool]] (shrine) house, she was arrested, and the punishment could result in death. If this punishment is not exacted, the Ashanti believe, the ghost of the [[ancestor]]s would strangle the [[Tribal chief|chief]]. Menstruating women lived in special houses during their periods as they were forbidden to cross the threshold of men's houses. They swore no [[oath]]s and no oaths were sworn for or against them. They did not participate in any of the [[ceremony|ceremonial]] observances and did not visit any [[sacred]] places.\n\n===Healthcare and death===\n[[File:Ashanti soulwasher by Claire H.jpg|right|thumb|Ashanti soulwasher]]\nSickness and death were major events in the [[Monarchy|kingdom]]. The ordinary [[herbalist]] divined the [[supernatural]] cause of the illness and treated it with [[herbal medicine]]s.\n\n[[File:Bonnat AschantiPriester.jpg|thumb|left|Ashanti Kingdom traditional [[priest]] performing an [[Akan religion|Akan religious]] ceremony, {{Circa |1873}}, by [[Jules Gros]].]]\n\nPeople loathed being alone for long without someone available to perform this [[rite]] before the sick collapsed. The family dressed the deceased in their best clothes, and adorned them with packets of gold dust (money for the after-life), ornaments, and food for the journey \"up the hill\". The body was normally buried within 24 hours. Until that time the funeral party engage in dancing, drumming, shooting of guns, all accompanied by the wailing of relatives. This was done because the Ashanti typically believed that death was not something to be sad about, but rather a part of life. As the Ashanti believed in an after-life, families felt they would be reunited with their ancestors upon death. Funeral rites for the death of a king involved the whole kingdom and were a much more elaborate affair.\n\n===Ceremony===\nThe greatest and most frequent [[ceremony|ceremonies]] of the Ashanti recalled the spirits of departed rulers with an offering of food and drink, asking their favor for the common good, called the ''[[Adae Festival|Adae]]''. The day before the ''Adae'', [[Akan Drum|Akan drums]] broadcast the approaching ceremonies. The stool treasurer gathers sheep and liquor that will be offered. The chief priest officiates the ''Adae'' in the stool house where the ancestors came. The [[priest]] offers each food and a beverage. The public ceremony occurs outdoors, where all the people joined the dancing. Minstrels chant [[ritual]] phrases; the talking drums extol the chief and the ancestors in traditional phrases. The ''Odwera'', the other large ceremony, occurs in September and typically lasted for a week or two. It is a time of cleansing of sin from society the defilement, and for the purification of [[shrine]]s of ancestors and the gods. After the [[sacrifice]] and feast of a black [[Hen (bird)|hen]]\u2014of which both the living and the dead share\u2014a new year begins in which all are clean, strong, and healthy.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[African military systems (1800\u20131900)]]\n* [[African military systems after 1900]]\n* [[African military systems to 1800]]\n* [[Akyempimhene]]\n* [[Anglo-Ashanti wars]]\n* [[Ashanti people|Ashantis]]\n* [[History of Ghana]]\n* [[List of rulers of Asante]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-37710/Asante-empire the Ashanti Kingdom Encyclopedia - Britannica Online Encyclopedia]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060830012722/http://ling.ucsd.edu/courses/ling19/ling19langdis/twi.htm UC San Diego - Asante Language Program - Directed Study]\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/301013.stm BBC News | Africa | Funeral rites for Ashanti king]\n* [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9057534/Osei-Tutu the Ashanti Kingdom Osei Tutu Encyclopedia - Britannica Online Encyclopedia]\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zh9jIVu2CyEC&pg=PA20&dq=Asante+Empire,+square+miles&as_brr=3&sig=twD9fRMRljkQQ9wLY9g-fOlORkg Asante Catholicism at Googlebooks]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071024063513/http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/EthnoAtlas/Hmar/Cult_dir/Culture.7880 Ashanti Page] at the Ethnographic Atlas, maintained at Centre for Social Anthropology and Computing, [[University of Kent|University of Kent, Canterbury]]\n* [https://www.pbs.org/wonders/Episodes/Epi3/3_wondr1.htm Ashanti Kingdom] at the Wonders of the African World, at [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061205031422/http://library.webster.edu/ashanti.html Ashanti Culture] contains a selected list of Internet sources on the topic, especially sites that serve as comprehensive lists or gateways\n* [http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/4chapter6.shtml ''The Story of Africa: Asante''] \u2014 BBC World Service\n* [http://www.ascleiden.nl/Library/Webdossiers/Asante.aspx Web dossier about the Asante Kingdom]: [[Afrika-Studiecentrum, Leiden|African Studies Centre]], Leiden\n* [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/37710/Asante-empire Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Country Page - ''the Ashanti Kingdom'']\n\n{{Ashanti topics|expanded}}\n{{Akan states}}\n{{Akan topics}}\n{{Empires}}{{Authority control}}\n{{coord|5|27|N|0|58|W|display=title|region:GH_type:landmark_source:dewiki}}\n\n[[Category:Ashanti Empire|*]]\n[[Category:Ashanti Region|*]]\n[[Category:Autonomous regions]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1670]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1902]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1935]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1957]]\n[[Category:Countries in precolonial Africa]]\n[[Category:19th century in Africa]]\n[[Category:20th century in Africa]]\n[[Category:African civilizations]]\n[[Category:1670 establishments in Africa]]\n[[Category:1902 disestablishments in Africa]]\n[[Category:1935 establishments in Africa]]\n[[Category:1957 disestablishments in Africa]]\n", "name_user": "NotSparta9703", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_Empire"}

It is conducted by one of the seven zonal IITs (IIT Roorkee, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Delhi, IIT Kanpur, IIT Bombay, IIT Madras, and IIT Guwahati) under guidance of the Joint Admission Board (JAB). It is the sole prerequisite for admission in the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]] institutes. Other universities like the [[Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology]], [[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research]] (IISERs), and the [[Indian Institute of Science]] also uses the score obtained in JEE Advanced as the basis for admission. Any student who was admitted to IIT cannot appear for the JEE-Advanced, but the same is not the case with IISc, IISER, [[Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology|RGIPT]] and other institutes, because these institutes only use JEE-Advanced scores as a criterion for admission. The examination is organised each year by one of the IIT, on a [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] rotation pattern. It has a very low qualification rate (about 9,369 in 479,651 in 2012; ~1.95%)[https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/data/jee-report/JEE-2012%20Report.pdf] The qualification rate of the JEE-Advanced in 2017 was approximately 0.92% (about 11,000 out of 1,200,000 who applied for [[Joint Entrance Examination#JEE_Main|JEE Main]]).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bonus-marks-improved-success-rate-in-jee-advanced-say-experts-in-mumbai/story-uzx8aAmyyeXxIJ2uNSgL6J.html |date= June 14, 2017|publisher=The Hindu}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 the examination, originally called the IIT-JEE, was renamed as JEE (Advanced), and the [[Joint Entrance Examination (Main)|AIEEE]] was renamed [[Joint Entrance Examination (Main)|JEE (Main)]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120529/jsp/frontpage/story_15544962.jsp | title=Combined JEE from next year | date= 29 May 2012|publisher=The Calcutta Telegraph}}</ref> From 2017, IIT began conducting JEE internationally for the admission of foreign residents.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/iits-to-hold-entrance-exam-abroad-for-foreign-students/article8264215.ece|title=IITs to hold entrance exam abroad for foreign students |date= February 21, 2016|publisher=The Hindu}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe first institute of IIT, [[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur]], started in 1951. In its initial few years (1951-1954), students were admitted on the basis of their academic results followed by an Interview in several centers across the country. From 1955-1959, admissions for Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur were conducted via a national examination held only for IIT Kharagpur (no other institutes of the IIT had started by then). Academic disciplines were allotted to the students through interviews and counseling sessions held at Kharagpur.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nThe IIT-JEE, initially called the Common Entrance Exam (CEE), was first conducted in 1961, coinciding with the 1961 IIT Act.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://forbesindia.com/article/hindsight/iitjee-will-be-missed/32286/1 |title=IIT-JEE Will Be Missed |author=Ashish K. Mishra and Shishir Prasad |date=22 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978, the English paper was not considered while ranking participants' performance in the examination. In 1998, the English test was discontinued.\n\nIn 1997, the IIT-JEE was conducted twice after the question paper was leaked in some centers.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2005, an additional screening test was used alongside the main examination, intended to reduce pressure on the main examination by allowing only about 20,000 top candidates to appear for the examination, out of more than 450,000 applicants.\n\nFrom 2002, an additional exam called the [[AIEEE]] was introduced, and it was used for admissions to institutions other than the IIT. In 2012, the AIEEE was changed to [[Joint Entrance Examination (Main)|JEE (Main)]] and IIT-JEE was renamed JEE (Advanced); the JEE (Main) had become the screening exam for JEE (Advanced).\n\nFrom June 2005, [[The Hindu]] newspaper led a campaign for reforming the IIT-JEE to eradicate the \"coaching mania\" and to improve gender and socio-economic diversity.<ref>S.S. Vasan. [http://www.thehindu.com/2005/06/20/stories/2005062001561000.htm Reforming the Joint Entrance Examination system].</ref><ref>Editorial.

These were implemented from 2006 onward.<ref>Indrani Dutta. [http://www.thehindu.com/2005/09/18/stories/2005091803530900.htm New IIT-JEE format from 2006].</ref> The revised examination consisted of a single objective test, replacing the earlier two-test system. In the revised examination, to be eligible for the main examination, candidates in the general category had to score at least 60% aggregate marks in the 12th grade examinations organized by various educational boards of India, while candidates belonging to [[Scheduled Caste]] (SC), [[Scheduled Tribe]] (ST) and [[Persons With Disabilities]] (PwD) categories must secure a minimum of 55%.\n\nFrom 2006, the screening exam was abolished with the introduction a single stage multiple-choice exam started in 2006. In 2008, the director and the dean of [[IIT Madras]] proposed for further revisions to the examination, arguing that the coaching institutes were \"enabling many among the less-than-best students to crack the test and keeping girls from qualifying\". They expressed concern that the present system did not allow for applicants' 12 years of schooling to have a bearing on admissions into IIT.<ref>D Suresh Kumar.

2011, additional courses were introduced in the IIT. IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad were started in 2015 and four more institutes(IIT Bhilai, IIT Dharwad, IIT Goa, and IIT Jammu) started in 2016. In 2018, to ensure minimum female enrollment of 14%, the IIT introduced \"female only\" and \"gender neutral\" seats based on 2017 enrollment statistics, and \"super-numerary\" were created per-institute per-course to reach the 14% target. With this and slight overall seats increases, the total seats availability crossed 12000, including 801 \"super-numerary female-only\" seats. For 2019, with partial rollout of the 10% EWS quota (without reduction in non-reserved seats) and female enrolment target increasing to 17%, the total seats available went up to over 13500, with over 1200 \"super-numeracy female-only\" seats.\n\n==Criticism==\nIn 2012, [[Super 30]] founder and mathematician [[Anand Kumar]] criticised the New Admission Norms, saying that the decision of the IIT's council to give chance to students having top 20% from various boards in the class 12 examinations, was \"a decision in haste\". \"This is one decision that will go against the poor, who don't have the opportunity to study in elite schools,\" he added.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-27/patna/32440065_1_school-boards-new-format-iit-council | work=The Times Of India | title=New format of IIT-JEE examination would go against the poor: Anand Kumar | date=27 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nJEE is conducted only in [[English language|English]] and [[Hindi language|Hindi]], for which it was criticized as being harder for students where regional languages, like [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Kannada]], [[Urdu]], [[Oriya language|Oriya]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]] or [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], are more prominent.

It is conducted by one of the seven zonal IITs (IIT Roorkee, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Delhi, IIT Kanpur, IIT Bombay, IIT Madras, and IIT Guwahati) under guidance of the Joint Admission Board (JAB). It is the sole prerequisite for admission in the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]]. Other universities like the [[Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology]], [[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research]] (IISERs), and the [[Indian Institute of Science]] also uses the score obtained in JEE Advanced as the basis for admission. Any student who was admitted to IIT cannot appear for the JEE-Advanced, but the same is not the case with IISc, IISER, [[Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology|RGIPT]] and other institutes, because these institutes only use JEE-Advanced scores as a criterion for admission. The examination is organised each year by one of the IIT, on a [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] rotation pattern. It has a very low qualification rate (about 9,369 in 479,651 in 2012; ~1.95%)[https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/data/jee-report/JEE-2012%20Report.pdf] The qualification rate of the JEE-Advanced in 2017 was approximately 0.92% (about 11,000 out of 1,200,000 who applied for [[Joint Entrance Examination#JEE_Main|JEE Main]]).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bonus-marks-improved-success-rate-in-jee-advanced-say-experts-in-mumbai/story-uzx8aAmyyeXxIJ2uNSgL6J.html |date= June 14, 2017|publisher=The Hindu}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 the examination, originally called the IIT-JEE, was renamed as JEE (Advanced), and the [[Joint Entrance Examination (Main)|AIEEE]] was renamed [[Joint Entrance Examination (Main)|JEE (Main)]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120529/jsp/frontpage/story_15544962.jsp | title=Combined JEE from next year | date= 29 May 2012|publisher=The Calcutta Telegraph}}</ref> From 2017, IIT began conducting JEE internationally for the admission of foreign residents.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/iits-to-hold-entrance-exam-abroad-for-foreign-students/article8264215.ece|title=IITs to hold entrance exam abroad for foreign students |date= February 21, 2016|publisher=The Hindu}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe first institute of IIT, [[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur]], started in 1951. In its initial few years (1951-1954), students were admitted on the basis of their academic results followed by an Interview in several centers across the country. From 1955-1959, admissions for Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur were conducted via a national examination held only for IIT Kharagpur (other institutes of the IIT had not started by then). Academic disciplines were allotted to the students through interviews and counseling sessions held at Kharagpur.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nThe IIT-JEE, initially called the Common Entrance Exam (CEE), was first conducted in 1961, coinciding with the 1961 IIT Act.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://forbesindia.com/article/hindsight/iitjee-will-be-missed/32286/1 |title=IIT-JEE Will Be Missed |author=Ashish K.

In 1998, the English test was discontinued.\n\nIn 1997, the IIT-JEE was conducted twice after the question paper was leaked in some centers.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2005, an additional screening test was used alongside the main examination, intended to reduce pressure on the main examination by allowing only about 20,000 top candidates to appear for the examination, out of more than 450,000 applicants.\n\nFrom 2002, an additional exam called the [[AIEEE]] was introduced, and it was used for admissions to institutions other than the IIT. In 2012, the AIEEE was changed to [[Joint Entrance Examination (Main)|JEE (Main)]] and IIT-JEE was renamed JEE (Advanced); the JEE (Main) had become the screening exam for JEE (Advanced).\n\nFrom June 2005, [[The Hindu]] newspaper led a campaign for reforming the IIT-JEE to eradicate the \"coaching mania\" and to improve gender and socio-economic diversity.<ref>S.S.

These were implemented from 2006 onward.<ref>Indrani Dutta. [http://www.thehindu.com/2005/09/18/stories/2005091803530900.htm New IIT-JEE format from 2006].</ref> The revised examination consisted of a single objective test, replacing the earlier two-test system. In the revised examination, to be eligible for the main examination, candidates in the general category had to score at least 60% aggregate marks in the 12th grade examinations organized by various educational boards of India, while candidates belonging to [[Scheduled Caste]] (SC), [[Scheduled Tribe]] (ST) and [[Persons With Disabilities]] (PwD) categories must secure a minimum of 55%.\n\nFrom 2006, the screening exam was abolished with the introduction a single stage multiple-choice exam started in 2006. In 2008, the director and the dean of [[IIT Madras]] proposed for further revisions to the examination, arguing that the coaching institutes were \"enabling many among the less-than-best students to crack the test and keeping girls from qualifying\". They expressed concern that the present system did not allow for applicants' 12 years of schooling to have a bearing on admissions into IIT.<ref>D Suresh Kumar.

In 1805, his father settled in Holstein, but about the same time was left impoverished when the [[First French Empire|French]] burned his country house and plundered his townhouse in [[L\u00fcbeck]], where his wife and children were during the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]] of 1806-1807. Young Moltke, therefore, grew up under difficult circumstances. At nine he was sent as a boarder to Hohenfelde in Holstein, and at age twelve went to the [[Royal Danish Military Academy|cadet school]] at [[Copenhagen]], being destined for the Danish army and court. In 1818 he became a page to the king of [[Denmark]] and a second lieutenant in a Danish infantry regiment.\n\nAt twenty-one, Moltke resolved to enter the Prussian service, despite the loss of seniority. In 1822 he became a second lieutenant in the 8th Infantry Regiment stationed at [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt an der Oder]]. At twenty-three he was allowed to enter the general war school (later called the [[Prussian Military Academy]]), where he studied the full three years, graduating in 1826.\n\n==As a young officer==\nFor a year Moltke had charge of a cadet school at [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt an der Oder]], then he was for three years employed on the military survey in [[Province of Silesia|Silesia]] and [[Grand Duchy of Posen|Posen]]. In 1832 he was seconded for service on the general staff at Berlin, to which he was transferred in 1833 on promotion to first lieutenant. He was at this time regarded as a brilliant officer by his superiors, including Prince [[William I, German Emperor|William]], then a lieutenant-general.\n\nMoltke was well received at court and in the best society of Berlin. His tastes inclined him to literature, to historical study and to travel. In 1827 he had published a short romance, ''The Two Friends''. In 1831 he wrote an essay entitled ''Holland and Belgium in their Mutual Relations, from their Separation under Philip II to their Reunion under William I''. A year later he wrote ''An Account of the Internal Circumstances and Social Conditions of Poland'', a study based both on reading and on personal observation of Polish life and character.\n\nHe was fluent in English and a talented writer in German,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A genius for war: the German army and general staff 1807-1945|last=Dupuy|first=Trevor|publisher=Hero Books Ltd.|year=1984|isbn=|location=United Kingdom|pages=}}</ref> so in 1832 he contracted to translate Gibbon's ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' into German, for which he was to receive 75 marks, his object being to earn the money to buy a horse. In eighteen months he had finished nine volumes out of twelve, but the publisher failed to produce the book and Moltke never received more than 25 marks.\n\n==Service with the Ottoman Empire==\n\nhe didnt\n\n==Chief of the Prussian General Staff and Great General Staff==\n[[File:Siegessaeule Aussicht 10-13 img1 Moltke Statue.jpg|thumb|[[Statue of Helmuth von Moltke the Elder]], near the [[Berlin Victory Column]] in the [[Gro\u00dfer Tiergarten|Tiergarten]], Berlin, by [[Joseph Uphues]]]]\nIn 1857 Moltke was given the position Chief of the Prussian [[German General Staff|General Staff]], a position he held for the next 30 years (though after the establishment of the [[German Empire]], the Prussian General Staff's title was changed to \"Great General Staff\", as it would have overall direction of the various German armies during war<ref>Arden Bucholz, ''Moltke, Schlieffen, and Prussian War Planning''</ref>). As soon as he gained the position he went to work making changes to the strategic and tactical methods of the Prussian army; changes in armament and in means of communication; changes in the training of staff officers (such as instituting [[staff ride]]s);{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} and changes to the method for the mobilization of the army. He also instituted a formal study of European politics in connection with the plans for campaigns which might become necessary. In short, he rapidly put into place the features of a modern general staff.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nIn 1859 the [[Austro-Sardinian War]] in Italy caused the mobilization of the Prussian army, though it did not fight. After the mobilization, the army was reorganized and its strength was nearly doubled. The reorganization was the work not of Moltke but of the Prince Regent, [[William I, German Emperor|William]], and the Minister of War, [[Albrecht Graf von Roon|Albrecht von Roon]]. Moltke watched the Italian campaign closely and wrote a history of it (published in 1862). This history was attributed on the title-page to the historical division of the Prussian staff (yet another first in military affairs).\n\nIn December 1862 Moltke was asked for an opinion upon the military aspect of the quarrel with Denmark. He thought the difficulty would be to bring the war to an end, as the Danish army would, if possible, retire to the islands, where, as the Danes had the command of the sea, it could not be attacked. He sketched a plan for turning the flank of the Danish army before the attack upon its position in front of [[Schleswig]]. He suggested that by this means its retreat might be cut off.\n\n==War with Denmark==\n[[File:Helmuth von Moltke drawing.jpg|left|thumb|Sketch of Helmuth von Moltke]] \nWhen the [[Second Schleswig War]] began in February 1864, Moltke was not sent with the Prussian forces, but kept at Berlin. His war plan was mismanaged and the Danish army escaped to the fortresses of [[Dybb\u00f8l]] and [[Fredericia]], each of which commanded a retreat across a strait to an island. Dybb\u00f8l and Fredericia were besieged, [[Battle of Dybb\u00f8l|Dybb\u00f8l taken by storm]], and Fredericia abandoned by the Danes without assault&nbsp;\u2013 but the war showed no signs of ending. The Danish army was safe on the islands of [[Als Island|Als]] and [[Funen]].\n\nOn April 30, 1864, Moltke was sent to be chief of the staff for the allied (German) forces. After a two-month armistice, the German army attacked the Danes in the island of Als (June 29). The Danes evacuated Als and shortly thereafter agreed to the German peace terms. Moltke's appearance on the scene had transformed the war,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and his influence with the king had acquired a firm basis. Accordingly, when in 1866 the quarrel with Austria came to a head, Moltke's plans were adopted and executed.\n\n==Moltke's theory of war==\n[[File:Parchim Moltke Denkmal.jpg|thumb|right|Statue in [[Parchim]], Moltke's birthplace]]\n[[File:Moltke TF 1869 1.jpg|thumb|right|First page of von Moltke's ''[[Truppenf\u00fchrung#Background|Instructions for Large Unit Commanders]]'', 1869]]\nIn contrast to [[Antoine-Henri Jomini]], who expounded a system of rules, Moltke was a disciple of [[Carl von Clausewitz]] and regarded strategy as a practical art of adapting means to ends. He had developed the methods of [[Napoleon]] in accordance with altered conditions of his age, was the first to realize the great defensive power of modern firearms,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} and realized that an enveloping attack had become more formidable than an attempt to pierce an enemy's front.\n\nOne of Moltke\u2019s trademark strategies, seen in all his plans for war with Russia and France, was what has been called the offensive-defensive strategy, manoeuvring his army to cut the lines of communication of the enemy force and then dig in and defeat the enemy force trying to reestablish its lines of communication in a defensive action.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMoltke had pondered the tactics of Napoleon at the [[Battle of Bautzen]], when the emperor brought up [[Michel Ney|Ney]]'s corps, coming from a great distance, against the flank of the allies, rather than to unite it with his own force before the battle; he had also drawn this conclusion from the combined action of the allies at the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. Additionally, Moltke realized that the increase in firepower reduced the risk a defender ran in splitting his forces, while the increase in the size of armies made outflanking maneuvers more practical.\n\nAt the same time Moltke had worked out the conditions of the march and supply of an army. Only one army corps could be moved along one road in the same day; to put two or three corps on the same road meant that the rear corps could not be made use of in a battle at the front. Several corps stationed close together in a small area could not be fed for more than a day or two. Accordingly, he believed that the essence of strategy in his day lay in arrangements for the separation of the corps for marching and their concentration in time for battle. In order to make a large army manageable, it must be broken up into separate armies or groups of corps, each group under a commander authorized to regulate its movements and action subject to the instructions of the commander-in-chief as regards the direction and purpose of its operations.\n\nMoltke also realized that the expansion in the size of armies since the 1820s made it essentially impossible to exercise detailed control over the entire force as Napoleon or Wellington had done in battle.  Subordinates would have to use initiative and independent judgment for the forces to be effective in battle.  Therefore, overall campaign and battle plans should encourage and take advantage of the decentralization that would be necessary in any case. In this new concept, commanders of distant detachments were required to exercise initiative in their decision making and von Moltke emphasized the benefits of developing officers who could do this within the limits of the senior commander's intent.\n\nHe accomplished this by means of [[Mission-type tactics|directives stating his intentions]], rather than detailed orders, and he was willing to accept deviations from a directive provided that it was within the general framework of the mission. Von Moltke held this view firmly and it later became a fundamental of all German military theory, especially for the [[field manual]] ''[[Truppenf\u00fchrung]]''.\n\nMoltke's main thesis was that [[military strategy]] had to be understood as a system of options since it was only possible to plan the beginning of a military operation. As a result, he considered the main task of military leaders to consist in the extensive preparation of all possible outcomes.<ref name=\":0\" /> His thesis can be summed up by two statements, one famous and one less so, translated into English as \"No plan of operations extends with certainty beyond the first encounter with the enemy's main strength\" (or \"no plan survives contact with the enemy\")<ref name=moltke>Originally in Moltke, Helmuth, Graf von, ''Militarische Werke''. vol. 2, part 2., pp. 33\u201340.

First Moltke demonstrated a concentration of effort. There were two enemy groups opposing the Prussians, the Austro-Saxon armies, 270,000; and their allied North and South German armies, some 120,000 strong. The Prussian forces were smaller by some 60,000, but Moltke was determined to be superior at the decisive point. The army placed against Austria was 278,000 men, leaving just 48,000 men remaining to defend against Austria's German allies. Those 48,000 under [[Eduard Vogel von Falckenstein|Falckenstein]] managed to capture the [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanoverian]] army in less than two weeks, and then to attack and drive away the South German forces.\n\nIn dealing with the Austrian and Saxon army, the difficulty was to have the Prussian army ready first. This was not easy, as the king would not mobilize until after the Austrians. Moltke's railway knowledge helped him to save time. Five railway lines led from the various Prussian provinces to a series of points on the southern frontier. By employing all these railways at once, Moltke had all his army corps moved simultaneously from their peace quarters to the frontier.\n\nAfter marching into Saxony, the Saxon army retreated into [[Bohemia]]. Moltke had two Prussian armies about 100 miles apart. The problem was how to bring them together so as to catch the Austrian army between them like the French at Waterloo between [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] and [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|Bl\u00fccher]]. He determined to bring his own two armies together by directing each of them to advance towards [[Ji\u010d\u00edn|Gitschin]]. He foresaw that the march of the Crown Prince would probably bring him into collision with a portion of the Austrian army; but the Crown Prince had 100,000 men, and it was not likely that the Austrians could have a stronger force.\n[[File:Schlacht-bei-koeniggraetz-von-georg-bleibtreu.jpg|thumb|King [[William I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] on a black horse with his suite, Bismarck, Moltke, Roon, and others, watching the [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]]]]\n\nThe Austrians, under [[Ludwig von Benedek]], marched faster than Moltke expected, and might have opposed Prince Frederick Charles (the Red Prince) with four or five corps; but Benedek's attention was centered on Crown Prince [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick]], and his four corps, not under a common command, were beaten in detail. On July 1, Benedek collected his shaken forces into a defensive position in front of [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz|K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]]. Moltke's two armies were now within a short march of one another and of the enemy. On July 3, they were brought into action, the first army against the Austrian forces and the second against the Austrian right flank. The Austrian army was completely defeated and the campaign and war were won.\n\nMoltke was not quite satisfied with the Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz. He tried to have the Prussian Army of the Elbe brought up above K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz, so as to prevent the Austrian retreat, but its commanding officer failed to get there in time. He also tried to prevent the Prussian First Army from pushing its attack too hard, hoping in that way to keep the Austrians in their position until their retreat should be cut off by the Crown Prince's army, but this also did not happen.\n\nDuring the negotiations, [[Otto von Bismarck]] opposed the king's wish to annex the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] and other territory beyond what was actually taken; he feared the active intervention of France. Moltke, however, was confident of beating both French and Austrians if the French should intervene, and he submitted to Bismarck his plans in case a war against both France and Austria proved necessary.\n\nAfter the peace, the Prussian government voted Moltke the sum of 30,000 marks (equivalent to approximately 225,000 US$ in 2016), with which he bought the estate of [[Krzy\u017cowa, \u015awidnica County|Creisau (present-day Krzy\u017cowa)]], near [[\u015awidnica|Schweidnitz (present-day \u015awidnica)]] in the [[Province of Silesia]].\n\nIn 1867 ''The Campaign of 1866 in Germany'' was published. This history was produced under Moltke's personal supervision and was regarded as quite accurate at the time. On December 24, 1868, Moltke's wife died at Berlin. Her remains were buried in a small chapel erected by Moltke as a mausoleum in the park at [[Krzy\u017cowa, \u015awidnica County|Creisau]].\n\n==Franco-Prussian War==\n{{further|Franco-Prussian War}}\n[[File:Rudolf Siemering Entwurf Moltke Leipzig.jpg|thumb|left|Statue ([[Leipzig]] 1888\u20131946). The statue was torn down after the [[East Germany|communists]] took power.]]\n\nMoltke again planned and led the Prussian armies in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870\u201371), which paved the way for the creation of the Prussian-led [[German Empire]] in 1871. The aspects of such a war had occupied Moltke's attention almost continuously since 1857; documents published after his death show the many times he considered such a war and the best arrangement of the Prussian or German forces for such a campaign. The arrangements for the transport of the army by railway were revised annually in order to suit the changes in his plans brought about by political conditions and by the growth of the army, as well as by the improvement of the Prussian system of railways.\n\nThe successes of 1866 had strengthened Moltke's position, so that when on July 5, 1870, the order for the mobilization of the Prussian and South German forces was issued, his plans were adopted without dispute. Five days later he was appointed Chief of Staff of the Army for the duration of the war. This gave Moltke the right to issue orders which were equivalent to royal commands.\n\nMoltke's plan was to assemble the whole army south of [[Mainz]], this being one district in which a single army could secure the defence of the whole frontier. If the French disregarded the neutrality of Belgium and [[Luxembourg]], and advanced towards [[Cologne]] (or any other point on the [[Lower Rhine]]), the German army would be able to strike at their flank. At the same time the Rhine itself, with the fortresses of [[Koblenz]], Cologne and [[Wesel]], would be a serious obstacle in their path. If the French should attempt to invade south Germany, an advance by the Germans up the Rhine river would threaten their communications. Moltke expected that the French would be compelled by the direction of their railways to collect the greater part of their army near [[Metz]], and a smaller portion near [[Strasbourg]].\n\nThe German forces were grouped into three armies: the first of 60,000 men under Steinmetz, on the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] below [[Trier]]; the second of 130,000 men, under [[Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia (1828\u20131885)|Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia]], around [[Homburg, Saarland|Homburg]] (with a reserve of 60,000 men behind them); the third under the Crown Prince [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick]] of 130,000 men, at [[Landau]]. Three army corps were held back in north-Eastern Germany, in case [[Austria-Hungary]] should make common cause with France.\n\nMoltke's plan was that the three armies, while advancing, should make a right wheel, so that the first army on the right would reach the bank of the Moselle opposite Metz, while the second and third armies should push forward, the third army to defeat the French force near Strasbourg, and the second to strike the Moselle near [[Pont-\u00e0-Mousson]]. If the French army should be found  in front of the second army, it would be attacked in front by the second army and in flank by the first or the third (or both). If it should be found on or north of the line from [[Sarrebourg|Saarburg]] to [[Lun\u00e9ville]], it could still be attacked from two sides by the second and third armies in co-operation. The intention of the great right wheel was to attack the principal French army in such a direction as to drive it north and cut its communications with Paris. The fortress of Metz was to be only monitored, and the main German forces, after defeating the chief French army, would then march against Paris.\n\nThis plan was carried out in its broad outlines. The [[Battle of W\u00f6rth]] was brought on prematurely, and therefore led, not to the capture of [[Patrice MacMahon, duc de Magenta|MacMahon]]'s army, which was intended, but only to its defeat and hasty retreat as far as Ch\u00e2lons. The [[Battle of Spicheren]] was not intended by Moltke, who wished to keep [[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine|Bazaine]]'s army on the [[Saar (river)|Saar]] until he could attack it with the second army in front and the first army on its left flank. But these unexpected victories did not disconcert Moltke, who carried out his intended advance to Pont-Mousson, crossed the Moselle with the first and second armies, then faced north and wheeled round, so that the effect of the battle of Gravelotte was to drive Bazaine into the fortress of Metz and cut him off from Paris.\n\nNothing shows Moltke's insight and strength of purpose in a clearer light than his determination to attack on 18 August, at the [[Battle of Gravelotte]], when other strategists would have thought that, the strategic victory having been gained, a tactical victory was unnecessary. He has been blamed for the last attack of Gravelotte, in which there was a fruitless heavy loss; but it is now known that this attack was ordered by the king, and Moltke blamed himself for not having used his influence to prevent it.\n\nDuring the night following the battle Moltke left one army to invest [[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine|Bazaine]] at Metz, and set out with the two others to march towards Paris, the more southerly one leading, so that when MacMahon's army should be found the main blow might be delivered from the south and MacMahon driven to the north. On August 25 it was found that MacMahon was moving north-east for the relief of Bazaine. The moment Moltke was satisfied of the accuracy of his information, he ordered the German columns to turn their faces north instead of west. MacMahon's right wing was attacked at [[Beaumont, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Beaumont]] <!-- ?? --> while attempting to cross the [[Meuse River|Meuse]], his advance necessarily abandoned, and his army with difficulty collected at Sedan.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Battle of Sedan]], the two German armies surrounded the French army, which on September 1 was attacked from multiple sides and compelled to surrender. Moltke then resumed the advance on Paris, which was also surrounded.\n\nFrom this time Moltke's strategy is remarkable for its judicious economy of force, for he was wise enough never to attempt more than was practicable with the means at his disposal. The surrender of Metz and of Paris was just a question of time, and the problem was, while maintaining the sieges, to be able to ward off the attacks of the new French armies levied for the purpose of raising the [[Siege of Paris (1870\u201371)|Siege of Paris]]. The [[Siege of Metz (1870)|Siege of Metz]] ended with its surrender on October 27.\n\nOn January 28, 1871, [[Armistice of Versailles|an armistice was concluded at Versailles]] by which the garrison became virtually prisoners and the war was ended.\n\n==Final years==\n[[File:Krzyzowa4.JPG|thumb|The Moltke palace at Kreisau, now [[Krzy\u017cowa, \u015awidnica County|Krzy\u017cowa]], in 2005]]\n[[File:Prussian Field Marshal Moltke the Elder Br. Medal.jpg|left|thumb|Medallion of Helmuth Graf von Moltke the Elder wearing the 1870 Grand Cross of the [[Iron Cross]]. Bronze Medal by August Schabel, [[Munich]].]]\n\nIn October 1870, Moltke was made a [[Graf]] (Count) as a reward for his services during the Franco-Prussian War and victory at the Battle of Sedan. In June 1871, he was further rewarded by a promotion to the rank of [[field marshal]] and a large monetary grant. He served in the [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] of the [[North German Confederation]] from 1867\u201371, and from 1871\u201391 he was a member of the ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'' (federal parliament). For \"meritorious achievements for the unified, reborn German fatherland\" (''Verdienste um das zur Einheit wiedergeborene Deutsche Vaterland'') he was named an [[List of honorary citizens of Hamburg|honorary citizen of Hamburg]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fhh.hamburg.de/stadt/Aktuell/senat/service/ehrenbuerger/start.html |title=Stadt Hamburg Ehrenb\u00fcrger |language= German |publisher=Fhh.hamburg.de |accessdate= June 17, 2008}}</ref>\n\nMoltke superintended the preparation of the official history of the Franco-Prussian War, which was published between 1874 and 1881 by the German General Staff. After the war, he became a national hero and celebrity. More than 50 monuments to Moltke were erected throughout Germany in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; some were destroyed during or after World War II but many remain.\n\nWhen Moltke retired in 1888 as Chief of the General Staff, he was succeeded by [[Alfred Graf von Waldersee|Alfred von Waldersee]]. (His nephew, [[Helmuth Johann Ludwig von Moltke]], was chief from 1906 to 1914.) Moltke officially retired from active service on August 9, 1888. His 90th birthday on October 26, 1890 was declared a national holiday.

The chief of staff of the [[Prussian Army]] for thirty years, he is regarded as the creator of a new, more modern method of directing armies in the field. He commanded troops in Europe and the Middle East, commanding during the Second Schleswig War, Austro-Prussian War and the Franco-Prussian War. He is described as embodying \"Prussian military organization and tactical genius.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=|title=Optimism has made wars likelier and bloodier|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21730133-lawrence-freedman-traces-long-history-predictionsrarely-correctthat-fighting-would-be|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 October 2017}}</ref> He was fascinated with railways and pioneered their military usage.<ref name=\":0\" /> He is often referred to as '''Moltke the Elder''' to distinguish him from his nephew [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger|Helmuth Johann Ludwig von Moltke]], who commanded the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] at the outbreak of World War I.\n\n==Early life==\nMoltke was born in [[Parchim]], [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], son of the German [[Generalleutnant]] in Danish service Friedrich Philipp Victor von [[Moltke]] (1768\u20131845). In 1805, his father settled in Holstein, but about the same time was left impoverished when the [[First French Empire|French]] burned his country house and plundered his townhouse in [[L\u00fcbeck]], where his wife and children were during the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]] of 1806-1807. Young Moltke, therefore, grew up under difficult circumstances. At nine he was sent as a boarder to Hohenfelde in Holstein, and at age twelve went to the [[Royal Danish Military Academy|cadet school]] at [[Copenhagen]], being destined for the Danish army and court. In 1818 he became a page to the king of [[Denmark]] and a second lieutenant in a Danish infantry regiment.\n\nAt twenty-one, Moltke resolved to enter the Prussian service, despite the loss of seniority. In 1822 he became a second lieutenant in the 8th Infantry Regiment stationed at [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt an der Oder]]. At twenty-three he was allowed to enter the general war school (later called the [[Prussian Military Academy]]), where he studied the full three years, graduating in 1826.\n\n==As a young officer==\nFor a year Moltke had charge of a cadet school at [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt an der Oder]], then he was for three years employed on the military survey in [[Province of Silesia|Silesia]] and [[Grand Duchy of Posen|Posen]]. In 1832 he was seconded for service on the general staff at Berlin, to which he was transferred in 1833 on promotion to first lieutenant. He was at this time regarded as a brilliant officer by his superiors, including Prince [[William I, German Emperor|William]], then a lieutenant-general.\n\nMoltke was well received at court and in the best society of Berlin. His tastes inclined him to literature, to historical study and to travel. In 1827 he had published a short romance, ''The Two Friends''. In 1831 he wrote an essay entitled ''Holland and Belgium in their Mutual Relations, from their Separation under Philip II to their Reunion under William I''. A year later he wrote ''An Account of the Internal Circumstances and Social Conditions of Poland'', a study based both on reading and on personal observation of Polish life and character.\n\nHe was fluent in English and a talented writer in German,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A genius for war: the German army and general staff 1807-1945|last=Dupuy|first=Trevor|publisher=Hero Books Ltd.|year=1984|isbn=|location=United Kingdom|pages=}}</ref> so in 1832 he contracted to translate Gibbon's ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' into German, for which he was to receive 75 marks, his object being to earn the money to buy a horse. In eighteen months he had finished nine volumes out of twelve, but the publisher failed to produce the book and Moltke never received more than 25 marks.\n\n==Service with the Ottoman Empire==\n\nIn 1835 on his promotion as captain, Moltke obtained six months leave to travel in south-eastern Europe. After a short stay in [[Constantinople]] he was requested by the Sultan [[Mahmud II]] to help modernize the [[Ottoman Empire]] army, and being duly authorized from Berlin he accepted the offer. He remained two years at Constantinople, learned [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and surveyed the city of Constantinople, the [[Bosphorus]], and the [[Dardanelles]]. He travelled through [[Principality of Wallachia|Wallachia]], [[Ottoman Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], and [[Rumelia]], and made many other journeys on both sides of the Strait.\n[[File:Hafiz and von Moltke at Nezib.jpg|thumb|left|Moltke (left) advising Ottoman commander Hafiz Pasha at Nezib]]\nIn 1838 Moltke was sent as an adviser to the Ottoman general commanding the troops in [[Anatolia]], who was to carry on [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1839\u20131841)|a campaign against Muhammad Ali of Egypt]]. During the summer Moltke made extensive reconnaissances and surveys, riding several thousand miles in the course of his journey. He navigated the rapids of the [[Euphrates]] and visited and mapped many parts of the Ottoman Empire. In 1839 the army moved south to fight the Egyptians, but upon the approach of the enemy, the general refused to listen to Moltke's advice. Moltke resigned his post of staff officer and took charge of the artillery. In the [[Battle of Nezib]] (modern-day [[Nisibis]]) on 24 June 1839, the Ottoman army was beaten. With great difficulty, Moltke made his way back to the Black Sea, and thence to Constantinople. His patron, Sultan Mahmud II, was dead, so he returned to Berlin where he arrived, broken in health, in December 1839.\n\nOnce home Moltke published some of the letters he had written as ''Letters on Conditions and Events in Turkey in the Years 1835 to 1839''. This book was well received at the time. Early the next year he married a young English woman, Maria Bertha Helena Burt, the daughter of John Heyliger Burt esq. of [[St. Croix, Virgin Islands|St. Croix]] in the [[Danish West Indies]], who married his sister Augusta. It was a happy union, though there were no children.\n\nIn 1840 Moltke had been appointed to the staff of the 4th Army Corps, stationed at Berlin and he published his maps of Constantinople, and, jointly with other German travellers, a new map of Asia Minor and a memoir on the geography of that region.\n\nHe became fascinated by railroads and he was one of the first directors of the Hamburg-Berlin railway. In 1843 he published an article ''What Considerations should determine the Choice of the Course of Railways?''. Even before Germany began constructing its first railroad he had noticed their military potential and he urged the general staff to support railway construction for mobilisation and logistical reasons.<ref name=\":0\" /> He spent all of his savings on investments into Prussian railroad ventures which made him a considerable amount of wealth.<ref name=\":0\" /> During his later of the great general staff he would add a Railways Department, which didn\u2019t have the task of planning military campaign like many of the other departments, but managed the military use of railways.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1845 Moltke published ''The Russo-Turkish Campaign in Europe, 1828\u20131829''; this book was also well received in military circles. Also in that year, he served in Rome as personal adjutant to Prince Henry of Prussia, which allowed him to create another map of the ''Eternal City'' (published in 1852). In 1848, after a brief return to the General Staff in Berlin, he became Chief of the Staff of the 4th Army Corps, of which the headquarters were then at [[Magdeburg]], where he remained seven years, during which he rose to Lieutenant Colonel and Colonel.\n\nIn 1855 Moltke served as personal aide to Prince Frederick (later Emperor [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]]). He accompanied the prince to England (for his marriage), as well as to Paris and to [[Saint Petersburg]] for the coronation of [[Alexander II of Russia]].\n\n==Chief of the Prussian General Staff and Great General Staff==\n[[File:Siegessaeule Aussicht 10-13 img1 Moltke Statue.jpg|thumb|[[Statue of Helmuth von Moltke the Elder]], near the [[Berlin Victory Column]] in the [[Gro\u00dfer Tiergarten|Tiergarten]], Berlin, by [[Joseph Uphues]]]]\nIn 1857 Moltke was given the position Chief of the Prussian [[German General Staff|General Staff]], a position he held for the next 30 years (though after the establishment of the [[German Empire]], the Prussian General Staff's title was changed to \"Great General Staff\", as it would have overall direction of the various German armies during war<ref>Arden Bucholz, ''Moltke, Schlieffen, and Prussian War Planning''</ref>). As soon as he gained the position he went to work making changes to the strategic and tactical methods of the Prussian army; changes in armament and in means of communication; changes in the training of staff officers (such as instituting [[staff ride]]s);{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} and changes to the method for the mobilization of the army. He also instituted a formal study of European politics in connection with the plans for campaigns which might become necessary. In short, he rapidly put into place the features of a modern general staff.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nIn 1859 the [[Austro-Sardinian War]] in Italy caused the mobilization of the Prussian army, though it did not fight. After the mobilization, the army was reorganized and its strength was nearly doubled. The reorganization was the work not of Moltke but of the Prince Regent, [[William I, German Emperor|William]], and the Minister of War, [[Albrecht Graf von Roon|Albrecht von Roon]]. Moltke watched the Italian campaign closely and wrote a history of it (published in 1862). This history was attributed on the title-page to the historical division of the Prussian staff (yet another first in military affairs).\n\nIn December 1862 Moltke was asked for an opinion upon the military aspect of the quarrel with Denmark. He thought the difficulty would be to bring the war to an end, as the Danish army would, if possible, retire to the islands, where, as the Danes had the command of the sea, it could not be attacked. He sketched a plan for turning the flank of the Danish army before the attack upon its position in front of [[Schleswig]]. He suggested that by this means its retreat might be cut off.\n\n==War with Denmark==\n[[File:Helmuth von Moltke drawing.jpg|left|thumb|Sketch of Helmuth von Moltke]] \nWhen the [[Second Schleswig War]] began in February 1864, Moltke was not sent with the Prussian forces, but kept at Berlin. His war plan was mismanaged and the Danish army escaped to the fortresses of [[Dybb\u00f8l]] and [[Fredericia]], each of which commanded a retreat across a strait to an island. Dybb\u00f8l and Fredericia were besieged, [[Battle of Dybb\u00f8l|Dybb\u00f8l taken by storm]], and Fredericia abandoned by the Danes without assault&nbsp;\u2013 but the war showed no signs of ending. The Danish army was safe on the islands of [[Als Island|Als]] and [[Funen]].\n\nOn April 30, 1864, Moltke was sent to be chief of the staff for the allied (German) forces. After a two-month armistice, the German army attacked the Danes in the island of Als (June 29). The Danes evacuated Als and shortly thereafter agreed to the German peace terms. Moltke's appearance on the scene had transformed the war,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and his influence with the king had acquired a firm basis. Accordingly, when in 1866 the quarrel with Austria came to a head, Moltke's plans were adopted and executed.\n\n==Moltke's theory of war==\n[[File:Parchim Moltke Denkmal.jpg|thumb|right|Statue in [[Parchim]], Moltke's birthplace]]\n[[File:Moltke TF 1869 1.jpg|thumb|right|First page of von Moltke's ''[[Truppenf\u00fchrung#Background|Instructions for Large Unit Commanders]]'', 1869]]\nIn contrast to [[Antoine-Henri Jomini]], who expounded a system of rules, Moltke was a disciple of [[Carl von Clausewitz]] and regarded strategy as a practical art of adapting means to ends. He had developed the methods of [[Napoleon]] in accordance with altered conditions of his age, was the first to realize the great defensive power of modern firearms,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} and realized that an enveloping attack had become more formidable than an attempt to pierce an enemy's front.\n\nOne of Moltke\u2019s trademark strategies, seen in all his plans for war with Russia and France, was what has been called the offensive-defensive strategy, manoeuvring his army to cut the lines of communication of the enemy force and then dig in and defeat the enemy force trying to reestablish its lines of communication in a defensive action.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMoltke had pondered the tactics of Napoleon at the [[Battle of Bautzen]], when the emperor brought up [[Michel Ney|Ney]]'s corps, coming from a great distance, against the flank of the allies, rather than to unite it with his own force before the battle; he had also drawn this conclusion from the combined action of the allies at the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. Additionally, Moltke realized that the increase in firepower reduced the risk a defender ran in splitting his forces, while the increase in the size of armies made outflanking maneuvers more practical.\n\nAt the same time Moltke had worked out the conditions of the march and supply of an army. Only one army corps could be moved along one road in the same day; to put two or three corps on the same road meant that the rear corps could not be made use of in a battle at the front. Several corps stationed close together in a small area could not be fed for more than a day or two. Accordingly, he believed that the essence of strategy in his day lay in arrangements for the separation of the corps for marching and their concentration in time for battle. In order to make a large army manageable, it must be broken up into separate armies or groups of corps, each group under a commander authorized to regulate its movements and action subject to the instructions of the commander-in-chief as regards the direction and purpose of its operations.\n\nMoltke also realized that the expansion in the size of armies since the 1820s made it essentially impossible to exercise detailed control over the entire force as Napoleon or Wellington had done in battle.  Subordinates would have to use initiative and independent judgment for the forces to be effective in battle.  Therefore, overall campaign and battle plans should encourage and take advantage of the decentralization that would be necessary in any case. In this new concept, commanders of distant detachments were required to exercise initiative in their decision making and von Moltke emphasized the benefits of developing officers who could do this within the limits of the senior commander's intent.\n\nHe accomplished this by means of [[Mission-type tactics|directives stating his intentions]], rather than detailed orders, and he was willing to accept deviations from a directive provided that it was within the general framework of the mission. Von Moltke held this view firmly and it later became a fundamental of all German military theory, especially for the [[field manual]] ''[[Truppenf\u00fchrung]]''.\n\nMoltke's main thesis was that [[military strategy]] had to be understood as a system of options since it was only possible to plan the beginning of a military operation. As a result, he considered the main task of military leaders to consist in the extensive preparation of all possible outcomes.<ref name=\":0\" /> His thesis can be summed up by two statements, one famous and one less so, translated into English as \"No plan of operations extends with certainty beyond the first encounter with the enemy's main strength\" (or \"no plan survives contact with the enemy\")<ref name=moltke>Originally in Moltke, Helmuth, Graf von, ''Militarische Werke''. vol. 2, part 2., pp. 33\u201340.

First Moltke demonstrated a concentration of effort. There were two enemy groups opposing the Prussians, the Austro-Saxon armies, 270,000; and their allied North and South German armies, some 120,000 strong. The Prussian forces were smaller by some 60,000, but Moltke was determined to be superior at the decisive point. The army placed against Austria was 278,000 men, leaving just 48,000 men remaining to defend against Austria's German allies. Those 48,000 under [[Eduard Vogel von Falckenstein|Falckenstein]] managed to capture the [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanoverian]] army in less than two weeks, and then to attack and drive away the South German forces.\n\nIn dealing with the Austrian and Saxon army, the difficulty was to have the Prussian army ready first. This was not easy, as the king would not mobilize until after the Austrians. Moltke's railway knowledge helped him to save time. Five railway lines led from the various Prussian provinces to a series of points on the southern frontier. By employing all these railways at once, Moltke had all his army corps moved simultaneously from their peace quarters to the frontier.\n\nAfter marching into Saxony, the Saxon army retreated into [[Bohemia]]. Moltke had two Prussian armies about 100 miles apart. The problem was how to bring them together so as to catch the Austrian army between them like the French at Waterloo between [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] and [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|Bl\u00fccher]]. He determined to bring his own two armies together by directing each of them to advance towards [[Ji\u010d\u00edn|Gitschin]]. He foresaw that the march of the Crown Prince would probably bring him into collision with a portion of the Austrian army; but the Crown Prince had 100,000 men, and it was not likely that the Austrians could have a stronger force.\n[[File:Schlacht-bei-koeniggraetz-von-georg-bleibtreu.jpg|thumb|King [[William I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] on a black horse with his suite, Bismarck, Moltke, Roon, and others, watching the [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]]]]\n\nThe Austrians, under [[Ludwig von Benedek]], marched faster than Moltke expected, and might have opposed Prince Frederick Charles (the Red Prince) with four or five corps; but Benedek's attention was centered on Crown Prince [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick]], and his four corps, not under a common command, were beaten in detail. On July 1, Benedek collected his shaken forces into a defensive position in front of [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz|K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]]. Moltke's two armies were now within a short march of one another and of the enemy. On July 3, they were brought into action, the first army against the Austrian forces and the second against the Austrian right flank. The Austrian army was completely defeated and the campaign and war were won.\n\nMoltke was not quite satisfied with the Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz. He tried to have the Prussian Army of the Elbe brought up above K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz, so as to prevent the Austrian retreat, but its commanding officer failed to get there in time. He also tried to prevent the Prussian First Army from pushing its attack too hard, hoping in that way to keep the Austrians in their position until their retreat should be cut off by the Crown Prince's army, but this also did not happen.\n\nDuring the negotiations, [[Otto von Bismarck]] opposed the king's wish to annex the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] and other territory beyond what was actually taken; he feared the active intervention of France. Moltke, however, was confident of beating both French and Austrians if the French should intervene, and he submitted to Bismarck his plans in case a war against both France and Austria proved necessary.\n\nAfter the peace, the Prussian government voted Moltke the sum of 30,000 marks (equivalent to approximately 225,000 US$ in 2016), with which he bought the estate of [[Krzy\u017cowa, \u015awidnica County|Creisau (present-day Krzy\u017cowa)]], near [[\u015awidnica|Schweidnitz (present-day \u015awidnica)]] in the [[Province of Silesia]].\n\nIn 1867 ''The Campaign of 1866 in Germany'' was published. This history was produced under Moltke's personal supervision and was regarded as quite accurate at the time. On December 24, 1868, Moltke's wife died at Berlin. Her remains were buried in a small chapel erected by Moltke as a mausoleum in the park at [[Krzy\u017cowa, \u015awidnica County|Creisau]].\n\n==Franco-Prussian War==\n{{further|Franco-Prussian War}}\n[[File:Rudolf Siemering Entwurf Moltke Leipzig.jpg|thumb|left|Statue ([[Leipzig]] 1888\u20131946). The statue was torn down after the [[East Germany|communists]] took power.]]\n\nMoltke again planned and led the Prussian armies in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870\u201371), which paved the way for the creation of the Prussian-led [[German Empire]] in 1871. The aspects of such a war had occupied Moltke's attention almost continuously since 1857; documents published after his death show the many times he considered such a war and the best arrangement of the Prussian or German forces for such a campaign. The arrangements for the transport of the army by railway were revised annually in order to suit the changes in his plans brought about by political conditions and by the growth of the army, as well as by the improvement of the Prussian system of railways.\n\nThe successes of 1866 had strengthened Moltke's position, so that when on July 5, 1870, the order for the mobilization of the Prussian and South German forces was issued, his plans were adopted without dispute. Five days later he was appointed Chief of Staff of the Army for the duration of the war. This gave Moltke the right to issue orders which were equivalent to royal commands.\n\nMoltke's plan was to assemble the whole army south of [[Mainz]], this being one district in which a single army could secure the defence of the whole frontier. If the French disregarded the neutrality of Belgium and [[Luxembourg]], and advanced towards [[Cologne]] (or any other point on the [[Lower Rhine]]), the German army would be able to strike at their flank. At the same time the Rhine itself, with the fortresses of [[Koblenz]], Cologne and [[Wesel]], would be a serious obstacle in their path. If the French should attempt to invade south Germany, an advance by the Germans up the Rhine river would threaten their communications. Moltke expected that the French would be compelled by the direction of their railways to collect the greater part of their army near [[Metz]], and a smaller portion near [[Strasbourg]].\n\nThe German forces were grouped into three armies: the first of 60,000 men under Steinmetz, on the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] below [[Trier]]; the second of 130,000 men, under [[Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia (1828\u20131885)|Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia]], around [[Homburg, Saarland|Homburg]] (with a reserve of 60,000 men behind them); the third under the Crown Prince [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick]] of 130,000 men, at [[Landau]]. Three army corps were held back in north-Eastern Germany, in case [[Austria-Hungary]] should make common cause with France.\n\nMoltke's plan was that the three armies, while advancing, should make a right wheel, so that the first army on the right would reach the bank of the Moselle opposite Metz, while the second and third armies should push forward, the third army to defeat the French force near Strasbourg, and the second to strike the Moselle near [[Pont-\u00e0-Mousson]]. If the French army should be found  in front of the second army, it would be attacked in front by the second army and in flank by the first or the third (or both). If it should be found on or north of the line from [[Sarrebourg|Saarburg]] to [[Lun\u00e9ville]], it could still be attacked from two sides by the second and third armies in co-operation. The intention of the great right wheel was to attack the principal French army in such a direction as to drive it north and cut its communications with Paris. The fortress of Metz was to be only monitored, and the main German forces, after defeating the chief French army, would then march against Paris.\n\nThis plan was carried out in its broad outlines. The [[Battle of W\u00f6rth]] was brought on prematurely, and therefore led, not to the capture of [[Patrice MacMahon, duc de Magenta|MacMahon]]'s army, which was intended, but only to its defeat and hasty retreat as far as Ch\u00e2lons. The [[Battle of Spicheren]] was not intended by Moltke, who wished to keep [[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine|Bazaine]]'s army on the [[Saar (river)|Saar]] until he could attack it with the second army in front and the first army on its left flank. But these unexpected victories did not disconcert Moltke, who carried out his intended advance to Pont-Mousson, crossed the Moselle with the first and second armies, then faced north and wheeled round, so that the effect of the battle of Gravelotte was to drive Bazaine into the fortress of Metz and cut him off from Paris.\n\nNothing shows Moltke's insight and strength of purpose in a clearer light than his determination to attack on 18 August, at the [[Battle of Gravelotte]], when other strategists would have thought that, the strategic victory having been gained, a tactical victory was unnecessary. He has been blamed for the last attack of Gravelotte, in which there was a fruitless heavy loss; but it is now known that this attack was ordered by the king, and Moltke blamed himself for not having used his influence to prevent it.\n\nDuring the night following the battle Moltke left one army to invest [[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine|Bazaine]] at Metz, and set out with the two others to march towards Paris, the more southerly one leading, so that when MacMahon's army should be found the main blow might be delivered from the south and MacMahon driven to the north. On August 25 it was found that MacMahon was moving north-east for the relief of Bazaine. The moment Moltke was satisfied of the accuracy of his information, he ordered the German columns to turn their faces north instead of west. MacMahon's right wing was attacked at [[Beaumont, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Beaumont]] <!-- ?? --> while attempting to cross the [[Meuse River|Meuse]], his advance necessarily abandoned, and his army with difficulty collected at Sedan.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Battle of Sedan]], the two German armies surrounded the French army, which on September 1 was attacked from multiple sides and compelled to surrender. Moltke then resumed the advance on Paris, which was also surrounded.\n\nFrom this time Moltke's strategy is remarkable for its judicious economy of force, for he was wise enough never to attempt more than was practicable with the means at his disposal. The surrender of Metz and of Paris was just a question of time, and the problem was, while maintaining the sieges, to be able to ward off the attacks of the new French armies levied for the purpose of raising the [[Siege of Paris (1870\u201371)|Siege of Paris]]. The [[Siege of Metz (1870)|Siege of Metz]] ended with its surrender on October 27.\n\nOn January 28, 1871, [[Armistice of Versailles|an armistice was concluded at Versailles]] by which the garrison became virtually prisoners and the war was ended.\n\n==Final years==\n[[File:Krzyzowa4.JPG|thumb|The Moltke palace at Kreisau, now [[Krzy\u017cowa, \u015awidnica County|Krzy\u017cowa]], in 2005]]\n[[File:Prussian Field Marshal Moltke the Elder Br.

Bronze Medal by August Schabel, [[Munich]].]]\n\nIn October 1870, Moltke was made a [[Graf]] (Count) as a reward for his services during the Franco-Prussian War and victory at the Battle of Sedan. In June 1871, he was further rewarded by a promotion to the rank of [[field marshal]] and a large monetary grant. He served in the [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] of the [[North German Confederation]] from 1867\u201371, and from 1871\u201391 he was a member of the ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'' (federal parliament).

After the war, he became a national hero and celebrity. More than 50 monuments to Moltke were erected throughout Germany in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; some were destroyed during or after World War II but many remain.\n\nWhen Moltke retired in 1888 as Chief of the General Staff, he was succeeded by [[Alfred Graf von Waldersee|Alfred von Waldersee]]. (His nephew, [[Helmuth Johann Ludwig von Moltke]], was chief from 1906 to 1914.) Moltke officially retired from active service on August 9, 1888. His 90th birthday on October 26, 1890 was declared a national holiday.
