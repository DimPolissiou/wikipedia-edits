Later the word came to denote any weapon which was used by releasing it from one's hand (e.g. an arrow, compared to keeping it one's hand e.g. a sword [shastra]). In Ramayana and Mahabharata, [[Arjuna]] had more number of astras than other warriors.

The [[deity]] invoked would then endow the weapon making it impossible to counter through regular means.\nSpecific conditions existed involving the usage of ''astras'', the violation of which could be fatal. Because of the power involved, the knowledge involving an ''astra'' was passed in the [[Guru-shishya tradition]] from a [[Guru]] (teacher) to a ''Shishya'' (pupil) by word of mouth alone, and only following the establishment of the student's character. Certain ''astras'' had to be handed down from the [[deity]] involved directly, knowledge of the incantation being insufficient.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Astras in Hindu Epics==\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2017}}\n[[File:Arjuna gifted Arrow of Fire to Gandarva.jpg|thumb|Arjuna gifts the Agneyastra to the Gandharva]]\nAstras come into importance mainly in the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], where they are used in the great battles described in each epic.

From this perspective, in every social system there is a dominant (hegemonic) and idealised form of masculinity and an apotheosised form of femininity that is considered as proper for men and women. This idealised form of masculinity (hegemonic masculinity) legitimates and normalises certain performances of men, and pathologises, marginalises, and subordinates any other expressions of masculinities or femininities (masculine and feminine subject positions). Alongside hegemonic masculinity, Connell postulated that there are other forms of masculinities (marginalised and subordinated), which according to the findings of a plethora of studies are constructed in oppressive ways (Thorne 1993). This is symptomatic of the fact that hegemonic masculinity is relational, which means that it is constructed in relation to and against an Other (emphasised femininity, marginalised and subordinated masculinities).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kostas | first1 = M | year = 2018 | title = Snow White in Hellenic primary classrooms: Children's responses to non-traditional gender discourses | journal = Gender and Education | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 530\u2013548 | doi = 10.1080/09540253.2016.1237619 | url = http://create.canterbury.ac.uk/16529/3/16529_Snow%20White%20in%20the%20Hellenic%20Primary%20Classrooms..pdf }}</ref> In addition to describing forceful articulations of violent masculine identities, hegemonic masculinity has also been used to describe implicit, indirect, or coercive forms of gendered socialisation, enacted through video games, fashion, humour, and so on.<ref>Laurie, Timothy; Hickey-Moody, Anna (2017), \"[https://www.academia.edu/31232852/Masculinity_and_Ridicule Masculinity and ridicule]\", in {{cite book | editor-last = Papenburg | editor-first = Bettina | title = Gender: laughter | pages= 215&ndash;228 | publisher = Macmillan Reference | location = Farmington Hills, Michigan | year = 2017 | isbn = 9780028663265 }}</ref>\n\n====Precarious manhood====\nResearchers have argued that the \"precariousness\" of manhood contributes to traditionally-masculine behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bosson | first1 = Jennifer K. | last2 = Vandello | first2 = Joseph A. | title = Precarious manhood and its links to action and aggression | journal = [[Current Directions in Psychological Science]] | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 82\u201386 | doi = 10.1177/0963721411402669 | date = April 2011 | ref = harv | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8e388ea50eefccf3ed156d8ceebff986981c3796 }}</ref> \"Precarious\" means that manhood is not inborn, but must be achieved.

Men between 25 and 65 are four times more likely to die from [[cardiovascular disease]] than women, and are more likely to be diagnosed with a [[terminal illness]] because of their reluctance to see a doctor.

From this perspective, in every social system there is a dominant (hegemonic) and idealised form of masculinity and an apotheosised form of femininity that is considered as proper for men and women. This idealised form of masculinity (hegemonic masculinity) legitimates and normalises certain performances of men, and pathologises, marginalises, and subordinates any other expressions of masculinities or femininities (masculine and feminine subject positions). Alongside hegemonic masculinity, Connell postulated that there are other forms of masculinities (marginalised and subordinated), which according to the findings of a plethora of studies are constructed in oppressive ways (Thorne 1993).

The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street. [[David II of Scotland|David II]] visited it towards the end of his reign in 1371.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> [[Duke of Montrose|The Dukedom of Montrose]] was created in 1488.\n\nDuring the 15th century the inhabitants of the town found themselves increasingly under heel of the Lairds of Dun who ransacked and took possession of property and cattle. The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that [[James IV of Scotland]] intervened and settled the matter.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Montrose and The Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 487549.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Montrose and the steeple]]\nFrom its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the [[Hanseatic League]]. The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

As well as a training base Montrose was also an operational airfield for [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] squadrons, which flew sorties over [[Norway]] and were a part of the air defences for [[Edinburgh]]. Of course, this also made the town a target for German aircraft and it was bombed on more than one occasion.

The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street.

The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived.

The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

Its facilities were expanded several in the next few decades and it underwent various changes in name, finally becoming Sunnyside Royal Hospital in 1962.

As well as a training base Montrose was also an operational airfield for [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] squadrons, which flew sorties over [[Norway]] and were a part of the air defences for [[Edinburgh]]. Of course, this also made the town a target for German aircraft and it was bombed on more than one occasion.

For example, fullerene is notoriously insoluble and adding a suitable group can enhance solubility.<ref name=full/> By adding a polymerizable group, a fullerene polymer can be obtained. Functionalized fullerenes are divided into two classes: [[exohedral fullerenes]] with substituents outside the cage and [[endohedral fullerenes]] with trapped molecules inside the cage.\n\nThis article covers the chemistry of these so-called \"buckyballs,\" while the chemistry of [[carbon nanotubes]] is covered in [[carbon nanotube chemistry]].\n\n==Chemical properties of fullerenes ==\n{{see also|Endohedral fullerenes}}\nFullerene or C<sub>60</sub> is [[Truncated icosahedron|soccer-ball-shaped]] or ''I<sub>h</sub>'' with 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. According to [[Euler characteristic|Euler's theorem]] these 12 pentagons are required for closure of the carbon network consisting of ''n'' hexagons and C<sub>60</sub> is the first stable fullerene because it is the smallest possible to obey this rule. In this structure none of the pentagons make contact with each other. Both C<sub>60</sub> and its relative C<sub>70</sub> obey this so-called isolated pentagon rule (IPR). The next homologue C<sub>84</sub> has  24 IPR isomers of which several are isolated and another 51,568 non-IPR isomers. Non-IPR fullerenes have thus far only been isolated as endohedral fullerenes such as Tb<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>84</sub> with two fused pentagons at the apex of an egg-shaped cage.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Beavers | first1 = C.

It is estimated that [[strain energy]] constitutes 80% of the [[heat of formation]]. The conjugated carbon atoms respond to deviation from planarity by [[orbital hybridization|orbital rehybridization]] of the sp\u00b2 [[Molecular orbital|orbital]]s and [[pi orbital|\u03c0 orbital]]s to a sp<sup>2.27</sup> orbital with a gain in p-character. The p lobes extend further outside the surface than they do into the interior of the sphere and this is one of the reasons a fullerene is [[electronegative]]. The other reason is that the empty low-lying \u03c0<sup>*</sup> orbitals also have a high s character.\n\nThe double bonds in fullerene are not all the same. Two groups can be identified: 30 so-called [6,6] double bonds connect two hexagons and 60 [5,6] bonds connect a hexagon and a pentagon. Of the two the [6,6] bonds are shorter with more double-bond character and therefore a hexagon is often represented as a [[cyclohexatriene]] and a pentagon as a pentalene or [5][[radialene]]. In other words, although the carbon atoms in fullerene are all conjugated the superstructure is not a [[Superaromaticity|super]] [[aromatic compound]].  The [[X-ray diffraction]] [[bond length]] values are 139.1 [[picometer|pm]] for the [6,6] bond and 145.5 pm for the [5,6] bond.\n\nC<sub>60</sub> fullerene has 60 \u03c0 electrons but a [[closed shell configuration]] requires 72 electrons. The fullerene is able to acquire the missing electrons by reaction with [[potassium]] to form first the {{chem|K|6|C|60|6-}} salt and then the {{chem|K|12|C|60|12-}} In this compound the bond length alternation observed in the parent molecule has vanished.\n\n==Fullerene reactions==\n\n{{see also|Bingel reaction|Prato reaction}}\nFullerenes tend to react as electrophiles. An additional driving force is relief of [[strain (chemistry)|strain]] when double bonds become saturated. Key in this type of reaction is the level of functionalization i.e. monoaddition or multiple additions and in case of multiple additions their topological relationships (new substituents huddled together or evenly spaced). In conformity with [[IUPAC]] rules, the terms [[methanofullerene]]  are used to indicate  the ring-closed ([[cyclopropane]]) [[fullerene]] derivatives, and fulleroid to ring-open ([[methanoannulene]]) structures.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Prato | first1 = M. | last2 = Lucchini | first2 = V. | last3 = Maggini | first3 = M. | last4 = Stimpfl | first4 = E. | last5 = Scorrano | first5 = G. | last6 = Eiermann | first6 = M. | last7 = Suzuki | first7 = T. | last8 = Wudl | first8 = F. | doi = 10.1021/ja00071a080 | title = Energetic preference in 5,6 and 6,6 ring junction adducts of C60: Fulleroids and methanofullerenes | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 115 | issue = 18 | pages = 8479 | year = 1993 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Vogel | first1 = E. | title = Recent advances in the chemistry of bridged annulenes | doi = 10.1351/pac198254051015 | journal = Pure and Applied Chemistry | volume = 54 | issue = 5 | pages = 1015\u20131039 | year = 1982 | pmid =  | pmc = | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n===Nucleophilic additions===\nFullerenes react as [[electrophile]]s with a host of nucleophiles in [[nucleophilic addition]]s.

Examples of hydrofullerenes are C<sub>60</sub>H<sub>18</sub> and C<sub>60</sub>H<sub>36</sub>. However, completely hydrogenated C<sub>60</sub>H<sub>60</sub> is only hypothetical because of large strain. Highly hydrogenated fullerenes are not stable, as prolonged hydrogenation of fullerenes by direct reaction with hydrogen gas at high temperature conditions results in cage fragmentation. At the final reaction stage this causes collapse of cage structure with formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Talyzin | first1 = A.

For example, fullerene is notoriously insoluble and adding a suitable group can enhance solubility.<ref name=full/> By adding a polymerizable group, a fullerene polymer can be obtained. Functionalized fullerenes are divided into two classes: [[exohedral fullerenes]] with substituents outside the cage and [[endohedral fullerenes]] with trapped molecules inside the cage.\n\nThis article covers the chemistry of these so-called \"buckyballs,\" while the chemistry of [[carbon nanotubes]] is covered in [[carbon nanotube chemistry]].\n\n==Chemical properties of fullerenes ==\n{{see also|Endohedral fullerenes}}\nFullerene or C<sub>60</sub> is [[Truncated icosahedron|soccer-ball-shaped]] or ''I<sub>h</sub>'' with 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons.

In this structure none of the pentagons make contact with each other. Both C<sub>60</sub> and its relative C<sub>70</sub> obey this so-called isolated pentagon rule (IPR). The next homologue C<sub>84</sub> has  24 IPR isomers of which several are isolated and another 51,568 non-IPR isomers.

It is estimated that [[strain energy]] constitutes 80% of the [[heat of formation]]. The conjugated carbon atoms respond to deviation from planarity by [[orbital hybridization|orbital rehybridization]] of the sp\u00b2 [[Molecular orbital|orbital]]s and [[pi orbital|\u03c0 orbital]]s to a sp<sup>2.27</sup> orbital with a gain in p-character. The p lobes extend further outside the surface than they do into the interior of the sphere and this is one of the reasons a fullerene is [[electronegative]]. The other reason is that the empty low-lying \u03c0<sup>*</sup> orbitals also have a high s character.\n\nThe double bonds in fullerene are not all the same. Two groups can be identified: 30 so-called [6,6] double bonds connect two hexagons and 60 [5,6] bonds connect a hexagon and a pentagon. Of the two the [6,6] bonds are shorter with more double-bond character and therefore a hexagon is often represented as a [[cyclohexatriene]] and a pentagon as a pentalene or [5][[radialene]]. In other words, although the carbon atoms in fullerene are all conjugated the superstructure is not a [[Superaromaticity|super]] [[aromatic compound]].  The [[X-ray diffraction]] [[bond length]] values are 139.1 [[picometer|pm]] for the [6,6] bond and 145.5 pm for the [5,6] bond.\n\nC<sub>60</sub> fullerene has 60 \u03c0 electrons but a [[closed shell configuration]] requires 72 electrons. The fullerene is able to acquire the missing electrons by reaction with [[potassium]] to form first the {{chem|K|6|C|60|6-}} salt and then the {{chem|K|12|C|60|12-}} In this compound the bond length alternation observed in the parent molecule has vanished.\n\n==Fullerene reactions==\n\n{{see also|Bingel reaction|Prato reaction}}\nFullerenes tend to react as electrophiles. An additional driving force is relief of [[strain (chemistry)|strain]] when double bonds become saturated. Key in this type of reaction is the level of functionalization i.e. monoaddition or multiple additions and in case of multiple additions their topological relationships (new substituents huddled together or evenly spaced). In conformity with [[IUPAC]] rules, the terms [[methanofullerene]]  are used to indicate  the ring-closed ([[cyclopropane]]) [[fullerene]] derivatives, and fulleroid to ring-open ([[methanoannulene]]) structures.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Prato | first1 = M. | last2 = Lucchini | first2 = V. | last3 = Maggini | first3 = M. | last4 = Stimpfl | first4 = E. | last5 = Scorrano | first5 = G. | last6 = Eiermann | first6 = M. | last7 = Suzuki | first7 = T. | last8 = Wudl | first8 = F. | doi = 10.1021/ja00071a080 | title = Energetic preference in 5,6 and 6,6 ring junction adducts of C60: Fulleroids and methanofullerenes | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 115 | issue = 18 | pages = 8479 | year = 1993 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Vogel | first1 = E. | title = Recent advances in the chemistry of bridged annulenes | doi = 10.1351/pac198254051015 | journal = Pure and Applied Chemistry | volume = 54 | issue = 5 | pages = 1015\u20131039 | year = 1982 | pmid =  | pmc = | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n===Nucleophilic additions===\nFullerenes react as [[electrophile]]s with a host of nucleophiles in [[nucleophilic addition]]s.

The [6,6] double bond is electron-deficient and usually forms metallic bonds with \u03b7 = 2 [[hapticity]].

In fullerene production mixtures of C<sub>60</sub>, C<sub>70</sub> and higher [[homologization|homologues]] are always formed. Fullerene purification is key to [[fullerene]] science and determines fullerene prices and the success of practical applications of fullerenes. The first available purification method for C<sub>60</sub> fullerene was by [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] from which small amounts could be generated at large expense.\n\nA practical laboratory-scale method for purification of soot enriched in C<sub>60</sub> and C<sub>70</sub> starts with [[solvent extraction|extraction]] in [[toluene]] followed by [[filtration]] with a paper filter. The solvent is evaporated and the residue (the toluene-soluble soot fraction) redissolved in toluene and subjected to [[column chromatography]].

''In Harihar Nagar'' was remade twice in [[Hindi]] as ''[[Parda Hai Parda (1992 film)|Parda Hai Parda]]'' and ''[[Dhol (film)|Dhol]]'', in [[Kannada]] as ''[[Nagaradalli Nayakaru]]'', in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as ''[[MGR Nagaril (1991 film)|MGR Nagaril]]'', and in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''Madhuranagarilo''.\n\n==Plot==\n{{copyedit |date=April 2020}}\nMahadevan ([[Mukesh (actor)|Mukesh]]), Govindan Kutty ([[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]]), Appukuttan ([[Jagadish]]) and Thomas Kutty ([[Ashokan (actor)|Ashokan]]) are four young men who live in the housing colony named 'Harihar Nagar.' The movie starts with an incident that takes place in [[Mumbai|Bombay]], where a burglar, John Honai, breaks in looking for a specific briefcase. In the next scene the four young men make an appearance, using their wiles to impress young, neighborhood girls. A girl, Maya ([[Geetha Vijayan]]), along with her grandparents relocate to Harihar Nagar and happen to be Mahadevan's new neighbors. The four try to win her over on many occasions. One day they see her posting a letter and they bribe the postman to get hold of the letter. On reading the contents of the letter, they learn that Maya has come to Harihar Nagar to learn about the death of her brother - Sethu Madhavan ([[Suresh Gopi]]). \n\nMaya visits the house of Andrew's ([[Saikumar (Malayalam actor)|Saikumar]]), a friend of Sethu Madhavan. She asks Andrew's mother, called Ammachi by him and his friends, ([[Kaviyoor Ponnamma]]) to contact her if she gets any information about her brother. The four men approach Ammachi, pretending to be Sethu's friends. They manage to get Sethu's photograph by telling her that they want it for the colony's sports club. Maya gets this information from Ammachi and meets the four young men. She believes them to be Sethu's friends after seeing his photo at their house. The four cook up a story about an affair Sethu had with a girl.\n\nHearing the news that the four men are friends of Sethu, the burglar, John Honai, kidnaps them in order to retrieve a mysterious briefcase. Maya, in search of her brother's lover,finds details of Annie Philip ([[Rekha (South Indian actress)|Rekha]]), who was a friend of her brother's from the library. Annie is now a nun in a church and adopted the name Sister Josephine. Josephine narrates about her history with Sethu when questioned by Maya. Andrew's father was a businessman who was murdered by John Honai's father and he built a business empire with the money taken from Andrew's father. Andrews creates trouble in that business to take revenge. Honai's father then sells all his assets and tries to run away with the money in the briefcase, but gets murdered by Andrews on the way.Later,Andrews is seen murdered on a [[beach]]. \n\nSethu arrives at Harihar Nagar to give this money to Ammachi, but when he finds out that Ammachi is ignorant of Andrews's death and is still waiting for him, he gives it to Annie, who was Andrews's girlfriend. After returning to Bombay, Sethu gives John Honai a briefcase similar to the one given to Annie, but when Honai opens it, he finds it full of bricks and stones. Angered,he murders Sethu.\n\nThe four young men who were kidnapped by Honai manage to escape and are chased by Honai and his associates. Soon, Maya and her grandparents are also kidnapped by Honai but the four young men rescue them. Ammachi comes to know about Andrew's death from Sister Josephine, who gives her the briefcase. While Ammachi is cooking dinner, Honai comes to her house to get the briefcase. Ammachi removes the fuse lights are switched off. After trying to find Ammachi, Honai unknowingly lights a lighter near the gas stove which was switched on, and is burned to death.\n\nIn the end, Maya and her grandparents are shown moving out. Maya gives the four young men the briefcase, which they open and see that it is full of treasure.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mukesh (actor)|Mukesh]] as Mahadevan\n* [[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]] as Govindan Kutty\n* [[Jagadish]] as Appukuttan\n* [[Ashokan (actor)|Ashokan]] as Thomas Kutty\n* [[Suresh Gopi]] as Sethumadhavan\n* [[Saikumar (Malayalam actor)|Saikumar]] as Andrews\n* [[Riza Bava]] as John Honai\n* [[Geetha Vijayan]] as Maya\n* [[Rekha (Tamil actress)|Rekha]] as Sister Josephine / Annie Phillip\n* [[Kaviyoor Ponnamma]] as Andrews's mother\n* [[Philomina]] as Sethumadhavan's and Maya's grandmother\n* [[Paravoor Bharathan]] as Sethumadhavan's and Maya's grandfather\n* [[Appa Haja]] as Cherian\n* [[Thrissur Elsy]] as Mahadevan's mother\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack features two super hit songs composed by [[S.

The movie starts with an incident that takes place in [[Mumbai|Bombay]], where a burglar, John Honai, breaks in looking for a specific briefcase. In the next scene the four young men make an appearance, using their wiles to impress young, neighborhood girls. A girl, Maya ([[Geetha Vijayan]]), along with her grandparents relocate to Harihar Nagar and happen to be Mahadevan's new neighbors. The four try to win her over on many occasions. One day they see her posting a letter and they bribe the postman to get hold of the letter. On reading the contents of the letter, they learn that Maya has come to Harihar Nagar to learn about the death of her brother - Sethu Madhavan ([[Suresh Gopi]]). \n\nMaya visits the house of Andrew's ([[Saikumar (Malayalam actor)|Saikumar]]), a friend of Sethu Madhavan. She asks Andrew's mother, called Ammachi by him and his friends, ([[Kaviyoor Ponnamma]]) to contact her if she gets any information about her brother. The four men approach Ammachi, pretending to be Sethu's friends. They manage to get Sethu's photograph by telling her that they want it for the colony's sports club. Maya gets this information from Ammachi and meets the four young men. She believes them to be Sethu's friends after seeing his photo at their house. The four cook up a story about an affair Sethu had with a girl.\n\nHearing the news that the four men are friends of Sethu, the burglar, John Honai, kidnaps them in order to retrieve a mysterious briefcase. Maya, in search of her brother's lover,finds details of Annie Philip ([[Rekha (South Indian actress)|Rekha]]), who was a friend of her brother's from the library. Annie is now a nun in a church and adopted the name Sister Josephine. Josephine narrates about her history with Sethu when questioned by Maya. Andrew's father was a businessman who was murdered by John Honai's father and he built a business empire with the money taken from Andrew's father. Andrews creates trouble in that business to take revenge. Honai's father then sells all his assets and tries to run away with the money in the briefcase, but gets murdered by Andrews on the way.Later,Andrews is seen murdered on a [[beach]]. \n\nSethu arrives at Harihar Nagar to give this money to Ammachi, but when he finds out that Ammachi is ignorant of Andrews's death and is still waiting for him, he gives it to Annie, who was Andrews's girlfriend. After returning to Bombay, Sethu gives John Honai a briefcase similar to the one given to Annie, but when Honai opens it, he finds it full of bricks and stones. Angered,he murders Sethu.\n\nThe four young men who were kidnapped by Honai manage to escape and are chased by Honai and his associates. Soon, Maya and her grandparents are also kidnapped by Honai but the four young men rescue them. Ammachi comes to know about Andrew's death from Sister Josephine, who gives her the briefcase. While Ammachi is cooking dinner, Honai comes to her house to get the briefcase. Ammachi removes the fuse lights are switched off. After trying to find Ammachi, Honai unknowingly lights a lighter near the gas stove which was switched on, and is burned to death.\n\nIn the end, Maya and her grandparents are shown moving out.
