In the interview with Digitalspy Jonathan went on to confirm this, speaking of his character he said: {{cquote|I don't think he's really that snidey and dark. Just your classic teenage lazy boy... He's mainly close to Mel, his twin sister, they're very close, as much as they do get down each others' necks<ref name=\"digitalspy.co.uk\"/>}}\n\nDarryl first appears on-screen 18 March 2007. He lives in the shed of the garden of Number 6. He gets into trouble with the law for several motoring offences, and is horrified when twin sister [[Mel Morton|Mel]] ([[Emma Edmondson]]) says that she plans to join the police. Soon after his arrival he strikes up a close friendship with next door neighbour [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]) (coincidentally his real life childhood friend).\n\n===Casting===\nDuring the casting for the character of Darryl Morton different actors were called in for auditions for the role. Actor Jonathan Dixon revealed in an interview with Digital Spy that he was called back through five stages of auditioning and eventually got down to the last two where he had to audition against a long term friend. During each stage of auditioning the hopefuls had to audition as sets of twins. Jonathan continually met fellow cast member Emma Edmondson who plays his on-screen sister Mel. In the final audition the two were paired up, and went on to be cast as twins Mel and Darryl.<ref name=\"digitalspy.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a43530/jonathan-dixon-and-emma-edmondson.html|title=Jonathan Dixon and Emma Edmondson|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|author=Kriss Green|date=2007-03-17|accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref> It also emerged that the actor is real life friend of fellow cast member [[Jack P.

In April 2007 it was announced that he would be involved in a heavy [[marijuana]] smoking scene with [[Vernon Tomlin]] ([[Ian Reddington]]). It caused controversy, and the soap's executive producer Kieran Roberts stated that: \"Not all stories are to the taste of all our viewers. But the vast majority of the time we get it right. We do not set out to shock and sensationalise.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lifestyleextra.com/TVNews.asp?Code=TR157767L&headline=coronation_street_to_air_graffic_drugs_scene|title=Coronation Street to air Graffic Drug Scene|publisher=Lifestyle Extra|author=Webmaster|date=March 2007|accessdate=4 February 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713204523/http://www.lifestyleextra.com/TVNews.asp?Code=TR157767L&headline=coronation_street_to_air_graffic_drugs_scene|archive-date=13 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although the scene did not air, there is a milder scene at the Morton's house-warming party where Vernon takes on a mellow disposition after smoking a joint Darryl gives him.\n\nOn 16 September 2007, Darryl's friend 'Stig' asks him to look after some [[methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]] tablets. Afraid that his dad would find them, he asks David to look after them, but he hides them in one of his niece's dolls. However, when [[Bethany Platt|Bethany]] (Amy & Emily Walton) swallows one, David decides to protect his friend and bails Darryl out by taking the blame for possession. After a brief flirtation in the Rovers with barmaid [[Lauren Wilson (Coronation Street)|Lauren Wilson]] ([[Lucy Evans]]), Darryl begins dating her.  After a few dates of playing hard to get, they begin seeing each other on a more regular basis. He often pays for their dates and drinks, even though Mel tells him that his money is the only reason she is interested. Their involvement with each other comes to an end when Lauren becomes angry with him having no money, and states they were never an item.\n\nOriginally, Darryl was supposed to be leaving with the rest of the Morton clan. However, in an interview with the ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'', Michael Starke who plays his father Jerry revealed they had kept Darryl's character on because of \"his character links in with David Platt\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2008/08/29/michael-starke-i-m-so-sad-my-time-in-coronation-street-is-finished-100252-21632880/|title=Michael Starke: I\u2019m so sad my time in Coronation Street is finished|publisher=Liverpool Echo|author=Paddy Shennan|date=29 August 2008|accessdate=4 February 2009}}</ref> Jerry collapses on 27 August 2008 and goes into care on 31 August, where Darryl and the rest of the family were told that Jerry is still alive and has a high chance of staying that way, but also that he may die. Jerry makes a full recovery but discovers that wife [[Teresa Bryant]] ([[Karen Henthorn]]) has been poisoning him. Darryl, along with his siblings order Teresa out of the family home as a result. [[Amber Kalirai]] ([[Nikki Patel]]) becomes close to Darryl and they subsequently start a relationship.\n\nDarryl opts to stay on in Weatherfield when Jerry decides that he is moving Kayleigh and [[Finlay Bryant|Finlay]] (Ramone Quinn) to [[Spain]] in September 2008 due to his job and friends being on the Street. He allowed Teresa back into the house after finding her drunk on the street. He subsequently gets into trouble with Amber's overprotective father [[Dev Alahan|Dev]] ([[Jimmi Harkishin]]) after he discovers that he is having sex with Amber. In November 2008, Dev takes over Jerry's takeaway shop as it proves too much for Darryl to run alone. Darryl is dismayed to learn that as well as selling the business to Dev, Jerry is putting No. 6 on the market. After much difficulty of running the shop alone on his first day as owner, Dev eventually relents and asks Darryl to run the place for him.\n\nPrior due to Jerry's departure, Darryl and his mother Teresa have been evicted form their home as Jerry decides to rent the house to new family, the Windasses. However, before the family can move in, Teresa protests to the idea by barricading herself in the house, refusing to come out. This prompts Darryl to bribe her by putting money in the letter box, but to no avail. The Windasses run out of patience and decide to do the job themselves by smashing the front door window with a crutch.

Afraid that his dad would find them, he asks David to look after them, but he hides them in one of his niece's dolls. However, when [[Bethany Platt|Bethany]] (Amy & Emily Walton) swallows one, David decides to protect his friend and bails Darryl out by taking the blame for possession.

{"title_page": "West London Railway", "text_new": "{{about|the West London Railway and the West London Extension Railway, short connecting railways in West London|the present-day route|West London Line}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe '''West London Railway''' was conceived to link the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] and the [[Great Western Railway]] with the Kensington Basin of the [[Kensington Canal]], enabling access to and from London docks for the carriage of goods. It opened in 1844 but was not commercially successful.\n\nIn 1863 the canal was closed and the railway extended southwards on its alignment as the '''West London Extension Railway''', crossing the River Thames on a new bridge and connecting with the [[London Brighton and South Coast Railway]] and the [[London and South Western Railway]] south of the Thames. Local and long-distance passenger traffic was carried, and goods traffic exchanging between the connected railways. Passenger traffic declined after 1940, but the line remained open for sporadic freight services. In recent years regular local passenger services have revived the traffic on the line.\n\n==Origins==\nThe short \"Kensington Canal\" was opened on 12 August 1828, running from the River Thames a little west of Battersea Bridge to a basin near Kensington Road and Uxbridge Road, in a relatively undeveloped area to the west of London. The Times reported that \"the canal runs from the Thames, near the Battersea-bridge, directly north two miles and a quarter, terminating close to the great Western road.\"<ref name = times>''The Times'' (newspaper), London, Wednesday 13 August 1828</ref>\n\nIt had been intended that the canal would be extended further north to the Grand Junction Canal<ref group = note>Later forming a constituent part of the Grand Union Canal; this part of the canal was sometimes referred to as the \"Paddington Canal\".</ref> but the cost of the section built was much more than estimated. The canal was tidal, like the Thames, and the traffic and income from it were substantially less than hoped for, and the extension was dropped.\n\nThe London and Birmingham Railway and the Great Western Railway were projected in the early 1830s. Their London terminals would be on the north-west margin of London, and at that time they considered it essential to have a connection to the London docks east of London Bridge: a railway to a canal connected with the Thames might serve this purpose. In February 1836 the canal proprietors accepted an offer for their canal from the new \"Birmingham, Bristol and Thames Junction Railway\".<ref group = note>Some references erroneously quote the company name as ''Bristol, Birmingham and Thames Junction Railway''</ref>\n\nThe railway company obtained an Act of Parliament on 21 June 1836 authorising it to build a railway from Holsden Green (later called Harlesden), under the Paddington Canal at Wormholt Scrubbs (later Wormwood Scrubs), under the Uxbridge Road (then the Oxford Road) and under the Hammersmith Turnpike.<ref name= borley>H V Borley and R W Kidner, ''The West London Railway and the W.L.E.R.'', Oakwood Press, Lingfield, undated</ref>\n\nConstruction of the line was much delayed, and meanwhile the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) was being built across its path. A flat crossing was arranged, and by agreement of 4 February 1837 GWR trains would have precedence with signals and heavy barriers across the BB&TJR line provided under the control of a GWR man.<ref name = macdermot1>E T MacDermot, ''History of the Great Western Railway'', vol I, Great Western Railway, London, 1927</ref>\n\nIn 1839 the railway completed purchase of the canal for \u00a336,000, of which \u00a310,000 was in cash and \u00a326,000 in their own shares at face value.<ref name = brithist>British History Online, ''The Kensington Canal, railways and related developments'', at [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50329#s1]</ref>\n\nAs the calls on shares became due some of the shareholders defaulted and arrears soon amounted to \u00a328,000: the company was unable to pay current bills. On 23 July 1840 statutory authority to raise a further \u00a375,000 was obtained, and the opportunity provided by this second application to Parliament was used to change the name to the West London Railway Company.<ref name = borley/>\n\nMoney was still scarce, and it was not until 1843 that the company managed to clear its bills.<ref name = levien>D. V. Levien, ''The Hitherto Untold Story of \"Punch\u2019s Railway\"'', in the Great Western Railway Magazine, vol.XLVIII, 1936, quoted in British History Online</ref> Construction was further delayed, resumed in March 1843.<ref name = borley/>\n\nIn 1839 Samuel Clegg and Jacob Samuda, approached the company for permission to use its uncompleted line for trials of their atmospheric system, with stationary engines exhausting air from a pipe laid between the rails; a carriage on the train carried a piston inside the pipe and the air pressure provided tractive force.<ref name = macdermot2>E T MacDermot, ''History of the Great Western Railway'', vol II, Great Western Railway, London, 1932</ref>\n{{main|Atmospheric railway}}\n\nPart of the trackbed for about a half mile south from the GWR crossing was allocated to them, and they started demonstrations on 11 June 1840, having laid their own track. Trials and public demonstrations continued intermittently into 1842, and at length the railway company wanted possession of the land to lay its own railway. This seems to have involved conflict, and the company only got possession in 1843, having paid a sum in compensation. There is no suggestion that there was any intention to use the system on the line.<ref name = borley/>\n\n==Opening at last==\n[[File:West London Railway 1850.gif|thumb|The West London Railway in 1850]]The line finally opened on Whit Monday 27 May 1844, and for two days a 30-minute interval passenger service operated between Wormwood Scrubs and Kensington. Subsequently, a normal service was instituted; the passenger stations were at Kensington, Shepherds Bush, an exchange platform at the point of crossing the GWR main line, and at the junction with the London and Birmingham line.<ref name = borley/> The Kensington station was immediately to the north of Counter's Bridge, and the goods connection to the canal basin was on the south side.<ref name = brithist/>\n\nMacDermot gives a diagram for the \"West London Crossing\" in 1844; the WLR crosses under the Grand Junction Canal (sometimes referred to as the Paddington Canal) in a short tunnel; there is a \"turntable for the exchange of traffic\" to the east of the WLR and south of the GWR, with a siding connection from each line to the turntable but no other connection.<ref name = macdermot1/>\n\nThe timetable for 10 June 1844 shows seven Down (northbound) trains, four to the L&BR interchange and three to the GWR interchange; no train called at both, and the \"Junction Station\" for the GWR is on a terminal line in MacDermot's diagram. Only four Up trains are shown, two each from \"G.W. Junction\" and \"L. & B. Junction\". Connections were arranged by the other railways.\n\nTimekeeping by trains from the L&BR was very poor, due to the crossing of the GWR; the signalman there had no telegraphic communication, and was instructed not to allow a WLR train to cross if a GWR train was expected or overdue.\nThe line was single track, with mixed gauge south from the GWR. There was no through running line there: access for wagons was through a siding and a wagon turntable.<ref name = borley/><ref name = macdermot1/>\n\nThe passenger operation was not well used, and in some weeks only 50 passengers travelled. The line was losing \u00a350 a week, and notice was given to the connecting railways that the operation would be terminated; this took effect after 30 November 1844. After closure the Company had considerable debts and outstanding wages due, and the Directors personally advanced money for this; the amount outstanding in January 1845 was said to be \u00a360,000.<ref name = borley/>\n\nAfter the cessation of passenger services, several directors resigned, and there was considerable difficulty in finding replacements. When this was done, the new directors \"found the affairs of the company in a state of far greater embarrassment and difficulty than they had anticipated\". Debts now amounted to \u00a360,000, and the contractor had filed a bill in Chancery for non-payment of a debt: the line had been seized and advertised for sale.<ref name = brithist/>\n\n==A dormant period==\nThe line was now closed, but by agreement of 11 March 1845 the L&BR started to run occasional goods trains.\n\nAn Act of 1845 authorised the GWR and the L&BR to take a joint lease of the line for 999 years. The GWR had ideas of extending the line to cross the Thames to Vauxhall, but this was dropped during the financial collapse of 1848/49.<ref name = macdermot1/> The line was used only to carry coal\u2014the LNWR used it for a considerable traffic to Shepherd's Bush and Warwick Road Basin, Kensington, which was the original canal terminal. Passenger service was not re-introduced. However they did nothing to develop the business of the line until in 1849 the WLR sought an arbitration judgment against them, which they got.\n\nIn 1854 an Act was obtained under which the company's operation was vested in the LNWR, as successor to the London and Birmingham Railway from 1846, and the GWR.<ref group = note>The railway was vested in them, but the West London Railway Company itself remained in existence until nationalisation of the railways in 1948</ref><ref name = borley/>\n\n==A collision, and then first signs of progress==\n[[File:West London Railway Crossing.jpg|thumb|The flat crossing of the West London Railway and the Great Western Railway in 1844]]There was a collision at the crossing with the GWR in November 1855, and the guard of an LNWR train was killed. There were \"heavy barriers\" protecting the GWR from trains on the WLR at the crossing, and signals on the GWR. There was another signalman to operate a distant signal a mile west, in Acton Cutting. He was to repeat the indication of the crossing signal, by visual observation. The collision took place on a dark morning, when a GWR goods train ran into a LNWR train crossing its path. The LNWR train was being propelled, as \"there were no means of running round on the West London\". The GWR train consisted of \"68 waggons with the only guard's van next the second engine\".<ref name = macdermot1/>\n\nThis may have been the motivation for the owners to consider improving the line. The GWR seems to have taken the lead, obtaining Parliamentary authority to double the line and extend it south over the River Thames to join the London and Southampton Railway (later the London and South Western Railway: the L&SWR), and (by Act of 1859) eliminate the flat crossing at the north end.\n\nThe latter was swiftly put into effect, with a new line crossing over their main line by a bridge, and a spur line making a connection. In the northwards direction, the spur diverged to the right at the new North Pole Junction; it then swung left, crossing under the new high-level line and jointing the GWR main line in the direction of Reading. The through line to and from Willesden had previously passed under the Paddington Canal, with a 1 in 36 gradient to get down to the low level; it now crossed it by a bridge, the new alignment displaced a little to the west.\n\nThis was timely, for in 1862 an International Exhibition opened in Kensington, and the LNWR started a service on 2 June to the Kensington terminus with seven trains each way from and to Harrow. Simultaneously they started running trains from Kensington to and from Camden (Chalk Farm), where there were connections for Fenchurch Street over the North London Railway.<ref name = borley/>\n\n==Crossing the Thames==\n[[File:WLER 1863.gif|thumb|The West London and West London Extension Railways in 1863]]The development of the suburbs meant that the time was now right to extend the line southwards to join railways on the south side of the River Thames. The West London Extension Railway (WLER) was created by Act of Parliament in 1859, owned jointly by the subscribing companies.\n\nThe Act authorised the Company:\n<blockquote>to construct (1) a line 4 miles 6 chains in length from a junction with the West London Railway at Kensington, crossing the Thames by a bridge to a junction with the Victoria Station and Pimlico Railway at Battersea;<ref group = note>The Victoria Station and Pimlico Railway had built the northwards extension from Battersea, where the West End and Crystal Palace Railway and the London Chatham and Dover Railway had their first terminus; the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway had brought the London Brighton and South Coast Railway to Battersea</ref> (2) and (3) to branches to connect with the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway near Clapham [Junction] station, and with the [London and] South Western Railway near the junction of its Richmond branch with the main line; (4) a branch from Battersea to the London and South Western Railway [facing towards Waterloo]; (5) a 27-chain branch to the mouth of the Kensington Canal; a dock in Fulham; and diversion of part of the Kensington Canal belonging to the West London Railway north of King's Road, Chelsea.<ref name = carter>E F Carter, ''An Historical Geography of the Railways of Great Britain'', Cassell, London, 1959</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe LNWR and GWR subscribed \u00a3100,000 each, and the [[London and South Western Railway]] (L&SWR) and the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (LB&SCR) subscribed \u00a350,000 each.<ref name = borley/>\n\nBut Carter refers to additional subscriptions after the opening:\n<blockquote>By the Act of July 28, 1863, four subscribing companies were authorized to furnish capital (in addition to the original capital of \u00a3105,000) to the extent of \u00a350,000 each by the London and North Western and Great Western Railways, and \u00a325,000 each by the London and South Western and London, Brighton and South Coast Railways; these four companies having previously subscribed \u00a3105,000 between them.<ref name = carter/></blockquote>\n\nThe new line opened on 2 March 1863.

The LC&DR took the opportunity to build a line from the WLER platforms partly paralleling the WLER line to Longhedge Junction and onward, apparently intending to give connections to Ludgate Hill.\n\nThe WLER had stations at Chelsea and Battersea, and the terminal station at Kensington was extended and rebuilt some distance to the north; it had one long platform on the east side of the line.<ref name = macdermot1/> There was a goods station at [[Lillie Bridge]] and a short branch to Chelsea Basin.

Several new railway lines were built intersecting the WLR and making connections with it, and the line became home to goods terminals of the several railways making connection.\n\nAs well as the GWR service from Southall to Victoria, there was from 1 July 1864 a broad gauge service to and from the Hammersmith and City Railway via a new connection at Latimer Road; in 1872 this developed into the Middle Circle between Moorgate and Mansion House, via Baker Street, Addison Road and Earl's Court (Metropolitan District Railway). In September 1867 the LNWR started a 30-minute interval service from Broad Street to Kensington, later extended to the LBSCR Victoria station, and later still to Mansion House, forming the Outer Circle.\n\nWhen the L&SWR opened a branch north-west and then south from Kensington to Richmond via Turnham Green, it started a Richmond to Waterloo service on 1 January 1869.<ref name = white/>\n\nAt some date after 1869, the LNWR opened an extensive coal depot in sidings south of the curve to the LB&SCR side of Clapham Junction; the depot was named ''Falcon Lane''. On the inside of the curve, between it and the LB&SCR main lines, there were a small group of stabling sidings known informally as ''Pig Hill Sidings'', used for exchange of goods vehicles between the LNWR and the LB&SCR.<ref name = mitchell/>\n\n==After 1914==\nIn the nineteenth century there had been a demand for through trains from Kensington and Chelsea to all parts of the business districts; some of these routes were exceptionally circuitous and slow, and in many cases infrequent. With the rise of tube railways in the first decades of the twentieth century, frequent and more direct services became available, and changing lines was acceptable because of the frequency. At the same time electric trams offered competition, with their frequent services.\n\nThe usage of West London trains declined considerably, and the train service was reduced accordingly. The onset of the Second World War brought this decline to a head, and the LMS (as successor to the LNWR) electric services from Willesden ceased on 3 October 1940. On 20 October 1940 the steam services ended, together with the London Transport service from Edgware Road via Earls Court, and Battersea, Chelsea & Fulham and West Brompton stations were closed.\n\nOn 19 December 1946 Addison Road was renamed Kensington (Olympia) and supported a special London Transport service when public exhibitions were in progress. There was also a limited unadvertised steam service from Clapham Junction in connection with the offices of the Post Office Savings Bank. About 30 goods trains passed each way daily.\n\nAlthough the line had potential for through long-distance passenger services, this never materialised except in very limited volumes.<ref name = white/>\n\nThe northern section of the line, from Willesden Junction to Kensington Olympia and on to Earls Court, was electrified by the LNWR in 1915, but passenger use of the line dwindled under competition from road transport and the London Passenger Transport Board lines, and passenger services were discontinued after bomb damage in 1940.\n\n==Electric trains==\nThe first electric trains on the route were the joint Great Western Railway and Metropolitan Railway trains, between the connection from the Hammersmith & City line near Latimer Road, and Kensington. This started at the end of 1906 on the four-rail system. The live rails continued south as far as [[Lillie Bridge Depot]].<ref name = mitchell>Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, ''West London Line: Clapham Junction to Willesden Junction'', Middleton Press, Midhurst, 1996, {{ISBN|1 873 793 84 7}}</ref>\n\nThe LNWR operated their electric train service between Willesden Junction and Earls Court from 1914.\n\nAll electric train operation ceased in 1940 due to enemy action, and only the Earls Court to Kensington (Olympia) service was resumed afterwards, in 1946.<ref name = mitchell/>\n\nCapitalstar operation brought third rail electrification throughout.\n\n==East curve at North Pole Junction==\nCobb's Atlas<ref name = cobb>Col M H Cobb, ''The Railways of Great Britain -- A Historical Atlas'', Ian Allan Publishing Limited, Shepperton, 2003, {{ISBN|07110 3003 0}}</ref> shows an east curve at North Pole Junction, apparently enabling through running from Kensington towards Paddington.

The periodical is easily available online and it is difficult to find these claimed references, and the facts seem to be more prosaic. Arthur William \u00e0 Beckett wrote an autobiography, including his childhood at a time when his father lived in Kensington:\n\n<blockquote>Portland House, North End, Fulham, half a century ago, had some very fine pleasure grounds. To-day, if you look at it, you find it the corner house of a terrace. In its front are a number of railway lines, as it is not two hundred yards distant from the Addison Road Station, Kensington. It was proposed to start a local line which, amongst other projects, was to annex our garden. My father, to use a colloquial expression, was \"full against it,\" and did his utmost to prevent its execution. Week after week appeared attacks upon the objectionable line, until it came to be known as \"Punch's Railway.\" My father described the erection of the station and the establishment of the cabstand. According to Punch, there was so little traffic that the station-master was wont to grow cabbages\nbetween the sleepers, and train vegetable marrows along the rails. Then one cab turned up with a horse and a driver. The next day the driver disappeared, and the horse stood in his place for twelve hours. The third day the horse had disappeared with the driver. Then the horseless cab stood on the cabstand deserted for a fortnight. At the end of that time the coachman appeared without a horse and dragged away the cab single-handed. But the attacks were of no service to their author. The railway ultimately became what it now, I believe, still is, the most prosperous line in the world. If I have not been misinformed, that mile of railway in front of Portland House is leased by some of the leading English hues, and pays a dividend of enormous proportions on the original stock. My father made up\nhis mind to give up his house, and removed further East, taking up his residence in ... Hyde Park Gate.<ref>Arthur William \u00e0 Beckett, ''The \u00e0 Becketts of Punch'', 1903, reprinted by Richardson, 1969, {{ISBN|978-1115475303}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt is not possible to source any direct criticism of any named railway in ''Punch''. The West London Extension Railway had been built by the date to which the anecdote refers, and [[North End Road, Fulham|North End Road]] is somewhat to the west of the line.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group = note}}\n\n==References==\n{{commons category}}\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:1836 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:British joint railway companies]]\n[[Category:London Overground]]\n[[Category:Railway companies established in 1836]]\n[[Category:Railway lines in London]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1844]]\n[[Category:Standard gauge railways in England]]\n[[Category:Transport in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]]\n[[Category:Transport in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]]\n[[Category:Transport in the London Borough of Wandsworth]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the West London Railway and the West London Extension Railway, short connecting railways in West London|the present-day route|West London Line}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe '''West London Railway''' was conceived to link the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] and the [[Great Western Railway]] with the Kensington Basin of the [[Kensington Canal]], enabling access to and from London docks for the carriage of goods. It opened in 1844 but was not commercially successful.\n\nIn 1863 the canal was closed and the railway extended southwards on its alignment as the '''West London Extension Railway''', crossing the River Thames on a new bridge and connecting with the [[London Brighton and South Coast Railway]] and the [[London and South Western Railway]] south of the Thames. Local and long-distance passenger traffic was carried, and goods traffic exchanging between the connected railways. Passenger traffic declined after 1940, but the line remained open for sporadic freight services. In recent years regular local passenger services have revived the traffic on the line.\n\n==Origins==\nThe short \"Kensington Canal\" was opened on 12 August 1828, running from the River Thames a little west of Battersea Bridge to a basin near Kensington Road and Uxbridge Road, in a relatively undeveloped area to the west of London. The Times reported that \"the canal runs from the Thames, near the Battersea-bridge, directly north two miles and a quarter, terminating close to the great Western road.\"<ref name = times>''The Times'' (newspaper), London, Wednesday 13 August 1828</ref>\n\nIt had been intended that the canal would be extended further north to the Grand Junction Canal<ref group = note>Later forming a constituent part of the Grand Union Canal; this part of the canal was sometimes referred to as the \"Paddington Canal\".</ref> but the cost of the section built was much more than estimated. The canal was tidal, like the Thames, and the traffic and income from it were substantially less than hoped for, and the extension was dropped.\n\nThe London and Birmingham Railway and the Great Western Railway were projected in the early 1830s. Their London terminals would be on the north-west margin of London, and at that time they considered it essential to have a connection to the London docks east of London Bridge: a railway to a canal connected with the Thames might serve this purpose. In February 1836 the canal proprietors accepted an offer for their canal from the new \"Birmingham, Bristol and Thames Junction Railway\".<ref group = note>Some references erroneously quote the company name as ''Bristol, Birmingham and Thames Junction Railway''</ref>\n\nThe railway company obtained an Act of Parliament on 21 June 1836 authorising it to build a railway from Holsden Green (later called Harlesden), under the Paddington Canal at Wormholt Scrubbs (later Wormwood Scrubs), under the Uxbridge Road (then the Oxford Road) and under the Hammersmith Turnpike.<ref name= borley>H V Borley and R W Kidner, ''The West London Railway and the W.L.E.R.'', Oakwood Press, Lingfield, undated</ref>\n\nConstruction of the line was much delayed, and meanwhile the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) was being built across its path. A flat crossing was arranged, and by agreement of 4 February 1837 GWR trains would have precedence with signals and heavy barriers across the BB&TJR line provided under the control of a GWR man.<ref name = macdermot1>E T MacDermot, ''History of the Great Western Railway'', vol I, Great Western Railway, London, 1927</ref>\n\nIn 1839 the railway completed purchase of the canal for \u00a336,000, of which \u00a310,000 was in cash and \u00a326,000 in their own shares at face value.<ref name = brithist>British History Online, ''The Kensington Canal, railways and related developments'', at [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50329#s1]</ref>\n\nAs the calls on shares became due some of the shareholders defaulted and arrears soon amounted to \u00a328,000: the company was unable to pay current bills. On 23 July 1840 statutory authority to raise a further \u00a375,000 was obtained, and the opportunity provided by this second application to Parliament was used to change the name to the West London Railway Company.<ref name = borley/>\n\nMoney was still scarce, and it was not until 1843 that the company managed to clear its bills.<ref name = levien>D.

Trials and public demonstrations continued intermittently into 1842, and at length the railway company wanted possession of the land to lay its own railway. This seems to have involved conflict, and the company only got possession in 1843, having paid a sum in compensation.

Subsequently, a normal service was instituted; the passenger stations were at Kensington, Shepherds Bush, an exchange platform at the point of crossing the GWR main line, and at the junction with the London and Birmingham line.<ref name = borley/> The Kensington station was immediately to the north of Counter's Bridge, and the goods connection to the canal basin was on the south side.<ref name = brithist/>\n\nMacDermot gives a diagram for the \"West London Crossing\" in 1844; the WLR crosses under the Grand Junction Canal (sometimes referred to as the Paddington Canal) in a short tunnel; there is a \"turntable for the exchange of traffic\" to the east of the WLR and south of the GWR, with a siding connection from each line to the turntable but no other connection.<ref name = macdermot1/>\n\nThe timetable for 10 June 1844 shows seven Down (northbound) trains, four to the L&BR interchange and three to the GWR interchange; no train called at both, and the \"Junction Station\" for the GWR is on a terminal line in MacDermot's diagram. Only four Up trains are shown, two each from \"G.W. Junction\" and \"L. & B. Junction\". Connections were arranged by the other railways.\n\nTimekeeping by trains from the L&BR was very poor, due to the crossing of the GWR; the signalman there had no telegraphic communication, and was instructed not to allow a WLR train to cross if a GWR train was expected or overdue.\nThe line was single track, with mixed gauge south from the GWR. There was no through running line there: access for wagons was through a siding and a wagon turntable.<ref name = borley/><ref name = macdermot1/>\n\nThe passenger operation was not well used, and in some weeks only 50 passengers travelled. The line was losing \u00a350 a week, and notice was given to the connecting railways that the operation would be terminated; this took effect after 30 November 1844. After closure the Company had considerable debts and outstanding wages due, and the Directors personally advanced money for this; the amount outstanding in January 1845 was said to be \u00a360,000.<ref name = borley/>\n\nAfter the cessation of passenger services, several directors resigned, and there was considerable difficulty in finding replacements. When this was done, the new directors \"found the affairs of the company in a state of far greater embarrassment and difficulty than they had anticipated\". Debts now amounted to \u00a360,000, and the contractor had filed a bill in Chancery for non-payment of a debt: the line had been seized and advertised for sale.<ref name = brithist/>\n\n==A dormant period==\nThe line was now closed, but by agreement of 11 March 1845 the L&BR started to run occasional goods trains.\n\nAn Act of 1845 authorised the GWR and the L&BR to take a joint lease of the line for 999 years. The GWR had ideas of extending the line to cross the Thames to Vauxhall, but this was dropped during the financial collapse of 1848/49.<ref name = macdermot1/> The line was used only to carry coal\u2014the LNWR used it for a considerable traffic to Shepherd's Bush and Warwick Road Basin, Kensington, which was the original canal terminal.

The through line to and from Willesden had previously passed under the Paddington Canal, with a 1 in 36 gradient to get down to the low level; it now crossed it by a bridge, the new alignment displaced a little to the west.\n\nThis was timely, for in 1862 an International Exhibition opened in Kensington, and the LNWR started a service on 2 June to the Kensington terminus with seven trains each way from and to Harrow. Simultaneously they started running trains from Kensington to and from Camden (Chalk Farm), where there were connections for Fenchurch Street over the North London Railway.<ref name = borley/>\n\n==Crossing the Thames==\n[[File:WLER 1863.gif|thumb|The West London and West London Extension Railways in 1863]]The development of the suburbs meant that the time was now right to extend the line southwards to join railways on the south side of the River Thames. The West London Extension Railway (WLER) was created by Act of Parliament in 1859, owned jointly by the subscribing companies.\n\nThe Act authorised the Company:\n<blockquote>to construct (1) a line 4 miles 6 chains in length from a junction with the West London Railway at Kensington, crossing the Thames by a bridge to a junction with the Victoria Station and Pimlico Railway at Battersea;<ref group = note>The Victoria Station and Pimlico Railway had built the northwards extension from Battersea, where the West End and Crystal Palace Railway and the London Chatham and Dover Railway had their first terminus; the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway had brought the London Brighton and South Coast Railway to Battersea</ref> (2) and (3) to branches to connect with the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway near Clapham [Junction] station, and with the [London and] South Western Railway near the junction of its Richmond branch with the main line; (4) a branch from Battersea to the London and South Western Railway [facing towards Waterloo]; (5) a 27-chain branch to the mouth of the Kensington Canal; a dock in Fulham; and diversion of part of the Kensington Canal belonging to the West London Railway north of King's Road, Chelsea.<ref name = carter>E F Carter, ''An Historical Geography of the Railways of Great Britain'', Cassell, London, 1959</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe LNWR and GWR subscribed \u00a3100,000 each, and the [[London and South Western Railway]] (L&SWR) and the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (LB&SCR) subscribed \u00a350,000 each.<ref name = borley/>\n\nBut Carter refers to additional subscriptions after the opening:\n<blockquote>By the Act of July 28, 1863, four subscribing companies were authorized to furnish capital (in addition to the original capital of \u00a3105,000) to the extent of \u00a350,000 each by the London and North Western and Great Western Railways, and \u00a325,000 each by the London and South Western and London, Brighton and South Coast Railways; these four companies having previously subscribed \u00a3105,000 between them.<ref name = carter/></blockquote>\n\nThe new line opened on 2 March 1863. The LNWR and the GWR leased the original WLR between them.<ref name = white>H P White, ''London Railway History'', David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1971, {{ISBN|0 7153 5337 3}}</ref> At this time [[Samuel Carter (Coventry MP)|Samuel Carter]] served as solicitor, as he had done as early as 1845.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uudb.org/articles/samuelcarter.html|title=Samuel Carter|website=Dictionary of Unitarian and Universalist Biography|access-date=20 March 2018}}</ref>  \n\nThe line was on the alignment of the defunct Kensington Canal, crossing the Thames by New Battersea Bridge (known locally as ''Cremorne Bridge''). In these days long before street tramcars and tube railways\u2014the world's first Underground railway, the [[Metropolitan Railway]] opened earlier in 1863\u2014the provision of through trains to all possible destinations seemed to be desirable, even if the frequency was very low.\n\nAt the southern end of the new line, it divided to give through running in several directions:\n* east towards Waterloo on the L&SWR line; however only the earthworks were constructed at first; the actual track was not laid until 6 July 1865, to enable a new Euston - Willesden - Waterloo - London Bridge service.<ref name = williams2-14>R A Williams, ''The London & South Western Railway'', volume 2, page 14; David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1973, {{ISBN|0 7153 5940 1}}</ref>\n* west to separate platforms at Clapham Junction adjacent to the Richmond line platforms on the L&SWR line; there was no through connection;\n* diving under the L&SWR and LB&SCR main lines and turning west to platforms at Clapham Junction adjacent to the LB&SCR platforms, joining their line at the west end of the station, facing Brighton;\n* diving under those main lines and turning east to Longhedge Junction, joining the [[West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway]] operated by the LB&SCR, giving access to Victoria, and the [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]] (LC&DR) facing Bromley.\n\nClapham Junction station was opened on the same day as the WLER and had plenty of accommodation for each of the railways. The LC&DR took the opportunity to build a line from the WLER platforms partly paralleling the WLER line to Longhedge Junction and onward, apparently intending to give connections to Ludgate Hill.\n\nThe WLER had stations at Chelsea and Battersea, and the terminal station at Kensington was extended and rebuilt some distance to the north; it had one long platform on the east side of the line.<ref name = macdermot1/> There was a goods station at [[Lillie Bridge]] and a short branch to Chelsea Basin. (Chelsea Basin was the remaining stub of the canal, at the confluence with the Thames.)\n\nMixed-gauge track was provided from the GWR junction via Longhedge Junction to Victoria (LC&DR station), <ref group = note>Strictly speaking the station and its approaches were owned by the Victoria Station and Pimlico Company; the eastern part of Victoria station was leased for 999 years to the LC&DR and GWR jointly</ref> and from 1 April 1863 GWR trains from Southall to Victoria operated over the line. The branch to the WLR at Old Oak Common was known as \"the Victoria Branch\"<ref name = cooke>R A Cooke, ''Atlas of the Great Western Railway, 1947'', Wild Swan Publications Ltd, Didcot, 1997, {{ISBN|1 874103 38 0}}</ref> Mixed gauge was also provided to the WLER platforms on both the L&SWR and the LB&SCR sides of Clapham Junction, although it is unlikely that the LS&WR side ever carried a broad-gauge vehicle.<ref name = borley/>\n\nIn autumn 1866 the broad gauge service to Victoria was cut back to Chelsea Basin, and broad gauge passenger services ceased in 1875. The broad gauge rails were removed by 1890.<ref name = awdry>Christopher Awdry, ''Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies'', Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, {{ISBN|1-85260-049-7}}</ref>\n\nThe infrastructure at the south end may have been lavish, but the initial train service was a little more modest:\n* LNWR, three trains a day from Harrow to Kensington; and trains from Camden LNWR station to Kensington, reversing at West London Junction (there was no station at Willesden at this period);\n* LB&SCR, Kensington to New Croydon via Crystal Palace; in several cases these were through working of the LNWR trains;\n* L&SWR, Kensington to Clapham Junction; the eastwards spur towards Waterloo was not yet open.<ref name = borley/>\n\n==Further development==\n[[File:WLER 1869.gif|thumb|The West London and West London Extension Railways in 1869]]In 1869 the new much-extended Kensington (Addison Road) station opened; it is said to have had the first scissors crossovers in a station installed at that time.\n\nAddison Road became the focus of a complex pattern of services to the Cities of London and Westminster, encouraging residential housing for businessmen. Several new railway lines were built intersecting the WLR and making connections with it, and the line became home to goods terminals of the several railways making connection.\n\nAs well as the GWR service from Southall to Victoria, there was from 1 July 1864 a broad gauge service to and from the Hammersmith and City Railway via a new connection at Latimer Road; in 1872 this developed into the Middle Circle between Moorgate and Mansion House, via Baker Street, Addison Road and Earl's Court (Metropolitan District Railway). In September 1867 the LNWR started a 30-minute interval service from Broad Street to Kensington, later extended to the LBSCR Victoria station, and later still to Mansion House, forming the Outer Circle.\n\nWhen the L&SWR opened a branch north-west and then south from Kensington to Richmond via Turnham Green, it started a Richmond to Waterloo service on 1 January 1869.<ref name = white/>\n\nAt some date after 1869, the LNWR opened an extensive coal depot in sidings south of the curve to the LB&SCR side of Clapham Junction; the depot was named ''Falcon Lane''. On the inside of the curve, between it and the LB&SCR main lines, there were a small group of stabling sidings known informally as ''Pig Hill Sidings'', used for exchange of goods vehicles between the LNWR and the LB&SCR.<ref name = mitchell/>\n\n==After 1914==\nIn the nineteenth century there had been a demand for through trains from Kensington and Chelsea to all parts of the business districts; some of these routes were exceptionally circuitous and slow, and in many cases infrequent. With the rise of tube railways in the first decades of the twentieth century, frequent and more direct services became available, and changing lines was acceptable because of the frequency. At the same time electric trams offered competition, with their frequent services.\n\nThe usage of West London trains declined considerably, and the train service was reduced accordingly. The onset of the Second World War brought this decline to a head, and the LMS (as successor to the LNWR) electric services from Willesden ceased on 3 October 1940. On 20 October 1940 the steam services ended, together with the London Transport service from Edgware Road via Earls Court, and Battersea, Chelsea & Fulham and West Brompton stations were closed.\n\nOn 19 December 1946 Addison Road was renamed Kensington (Olympia) and supported a special London Transport service when public exhibitions were in progress. There was also a limited unadvertised steam service from Clapham Junction in connection with the offices of the Post Office Savings Bank. About 30 goods trains passed each way daily.\n\nAlthough the line had potential for through long distance passenger services, this never materialised except in very limited volumes.<ref name = white/>\n\nThe northern section of the line, from Willesden Junction to Kensington Olympia and on to Earls Court, was electrified by the LNWR in 1915, but passenger use of the line dwindled under competition from road transport and the London Passenger Transport Board lines, and passenger services were discontinued after bomb damage in 1940.\n\n==Electric trains==\nThe first electric trains on the route were the joint Great Western Railway and Metropolitan Railway trains, between the connection from the Hammersmith & City line near Latimer Road, and Kensington. This started at the end of 1906 on the four-rail system. The live rails continued south as far as [[Lillie Bridge Depot]].<ref name = mitchell>Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, ''West London Line: Clapham Junction to Willesden Junction'', Middleton Press, Midhurst, 1996, {{ISBN|1 873 793 84 7}}</ref>\n\nThe LNWR operated their electric train service between Willesden Junction and Earls Court from 1914.\n\nAll electric train operation ceased in 1940 due to enemy action, and only the Earls Court to Kensington (Olympia) service was resumed afterwards, in 1946.<ref name = mitchell/>\n\nCapitalstar operation brought third rail electrification throughout.\n\n==East curve at North Pole Junction==\nCobb's Atlas<ref name = cobb>Col M H Cobb, ''The Railways of Great Britain -- A Historical Atlas'', Ian Allan Publishing Limited, Shepperton, 2003, {{ISBN|07110 3003 0}}</ref> shows an east curve at North Pole Junction, apparently enabling through running from Kensington towards Paddington.

The line is shown in 1967 and is absent in 1975.<ref name = os>Ordnance Survey plans, 1:10,560, 1874, 1896 and 1967; 1:10,000 1975</ref>\n\n==Mr Punch's Railway==\nMany references assert that the WLR became known as Mr Punch's railway, due to the constant lampooning of it by the humorous periodical ''Punch''. The periodical is easily available online and it is difficult to find these claimed references, and the facts seem to be more prosaic. Arthur William \u00e0 Beckett wrote an autobiography, including his childhood at a time when his father lived in Kensington:\n\n<blockquote>Portland House, North End, Fulham, half a century ago, had some very fine pleasure grounds. To-day, if you look at it, you find it the corner house of a terrace. In its front are a number of railway lines, as it is not two hundred yards distant from the Addison Road Station, Kensington. It was proposed to start a local line which, amongst other projects, was to annex our garden. My father, to use a colloquial expression, was \"full against it,\" and did his utmost to prevent its execution. Week after week appeared attacks upon the objectionable line, until it came to be known as \"Punch's Railway.\" My father described the erection of the station and the establishment of the cabstand. According to Punch, there was so little traffic that the station-master was wont to grow cabbages\nbetween the sleepers, and train vegetable marrows along the rails. Then one cab turned up with a horse and a driver. The next day the driver disappeared, and the horse stood in his place for twelve hours. The third day the horse had disappeared with the driver. Then the horseless cab stood on the cabstand deserted for a fortnight. At the end of that time the coachman appeared without a horse and dragged away the cab single-handed. But the attacks were of no service to their author. The railway ultimately became what it now, I believe, still is, the most prosperous line in the world. If I have not been misinformed, that mile of railway in front of Portland House is leased by some of the leading English hues, and pays a dividend of enormous proportions on the original stock. My father made up\nhis mind to give up his house, and removed further East, taking up his residence in ... Hyde Park Gate.<ref>Arthur William \u00e0 Beckett, ''The \u00e0 Becketts of Punch'', 1903, reprinted by Richardson, 1969, {{ISBN|978-1115475303}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt is not possible to source any direct criticism of any named railway in ''Punch''. The West London Extension Railway had been built by the date to which the anecdote refers, and [[North End Road, Fulham|North End Road]] is somewhat to the west of the line.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group = note}}\n\n==References==\n{{commons category}}\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:1836 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:British joint railway companies]]\n[[Category:London Overground]]\n[[Category:Railway companies established in 1836]]\n[[Category:Railway lines in London]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1844]]\n[[Category:Standard gauge railways in England]]\n[[Category:Transport in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]]\n[[Category:Transport in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]]\n[[Category:Transport in the London Borough of Wandsworth]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAfter 1914:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: long distance \u2192 long-distance", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_London_Railway"}

Adapted by [[Tess Slesinger]] and [[Frank Davis (screenwriter)|Frank Davis]] from the [[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (novel)|1943 novel]] by [[Betty Smith]], the [[historical drama|period drama]] focuses on an impoverished but aspirational, second-generation Irish-American family living in the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in the early 20th century. [[Peggy Ann Garner]] received the [[Academy Juvenile Award]] for her performance as Francie Nolan, the adolescent girl at the center of the coming-of-age story. Other stars are [[Dorothy McGuire]], [[Joan Blondell]], [[Lloyd Nolan]], [[Ted Donaldson]], and [[James Dunn (actor)|James Dunn]], who received the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for his portrayal of Francie's father.\n\nThe screenplay was adapted for radio in 1949, for a musical play in 1951, and for a television film in 1974. In 2010, ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nThe film depicts several months in the life of the Nolans, an [[Irish American]] family living in the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]] in 1912. The film covers a much shorter timespan than the book, which ranges from before Francie is born until after she turns 16. The film focuses on the time when Francie is around 13 years old.\n\nKatie Nolan is a hard-working housewife who scrubs the floors of her [[apartment|tenement building]] and collects rags for sale to a scrap fabric dealer in order to provide for her family. She's married to Johnny Nolan, a happy-go-lucky, charming man who means well, but dreams his way through life, rather than find steady employment. He is also an alcoholic. On the rare occasions he finds work as a singing waiter, everything he earns usually ends up in his drinking, much to Katie's despair. The couple have two children: 13-year-old Francie, who idolizes her father; and 12-year-old Neeley. Tense and frustrated, Katie is often sharper with the children than she means to be, while Johnny is gentle, generous, and indulgent, especially with Francie.\n\n[[File:A-Tree-Grows-in-Brooklyn-LIFE-1945.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[James Dunn (actor)|James Dunn]] and [[Peggy Ann Garner]] in ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'']]\nKatie's sister, Sissy, is a sassy, free-spirited woman who has recently married for the third time. Katie learns this from gossipy insurance agent Mr. Barker when he comes by to collect the Nolans' weekly premium. Scandalized and embarrassed, Katie cuts off her relationship with Sissy, which makes the children, who love their unconventional aunt, unhappy. Francie is also worried that the building's landlord has cut too many branches off the tree in the tenement's courtyard, which Francie and her father call the [[Tree of Heaven]], and that it may die. But when she points this out to Johnny, he explains the cutting back is necessary and the tree will grow again.\n\nIn the meantime, a police officer new to the neighborhood, Officer McShane, encounters Sissy and the children one afternoon. When he meets Katie, he is enchanted. A few days later, however, he learns Johnny (drunk after an argument with his wife) is Katie's husband, and is devastated to realize Katie is married.\n\nThe children's grandmother Rommely often tells them about her immigration to the United States, and how important education is in life. While Neeley isn't interested in books and school, Francie is a bright child who is always reading, thinking about what she reads and observes, and eager to learn. One Sunday, Francie persuades her father to go for a walk and shows him a nicer school in a nearby neighborhood which she\u2019d like to attend. She helps her father write a letter to the principal requesting a transfer, and is accepted.\n\n[[File:A-Tree-Grows-in-Brooklyn.jpg|left|275px|thumb|[[Peggy Ann Garner]] and [[Ted Donaldson]] in ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'']]\n[[File:A-Tree-Grows-in-Brooklyn-LIFE-Ad-1945.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Advertisement (February 1945)]]\nMeanwhile, Katie moves the family into a smaller, cheaper apartment on the top floor, angering her husband who thinks she is being stingy. In fact, Katie is pregnant and worried how they will support another child. Sissy also becomes pregnant, and she and Katie reconcile shortly before Christmas. The families celebrate a happy, poignant Christmas together, and later that night, Katie tells Johnny she is pregnant. She suggests that Francie drop out of school to work. Since Johnny understands how much being in school means to his daughter, he feels desperate to find a job. Despite the fact that it's snowing hard, Johnny goes out determined to find work but fails to return.\n\nA week later, Officer McShane comes to the apartment to deliver the bad news that Johnny died of [[pneumonia]] while looking for work. Francie blames her mother for her father's death, but the births of Sissy's and Katie's babies help ease tensions in the household. To provide financial help, a sympathetic tavern owner, Mr. McGarrity, gives Francie and Neeley after-school jobs.\n\nDuring Katie's labor, at home because they cannot afford the hospital birth Sissy had, Francie is her mother's greatest help and comfort. Katie asks Francie to read some of her creative writing essays, and confides how much she misses Johnny. The shared experience brings mother and daughter closer. When the baby is born, a little girl, Katie names her Annie Laurie, after the song Johnny once sang to them.\n\nThe following June, both children graduate from their respective schools on the same day. Katie attends Neeley's graduation, while Sissy goes to Francie's. Using money Johnny gave her for safekeeping back in December, Sissy gives Francie a bouquet of flowers from her father, along with a congratulatory card that Johnny wrote himself. Francie, who has bottled up her grief for many months, finally breaks down.\n\nAfter the graduation ceremonies, the family reunites at the ice cream shop to celebrate. While there, some boys who know Neeley come by their table. One teenager in particular is very interested in Francie, and asks her to a movie the next day, her first date.\n\nWhen the Nolans return home, they find Officer McShane babysitting Annie Laurie together with Sissy's husband and his baby. McShane has been waiting to propose to Katie, who accepts. McShane also asks to adopt Annie Laurie and give her his last name. Francie and Neeley think Annie Laurie's life with McShane as a father will be much easier, but not nearly as much fun.\n\nThe film ends as Francie sees the courtyard tree begin to grow again, just as her father said it would.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dorothy McGuire]] as Katie Nolan\n* [[James Dunn (actor)|James Dunn]] as Johnny Nolan\n* [[Peggy Ann Garner]] as Francie Nolan\n* [[Ted Donaldson]] as Neeley Nolan\n* [[Joan Blondell]] as Aunt Sissy\n* [[John Alexander (actor)|John Alexander]] as Steve Edwards\n* [[Lloyd Nolan]] as Officer McShane\n* [[James Gleason]] as McGarrity\n* [[Ruth Nelson (actress)|Ruth Nelson]] as Miss McDonough\n* [[B.S.

[[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] acquired the rights for $55,000.<ref name=afi/> The screenplay was written by [[Tess Slesinger]] and [[Frank Davis (screenwriter)|Frank Davis]], a married couple who often worked together.<ref name=afi/> The film marked the Hollywood drama film debut of [[Elia Kazan]], who had previously achieved renown as a stage director. It was also the first Hollywood film for [[Nicholas Ray]], who was credited as a dialogue coach.<ref name=afi/>\n\nThe [[Production Code Administration]] initially refused to grant approval to the screenplay due to \"the bigamous characterization of Sissy\", who appears to be remarrying men even before her previous husbands have died.

Adapted by [[Tess Slesinger]] and [[Frank Davis (screenwriter)|Frank Davis]] from the [[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (novel)|1943 novel]] by [[Betty Smith]], the [[historical drama|period drama]] focuses on an impoverished but aspirational, second-generation Irish-American family living in the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in the early 20th century. [[Peggy Ann Garner]] received the [[Academy Juvenile Award]] for her performance as Francie Nolan, the adolescent girl at the center of the coming-of-age story. Other stars are [[Dorothy McGuire]], [[Joan Blondell]], [[Lloyd Nolan]], [[Ted Donaldson]], and [[James Dunn (actor)|James Dunn]], who received the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for his portrayal of Francie's father.\n\nThe screenplay was adapted for radio in 1949, for a musical play in 1951, and for a television film in 1974. In 2010, ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nThe film depicts several months in the life of the Nolans, an [[Irish American]] family living in the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]] in 1912. The film covers a much shorter timespan than the book, which ranges from before Francie is born until after she turns 16. The film focuses on the time when Francie is around 13 years old.\n\nKatie Nolan is a hard-working housewife who scrubs the floors of her [[apartment|tenement building]] and collects rags for sale to a scrap fabric dealer in order to provide for her family. She's married to Johnny Nolan, a happy-go-lucky, charming man who means well, but dreams his way through life, rather than find steady employment. He is also an alcoholic. On the rare occasions he finds work as a singing waiter, everything he earns usually ends up in his drinking, much to Katie's despair. The couple have two children: 13-year-old Francie, who idolizes her father; and 12-year-old Neeley. Tense and frustrated, Katie is often sharper with the children than she means to be, while Johnny is gentle, generous, and indulgent, especially with Francie.\n\n[[File:A-Tree-Grows-in-Brooklyn-LIFE-1945.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[James Dunn (actor)|James Dunn]] and [[Peggy Ann Garner]] in ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'']]\nKatie's sister, Sissy, is a sassy, free-spirited woman who has recently married for the third time. Katie learns this from gossipy insurance agent Mr. Barker when he comes by to collect the Nolans' weekly premium. Scandalized and embarrassed, Katie cuts off her relationship with Sissy, which makes the children, who love their unconventional aunt, unhappy. Francie is also worried that the building's landlord has cut too many branches off the tree in the tenement's courtyard, which Francie and her father call the [[Tree of Heaven]], and that it may die. But when she points this out to Johnny, he explains the cutting back is necessary and the tree will grow again.\n\nIn the meantime, a police officer new to the neighborhood, Officer McShane, encounters Sissy and the children one afternoon. When he meets Katie, he is enchanted. A few days later, however, he learns Johnny (drunk after an argument with his wife) is Katie's husband, and is devastated to realize Katie is married.\n\nThe children's grandmother Rommely often tells them about her immigration to the United States, and how important education is in life. While Neeley isn't interested in books and school, Francie is a bright child who is always reading, thinking about what she reads and observes, and eager to learn. One Sunday, Francie persuades her father to go for a walk and shows him a nicer school in a nearby neighborhood which she\u2019d like to attend. She helps her father write a letter to the principal requesting a transfer, and is accepted.\n\n[[File:A-Tree-Grows-in-Brooklyn.jpg|left|275px|thumb|[[Peggy Ann Garner]] and [[Ted Donaldson]] in ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'']]\n[[File:A-Tree-Grows-in-Brooklyn-LIFE-Ad-1945.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Advertisement (February 1945)]]\nMeanwhile, Katie moves the family into a smaller, cheaper apartment on the top floor, angering her husband who thinks she is being stingy. In fact, Katie is pregnant and worried how they will support another child. Sissy also becomes pregnant, and she and Katie reconcile shortly before Christmas. The families celebrate a happy, poignant Christmas together, and later that night, Katie tells Johnny she is pregnant. She suggests that Francie drop out of school to work. Since Johnny understands how much being in school means to his daughter, he feels desperate to find a job. Despite the fact that it's snowing hard, Johnny goes out determined to find work but fails to return.\n\nA week later, Officer McShane comes to the apartment to deliver the bad news that Johnny died of [[pneumonia]] while looking for work. Francie blames her mother for her father's death, but the births of Sissy's and Katie's babies help ease tensions in the household. To provide financial help, a sympathetic tavern owner, Mr. McGarrity, gives Francie and Neeley after-school jobs.\n\nDuring Katie's labor, at home because they cannot afford the hospital birth Sissy had, Francie is her mother's greatest help and comfort. Katie asks Francie to read some of her creative writing essays, and confides how much she misses Johnny. The shared experience brings mother and daughter closer. When the baby is born, a little girl, Katie names her Annie Laurie, after the song Johnny once sang to them.\n\nThe following June, both children graduate from their respective schools on the same day. Katie attends Neeley's graduation, while Sissy goes to Francie's. Using money Johnny gave her for safekeeping back in December, Sissy gives Francie a bouquet of flowers from her father, along with a congratulatory card that Johnny wrote himself. Francie, who has bottled up her grief for many months, finally breaks down.\n\nAfter the graduation ceremonies, the family reunites at the ice cream shop to celebrate. While there, some boys who know Neeley come by their table. One teenager in particular is very interested in Francie, and asks her to a movie the next day, her first date.\n\nWhen the Nolans return home, they find Officer McShane babysitting Annie Laurie together with Sissy's husband and his baby. McShane has been waiting to propose to Katie, who accepts. McShane also asks to adopt Annie Laurie and give her his last name. Francie and Neeley think Annie Laurie's life with McShane as a father will be much easier, but not nearly as much fun.\n\nThe film ends as Francie sees the courtyard tree begin to grow again, just as her father said it would.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dorothy McGuire]] as Katie Nolan\n* [[James Dunn (actor)|James Dunn]] as Johnny Nolan\n* [[Peggy Ann Garner]] as Francie Nolan\n* [[Ted Donaldson]] as Neeley Nolan\n* [[Joan Blondell]] as Aunt Sissy\n* [[John Alexander (actor)|John Alexander]] as Steve Edwards\n* [[Lloyd Nolan]] as Officer McShane\n* [[James Gleason]] as McGarrity\n* [[Ruth Nelson (actress)|Ruth Nelson]] as Miss McDonough\n* [[B.S.
