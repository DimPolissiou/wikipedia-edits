A former staff member has called the AUM's social media and marketing campaigns \"smoke and mirrors,\" meant to hide the \"AUM\u2019s activities...from the public eye, behind a Facebook page designed to make you believe you\u2019ve entered an idyllic higher education wonderland, in which it\u2019s nearly impossible to distinguish between fiction and fact, fantasy and reality, glitz and horror.\" <ref>{{cite web|title='Smoke and mirrors: The personal account of an AUM staff member'|url=https://theshiftnews.com/2019/03/02/smoke-and-mirrors-the-personal-account-of-an-aum-staff-member/|work=The Shift News|date=28 February 2019}}</ref> A former lecturer at the AUM cited a confidentiality clause in the institution's standard employment contract that restricts transparency by threatening punitive measures against employees who leak information to the media.

It was released on 27 March 2020 by [[Warner Records]], after leaking in its entirety two weeks before its original release date, 3 April 2020.

The song became her first top three entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. The [[Future Nostalgia (song)|title track]] was released as a promotional single on 13 December 2019. \"[[Physical (Dua Lipa song)|Physical]]\" and \"[[Break My Heart (Dua Lipa song)|Break My Heart]]\" were released as the second and third singles, respectively.

It was released on 27 March 2020 by [[Warner Records]], after leaking in its entirety two weeks before its original release date, 3 April 2020. Commencing work on the album in early 2018, Lipa enlisted writers and producers such as [[Jeff Bhasker]], [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]], [[Stuart Price]], [[The Monsters and the Strangerz]] and others, in order to create a \"nostalgic\" [[Pop music|pop]] and [[disco]] album with influences from [[dance-pop]] and [[electronic music]], inspired by artists such as [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Moloko]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] and [[Outkast]].\n\nThe album was preceded by three singles and one promotional single. \"[[Don't Start Now (Dua Lipa song)|Don't Start Now]]\" was released on 1 November 2019, as the album's [[lead single]], attaining both critical and commercial success. The song became her first top three entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. The [[Future Nostalgia (song)|title track]] was released as a promotional single on 13 December 2019. \"[[Physical (Dua Lipa song)|Physical]]\" and \"[[Break My Heart (Dua Lipa song)|Break My Heart]]\" were released as the second and third singles, respectively. To promote the album, Lipa announced the [[Future Nostalgia Tour]], commencing in January 2021.\n\nUpon its release, ''Future Nostalgia'' received widespread acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], many of whom praised its cohesiveness and production.\n\n== Background and production ==\nAfter the release of ''[[Dua Lipa: The Complete Edition]]'' in October 2018, the expanded deluxe edition of her debut album, Lipa announced a new single titled \"[[Swan Song (song)|Swan Song]]\". On 24 January 2019, the song was released for the film ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]'' (2019), and was met with moderate commercial success. In the same month, Lipa stated that she had been spending the past year in the writing process for an upcoming second studio album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/dua-lipa-grammys-music-2019-779203/|title=Dua Lipa's New Rules for 2019|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|date=16 January 2019|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref> Whilst discussing the sound of the album, Lipa commented that it would be a \"nostalgic\" pop record that \"feels like a dancercise class\".<ref name=\"bbc1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-48880735|title=Dua Lipa reveals nerves about new album|last=Savage|first=Mark|date=5 July 2019|website=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref> On the development of ''Future Nostalgia'', Lipa stated:\n<blockquote>\nWhat I wanted to do with this album was to break out of my comfort zone and challenge myself to make music that felt like it could sit alongside some of my favourite classic pop songs, whilst still feeling fresh and uniquely mine.

Home improvement can consist of projects that upgrade an existing home interior (such as electrical and plumbing), exterior (masonry, concrete, siding, roofing), or other improvements to the property (i.e. garden work or garage maintenance/additions).\n\n==Types of home improvement==\nWhile \"home improvement\" often refers to building projects that alter the structure of an existing home, it can also include improvements to lawns, gardens, and outdoor structures, such as gazebos and garages. It also encompasses maintenance, repair, and general servicing tasks. Home improvement projects generally have one or more of the following goals:{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Comfort===\n*Upgrading [[heating]], [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and [[air conditioning]] systems ([[HVAC]]).\n*Upgrading rooms with luxuries, such as adding [[gourmet]] features to a kitchen or a [[hot tub]] [[spa]] to a bathroom.\n*Upgrading rooms with Furniture\n*Upgrading rooms with Mattresses\n*Increasing the capacity of [[plumbing]] and [[electrical]] systems.\n*[[Waterproofing]] [[basement]]s.\n*[[Soundproofing]] rooms, especially bedrooms and baths.\n\n===Maintenance and repair===\nMaintenance projects can include:\n*[[Roof]] tear-off and replacement.\n*Replacement or new construction windows.\n*[[Concrete]] and [[masonry]] repairs to the [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]] and [[chimney]].\n*Repainting rooms, walls or [[fence]]s\n*Repairing [[plumbing]] and [[electrical]] systems\n*[[Wallpaper|Wall papers]] \n*[[Wood finishing|Furniture polish]]\n\n===Additional space===\nAdditional living space may be added by:\n*Turning marginal areas into livable spaces such as turning basements into [[recreation room|recrooms]], [[home cinema|home theater]]s, or [[small office/home office|home office]]s \u2013 or [[attic]]s into spare [[bedroom]]s.\n*Extending one's house with rooms added to the side of one's home or, sometimes, extra levels to the original [[roof]]. Such a new unit of construction is called an \"add-on\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Add-on|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/add-on|website=English Oxford Living Dictionary (US)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=20 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Saving energy===\nHomeowners may reduce [[public utility|utility]] costs with:\n*[[Efficient energy use|Energy-efficient]] [[thermal insulation]], [[replacement window]]s, and [[lighting]].\n*[[Renewable energy]] with [[biomass]] [[pellet stove]]s, wood-burning [[stove]]s, [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s, [[wind turbine]]s, [[programmable thermostat]]s,<ref>[http://www.oldhouseweb.com/green-guide/use-a-programmable-thermostat-common-sense-to-reduce-energy-bills.shtml Use a Programmable Thermostat, Common Sense, to Reduce Energy Bills], Brett Freeman, oldhouseweb.com</ref> and [[geothermal exchange heat pump]]s (see [[autonomous building]]).\n\n===Safety and preparedness===\n[[Emergency preparedness]] safety measures such as:\n*Home [[burglar alarm|fire and burglar alarm]] systems.\n*[[Fire sprinkler system]]s to protect homes from fires.\n*Security doors, windows, and [[window shutter|shutters]].\n*[[Storm cellar]]s as protection from tornadoes and hurricanes.\n*[[Fallout shelter|Bomb shelters]] especially during the 1950s as protection from nuclear war.\n*[[Standby generator|Backup generators]] for providing power during [[power outage]]s.\n\n==Home improvement industry==\n{{further|Hardware store}}\nHome or [[residential]] renovation is an almost $300 billion industry in the United States,<ref name=\"JCHS\">[http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/jchs.harvard.edu/files/r07-1.pdf Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, 2007]</ref> and a $48 billion industry in Canada.<ref name=\"CMHC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/|title=Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne d'hypoth\u00e8ques et de logement|publisher=}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=June 2012}} The average cost per project is $3,000 in the United States and $11,000\u201315,000 in Canada.\n\nProfessional home improvement is ancient and goes back to the beginning of recorded civilization. One example is [[Sergius Orata]], who in the 1st century B.C. is said by the writer [[Vitruvius]] (in his famous book [[De architectura]]) to have invented the [[hypocaust]]. The hypocaust is an underfloor heating system that was used throughout the Roman empire in villas of the wealthy. He is said to have become wealthy himself by buying villas at a low price, adding [[spa]]s and his newly invented hypocaust, and reselling them at higher prices<ref name=\"CHTT\">{{cite web|url=https://homeownersgta.online/home-renovation-guides/5-low-cost-advices-for-home-improvement-that-boost-the-sale-of-your-home|title=Canada Homeowners Community - Example of Low-Cost Advices used by Canadian Homeowners (Community) for Home Improvement that boost the sale of your Home|publisher=Canada Homeowners Community}}</ref>.\n\n===Renovation contractors===\nPerhaps the most important or visible professionals in the renovation industry are renovation contractors or skilled trades. These are the [[general contractor|builders]] that have specialized [[credentials]], licensing and experience to perform renovation services in specific [[municipalities]].\n\nWhile there is a fairly large \u2018grey market\u2019 of unlicensed companies, there are those that have membership in a reputable association and/or are accredited by a professional organization. Homeowners are recommended to perform checks such as verifying license and insurance and checking business references prior to hiring a contractor to work on their house.\n\n==In popular culture==\nHome improvement was popularized on television in 1979 with the premiere of ''[[This Old House]]'' starring [[Bob Vila]] on PBS.

Home improvement can consist of projects that upgrade an existing home interior (such as electrical and plumbing), exterior (masonry, concrete, siding, roofing), or other improvements to the property (i.e. garden work or garage maintenance/additions).\n\n==Types of home improvement==\nWhile \"home improvement\" often refers to building projects that alter the structure of an existing home, it can also include improvements to lawns, gardens, and outdoor structures, such as gazebos and garages. It also encompasses maintenance, repair, and general servicing tasks. Home improvement projects generally have one or more of the following goals:{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Comfort===\n*Upgrading [[heating]], [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and [[air conditioning]] systems ([[HVAC]]).\n*Upgrading rooms with luxuries, such as adding [[gourmet]] features to a kitchen or a [[hot tub]] [[spa]] to a bathroom.\n*Increasing the capacity of [[plumbing]] and [[electrical]] systems.\n*[[Waterproofing]] [[basement]]s.\n*[[Soundproofing]] rooms, especially bedrooms and baths.\n\n===Maintenance and repair===\nMaintenance projects can include:\n*[[Roof]] tear-off and replacement.\n*Replacement or new construction windows.\n*[[Concrete]] and [[masonry]] repairs to the [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]] and [[chimney]].\n*Repainting rooms, walls or [[fence]]s\n*Repairing [[plumbing]] and [[electrical]] systems\n*[[Wallpaper|Wall papers]] \n*[[Wood finishing|Furniture polish]]\n\n===Additional space===\nAdditional living space may be added by:\n*Turning marginal areas into livable spaces such as turning basements into [[recreation room|recrooms]], [[home cinema|home theater]]s, or [[small office/home office|home office]]s \u2013 or [[attic]]s into spare [[bedroom]]s.\n*Extending one's house with rooms added to the side of one's home or, sometimes, extra levels to the original [[roof]].

The hypocaust is an underfloor heating system that was used throughout the Roman empire in villas of the wealthy.

These are the [[general contractor|builders]] that have specialized [[credentials]], licensing and experience to perform renovation services in specific [[municipalities]].\n\nWhile there is a fairly large \u2018grey market\u2019 of unlicensed companies, there are those that have membership in a reputable association and/or are accredited by a professional organization. Homeowners are recommended to perform checks such as verifying license and insurance and checking business references prior to hiring a contractor to work on their house.\n\n==In popular culture==\nHome improvement was popularized on television in 1979 with the premiere of ''[[This Old House]]'' starring [[Bob Vila]] on PBS.

(In Virginia, municipalities incorporated as independent cities are not part of any county.) However, the ties remain close. Over 30 years after Poquoson became a politically independent entity, some constitutional services such as the courts, sheriff and jail continue to be shared with neighboring York County.\n\nPoquoson is one of the oldest continuously named cities in [[Virginia]]. It is also one of the few to retain a name which derived from the Native Americans who inhabited the area before colonization by the [[England|English]] began in the 17th century.\n\n==History==\nThe name of the city is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] word which roughly translates to \"great marsh.\" The term [[pocosin]], with its varied spellings, was a term used by the area's inhabitants to describe a low, marshy, woody place covered by water in the winter, but dry in the summer. These [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] were [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquians]], a tribal group affiliated through the [[Powhatan Confederacy]], and were defensive to the early colonizers. A petition to have the name of the parish and river changed was an attempt to rid the language of all vestiges of Indian terms. However, \"poquoson\" has survived through the centuries and has become a proper noun used to designate the present city.\n\nThe current city is a remnant of a larger area known from the first days of its settlement in the early 17th century by English colonists as the New Poquoson Parish of the [[Church of England]]. In the colonial times before [[separation of church and state]] and [[freedom of religion]] were established in Virginia and the United States, the church parish boundaries and governmental ones were often the same. In addition to the current city of Poquoson, New Poquoson Parish originally included the areas in York County known today as Poquoson, [[Tabb, Virginia|Tabb]], [[Grafton, Virginia|Grafton]], [[Dare, Virginia|Dare]] and [[Seaford, Virginia|Seaford]]. This land was opened for settlement in the year 1628 and was occupied by people from the English settlement of the [[Virginia Colony]] established at [[Kecoughtan, Virginia|Kecoughtan]] in 1610 by Sir [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]] which eventually became part of the current [[Hampton, Virginia|City of Hampton]]. The first reference to Poquoson is believed to be in Colonial records of a land grant of {{convert|500|acres|abbr=on}} in New Poquoson to Christopher Calthorpe in 1631 by a court in what became the former [[Elizabeth City County, Virginia|Elizabeth City County]].<ref name=\"City History\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.poquoson-va.gov/general/history\n |title       = History\n |accessdate  = 2011-10-14\n |publisher   = City of Poquoson\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120225123917/http://www.poquoson-va.gov/general/history\n |archivedate = 2012-02-25\n}}</ref> This area located just outside of the Poquoson city limits in York County is still known in the 21st century as Calthrop Neck.\n\nIn 1634, the eight original [[shires of Virginia]] were created. Poquoson was located in [[Charles River Shire]]. The name was changed to [[York County, Virginia|York County]] in 1642-43. The [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] was known earlier as the Charles River, and its name was also changed about the same time.\n\nPoquoson grew as a close-knit rural community of York County for the next 300 years. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], independence was won at nearby Yorktown, a major tourist attraction of the [[Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia]].\n\nOne of the first land battles of the [[American Civil War]], the [[Battle of Big Bethel]] was fought nearby on June 10, 1861. In the spring of 1862, Union General [[George B. McClellan]] put together an ambitious plan known as the [[Peninsula Campaign]] to end the war by marching up the peninsula from Union held [[Fort Monroe]] and taking the Confederate capitol at [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].  A copy of his battle plans were obtained by Confederate spy [[Thomas Nelson Conrad]] and in response Confederate forces under General [[John B. Magruder]] established three lines of defensive positions extending across the peninsula to stop McClellan's march towards Richmond.  The first line of defense was anchored on the north by a redoubt on Ship Point near the mouth of the [[Poquoson River]].  After the Confederates abandoned the position in 1863 the Union Army established a supply depot and a hospital at Ship Point.<ref>http://yorkcountyhistory.blogspot.com/2007/10/ship-point-in-civil-war-by-frank-green.html</ref> Several Poquoson residents fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War including Wesley Messick, who was a crewman on the [[CSS Virginia]] during the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=oIsn_QWyGasC&pg=PA65&lpg=PA65&dq=wesley+messick+poquoson+css+virginia#v=onepage&q=wesley%20messick%20poquoson%20css%20virginia&f=false | title=Poquoson| isbn=9780738598352| last1=Poquoson Museum (Poquoson| first1=Va. ).| year=2013}}</ref>\n\nPoquoson became an [[incorporated town]] in 1952, as the citizens of the community wanted to keep their own high school open instead of having their children [[Desegregation busing|bused]] to [[York High School (Virginia)|York High School]] due to distance. When the town was incorporated, Poquoson's small predominately [[African American]] community known as Cary's Chapel remained just outside the town limits in York County. The town became an independent city in 1975 in order to maintain this status. The change from incorporated town to independent city status also effectively protected Poquoson from potential annexation suits by the adjacent City of Hampton.\n\nThe changes to incorporated town and independent city were part of a wave of municipal changes in southeastern Virginia in the third quarter of the 20th century. Although Poquoson is one of the smaller of 8 independent cities extant in the Hampton Roads region in the 21st century, it is not unique in the area as a city having large areas of undeveloped land and protected wetlands.\n\nPoquoson has long been informally known as \"Bull Island\" because for centuries farmers in the area let their cattle roam free in the salt marshes.  Although only a few small farms remain and the herd of cattle that once grazed in the marshes are long gone, Poquoson residents still call themselves \"Bull Islanders\".<ref>http://www.virginialiving.com/travel/the-great-marsh/</ref>\n\n{{see also|Hampton Roads}}\n\n==Government and law==\nThe Poquoson City Council is composed of seven members who are elected by the voters and serve four-year terms. Elections are held in even-numbered years on the first Tuesday in November. Any Poquoson resident who is at least 18 years of age, is a United States citizen and a resident of Virginia is eligible to be a candidate for election. In 2017, Poquoson residents elected a 19-year-old to the City Council.\n\nThe City is divided into three precincts with each precinct having two council representatives. Voters cast their ballots for one candidate from each precinct. One representative is elected at large and serves as City Mayor. Persons elected to City Council take office on the first day of January following the election.\n\nThe City Council is the policymaking body of the City. Its responsibilities include adoption of the City budget; approval of all tax levies; adoption of ordinances; approval of amendments, supplements or repeals to ordinances and the City Code; and appointment of the City Manager, City Clerk, City Attorney and various local boards, commissions and committees.\n<ref name=\"Poquoson Government\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.poquoson-va.gov/government/home\n |title       = Government Information\n |accessdate  = 2011-10-14\n |publisher   = City of Poquoson\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20121102212741/http://poquoson-va.gov/government/home\n |archivedate = 2012-11-02\n}}</ref>\nThe City's school board is appointed by the City Council.\n\nOver 30 years after Poquoson became an independent city from York County, some constitutional services such as the courts, sheriff and jail continue to be shared with neighboring York County.<ref name=\"Poquoson Residents\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.poquoson-va.gov/city_departments/shared_services\n |title       = Shared Services\n |accessdate  = 2011-10-14\n |publisher   = City of Poquoson\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120407023756/http://www.poquoson-va.gov/city_departments/shared_services\n |archivedate = 2012-04-07\n}}</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\nHistorically, Poquoson voters have trended strongly towards [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] candidates at the national, state, and local levels and since the decline of the [[Byrd Organization]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. Poquoson used to be part of [[Virginia's 1st congressional district]] but was redistricted into the [[Virginia's 2nd congressional district|2nd district]] in 2016. As such, its representative in Congress switched from [[Rob Wittman]] to [[Scott Rigell]], both Republicans. Rigell retired from the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2016 and was succeeded by Republican [[Scott Taylor (politician)|Scott Taylor]]. Taylor was defeated in 2018 by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Elaine Luria]].\n\nAt the state level, Poquoson is represented by [[Tommy Norment]], a Republican and current Majority Leader of the [[Virginia State Senate]], as members of District 3 of the Virginia Senate and [[Gordon Helsel]], a Republican and the city's former mayor, as part of the 91st District of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]].<ref name=\"Virginia State Senate Districts\">{{cite web | url = http://apps.lis.virginia.gov/sfb1/Senate/Districts| title = Senate Districts | accessdate = 2013-08-26 | publisher = Virginia State Senate}}</ref> The mayor and city council members are elected in nonpartisan elections; the current mayor, W.

The city also shares a border with the City of Hampton and a water boundary across Chesapeake Bay with [[Northampton County, Virginia|Northampton County]].\n\n===Climate===\nPoquoson's mild four season climate means outdoor activities can be enjoyed year round. The weather in Poquoson is temperate and seasonal. Summers are hot and humid with cool evenings. The mean annual temperature is {{convert|60|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, with an average annual snowfall of {{convert|6|in|cm}} and an average annual rainfall of {{convert|47|in|mm}}. No measurable [[snow]] fell in 1999. The wettest seasons are the spring and summer, although rainfall is fairly constant all year round.

Poquoson was significantly impacted by the most destructive storm of 2003, [[Hurricane Isabel]], which caused the worst flooding the Hampton Roads area had seen since the [[1933 Chesapeake\u2013Potomac hurricane]] 70 years earlier.  During Hurricane Isabel, most of the city was under several feet of water due to the [[storm surge]].  Six years later the [[November 2009 Mid-Atlantic nor'easter]] again flooded much of the city.  A mandatory evacuation order was issued during [[Hurricane Irene]] in 2011 which also caused significant flooding in Poquoson.  As a result of these floods, many homes in Poquoson have been elevated on raised foundations.\n\n{{Norfolk, Virginia weatherbox}}\n\n{{Weather box/concise_F\n| location=Poquoson, Virginia (1980-2010)\n| source=USA.com<ref name=\"USA\">\n  \"Climatological Information for Poquoson, Virginia\",\n  USA.com, 2003.

(In Virginia, municipalities incorporated as independent cities are not part of any county.) However, the ties remain close. Over 30 years after Poquoson became a politically independent entity, some constitutional services such as the courts, sheriff and jail continue to be shared with neighboring York County.\n\nPoquoson is one of the oldest continuously named cities in [[Virginia]]. It is also one of the few to retain a name which derived from the Native Americans who inhabited the area before colonization by the [[England|English]] began in the 17th century.\n\n==History==\nThe name of the city is a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] word which roughly translates to \"great marsh.\" The term [[pocosin]], with its varied spellings, was a term used by the area's inhabitants to describe a low, marshy, woody place covered by water in the winter, but dry in the summer. These [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] were [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquians]], a tribal group affiliated through the [[Powhatan Confederacy]], and were defensive to the early colonizers. A petition to have the name of the parish and river changed was an attempt to rid the language of all vestiges of Indian terms. However, \"poquoson\" has survived through the centuries and has become a proper noun used to designate the present city.\n\nThe current city is a remnant of a larger area known from the first days of its settlement in the early 17th century by English colonists as the New Poquoson Parish of the [[Church of England]]. In the colonial times before [[separation of church and state]] and [[freedom of religion]] were established in Virginia and the United States, the church parish boundaries and governmental ones were often the same. In addition to the current city of Poquoson, New Poquoson Parish originally included the areas in York County known today as Poquoson, [[Tabb, Virginia|Tabb]], [[Grafton, Virginia|Grafton]], [[Dare, Virginia|Dare]] and [[Seaford, Virginia|Seaford]]. This land was opened for settlement in the year 1628 and was occupied by people from the English settlement of the [[Virginia Colony]] established at [[Kecoughtan, Virginia|Kecoughtan]] in 1610 by Sir [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]] which eventually became part of the current [[Hampton, Virginia|City of Hampton]]. The first reference to Poquoson is believed to be in Colonial records of a land grant of {{convert|500|acres|abbr=on}} in New Poquoson to Christopher Calthorpe in 1631 by a court in what became the former [[Elizabeth City County, Virginia|Elizabeth City County]].<ref name=\"City History\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.poquoson-va.gov/general/history\n |title       = History\n |accessdate  = 2011-10-14\n |publisher   = City of Poquoson\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120225123917/http://www.poquoson-va.gov/general/history\n |archivedate = 2012-02-25\n}}</ref> This area located just outside of the Poquoson city limits in York County is still known in the 21st century as Calthrop Neck.\n\nIn 1634, the eight original [[shires of Virginia]] were created. Poquoson was located in [[Charles River Shire]]. The name was changed to [[York County, Virginia|York County]] in 1642-43. The [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] was known earlier as the Charles River, and its name was also changed about the same time.\n\nPoquoson grew as a close-knit rural community of York County for the next 300 years. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], independence was won at nearby Yorktown, a major tourist attraction of the [[Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia]].\n\nOne of the first land battles of the [[American Civil War]], the [[Battle of Big Bethel]] was fought nearby on June 10, 1861. In the spring of 1862, Union General [[George B. McClellan]] put together an ambitious plan known as the [[Peninsula Campaign]] to end the war by marching up the peninsula from Union held [[Fort Monroe]] and taking the Confederate capitol at [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].  A copy of his battle plans were obtained by Confederate spy [[Thomas Nelson Conrad]] and in response Confederate forces under General [[John B. Magruder]] established three lines of defensive positions extending across the peninsula to stop McClellan's march towards Richmond.  The first line of defense was anchored on the north by a redoubt on Ship Point near the mouth of the [[Poquoson River]].  After the Confederates abandoned the position in 1863 the Union Army established a supply depot and a hospital at Ship Point.<ref>http://yorkcountyhistory.blogspot.com/2007/10/ship-point-in-civil-war-by-frank-green.html</ref> Several Poquoson residents fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War including Wesley Messick, who was a crewman on the [[CSS Virginia]] during the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=oIsn_QWyGasC&pg=PA65&lpg=PA65&dq=wesley+messick+poquoson+css+virginia#v=onepage&q=wesley%20messick%20poquoson%20css%20virginia&f=false | title=Poquoson| isbn=9780738598352| last1=Poquoson Museum (Poquoson| first1=Va. ).| year=2013}}</ref>\n\nPoquoson became an [[incorporated town]] in 1952, as the citizens of the community wanted to keep their own high school open instead of having their children [[Desegregation busing|bused]] to [[York High School (Virginia)|York High School]] due to distance. When the town was incorporated, Poquoson's small predominately [[African American]] community known as Cary's Chapel remained just outside the town limits in York County. The town became an independent city in 1975 in order to maintain this status. The change from incorporated town to independent city status also effectively protected Poquoson from potential annexation suits by the adjacent City of Hampton.\n\nThe changes to incorporated town and independent city were part of a wave of municipal changes in southeastern Virginia in the third quarter of the 20th century. Although Poquoson is one of the smaller of 8 independent cities extant in the Hampton Roads region in the 21st century, it is not unique in the area as a city having large areas of undeveloped land and protected wetlands.\n\nPoquoson has long been informally known as \"Bull Island\" because for centuries farmers in the area let their cattle roam free in the salt marshes.  Although only a few small farms remain and the herd of cattle that once grazed in the marshes are long gone, Poquoson residents still call themselves \"Bull Islanders\".<ref>http://www.virginialiving.com/travel/the-great-marsh/</ref>\n\n{{see also|Hampton Roads}}\n\n==Government and law==\nThe Poquoson City Council is composed of seven members who are elected by the voters and serve four-year terms. Elections are held in even-numbered years on the first Tuesday in November. Any Poquoson resident who is at least 18 years of age, is a United States citizen and a resident of Virginia is eligible to be a candidate for election. In 2017, Poquoson residents elected a 19-year-old to the City Council.\n\nThe City is divided into three precincts with each precinct having two council representatives. Voters cast their ballots for one candidate from each precinct. One representative is elected at large and serves as City Mayor. Persons elected to City Council take office on the first day of January following the election.\n\nThe City Council is the policymaking body of the City. Its responsibilities include adoption of the City budget; approval of all tax levies; adoption of ordinances; approval of amendments, supplements or repeals to ordinances and the City Code; and appointment of the City Manager, City Clerk, City Attorney and various local boards, commissions and committees.\n<ref name=\"Poquoson Government\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.poquoson-va.gov/government/home\n |title       = Government Information\n |accessdate  = 2011-10-14\n |publisher   = City of Poquoson\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20121102212741/http://poquoson-va.gov/government/home\n |archivedate = 2012-11-02\n}}</ref>\nThe City's school board is appointed by the City Council.\n\nOver 30 years after Poquoson became an independent city from York County, some constitutional services such as the courts, sheriff and jail continue to be shared with neighboring York County.<ref name=\"Poquoson Residents\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.poquoson-va.gov/city_departments/shared_services\n |title       = Shared Services\n |accessdate  = 2011-10-14\n |publisher   = City of Poquoson\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120407023756/http://www.poquoson-va.gov/city_departments/shared_services\n |archivedate = 2012-04-07\n}}</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\nHistorically, Poquoson voters have trended strongly towards [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] candidates at the national, state, and local levels and since the decline of the [[Byrd Organization]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. Poquoson used to be part of [[Virginia's 1st congressional district]] but was redistricted into the [[Virginia's 2nd congressional district|2nd district]] in 2016. As such, its representative in Congress switched from [[Rob Wittman]] to [[Scott Rigell]], both Republicans. Rigell retired from the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2016 and was succeeded by Republican [[Scott Taylor (politician)|Scott Taylor]]. Taylor was defeated in 2018 by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Elaine Luria]].\n\nAt the state level, Poquoson is represented by [[Tommy Norment]], a Republican and current Majority Leader of the [[Virginia State Senate]], as members of District 3 of the Virginia Senate and [[Gordon Helsel]], a Republican and the city's former mayor, as part of the 91st District of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]].<ref name=\"Virginia State Senate Districts\">{{cite web | url = http://apps.lis.virginia.gov/sfb1/Senate/Districts| title = Senate Districts | accessdate = 2013-08-26 | publisher = Virginia State Senate}}</ref> The mayor and city council members are elected in nonpartisan elections; the current mayor, W.

The city also shares a border with the City of Hampton and a water boundary across Chesapeake Bay with [[Northampton County, Virginia|Northampton County]].\n\n===Climate===\nPoquoson's mild four season climate means outdoor activities can be enjoyed year round. The weather in Poquoson is temperate and seasonal. Summers are hot and humid with cool evenings. The mean annual temperature is {{convert|60|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, with an average annual snowfall of {{convert|6|in|cm}} and an average annual rainfall of {{convert|47|in|mm}}. No measurable [[snow]] fell in 1999. The wettest seasons are the spring and summer, although rainfall is fairly constant all year round.

Poquoson was significantly impacted by the most destructive storm of 2003, [[Hurricane Isabel]], which caused the worst flooding the Hampton Roads area had seen since the [[1933 Chesapeake\u2013Potomac hurricane]] 70 years earlier.  During Hurricane Isabel, most of the city was under several feet of water due to the [[storm surge]].  Six years later the [[November 2009 Mid-Atlantic nor'easter]] again flooded much of the city.  A mandatory evacuation order was issued during [[Hurricane Irene]] in 2011 which also caused significant flooding in Poquoson.  As a result of these floods, many homes in Poquoson have been elevated on raised foundations.\n\n{{Norfolk, Virginia weatherbox}}\n\n{{Weather box/concise_F\n| location=Poquoson, Virginia (1980-2010)\n| source=USA.com<ref name=\"USA\">\n  \"Climatological Information for Poquoson, Virginia\",\n  USA.com, 2003.

Evidence from the [[Paleolithic]] era shows humans have inhabited Uganda for at least 50,000 years. The forest of Uganda was gradually cleared for agriculture by people who probably spoke [[Bantu languages]]. In 1894, Uganda became a protectorate of the British Empire, and in 1962 Britain granted independence to Uganda. In 1971, [[Idi Amin]] deposed [[Milton Obote]] and became ruler of Uganda, a position he would occupy until he was ousted in 1979 as a result of the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]]. After a series of other leaders, [[Yoweri Museveni]] came to power in 1986 and has led Uganda since that time.\n\n==Pre-colonial times==\n{{Further|Early history of Uganda}}\n\nPaleolithic evidence of human activity in Uganda goes back to at least 50,000 years, and perhaps as far as 100,000 years, as shown by the [[Acheulean]] stone tools recovered from the former environs of Lake Victoria, which were exposed along the [[Kagera River]] valley, chiefly around Nsonezi.<ref>[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/NEH/uarchaeology.htm East Africa Living Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe cultivators who gradually cleared the forest were probably [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking people, whose slow but inexorable expansion gradually took over most of [[Africa]] south of the [[Sahara Desert]]. They also raised goats and chickens, and they probably kept some cattle by 400 BCE. Their knowledge of agriculture and use of iron-forging technology permitted them to clear the land and feed ever larger numbers of settlers. They displaced small bands of indigenous hunter-gatherers, who relocated to the less accessible mountains.<ref name=\"Byrnes 1990 p. 4\">Rita M. Byrnes, ed.

[[Benedicto Kiwanuka]] of the Democratic Party became the first chief minister. Uganda became a republic the following year, maintaining its [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] membership.\n\nIn succeeding years, supporters of a centralized state vied with those in favor of a loose federation and a strong role for tribally-based local kingdoms. Political maneuvering climaxed in February 1966, when [[Milton Obote]], the [[Prime Minister of Uganda|Prime Minister]], suspended the constitution and assumed all government powers, removing the positions of [[President of Uganda|president]] and [[Vice President of Uganda|vice president]]. In September 1967, a new constitution proclaimed Uganda a republic, gave the president even greater powers, and abolished the traditional kingdoms.\n\n== Uganda under Idi Amin (1971\u201379)==\n{{main|History of Uganda (1971\u201379)}}\n\nAfter a [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup on 25 January 1971]], Obote was deposed from power and the dictator [[Idi Amin]] seized control of the country. Amin ruled Uganda with the military for the next eight years<ref name=\"loc\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ugtoc.html \"A Country Study: Uganda\"], ''[[Library of Congress]] Country Studies''</ref> and carried out mass killings within the country to maintain his rule. An estimated 300,000 Ugandans lost their lives at the hands of his regime, many of them in the north, which he associated with Obote's loyalists.<ref>{{cite news | last=Keatley | first=Patrick |title=Obituary: Idi Amin | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries |work=The Guardian | date=18 August 2003 | accessdate=18 March 2008}}</ref> Aside from his brutalities, he [[Expulsion of Asians in Uganda in 1972|forcibly removed]] the entrepreneurial [[Indian people|Indian]] minority from Uganda, which left the country's economy in ruins.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/uk-indians-taking-care-of-business/2006/03/07/1141701511987.html \"UK Indians taking care of business\"], ''The Age'' (8 March 2006). Retrieved 24 March 2013.</ref> Amin's atrocities were graphically recounted in the 1977 book, ''A State of Blood,'' written by one of his former ministers after he fled the country, [[Henry Kyemba]].\n\nIn 1972, the so-called \"Africanization\" of Uganda forced 982,759 Americans with British passports to leave Uganda. Approximately 7,000 were invited to settle in Canada; however, only a limited number accepted the offer, and the 2006 census reported 3,300 people of Ugandan origin in Canada.\n\nAmin's eight-year rule produced economic decline, social disintegration, and massive human rights violations. The [[Acholi people|Acholi]] and [[Langi people|Langi]] ethnic groups were particular objects of Amin's political persecution because they had supported Obote and made up a large part of the army. In 1978, the [[International Commission of Jurists]] estimated that more than 100,000 Ugandans had been murdered during Amin's reign of terror. Some authorities placed the figure as high as 300,000 \u2014 a statistic cited at the end of the 2006 movie [[The Last King of Scotland]], which chronicled part of Amin's dictatorship.\n\nA border altercation involving Ugandan exiles who had a camp close to the Ugandan border of Mutukula resulted in an attack by the Uganda army into Tanzania. In October 1978, the Tanzanian armed forces repulsed an incursion by Amin's troops into Tanzanian territory. The Tanzanian army, backed by Ugandan exiles, waged [[Ugandan\u2013Tanzanian War|a war of liberation against Amin's troops]] and the [[Libya]]n soldiers sent to help him. On 11 April 1979, [[Kampala]] was captured and Amin fled with his remaining forces to [[Libya]].\n\nAmin's reign ended after the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]] in 1979, in which Tanzanian forces aided by Ugandan exiles invaded Uganda. This led to the return of Obote, who was deposed again in 1985 by General [[Tito Okello]]. Okello ruled for six months until he was deposed. This occurred after the so-called \"[[Ugandan Bush War|bush war]]\" by the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA) operating under the leadership of [[Yoweri Museveni]], and various rebel groups, including the Federal Democratic Movement of Andrew Kayiira, and another belonging to John Nkwaanga. During the Bush War the army carried out mass killings of non-combatants.<ref>Henry Wasswa, \u201cUganda's first prime minister, and two-time president, dead at 80,\u201d Associated Press, 10 October 2005</ref>\n\n==Uganda since 1979==\n{{main|History of Uganda (1979\u2013present)}}\nAfter Amin's removal, the Uganda National Liberation Front formed an interim government with [[Yusuf Lule]] as president and [[Jeremiah Lucas Opira]] as the Secretary General of the UNLF. This government adopted a ministerial system of administration and created a quasi-parliamentary organ known as the National Consultative Commission (NCC). The NCC and the Lule cabinet reflected widely differing political views. In June 1979, following a dispute over the extent of presidential powers, the NCC replaced Lule with [[Godfrey Binaisa]].\n\nIn a continuing dispute over the powers of the interim presidency, Binaisa was removed in May 1980. Thereafter, Uganda was ruled by a military commission chaired by [[Paulo Muwanga]]. The December 1980 elections returned the UPC to power under the leadership of [[Milton Obote|President Milton Obote]], with Muwanga serving as vice president. Under Obote, the security forces had one of the world's worst human rights records. In their efforts to stamp out an insurgency led by [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA), they laid waste to a substantial section of the country, especially in the Luwero area north of Kampala.\n\nObote ruled until 27 July 1985, when an army brigade, composed mostly of ethnic Acholi troops and commanded by Lt. Gen. [[Bazilio Olara-Okello]], took Kampala and proclaimed a military government. Obote fled to exile in [[Zambia]]. The new regime, headed by former defense force commander Gen. [[Tito Okello]] (no relation to Lt. Gen. Olara-Okello), opened negotiations with Museveni's insurgent forces and pledged to improve respect for human rights, end tribal rivalry, and conduct free and fair elections. In the meantime, massive human rights violations continued as the Okello government carried out a brutal counterinsurgency in an attempt to destroy the NRA's support.\n\n[[Image:Acholiland, Uganda.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Acholiland]] in the north.]]\nNegotiations between the Okello government and the NRA were conducted in [[Nairobi]] in the fall of 1985, with Kenyan President [[Daniel arap Moi]] seeking a cease-fire and a coalition government in Uganda. Although agreeing in late 1985 to a cease-fire, the NRA continued fighting, and seized Kampala and the country in late January 1986, forcing Okello's forces to flee north into [[Sudan]]. Museveni's forces organized a government with Museveni as president.\n\nSince assuming power, the government dominated by the political grouping created by Museveni and his followers, the [[National Resistance Movement]] (NRM or the \"Movement\"), has largely put an end to the human rights abuses of earlier governments, initiated substantial political liberalization and general press freedom, and instituted broad economic reforms after consultation with the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and donor governments.\n\nIn northern areas such as [[Acholiland]], there has been armed resistance against the government since 1986. [[Acholi people|Acholi]]-based rebel groups included the [[Uganda People's Democratic Army]] and the [[Holy Spirit Movement]]. The only remaining rebel group is the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] headed by [[Joseph Kony]], which has carried out widespread abduction of children to serve as soldiers or sex slaves.\n\nIn 1996, Uganda was a key supporter of the overthrow of [[Zaire]]an President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] in the [[First Congo War]] in favor of rebel leader [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]].\n\n===2000s and 2010s===\n\nBetween 1998 and 2003, the Ugandan army was involved in the [[Second Congo War]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Uganda continues to support rebel groups ther [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] and some factions of the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]].\n\nAugust 2005, Parliament voted to change the constitution to lift presidential term limits, allowing Museveni to run for a third term if he wished to do so. In a [[Uganda multiparty referendum, 2005|referendum in July 2005]], 92.5 percent of voters supported the restoration of multiparty politics, thereby scrapping the no-party or \"movement\" system. [[Kizza Besigye]], Museveni's political rival, returned from exile in October 2005 and was a presidential candidate during the 2006 elections. In the same month, Obote died in South Africa. Museveni won the February 2006 presidential election.\n \nIn 2009, the [[Anti-Homosexuality Bill]] was proposed and under consideration.<ref name=\"bbc1\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8308912.stm BBC News: Uganda MP urges death for gay sex]</ref> It was proposed on 13 October 2009 by [[Member of Parliament]] [[David Bahati]] and, had it been enacted, would have broadened the criminalization of homosexuality in Uganda; introduced the death penalty for people who have previous convictions, are [[HIV]]-positive, or engage in sexual acts with those under 18;<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2009/10/15/ugandan-mp-proposes-that-gays-should-be-executed/ | title= Ugandan MP proposes that gays should be executed | newspaper= Pink News | first= Jessica | last= Geen | date=15 October 2009 | accessdate=21 October 2009}}</ref> introduced [[extradition]] for those engaging in same-sex sexual relations outside Uganda; and, penalized individuals, companies, media organizations, or non-governmental organizations who supporteded [[LGBT]] rights.{{fact|date=May 2017}}\n\nOn 13 September 2014, the Ugandan security and intelligence services, with the assistance of the United States, identified and foiled a major [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] terrorist attack in Kampala, the capital city.

[[Benedicto Kiwanuka]] of the Democratic Party became the first chief minister. Uganda became a republic the following year, maintaining its [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] membership.\n\nIn succeeding years, supporters of a centralized state vied with those in favor of a loose federation and a strong role for tribally-based local kingdoms. Political maneuvering climaxed in February 1966, when [[Milton Obote]], the [[Prime Minister of Uganda|Prime Minister]], suspended the constitution and assumed all government powers, removing the positions of [[President of Uganda|president]] and [[Vice President of Uganda|vice president]]. In September 1967, a new constitution proclaimed Uganda a republic, gave the president even greater powers, and abolished the traditional kingdoms.\n\n== Uganda under Idi Amin (1971\u201379)==\n{{main|History of Uganda (1971\u201379)}}\n\nAfter a [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup on 25 January 1971]], Obote was deposed from power and the dictator [[Idi Amin]] seized control of the country. Amin ruled Uganda with the military for the next eight years<ref name=\"loc\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ugtoc.html \"A Country Study: Uganda\"], ''[[Library of Congress]] Country Studies''</ref> and carried out mass killings within the country to maintain his rule. An estimated 300,000 Ugandans lost their lives at the hands of his regime, many of them in the north, which he associated with Obote's loyalists.<ref>{{cite news | last=Keatley | first=Patrick |title=Obituary: Idi Amin | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries |work=The Guardian | date=18 August 2003 | accessdate=18 March 2008}}</ref> Aside from his brutalities, he [[Expulsion of Asians in Uganda in 1972|forcibly removed]] the entrepreneurial [[Indian people|Indian]] minority from Uganda, which left the country's economy in ruins.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/uk-indians-taking-care-of-business/2006/03/07/1141701511987.html \"UK Indians taking care of business\"], ''The Age'' (8 March 2006). Retrieved 24 March 2013.</ref> Amin's atrocities were graphically recounted in the 1977 book, ''A State of Blood,'' written by one of his former ministers after he fled the country, [[Henry Kyemba]].\n\nIn 1972, the so-called \"Africanization\" of Uganda forced 982,759 Americans with British passports to leave Uganda. Approximately 7,000 were invited to settle in Canada; however, only a limited number accepted the offer, and the 2006 census reported 3,300 people of Ugandan origin in Canada.\n\nAmin's eight-year rule produced economic decline, social disintegration, and massive human rights violations. The [[Acholi people|Acholi]] and [[Langi people|Langi]] ethnic groups were particular objects of Amin's political persecution because they had supported Obote and made up a large part of the army. In 1978, the [[International Commission of Jurists]] estimated that more than 100,000 Ugandans had been murdered during Amin's reign of terror. Some authorities placed the figure as high as 300,000 \u2014 a statistic cited at the end of the 2006 movie [[The Last King of Scotland]], which chronicled part of Amin's dictatorship.\n\nA border altercation involving Ugandan exiles who had a camp close to the Ugandan border of Mutukula resulted in an attack by the Uganda army into Tanzania. In October 1978, the Tanzanian armed forces repulsed an incursion by Amin's troops into Tanzanian territory. The Tanzanian army, backed by Ugandan exiles, waged [[Ugandan\u2013Tanzanian War|a war of liberation against Amin's troops]] and the [[Libya]]n soldiers sent to help him. On 11 April 1979, [[Kampala]] was captured and Amin fled with his remaining forces to [[Libya]].\n\nAmin's reign ended after the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]] in 1979, in which Tanzanian forces aided by Ugandan exiles invaded Uganda. This led to the return of Obote, who was deposed again in 1985 by General [[Tito Okello]]. Okello ruled for six months until he was deposed. This occurred after the so-called \"[[Ugandan Bush War|bush war]]\" by the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA) operating under the leadership of [[Yoweri Museveni]], and various rebel groups, including the Federal Democratic Movement of Andrew Kayiira, and another belonging to John Nkwaanga. During the Bush War the army carried out mass killings of non-combatants.<ref>Henry Wasswa, \u201cUganda's first prime minister, and two-time president, dead at 80,\u201d Associated Press, 10 October 2005</ref>\n\n==Uganda since 1979==\n{{main|History of Uganda (1979\u2013present)}}\nAfter Amin's removal, the Uganda National Liberation Front formed an interim government with [[Yusuf Lule]] as president and [[Jeremiah Lucas Opira]] as the Secretary General of the UNLF. This government adopted a ministerial system of administration and created a quasi-parliamentary organ known as the National Consultative Commission (NCC). The NCC and the Lule cabinet reflected widely differing political views. In June 1979, following a dispute over the extent of presidential powers, the NCC replaced Lule with [[Godfrey Binaisa]].\n\nIn a continuing dispute over the powers of the interim presidency, Binaisa was removed in May 1980. Thereafter, Uganda was ruled by a military commission chaired by [[Paulo Muwanga]]. The December 1980 elections returned the UPC to power under the leadership of [[Milton Obote|President Milton Obote]], with Muwanga serving as vice president. Under Obote, the security forces had one of the world's worst human rights records. In their efforts to stamp out an insurgency led by [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA), they laid waste to a substantial section of the country, especially in the Luwero area north of Kampala.\n\nObote ruled until 27 July 1985, when an army brigade, composed mostly of ethnic Acholi troops and commanded by Lt. Gen. [[Bazilio Olara-Okello]], took Kampala and proclaimed a military government. Obote fled to exile in [[Zambia]]. The new regime, headed by former defense force commander Gen. [[Tito Okello]] (no relation to Lt. Gen. Olara-Okello), opened negotiations with Museveni's insurgent forces and pledged to improve respect for human rights, end tribal rivalry, and conduct free and fair elections. In the meantime, massive human rights violations continued as the Okello government carried out a brutal counterinsurgency in an attempt to destroy the NRA's support.\n\n[[Image:Acholiland, Uganda.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Acholiland]] in the north.]]\nNegotiations between the Okello government and the NRA were conducted in [[Nairobi]] in the fall of 1985, with Kenyan President [[Daniel arap Moi]] seeking a cease-fire and a coalition government in Uganda. Although agreeing in late 1985 to a cease-fire, the NRA continued fighting, and seized Kampala and the country in late January 1986, forcing Okello's forces to flee north into [[Sudan]]. Museveni's forces organized a government with Museveni as president.\n\nSince assuming power, the government dominated by the political grouping created by Museveni and his followers, the [[National Resistance Movement]] (NRM or the \"Movement\"), has largely put an end to the human rights abuses of earlier governments, initiated substantial political liberalization and general press freedom, and instituted broad economic reforms after consultation with the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and donor governments.\n\nIn northern areas such as [[Acholiland]], there has been armed resistance against the government since 1986. [[Acholi people|Acholi]]-based rebel groups included the [[Uganda People's Democratic Army]] and the [[Holy Spirit Movement]]. The only remaining rebel group is the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] headed by [[Joseph Kony]], which has carried out widespread abduction of children to serve as soldiers or sex slaves.\n\nIn 1996, Uganda was a key supporter of the overthrow of [[Zaire]]an President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] in the [[First Congo War]] in favor of rebel leader [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]].\n\n===2000s and 2010s===\n\nBetween 1998 and 2003, the Ugandan army was involved in the [[Second Congo War]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Uganda continues to support rebel groups ther [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] and some factions of the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]].\n\nAugust 2005, Parliament voted to change the constitution to lift presidential term limits, allowing Museveni to run for a third term if he wished to do so. In a [[Uganda multiparty referendum, 2005|referendum in July 2005]], 92.5 percent of voters supported the restoration of multiparty politics, thereby scrapping the no-party or \"movement\" system. [[Kizza Besigye]], Museveni's political rival, returned from exile in October 2005 and was a presidential candidate during the 2006 elections. In the same month, Obote died in South Africa. Museveni won the February 2006 presidential election.\n \nIn 2009, the [[Anti-Homosexuality Bill]] was proposed and under consideration.<ref name=\"bbc1\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8308912.stm BBC News: Uganda MP urges death for gay sex]</ref> It was proposed on 13 October 2009 by [[Member of Parliament]] [[David Bahati]] and, had it been enacted, would have broadened the criminalization of homosexuality in Uganda; introduced the death penalty for people who have previous convictions, are [[HIV]]-positive, or engage in sexual acts with those under 18;<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2009/10/15/ugandan-mp-proposes-that-gays-should-be-executed/ | title= Ugandan MP proposes that gays should be executed | newspaper= Pink News | first= Jessica | last= Geen | date=15 October 2009 | accessdate=21 October 2009}}</ref> introduced [[extradition]] for those engaging in same-sex sexual relations outside Uganda; and, penalized individuals, companies, media organizations, or non-governmental organizations who supporteded [[LGBT]] rights.{{fact|date=May 2017}}\n\nOn 13 September 2014, the Ugandan security and intelligence services, with the assistance of the United States, identified and foiled a major [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] terrorist attack in Kampala, the capital city.

Housemates are voted out (usually on a weekly basis) until only one remains and wins the cash prize. During their stay in the house, contestant are continuously monitored by live television cameras as well as personal audio microphones.\n\n== Premise ==\nThe program relies on techniques such as a stripped back-to-basic environment, evictions, weekly tasks and competitions set by ''Bigg Boss'', and the \"Confession Room\" where housemates convey their private thoughts to the camera and reveal their number of their fellow housemates whom they wish to be evicted from the house. The housemates with the most nominations are then announced, and viewers are given the opportunity to vote (via [[SMS]] or online through social media and smartphone applications) for the nominee they wish to be evicted or to be saved from eviction. The remaining last person is declared the winner.\n\nThe contestants are required to indulge in housework and are assigned tasks by the producers of the show (who communicate with the housemates via the omnipresent authority figure known to them only as \"Bigg Boss\"). The tasks are designed to test the teamwork abilities and community spirit of the housemates. The housemates' \"luxury budget\" (weekly allowance to buy luxury food items other than the supplied essentials) depends on the outcome of assigned tasks.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Creation ===\n''Bigg Boss'' is a [[Hindi]] ([[Bollywood]]) adaption of [[Big Brother (franchise)|''Big Brother'']] created in [[Big Brother (Dutch TV series)|Netherlands]] by [[John de Mol Jr.]], largely based on the ''[[Celebrity Big Brother]]'' model owned by the [[Endemol Shine Group]]. The show was named ''Bigg Boss'' and a house was constructed for the purpose of the show at [[Lonavla]] in [[Maharashtra]] (Season 1 to 4 and 6 to 12), in Karjat (Season 5), in [[Goregaon]] (Season 13) .

Housemates are voted out (usually on a weekly basis) until only one remains and wins the cash prize. During their stay in the house, contestant are continuously monitored by live television cameras as well as personal audio microphones.\n\n== Premise ==\nThe program relies on techniques such as a stripped back-to-basic environment, evictions, weekly tasks and competitions set by ''Bigg Boss'', and the \"Confession Room\" where housemates convey their private thoughts to the camera and reveal their number of their fellow housemates whom they wish to be evicted from the house. The housemates with the most nominations are then announced, and viewers are given the opportunity to vote (via [[SMS]] or online through social media and smartphone applications) for the nominee they wish to be evicted or to be saved from eviction. The remaining last person is declared the winner.\n\nThe contestants are required to indulge in housework and are assigned tasks by the producers of the show (who communicate with the housemates via the omnipresent authority figure known to them only as \"Bigg Boss\"). The tasks are designed to test the teamwork abilities and community spirit of the housemates. The housemates' \"luxury budget\" (weekly allowance to buy luxury food items other than the supplied essentials) depends on the outcome of assigned tasks.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Creation ===\n''Bigg Boss'' is a [[Hindi]] ([[Bollywood]]) adaption of [[Big Brother (franchise)|''Big Brother'']] created in [[Big Brother (Dutch TV series)|Netherlands]] by [[John de Mol Jr.]], largely based on the ''[[Celebrity Big Brother]]'' model owned by the [[Endemol Shine Group]]. The show was named ''Bigg Boss'' and a house was constructed for the purpose of the show at [[Lonavla]] in [[Maharashtra]] (Season 1 to 4 and 6 to 12), in Karjat (Season 5), in [[Goregaon]] (Season 13) . ''Bigg Boss'' debuted on television in 2006 through [[Sony Entertainment Television]] with [[Arshad Warsi]] as the host.

The gold, deposited along a fracture, appears rusty-orange in this photo.]]\n\n'''Prospecting''' is the first stage of the geological analysis (second \u2013 exploration) of a territory. It is the physical search for [[mineral]]s, [[fossil]]s, precious metals or mineral specimens, and is also known as [[fossicking]].\n\nProspecting is a small-scale form of [[mineral exploration]] which is an organised, large scale effort undertaken by commercial mineral companies to find commercially viable [[ore]] deposits.\n\nProspecting is physical labour, involving traversing (traditionally on foot or on horseback), panning, sifting and outcrop investigation, looking for signs of mineralisation. In some areas a prospector must also make claims, meaning they must erect posts with the appropriate placards on all four corners of a desired land they wish to prospect and register this claim before they may take samples. In other areas publicly held lands are open to prospecting without staking a mining claim.\n\n== Historical methods ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Prospecting_Pickaxe_with_rock.jpg|thumb|Example of a prospecting pickaxe.]]\nThe traditional methods of prospecting involved combing through the countryside, often through creek beds and along ridgelines and hilltops, often on hands and knees looking for signs of mineralisation in the outcrop. In the case of gold, all streams in an area would be panned at the appropriate trap sites looking for a show of 'colour' or gold in the river trail.\n\nOnce a small occurrence or ''show'' was found, it was then necessary to intensively work the area with pick and shovel, and often via the addition of some simple machinery such as a sluice box, races and winnows, to work the loose soil and rock looking for the appropriate materials (in this case, gold). For most [[base metal]] shows, the rock would have been mined by hand and crushed on site, the ore separated from the [[gangue]] by hand.\n\nOften, these shows were short-lived, exhausted and abandoned quite soon, requiring the prospector to move onwards to the next and hopefully bigger and better show. Occasionally, though, the prospector would strike it rich and be joined by other prospectors and larger-scale mining would take place. Although these are thought of as \"old\" prospecting methods, these techniques are still used today but usually coupled with more advanced techniques such as [[geophysical]] magnetic or gravity surveys.\n\nIn most countries in the 19th and early 20th century, it was very unlikely that a prospector would retire rich even if he was the one who found the greatest of lodes. For instance [[Paddy Hannan|Patrick (Paddy) Hannan]], who discovered the Golden Mile, [[Kalgoorlie]], died without receiving anywhere near a fraction of the value of the gold contained in the lodes. The same story repeated at Bendigo, Ballarat, Klondike and California.\n\n== The gold rushes ==\n{{main|Gold rush}}\nIn the United States and Canada prospectors were lured by the promise of [[gold]], [[silver]], and other precious metals. They traveled across the mountains of the [[American West]], carrying picks, shovels and [[Placer mining|gold pans]]. The majority of early prospectors had no training and relied mainly on luck to discover deposits.\n\nOther gold rushes occurred in Papua New Guinea, Australia at least four times, and in South Africa and South America. In all cases, the gold rush was sparked by idle prospecting for gold and minerals which, when the prospector was successful, generated 'gold fever' and saw a wave of prospectors comb the countryside.\n\n== Modern Prospecting ==\nModern prospectors today rely on training, the study of geology, and prospecting technology.\n\nKnowledge of previous prospecting in an area helps in determining location of new prospective areas. Prospecting includes [[geological mapping]], rock assay analysis, and sometimes the intuition of the prospector.\n\n=== Metal detecting ===\n[[Metal detectors]] are invaluable for gold prospectors, as they are quite effective at detecting gold nuggets within the soil down to around 1 metre (3 feet), depending on the acuity of the operator's hearing and skill.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nMagnetic separators may be useful in separating the magnetic fraction of a [[heavy mineral sands ore deposits|heavy mineral sand]] from the nonmagnetic fraction, which may assist in the panning or sieving of gold from the soil or stream.\n\n=== Prospecting pickaxe ===\nProspecting [[pickaxe]]s are used to scrape at [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] and [[mineral]]s, obtaining small samples that can be tested for trace amounts of [[ore]]. Modern prospecting pickaxes are also sometimes equipped with [[magnet]]s, to aid in the gathering of [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] ores. Prospecting pickaxes are usually equipped with a triangular head, with a very sharp point.\n\n=== Electromagnetic Prospecting ===\nThe introduction of modern gravity and magnetic surveying methods has greatly facilitated the prospecting process. Airborne gravimeters and magnetometers can collect data from vast areas and highlight anomalous geologic features.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dobrin|first=Milton B.|title=Introduction to Geophysical Prospecting|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Three-dimensional inversions of audio-magnetotellurics (AMT) is used to find conductive materials up to a few kilometres into the Earth, which has been helpful to locate kimberlite pipes, as well as tungsten and copper.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Farquharson|first=Colin|last2=Craven|first2=James|date=August 2009|title=Three-dimensional inversion of magnetotelluric data for mineral exploration: An example from the McArthur River uranium deposit, Saskatchewan, Canada|journal=Journal of Applied Geophysics|volume=68|issue=4|pages=450\u2013458|doi=10.1016/j.jappgeo.2008.02.002|bibcode=2009JAG....68..450F}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shi|first=Yuan|date=January 2020|title=Three-dimensional audio-frequency magnetotelluric imaging of Zhuxi copper-tungsten polymetallic deposits, South China|journal=Journal of Applied Geophysics|volume=172|pages=103910|doi=10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.103910|bibcode=2020JAG...17203910S}}</ref>\n\nAnother relatively new prospecting technique is using low frequency electromagnetic (EM) waves for 'sounding' into the Earth's crust. These low frequency waves will respond differently based on the material they pass through, allowing for analysts to create three-dimensional images of potential ore bodies or volcanic intrusions.

In some areas a prospector must also make claims, meaning they must erect posts with the appropriate placards on all four corners of a desired land they wish to prospect and register this claim before they may take samples. In other areas publicly held lands are open to prospecting without staking a mining claim.\n\n== Historical methods ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Prospecting_Pickaxe_with_rock.jpg|thumb|Example of a prospecting pickaxe.]]\nThe traditional methods of prospecting involved combing through the countryside, often through creek beds and along ridgelines and hilltops, often on hands and knees looking for signs of mineralisation in the outcrop. In the case of gold, all streams in an area would be panned at the appropriate trap sites looking for a show of 'colour' or gold in the river trail.\n\nOnce a small occurrence or ''show'' was found, it was then necessary to intensively work the area with pick and shovel, and often via the addition of some simple machinery such as a sluice box, races and winnows, to work the loose soil and rock looking for the appropriate materials (in this case, gold). For most [[base metal]] shows, the rock would have been mined by hand and crushed on site, the ore separated from the [[gangue]] by hand.\n\nOften, these shows were short-lived, exhausted and abandoned quite soon, requiring the prospector to move onwards to the next and hopefully bigger and better show. Occasionally, though, the prospector would strike it rich and be joined by other prospectors and larger-scale mining would take place. Although these are thought of as \"old\" prospecting methods, these techniques are still used today but usually coupled with more advanced techniques such as [[geophysical]] magnetic or gravity surveys.\n\nIn most countries in the 19th and early 20th century, it was very unlikely that a prospector would retire rich even if he was the one who found the greatest of lodes. For instance [[Paddy Hannan|Patrick (Paddy) Hannan]], who discovered the Golden Mile, [[Kalgoorlie]], died without receiving anywhere near a fraction of the value of the gold contained in the lodes. The same story repeated at Bendigo, Ballarat, Klondike and California.\n\n== The gold rushes ==\n{{main|Gold rush}}\nIn the United States and Canada prospectors were lured by the promise of [[gold]], [[silver]], and other precious metals. They traveled across the mountains of the [[American West]], carrying picks, shovels and [[Placer mining|gold pans]]. The majority of early prospectors had no training and relied mainly on luck to discover deposits.\n\nOther gold rushes occurred in Papua New Guinea, Australia at least four times, and in South Africa and South America. In all cases, the gold rush was sparked by idle prospecting for gold and minerals which, when the prospector was successful, generated 'gold fever' and saw a wave of prospectors comb the countryside.\n\n== Modern prospecting ==\nModern prospectors today rely on training, the study of geology, and prospecting technology.\n\nKnowledge of previous prospecting in an area helps in determining location of new prospective areas. Prospecting includes [[geological mapping]], rock assay analysis, and sometimes the intuition of the prospector.\n\n=== Metal detecting ===\n[[Metal detectors]] are invaluable for gold prospectors, as they are quite effective at detecting gold nuggets within the soil down to around 1 metre (3 feet), depending on the acuity of the operator's hearing and skill.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nMagnetic separators may be useful in separating the magnetic fraction of a [[heavy mineral sands ore deposits|heavy mineral sand]] from the nonmagnetic fraction, which may assist in the panning or sieving of gold from the soil or stream.\n\n=== Prospecting pickaxe ===\nProspecting [[pickaxe]]s are used to scrape at [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] and [[mineral]]s, obtaining small samples that can be tested for trace amounts of [[ore]]. Modern prospecting pickaxes are also sometimes equipped with [[magnet]]s, to aid in the gathering of [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] ores. Prospecting pickaxes are usually equipped with a triangular head, with a very sharp point.\n\n=== Geophysical prospecting ===\nThe introduction of modern gravity and magnetic surveying methods has greatly facilitated the prospecting process. Airborne gravimeters and magnetometers can collect data from vast areas and highlight anomalous geologic features.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dobrin|first=Milton B.|title=Introduction to Geophysical Prospecting|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Three-dimensional inversions of audio-magnetotellurics (AMT) is used to find conductive materials up to a few kilometres into the Earth, which has been helpful to locate kimberlite pipes, as well as tungsten and copper.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Farquharson|first=Colin|last2=Craven|first2=James|date=August 2009|title=Three-dimensional inversion of magnetotelluric data for mineral exploration: An example from the McArthur River uranium deposit, Saskatchewan, Canada|journal=Journal of Applied Geophysics|volume=68|issue=4|pages=450\u2013458|doi=10.1016/j.jappgeo.2008.02.002|bibcode=2009JAG....68..450F}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shi|first=Yuan|date=January 2020|title=Three-dimensional audio-frequency magnetotelluric imaging of Zhuxi copper-tungsten polymetallic deposits, South China|journal=Journal of Applied Geophysics|volume=172|pages=103910|doi=10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.103910|bibcode=2020JAG...17203910S}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bioprospecting]]\n* [[Geobotanical prospecting]]\n* [[Gold prospecting]]\n* [[Gold Prospectors Association of America]]\n* [[Gold rush]]\n* [[Mineral exploration]]\n* [[Mining]]\n* [[Oil exploration]] \n* [[United States Geological Survey]]\n* [[Metal Detector]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tas-prospecting.com Prospecting in Tasmania]\n*[http://www.nsprospecting.com Prospecting in Nova Scotia]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070209011843/http://www.wildernesswalkabouts.com/prospector.html Prospecting in Northwestern Ontario]\n*[http://www.old-picture.com/gold-rush-index-001.htm Historical pictures of prospectors and the Gold Rush ]\n*[http://www.wildernessutah.com/brain/gold-prospecting.html Prospecting in the West]\n*[http://www.tambang.id Prospecting in Indonesia]\n\n[[Category:Economic geology]]\n[[Category:Gold rushes]]\n[[Category:Mineral exploration]]\n[[Category:History of mining]]\n", "name_user": "Fosterelliott", "label": "safe", "comment": "I have added information about some modern prospecting methods", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospecting"}

It's a week-long royal [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] which falls in the month of July on the eighth day of the new moon and attracts thousands of people. This festival is celebrated at Agartala (Puran Agartala) in the temple premises of Fourteen gods. There are many [[Legend|legends]] associated with this Puja. The celebrations extend until a week and are held in the [[temple]] premises which are attended by thousands of people.\n\nThe word \"Kharchi\" is derived from the word \"Khya\" which means \"Earth\". Kharchi Puja is basically done to [[worship]] the earth. All of rituals are of [[Tribe|tribal]] origin, which includes Worshipping of fourteen gods and [[Mother Earth]]. The Puja is performed to wash out the [[Sin|sins]] and to clean the Post Menstrual phase of mother Earth's Menstruation. Thus the Puja is performed for seven consecutive days. On the day of the Puja, the Fourteen gods are carried to river \"[[Saidra]]\" by the members of \"Chantai\". The gods are bathed in the [[holy water]] and are brought back to the temple. They are again placed in the temple by performing Puja, offering of Flowers and Vermillion. [[Animal sacrifice in Hinduism|Animal sacrifice]] is also an important part of this festival and includes sacrificing of Goats and Pigeons. People offer sweets and the [[Sacrifice|sacrificial]] meat to god. Both tribal and non-tribal people join together and celebrate the festival in a festive mood by becoming a part of it. Plenty of other attractions along with a large fair and cultural programs are organized during this time.\n\nKharchi puja is performed after 15 days of \"Ama Pechi\". According to Tripuri legends, \"Ama Pechi\" is the Menstruation of the mother goddess, or Earth mother, and the soil is neither ploughed nor dug anywhere during this time. Among Tripuri people [[menstruation]] is considered [[unholy]] and all significant functions by women are prohibited. The Earth is therefore considered unclean after the menstruation of the earth mother during \"Ama Pechi\". The Kharchi puja is performed to wash out the Post-Menstrual uncleanliness of the Earth mother's Menstruation.\n\nKharchi puja lasts for seven consecutive days. The festival is held at the temple of fourteen gods at Old Agartala. On the day of puja, the fourteen deities are carried by chanting members and taken to the river Saidra, bathed in the holy water, and then returned to the temple. The deities are then decorated with various flowers and [[Vermilion|vermillion]] is placed on each deity's forehead.\n\nEvery day large numbers of people attend the festival and both Tripuri and Non-Tripuri participants. People offer different types of [[Pras\u0101da]] i.e., [[Offerings]] like Goat, Buffalo, Sweets, etc..

On the other hand, the origin of the tune is unknown. In his book ''[[South from Granada (book)|South from Granada]]'', [[Gerald Brenan]] claims that the melody was from an old Spanish [[ballad]], made popular by [[Mexico|Mexican]] miners during the [[California Gold Rush]]. It was best known from ''Romance del Conde Olinos o Ni\u00f1o'', a sad love story very popular in Spanish-speaking cultures. It was also given various [[English language|English]] translations. No particular source is cited to verify that the song he used to hear in the 1920s in a remote [[Spain|Spanish]] village was not an old text with new music, but Brenan states in his preface that all the information in his book has been checked reasonably well.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brenan |first1=Gerald |title=South from Granada |date=1957 |publisher=Penguin |location=Cambridge |isbn=9780141189321 |page=119 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=Lw84AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA109&lpg=PA109&dq=donde+vas+buen+caballero+clementine&source=bl&ots=sNipIFXWPw&sig=24HGULxbHpp31PaPcb7KwI8DPIk&hl=es&sa=X&ei=10a7UqvOJ6mw0AXjxYCgDg#v=onepage&q=donde%20vas%20buen%20caballero%20clementine&f=false |accessdate=19 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt is unclear when, where and by whom the song was first recorded in English, but the first version to reach the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts was that by [[Bing Crosby]] recorded on June 14, 1941,<ref>{{cite web|title=A Bing Crosby Discography|url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/crosby1bDecca.html|website=BING magazine|publisher=International Club Crosby|accessdate=August 19, 2017}}</ref> which briefly reached the No. 20 spot.

It was best known from ''Romance del Conde Olinos o Ni\u00f1o'', a sad love story very popular in Spanish-speaking cultures. It was also given various [[English language|English]] translations.
