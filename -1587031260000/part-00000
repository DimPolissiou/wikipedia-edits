It ranks Britain's 100 private companies with the fastest-growing sales over the last three years. It is published in [[The Sunday Times]] each December, with a conference and awards event typically held in May<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sunday-times-virgin-atlantic-fast-track-100-awards-qtqtr63nf|title=Sunday Times Virgin Atlantic Fast Track 100 awards|date=19 May 2019|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>, and alumni dinners during the year. The list is researched and produced by Fast Track, an Oxford-based research and networking events business<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fasttrack.co.uk/about-us/|title=Fast Track Ltd|website=Fast Track|access-date=16 April 2020}}</ref>. Sir Richard Brandon and the [[Virgin Group]] have supported the Fast Track 100 league table since Hamish Stevenson founded Fast Track in 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/entrepreneurs-are-lifeblood-uk-business|title=Entrepreneurs are the lifeblood of UK business|date=2018-12-17|website=Virgin|language=en|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nThe Fast Track 100 is generally promoted as the definitive guide to the fastest growing privately held companies in the UK. [[Richard Branson]] is quoted as saying ''\"Fast Track has become the definitive barometer of growth companies\"'' However a number of limitations exists which mean that the list may not contain information on many fast growing companies.  Most important of these is the reliance on historical data.  Because Fast Track only deals in publicly available information generally from published accounts, the league table refers to data that is sometimes as much as 10 months out of date.\n\nOn the other hand, this method ensures objectivity and has led to the early identification of a number of household names, including [[Carphone Warehouse]], [[British Home Stores]] and [[Travelex]].\n\n== Entry criteria ==\nCompanies have to meet the criteria below<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fasttrack.co.uk/league-tables/fast-track-100/nominate-a-company/entry-criteria/|title=Fast Track 100 entry criteria|website=Fast Track|url-status=live|access-date=16 April 2020}}</ref> to be able to enter the Fast Track 100 league table:\n\n* UK registered, unquoted, and not subsidiary\n* Sales of at least \u00a3250,000 in the base year of trading (latest year minus 3 years)\n* Sales of at least \u00a35m in the latest year\n*Ten or more employees in the latest year\n* Operating profit of at least \u00a3500,00 in the latest year\n*Year-on-year sales growth in the latest year\n*Trading weeks in the base and latest years have to exceed 25\n*Recruitment firms, payroll services providers, energy firms and media agencies are required to have gross profits of at least \u00a35m. Sales for recruitment and payroll firms are the total amount invoiced to clients; media agencies\u2019 sales are net of advertising spend on behalf of clients\n\n\nCompanies that do not meet all the criteria can still be considered for the Ones to Watch programme<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fasttrack.co.uk/league-tables/fast-track-100/ones-to-watch/|title=Fast Track Ones to Watch programme|website=Fast Track|url-status=live|access-date=16 April 2020}}</ref>, particularly if they forecast good sales growth.\n\n\n'''Exclusions'''\n\n* Technology, digital media and telecoms (TMT) companies (which appear on [[Tech Track 100]])\n* LLPs, pure property and financial trading companies, and companies with sales of over \u00a3500m\n\n* \n\n== Other Fast Track lists ==\nFast Track 100 is one of seven business lists of private companies produced by Fast Track and published in the Sunday Times:\n* Fast Track 100 - Fastest growth in sales\n* [[Tech Track 100]] - Fastest growth in sales for 'tech' companies\n* International Track 200 - Fastest growth in overseas sales\n* [[Profit Track 100]] - Fastest growth in profits\n* [[Top Track 100]]- Biggest private companies based on sales\n* [[Top Track 250]] - Leading mid-market private companies\n\n== 2018 Fast Track 100 list ==\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+2018 Top 20 Rankings\n!Ranking\n!Company name\n!Business Activity\n!Sales growth (% per annum over 3 years)\n|-\n|1\n|Midwinter Solutions\n|Clinical trials supplier\n|233.29%\n|-\n|2\n|[[Crep Protect]]\n|Footwear accessories developer\n|190.74%\n|-\n|3\n|Revolution Beauty\n|Beauty products retailer\n|152.92%\n|-\n|4\n|Missoma\n|Online jewellery brand\n|148.26%\n|-\n|5\n|Mission Mars\n|Bar and restaurant operator\n|147.37%\n|-\n|6\n|Warner Edwards\n|Gin distiller\n|142.58%\n|-\n|7\n|One Retail Group\n|Consumer products retailer\n|141.53%\n|-\n|8\n|AerFin\n|Aircraft and spares services\n|140.68%\n|-\n|9\n|[[A.F.C.

It ranks Britain's 100 private companies with the fastest-growing sales over the last three years. It is published in [[The Sunday Times]] each December, with a conference and awards event typically held in May<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sunday-times-virgin-atlantic-fast-track-100-awards-qtqtr63nf|title=Sunday Times Virgin Atlantic Fast Track 100 awards|date=19 May 2019|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>, and alumni dinners during the year. The list is researched and produced by Fast Track, an Oxford-based research and networking events business<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fasttrack.co.uk/about-us/|title=Fast Track Ltd|website=Fast Track|access-date=16 April 2020}}</ref>. Sir Richard Brandon and the [[Virgin Group]] have supported the Fast Track 100 league table since Hamish Stevenson founded Fast Track in 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/entrepreneurs-are-lifeblood-uk-business|title=Entrepreneurs are the lifeblood of UK business|date=2018-12-17|website=Virgin|language=en|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nThe Fast Track 100 is generally promoted as the definitive guide to the fastest growing privately held companies in the UK. [[Richard Branson]] is quoted as saying ''\"Fast Track has become the definitive barometer of growth companies\"'' However a number of limitations exists which mean that the list may not contain information on many fast growing companies.  Most important of these is the reliance on historical data.  Because Fast Track only deals in publicly available information generally from published accounts, the league table refers to data that is sometimes as much as 10 months out of date.\n\nOn the other hand, this method ensures objectivity and has led to the early identification of a number of household names, including [[Carphone Warehouse]], [[British Home Stores]] and [[Travelex]].\n\n== Entry criteria ==\nFor entry to the 2013 Fast Track 100 companies were required to be:\n\n* Unquoted\n* Registered in the UK\n* Non-subsidiary, independent\n* 10 or more employees\n* Annualised sales of at least \u00a3250,000 in 2009/10\n* Annualised sales of at least \u00a35m in 2012/13\n* An increase in sales from penultimate to latest year, and a forecast of further sales growth\n* Not a technology company\n\n== Other Fast Track lists ==\nFast Track 100 is one of seven business lists of private companies produced by Fast Track and published in the Sunday Times:\n* Fast Track 100 - Fastest growth in sales\n* [[Tech Track 100]] - Fastest growth in sales for 'tech' companies\n* International Track 200 - Fastest growth in overseas sales\n* [[Profit Track 100]] - Fastest growth in profits\n* [[Top Track 100]]- Biggest private companies based on sales\n* [[Top Track 250]] - Leading mid-market private companies\n\n== 2018 Fast Track 100 list ==\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+2018 Top 20 Rankings\n!Ranking\n!Company name\n!Business Activity\n!Sales growth (% per annum over 3 years)\n|-\n|1\n|Midwinter Solutions\n|Clinical trials supplier\n|233.29%\n|-\n|2\n|[[Crep Protect]]\n|Footwear accessories developer\n|190.74%\n|-\n|3\n|Revolution Beauty\n|Beauty products retailer\n|152.92%\n|-\n|4\n|Missoma\n|Online jewellery brand\n|148.26%\n|-\n|5\n|Mission Mars\n|Bar and restaurant operator\n|147.37%\n|-\n|6\n|Warner Edwards\n|Gin distiller\n|142.58%\n|-\n|7\n|One Retail Group\n|Consumer products retailer\n|141.53%\n|-\n|8\n|AerFin\n|Aircraft and spares services\n|140.68%\n|-\n|9\n|[[A.F.C.

The team was officially known as the '''Quebec Hockey Club''',<ref>Farrell, pg. 77</ref> and later as the '''Quebec Athletic Club.''' One of the first organized ice hockey clubs, the club debuted in 1878 with the opening of the [[Quebec Skating Rink]]. The club continued as an amateur team through various leagues, eventually becoming professional in 1908. The club would play in the [[National Hockey Association]] (the forerunner to the NHL) and the [[National Hockey League]]. In 1920, the team moved to [[Hamilton, Ontario]] and became the [[Hamilton Tigers (ice hockey)|Hamilton Tigers]].\n\n==Franchise history==\n\n===Amateur roots, 1878\u20131909===\n[[File:Quebec Hockey Club 1891-92.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Quebec Hockey Club in 1891\u201392. Players are Bertram Patton, Herbert Bignell, Arthur Dickson Scott, Charles Smith, Arthur Edward Scott, Herbert Scott, Robert Davidson and [[David Watson (general)|David Watson]].]]The Quebec Hockey Club was founded in 1878, after the construction of the Quebec Skating Rink in 1877.<ref name=\"battfields-1878\"/> The club consisted of Anglo-Canadian players. Play was by exhibition only, against teams drawn from the club members or visiting teams from Montreal. In 1883, the club played in the [[Montreal Winter Carnival ice hockey tournaments|Montreal Winter Carnival]], and joined the [[Amateur Hockey Association of Canada]] (AHAC) in 1888 and were members until 1898. After the AHAC, Quebec played in the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey League]] from 1899 to 1905, and the [[Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association]] from 1906 to 1909. One player that went through the ranks of the Quebec Hockey Club was [[David Watson (general)|David Watson]] (1869\u20131922), a journalist and newspaper owner who fought as a Major-General in [[World War I]]. Watson played for the Quebec HC as a cover point (an offensive defenceman) in the AHAC through the course of the 1890s.\n\nThe club came close to winning the Stanley Cup on two occasions. In the [[1894 AHAC season|1894 season]] Quebec tied for the AHAC regular season lead with three other clubs. The AHAC drew up plans to hold the playoff solely in Montreal. Quebec declined to play in Montreal without one game in Quebec and the championship was eventually won by the [[Montreal Hockey Club]]. In 1904, Quebec won the CAHL outright. In a dispute, the club did not win the [[Stanley Cup]] or challenge for it. The [[Ottawa Hockey Club]] was the defending champions in [[1904 CAHL season|1903\u201304]], but withdrew from the league. Quebec went on to win the CAHL and expected to receive the Stanley Cup as league champions. The trustees of the Cup instead ruled that the Cup went to Ottawa.\n\nTwo significant players on the Quebec Hockey Club during the later part of the first decade of the 1900s were [[Charles Gavan Power|Chubby]] and [[Joe Power (ice hockey)|Joe Power]], who both later would be serve as politicians in Quebec. A third Power brother, [[James Power (ice hockey)|Rockett Power]], also represented the club.\n\n===National Hockey Association===\n\nIn late 1909, Quebec became a founding member of the [[Canadian Hockey Association (1909\u20131910)|Canadian Hockey Association]] (CHA) in 1909. The CHA, however, would only last one month before being absorbed into the much more powerful [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA). Rejected by the new league, the Bulldogs sat out the inaugural [[1910 NHA season|1910]] season. The following season, [[1910\u201311 NHA season|1910\u201311]], the Bulldogs took over the defunct [[Cobalt Silver Kings]] franchise, but had a rough initiation, finishing dead last with four wins and 12 losses in a 16-game season. On a positive note, and a sign of things to come, [[Jack Patrick McDonald|Jack McDonald]] scored 14 goals and [[Tommy Dunderdale]] scored 13.\n\nFor [[1911\u201312 NHA season|1911\u201312]], the Bulldogs went from worst to first, with [[Joe Malone (ice hockey)|Joe Malone]] having a spectacular season, to win the [[O'Brien Trophy (ice hockey)|O'Brien Cup]] as champions of the NHA and the [[Stanley Cup]]. The Dogs' record improved to 10 wins and eight losses while Malone scored 21 goals and Jack McDonald scored 18. In a Stanley Cup challenge, they crushed the [[Moncton Victorias]] in two games, 9\u20133 and 8\u20130, in the best-of-three [[playoff]].\n\n[[Image:Quebec Bulldogs, 1911 logo.png|right|thumb|150px|Logo used (1911\u20131913).]]\nIn their third season ([[1912\u201313 NHA season|1912\u201313]]), Quebec would again finish first overall with a record of 16-4 losses to retain the championship. Joe Malone won the scoring race with an unprecedented 43 goals. His teammate, [[Tommy Smith (ice hockey)|Tommy Smith]], was a close second with 39. In a Stanley Cup challenge after the season the team easily beat the [[Sydney Millionaires (MaPHL)|Sydney Millionaires]] in two games by a combined score of 20-5.\n\nThe [[Victoria Aristocrats]] of the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] next challenged the Bulldogs. The powerhouse Bulldogs expected to bowl over the Aristocrats, but were shocked after splitting the first two games and then losing 6\u20131 in the decisive third game. However, the Stanley Cup Board of trustees did not recognise the challenge because it should have been played in Quebec. PCHA leader Lester Patrick refused. The Bulldogs were able to keep the Cup.\n\nIn December 1913, the Bulldogs moved to the new [[Quebec Arena]].<ref name=\"times-arena\"/> The following seasons would see the Bulldogs drop from the top of the league. They would finish third overall in each of the next three seasons and in the last NHA season ([[1916\u201317 NHL season|1916\u201317]]) went second overall. After their two Stanley Cup wins, though, they would never again challenge for the Cup.\n\n===National Hockey League and the move to Hamilton 1917\u20131925===\nThe Bulldogs, along with the [[Montreal Canadiens]], [[Montreal Wanderers]] and [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]], were frustrated with [[Toronto Blueshirts]] owner [[Eddie Livingstone]]'s acrimonious dealings.  However, they discovered that the league constitution did not allow them to simply vote Livingstone out.  Instead, the four clubs joined in founding the [[National Hockey League]] in 1917, and did not invite Livingstone to join them. Quebec's long-time manager [[Mike Quinn (ice hockey)|Mike Quinn]] had retired due to ill health.  The other directors of the Bulldogs were unable to get enough financing to make the move to the NHL\u2014no small consideration given that Quebec City was by far the smallest market in the league.  They opted to suspend operations for the league's [[1917\u201318 NHL season|inaugural season]].{{sfn|Wong|2005|p=76}} To balance out the schedule, the remaining three clubs granted a temporary franchise to the Toronto Arena Company; the direct ancestors of today's [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].\n\nIn 1918, the franchise was sold in principle to [[Percy Quinn]]. However, Quinn's actual intent was to use the Bulldogs to help resurrect the NHA.  However, the other owners called Quinn's bluff by demanding a firm commitment to ice a team in the NHL for the [[1918\u201319 NHL season|1918\u201319 season]].  When Quinn refused to do so, the NHL canceled the franchise.{{sfn|Wong|2005|p=78}} When no other Quebec-based group came forward, the Bulldogs sat out the 1918\u201319 season as well.\n\nIn May 1919, NHL president Calder and Mike Quinn made efforts to return Quebec to the league. Calder suggested that Quinn apply to the league for a new franchise. On December 2, 1919, the NHL approved the application of the Quebec Athletic Club for an NHL franchise.{{sfn|Wong|2005|p=78}} Newspapers at the time now referred to the team as the ''Quebec Athletics''<ref>{{cite book |title=The Official National Hockey League 75th anniversary commemorative book |publisher=McClelland & Stewart |location=Toronto |last=Diamond |first=Dan |year=1991 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/officialnational0000unse/page/26 26] |isbn=0-7710-6727-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/officialnational0000unse/page/26 }}</ref> rather than ''Bulldogs''.\n\nWhile the team had been suspended, their star player, [[Joe Malone (ice hockey)|Joe Malone]], played for the Canadiens. Malone rejoined the franchise, and won the scoring championship that year with 39 goals. Despite Malone's scoring and the presence of players like [[Harry Mummery]], Quebec had a dismal season, finishing last, with 4 wins and 20 losses.\n\nBefore the 1920\u201321 season, the NHL took back the franchise, and sold it to new owners who moved the team to Hamilton, where it became the Tigers. This helped to head off a potential competing league organized by Livingstone from setting up in Hamilton.<ref>{{cite book|title=Deceptions and Doublecross: How the NHL conquered hockey |last=Holzman | first=Morey | year=2001 | publisher=Dundurn Press}}</ref>\n\nThe Tigers played in the NHL from [[1920\u201321 NHL season|1920]] to [[1924\u201325 NHL season|1925]]. Due in large part to a team players' strike in the 1925 NHL playoffs, the franchise was revoked a second time that summer, this time for good.  The entire Tigers roster was then sold to [[Bill Dwyer (gangster)|Bill Dwyer]], owner of the expansion [[New York Americans]] franchise. However, the NHL does not reckon the Americans as a continuation of the Bulldogs/Tigers franchise.  The Americans would play in the NHL from [[1925\u201326 NHL season|1925]] to [[1941\u201342 NHL season|1942]].\n\nThe last active Bulldogs player in major-league hockey was [[Dave Ritchie (ice hockey)|Dave Ritchie]], who retired in 1926. The last active Bulldog player was [[Eddie Oatman]], who played pro hockey until 1939 and played against the CAHL Quebec Beavers in 1929.\n\nOver time, various hockey teams played in Quebec, including the minor-pro [[Quebec Castors]] and [[Quebec Aces]]. Big-league hockey would not return to Quebec City until the [[Quebec Nordiques]] were founded in 1972 as part of the new [[World Hockey Association]]. They joined the NHL in 1979. However, as with the Bulldogs, they found the going difficult playing in the league's smallest market.  They moved to [[Denver]] in 1995 as the [[Colorado Avalanche]].

The team was officially known as the '''Quebec Hockey Club''',<ref>Farrell, pg. 77</ref> and later as the '''Quebec Athletic Club.''' One of the first organized ice hockey clubs, the club debuted in 1878 with the opening of the [[Quebec Skating Rink]]. The club continued as an amateur team through various leagues, eventually becoming professional in 1908. The club would play in the [[National Hockey Association]] (the forerunner to the NHL) and the [[National Hockey League]]. In 1920, the team moved to [[Hamilton, Ontario]] and became the [[Hamilton Tigers (ice hockey)|Hamilton Tigers]].\n\n==Franchise history==\n\n===Amateur roots, 1878\u20131909===\n[[File:Quebec Hockey Club 1891-92.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Quebec Hockey Club in 1891\u201392. Players are Bertram Patton, Herbert Bignell, Arthur Dickson Scott, Charles Smith, Arthur Edward Scott, Herbert Scott, Robert Davidson and [[David Watson (general)|David Watson]].]]The Quebec Hockey Club was founded in 1878, after the construction of the Quebec Skating Rink in 1877.<ref name=\"battfields-1878\"/> The club consisted of Anglo-Canadian players. Play was by exhibition only, against teams drawn from the club members or visiting teams from Montreal. In 1883, the club played in the [[Montreal Winter Carnival ice hockey tournaments|Montreal Winter Carnival]], and joined the [[Amateur Hockey Association of Canada]] (AHAC) in 1888 and were members until 1898. After the AHAC, Quebec played in the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey League]] from 1899 to 1905, and the [[Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association]] from 1906 to 1909. One player that went through the ranks of the Quebec Hockey Club was [[David Watson (general)|David Watson]] (1869\u20131922), a journalist and newspaper owner who fought as a Major-General in [[World War I]]. Watson played for the Quebec HC as a cover point (an offensive defenceman) in the AHAC through the course of the 1890s.\n\nThe club came close to winning the Stanley Cup on two occasions. In the [[1894 AHAC season|1894 season]] Quebec tied for the AHAC regular season lead with three other clubs. The AHAC drew up plans to hold the playoff solely in Montreal. Quebec declined to play in Montreal without one game in Quebec and the championship was eventually won by the [[Montreal Hockey Club]]. In 1904, Quebec won the CAHL outright. In a dispute, the club did not win the [[Stanley Cup]] or challenge for it. The [[Ottawa Hockey Club]] was the defending champions in [[1904 CAHL season|1903\u201304]], but withdrew from the league. Quebec went on to win the CAHL and expected to receive the Stanley Cup as league champions. The trustees of the Cup instead ruled that the Cup went to Ottawa.\n\nTwo significant players on the Quebec Hockey Club during the later part of the first decade of the 1900s were [[Charles Gavan Power|Chubby]] and [[Joe Power (ice hockey)|Joe Power]], who both later would be serve as politicians in Quebec. A third Power brother, [[James Power (ice hockey)|Rockett Power]], also represented the club.\n\n===National Hockey Association===\n\nIn late 1909, Quebec became a founding member of the [[Canadian Hockey Association (1909\u20131910)|Canadian Hockey Association]] (CHA) in 1909. The CHA, however, would only last one month before being absorbed into the much more powerful [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA). Rejected by the new league, the Bulldogs sat out the inaugural [[1910 NHA season|1910]] season. The following season, [[1910\u201311 NHA season|1910\u201311]], the Bulldogs took over the defunct [[Cobalt Silver Kings]] franchise, but had a rough initiation, finishing dead last with four wins and 12 losses in a 16-game season. On a positive note, and a sign of things to come, [[Jack Patrick McDonald|Jack McDonald]] scored 14 goals and [[Tommy Dunderdale]] scored 13.\n\nFor [[1911\u201312 NHA season|1911\u201312]], the Bulldogs went from worst to first, with [[Joe Malone (ice hockey)|Joe Malone]] having a spectacular season, to win the [[O'Brien Trophy (ice hockey)|O'Brien Cup]] as champions of the NHA and the [[Stanley Cup]]. The Dogs' record improved to 10 wins and eight losses while Malone scored 21 goals and Jack McDonald scored 18. In a Stanley Cup challenge, they crushed the [[Moncton Victorias]] in two games, 9\u20133 and 8\u20130, in the best-of-three [[playoff]].\n\n[[Image:Quebec Bulldogs, 1911 logo.png|right|thumb|150px|Logo used (1911\u20131913).]]\nIn their third season ([[1912\u201313 NHA season|1912\u201313]]), Quebec would again finish first overall with a record of 16-4 losses to retain the championship. Joe Malone won the scoring race with an unprecedented 43 goals. His teammate, [[Tommy Smith (ice hockey)|Tommy Smith]], was a close second with 39. In a Stanley Cup challenge after the season the team easily beat the [[Sydney Millionaires (MaPHL)|Sydney Millionaires]] in two games by a combined score of 20-5.\n\nThe [[Victoria Aristocrats]] of the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] next challenged the Bulldogs. The powerhouse Bulldogs expected to bowl over the Aristocrats, but were shocked after splitting the first two games and then losing 6\u20131 in the decisive third game. However, the Stanley Cup Board of trustees did not recognise the challenge because it should have been played in Quebec. PCHA leader Lester Patrick refused. The Bulldogs were able to keep the Cup.\n\nIn December 1913, the Bulldogs moved to the new [[Quebec Arena]].<ref name=\"times-arena\"/> The following seasons would see the Bulldogs drop from the top of the league. They would finish third overall in each of the next three seasons and in the last NHA season ([[1916\u201317 NHL season|1916\u201317]]) went second overall. After their two Stanley Cup wins, though, they would never again challenge for the Cup.\n\n===National Hockey League and the move to Hamilton 1917\u20131925===\nThe Bulldogs, along with the [[Montreal Canadiens]], [[Montreal Wanderers]] and [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]], were frustrated with [[Toronto Blueshirts]] owner [[Eddie Livingstone]]'s acrimonious dealings.  However, they discovered that the league constitution did not allow them to simply vote Livingstone out.  Instead, the four clubs joined in founding the [[National Hockey League]] in 1917, and did not invite Livingstone to join them. Quebec's long-time manager [[Mike Quinn (ice hockey)|Mike Quinn]] had retired due to ill health.  The other directors of the Bulldogs were unable to get enough financing to make the move to the NHL\u2014no small consideration given that Quebec City was by far the smallest market in the league.  They opted to suspend operations for the league's [[1917\u201318 NHL season|inaugural season]].{{sfn|Wong|2005|p=76}} To balance out the schedule, the remaining three clubs granted a temporary franchise to the Toronto Arena Company; the direct ancestors of today's [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].\n\nIn 1918, the franchise was sold in principle to [[Percy Quinn]]. However, Quinn's actual intent was to use the Bulldogs to help resurrect the NHA.  However, the other owners called Quinn's bluff by demanding a firm commitment to ice a team in the NHL for the [[1918\u201319 NHL season|1918\u201319 season]].  When Quinn refused to do so, the NHL canceled the franchise.{{sfn|Wong|2005|p=78}} When no other Quebec-based group came forward, the Bulldogs sat out the 1918\u201319 season as well.\n\nIn May 1919, NHL president Calder and Mike Quinn made efforts to return Quebec to the league. Calder suggested that Quinn apply to the league for a new franchise. On December 2, 1919, the NHL approved the application of the Quebec Athletic Club for an NHL franchise.{{sfn|Wong|2005|p=78}} Newspapers at the time now referred to the team as the ''Quebec Athletics''<ref>{{cite book |title=The Official National Hockey League 75th anniversary commemorative book |publisher=McClelland & Stewart |location=Toronto |last=Diamond |first=Dan |year=1991 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/officialnational0000unse/page/26 26] |isbn=0-7710-6727-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/officialnational0000unse/page/26 }}</ref> rather than ''Bulldogs''.\n\nWhile the team had been suspended, their star player, [[Joe Malone (ice hockey)|Joe Malone]], played for the Canadiens. Malone rejoined the franchise, and won the scoring championship that year with 39 goals. Despite Malone's scoring and the presence of players like [[Harry Mummery]], Quebec had a dismal season, finishing last, with 4 wins and 20 losses.\n\nBefore the 1920\u201321 season, the NHL took back the franchise, and sold it to new owners who moved the team to Hamilton, where it became the Tigers. This helped to head off a potential competing league organized by Livingstone from setting up in Hamilton.<ref>{{cite book|title=Deceptions and Doublecross: How the NHL conquered hockey |last=Holzman | first=Morey | year=2001 | publisher=Dundurn Press}}</ref>\n\nThe Tigers played in the NHL from [[1920\u201321 NHL season|1920]] to [[1924\u201325 NHL season|1925]]. Due in large part to a team players' strike in the 1925 NHL playoffs, the franchise was revoked a second time that summer, this time for good.  The entire Tigers roster was then sold to [[Bill Dwyer (gangster)|Bill Dwyer]], owner of the expansion [[New York Americans]] franchise. However, the NHL does not reckon the Americans as a continuation of the Bulldogs/Tigers franchise.  The Americans would play in the NHL from [[1925\u201326 NHL season|1925]] to [[1941\u201342 NHL season|1942]].\n\nThe last active Bulldogs player in major-league hockey was [[Dave Ritchie (ice hockey)|Dave Ritchie]], who retired in 1926. The last active Bulldog player was [[Eddie Oatman]], who played pro hockey until 1939 and played against the CAHL Quebec Beavers in 1929.\n\nOver time, various hockey teams played in Quebec, including the minor-pro [[Quebec Castors]] and [[Quebec Aces]]. Big-league hockey would not return to Quebec City until the [[Quebec Nordiques]] were founded in 1972 as part of the new [[World Hockey Association]]. They joined the NHL in 1979.

The word ''soccer'' is an abbreviation of ''association'' (from ''assoc.'') and first appeared in English private schools and universities in the 1880s (sometimes using the variant spelling \"socker\").<ref>{{OED|Soccer}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=soccer|title=Origin and meaning of soccer |website=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=The Oldhallian, vol, v\n|date=1885\n|page=171\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fPsHAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA171#v=onepage&q&f=false\n|author=The Old Hall School\n|location=Wellington, Shropshire\n|quote =The 'Varsity played Aston Villa and were beaten after a very exciting game; this was pre-eminently the most important \"Socker\" game played in Oxford this term}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|page=198\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5QbAQAAIAAJ\n|title=Baily's Magazine of Sports & Pastimes, vol. lvii\n|year=1892\n|location=London\n|publisher=Vinton\n|oclc=12030733\n}}</ref> The word is sometimes credited to [[Charles Wreford-Brown]], an [[Oxford University]] student said to have been fond of shortened forms such as ''brekkers'' for breakfast and ''rugger'' for [[rugby football]] (see [[Oxford -er]]).

The brief survey of usage below addresses places which have some level of autonomy in the sport and their own separate federation but are not actually independent countries: for example the [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and some [[British overseas territories|overseas territories]] each have their own federation and [[national team]]. Not included are places such as Cyprus, where English is widely spoken on the ground but is not amongst the country's specifically stated [[official languages]].\n\n=== Countries where it is called football ===\nAssociation football is known as \"football\" in the majority of countries where English is an official language, such as the United Kingdom, the [[Commonwealth Caribbean]] (including Trinidad and Tobago,{{efn|The nickname of the [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad & Tobago national team]], \"The [[Soca music|Soca]] Warriors\", refers to a style of music.}} Jamaica, Barbados and others), Nepal, Malta, India, Nigeria, Cameroon, Pakistan, Liberia, Singapore, Hong Kong and others, stretching over many regions including parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, the [[Caribbean]] and Central America.\n\n''Fitbaa'', ''fitba'' or ''fitbaw'' is a rendering of the [[Scots language|Scots]] pronunciation of \"football\", often used in a humorous or ironic context.\n\n=== North America ===\nIn the United States, where [[American football]] is the dominant code, the word ''football'' is used to refer only to that sport. Association football is most commonly referred to as ''soccer.''\n\nAs early as 1911 there were several names in use for the sport in the Americas. A 29 December 1911 ''New York Times'' article reporting on the addition of the game as an official collegiate sport in the US referred to it as \"association football\", \"soccer\" and \"soccer football\" all in a single article.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/12/29/104846732.pdf | work=The New York Times | title=COLLEGES TO BOOM SOCCER FOOTBALL; National Collegiate Association Gives Official Recognition to the Sport | date=29 December 1911}}</ref>\n\nThe sport's governing body is the [[United States Soccer Federation]]; however, it was originally called the ''U.S. Football Association'', and was formed in 1913 by the merger of the ''American Football Association'' and the ''American Amateur Football Association''. The word \"soccer\" was added to the name in 1945, making it the ''U.S. Soccer Football Association'', and it did not drop the word \"football\" until 1974, when it assumed its current name.\n\nIn [[Canada]], similar to the US, the term \"football\" refers to [[gridiron football]] (either [[Canadian football]] or American football; ''le football canadien'' or ''le football am\u00e9ricain'' in [[Standard French]]). \"Soccer\" is the name for association football in [[Canadian English]] (similarly, in [[Canadian French]], ''le soccer''). Likewise, in majority francophone [[Quebec]], the provincial governing body is the ''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de Soccer du Qu\u00e9bec''. This is unusual compared to other [[List of French-speaking countries|francophone countries]], where ''football'' is generally used. For example, in [[FIFA]], an acronym for the world governing body of the sport, the \"FA\" stands for ''football association'' (French for \"association football\"). Some teams based in the two countries have adopted ''FC'' as a suffix or prefix in their names; in [[Major League Soccer]]; these include [[FC Dallas]], [[Seattle Sounders FC]], [[Toronto FC]], [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC]], [[New York City FC]], [[Los Angeles FC]], and [[FC Cincinnati]].\n\nIn Central America, the only English-speaking nation is [[Belize]], and like the other six [[UNCAF|Central American]] nations, the unqualified term ''football'' refers to association football, as used in the [[Football Federation of Belize]] and in the [[Belize Premier Football League]]. The term ''soccer'' is sometimes used in vernacular speech and media coverage, however.<ref>{{cite news|title=Soccer: St. Vincentians Arrive To Take on Belize|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=20998|accessdate=September 27, 2015|work=7 News Belize|date=November 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[West Indies|Caribbean]], most of the English-speaking [[Caribbean Football Union|members]] use the word ''football'' for their federations and leagues, the exception being the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], where both federation and league use the word ''soccer''.\n\nAn exceptional case is the largely Spanish-speaking [[Puerto Rico]], where the word ''football'' is used in [[Puerto Rican Football Federation]], while the word ''soccer'' is used in [[Puerto Rico Soccer League]], the Puerto Rican 1st division; however, its 2nd division is named [[Liga Nacional de Futbol de Puerto Rico]]. ''Soccer'' is the most common term in vernacular speech, however. Another case is the Dutch island of [[Sint Maarten]], where soccer is used in [[Sint Maarten Soccer Association]], but neither ''football'' nor ''soccer'' appears in its league name.\n\n=== Australia ===\n\n{{See also|Football in Australia}}\nTraditionally, the sport has been mainly referred to as soccer in Australia.  However, in 2005, the Australia Soccer Association changed its name to [[Football Federation Australia]], and it now encourages the use of \"football\" to describe the association code in line with international practice.<ref>{{cite web | title=Soccer to become football in Australia | website=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=2004-12-17 | url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/soccer-to-become-football-in-australia-20041217-gdkbur.html | access-date=2019-09-18 | quote=ASA chairman Frank Lowy said the symbolic move would bring Australia into line with the vast majority of other countries which call the sport football.}}</ref> All state organisations, many clubs, and most media outlets<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-09-18 | archive-date=2009-02-17 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217160019/http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/about/les-murray-106369/ | url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/about/les-murray-106369/ | title=About The World Game | url-status=dead | website=SBS}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Stevenson | first=Andrew | last2=Magnay | first2=Jacquelin | title=Football raises voice over competing din | website=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=2008-02-25 | url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/football-raises-voice-over-competing-din-20080225-gds2hm.html | access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref> have followed its example.

As late as 2005, the ''New Zealand Oxford Dictionary'' suggested that in that country \"football\" referred especially to rugby union; it also noted that rugby union was commonly called \"rugby\", while rugby league was called \"league\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=Graeme D.|last2=Deverson|first2=Tony|title=The New Zealand Oxford Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Np6GAAAACAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-558493-6|location=(entries for \"football\", \"rugby\", and \"soccer\")}}</ref> A year earlier, New Zealand Soccer had reorganised its leading competition as the New Zealand Football Championship, and in 2007 it changed its own name to [[New Zealand Football]]. The wider language community appears to have embraced the new terminology\u2014influenced, among other things, by television coverage of association football in other parts of the world\u2014so that today, according to ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', \"most people no longer think or talk of rugby as 'football'.

In Quebec, the word ''football'' refers either to [[American football|American]] or [[Canadian football]], following the usage of English-speaking North America.\n* [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: ''sakk\u0101'' (\u30b5\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc) is more common than ''futtob\u014dru'' (\u30d5\u30c3\u30c8\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb)  because of American influence following World War II. While the [[Japan Football Association]] uses the word \"football\" in its official English name, the Association's Japanese name uses ''sakk\u0101''. Before the war, the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese derived term]] ''sh\u016bky\u016b'' (\u8e74\u7403, literally \"kick-ball\", ultimately deriving from the name of ''[[cuju]]'', an ancient Chinese form of football) was in common use, but as with many [[kanji]]-derived terms, it quickly fell by the wayside following the war.\n* [[Irish language|Irish]]: ''sacar''.\n* [[Manx language|Manx Gaelic]]: ''soccar'' or ''sackyr''\n*[[Swahili language|Swahili]]: ''soka''\n\n=== Other forms ===\n* [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''calcio'' (from ''calciare'', meaning ''to kick''). This is due to the game's resemblance to [[Calcio Fiorentino]], a 16th-century ceremonial [[Florence|Florentine]] court [[ritual]], that has now been revived under the name ''il calcio storico'' or ''calcio in costume'' (''historical kick'' or ''kick in costume'').\n* [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]]: ''nogomet''. In Croatian, the word is derived from \"noga\" (meaning \"leg\") and \"met\", which is a [[suffix]] derived from the word \"metati\" (meaning \"to sweep\"), hence \"sweeping the ball using legs\". In Slovene, \"noga\" has the same meaning as in Serbian, Bosnian and Croatian, while \"met\" means \"throw\", hence \"throwing (the ball) with legs\".\n* In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''futball'' or ''labdar\u00fag\u00e1s'' (meaning ''ball-kicking''), but ''foci'' is used in the common language.\n* In [[Burmese language|Burmese]], where the game was introduced in the 1880s by Sir [[James George Scott]], it is called ''ball-pwe'', a ''pwe'' being a rural all-night dance party, something like a [[rave]].\n* In [[Lao language|Lao]], the term \"\u0e9a\u0eb2\u0e99\u0ec0\u0e95\u0eb0:ban-te\", literally meaning \"ball-kicking\", is used to denote \"football\".\n* In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the terms \"b\u00f3ng \u0111\u00e1\" and \"\u0111\u00e1 banh\", both literally meaning \"kicking ball\", are used to denote \"football\".\n* In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], the term \"Sepak bola\" (''kick-ball'') is used.\n* In [[Malay language|Malay]], the term \"Bola sepak\" (''ball-kick'') is used.\n* In [[Korean language|Korean]], the [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean derived term]] ''chukku'' (\u8e74\u7403 \ucd95\uad6c {{IPA-ko|t\u0255\u02b0ukk\u0348u|}}), \"kick-ball\", is used.\n*In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], the word ''kandanda'' which has no transparent etymology, is used alongside ''mpira wa miguu'' and ''soka''.\n\n=== Other terminology ===\nAside from the name of the game itself, other foreign words based on English football terms include versions in many languages of the word ''goal'' (often ''gol'' in Romance languages). In German-speaking Switzerland, ''sch\u00fatte'' ([[Basel]]) or ''tschuutte'' ([[Z\u00fcrich]]), derived from the English ''shoot'', means 'to play football'. Also, words derived from ''kick'' have found their way into German (noun ''Kicker'') and Swedish (verb ''kicka''). In France ''le penalty'' means a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]. However, the phrase ''tir au but'' (lit. ''shot(s) on the goal'') is often used in the context of a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]]. In [[Brazilian Portuguese]], because of the pervasive presence of football in Brazilian culture, many words related to the sport have found their way into everyday language, including the verb ''chutar'' (from ''shoot'') \u2013 which originally meant \"to kick a football\", but is now the most widespread equivalent of the English verb \"to kick\". In Bulgaria a penalty kick is called duzpa (''\u0434\u0443\u0437\u043f\u0430'', from French words ''douze pas'' \u2013 twelve steps). In Italy, alongside the term ''calcio'', is often used ''pallone'' (literally ''ball'' in Italian), especially in Sicily (''u palluni'').\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Association football]]\n[[Category:Names]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=September 2012}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2012}}\nThe '''names of association football''' are the terms used to describe [[:association football]], the sport most commonly referred to in the [[English-speaking world]] as \"football\" or \"soccer\".\n\n== Background ==\nThe rules of association football were codified in the United Kingdom by the [[The Football Association|Football Association]] in 1863, and the name ''association football'' was coined in the UK to distinguish the game from the other versions of football played at the time, in particular [[rugby football]].

The brief survey of usage below addresses places which have some level of autonomy in the sport and their own separate federation but are not actually independent countries: for example the [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and some [[British overseas territories|overseas territories]] each have their own federation and [[national team]]. Not included are places such as Cyprus, where English is widely spoken on the ground but is not amongst the country's specifically stated [[official languages]].\n\n=== Countries where it is called football ===\nAssociation football is known as \"football\" in the majority of countries where English is an official language, such as the United Kingdom, the [[Commonwealth Caribbean]] (including Trinidad and Tobago,{{efn|The nickname of the [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad & Tobago national team]], \"The [[Soca music|Soca]] Warriors\", refers to a style of music.}} Jamaica, Barbados and others), Nepal, Malta, India, Nigeria, Cameroon, Pakistan, Liberia, Singapore, Hong Kong and others, stretching over many regions including parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, the [[Caribbean]] and Central America.\n\n'''[[:sco:Fitbaa|Fitbaa]]''', fitba or fitbaw, is a rendering of the [[Scots language|Scots]] pronunciation of \"football\", often used in a humorous or ironic context.\n\n=== North America ===\nIn the United States, where [[American football]] is the dominant code, the word ''football'' is used to refer only to that sport. Association football is most commonly referred to as ''soccer.''\n\nAs early as 1911 there were several names in use for the sport in the Americas. A 29 December 1911 ''New York Times'' article reporting on the addition of the game as an official collegiate sport in the US referred to it as \"association football\", \"soccer\" and \"soccer football\" all in a single article.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/12/29/104846732.pdf | work=The New York Times | title=COLLEGES TO BOOM SOCCER FOOTBALL; National Collegiate Association Gives Official Recognition to the Sport | date=29 December 1911}}</ref>\n\nThe sport's governing body is the [[United States Soccer Federation]]; however, it was originally called the ''U.S. Football Association'', and was formed in 1913 by the merger of the ''American Football Association'' and the ''American Amateur Football Association''. The word \"soccer\" was added to the name in 1945, making it the ''U.S. Soccer Football Association'', and it did not drop the word \"football\" until 1974, when it assumed its current name.\n\nIn [[Canada]], similar to the US, the term \"football\" refers to [[gridiron football]] (either [[Canadian football]] or American football; ''le football canadien'' or ''le football am\u00e9ricain'' in [[Standard French]]). \"Soccer\" is the name for association football in [[Canadian English]] (similarly, in [[Canadian French]], ''le soccer''). Likewise, in majority francophone [[Quebec]], the provincial governing body is the ''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de Soccer du Qu\u00e9bec''. This is unusual compared to other [[List of French-speaking countries|francophone countries]], where ''football'' is generally used. For example, in [[FIFA]], an acronym for the world governing body of the sport, the \"FA\" stands for ''football association'' (French for \"association football\"). Some teams based in the two countries have adopted ''FC'' as a suffix or prefix in their names; in [[Major League Soccer]]; these include [[FC Dallas]], [[Seattle Sounders FC]], [[Toronto FC]], [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC]], [[New York City FC]], [[Los Angeles FC]], and [[FC Cincinnati]].\n\nIn Central America, the only English-speaking nation is [[Belize]], and like the other six [[UNCAF|Central American]] nations, the unqualified term ''football'' refers to association football, as used in the [[Football Federation of Belize]] and in the [[Belize Premier Football League]]. The term ''soccer'' is sometimes used in vernacular speech and media coverage, however.<ref>{{cite news|title=Soccer: St. Vincentians Arrive To Take on Belize|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=20998|accessdate=September 27, 2015|work=7 News Belize|date=November 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[West Indies|Caribbean]], most of the English-speaking [[Caribbean Football Union|members]] use the word ''football'' for their federations and leagues, the exception being the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], where both federation and league use the word ''soccer''.\n\nAn exceptional case is the largely Spanish-speaking [[Puerto Rico]], where the word ''football'' is used in [[Puerto Rican Football Federation]], while the word ''soccer'' is used in [[Puerto Rico Soccer League]], the Puerto Rican 1st division; however, its 2nd division is named [[Liga Nacional de Futbol de Puerto Rico]]. ''Soccer'' is the most common term in vernacular speech, however. Another case is the Dutch island of [[Sint Maarten]], where soccer is used in [[Sint Maarten Soccer Association]], but neither ''football'' nor ''soccer'' appears in its league name.\n\n=== Australia ===\n\n{{See also|Football in Australia}}\nTraditionally, the sport has been mainly referred to as soccer in Australia.  However, in 2005, the Australia Soccer Association changed its name to [[Football Federation Australia]], and it now encourages the use of \"football\" to describe the association code in line with international practice.<ref>{{cite web | title=Soccer to become football in Australia | website=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=2004-12-17 | url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/soccer-to-become-football-in-australia-20041217-gdkbur.html | access-date=2019-09-18 | quote=ASA chairman Frank Lowy said the symbolic move would bring Australia into line with the vast majority of other countries which call the sport football.}}</ref> All state organisations, many clubs, and most media outlets<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-09-18 | archive-date=2009-02-17 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217160019/http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/about/les-murray-106369/ | url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/about/les-murray-106369/ | title=About The World Game | url-status=dead | website=SBS}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Stevenson | first=Andrew | last2=Magnay | first2=Jacquelin | title=Football raises voice over competing din | website=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=2008-02-25 | url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/football-raises-voice-over-competing-din-20080225-gds2hm.html | access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref> have followed its example.

As late as 2005, the ''New Zealand Oxford Dictionary'' suggested that in that country \"football\" referred especially to rugby union; it also noted that rugby union was commonly called \"rugby\", while rugby league was called \"league\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=Graeme D.|last2=Deverson|first2=Tony|title=The New Zealand Oxford Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Np6GAAAACAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-558493-6|location=(entries for \"football\", \"rugby\", and \"soccer\")}}</ref> A year earlier, New Zealand Soccer had reorganised its leading competition as the New Zealand Football Championship, and in 2007 it changed its own name to [[New Zealand Football]]. The wider language community appears to have embraced the new terminology\u2014influenced, among other things, by television coverage of association football in other parts of the world\u2014so that today, according to ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', \"most people no longer think or talk of rugby as 'football'.

In Quebec, the word ''football'' refers either to [[American football|American]] or [[Canadian football]], following the usage of English-speaking North America.\n* [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: ''sakk\u0101'' (\u30b5\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc) is more common than ''futtob\u014dru'' (\u30d5\u30c3\u30c8\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb)  because of American influence following World War II. While the [[Japan Football Association]] uses the word \"football\" in its official English name, the Association's Japanese name uses ''sakk\u0101''. Before the war, the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese derived term]] ''sh\u016bky\u016b'' (\u8e74\u7403, literally \"kick-ball\", ultimately deriving from the name of ''[[cuju]]'', an ancient Chinese form of football) was in common use, but as with many [[kanji]]-derived terms, it quickly fell by the wayside following the war.\n* [[Irish language|Irish]]: ''sacar''.\n* [[Manx language|Manx Gaelic]]: ''soccar'' or ''sackyr''\n*[[Swahili language|Swahili]]: ''soka''\n\n=== Other forms ===\n* [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''calcio'' (from ''calciare'', meaning ''to kick''). This is due to the game's resemblance to [[Calcio Fiorentino]], a 16th-century ceremonial [[Florence|Florentine]] court [[ritual]], that has now been revived under the name ''il calcio storico'' or ''calcio in costume'' (''historical kick'' or ''kick in costume'').\n* [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]]: ''nogomet''. In Croatian, the word is derived from \"noga\" (meaning \"leg\") and \"met\", which is a [[suffix]] derived from the word \"metati\" (meaning \"to sweep\"), hence \"sweeping the ball using legs\". In Slovene, \"noga\" has the same meaning as in Serbian, Bosnian and Croatian, while \"met\" means \"throw\", hence \"throwing (the ball) with legs\".\n* In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''futball'' or ''labdar\u00fag\u00e1s'' (meaning ''ball-kicking''), but ''foci'' is used in the common language.\n* In [[Burmese language|Burmese]], where the game was introduced in the 1880s by Sir [[James George Scott]], it is called ''ball-pwe'', a ''pwe'' being a rural all-night dance party, something like a [[rave]].\n* In [[Lao language|Lao]], the term \"\u0e9a\u0eb2\u0e99\u0ec0\u0e95\u0eb0:ban-te\", literally meaning \"ball-kicking\", is used to denote \"football\".\n* In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the terms \"b\u00f3ng \u0111\u00e1\" and \"\u0111\u00e1 banh\", both literally meaning \"kicking ball\", are used to denote \"football\".\n* In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], the term \"Sepak bola\" (''kick-ball'') is used.\n* In [[Malay language|Malay]], the term \"Bola sepak\" (''ball-kick'') is used.\n* In [[Korean language|Korean]], the [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean derived term]] ''chukku'' (\u8e74\u7403 \ucd95\uad6c {{IPA-ko|t\u0255\u02b0ukk\u0348u|}}), \"kick-ball\", is used.\n*In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], the word ''kandanda'' which has no transparent etymology, is used alongside ''mpira wa miguu'' and ''soka''.\n\n=== Other terminology ===\nAside from the name of the game itself, other foreign words based on English football terms include versions in many languages of the word ''goal'' (often ''gol'' in Romance languages). In German-speaking Switzerland, ''sch\u00fatte'' ([[Basel]]) or ''tschuutte'' ([[Z\u00fcrich]]), derived from the English ''shoot'', means 'to play football'. Also, words derived from ''kick'' have found their way into German (noun ''Kicker'') and Swedish (verb ''kicka''). In France ''le penalty'' means a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]. However, the phrase ''tir au but'' (lit. ''shot(s) on the goal'') is often used in the context of a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]]. In [[Brazilian Portuguese]], because of the pervasive presence of football in Brazilian culture, many words related to the sport have found their way into everyday language, including the verb ''chutar'' (from ''shoot'') \u2013 which originally meant \"to kick a football\", but is now the most widespread equivalent of the English verb \"to kick\". In Bulgaria a penalty kick is called duzpa (''\u0434\u0443\u0437\u043f\u0430'', from French words ''douze pas'' \u2013 twelve steps). In Italy, alongside the term ''calcio'', is often used ''pallone'' (literally ''ball'' in Italian), especially in Sicily (''u palluni'').\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Association football]]\n[[Category:Names]]\n", "name_user": "Taresantia", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_for_association_football"}

Universe 6 (from which is Kale) and Universe 7 (from which are Broly, Goku among others) are \"twin\" universes because characters and events are mirrored in a different fashion. Kale seemingly represents Universe 6's Broly, as she has a very similar transformation design as well as the powers of a \"Legendary Super Saiyan\", also known as \"Berserker\" form. Although she resembles Broly in a few ways, she has received negative reviews from fans and critics alike for being an inferior copy to the popular character and tarnishing the character's legendary reputation.<ref>{{cite web |last=Peters |first=Megan |title=Broly Who: Internet Reacts To Dragon Ball's New Legendary Super Saiyan |url=https://comicbook.com/anime/2017/06/06/dragon-ball-female-broly-kale-reaction/ |date=5 June 2017 |website=ComicBook |accessdate=9 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Peters |first=Megan |title=Did \u2018Dragon Ball Super' Just Compare Kale to Broly? |url=https://comicbook.com/anime/2017/11/01/dragon-ball-super-kale-broly-legendary-super-saiyan-anime/ |date=31 October 2017 |website=ComicBook |accessdate=9 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== Theories on Broly ==\nTheory 1: Can Broly beat Jiren?\n\nPeople would say that Broly is stronger than Jiren given the fact that that Goku and Vegeta had to fuse into Gogeta to be able to beat him. However, we will never know if this is the case or not for now until we see thee to actually fight. Plus given the fact that Goku uses a form that he mastered quicker than the Gods of destruction uses shows more proof that Jiren might be stronger than Broly. Also, what further supports this is how Jiren is stronger than his own God of Destruction which further proves that Broly is way out of his league. However, if Jiren doesn't kill him than the more damage Broly takes then the more he will keep getting stronger and will later eventually overwhelm Jiren. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/anime/2019/01/22/dragon-ball-super-broly-vs-jiren-fight-strongest-powers/|title='Dragon Ball Super: Broly' Prompts Debate Over Whether Jiren Could Beat Broly|website=Anime|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\nTheory 2: Who would win between Beerus and Broly?\n\nMany people would say the Broly can beat Beerus the God of Destruction as Goku said himself that he might be even stronger than Beerus himself. However, Dragon ball fans have pointed out that this may not be the case as it said that Beerus have only been pushed to using 70 percent of his power when he fought Goku in his Super Saiyan God form. Plus, Broly is one of those characters in Dragon Ball who doesn\u2019t think when they fight and Beerus does. However, it\u2019s confirmed that the more damage he takes the powerful he gets. So, this is another case where we don\u2019t even know who would win again. However, if some would have to suggest they would pick Beerus due to the fact that he has a move call \"Hakai\" which can erase an being from existence.\n\nTheory 3: Is Broly the reincarnation of the Legendary Super Saiyan Yamoshi? \n\nNow this is more like the case as it believed that Yamoshi use the Legendary Super Saiyan form and now just regular Super Saiyan. Plus, It is  believed that When they mean that Yamoshi was the Legendary Super Saiyan, it means that he was the first Saiyan to become Super Saiyan. However, it\u2019s not entirely proven which Super Saiyan form Yamoshi actually used but we might not get the answer to this due to the fact that that there little to no history on Yamoshi so we so far don't know who was he nor his how his life was. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-best-broly-fan-theories/|title=Dragon Ball: Best Broly Fan Theories|date=2019-06-22|website=CBR|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\nTheory 4: Can Broly beat Goku in Ultra Instant?\n\nAs far as Dragon Ball Super show us that Ultra Instant is a form that the Gods of destruction and Angels have mastered. And given that fact that Goku mastered it faster that the Gods themselves show that no Broly cannot beat Goku in Ultra Instant. To further explain why he can\u2019t be the fact in \u201cDragon Ball Super: Broly\u201d he had struggled with Goku in Super Saiyan Blue until he himself had to turn Super Saiyan as well. However, we never seen him Broly fight Goku in Super Sayian Blue Kaioken Which also further proves that we can't come with an outcome yet.  <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/dragon-ball-super-broly-goku-ultra-instinct/|title=Why Goku Didn't Use Ultra Instinct in Dragon Ball Super: Broly|date=2019-06-22|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> \n\nTheory 5: Will Broly be Goku's new Rival instead of Vegeta?\n\nThis is a theory that Has been popping into people head ever since the ending scene in the movie Dragon Ball Super: Broly. But however, it may not be the case at all. This could be another case where there will 3 characters rivaling at each other. So, this is more like the case instead of Broly just replacing Vegeta as Goku's rival. To further explain this the fact that Broly so far doesn't  really care much about fighting. He is pretty much a character that has been used as a weapon by his own father and want to have peace. Now he can be an ally to Goku and the other Z fighters. But only time will tell.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Broly_(DBS)|title=Broly (DBS)|website=Dragon Ball Wiki|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\nWhy these theories?\n\nThe reason why these theories were chosen is the fact that these are so far the most talked about involving the character. And now that his story is now connected to the main Dragon ball story. Plus, is due to the fact that this character is known to have a lot of mysteries and theories about him and people have made theories that would have been acknowledged concerning the character. Even though we only seen him in one movie there is a lot of ideas that they can use for Broly to make his character even better. We can only see what they will do with the character in later Dragon Ball stories.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Dragon Ball characters]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Dragon Ball}}\n{{Subject bar |portal1=1990s |portal2=Anime and manga |commons=y }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dragon Ball characters]]\n[[Category:Anime and manga characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Anime and manga martial artists]]\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial supervillains]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional patricides]]\n[[Category:Fictional rampage and spree killers]]\n[[Category:Male characters in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Male film villains]]\n", "name_user": "Yoshidome", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broly"}

Cruise ships also dock at Yangon.  Overland entry with a border pass is permitted at several border checkpoints. The government requires a valid passport with an entry visa for all tourists and business people. As of May 2010, foreign business visitors from any country can apply for a visa on arrival when passing through Yangon and Mandalay international airports without having to make any prior arrangements with travel agencies.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2010/news/522/news01.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621080539/http://mmtimes.com/2010/news/522/news01.html |archive-date=21 June 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Both the tourist visa and business visa are valid for 28 days, renewable for an additional 14 days for tourism and three months for business.

Even disregarding the obviously governmental fees, Burma's Minister of Hotels and Tourism Major-General [[Saw Lwin]] recently admitted that the government receives a significant percentage of the income of private sector tourism services.

The junta took steps in the early 1990s to liberalize the economy after decades of failure under the \"Burmese Way to Socialism,\" but those efforts stalled, and some of the liberalization measures were rescinded. Burma does not have monetary or fiscal stability, so the economy suffers from serious macroeconomic imbalances \u2013 including inflation, multiple official exchange rates that overvalue the Burmese kyat, and a distorted interest rate regime. Most overseas development assistance ceased after the junta began to suppress the democracy movement in 1988 and subsequently refused to honor the results of the 1990 legislative elections. In response to the government of Burma's attack in May 2003 on [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] and her convoy, the US imposed new economic sanctions against Burma \u2013 including a ban on imports of Burmese products and a ban on provision of financial services by US persons. A poor investment climate further slowed the inflow of foreign exchange. The most productive sectors will continue to be in extractive industries, especially oil and gas, mining, and timber. Other areas, such as manufacturing and services, are struggling with inadequate infrastructure, unpredictable import/export policies, deteriorating health and education systems, and corruption.

Burma has diverse and varied tourist attractions and is served internationally by numerous airlines via direct flights. Domestic and foreign airlines also operate flights within the country. Cruise ships also dock at Yangon.  Overland entry with a border pass is permitted at several border checkpoints. The government requires a valid passport with an entry visa for all tourists and business people. As of May 2010, foreign business visitors from any country can apply for a visa on arrival when passing through Yangon and Mandalay international airports without having to make any prior arrangements with travel agencies.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2010/news/522/news01.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621080539/http://mmtimes.com/2010/news/522/news01.html |archive-date=21 June 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Both the tourist visa and business visa are valid for 28 days, renewable for an additional 14 days for tourism and three months for business.

The junta's forced labour programmes were focused around tourist destinations which have been heavily criticised for their human rights records. Even disregarding the obviously governmental fees, Burma's Minister of Hotels and Tourism Major-General [[Saw Lwin]] recently admitted that the government receives a significant percentage of the income of private sector tourism services. Not to mention the fact that only a very small minority of impoverished ordinary people in Burma ever see any money with any relation to tourism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tayzathuria.org.uk/bd/2006/12/24/re.htm|title=Tayzathuria|website=Tayzathuria.org.uk|accessdate=3 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430235921/http://www.tayzathuria.org.uk/bd/2006/12/24/re.htm|archivedate=30 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBefore 2012, much of the country was completely off-limits to tourists, and the military very tightly controlled interactions between foreigners and the people of Burma. Locals were not allowed to discuss politics with foreigners, under penalty of imprisonment, and in 2001, the Myanmar Tourism Promotion Board issued an order for local officials to protect tourists and limit \"unnecessary contact\" between foreigners and ordinary Burmese people. Since 2012, Burma has opened up to more tourism and foreign capital, synonymous with the country's transition to democracy.<ref>[http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/action_holiday.html The Tourism Campaign \u2013 Campaigns \u2013 The Burma Campaign UK<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429173300/http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/action_holiday.html |date=29 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Infrastructure===\nThe Myanmar Infrastructure Summit 2018 noted that Myanmar has an urgent need to \u201cclose its infrastructure gap\u201d, with an anticipated expenditure of US$120 billion funding its infrastructural projects between now and 2030. More specifically, infrastructural development in Myanmar should address three major challenges over the upcoming years: 1) Road modernization and integration with neighboring roads and transportation networks; 2) Development of regional airports and expansion of existing airport capacity, and 3) Maintenance and consolidation of urban transport infrastructure, through instalments of innovative transportation tools including but not limited to water-taxis and air-conditioned buses.

The junta took steps in the early 1990s to liberalize the economy after decades of failure under the \"Burmese Way to Socialism,\" but those efforts stalled, and some of the liberalization measures were rescinded. Burma does not have monetary or fiscal stability, so the economy suffers from serious macroeconomic imbalances \u2013 including inflation, multiple official exchange rates that overvalue the Burmese kyat, and a distorted interest rate regime. Most overseas development assistance ceased after the junta began to suppress the democracy movement in 1988 and subsequently refused to honor the results of the 1990 legislative elections. In response to the government of Burma's attack in May 2003 on [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] and her convoy, the US imposed new economic sanctions against Burma \u2013 including a ban on imports of Burmese products and a ban on provision of financial services by US persons. A poor investment climate further slowed the inflow of foreign exchange. The most productive sectors will continue to be in extractive industries, especially oil and gas, mining, and timber. Other areas, such as manufacturing and services, are struggling with inadequate infrastructure, unpredictable import/export policies, deteriorating health and education systems, and corruption. [[2003 Myanmar Banking Crisis|A major banking crisis in 2003]] shuttered the country's 20 private banks and disrupted the economy. As of December 2005, the largest private banks operate under tight restrictions limiting the private sector's access to formal credit. Official statistics are inaccurate. Published statistics on foreign trade are greatly understated because of the size of the black market and unofficial border trade \u2013 often estimated to be as large as the official economy. Burma's trade with Thailand, China, and India is rising. Though the Burmese government has good economic relations with its neighbors, better investment and business climates and an improved political situation are needed to promote foreign investment, exports, and tourism.}} The economy saw continuous real GDP growth of at least 5% since 2009.\n\nFinancing Geothermal projects in Myanmar use an estimated break even power cost of 5.3\u20138.6 U.S cents/kWh or in Myanmar Kyat 53\u201386K per kWh.

The GAO report, entitled \"Assistance Programs Constrained in Burma,\" outlines the specific efforts of the Burmese government to hinder the humanitarian work of international organisations, including by restricting the free movement of international staff within the country.  The report notes that the regime has tightened its control over assistance work since former Prime Minister [[Khin Nyunt]] was purged in October 2004.\n\nFurthermore, the reports states that the military government passed guidelines in February 2006, which formalised Burma's restrictive policies.  According to the report, the guidelines require that programs run by humanitarian groups \"enhance and safeguard the national interest\" and that international organisations co-ordinate with state agents and select their Burmese staff from government-prepared lists of individuals.  [[United Nations]] officials have declared these restrictions unacceptable.\n\n{{quote|The shameful behavior of Burma's military regime in tying the hand of humanitarian organizations is laid out in these pages for all to see, and it must come to an end,\" said U.S. Representative [[Tom Lantos]] (D-CA).  \"In eastern Burma, where the military regime has burned or otherwise destroyed over 3,000 villages, humanitarian relief has been decimated.  At least one million people have fled their homes and many are simply being left to die in the jungle.\"}}\n\nUS Representative [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]] (R-FL) said that the report \"underscores the need for democratic change in Burma, whose military regime arbitrarily arrests, tortures, rapes and executes its own people, ruthlessly persecutes ethnic minorities, and bizarrely builds itself a new capital city while failing to address the increasingly urgent challenges of refugee flows, illicit narcotics and human trafficking, and the spread of HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Myanmar's rulers implement increasingly restrictive regulations for aid-giving agencies |newspaper=International Herald Tribune|date=19 April 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Other statistics==\n\n'''Electricity \u2013 production:'''\n5.961 billion kWh (2006 est.)\n\n'''Electricity \u2013 consumption:'''\n4.298 billion kWh (2006 est.)\n\n'''Electricity \u2013 exports:'''\n0 kWh (2007)\n\n'''Electricity \u2013 imports:'''\n0 kWh (2007)\n\n'''Agriculture \u2013 products:'''\nrice, pulses, beans, sesame, groundnuts, sugarcane; hardwood; fish and fish products\n\n'''Currency:'''\n1 [[kyat]] (K) = 100 pyas\n\n'''Exchange rates:'''\nkyats per US dollar \u2013 1,205 (2008 est.), 1,296 (2007), 1,280 (2006), 5.82 (2005), 5.7459 (2004), 6.0764 (2003)\nnote: unofficial exchange rates ranged in 2004 from 815 kyat/US dollar to nearly 970 kyat/US dollar, and by year end 2005, the unofficial exchange rate was 1,075 kyat/US dollar; data shown for 2003\u201305 are official exchange rates\n\n'''Foreign Direct Investment'''\nIn the first nine months of 2012\u20132013, Myanmar has received investment of US$794 million.

Diane Eskenazi, who is the founder of Golden Films, was the producer, director and storywriter for the film as she did the same for other animated films made by this studio. It was originally released on [[VHS]] in 1994, but it later did see a DVD release in 2003. This animated feature was released in Golden Films' Enchanted Tales collection of films.\n\n==Plot==\nTaking place in the continent between [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], the film is about an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[African Lion|lion]] named King Maximilian III, a grumpy, selfish and obnoxious king who rules the main part of the continent in an unpopular monarchy. He constantly makes preposterous laws and oppresses his subjects, though he is oblivious to how much he is hated due to how his main servants, the [[Spotted Hyena|hyena]] Chancellor (with his [[parrot]] assistant, Ricardo) and [[gorilla]] General Glump, constantly flatter and cajole towards him. Meanwhile, Max's twin brother, Irwin, who is kind and friendly, enjoys his life illustrating birds, including his pet bird, Daphne.\n\nOne day, Max falls in love with a young lioness named Leonette and demands to marry her, despite the fact that she hates him as much as anyone-else, even though the rest of her family love the king and support the idea of her marriage to him. Unfortunately, the Chancellor is also in love with her and plots to take the throne. To this end, he has been doing covert work in another part of the continent that is ruled by Emperor Raj, a [[Royal Bengal Tiger|tiger]] king who rules less land than Max. They plot to remove King Max and attack his army while they are leaderless. As a result, the Chancellor would become king and Raj would get more land. The next day, Chancellor tricks Max into bathing in the river, in where he is captured in a lion cage by zoo hunters. \n\nUpon learning of Max's capture and the Chancellor's betrayal, General Glump seeks out Irwin and asks for his help. Using his likeness, Irwin poses as Max and manages to fool the Chancellor. During his ruse, he also repeals all of Max's ludicrous laws, thus winning the hearts of the animal citizens, including Leonette. Irwin himself falls in love with her, but she finds out that Irwin is not really the king and rejects him for his lies. The Chancellor also learns of the deception and advises Raj to attack anyway since Irwin doesn't know how to lead an army. Raj agrees to this, but secretly plans to betray the Chancellor out of distrust.\n\nGeneral Glump manages to save Max from hunter's camp and they both return to find the kingdom under attack by Emperor Raj and his army. The Chancellor runs away after being betrayed and invades Leonette's home where he kidnaps her. The soldiers quickly fall into disarray due to Irwin's ineptitude, but the citizens join the fight to repay his kindness. Upon which, Max realizes how unpopular he was before. Soon enough, Max and Irwin get together and team up to fight back, forcing Raj's army into retreat. Once Raj has been defeated, Irwin rescues Leonette and defeats Chancellor, who runs away for good after being kicked by the angry Leonette. \n\nThe next day, Max changes his ways and even offers to share the monarchy with Irwin, but Irwin decides that he wants to marry Leonette, who he has reconciled with. Together they return to the jungle to get his book finished, alongside Ricardo and Daphne, who have also fallen in love.\n\n==Voice cast==\n<!---The voice cast has been uncredited, so your best bet is to guess which characters match with the voice actors.---> \n*[[Irene Cara]] as Leonette\n*[[Cam Clarke]] as Ricardo the Parrot and Emperor Raj\n*[[Townsend Coleman]] (additional voices)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Golden Films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|1125867|The Jungle King}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jungle King, The}}\n[[Category:1994 films]]\n[[Category:1994 animated films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated adventure films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about lions]]\n[[Category:Films featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:1990s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1990s fantasy adventure films]]\n\n\n{{Animated-film-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=November 2016}}\n\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = The Jungle King\n| image          =\n| director       = Diane Eskenazi\n| writer         = Diane Eskenazi <small>(story)</small> <br/> Jack Olesker \n| producer       = [[Diane Eskenazi]]\n| starring       = [[Irene Cara]]\n| editing        = Peter Grives \n| music          = John Arrias <br/> Richard Hurwitz\n| studio         = [[Golden Films]]\n| distributor    = [[Sony Wonder]]\n| released       = {{Film date|1994|06|21|North America}}\n| runtime        = 44 minutes\n| country        = United States\n| language       = [[English language|English]]\n| budget         =\n}}\n\n'''The Jungle King''' (also known as: '''Enchanted Tales: The Jungle King''') is a 1994 [[United States|American]] [[animated film|animated]] [[musical film]] that was made by [[Golden Books]]' film studio, [[Golden Films]] and distributed by [[Sony Wonder]].
