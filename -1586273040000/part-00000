It was released on June 2, 2017, by [[Hardly Art]]. With the intention of making a more serious record than their previous ones, the band finished the album after an 8-day recording session with the producer Matthew Simms. ''I Used to Spend So Much Time Alone'' was met with generally positive reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]]. Many critics called it a \"more serious\" record, with some of them hinting it included sadder aesthetics and was \"built on what [[John Keats]] defined as '[[negative capability]]'\". Two singles preceded the album's release: the lead single \"Different Now\" on March 8, 2017 and the second single \"Caught in a Lie\" on April 4, 2017. The band embarked on a North American and European tour in support of the album.\n\n==Background and recording==\nDuring the band's recording session of new material after the release of their second studio album ''[[Time to Go Home]]'' (2015), they told ''AAA Backstage'' that they have \"learned so much\" since ''Time to Go Home'', saying: \"Looking back on recording ''Time to Go Home'', I really feel like we had no idea what we were doing. We've grown so much over the past couple years, as people and musicians.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: Chastity Belt|url=http://aaabackstage.com/interview-chastity-belt/|website=Australian Music News {{!}} AAA BACKSTAGE|accessdate=15 December 2017|date=28 July 2016}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', Chastity Belt's vocalist, Julia Shapiro said: \"That's something we realized, that we don't have to play joke songs in order to have fun. We can play serious songs and still have fun with it.\" When asked about the song she is most excited for, she singled out \"Used to Spend\", then-called \"I Used to Spend So Much Time Alone\", hinting it could end up naming its parent album as well.<ref name=\"spinb\">{{cite magazine|last1=McGovern|first1=Kyle|title=Chastity Belt Aren\u2019t Afraid to Get Sentimental on Their Next Album|url=https://www.spin.com/2016/08/chastity-belt-new-album-2017-interview/|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|accessdate=15 December 2017|date=23 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith the producer Matthew Simms, the band spent 8 days in Jackpot!

He visits his high school and is overcome by memories. So, a reunion is arranged through their school WhatsApp group. At the reunion, his friends Murali (Bagavathi Perumal), Subhashini ([[Devadarshini]]) and Sathish ([[Aadukalam Murugadoss]]) catch up with him. Murali hesitantly mentions that Jaanu (Ram's childhood sweetheart) is coming from Singapore.\n\nIn 1996, Ram and Jaanu have been friends and classmates in 10th grade. Jaanu is a talented singer. Ram develops a love for Jaanu and she reciprocates. Once their board exams are over, they have a moment with each other where Jaanu asks him not to forget her until they meet again after the holidays.\n\nJaanu (Trisha) arrives at the reunion and searches for Ram. When Subha points Ram's location to her, Jaanu walks towards him. She reminisces the first day of 11th grade when she eagerly awaits Ram's arrival to the classroom, but he doesn't show up. She finds that Ram has left the school because his father had financial difficulties and his family relocated to Madras overnight. Jaanu is inconsolable and pines for Ram until she completes school.\n\nRam and Jaanu finally meet and find it uncomfortable to interact with each other, but gradually get along. Their friends talk about Jaanu's married life in Singapore and disclose that Ram is still single and has not moved on. After the reunion party, both go out on a drive. Jaanu reveals how she could not forget Ram and would have traded anything just to have met him once back then. She narrates how circumstances forced her to marry someone else. Then, Ram asks Jaanu if she really does not remember the day he came to her college to meet her. Ram says that he and Murali waited in front of Jaanu's college to meet her and passed on a message through a student. Surprisingly, Jaanu refused to meet Ram and forbade him to contact her again. He returned sadly and never tried to meet her since then. Jaanu is devastated listening to this and reveals that she never saw them at her college and thought it was her stalker who was troubling her. Ram tells that except for the mistake of assuming that she hated him, he knew everything about her life. He also tells about seeing her from afar at her wedding. Jaanu is heartbroken because she felt his presence and expected him to come for her until the last minute. Both feel sad about their misfortune and finally come to terms with everything that happened in their lives. Jaanu expresses her desire to spend the final few hours with Ram before she catches the flight back home.\n\nThey go out into the city and then to a restaurant and catch up on more memories. There, they meet Ram's photography students who assume Jaanu is his wife and request her to share their story. Jaanu obliges and narrates an improvised version of the time when Ram tried to meet Jaanu at her college. She tells about how they finally met and made up and have been together ever since and got married. Ram feels awkward but tries his best to play along. The students leave and Ram and Jaanu get wet in the rain. So he asks her to visit his apartment to freshen up.\n\nAt his apartment, Jaanu is visibly upset that Ram does not have a love life and requests him to move on and get married and have a family. She finally sings Ram's favorite song for him, a song that she had purposefully avoided singing in school in spite of his repeated requests. Ram shows Jaanu a collection of their old memories like love poems, dried flowers and their school uniforms. They realize that time is running out and go back to Jaanu's hotel to get ready for her flight in a few hours. Jaanu is sad knowing that she will leave Chennai and Ram very soon. At the airport, Ram escorts her till the boarding gate and they bid a teary farewell. Jaanu then gets into the flight and leaves.\n\nBack at his home, Ram finds Jaanu's clothes that he had put to dry the previous night. He folds them neatly, puts them along with his treasured collection of school memories and shuts the suitcase and screen cuts to black.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay Sethupathi]] as Ramachandran \"Ram\" K\n** Aadithya Bhaskar as Young Ramachandran \"Ram\" K\n* [[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]] as Janaki \"Janu\" Devi Sugumar (voiceover by [[Chinmayi]])\n** [[Gouri G Kishan]] as Young Janaki \"Janu\" Devi Sugumar\n* [[Devadarshini]] as Subhashini \"Subha\"\n** Niyathi Kadambi as Young Subhashini \"Subha\"\n* [[Janagaraj]] as Kaval Deivam, school watchman\n* [[Bagavathi Perumal]] as Murali\n** Surya as Young Murali\n* [[Rajkumar (Tamil actor)|Rajkumar]] as Surya\n* [[Aadukalam Murugadoss]] as Sathish\n** Gowtham as Young Sathish\n* [[Varsha Bollamma]] as Prabha\n* [[Kavithalaya Krishnan]] as Barber\n* Shyam Prasad as Hotel receptionist\n* [[S.

He visits his high school and is overcome by memories. So, a reunion is arranged through their school WhatsApp group. At the reunion, his friends Murali (Bagavathi Perumal), Subhashini ([[Devadarshini]]) and Sathish ([[Aadukalam Murugadoss]]) catch up with him. Murali hesitantly mentions that Jaanu (Ram's childhood sweetheart) is coming from Singapore.\n\nIn 1996, Ram and Jaanu have been friends and classmates in 10th grade. Jaanu is a talented singer. Ram develops a love for Jaanu and she reciprocates. Once their board exams are over, they have a moment with each other where Jaanu asks him not to forget her until they meet again after the holidays.\n\nJaanu (Trisha) arrives at the reunion and searches for Ram. When Subha points Ram's location to her, Jaanu walks towards him. She reminisces the first day of 11th grade when she eagerly awaits Ram's arrival to the classroom, but he doesn't show up. She finds that Ram has left the school because his father had financial difficulties and his family relocated to Madras overnight. Jaanu is inconsolable and pines for Ram until she completes school.\n\nRam and Jaanu finally meet and find it uncomfortable to interact with each other, but gradually get along. Their friends talk about Jaanu's married life in Singapore and disclose that Ram is still single and has not moved on. After the reunion party, both go out on a drive. Jaanu reveals how she could not forget Ram and would have traded anything just to have met him once back then. She narrates how circumstances forced her to get married to someone else. Then, Ram asks Jaanu if she really does not remember the day he came to her college to meet her. Ram says that he and Murali waited in front of Jaanu's college to meet her and passed on a message through a student. Surprisingly, Jaanu refused to meet Ram and forbade him to contact her again. He returned sadly and never tried to meet her since then. Jaanu is devastated listening to this and reveals that she never saw them at her college and thought it was her stalker who was troubling her. Ram tells that except for the mistake of assuming that she hated him, he knew everything about her life. He also tells about seeing her from afar at her wedding. Jaanu is heartbroken because she felt his presence and expected him to come for her until the last minute. Both feel sad about their misfortune and finally come to terms with everything that happened in their lives. Jaanu expresses her desire to spend the final few hours with Ram before she catches the flight back home.\n\nThey go out into the city and then to a restaurant and catch up on more memories. There, they meet Ram's photography students who assume Jaanu is his wife and request her to share their story. Jaanu obliges and narrates an improvised version of the time when Ram tried to meet Jaanu at her college. She tells about how they finally met and made up and have been together ever since and got married. Ram feels awkward but tries his best to play along. The students leave and Ram and Jaanu get wet in the rain. So he asks her to visit his apartment to freshen up.\n\nAt his apartment, Jaanu is visibly upset that Ram does not have a love life and requests him to move on and get married and have a family. She finally sings Ram's favorite song for him, a song that she had purposefully avoided singing in school in spite of his repeated requests. Ram shows Jaanu a collection of their old memories like love poems, dried flowers and their school uniforms. They realize that time is running out and go back to Jaanu's hotel to get ready for her flight in a few hours. Jaanu is sad knowing that she will leave Chennai and Ram very soon. At the airport, Ram escorts her till the boarding gate and they bid a teary farewell. Jaanu then gets into the flight and leaves.\n\nBack at his home, Ram finds Jaanu's clothes that he had put to dry the previous night. He folds them neatly, puts them along with his treasured collection of school memories and shuts the suitcase and screen cuts to black.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay Sethupathi]] as Ramachandran \"Ram\" K\n** Aadithya Bhaskar as Young Ramachandran \"Ram\" K\n* [[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]] as Janaki \"Janu\" Devi Sugumar (voiceover by [[Chinmayi]])\n**  [[Gouri G Kishan]] as Young Janaki \"Janu\" Devi Sugumar\n* [[Devadarshini]] as Subhashini \"Subha\"\n** Niyathi Kadambi as Young Subhashini \"Subha\"\n* [[Janagaraj]] as Kaval Deivam, school watchman\n* [[Bagavathi Perumal]] as Murali\n** Surya as Young Murali\n* [[Rajkumar (Tamil actor)|Rajkumar]] as Surya\n* [[Aadukalam Murugadoss]] as Sathish\n** Gowtham as Young Sathish\n* [[Varsha Bollamma]] as Prabha\n* [[Kavithalaya Krishnan]] as Barber\n* Shyam Prasad as Hotel receptionist\n* [[S.

[[Citric acid]] is used to [[Citric acid#Cleaning and chelating agent|soften water]] in soaps, personal care products and [[laundry detergent]]s. A commonly used synthetic chelator is [[ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid]] (EDTA), which may exist as a tetrasodium or disodium salt. Due to environmental and [[aquatic toxicity]] concerns regarding widespread use of EDTA in household and personal care products, alternatives such as sodium phytate/[[phytic acid]], tetrasodium glutamate diacetate and trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate are finding more prevalent usage.\n\n===Washing Soda Method===\nIn this method, water is treated with a calculated amount of [[washing soda]] (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.<br>\n\nCaCl<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> --> CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 2NaCl<br>\nMgSO<sub>4</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> --> MgCO<sub>3</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>\n\n=== Distillation and rain water ===\n\nSince Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> exist as nonvolatile salts, they can be removed by distilling the water.

The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> will not fit through the pores.

Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Examples are remediation of calcium scaling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arisawater.com/wp-content/uploads/2011-ASU-Study-No-Salt-Water-Conditioners.pdf |title=Evaluation of Alternatives to Domestic Ion Exchange Water Softeners |website=Arisawater.com |accessdate=2016-07-23}}</ref> and remediation of salt crusts in soil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrosmart.com.au/testimonials.html|title= Testimonials|website=Hydrosmart.com.au|accessdate=2016-07-23}}</ref> These systems do not fall within the term \"water softening\" but rather \"water conditioning\".\n\nSimilar claims for [[magnetic water treatment]] are not considered to be valid.

While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Examples are remediation of calcium scaling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arisawater.com/wp-content/uploads/2011-ASU-Study-No-Salt-Water-Conditioners.pdf |title=Evaluation of Alternatives to Domestic Ion Exchange Water Softeners |website=Arisawater.com |accessdate=2016-07-23}}</ref> and remediation of salt crusts in soil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrosmart.com.au/testimonials.html|title= Testimonials|website=Hydrosmart.com.au|accessdate=2016-07-23}}</ref> These systems do not fall within the term \"water softening\" but rather \"water conditioning\".\n\nSimilar claims for [[magnetic water treatment]] are not considered to be valid.

To become an American Red Cross lifeguard, one has to be able to complete a 550 meter swim in under 10 minutes as well as a 1/2 mile run in under 4 minutes. Recruits must complete an 8-12 week long course that is held in both the winter and summer months. The class meets every Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Sundays are grueling where recruits start their day at 8 a.m. at the pool to do the 550 meter swim along with rescues, and end the day with the training committee around 7. Tuesdays are surrounded by learning material then attending a 2 hour meeting of the general membership and staff. Thursdays focus on learning and some physical activities, but these days are rare and when done short. Throughout this course, recruits will time their run and swim and learn four rescue mechanisms that are crucial for ocean rescue. Along with the physical aspect of lifeguard training, the classes provide information and materials to learn first responder procedures in case of emergency. The class also teaches recruits about the history and upbringing of this lifesaving organization. This way they learn to value the organization and partake in the 100-year-old traditions of former members. Learning this new information can be challenging and especially the physical aspects of the class that is why recruits have mentors (lifeguards that have at least 2 years of active duty), they work together in their free time on weaknesses the recruit has. This helps teach the recruit that teamwork is the only way to get into the organization, not just from their classmates but from their soon to be coworkers. After weeks of training the last standing recruits must pass the final tests which are: pool test, black ball, and Posch run. A select few that pass their physical and practical exams in the given number of weeks, become lifeguards and graduate from their class. This results in CPR, EMR, and First Responder certifications. Which allows them to become apart of Jacksonville Beach Ocean Rescue where lifeguarding can be a full-time job. The recruit class is an important feature of the American Red Cross Volunteer Lifesaving Corps, and will remain for years to come.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Non-profit organizations based in Florida]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox company \n| name  = Jacksonville Beach Lifeguard Foundation \n| image         = Memorial Day 2014 v2.jpg\n| image_caption = American Red Cross Volunteer Life Saving Corps Station located at [[Jacksonville Beach]].\n| type  = Non-profit EIN: 59-3731804\n| foundation    = 1912\n| founders      = Lyman G.

E. Hinton]], published in [[1979 in literature|1979]]. It was adapted to the [[Tex (film)|film]] in 1982, which starred [[Matt Dillon]]. The book (like ''[[Rumble Fish (novel)|Rumble Fish]]'' and ''[[That Was Then, This Is Now]]'') takes place in the same universe as Hinton's first book ''[[The Outsiders (novel)|The Outsiders]]'', but in a [[rural]] town called Garyville, [[Oklahoma]], a fictional suburb of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]].\n\nTex and his older brother Mason live by themselves while their father tours the [[rodeo]] circuit. Tex is blissfully happy with his life.  He likes simple things and taking it easy.  Mason, on the other hand, must step into a parental role when their father is gone for five months touring rodeos. Their mother is dead, so it is just the two of them fighting to meet their financial obligations.  These boys' lives are slowly being disrupted.\n\nA [[Tex (film)|film adaptation]] was released in 1982 by Disney starring [[Matt Dillon]], [[Jim Metzler]], and [[Meg Tilly]].\n\n== Plot  ==\n\nThe book opens with Tex McCormick, a 15-year-old who loves horses, and his brother Mason (Mace), living in a small town and Jamie the girl next door. Tex is growing up mostly with Mace in a small country home. Their mother died years before, and their father goes off for months at a time leaving Mace, a senior and a star basketball player, and Tex at home. At the start of the book, Tex comes home to find the two brothers' horses sold. Negrito, Tex's horse, was considered a friend to Tex. However Mace had to sell the horses to guarantee Tex and himself would have enough to eat through the winter. This action by Mace sets Tex against his brother for most of the book.\n\nBut the McCormick brothers are not alone. Living in the significantly larger ranch house next door (about 0.5 mi (0.80 km)) are the Collinses which includes Mace\u2019s best friend Bob, Tex's best friend Johnny, and the younger sister whom Tex loves, Jamie. The Collinses, however, are forbidden to see Mason and Tex because the patriarch of the Collins family, Cole, thinks they are a bad influence.\nAfter a turn of events involving Tex and Mace's father, Tex runs away to the city with a family friend and eventually learns that just living life and staying with his brother is the best thing for him.\n\n== Characters ==\n'''Tex McCormick''': A fifteen-year-old boy. He has long golden brown hair that is the same color as his eyes and a scar over his right eyebrow from where Mason hit him. Tex has a chipped tooth and a bony face with dimples. He loves horses, especially his horse Negrito. He is a faithful, proud boy to Pop and his brother Mason. His best friend is Johnny Collins. His 17-year-old brother is Mason.\n\n'''Mason McCormick''': A seventeen-year-old boy, Pop's only biological child. He loves to fish, play basketball, and serves as a father figure to Tex. Mason is tall, fit and has black hair and brown eyes with a strong bone structure. Tex says he looks like \"a proud hawk.\" (p.&nbsp;86)\n\n'''Jamie Collins''': Johnny's younger sister. She has almost black hair and a reputation for being a mean person, hardly ever going a week without getting grounded or spanked. She uses threats to get her way and is sarcastic when she speaks to people. She is also controlling but flirty and believes passionately in women's rights.\n\n'''Johnny Collins''': Tex's best friend. They get in trouble a lot. He has jumpy blue eyes and honey blonde hair. The Collins is a rich family, unlike Tex and Mason. Johnny has a cycle, which can get them in trouble (for attempting to jump over the ditch), yet it helps them at times (transportation to school instead of taking the bus).\n\n'''Cole Collins''': Strong, Father of Blackie, Charlie, Robert (Bob), Johnny, and Jamie Collins; married to Mona Collins. Has his kids call him and Mona by their first names, which is something that Tex finds strange. He is the epitome of a strict and controlling father, one that isn't afraid to spank his kids. When Johnny and Tex get drunk at Charlie's party, he goes to where the McCormick's live and blames Tex for getting Johnny drunk. After they get in trouble at school for gluing caps on the typewriter keys, Mason and Cole have an argument, and Mason ends up winning Cole's respect for him.\n\n'''Bob Collins''': Son of Cole. Brother of Jamie and Johnny. He is the Basketball star, second to Mason. Best friend of Mason.\n\n'''Pop McCormick''': Father of Mason. Always on the rodeo tour. Leaves Mason in charge of his wife's son Tex. Loves Tex even though he is the son of another man his wife cheated on him with. Gives Tex the idea of putting 'Caps' on the typewriter keys. Pop is the ex-husband of Clare McCormick, Tex's biological mother. Pop stays away from his family a lot because of the rodeo tour, forcing him to stay away for five months.\n\n'''Lem Peters''': Friend of the family had an argument with Mason towards the end of the book. He is immature.\n\n'''Mrs. Johnson''': Tex's principal. Tex constantly gets in trouble with her. Towards the end, she made a promise to Tex that she would give him a job of horse care after catching him messing with the school typewriters.\n\n'''Cathy Carlson''': Tex's English teacher. She is revealed to be the sister of M&M from ''That Was Then, This is Now'' as she shows up at Mark's funeral.\n\n'''The Hitchhiker''': A dangerous drug dealer who has killed several other people before kidnapping Tex and Mason. Tex gets the attention of a police officer and they shoot him dead. He is revealed to be Mark from ''That Was Then, This is Now'' after escaping from prison.\n\n'''Mrs. Barnes''': A typing teacher who works at Tex's school. She is played by Hinton in the film.\n\n'''Kelly''': An immature druggie. He acts up after a drug deal with Lem went wrong. He holds Tex hostage until Tex wrestles the gun out of his arms, but not before he shoots him on his side.\n\n'''Negrito''': Tex's horse until Mason sells him along with his horse Red. Tex tries to buy him back when Pop returns but fails. He was renamed as \"Rowdy\" in the film.\n\n'''Clare McCormick''': Tex's mother. She had a fight with Pop when Tex was 2 years old and walked out in the snow without her shoes on. Tex tried to stop her, but he couldn't reach the doorknob and she later died of pneumonia.\n\n'''Red''': Mason's horse until he sells him along with Negrito. He was renamed as \"Toyota\" in the film.

Hard water is formed when water [[percolation|percolates]] through deposits of [[limestone]], [[chalk]] or [[gypsum]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wellowner.org/water-quality/ground-water-quality-basics/|title=Hard water|publisher=National Groundwater Association|access-date=28 June 2019}}</ref> which are largely made up of [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] [[carbonate]]s, [[bicarbonate]]s and [[sulfate]]s.\n\nHard [[drinking water]] may have moderate health benefits, but can pose critical problems in industrial settings, where water hardness is monitored to avoid costly breakdowns in [[boiler]]s, [[cooling tower]]s, and other equipment that handles water. In domestic settings, hard water is often indicated by a lack of [[foam]] formation when [[soap]] is agitated in water, and by the formation of [[limescale]] in kettles and water heaters.<ref name=\"who\">World Health Organization [http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/hardness.pdf Hardness in Drinking-Water], 2003</ref> Wherever water hardness is a concern, [[water softening]] is commonly used to reduce hard water's adverse effects.\n\n==Sources of hardness==\nWater's hardness is determined by the [[concentration]] of [[multivalent]] [[cations]] in the water. Multivalent cations are positively charged [[metal complex]]es with a charge greater than 1+. Usually, the cations have the charge of 2+. Common cations found in hard water include Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. These ions enter a water supply by leaching from minerals within an [[aquifer]]. Common [[calcium]]-containing minerals are [[calcite]] and [[gypsum]]. A common [[magnesium]] mineral is [[dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] (which also contains calcium). [[Rain|Rainwater]] and [[distillation|distilled]] water are [[soft water|soft]], because they contain few [[ion]]s.<ref name=Ullmann>[[Hermann Weing\u00e4rtner]], \"Water\" in [[Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry]], 2006[December], Wiley\u2013VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a28_001}}</ref>\n\nThe following [[equilibrium reaction]] describes the [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolving]] and formation of [[calcium carbonate]] and [[calcium bicarbonate]] (on the right):\n:CaCO<sub>3</sub> (s) + CO<sub>2</sub> (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l) {{eqm}} Ca<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + 2&nbsp;{{chem|HCO|3|\u2212}} (aq)\n\nThe reaction can go in either direction. Rain containing dissolved carbon dioxide can react with calcium carbonate and carry calcium ions away with it. The calcium carbonate may be re-deposited as calcite as the carbon dioxide is lost to atmosphere, sometimes forming [[stalactite]]s and [[stalagmite]]s.\n\nCalcium and magnesium ions can sometimes be removed by water softeners.<ref>Christian Nitsch, Hans-Joachim Heitland, Horst Marsen, Hans-Joachim Schl\u00fcussler, \"Cleansing Agents\" in [[Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry]] 2005, Wiley\u2013VCH, Weinheim. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a07_137}}</ref>\n\n===Temporary hardness===\n{{see also|Carbonate hardness}}\nTemporary hardness is a type of water hardness caused by the presence of [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolved]] [[bicarbonate]] [[mineral]]s ([[calcium bicarbonate]] and [[magnesium bicarbonate]]). When dissolved, these type of minerals yield calcium and magnesium [[cations]] (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>) and carbonate and [[bicarbonate]] [[anion]]s ({{chem|CO|3|2\u2212}} and {{chem|HCO|3|\u2212}}). The presence of the metal cations makes the water hard. However, unlike the [[#Permanent hardness|permanent hardness]] caused by [[sulfate]] and [[chloride]] [[compound (chemistry)|compound]]s, this \"temporary\" hardness can be reduced either by boiling the water, or by the addition of [[lime (mineral)|lime]] ([[calcium hydroxide]]) through the process of [[lime softening]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lime Softening| url=http://water.me.vccs.edu/concepts/softeninglime.html|accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> Boiling promotes the formation of carbonate from the bicarbonate and precipitates calcium carbonate out of solution, leaving water that is softer upon cooling.\n\n===Permanent hardness===\nPermanent hardness (mineral content) are generally difficult to remove by [[boiling]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sengupta|first=Pallav|date=August 2013|title=Potential Health Impacts of Hard Water|journal=[[International Journal of Preventive Medicine]]|volume=4|issue=8|pages=866\u2013875|issn=2008-7802|pmc=3775162|pmid=24049611}}</ref> If this occurs, it is usually caused by the presence of [[calcium sulfate]]/[[calcium chloride]] and/or [[magnesium sulfate]]/[[magnesium chloride]] in the water, which do not precipitate out as the [[temperature]] increases. Ions causing permanent hardness of water can be removed using a water softener, or [[ion exchange]] column.\n\n:permanent hardness = permanent calcium hardness + permanent magnesium hardness.\n\n==Effects==\nWith hard water, soap solutions form a white precipitate ([[soap scum]]) instead of producing [[Foam|lather]], because the 2+ ions destroy the [[surfactant]] properties of the soap by forming a solid precipitate (the soap scum). A major component of such scum is [[calcium stearate]], which arises from [[sodium stearate]], the main component of [[soap]]:\n:2&nbsp;C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>35</sub>COO<sup>\u2212</sup> (aq) + Ca<sup>2+</sup> (aq) \u2192 (C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>35</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>Ca (s)\nHardness can thus be defined as the soap-consuming capacity of a water sample, or the capacity of precipitation of soap as a characteristic property of water that prevents the lathering of soap. Synthetic [[detergent]]s do not form such scums.\n[[File:Eifelwasserleitung05.jpg|right|thumb|210px|A portion of the ancient Roman [[Eifel aqueduct]] in Germany. After being in service for about 180 years, the aqueduct had mineral deposits of up to {{cvt|20|cm|0}} thick along the walls.]]\n\nHard water also forms deposits that clog plumbing. These deposits, called \"[[Fouling|scale]]\", are composed mainly of [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), [[magnesium hydroxide]] (Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>), and [[calcium sulfate]] (CaSO<sub>4</sub>).<ref name=Ullmann/> Calcium and magnesium carbonates tend to be deposited as off-white solids on the inside surfaces of pipes and [[heat exchanger]]s. This precipitation (formation of an insoluble solid) is principally caused by thermal decomposition of bicarbonate ions but also happens in cases where the carbonate ion is at saturation concentration.<ref>[http://dnr.wi.gov/regulations/labcert/documents/training/basics-genchem.pdf Wisconisin DNR - Carbonate chemistry]</ref> The resulting build-up of scale restricts the flow of water in pipes. In boilers, the deposits impair the flow of heat into water, reducing the heating efficiency and allowing the metal boiler components to overheat. In a pressurized system, this overheating can lead to failure of the boiler.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chem1.com/CQ/hardwater.html |title=Hard water and water softening |accessdate=2007-10-08 |author=Stephen Lower |date=July 2007 |website= |publisher=}}</ref> The damage caused by calcium carbonate deposits varies on the crystalline form, for example, [[calcite]] or [[aragonite]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrc.org.za/Knowledge%20Hub%20Documents/Water%20SA%20Journals/Manuscripts/1998/01/WaterSA_1998_01_jan98_p77.pdf |title=Scale reduction and scale modification effects induced by Zn |accessdate=2010-03-29 |author=PP Coetzee |month= |year=1998 |website= |publisher= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509172117/http://www.wrc.org.za/Knowledge%20Hub%20Documents/Water%20SA%20Journals/Manuscripts/1998/01/WaterSA_1998_01_jan98_p77.pdf |archive-date=2016-05-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe presence of [[ion]]s in an [[electrolyte]], in this case, hard water, can also lead to [[galvanic corrosion]], in which one metal will preferentially [[corrode]] when in contact with another type of metal, when both are in contact with an electrolyte.

Calcium and magnesium hydroxides are both soluble in water. The solubility of the hydroxides of the alkaline-earth metals to which calcium and magnesium belong ([[Periodic table#Groups|group 2 of the periodic table]]) increases moving down the column. Aqueous solutions of these metal hydroxides absorb carbon dioxide from the air, forming the insoluble carbonates, giving rise to the turbidity.  This often results from the [[pH]] being excessively high (pH&nbsp;>&nbsp;7.6). Hence, a common solution to the problem is, while maintaining the chlorine concentration at the proper level, to lower the pH by the addition of hydrochloric acid, the optimum value being in the range of 7.2 to 7.6.\n\n===Softening===\n{{Main|Water softening}}\nIt is often desirable to soften hard water. Most detergents contain ingredients that counteract the effects of hard water on the surfactants. For this reason, water softening is often unnecessary. Where softening is practiced, it is often recommended to soften only the water sent to domestic hot water systems so as to prevent or delay inefficiencies and damage due to scale formation in water heaters. A common method for water softening involves the use of [[ion exchange resin]]s, which replace ions like Ca<sup>2+</sup> by twice the number of monocations such as [[sodium]] or [[potassium]] ions.\n\n[[Washing soda]] ([[sodium carbonate]], Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) is easily obtained and has long been used as a water softener for domestic laundry, in conjunction with the usual soap or detergent.\n\n===Health considerations===\nThe [[World Health Organization]] says that \"there does not appear to be any convincing evidence that water hardness causes adverse health effects in humans\".<ref name=\"who\" /> In fact, the [[United States National Research Council]] has found that hard water actually serves as a dietary supplement for calcium and magnesium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.water-research.net/hardness.htm |title=Drinking Water Hardwater Hardness Calcium Magnesium Scale Stained Laundry |publisher=Water-research.net |date= |accessdate=2013-01-26}}</ref>\n\nSome studies have shown a weak [[inverse relationship]] between water hardness and [[cardiovascular disease]] in men, up to a level of 170&nbsp;mg calcium carbonate per litre of water.

The total water hardness is the sum of the [[molar concentration]]s of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, in mol/L or mmol/L units. Although water hardness usually measures only the total concentrations of calcium and magnesium (the two most prevalent [[divalent]] metal ions), [[iron]], [[aluminium]], and [[manganese]] can also be present at elevated levels in some locations. The presence of iron characteristically confers a brownish ([[rust]]-like) colour to the calcification, instead of white (the color of most of the other compounds).\n\nWater hardness is often not expressed as a molar concentration, but rather in various units, such as degrees of general hardness ([[dGH]]), German degrees (\u00b0dH), parts per million (ppm, mg/L, or American degrees), grains per gallon (gpg), English degrees (\u00b0e, e, or [[Thomas Clark (chemist)|\u00b0Clark]]), or French degrees (\u00b0fH, \u00b0f or \u00b0HF; lowercase ''f'' is used to prevent confusion with degrees [[Fahrenheit]]).

A scale layer of CaCO<sub>3</sub> is neither precipitated nor dissolved.\n* For LSI < 0, water is under saturated and tends to dissolve solid CaCO<sub>3</sub>.\n\nIf the actual pH of the water is below the calculated saturation pH, the LSI is negative and the water has a very limited scaling potential. If the actual pH exceeds pHs, the LSI is positive, and being supersaturated with CaCO<sub>3</sub>, the water has a tendency to form scale. At increasing positive index values, the scaling potential increases.\n\nIn practice, water with an LSI between \u22120.5 and +0.5 will not display enhanced mineral dissolving or scale forming properties. Water with an LSI below \u22120.5 tends to exhibit noticeably increased dissolving abilities while water with an LSI above +0.5 tends to exhibit noticeably increased scale forming properties.\n\nThe LSI is temperature sensitive. The LSI becomes more positive as the water temperature increases. This has particular implications in situations where well water is used. The temperature of the water when it first exits the well is often significantly lower than the temperature inside the building served by the well or at the laboratory where the LSI measurement is made. This increase in temperature can cause scaling, especially in cases such as hot water heaters. Conversely, systems that reduce water temperature will have less scaling.\n:   Water Analysis:\n::        pH = 7.5\n::        TDS = 320&nbsp;mg/L\n::        Calcium = 150&nbsp;mg/L (or ppm) as CaCO<sub>3</sub>\n::        Alkalinity = 34&nbsp;mg/L (or ppm) as CaCO<sub>3</sub>\n\n:    LSI formula:\n::      LSI = pH \u2212 pH<sub>s</sub>\n::      pH<sub>s</sub> = (9.3 + A + B) \u2212 (C + D) where:\n::        A = {{sfrac|log<sub>10</sub>[TDS] \u2212 1|10}} = 0.15\n::        B = \u221213.12 \u00d7 log<sub>10</sub>(\u00b0C + 273) + 34.55 = 2.09 at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C and 1.09 at 82&nbsp;\u00b0C\n::        C = log<sub>10</sub>[Ca<sup>2+</sup> as CaCO<sub>3</sub>] - 0.4 = 1.78         \n:::           (Ca<sup>2+</sup> as CaCO<sub>3</sub> is also called calcium hardness, and is calculated as 2.5[Ca<sup>2+</sup>])\n::        D = log<sub>10</sub>[alkalinity as CaCO<sub>3</sub>] = 1.53\n\n====Ryznar Stability Index (RSI)====\nThe Ryznar stability index (RSI)<ref name=\"McTigueSymons2011\" />{{rp|525}} uses a database of scale thickness measurements in municipal water systems to predict the effect of water chemistry.<ref name=\"Reid2003\" />{{rp|72}}<ref name=\"Emerson2003\">{{cite book|last=Emerson|first=A.

Water in London, for example, is mostly obtained from the [[River Thames]] and [[River Lea]] both of which derive significant proportion of their dry weather flow from springs in limestone and chalk aquifers. [[Wales]], [[Devon]], [[Cornwall]] and parts of [[North West England|northwest England]] are softer water areas, and range from 0 to 200 ppm.<ref>[http://www.anglianwater.co.uk/_assets/media/Hard_Water_Bro_16-3-09_12PP.pdf anglianwater.co.uk]</ref> In the [[brewing]] industry in England and Wales, water is often deliberately hardened with [[gypsum]] in the process of [[Burtonisation]].\n\nGenerally water is mostly hard in urban areas of England where soft water sources are unavailable. A number of cities built water supply sources in the 18th century as the [[industrial revolution]] and urban population burgeoned. [[Manchester]] was a notable such city in North West England and its wealthy corporation built a number of reservoirs at [[Thirlmere]] and [[Haweswater]] in the [[Lake District]] to the north. There is no exposure to [[limestone]] or [[chalk]] in their [[headwaters]] and consequently the water in Manchester is rated as 'very soft'.<ref name=\"manchester\"/> Similarly, tap water in [[Birmingham]] is also soft as it is sourced from the [[Elan Valley Reservoirs]] in Wales, even though groundwater in the area is hard.\n\n=== In Ireland ===\nThe EPA has published a standards handbook for the interpretation of water quality in Ireland in which definitions of water hardness are given.<ref>Section 36 \"Hardness\" https://www.epa.ie/pubs/advice/water/quality/Water_Quality.pdf</ref>\nIn this section, reference to original EU documentation is given, which sets out no limit for hardness.\nIn turn, the handbook also gives no \"Recommended or Mandatory Limit Values\" for hardness.\nThe handbooks does indicate that above the midpoint of the ranges defined as \"Moderately Hard\", effects are seen increasingly: \"The chief disadvantages of hard waters are that they neutralise the lathering power of soap.... and, more important, that they can cause blockage of pipes and severely reduced boiler efficiency because of scale formation. These effects will increase as the hardness rises to and beyond 200 mg/l CaCO3.\"\n\n=== In the United States ===\nA collection of data from the United States found that about half the water stations tested had hardness over 120&nbsp;mg per litre of calcium carbonate equivalent, placing them in the categories \"hard\" or \"very hard\".<ref name=USGS/> The other half were classified as soft or moderately hard.

Multivalent cations are positively charged [[metal complex]]es with a charge greater than 1+. Usually, the cations have the charge of 2+. Common cations found in hard water include Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. These ions enter a water supply by leaching from minerals within an [[aquifer]]. Common [[calcium]]-containing minerals are [[calcite]] and [[gypsum]]. A common [[magnesium]] mineral is [[dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] (which also contains calcium). [[Rain|Rainwater]] and [[distillation|distilled]] water are [[soft water|soft]], because they contain few [[ion]]s.<ref name=Ullmann>[[Hermann Weing\u00e4rtner]], \"Water\" in [[Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry]], 2006[December], Wiley\u2013VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a28_001}}</ref>\n\nThe following [[equilibrium reaction]] describes the [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolving]] and formation of [[calcium carbonate]] and [[calcium bicarbonate]] (on the right):\n:CaCO<sub>3</sub> (s) + CO<sub>2</sub> (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l) {{eqm}} Ca<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + 2&nbsp;{{chem|HCO|3|\u2212}} (aq)\n\nThe reaction can go in either direction. Rain containing dissolved carbon dioxide can react with calcium carbonate and carry calcium ions away with it. The calcium carbonate may be re-deposited as calcite as the carbon dioxide is lost to atmosphere, sometimes forming [[stalactite]]s and [[stalagmite]]s.\n\nCalcium and magnesium ions can sometimes be removed by water softeners.<ref>Christian Nitsch, Hans-Joachim Heitland, Horst Marsen, Hans-Joachim Schl\u00fcussler, \"Cleansing Agents\" in [[Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry]] 2005, Wiley\u2013VCH, Weinheim. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a07_137}}</ref>\n\n===Temporary hardness===\n{{see also|Carbonate hardness}}\nTemporary hardness is a type of water hardness caused by the presence of [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolved]] [[bicarbonate]] [[mineral]]s ([[calcium bicarbonate]] and [[magnesium bicarbonate]]). When dissolved, these type of minerals yield calcium and magnesium [[cations]] (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>) and carbonate and [[bicarbonate]] [[anion]]s ({{chem|CO|3|2\u2212}} and {{chem|HCO|3|\u2212}}). The presence of the metal cations makes the water hard. However, unlike the [[#Permanent hardness|permanent hardness]] caused by [[sulfate]] and [[chloride]] [[compound (chemistry)|compound]]s, this \"temporary\" hardness can be reduced either by boiling the water, or by the addition of [[lime (mineral)|lime]] ([[calcium hydroxide]]) through the process of [[lime softening]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lime Softening| url=http://water.me.vccs.edu/concepts/softeninglime.html|accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> Boiling promotes the formation of carbonate from the bicarbonate and precipitates calcium carbonate out of solution, leaving water that is softer upon cooling.\n\n===Permanent hardness===\nPermanent hardness (mineral content) are generally difficult to remove by [[boiling]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sengupta|first=Pallav|date=August 2013|title=Potential Health Impacts of Hard Water|journal=[[International Journal of Preventive Medicine]]|volume=4|issue=8|pages=866\u2013875|issn=2008-7802|pmc=3775162|pmid=24049611}}</ref> If this occurs, it is usually caused by the presence of [[calcium sulfate]]/[[calcium chloride]] and/or [[magnesium sulfate]]/[[magnesium chloride]] in the water, which do not precipitate out as the [[temperature]] increases. Ions causing permanent hardness of water can be removed using a water softener, or [[ion exchange]] column.\n\n:permanent hardness = permanent calcium hardness + permanent magnesium hardness.\n\n==Effects==\nWith hard water, soap solutions form a white precipitate ([[soap scum]]) instead of producing [[Foam|lather]], because the 2+ ions destroy the [[surfactant]] properties of the soap by forming a solid precipitate (the soap scum). A major component of such scum is [[calcium stearate]], which arises from [[sodium stearate]], the main component of [[soap]]:\n:2&nbsp;C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>35</sub>COO<sup>\u2212</sup> (aq) + Ca<sup>2+</sup> (aq) \u2192 (C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>35</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>Ca (s)\nHardness can thus be defined as the soap-consuming capacity of a water sample, or the capacity of precipitation of soap as a characteristic property of water that prevents the lathering of soap. Synthetic [[detergent]]s do not form such scums.\n[[File:Eifelwasserleitung05.jpg|right|thumb|210px|A portion of the ancient Roman [[Eifel aqueduct]] in Germany. After being in service for about 180 years, the aqueduct had mineral deposits of up to {{cvt|20|cm|0}} thick along the walls.]]\n\nHard water also forms deposits that clog plumbing. These deposits, called \"[[Fouling|scale]]\", are composed mainly of [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), [[magnesium hydroxide]] (Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>), and [[calcium sulfate]] (CaSO<sub>4</sub>).<ref name=Ullmann/> Calcium and magnesium carbonates tend to be deposited as off-white solids on the inside surfaces of pipes and [[heat exchanger]]s. This precipitation (formation of an insoluble solid) is principally caused by thermal decomposition of bicarbonate ions but also happens in cases where the carbonate ion is at saturation concentration.<ref>[http://dnr.wi.gov/regulations/labcert/documents/training/basics-genchem.pdf Wisconisin DNR - Carbonate chemistry]</ref> The resulting build-up of scale restricts the flow of water in pipes. In boilers, the deposits impair the flow of heat into water, reducing the heating efficiency and allowing the metal boiler components to overheat. In a pressurized system, this overheating can lead to failure of the boiler.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chem1.com/CQ/hardwater.html |title=Hard water and water softening |accessdate=2007-10-08 |author=Stephen Lower |date=July 2007 |website= |publisher=}}</ref> The damage caused by calcium carbonate deposits varies on the crystalline form, for example, [[calcite]] or [[aragonite]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrc.org.za/Knowledge%20Hub%20Documents/Water%20SA%20Journals/Manuscripts/1998/01/WaterSA_1998_01_jan98_p77.pdf |title=Scale reduction and scale modification effects induced by Zn |accessdate=2010-03-29 |author=PP Coetzee |month= |year=1998 |website= |publisher= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509172117/http://www.wrc.org.za/Knowledge%20Hub%20Documents/Water%20SA%20Journals/Manuscripts/1998/01/WaterSA_1998_01_jan98_p77.pdf |archive-date=2016-05-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe presence of [[ion]]s in an [[electrolyte]], in this case, hard water, can also lead to [[galvanic corrosion]], in which one metal will preferentially [[corrode]] when in contact with another type of metal, when both are in contact with an electrolyte.

Calcium and magnesium hydroxides are both soluble in water. The solubility of the hydroxides of the alkaline-earth metals to which calcium and magnesium belong ([[Periodic table#Groups|group 2 of the periodic table]]) increases moving down the column. Aqueous solutions of these metal hydroxides absorb carbon dioxide from the air, forming the insoluble carbonates, giving rise to the turbidity.  This often results from the [[pH]] being excessively high (pH&nbsp;>&nbsp;7.6). Hence, a common solution to the problem is, while maintaining the chlorine concentration at the proper level, to lower the pH by the addition of hydrochloric acid, the optimum value being in the range of 7.2 to 7.6.\n\n===Softening===\n{{Main|Water softening}}\nIt is often desirable to soften hard water. Most detergents contain ingredients that counteract the effects of hard water on the surfactants. For this reason, water softening is often unnecessary. Where softening is practiced, it is often recommended to soften only the water sent to domestic hot water systems so as to prevent or delay inefficiencies and damage due to scale formation in water heaters. A common method for water softening involves the use of [[ion exchange resin]]s, which replace ions like Ca<sup>2+</sup> by twice the number of monocations such as [[sodium]] or [[potassium]] ions.\n\n[[Washing soda]] ([[sodium carbonate]], Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) is easily obtained and has long been used as a water softener for domestic laundry, in conjunction with the usual soap or detergent.\n\n===Health considerations===\nThe [[World Health Organization]] says that \"there does not appear to be any convincing evidence that water hardness causes adverse health effects in humans\".<ref name=\"who\" /> In fact, the [[United States National Research Council]] has found that hard water actually serves as a dietary supplement for calcium and magnesium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.water-research.net/hardness.htm |title=Drinking Water Hardwater Hardness Calcium Magnesium Scale Stained Laundry |publisher=Water-research.net |date= |accessdate=2013-01-26}}</ref>\n\nSome studies have shown a weak [[inverse relationship]] between water hardness and [[cardiovascular disease]] in men, up to a level of 170&nbsp;mg calcium carbonate per litre of water.

The total water hardness is the sum of the [[molar concentration]]s of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, in mol/L or mmol/L units. Although water hardness usually measures only the total concentrations of calcium and magnesium (the two most prevalent [[divalent]] metal ions), [[iron]], [[aluminium]], and [[manganese]] can also be present at elevated levels in some locations. The presence of iron characteristically confers a brownish ([[rust]]-like) colour to the calcification, instead of white (the color of most of the other compounds).\n\nWater hardness is often not expressed as a molar concentration, but rather in various units, such as degrees of general hardness ([[dGH]]), German degrees (\u00b0dH), parts per million (ppm, mg/L, or American degrees), grains per gallon (gpg), English degrees (\u00b0e, e, or [[Thomas Clark (chemist)|\u00b0Clark]]), or French degrees (\u00b0fH, \u00b0f or \u00b0HF; lowercase ''f'' is used to prevent confusion with degrees [[Fahrenheit]]). The table below shows conversion factors between the various units.\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Hardness unit conversion.\n|-\n!  || 1&nbsp;mmol/L || 1 ppm, mg/L || 1 dGH, \u00b0dH || 1 gpg || 1 \u00b0e, \u00b0Clark || 1 \u00b0fH\n|-\n! mmol/L  \n| 1        || 0.009991 || 0.1783   || 0.171    || 0.1424   || 0.09991   \n|-\n! ppm, mg/L    \n| 100.1    || 1        || 17.85    || 17.12    || 14.25    ||10\n|-\n! dGH, \u00b0dH\n| 5.608    || 0.05603  || 1        || 0.9591   || 0.7986   || 0.5603    \n|-\n! gpg     \n| 5.847    || 0.05842  || 1.043    || 1        || 0.8327   || 0.5842    \n|-\n! \u00b0e, \u00b0Clark\n| 7.022    || 0.07016  || 1.252    || 1.201    || 1        || 0.7016    \n|-\n! \u00b0fH     \n| 10.01    ||0.1|| 1.785    || 1.712    || 1.425    || 1         \n|}\nThe various alternative units represent an equivalent mass of calcium oxide (CaO) or calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) that, when dissolved in a unit volume of pure water, would result in the same total molar concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The different conversion factors arise from the fact that equivalent masses of calcium oxide and calcium carbonates differ, and that different mass and volume units are used. The units are as follows:\n* ''Parts per million (ppm)'' is usually defined as 1&nbsp;mg/L CaCO<sub>3</sub> (the definition used below).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekrib.com/Plants/CO2/hardness-larryfrank.html|title=Water Hardness|work=thekrib.com}}</ref> It is equivalent to '''mg/L''' without chemical compound specified, and to '''American degree'''.\n* ''[[Grains per Gallon]] (gpg)'' is defined as 1 [[Grain (measure)|grain]] (64.8&nbsp;mg) of calcium carbonate per [[U.S. gallon]] (3.79 litres), or 17.118 ppm.\n* a ''mmol/L'' is equivalent to 100.09&nbsp;mg/L CaCO<sub>3</sub> or 40.08&nbsp;mg/L Ca<sup>2+</sup>.\n* A ''degree of General Hardness ([[dGH]]'' or 'German degree (\u00b0dH, ''deutsche H\u00e4rte''))' is defined as 10&nbsp;mg/L CaO or 17.848 ppm.\n* A ''Clark degree (\u00b0Clark)'' or ''English degrees (\u00b0e or e)'' is defined as one [[Grain (measure)|grain]] (64.8&nbsp;mg) of CaCO<sub>3</sub> per [[Imperial gallon]] (4.55 litres) of water, equivalent to 14.254 ppm.\n* A ''French degree (\u00b0fH or \u00b0f)'' is defined as 10&nbsp;mg/L CaCO<sub>3</sub>, equivalent to 10 ppm.\n\n===Hard/soft classification===\nAs it is the precise mixture of minerals dissolved in the water, together with the water's [[pH]] and temperature, that determine the behavior of the hardness, a single-number scale does not adequately describe hardness.

A scale layer of CaCO<sub>3</sub> is neither precipitated nor dissolved.\n* For LSI < 0, water is under saturated and tends to dissolve solid CaCO<sub>3</sub>.\n\nIf the actual pH of the water is below the calculated saturation pH, the LSI is negative and the water has a very limited scaling potential. If the actual pH exceeds pHs, the LSI is positive, and being supersaturated with CaCO<sub>3</sub>, the water has a tendency to form scale. At increasing positive index values, the scaling potential increases.\n\nIn practice, water with an LSI between \u22120.5 and +0.5 will not display enhanced mineral dissolving or scale forming properties. Water with an LSI below \u22120.5 tends to exhibit noticeably increased dissolving abilities while water with an LSI above +0.5 tends to exhibit noticeably increased scale forming properties.\n\nThe LSI is temperature sensitive. The LSI becomes more positive as the water temperature increases. This has particular implications in situations where well water is used. The temperature of the water when it first exits the well is often significantly lower than the temperature inside the building served by the well or at the laboratory where the LSI measurement is made. This increase in temperature can cause scaling, especially in cases such as hot water heaters. Conversely, systems that reduce water temperature will have less scaling.\n:   Water Analysis:\n::        pH = 7.5\n::        TDS = 320&nbsp;mg/L\n::        Calcium = 150&nbsp;mg/L (or ppm) as CaCO<sub>3</sub>\n::        Alkalinity = 34&nbsp;mg/L (or ppm) as CaCO<sub>3</sub>\n\n:    LSI formula:\n::      LSI = pH \u2212 pH<sub>s</sub>\n::      pH<sub>s</sub> = (9.3 + A + B) \u2212 (C + D) where:\n::        A = {{sfrac|log<sub>10</sub>[TDS] \u2212 1|10}} = 0.15\n::        B = \u221213.12 \u00d7 log<sub>10</sub>(\u00b0C + 273) + 34.55 = 2.09 at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C and 1.09 at 82&nbsp;\u00b0C\n::        C = log<sub>10</sub>[Ca<sup>2+</sup> as CaCO<sub>3</sub>] - 0.4 = 1.78         \n:::           (Ca<sup>2+</sup> as CaCO<sub>3</sub> is also called calcium hardness, and is calculated as 2.5[Ca<sup>2+</sup>])\n::        D = log<sub>10</sub>[alkalinity as CaCO<sub>3</sub>] = 1.53\n\n====Ryznar Stability Index (RSI)====\nThe Ryznar stability index (RSI)<ref name=\"McTigueSymons2011\" />{{rp|525}} uses a database of scale thickness measurements in municipal water systems to predict the effect of water chemistry.<ref name=\"Reid2003\" />{{rp|72}}<ref name=\"Emerson2003\">{{cite book|last=Emerson|first=A.

Water in London, for example, is mostly obtained from the [[River Thames]] and [[River Lea]] both of which derive significant proportion of their dry weather flow from springs in limestone and chalk aquifers. [[Wales]], [[Devon]], [[Cornwall]] and parts of [[North West England|northwest England]] are softer water areas, and range from 0 to 200 ppm.<ref>[http://www.anglianwater.co.uk/_assets/media/Hard_Water_Bro_16-3-09_12PP.pdf anglianwater.co.uk]</ref> In the [[brewing]] industry in England and Wales, water is often deliberately hardened with [[gypsum]] in the process of [[Burtonisation]].\n\nGenerally water is mostly hard in urban areas of England where soft water sources are unavailable. A number of cities built water supply sources in the 18th century as the [[industrial revolution]] and urban population burgeoned. [[Manchester]] was a notable such city in North West England and its wealthy corporation built a number of reservoirs at [[Thirlmere]] and [[Haweswater]] in the [[Lake District]] to the north. There is no exposure to [[limestone]] or [[chalk]] in their [[headwaters]] and consequently the water in Manchester is rated as 'very soft'.<ref name=\"manchester\"/> Similarly, tap water in [[Birmingham]] is also soft as it is sourced from the [[Elan Valley Reservoirs]] in Wales, even though groundwater in the area is hard.\n\n=== In Ireland ===\nThe EPA has published a standards handbook for the interpretation of water quality in Ireland in which definitions of water hardness are given.<ref>Section 36 \"Hardness\" https://www.epa.ie/pubs/advice/water/quality/Water_Quality.pdf</ref>\nIn this section, reference to original EU documentation is given, which sets out no limit for hardness.\nIn turn, the handbook also gives no \"Recommended or Mandatory Limit Values\" for hardness.\nThe handbooks does indicate that above the midpoint of the ranges defined as \"Moderately Hard\", effects are seen increasingly: \"The chief disadvantages of hard waters are that they neutralise the lathering power of soap.... and, more important, that they can cause blockage of pipes and severely reduced boiler efficiency because of scale formation. These effects will increase as the hardness rises to and beyond 200 mg/l CaCO3.\"\n\n=== In the United States ===\nA collection of data from the United States found that about half the water stations tested had hardness over 120&nbsp;mg per litre of calcium carbonate equivalent, placing them in the categories \"hard\" or \"very hard\".<ref name=USGS/> The other half were classified as soft or moderately hard. More than 85% of American homes have hard water.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Amber |last2=Parrott |first2=Kathleen |last3=Ross |first3=Blake |title=Household Water Quality \u2013 Water Hardness |url=http://www.aquasafecanada.com/mirror/household-water-quality-water-hardness.htm |date=June 1999 |accessdate=2009-04-26}}</ref> The softest waters occur in parts of the [[New England]], South Atlantic-Gulf, [[Pacific Northwest]], and [[Hawaii]] regions. Moderately hard waters are common in many of the rivers of the [[Tennessee]], [[Great Lakes]], and Alaska regions. Hard and very hard waters are found in some of the streams in most of the regions throughout the country. The hardest waters (greater than 1,000 ppm) are in streams in Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, Arizona, Utah, parts of Colorado, southern Nevada, and southern California.<ref>Briggs, J.C., and Ficke, J.F.; ''Quality of Rivers of the United States, 1975 Water Year -- Based on the National Stream Quality Accounting Network (NASQAN)'': U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 78-200, 436 p.
