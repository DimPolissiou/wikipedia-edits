''Aircraft'' includes [[airplane|fixed-wing]] and [[helicopter|rotary-wing]] types, morphable wings, wing-less lifting bodies, as well as [[aerostat|lighter-than-air craft]] such as [[Balloon (aeronautics)|hot air balloons]] and [[airship]]s.\n\nAviation began in the 18th century with the development of the [[hot air balloon]], an apparatus capable of atmospheric displacement through [[buoyancy]]. Some of the most significant advancements in aviation technology came with the controlled gliding flying of [[Otto Lilienthal]] in 1896; then a large step in significance came with the construction of the first powered airplane by the [[Wright brothers]] in the early 1900s. Since that time, aviation has been technologically revolutionized by the introduction of the [[jet aircraft|jet]] which permitted a major form of transport throughout the world.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''aviation'' was coined by the French writer and former naval officer Gabriel La Landelle in 1863.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_pA9-D4QETAoC#page/n7/mode/2up|title=Aviation ou Navigation aerienne par G. de La Landelle}}</ref> He derived the term from the verb ''avier'' (an unsuccessful [[neologism]] for \"to fly\"), itself derived from the Latin word ''avis'' (\"bird\") and the suffix ''-ation''.{{sfn|Cassard|2008|p=77}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of aviation}}\n\n===Early beginnings===\n\nThere are early legends of human flight such as the stories of [[Icarus]] in Greek myth, [[Jamshid]] and [[Shah]] [[Kay K\u0101vus]] in Persian myth,<ref>''The Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma of Firdaus\u00ed''. Vol. II. (1906), pp. 103-104, verse 111. Translated by Arthur George Warner and Edmond Warner. London. Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner & Co. Ltd</ref> and the flying automaton of [[Archytas]] of [[Taranto|Tarentum]] (428\u2013347 BC).{{sfn|Berliner|1996|p=28}} Later, somewhat more credible claims of short-distance human flights appear, such as the winged flights of [[Abbas ibn Firnas]] (810\u2013887), [[Eilmer of Malmesbury]] (11th century), and the hot-air Passarola of [[Bartholomeu Louren\u00e7o de Gusm\u00e3o]] (1685\u20131724).\n\n===Lighter than air===\n[[File:Hindenburg at lakehurst.jpg|thumb|[[LZ 129 Hindenburg]] at [[Lakehurst Naval Air Station]], 1936]]\nThe modern age of aviation began with the first untethered human lighter-than-air flight on November 21, 1783, of a [[hot air balloon]] designed by the [[Montgolfier brothers]]. The practicality of balloons was limited because they could only travel downwind. It was immediately recognized that a steerable, or [[Airship|dirigible]], balloon was required. [[Jean-Pierre Blanchard]] flew the first human-powered dirigible in 1784 and crossed the English Channel in one in 1785.\n\n[[Rigid airship]]s became the first aircraft to transport passengers and cargo over great distances. The best known aircraft of this type were manufactured by the German [[Zeppelin]] company.\n\nThe most successful Zeppelin was the [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]. It flew over one million miles, including an around-the-world flight in August 1929. However, the dominance of the Zeppelins over the airplanes of that period, which had a range of only a few hundred miles, was diminishing as airplane design advanced. The \"Golden Age\" of the airships ended on May 6, 1937 when the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] caught fire, killing 36 people. The cause of the Hindenburg accident was initially blamed on the use of hydrogen instead of helium as the lift gas. An internal investigation by the manufacturer revealed that the coating used in the material covering the frame was highly flammable and allowed static electricity to build up in the airship.{{sfn|De Angelis|1997|pages=87\u2013101}} Changes to the coating formulation reduced the risk of further Hindenburg type accidents. Although there have been periodic initiatives to revive their use, airships have seen only niche application since that time.\n\n===Heavier than air===\nIn 1799, Sir [[George Cayley]] set forth the concept of the modern airplane as a fixed-wing flying machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control.<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Aviation History\n |url         = http://www.aviation-history.com/early/cayley.htm\n |accessdate  = 2009-07-26\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090413155148/http://aviation-history.com/early/cayley.htm\n |archivedate = 2009-04-13\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |title       = Sir George Carley (British Inventor and Scientist)\n |url         = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100795/Sir-George-Cayley-6th-Baronet\n |encyclopedia   = Britannica\n |accessdate  = 2009-07-26\n |quote       = English pioneer of aerial navigation and aeronautical engineering and designer of the first successful glider to carry a human being aloft.\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090311002545/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100795/Sir-George-Cayley-6th-Baronet\n |archivedate = 2009-03-11\n}}</ref> Early dirigible developments included machine-powered propulsion ([[Henri Giffard]], 1852), rigid frames ([[David Schwarz (aviation inventor)|David Schwarz]], 1896) and improved speed and maneuverability ([[Alberto Santos-Dumont]], 1901)\n\n[[File:First flight2.jpg|thumb|First powered and controlled flight by the [[Wright brothers]], December 17, 1903]]\nThere are [[Early flying machines|many competing claims]] for the earliest powered, heavier-than-air flight.

One of the most successful designs of this period was the [[Douglas DC-3]], which became the first [[airliner]] to be profitable carrying passengers exclusively, starting the modern era of passenger airline service. By the beginning of World War II, many towns and cities had built airports, and there were numerous qualified pilots available. The war brought many innovations to aviation, including the first [[turbojet|jet]] aircraft and the first liquid-fueled [[rocket]]s.\n\n[[File:Helios cthomas.jpg|thumb|left|[[NASA]]'s [[Helios Prototype|Helios]] researches [[solar power]]ed flight.]]\nAfter World War II, especially in North America, there was a boom in [[general aviation]], both private and commercial, as thousands of pilots were released from military service and many inexpensive war-surplus transport and training aircraft became available. Manufacturers such as [[Cessna]], [[Piper Aircraft|Piper]], and [[Beechcraft]] expanded production to provide light aircraft for the new middle-class market.\n\nBy the 1950s, the development of civil jets grew, beginning with the [[de Havilland Comet]], though the first widely used passenger jet was the [[Boeing 707]], because it was much more economical than other aircraft at that time. At the same time, [[gas turbine|turboprop]] propulsion began to appear for smaller commuter planes, making it possible to serve small-volume routes in a much wider range of weather conditions.\n\nSince the 1960s [[composite material]] airframes and quieter, more efficient engines have become available, and [[Concorde]] provided [[supersonic transport|supersonic passenger service]] for more than two decades, but the most important lasting innovations have taken place in instrumentation and control. The arrival of [[transistor|solid-state]] electronics, the [[Global Positioning System]], [[communications satellite|satellite communications]], and increasingly small and powerful computers and [[light-emitting diode|LED]] displays, have dramatically changed the cockpits of [[airliner]]s and, increasingly, of smaller aircraft as well. Pilots can navigate much more accurately and view terrain, obstructions, and other nearby aircraft on a map or through [[synthetic vision]], even at night or in low visibility.\n\nOn June 21, 2004, [[SpaceShipOne]] became the first privately funded aircraft to make a [[spaceflight]], opening the possibility of an aviation market capable of leaving the Earth's atmosphere. Meanwhile, flying prototypes of aircraft powered by alternative fuels, such as [[ethanol]], [[electricity]], and even [[solar energy]], are becoming more common.\n\n==Operations of aircraft==\n\n===Civil aviation===\n{{Main|Civil aviation}} \nCivil aviation includes all non-military flying, both [[general aviation]] and [[scheduled air transport]].\n\n====Air transport====\n{{Main|Airline}}\n[[File:Northwest Airlines A330-323 (N805NW) landing at London Gatwick Airport.jpg|thumb|right|[[Northwest Airlines]] [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-323]]]]\n\nThere are five major manufacturers of civil transport aircraft (in alphabetical order):\n* [[Airbus]], based in Europe\n* [[Boeing]], based in the United States\n* [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]], based in Canada\n* [[Embraer]], based in Brazil\n* [[United Aircraft Corporation]], based in Russia\n\nBoeing, Airbus, [[Ilyushin]] and [[Tupolev]] concentrate on wide-body and narrow-body jet [[airliner]]s, while Bombardier, Embraer and [[Sukhoi]] concentrate on [[regional airliner]]s.

Since then, [[open skies]] agreements have resulted in increased competition and choice for consumers, coupled with falling prices for airlines. The combination of high fuel prices, low fares, high salaries, and crises such as the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS epidemic]] have driven many older airlines to government-bailouts, bankruptcy or mergers. At the same time, [[low-cost carrier]]s such as [[Ryanair]], [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]] and [[WestJet]] have flourished.\n\n====General aviation====\n{{Main|General aviation}}\n[[File:cessna.120.g-btbw.arp.jpg|thumb|right|1947 [[Cessna 120]]]]\n\n''General aviation'' includes all non-scheduled civil flying, both [[private aviation|private]] and [[commercial aviation|commercial]]. General aviation may include business flights, [[air charter]], private aviation, flight training, [[hot air balloon|ballooning]], [[paragliding]], [[parachuting]], [[Glider (sailplane)|gliding]], [[hang gliding]], [[aerial photography]], [[powered hang glider|foot-launched powered hang gliders]], air ambulance, crop dusting, charter flights, [[traffic reporting]], police air patrols and forest fire fighting.\n\nEach country regulates aviation differently, but general aviation usually falls under different regulations depending on whether it is private or commercial and on the type of equipment involved.\n\nMany small aircraft manufacturers serve the general aviation market, with a focus on private aviation and flight training.\n\nThe most important recent developments for small aircraft (which form the bulk of the GA fleet) have been the introduction of advanced [[avionics]] (including [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) that were formerly found only in large [[airliner]]s, and the introduction of [[composite material]]s to make small aircraft lighter and faster. [[Ultralight aviation|Ultralight]] and [[homebuilt aircraft]] have also become increasingly popular for recreational use, since in most countries that allow private aviation, they are much less expensive and less heavily regulated than certified aircraft.\n\n===Military aviation===\n{{Main|Military aviation|Aerial warfare}}\nSimple [[balloon (aeronautics)|balloons]] were used as surveillance aircraft as early as the 18th century. Over the years, [[military aircraft]] have been built to meet ever increasing capability requirements. Manufacturers of military aircraft compete for contracts to supply their government's arsenal. Aircraft are selected based on factors like cost, performance, and the speed of production.\n[[File:Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.jpg|thumb|The [[Lockheed SR-71]] remains unsurpassed in many areas of performance.]]\n\n====Types of military aviation====\n* [[Fighter aircraft]]'s primary function is to destroy other aircraft. (e.g. [[Sopwith Camel]], [[A6M Zero]], [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]], [[MiG-29]], [[Su-27]], and [[F-22]]).\n* [[Ground attack|Ground attack aircraft]] are used against [[Tactical bombing|tactical]] earth-bound targets. (e.g. [[Junkers Ju 87|Junkers Stuka]], [[A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]], [[Ilyushin Il-2|Il-2]], [[J-22 Orao]], [[AH-64]] and [[Sukhoi Su-25|Su-25]]).\n* [[Bomber]]s are generally used against more [[Strategic bombing|strategic]] targets, such as factories and oil fields. (e.g. [[Zeppelin]], [[Tu-95]], [[Dassault Mirage IV|Mirage IV]], and [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]]).\n* [[Military transport aircraft|Transport aircraft]] are used to transport hardware and personnel. (e.g. [[C-17 Globemaster III]], [[C-130 Hercules]] and [[Mil Mi-26]]).\n* [[Surveillance aircraft|Surveillance]] and [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] aircraft obtain information about enemy forces. (e.g. [[Rumpler Taube]], [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]], [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]], [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58]] and [[MiG-25R]]).\n* [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)]] are used primarily as reconnaissance fixed-wing aircraft, though many also carry payloads. Cargo aircraft are in development.  (e.g. [[RQ-7|RQ-7B Shadow]], [[MQ-8|MQ-8 Fire Scout]], and [[MQ-1C|MQ-1C Gray Eagle]]).\n* [[Missile]]s deliver warheads, normally explosives, but also things like leaflets.\n\n=== Air safety ===\n{{main|Aviation safety}}\nAviation safety means the state of an aviation system or organization in which risks associated with aviation activities, related to, or in direct support of the operation of aircraft, are reduced and controlled to an acceptable level. It encompasses the theory, practice, investigation, and categorization of flight failures, and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education, and training. It can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of air travel.\n\n==Aviation accidents and incidents==\n{{main|Aviation accidents and incidents}}\n[[File:crash.arp.600pix.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[United States Air Force Thunderbirds|USAF Thunderbird]] pilot [[Ejection seat|ejecting]] from his [[F-16]] aircraft at an [[air show]] in 2003]]\n\nAn ''aviation accident'' is defined by the [[Convention on International Civil Aviation]] Annex 13 as an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight until such time as all such persons have disembarked, in which a person is fatally or seriously injured, the aircraft sustains damage or structural failure or the aircraft is missing or is completely inaccessible.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Investigation Process Research Resource Site|title=International Investigation Standards|url=http://www.iprr.org/manuals/Annex13.html|accessdate=7 May 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427102210/http://www.iprr.org/manuals/Annex13.html|archivedate=27 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe first fatal aviation accident occurred in a [[Wright Model A]] aircraft at [[Fort Myer|Fort Myer, Virginia, USA]], on September 17, 1908, resulting in injury to the pilot, [[Orville Wright]], and death of the passenger, Signal Corps Lieutenant [[Thomas Selfridge]].<ref>{{cite web|author=About.com Inventors|title=Wright Brothers \u2013 First Fatal Airplane Crash in 1908|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/weirdmuseums/ig/Wright-Brothers/First-Fatal-Airplane-Crash.htm|accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAn ''aviation incident'' is defined as an occurrence, other than an accident, associated with the operation of an aircraft that affects or could affect the safety of operations.<ref name=\"AirSafe.com\">{{cite web|last=AirSafe.com|title=Definitions of Key Terms Used by AirSafe.com|url=http://www.airsafe.com/events/define.htm|accessdate=7 May 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420172922/http://www.airsafe.com/events/define.htm|archivedate=20 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nAn accident in which the damage to the aircraft is such that it must be written off, or in which the plane is destroyed, is called a ''hull loss accident''.<ref name=\"AirSafe.com\"/>\n\n==Air traffic control==\n{{Main|Air traffic control}}\n[[File:Towers Schiphol small.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Air traffic control tower]]s at [[Amsterdam Airport]]]]\n\nAir traffic control (ATC) involves communication with aircraft to help maintain separation&nbsp;\u2013 that is, they ensure that aircraft are sufficiently far enough apart horizontally or vertically for no risk of collision. Controllers may co-ordinate position reports provided by pilots, or in high traffic areas (such as the United States) they may use [[radar]] to see aircraft positions.\n\nThere are generally four different types of ATC:\n* center controllers, who control aircraft en route between airports\n* control towers (including tower, ground control, clearance delivery, and other services), which control aircraft within a small distance (typically 10\u201315&nbsp;km horizontal, and 1,000 m vertical) of an airport.\n* oceanic controllers, who control aircraft over international waters between continents, generally without radar service.\n* terminal controllers, who control aircraft in a wider area (typically 50\u201380&nbsp;km) around busy airports.\n\nATC is especially important for aircraft flying under [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR), when they may be in weather conditions that do not allow the pilots to see other aircraft. However, in very high-traffic areas, especially near major airports, aircraft flying under [[visual flight rules]] (VFR) are also required to follow instructions from ATC.\n\nIn addition to separation from other aircraft, ATC may provide weather advisories, terrain separation, navigation assistance, and other services to pilots, depending on their workload.\n\nATC do not control all flights. The majority of VFR (Visual Flight Rules) flights in North America are not required to contact ATC (unless they are passing through a busy terminal area or using a major airport), and in many areas, such as northern Canada and low altitude in northern Scotland, Air traffic control services are not available even for IFR flights at lower altitudes.\n\n==Environmental impact==\n{{Main|Environmental impact of aviation}}\n\nLike all activities involving [[combustion]], operating powered aircraft (from airliners to hot air balloons) releases [[soot]] and other pollutants into the atmosphere. [[Greenhouse gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) are also produced. In addition, there are environmental impacts specific to aviation: for instance, [[File:Contrails.jpg|thumb|Water vapor [[Condensation trails|contrails]] left by high-altitude jet [[airliner]]s.

Some of the most significant advancements in aviation technology came with the controlled gliding flying of [[Otto Lilienthal]] in 1896; then a large step in significance came with the construction of the first powered airplane by the [[Wright brothers]] in the early 1900s. Since that time, aviation has been technologically revolutionized by the introduction of the [[jet aircraft|jet]] which permitted a major form of transport throughout the world.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''aviation'' was coined by the French writer and former naval officer Gabriel La Landelle in 1863.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_pA9-D4QETAoC#page/n7/mode/2up|title=Aviation ou Navigation aerienne par G. de La Landelle}}</ref> He derived the term from the verb ''avier'' (an unsuccessful [[neologism]] for \"to fly\"), itself derived from the Latin word ''avis'' (\"bird\") and the suffix ''-ation''.{{sfn|Cassard|2008|p=77}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of aviation}}\n\n===Early beginnings===\n\nThere are early legends of human flight such as the stories of [[Icarus]] in Greek myth, [[Jamshid]] and [[Shah]] [[Kay K\u0101vus]] in Persian myth,<ref>''The Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma of Firdaus\u00ed''.

The practicality of balloons was limited because they could only travel downwind. It was immediately recognized that a steerable, or [[Airship|dirigible]], balloon was required. [[Jean-Pierre Blanchard]] flew the first human-powered dirigible in 1784 and crossed the English Channel in one in 1785.\n\n[[Rigid airship]]s became the first aircraft to transport passengers and cargo over great distances. The best known aircraft of this type were manufactured by the German [[Zeppelin]] company.\n\nThe most successful Zeppelin was the [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]. It flew over one million miles, including an around-the-world flight in August 1929. However, the dominance of the Zeppelins over the airplanes of that period, which had a range of only a few hundred miles, was diminishing as airplane design advanced. The \"Golden Age\" of the airships ended on May 6, 1937 when the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] caught fire, killing 36 people. The cause of the Hindenburg accident was initially blamed on the use of hydrogen instead of helium as the lift gas. An internal investigation by the manufacturer revealed that the coating used in the material covering the frame was highly flammable and allowed static electricity to build up in the airship.{{sfn|De Angelis|1997|pages=87\u2013101}} Changes to the coating formulation reduced the risk of further Hindenburg type accidents.

One of the most successful designs of this period was the [[Douglas DC-3]], which became the first [[airliner]] to be profitable carrying passengers exclusively, starting the modern era of passenger airline service. By the beginning of World War II, many towns and cities had built airports, and there were numerous qualified pilots available. The war brought many innovations to aviation, including the first [[turbojet|jet]] aircraft and the first liquid-fueled [[rocket]]s.\n\n[[File:Helios cthomas.jpg|thumb|left|[[NASA]]'s [[Helios Prototype|Helios]] researches [[solar power]]ed flight.]]\nAfter World War II, especially in North America, there was a boom in [[general aviation]], both private and commercial, as thousands of pilots were released from military service and many inexpensive war-surplus transport and training aircraft became available. Manufacturers such as [[Cessna]], [[Piper Aircraft|Piper]], and [[Beechcraft]] expanded production to provide light aircraft for the new middle-class market.\n\nBy the 1950s, the development of civil jets grew, beginning with the [[de Havilland Comet]], though the first widely used passenger jet was the [[Boeing 707]], because it was much more economical than other aircraft at that time. At the same time, [[gas turbine|turboprop]] propulsion began to appear for smaller commuter planes, making it possible to serve small-volume routes in a much wider range of weather conditions.\n\nSince the 1960s [[composite material]] airframes and quieter, more efficient engines have become available, and [[Concorde]] provided [[supersonic transport|supersonic passenger service]] for more than two decades, but the most important lasting innovations have taken place in instrumentation and control. The arrival of [[transistor|solid-state]] electronics, the [[Global Positioning System]], [[communications satellite|satellite communications]], and increasingly small and powerful computers and [[light-emitting diode|LED]] displays, have dramatically changed the cockpits of [[airliner]]s and, increasingly, of smaller aircraft as well. Pilots can navigate much more accurately and view terrain, obstructions, and other nearby aircraft on a map or through [[synthetic vision]], even at night or in low visibility.\n\nOn June 21, 2004, [[SpaceShipOne]] became the first privately funded aircraft to make a [[spaceflight]], opening the possibility of an aviation market capable of leaving the Earth's atmosphere. Meanwhile, flying prototypes of aircraft powered by alternative fuels, such as [[ethanol]], [[electricity]], and even [[solar energy]], are becoming more common.\n\n==Operations of aircraft==\n\n===Civil aviation===\n{{Main|Civil aviation}} \nCivil aviation includes all non-military flying, both [[general aviation]] and [[scheduled air transport]].\n\n====Air transport====\n{{Main|Airline}}\n[[File:Northwest Airlines A330-323 (N805NW) landing at London Gatwick Airport.jpg|thumb|right|[[Northwest Airlines]] [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-323]]]]\n\nThere are five major manufacturers of civil transport aircraft (in alphabetical order):\n* [[Airbus]], based in Europe\n* [[Boeing]], based in the United States\n* [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]], based in Canada\n* [[Embraer]], based in Brazil\n* [[United Aircraft Corporation]], based in Russia\n\nBoeing, Airbus, [[Ilyushin]] and [[Tupolev]] concentrate on wide-body and narrow-body jet [[airliner]]s, while Bombardier, Embraer and [[Sukhoi]] concentrate on [[regional airliner]]s.

The Chinese [[ACAC consortium]] will also soon enter the civil transport market with its [[Comac ARJ21]] regional jet.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1670256,00.html | work=Time | title=Eyes on the Skies | first=Kathleen | last=Kingsbury | date=October 11, 2007 | accessdate=April 26, 2010 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031070258/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1670256,00.html | archivedate=October 31, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nUntil the 1970s, most major airlines were [[flag carrier]]s, sponsored by their governments and heavily protected from competition. Since then, [[open skies]] agreements have resulted in increased competition and choice for consumers, coupled with falling prices for airlines. The combination of high fuel prices, low fares, high salaries, and crises such as the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS epidemic]] have driven many older airlines to government-bailouts, bankruptcy or mergers. At the same time, [[low-cost carrier]]s such as [[Ryanair]], [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]] and [[WestJet]] have flourished.\n\n====General aviation====\n{{Main|General aviation}}\n[[File:cessna.120.g-btbw.arp.jpg|thumb|right|1947 [[Cessna 120]]]]\n\n''General aviation'' includes all non-scheduled civil flying, both [[private aviation|private]] and [[commercial aviation|commercial]]. General aviation may include business flights, [[air charter]], private aviation, flight training, [[hot air balloon|ballooning]], [[paragliding]], [[parachuting]], [[Glider (sailplane)|gliding]], [[hang gliding]], [[aerial photography]], [[powered hang glider|foot-launched powered hang gliders]], air ambulance, crop dusting, charter flights, [[traffic reporting]], police air patrols and forest fire fighting.\n\nEach country regulates aviation differently, but general aviation usually falls under different regulations depending on whether it is private or commercial and on the type of equipment involved.\n\nMany small aircraft manufacturers serve the general aviation market, with a focus on private aviation and flight training.\n\nThe most important recent developments for small aircraft (which form the bulk of the GA fleet) have been the introduction of advanced [[avionics]] (including [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) that were formerly found only in large [[airliner]]s, and the introduction of [[composite material]]s to make small aircraft lighter and faster. [[Ultralight aviation|Ultralight]] and [[homebuilt aircraft]] have also become increasingly popular for recreational use, since in most countries that allow private aviation, they are much less expensive and less heavily regulated than certified aircraft.\n\n===Military aviation===\n{{Main|Military aviation|Aerial warfare}}\nSimple [[balloon (aeronautics)|balloons]] were used as surveillance aircraft as early as the 18th century. Over the years, [[military aircraft]] have been built to meet ever increasing capability requirements. Manufacturers of military aircraft compete for contracts to supply their government's arsenal. Aircraft are selected based on factors like cost, performance, and the speed of production.\n[[File:Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.jpg|thumb|The [[Lockheed SR-71]] remains unsurpassed in many areas of performance.]]\n\n====Types of military aviation====\n* [[Fighter aircraft]]'s primary function is to destroy other aircraft. (e.g. [[Sopwith Camel]], [[A6M Zero]], [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]], [[MiG-29]], [[Su-27]], and [[F-22]]).\n* [[Ground attack|Ground attack aircraft]] are used against [[Tactical bombing|tactical]] earth-bound targets. (e.g. [[Junkers Ju 87|Junkers Stuka]], [[A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]], [[Ilyushin Il-2|Il-2]], [[J-22 Orao]], [[AH-64]] and [[Sukhoi Su-25|Su-25]]).\n* [[Bomber]]s are generally used against more [[Strategic bombing|strategic]] targets, such as factories and oil fields. (e.g. [[Zeppelin]], [[Tu-95]], [[Dassault Mirage IV|Mirage IV]], and [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]]).\n* [[Military transport aircraft|Transport aircraft]] are used to transport hardware and personnel. (e.g. [[C-17 Globemaster III]], [[C-130 Hercules]] and [[Mil Mi-26]]).\n* [[Surveillance aircraft|Surveillance]] and [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] aircraft obtain information about enemy forces. (e.g. [[Rumpler Taube]], [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]], [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]], [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58]] and [[MiG-25R]]).\n* [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)]] are used primarily as reconnaissance fixed-wing aircraft, though many also carry payloads. Cargo aircraft are in development.  (e.g. [[RQ-7|RQ-7B Shadow]], [[MQ-8|MQ-8 Fire Scout]], and [[MQ-1C|MQ-1C Gray Eagle]]).\n* [[Missile]]s deliver warheads, normally explosives, but also things like leaflets.\n\n=== Air safety ===\n{{main|Aviation safety}}\nAviation safety means the state of an aviation system or organization in which risks associated with aviation activities, related to, or in direct support of the operation of aircraft, are reduced and controlled to an acceptable level. It encompasses the theory, practice, investigation, and categorization of flight failures, and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education, and training. It can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of air travel.\n\n==Aviation accidents and incidents==\n{{main|Aviation accidents and incidents}}\n[[File:crash.arp.600pix.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[United States Air Force Thunderbirds|USAF Thunderbird]] pilot [[Ejection seat|ejecting]] from his [[F-16]] aircraft at an [[air show]] in 2003]]\n\nAn ''aviation accident'' is defined by the [[Convention on International Civil Aviation]] Annex 13 as an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight until such time as all such persons have disembarked, in which a person is fatally or seriously injured, the aircraft sustains damage or structural failure or the aircraft is missing or is completely inaccessible.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Investigation Process Research Resource Site|title=International Investigation Standards|url=http://www.iprr.org/manuals/Annex13.html|accessdate=7 May 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427102210/http://www.iprr.org/manuals/Annex13.html|archivedate=27 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe first fatal aviation accident occurred in a [[Wright Model A]] aircraft at [[Fort Myer|Fort Myer, Virginia, USA]], on September 17, 1908, resulting in injury to the pilot, [[Orville Wright]], and death of the passenger, Signal Corps Lieutenant [[Thomas Selfridge]].<ref>{{cite web|author=About.com Inventors|title=Wright Brothers \u2013 First Fatal Airplane Crash in 1908|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/weirdmuseums/ig/Wright-Brothers/First-Fatal-Airplane-Crash.htm|accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAn ''aviation incident'' is defined as an occurrence, other than an accident, associated with the operation of an aircraft that affects or could affect the safety of operations.<ref name=\"AirSafe.com\">{{cite web|last=AirSafe.com|title=Definitions of Key Terms Used by AirSafe.com|url=http://www.airsafe.com/events/define.htm|accessdate=7 May 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420172922/http://www.airsafe.com/events/define.htm|archivedate=20 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nAn accident in which the damage to the aircraft is such that it must be written off, or in which the plane is destroyed, is called a ''hull loss accident''.<ref name=\"AirSafe.com\"/>\n\n==Air traffic control==\n{{Main|Air traffic control}}\n[[File:Towers Schiphol small.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Air traffic control tower]]s at [[Amsterdam Airport]]]]\n\nAir traffic control (ATC) involves communication with aircraft to help maintain separation&nbsp;\u2013 that is, they ensure that aircraft are sufficiently far enough apart horizontally or vertically for no risk of collision. Controllers may co-ordinate position reports provided by pilots, or in high traffic areas (such as the United States) they may use [[radar]] to see aircraft positions.\n\nThere are generally four different types of ATC:\n* center controllers, who control aircraft en route between airports\n* control towers (including tower, ground control, clearance delivery, and other services), which control aircraft within a small distance (typically 10\u201315&nbsp;km horizontal, and 1,000 m vertical) of an airport.\n* oceanic controllers, who control aircraft over international waters between continents, generally without radar service.\n* terminal controllers, who control aircraft in a wider area (typically 50\u201380&nbsp;km) around busy airports.\n\nATC is especially important for aircraft flying under [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR), when they may be in weather conditions that do not allow the pilots to see other aircraft. However, in very high-traffic areas, especially near major airports, aircraft flying under [[visual flight rules]] (VFR) are also required to follow instructions from ATC.\n\nIn addition to separation from other aircraft, ATC may provide weather advisories, terrain separation, navigation assistance, and other services to pilots, depending on their workload.\n\nATC do not control all flights. The majority of VFR (Visual Flight Rules) flights in North America are not required to contact ATC (unless they are passing through a busy terminal area or using a major airport), and in many areas, such as northern Canada and low altitude in northern Scotland, Air traffic control services are not available even for IFR flights at lower altitudes.\n\n==Environmental impact==\n{{Main|Environmental impact of aviation}}\n\nLike all activities involving [[combustion]], operating powered aircraft (from airliners to hot air balloons) releases [[soot]] and other pollutants into the atmosphere. [[Greenhouse gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) are also produced. In addition, there are environmental impacts specific to aviation: for instance, [[File:Contrails.jpg|thumb|Water vapor [[Condensation trails|contrails]] left by high-altitude jet [[airliner]]s. These may contribute to [[cirrus cloud]] formation.]]\n* Aircraft operating at high altitudes near the [[tropopause]] (mainly large [[jet airliner]]s) emit aerosols and leave [[contrail]]s, both of which can increase [[cirrus cloud]] formation&nbsp;\u2013 cloud cover may have increased by up to 0.2% since the birth of aviation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc/aviation/032.htm|title=Aviation and the Global Atmosphere|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629113916/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc/aviation/032.htm|archivedate=2007-06-29}}</ref> Clouds can have both a cooling and warming effect.

They pitted [[French First Republic|France]] against [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and several other monarchies. They are divided in two periods: the [[War of the First Coalition]] (1792\u201397) and the [[War of the Second Coalition]] (1798\u20131802). Initially confined to Europe, the fighting gradually assumed a global dimension. After a decade of constant warfare and aggressive diplomacy, France had conquered a wide array of territories, from the [[Italian Peninsula]] and the [[Low Countries]] in Europe to the [[Louisiana Territory]] in North America. French success in these conflicts ensured the spread of revolutionary principles over much of Europe.\n\nAs early as 1791, the other monarchies of Europe looked with outrage at the revolution and its upheavals; and they considered whether they should intervene, either in support of [[King Louis XVI]], to prevent the spread of revolution, or to take advantage of the chaos in France. Anticipating an attack,{{Citation needed|reason=evidence that the Girondins wanted a preemptive war is needed|date=March 2019}} France declared war on [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and Austria in the spring of 1792 and they responded with a coordinated invasion that was eventually turned back at the [[Battle of Valmy]] in September. This victory emboldened the [[National Convention]] to [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|abolish the monarchy]].<ref>TCW Blanning, ''The French Revolutionary Wars''. pp. 78\u201379.</ref> A series of victories by the [[French Revolutionary Armies|new French armies]] abruptly ended with defeat at [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)|Neerwinden]] in the spring of 1793. The French suffered additional defeats in the remainder of the year and these difficult times allowed the [[Jacobins]] to rise to power and impose the [[Reign of Terror]] to unify the nation.\n\nIn 1794, the situation improved dramatically for the French as huge victories at [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]] against the Austrians and at the [[Battle of the Black Mountain|Black Mountain]] against the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] signaled the start of a new stage in the wars. By 1795, the French had captured the [[Austrian Netherlands]] and knocked Spain and Prussia out of the war with the [[Peace of Basel]]. A hitherto unknown general named [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] began his first [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|campaign in Italy]] in April 1796. In less than a year, French armies under Napoleon decimated the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] forces and evicted them from the Italian peninsula, winning almost every battle and capturing 150,000 prisoners. With French forces marching towards [[Vienna]], the Austrians sued for peace and agreed to the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], ending the First Coalition against the Republic.\n\nThe War of the Second Coalition began in 1798 with the [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|French invasion of Egypt]], headed by Napoleon. The Allies took the opportunity presented by the French effort in the Middle East to regain territories lost from the First Coalition. The war began well for the Allies in Europe, where they gradually pushed the French out of Italy and invaded Switzerland&nbsp;\u2013 racking up victories at [[Battle of Magnano|Magnano]], [[Battle of Cassano (1799)|Cassano]] and [[Battle of Novi (1799)|Novi]] along the way. However, their efforts largely unraveled with the French victory at [[Second Battle of Zurich|Zurich]] in September 1799, which caused [[Russian Empire|Russia]] to drop out of the war.<ref>TCW Blanning, ''The French Revolutionary Wars''. pp. 254\u201355.</ref> Meanwhile, Napoleon's forces annihilated a series of Egyptian and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] armies at the battles of the [[Battle of the Pyramids|Pyramids]], [[Battle of Mount Tabor (1799)|Mount Tabor]] and [[Battle of Abukir (1799)|Abukir]]. These victories and the conquest of Egypt further enhanced Napoleon's popularity back in France, and he returned in triumph in the fall of 1799. However, the [[Royal Navy]] had won the [[Battle of the Nile]] in 1798, further strengthening British control of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].\n\nNapoleon's arrival from Egypt led to the fall of the [[French Directory|Directory]] in the [[Coup of 18 Brumaire]], with Napoleon installing himself as Consul. Napoleon then reorganized the French army and launched a new assault against the Austrians in Italy during the spring of 1800. This brought a decisive French victory at the [[Battle of Marengo]] in June 1800, after which the Austrians withdrew from the peninsula once again. Another crushing French triumph at [[Battle of Hohenlinden|Hohenlinden]] in Bavaria forced the Austrians to seek peace for a second time, leading to the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] in 1801. With Austria and Russia out of the war, the United Kingdom found itself increasingly isolated and agreed to the [[Treaty of Amiens]] with Napoleon's government in 1802, concluding the Revolutionary Wars. However, the lingering tensions proved too difficult to contain, and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] began over a year later with the formation of the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]], continuing the series of [[Coalition Wars]].\n\n==War of the First Coalition==\n{{refimprove|section|date=April 2018}}<!--Very few/no citations in 1795, 1796, 1797, and 1798 subsections.. see [[WP:Summary style]]-->\n{{Main article|War of the First Coalition}}\n{{See also|List of battles of the War of the First Coalition}}\n===1791\u20131792===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1792 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n\nThe key figure in initial foreign reaction to the revolution was [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], brother of Louis XVI's Queen [[Marie Antoinette]]. Leopold had initially looked on the Revolution with equanimity, but became more and more disturbed as the Revolution became more radical, although he still hoped to avoid war. On 27 August, Leopold and King [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]] of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], in consultation with [[emigr\u00e9|emigrant French nobles]], issued the [[Declaration of Pillnitz]], which declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe in the well-being of Louis and his family, and threatened vague but severe consequences if anything should befall them. Although Leopold saw the Pillnitz Declaration as a non-committal gesture to placate the sentiments of French monarchists and nobles, it was seen in France as a serious threat and was denounced by the revolutionary leaders.<ref name=\"Georges Lefebvre 1964\">Georges Lefebvre, ''The French Revolution Volume II: from 1793 to 1799'' (1964) ch. 1.</ref>\n\nFrance eventually issued an ultimatum demanding that the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] of Austria under [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], who also was Emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], renounce any hostile alliances and withdraw its troops from the French border.<ref>Lecky, William Edward Hartpole, [https://archive.org/stream/historyenglandei05leck#page/601/mode/1up A History of England in the Eighteenth Century] Volume V (1890) p. 601</ref> The reply was evasive, and the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Assembly]] voted for war on 20 April 1792 against [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] (who succeeded Leopold II), after a long list of grievances presented by foreign minister [[Charles Fran\u00e7ois Dumouriez]]. Dumouriez prepared an immediate invasion of the [[Austrian Netherlands]], where he expected the local population to rise against Austrian rule [[Brabant Revolution|as they had earlier in 1790]]. However, the revolution had thoroughly disorganized the army, and the forces raised were insufficient for the invasion. Following the declaration of war, French soldiers deserted ''en masse'' and in one case murdered their general, [[Th\u00e9obald Dillon]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles Esdaile|title=The French Wars 1792\u20131815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0WvnpSQlbsC&pg=PA7|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|page=7|isbn=978-0203209745}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Manifeste de Brunswick caricature 1792.jpg|thumb|left|Anonymous caricature depicting the treatment given to the [[Brunswick Manifesto]] by the French population]]\n\nWhile the revolutionary government frantically raised fresh troops and reorganized its armies, a mostly Prussian Allied army under [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick]] assembled at [[Koblenz]] on the Rhine. The duke then issued a proclamation called the [[Brunswick Manifesto]] (July 1792), written by the French king's cousin, [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9]], the leader of an [[Army of Cond\u00e9|\u00e9migr\u00e9 corps within the Allied army]], which declared the Allies' intent to restore the king to his full powers and to treat any person or town who opposed them as rebels to be condemned to death by [[martial law]]. This, however, had the effect of strengthening the resolve of the revolutionary army and government to oppose them by any means necessary.\n\nOn 10 August, [[10 August (French Revolution)|a crowd stormed]] the [[Tuileries Palace]], seizing the king and his family. On 19 August 1792, the invasion by Brunswick's army commenced, with Brunswick's army easily taking the fortresses of [[Longwy]] and [[Verdun-sur-Meuse|Verdun]]. The invasion continued, but at [[Battle of Valmy|Valmy]] on 20 September, the invaders came to a stalemate against Dumouriez and [[Fran\u00e7ois Christophe Kellermann|Kellermann]] in which the highly professional French [[artillery]] distinguished itself. Although the battle was a tactical draw, it gave a great boost to French morale. Further, the Prussians, finding that the campaign had been longer and more costly than predicted, decided that the cost and risk of continued fighting was too great and, with winter approaching, they decided to retreat from France to preserve their army. The next day, the monarchy was formally abolished as the [[First French Republic|First Republic]] was declared (21 September 1792).<ref>William Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (1989) p. 194</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the French had been successful on several other fronts, occupying [[Savoy]] and [[Nice]], which were parts of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], while General [[Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine|Custine]] invaded Germany, occupying several German towns along the Rhine and reaching as far as [[Frankfurt]]. Dumouriez went on the offensive in the Austrian Netherlands once again, winning a great victory over the Austrians at the [[Battle of Jemappes]] on 6 November and occupying the entire country by the beginning of winter.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jeremy Black|title=British Foreign Policy in an Age of Revolutions, 1783\u20131793|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zgbjPESz3dcC&pg=PA408|year=1994|page=408|isbn=978-0521466844}}</ref>\n\n===1793===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1793 in the French Revolutionary Wars|Flanders Campaign|War in the Vend\u00e9e}}\n[[File:R\u00e9volte Fouesnant.jpg|thumb|right|While the [[First Coalition]] attacked the new Republic, France faced civil war and counter-revolutionary [[guerrilla war]].

Nonetheless, the Coalition allies launched a determined drive to invade France during the [[Flanders Campaign]].<ref>Alan Forrest, ''Soldiers of the French Revolution'' (1989)</ref>\n\nFrance suffered severe reverses at first. They were driven out of the [[Austrian Netherlands]], and serious revolts flared in the west and south of France. One of these, at [[Toulon]], was the first serious taste of action for an unknown young artillery officer [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]]. He contributed to the [[Siege of Toulon|siege of the city and its harbor]] by planning an effective assault with well-placed artillery batteries raining projectiles down on rebel positions. This performance helped make his reputation as a capable tactician, and it fueled his meteoric rise to military and political power. Once the city was occupied, he participated in pacifying the rebelling citizens of Toulon with the same artillery that he first used to conquer the city.<ref>Robert Forczyk, ''Toulon 1793: Napoleon's First Great Victory'' (2005)</ref>\n\nBy the end of the year, large new armies had turned back foreign invaders, and the [[Reign of Terror]], a fierce policy of repression, had suppressed internal revolts. The French military was in the ascendant. [[Lazare Carnot]], a scientist and prominent member of the [[Committee of Public Safety]], organized the [[French Revolutionary Army|fourteen armies of the Republic]], and was then nicknamed the Organizer of the Victory.<ref>Paddy Griffith (1998).

On the [[Alps|Alpine]] frontier, there was little change, with the French invasion of [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] failing. On the Spanish border, the French under General [[Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Dugommier|Dugommier]] rallied from their defensive positions at [[Bayonne]] and [[Perpignan]], driving the Spanish out of [[Roussillon]] and invading [[Catalonia]]. Dugommier was killed in the [[Battle of San-Lorenzo de la Muga|Battle of the Black Mountain]] in November.\n\nOn the northern front in the [[Flanders Campaign]], the Austrians and French both prepared offensives in Belgium, with the Austrians besieging [[Landrecies]] and advancing towards [[Mons]] and [[Maubeuge]]. The French prepared an offensive on multiple fronts, with two armies in [[Flanders]] under [[Charles Pichegru|Pichegru]] and [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]], and [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]] attacking from the German border. The French withstood several damaging but inconclusive actions before regaining the initiative at the battles of [[Battle of Tourcoing|Tourcoing]] and [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]] in June. The French armies drove the Austrians, British, and Dutch beyond the [[Rhine (river)|Rhine]], occupying Belgium, the [[Rhineland]], and the south of the Netherlands.\n\nOn the middle Rhine front in July, General Michaud's Army of the Rhine attempted two offensives in July in the [[Battle of Trippstadt|Vosges]], the second of which was successful but not followed up, allowing for a Prussian counter-attack in September. Otherwise this sector of the front was largely quiet over the course of the year.\n\nAt sea, the French Atlantic Fleet succeeded in holding off a British attempt to interdict a vital cereal [[convoy]] from the United States on the [[Glorious First of June]], though at the cost of one quarter of its strength. In the Caribbean, the British fleet landed in [[Martinique]] in February, taking the whole island by 24 March and holding it until the [[Treaty of Amiens]], and in [[Guadeloupe]] in April, where they captured the island briefly but were driven out by [[Victor Hugues]] later in the year. In the Mediterranean, following the British evacuation of [[Toulon]], the Corsican leader [[Pasquale Paoli]] agreed with admiral [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Samuel Hood]] to place Corsica under British protection in return for assistance capturing French garrisons at [[Siege of Saint-Florent|Saint-Florent]], [[Siege of Bastia|Bastia]], and [[Siege of Calvi|Calvi]], creating the short-lived [[Anglo-Corsican Kingdom]].\n\nBy the end of the year French armies had won victories on all fronts, and as the year closed they began advancing into the Netherlands.\n\n===1795===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1795 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n[[File:Combat Quiberon 1795.jpg|thumb|''[[Arm\u00e9e des \u00c9migr\u00e9s]]'' at the [[Invasion of France (1795)|Battle of Quiberon]]]]\n[[File:Helder Morel-Fatio.jpg|thumb|[[Capture of the Dutch fleet at Den Helder|Capture of the Dutch fleet]] by the French hussars]]\nThe year opened with French forces in the process of attacking the [[Dutch Republic]] in the middle of winter. The Dutch people rallied to the French call and started the [[Batavian Revolution]]. City after city was occupied by the French. [[Capture of the Dutch fleet at Den Helder|The Dutch fleet was captured]], and the stadtholder [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]] fled to be replaced by a popular [[Batavian Republic]], a [[sister republic]] which supported the revolutionary cause and signed a treaty with the French, ceding the territories of [[North Brabant]] and [[Maastricht]] to France on 16 May.\n\nWith the Netherlands falling, [[Prussia]] also decided to leave the coalition, signing the [[Peace of Basel]] on 6 April, ceding the west bank of the [[Rhine]] to France. This freed Prussia to finish the occupation of Poland.\n\nThe French army in Spain advanced in [[Catalonia]] while taking [[Bilbao]] and [[Vitoria, Spain|Vitoria]] and marching toward [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]]. By 10 July, Spain also decided to make peace, recognizing the revolutionary government and ceding the territory of [[Santo Domingo]], but returning to the pre-war borders in Europe. This left the armies on the [[Pyrenees]] free to march east and reinforce the armies on the [[Alps]], and the combined army overran [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]].\n\nMeanwhile, [[Great Britain|Britain]]'s attempt to reinforce the [[Revolt in the Vend\u00e9e|rebels in the Vend\u00e9e]] by landing troops at [[Invasion of France (1795)|Quiberon]] failed, and a conspiracy to overthrow the republican government from within ended when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s garrison [[13 Vend\u00e9miaire|used cannon to fire grapeshot]] into the attacking mob (which led to the establishment of the [[French Directory|Directory]]).\n\nOn the Rhine frontier, General [[Charles Pichegru|Pichegru]], negotiating with the exiled [[House of Bourbon|Royalists]], betrayed his army and forced the evacuation of [[Mannheim]] and the failure of the siege of [[Mainz]] by [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]]. This was a moderate setback to the position of the French.\n\nIn northern Italy, victory at the [[Battle of Loano]] in November gave France access to the Italian peninsula.\n\n===1796===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1796 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n[[File:La Bataille du Pont d'Arcole.jpg|thumb|[[Napoleon|General Bonaparte]] and his troops crossing the [[Battle of the Bridge of Arcole|bridge of Arcole]]]]\n[[File:Bitva u Lodi, Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Lejeune.jpg|thumb|Napoleon Bonaparte defeats the Austrians at the [[Battle of Lodi]]]]\nThe French prepared a great advance on three fronts, with Jourdan and [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]] on the Rhine, and Bonaparte in Italy. The three armies were to link up in [[State of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and march on [[Vienna]]. Jourdan and Moreau advanced rapidly into Germany, and Moreau had reached [[Bavaria]] and the edge of Tyrol by September, but Jourdan was defeated by [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], and both armies were forced to retreat back across the Rhine.\n\nNapoleon, on the other hand, was completely successful [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars#Bonaparte's war|in a daring invasion of Italy]]. He left Paris on 11 March for [[Nice]] to take over the weak and poorly supplied [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]], arriving on 26 March. The army was already being reorganised and supplied when he arrived, and he found that the situation was rapidly improving. He was soon able to carry out the plan for the invasion of Italy that he had been advocating for years, which provided for an advance over the Apennines near Altare to attack the enemy position of [[Ceva]].\n\nThe [[Montenotte Campaign]] opened after [[Johann Peter Beaulieu|Johann Beaulieu]]'s Austrian forces attacked the extreme French eastern flank near [[Genoa]] on 10 April. Bonaparte countered by attacking and crushing the isolated right wing of the allied armies at the [[Battle of Montenotte]] on 12 April. The next day he defeated an Austro-Sardinian force at the [[Battle of Millesimo]]. He then won a victory at the [[Second Battle of Dego]], driving the Austrians northeast, away from their Piedmontese allies. Satisfied that the Austrians were temporarily inert, Bonaparte harried [[Michelangelo Alessandro Colli-Marchi|Michelangelo Colli]]'s Piedmontese at [[Battle of Ceva|Ceva]] and [[San Michele Mondovi]] before whipping them at the [[Battle of Mondov\u00ec]]. A week later, on 28 April, the Piedmontese signed an armistice at [[Cherasco]], withdrawing from the hostilities. On 18 May they signed a [[Treaty of Paris (1796)|peace treaty at Paris]], ceding [[Savoy]] and [[Nice]] and allowing the French bases to be used against Austria.\n\nAfter a short pause, Napoleon carried out a brilliant flanking manoeuvre, and crossed the [[Po (river)|Po]] at [[Piacenza]], nearly cutting the Austrian line of retreat. The Austrians escaped after the [[Battle of Fombio]], but had their rear-guard mauled at [[Battle of Lodi|Lodi]] on 10 May, after which the French took [[Milan]]. Bonaparte then advanced eastwards again, drove off the Austrians in the [[Battle of Borghetto]] and in June began the [[Siege of Mantua (1796\u201397)|Siege of Mantua]]. [[Mantua]] was the strongest Austrian base in Italy. Meanwhile, the Austrians retreated north into the foothills of the [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]].\n\nDuring July and August, Austria sent a fresh army into Italy under [[Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser|Dagobert Wurmser]]. Wurmser attacked toward Mantua along the east side of [[Lake Garda]], sending [[Peter Quasdanovich]] down the west side in an effort to envelop Bonaparte. Bonaparte exploited the Austrian mistake of dividing their forces to defeat them in detail, but in so doing, he abandoned the siege of Mantua, which held out for another six months (Carl von Clauswitz mentioned in [[On War]] that the siege might have been able to be kept up if Bonaparte had [[Investment (military)|circumvallated]] the city<ref>''On War'', Book II, Chapter 5, 24., Carl von Clausewitz, translated by Michael Howard, p. 188 {{ISBN|1-85715-121-6}}</ref>). Quasdanovich was overcome at [[Battle of Lonato|Lonato]] on 3 August and Wurmser at [[Battle of Castiglione|Castiglione]] on 5 August. Wurmser retreated to the Tyrol, and Bonaparte resumed the siege.\n\nIn September, Bonaparte marched north against [[Trento]] in Tyrol, but Wurmser had already marched toward Mantua by the [[Brenta (river)|Brenta]] valley, leaving [[Paul Davidovich]]'s force to hold off the French. Bonaparte overran the holding force at the [[Battle of Rovereto]]. Then he followed Wurmser down the Brenta valley, to fall upon and defeat the Austrians at the [[Battle of Bassano]] on 8 September. Wurmser elected to march for Mantua with a large portion of his surviving troops. The Austrians evaded Bonaparte's attempts to intercept them but were driven into the city after a pitched battle on 15 September. This left nearly 30,000 Austrians trapped in the fortress. This number rapidly diminished due to disease, combat losses, and hunger.\n\nThe Austrians sent yet another army under [[J\u00f3zsef Alvinczi]] against Bonaparte in November. Again the Austrians divided their effort, sending Davidovich's corps from the north while Alvinczi's main body attacked from the east. At first they proved victorious over the French at [[Second Battle of Bassano|Bassano]], [[Battle of Calliano|Calliano]], and [[Battle of Caldiero (1796)|Caldiero]]. But Bonaparte ultimately defeated Alvinczi in the [[Battle of Arcole]] southeast of [[Verona]]. The French then turned on Davidovich in great strength and chased him into the Tyrol. Wurmser's only sortie was late and ineffectual.\n\nThe [[War in the Vend\u00e9e|rebellion in the Vend\u00e9e]] was also finally crushed in 1796 by [[Louis Lazare Hoche|Hoche]], but Hoche's [[Exp\u00e9dition d'Irlande|attempt to land a large invasion force in Ireland]] was unsuccessful.\n\n===1797===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1797 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n[[File:Napoleon at the Battle of Rivoli.jpg|thumb|right|Napoleon Bonaparte at the [[Battle of Rivoli]]]]\n[[File:Mots au combat d\u00e9pouill\u00e9s de leurs uniformes et armes en 1797.jpg|thumb|Soldiers killed in battle in 1797]]\nOn 14 February, British admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Jervis]] met and defeated a Spanish fleet off Portugal at the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1797)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]]. This prevented the Spanish fleet from rendezvousing with the French, removing a threat of invasion to Britain. However, the British fleet was weakened over the rest of the year by the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies (1797)|Spithead and Nore mutinies]], which kept many ships in port through the summer.\n\nOn 22 February French invasion force consisting of 1,400 troops from the ''[[La Legion Noire]]'' (The Black Legion) under the command of Irish American Colonel [[William Tate (soldier)|William Tate]] [[Battle of Fishguard|landed near Fishguard]] (Wales). They were met by a quickly assembled group of around 500 British [[military reserve force|reservists]], [[militia]] and sailors under the command of [[John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor]]. After brief clashes with the local civilian population and Lord Cawdor's forces on 23 February, Tate was forced into an [[unconditional surrender]] by 24 February.\n\nIn Italy, [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s armies were laying [[Siege of Mantua (1796-1797)|siege to Mantua]] at the beginning of the year, and a second attempt by Austrians under [[Joseph Alvinczy]] to raise the siege was driven off at the [[Battle of Rivoli]], where the French scored a decisive victory. Finally, on 2 February, [[Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser|Wurmser]] surrendered Mantua and 18,000 troops. The Papal forces sued for peace, which was granted at [[Tolentino]] on 19 February. Napoleon was now free to attack the Austrian heartland. He advanced directly toward Austria over the [[Julian Alps]], sending [[Barthelemy Catherine Joubert|Barth\u00e9lemy Joubert]] to invade the [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]].\n\n[[Archduke Charles of Austria]] hurried from the German front to defend Austria, but he was defeated at the [[Tagliamento]] on 16 March, and Napoleon proceeded into Austria, occupying [[Klagenfurt]] and preparing for a rendezvous with Joubert in front of [[Vienna]]. In Germany, the armies of [[Louis Lazare Hoche|Hoche]] and [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]] crossed the [[Rhine]] again in April after the previous year's failure. The victories of Napoleon had frightened the Austrians into making peace, and they concluded the [[Peace of Leoben]] in April, ending hostilities. However, his absence from Italy had allowed the outbreak of the revolt known as the [[Veronese Easters]] on 17 April, which was put down eight days later.\n\nAlthough Britain remained at war with France, this effectively ended the [[First Coalition]]. Austria later signed the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], ceding the [[Austrian Netherlands]] to France and recognizing the French border at the Rhine. Austria and France also partitioned [[Venice]] between them.\n\n===1798===\n{{Main article|Campaigns of 1798 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French campaign in Egypt and Syria|Quasi-War|French invasion of Switzerland|Irish Rebellion of 1798}}\n[[File:Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Baron Lejeune 001.jpg|thumb|In July 1798, French forces under Napoleon annihilated an Egyptian army at the [[Battle of the Pyramids]].

The British fleet bears down on the French line.]]\nWith only Britain left to fight and not enough of a navy to fight a direct war, Napoleon conceived of an [[French Invasion of Egypt|invasion of Egypt]] in 1798, which satisfied his personal desire for glory and the Directory's desire to have him far from Paris. The military objective of the expedition is not entirely clear, but may have been to threaten [[East India Company|British dominance in India]].\n\nNapoleon sailed from [[Toulon]] to [[Alexandria]], taking Malta on the way, and landing in June. Marching to [[Cairo]], he won a great victory at the [[Battle of the Pyramids]]; however, his fleet was sunk by [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]] at the [[Battle of the Nile]], stranding him in Egypt. Napoleon spent the remainder of the year consolidating his position in Egypt.<ref>Paul Strathern, ''Napoleon in Egypt: The Greatest Glory'' (2007)</ref>\n\nThe French government also took advantage of internal strife in Switzerland to [[French invasion of Switzerland|invade]], establishing the [[Helvetian Republic]] and annexing [[Geneva]]. French troops also deposed [[Pope Pius VI]], establishing a [[Roman Republic (18th century)|republic in Rome]].\n\nAn expeditionary force was sent to [[County Mayo]], in Ireland, to assist in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion against Britain]] in the summer of 1798. It had some success against British forces, most [[Battle of Castlebar|notably at Castlebar]], but was [[Battle of Ballinamuck|ultimately routed]] while trying to reach [[Dublin]]. French ships sent to assist them [[Battle of Tory Island|were captured]] by the Royal Navy off [[County Donegal]].\n\nThe French were also under pressure in the [[Southern Netherlands]] and Luxembourg where the local people revolted against conscription and anti-religious violence ([[Peasants' War (1798)|Peasants' War]]). The French had taken this territory in 1794, but it was officially theirs in 1797 due to a treaty with Austria. The French forces easily handled the Peasants' rebellion in the Southern Netherlands, and were able to put down the revolting forces in under 2 months.\n\nThe French in 1798 fought an undeclared war at sea against the United States, that was known variously as the \"[[Quasi-War]]\", the \"Half War\" and the \"Pirate Wars\". It was resolved peaceably with the [[Convention of 1800]].\n\n==War of the Second Coalition==\n{{Main article|War of the Second Coalition}}\nBritain and Austria organized a new coalition against France in 1798, including for the first time the [[Russian Empire]], although no action occurred until 1799 except against the [[kingdom of the Two Sicilies]].\n\n===1799===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1799 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n[[File:Bataille d'Aboukir, 25 juillet 1799.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Abukir (1799)|Battle of Abukir]] in 1799]]\n[[File:Bataille du mont-thabor.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Mount Tabor (1799)|Battle of Mount Tabor]] against the Ottomans]]\nIn Egypt, Napoleon had consolidated his control of the country for the time being. Soon after the beginning of the year, he mounted an invasion of Syria, capturing [[El Arish]] and [[Jaffa]]. On 17 March, he laid [[Siege of Acre (1799)|siege to Acre]], and defeated an Ottoman effort to relieve the city at the [[Battle of Mount Tabor (1799)|Battle of Mount Tabor]] on 17 April. However, his repeated assaults on Acre were driven back by Ottoman and British forces under the command of [[Jezzar Pasha]] and [[Sidney Smith (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Sidney Smith]]. By May, with [[pandemic|plague]] rampant in his army and no sign of success against the city, Napoleon was forced to retreat into Egypt. In July, Turkey, with the help of the British navy, mounted an invasion by sea from [[Rhodes]]. Napoleon attacked the Turkish beachheads and scored a crushing victory at the [[Battle of Abukir (1799)|Battle of Abukir]], capturing and killing the entire enemy army. In August, Napoleon decided to return to Europe, hearing of the political and military crisis in France. Leaving his army behind with [[Jean Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber|Kl\u00e9ber]] in command, he sailed through the British blockade to return to Paris and resolved to take control of the government there in a coup.\n\nIn Europe, the French Army of Observation, [[Army of the Danube order of battle|organized]] with 30,000&nbsp;men in four divisions, crossed the [[Rhine]] at [[Kehl]] and [[Basel]] in March 1799. The following day, it was renamed the Army of the Danube.<ref>Jourdan, p. 140.</ref> Under command of [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]], the army advanced in four columns through the Black Forest.

At the intensely fought [[Battle of Ostrach]], 21\u20132 March 1799, the first battle of the War of the Second Coalition, Austrian forces, under the command of [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], defeated Jourdan's Army of the Danube. The French suffered significant losses and were forced to retreat from the region, taking up new positions to the west at Messkirch (M\u00f6\u00dfkirch, Me\u00dfkirch), and then at Stockach and Engen. At the second battle, in [[Battle of Stockach (1799)|Stockach]], on 27 March 1799, the Austrian army achieved a decisive victory over the French forces, and again pushed the French army west. Jourdan instructed his generals to take up positions in the Black Forest, and he himself established a base at Hornberg. From there, General Jourdan relegated command of the army to his chief of staff, [[Jean Augustin Ernouf]], and traveled to Paris to ask for more and better troops and, ultimately, to request a medical leave.<ref name=\"Young pp. 230\">Young, pp. 230\u2013345; Gallagher, p. 70\u201379; Jourdan, pp. 190\u2013204.</ref>\n\n[[File:Sen-Gotard by Suvorov troops in 1799.jpg|thumb|Russian General [[Alexander Suvorov]] crossing the [[St. Gotthard Pass]] during the [[Italian and Swiss expedition]] in 1799]]\nThe Army was reorganized, and a portion placed under the command of [[Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na]] and merged with the Army of Helvetia. Following the reorganization and change in command, the Army participated in several skirmishes and actions on the eastern part of the [[Swiss Plateau]], including the [[Battle of Winterthur (1799)|Battle of Winterthur]]. After this action, three forces of the imperial army united north of Z\u00fcrich, completing a partial encirclement of Massena's combined Army of the Danube and Army of Switzerland. A few days later, at the [[First Battle of Zurich]], Massena was forced west, across the Limmat. In late summer, 1799, Charles was ordered to support imperial activities in the middle Rhineland; he withdrew north across the Rhine, and marched toward [[Mannheim]], leaving Z\u00fcrich and northern Switzerland in the hands of the inexperienced [[Alexander Korsakov]] and 25,000 Russian troops. Although the highly capable [[Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze]] remained in support, his 15,000 men were not able to counter Korsakov's poor defensive arrangements. Three weeks later, at the [[Second Battle of Zurich]], the Russian force was annihilated, and Hotze was killed south of Z\u00fcrich. This left Massena in control of northern Switzerland, and closed forced Suvorov into an arduous three-week march into the Vorarlberg, where his troops arrived, starving and exhausted, in mid-October.<ref name=\"Young pp. 230\"/>\n\nNapoleon himself invaded Syria from Egypt, but after a failed [[Siege of Acre (1799)|siege of Acre]] retreated to Egypt, repelling a British-Turkish invasion. Alerted to the political and military crisis in France, he returned, leaving his army behind, and used his popularity and army support to mount [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|a coup]] that made him [[First Consul]], the head of the French government.<ref>Georges Lefebvre, ''The French Revolution Volume II: from 1793 to 1799'' (1964) ch 13</ref>\n\n===1800===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1800 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n[[File:David - Napoleon crossing the Alps - Malmaison2.jpg|thumb|''[[Napoleon Crossing the Alps]]'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]].

The daring maneuver surprised the Austrians and forced a decisive engagement at [[Battle of Marengo|Marengo]] in June 1800. Victory there allowed Napoleon to strengthen his political position back in France.]]\nIn Italy, the Austrians under General Melas attacked first, and by the third week in April had advanced to the [[Var (river)|Var]], with Massena and half his army in [[Genoa]] besieged by land, by the Austrians and under tight blockade by the [[Royal Navy]]. In response Berthier moved&nbsp;\u2013 not to the threatened frontier, but to [[Geneva]]&nbsp;\u2013 and Massena was instructed to hold Genoa until 4 June. The Army of the Reserve was joined by Napoleon, and in mid-May set out to cross the Alps to attack the Austrian rear. The bulk of the army crossed by the [[Great St Bernard Pass]], still under snow, and by 24 May 40,000 troops were in the valley of the [[Po (river)|Po]]. Artillery was man-hauled over with great effort and ingenuity; however an Austrian-held fort on the Italian side (although bypassed by infantry and cavalry) prevented most of the artillery reaching the plains of Northern Italy until the start of June.\n\nOnce over the Alps, Napoleon did not proceed directly to the relief of Genoa. Instead, he advanced on [[Milan]], to improve his lines of communication (via the [[Simplon Pass|Simplon]] and [[Gotthard Pass|St Gotthard]] passes) and to threaten Melas's lines of communication with [[Mantua]] and [[Vienna]], in the belief that this would cause Melas to raise the siege of Genoa. He entered Milan on 2 June and by crossing to the South bank of the Po completely cut Melas's communications. Taking up a strong defensive position at Stradella, he confidently awaited an attempt by the Austrian Army to fight its way out.\n\nHowever, Melas had not raised the siege of Genoa, and on 4 June, Mass\u00e9na had duly capitulated. Napoleon then faced the possibility that, thanks to the British command of the Mediterranean, far from falling back, the Austrians could instead take Genoa as their new base and be supplied by sea. His defensive posture would not prevent this; he had to find and attack the Austrians before they could regroup. He therefore advanced from Stradella towards [[Alessandria]], where Melas was, apparently doing nothing. Convinced that Melas was about to retreat, Napoleon sent strong detachments to block Melas's routes northwards to the Po, and southwards to Genoa. At this point, Melas attacked, and for all the brilliance of the previous campaign, Napoleon found himself at a significant disadvantage in the consequent [[Battle of Marengo]] (14 June). Napoleon and the French came under huge pressure in the early hours of the battle. Melas believed he had already won and turned over delivery of the final blow to a subordinate. Suddenly, the prompt return of a detached French force under [[Louis Desaix|Desaix]] and a vigorous French counter-attack converted the battle into a decisive French victory. The Austrians lost half of their army, but Desaix was one of the French victims.\n\nMelas promptly entered into negotiations, which led to the Austrians evacuating Northern Italy west of the [[Ticino]] and suspending military operations in Italy. Napoleon returned to Paris after the victory, leaving [[Guillaume Brune|Brune]] to consolidate in Italy and begin a march toward Austria.\n\nIn the German theater, the armies of France and Austria faced each other across the Rhine at the beginning of 1800. [[Feldzeugmeister]] [[P\u00e1l Kray]] led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the [[Electorate of Bavaria]], 6,000 troops from the [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg]], 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]], and 7,000 militiamen from the [[County of Tyrol]]. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of [[Lake Constance|Lake Constance (Bodensee)]] to protect the [[Vorarlberg]]. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at [[Stockach]], near the northwestern end of [[Lake Constance]], only a day's march from French-held Switzerland.<ref>Arnold, 197\u2013199.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bataille de Hohenlinden.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|General Moreau]] at the [[Battle of Hohenlinden]], a decisive French victory in [[Bavaria]] which precipitated the end of the Revolutionary Wars]]\n[[General of Division]] [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau]] commanded a modestly-equipped army of 137,000 French troops. Of these, 108,000 troops were available for field operations while the other 29,000 watched the Swiss border and held the Rhine fortresses. First Consul [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] offered a plan of operations based on outflanking the Austrians by a push from Switzerland, but Moreau declined to follow it. Rather, Moreau planned to cross the Rhine near [[Basel]] where the river swung to the north. A French column would distract Kray from Moreau's true intentions by crossing the Rhine from the west. Bonaparte wanted [[Claude Lecourbe]]'s corps to be detached to Italy after the initial battles, but Moreau had other plans.<ref name=Arnold199>Arnold, 199\u2013201</ref> Through a series of complicated maneuvers in which he flanked, double flanked, and reflanked Kray's army, Moreau's army lay on the eastern slope of the [[Black Forest]], while portions of Kray's army was still guarded the passes on the other side.<ref>W.M. Sloane, ''Life of Napoleon''. France, 1896, p. 109.</ref> On 3 May 1800 Moreau and Kray fought [[Battle of Stockach (1800)|battles at Engen and Stockach]]. The fighting near [[Engen, Germany|Engen]] resulted in a stalemate with heavy losses on both sides. However, while the two main armies were engaged at Engen, [[Claude Lecourbe]] captured [[Stockach]] from its Austrian defenders under Joseph, Prince of Lorraine-Vaudemont. The loss of this main supply base at Stockach compelled Kray to order a retreat to [[Messkirch]], where they enjoyed a more favourable defensive position. However, it also meant that any retreat by Kray into Austria via Switzerland and the [[Vorarlberg]] was cut off.<ref>Sloane, 109.</ref>\n\nOn 4 and 5 May, the French launched repeated and fruitless assaults on the Messkirch. At nearby [[Sauldorf|Krumbach]], where the Austrians also had the superiority of position and force, the 1st Demi-Brigade took the village and the heights around it, which gave them a commanding aspect over Messkirch.  Subsequently, Kray withdrew his forces to [[Sigmaringen]], followed closely by the French. Fighting at nearby [[Battle of Biberach (1800)|Biberach an der Ris]] ensued on 9 May; action principally consisted of the 25,000-man-strong French \"Center\", commanded by [[Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr]].<ref>Sloane, pp. 109\u201310.</ref> After being flanked by General Moreau, who approached Ulm from the east and overwhelmed his outposts at [[Battle of H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt (1800)|Battle of H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt]], Kray retreated to Munich. Again, on 10 May, the Austrians withdrew with heavy losses, this time to Ulm.<ref>Digby Smith, ''Napoleonic Wars Databook''. London: Greenhill Press, 1998, p. 178.</ref>\n\nA several month armistice followed, during which Kray was replaced by the [[Archduke John of Austria|Archduke John]], with the Austrian army retiring behind the river Inn. Austrian reluctance to accept negotiated terms caused the French to end the armistice in mid-November, effective in two weeks. When the armistice ended, John advanced over the Inn towards [[Munich]]. His army was defeated in small engagements at the battles of [[Battle of Ampfing (1800)|Ampfing]] and [[Neuburg an der Donau]], and decisively in the forests before the city at [[Battle of Hohenlinden|Hohenlinden]] on 3 December. Moreau began a march on [[Vienna]], and the Austrians soon sued for peace, ending the war on the continent.\n\n===1801===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1801 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n[[File:Bataille algesiras.jpg|thumb|[[First Battle of Algeciras]]]]\nBy 9 February, the Austrians had signed the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]], ending the war on the continent. The war against the United Kingdom continued (with Neapolitan harbours closed to her by the [[Treaty of Florence]], signed on 28 March), and the Turks invaded Egypt in March, losing to [[Jean-Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber|Kl\u00e9ber]] at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]. The exhausted French force in Egypt, however, surrendered in August.\n\nThe naval war also continued, with the United Kingdom maintaining a blockade of France by sea. Non-combatants Russia, [[Prussia]], Denmark, and Sweden joined to protect neutral shipping from British attacks, but were unsuccessful. British Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] defied orders and attacked the Danish fleet in harbor at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|Battle of Copenhagen]], destroying much of the fleet of one of France's more steady allies during the period. An armistice prevented him from continuing into the [[Baltic Sea]] to attack the Russian fleet at Reval ([[Tallinn]]). Meanwhile, off Gibraltar, the outnumbered French squadron under [[Linois]] rebuffed a first British attack under [[James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez|Saumarez]] in the [[First Battle of Algeciras]], capturing a line-of-battle ship. In the [[Second Battle of Algeciras]], four days later, the British captured a French ship and sank two others, killing around 2000 French for the loss of 12 British.\n\n===1802===\nIn 1802, the British and French signed the [[Treaty of Amiens]], ending the war. The peace held for less than a year but still constituted the longest period of peace between the two countries during the period 1793\u20131815. The treaty is generally considered to be the most appropriate point to mark the transition between the French Revolutionary Wars and the [[Napoleonic Wars]], although Napoleon was not [[Coronation of Napoleon I|crowned emperor]] until 1804.\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Bataille Jemmapes.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|right|alt=Colored painting showing French army at Varoux |The armies of the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] at [[Battle of Jemappes|Jemappes]] in 1792. With chaos internally and enemies on the borders, the French were in a period of uncertainty during the early years of the Revolutionary Wars. By 1797, however, France dominated much of Western Europe, conquering the Rhineland, the Netherlands, and the Italian peninsula while erecting a series of sister republics and puppet states stretching from Spain to the German heartland.]]\nThe [[French Revolution]] transformed nearly all aspects of French and European life. The powerful sociopolitical forces unleashed by a people seeking [[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9|libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, and fraternit\u00e9]] made certain that even warfare was not spared this upheaval. 18th-century armies&nbsp;\u2013 with their rigid protocols, static operational strategy, unenthusiastic soldiers, and aristocratic officer classes&nbsp;\u2013 underwent massive remodeling as the French monarchy and nobility gave way to [[Liberalism|liberal assemblies]] obsessed with external threats. The fundamental shifts in warfare that occurred during the period have prompted scholars to identify the era as the beginning of \"modern war\".<ref>Lester Kurtz and Jennifer Turpin, ''Encyclopedia of violence, peace and conflict, Volume 2.'' p. 425</ref>\n\nIn 1791 the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] passed the \"Drill-Book\" legislation, implementing a series of infantry doctrines created by French theorists because of their defeat by the Prussians in the [[Seven Years' War]].<ref>David G. Chandler, The Campaigns of Napoleon. p. 136</ref> The new developments hoped to exploit the intrinsic bravery of the French soldier, made even more powerful by the explosive nationalist forces of the Revolution. The changes also placed a faith on the ordinary soldier that would be completely unacceptable in earlier times; French troops were expected to harass the enemy and remain loyal enough to not desert, a benefit other Ancien R\u00e9gime armies did not have.\n\nFollowing the declaration of war in 1792, an imposing array of enemies converging on French borders prompted the government in Paris to adopt radical measures. 23 August 1793, would become a historic day in military history; on that date the [[National Convention]] called a [[lev\u00e9e en masse]], or mass conscription, for the first time in human history. By summer of the following year, conscription made some 500,000 men available for service and the French began to deal blows to their European enemies.<ref>T. C. W. Blanning, The French Revolutionary Wars. p. 109</ref>\n\nArmies during the Revolution became noticeably larger than their Holy Roman counterparts, and combined with the new enthusiasm of the troops, the tactical and strategic opportunities became profound. By 1797 the French had defeated the [[First Coalition]], occupied the Low Countries, the west bank of the Rhine, and Northern Italy, objectives which had defied the [[House of Valois|Valois]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] dynasties for centuries. Unsatisfied with the results, many European powers formed a [[Second Coalition]], but by 1801 this too had been decisively beaten. Another key aspect of French success was the changes wrought in the officer classes. Traditionally, European armies left major command positions to those who could be trusted, namely, the aristocracy. The hectic nature of the French Revolution, however, tore apart France's old army, meaning new men were required to become officers and commanders.\n\nIn addition to opening a flood of tactical and strategic opportunities, the Revolutionary Wars also laid the foundation for modern military theory. Later authors that wrote about \"nations in arms\" drew inspiration from the French Revolution, in which dire circumstances seemingly mobilized the entire French nation for war and incorporated nationalism into the fabric of military history.<ref>Parker, Geoffrey. The Cambridge history of warfare. p. 189</ref> Although the reality of war in the France of 1795 would be different from that in the France of 1915, conceptions and mentalities of war evolved significantly. [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]] correctly analyzed the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras to give posterity a thorough and complete theory of war that emphasized struggles between nations occurring everywhere, from the battlefield to the legislative assemblies, and to the very way that people think.<ref>Peter Paret, Clausewitz and the State. p. 332</ref> War now emerged as a vast panorama of physical and psychological forces heading for victory or defeat.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Military career of Napoleon Bonaparte]]\n* [[Napoleonic Wars]]\n* [[Military history of France]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=note|colwidth=50em}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=25em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Clodfelter |first=M. |title=Warfare and Armed Conflicts: A Statistical Encyclopedia of Casualty and Other Figures, 1492\u20132015 |publisher=McFarland |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |year=2017 |edition=4th |isbn=978-0786474707 |ref=harv }}\n* {{Cite EB1911 |last=Atkinson |first=Charles Francis |last2=Hannay |first2=David McDowall|authorlink=David Hannay (historian) |wstitle=French Revolutionary Wars |volume=11 |pages=171\u2013205}}\n* Bertaud, Jean-Paul.

They pitted [[French First Republic|France]] against [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and several other monarchies. They are divided in two periods: the [[War of the First Coalition]] (1792\u201397) and the [[War of the Second Coalition]] (1798\u20131802). Initially confined to Europe, the fighting gradually assumed a global dimension. After a decade of constant warfare and aggressive diplomacy, France had conquered a wide array of territories, from the [[Italian Peninsula]] and the [[Low Countries]] in Europe to the [[Louisiana Territory]] in North America. French success in these conflicts ensured the spread of revolutionary principles over much of Europe.\n\nAs early as 1791, the other monarchies of Europe looked with outrage at the revolution and its upheavals; and they considered whether they should intervene, either in support of [[King Louis XVI]], to prevent the spread of revolution, or to take advantage of the chaos in France. Anticipating an attack{{Citation needed|reason=evidence that the Girondins wanted a preemptive war is needed|date=March 2019}}, France declared war on [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and Austria in the spring of 1792 and they responded with a coordinated invasion that was eventually turned back at the [[Battle of Valmy]] in September. This victory emboldened the [[National Convention]] to [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|abolish the monarchy]].<ref>TCW Blanning, ''The French Revolutionary Wars''. pp. 78\u201379.</ref> A series of victories by the [[French Revolutionary Armies|new French armies]] abruptly ended with defeat at [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)|Neerwinden]] in the spring of 1793. The French suffered additional defeats in the remainder of the year and these difficult times allowed the [[Jacobins]] to rise to power and impose the [[Reign of Terror]] to unify the nation.\n\nIn 1794, the situation improved dramatically for the French as huge victories at [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]] against the Austrians and at the [[Battle of the Black Mountain|Black Mountain]] against the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] signaled the start of a new stage in the wars. By 1795, the French had captured the [[Austrian Netherlands]] and knocked Spain and Prussia out of the war with the [[Peace of Basel]]. A hitherto unknown general named [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] began his first [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|campaign in Italy]] in April 1796. In less than a year, French armies under Napoleon decimated the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] forces and evicted them from the Italian peninsula, winning almost every battle and capturing 150,000 prisoners. With French forces marching towards [[Vienna]], the Austrians sued for peace and agreed to the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], ending the First Coalition against the Republic.\n\nThe War of the Second Coalition began in 1798 with the [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|French invasion of Egypt]], headed by Napoleon. The Allies took the opportunity presented by the French effort in the Middle East to regain territories lost from the First Coalition. The war began well for the Allies in Europe, where they gradually pushed the French out of Italy and invaded Switzerland&nbsp;\u2013 racking up victories at [[Battle of Magnano|Magnano]], [[Battle of Cassano (1799)|Cassano]] and [[Battle of Novi (1799)|Novi]] along the way. However, their efforts largely unraveled with the French victory at [[Second Battle of Zurich|Zurich]] in September 1799, which caused [[Russian Empire|Russia]] to drop out of the war.<ref>TCW Blanning, ''The French Revolutionary Wars''. pp. 254\u201355.</ref> Meanwhile, Napoleon's forces annihilated a series of Egyptian and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] armies at the battles of the [[Battle of the Pyramids|Pyramids]], [[Battle of Mount Tabor (1799)|Mount Tabor]] and [[Battle of Abukir (1799)|Abukir]]. These victories and the conquest of Egypt further enhanced Napoleon's popularity back in France, and he returned in triumph in the fall of 1799. However, the [[Royal Navy]] had won the [[Battle of the Nile]] in 1798, further strengthening British control of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].\n\nNapoleon's arrival from Egypt led to the fall of the [[French Directory|Directory]] in the [[Coup of 18 Brumaire]], with Napoleon installing himself as Consul. Napoleon then reorganized the French army and launched a new assault against the Austrians in Italy during the spring of 1800. This brought a decisive French victory at the [[Battle of Marengo]] in June 1800, after which the Austrians withdrew from the peninsula once again. Another crushing French triumph at [[Battle of Hohenlinden|Hohenlinden]] in Bavaria forced the Austrians to seek peace for a second time, leading to the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] in 1801. With Austria and Russia out of the war, the United Kingdom found itself increasingly isolated and agreed to the [[Treaty of Amiens]] with Napoleon's government in 1802, concluding the Revolutionary Wars. However, the lingering tensions proved too difficult to contain, and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] began over a year later with the formation of the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]], continuing the series of [[Coalition Wars]].\n\n==War of the First Coalition==\n{{refimprove|section|date=April 2018}}<!--Very few/no citations in 1795, 1796, 1797, and 1798 subsections.. see [[WP:Summary style]]-->\n{{Main article|War of the First Coalition}}\n{{See also|List of battles of the War of the First Coalition}}\n===1791\u20131792===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1792 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n\nThe key figure in initial foreign reaction to the revolution was [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], brother of Louis XVI's Queen [[Marie Antoinette]]. Leopold had initially looked on the Revolution with equanimity, but became more and more disturbed as the Revolution became more radical, although he still hoped to avoid war. On 27 August, Leopold and King [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]] of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], in consultation with [[emigr\u00e9|emigrant French nobles]], issued the [[Declaration of Pillnitz]], which declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe in the well-being of Louis and his family, and threatened vague but severe consequences if anything should befall them. Although Leopold saw the Pillnitz Declaration as a non-committal gesture to placate the sentiments of French monarchists and nobles, it was seen in France as a serious threat and was denounced by the revolutionary leaders.<ref name=\"Georges Lefebvre 1964\">Georges Lefebvre, ''The French Revolution Volume II: from 1793 to 1799'' (1964) ch. 1.</ref>\n\nFrance eventually issued an ultimatum demanding that the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] of Austria under [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], who also was Emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], renounce any hostile alliances and withdraw its troops from the French border.<ref>Lecky, William Edward Hartpole, [https://archive.org/stream/historyenglandei05leck#page/601/mode/1up A History of England in the Eighteenth Century] Volume V (1890) p. 601</ref> The reply was evasive, and the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Assembly]] voted for war on 20 April 1792 against [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] (who succeeded Leopold II), after a long list of grievances presented by foreign minister [[Charles Fran\u00e7ois Dumouriez]]. Dumouriez prepared an immediate invasion of the [[Austrian Netherlands]], where he expected the local population to rise against Austrian rule [[Brabant Revolution|as they had earlier in 1790]]. However, the revolution had thoroughly disorganized the army, and the forces raised were insufficient for the invasion. Following the declaration of war, French soldiers deserted ''en masse'' and in one case murdered their general, [[Th\u00e9obald Dillon]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles Esdaile|title=The French Wars 1792\u20131815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0WvnpSQlbsC&pg=PA7|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|page=7|isbn=978-0203209745}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Manifeste de Brunswick caricature 1792.jpg|thumb|left|Anonymous caricature depicting the treatment given to the [[Brunswick Manifesto]] by the French population]]\n\nWhile the revolutionary government frantically raised fresh troops and reorganized its armies, a mostly Prussian Allied army under [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick]] assembled at [[Koblenz]] on the Rhine. The duke then issued a proclamation called the [[Brunswick Manifesto]] (July 1792), written by the French king's cousin, [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9]], the leader of an [[Army of Cond\u00e9|\u00e9migr\u00e9 corps within the Allied army]], which declared the Allies' intent to restore the king to his full powers and to treat any person or town who opposed them as rebels to be condemned to death by [[martial law]]. This, however, had the effect of strengthening the resolve of the revolutionary army and government to oppose them by any means necessary.\n\nOn 10 August, [[10 August (French Revolution)|a crowd stormed]] the [[Tuileries Palace]], seizing the king and his family. On 19 August 1792, the invasion by Brunswick's army commenced, with Brunswick's army easily taking the fortresses of [[Longwy]] and [[Verdun-sur-Meuse|Verdun]]. The invasion continued, but at [[Battle of Valmy|Valmy]] on 20 September, the invaders came to a stalemate against Dumouriez and [[Fran\u00e7ois Christophe Kellermann|Kellermann]] in which the highly professional French [[artillery]] distinguished itself. Although the battle was a tactical draw, it gave a great boost to French morale. Further, the Prussians, finding that the campaign had been longer and more costly than predicted, decided that the cost and risk of continued fighting was too great and, with winter approaching, they decided to retreat from France to preserve their army. The next day, the monarchy was formally abolished as the [[First French Republic|First Republic]] was declared (21 September 1792).<ref>William Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (1989) p. 194</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the French had been successful on several other fronts, occupying [[Savoy]] and [[Nice]], which were parts of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], while General [[Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine|Custine]] invaded Germany, occupying several German towns along the Rhine and reaching as far as [[Frankfurt]]. Dumouriez went on the offensive in the Austrian Netherlands once again, winning a great victory over the Austrians at the [[Battle of Jemappes]] on 6 November and occupying the entire country by the beginning of winter.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jeremy Black|title=British Foreign Policy in an Age of Revolutions, 1783\u20131793|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zgbjPESz3dcC&pg=PA408|year=1994|page=408|isbn=978-0521466844}}</ref>\n\n===1793===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1793 in the French Revolutionary Wars|Flanders Campaign|War in the Vend\u00e9e}}\n[[File:R\u00e9volte Fouesnant.jpg|thumb|right|While the [[First Coalition]] attacked the new Republic, France faced civil war and counter-revolutionary [[guerrilla war]].

Nonetheless, the Coalition allies launched a determined drive to invade France during the [[Flanders Campaign]].<ref>Alan Forrest, ''Soldiers of the French Revolution'' (1989)</ref>\n\nFrance suffered severe reverses at first. They were driven out of the [[Austrian Netherlands]], and serious revolts flared in the west and south of France. One of these, at [[Toulon]], was the first serious taste of action for an unknown young artillery officer [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]]. He contributed to the [[Siege of Toulon|siege of the city and its harbor]] by planning an effective assault with well-placed artillery batteries raining projectiles down on rebel positions. This performance helped make his reputation as a capable tactician, and it fueled his meteoric rise to military and political power. Once the city was occupied, he participated in pacifying the rebelling citizens of Toulon with the same artillery that he first used to conquer the city.<ref>Robert Forczyk, ''Toulon 1793: Napoleon's First Great Victory'' (2005)</ref>\n\nBy the end of the year, large new armies had turned back foreign invaders, and the [[Reign of Terror]], a fierce policy of repression, had suppressed internal revolts. The French military was in the ascendant. [[Lazare Carnot]], a scientist and prominent member of the [[Committee of Public Safety]], organized the [[French Revolutionary Army|fourteen armies of the Republic]], and was then nicknamed the Organizer of the Victory.<ref>Paddy Griffith (1998). ''The Art of War of Revolutionary France, 1789\u20131802''</ref>\n\n===1794===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n[[File:Bataille de Fleurus 1794.JPG|thumb|[[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|General Jourdan]] at the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|battle of Fleurus]], 26 June 1794]]\nThe year 1794 brought increased success to the French armies. On the [[Alps|Alpine]] frontier, there was little change, with the French invasion of [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] failing. On the Spanish border, the French under General [[Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Dugommier|Dugommier]] rallied from their defensive positions at [[Bayonne]] and [[Perpignan]], driving the Spanish out of [[Roussillon]] and invading [[Catalonia]]. Dugommier was killed in the [[Battle of San-Lorenzo de la Muga|Battle of the Black Mountain]] in November.\n\nOn the northern front in the [[Flanders Campaign]], the Austrians and French both prepared offensives in Belgium, with the Austrians besieging [[Landrecies]] and advancing towards [[Mons]] and [[Maubeuge]]. The French prepared an offensive on multiple fronts, with two armies in [[Flanders]] under [[Charles Pichegru|Pichegru]] and [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]], and [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]] attacking from the German border. The French withstood several damaging but inconclusive actions before regaining the initiative at the battles of [[Battle of Tourcoing|Tourcoing]] and [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]] in June. The French armies drove the Austrians, British, and Dutch beyond the [[Rhine (river)|Rhine]], occupying Belgium, the [[Rhineland]], and the south of the Netherlands.\n\nOn the middle Rhine front in July, General Michaud's Army of the Rhine attempted two offensives in July in the [[Battle of Trippstadt|Vosges]], the second of which was successful but not followed up, allowing for a Prussian counter-attack in September. Otherwise this sector of the front was largely quiet over the course of the year.\n\nAt sea, the French Atlantic Fleet succeeded in holding off a British attempt to interdict a vital cereal [[convoy]] from the United States on the [[Glorious First of June]], though at the cost of one quarter of its strength. In the Caribbean, the British fleet landed in [[Martinique]] in February, taking the whole island by 24 March and holding it until the [[Treaty of Amiens]], and in [[Guadeloupe]] in April, where they captured the island briefly but were driven out by [[Victor Hugues]] later in the year. In the Mediterranean, following the British evacuation of [[Toulon]], the Corsican leader [[Pasquale Paoli]] agreed with admiral [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Samuel Hood]] to place Corsica under British protection in return for assistance capturing French garrisons at [[Siege of Saint-Florent|Saint-Florent]], [[Siege of Bastia|Bastia]], and [[Siege of Calvi|Calvi]], creating the short-lived [[Anglo-Corsican Kingdom]].\n\nBy the end of the year French armies had won victories on all fronts, and as the year closed they began advancing into the Netherlands.\n\n===1795===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1795 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n[[File:Combat Quiberon 1795.jpg|thumb|''[[Arm\u00e9e des \u00c9migr\u00e9s]]'' at the [[Invasion of France (1795)|Battle of Quiberon]]]]\n[[File:Helder Morel-Fatio.jpg|thumb|[[Capture of the Dutch fleet at Den Helder|Capture of the Dutch fleet]] by the French hussars]]\nThe year opened with French forces in the process of attacking the [[Dutch Republic]] in the middle of winter. The Dutch people rallied to the French call and started the [[Batavian Revolution]]. City after city was occupied by the French. [[Capture of the Dutch fleet at Den Helder|The Dutch fleet was captured]], and the stadtholder [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]] fled to be replaced by a popular [[Batavian Republic]], a [[sister republic]] which supported the revolutionary cause and signed a treaty with the French, ceding the territories of [[North Brabant]] and [[Maastricht]] to France on 16 May.\n\nWith the Netherlands falling, [[Prussia]] also decided to leave the coalition, signing the [[Peace of Basel]] on 6 April, ceding the west bank of the [[Rhine]] to France. This freed Prussia to finish the occupation of Poland.\n\nThe French army in Spain advanced in [[Catalonia]] while taking [[Bilbao]] and [[Vitoria, Spain|Vitoria]] and marching toward [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]]. By 10 July, Spain also decided to make peace, recognizing the revolutionary government and ceding the territory of [[Santo Domingo]], but returning to the pre-war borders in Europe. This left the armies on the [[Pyrenees]] free to march east and reinforce the armies on the [[Alps]], and the combined army overran [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]].\n\nMeanwhile, [[Great Britain|Britain]]'s attempt to reinforce the [[Revolt in the Vend\u00e9e|rebels in the Vend\u00e9e]] by landing troops at [[Invasion of France (1795)|Quiberon]] failed, and a conspiracy to overthrow the republican government from within ended when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s garrison [[13 Vend\u00e9miaire|used cannon to fire grapeshot]] into the attacking mob (which led to the establishment of the [[French Directory|Directory]]).\n\nOn the Rhine frontier, General [[Charles Pichegru|Pichegru]], negotiating with the exiled [[House of Bourbon|Royalists]], betrayed his army and forced the evacuation of [[Mannheim]] and the failure of the siege of [[Mainz]] by [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]]. This was a moderate setback to the position of the French.\n\nIn northern Italy, victory at the [[Battle of Loano]] in November gave France access to the Italian peninsula.\n\n===1796===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1796 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n[[File:La Bataille du Pont d'Arcole.jpg|thumb|[[Napoleon|General Bonaparte]] and his troops crossing the [[Battle of the Bridge of Arcole|bridge of Arcole]]]]\n[[File:Bitva u Lodi, Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Lejeune.jpg|thumb|Napoleon Bonaparte defeats the Austrians at the [[Battle of Lodi]]]]\nThe French prepared a great advance on three fronts, with Jourdan and [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]] on the Rhine, and Bonaparte in Italy. The three armies were to link up in [[State of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and march on [[Vienna]]. Jourdan and Moreau advanced rapidly into Germany, and Moreau had reached [[Bavaria]] and the edge of Tyrol by September, but Jourdan was defeated by [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], and both armies were forced to retreat back across the Rhine.\n\nNapoleon, on the other hand, was completely successful [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars#Bonaparte's war|in a daring invasion of Italy]]. He left Paris on 11 March for [[Nice]] to take over the weak and poorly supplied [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]], arriving on 26 March. The army was already being reorganised and supplied when he arrived, and he found that the situation was rapidly improving. He was soon able to carry out the plan for the invasion of Italy that he had been advocating for years, which provided for an advance over the Apennines near Altare to attack the enemy position of [[Ceva]].\n\nThe [[Montenotte Campaign]] opened after [[Johann Peter Beaulieu|Johann Beaulieu]]'s Austrian forces attacked the extreme French eastern flank near [[Genoa]] on 10 April. Bonaparte countered by attacking and crushing the isolated right wing of the allied armies at the [[Battle of Montenotte]] on 12 April. The next day he defeated an Austro-Sardinian force at the [[Battle of Millesimo]]. He then won a victory at the [[Second Battle of Dego]], driving the Austrians northeast, away from their Piedmontese allies. Satisfied that the Austrians were temporarily inert, Bonaparte harried [[Michelangelo Alessandro Colli-Marchi|Michelangelo Colli]]'s Piedmontese at [[Battle of Ceva|Ceva]] and [[San Michele Mondovi]] before whipping them at the [[Battle of Mondov\u00ec]]. A week later, on 28 April, the Piedmontese signed an armistice at [[Cherasco]], withdrawing from the hostilities. On 18 May they signed a [[Treaty of Paris (1796)|peace treaty at Paris]], ceding [[Savoy]] and [[Nice]] and allowing the French bases to be used against Austria.\n\nAfter a short pause, Napoleon carried out a brilliant flanking manoeuvre, and crossed the [[Po (river)|Po]] at [[Piacenza]], nearly cutting the Austrian line of retreat. The Austrians escaped after the [[Battle of Fombio]], but had their rear-guard mauled at [[Battle of Lodi|Lodi]] on 10 May, after which the French took [[Milan]]. Bonaparte then advanced eastwards again, drove off the Austrians in the [[Battle of Borghetto]] and in June began the [[Siege of Mantua (1796\u201397)|Siege of Mantua]]. [[Mantua]] was the strongest Austrian base in Italy. Meanwhile, the Austrians retreated north into the foothills of the [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]].\n\nDuring July and August, Austria sent a fresh army into Italy under [[Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser|Dagobert Wurmser]]. Wurmser attacked toward Mantua along the east side of [[Lake Garda]], sending [[Peter Quasdanovich]] down the west side in an effort to envelop Bonaparte. Bonaparte exploited the Austrian mistake of dividing their forces to defeat them in detail, but in so doing, he abandoned the siege of Mantua, which held out for another six months (Carl von Clauswitz mentioned in [[On War]] that the siege might have been able to be kept up if Bonaparte had [[Investment (military)|circumvallated]] the city<ref>''On War'', Book II, Chapter 5, 24., Carl von Clausewitz, translated by Michael Howard, p. 188 {{ISBN|1-85715-121-6}}</ref>). Quasdanovich was overcome at [[Battle of Lonato|Lonato]] on 3 August and Wurmser at [[Battle of Castiglione|Castiglione]] on 5 August. Wurmser retreated to the Tyrol, and Bonaparte resumed the siege.\n\nIn September, Bonaparte marched north against [[Trento]] in Tyrol, but Wurmser had already marched toward Mantua by the [[Brenta (river)|Brenta]] valley, leaving [[Paul Davidovich]]'s force to hold off the French. Bonaparte overran the holding force at the [[Battle of Rovereto]]. Then he followed Wurmser down the Brenta valley, to fall upon and defeat the Austrians at the [[Battle of Bassano]] on 8 September. Wurmser elected to march for Mantua with a large portion of his surviving troops. The Austrians evaded Bonaparte's attempts to intercept them but were driven into the city after a pitched battle on 15 September. This left nearly 30,000 Austrians trapped in the fortress. This number rapidly diminished due to disease, combat losses, and hunger.\n\nThe Austrians sent yet another army under [[J\u00f3zsef Alvinczi]] against Bonaparte in November. Again the Austrians divided their effort, sending Davidovich's corps from the north while Alvinczi's main body attacked from the east. At first they proved victorious over the French at [[Second Battle of Bassano|Bassano]], [[Battle of Calliano|Calliano]], and [[Battle of Caldiero (1796)|Caldiero]]. But Bonaparte ultimately defeated Alvinczi in the [[Battle of Arcole]] southeast of [[Verona]]. The French then turned on Davidovich in great strength and chased him into the Tyrol. Wurmser's only sortie was late and ineffectual.\n\nThe [[War in the Vend\u00e9e|rebellion in the Vend\u00e9e]] was also finally crushed in 1796 by [[Louis Lazare Hoche|Hoche]], but Hoche's [[Exp\u00e9dition d'Irlande|attempt to land a large invasion force in Ireland]] was unsuccessful.\n\n===1797===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1797 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n[[File:Napoleon at the Battle of Rivoli.jpg|thumb|right|Napoleon Bonaparte at the [[Battle of Rivoli]]]]\n[[File:Mots au combat d\u00e9pouill\u00e9s de leurs uniformes et armes en 1797.jpg|thumb|Soldiers killed in battle in 1797]]\nOn 14 February, British admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Jervis]] met and defeated a Spanish fleet off Portugal at the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1797)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]]. This prevented the Spanish fleet from rendezvousing with the French, removing a threat of invasion to Britain. However, the British fleet was weakened over the rest of the year by the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies (1797)|Spithead and Nore mutinies]], which kept many ships in port through the summer.\n\nOn 22 February French invasion force consisting of 1,400 troops from the ''[[La Legion Noire]]'' (The Black Legion) under the command of Irish American Colonel [[William Tate (soldier)|William Tate]] [[Battle of Fishguard|landed near Fishguard]] (Wales). They were met by a quickly assembled group of around 500 British [[military reserve force|reservists]], [[militia]] and sailors under the command of [[John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor]]. After brief clashes with the local civilian population and Lord Cawdor's forces on 23 February, Tate was forced into an [[unconditional surrender]] by 24 February.\n\nIn Italy, [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s armies were laying [[Siege of Mantua (1796-1797)|siege to Mantua]] at the beginning of the year, and a second attempt by Austrians under [[Joseph Alvinczy]] to raise the siege was driven off at the [[Battle of Rivoli]], where the French scored a decisive victory. Finally, on 2 February, [[Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser|Wurmser]] surrendered Mantua and 18,000 troops. The Papal forces sued for peace, which was granted at [[Tolentino]] on 19 February. Napoleon was now free to attack the Austrian heartland. He advanced directly toward Austria over the [[Julian Alps]], sending [[Barthelemy Catherine Joubert|Barth\u00e9lemy Joubert]] to invade the [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]].\n\n[[Archduke Charles of Austria]] hurried from the German front to defend Austria, but he was defeated at the [[Tagliamento]] on 16 March, and Napoleon proceeded into Austria, occupying [[Klagenfurt]] and preparing for a rendezvous with Joubert in front of [[Vienna]]. In Germany, the armies of [[Louis Lazare Hoche|Hoche]] and [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]] crossed the [[Rhine]] again in April after the previous year's failure. The victories of Napoleon had frightened the Austrians into making peace, and they concluded the [[Peace of Leoben]] in April, ending hostilities. However, his absence from Italy had allowed the outbreak of the revolt known as the [[Veronese Easters]] on 17 April, which was put down eight days later.\n\nAlthough Britain remained at war with France, this effectively ended the [[First Coalition]]. Austria later signed the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], ceding the [[Austrian Netherlands]] to France and recognizing the French border at the Rhine. Austria and France also partitioned [[Venice]] between them.\n\n===1798===\n{{Main article|Campaigns of 1798 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French campaign in Egypt and Syria|Quasi-War|French invasion of Switzerland|Irish Rebellion of 1798}}\n[[File:Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Baron Lejeune 001.jpg|thumb|In July 1798, French forces under Napoleon annihilated an Egyptian army at the [[Battle of the Pyramids]].

The British fleet bears down on the French line.]]\nWith only Britain left to fight and not enough of a navy to fight a direct war, Napoleon conceived of an [[French Invasion of Egypt|invasion of Egypt]] in 1798, which satisfied his personal desire for glory and the Directory's desire to have him far from Paris. The military objective of the expedition is not entirely clear, but may have been to threaten [[East India Company|British dominance in India]].\n\nNapoleon sailed from [[Toulon]] to [[Alexandria]], taking Malta on the way, and landing in June. Marching to [[Cairo]], he won a great victory at the [[Battle of the Pyramids]]; however, his fleet was sunk by [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]] at the [[Battle of the Nile]], stranding him in Egypt. Napoleon spent the remainder of the year consolidating his position in Egypt.<ref>Paul Strathern, ''Napoleon in Egypt: The Greatest Glory'' (2007)</ref>\n\nThe French government also took advantage of internal strife in Switzerland to [[French invasion of Switzerland|invade]], establishing the [[Helvetian Republic]] and annexing [[Geneva]]. French troops also deposed [[Pope Pius VI]], establishing a [[Roman Republic (18th century)|republic in Rome]].\n\nAn expeditionary force was sent to [[County Mayo]], in Ireland, to assist in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion against Britain]] in the summer of 1798. It had some success against British forces, most [[Battle of Castlebar|notably at Castlebar]], but was [[Battle of Ballinamuck|ultimately routed]] while trying to reach [[Dublin]]. French ships sent to assist them [[Battle of Tory Island|were captured]] by the Royal Navy off [[County Donegal]].\n\nThe French were also under pressure in the [[Southern Netherlands]] and Luxembourg where the local people revolted against conscription and anti-religious violence ([[Peasants' War (1798)|Peasants' War]]). The French had taken this territory in 1794, but it was officially theirs in 1797 due to a treaty with Austria. The French forces easily handled the Peasants' rebellion in the Southern Netherlands, and were able to put down the revolting forces in under 2 months.\n\nThe French in 1798 fought an undeclared war at sea against the United States, that was known variously as the \"[[Quasi-War]]\", the \"Half War\" and the \"Pirate Wars\". It was resolved peaceably with the [[Convention of 1800]].\n\n==War of the Second Coalition==\n{{Main article|War of the Second Coalition}}\nBritain and Austria organized a new coalition against France in 1798, including for the first time the [[Russian Empire]], although no action occurred until 1799 except against the [[kingdom of the Two Sicilies]].\n\n===1799===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1799 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n[[File:Bataille d'Aboukir, 25 juillet 1799.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Abukir (1799)|Battle of Abukir]] in 1799]]\n[[File:Bataille du mont-thabor.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Mount Tabor (1799)|Battle of Mount Tabor]] against the Ottomans]]\nIn Egypt, Napoleon had consolidated his control of the country for the time being. Soon after the beginning of the year, he mounted an invasion of Syria, capturing [[El Arish]] and [[Jaffa]]. On 17 March, he laid [[Siege of Acre (1799)|siege to Acre]], and defeated an Ottoman effort to relieve the city at the [[Battle of Mount Tabor (1799)|Battle of Mount Tabor]] on 17 April. However, his repeated assaults on Acre were driven back by Ottoman and British forces under the command of [[Jezzar Pasha]] and [[Sidney Smith (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Sidney Smith]]. By May, with [[pandemic|plague]] rampant in his army and no sign of success against the city, Napoleon was forced to retreat into Egypt. In July, Turkey, with the help of the British navy, mounted an invasion by sea from [[Rhodes]]. Napoleon attacked the Turkish beachheads and scored a crushing victory at the [[Battle of Abukir (1799)|Battle of Abukir]], capturing and killing the entire enemy army. In August, Napoleon decided to return to Europe, hearing of the political and military crisis in France. Leaving his army behind with [[Jean Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber|Kl\u00e9ber]] in command, he sailed through the British blockade to return to Paris and resolved to take control of the government there in a coup.\n\nIn Europe, the French Army of Observation, [[Army of the Danube order of battle|organized]] with 30,000&nbsp;men in four divisions, crossed the [[Rhine]] at [[Kehl]] and [[Basel]] in March 1799. The following day, it was renamed the Army of the Danube.<ref>Jourdan, p. 140.</ref> Under command of [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]], the army advanced in four columns through the Black Forest.

It was followed across the Rhine, also at Kehl, by the II. Division. The Third Division and the Reserve also crossed at Kehl, and then divided into two columns, III. Division traveling through the Black Forest via [[Oberkirch (Baden)|Oberkirch]], and the Reserve, with most of the artillery and horse, by the valley at [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], where they would find more forage, and then over the mountains past the [[Titisee]] to [[L\u00f6ffingen]] and [[H\u00fcfingen]].<ref>Jourdan, p. 97.</ref>\n\nThe major part of the imperial army, under command of the [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles']], had wintered immediately east of the [[Lech (river)|Lech]], which Jourdan knew, because he had sent agents into Germany with instructions to identify the location and strength of his enemy. This was less than {{convert|64|km|0}} distant; any passage over the Lech was facilitated by available bridges, both of permanent construction and temporary pontoons and a traverse through friendly territory.<ref>Rothenberg, pp. 70\u201374; Jourdan, pp. 65\u201388, 96\u2013100; Blanning, p. 232; {{in lang|de}} Ruth Broda. \"Schlacht von Ostrach:\u201c j\u00e4hrt sich zum 210.

At the intensely fought [[Battle of Ostrach]], 21\u20132 March 1799, the first battle of the War of the Second Coalition, Austrian forces, under the command of [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], defeated Jourdan's Army of the Danube. The French suffered significant losses and were forced to retreat from the region, taking up new positions to the west at Messkirch (M\u00f6\u00dfkirch, Me\u00dfkirch), and then at Stockach and Engen. At the second battle, in [[Battle of Stockach (1799)|Stockach]], on 27 March 1799, the Austrian army achieved a decisive victory over the French forces, and again pushed the French army west. Jourdan instructed his generals to take up positions in the Black Forest, and he himself established a base at Hornberg. From there, General Jourdan relegated command of the army to his chief of staff, [[Jean Augustin Ernouf]], and traveled to Paris to ask for more and better troops and, ultimately, to request a medical leave.<ref name=\"Young pp. 230\">Young, pp. 230\u2013345; Gallagher, p. 70\u201379; Jourdan, pp. 190\u2013204.</ref>\n\n[[File:Sen-Gotard by Suvorov troops in 1799.jpg|thumb|Russian General [[Alexander Suvorov]] crossing the [[St. Gotthard Pass]] during the [[Italian and Swiss expedition]] in 1799]]\nThe Army was reorganized, and a portion placed under the command of [[Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na]] and merged with the Army of Helvetia. Following the reorganization and change in command, the Army participated in several skirmishes and actions on the eastern part of the [[Swiss Plateau]], including the [[Battle of Winterthur (1799)|Battle of Winterthur]]. After this action, three forces of the imperial army united north of Z\u00fcrich, completing a partial encirclement of Massena's combined Army of the Danube and Army of Switzerland. A few days later, at the [[First Battle of Zurich]], Massena was forced west, across the Limmat. In late summer, 1799, Charles was ordered to support imperial activities in the middle Rhineland; he withdrew north across the Rhine, and marched toward [[Mannheim]], leaving Z\u00fcrich and northern Switzerland in the hands of the inexperienced [[Alexander Korsakov]] and 25,000 Russian troops. Although the highly capable [[Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze]] remained in support, his 15,000 men were not able to counter Korsakov's poor defensive arrangements. Three weeks later, at the [[Second Battle of Zurich]], the Russian force was annihilated, and Hotze was killed south of Z\u00fcrich. This left Massena in control of northern Switzerland, and closed forced Suvorov into an arduous three-week march into the Vorarlberg, where his troops arrived, starving and exhausted, in mid-October.<ref name=\"Young pp. 230\"/>\n\nNapoleon himself invaded Syria from Egypt, but after a failed [[Siege of Acre (1799)|siege of Acre]] retreated to Egypt, repelling a British-Turkish invasion. Alerted to the political and military crisis in France, he returned, leaving his army behind, and used his popularity and army support to mount [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|a coup]] that made him [[First Consul]], the head of the French government.<ref>Georges Lefebvre, ''The French Revolution Volume II: from 1793 to 1799'' (1964) ch 13</ref>\n\n===1800===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1800 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n[[File:David - Napoleon crossing the Alps - Malmaison2.jpg|thumb|''[[Napoleon Crossing the Alps]]'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]]. In one of the famous paintings of Napoleon, the Consul and his army are depicted crossing the Swiss Alps on their way to Italy. The daring maneuver surprised the Austrians and forced a decisive engagement at [[Battle of Marengo|Marengo]] in June 1800. Victory there allowed Napoleon to strengthen his political position back in France.]]\nIn Italy, the Austrians under General Melas attacked first, and by the third week in April had advanced to the [[Var (river)|Var]], with Massena and half his army in [[Genoa]] besieged by land, by the Austrians and under tight blockade by the [[Royal Navy]]. In response Berthier moved&nbsp;\u2013 not to the threatened frontier, but to [[Geneva]]&nbsp;\u2013 and Massena was instructed to hold Genoa until 4 June. The Army of the Reserve was joined by Napoleon, and in mid-May set out to cross the Alps to attack the Austrian rear. The bulk of the army crossed by the [[Great St Bernard Pass]], still under snow, and by 24 May 40,000 troops were in the valley of the [[Po (river)|Po]]. Artillery was man-hauled over with great effort and ingenuity; however an Austrian-held fort on the Italian side (although bypassed by infantry and cavalry) prevented most of the artillery reaching the plains of Northern Italy until the start of June.\n\nOnce over the Alps, Napoleon did not proceed directly to the relief of Genoa. Instead, he advanced on [[Milan]], to improve his lines of communication (via the [[Simplon Pass|Simplon]] and [[Gotthard Pass|St Gotthard]] passes) and to threaten Melas's lines of communication with [[Mantua]] and [[Vienna]], in the belief that this would cause Melas to raise the siege of Genoa. He entered Milan on 2 June and by crossing to the South bank of the Po completely cut Melas's communications. Taking up a strong defensive position at Stradella, he confidently awaited an attempt by the Austrian Army to fight its way out.\n\nHowever, Melas had not raised the siege of Genoa, and on 4 June, Mass\u00e9na had duly capitulated. Napoleon then faced the possibility that, thanks to the British command of the Mediterranean, far from falling back, the Austrians could instead take Genoa as their new base and be supplied by sea. His defensive posture would not prevent this; he had to find and attack the Austrians before they could regroup. He therefore advanced from Stradella towards [[Alessandria]], where Melas was, apparently doing nothing. Convinced that Melas was about to retreat, Napoleon sent strong detachments to block Melas's routes northwards to the Po, and southwards to Genoa. At this point, Melas attacked, and for all the brilliance of the previous campaign, Napoleon found himself at a significant disadvantage in the consequent [[Battle of Marengo]] (14 June). Napoleon and the French came under huge pressure in the early hours of the battle. Melas believed he had already won and turned over delivery of the final blow to a subordinate. Suddenly, the prompt return of a detached French force under [[Louis Desaix|Desaix]] and a vigorous French counter-attack converted the battle into a decisive French victory. The Austrians lost half of their army, but Desaix was one of the French victims.\n\nMelas promptly entered into negotiations, which led to the Austrians evacuating Northern Italy west of the [[Ticino]] and suspending military operations in Italy. Napoleon returned to Paris after the victory, leaving [[Guillaume Brune|Brune]] to consolidate in Italy and begin a march toward Austria.\n\nIn the German theater, the armies of France and Austria faced each other across the Rhine at the beginning of 1800. [[Feldzeugmeister]] [[P\u00e1l Kray]] led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the [[Electorate of Bavaria]], 6,000 troops from the [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg]], 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]], and 7,000 militiamen from the [[County of Tyrol]]. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of [[Lake Constance|Lake Constance (Bodensee)]] to protect the [[Vorarlberg]]. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at [[Stockach]], near the northwestern end of [[Lake Constance]], only a day's march from French-held Switzerland.<ref>Arnold, 197\u2013199.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bataille de Hohenlinden.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|General Moreau]] at the [[Battle of Hohenlinden]], a decisive French victory in [[Bavaria]] which precipitated the end of the Revolutionary Wars]]\n[[General of Division]] [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau]] commanded a modestly-equipped army of 137,000 French troops. Of these, 108,000 troops were available for field operations while the other 29,000 watched the Swiss border and held the Rhine fortresses. First Consul [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] offered a plan of operations based on outflanking the Austrians by a push from Switzerland, but Moreau declined to follow it. Rather, Moreau planned to cross the Rhine near [[Basel]] where the river swung to the north. A French column would distract Kray from Moreau's true intentions by crossing the Rhine from the west. Bonaparte wanted [[Claude Lecourbe]]'s corps to be detached to Italy after the initial battles, but Moreau had other plans.<ref name=Arnold199>Arnold, 199\u2013201</ref> Through a series of complicated maneuvers in which he flanked, double flanked, and reflanked Kray's army, Moreau's army lay on the eastern slope of the [[Black Forest]], while portions of Kray's army was still guarded the passes on the other side.<ref>W.M. Sloane, ''Life of Napoleon''. France, 1896, p. 109.</ref> On 3 May 1800 Moreau and Kray fought [[Battle of Stockach (1800)|battles at Engen and Stockach]]. The fighting near [[Engen, Germany|Engen]] resulted in a stalemate with heavy losses on both sides. However, while the two main armies were engaged at Engen, [[Claude Lecourbe]] captured [[Stockach]] from its Austrian defenders under Joseph, Prince of Lorraine-Vaudemont. The loss of this main supply base at Stockach compelled Kray to order a retreat to [[Messkirch]], where they enjoyed a more favourable defensive position. However, it also meant that any retreat by Kray into Austria via Switzerland and the [[Vorarlberg]] was cut off.<ref>Sloane, 109.</ref>\n\nOn 4 and 5 May, the French launched repeated and fruitless assaults on the Messkirch. At nearby [[Sauldorf|Krumbach]], where the Austrians also had the superiority of position and force, the 1st Demi-Brigade took the village and the heights around it, which gave them a commanding aspect over Messkirch.  Subsequently, Kray withdrew his forces to [[Sigmaringen]], followed closely by the French. Fighting at nearby [[Battle of Biberach (1800)|Biberach an der Ris]] ensued on 9 May; action principally consisted of the 25,000-man-strong French \"Center\", commanded by [[Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr]].<ref>Sloane, pp. 109\u201310.</ref> After being flanked by General Moreau, who approached Ulm from the east and overwhelmed his outposts at [[Battle of H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt (1800)|Battle of H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt]], Kray retreated to Munich. Again, on 10 May, the Austrians withdrew with heavy losses, this time to Ulm.<ref>Digby Smith, ''Napoleonic Wars Databook''. London: Greenhill Press, 1998, p. 178.</ref>\n\nA several month armistice followed, during which Kray was replaced by the [[Archduke John of Austria|Archduke John]], with the Austrian army retiring behind the river Inn. Austrian reluctance to accept negotiated terms caused the French to end the armistice in mid-November, effective in two weeks. When the armistice ended, John advanced over the Inn towards [[Munich]]. His army was defeated in small engagements at the battles of [[Battle of Ampfing (1800)|Ampfing]] and [[Neuburg an der Donau]], and decisively in the forests before the city at [[Battle of Hohenlinden|Hohenlinden]] on 3 December. Moreau began a march on [[Vienna]], and the Austrians soon sued for peace, ending the war on the continent.\n\n===1801===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1801 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n[[File:Bataille algesiras.jpg|thumb|[[First Battle of Algeciras]]]]\nBy 9 February, the Austrians had signed the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]], ending the war on the continent. The war against the United Kingdom continued (with Neapolitan harbours closed to her by the [[Treaty of Florence]], signed on 28 March), and the Turks invaded Egypt in March, losing to [[Jean-Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber|Kl\u00e9ber]] at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]. The exhausted French force in Egypt, however, surrendered in August.\n\nThe naval war also continued, with the United Kingdom maintaining a blockade of France by sea. Non-combatants Russia, [[Prussia]], Denmark, and Sweden joined to protect neutral shipping from British attacks, but were unsuccessful. British Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] defied orders and attacked the Danish fleet in harbor at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|Battle of Copenhagen]], destroying much of the fleet of one of France's more steady allies during the period. An armistice prevented him from continuing into the [[Baltic Sea]] to attack the Russian fleet at Reval ([[Tallinn]]). Meanwhile, off Gibraltar, the outnumbered French squadron under [[Linois]] rebuffed a first British attack under [[James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez|Saumarez]] in the [[First Battle of Algeciras]], capturing a line-of-battle ship. In the [[Second Battle of Algeciras]], four days later, the British captured a French ship and sank two others, killing around 2000 French for the loss of 12 British.\n\n===1802===\nIn 1802, the British and French signed the [[Treaty of Amiens]], ending the war. The peace held for less than a year but still constituted the longest period of peace between the two countries during the period 1793\u20131815. The treaty is generally considered to be the most appropriate point to mark the transition between the French Revolutionary Wars and the [[Napoleonic Wars]], although Napoleon was not [[Coronation of Napoleon I|crowned emperor]] until 1804.\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Bataille Jemmapes.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|right|alt=Colored painting showing French army at Varoux |The armies of the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] at [[Battle of Jemappes|Jemappes]] in 1792. With chaos internally and enemies on the borders, the French were in a period of uncertainty during the early years of the Revolutionary Wars. By 1797, however, France dominated much of Western Europe, conquering the Rhineland, the Netherlands, and the Italian peninsula while erecting a series of sister republics and puppet states stretching from Spain to the German heartland.]]\nThe [[French Revolution]] transformed nearly all aspects of French and European life. The powerful sociopolitical forces unleashed by a people seeking [[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9|libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, and fraternit\u00e9]] made certain that even warfare was not spared this upheaval. 18th-century armies&nbsp;\u2013 with their rigid protocols, static operational strategy, unenthusiastic soldiers, and aristocratic officer classes&nbsp;\u2013 underwent massive remodeling as the French monarchy and nobility gave way to [[Liberalism|liberal assemblies]] obsessed with external threats. The fundamental shifts in warfare that occurred during the period have prompted scholars to identify the era as the beginning of \"modern war\".<ref>Lester Kurtz and Jennifer Turpin, ''Encyclopedia of violence, peace and conflict, Volume 2.'' p. 425</ref>\n\nIn 1791 the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] passed the \"Drill-Book\" legislation, implementing a series of infantry doctrines created by French theorists because of their defeat by the Prussians in the [[Seven Years' War]].<ref>David G. Chandler, The Campaigns of Napoleon. p. 136</ref> The new developments hoped to exploit the intrinsic bravery of the French soldier, made even more powerful by the explosive nationalist forces of the Revolution. The changes also placed a faith on the ordinary soldier that would be completely unacceptable in earlier times; French troops were expected to harass the enemy and remain loyal enough to not desert, a benefit other Ancien R\u00e9gime armies did not have.\n\nFollowing the declaration of war in 1792, an imposing array of enemies converging on French borders prompted the government in Paris to adopt radical measures. 23 August 1793, would become a historic day in military history; on that date the [[National Convention]] called a [[lev\u00e9e en masse]], or mass conscription, for the first time in human history. By summer of the following year, conscription made some 500,000 men available for service and the French began to deal blows to their European enemies.<ref>T. C. W. Blanning, The French Revolutionary Wars. p. 109</ref>\n\nArmies during the Revolution became noticeably larger than their Holy Roman counterparts, and combined with the new enthusiasm of the troops, the tactical and strategic opportunities became profound. By 1797 the French had defeated the [[First Coalition]], occupied the Low Countries, the west bank of the Rhine, and Northern Italy, objectives which had defied the [[House of Valois|Valois]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] dynasties for centuries. Unsatisfied with the results, many European powers formed a [[Second Coalition]], but by 1801 this too had been decisively beaten. Another key aspect of French success was the changes wrought in the officer classes. Traditionally, European armies left major command positions to those who could be trusted, namely, the aristocracy. The hectic nature of the French Revolution, however, tore apart France's old army, meaning new men were required to become officers and commanders.\n\nIn addition to opening a flood of tactical and strategic opportunities, the Revolutionary Wars also laid the foundation for modern military theory. Later authors that wrote about \"nations in arms\" drew inspiration from the French Revolution, in which dire circumstances seemingly mobilized the entire French nation for war and incorporated nationalism into the fabric of military history.<ref>Parker, Geoffrey. The Cambridge history of warfare. p. 189</ref> Although the reality of war in the France of 1795 would be different from that in the France of 1915, conceptions and mentalities of war evolved significantly. [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]] correctly analyzed the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras to give posterity a thorough and complete theory of war that emphasized struggles between nations occurring everywhere, from the battlefield to the legislative assemblies, and to the very way that people think.<ref>Peter Paret, Clausewitz and the State. p. 332</ref> War now emerged as a vast panorama of physical and psychological forces heading for victory or defeat.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Military career of Napoleon Bonaparte]]\n* [[Napoleonic Wars]]\n* [[Military history of France]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=note|colwidth=50em}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=25em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Clodfelter |first=M. |title=Warfare and Armed Conflicts: A Statistical Encyclopedia of Casualty and Other Figures, 1492\u20132015 |publisher=McFarland |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |year=2017 |edition=4th |isbn=978-0786474707 |ref=harv }}\n* {{Cite EB1911 |last=Atkinson |first=Charles Francis |last2=Hannay |first2=David McDowall|authorlink=David Hannay (historian) |wstitle=French Revolutionary Wars |volume=11 |pages=171\u2013205}}\n* Bertaud, Jean-Paul.

Although nominally independent, the Mongolian People's Republic was a [[satellite state]] of the [[Soviet Union]] until a [[Mongolian Revolution of 1990|third Mongolian revolution]] in [[Revolutions of 1989|January 1990]]. The revolution also ended Chinese occupation of Mongolia, which had existed since 1919. The official Mongolian name of the revolution is \"People's Revolution of 1921\" or simply \"People's Revolution\" ({{lang-mn|\u0410\u0440\u0434\u044b\u043d \u0445\u0443\u0432\u044c\u0441\u0433\u0430\u043b}}).\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Mongolian Revolution of 1911===\n{{Main|Mongolian Revolution of 1911}}\nFor about three centuries, the [[Qing dynasty]] had enforced\u2014albeit with mixed success\u2014a policy of segregating the non-Han peoples  on the frontier from [[Han Chinese]]. By the end of the 19th century, however, China faced the prospect of being parcelled out among the [[Western powers]] and Japan, each competing for its own [[sphere of influence]] in the country. On the northern frontier, [[Russian Empire]] was viewed by the Qing court as posing the greatest threat to its territorial integrity. In response, the Qing government adopted a different policy, the \"New Administration\" or \"[[New Policies]]\" (''Xin zheng''), which called for the [[Sinicization|sinification]] of Mongolia through Chinese colonisation, the exploitation of Mongolia's natural resources (mining, timber, fishing), military training, and education.<ref>Thomas E. Ewing, ''Ch'ing Policies in Outer Mongolia 1900\u20131911'', Modern Asian Studies (Cambridge, Eng., 1980), pp. 145-57.</ref>\n\nMany Mongols regarded the \"New Policies\" as a major threat to their traditional way of life, as was agreed to be preserved when they recognised authority of the Qing emperors, and began to seek independence. In July 1911 a group of [[Khalkha]] nobles persuaded the [[Jebtsundamba Khutuktu]], the head of Mongolian Buddhism ([[Buddhism in Mongolia|Lamaism]]), that Mongolia must declare its independence from the Qing dynasty. They agreed to send a small delegation to Russia to obtain its assistance in this undertaking.\n\nIn October 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution|revolution broke out in China]], with one province after another declaring its independence from the Qing government. On 1 December 1911 Outer Mongolia [[Mongolian Revolution of 1911|declared independence]], and established a [[theocracy]] under the Khutuktu. On 29 December he was installed as the ''[[Bogd Khan]]'' (Great Khan, or Emperor) of Mongolia.<ref>See Thomas E. Ewing, \"Revolution on the Chinese Frontier: Outer Mongolia in 1911\", ''Journal of Asian History'' (Bloomington, Indiana, 1978), pp. 101\u201319.</ref> This ushered in the [[Bogd Khanate of Mongolia|Bogd Khan era]], which lasted from 1911 to 1919.\n\n===Bogd Khan===\n{{Main|Bogd Khanate of Mongolia}}\n[[File:Sharav bogd khan.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The [[Bogd Khan]]]] The new Mongolian government was a fusion of Buddhist theocracy, Qing imperial usages, and 20th century Western political practices. The Bogd Khan assumed the same powers\u2014symbolic and real\u2014of Qing emperors in the past. He adopted a reign title, \"Elevated by the Many\"; the Mongolian nobility now owed their [[tribute]] to him instead of to the Qing emperor; and the Bogd Khan assumed the right of conferring upon the lay nobles their ranks and seals of office. This new state also reflected the Mongols' desire to reshape their country into a modern state\u2014they formed a national parliament composed of two chambers, a government with five ministries, and a national army.\n\nThe Buddhist religious establishment discovered new opportunities for political gain and financial profit. Despite the presence of a state government, real power lay in the Bogd Khan's court. The religious establishment appropriated revenues for its own purposes. For example, it enlarged its financial holdings by transferring to the religious estate (''Ikh shav''') wealthy herdsmen who traditionally had owed their services and taxes to lay princes. There is a commonly held misconception that, over time, the greed of the Buddhist religious establishment so disaffected the lay nobility that it came to reject the very principles of theocracy upon which the new country had been founded.<ref>Thomas E. Ewing, ''Between the Hammer and the Anvil. Chinese and Russian Policies in Outer Mongolia, 1911\u20131921'', (Bloomington, Indiana, 1980), pp. 34\u201343.</ref> According to Mongolian and Russian sources, the Mongolian society was generally satisfied with the theocracy but there were different views on future development of the country.<ref>Kuzmin, S.L. 2011. ''The History of Baron Ungern. An Experience of Reconstruction''. Moscow: KMK Sci. Press, {{ISBN|978-5-87317-692-2}}</ref>\n\nOn the diplomatic front, the Mongols worked tirelessly between 1912 and 1915 to win international recognition of a new [[Pan-Mongolism|pan-Mongolian state]] that would include [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Western Mongolia]], [[Upper Mongolia]], [[Barga Mongols|Barga]], and [[Tannu Uriankhai]]. The Republic of China, for its part, did all it could to re-establish Chinese sovereignty over the country. Russia refused to support full independence for Mongolia; nor would it agree to the restoration of Chinese sovereignty. The matter was settled in 1915 by the tripartite [[Treaty of Kyakhta (1915)]], which provided for Mongolian autonomy within the Chinese state and forbade China from sending troops to Mongolia. Both the Chinese and Mongols found the treaty equally dissatisfying, although for different reasons.\n\n==Abolition of autonomy==\n{{Main|Occupation of Mongolia}}\nThe outbreak of the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917 and the [[Russian Civil War]] a year later changed the Mongolian-Chinese dynamic. In response to rumors of an imminent Bolshevik invasion, the Mongolians, very reluctantly and only after much encouragement by the Chinese High Commissioner Chen Yi at Urga (modern [[Ulaanbaatar]]), requested in the summer of 1918 military assistance from China (approximately 200 to 250 troops arrived in September). The invasion in fact did not occur, and so the Bogd Khan's government requested that the troops be recalled. The Beijing government refused, seeing this violation of the Kyakhta Treaty as the first step in restoring Chinese sovereignty over Mongolia.<ref>Ewing, ''Between the Hammer and the Anvil'', p. 113.</ref>\n\nEarly in 1919, [[Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov|Grigori Semyonov]], a White Guard general, had assembled a group of [[Buryats]] and Inner Mongols in Siberia for the formation of a pan-Mongolian state. The [[Khalkha]]s were invited to join, but they refused. Semyonov threatened an invasion to force them to participate. This threat galvanized the lay princes, who now saw a larger opportunity: the end of theocratic rule. In August, the Mongolian Foreign Minister approached Chen Yi with a message from the \"representatives of the four [[aimag]]s\" (''i.e.'', the Khalkhas) with a request for military assistance against Semyonov. More importantly, perhaps, it contained a declaration that the Khalkhas were unanimous in their desire to abolish autonomy and restore the previous Qing system.[[File:Xu Shuzheng.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Xu Shuzheng]]]]Negotiations, with participation of the Bogd Khan's representatives, began immediately. By October, Chen Yi and the Mongolian princes had agreed upon a set of conditions, the \"Sixty-four Points\", effectively recreating the political and administrative system. The \"Points\" were submitted to the Parliament. The upper house consented to it; the lower house did not.<ref>Ts. Puntsagnorov, ''Mongolyn avtonomit \u00fcyeiin t\u00fc\u00fckh'' [The history of Mongolian in the autonomous period], (Ulaanbaatar, 1955), p. 195.</ref> However, in this as in all other matters submitted to the Parliament in the past, the upper house prevailed. Chen Yi sent the draft Articles to Beijing. The Bogd Khan dispatched a delegation of [[lama]]s to Beijing with a letter stating that the people of Mongolia did not want to abolish autonomy. He wrote that this was all a contrivance of Chen Yi, and he asked that Chen be recalled.<ref>Zhung-O guanxi shiliao: Wai Menggu [Sources on Chinese-Russian relations: Outer Mongolia], (Taipei, 1959), no. 386, pp. 573-74.</ref> However, the Chinese government was not interested in esoteric arguments whether or not a consensus existed in Mongolia for the abolition of autonomy. The \"Points\" were submitted to the Chinese National Assembly, which approved them on October 28.<ref>Zhung-O, app. 1, pp. 28-29.</ref>\nPolitical events then unfolding in China were to fundamentally alter Mongolian history. The Beijing government was controlled by a group of warlords nicknamed the \"[[Anhui clique]]\" headed by [[Duan Qirui]]. The government had come under severe public criticism for its failure at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] to obtain a just settlement of the [[Shandong Problem]]. There was criticism also of Duan's \"War-participation army\", which ostensibly had been formed for service in Europe in the First World War but in fact was used to maintain Duan's internal control. To divert criticism, he simply rechristened his office the \"Bureau of Frontier Defense\" and his army the \"Frontier Defense Army\". In June 1919, [[Xu Shuzheng]], a prominent member of Duan's clique, was named \"Northwest Frontier Commissioner\", making him the senior Chinese military and civilian officer of Outer Mongolia.<ref>Li Yushu, ''Waimeng zhengjiao chidu kao'' [Study of the Outer Mongolian political system], (Taipei, 1962), p. 237.</ref>\n\nEarlier, in April, Xu had submitted a plan to the Beijing government for the total social and [[economic reconstruction]] of Mongolia, proposing, among other things, that Chinese colonisation and intermarriage between Chinese and Mongolians be encouraged in order to \"transform the customs of the Mongols\".<ref>Zhung-O, no. 108, pp. 380-84.</ref> In short, Xu appeared to want nothing less than the total sinification of Mongolia under his authority.\n[[File:\u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044b\u043d \u04e9\u04e9\u0440\u0442\u04e9\u04e9 \u044d\u0437\u044d\u0440\u0445\u044d\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0433\u0438\u0439\u043d \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0433\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043d \u0442\u0443\u0445\u0430\u0439 \u0451\u0441\u043b\u043e\u043b.png|thumb|283x283px|Ceremony marking the abolition of Mongolian autonomy 1920]]\nChen Yi's Sixty-four Points, which guaranteed Mongolia a kind of autonomy, would have compelled Xu to abandon his plans. This may explain the timing of his personal intervention. Xu arrived in Urga in October accompanied by a military contingent. He informed Chen that the Sixty-four Points would have to be renegotiated based upon a new set of proposals, his \"Eight Articles\", which called for an increase in population (presumably through Chinese colonisation) and economic development. Xu presented the Articles to the Bogd Khan with a threat that refusal to ratify them would result in his deportation<!-- and that his closest advisors to China (meaning is unclear)-->. The Bogd Khan submitted the Articles to the Mongolian Parliament. As before, the upper house accepted them, while the lower house did not; some members of the lower house even threatened to expel Xu by force. Lamas resisted Xu's plans most of all. But again, the upper house prevailed.<ref>L Dendev, ''Mongolyn tovch t\u00fc\u00fckh'' [A short history of Mongolia], (Ulaanbaatar, 1934), pp. 175-76.</ref> On 17 November 1919, Xu accepted a petition\u2014signed by the ministers and deputy ministers but not by the Bogd Khan himself\u2014for the abolition of autonomy.<ref>Zhung-O, no. 414, p. 589.</ref>\n\nXu returned to Beijing, where he received a hero's welcome arranged by the Anhui clique. By December, he was back in Urga to organise a formal ceremony for the transfer of authority: soldiers were lined up on either side of the road to the Bogd Khan's palace; the portrait of the President of China was borne on a palanquin; the flag of the Chinese republic followed, and after it a marching band. Mongols were required to prostrate themselves repeatedly before these symbols of Chinese sovereignty.<ref>Chen Chungzu, ''Wai menggu jinshi shi'' [A modern history of Mongolia], (Shanghai, 1926), bien 3, p. 11.</ref> That night, some Mongolian herdsmen and lamas gathered outside the palace and tore down the flags of the Chinese Republic hanging from the gate.<ref>A. Kallinikov, ''U istokov mongol'skoi revolyutsii'' [Sources of the Mongolian revolution], Khozyaistvo Mongolii, pt. 1, p. 74.</ref>\n\n==Resistance==\n[[File:Consulate of the Russian Empire in Urgoo.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The Russian Consulate in Niislel H\u00fcree where Bodoo taught and headed the Consular Hill group]]\nBetween 1919 and early 1920 a few Mongolians came to form what were known later as the \"Consular Hill\" (''Konsulyn denj'') and East Urga (''Z\u00fc\u00fcn kh\u00fcree'') groups.<ref>Thomas E. Ewing chronicled the history of these two groups in \"The Origin of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party: 1920\", ''Mongolian Studies'' (Bloomington, Ind., 1978-79), pp. 79-105.</ref> This was the beginning of resistance to Xu and the abolition of autonomy.\n\nThe first group owed its existence principally to [[Dogsomyn Bodoo]] (1885\u20131922), a highly educated, 35-year-old lama who worked in the Russian Consulate at Urga during the Bogd Khan era. Sharing a [[yurt]] with Bodoo was [[Khorloogiin Choibalsan]] (1895\u20131953), later to be known as the \"[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] of Mongolia\". A certain Mikhail Kucherenko, a typesetter in the Russo-Mongolian printing office and a member of the Bolshevik underground in Urga, occasionally visited Bodoo and Choibalsan; conversations, no doubt, turned on the Russian revolution and the political situation in Mongolia. In time, other Mongolians joined Bodoo and Choibalsan in discussions over the abolition of autonomy and the failure of Mongolian princes and senior lamas to put up an effective resistance to the Chinese.<ref>Kh. Choibalsan, D. Losol, D. Demid, ''Mongolyn ardyn \u00fcndesnii khuv'sgal ankh \u00fc\u00fcseg baiguulagdsan tovch t\u00fc\u00fckh'' [A short history of the Mongolian revolution] (Ulaanbaatar, 1934), v. 1, p. 56.</ref>\n\nThe leaders of the East Urga group were [[Soliin Danzan]] (1885\u20131924), an official in the Ministry of Finance, and [[Dansranbilegiin Dogsom]] (1884\u20131939), an official in the Ministry of the Army. Another, albeit less prominent at the time, member was [[Damdin S\u00fckhbaatar]] (1893\u20131923), a soldier in the Mongolian army who, after his death, was canonised by Communist historians as the \"[[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] of Mongolia\". The beginning of the East Urga group may be traced to mid-November 1919, when several of the more militant members of the lower house of the Mongolian Parliament, including Danzan and Dogson, met secretly on the first night following its dissolution by Xu Shuzheng, and resolved to resist the Chinese. Twice they approached the Bogd Khan to obtain his support for armed resistance; twice the Khan counselled patience. The group plotted to seize the Mongolian army's arsenal and assassinate Xu Shuzheng; however, the placement of Chinese guards at the arsenal and a revised travel itinerary for Xu thwarted both plans.<ref>L. Bat-Ochir, D. Dashjamts, ''Damdiny Sukhe-Bator. Biografiya'' [Biography of Damdiny S\u00fckhbaatar], (Moscow, 1971), p. 36.</ref>\n\n==Formation of the Mongolian People's Party ==\n{{Main|Mongolian People's Party}}\nRussian expatriates in Urga had elected a revolutionary \"Municipal Duma\", headed by Bolshevik sympathisers, which had learned of the Consular Hill group. In early March 1920, the Duma was sending one of its members, I. Sorokovikov, to Irkutsk. It decided that he should also take a report with him about these Mongolians. Sorokovikov met with representatives of the two groups. On his return to Urga in June, he met with them again, promising that the Soviet government would provide \"assistance of all kinds\" to the Mongolian \"workers\". He invited them to send representatives to Russia for further discussions.<ref>G. Kungurov and I. Sorokovikov, ''Aratskaya revolyutsiya'' [Herdsmen\u2019s revolution], (Irkutsk, 1957), p. 84.</ref>\n\nA new sense of purposefulness now animated both groups. They had maintained a wary distance from one another, perhaps because of their different agendas\u2014the Consular Hill group espousing a rather progressive social program while the East Urga group was more nationalistic in its goals\u2014and there had been little cooperation between the two. The Soviet invitation changed that. The two groups met on 25 June, and formed the \"Mongolian People's Party\" (renamed later the [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]]), adopted a \"Party Oath\", and agreed to send Danzan and Choibalsan as delegates to Russia.<ref>Choibalsan, Losol, Demid, v. 1, pp. 100-02.</ref>\n\nDanzan and Choibalsan arrived in Verkhneudinsk, the capital of the pro-Soviet [[Far Eastern Republic]], in the first part of July. They met with [[Boris Shumyatsky]], then acting head of the government. Shumyatsky knew little about them, and for three weeks dodged their demands for a speedy Soviet decision whether or not to provide military assistance to the Mongolians against the Chinese. Finally, perhaps at Shumyatsky's suggestion, they sent a telegram to members of the MPP in Urga with a coded message that they should obtain a letter, stamped with the seal of the Bogd Khan, formally requesting Soviet assistance. The MPP did succeed in obtaining a letter from the Khan's court, albeit with difficulty. Five members of the Party\u2014D. Losol, [[Dambyn Chagdarjav]], Dogsom, L. Dendev, and S\u00fckhbaatar\u2014brought it to Verkhneudinsk. When the seven men met with Shumyatsky, he told them that he had no authority to make a decision on their request; they must go to Irkutsk.<ref>Choibalsan, Losol, Demid, v. 1, pp. 172\u201373.</ref>\n\nOn arriving in Irkutsk in August, the Mongolians met with the head of what was later to be reorganised as the Far Eastern Secretariat of the Communist International ([[Comintern]]), and explained that they needed military instructors, 10,000 rifles, cannon, machine guns, and money. They were told that they must draft a new letter, this time in the name of the Party, not the Bogd Khan, stating their objectives and requests. Such a petition would have to be considered by the Siberian Revolutionary Committee in Omsk.<ref>Choibalsan, Losol, Demid, v. 1, pp. 174\u201395.</ref>\n\nThe Mongolians divided themselves into three groups: Danzan, Losol, and Dendev left for Omsk; Bodoo and Dogsom returned to Urga, where they were to enlarge the party's membership and form an army; S\u00fckhbaatar and Choibalsan proceeded to Irkutsk to serve as a communication link between the others. Before separating, the group drafted a new appeal with a more revolutionary message: The Mongolian nobility would be divested of its hereditary power, to be replaced by a democratic government headed by the Bogd Khaan as a limited monarch. The document also contained a request for immediate military assistance.<ref>Choibalsan, Losol, Demid, v. 1, pp. 187\u201393.</ref>\n<gallery caption=\"Mongolian Revolutionaries\" widths=\"150px\" heights=\"120px\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Dogsomyn Bodoo.jpg|[[Dogsomyn Bodoo]]\nFile:Kh.

Danzan and his compatriots left for Moscow, arriving in about mid-September. For over a month they met frequently but inconclusively with Soviet and Comintern officials.\n\nA White Guard invasion of Mongolia under Baron [[Roman von Ungern-Sternberg]], however, forced the Soviet government into action. In late October to early November 1920, around 1,000 troops under his command had laid siege to the Chinese garrison in Urga numbered about 7,000. On 10 or 11 November, the three Mongols were hurriedly summoned to a meeting with Soviet authorities. They were told that the Party would be supplied with all the weapons it needed, but they must quickly return to Mongolia, and there increase the Party's membership and raise an army.<ref>Choibalsan, Losol, Demid, v. 1, pp. 242-48.</ref> At the same time, Moscow ordered the Soviet Fifth Red Army to cross the Mongolian border and destroy von Ungern-Sternberg's army.<ref>''Sovetsko-mongolskiye otnosheniya, 1921\u20131974''. [Soviet-Mongolian relations, 1921\u20131974.], (Moscow, 1975), v. 1, p. 464.</ref>\n\nThe Chinese garrison in Urga, however, successfully repulsed von Ungern-Sternberg's attack. This altered the Soviet strategy. The army of the Far Eastern Republic was already exhausted. Only the Fifth Army of the Reds was left on the eastern front, and already by late 1920 many of its more experienced units had either been demobilized, or sent west to fight in Poland, or assigned to the labor front, where they were needed to repair the badly damaged Siberian economy.<ref>See Jan M. Meijer, ed.'' The Trotsky Papers 1917\u20131922'' (The Hague, 1971), v. 2, no. 669, pp. 401\u2013403.</ref> Thus, when the Chinese repulsed von Ungern-Sternberg, the Soviets on 28 November withdrew their order for an invasion.<ref>''Dokumenty vneshnei politiki SSSR'' [Documents of the foreign policy of the USSR], (Moscow, 1957), v. 3, no. 192, pp. 55\u201356.</ref>\n\nHowever, von Ungern-Sternberg launched a second attack in early February 1921. This time he was successful. Chinese soldiers and civilians fled the city in panic. With the fall of Urga, the Chinese administrations and military garrisons at [[Uliastai]] and [[Khovd (city)|Khovd]] departed quickly for Xinjiang. The Bogd Khan was restored as Mongolian monarch by von Ungern-Sternberg. The Bogd Khan and his government were also restored, and a solemn ceremony held on 22 February.\n\n==Growth of the Mongolian People's Party==\n{{Main|Mongolian People's Army}}\n[[File:\u0421\u0443\u0445\u044d-\u0411\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441 \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u044b\u043c.png|thumb|150px|left|S\u00fckhbaatar meets with Lenin, a poster of Bolsheviks]]\n[[File:Sukhe-bator.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Damdin S\u00fckhbaatar in [[Troitskosavsk]]]]\nNews of von Ungern-Sternberg's seizure of Urga again influenced Soviet plans. A plenary session of the Comintern in Irkutsk on February 10 passed a formal resolution to aid the \"struggle of the Mongolian people for liberation and independence with money, guns and military instructors\".<ref>''Istoricheskskii opyt bratskogo sodruzhestva KPSS i MNRP v bor'be za sotsializm'' [The historical experience of the solidarity of the CPSS and the MPRP in the struggle for socialism], (Moscow, 1971), p. 217.</ref> With Soviet support, the MPP was now a serious contender for power. The Party, hitherto rather amorphous and loosely connected, required better organisational and ideological definition. A party conference (subsequently regarded as the first congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party) met secretly on 1\u20133 March at Kyakhta. The first session was attended by 17 persons, the second by 26. The Party approved the creation of an army command staff headed by S\u00fckhbaatar with two Russian advisors, elected a central committee chaired by Danzan with one representative from the Comintern, and adopted a party manifesto composed by the progressive Buryat [[Jamsrangiin Tseveen]].<ref>Mongolyn ardyn khuv'sgalt namyn negd\u00fcgeer ikh khural [First congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party], (Ulan Bator, 1971).</ref> On 13 March, a provisional government of seven men was formed, soon to be headed by Bodoo. On 18 March, the Mongolian guerrilla army, its ranks now enlarged to 400 through recruitment and conscription, seized the Chinese garrison at [[Altanbulag, Selenge |Kyakhta Maimaicheng]] (the Chinese portion of [[Kyakhta]]). A new confidence now animated the Party. It issued a proclamation announcing the formation of the government, the expulsion of the Chinese, and the promise to convene a congress of \"representatives of the masses\" to elect a permanent government.<ref>Ts. Nasanbaljir, ''Revolyutsionnye meropriyatiya narodogo pravitel'stva Mongolii v. 1921\u20131924 gg.'' [Revolutionary measures of the Mongolian people's government, 1921\u20131924], (Moscow, 1960), pp. 11-13.</ref> A propaganda war of sorts between the provisional government and the Bogd Khaan's court followed: the Party saturated the northern border with leaflets urging people to take up arms against the White Guards; the legal government of the Bogd Khaan government barraged the same area with warnings that these revolutionaries were intent upon destroying the Mongolian state and shattering the very foundations of the Buddhist faith.<ref>Thomas E. Ewing, ''Russia, China, and the Origins of the Mongolian People's Republic, 1911\u20131921: A Reappraisal'', (London, 1980), p. 419.</ref>\n\nThe new Soviet government was anxious to establish diplomatic relations with China. It had sent a representative to Beijing; the Chinese government reciprocated with its own to Moscow. Perhaps the principal reason that the Soviets had hesitated to aid the Mongolians too openly was fear of prejudicing those negotiations. But by early 1921 whatever restraints there were upon open Soviet support for Mongolia had ended: China suspended talks with the Soviet government in January 1921; the Chinese government appeared to be incapable of dealing with von Ungern-Sternberg; and in early March it had refused Soviet military assistance against the White Guards. It was then that the Russians became firmly committed to the Mongolian revolution.<ref>Ewing, ''Russia, China,'' p. 419.</ref>\n\nThe material expression of this commitment was an increase in the flow of Soviet advisers and weapons in March to the MPP. In March and April, Soviet and Far Eastern Republican units were transferred to Kyakhta, while the Mongols doubled the number of their guerrillas to 800. Von Ungern-Sternberg's forces attacked Kyakhta in early June. He encountered a body of Red Army troops army several times larger than his own, and the White Guards were thrown back with heavy losses. On 28 June, the main Soviet expeditionary corps [[Soviet intervention in Mongolia|crossed the border into Mongolia]], and on 6 July, the first Mongolian and Russian units entered Urga.\nFormerly it was solely stated generally with regard to von Baron Ungern Sternberg that Mongol/Mongolian Communist troops had defeated him and had him executed apparently duly for his widespread impalements and killings.\n\nThe Mongolian revolutionaries went to work immediately. On 9 July, they sent a letter to the Bogd Khaan's court, announcing that power was now in the hands of the people: \"The disorder which reigns presently is as much due to the shortcomings of the [hereditary] leaders as to the fact that the existing laws and situation do not correspond any longer to the spirit of the times. Everything, therefore, except religion, will be subject to gradual change.\"<ref>Nasanbaljir, pp. 22\u201323.</ref> The following day, the Party's Central Committee issued a resolution declaring the formation of a new government headed by Bodoo, with the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu as a limited monarch. On 11 July, he was ceremonially installed on the throne of Mongolia.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:\u30dc\u30b0\u30c9\u30cf\u30fc\u30f3\u5bae\u306e\u30b9\u30d5\u30d0\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\uff08\u6cb9\u7d75\u3092\u63cf\uff09.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Mongolia's regime transferred to the People's Party, led by S\u00fckhbaatar (painting)]]\nVon Ungern-Sternberg's army, now defeated, began to crumble. His men deserted him, and he was seized by a Red Army detachment. The Soviets executed him later that same year. Fighting then shifted to western Mongolia, and by the end of 1921, the White Guards had either been destroyed or expelled.\n\nThe Chinese government was not indifferent to von Ungern-Sternberg's invasion, appointing [[Zhang Zuolin]] as commander of an expeditionary army to deal with it. However, the occupation of Urga by Red forces in July and internal Chinese warlord politics forced him to abandon his plans.<ref>Gavan McCormack, ''Chang Tso-lin, the Mukden Military Clique, and Japan, 1920\u20131928'' (PhD dissertation, London University, 1974), p. 55.</ref>\n\nOn the diplomatic front, the Soviets had proposed to the Chinese the convening of a tripartite conference, similar to that of 1914-15, to discuss Mongolia's relationship with China. The Chinese government, however, emboldened by the prospect of Zhang's expedition, responded that Mongolia was part of China, and thus could not be the subject of international negotiations. It was not until 1924 that a Chinese-Soviet treaty was concluded, by which the Soviet Union recognised Mongolia as an integral part of China, and agreed to withdraw its troops. The treaty notwithstanding, the death of the Khutuktu in that same year provided an opportunity for the MPP to dispense with theocratic rule entirely, and the Party announced the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic. In 1945, the Chinese Nationalist government recognized the full sovereignty of the Mongolian People's Republic, though [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was to withdraw that recognition a few years later.<ref>Ewing, ''Between the Hammer and the Anvil'', pp. 256\u2013258.</ref> However, in 2002 the [[Republic of China]] did recognize Mongolia as independent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/archives/2002/10/11/0000175237 |title=Mongolian office to ride into Taipei by end of the year|work=Taipei Times |date=2002-10-11 |accessdate=2009-05-28|quote=In October 1945, the people of Outer Mongolia voted for independence, gaining the recognition of many countries, including the Republic of China.

Although nominally independent, the Mongolian People's Republic was a [[satellite state]] of the [[Soviet Union]] until a [[Mongolian Revolution of 1990|third Mongolian revolution]] in [[Revolutions of 1989|January 1990]]. The revolution also ended Chinese occupation of Mongolia, which had existed since 1919. The official Mongolian name of the revolution is \"People's Revolution of 1921\" or simply \"People's Revolution\" ({{lang-mn|\u0410\u0440\u0434\u044b\u043d \u0445\u0443\u0432\u044c\u0441\u0433\u0430\u043b}}).\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Mongolian Revolution of 1911===\n{{Main|Mongolian Revolution of 1911}}\nFor about three centuries, the [[Qing dynasty]] had enforced\u2014albeit with mixed success\u2014a policy of segregating the non-Han peoples  on the frontier from [[Han Chinese]]. By the end of the 19th century, however, China faced the prospect of being parcelled out among the [[Western powers]] and Japan, each competing for its own [[sphere of influence]] in the country. On the northern frontier, [[Russian Empire]] was viewed by the Qing court as posing the greatest threat to its territorial integrity. In response, the Qing government adopted a different policy, the \"New Administration\" or \"[[New Policies]]\" (''Xin zheng''), which called for the [[Sinicization|sinification]] of Mongolia through Chinese colonisation, the exploitation of Mongolia's natural resources (mining, timber, fishing), military training, and education.<ref>Thomas E. Ewing, ''Ch'ing Policies in Outer Mongolia 1900\u20131911'', Modern Asian Studies (Cambridge, Eng., 1980), pp. 145-57.</ref>\n\nMany Mongols regarded the \"New Policies\" as a major threat to their traditional way of life, as was agreed to be preserved when they recognised authority of the Qing emperors, and began to seek independence. In July 1911 a group of [[Khalkha]] nobles persuaded the [[Jebtsundamba Khutuktu]], the head of Mongolian Buddhism ([[Buddhism in Mongolia|Lamaism]]), that Mongolia must declare its independence from the Qing dynasty. They agreed to send a small delegation to Russia to obtain its assistance in this undertaking.\n\nIn October 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution|revolution broke out in China]], with one province after another declaring its independence from the Qing government. On 1 December 1911 Outer Mongolia [[Mongolian Revolution of 1911|declared independence]], and established a [[theocracy]] under the Khutuktu. On 29 December he was installed as the ''[[Bogd Khan]]'' (Great Khan, or Emperor) of Mongolia.<ref>See Thomas E. Ewing, \"Revolution on the Chinese Frontier: Outer Mongolia in 1911\", ''Journal of Asian History'' (Bloomington, Indiana, 1978), pp. 101\u201319.</ref> This ushered in the [[Bogd Khanate of Mongolia|Bogd Khan era]], which lasted from 1911 to 1919.\n\n===Bogd Khan===\n{{Main|Bogd Khanate of Mongolia}}\n[[File:Sharav bogd khan.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The [[Bogd Khan]]]] The new Mongolian government was a fusion of Buddhist theocracy, Qing imperial usages, and 20th century Western political practices. The Bogd Khan assumed the same powers\u2014symbolic and real\u2014of Qing emperors in the past. He adopted a reign title, \"Elevated by the Many\"; the Mongolian nobility now owed their [[tribute]] to him instead of to the Qing emperor; and the Bogd Khan assumed the right of conferring upon the lay nobles their ranks and seals of office. This new state also reflected the Mongols' desire to reshape their country into a modern state\u2014they formed a national parliament composed of two chambers, a government with five ministries, and a national army.\n\nThe Buddhist religious establishment discovered new opportunities for political gain and financial profit. Despite the presence of a state government, real power lay in the Bogd Khan's court. The religious establishment appropriated revenues for its own purposes. For example, it enlarged its financial holdings by transferring to the religious estate (''Ikh shav''') wealthy herdsmen who traditionally had owed their services and taxes to lay princes. There is a commonly held misconception that, over time, the greed of the Buddhist religious establishment so disaffected the lay nobility that it came to reject the very principles of theocracy upon which the new country had been founded.<ref>Thomas E. Ewing, ''Between the Hammer and the Anvil. Chinese and Russian Policies in Outer Mongolia, 1911\u20131921'', (Bloomington, Indiana, 1980), pp. 34\u201343.</ref> According to Mongolian and Russian sources, the Mongolian society was generally satisfied with the theocracy but there were different views on future development of the country.<ref>Kuzmin, S.L. 2011. ''The History of Baron Ungern. An Experience of Reconstruction''. Moscow: KMK Sci. Press, {{ISBN|978-5-87317-692-2}}</ref>\n\nOn the diplomatic front, the Mongols worked tirelessly between 1912 and 1915 to win international recognition of a new [[Pan-Mongolism|pan-Mongolian state]] that would include [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Western Mongolia]], [[Upper Mongolia]], [[Barga Mongols|Barga]], and [[Tannu Uriankhai]]. The Republic of China, for its part, did all it could to re-establish Chinese sovereignty over the country. Russia refused to support full independence for Mongolia; nor would it agree to the restoration of Chinese sovereignty. The matter was settled in 1915 by the tripartite [[Treaty of Kyakhta (1915)]], which provided for Mongolian autonomy within the Chinese state and forbade China from sending troops to Mongolia. Both the Chinese and Mongols found the treaty equally dissatisfying, although for different reasons.\n\n==Abolition of autonomy==\n{{Main|Occupation of Mongolia}}\nThe outbreak of the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917 and the [[Russian Civil War]] a year later changed the Mongolian-Chinese dynamic. In response to rumors of an imminent Bolshevik invasion, the Mongolians, very reluctantly and only after much encouragement by the Chinese High Commissioner Chen Yi at Urga (modern [[Ulaanbaatar]]), requested in the summer of 1918 military assistance from China (approximately 200 to 250 troops arrived in September). The invasion in fact did not occur, and so the Bogd Khan's government requested that the troops be recalled. The Beijing government refused, seeing this violation of the Kyakhta Treaty as the first step in restoring Chinese sovereignty over Mongolia.<ref>Ewing, ''Between the Hammer and the Anvil'', p. 113.</ref>\n\nEarly in 1919, [[Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov|Grigori Semyonov]], a White Guard general, had assembled a group of [[Buryats]] and Inner Mongols in Siberia for the formation of a pan-Mongolian state. The [[Khalkha]]s were invited to join, but they refused. Semyonov threatened an invasion to force them to participate. This threat galvanized the lay princes, who now saw a larger opportunity: the end of theocratic rule. In August, the Mongolian Foreign Minister approached Chen Yi with a message from the \"representatives of the four [[aimag]]s\" (''i.e.'', the Khalkhas) with a request for military assistance against Semyonov. More importantly, perhaps, it contained a declaration that the Khalkhas were unanimous in their desire to abolish autonomy and restore the previous Qing system.[[File:Xu Shuzheng.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Xu Shuzheng]]]]Negotiations, with participation of the Bogd Khan's representatives, began immediately. By October, Chen Yi and the Mongolian princes had agreed upon a set of conditions, the \"Sixty-four Points\", effectively recreating the political and administrative system. The \"Points\" were submitted to the Parliament. The upper house consented to it; the lower house did not.<ref>Ts. Puntsagnorov, ''Mongolyn avtonomit \u00fcyeiin t\u00fc\u00fckh'' [The history of Mongolian in the autonomous period], (Ulaanbaatar, 1955), p. 195.</ref> However, in this as in all other matters submitted to the Parliament in the past, the upper house prevailed. Chen Yi sent the draft Articles to Beijing. The Bogd Khan dispatched a delegation of [[lama]]s to Beijing with a letter stating that the people of Mongolia did not want to abolish autonomy. He wrote that this was all a contrivance of Chen Yi, and he asked that Chen be recalled.<ref>Zhung-O guanxi shiliao: Wai Menggu [Sources on Chinese-Russian relations: Outer Mongolia], (Taipei, 1959), no. 386, pp. 573-74.</ref> However, the Chinese government was not interested in esoteric arguments whether or not a consensus existed in Mongolia for the abolition of autonomy. The \"Points\" were submitted to the Chinese National Assembly, which approved them on October 28.<ref>Zhung-O, app. 1, pp. 28-29.</ref>\nPolitical events then unfolding in China were to fundamentally alter Mongolian history. The Beijing government was controlled by a group of warlords nicknamed the \"[[Anhui clique]]\" headed by [[Duan Qirui]]. The government had come under severe public criticism for its failure at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] to obtain a just settlement of the [[Shandong Problem]]. There was criticism also of Duan's \"War-participation army\", which ostensibly had been formed for service in Europe in the First World War but in fact was used to maintain Duan's internal control. To divert criticism, he simply rechristened his office the \"Bureau of Frontier Defense\" and his army the \"Frontier Defense Army\". In June 1919, [[Xu Shuzheng]], a prominent member of Duan's clique, was named \"Northwest Frontier Commissioner\", making him the senior Chinese military and civilian officer of Outer Mongolia.<ref>Li Yushu, ''Waimeng zhengjiao chidu kao'' [Study of the Outer Mongolian political system], (Taipei, 1962), p. 237.</ref>\n\nEarlier, in April, Xu had submitted a plan to the Beijing government for the total social and [[economic reconstruction]] of Mongolia, proposing, among other things, that Chinese colonisation and intermarriage between Chinese and Mongolians be encouraged in order to \"transform the customs of the Mongols\".<ref>Zhung-O, no. 108, pp. 380-84.</ref> In short, Xu appeared to want nothing less than the total sinification of Mongolia under his authority.\n[[File:\u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044b\u043d \u04e9\u04e9\u0440\u0442\u04e9\u04e9 \u044d\u0437\u044d\u0440\u0445\u044d\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0433\u0438\u0439\u043d \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0433\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043d \u0442\u0443\u0445\u0430\u0439 \u0451\u0441\u043b\u043e\u043b.png|thumb|283x283px|Ceremony marking the abolition of Mongolian autonomy 1920]]\nChen Yi's Sixty-four Points, which guaranteed Mongolia a kind of autonomy, would have compelled Xu to abandon his plans. This may explain the timing of his personal intervention. Xu arrived in Urga in October accompanied by a military contingent. He informed Chen that the Sixty-four Points would have to be renegotiated based upon a new set of proposals, his \"Eight Articles\", which called for an increase in population (presumably through Chinese colonisation) and economic development. Xu presented the Articles to the Bogd Khan with a threat that refusal to ratify them would result in his deportation<!-- and that his closest advisors to China (meaning is unclear)-->. The Bogd Khan submitted the Articles to the Mongolian Parliament. As before, the upper house accepted them, while the lower house did not; some members of the lower house even threatened to expel Xu by force. Lamas resisted Xu's plans most of all. But again, the upper house prevailed.<ref>L Dendev, ''Mongolyn tovch t\u00fc\u00fckh'' [A short history of Mongolia], (Ulaanbaatar, 1934), pp. 175-76.</ref> On 17 November 1919, Xu accepted a petition\u2014signed by the ministers and deputy ministers but not by the Bogd Khan himself\u2014for the abolition of autonomy.<ref>Zhung-O, no. 414, p. 589.</ref>\n\nXu returned to Beijing, where he received a hero's welcome arranged by the Anhui clique. By December, he was back in Urga to organise a formal ceremony for the transfer of authority: soldiers were lined up on either side of the road to the Bogd Khan's palace; the portrait of the President of China was borne on a palanquin; the flag of the Chinese republic followed, and after it a marching band. Mongols were required to prostrate themselves repeatedly before these symbols of Chinese sovereignty.<ref>Chen Chungzu, ''Wai menggu jinshi shi'' [A modern history of Mongolia], (Shanghai, 1926), bien 3, p. 11.</ref> That night, some Mongolian herdsmen and lamas gathered outside the palace and tore down the flags of the Chinese Republic hanging from the gate.<ref>A.

Ewing chronicled the history of these two groups in \"The Origin of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party: 1920\", ''Mongolian Studies'' (Bloomington, Ind., 1978-79), pp. 79-105.</ref> This was the beginning of resistance to Xu and the abolition of autonomy.\n\nThe first group owed its existence principally to [[Dogsomyn Bodoo]] (1885\u20131922), a highly educated, 35-year-old lama who worked in the Russian Consulate at Urga during the Bogd Khan era. Sharing a [[yurt]] with Bodoo was [[Khorloogiin Choibalsan]] (1895\u20131953), later to be known as the \"[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] of Mongolia\". A certain Mikhail Kucherenko, a typesetter in the Russo-Mongolian printing office and a member of the Bolshevik underground in Urga, occasionally visited Bodoo and Choibalsan; conversations, no doubt, turned on the Russian revolution and the political situation in Mongolia. In time, other Mongolians joined Bodoo and Choibalsan in discussions over the abolition of autonomy and the failure of Mongolian princes and senior lamas to put up an effective resistance to the Chinese.<ref>Kh. Choibalsan, D. Losol, D. Demid, ''Mongolyn ardyn \u00fcndesnii khuv'sgal ankh \u00fc\u00fcseg baiguulagdsan tovch t\u00fc\u00fckh'' [A short history of the Mongolian revolution] (Ulaanbaatar, 1934), v. 1, p. 56.</ref>\n\nThe leaders of the East Urga group were [[Soliin Danzan]] (1885\u20131924), an official in the Ministry of Finance, and [[Dansranbilegiin Dogsom]] (1884\u20131939), an official in the Ministry of the Army. Another, albeit less prominent at the time, member was [[Damdin S\u00fckhbaatar]] (1893\u20131923), a soldier in the Mongolian army who, after his death, was canonised by Communist historians as the \"[[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] of Mongolia\". The beginning of the East Urga group may be traced to mid-November 1919, when several of the more militant members of the lower house of the Mongolian Parliament, including Danzan and Dogson, met secretly on the first night following its dissolution by Xu Shuzheng, and resolved to resist the Chinese. Twice they approached the Bogd Khan to obtain his support for armed resistance; twice the Khan counselled patience. The group plotted to seize the Mongolian army's arsenal and assassinate Xu Shuzheng; however, the placement of Chinese guards at the arsenal and a revised travel itinerary for Xu thwarted both plans.<ref>L. Bat-Ochir, D. Dashjamts, ''Damdiny Sukhe-Bator. Biografiya'' [Biography of Damdiny S\u00fckhbaatar], (Moscow, 1971), p. 36.</ref>\n\n==Formation of the Mongolian People's Party ==\n{{Main|Mongolian People's Party}}\nRussian expatriates in Urga had elected a revolutionary \"Municipal Duma\", headed by Bolshevik sympathisers, which had learned of the Consular Hill group. In early March 1920, the Duma was sending one of its members, I. Sorokovikov, to Irkutsk. It decided that he should also take a report with him about these Mongolians. Sorokovikov met with representatives of the two groups. On his return to Urga in June, he met with them again, promising that the Soviet government would provide \"assistance of all kinds\" to the Mongolian \"workers\". He invited them to send representatives to Russia for further discussions.<ref>G. Kungurov and I. Sorokovikov, ''Aratskaya revolyutsiya'' [Herdsmen\u2019s revolution], (Irkutsk, 1957), p. 84.</ref>\n\nA new sense of purposefulness now animated both groups. They had maintained a wary distance from one another, perhaps because of their different agendas\u2014the Consular Hill group espousing a rather progressive social program while the East Urga group was more nationalistic in its goals\u2014and there had been little cooperation between the two. The Soviet invitation changed that. The two groups met on 25 June, and formed the \"Mongolian People's Party\" (renamed later the [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]]), adopted a \"Party Oath\", and agreed to send Danzan and Choibalsan as delegates to Russia.<ref>Choibalsan, Losol, Demid, v. 1, pp. 100-02.</ref>\n\nDanzan and Choibalsan arrived in Verkhneudinsk, the capital of the pro-Soviet [[Far Eastern Republic]], in the first part of July. They met with [[Boris Shumyatsky]], then acting head of the government. Shumyatsky knew little about them, and for three weeks dodged their demands for a speedy Soviet decision whether or not to provide military assistance to the Mongolians against the Chinese. Finally, perhaps at Shumyatsky's suggestion, they sent a telegram to members of the MPP in Urga with a coded message that they should obtain a letter, stamped with the seal of the Bogd Khan, formally requesting Soviet assistance. The MPP did succeed in obtaining a letter from the Khan's court, albeit with difficulty. Five members of the Party\u2014D. Losol, [[Dambyn Chagdarjav]], Dogsom, L. Dendev, and S\u00fckhbaatar\u2014brought it to Verkhneudinsk. When the seven men met with Shumyatsky, he told them that he had no authority to make a decision on their request; they must go to Irkutsk.<ref>Choibalsan, Losol, Demid, v. 1, pp. 172\u201373.</ref>\n\nOn arriving in Irkutsk in August, the Mongolians met with the head of what was later to be reorganised as the Far Eastern Secretariat of the Communist International ([[Comintern]]), and explained that they needed military instructors, 10,000 rifles, cannon, machine guns, and money. They were told that they must draft a new letter, this time in the name of the Party, not the Bogd Khan, stating their objectives and requests. Such a petition would have to be considered by the Siberian Revolutionary Committee in Omsk.<ref>Choibalsan, Losol, Demid, v. 1, pp. 174\u201395.</ref>\n\nThe Mongolians divided themselves into three groups: Danzan, Losol, and Dendev left for Omsk; Bodoo and Dogsom returned to Urga, where they were to enlarge the party's membership and form an army; S\u00fckhbaatar and Choibalsan proceeded to Irkutsk to serve as a communication link between the others. Before separating, the group drafted a new appeal with a more revolutionary message: The Mongolian nobility would be divested of its hereditary power, to be replaced by a democratic government headed by the Bogd Khaan as a limited monarch. The document also contained a request for immediate military assistance.<ref>Choibalsan, Losol, Demid, v. 1, pp. 187\u201393.</ref>\n<gallery caption=\"Mongolian Revolutionaries\" widths=\"150px\" heights=\"120px\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Dogsomyn Bodoo.jpg|[[Dogsomyn Bodoo]]\nFile:Kh.

Danzan and his compatriots left for Moscow, arriving in about mid-September. For over a month they met frequently but inconclusively with Soviet and Comintern officials.\n\nA White Guard invasion of Mongolia under Baron [[Roman von Ungern-Sternberg]], however, forced the Soviet government into action. In late October to early November 1920, around 1,000 troops under his command had laid siege to the Chinese garrison in Urga numbered about 7,000. On 10 or 11 November, the three Mongols were hurriedly summoned to a meeting with Soviet authorities. They were told that the Party would be supplied with all the weapons it needed, but they must quickly return to Mongolia, and there increase the Party's membership and raise an army.<ref>Choibalsan, Losol, Demid, v. 1, pp. 242-48.</ref> At the same time, Moscow ordered the Soviet Fifth Red Army to cross the Mongolian border and destroy von Ungern-Sternberg's army.<ref>''Sovetsko-mongolskiye otnosheniya, 1921\u20131974''. [Soviet-Mongolian relations, 1921\u20131974.], (Moscow, 1975), v. 1, p. 464.</ref>\n\nThe Chinese garrison in Urga, however, successfully repulsed von Ungern-Sternberg's attack. This altered the Soviet strategy. The army of the Far Eastern Republic was already exhausted. Only the Fifth Army of the Reds was left on the eastern front, and already by late 1920 many of its more experienced units had either been demobilized, or sent west to fight in Poland, or assigned to the labor front, where they were needed to repair the badly damaged Siberian economy.<ref>See Jan M. Meijer, ed.'' The Trotsky Papers 1917\u20131922'' (The Hague, 1971), v. 2, no. 669, pp. 401\u2013403.</ref> Thus, when the Chinese repulsed von Ungern-Sternberg, the Soviets on 28 November withdrew their order for an invasion.<ref>''Dokumenty vneshnei politiki SSSR'' [Documents of the foreign policy of the USSR], (Moscow, 1957), v. 3, no. 192, pp. 55\u201356.</ref>\n\nHowever, von Ungern-Sternberg launched a second attack in early February 1921. This time he was successful. Chinese soldiers and civilians fled the city in panic. With the fall of Urga, the Chinese administrations and military garrisons at [[Uliastai]] and [[Khovd (city)|Khovd]] departed quickly for Xinjiang. The Bogd Khan was restored as Mongolian monarch by von Ungern-Sternberg. The Bogd Khan and his government were also restored, and a solemn ceremony held on 22 February.\n\n==Growth of the Mongolian People's Party==\n{{Main|Mongolian People's Army}}\n[[File:\u0421\u0443\u0445\u044d-\u0411\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441 \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u044b\u043c.png|thumb|150px|left|S\u00fckhbaatar meets with Lenin, a poster of Bolsheviks]]\n[[File:Sukhe-bator.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Damdin S\u00fckhbaatar in [[Troitskosavsk]]]]\nNews of von Ungern-Sternberg's seizure of Urga again influenced Soviet plans. A plenary session of the Comintern in Irkutsk on February 10 passed a formal resolution to aid the \"struggle of the Mongolian people for liberation and independence with money, guns and military instructors\".<ref>''Istoricheskskii opyt bratskogo sodruzhestva KPSS i MNRP v bor'be za sotsializm'' [The historical experience of the solidarity of the CPSS and the MPRP in the struggle for socialism], (Moscow, 1971), p. 217.</ref> With Soviet support, the MPP was now a serious contender for power. The Party, hitherto rather amorphous and loosely connected, required better organisational and ideological definition. A party conference (subsequently regarded as the first congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party) met secretly on 1\u20133 March at Kyakhta. The first session was attended by 17 persons, the second by 26. The Party approved the creation of an army command staff headed by S\u00fckhbaatar with two Russian advisors, elected a central committee chaired by Danzan with one representative from the Comintern, and adopted a party manifesto composed by the progressive Buryat [[Jamsrangiin Tseveen]].<ref>Mongolyn ardyn khuv'sgalt namyn negd\u00fcgeer ikh khural [First congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party], (Ulan Bator, 1971).</ref> On 13 March, a provisional government of seven men was formed, soon to be headed by Bodoo. On 18 March, the Mongolian guerrilla army, its ranks now enlarged to 400 through recruitment and conscription, seized the Chinese garrison at [[Altanbulag, Selenge |Kyakhta Maimaicheng]] (the Chinese portion of [[Kyakhta]]). A new confidence now animated the Party. It issued a proclamation announcing the formation of the government, the expulsion of the Chinese, and the promise to convene a congress of \"representatives of the masses\" to elect a permanent government.<ref>Ts. Nasanbaljir, ''Revolyutsionnye meropriyatiya narodogo pravitel'stva Mongolii v. 1921\u20131924 gg.'' [Revolutionary measures of the Mongolian people's government, 1921\u20131924], (Moscow, 1960), pp. 11-13.</ref> A propaganda war of sorts between the provisional government and the Bogd Khaan's court followed: the Party saturated the northern border with leaflets urging people to take up arms against the White Guards; the legal government of the Bogd Khaan government barraged the same area with warnings that these revolutionaries were intent upon destroying the Mongolian state and shattering the very foundations of the Buddhist faith.<ref>Thomas E. Ewing, ''Russia, China, and the Origins of the Mongolian People's Republic, 1911\u20131921: A Reappraisal'', (London, 1980), p. 419.</ref>\n\nThe new Soviet government was anxious to establish diplomatic relations with China. It had sent a representative to Beijing; the Chinese government reciprocated with its own to Moscow. Perhaps the principal reason that the Soviets had hesitated to aid the Mongolians too openly was fear of prejudicing those negotiations. But by early 1921 whatever restraints there were upon open Soviet support for Mongolia had ended: China suspended talks with the Soviet government in January 1921; the Chinese government appeared to be incapable of dealing with von Ungern-Sternberg; and in early March it had refused Soviet military assistance against the White Guards. It was then that the Russians became firmly committed to the Mongolian revolution.<ref>Ewing, ''Russia, China,'' p. 419.</ref>\n\nThe material expression of this commitment was an increase in the flow of Soviet advisers and weapons in March to the MPP. In March and April, Soviet and Far Eastern Republican units were transferred to Kyakhta, while the Mongols doubled the number of their guerrillas to 800. Von Ungern-Sternberg's forces attacked Kyakhta in early June. He encountered a body of Red Army troops army several times larger than his own, and the White Guards were thrown back with heavy losses. On 28 June, the main Soviet expeditionary corps [[Soviet intervention in Mongolia|crossed the border into Mongolia]], and on 6 July, the first Mongolian and Russian units entered Urga.\nFormerly it was solely stated generally with regard to von Baron Ungern Sternberg that Mongol/Mongolian Communist troops had defeated him and had him executed apparently duly for his widespread impalements and killings.\n\nThe Mongolian revolutionaries went to work immediately. On 9 July, they sent a letter to the Bogd Khaan's court, announcing that power was now in the hands of the people: \"The disorder which reigns presently is as much due to the shortcomings of the [hereditary] leaders as to the fact that the existing laws and situation do not correspond any longer to the spirit of the times. Everything, therefore, except religion, will be subject to gradual change.\"<ref>Nasanbaljir, pp. 22\u201323.</ref> The following day, the Party's Central Committee issued a resolution declaring the formation of a new government headed by Bodoo, with the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu as a limited monarch. On 11 July, he was ceremonially installed on the throne of Mongolia.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:\u30dc\u30b0\u30c9\u30cf\u30fc\u30f3\u5bae\u306e\u30b9\u30d5\u30d0\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\uff08\u6cb9\u7d75\u3092\u63cf\uff09.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Mongolia's regime transferred to the People's Party, led by S\u00fckhbaatar (painting)]]\nVon Ungern-Sternberg's army, now defeated, began to crumble. His men deserted him, and he was seized by a Red Army detachment. The Soviets executed him later that same year. Fighting then shifted to western Mongolia, and by the end of 1921, the White Guards had either been destroyed or expelled.\n\nThe Chinese government was not indifferent to von Ungern-Sternberg's invasion, appointing [[Zhang Zuolin]] as commander of an expeditionary army to deal with it. However, the occupation of Urga by Red forces in July and internal Chinese warlord politics forced him to abandon his plans.<ref>Gavan McCormack, ''Chang Tso-lin, the Mukden Military Clique, and Japan, 1920\u20131928'' (PhD dissertation, London University, 1974), p. 55.</ref>\n\nOn the diplomatic front, the Soviets had proposed to the Chinese the convening of a tripartite conference, similar to that of 1914-15, to discuss Mongolia's relationship with China. The Chinese government, however, emboldened by the prospect of Zhang's expedition, responded that Mongolia was part of China, and thus could not be the subject of international negotiations. It was not until 1924 that a Chinese-Soviet treaty was concluded, by which the Soviet Union recognised Mongolia as an integral part of China, and agreed to withdraw its troops. The treaty notwithstanding, the death of the Khutuktu in that same year provided an opportunity for the MPP to dispense with theocratic rule entirely, and the Party announced the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic. In 1945, the Chinese Nationalist government recognised the full sovereignty of the Mongolian People's Republic, though [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was to withdraw that recognition a few years later.<ref>Ewing, ''Between the Hammer and the Anvil'', pp. 256\u2013258.</ref> However, in 2002 the [[Republic of China]] did recognize Mongolia as independent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/archives/2002/10/11/0000175237 |title=Mongolian office to ride into Taipei by end of the year|work=Taipei Times |date=2002-10-11 |accessdate=2009-05-28|quote=In October 1945, the people of Outer Mongolia voted for independence, gaining the recognition of many countries, including the Republic of China.
