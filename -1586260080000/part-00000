For example, Tor allows users to access websites using the [[.onion]] server address anonymously, hiding their IP address.\n# '''Unlinked content''': pages which are not linked to by other pages, which may prevent [[web crawling]] programs from accessing the content. This content is referred to as pages without [[backlink]]s (also known as inlinks). Also, search engines do not always detect all backlinks from searched web pages.\n# '''Web archives''': Web archival services such as the [[Wayback Machine]] enable users to see archived versions of web pages across time, including websites which have become inaccessible, and are not indexed by search engines such as Google.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wiener-Bronner|first1=Danielle|title=NASA is indexing the 'Deep Web' to show mankind what Google won't|url=https://www.technosakib.com/2020/04/How-to-add-responsive-html-sitemap-for-blogger.html /|publisher=Techno Sakib |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 6, 2020|quote=There are other simpler versions of Memex already available. \"If you've ever used the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine\", which gives you past versions of a website not accessible through Google, then you've technically searched the Deep Web, said [[Chris Mattmann]].}}</ref>\n\n==Content types==\nWhile it is not always possible to directly discover a specific web server's content so that it may be indexed, a site potentially can be accessed indirectly (due to [[Vulnerability (computing)|computer vulnerabilities]]).\n\nTo discover content on the web, search engines use [[web crawler]]s that follow hyperlinks through known protocol virtual [[port (computer networking)|port numbers]]. This technique is ideal for discovering content on the surface web but is often ineffective at finding deep web content. For example, these crawlers do not attempt to find dynamic pages that are the result of database queries due to the indeterminate number of queries that are possible.<ref name=\"wright2009\">{{cite news\n | last = Wright\n | first = Alex\n | title = Exploring a 'Deep Web' That Google Can't Grasp\n | work = The New York Times\n | date = 2009-02-22\n | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/technology/internet/23search.html?th&emc=th\n | accessdate = 2009-02-23}}</ref> It has been noted that this can be (partially) overcome by providing links to query results, but this could unintentionally inflate the popularity for a member of the deep web.\n\n[[DeepPeep]], [[Intute]], [[Deep Web Technologies]], [[Scirus]], and [[Ahmia.fi]] are a few search engines that have accessed the deep web.

The [[Sitemap Protocol]] (first developed, and introduced by Google in 2005) and [[Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting|OAI-PMH]] are mechanisms that allow search engines and other interested parties to discover deep web resources on particular web servers. Both mechanisms allow web servers to advertise the URLs that are accessible on them, thereby allowing automatic discovery of resources that are not directly linked to the surface web. Google's deep web surfacing system computes submissions for each HTML form and adds the resulting HTML pages into the Google search engine index. The surfaced results account for a thousand queries per second to deep web content.<ref>{{cite journal\n | first = Jayant\n | last = Madhavan\n | authorlink =\n | first2 = David | last2 = Ko | first3

For example, Tor allows users to access websites using the [[.onion]] server address anonymously, hiding their IP address.\n# '''Unlinked content''': pages which are not linked to by other pages, which may prevent [[web crawling]] programs from accessing the content. This content is referred to as pages without [[backlink]]s (also known as inlinks). Also, search engines do not always detect all backlinks from searched web pages.\n# '''Web archives''': Web archival services such as the [[Wayback Machine]] enable users to see archived versions of web pages across time, including websites which have become inaccessible, and are not indexed by search engines such as Google.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wiener-Bronner|first1=Danielle|title=NASA is indexing the 'Deep Web' to show mankind what Google won't|url=https://www.technosakib.com/2020/04/How-to-add-responsive-html-sitemap-for-blogger.html /|publisher=Techno Sakib |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 6, 2020|quote=There are other simpler versions of Memex already available. \"If you've ever used the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine\", which gives you past versions of a website not accessible through Google, then you've technically searched the Deep Web, said [[Chris Mattmann]].}}</ref>\n\n==Content types==\nWhile it is not always possible to directly discover a specific web server's content so that it may be indexed, a site potentially can be accessed indirectly (due to [[Vulnerability (computing)|computer vulnerabilities]]).\n\nTo discover content on the web, search engines use [[web crawler]]s that follow hyperlinks through known protocol virtual [[port (computer networking)|port numbers]]. This technique is ideal for discovering content on the surface web but is often ineffective at finding deep web content. For example, these crawlers do not attempt to find dynamic pages that are the result of database queries due to the indeterminate number of queries that are possible.<ref name=\"wright2009\">{{cite news\n | last = Wright\n | first = Alex\n | title = Exploring a 'Deep Web' That Google Can't Grasp\n | work = The New York Times\n | date = 2009-02-22\n | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/technology/internet/23search.html?th&emc=th\n | accessdate = 2009-02-23}}</ref> It has been noted that this can be (partially) overcome by providing links to query results, but this could unintentionally inflate the popularity for a member of the deep web.\n\n[[DeepPeep]], [[Intute]], [[Deep Web Technologies]], [[Scirus]], and [[Ahmia.fi]] are a few search engines that have accessed the deep web.

The [[Sitemap Protocol]] (first developed, and introduced by Google in 2005) and [[Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting|OAI-PMH]] are mechanisms that allow search engines and other interested parties to discover deep web resources on particular web servers. Both mechanisms allow web servers to advertise the URLs that are accessible on them, thereby allowing automatic discovery of resources that are not directly linked to the surface web. Google's deep web surfacing system computes submissions for each HTML form and adds the resulting HTML pages into the Google search engine index. The surfaced results account for a thousand queries per second to deep web content.<ref>{{cite journal\n | first = Jayant\n | last = Madhavan\n | authorlink =\n | first2 = David | last2 = Ko | first3

It consists of a missile warning system ([[AN/AAR-54]]), an integration unit, a processor, and laser turrets (Small Laser Transmitter Assembly, SLTA).

It drew top drivers from [[Europe]] including [[Bernd Rosemeyer]], [[Richard Seaman|Richard \"Dick\" Seaman]], [[Richard Ormonde Shuttleworth]] and the 1939 winner [[Luigi Villoresi]].\n\n[[World War II]] brought an end to the race, but it was revived in 1960 as part of the [[Formula One]] circuit, entering the World Championship calendar two years later. It was a popular F1 event, but the Grand Prix was suspended right after the controversial [[1985 South African Grand Prix|1985 race]], due to the nation's policy of [[apartheid]].<ref name=\"norace86\">AUTO RACING; [3 STAR Edition] Compiled from wire reports by Ken Paskman. [[Orlando Sentinel]]. Orlando, Fla.: 24 October 1985. pg. B.2</ref> Following the end of apartheid in 1991, two further races were held in 1992 and the last time, 1993.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Prince George Circuit.svg|thumb|right|[[Prince George Circuit]] (built in 1959)]]\n[[File:Layout of all versions of the Prince George Circuit.png|thumb|right|250px|Layout of all versions of the [[Prince George Circuit]]<br />Brown = 1934, Blue = 1936, Black = 1959]]\n[[File:Kyalami 1968layout.svg|thumb|right|250px|Kyalami (built in 1967)]]\n[[File:Circuit Kyalami.png|thumb|right|250px|Kyalami (built in early 1990s)]]\n\n===East London (1934\u20131966)===\n\nThe first South African Grands Prix were held on a [[Prince George Circuit|circuit]] of 23.4&nbsp;km that ran through different populated areas of the coastal city of [[East London, South Africa|East London]]. This was shortened to 17.7&nbsp;km in 1936. After [[World War II]], when racing was halted, a permanent circuit was built in 1959. The first South African F1 race was held on 29 December 1962. In that race, [[Graham Hill]] took advantage of [[Jim Clark]]'s mechanical problems with his [[Lotus F1|Lotus]] and took race victory and the championship. The race was held at [[Prince George Circuit|Prince George]] again in 1963 and 1965. In 1967, the race was moved to the [[Kyalami]] circuit near the high-altitude inland city of Johannesburg in the Transvaal, where it would remain as long as the South African Grand Prix was on the official Formula One calendar.\n\n===Kyalami (1967\u20131985)===\nThe fast Kyalami circuit, which was built in the early 1960s, played host to its first South African Grand Prix in 1967, where privateer John Love nearly took victory but ran into fuel problems late in the race, and Mexican [[Pedro Rodr\u00edguez (racing driver)|Pedro Rodriguez]] took victory. 1968 saw Clark take victory; he broke [[Juan Manuel Fangio]]'s record for most career wins and it turned out to be his last F1 victory; he was killed at a Formula 2 race at Hockenheim later that year. 1969 saw [[Jackie Stewart]] win, and the following year 44-year-old veteran [[Jack Brabham]] won his last F1 race. 1971 saw American Mario Andretti won his first F1 race in a Ferrari. 1974 saw American Peter Revson crash horribly at Barbeque Bend during testing for the race and slam head-on to the barriers; he later died from his injuries. Argentine [[Carlos Reutemann]] won for the first time at that year's event. 1975 saw South African [[Jody Scheckter]] take victory. The 1977 event was the location of one of the most gruesome crashes in history, as [[Tom Pryce]] was [[Tom Pryce#Death|killed]] when he hit and killed track marshal Jansen Van Vuuren at full speed in [[1977 South African Grand Prix|1977]]. Niki Lauda won the race, but the accident sent shock waves throughout the sport. 1978 saw Ronnie Peterson take a late victory from Patrick Depailler and Riccardo Patrese; and the 1979 event was held in changeable weather conditions and was won by Canadian [[Gilles Villeneuve]].\n\nGoing into the 1980s, turbo-charged cars began to dominate the Grand Prix. Because of the high altitude of the fast Kyalami circuit (approximately 6,000 feet above sea level) the forced induction turbo engines could regulate how much air went into the engine whereas the normally aspirated engines could not, the turbo-charged engines had a horsepower advantage in 1982 of 150&nbsp;hp over the normally aspirated engines, and often qualified on the front row of the grid considerably faster than the normally aspirated engined cars; and the Renault team dominated both the 1980 and 1982 races; Frenchman [[Alain Prost]] won the 1982 race after he lost a wheel around mid-distance; he charged through the field and took victory from Carlos Reutemann.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160425014832/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRB77tm1yTM ]</ref> The 1981 event was a victim of the [[FISA\u2013FOCA war]]. As agreement could not be reached with [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile|FISA]] for the Grand Prix to be run as a round of the Formula One World Championship or as a non-championship Formula One race, it was officially staged as a [[Formula Libre]] event. Consequently, it was contested only by the [[Formula One Constructors Association|FOCA]]-aligned teams, with cars which did not strictly comply with the 1981 Formula One regulations.<ref>[http://forix.autosport.com/8w/za81.html  The one that didn't count] Retrieved from forix.autosport.com on 9 February 2010</ref> The 1983 event was the last race of that season, and it saw a three-way battle for the Drivers' Championship between Prost, Brazilian Nelson Piquet and Frenchman Rene Arnoux. Prost and Arnoux both went out with engine problems and Piquet took 3rd place and the Drivers' Championship; Prost made scathing comments about Renault's conservative approach to developing the car, and he was fired from the team. Piquet's Italian teammate [[Riccardo Patrese]] won the race. 1984 saw the event take place early in the season, and Prost (now driving for McLaren) started from the pit lane in the spare car after his race car didn't start. This was made legal when the first start was aborted after Briton [[Nigel Mansell]] stalled on the grid. Prost drove through the field to finish 2nd behind his teammate Niki Lauda. Briton [[Derek Warwick]] completed the podium in a Renault and Brazilian future world champion [[Ayrton Senna]] scored his first point in a Toleman, finishing 6th.\n\nThe [[1985 South African Grand Prix|1985 race]] was mired in international controversy as nations began boycotting South African sporting events because of a state of emergency declared by the South African government in July of that year because of a surge of violence related to racial segregation in the country, called [[apartheid]]. Most people involved in Formula One were strongly against going to race in South Africa. Some governments tried to ban their drivers from going,<ref name=\"sfchronic\">Martin, Gordon. \"The Apartheid Controversy Reaches Formula 1 Racing\". [[San Francisco Chronicle]] [FINAL Edition]. San Francisco, Calif.: 17 September 1985. pg. 63</ref> and the [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] and [[Renault F1|Renault]] teams did boycott the race in line with the [[Cabinet of France|French Government]]'s ban on sporting events in South Africa;<ref>[[Rob Walker (motorsport)|Walker, Rob]].

Los Angeles, Calif.: 20 October 1985. pg. 20</ref> and Philippe Steriff, both driving for British teams, did take part. British driver [[Nigel Mansell]] won his second consecutive Formula One race and his teammate [[Keke Rosberg]] stormed around the track after 2 pitstops to take 2nd, completing a 1\u20132 for the Williams team.<ref name=\"latimes\" /> 1985 was the final South African Grand Prix until the end of apartheid, with [[FIA]] president [[Jean-Marie Balestre]] announcing days after the race that a Grand Prix would not return to the nation because of apartheid.<ref name=\"norace86\" />\n\n===Brief return (1992\u20131993)===\n\nAfter the end of apartheid in 1991, Formula One returned to Kyalami for two Grands Prix in {{F1|1992}} and {{F1|1993}}. The 1992 event was dominated by Mansell and the 1993 running saw an intense battle between Prost, [[Ayrton Senna]] and [[Michael Schumacher]], with Prost taking victory. In July 1993 Kyalami was sold to the South African Automobile Association, which managed to run the facility at a profit; however, running a Formula One event proved too costly and the Grand Prix did not return.\n\nThe only South African driver to win the South African Grand Prix was [[Jody Scheckter]] in [[1975 South African Grand Prix|1975]]. British driver Jim Clark won it 4 times and Austrian driver Niki Lauda won 3 times.\n\n=== Possibility of a return ===\nIn April 2018, ''The South African'' discussed the possibility of South Africa returning to the Formula One Grand Prix calendar with Adrian Scholtz, CEO of Motorsport South Africa. He said that the main obstacles are the high costs of hosting such an event and the fact that currently no South African racetrack fulfills the FIA requirements to host a Formula One race, although Kyalami comes close.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesouthafrican.com/will-south-africa-ever-host-an-f1-grand-prix-again/|title=Will South Africa ever host an F1 Grand Prix again?|date=16 April 2018|work=The South African|access-date=9 August 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Official names and sponsors==\n*1961: International [[Royal Automobile Club|R.A.C.]] South African Grand Prix\n*1962\u20131963, 1965\u20131966: International [[Royal Automobile Club|R.A.C.]] Grand Prix of S.A.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progcovers.com/motor/f11963.html|title=1963 Formula 1 Programmes - The Motor Racing Programme Covers Project|first=Malcolm|last=Mitchell|website=www.progcovers.com}}</ref>\n*1967\u20131973: A.A.

It drew top drivers from [[Europe]] including [[Bernd Rosemeyer]], [[Richard Seaman|Richard \"Dick\" Seaman]], [[Richard Ormonde Shuttleworth]] and the 1939 winner [[Luigi Villoresi]].\n\n[[World War II]] brought an end to the race, but it was revived in 1960 as part of the [[Formula One]] circuit, entering the World Championship calendar two years later. It was a popular F1 event, but the Grand Prix was suspended right after the controversial [[1985 South African Grand Prix|1985 race]], due to the nation's policy of [[apartheid]].<ref name=\"norace86\">AUTO RACING; [3 STAR Edition] Compiled from wire reports by Ken Paskman. [[Orlando Sentinel]]. Orlando, Fla.: 24 October 1985. pg. B.2</ref> Following the end of apartheid in 1991, two further races were held in 1992 and the last time, 1993.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Prince George Circuit.svg|thumb|right|[[Prince George Circuit]] (built in 1959)]]\n[[File:Layout of all versions of the Prince George Circuit.png|thumb|right|250px|Layout of all versions of the [[Prince George Circuit]]<br />Brown = 1934, Blue = 1936, Black = 1959]]\n[[File:Kyalami 1968layout.svg|thumb|right|250px|Kyalami (built in 1967)]]\n[[File:Circuit Kyalami.png|thumb|right|250px|Kyalami (built in early 1990s)]]\n\n===East London (1934 - 1966)===\n\nThe first South African Grands Prix were held on a [[Prince George Circuit|circuit]] of 23.4&nbsp;km that ran through different populated areas of the coastal city of [[East London, South Africa|East London]]. This was shortened to 17.7&nbsp;km in 1936. After [[World War II]], when racing was halted, a permanent circuit was built in 1959. The first South African F1 race was held on 29 December 1962. In that race, [[Graham Hill]] took advantage of [[Jim Clark]]'s mechanical problems with his [[Lotus F1|Lotus]] and took race victory and the championship. The race was held at [[Prince George Circuit|Prince George]] again in 1963 and 1965. In 1967, the race was moved to the [[Kyalami]] circuit near the high-altitude inland city of Johannesburg in the Transvaal, where it would remain as long as the South African Grand Prix was on the official Formula One calendar.\n\n===Kyalami (1967 - 1985)===\nThe fast Kyalami circuit, which was built in the early 1960s, played host to its first South African Grand Prix in 1967, where privateer John Love nearly took victory but ran into fuel problems late in the race, and Mexican [[Pedro Rodr\u00edguez (racing driver)|Pedro Rodriguez]] took victory. 1968 saw Clark take victory; he broke [[Juan Manuel Fangio]]'s record for most career wins and it turned out to be his last F1 victory; he was killed at a Formula 2 race at Hockenheim later that year. 1969 saw [[Jackie Stewart]] win, and the following year 44-year-old veteran [[Jack Brabham]] won his last F1 race. 1971 saw American Mario Andretti won his first F1 race in a Ferrari. 1974 saw American Peter Revson crash horribly at Barbeque Bend during testing for the race and slam head-on to the barriers; he later died from his injuries. Argentine [[Carlos Reutemann]] won for the first time at that year's event. 1975 saw South African [[Jody Scheckter]] take victory. The 1977 event was the location of one of the most gruesome crashes in history, as [[Tom Pryce]] was [[Tom Pryce#Death|killed]] when he hit and killed track marshal Jansen Van Vuuren at full speed in [[1977 South African Grand Prix|1977]]. Niki Lauda won the race, but the accident sent shock waves throughout the sport. 1978 saw Ronnie Peterson take a late victory from Patrick Depailler and Riccardo Patrese; and the 1979 event was held in changeable weather conditions and was won by Canadian [[Gilles Villeneuve]].\n\nGoing into the 1980s, turbo-charged cars began to dominate the Grand Prix. Because of the high altitude of the fast Kyalami circuit (approximately 6,000 feet above sea level) the forced induction turbo engines could regulate how much air went into the engine whereas the normally aspirated engines could not, the turbo-charged engines had a horsepower advantage in 1982 of 150&nbsp;hp over the normally aspirated engines, and often qualified on the front row of the grid considerably faster than the normally aspirated engined cars; and the Renault team dominated both the 1980 and 1982 races; Frenchman [[Alain Prost]] won the 1982 race after he lost a wheel around mid-distance; he charged through the field and took victory from Carlos Reutemann.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160425014832/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRB77tm1yTM ]</ref> The 1981 event was a victim of the [[FISA\u2013FOCA war]]. As agreement could not be reached with [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile|FISA]] for the Grand Prix to be run as a round of the Formula One World Championship or as a non-championship Formula One race, it was officially staged as a [[Formula Libre]] event. Consequently, it was contested only by the [[Formula One Constructors Association|FOCA]]-aligned teams, with cars which did not strictly comply with the 1981 Formula One regulations.<ref>[http://forix.autosport.com/8w/za81.html  The one that didn't count] Retrieved from forix.autosport.com on 9 February 2010</ref> The 1983 event was the last race of that season, and it saw a three-way battle for the Drivers' Championship between Prost, Brazilian Nelson Piquet and Frenchman Rene Arnoux. Prost and Arnoux both went out with engine problems and Piquet took 3rd place and the Drivers' Championship; Prost made scathing comments about Renault's conservative approach to developing the car, and he was fired from the team. Piquet's Italian teammate [[Riccardo Patrese]] won the race. 1984 saw the event take place early in the season, and Prost (now driving for McLaren) started from the pit lane in the spare car after his race car didn't start. This was made legal when the first start was aborted after Briton [[Nigel Mansell]] stalled on the grid. Prost drove through the field to finish 2nd behind his teammate Niki Lauda. Briton [[Derek Warwick]] completed the podium in a Renault and Brazilian future world champion [[Ayrton Senna]] scored his first point in a Toleman, finishing 6th.\n\nThe [[1985 South African Grand Prix|1985 race]] was mired in international controversy as nations began boycotting South African sporting events because of a state of emergency declared by the South African government in July of that year because of a surge of violence related to racial segregation in the country, called [[apartheid]]. Most people involved in Formula One were strongly against going to race in South Africa. Some governments tried to ban their drivers from going,<ref name=\"sfchronic\">Martin, Gordon. \"The Apartheid Controversy Reaches Formula 1 Racing\". [[San Francisco Chronicle]] [FINAL Edition]. San Francisco, Calif.: 17 September 1985. pg. 63</ref> and the [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] and [[Renault F1|Renault]] teams did boycott the race in line with the [[Cabinet of France|French Government]]'s ban on sporting events in South Africa;<ref>[[Rob Walker (motorsport)|Walker, Rob]]. [[Road & Track]]. \"Tiger, Tiger\" New York: Feb 1986.

Los Angeles, Calif.: 20 October 1985. pg. 20</ref> and Philippe Steriff, both driving for British teams, did take part. British driver [[Nigel Mansell]] won his second consecutive Formula One race and his teammate [[Keke Rosberg]] stormed around the track after 2 pitstops to take 2nd, completing a 1\u20132 for the Williams team.<ref name=\"latimes\" /> 1985 was the final South African Grand Prix until the end of apartheid, with [[FIA]] president [[Jean-Marie Balestre]] announcing days after the race that a Grand Prix would not return to the nation because of apartheid.<ref name=\"norace86\" />\n\n===Brief return (1992 - 1993)===\n\nAfter the end of apartheid in 1991, Formula One returned to Kyalami for two Grands Prix in {{F1|1992}} and {{F1|1993}}. The 1992 event was dominated by Mansell and the 1993 running saw an intense battle between Prost, [[Ayrton Senna]] and [[Michael Schumacher]], with Prost taking victory. In July 1993 Kyalami was sold to the South African Automobile Association, which managed to run the facility at a profit; however, running a Formula One event proved too costly and the Grand Prix did not return.\n\nThe only South African driver to win the South African Grand Prix was [[Jody Scheckter]] in [[1975 South African Grand Prix|1975]]. British driver Jim Clark won it 4 times and Austrian driver Niki Lauda won 3 times.\n\n=== Possibility of a return ===\nIn April 2018, ''The South African'' discussed the possibility of South Africa returning to the Formula One Grand Prix calendar with Adrian Scholtz, CEO of Motorsport South Africa. He said that the main obstacles are the high costs of hosting such an event and the fact that currently no South African racetrack fulfills the FIA requirements to host a Formula One race, although Kyalami comes close.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesouthafrican.com/will-south-africa-ever-host-an-f1-grand-prix-again/|title=Will South Africa ever host an F1 Grand Prix again?|date=16 April 2018|work=The South African|access-date=9 August 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Official names and sponsors==\n*1961: International [[Royal Automobile Club|R.A.C.]] South African Grand Prix\n*1962\u20131963, 1965\u20131966: International [[Royal Automobile Club|R.A.C.]] Grand Prix of S.A.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progcovers.com/motor/f11963.html|title=1963 Formula 1 Programmes - The Motor Racing Programme Covers Project|first=Malcolm|last=Mitchell|website=www.progcovers.com}}</ref>\n*1967\u20131973: A.A.
