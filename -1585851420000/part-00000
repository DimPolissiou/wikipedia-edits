Two spiritual religious institutions, suggested by the [[Council of Trent]] were formed: the ''Schola del Santissimo Sacramento'' and the ''Schola della Dottrina cristiana''.<ref>{{Cite book|last1= Tribuzio Zotti|first1= Luciana|last2= Magni|first2= Giuseppe|title = Brugherio: una citt\u00e0 nel segno dei Magi|pages = 38\u201339}}</ref> The first of these was founded in 1578 and it was created to encourage the congregation to get involved in partivular devotional practices. The ''Schola della Dottrina cristiana'' on the other hand was to instruct the faithful in matters of faith and remove them from [[heresy]]. The Church's most notable event during this time, however, was to be the Papal recognition of the church's relics of the three Magi. The major part of these relics were transferred in [[Cologne]] by Federico Borromeo in 1613. In this same year, on 27 May,<ref>{{Cite book|last1= Tribuzio Zotti|first1= Luciana|last2= Magni|first2= Giuseppe|title = Brugherio: una citt\u00e0 nel segno dei Magi|language= Italian|page = 52}}</ref> the partial relics were transferred from the nearby [[Ambrose|saint Ambrogio]]'s [[Saint Ambrose, Brugherio|church]], while under the supervision of the parish priest Francesco Bernardino Paleario.\n\n===19th century===\n\n==== De Petri's ''Cronaca'' ====\n[[File:Frontispiece of Paolo Antonio De Petri.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of Paolo Antonio De Petri's manuscript of 1794]]\nAntonio De Petri (or Petro), parish priest from 1778 to 1819, took inspiration from the Monza historian [[Antonio Francesco Frisi]]'s works, called ''Memorie storiche della citt\u00e0 di Monza'',<ref name=ency>[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/antonio-francesco-frisi_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)/ Antonio Frisi], Enciclopedia Italiana (1932), Retrieved 27 August 2015</ref> and wrote a report about Saint Bartholomew's church.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Brugherio la nostra gente|page = 145}}</ref> He described that the church's fa\u00e7ade was decorated with cornices, [[pilaster]]s and bands with a pediment [[gable]]d sharp that \"befitted the structure itself\".

For most of 2003, Howard Dean had been the apparent front-runner for the nomination, performing strongly in most polls and leading the pack in fund-raising. However, Kerry won the [[Iowa caucus]]es and [[New Hampshire primary]], which gave him enough momentum to carry the majority of the rest of the states.\n\n===Election issues===\nAccording to exit polls taking during the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2008|Iowa Caucuses]], the top 4 issues were ranked as follows:<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/primaries/pages/epolls/IA/index.html| title = CNN.com 2004 Primaries | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\n# Economy/Jobs (29% of Respondents)\n# Health Care/Medicine (28% of Respondents)\n# The war in Iraq (14% of Respondents)\n# Education (14% of Respondents)\n\n====Economy====\nDespite being characterized by many as an election on [[Iraq]], the economy and jobs were repeatedly cited as voters' top or one of top three concerns during the course of the primary season. In [[Iowa]], of those who cited the [[economy]] as their most important issue, 34% supported Kerry, while 33% supported Edwards, with Dean trailing at 16% and Gephardt at 12%.\n\nEventual nominee [[John Kerry]], much like other Democrats adopted policy stances of tax-cuts for the middle class, increased spending for Social Security, and assisting small businesses.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/special/president/issues/index.kerry.html| title = CNN.com Specials | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> On the aspect of job creation, Kerry strongly supported the creation and safety of infrastructure-related jobs, like those in the railroad industry. During the course of the primary Kerry continued to advocate positions such as fiscal responsibility and end state fiscal crises by giving states increased fiscal aid.\n\nRunner up [[John Edwards]] ran a position of support for the [[middle class]] as well as [[budget]] caps and enforcement.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/special/president/issues/index.edwards.html| title = CNN.com Specials | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> Strongly opposing Social Security privatization, and interested in middle class tax cuts, Edwards's main economic theme was support for the middle class touting his own struggle, growing up the son of a poor mill worker in [[South Carolina]]. Another major component of Edwards's message was to be able to reinstate fiscal responsibility.\n\n[[Howard Dean]], despite taking many of the same positions of his rivals including Edwards and Kerry, had a starkly different approach on the issue of Social Security and tax cuts.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/special/president/issues/index.dean.html| title = CNN.com Specials | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> On taxes, Dean favored repealing the [[Bush Tax cuts]] not only for the wealthiest of Americans as Senator Edwards and Senator Kerry proposed, but for all, including middle and lower classes.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/12/us/tax-cuts-split-the-democratic-presidential-field.html |title=Tax Cuts Split the Democratic Presidential Field |last=Rosenbaum |first=David E. |date=2003-09-12 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-12-09 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==== Iraq War ====\nAfter the 9/11 attacks, the Bush administration argued that the need to remove [[Saddam Hussein]] from power in [[Iraq]] had now become urgent. Over the course of several months, Bush presented several premises for war, but the turning point was that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire [[nuclear material]] and had not properly accounted for [[biological weapons|biological]] and [[chemical weapons|chemical]] material it was known to have possessed, potential [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD) in violation of [[Iraq sanctions|U.N. sanctions]].  This\nsituation escalated to the point that the United States assembled a group of about forty nations, including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], and [[Poland]], which Bush called the \"[[coalition of the willing]]\", to invade Iraq.\n\nThe coalition invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003.  Most contenders for the nomination were supportive of the effort.  Only Dean and Kucinich firmly questioned the aims and tactics of the administration, setting themselves apart in the eyes of war protesters.  However, speaking before an audience in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]], John Kerry said, \"We need a regime change not just in Iraq. We need a regime change here in the United States.\"<ref>{{cite news | last=Poor | first=Eric | title=Kerry calls for new U.S. leadership |date=2003-04-03 | publisher=Monadnock Ledger | url=http://www.mledger.com/2003/archives/1_news_040303.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040917004530/http://www.mledger.com/2003/archives/1_news_040303.shtml | archivedate=2004-09-17}}</ref>  Republicans criticized Kerry for speaking out against a wartime president.<ref>{{cite news | last=Pickler | first=Nedra | title=POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: Hastert, Delay assail Kerry speech; Edwards chats with Bush; Dean writing a book | date=2003-04-03 | agency=Associated Press | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2003/04/03/national1601EST0726.DTL | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030624183241/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fnews%2Farchive%2F2003%2F04%2F03%2Fnational1601EST0726.DTL | archivedate=2003-06-24 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe invasion was swift, with the collapse of the Iraq government and the [[military of Iraq]] in about three weeks. The oil infrastructure of Iraq was rapidly secured with limited damage in that time. On May 1, [[George W. Bush]] landed on the aircraft carrier [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'']] in a [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]] [[S-3 Viking]], where he gave a speech announcing the end of major combat in the Iraq war. Clearly visible in the background was a banner stating \"Mission Accomplished\". Bush's landing was criticized by opponents as being overly theatrical and expensive. The banner, made by [[White House]] personnel (according to a [[CNN]] story:<ref>{{cite news | last=Bash | first=Dana  | title=White House pressed on 'mission accomplished' sign |date=2003-10-29 | publisher=CNN | url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/28/mission.accomplished/}}\n</ref>) and placed there by the U.S. Navy, was criticized as premature. Nonetheless, Bush's approval rating in the month of May rode at 66%, according to a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll.<ref>{{cite news | title=Bush Jumpstarts '04 Fundraising |date=2003-05-24 | agency=Associated Press | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/05/24/politics/main555427.shtml | work=CBS News}}</ref>\n\nOn May 3, 2003, Democrats met at the [[University of South Carolina Columbia|University of South Carolina]] in the first formal debate between the nine challengers for the nomination. The candidates disagreed on the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war against Iraq]], health insurance, and even President Bush's tax cuts, but united in criticizing Bush's handling of the economy.\n\n=== Dean emerges as front-runner ===\n{{main|John Kerry 2004 presidential campaign| John Edwards 2004 presidential campaign| Howard Dean 2004 presidential campaign| Wesley Clark 2004 presidential campaign}}\n[[Image:Howard Dean declaration of candidacy June 2003.jpg|thumb|300px|Howard Dean declared his candidacy on June 23, 2003, winning the MoveOn \"primary\" days later.

Though this was almost two years before the Iowa Caucus, Dean hoped the early start would give him some much needed name recognition.  As a governor of a small state, Dean was not well known outside of New England.\n\nIn December of that year, [[John Kerry|John F.

Kerry's experience as a decorated [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] veteran generated some excitement among Democrats tired of being on the defensive about their candidates' suitability in the role of \"commander in chief\".\n\nTwo weeks later, former [[Vice President of the United States of America|Vice President]] and [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential candidate]] [[Al Gore]] announced on the [[CBS]] program ''[[60 Minutes]]'' that he would not seek election to the presidency in 2004. Gore had recently wrapped up a nationwide book tour and had been widely expected to run.\n\nOther potential candidates were likely waiting to see what Gore's plans were, and thus the floodgates opened in January 2003. Senator [[Joe Lieberman|Joseph Lieberman]], Gore's 2000 vice presidential running mate,  had previously promised not to run should Gore seek their party's nomination. Freed from that obligation, Lieberman announced his intention to run.  Additionally, many other candidates announced their intention to form committees (a formality usually indicating an official run): U.S. Sen. [[John Edwards|John R. Edwards]] of [[North Carolina]], U.S. Rep. [[Dick Gephardt|Richard A. \"Dick\" Gephardt]] of [[Missouri]], and Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] of [[New York (state)|New York]].  In February, more candidates announced their intentions: former Senator from [[Illinois]] [[Carol Moseley Braun]], U.S. Representative from [[Ohio]] [[Dennis Kucinich]], and [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Bob Graham]] of [[Florida]].\n\nThere were other potential candidates for whom some speculation was buzzing about a potential run. These candidates felt it necessary to officially state that they would not seek the party nomination. These included [[United States Senate]] Minority Leader [[Tom Daschle]], U.S. Senator [[Christopher Dodd]] of [[Connecticut]], and former U.S. Senator [[Gary Hart]] from [[Colorado]].\n\nIn April, Democratic fund-raising totals for the first quarter of 2003 were reported. John Edwards raised $7.4 million, John Kerry raised $7.0 million, Dick Gephardt raised $3.5 million, Joe Lieberman raised $3.0 million, Howard Dean raised $2.6 million, Bob Graham raised $1.1 million, and Dennis Kucinich and Carol Moseley Braun raised less than $1 million each.\n\nIn June 2003, [[Howard Dean]] aired the first [[television]] advertising of the 2004 campaign, spending more than $300,000.  During that time, he formally announced his run for president, filing to form a presidential election campaign with the FEC.  Later that month, liberal advocacy website [[MoveOn]] held the first ever online Democratic \"primary\", which lasted just over 48 hours. It was an unofficial and nonbinding affair, but with important symbolic and financial value.  Of 317,647 votes, [[Howard Dean]] received 44%, [[Dennis Kucinich]] 24%, and [[John Kerry]] 16%.  Had any candidate received 50% of the vote, the candidate would have received MoveOn's endorsement and financial support.  Instead, MoveOn supported all the candidates.<ref>{{cite web | title=Report on the 2003 MoveOn.org Political Action Primary | work=MoveOn.org | url=http://moveon.org/pac/primary/report.html | accessdate=September 28, 2005 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050929062844/http://moveon.org/pac/primary/report.html | archivedate=September 29, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nIn July, the Democratic fund-raising numbers for the second quarter of 2003 were reported and announced.  Howard Dean surprised many raising $7.5 million, John Kerry raised $6 million, while John Edwards and Joseph Lieberman raised roughly $5 million each.  Dean's strength as a fund-raiser was attributed mainly to his innovative embrace of the Internet for campaigning.  The majority of his donations came from individual Dean supporters, who came to be known as ''Deanites'', or, more commonly, ''[[Deaniac]]s''.  His campaign's innovative use of the [[Internet]] helped to build a strongly supportive [[grassroots]] constituency, much of which remained intensely loyal to him long after the end of his candidacy.\n\nBy autumn of 2003, Dean had become the apparent front-runner for the Democratic nomination, performing strongly in most polls.  Generally regarded as a pragmatic [[centrist]] during his time as governor, Dean emerged during his presidential campaign as something of a [[populism|populist]], denouncing the policies of the Bush administration (especially the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]) as well as fellow Democrats, who, in his view, failed to strongly oppose them.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, critics on the right labeled Dean's political views as those of an extreme [[Liberalism|liberal]]; however, in liberal [[Vermont]], Dean, long known as a staunch advocate of fiscal restraint, was regarded as a moderate. Many critics on the left, who supported fellow Democrat [[Dennis Kucinich]] or independent [[Ralph Nader]], charged that, at heart, Dean was a \"[[Rockefeller Republican]]\"&mdash;socially liberal, while fiscally conservative.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/17/politics |title=Howard Dean: 'the flip flop candidate' |last=Raban |first=Jonathan |date=2004-01-17 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2017-12-09 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== Wesley Clark enters ===\nOver the summer of 2003, several organized groups began a [[United States|nationwide]] campaign to \"[[Political draft|draft]]\" retired [[general|four-star general]] [[Wesley Clark]] for the Democratic Party's nomination for the 2004 presidential election. CNN on August 13 showed a [[Television commercial|commercial]] by one of these groups and interviewed Clark. He disavowed any connection with the \"draft Clark\" groups, but said he had been considering his position and that within a few weeks he would likely make public his decision on whether to\nrun. He also fueled speculation with a television interview in which he first declared himself a Democrat.\n\nOn September 17, 2003, in Little Rock, Arkansas, Clark announced his intention to run in the [[U.S. Democratic Party Presidential Primary, 2004|presidential primary election]] for the Democratic Party nomination, becoming the tenth and last Democrat to do so (coming many months after the others): \"My name is Wes Clark.  I am from Little Rock, Arkansas, and I am here to announce that I intend to seek the presidency of the United States of America.\"  He said, \"We're going to run a campaign that will move this country forward, not back.\"\n\nHis campaign focused on themes of leadership and patriotism; early campaign ads relied heavily on biography. His late start left him with relatively few detailed policy proposals. This weakness was apparent in his first few debates, although he soon presented a range of position papers, including a major tax-relief plan. Nevertheless, many Democrats flocked to his campaign.  They were drawn by his military background, and saw such foreign policy credentials as a valuable asset in challenging [[George W. Bush]] post-[[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks|September 11]]. Advisors and supporters portrayed him as more electable than [[Howard Dean]], who was still the front-runner for the party's nomination.  Despite the burst of enthusiasm for Clark in late 2003, Dean maintained a strong lead in the polls for the latter half of the year.  Clark won the Democratic Presidential Primary in [[Oklahoma]], the only state carried by Clark in the primary election.\n\nCriticism of Clark began almost the moment he entered the race. Originally heralded as an antiwar general, he stumbled in the first few days of his candidacy. He was perceived as changing his answer on how he would have voted on the Iraq war resolution.  His supporters argued that his perceived indecision was due to lack of experience with the media and their insistence on short \"sound bite\" answers.\n\n=== Iowa and New Hampshire ===\nThroughout the early campaigning season, the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2004|Iowa caucuses]] appeared to be a two-way contest between former [[Vermont]] Governor [[Howard Dean]] and [[Missouri]] Congressman [[Richard Gephardt]]. Dean, the national front runner, had been able to pour money into [[Iowa]] and [[New Hampshire]]. In total, Dean spent nearly $40 million in the two states.<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E1DF1038F93AA15752C0A9629C8B63| title =  THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE FORMER GOVERNOR; IN SHAKE-UP, DEAN NAMES GORE ALLY TO RUN CAMPAIGN | work=The New York Times | first1=Jodi| last1=Wilgoren| first2=Glen| last2=Justice| date=January 29, 2004}}</ref> Gephardt, coming from neighboring Missouri, won the state's caucus in 1988 when he first ran for the party nomination.\n\nHowever, days before the Iowa caucuses were held, negative campaigning by Dean and Gephardt took a late toll on the two campaigns in Iowa as well as nationally. This, along with the resurgence of John Kerry and the emergence of John Edwards as major contenders in Iowa, put the Gephardt and Dean campaigns on edge.\n\nA poll released by the ''[[Des Moines Register]]'' days before the caucus was held showed Dean and Gephardt had lost all of their lead in Iowa. In the poll, Kerry led with 26% of those surveyed, Edwards came in second with 23%, Dean came in third with 20%, and Gephardt came in fourth with 18%.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/primaries/pages/misc/iowa.recap.html| title = CNN.com 2004 Primaries | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn caucus night, as results were being tallied, it became evident that Kerry and Edwards were in a battle for first and Dean and Gephardt were in a battle for third.\n[[File:Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses, 2004.svg|thumb|Iowa results by county{{legend|#2A7FFF|John Kerry}}{{legend|#ff7f2a|John Edwards}}{{legend|#00ff66|Howard Dean}}{{legend|#666666|Tie}}\n]]\n<nowiki> </nowiki>After all votes were tallied, John Kerry received 38% of the delegates, John Edwards received 32%, Howard Dean received 18%, and Richard Gephardt received 11%.\n\nAfter his poor showing, Gephardt dropped out of the race.<ref>{{ cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/01/19/elec04.prez.gephardt/index.html| title = Gephardt to drop out of race | work=CNN | date=January 18, 2004 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> Kerry and Edwards claimed newfound momentum, while Dean attempted to downplay the results.\n\nIn the [[2004 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire primary]], Kerry was able to defeat Howard Dean once again, beating him 38%-26%.

He finished with 12% in the [[New Hampshire primary]] one week later, essentially tied for third-place position with retired general [[Wesley Clark]]. The following week, Edwards won in [[South Carolina]] and nearly beat Clark in [[Oklahoma]].\n\n[[Image:John-Edwards-Shakes-Hands.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Edwards on the campaign trail in 2004.]]\nAfter Dean's withdrawal from the contest, Edwards became the only major challenger to Kerry for the nomination. However, Kerry continued to dominate, taking in wins in [[Michigan]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Maine]], [[Tennessee]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Nevada]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Utah]], [[Hawaii]], and [[Idaho]]. Remarking on an unexpectedly strong finish in [[Wisconsin]] on February 17, Edwards humorously cautioned Kerry: \"Objects in your mirror may be closer than they appear.\" Many other candidates dropped out during this time, leaving only Kerry, Edwards, Sharpton and Kucinich in the running. Dean, while not officially running, did not release his delegates, and still put in a strong showing considering that he was no longer mounting an official campaign.\n\nEdwards maintained a positive campaign and largely avoided attacking Kerry until a February 29, 2004, debate in [[New York City]], where he attempted to put Kerry on the defensive by characterizing the front-runner as a \"Washington insider\" and by mocking Kerry's plan to form a committee to examine trade agreements.\n\nIn [[Super Tuesday]], March 2, Kerry won decisive victories in the [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], and [[Rhode Island]] primaries and the [[Minnesota]] caucuses. Dean, despite having withdrawn from the race two weeks earlier, won his home state of Vermont. Edwards finished only slightly behind Kerry in Georgia but, failing to win a single state, chose to withdraw, making Kerry the [[presumptive nominee]]. President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] called Senator Kerry to congratulate him that evening.\n\nOn March 11, after meetings with Democratic [[superdelegate]]s in [[Washington, D.C.]], and former [[primary election]] opponents, Kerry accumulated the 2,162 delegates required to clinch the nomination. The [[Democratic National Committee|DNC's]] website acknowledged him as the party's nominee at that time, four and a half months prior to the [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Convention]].\n\n''See also the [[John Kerry 2004 presidential campaign]]''\n\n=== Nomination ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:KerryatDNC.jpg|thumb|238px|Kerry gave a salute and proclaimed, \"I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty.\"|{{deletable image-caption|1=Tuesday, 19 August 2008}}]] -->\n{{details|2004 Democratic National Convention}}\n\nOn July 6, John Kerry selected John Edwards as his running mate shortly before the 2004 Democratic National Convention in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], held later that month.  Senators Kerry and Edwards were formally nominated by the Democratic Party at the convention.  The Kerry/Edwards ticket was on the ballot in all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia.  In [[New York (state)|New York]], the ticket was also on the ballot as candidates of the [[Working Families Party]].\n\n[[Governor of New Mexico|New Mexico Governor]] [[Bill Richardson (politician)|Bill Richardson]] served as chairman of the convention while former presidential advisor to [[Bill Clinton]], [[Lottie Shackelford]],  served as vice chairman.  Defining moments of the 2004 Democratic National Convention included the featured [[keynote speech]] of [[Barack Obama]], a [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] native and candidate for the [[United States Senate]] from [[Illinois]], [[Bill Clinton]]'s opening night speech and the confirmation of the [[Democratic Party presidential nomination, 2004|nomination]] of [[John Kerry]] as the candidate for president and of [[John Edwards]] as the candidate for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].  Kerry made his [[Vietnam War]] experience a prominent theme.  In accepting the nomination, he began his speech with \"I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty.\"\n\nKerry and Edwards faced incumbents [[George W. Bush]] and [[Dick Cheney]] of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] in the [[2004 U.S. presidential election|2004 presidential election]].  Following his official nomination at the Convention, Kerry received only a small [[convention bounce|bounce]] in the polls and remained \"neck and neck\" with Bush.  This was the first time in recent political history that a candidate failed to receive a substantial boost in post-convention poll numbers. Some political pundits attributed this small boost to the unusually small number of undecided voters as compared with previous presidential elections.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Inskeep |first1=Steve |title=Polls: Kerry Got Little Bounce from Boston |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3809479 |website=NPR |accessdate=28 January 2019 |language=en |date=2 August 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe general election was won by Bush, who defeated Kerry.  The election was fought primarily on the issue of the conduct of the [[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]].  Bush defended the actions of his administration, while Kerry contended that the war had been fought incompetently, and that the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]] was a distraction from the War on Terror, not a part of it.\n\n== Overview ==\n{| style=\"margin:auto\"\n|{{#tag:timeline|ImageSize=width:800 height:auto barincrement:20\nPlotArea = top:10 bottom:25 right:10 left:10\nAlignBars =

For most of 2003, Howard Dean had been the apparent front-runner for the nomination, performing strongly in most polls and leading the pack in fund-raising. However, Kerry won the [[Iowa caucus]]es and [[New Hampshire primary]], which gave him enough momentum to carry the majority of the rest of the states.\n\n===Election issues===\nAccording to exit polls taking during the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2008|Iowa Caucuses]], the top 4 issues were ranked as follows:<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/primaries/pages/epolls/IA/index.html| title = CNN.com 2004 Primaries | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\n# Economy/Jobs (29% of Respondents)\n# Health Care/Medicine (28% of Respondents)\n# The war in Iraq (14% of Respondents)\n# Education (14% of Respondents)\n\n====Economy====\nDespite being characterized by many as an election on [[Iraq]], the economy and jobs were repeatedly cited as voters' top or one of top three concerns during the course of the primary season. In [[Iowa]], of those who cited the [[economy]] as their most important issue, 34% supported Kerry, while 33% supported Edwards, with Dean trailing at 16% and Gephardt at 12%.\n\nEventual nominee [[John Kerry]], much like other Democrats adopted policy stances of tax-cuts for the middle class, increased spending for Social Security, and assisting small businesses.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/special/president/issues/index.kerry.html| title = CNN.com Specials | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> On the aspect of job creation, Kerry strongly supported the creation and safety of infrastructure-related jobs, like those in the railroad industry. During the course of the primary Kerry continued to advocate positions such as fiscal responsibility and end state fiscal crises by giving states increased fiscal aid.\n\nRunner up [[John Edwards]] ran a position of support for the [[middle class]] as well as [[budget]] caps and enforcement.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/special/president/issues/index.edwards.html| title = CNN.com Specials | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> Strongly opposing Social Security privatization, and interested in middle class tax cuts, Edwards's main economic theme was support for the middle class touting his own struggle, growing up the son of a poor mill worker in [[South Carolina]].

Over the course of several months, Bush presented several premises for war, but the turning point was that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire [[nuclear material]] and had not properly accounted for [[biological weapons|biological]] and [[chemical weapons|chemical]] material it was known to have possessed, potential [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD) in violation of [[Iraq sanctions|U.N. sanctions]].  This\nsituation escalated to the point that the United States assembled a group of about forty nations, including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], and [[Poland]], which Bush called the \"[[coalition of the willing]]\", to invade Iraq.\n\nThe coalition invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003.  Most contenders for the nomination were supportive of the effort.  Only Dean and Kucinich firmly questioned the aims and tactics of the administration, setting themselves apart in the eyes of war protesters.  However, speaking before an audience in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]], John Kerry said, \"We need a regime change not just in Iraq. We need a regime change here in the United States.\"<ref>{{cite news | last=Poor | first=Eric | title=Kerry calls for new U.S. leadership |date=2003-04-03 | publisher=Monadnock Ledger | url=http://www.mledger.com/2003/archives/1_news_040303.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040917004530/http://www.mledger.com/2003/archives/1_news_040303.shtml | archivedate=2004-09-17}}</ref>  Republicans criticized Kerry for speaking out against a wartime president.<ref>{{cite news | last=Pickler | first=Nedra | title=POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: Hastert, Delay assail Kerry speech; Edwards chats with Bush; Dean writing a book | date=2003-04-03 | agency=Associated Press | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2003/04/03/national1601EST0726.DTL | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030624183241/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fnews%2Farchive%2F2003%2F04%2F03%2Fnational1601EST0726.DTL | archivedate=2003-06-24 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe invasion was swift, with the collapse of the Iraq government and the [[military of Iraq]] in about three weeks. The oil infrastructure of Iraq was rapidly secured with limited damage in that time. On May 1, [[George W. Bush]] landed on the aircraft carrier [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'']] in a [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]] [[S-3 Viking]], where he gave a speech announcing the end of major combat in the Iraq war. Clearly visible in the background was a banner stating \"Mission Accomplished\". Bush's landing was criticized by opponents as being overly theatrical and expensive. The banner, made by [[White House]] personnel (according to a [[CNN]] story:<ref>{{cite news | last=Bash | first=Dana  | title=White House pressed on 'mission accomplished' sign |date=2003-10-29 | publisher=CNN | url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/28/mission.accomplished/}}\n</ref>) and placed there by the U.S. Navy, was criticized as premature. Nonetheless, Bush's approval rating in the month of May rode at 66%, according to a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll.<ref>{{cite news | title=Bush Jumpstarts '04 Fundraising |date=2003-05-24 | agency=Associated Press | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/05/24/politics/main555427.shtml | work=CBS News}}</ref>\n\nOn May 3, 2003, Democrats met at the [[University of South Carolina Columbia|University of South Carolina]] in the first formal debate between the nine challengers for the nomination. The candidates disagreed on the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war against Iraq]], health insurance, and even President Bush's tax cuts, but united in criticizing Bush's handling of the economy.\n\n=== Dean emerges as front-runner ===\n{{main|John Kerry 2004 presidential campaign| John Edwards 2004 presidential campaign| Howard Dean 2004 presidential campaign| Wesley Clark 2004 presidential campaign}}\n[[Image:Howard Dean declaration of candidacy June 2003.jpg|thumb|300px|Howard Dean declared his candidacy on June 23, 2003, winning the MoveOn \"primary\" days later. His campaign would go on to lead most polls and raise the most money in the latter part of 2003.]]\n\nOn May 31, 2002, [[Vermont]] Governor [[Howard Dean]] formed a presidential exploratory committee.  Though this was almost two years before the Iowa Caucus, Dean hoped the early start would give him some much needed name recognition.  As a governor of a small state, Dean was not well known outside of New England.\n\nIn December of that year, [[John Kerry|John F. Kerry]], [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]] from [[Massachusetts]], announced on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]]'' his plans to form an exploratory committee for a possible 2004 presidential run, anticipating a formal announcement \"down the road some months\".  Kerry's experience as a decorated [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] veteran generated some excitement among Democrats tired of being on the defensive about their candidates' suitability in the role of \"commander in chief\".\n\nTwo weeks later, former [[Vice President of the United States of America|Vice President]] and [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential candidate]] [[Al Gore]] announced on the [[CBS]] program ''[[60 Minutes]]'' that he would not seek election to the presidency in 2004. Gore had recently wrapped up a nationwide book tour and had been widely expected to run.\n\nOther potential candidates were likely waiting to see what Gore's plans were, and thus the floodgates opened in January 2003. Senator [[Joe Lieberman|Joseph Lieberman]], Gore's 2000 vice presidential running mate,  had previously promised not to run should Gore seek their party's nomination. Freed from that obligation, Lieberman announced his intention to run.  Additionally, many other candidates announced their intention to form committees (a formality usually indicating an official run): U.S. Sen. [[John Edwards|John R. Edwards]] of [[North Carolina]], U.S. Rep. [[Dick Gephardt|Richard A. \"Dick\" Gephardt]] of [[Missouri]], and Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] of [[New York (state)|New York]].  In February, more candidates announced their intentions: former Senator from [[Illinois]] [[Carol Moseley Braun]], U.S. Representative from [[Ohio]] [[Dennis Kucinich]], and [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Bob Graham]] of [[Florida]].\n\nThere were other potential candidates for whom some speculation was buzzing about a potential run. These candidates felt it necessary to officially state that they would not seek the party nomination. These included [[United States Senate]] Minority Leader [[Tom Daschle]], U.S. Senator [[Christopher Dodd]] of [[Connecticut]], and former U.S. Senator [[Gary Hart]] from [[Colorado]].\n\nIn April, Democratic fund-raising totals for the first quarter of 2003 were reported. John Edwards raised $7.4 million, John Kerry raised $7.0 million, Dick Gephardt raised $3.5 million, Joe Lieberman raised $3.0 million, Howard Dean raised $2.6 million, Bob Graham raised $1.1 million, and Dennis Kucinich and Carol Moseley Braun raised less than $1 million each.\n\nIn June 2003, [[Howard Dean]] aired the first [[television]] advertising of the 2004 campaign, spending more than $300,000.  During that time, he formally announced his run for president, filing to form a presidential election campaign with the FEC.  Later that month, liberal advocacy website [[MoveOn]] held the first ever online Democratic \"primary\", which lasted just over 48 hours. It was an unofficial and nonbinding affair, but with important symbolic and financial value.  Of 317,647 votes, [[Howard Dean]] received 44%, [[Dennis Kucinich]] 24%, and [[John Kerry]] 16%.  Had any candidate received 50% of the vote, the candidate would have received MoveOn's endorsement and financial support.  Instead, MoveOn supported all the candidates.<ref>{{cite web | title=Report on the 2003 MoveOn.org Political Action Primary | work=MoveOn.org | url=http://moveon.org/pac/primary/report.html | accessdate=September 28, 2005 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050929062844/http://moveon.org/pac/primary/report.html | archivedate=September 29, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nIn July, the Democratic fund-raising numbers for the second quarter of 2003 were reported and announced.  Howard Dean surprised many raising $7.5 million, John Kerry raised $6 million, while John Edwards and Joseph Lieberman raised roughly $5 million each.  Dean's strength as a fund-raiser was attributed mainly to his innovative embrace of the Internet for campaigning.  The majority of his donations came from individual Dean supporters, who came to be known as ''Deanites'', or, more commonly, ''[[Deaniac]]s''.  His campaign's innovative use of the [[Internet]] helped to build a strongly supportive [[grassroots]] constituency, much of which remained intensely loyal to him long after the end of his candidacy.\n\nBy autumn of 2003, Dean had become the apparent front-runner for the Democratic nomination, performing strongly in most polls.  Generally regarded as a pragmatic [[centrist]] during his time as governor, Dean emerged during his presidential campaign as something of a [[populism|populist]], denouncing the policies of the Bush administration (especially the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]) as well as fellow Democrats, who, in his view, failed to strongly oppose them.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, critics on the right labeled Dean's political views as those of an extreme [[Liberalism|liberal]]; however, in liberal [[Vermont]], Dean, long known as a staunch advocate of fiscal restraint, was regarded as a moderate. Many critics on the left, who supported fellow Democrat [[Dennis Kucinich]] or independent [[Ralph Nader]], charged that, at heart, Dean was a \"[[Rockefeller Republican]]\"&mdash;socially liberal, while fiscally conservative.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/17/politics |title=Howard Dean: 'the flip flop candidate' |last=Raban |first=Jonathan |date=2004-01-17 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2017-12-09 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== Wesley Clark enters ===\nOver the summer of 2003, several organized groups began a [[United States|nationwide]] campaign to \"[[Political draft|draft]]\" retired [[general|four-star general]] [[Wesley Clark]] for the Democratic Party's nomination for the 2004 presidential election. CNN on August 13 showed a [[Television commercial|commercial]] by one of these groups and interviewed Clark. He disavowed any connection with the \"draft Clark\" groups, but said he had been considering his position and that within a few weeks he would likely make public his decision on whether to\nrun. He also fueled speculation with a television interview in which he first declared himself a Democrat.\n\nOn September 17, 2003, in Little Rock, Arkansas, Clark announced his intention to run in the [[U.S. Democratic Party Presidential Primary, 2004|presidential primary election]] for the Democratic Party nomination, becoming the tenth and last Democrat to do so (coming many months after the others): \"My name is Wes Clark.  I am from Little Rock, Arkansas, and I am here to announce that I intend to seek the presidency of the United States of America.\"  He said, \"We're going to run a campaign that will move this country forward, not back.\"\n\nHis campaign focused on themes of leadership and patriotism; early campaign ads relied heavily on biography. His late start left him with relatively few detailed policy proposals. This weakness was apparent in his first few debates, although he soon presented a range of position papers, including a major tax-relief plan. Nevertheless, many Democrats flocked to his campaign.  They were drawn by his military background, and saw such foreign policy credentials as a valuable asset in challenging [[George W. Bush]] post-[[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks|September 11]]. Advisors and supporters portrayed him as more electable than [[Howard Dean]], who was still the front-runner for the party's nomination.  Despite the burst of enthusiasm for Clark in late 2003, Dean maintained a strong lead in the polls for the latter half of the year.  Clark won the Democratic Presidential Primary in [[Oklahoma]], the only state carried by Clark in the primary election.\n\nCriticism of Clark began almost the moment he entered the race. Originally heralded as an antiwar general, he stumbled in the first few days of his candidacy. He was perceived as changing his answer on how he would have voted on the Iraq war resolution.  His supporters argued that his perceived indecision was due to lack of experience with the media and their insistence on short \"sound bite\" answers.\n\n=== Iowa and New Hampshire ===\nThroughout the early campaigning season, the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2004|Iowa caucuses]] appeared to be a two-way contest between former [[Vermont]] Governor [[Howard Dean]] and [[Missouri]] Congressman [[Richard Gephardt]]. Dean, the national front runner, had been able to pour money into [[Iowa]] and [[New Hampshire]]. In total, Dean spent nearly $40 million in the two states.<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E1DF1038F93AA15752C0A9629C8B63| title =  THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE FORMER GOVERNOR; IN SHAKE-UP, DEAN NAMES GORE ALLY TO RUN CAMPAIGN | work=The New York Times | first1=Jodi| last1=Wilgoren| first2=Glen| last2=Justice| date=January 29, 2004}}</ref> Gephardt, coming from neighboring Missouri, won the state's caucus in 1988 when he first ran for the party nomination.\n\nHowever, days before the Iowa caucuses were held, negative campaigning by Dean and Gephardt took a late toll on the two campaigns in Iowa as well as nationally. This, along with the resurgence of John Kerry and the emergence of John Edwards as major contenders in Iowa, put the Gephardt and Dean campaigns on edge.\n\nA poll released by the ''[[Des Moines Register]]'' days before the caucus was held showed Dean and Gephardt had lost all of their lead in Iowa. In the poll, Kerry led with 26% of those surveyed, Edwards came in second with 23%, Dean came in third with 20%, and Gephardt came in fourth with 18%.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/primaries/pages/misc/iowa.recap.html| title = CNN.com 2004 Primaries | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn caucus night, as results were being tallied, it became evident that Kerry and Edwards were in a battle for first and Dean and Gephardt were in a battle for third.\n[[File:Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses, 2004.svg|thumb|Iowa results by county{{legend|#2A7FFF|John Kerry}}{{legend|#ff7f2a|John Edwards}}{{legend|#00ff66|Howard Dean}}{{legend|#666666|Tie}}\n]]\n<nowiki> </nowiki>After all votes were tallied, John Kerry received 38% of the delegates, John Edwards received 32%, Howard Dean received 18%, and Richard Gephardt received 11%.\n\nAfter his poor showing, Gephardt dropped out of the race.<ref>{{ cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/01/19/elec04.prez.gephardt/index.html| title = Gephardt to drop out of race | work=CNN | date=January 18, 2004 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> Kerry and Edwards claimed newfound momentum, while Dean attempted to downplay the results.\n\nIn the [[2004 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire primary]], Kerry was able to defeat Howard Dean once again, beating him 38%-26%.

The following week, Edwards won in [[South Carolina]] and nearly beat Clark in [[Oklahoma]].\n\n[[Image:John-Edwards-Shakes-Hands.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Edwards on the campaign trail in 2004.]]\nAfter Dean's withdrawal from the contest, Edwards became the only major challenger to Kerry for the nomination. However, Kerry continued to dominate, taking in wins in [[Michigan]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Maine]], [[Tennessee]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Nevada]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Utah]], [[Hawaii]], and [[Idaho]]. Remarking on an unexpectedly strong finish in [[Wisconsin]] on February 17, Edwards humorously cautioned Kerry: \"Objects in your mirror may be closer than they appear.\" Many other candidates dropped out during this time, leaving only Kerry, Edwards, Sharpton and Kucinich in the running. Dean, while not officially running, did not release his delegates, and still put in a strong showing considering that he was no longer mounting an official campaign.\n\nEdwards maintained a positive campaign and largely avoided attacking Kerry until a February 29, 2004, debate in [[New York City]], where he attempted to put Kerry on the defensive by characterizing the front-runner as a \"Washington insider\" and by mocking Kerry's plan to form a committee to examine trade agreements.\n\nIn [[Super Tuesday]], March 2, Kerry won decisive victories in the [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], and [[Rhode Island]] primaries and the [[Minnesota]] caucuses. Dean, despite having withdrawn from the race two weeks earlier, won his home state of Vermont. Edwards finished only slightly behind Kerry in Georgia but, failing to win a single state, chose to withdraw, making Kerry the [[presumptive nominee]]. President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] called Senator Kerry to congratulate him that evening.\n\nOn March 11, after meetings with Democratic [[superdelegate]]s in [[Washington, D.C.]], and former [[primary election]] opponents, Kerry accumulated the 2,162 delegates required to clinch the nomination. The [[Democratic National Committee|DNC's]] website acknowledged him as the party's nominee at that time, four and a half months prior to the [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Convention]].\n\n''See also the [[John Kerry 2004 presidential campaign]]''\n\n=== Nomination ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:KerryatDNC.jpg|thumb|238px|Kerry gave a salute and proclaimed, \"I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty.\"|{{deletable image-caption|1=Tuesday, 19 August 2008}}]] -->\n{{details|2004 Democratic National Convention}}\n\nOn July 6, John Kerry selected John Edwards as his running mate shortly before the 2004 Democratic National Convention in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], held later that month.  Senators Kerry and Edwards were formally nominated by the Democratic Party at the convention.  The Kerry/Edwards ticket was on the ballot in all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia.  In [[New York (state)|New York]], the ticket was also on the ballot as candidates of the [[Working Families Party]].\n\n[[Governor of New Mexico|New Mexico Governor]] [[Bill Richardson (politician)|Bill Richardson]] served as chairman of the convention while former presidential advisor to [[Bill Clinton]], [[Lottie Shackelford]],  served as vice chairman.  Defining moments of the 2004 Democratic National Convention included the featured [[keynote speech]] of [[Barack Obama]], a [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] native and candidate for the [[United States Senate]] from [[Illinois]], [[Bill Clinton]]'s opening night speech and the confirmation of the [[Democratic Party presidential nomination, 2004|nomination]] of [[John Kerry]] as the candidate for president and of [[John Edwards]] as the candidate for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].  Kerry made his [[Vietnam War]] experience a prominent theme.  In accepting the nomination, he began his speech with \"I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty.\"\n\nKerry and Edwards faced incumbents [[George W. Bush]] and [[Dick Cheney]] of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] in the [[2004 U.S. presidential election|2004 presidential election]].  Following his official nomination at the Convention, Kerry received only a small [[convention bounce|bounce]] in the polls and remained \"neck and neck\" with Bush.  This was the first time in recent political history that a candidate failed to receive a substantial boost in post-convention poll numbers. Some political pundits attributed this small boost to the unusually small number of undecided voters as compared with previous presidential elections.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Inskeep |first1=Steve |title=Polls: Kerry Got Little Bounce from Boston |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3809479 |website=NPR |accessdate=28 January 2019 |language=en |date=2 August 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe general election was won by Bush, who defeated Kerry.  The election was fought primarily on the issue of the conduct of the [[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]].

SA processes refers to the updating of SA states, and what guides the moment-to-moment change of SA.<ref name=\"Lundberg, 2015\">Lundberg, 2015</ref>\n\n==History==\nAlthough the term itself is fairly recent, the concept has roots in the history of [[military theory]]\u2014it is recognizable in [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'', for example.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The term can be traced to World War I, where it was recognized as a crucial skill for crews in military aircraft.<ref>Press, 1986</ref>\n\nThere is evidence that the term ''situational awareness'' was first employed at the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]] during human factors engineering research while developing vertical and horizontal situation displays and evaluating digital-control placement for the next generation of commercial aircraft.

A. & Stanley, D. L. (1983). The Touch-Sensitive Control/Display Unit:  A promising Computer Interface.  Technical Paper 831532, Aerospace Congress & Exposition, Long Beach, CA: Society of Automotive Engineers.</ref> During the early 1980s, integrated \u201cvertical-situation\u201d and \u201chorizontal-situation\u201d displays were being developed for commercial aircraft to replace multiple electro-mechanical instruments. Integrated situation displays combined the information from several instruments enabling more efficient access to critical flight parameters, thereby improving situational awareness and reducing pilot workload.\n\nBefore being widely adopted by [[human factors]] scientists in the 1990s, the term is said to have been used by [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) fighter aircrew returning from war in [[Korean War|Korea]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].<ref>Watts, 2004</ref> They identified having good SA as the decisive factor in air combat engagements\u2014the \"ace factor\".<ref>Spick, 1988</ref> Survival in a [[dogfight]] was typically a matter of observing the opponent's current move and anticipating his next move a fraction of a second before he could observe and anticipate it himself. USAF pilots also came to equate SA with the \"observe\" and \"orient\" phases of the famous observe-orient-decide-act loop ([[OODA loop]]), or Boyd cycle, as described by the USAF war theorist Col. [[John Boyd (military strategist)|John Boyd]]. In combat, the winning strategy is to \"get inside\" your opponent's OODA loop, not just by making one's own decisions quicker, but also by having better SA than one's opponent, and even changing the situation in ways that the opponent cannot monitor or even comprehend. Losing one's own SA, in contrast, equates to being \"out of the loop\".\n\nClearly, SA has far reaching applications, as it is necessary for individuals and teams to function effectively in their environment. Thus, we are beginning to see SA going beyond the field of aviation to work being conducted in a wide variety of environments. Currently, SA is being studied in such diverse areas as air traffic control, nuclear power plant operation, vehicle operation, and anesthesiology.<ref>Endsley, 1995b</ref><ref>Gaba, Howard & Small, 1995</ref><ref>Collier & Follesf, 1995</ref><ref>Bolstad, 2000</ref><ref>Sollenberger & Stein, 1995</ref>\n\n==Related concepts==\nSeveral cognitive processes related to situation awareness are briefly described in this section. The matrix shown below attempts to illustrate the relationship among some of these concepts.<ref>S.M.

It is the \"so what\" of the data that is perceived.\n\n===Situational assessment===\nIn brief, ''situation awareness'' is viewed as \"a state of knowledge,\" and ''situational assessment'' as \"the processes\" used to achieve that knowledge.  Endsley argues that \"it is important to distinguish the term situation awareness, as a state of knowledge, from the processes used to achieve that state.<ref name=\":2\">Endsley, 1995b, p.&nbsp;36</ref> These processes, which may vary widely among individuals and contexts, will be referred to as situational assessment or the process of achieving, acquiring, or maintaining SA.\" Note that SA is not only produced by the processes of situational assessment, it also drives those same processes in a recurrent fashion. For example, one's current awareness can determine what one pays attention to next and how one interprets the information perceived.<ref>Endsley, 2000</ref>\n\n===Mental models===\nAccurate mental models are one of the prerequisites for achieving SA.<ref>Endsley & Jones, 1997</ref><ref>Sarter & Woods, 1991</ref> A [[mental model]] can be described as a set of well-defined, highly organized yet dynamic knowledge structures developed over time from experience.<ref>Glaser, 1989</ref><ref>Kozlowski, 1998</ref> The volume of available data inherent in complex operational environments can overwhelm the capability of novice decision makers to attend, process, and integrate this information efficiently, resulting in information overload and negatively impacting their SA.<ref>Endsley, 1997</ref> In contrast, experienced decision makers assess and interpret the current situation (Level 1 and 2 SA) and select an appropriate action based on conceptual patterns stored in their [[long-term memory]] as \"mental models\".<ref>Serfaty, MacMillan, Entin, & Entin, 1997</ref> Cues in the environment activate these mental models, which in turn guide their decision making process.\n\n===Sensemaking===\nKlein, Moon, and Hoffman distinguish between situation awareness and [[sensemaking]] as follows:\n<blockquote>...situation awareness is about the knowledge state that's achieved\u2014either knowledge of current data elements, or inferences drawn from these data, or predictions that can be made using these inferences. In contrast, sensemaking is about the process of achieving these kinds of outcomes, the strategies, and the barriers encountered.<ref>Klein, Moon, and Hoffman, 2006</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn brief, sensemaking is viewed more as \"a motivated, continuous effort to understand connections (which can be among people, places, and events) in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively\",<ref>Klein, Moon, and Hoffman, 2006, p.&nbsp;71</ref> rather than the state of [[knowledge]] underlying situation awareness. Endsley points out that as an effortful process, sensemaking is actually considering a subset of the processes used to maintain situation awareness.<ref name=\"Endsley2004\">Endsley, 2004</ref> In the vast majority of the cases, SA is instantaneous and effortless, proceeding from [[pattern recognition (psychology)|pattern recognition]] of key factors in the environment\u2014\"The speed of operations in activities such as sports, driving, flying and air traffic control practically prohibits such conscious deliberation in the majority of cases, but rather reserves it for the exceptions.\" Endsley also points out that sensemaking is backward focused, forming reasons for past events, while situation awareness is typically forward looking, projecting what is likely to happen in order to inform effective decision processes.<ref name=\"Endsley2004\" />\n\n==Theoretical model==\nSA can be described in terms of a holistic framework of SA systems, states, and processes.<ref name=\"Lundberg, 2015\" /> SA descriptions usually focus on one of the three aspects, or on combinations. SA states can be described as:\n\n'''Objects''': Awareness of various objects in the world, and their current status. Objects and their status may be indicative of particular situations (that they are about to occur, that they are ongoing, etc.). Then they are often referred to as cues.\n\n'''Frames''': Awareness of what kind of situation is on-going, e.g. a runway incursion where an aircraft is about to collide with some object on the runway.\n\n'''Implications''': Awareness of objects within frames, of what their current status means in a particular situation. E.g. the implications of the current speed of the aircraft, and the distance to an object on the runway, in a [[runway incursion]] situation. The implications refer to time and space, to an event horizon.\n\n'''Event horizon''': An awareness of plans and events in time and space. It includes an awareness of what has happened (useful for diagnosis, to achieve SA, to frame situations). It also includes prognosis, an awareness of what might happen next. That includes on the one hand an awareness both of what might occur based on diagnosis and the current situation, and on the other hand on an awareness of current plans and intentions.\n\nAll four aspects may drive SA processes. Being aware of the status of particular objects (cues), one might infer that particular situations are on-going, and frame the objects accordingly. The cues then drive re-framing of situations. Having a particular frame, or pre-conception of a situation, this may drive the perception of objects. E.g. having noticed that a landing is about to occur, an Air Traffic Controller will usually look for specific objects in the environment and update the awareness of their status. Further, having realized the implications of objects of their status, this drives the process of what to attend to next. E.g. knowing that a vehicle is approaching a runway where a landing is about to take place, an Air Traffic Controller may monitor its progress. Event horizon awareness may also guide SA, e.g. if one plans to stop the car at a gas station, one may look for gas station signs.\n\nFurther, to describe SA in e.g. teams, the distribution of SA must be considered, e.g. in terms of:\n\n'''Shared SA''': What SA different agents have in common\n\n'''Task SA''': What SA different agents have, that they need to perform their tasks\n\n'''Transactive SA''': Exchange of SA between system parts\n\n'''Buffering SA''': Awareness of different accounts (e.g., different frames) of situations, in various parts of the system.\n\n===Causal models of SA===\n\nA recent holistic framework<ref name=\"CogSci\">{{cite journal | last1 = McAnally | first1 = K. | last2 = Davey | first2 = C. | last3 = White | first3 = D. | last4 = Stimson | first4 = M. | last5 = Mascaro | first5 = S. | last6 = Korb | first6 = K | year = 2018 | title = Inference in the wild: A framework for human situation assessment and a case study of air combat. | url = | journal = [[Cognitive Science (journal)|Cognitive Science]] | volume = 42 | issue = 7| pages = 2181\u20132204 | doi=10.1111/cogs.12636}}</ref> has shown how SA emerges from causal mental models, where beliefs about causal relationships in the world are represented in the structure of the model and beliefs about the state of the world are reflected in the state of the model.

When instantiated as a [[Bayesian network]], these models also allow evaluation of the search for information and the integration of new information with existing knowledge. A computational causal model quantitatively predicted search behavior and changes in SA in fighter pilots.<ref name=\"CogSci\" />\n\n===Endsley's model===\n\nThe SA states framework above extends an older (but simpler), theoretical framework of SA, provided by Dr. Mica Endsley (1995b), which has historically been widely used. Endsley's model describes SA states, and illustrates three stages or steps of SA formation: perception, comprehension, and projection.\n\n'''Perception (Level 1 SA)''': The first step in achieving SA is to perceive the status, attributes, and dynamics of relevant elements in the environment. Thus, Level 1 SA, the most basic level of SA, involves the processes of monitoring, cue detection, and simple recognition, which lead to an awareness of multiple situational elements (objects, events, people, systems, environmental factors) and their current states (locations, conditions, modes, actions).\n\n'''Comprehension (Level 2 SA)''': The next step in SA formation involves a synthesis of disjointed Level 1 SA elements through the processes of pattern recognition, interpretation, and evaluation. Level 2 SA requires integrating this information to understand how it will impact upon the individual's goals and objectives. This includes developing a comprehensive picture of the world, or of that portion of the world of concern to the individual.\n\n'''Projection (Level 3 SA)''': The third and highest level of SA involves the ability to project the future actions of the elements in the environment. Level 3 SA is achieved through knowledge of the status and dynamics of the elements and comprehension of the situation (Levels 1 and 2 SA), and then extrapolating this information forward in time to determine how it will affect future states of the operational environment.\n\nEndsley's model of SA also illustrates several variables that can influence the development and maintenance of SA, including individual, task, and environmental factors. For example, individuals vary in their ability to acquire SA; thus, simply providing the same system and training will not ensure similar SA across different individuals. Endsley's model shows how SA \"provides the primary basis for subsequent decision making and performance in the operation of complex, dynamic systems\" (Endsley, 1995a, p.&nbsp;65). Although alone it cannot guarantee successful decision making, SA does support the necessary input processes (e.g., cue recognition, situation assessment, prediction) upon which good decisions are based (Artman, 2000).\n\n{{Plain image with caption|image=Endsley-SA-model.jpg|width=475|align=none|caption=Endsley's model of SA. This is a synthesis of versions she has given in several sources, notably Endsley (1995a) and Endsley et al (2000). Drawn by Dr. Peter Lankton, May 2007.}}\n\nSA also involves both a temporal and a spatial component. Time is an important concept in SA, as SA is a dynamic construct, changing at a tempo dictated by the actions of individuals, task characteristics, and the surrounding environment. As new inputs enter the system, the individual incorporates them into this mental representation, making changes as necessary in plans and actions in order to achieve the desired goals. SA also involves spatial knowledge about the activities and events occurring in a specific location of interest to the individual. Thus, the concept of SA includes perception, comprehension, and projection of situational information, as well as temporal and spatial components.\n\nIn summary, the model consists of several key factors:\n* [[Perception]], comprehension, and projection as three levels of SA,\n* The role of goals and goal directed processing in directing attention and interpreting the significance of perceived information,\n* The role of information salience in \"grabbing\" attention in a data-driven fashion, and the importance of alternating goal-driven and data-driven processing,\n* The role of expectations (fed by the current model of the situation and by long-term memory stores) in directing attention and interpreting information,\n* The heavy demands on limited working memory restricting SA for novices and for those in novel situations, but the tremendous advantages of mental models and pattern matching to prototypical schema that largely circumvent these limits,\n* The use of mental models for providing a means for integrating different bits of information and comprehending its meaning (relevant to goals) and for allowing people to make useful projections of likely future events and states,\n* Pattern matching to [[Schema (psychology)|schema]]\u2014prototypical states of the [[mental model]]\u2014that provides rapid retrieval of comprehension and projection relevant to the recognized situation and in many cases single-step retrieval of appropriate actions for the situation.\n\nFor a more complete description of the model, see Endsley (1995b) and Endsley (2004). See also Endsley (2000) for a review of other models of SA.\n\n===Criticism of model===\nAny model of situation awareness depends on cognitive and shared cognitive processes, and yet '...models of SA refer to cognitive processes in general terms, but do not specify exactly what processes are involved and to what extent.' (Banbury & Tremblay, 2004, p. xiii). This criticism is an example of the difficulty that cognitive science has in addressing a concept such as SA, which through its definition and assumptions appears to stand robustly, however when the theorized processes are exposed at the cognitive level of analysis assumptions must be radically reviewed. Researchers have regularly raised these concerns - notably in Flach (1995) and more recently in Banbury & Tremblay (2004). To date the most widely cited model of SA is lacking in support from cognitive science, one notable observation that still stands is that:\n\n'The test of situation awareness as a construct will be in its ability to be operationalized in terms of objective, clearly specified independent (stimulus manipulation) and dependent (response difference) variables ... Otherwise, SA will be yet another buzzword to cloak scientists' ignorance.' (Flach, J., 1995, p.&nbsp;155)\n\nAnother criticism of the model comes from a study done in 2015 which looked at situational awareness in tasks where relevant knowledge about the task could be found through other mediums, other than directly asking the collaborator.  It was found that in these types of tasks, verbal communication lengthens the time it takes to complete a task when compared to people completing a task individually.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kozlov|first1=Michail|last2=Engelmann|first2=Tanja|last3=Buder|first3=Jurgen|last4=Hesse|first4=Friedrich W.|title=Is knowledge best shared or given to individuals?

Thus, it is necessary to consider the SA of not just individual team members, but also the SA of the team as a whole. To begin to understand what is needed for SA within teams, it is first necessary to clearly define what constitutes a team. A team is not just any group of individuals; rather teams have a few defining characteristics. As defined by Salas et al. (1992), a team is:\n<blockquote>\"a distinguishable set of two or more people who interact dynamically, interdependently and adaptively toward a common and valued goal/objective/mission, who have each been assigned specific roles or functions to perform, and who have a limited life span of membership.\"</blockquote>\n\n===Team SA===\nTeam SA is defined as \"''the degree to which every team member possesses the SA required for his or her responsibilities''\" (Endsley, 1995b, p.&nbsp;39; see also Endsley, 1989). The success or failure of a team depends on the success or failure of each of its team members. If any one of the team members has poor SA, it can lead to a critical error in performance that can undermine the success of the entire team. By this definition, each team member needs to have a high level of SA on those factors ''that are relevant for his or her job''. It is not sufficient for one member of the team to be aware of critical information if the team member who needs that information is not aware.\n\nIn a team, each member has a subgoal pertinent to his/her specific role that feeds into the overall team goal. Associated with each member's subgoal are a set of SA elements about which he/she is concerned. Team SA, therefore, can be represented as shown in Figure 2. As the members of a team are essentially interdependent in meeting the overall team goal, some overlap between each member's subgoal and their SA requirements will be present. It is this subset of information that constitutes much of team coordination. That coordination may occur as a verbal exchange, a duplication of displayed information, or by some other means.\n\n===Shared SA===\nShared situation awareness can be defined as \"''the degree to which team members possess the same SA on shared SA requirements''\" (Endsley & Jones, 1997, p.&nbsp;47; 2001, p.&nbsp;48). As implied by this definition, there are information requirements that are relevant to multiple team members. A major part of teamwork involves the area where these SA requirements overlap\u2014the shared SA requirements that exist as a function of the essential interdependency of the team members. In a poorly functioning team, two or more members may have different assessments on these shared SA requirements and thus behave in an uncoordinated or even counter-productive fashion. Yet in a smoothly functioning team, each team member shares a common understanding of what is happening on those SA elements that are common\u2014''shared SA''. Thus, shared SA refers to the overlap between the SA requirements of the team members, as presented in Figure 3. As depicted by the clear areas of the figure, not all information needs to be shared. Clearly, each team member is aware of much that is not pertinent to the others on the team. Sharing every detail of each person's job would only create a great deal of \"noise\" to sort through to get needed information.  It is only that information which is relevant to the SA requirements of each team member that is needed.\n\n===Team SA model===\nThe situation awareness of the team as a whole, therefore, is dependent upon both (1) a high level of SA among individual team members for the aspects of the situation necessary for their job; and (2) a high level of shared SA between team members, providing an accurate common operating picture of those aspects of the situation common to the needs of each member (Endsley & Jones, 2001). Endsley and Jones (1997; 2001) describe a model of team situation awareness as a means of conceptualizing how teams develop high levels of shared SA across members. Each of these four factors\u2014requirements, devices, mechanisms and processes\u2014act to help build team and shared SA.\n\n'''''1. Team SA requirements''''' \u2013 the degree to which the team members know which information needs to be shared, including their higher level assessments and projections (which are usually not otherwise available to fellow team members), and information on team members' task status and current capabilities.\n\n'''''2. Team SA devices''''' \u2013 the devices available for sharing this information, which can include direct communication (both verbal and non-verbal), shared displays (e.g., visual or audio displays, or tactile devices), or a shared environment. As non-verbal communication, such as gestures and display of local artifacts, and a shared environment are usually not available in distributed teams, this places far more emphasis on verbal communication and communication technologies for creating shared information displays.\n\n'''''3. Team SA mechanisms''''' \u2013 the degree to which team members possess mechanisms, such as shared mental models, which support their ability to interpret information in the same way and make accurate projections regarding each other's actions. The possession of shared mental models can greatly facilitate communication and coordination in team settings.\n\n'''''4. Team SA processes''''' \u2013 the degree to which team members engage in effective processes for sharing SA information which may include a group norm of questioning assumptions, checking each other for conflicting information or perceptions, setting up coordination and prioritization of tasks, and establishing contingency planning among others.\n\n==In time critical decision-making processes==\n{{see also|Window of opportunity}}\nThere are many industries where it is critical to make a correct decision within a strict time limit, based on the decision-maker's knowledge of the current situation: for example air traffic controllers or medical providers (e.g. anesthesiologists). In these situations it is common that the key [[decision maker]] is supported by other team members or by complex monitoring systems feeding them information, which can involve multiple sources and formats of information. Even in these time-critical situations, the importance of having situation awareness (SA) is not constant: i.e. it is more critical to the outcome to have better SA for non-standard situations, such as points of high information traffic, extraneous activity and unforeseeable events. These \u2018points of fracture\u2019 are likely to cause additional [[workload]] on the individuals and therefore affect their SA and the time to make the decision. At the critical point the perceived situational awareness utilized to make the decision is directly affected by the cognitive workload to gain, comprehend and process the SA that is coming in to the operator, both general background SA and the SA specifically related to the decision. (Smith, K. T. 2013)<ref>Smith, K. T. (2013) Building a human capability decision engine. Contemporary Ergonomics and Human Factors 2013 Proceedings of the international conference on Ergonomics & Human Factors 2013, 395\u2013402 http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/abs/10.1201/b13826-84</ref> In other words, if everything is going OK the level of SA you have is not as critical as it is when something unusual happens or something goes wrong.\n\nResearch into the decision making process is an increasing area of interest and the identification of this type of relationship has led to the development of at least one integrated conceptual framework (developed by K Tara Smith) that attempts to accommodate all of the impactors on the decision-making process, defining how they impact on the individual's ability to acquire their SA. This involves aligning the terms and concepts used by different research areas, so that the causal relationships can be identified and defined.\n\nThis approach of integrating situation awareness, [[workload]], [[signal processing]] theory, [[decision theory]], etc. tends to subtly change the questions that are asked during the analysis process from quantifying and qualifying the SA to measures of the probabilistic aspects of a decision, such as the number of interrelationships, the certainty and time-lag of the information arriving, risk to desired outcome or effect, etc., together with the processing aspects, to do with the number of signals, accuracy and completeness of the information and importance to the operational context. In other words, instead of asking does a modification to the system provide more SA, we are asking does this modification to the system provide more SA in a form that can be used at the time when it is needed?\n\n==Measurement==\nWhile the SA construct has been widely researched, the multivariate nature of SA poses a considerable challenge to its quantification and measurement (for a detailed discussion on SA measurement, see Endsley & Garland, 2000; Fracker, 1991a; 1991b). In general, techniques vary in terms of ''direct'' measurement of SA (e.g., objective real-time probes or subjective questionnaires assessing perceived SA) or methods that ''infer'' SA based on operator behavior or performance. Direct measures are typically considered to be \"product-oriented\" in that these techniques assess an SA outcome; inferred measures are considered to be \"process-oriented,\" focusing on the underlying processes or mechanisms required to achieve SA (Graham & Matthews, 2000). These SA measurement approaches are further described next.\n\n===Objective measures===\n''Objective measures'' directly assess SA by comparing an individual's perceptions of the situation or environment to some \"ground truth\" reality. Specifically, objective measures collect data from the individual on his or her perceptions of the situation and compare them to what is actually happening to score the accuracy of their SA at a given moment in time. Thus, this type of assessment provides a direct measure of SA and does not require operators or observers to make judgments about situational knowledge on the basis of incomplete information. Objective measures can be gathered in one of three ways: real-time as the task is completed (e.g., \"real-time probes\" presented as open questions embedded as verbal communications during the task \u2013 Jones & Endsley, 2000), during an interruption in task performance (e.g., ''situation awareness global assessment technique'' (SAGAT) \u2013 Endsley, 1995a, or the ''WOMBAT situational awareness and stress tolerance test'' mostly used in aviation since the late 1980s and often called HUPEX in Europe), or post-test following completion of the task.\n\n===Subjective measures===\n''Subjective measures'' directly assess SA by asking individuals to rate their own or the observed SA of individuals on an anchored scale (e.g., ''participant situation awareness questionnaire'' (PSAQ) \u2013 Strater, Endsley, Pleban, & Matthews, 2001; the ''situation awareness rating technique'' (SART) \u2013 Taylor, 1989). Subjective measures of SA are attractive in that they are relatively straightforward and easy to administer.  However, several limitations should be noted. Individuals making subjective assessments of their own SA are often unaware of information they do not know (the \"[[unknown unknowns]]\"). Subjective measures also tend to be global in nature, and, as such, do not fully exploit the multivariate nature of SA to provide the detailed diagnostics available with objective measures. Nevertheless, self-ratings may be useful in that they can provide an assessment of operators' degree of ''confidence'' in their SA and their own performance. Measuring how SA is ''perceived'' by the operator may provide information as important as the operator's ''actual'' SA, since errors in perceived SA quality (over-confidence or under-confidence in SA) may have just as harmful an effect on an individual's or team's decision-making as errors in their actual SA (Endsley, 1998).\n\nSubjective estimates of an individual's SA may also be made by experienced observers (e.g., peers, commanders, or trained external experts). These observer ratings may be somewhat superior to self-ratings of SA because more information about the true state of the environment is usually available to the observer than to the operator, who may be focused on performing the task (i.e., trained observers may have more complete knowledge of the situation). However, observers have only limited knowledge about the operator's concept of the situation and cannot have complete insight into the mental state of the individual being evaluated. Thus, observers are forced to rely more on operators' ''observable'' actions and verbalizations in order to infer their level of SA. In this case, such actions and verbalizations are best assessed using ''performance'' and ''behavioral'' measures of SA, as described next.\n\n===Performance and behavioral measures===\n''Performance measures'' \"infer\" SA from the end result (i.e., task performance outcomes), based on the assumption that better performance indicates better SA. Common performance metrics include quantity of output or productivity level, time to perform the task or respond to an event, and the accuracy of the response or, conversely, the number of errors committed. The main advantage of performance measures is that these can be collected objectively and without disrupting task performance. However, although evidence exists to suggest a positive relation between SA and performance, this connection is probabilistic and not always direct and unequivocal (Endsley, 1995b). In other words, good SA does not always lead to good performance and poor SA does not always lead to poor performance (Endsley, 1990). Thus, performance measures should be used in conjunction with others measures of SA that directly assess this construct.\n\n''Behavioral measures'' also \"infer\" SA from the actions that individuals choose to take, based on the assumption that good actions will follow from good SA and vice versa. Behavioral measures rely primarily on observer ratings, and are, thus, somewhat subjective in nature. To address this limitation, observers can be asked to evaluate the degree to which individuals are carrying out actions and exhibiting behaviors that would be expected to promote the achievement of higher levels of SA (see, for example, the ''situation awareness behaviorally anchored rating scale'' (SABARS) \u2013 Matthews, Pleban, Endsley, & Strater, 2000; Strater et al., 2001). This approach removes some of the subjectivity associated with making judgments about an individual's internal state of knowledge by allowing them to make judgments about SA indicators that are more readily observable.\n\n===Process indices===\n''Process indices'' examine how individuals process information in their environment, such as by analyzing communication patterns between team members or using eye tracking devices. Team communication (particularly verbal communication) supports the knowledge building and information processing that leads to SA construction (Endsley & Jones, 1997). Thus, since SA may be distributed via communication, computational linguistics and machine learning techniques can be combined with natural language analytical techniques (e.g., Latent Semantic Analysis) to create models that draw on the verbal expressions of the team to predict SA and task performance (Bolstad, Cuevas, Gonzalez, & Schneider, 2005; Bolstad, Foltz, Franzke, Cuevas, Rosenstein, & Costello, 2007). Although evidence exists to support the utility of communication analysis for predicting team SA (Foltz, Bolstad, Cuevas, Franzke, Rosenstein, & Costello, in press), time constraints and technological limitations (e.g., cost and availability of speech recording systems and speech-to-text translation software) may make this approach less practical and viable in time-pressured, fast-paced operations.\n\nPsycho-physiological measures also serve as process indices of operator SA by providing an assessment of the relationship between human performance and a corrected change in the operator's physiology (e.g., French, Clark, Pomeroy, Seymour, & Clarke, 2007). In other words, cognitive activity is associated with changes in the operator's physiological states. For example, the operator's overall functional state (as assessed using psycho-physiological measures, such as electroencephalographic ([[EEG]]) data, eyeblinks, and cardiac activity) may provide an indication as to whether the operator is sleep fatigued at one end of the continuum, or mentally overloaded at the other end (Wilson, 2000). Other psycho-physiological measures, such as event related potentials (ERP), event related desynchronization (ERD), transient heart rate (HR), and electrodermal activity (EDA), may be useful for evaluating an operator's perception of critical environmental cues, that is, to determine if the operator has detected and perceived a task-relevant stimulus (Wilson, 2000). In addition, it is also possible to use psycho-physiological measures to monitor operators' environmental expectancies, that is, their physiological responses to upcoming events, as a measure of their current level of SA (Wilson, 2000).\n\n===Multi-faceted approach to measurement===\nThe multivariate nature of SA significantly complicates its quantification and measurement, as it is conceivable that a metric may only tap into one aspect of the operator's SA. Further, studies have shown that different types of SA measures do not always correlate strongly with each other (cf. Durso, Truitt, Hackworth, Crutchfield, Nikolic, Moertl, Ohrt, & Manning, 1995; Endsley, Selcon, Hardiman, & Croft, 1998; Vidulich, 2000). Accordingly, rather than rely on a single approach or metric, valid and reliable measurement of SA should utilize a battery of distinct yet related measures that complement each other (e.g., Harwood, Barnett, & Wickens, 1988). Such a multi-faced approach to SA measurement capitalizes on the strengths of each measure while minimizing the limitations inherent in each.\n\n==Training==\nFollowing Endsley's paradigm and with ''cognitive resource management'' model<ref>Simmon, D.A.

Situational awareness is achieved by developing and using solutions that often consume data and information from many different sources. Technology and algorithms are then used to apply knowledge and wisdom in order to discern patterns of behavior that point to possible, probable, and real threats.\n\nSituational awareness for cybersecurity threat operations teams appears in the form of a condensed, enriched, often graphical, prioritized, and easily searchable view of systems that are inside or related to security areas of responsibility (such as corporate networks or those used for national security interests).

[[Cloud computing|Cloud]]-based [[Geographic information system|G.I.S.]] display of structured data ===\nSince 2012 the [http://www.nisconsortium.org National Information Sharing Consortium] (NISC) has worked to provide \"the right information to the right people at the right time\" by use of [[Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events|common terminology]] among the [[emergency management]] community and [[First responder|first-responders]] with a mission of standardizing the structured [[Geographic data and information|geo-spatial data]] to be shared online over a variety of platforms. The result is to create a Common Operating Picture (COP) that generates accurate and timely information displayed visually, both at the strategic level for decision makers and at the tactical level for people on site. The NISC promotes the sharing of code, data widgets, and training in order to increase the quality of the situational awareness. Large scale exercises like the [https://web.archive.org/web/20170203164143/http://www.cusec.org/plans-a-programs/capstone14/173 Capstone-14] week-long event coordinated by the [http://www.cusec.org Central United States Earthquake Consortium] (CUSEC) and actual operational use of these [[data sharing]] methods have also advanced the work of NISC to expand the usability of GIS-based information sharing for enhanced situational awareness.\n\n=== Military training methods ===\nThere are two training scenarios designed to increase the situational awareness skills of military professionals, and first responders in police and emergency services. The first, [[Kim's Game]], has a more common place in the Marine Corps sniper school and police academies. The name is derived from the novel [[Kim (novel)|Kim]] which references the game to a spy school lesson. The game involves a tray with various items such as spoons, pencils, bullets, and any other items the soldiers would be familiar with. The participants are given one minute to view all of these items before they are covered up with a blanket. The participants would then individually list the items that they saw, the one with the most correct answers would win the game.<ref name=\"The Prepping Guide\">{{Cite news|url=https://thepreppingguide.com/situational-awareness/|title=Situational Awareness: How You Can Master Survival, Work and Life|date=2017-09-13|work=The Prepping Guide|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en-US}}</ref> The same game is played in young scouting and girl guide groups as well to teach children quick memorisation skills.\n\nThe second method is a more practical military application of Kim's Game. It starts with a field area (jungle, bush or forest) of about five meters wide to 10 meters deep where various items, some camouflaged and some not, to be located in the area on the ground and in the trees at eyesight level. Again, these items would be ones that are familiar to the soldiers undergoing the exercise. The participants would be given 10 minutes to view the area from one place and take a mental note of the items they saw. Once their 10 minutes is up, the soldier would then be required to do a repetition of certain exercises such as [[Burpee (exercise)|burpees]], designed to simulate the stress of a physically demanding environment. Once the participant completes the exercise, they would list the items they saw. The points would be tallied in the end to find the winner.<ref name=\"The Prepping Guide\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=}}\n* {{annotated link|Alert state}}\n* {{annotated link|Aviation safety}}\n* {{annotated link|Brownout (aeronautics)}}\n* {{annotated link|Decision-making}}\n* {{annotated link|Diving safety}}\n* {{annotated link|Information integration}}\n* {{annotated link|Korean Air Lines Flight 007}}\n* {{annotated link|Self-awareness}}\n* {{annotated link|Situated cognition}}\n* {{annotated link|Situation room}}\n* {{annotated link|Spatial awareness}}\n* {{annotated link|Spatial disorientation}}\n* {{annotated link|Single-pilot resource management}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Notes===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* FDSE's COP Page [http://www.situational-awareness-systems.com/?itemCategory=33355&siteid=297&priorId=33350]\n* Adam, E.C.

SA states refers to the actual awareness of the situation. SA systems refers to the distribution of SA in teams and between objects in the environment, and to the exchange of SA between system parts. SA processes refers to the updating of SA states, and what guides the moment-to-moment change of SA.<ref name=\"Lundberg, 2015\">Lundberg, 2015</ref>\n\n==History==\nAlthough the term itself is fairly recent, the concept has roots in the history of [[military theory]]\u2014it is recognizable in [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'', for example.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The term can be traced to World War I, where it was recognized as a crucial skill for crews in military aircraft.<ref>Press, 1986</ref>\n\nThere is evidence that the term ''situational awareness'' was first employed at the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]] during human factors engineering research while developing vertical and horizontal situation displays and evaluating digital-control placement for the next generation of commercial aircraft. Research programs in flight-crew computer interaction<ref>Biferno, M.A. \"Flight Crew Computer Interaction\", [[Douglas Aircraft Company]], Internal Research and Development. Long Beach, CA.</ref> and mental workload measurement <ref>Biferno, M.A., \"Mental Workload Measurement\", Douglas Aircraft Company, Internal Research and Development, Long Beach, CA.</ref> built on the concept of awareness measurement from a series of experiments that measured contingency awareness during learning,<ref>Dawson, M.E., Biferno, M.A. (1973). \"Concurrent measurement of awareness and electrodermal classical conditioning\", ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology]]', 101, 55-62.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Biferno | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Dawson | first2 = M.E. | year = 1977 | title = The onset of contingency awareness and electrodermal classical conditioning: An analysis of temporal relationships during acquisition and extinction | url = | journal = [[Psychophysiology (journal)|Psychophysiology]] | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 164\u2013171 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.1977.tb03370.x}}</ref> and later extended to mental workload and fatigue.<ref>Biferno, M.A. (1985). \"Relationship between event-related potential components and ratings of workload and fatigue\", NASA-Ames, Moffett Field, CA, NASA contract report 177354.</ref>\n\nSituation awareness appears in the technical literature as early as 1983, when describing the benefits of a prototype touch-screen navigation display.<ref>Biferno, M. A. & Stanley, D. L. (1983). The Touch-Sensitive Control/Display Unit:  A promising Computer Interface.  Technical Paper 831532, Aerospace Congress & Exposition, Long Beach, CA: Society of Automotive Engineers.</ref> During the early 1980s, integrated \u201cvertical-situation\u201d and \u201chorizontal-situation\u201d displays were being developed for commercial aircraft to replace multiple electro-mechanical instruments. Integrated situation displays combined the information from several instruments enabling more efficient access to critical flight parameters, thereby improving situational awareness and reducing pilot workload.\n\nBefore being widely adopted by [[human factors]] scientists in the 1990s, the term is said to have been used by [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) fighter aircrew returning from war in [[Korean War|Korea]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].<ref>Watts, 2004</ref> They identified having good SA as the decisive factor in air combat engagements\u2014the \"ace factor\".<ref>Spick, 1988</ref> Survival in a [[dogfight]] was typically a matter of observing the opponent's current move and anticipating his next move a fraction of a second before he could observe and anticipate it himself. USAF pilots also came to equate SA with the \"observe\" and \"orient\" phases of the famous observe-orient-decide-act loop ([[OODA loop]]), or Boyd cycle, as described by the USAF war theorist Col. [[John Boyd (military strategist)|John Boyd]]. In combat, the winning strategy is to \"get inside\" your opponent's OODA loop, not just by making one's own decisions quicker, but also by having better SA than one's opponent, and even changing the situation in ways that the opponent cannot monitor or even comprehend. Losing one's own SA, in contrast, equates to being \"out of the loop\".\n\nClearly, SA has far reaching applications, as it is necessary for individuals and teams to function effectively in their environment. Thus, we are beginning to see SA going beyond the field of aviation to work being conducted in a wide variety of environments. Currently, SA is being studied in such diverse areas as air traffic control, nuclear power plant operation, vehicle operation, and anesthesiology.<ref>Endsley, 1995b</ref><ref>Gaba, Howard & Small, 1995</ref><ref>Collier & Follesf, 1995</ref><ref>Bolstad, 2000</ref><ref>Sollenberger & Stein, 1995</ref>\n\n==Related concepts==\nSeveral cognitive processes related to situation awareness are briefly described in this section. The matrix shown below attempts to illustrate the relationship among some of these concepts.<ref>S.M. Fiore, personal communication, November 6, 2007</ref> Note that ''situation awareness'' and ''situational assessment'' are more commonly discussed in information fusion complex domains such as aviation and military operations and relate more to achieving immediate tactical objectives.<ref>Blasch, E., Bosse, E., and Lambert, D.

It is the \"so what\" of the data that is perceived.\n\n===Situational assessment===\nIn brief, ''situation awareness'' is viewed as \"a state of knowledge,\" and ''situational assessment'' as \"the processes\" used to achieve that knowledge.  Endsley argues that \"it is important to distinguish the term situation awareness, as a state of knowledge, from the processes used to achieve that state.<ref name=\":2\">Endsley, 1995b, p.&nbsp;36</ref> These processes, which may vary widely among individuals and contexts, will be referred to as situational assessment or the process of achieving, acquiring, or maintaining SA.\" Note that SA is not only produced by the processes of situational assessment, it also drives those same processes in a recurrent fashion. For example, one's current awareness can determine what one pays attention to next and how one interprets the information perceived.<ref>Endsley, 2000</ref>\n\n===Mental models===\nAccurate mental models are one of the prerequisites for achieving SA.<ref>Endsley & Jones, 1997</ref><ref>Sarter & Woods, 1991</ref> A [[mental model]] can be described as a set of well-defined, highly organized yet dynamic knowledge structures developed over time from experience.<ref>Glaser, 1989</ref><ref>Kozlowski, 1998</ref> The volume of available data inherent in complex operational environments can overwhelm the capability of novice decision makers to attend, process, and integrate this information efficiently, resulting in information overload and negatively impacting their SA.<ref>Endsley, 1997</ref> In contrast, experienced decision makers assess and interpret the current situation (Level 1 and 2 SA) and select an appropriate action based on conceptual patterns stored in their [[long-term memory]] as \"mental models\".<ref>Serfaty, MacMillan, Entin, & Entin, 1997</ref> Cues in the environment activate these mental models, which in turn guide their decision making process.\n\n===Sensemaking===\nKlein, Moon, and Hoffman distinguish between situation awareness and [[sensemaking]] as follows:\n<blockquote>...situation awareness is about the knowledge state that's achieved\u2014either knowledge of current data elements, or inferences drawn from these data, or predictions that can be made using these inferences. In contrast, sensemaking is about the process of achieving these kinds of outcomes, the strategies, and the barriers encountered.<ref>Klein, Moon, and Hoffman, 2006</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn brief, sensemaking is viewed more as \"a motivated, continuous effort to understand connections (which can be among people, places, and events) in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively\",<ref>Klein, Moon, and Hoffman, 2006, p.&nbsp;71</ref> rather than the state of [[knowledge]] underlying situation awareness. Endsley points out that as an effortful process, sensemaking is actually considering a subset of the processes used to maintain situation awareness.<ref name=\"Endsley2004\">Endsley, 2004</ref> In the vast majority of the cases, SA is instantaneous and effortless, proceeding from [[pattern recognition (psychology)|pattern recognition]] of key factors in the environment\u2014\"The speed of operations in activities such as sports, driving, flying and air traffic control practically prohibits such conscious deliberation in the majority of cases, but rather reserves it for the exceptions.\" Endsley also points out that sensemaking is backward focused, forming reasons for past events, while situation awareness is typically forward looking, projecting what is likely to happen in order to inform effective decision processes.<ref name=\"Endsley2004\" />\n\n==Theoretical model==\nSA can be described in terms of a holistic framework of SA systems, states, and processes.<ref name=\"Lundberg, 2015\" /> SA descriptions usually focus on one of the three aspects, or on combinations. SA states can be described as:\n\n'''Objects''': Awareness of various objects in the world, and their current status. Objects and their status may be indicative of particular situations (that they are about to occur, that they are ongoing, etc.). Then they are often referred to as cues.\n\n'''Frames''': Awareness of what kind of situation is on-going, e.g. a runway incursion where an aircraft is about to collide with some object on the runway.\n\n'''Implications''': Awareness of objects within frames, of what their current status means in a particular situation. E.g. the implications of the current speed of the aircraft, and the distance to an object on the runway, in a [[runway incursion]] situation. The implications refer to time and space, to an event horizon.\n\n'''Event horizon''': An awareness of plans and events in time and space. It includes an awareness of what has happened (useful for diagnosis, to achieve SA, to frame situations). It also includes prognosis, an awareness of what might happen next. That includes on the one hand an awareness both of what might occur based on diagnosis and the current situation, and on the other hand on an awareness of current plans and intentions.\n\nAll four aspects may drive SA processes. Being aware of the status of particular objects (cues), one might infer that particular situations are on-going, and frame the objects accordingly. The cues then drive re-framing of situations. Having a particular frame, or pre-conception of a situation, this may drive the perception of objects. E.g. having noticed that a landing is about to occur, an Air Traffic Controller will usually look for specific objects in the environment and update the awareness of their status. Further, having realized the implications of objects of their status, this drives the process of what to attend to next. E.g. knowing that a vehicle is approaching a runway where a landing is about to take place, an Air Traffic Controller may monitor its progress. Event horizon awareness may also guide SA, e.g. if one plans to stop the car at a gas station, one may look for gas station signs.\n\nFurther, to describe SA in e.g. teams, the distribution of SA must be considered, e.g. in terms of:\n\n'''Shared SA''': What SA different agents have in common\n\n'''Task SA''': What SA different agents have, that they need to perform their tasks\n\n'''Transactive SA''': Exchange of SA between system parts\n\n'''Buffering SA''': Awareness of different accounts (e.g., different frames) of situations, in various parts of the system.\n\n===Causal models of SA===\n\nA recent holistic framework<ref name=\"CogSci\">{{cite journal | last1 = McAnally | first1 = K. | last2 = Davey | first2 = C. | last3 = White | first3 = D. | last4 = Stimson | first4 = M. | last5 = Mascaro | first5 = S. | last6 = Korb | first6 = K | year = 2018 | title = Inference in the wild: A framework for human situation assessment and a case study of air combat. | url = | journal = [[Cognitive Science (journal)|Cognitive Science]] | volume = 42 | issue = 7| pages = 2181\u20132204 | doi=10.1111/cogs.12636}}</ref> has shown how SA emerges from causal mental models, where beliefs about causal relationships in the world are represented in the structure of the model and beliefs about the state of the world are reflected in the state of the model.

When instantiated as a [[Bayesian network]], these models also allow evaluation of the search for information and the integration of new information with existing knowledge. A computational causal model quantitatively predicted search behavior and changes in SA in fighter pilots.<ref name=\"CogSci\" />\n\n===Endsley's model===\n\nThe SA states framework above extends an older (but simpler), theoretical framework of SA, provided by Dr. Mica Endsley (1995b), which has historically been widely used. Endsley's model describes SA states, and illustrates three stages or steps of SA formation: perception, comprehension, and projection.\n\n'''Perception (Level 1 SA)''': The first step in achieving SA is to perceive the status, attributes, and dynamics of relevant elements in the environment. Thus, Level 1 SA, the most basic level of SA, involves the processes of monitoring, cue detection, and simple recognition, which lead to an awareness of multiple situational elements (objects, events, people, systems, environmental factors) and their current states (locations, conditions, modes, actions).\n\n'''Comprehension (Level 2 SA)''': The next step in SA formation involves a synthesis of disjointed Level 1 SA elements through the processes of pattern recognition, interpretation, and evaluation. Level 2 SA requires integrating this information to understand how it will impact upon the individual's goals and objectives. This includes developing a comprehensive picture of the world, or of that portion of the world of concern to the individual.\n\n'''Projection (Level 3 SA)''': The third and highest level of SA involves the ability to project the future actions of the elements in the environment. Level 3 SA is achieved through knowledge of the status and dynamics of the elements and comprehension of the situation (Levels 1 and 2 SA), and then extrapolating this information forward in time to determine how it will affect future states of the operational environment.\n\nEndsley's model of SA also illustrates several variables that can influence the development and maintenance of SA, including individual, task, and environmental factors. For example, individuals vary in their ability to acquire SA; thus, simply providing the same system and training will not ensure similar SA across different individuals. Endsley's model shows how SA \"provides the primary basis for subsequent decision making and performance in the operation of complex, dynamic systems\" (Endsley, 1995a, p.&nbsp;65). Although alone it cannot guarantee successful decision making, SA does support the necessary input processes (e.g., cue recognition, situation assessment, prediction) upon which good decisions are based (Artman, 2000).\n\n{{Plain image with caption|image=Endsley-SA-model.jpg|width=475|align=none|caption=Endsley's model of SA. This is a synthesis of versions she has given in several sources, notably Endsley (1995a) and Endsley et al (2000). Drawn by Dr. Peter Lankton, May 2007.}}\n\nSA also involves both a temporal and a spatial component. Time is an important concept in SA, as SA is a dynamic construct, changing at a tempo dictated by the actions of individuals, task characteristics, and the surrounding environment. As new inputs enter the system, the individual incorporates them into this mental representation, making changes as necessary in plans and actions in order to achieve the desired goals. SA also involves spatial knowledge about the activities and events occurring in a specific location of interest to the individual. Thus, the concept of SA includes perception, comprehension, and projection of situational information, as well as temporal and spatial components.\n\nIn summary, the model consists of several key factors:\n* [[Perception]], comprehension, and projection as three levels of SA,\n* The role of goals and goal directed processing in directing attention and interpreting the significance of perceived information,\n* The role of information salience in \"grabbing\" attention in a data-driven fashion, and the importance of alternating goal-driven and data-driven processing,\n* The role of expectations (fed by the current model of the situation and by long-term memory stores) in directing attention and interpreting information,\n* The heavy demands on limited working memory restricting SA for novices and for those in novel situations, but the tremendous advantages of mental models and pattern matching to prototypical schema that largely circumvent these limits,\n* The use of mental models for providing a means for integrating different bits of information and comprehending its meaning (relevant to goals) and for allowing people to make useful projections of likely future events and states,\n* Pattern matching to [[Schema (psychology)|schema]]\u2014prototypical states of the [[mental model]]\u2014that provides rapid retrieval of comprehension and projection relevant to the recognized situation and in many cases single-step retrieval of appropriate actions for the situation.\n\nFor a more complete description of the model, see Endsley (1995b) and Endsley (2004). See also Endsley (2000) for a review of other models of SA.\n\n===Criticism of model===\nAny model of situation awareness depends on cognitive and shared cognitive processes, and yet '...models of SA refer to cognitive processes in general terms, but do not specify exactly what processes are involved and to what extent.' (Banbury & Tremblay, 2004, p. xiii). This criticism is an example of the difficulty that cognitive science has in addressing a concept such as SA, which through its definition and assumptions appears to stand robustly, however when the theorized processes are exposed at the cognitive level of analysis assumptions must be radically reviewed. Researchers have regularly raised these concerns - notably in Flach (1995) and more recently in Banbury & Tremblay (2004). To date the most widely cited model of SA is lacking in support from cognitive science, one notable observation that still stands is that:\n\n'The test of situation awareness as a construct will be in its ability to be operationalized in terms of objective, clearly specified independent (stimulus manipulation) and dependent (response difference) variables ... Otherwise, SA will be yet another buzzword to cloak scientists' ignorance.' (Flach, J., 1995, p.&nbsp;155)\n\nAnother criticism of the model comes from a study done in 2015 which looked at situational awareness in tasks where relevant knowledge about the task could be found through other mediums, other than directly asking the collaborator.  It was found that in these types of tasks, verbal communication lengthens the time it takes to complete a task when compared to people completing a task individually.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kozlov|first1=Michail|last2=Engelmann|first2=Tanja|last3=Buder|first3=Jurgen|last4=Hesse|first4=Friedrich W.|title=Is knowledge best shared or given to individuals?

Thus, it is necessary to consider the SA of not just individual team members, but also the SA of the team as a whole. To begin to understand what is needed for SA within teams, it is first necessary to clearly define what constitutes a team. A team is not just any group of individuals; rather teams have a few defining characteristics. As defined by Salas et al. (1992), a team is:\n<blockquote>\"a distinguishable set of two or more people who interact dynamically, interdependently and adaptively toward a common and valued goal/objective/mission, who have each been assigned specific roles or functions to perform, and who have a limited life span of membership.\"</blockquote>\n\n===Team SA===\nTeam SA is defined as \"''the degree to which every team member possesses the SA required for his or her responsibilities''\" (Endsley, 1995b, p.&nbsp;39; see also Endsley, 1989). The success or failure of a team depends on the success or failure of each of its team members. If any one of the team members has poor SA, it can lead to a critical error in performance that can undermine the success of the entire team. By this definition, each team member needs to have a high level of SA on those factors ''that are relevant for his or her job''. It is not sufficient for one member of the team to be aware of critical information if the team member who needs that information is not aware.\n\nIn a team, each member has a subgoal pertinent to his/her specific role that feeds into the overall team goal. Associated with each member's subgoal are a set of SA elements about which he/she is concerned. Team SA, therefore, can be represented as shown in Figure 2. As the members of a team are essentially interdependent in meeting the overall team goal, some overlap between each member's subgoal and their SA requirements will be present. It is this subset of information that constitutes much of team coordination. That coordination may occur as a verbal exchange, a duplication of displayed information, or by some other means.\n\n===Shared SA===\nShared situation awareness can be defined as \"''the degree to which team members possess the same SA on shared SA requirements''\" (Endsley & Jones, 1997, p.&nbsp;47; 2001, p.&nbsp;48). As implied by this definition, there are information requirements that are relevant to multiple team members. A major part of teamwork involves the area where these SA requirements overlap\u2014the shared SA requirements that exist as a function of the essential interdependency of the team members. In a poorly functioning team, two or more members may have different assessments on these shared SA requirements and thus behave in an uncoordinated or even counter-productive fashion. Yet in a smoothly functioning team, each team member shares a common understanding of what is happening on those SA elements that are common\u2014''shared SA''. Thus, shared SA refers to the overlap between the SA requirements of the team members, as presented in Figure 3. As depicted by the clear areas of the figure, not all information needs to be shared. Clearly, each team member is aware of much that is not pertinent to the others on the team. Sharing every detail of each person's job would only create a great deal of \"noise\" to sort through to get needed information.  It is only that information which is relevant to the SA requirements of each team member that is needed.\n\n===Team SA model===\nThe situation awareness of the team as a whole, therefore, is dependent upon both (1) a high level of SA among individual team members for the aspects of the situation necessary for their job; and (2) a high level of shared SA between team members, providing an accurate common operating picture of those aspects of the situation common to the needs of each member (Endsley & Jones, 2001). Endsley and Jones (1997; 2001) describe a model of team situation awareness as a means of conceptualizing how teams develop high levels of shared SA across members. Each of these four factors\u2014requirements, devices, mechanisms and processes\u2014act to help build team and shared SA.\n\n'''''1. Team SA requirements''''' \u2013 the degree to which the team members know which information needs to be shared, including their higher level assessments and projections (which are usually not otherwise available to fellow team members), and information on team members' task status and current capabilities.\n\n'''''2. Team SA devices''''' \u2013 the devices available for sharing this information, which can include direct communication (both verbal and non-verbal), shared displays (e.g., visual or audio displays, or tactile devices), or a shared environment. As non-verbal communication, such as gestures and display of local artifacts, and a shared environment are usually not available in distributed teams, this places far more emphasis on verbal communication and communication technologies for creating shared information displays.\n\n'''''3. Team SA mechanisms''''' \u2013 the degree to which team members possess mechanisms, such as shared mental models, which support their ability to interpret information in the same way and make accurate projections regarding each other's actions. The possession of shared mental models can greatly facilitate communication and coordination in team settings.\n\n'''''4. Team SA processes''''' \u2013 the degree to which team members engage in effective processes for sharing SA information which may include a group norm of questioning assumptions, checking each other for conflicting information or perceptions, setting up coordination and prioritization of tasks, and establishing contingency planning among others.\n\n==In time critical decision-making processes==\n{{see also|Window of opportunity}}\nThere are many industries where it is critical to make a correct decision within a strict time limit, based on the decision-maker's knowledge of the current situation: for example air traffic controllers or medical providers (e.g. anesthesiologists). In these situations it is common that the key [[decision maker]] is supported by other team members or by complex monitoring systems feeding them information, which can involve multiple sources and formats of information. Even in these time-critical situations, the importance of having situation awareness (SA) is not constant: i.e. it is more critical to the outcome to have better SA for non-standard situations, such as points of high information traffic, extraneous activity and unforeseeable events. These \u2018points of fracture\u2019 are likely to cause additional [[workload]] on the individuals and therefore affect their SA and the time to make the decision. At the critical point the perceived situational awareness utilized to make the decision is directly affected by the cognitive workload to gain, comprehend and process the SA that is coming in to the operator, both general background SA and the SA specifically related to the decision. (Smith, K. T. 2013)<ref>Smith, K. T. (2013) Building a human capability decision engine. Contemporary Ergonomics and Human Factors 2013 Proceedings of the international conference on Ergonomics & Human Factors 2013, 395\u2013402 http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/abs/10.1201/b13826-84</ref> In other words, if everything is going OK the level of SA you have is not as critical as it is when something unusual happens or something goes wrong.\n\nResearch into the decision making process is an increasing area of interest and the identification of this type of relationship has led to the development of at least one integrated conceptual framework (developed by K Tara Smith) that attempts to accommodate all of the impactors on the decision-making process, defining how they impact on the individual's ability to acquire their SA. This involves aligning the terms and concepts used by different research areas, so that the causal relationships can be identified and defined.\n\nThis approach of integrating situation awareness, [[workload]], [[signal processing]] theory, [[decision theory]], etc. tends to subtly change the questions that are asked during the analysis process from quantifying and qualifying the SA to measures of the probabilistic aspects of a decision, such as the number of interrelationships, the certainty and time-lag of the information arriving, risk to desired outcome or effect, etc., together with the processing aspects, to do with the number of signals, accuracy and completeness of the information and importance to the operational context. In other words, instead of asking does a modification to the system provide more SA, we are asking does this modification to the system provide more SA in a form that can be used at the time when it is needed?\n\n==Measurement==\nWhile the SA construct has been widely researched, the multivariate nature of SA poses a considerable challenge to its quantification and measurement (for a detailed discussion on SA measurement, see Endsley & Garland, 2000; Fracker, 1991a; 1991b). In general, techniques vary in terms of ''direct'' measurement of SA (e.g., objective real-time probes or subjective questionnaires assessing perceived SA) or methods that ''infer'' SA based on operator behavior or performance. Direct measures are typically considered to be \"product-oriented\" in that these techniques assess an SA outcome; inferred measures are considered to be \"process-oriented,\" focusing on the underlying processes or mechanisms required to achieve SA (Graham & Matthews, 2000). These SA measurement approaches are further described next.\n\n===Objective measures===\n''Objective measures'' directly assess SA by comparing an individual's perceptions of the situation or environment to some \"ground truth\" reality. Specifically, objective measures collect data from the individual on his or her perceptions of the situation and compare them to what is actually happening to score the accuracy of their SA at a given moment in time. Thus, this type of assessment provides a direct measure of SA and does not require operators or observers to make judgments about situational knowledge on the basis of incomplete information. Objective measures can be gathered in one of three ways: real-time as the task is completed (e.g., \"real-time probes\" presented as open questions embedded as verbal communications during the task \u2013 Jones & Endsley, 2000), during an interruption in task performance (e.g., ''situation awareness global assessment technique'' (SAGAT) \u2013 Endsley, 1995a, or the ''WOMBAT situational awareness and stress tolerance test'' mostly used in aviation since the late 1980s and often called HUPEX in Europe), or post-test following completion of the task.\n\n===Subjective measures===\n''Subjective measures'' directly assess SA by asking individuals to rate their own or the observed SA of individuals on an anchored scale (e.g., ''participant situation awareness questionnaire'' (PSAQ) \u2013 Strater, Endsley, Pleban, & Matthews, 2001; the ''situation awareness rating technique'' (SART) \u2013 Taylor, 1989). Subjective measures of SA are attractive in that they are relatively straightforward and easy to administer.  However, several limitations should be noted. Individuals making subjective assessments of their own SA are often unaware of information they do not know (the \"[[unknown unknowns]]\"). Subjective measures also tend to be global in nature, and, as such, do not fully exploit the multivariate nature of SA to provide the detailed diagnostics available with objective measures. Nevertheless, self-ratings may be useful in that they can provide an assessment of operators' degree of ''confidence'' in their SA and their own performance. Measuring how SA is ''perceived'' by the operator may provide information as important as the operator's ''actual'' SA, since errors in perceived SA quality (over-confidence or under-confidence in SA) may have just as harmful an effect on an individual's or team's decision-making as errors in their actual SA (Endsley, 1998).\n\nSubjective estimates of an individual's SA may also be made by experienced observers (e.g., peers, commanders, or trained external experts). These observer ratings may be somewhat superior to self-ratings of SA because more information about the true state of the environment is usually available to the observer than to the operator, who may be focused on performing the task (i.e., trained observers may have more complete knowledge of the situation). However, observers have only limited knowledge about the operator's concept of the situation and cannot have complete insight into the mental state of the individual being evaluated. Thus, observers are forced to rely more on operators' ''observable'' actions and verbalizations in order to infer their level of SA. In this case, such actions and verbalizations are best assessed using ''performance'' and ''behavioral'' measures of SA, as described next.\n\n===Performance and behavioral measures===\n''Performance measures'' \"infer\" SA from the end result (i.e., task performance outcomes), based on the assumption that better performance indicates better SA. Common performance metrics include quantity of output or productivity level, time to perform the task or respond to an event, and the accuracy of the response or, conversely, the number of errors committed. The main advantage of performance measures is that these can be collected objectively and without disrupting task performance. However, although evidence exists to suggest a positive relation between SA and performance, this connection is probabilistic and not always direct and unequivocal (Endsley, 1995b). In other words, good SA does not always lead to good performance and poor SA does not always lead to poor performance (Endsley, 1990). Thus, performance measures should be used in conjunction with others measures of SA that directly assess this construct.\n\n''Behavioral measures'' also \"infer\" SA from the actions that individuals choose to take, based on the assumption that good actions will follow from good SA and vice versa. Behavioral measures rely primarily on observer ratings, and are, thus, somewhat subjective in nature. To address this limitation, observers can be asked to evaluate the degree to which individuals are carrying out actions and exhibiting behaviors that would be expected to promote the achievement of higher levels of SA (see, for example, the ''situation awareness behaviorally anchored rating scale'' (SABARS) \u2013 Matthews, Pleban, Endsley, & Strater, 2000; Strater et al., 2001). This approach removes some of the subjectivity associated with making judgments about an individual's internal state of knowledge by allowing them to make judgments about SA indicators that are more readily observable.\n\n===Process indices===\n''Process indices'' examine how individuals process information in their environment, such as by analyzing communication patterns between team members or using eye tracking devices. Team communication (particularly verbal communication) supports the knowledge building and information processing that leads to SA construction (Endsley & Jones, 1997). Thus, since SA may be distributed via communication, computational linguistics and machine learning techniques can be combined with natural language analytical techniques (e.g., Latent Semantic Analysis) to create models that draw on the verbal expressions of the team to predict SA and task performance (Bolstad, Cuevas, Gonzalez, & Schneider, 2005; Bolstad, Foltz, Franzke, Cuevas, Rosenstein, & Costello, 2007). Although evidence exists to support the utility of communication analysis for predicting team SA (Foltz, Bolstad, Cuevas, Franzke, Rosenstein, & Costello, in press), time constraints and technological limitations (e.g., cost and availability of speech recording systems and speech-to-text translation software) may make this approach less practical and viable in time-pressured, fast-paced operations.\n\nPsycho-physiological measures also serve as process indices of operator SA by providing an assessment of the relationship between human performance and a corrected change in the operator's physiology (e.g., French, Clark, Pomeroy, Seymour, & Clarke, 2007). In other words, cognitive activity is associated with changes in the operator's physiological states. For example, the operator's overall functional state (as assessed using psycho-physiological measures, such as electroencephalographic ([[EEG]]) data, eyeblinks, and cardiac activity) may provide an indication as to whether the operator is sleep fatigued at one end of the continuum, or mentally overloaded at the other end (Wilson, 2000). Other psycho-physiological measures, such as event related potentials (ERP), event related desynchronization (ERD), transient heart rate (HR), and electrodermal activity (EDA), may be useful for evaluating an operator's perception of critical environmental cues, that is, to determine if the operator has detected and perceived a task-relevant stimulus (Wilson, 2000). In addition, it is also possible to use psycho-physiological measures to monitor operators' environmental expectancies, that is, their physiological responses to upcoming events, as a measure of their current level of SA (Wilson, 2000).\n\n===Multi-faceted approach to measurement===\nThe multivariate nature of SA significantly complicates its quantification and measurement, as it is conceivable that a metric may only tap into one aspect of the operator's SA. Further, studies have shown that different types of SA measures do not always correlate strongly with each other (cf. Durso, Truitt, Hackworth, Crutchfield, Nikolic, Moertl, Ohrt, & Manning, 1995; Endsley, Selcon, Hardiman, & Croft, 1998; Vidulich, 2000). Accordingly, rather than rely on a single approach or metric, valid and reliable measurement of SA should utilize a battery of distinct yet related measures that complement each other (e.g., Harwood, Barnett, & Wickens, 1988). Such a multi-faced approach to SA measurement capitalizes on the strengths of each measure while minimizing the limitations inherent in each.\n\n==Training==\nFollowing Endsley's paradigm and with ''cognitive resource management'' model<ref>Simmon, D.A.

Situational awareness is achieved by developing and using solutions that often consume data and information from many different sources. Technology and algorithms are then used to apply knowledge and wisdom in order to discern patterns of behavior that point to possible, probable, and real threats.\n\nSituational awareness for cybersecurity threat operations teams appears in the form of a condensed, enriched, often graphical, prioritized, and easily searchable view of systems that are inside or related to security areas of responsibility (such as corporate networks or those used for national security interests).

In the military realm, agent transparency has been investigated as [[unmanned vehicle]]s are being employed more frequently. In 2014, researchers at the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory]] reported the Situation Awareness-based Agent Transparency (SAT), a model designed to increase transparency through user interface design. When it comes to automation, six barriers that have been determined to discourage human trust in: \u201c\u2018low observability, predictability, directability and auditability\u2019...[and] \u2018low mutual understanding of common goals.\u2019\u201d <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=3141|title=Army scientists improve human-agent teaming by making AI agents more transparent {{!}} U.S. Army Research Laboratory|website=arl.army.mil|language=en|access-date=2018-08-15}}</ref> The researchers at the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory]] designed three levels of situational awareness transparency based on [[Situation awareness#Endsley's model|Endsley's theory]] of prediction, comprehension, and projection.

community and [[First responder|first-responders]] with a mission of standardizing the structured [[Geographic data and information|geo-spatial data]] to be shared online over a variety of platforms. The result is to create a Common Operating Picture (COP) that generates accurate and timely information displayed visually, both at the strategic level for decision makers and at the tactical level for people on site. The NISC promotes the sharing of code, data widgets, and training in order to increase the quality of the situational awareness. Large scale exercises like the [https://web.archive.org/web/20170203164143/http://www.cusec.org/plans-a-programs/capstone14/173 Capstone-14] week-long event coordinated by the [http://www.cusec.org Central United States Earthquake Consortium] (CUSEC) and actual operational use of these [[data sharing]] methods have also advanced the work of NISC to expand the usability of GIS-based information sharing for enhanced situational awareness.\n\n=== Military training methods ===\nThere are two training scenarios designed to increase the situational awareness skills of military professionals, and first responders in police and emergency services. The first, [[Kim's Game]], has a more common place in the Marine Corps sniper school and police academies. The name is derived from the novel [[Kim (novel)|Kim]] which references the game to a spy school lesson. The game involves a tray with various items such as spoons, pencils, bullets, and any other items the soldiers would be familiar with. The participants are given one minute to view all of these items before they are covered up with a blanket. The participants would then individually list the items that they saw, the one with the most correct answers would win the game.<ref name=\"The Prepping Guide\">{{Cite news|url=https://thepreppingguide.com/situational-awareness/|title=Situational Awareness: How You Can Master Survival, Work and Life|date=2017-09-13|work=The Prepping Guide|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en-US}}</ref> The same game is played in young scouting and girl guide groups as well to teach children quick memorisation skills.\n\nThe second method is a more practical military application of Kim's Game. It starts with a field area (jungle, bush or forest) of about five meters wide to 10 meters deep where various items, some camouflaged and some not, to be located in the area on the ground and in the trees at eyesight level. Again, these items would be ones that are familiar to the soldiers undergoing the exercise. The participants would be given 10 minutes to view the area from one place and take a mental note of the items they saw. Once their 10 minutes is up, the soldier would then be required to do a repetition of certain exercises such as [[Burpee (exercise)|burpees]], designed to simulate the stress of a physically demanding environment. Once the participant completes the exercise, they would list the items they saw. The points would be tallied in the end to find the winner.<ref name=\"The Prepping Guide\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=}}\n* {{annotated link|Alert state}}\n* {{annotated link|Aviation safety}}\n* {{annotated link|Brownout (aeronautics)}}\n* {{annotated link|Decision-making}}\n* {{annotated link|Diving safety}}\n* {{annotated link|Information integration}}\n* {{annotated link|Korean Air Lines Flight 007}}\n* {{annotated link|Self-awareness}}\n* {{annotated link|Situated cognition}}\n* {{annotated link|Situation room}}\n* {{annotated link|Spatial awareness}}\n* {{annotated link|Spatial disorientation}}\n* {{annotated link|Single-pilot resource management}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Notes===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* FDSE's COP Page [http://www.situational-awareness-systems.com/?itemCategory=33355&siteid=297&priorId=33350]\n* Adam, E.C.

November 15, 1970 in [[Mississauga, Ontario]])  is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Paralympics|Paralympian]] and a six-time world champion in [[Disabled sports|wheelchair sports]].\n\n==Competitive racing==\nAdams competed at six consecutive [[Summer Paralympics]] from 1988 to 2008, winning a total of three gold, four silver, and six bronze medals. At the [[1988 Summer Paralympics]] he won two bronze medals, one in the 800m race and one in the 1500m race. Four years later at the [[1992 Summer Paralympics|Barcelona Games]] he won two silvers, one in the 800m  race and one as part of the 4 \u00d7 400 m relay. At the [[1996 Summer Paralympics]] he won gold in the 800&nbsp;m, silver in the 400&nbsp;m, and bronze in the 4\u00d7400&nbsp;m relay. Four years later, at the [[2000 Summer Paralympics|Sydney games]], he won five medals, a gold in the 800&nbsp;m and 1500&nbsp;m, a silver in the 400&nbsp;m and a bronze in the 5000&nbsp;m and 4x100&nbsp;m. At the [[2004 Summer Paralympics|2004 Paralympics]] he won a bronze in the 400&nbsp;m race. Adams was coached by [[Peter Eriksson (coach)|Peter Eriksson]].\n\n==Post-competition==\nIn 2002, Adams ascended the 1,776 steps of the [[CN Tower]] in a specially-designed [[wheelchair]]; in 2004, he climbed the [[Acropolis]].\n\nHe is an inductee into the [[Terry Fox Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jeff Adams|url=http://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/en/index.php/pages/our-stories/exhibits/snapshots-of-ontarios-sport-heritage/sports-personalities-traditions-and-key-events/jeff-adams|website=Ontario Heritage Trust|publisher=[[Ontario Heritage Trust]]|accessdate=20 April 2017|language=en-ca|date=27 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2010, he was a [[2010 Winter Paralympics torch relay#Torchbearers|torchbearer]] during the [[2010 Winter Paralympics torch relay]].<ref>[http://www.vancouver2010.com/paralympic-games/more-2010-information/paralympic-torch-relay/daily-highlights/march-5/ \"March 5 - Toronto\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308055416/http://www.vancouver2010.com/paralympic-games/more-2010-information/paralympic-torch-relay/daily-highlights/march-5/ |date=2010-03-08 }}, Vancouver 2010 official website (viewed on March 2)</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Adams was part of the broadcast crew on [[Channel 4]]'s coverage of the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] in [[London]].<ref name=Independent>{{cite news|last=Pitt-Brooke|first=Jack|title=Jack Pitt-Brooke: Instructive and inspirational \u2013 Channel 4 strike the Paralympic balance|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/jack-pittbrooke-instructive-and-inspirational--channel-4-strike-the-paralympic-balance-8101427.html|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=6 September 2012|date=3 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"On the box\">{{cite web|title=LONDON 2012: Paralympic Games \u2013 Meet the C4 team|url=http://sport-onthebox.com/2012/08/23/london-2012-paralympics-meet-the-c4-team/#more-7086|publisher=Sport On The Box|accessdate=6 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nAdams is additionally a [[motivational speaker]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jeff Adams {{!}} Paralympian {{!}} World Champion|url=http://www.speakers.ca/speakers/jeff-adams/|website=www.speakers.ca|accessdate=20 April 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Adams was announced to be inducted into the [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"CSHoF\">{{cite web|last1=Harrison|first1=Doug|title=Leafs legend Dave Keon, Olympic great Alex Despatie headline Canada's Sports Hall of Fame newcomers {{!}} CBC Sports|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/keon-canada-sports-hall-of-fame-inductees-1.4635599|publisher=[[CBC News|CBC]]|accessdate=26 April 2018|date=26 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nAdams underwent radiation therapy for cancer as a child, and aftermath of the treatment led to a spinal injury at age 9 that paralysed him.<ref name=\"ICON listing\">{{cite web|title=Jeff Adams|url=http://www.iconwheelchairs.com/management|work=Management|publisher=ICON Wheelchairs|accessdate=30 March 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126013258/http://www.iconwheelchairs.com/management|archivedate=26 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=Innovation>{{cite news|last=Mourtada|first=Rasha|title=Canadian upstart reinvents its wheels|url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/digital/innovation/canadian-upstart-reinvents-its-wheels/article2299005/?service=mobile|accessdate=30 March 2012|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=12 January 2012}}</ref> After retiring from competition, Adams and business partner Christian Bagg co-launched Marvel Wheelchairs with [[Cervelo|Cerv\u00e9lo Cycles]], producing adjustable wheelchairs for everyday use.<ref name=Innovation /> After Cerv\u00e9lo was unable to secure bridge financing for debt to suppliers, Marvel was taken over and unsuccessful attempts were made to sell it by Cerv\u00e9lo.

{"title_page": "Wigwag (flag signals)", "text_new": "[[File:Civil War Signal Corps Kit.jpg|thumb|Wigwag flags, wigwag torches and kerosene canteen, and a signal rocket]]\n'''Wigwag''' (more formally, '''aerial telegraphy''') is an historical form of [[flag signals|flag signaling]] that passes messages by waving a single flag.  It differs from [[flag semaphore]] in that it uses one flag rather than two, and the symbols for each letter are represented by the motion of the flag rather than its position.  The larger flag and its motion allow messages to be read over greater distances than semaphore.  Messages could be sent at night using torches instead of flags.\n\nThe most common code used with wigwag had three motions, only two of which were needed to form letters of the alphabet.  These two were waving the flag, respectively, to the left and right \u2013 the wigwagging motion.  A [[Character (computing)|character]] was formed by sequentially displaying a number of motions (elements).  Like [[Morse code]], the number of elements in each character was not fixed, the most common letters being assigned the shortest codes.  A number of other codes were used at times, some of them with a fixed number of elements and up to four different motions.  Morse code was used with wigwag after it became an international standard.\n\nThe wigwag system was invented in the 1850s by US Army surgeon [[Albert J. Myer]] who became the first head of the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]].  Wigwag was used extensively by both sides in the [[American Civil War]] and continued to see use in both America and Europe until the end of the century.  After that, long distance communication was performed by [[electrical telegraphy]], or in some places where the telegraph was not available, by [[heliograph]].\n\n== Operation ==\n[[File:Wigwag motions.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The basic wigwag signaling motions<ref>Myer (1866), plate F</ref>]]\nThe wigwag system consisted of a signalman waving a single large flag or other display device in different motions sequentially.  At night, a lamp on a pole could be used, or over short distances the signalman might hold a small disk.  The usual wigwag code was ternary, that is, there were three different motions (symbols) that could be displayed. However, only two of these symbols were used for letters, making it largely binary.  The third symbol only appeared in [[control character]]s.  The neutral position was the signalman holding the flag vertically and motionless above his head. The first motion was initiated by bringing the device downward on the signalman's right side and then quickly returning it to its upright position. The second motion brought the device down on the left side and then returned it to the starting position. The third motion lowered the device in front of the signalman, then restored it to its vertical position.<ref>Myer (1866), p. 83</ref>  Some sources define the movement to the left as \"1\" and to the right as \"2\" and list the code with \"1\" and \"2\" interchanged.<ref>Raines, p. 7</ref>\n\nLike [[Morse code]], the normal wigwag code did not have a fixed length (number of elements) for each [[Character (computing)|character]].  For instance, ''i'' was coded as \"1\", but ''d'' was coded as \"222\".<ref>Wolters, p. 10</ref>  The table shows the commonly used wigwag code and the diagram shows the flag motions.<ref>Myer (1872), p. 68</ref>  It is as defined in the [[General Service Code]] of July 1864 issued to standardize signals of the US Army and Navy.<ref>Raines, p. 13</ref>  Further details of the code and an alternate four-symbol representation are given in {{sectionlink|#Code details}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Wigwag code (General Service Code)\n|-\n!A!!B!!C!!D!!E!!F!!G!!H!!I!!J!!K!!L!!M\n|-\n|22||2112||121||222||12||2221||2211||122||1||1122||2121||221||1221\n|-\n|\n|-\n!N!!O!!P!!Q!!R!!S!!T!!U!!V!!W!!X!!Y!!Z\n|-\n|11||21||1212||1211||211||212||2||112||1222||1121||2122||111||2222\n|}\n\nThe elements of a character are performed rapidly without pause between them, only returning the flag to the rest position at the end of the character.<ref>{{multiref|Coe, p. 3|Myer (1866), pp. 53, 80}}</ref>  The US Army ''Manual of Signals'' lists several alternative codes, including a three-element fixed-length code using four symbols (1866 edition), and a three-element fixed-length code using three symbols (1872 edition). There is no indication in the manual that these codes were actually in use.<ref>{{multiref|Myer (1866), p. 97|Myer (1872), p. 96}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Wigwag flag colours.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|Available colors for wigwag flags]]\nWigwag has an advantage over [[flag semaphore]] in that only one flag is used instead of two.<ref>Raines, p. 5</ref>  Thus, both arms could be used to raise the flag and a larger, heavier flag could be employed.  Nevertheless, signalmen required great strength to use a 4-foot flag on a 16-foot pole.  Even a light wind would multiply the difficulty and rain made the flag heavier.  Contemporary flags were heavier than modern equivalents, being made of linen<ref>Myer (1866), p. 176</ref> or cotton.  Modern large flags designed to be hand held might be made of lighter silk or nylon and are more resistant to moisture retention.<ref>Woods & Sterling, p. 159</ref>\n\n=== Flags and disks ===\nThe flags came in seven combinations of colors and sizes.  They were all square flags with a smaller square (one third the width) of a different color in the center.  The colors available were a white flag with a red center, a black flag with a white center, and a red flag with a white center.  All three were produced in the most commonly used four foot ({{nowrap|120 cm}}) size.  The white and black flags came in a six foot ({{nowrap|180 cm}}) size for greater range, and the white and red flags had a two foott ({{nowrap|60 cm}}) size.<ref>{{multiref|Myer (1866), p. 176|Raines, p. 13}}</ref>  The size and color of flag was chosen depending on lighting conditions and distance.  The white flag was the most common and was used against dark backgrounds.  Against light or varied backgrounds, the red flag was more effective and was also used at sea.<ref>{{multiref|Greely, pp. 308\u2013309|Thompson, p. 12|Raines, p. 14}}</ref>  The black flag was used against a background of snow.<ref>Greely, pp. 308\u2013309</ref>  The two foot flags, called ''action flags'', were used in situations where the signalman needed to stay under cover from enemy fire or wished to signal less obtrusively.<ref>Raines, p. 14</ref>  Each flag had a number of ties or tapes sewn along hoist edge.  These were used to fix the flag to a four-section staff, each section four feet long and fitted with ferrules for joining.<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 175\u2013176</ref>\n\nThe disks were 12 to 18&nbsp;inches (30 to 46&nbsp;cm) in diameter and were made of metal or wood frames with canvas surfaces. Somewhat easier to handle than the heavy flags, they provided a different method for daylight communications. The lights were kerosene lanterns attached to a staff. A second \"foot torch\" was placed on the ground before the signalman as a fixed point of reference, making it easier for the recipient to follow the lantern's movements.<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 176\u2013178</ref>  A 30X telescope was a standard part of the wigwag kit.  This was used by a signaler alongside the flagman to read the signals from the remote station, which could be at a distance of up to 20 miles.<ref>Thompson, p. 12</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe wigwag system filled a gap in the history of military communication between the age of close-quarter fighting and the age of modern long-range weapons.  In the 1860s, [[radio]] and [[telephone]] communications had yet to be invented and [[electrical telegraphy]], although established, was still in its infancy.  It was still being worked out how the latter could be used on the battlefield, and portable equipment ruggedized for military use was not available early in the decade.  Wigwag provided a method that was both simple to use and faster and more reliable than couriers.<ref>Raines, p. 31</ref>  By the start of [[World War I]], the range and accuracy of modern weapons had made flag signaling too dangerous to use on the front line, and more sophisticated technology was then available.<ref>Woods & Stirling, p. 160</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Albert J Myer in the field during American Civil War.png|thumb|Albert J. Myer (center) during the [[Peninsula campaign]] (1862)<ref>Raines, p. 24</ref> of the American Civil War]]\nThe wigwag system was invented by US Army surgeon Major [[Albert J. Myer]] in the 1850s.  Myer took his inspiration from the [[telegraph code]] of [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]], although the [[codepoint]]s finally used were not the same as Bain's.  The Bain code, invented 1843, was used on the chemical [[printing telegraph]] of that inventor and was a dot-dash code similar to the [[Morse code]].  Myer came across it while working as a [[telegraph operator]], work he did for a period after his graduation in 1847.  In 1851, Myer produced ''A New Sign Language for Deaf Mutes'' as the thesis for his medical doctorate.  In this publication Myer used the Bain code as the basis for communication with a deaf person by tapping a hand or cheek.  Alternatively, tapping a table with which the person was also in contact could be used to pass messages.  In 1854, Myer joined the army as an assistant surgeon and was posted to Texas.  It was in Texas that he developed the idea of the wigwag flag or torch code for military use, building on his previous work with the deaf.<ref>{{multiref|Raines, p. 5|Chambers, p. 171}}</ref>\n\nIn 1856, while stationed at [[Fort Duncan]], Texas, Myer wrote to [[Jefferson Davis]], then [[Secretary of War]], proposing his signaling system.  He was supported by [[Joseph Gilbert Totten]] the Army [[Chief of Engineers]] but failed to get a hearing due to lack of detail in his proposal.  In 1857, Totten tried again with a new Secretary of War, [[John B. Floyd]].  In 1859, a board of examination under [[Robert E. Lee]] considered the proposal but thought it had only limited use.  They did not put it into operation but allowed Myer to continue with tests.  Myer conducted these tests starting in April, initially at [[Fort Monroe]], Virginia, and later in New York and Washington.<ref>Raines, p. 6</ref>\n\nMyer, with Floyd's support, proposed that a new post of signal officer to the Army staff should be created, with him filling it.  In February 1860, Myer got a hearing before the Senate Committee on Military Affairs under the chairmanship of Jefferson Davis which supported the introduction of the system.  Davis opposed the creation of the signal officer post when it came before congress; he wanted to use the signaling system but feared the creation of the signal officer post would lead to the creation of a new department (the future [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]]).  Davis's objections were ignored and Myer was made signal officer and promoted to major in June 1860.<ref>Raines, p. 6\u20137</ref>  Myer submitted a patent application in 1860 claiming the rights to all signaling systems based on motions (of which wigwag is an example) as opposed to positions (of which flag semaphore is an example).  The patent was granted in January 1861.<ref>Raines, pp. 7\u20138</ref>\n\n=== In service ===\n[[File:Signal station Elk Mountain.jpg|thumb|upright|A wigwag station on [[Elk Ridge (Maryland)|Elk Ridge]], Maryland, during the [[Battle of Antietam]]]]\nThe first live use of the system was in 1860 in a campaign against the [[Navajo]] in the [[Department of New Mexico]].  Myer served under Major [[Edward Canby]] who became a strong supporter of the formation of a signal corps, which he thought more efficient than Myer's proposal to train every officer.  The Navajo war was over by February 1861, but at the same time the [[American Civil War]] was beginning.  Up to this point, Myer had been temporarily assigned men from the units in which he served to work as signalers, often grudgingly.  This was impractical for a large scale war and Myer now pressed for Canby's idea of a dedicated signal corps.  Many in Washington opposed the idea, and it took until 3 March 1863 before the Signal Corps was formally inaugurated, although the signalers had been informally called \"signal corps\" for some time.  Myer was put in charge with the rank of Colonel.<ref>Raines, pp. 7\u201313</ref>\n\n==== Civil War ====\n[[File:The photographic history of the Civil War - thousands of scenes photographed 1861-65, with text by many special authorities (1911) (14782789933).jpg|thumb|upright|The Cobb's Hill wigwag tower, 1864]]\nWigwag was used extensively by [[Signal Corps in the American Civil War|Civil War Signal Corps]] troops on both sides.<ref>Raines, pp. 23\u201329</ref>  Its first use in battle was by [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] Lieutenant [[Edward Porter Alexander]] (a former pupil of Myer)<ref>Greely, p. 313</ref> at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] in 1861.<ref>Alexander, pp. 3, 4, 14\u201316, 30\u201331</ref>  The signalmen on this occasion fulfilled an important function by reporting a Union attempt to turn the Confederate flank.<ref>Rauch, p. 102</ref>  Myer had originally promoted the idea as a lightweight mobile system that could be carried by a single man.<ref>Raines, p. 5</ref> \u2013 a common task for signalmen was to act as forward observers reporting artillery fall of shot.<ref>Raines, p. 9</ref>  As the war progressed, more substantial stations were constructed.  Enormous towers, some well over 100 feet, were built.<ref>Myer (1866), frontispiece</ref>  The Cobb's Hill tower shown in the image was built by the [[Appomattox River]] in June 1864.<ref>Greely, p. 311</ref>  Wherever possible, existing structures were used.  Building stations in trees was common, and church steeples were often used.<ref>Raines, p. 16</ref>  The system, at least on the Union side, took on the nature of a genuine communications network.<ref>Berkowitz, pp. 52\u201353</ref>  The Confederates, despite being first in the field with wigwag, and the Union side being slow to get going, never succeeded in building a network to the same extent.  The Confederate Signal Corps was simply not given resources on the same scale.<ref>Raines, pp. 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe mere existence of a flag station could cause problems for the enemy.  Alexander, in his memoirs, referred to the [[Little Round Top]] station as \"that wretched little signal station\" because he was forced to make roundabout movements of his troops and artillery to avoid being observed (at this time, 1863, Alexander was no longer connected with the Signal Corps, but was in command of the artillery at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]<ref>Heidler & Heidler</ref>).  The Confederates had tried but failed to seize the position several times, including during [[Pickett's Charge]] in 1863.  During that action Captain Davis E. Castle continued to signal with a bedsheet after the flagman had retreated with the flags.<ref>Raines, pp. 26\u201327</ref>  The 125 ft height of the Cobbs Hill tower gave it such a good view of Confederate movements that they assigned a gun battery specifically to destroy it.  They failed to achieve this and the tower remained in use until the fall of [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]].<ref>Greely, p. 311</ref>\n\nSignalmen were sometimes assigned to ships to maintain communication between the navy and land forces.  On large operations they might also be used for ship-to-ship communication.  The signalman was posted high up on the masthead of the ship.  This was especially common on operations concerning the [[Mississippi River]] such as the [[Vicksburg campaign]] and the [[Siege of Port Hudson]].<ref>Raines, p. 27</ref>\n[[File:UnionCipherDisk.nsa.jpg|thumb|upright|A Union cipher disk]]\nThe fact that the Confederates had personnel able to read the wigwag code was problematic for the Union side.  Security concerns led to a reluctance to send important messages by flag signals.  General [[Daniel Butterfield]] went so far as to order the [[Army of the Potomac]] not to use signals at all, much to the concern of its chief signal officer [[Benjamin F, Fisher]].  To overcome this problem, the Signal Corps created a [[cipher disk]] to encode messages.  It is believed that the Confederates never broke this code.<ref>Raines, p. 16</ref>  The Union side was able to read Confederate flag signals without being discovered until at least 1864 when Myer's successor as head of the Signal Corps, [[William J. L. Nicodemus]], published the fact in a pamphlet.  Nicodemus was dismissed in December 1864 for this breach of security and replaced by Fisher.<ref>Raines, pp. 22\u201323</ref>\n\nMyer did not use the term ''wigwag'' in the manuals he produced.  He called the system ''aerial signals''<ref>Myer (1872), p. </ref> or ''aerial telegraphy''.<ref>Thompson, p. 13</ref>  The system probably came to be known as wigwag because of the apparently random motions of the flag as seen by an untrained observer.<ref name=museum>US Army Signal Museum, \"Crossed flags: History of the wigwag\", United States Army Signal Center, Fort Gordon, Georgia, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070707002941/http://www.gordon.army.mil/OCOS/Museum/csrdflag.asp archived] 7 July 2007.</ref>\n\n==== Signal station gallery ====\n<gallery>\nFile:Wigwag 130 ft tower.png|A 130 foot wigwag tower used in operations against [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]<ref>Myer (1868), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag 125 ft tower.png|125 ft wigwag tower used in operations against Richmond<ref>Myer (1866), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag masthead signal station, Richmond.png|Wigwag station on the masthead of a US ship at Richmond<ref>Myer (1868), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag station near Washington.png|Wigwag station near Washington<ref>Myer (1868), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag tree station, upper Potomac.png|Wigwag station in a tree on the [[Upper Potomac River]]<ref>Myer (1872), fronispiece</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n==== Other campaigns ====\nThe Civil War was the high point of the use of wigwag, but there were some other campaigns that included flag signalmen, mainly against [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].  Signal parties accompanied general [[Patrick E. Connor]] on the [[Powder River Expedition (1865)|Powder River Expedition]] of 1865 in [[Wyoming]] and [[Montana]].  The signalmen were used to maintain communications between troop columns.<ref>Raines, pp. 26\u201327</ref>  The campaign was a punitive expedition against the [[Sioux]], [[Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]]<ref>McDermott, p.6</ref> in retaliation for raiding and disrupting travel on the [[Bozeman Trail]].  The expedition was a large operation consisting of three separate columns approaching from different directions.<ref>Coutant, ch. 36</ref>\n\nWigwag was taken up by some European countries, notably the British in African colonial wars.  It was used extensively in the [[Boer War]] in South Africa.  Once [[Morse code]] became an international standard, the British dropped the Myer code for wigwag signaling and used Morse instead with the flag movements indicating dots and dashes.  The French had a slight variation of that, using a single flag for ''dot'' and two flags for ''dash''.<ref>Woods & Sterling, p. 160</ref>\n\n=== Withdrawal ===\n[[File:Sign (8037141146).jpg|thumb|upright|US Army Signal Corp insignia featuring crossed wigwag flags and torch]]\n{{see also|Signal Corps in the American Civil War#Telegraph train and the Beardslee telegraph}}\n\nEven while the Civil War was still in progress, the electrical telegraph was starting to displace flag signaling.  This perhaps did not happen as quickly as it might have done because the US Military Telegraph was not put under the control of the Signal Corps.  Myer made repeated attempts to absorb the Military Telegraph but failed due to political rivalries.  Nevertheless, Myer was able to institute ''telegraph trains'' (that is, trains of wagons, not rail locomotives) that carried a combination of electrical telegraph and flag equipment.  The original idea was to use the [[Morse telegraph]] in the trains, but due to the unavailability of trained Morse operators to Myer, the contractor, [[Henry J. Rogers]], replaced the Morse key and sounder with a circular alphabet and pointer of his own design that could be operated by any literate person.  A further change was the replacement of acid batteries for power with a hand-cranked [[electrical generator]] invented by [[George W. Beardslee]].<ref>Raines, pp. 16\u201318</ref>  Although these changes made use in the field easier, they had serious disadvantages.  The Rogers alphabet system slowed down the speed of transmission, and the Beardslee generator was only powerful enough for short distances.  These problems resulted in occasions when the Signal Corps had to turn over its lines to the Military Telegraph with their superior equipment.  After the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in 1863 where these problems were apparent, Myer tried to recruit Morse operators through advertisements.  However, this just resulted in Myer's dismissal for exceeding his authority, and replacement by Nicodemus.  The inability of the Signal Corps to fully adopt the electrical telegraph ensured that flag signals remained in widespread use throughout the war.<ref>Raines, pp. 20\u201321</ref>\n\nMyer's code remained in use in the US until 1886 when it was replaced by Morse code.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 15</ref>  It came back into use after 1896,<ref name=museum/> but was officially discontinued in 1912 when [[International Morse code]] was mandated for all types of visual signaling. Inconsistently, [[American Morse code]] was mandated for Army electrical telegraph lines, but not for [[radio telegraphy]].<ref>Coe, p. 3</ref>  The wigwag method was superseded by [[flag semaphore]] for short distances, and the [[heliograph]] for long distances in regions where the electrical telegraph was not available.  The heliograph saw widespread use in Arizona and New Mexico after [[Nelson A. Miles]] took over command of the campaign against the [[Apache]] in 1886.<ref>Miles, pp. 481\u2013484</ref>  In good conditions, the heliograph could transmit over distances as great as 50 miles.  This is far in excess of anything achievable with flag signaling.<ref>Woods, pp. 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n== Code details ==\n=== Two-symbol code (General Service Code) ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Flag motions<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 55\u201356, plates E, F</ref>\n|-\n!Symbol!!Motion\n|-\n|1||Wave flag to ground on right\n|-\n|2||Wave flag to ground on left\n|-\n|3||Dip flag to ground in front\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Letters\n|-\n!A!!B!!C!!D!!E!!F!!G!!H!!I!!J!!K!!L!!M\n|-\n|22||2112||121||222||12||2221||2211||122||1||1122||2121||221||1221\n|-\n|\n|-\n!N!!O!!P!!Q!!R!!S!!T!!U!!V!!W!!X!!Y!!Z\n|-\n|11||21||1212||1211||211||212||2||112||1222||1121||2122||111||2222\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Common words and syllables<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 53\u201354</ref>\n|-\n!Codepoint!!Meaning\n|-\n|1111||&\n|-\n|2212||ing\n|-\n|1112||tion\n|-\n|a||after\n|-\n|b||before\n|-\n|c||can\n|-\n|h||have\n|-\n|n||not\n|-\n|r||are\n|-\n|t||the\n|-\n|u||you\n|-\n|ur||your\n|-\n|w||word\n|-\n|wi||with\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Controls<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 54\u201355</ref>\n|-\n!Codepoint!!Meaning\n|-\n|3||End of word\n|-\n|33||End of sentence\n|-\n|333||End of message\n|-\n|22.22.22.3||Understood\n|-\n|22.22.22.333||Stop sending\n|-\n|121.121.121||Repeat\n|-\n|212121||Error\n|-\n|211.211.211||Move to the right\n|-\n|221.221.221||Move to the left\n|-\n|Continuos waving||Attention\n|-\n|Two circles to right||End of address\n|-\n|Two circles to left||Start of signature\n|}\n\nNumerals could represent a control signal as well as a number.

It differs from [[flag semaphore]] in that it uses one flag rather than two, and the symbols for each letter are represented by the motion of the flag rather than its position.  The larger flag and its motion allow messages to be read over greater distances than semaphore.  Messages could be sent at night using torches instead of flags.\n\nThe most common code used with wigwag had three motions, only two of which were needed to form letters of the alphabet.  These two were waving the flag, respectively, to the left and right \u2013 the wigwagging motion.  A [[Character (computing)|character]] was formed by sequentially displaying a number of motions (elements).  Like [[Morse code]], the number of elements in each character was not fixed, the most common letters being assigned the shortest codes.  A number of other codes were used at times, some of them with a fixed number of elements and up to four different motions.  Morse code was used with wigwag after it became an international standard.\n\nThe wigwag system was invented in the 1850s by US Army surgeon [[Albert J. Myer]] who became the first head of the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]].  Wigwag was used extensively by both sides in the [[American Civil War]] and continued to see use in both America and Europe until the end of the century.  After that, long distance communication was performed by [[electrical telegraphy]], or in some places where the telegraph was not available, by [[heliograph]].\n\n== Operation ==\n[[File:Wigwag motions.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The basic wigwag signaling motions<ref>Myer (1866), plate F</ref>]]\nThe wigwag system consisted of a signalman waving a single large flag or other display device in different motions sequentially.  At night, a lamp on a pole could be used, or over short distances the signalman might hold a small disk.  The usual wigwag code was ternary, that is, there were three different motions (symbols) that could be displayed. However, only two of these symbols were used for letters, making it largely binary.  The third symbol only appeared in [[control character]]s.  The neutral position was the signalman holding the flag vertically and motionless above his head. The first motion was initiated by bringing the device downward on the signalman's right side and then quickly returning it to its upright position. The second motion brought the device down on the left side and then returned it to the starting position. The third motion lowered the device in front of the signalman, then restored it to its vertical position.<ref>Myer (1866), p. 83</ref>  Some sources define the movement to the left as \"1\" and to the right as \"2\" and list the code with \"1\" and \"2\" interchanged.<ref>Raines, p. 7</ref>\n\nLike [[Morse code]], the normal wigwag code did not have a fixed length (number of elements) for each [[Character (computing)|character]].  For instance, ''i'' was coded as \"1\", but ''d'' was coded as \"222\".<ref>Wolters, p. 10</ref>  The table shows the commonly used wigwag code and the diagram shows the flag motions.<ref>Myer (1872), p. 68</ref>  It is as defined in the [[General Service Code]] of July 1864 issued to standardize signals of the US Army and Navy.<ref>Raines, p. 13</ref>  Further details of the code and an alternate four-symbol representation are given in {{sectionlink|#Code details}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Wigwag code (General Service Code)\n|-\n!A!!B!!C!!D!!E!!F!!G!!H!!I!!J!!K!!L!!M\n|-\n|22||2112||121||222||12||2221||2211||122||1||1122||2121||221||1221\n|-\n|\n|-\n!N!!O!!P!!Q!!R!!S!!T!!U!!V!!W!!X!!Y!!Z\n|-\n|11||21||1212||1211||211||212||2||112||1222||1121||2122||111||2222\n|}\n\nThe elements of a character are performed rapidly without pause between them, only returning the flag to the rest position at the end of the character.<ref>{{multiref|Coe, p. 3|Myer (1866), pp. 53, 80}}</ref>  The US Army ''Manual of Signals'' lists several alternative codes, including a three-element fixed-length code using four symbols (1866 edition), and a three-element fixed-length code using three symbols (1872 edition). There no indication in the manual that these codes were actually in use.<ref>{{multiref|Myer (1866), p. 97|Myer (1872), p. 96}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Wigwag flag colours.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|Available colors for wigwag flags]]\nWigwag has an advantage over [[flag semaphore]] in that only one flag is used instead of two.<ref>Raines, p. 5</ref>  Thus, both arms could be used to raise the flag and a larger, heavier flag could be employed.  Nevertheless, signalmen required great strength to use a 4-foot flag on a 16-foot pole.  Even a light wind would multiply the difficulty and rain made the flag heavier.  Contemporary flags were heavier than modern equivalents, being made of linen<ref>Myer (1866), p. 176</ref> or cotton.  Modern large flags designed to be hand held might be made of lighter silk or nylon and are more resistant to moisture retention.<ref>Woods & Sterling, p. 159</ref>\n\n=== Flags and disks ===\nThe flags came in seven combinations of colors and sizes.  They were all square flags with a smaller square (one third the width) of a different color in the center.  The colors available were a white flag with a red center, a black flag with a white center, and a red flag with a white center.  All three were produced in the most commonly used four foot ({{nowrap|120 cm}}) size.  The white and black flags came in a six foot ({{nowrap|180 cm}}) size for greater range, and the white and red flags had a two foott ({{nowrap|60 cm}}) size.<ref>{{multiref|Myer (1866), p. 176|Raines, p. 13}}</ref>  The size and color of flag was chosen depending on lighting conditions and distance.  The white flag was the most common and was used against dark backgrounds.  Against light or varied backgrounds, the red flag was more effective and was also used at sea.<ref>{{multiref|Greely, pp. 308\u2013309|Thompson, p. 12|Raines, p. 14}}</ref>  The black flag was used against a background of snow.<ref>Greely, pp. 308\u2013309</ref>  The two foot flags, called ''action flags'', were used in situations where the signalman needed to stay under cover from enemy fire or wished to signal less obtrusively.<ref>Raines, p. 14</ref>  Each flag had a number of ties or tapes sewn along hoist edge.  These were used to fix the flag to a four-section staff, each section four feet long and fitted with ferrules for joining.<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 175\u2013176</ref>\n\nThe disks were 12 to 18&nbsp;inches (30 to 46&nbsp;cm) in diameter and were made of metal or wood frames with canvas surfaces. Somewhat easier to handle than the heavy flags, they provided a different method for daylight communications. The lights were kerosene lanterns attached to a staff. A second \"foot torch\" was placed on the ground before the signalman as a fixed point of reference, making it easier for the recipient to follow the lantern's movements.<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 176\u2013178</ref>  A 30X telescope was a standard part of the wigwag kit.  This was used by a signaler alongside the flagman to read the signals from the remote station, which could be at a distance of up to 20 miles.<ref>Thompson, p. 12</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe wigwag system filled a gap in the history of military communication between the age of close-quarter fighting and the age of modern long-range weapons.  In the 1860s, [[radio]] and [[telephone]] communications had yet to be invented and [[electrical telegraphy]], although established, was still in its infancy.  It was still being worked out how the latter could be used on the battlefield, and portable equipment ruggedized for military use was not available early in the decade.  Wigwag provided a method that was both simple to use and faster and more reliable than couriers.<ref>Raines, p. 31</ref>  By the start of [[World War I]], the range and accuracy of modern weapons had made flag signaling too dangerous to use on the front line, and more sophisticated technology was then available.<ref>Woods & Stirling, p. 160</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Albert J Myer in the field during American Civil War.png|thumb|Albert J. Myer (center) during the [[Peninsula campaign]] (1862)<ref>Raines, p. 24</ref> of the American Civil War]]\nThe wigwag system was invented by US Army surgeon Major [[Albert J. Myer]] in the 1850s.  Myer took his inspiration from the [[telegraph code]] of [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]], although the [[codepoint]]s finally used were not the same as Bain's.  The Bain code, invented 1843, was used on the chemical [[printing telegraph]] of that inventor and was a dot-dash code similar to the [[Morse code]].  Myer came across it while working as a [[telegraph operator]], work he did for a period after his graduation in 1847.  In 1851, Myer produced ''A New Sign Language for Deaf Mutes'' as the thesis for his medical doctorate.  In this publication Myer used the Bain code as the basis for communication with a deaf person by tapping a hand or cheek.  Alternatively, tapping a table with which the person was also in contact could be used to pass messages.  In 1854, Myer joined the army as an assistant surgeon and was posted to Texas.  It was in Texas that he developed the idea of the wigwag flag or torch code for military use, building on his previous work with the deaf.<ref>{{multiref|Raines, p. 5|Chambers, p. 171}}</ref>\n\nIn 1856, while stationed at [[Fort Duncan]], Texas, Myer wrote to [[Jefferson Davis]], then [[Secretary of War]], proposing his signaling system.  He was supported by [[Joseph Gilbert Totten]] the Army [[Chief of Engineers]] but failed to get a hearing due to lack of detail in his proposal.  In 1857, Totten tried again with a new Secretary of War, [[John B. Floyd]].  In 1859, a board of examination under [[Robert E. Lee]] considered the proposal but thought it had only limited use.  They did not put it into operation but allowed Myer to continue with tests.  Myer conducted these tests starting in April, initially at [[Fort Monroe]], Virginia, and later in New York and Washington.<ref>Raines, p. 6</ref>\n\nMyer, with Floyd's support, proposed that a new post of signal officer to the Army staff should be created, with him filling it.  In February 1860, Myer got a hearing before the Senate Committee on Military Affairs under the chairmanship of Jefferson Davis which supported the introduction of the system.  Davis opposed the creation of the signal officer post when it came before congress; he wanted to use the signaling system but feared the creation of the signal officer post would lead to the creation of a new department (the future [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]]).  Davis's objections were ignored and Myer was made signal officer and promoted to major in June 1860.<ref>Raines, p. 6\u20137</ref>  Myer submitted a patent application in 1860 claiming the rights to all signaling systems based on motions (of which wigwag is an example) as opposed to positions (of which flag semaphore is an example).  The patent was granted in January 1861.<ref>Raines, pp. 7\u20138</ref>\n\n=== In service ===\n[[File:Signal station Elk Mountain.jpg|thumb|upright|A wigwag station on [[Elk Ridge (Maryland)|Elk Ridge]], Maryland, during the [[Battle of Antietam]]]]\nThe first live use of the system was in 1860 in a campaign against the [[Navajo]] in the [[Department of New Mexico]].  Myer served under Major [[Edward Canby]] who became a strong supporter of the formation of a signal corps, which he thought more efficient than Myer's proposal to train every officer.  The Navajo war was over by February 1861, but at the same time the [[American Civil War]] was beginning.  Up to this point, Myer had been temporarily assigned men from the units in which he served to work as signalers, often grudgingly.  This was impractical for a large scale war and Myer now pressed for Canby's idea of a dedicated signal corps.  Many in Washington opposed the idea, and it took until 3 March 1863 before the Signal Corps was formally inaugurated, although the signalers had been informally called \"signal corps\" for some time.  Myer was put in charge with the rank of Colonel.<ref>Raines, pp. 7\u201313</ref>\n\n==== Civil War ====\n[[File:The photographic history of the Civil War - thousands of scenes photographed 1861-65, with text by many special authorities (1911) (14782789933).jpg|thumb|upright|The Cobb's Hill wigwag tower, 1864]]\nWigwag was used extensively by [[Signal Corps in the American Civil War|Civil War Signal Corps]] troops on both sides.<ref>Raines, pp. 23\u201329</ref>  Its first use in battle was by [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] Lieutenant [[Edward Porter Alexander]] (a former pupil of Myer)<ref>Greely, p. 313</ref> at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] in 1861.<ref>Alexander, pp. 3, 4, 14\u201316, 30\u201331</ref>  The signalmen on this occasion fulfilled an important function by reporting a Union attempt to turn the Confederate flank.<ref>Rauch, p. 102</ref>  Myer had originally promoted the idea as a lightweight mobile system that could be carried by a single man.<ref>Raines, p. 5</ref> \u2013 a common task for signalmen was to act as forward observers reporting artillery fall of shot.<ref>Raines, p. 9</ref>  As the war progressed, more substantial stations were constructed.  Enormous towers, some well over 100 feet, were built.<ref>Myer (1866), frontispiece</ref>  The Cobb's Hill tower shown in the image was built by the [[Appomattox River]] in June 1864.<ref>Greely, p. 311</ref>  Wherever possible, existing structures were used.  Building stations in trees was common, and church steeples were often used.<ref>Raines, p. 16</ref>  The system, at least on the Union side, took on the nature of a genuine communications network.<ref>Berkowitz, pp. 52\u201353</ref>  The Confederates, despite being first in the field with wigwag, and the Union side being slow to get going, never succeeded in building a network to the same extent.  The Confederate Signal Corps was simply not given resources on the same scale.<ref>Raines, pp. 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe mere existence of a flag station could cause problems for the enemy.  Alexander, in his memoirs, referred to the [[Little Round Top]] station as \"that wretched little signal station\" because he was forced to make roundabout movements of his troops and artillery to avoid being observed (at this time, 1863, Alexander was no longer connected with the Signal Corps, but was in command of the artillery at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]<ref>Heidler & Heidler</ref>).  The Confederates had tried but failed to seize the position several times, including during [[Pickett's Charge]] in 1863.  During that action Captain Davis E. Castle continued to signal with a bedsheet after the flagman had retreated with the flags.<ref>Raines, pp. 26\u201327</ref>  The 125 ft height of the Cobbs Hill tower gave it such a good view of Confederate movements that they assigned a gun battery specifically to destroy it.  They failed to achieve this and the tower remained in use until the fall of [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]].<ref>Greely, p. 311</ref>\n\nSignalmen were sometimes assigned to ships to maintain communication between the navy and land forces.  On large operations they might also be used for ship-to-ship communication.  The signalman was posted high up on the masthead of the ship.  This was especially common on operations concerning the [[Mississippi River]] such as the [[Vicksburg campaign]] and the [[Siege of Port Hudson]].<ref>Raines, p. 27</ref>\n[[File:UnionCipherDisk.nsa.jpg|thumb|upright|A Union cipher disk]]\nThe fact that the Confederates had personnel able to read the wigwag code was problematic for the Union side.  Security concerns led to a reluctance to send important messages by flag signals.  General [[Daniel Butterfield]] went so far as to order the [[Army of the Potomac]] not to use signals at all, much to the concern of its chief signal officer [[Benjamin F, Fisher]].  To overcome this problem, the Signal Corps created a [[cipher disk]] to encode messages.  It is believed that the Confederates never broke this code.<ref>Raines, p. 16</ref>  The Union side was able to read Confederate flag signals without being discovered until at least 1864 when Myer's successor as head of the Signal Corps, [[William J. L. Nicodemus]], published the fact in a pamphlet.  Nicodemus was dismissed in December 1864 for this breach of security and replaced by Fisher.<ref>Raines, pp. 22\u201323</ref>\n\nMyer did not use the term ''wigwag'' in the manuals he produced.  He called the system ''aerial signals''<ref>Myer (1872), p. </ref> or ''aerial telegraphy''.<ref>Thompson, p. 13</ref>  The system probably came to be known as wigwag because of the apparently random motions of the flag as seen by an untrained observer.<ref name=museum>US Army Signal Museum, \"Crossed flags: History of the wigwag\", United States Army Signal Center, Fort Gordon, Georgia, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070707002941/http://www.gordon.army.mil/OCOS/Museum/csrdflag.asp archived] 7 July 2007.</ref>\n\n==== Signal station gallery ====\n<gallery>\nFile:Wigwag 130 ft tower.png|A 130 foot wigwag tower used in operations against [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]<ref>Myer (1868), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag 125 ft tower.png|125 ft wigwag tower used in operations against Richmond<ref>Myer (1866), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag masthead signal station, Richmond.png|Wigwag station on the masthead of a US ship at Richmond<ref>Myer (1868), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag station near Washington.png|Wigwag station near Washington<ref>Myer (1868), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag tree station, upper Potomac.png|Wigwag station in a tree on the [[Upper Potomac River]]<ref>Myer (1872), fronispiece</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n==== Other campaigns ====\nThe Civil War was the high point of the use of wigwag, but there were some other campaigns that included flag signalmen, mainly against [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].  Signal parties accompanied general [[Patrick E. Connor]] on the [[Powder River Expedition (1865)|Powder River Expedition]] of 1865 in [[Wyoming]] and [[Montana]].  The signalmen were used to maintain communications between troop columns.<ref>Raines, pp. 26\u201327</ref>  The campaign was a punitive expedition against the [[Sioux]], [[Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]]<ref>McDermott, p.6</ref> in retaliation for raiding and disrupting travel on the [[Bozeman Trail]].  The expedition was a large operation consisting of three separate columns approaching from different directions.<ref>Coutant, ch. 36</ref>\n\nWigwag was taken up by some European countries, notably the British in African colonial wars.  It was used extensively in the [[Boer War]] in South Africa.  Once [[Morse code]] became an international standard, the British dropped the Myer code for wigwag signaling and used Morse instead with the flag movements indicating dots and dashes.  The French had a slight variation of that, using a single flag for ''dot'' and two flags for ''dash''.<ref>Woods & Sterling, p. 160</ref>\n\n=== Withdrawal ===\n[[File:Sign (8037141146).jpg|thumb|upright|US Army Signal Corp insignia featuring crossed wigwag flags and torch]]\n{{see also|Signal Corps in the American Civil War#Telegraph train and the Beardslee telegraph}}\n\nEven while the Civil War was still in progress, the electrical telegraph was starting to displace flag signaling.  This perhaps did not happen as quickly as it might have done because the US Military Telegraph was not put under the control of the Signal Corps.  Myer made repeated attempts to absorb the Military Telegraph but failed due to political rivalries.  Nevertheless, Myer was able to institute ''telegraph trains'' (that is, trains of wagons, not rail locomotives) that carried a combination of electrical telegraph and flag equipment.  The original idea was to use the [[Morse telegraph]] in the trains, but due to the unavailability of trained Morse operators to Myer, the contractor, [[Henry J. Rogers]], replaced the Morse key and sounder with a circular alphabet and pointer of his own design that could be operated by any literate person.  A further change was the replacement of acid batteries for power with a hand-cranked [[electrical generator]] invented by [[George W. Beardslee]].<ref>Raines, pp. 16\u201318</ref>  Although these changes made use in the field easier, they had serious disadvantages.  The Rogers alphabet system slowed down the speed of transmission, and the Beardslee generator was only powerful enough for short distances.  These problems resulted in occasions when the Signal Corps had to turn over its lines to the Military Telegraph with their superior equipment.  After the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in 1863 where these problems were apparent, Myer tried to recruit Morse operators through advertisements.  However, this just resulted in Myer's dismissal for exceeding his authority, and replacement by Nicodemus.  The inability of the Signal Corps to fully adopt the electrical telegraph ensured that flag signals remained in widespread use throughout the war.<ref>Raines, pp. 20\u201321</ref>\n\nMyer's code remained in use in the US until 1886 when it was replaced by Morse code.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 15</ref>  It came back into use after 1896,<ref name=museum/> but was officially discontinued in 1912 when [[International Morse code]] was mandated for all types of visual signaling. Inconsistently, [[American Morse code]] was mandated for Army electrical telegraph lines, but not for [[radio telegraphy]].<ref>Coe, p. 3</ref>  The wigwag method was superseded by [[flag semaphore]] for short distances, and the [[heliograph]] for long distances in regions where the electrical telegraph was not available.  The heliograph saw widespread use in Arizona and New Mexico after [[Nelson A. Miles]] took over command of the campaign against the [[Apache]] in 1886.<ref>Miles, pp. 481\u2013484</ref>  In good conditions, the heliograph could transmit over distances as great as 50 miles.  This is far in excess of anything achievable with flag signaling.<ref>Woods, pp. 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n== Code details ==\n=== Two-symbol code (General Service Code) ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Flag motions<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 55\u201356, plates E, F</ref>\n|-\n!Symbol!!Motion\n|-\n|1||Wave flag to ground on right\n|-\n|2||Wave flag to ground on left\n|-\n|3||Dip flag to ground in front\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Letters\n|-\n!A!!B!!C!!D!!E!!F!!G!!H!!I!!J!!K!!L!!M\n|-\n|22||2112||121||222||12||2221||2211||122||1||1122||2121||221||1221\n|-\n|\n|-\n!N!!O!!P!!Q!!R!!S!!T!!U!!V!!W!!X!!Y!!Z\n|-\n|11||21||1212||1211||211||212||2||112||1222||1121||2122||111||2222\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Common words and syllables<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 53\u201354</ref>\n|-\n!Codepoint!!Meaning\n|-\n|1111||&\n|-\n|2212||ing\n|-\n|1112||tion\n|-\n|a||after\n|-\n|b||before\n|-\n|c||can\n|-\n|h||have\n|-\n|n||not\n|-\n|r||are\n|-\n|t||the\n|-\n|u||you\n|-\n|ur||your\n|-\n|w||word\n|-\n|wi||with\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Controls<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 54\u201355</ref>\n|-\n!Codepoint!!Meaning\n|-\n|3||End of word\n|-\n|33||End of sentence\n|-\n|333||End of message\n|-\n|22.22.22.3||Understood\n|-\n|22.22.22.333||Stop sending\n|-\n|121.121.121||Repeat\n|-\n|212121||Error\n|-\n|211.211.211||Move to the right\n|-\n|221.221.221||Move to the left\n|-\n|Continuos waving||Attention\n|-\n|Two circles to right||End of address\n|-\n|Two circles to left||Start of signature\n|}\n\nNumerals could represent a control signal as well as a number.

His talents were varied, and he produced a great and extensive variety of work including portraits, woodcuts, altarpieces, drawings, tapestries, allegories and mythological motifs.\n\n==Early life==\n\nHans Baldung was born in [[Swabia]], Germany around the year 1484 to a family of intellectuals, academics and professionals. His father was a lawyer and his uncle was a doctor, and many other of his family members maintained professional degrees. In fact, Baldung was the first male in his family not to attend university, but was one of the first German artists to come from an academic family.<ref>Brady, Thomas A. \"The Social Place of a German Renaissance Artist: Hans Baldung Grien (1484/5-1545) at Strausbourg\", ''[[Central European History]]'', vol. 8, no. 4, 1975, pp. 303-304., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4545752 JSTOR]</ref> His earliest training as an artist began around 1500 in the Upper Rhineland by an artist from Strasbourg.\n\n==Life as a student of D\u00fcrer==\n[[File:Hans Baldung Grien - Die Kreuzigung Christi - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Crucifixion]]\n\nBeginning in 1503, during the \"Wanderjahre\" required of artists of the time, Baldung became an assistant to the most well renowned German artist of the day: Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Here, he may have been given his nickname \u201cGrien.\u201d This name is thought to have come foremost from a preference to the color green:  he seems to have worn green clothing. He probably also got this nickname to distinguish him from at least two other Hanses in D\u00fcrer's shop, Hans Sch\u00e4ufelein and Hans Suess von Kulmbach. He later included the name \"Grien\" in his monogram, and it has also been suggested that the name came from, or consciously echoed, \"grienhals\", a German word for witch\u2014one of his signature themes.  Hans quickly picked up D\u00fcrer's influence and style, and they became friends:  Baldung seems to have managed D\u00fcrer's workshop during the latter's second sojourn in Venice. In a later trip to the Netherlands in 1521 D\u00fcrer's account book records that he took with him and sold prints by Baldung. On D\u00fcrer's death Baldung was sent a lock of his hair, which suggests a close friendship. Near the end of his Nuremberg years, Grien oversaw the production by D\u00fcrer of stained glass, woodcuts and engravings, and therefore developed an affinity for these media and for the Nuremberg master's handing of them.\n\n==Strasbourg==\n\nIn 1509, when Baldung's time in Nuremberg was complete, he moved back to Strasbourg and became a [[Citizenship#Middle Ages|citizen there]]. He became a celebrity of the town, and received many important [[commissioner|commissions]].  The following year he married Margarethe Herlin, a local merchant's daughter,<ref>Brady, Thomas A. \"The Social Place of a German Renaissance Artist: Hans Baldung Grien (1484/5-1545) at Strausbourg\", ''[[Central European History]]'', vol. 8, no. 4, 1975, pp. 305, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4545752 JSTOR]</ref> joined the [[guild]] \"zur Steltz\", opened a workshop, and began signing his works with the HGB [[monogram]] that he used for the rest of his career. His style also became much more deliberately individual\u2014a tendency [[art historians]] used to term \"[[mannerist]].\"\n\n==Witchcraft and religious imagery==\n[[File:Hans Baldung Grien - The Trinity and Mystic Piet\u00e0 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Trinity and Mystic Piet\u00e0]]'']] \n\nIn addition to traditional religious subjects, Baldung was concerned during these years with the profane theme of the imminence of death and with scenes of sorcery and [[witchcraft]]. He helped introduce supernatural and [[Erotic art|erotic]] themes into German art, although these were already amply present in D\u00fcrer's work. Most famously, he depicted witches, also a local interest: Strasbourg's humanists studied witchcraft and its bishop was charged with finding and prosecuting witches. His most characteristic works in this area are small in scale and mostly in the medium of drawing; these include a series of puzzling, often erotic allegories and mythological works executed in pen and ink and white body color on prepared paper. The number of Hans Baldung's religious works diminished with the [[Protestant Reformation]], which generally repudiated church art as either wasteful or idolatrous. But earlier, around the same time that he produced an important chiaroscuro woodcut of Adam and Eve, the artist became interested in themes related to death, the supernatural, witchcraft, sorcery, and the relation between the sexes.  Baldung's fascination with witchcraft began early, with his first chiaroscuro print (1510) lasted to the end of his career.\n\nHans Baldung Grien's work depicting witches was produced in the first half of the 16th century, before [[witch hunting]] became a widespread cultural phenomenon in Europe. According to one view, Baldung's work did not represent widespread cultural beliefs at the time of creation but reflected largely individual choices.<ref name=\":0\">Sullivan, Margaret A. \u201cThe Witches of D\u00fcrer and Hans Baldung Grien.\u201d Renaissance Quarterly, vol. 53, no. 2, 2000, pp. 333\u2013401., www.jstor.org/stable/2901872.</ref> On the other hand, through his family, Baldung stood as closer to the leading intellectuals of the day than any of his contemporaries, and could draw on a burgeoning literature on witchcraft, as well as on developing juridical and forensic strategies for witch-hunting  <ref name=\":0\">Koerner, Joseph Leo. ''The Moment of Self-Portraiture in German Renaissance Art''.  Chicago, 1993.</ref>  Furthermore, Baldung never worked directly with any Reformation leaders to spread religious ideals through his artwork, although living in fervently religious Strasbourg,<ref>Rowlands, John. \"Washington and Yale. Hans Baldung Grien\", ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', vol. 123, no. 937, 1981, pp. 263\u2013263., [www.jstor.org/stable/880364 JSTOR]</ref> although he was a supporter of the movement, working on the high altar in the city of M\u00fcnster, Germany.<ref>Nenonen, Marko, and Raisa Maria Toivo, eds. ''Writing witch-hunt histories: challenging the paradigm''. Brill, 2013.</ref>\n\nBaldung was the first artist to heavily incorporate witches and witchcraft into his artwork (his mentor Albrecht D\u00fcrer had sporadically included them but not as prominently as Baldung would). During his lifetime there were few witch trials, therefore, some believe Baldung's depictions of witchcraft to be based on folklore rather than the cultural beliefs of his time. By contrast, throughout the early sixteenth century, [[humanism]] became very popular, and within this movement, Latin literature was valorized, particularly poetry and satire, some of which included views on witches that could be combined with witch lore massively accumulated in works such as the Malleus Maleficarum. Baldung partook in this culture, producing not only many works depicting Strasbourg humanists and scenes from ancient art and literature, but what an earlier literature on the artist described as his satirical take on his depiction of witches. Gert von der Osten comments on this aspect of \"Baldung [treating] his witches humorously, an attitude that reflects the dominant viewpoint of the humanists in Strasbourg at this time who viewed witchcraft as 'lustig,' a matter that was more amusing than serious\".<ref name=\":0\" /> However, the separation of a satirical tone from deadly serious vilifying intent proves difficult to maintain for Baldung as it is for many other artists, including his rough contemporary [[Hieronymus Bosch]].  Baldung's art simultaneously represents ideals presented in ancient Greek and Roman poetry, such as the pre-16th century notion that witches could control the weather, which Baldung is believed to have alluded to in his 1523 oil painting \"Weather Witches\", which showcases two attractive and naked witches in front of a stormy sky.<ref name=\":0\" />  \n\nBaldung also regularly incorporated scenes of witches flying in his art, a characteristic that had been contested centuries before his artwork came into being. Flying was inherently attributed to witches by those who believed in the myth of the Sabbath (without their ability to fly, the myth fragmented), such as Baldung, which he depicted in works like \"Witches Preparing for the Sabbath Flight\" (1514).<ref>Hults, Linda C. \"Baldung and the Witches of Freiburg: The Evidence of Images\", ''The Journal of Interdisciplinary History'', vol. 18, no. 2, 1987, pp. 249\u2013276., [www.jstor.org/stable/204283 JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==Work==\n\n===Painting===\n[[File:Hans Baldung Grien - Bildnis einer Dame (Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza).jpg|thumb|Throughout his life, Baldung painted numerous portraits, known for their sharp characterizations.]]\n\nThroughout his life, Baldung painted numerous portraits, known for their sharp characterizations. While D\u00fcrer rigorously details his models, Baldung's style differs by focusing more on the personality of the represented character, an abstract conception of the model's state of mind. Baldung settled eventually in Strasbourg and then to Freiburg im Breisgau, where he executed what is held to be his masterpiece. Here in painted an eleven-panel altarpiece for the Freiburg Cathedral, still intact today, depicting scenes from the life of the Virgin, including, The Annunciation, The Visitation, The Nativity, The Flight into Egypt, The Crucifixion, Four Saints and The Donators. These depictions were a large part of the artist's greater body of work containing several renowned pieces of the Virgin.{{sfn|Cleef|1907}}\n\nThe earliest pictures assigned to him by some are altar-pieces with the monogram '''H. B.''' interlaced, and the date of 1496, in the monastery chapel of Lichtenthal near [[Baden-Baden]]. Another early work is a portrait of the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Maximilian]], drawn in 1501 on a leaf of a sketch-book now in the print-room at [[Karlsruhe]]. \"The Martyrdom of St Sebastian and the Epiphany\" (now Berlin, 1507), were painted for the market-church of [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] in Saxony.{{sfn|Ashby|1911|p=640}}\n\nBaldung's [[old master print|prints]], though D\u00fcreresque, are very individual in style, and often in subject. They show little direct Italian influence. His paintings are less important than his prints. He worked mainly in [[woodcut]], although he made six [[engraving]]s, one very fine. He joined in the fashion for [[chiaroscuro woodcut]]s, adding a tone block to a woodcut of 1510.  Most of his hundreds of woodcuts were commissioned for books, as was usual at the time; his \"single-leaf\" woodcuts (i.e. prints not for book illustration) are fewer than 100, though no two catalogues agree as to the exact number.\n\nUnconventional as a draughtsman, his treatment of human form is often exaggerated and eccentric (hence his linkage, in the art historical literature, with European [[Mannerism]]), whilst his ornamental style\u2014profuse, eclectic, and akin to the self-consciously \"German\" strain of contemporary [[Tilia|limewood]] sculptors\u2014is equally distinctive.  Though Baldung has been commonly called the [[Correggio]] of the north, his compositions are a curious medley of glaring and heterogeneous colours, in which pure black is contrasted with pale yellow, dirty grey, impure red and glowing green. Flesh is a mere glaze under which the features are indicated by lines.{{sfn|Ashby|1911|p=640}}\n\nHis works are notable for their individualistic departure from the Renaissance composure of his model, D\u00fcrer, for the wild and fantastic strength that some of them display, and for their remarkable themes.  In the field of painting, his ''[[Eve, the Serpent and Death]]'' ([[National Gallery of Canada]]) shows his strengths well.  There is special force in the \"Death and the Maiden\" panel of 1517 (Basel), in the \"Weather Witches\" (Frankfurt), in the monumental panels of \"Adam\" and \"Eve\" (Madrid), and in his many powerful portraits. Baldung's most sustained effort is the altarpiece of Freiburg, where the Coronation of the Virgin, and the Twelve Apostles, the Annunciation, Visitation, Nativity and Flight into Egypt, and the Crucifixion, with [[donor portrait|portraits of donors]], are executed with some of that fanciful power that [[Martin Schongauer]] bequeathed to the [[Swabian school]].{{sfn|Ashby|1911|p=640}}\n\nAs a portrait painter he is well known. He drew [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], as well as Maximilian; and his bust of Margrave Philip in the Munich Gallery tells us that he was connected with the reigning family of Baden as early as 1514. At a later period he had sittings with Margrave Christopher of Baden, Ottilia his wife, and all their children, and the picture containing these portraits is still in the gallery at Karlsruhe. Like D\u00fcrer and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]], Baldung supported the [[Protestant Reformation]]. He was present at the [[diet of Augsburg]] in 1518, and one of his [[woodcut]]s represents [[Martin Luther|Luther]] in quasi-saintly guise, under the protection of (or being inspired by) the Holy Spirit, which hovers over him in the shape of a dove.{{sfn|Ashby|1911|p=640}}\n\n==Selected works==\n[[File:Hans Baldung - Mater Dolorosa (detail) - WGA01206.jpg|thumb|Hans Baldung - Mater Dolorosa (detail)]]\n\n*Two altar wings (Charles the Great, St. George), Augsburg, State Gallery.\n*The birth Christ, Basel, Kunstmuseum Basel, 1510\n*The crucifixion of Christ, Basel, Kunstmuseum Basel,  1512\n*Death and the Maiden, Basel, Kunstmuseum Basel, 1517\n*The crucifixion of Christ, Berlin, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, 1512\n*The Lamentation of Christ, Berlin, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, 1516\n*Pyramus and Thisbe, Berlin, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, around 1530\n*The Mass of St. Gregory, Cleveland, Cleveland Museum of Art, 1511\n*Christ as a gardener, Darmstadt, Hessen State Museum, 1539\n*The Adoration of the Magi, Dessau, Anhalt Art Gallery, 1510\n*Adam and Eva, Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi - Uffizi  \n*Frankfurt am Main, St\u00e4del The Baptism of Christ . 1518\n*Portrait of a youth, Hampton Court, Royal Collection  1509\n*The unlikely couple, Liverpool, Walker Art Gallery, 1527\n*Portrait of a man, London, National Gallery, 1514 \n* [[The Three Ages of Man and Death]], Museo del Prado, Madrid\n*The Holy Trinity, London, National Gallery, 1512\n*Venus with Cupid, Otterlo, Rijksmuseum Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller, 1525\n*Phyllis and Aristotle, Paris, Louvre . 1503\n*Stockholm, National Museum Mercury as a planet God . for 1530-1540\n*Vienna, Paintings Gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts The Rest on the Flight into Egypt . 1513\n\n{{Clear}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\" 135px\" caption=\"Selected works\">\nFile:Hans Baldung - Die Heilige Jungfrau als K\u00f6nigin des Himmels mit dem Christkind.jpg|The Virgin as Queen of Heaven with the Christ Child in her arms\nFile:Hans Baldung - Mater Dolorosa - WGA01205.jpg|Mater Dolorosa \nFile:Hans Baldung Grien - Ruhe auf der Flucht der heiligen Familie nach \u00c4gypten.jpg|''Ruhe auf der Flucht der heiligen Familie nach \u00c4gypten''\nFile:Baldung FR Hochaltar.02.JPG|Nativity\nFile:Hans Baldung Grien - Venus and Amor - Google Art Project.jpg| Venus and Amor \nFile:Hans Baldung Grien - Adam - Google Art Project.jpg|Hans Baldung Grien - Adam \nFile:Hans Baldung Grien - Eve - Google Art Project.jpg|Hans Baldung Grien - Eve \nFile:Hans Baldung - The Three Graces - WGA01196.jpg|[[Charites|The Three Graces]]\nFile:Hans Baldung called Grien - Lucretia - Google Art Project.jpg| Lucretia.

Here in painted an eleven-panel altarpiece for the Freiburg Cathedral, still intact today, depicting scenes from the life of the Virgin, including, The Annunciation, The Visitation, The Nativity, The Flight into Egypt, The Crucifixion, Four Saints and The Donators. These depictions were a large part of the artist's greater body of work containing several renowned pieces of the Virgin.{{sfn|Cleef|1907}}\n\nThe earliest pictures assigned to him by some are altar-pieces with the monogram '''H. B.''' interlaced, and the date of 1496, in the monastery chapel of Lichtenthal near [[Baden-Baden]]. Another early work is a portrait of the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Maximilian]], drawn in 1501 on a leaf of a sketch-book now in the print-room at [[Karlsruhe]]. \"The Martyrdom of St Sebastian and the Epiphany\" (now Berlin, 1507), were painted for the market-church of [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] in Saxony.{{sfn|Ashby|1911|p=640}}\n\nBaldung's [[old master print|prints]], though D\u00fcreresque, are very individual in style, and often in subject. They show little direct Italian influence. His paintings are less important than his prints. He worked mainly in [[woodcut]], although he made six [[engraving]]s, one very fine. He joined in the fashion for [[chiaroscuro woodcut]]s, adding a tone block to a woodcut of 1510.  Most of his hundreds of woodcuts were commissioned for books, as was usual at the time; his \"single-leaf\" woodcuts (i.e. prints not for book illustration) are fewer than 100, though no two catalogues agree as to the exact number.\n\nUnconventional as a draughtsman, his treatment of human form is often exaggerated and eccentric (hence his linkage, in the art historical literature, with European [[Mannerism]]), whilst his ornamental style\u2014profuse, eclectic, and akin to the self-consciously \"German\" strain of contemporary [[Tilia|limewood]] sculptors\u2014is equally distinctive.  Though Baldung has been commonly called the [[Correggio]] of the north, his compositions are a curious medley of glaring and heterogeneous colours, in which pure black is contrasted with pale yellow, dirty grey, impure red and glowing green. Flesh is a mere glaze under which the features are indicated by lines.{{sfn|Ashby|1911|p=640}}\n\nHis works are notable for their individualistic departure from the Renaissance composure of his model, D\u00fcrer, for the wild and fantastic strength that some of them display, and for their remarkable themes.  In the field of painting, his ''[[Eve, the Serpent and Death]]'' ([[National Gallery of Canada]]) shows his strengths well.  There is special force in the \"Death and the Maiden\" panel of 1517 (Basel), in the \"Weather Witches\" (Frankfurt), in the monumental panels of \"Adam\" and \"Eve\" (Madrid), and in his many powerful portraits. Baldung's most sustained effort is the altarpiece of Freiburg, where the Coronation of the Virgin, and the Twelve Apostles, the Annunciation, Visitation, Nativity and Flight into Egypt, and the Crucifixion, with [[donor portrait|portraits of donors]], are executed with some of that fanciful power that [[Martin Schongauer]] bequeathed to the [[Swabian school]].{{sfn|Ashby|1911|p=640}}\n\nAs a portrait painter he is well known. He drew [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], as well as Maximilian; and his bust of Margrave Philip in the Munich Gallery tells us that he was connected with the reigning family of Baden as early as 1514. At a later period he had sittings with Margrave Christopher of Baden, Ottilia his wife, and all their children, and the picture containing these portraits is still in the gallery at Karlsruhe. Like D\u00fcrer and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]], Baldung supported the [[Protestant Reformation]]. He was present at the [[diet of Augsburg]] in 1518, and one of his [[woodcut]]s represents [[Martin Luther|Luther]] in quasi-saintly guise, under the protection of (or being inspired by) the Holy Spirit, which hovers over him in the shape of a dove.{{sfn|Ashby|1911|p=640}}\n\n==Selected works==\n[[File:Hans Baldung - Mater Dolorosa (detail) - WGA01206.jpg|thumb|Hans Baldung - Mater Dolorosa (detail)]]\n\n*Two altar wings (Charles the Great, St. George), Augsburg, State Gallery.\n*The birth Christ, Basel, Kunstmuseum Basel, 1510\n*The crucifixion of Christ, Basel, Kunstmuseum Basel,  1512\n*Death and the Maiden, Basel, Kunstmuseum Basel, 1517\n*The crucifixion of Christ, Berlin, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, 1512\n*The Lamentation of Christ, Berlin, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, 1516\n*Pyramus and Thisbe, Berlin, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, around 1530\n*The Mass of St. Gregory, Cleveland, Cleveland Museum of Art, 1511\n*Christ as a gardener, Darmstadt, Hessen State Museum, 1539\n*The Adoration of the Magi, Dessau, Anhalt Art Gallery, 1510\n*Adam and Eva, Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi - Uffizi  \n*Frankfurt am Main, St\u00e4del The Baptism of Christ . 1518\n*Portrait of a youth, Hampton Court, Royal Collection  1509\n*The unlikely couple, Liverpool, Walker Art Gallery, 1527\n*Portrait of a man, London, National Gallery, 1514 \n* [[The Three Ages of Man and Death]], Museo del Prado, Madrid\n*The Holy Trinity, London, National Gallery, 1512\n*Venus with Cupid, Otterlo, Rijksmuseum Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller, 1525\n*Phyllis and Aristotle, Paris, Louvre . 1503\n*Stockholm, National Museum Mercury as a planet God . for 1530-1540\n*Vienna, Paintings Gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts The Rest on the Flight into Egypt . 1513\n\n{{Clear}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\" 135px\" caption=\"Selected works\">\nFile:Hans Baldung - Die Heilige Jungfrau als K\u00f6nigin des Himmels mit dem Christkind.jpg|The Virgin as Queen of Heaven with the Christ Child in her arms\nFile:Hans Baldung - Mater Dolorosa - WGA01205.jpg|Mater Dolorosa \nFile:Hans Baldung Grien - Ruhe auf der Flucht der heiligen Familie nach \u00c4gypten.jpg|''Ruhe auf der Flucht der heiligen Familie nach \u00c4gypten''\nFile:Baldung FR Hochaltar.02.JPG|Nativity\nFile:Hans Baldung Grien - Venus and Amor - Google Art Project.jpg| Venus and Amor \nFile:Hans Baldung Grien - Adam - Google Art Project.jpg|Hans Baldung Grien - Adam \nFile:Hans Baldung Grien - Eve - Google Art Project.jpg|Hans Baldung Grien - Eve \nFile:Hans Baldung - The Three Graces - WGA01196.jpg|[[Charites|The Three Graces]]\nFile:Hans Baldung called Grien - Lucretia - Google Art Project.jpg| Lucretia.

{"title_page": "Quarter-inch cartridge", "text_new": "{{other uses|Cartridge (disambiguation)}}\n\n'''Quarter inch cartridge''' tape (abbreviated '''QIC''', commonly pronounced \"quick\") is a [[magnetic tape data storage]] format introduced by [[3M]] in 1972,<ref name=\"IBM\"/> with derivatives still in use as of 2016. QIC comes in a rugged enclosed package of aluminum and plastic that holds two tape reels driven by a single belt in direct contact with the tape. The tape was originally {{convert|1/4|in|mm|sigfig=3}} wide and anywhere from {{convert|300|to|1500|ft|m}} long. Data is written linearly along the length of the tape in one track<ref name=\"IBM\"/> (mostly on pre-1980 equipment), or written \"serpentine\", one track at a time, the drive reversing direction at the end of the tape, and each track's data written in the opposite direction to its neighbor. Since its introduction, it has been widely used, and many variations exist. There is a QIC trade association that publishes QIC standards which include interfaces and logical formats. To a very large extent it was the efficiency and openness of this organization which encouraged hardware and software developers to use this type of drive and media.\n[[Image:Quarter-Inch Cartridges.jpg|thumb|Quarter inch cartridges: left, 400MB (QIC-EX); right, 120MB (QIC-80).]]\n\n== Features of QIC ==\n\nThe QIC cartridge is distinguished from other types of tape cartridges by containing an endless drive belt which is moved at a uniform speed by a motorised [[Capstan (tape recorder)|capstan]]. Since the belt is in contact with the tape, this ensures both that the tape moves at uniform speed, and that neutral tension is maintained at all times. This is in contrast to [[cassette tape]]s or [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]]s, where the tape is moved past the head by a capstan and pinch wheel, but the takeup reel is driven by a [[servo motor]] or slipping clutch.\n\nThe tape in a QIC cartridge is not physically attached to the reels and is never completely unwound. This is again different from other cassettes or cartridges, which generally have some form of clip anchoring on at least one end of the tape. To ensure that the tape is never completely unwound, each end has a small beginning or end of tape hole which is detected by an optical sensor, and an \"early warning\" hole further from each end. If a defective drive&mdash;for example with fluff in a sensor&mdash;winds the tape past the BOT or EOT marker, the tape will detach from the spool and the cartridge will be unusable unless it is reattached.\n\nThe design of the QIC tape cartridge is very robust: the aluminium baseplate is {{convert|1/10|in|mm|sigfig=3}} thick, and the robust plastic cover can withstand abuse and impacts that would damage other tape formats.\n\nHowever, because the tape is belt-driven, seeking back and forth can eventually cause the tape to become unevenly tensioned. It is therefore necessary to periodically retension the cartridge. This is accomplished by winding the tape from beginning to end and back in one operation, allowing the belt to equalize itself. For newer QIC drives that use a [[SCSI]] interface, there is a SCSI \"RETENSION\" command to do this.\n\nWhen the cartridge gets old, the belt may not provide enough friction to turn the takeup spool smoothly. When this happens, the tape will need to be replaced.\n\nIn some cases a cartridge must be formatted before use. The capability to do this is in the drive rather than the host computer.\n\n== Generations ==\n\n=== 3M Data Cartridge (DC) ===\n\n[[File:QIC DC600A.jpg|thumb|right|200px|QIC DC 600A cassette.]]\n[[Image:SunOS 4.1.1 P1270750.jpg|thumb|[[SunOS]] 4.1.1 QIC-24 tape.]]\nThe first QIC tape format was the {{convert|5+7/8|in|mm}} by {{convert|3+7/8|in|mm}} ''Data Cartridge'' (DC) format with two internal belt-driven reels and a metal base.

QIC comes in a rugged enclosed package of aluminum and plastic that holds two tape reels driven by a single belt in direct contact with the tape. The tape was originally {{convert|1/4|in|mm|sigfig=3}} wide and anywhere from {{convert|300|to|1500|ft|m}} long. Data is written linearly along the length of the tape in one track<ref name=\"IBM\"/> (mostly on pre-1980 equipment), or written \"serpentine\", one track at a time, the drive reversing direction at the end of the tape, and each track's data written in the opposite direction to its neighbor. Since its introduction, it has been widely used, and many variations exist. There is a QIC trade association that publishes QIC standards which include interfaces and logical formats. To a very large extent it was the efficiency and openness of this organization which encouraged hardware and software developers to use this type of drive and media.\n[[Image:Quarter-Inch Cartridges.jpg|thumb|Quarter inch cartridges: left, 400MB (QIC-EX); right, 120MB (QIC-80).]]\n\n== Features of QIC ==\n\nThe QIC cartridge is distinguished from other types of tape cartridges by containing an endless drive belt which is moved at a uniform speed by a motorised [[Capstan (tape recorder)|capstan]]. Since the belt is in contact with the tape, this ensures both that the tape moves at uniform speed, and that neutral tension is maintained at all times. This is in contrast to [[Compact audio cassette|cassette tape]]s or [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]]s, where the tape is moved past the head by a capstan and pinch wheel, but the takeup reel is driven by a [[servo motor]] or slipping clutch.\n\nThe tape in a QIC cartridge is not physically attached to the reels and is never completely unwound. This is again different from other cassettes or cartridges, which generally have some form of clip anchoring on at least one end of the tape. To ensure that the tape is never completely unwound, each end has a small beginning or end of tape hole which is detected by an optical sensor, and an \"early warning\" hole further from each end. If a defective drive&mdash;for example with fluff in a sensor&mdash;winds the tape past the BOT or EOT marker, the tape will detach from the spool and the cartridge will be unusable unless it is reattached.\n\nThe design of the QIC tape cartridge is very robust: the aluminium baseplate is {{convert|1/10|in|mm|sigfig=3}} thick, and the robust plastic cover can withstand abuse and impacts that would damage other tape formats.\n\nHowever, because the tape is belt-driven, seeking back and forth can eventually cause the tape to become unevenly tensioned. It is therefore necessary to periodically retension the cartridge. This is accomplished by winding the tape from beginning to end and back in one operation, allowing the belt to equalize itself. For newer QIC drives that use a [[SCSI]] interface, there is a SCSI \"RETENSION\" command to do this.\n\nWhen the cartridge gets old, the belt may not provide enough friction to turn the takeup spool smoothly. When this happens, the tape will need to be replaced.\n\nIn some cases a cartridge must be formatted before use. The capability to do this is in the drive rather than the host computer.\n\n== Generations ==\n\n=== 3M Data Cartridge (DC) ===\n\n[[File:QIC DC600A.jpg|thumb|right|200px|QIC DC 600A cassette.]]\n[[Image:SunOS 4.1.1 P1270750.jpg|thumb|[[SunOS]] 4.1.1 QIC-24 tape.]]\nThe first QIC tape format was the {{convert|5+7/8|in|mm}} by {{convert|3+7/8|in|mm}} ''Data Cartridge'' (DC) format with two internal belt-driven reels and a metal base.
