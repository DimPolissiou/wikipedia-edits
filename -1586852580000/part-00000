From December 1979 to September 1980, he was the country's ''de facto'' leader, ruling as an unelected military strongman with civilian president [[Choi Kyu-hah]] largely as a figurehead. Chun was sentenced to death in 1996 for his role in the [[Gwangju Massacre]] but was later pardoned by President [[Kim Young-sam]], with the advice of then President-elect [[Kim Dae-jung]], whom Chun's administration had sentenced to death some 20 years earlier.\n\n==Early life and education==\nChun was born on 18 January 1931 in Yulgok-myeon, a poor farming town in [[Hapcheon]], [[Gyeongsangnam-do|South Gyeongsang]] province, during [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule over Korea]].

Chun grew up knowing his remaining older brother Ki-hwan and his younger brother Kyeong-hwan.\n\nAround 1936, Chun's family moved to [[Daegu|Taegu]], where he began attending Horan Elementary School. Chun's father had run-ins with the [[kempeitai|Japanese police]] in the past, and in the winter of 1939 he murdered a police captain.<ref name=father/> Their family immediately fled to [[Jilin]], [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]], where they stayed in hiding for two years before returning. When Chun finally started attending elementary school again, he was 2 years behind his original classmates.\n\nIn 1947, Chun began attending Daegu Vocational Middle School, located nearly 25&nbsp;km from his home.<ref name=father/> Chun moved on to Daegu Vocational High School.\n\n==Military career==\nAfter graduating from high school in 1951, Chun gained entry into the [[Korea Military Academy]] (KMA). While there, he made several key friends among the students who would later play instrumental roles in helping Chun to seize control of the country. He graduated in February 1955 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree and a commission as a second lieutenant in the 11th class of the KMA. He later trained in the United States, specializing in [[guerilla tactics]] and [[psychological warfare]], and married Rhee Soon-ja, the daughter of the KMA's commandant at the time of his attendance, in 1958.<ref name=presidential>{{Cite web|publisher = Presidential Archives, [[National Archives of Korea]]| script-title=ko:\uc804\ub450\ud658\ub300\ud1b5\ub839 > \uacbd\ub825\ubc0f \uc0c1\ud6c8\uc0ac\ud56d |trans-title=President Chun Doo-hwan > Career and awards |language =Korean | url = http://www.pa.go.kr/usr/cms/pre_0301_035.do| accessdate =31 October 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name=nateperson>{{Cite web|script-title=ko:\uc804\ub450\ud658|trans-title=Chun Doo-hwan|publisher=[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] People (Nate \uc778\ubb3c\uac80\uc0c9)|url=http://people.nate.com/people/info/ch/un/chundoowhan/|accessdate=4 November 2009|language=Korean|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501064629/http://people.nate.com/people/info/ch/un/chundoowhan/|archivedate=1 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nChun, then a captain, led a demonstration at the KMA to show support for the [[May 16 coup]] led by [[Park Chung-hee]]. Chun was subsequently made secretary to the commander of the [[Supreme Council for National Reconstruction]],<ref name=presidential/><ref name=nateperson/> placing him directly under Park. Chun was quickly promoted to major in 1962, while continuing to make powerful friends and acquaintances. As a major, Chun was the deputy chief of operations for the [[Republic of Korea Army Special Warfare Command|Special Warfare Command]]'s battle headquarters, and later worked for the Supreme Council for Reconstruction again as the Chief Civil Affairs Officer. In 1963, Chun was given a position in the [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|Korean Central Intelligence Agency]] (KCIA) as Personnel Director. By 1969, he was senior advisor to the Army Chief of Staff.<ref name=presidential/><ref name=nateperson/>\n\nIn 1970, holding the rank of colonel, Chun became the commander of the 29th Regiment, [[9th Infantry Division (Republic of Korea)|South Korean 9th Infantry Division]], and participated in the [[Vietnam War]]. Upon returning to Korea in 1971, he was given command of the 1st Special Forces Brigade (Airborne) and later promoted to brigadier general. In 1976 he worked as the deputy chief of the [[Presidential Security Service]] and was promoted to the rank of major general during his time there. In 1978 he became the commanding officer of the [[1st Infantry Division (Republic of Korea)|1st Infantry Division]].<ref name=presidential/><ref name=nateperson/>\n\nFinally, in 1979, he was appointed commander of [[Defense Security Command|Security Command]], his highest position yet.\n\n==Rise to power==\n\n===Hanahoe===\nChun formed [[Hanahoe]] as a secret military club shortly after his promotion to [[general officer]]. It was predominantly composed of his fellow graduates from the 11th class of the Korea Military Academy, as well as other friends and supporters. The membership to this secret club was predominately restricted to officers from the Gyeongsang Provinces with just a token membership reserved for a Cholla Provinces' officer. This secret organization's existence within a highly regimented and rigid hierarchical organization of the army was only possible because it was under the patronage of then President Park Chung-hee.\n\n===Assassination of Park Chung-hee===\n{{Main|Assassination of Park Chung-hee}}\nOn 26 October 1979, South Korean President [[Park Chung-hee]] was assassinated by [[Kim Jae-kyu]], Director of the [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|KCIA]], while at a dinner party. Secretly, Kim had invited General [[Jeong Seung-hwa]], Army Chief of Staff, and Kim Jeong-seop, Vice-Deputy Director of the KCIA, to dinner in another room that night as well. Although Jeong Seung-hwa was neither present during nor involved in the shooting of the President, his involvement later proved crucial. In the chaos that followed, Kim Jae-kyu was not arrested for many hours, as details of the incident were initially unclear.\n\nAfter some confusion over the constitutional procedures for presidential succession, Prime Minister [[Choi Kyu-ha]] finally ascended to the position of Acting President. Soon after, Jeong named Chun's Security Command to head up the investigation into the mysterious assassination. Chun immediately ordered his subordinates to draw up plans for the creation of an all-powerful \"Joint Investigation Headquarters\".<ref name=intel>{{cite news|author =[[Cho Gab-je|Cho, Gab-je]] (\uc870\uac11\uc81c) |author2=Lee, Dong-uk (\uc774\ub3d9\uc6b1)| script-title=ko:(\ubc15\uc815\ud76c\uc758 \uc0dd\uc560) \"\ub0b4 \ubb34\ub364\uc5d0 \uce68\uc744 \ubc49\uc5b4\ub77c!\"...(48)|trans-title=(Biography of Park Chung-hee) \"Spit on my grave!\"...

Invited were four key individuals now responsible for all intelligence collection nationwide: KCIA Deputy Chief of Foreign Affairs, KCIA Deputy Chief of Domestic Affairs, Attorney General, and Chief of the National Police.<ref name=intel/> Chun had each person searched at the door on his way in, before having them seated and informing them of the President's death. Chun declared the KCIA held full responsibility for the President's assassination, and its organization was therefore under investigation for the crime. Chun stated that the KCIA would no longer be allowed to exercise its own budget:\n\n{{quote|For the KCIA \"to continue exercising full discretion of their budget is unacceptable. Therefore, they are only allowed to execute their duties upon receiving authorization from the Joint Investigation Headquarters.\"|Chun Doo-hwan, ''Security Command'' and ''Joint Investigation Headquarters'' commander, 27 October 1979}}\n\nChun subsequently ordered all intelligence reports to now be sent to his office at 8:00&nbsp;am and 5:00&nbsp;pm every day, so he could decide what information to give higher command. In one move, Chun had taken control of the entire nation's intelligence organizations. Chun then put the KCIA Deputy Chief of Foreign Affairs in charge of running the day-to-day business of the KCIA.\n\nMajor Park Jun-kwang, working under Chun at the time, later commented:\n\n{{quote|In front of the most powerful organizations under the Park Chung-hee presidency, it surprised me how easily [Chun] gained control over them and how skillfully he took advantage of the circumstances. In an instant he seemed to have grown into a giant.|Park Jun-kwang, assigned to ''Security Command'' and ''Joint Investigation Headquarters''}}\n\nDuring the investigation and concerned for the welfare of President Park's family, Chun personally gave money (US$500,000) from Park's slush fund to [[Park Geun-hye]], who was 27 at the time. He was reprimanded for this by General Jeong.<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/24/chun-doo-whan-south-kore_n_3490372.html</ref>\n\n===12 December coup d\u2019\u00e9tat===\n{{Main|Coup d'\u00e9tat of December Twelfth}}\nIn the following month Chun, along with [[Roh Tae-woo]], Yu Hak-seong, Heo Sam-su, and others from the 11th graduating class of the KMA, continued taking advantage of the fragile political situation to grow Hanahoe's strength, courting key commanders and subverting the nation's intelligence gathering organizations.\n\nOn 12 December 1979, Chun ordered the arrest of Army Chief of Staff Jeong Seung-hwa on charges of conspiring with Kim Jae-kyu to assassinate the President. This order was made without authorization from President Choi. On the night of Jeong's capture, 29th Regiment, [[9th Infantry Division (Republic of Korea)|9th Division]], along with the 1st and 3rd Airborne Brigades, invaded downtown Seoul to support the 30th and 33rd Security Group loyal to Chun, then a series of conflicts broke out in the capital. [[Jang Tae-wan]], commander of the Capital Garrison Command and Jeong Byeong Ju, commander of the special forces, were also arrested by the rebel troops. Major Kim Oh-rang, Aide-de-camp of General Jeong Byeong-ju, was killed during the gun-fight. By the next morning, the Ministry of Defense and Army HQ were all occupied, and Chun was in firm control of the military. For all intents and purposes, he was now the de facto leader of the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nIn early 1980, Chun was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general, and he took up the position of acting director of the KCIA. On 14 April, Chun was officially installed as director of the KCIA.\n\n====Gwangju Democratization Movement and military intervention====\n{{Further|Coup d'\u00e9tat of May Seventeenth|Gwangju Democratization Movement}}\n[[File:Gwangju5.18FriedhofFotos.JPG|thumb|Memorial Hall in the [[May 18th National Cemetery]] in Gwangju where victims' bodies were buried]]\nOn 17 May 1980, Chun expanded martial law to the entire country, due to rumors of North Korean infiltration into South Korea. To enforce the martial law, troops were dispatched to various parts of the nation. The KCIA manipulated these rumors under the command of Chun. General [[John A. Wickham, Jr.|John A. Wickham]] ([[US Forces Korea|US Armed Forces in Korea]]) reported that Chun's pessimistic assessment of the domestic situation and his stress on the North Korean threat only seemed to be a pretext for a move into the [[Blue House]] (the Korean presidential residence).<ref>The US Government Statement on the Events in Gwangju, Republic of Korea, in May 1980</ref> The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities and further curtailed the press. The event of 17 May meant the beginning of another military dictatorship.\n\nMany townsfolk were growing unhappy with the military presence in their cities, and on 18 May, the citizens of [[Gwangju]] organized into what became known as the Gwangju Democratization Movement. Chun ordered it to be immediately suppressed, sending in crack military troops with tanks and helicopter gunships to retake City Hall and ordered the troops to exercise full force. This led to a bloody massacre over the next two days, ultimately leading to the collapse of the Gwangju Democratization Movement and the deaths of several hundred Gwangju activists. For this, he was called \"The Butcher of Gwangju\" by many people, especially among the students.\n\n====Path to the Presidency====\nIn June 1980, Chun ordered the National Assembly to be dissolved. He subsequently created the Special Committee for National Security Measures (SCNSM), a [[Military junta|Junta]]-like organization, and installed himself as a member. On 17 July, he resigned his position as KCIA Director, and then held only the position of committee member.\n\nOn 5 August, with full control of the military he was self-promoted to four star General and on 22 August he was discharged from active duty to the Army reserves.\n\n====Samchung Re-education Camp====\nBeginning in August 1980, citizens were subjected to organized violence under the name of social cleansing, which aimed at the elimination of social ills, such as violence, smuggling, drugs and deceptions. They were arrested without proper warrants and given [[ex parte]] rankings. Some 42,000 victims were enrolled in the [[Samchung re-education camp]] for \"purificatory education\". More than 60,000 people were arrested in six months between August 1980 and January 1981, including many innocent citizens. They faced violence and hard labour in the Re-education Camp.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hurights.or.jp/archives/newsinbrief-en/section1/2006/09/national-human-rights-commission-of-korea-recommended-equal-compensations-for-foreign-victims-of-sam.html |publisher=Hurights Osaka |title=National Human Rights Commission of Korea Recommended Equal Compensations for Foreign Victims of \"Samchung Re-education Camp\" |accessdate=6 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Fifth Republic==\n[[File:Chun Doo-hwan and Lee SoonJa.jpg|thumb|President Chun, and his wife, Rhee Soon-ja, prepare to depart after their visit to [[Washington D.C.]] in 1981.]]\n\n===President of South Korea (1980\u20131988)===\nIn August 1980, Choi, who had long since become little more than a figurehead, announced that he would be resigning the presidency. On [[1980 South Korean presidential election|27 August]], the National Conference for Unification, the nation's electoral college, gathered in Jang Choong Gymnasium. Chun was the sole candidate.  Out of 2525 members, 2524 voted for Chun with 1 vote counted as invalid, thus with a tally of 99.99% in favor (it was widely speculated at that time that 1 invalid vote was purposely rigged as to differentiate Chun from North Korea's [[Kim Il Sung]], who regularly claimed 100% support in North Korea's elections). He was officially inaugurated into office on 1 September 1980.\n\nOn 17 October, he abolished all political parties \u2014including Park's [[Democratic Republican Party (South Korea)|Democratic Republican Party]], which had essentially ruled the country as a one-party state since the imposition of the Yushin Constitution. In January 1981, Chun formed his own party, the [[Democratic Justice Party]]; however, for all intents and purposes, it was Park's Democratic Republican Party under another name. Soon afterward, a new constitution was enacted that, while far less authoritarian than Park's Yusin Constitution, still gave fairly broad powers to the president. \n\nHe was then re-elected president by the National Conference [[1981 South Korean presidential election|that February]], taking 90 percent of the delegates' vote against three minor candidates. However, Chun's election was a foregone conclusion after the DJP won a large majority of seats at elections for the National Conference two weeks earlier, with three times as many seats as the independents and nine times as many seats as the opposition [[Democratic Korea Party]].\n\n====Missile memorandum====\nIn 1980, in the face of increased tension with the U.S. over his military takeover, President Chun issued a memorandum stating that his country would not develop missiles with a range longer than 180&nbsp;km or capable of carrying greater than a 453&nbsp;kg warhead. After receiving this promise, the [[Reagan administration]] decided to fully recognize Chun's military government.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nIn the late 1990s, South Korea and the U.S. held talks on the issue and, rather than scrap the memorandum completely, they came to an agreement allowing missiles up to 300&nbsp;km in range and capability to carry up to a 500&nbsp;kg warhead. This compromise came into effect in 2001 under the name [[Missile Technology Control Regime]].\n\n====From 1981 to 1988====\n[[File:Chun Doo-hwan, 1985-Mar-22.jpg|thumb|President Chun Doo-hwan, attending a 1985 military briefing]]\nAfter his election in 1981, Chun completely rejected the presidency of Park, even going so far as to strike all references to Park's [[May 16 coup|1961 military coup]] from the constitution. Chun announced that he would be restoring justice to the government to remove the fraud and corruption of Park's tenure.<ref name=bookworld>{{Cite book| author =Jeon, Jae-ho (\uc804\uc7ac\ud638)| script-title=ko:\ubc18\ub3d9\uc801 \uadfc\ub300\uc8fc\uc758\uc790 \ubc15\uc815\ud76c |trans-title=Reactionary Modernist, Park Chung-hee (''Bandongjeok geundaejuuija Bak Jeong-hui'')| publisher = \ucc45\uc138\uc0c1 (Chaeksesang)| year = 2000| location = South Korea| pages = 112\u2013113| isbn = 978-89-7013-148-1 |language=Korean}}</ref>\n\n====South Korean nuclear weapons program====\nChun's government did not have the considerable political influence enjoyed by Park Chung-hee's administration.

In September 1980, Chun repealed \"guilt by association\" laws. In 1981, Chun enacted \"Care and Custody\" legislation; Chun believed that criminals who finish their prison time for a repeat offense should not be immediately returned to society. During the winter of 1984, before declaring a moratorium on the Korean economy, Chun visited Japan, where he requested a loan for $6 billion. With the military coup taking power and crushing the democratization movements country-wide, the citizens' political demands were being ignored, and in this way the [[3S Policy]] ('''S'''ex, '''S'''creen, '''S'''ports) was passed. Based on right-way{{clarify|date=December 2018}} Japanese activist [[Sejima Ryuzo]]'s proposal, Chun tried to appeal to the citizens in order to ensure the success of the 1988 Seoul Olympics preparations. Chun rapidly enacted various measures to this end, forming a pro baseball and pro soccer team, starting the broadcast of color TV throughout the nation as a whole, lessening censorship on sexually suggestive dramas and movies, making school uniforms voluntary, and so forth. In 1981, Chun held a large-scale festival called \"Korean Breeze\", but it was largely ignored by the population.\n\n====1983 North Korean assassination attempt====\n{{Main|Rangoon bombing}}\nIn 1983, Chun was the target of a failed assassination attempt by [[North Korea]]n agents during a visit to [[Rangoon, Burma]]. The North Korean bombing killed 17 of Chun's entourage, including cabinet ministers. Four Burmese government officials were also killed in the attack.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120909053953/http://www.news24.com/Content/World/News/1073/895771ceb4f54f8a90c53701b89bbc0b/08-01-2010-10-58/2_get_death_for_info_leak 2 get death for info leak] ''News24''</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:Chun Doo-hwan and Claude M. Kicklighter, Chung ho-yong, 1985-Mar-22.jpg|thumb|Chun with U.S. Major General [[Claude M. Kicklighter]] in March 1985]]\nChun's presidency occurred during the Cold War, and his foreign policies were based around combating communism not only from North Korea, but also from the Soviet Union and Communist China.\n\nThe United States put pressure on the South Korean government to abandon its plans to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nJapanese newspapers widely reported that Chun was the [[de facto]] leader of the country months before he made any move to become President.\n\nIn 1982, Chun announced the \"Korean People Harmony Democracy Reunification Program\", but due to repeated rejections from North Korea the program was unable to get off the ground.\n\nAlso from 1986 to 1988, he and President [[Corazon Aquino]] of the [[Philippines]] established talks between the two countries for strengthening Philippine-South Korean economic, social and cultural friendship.\n\n==End of the Fifth Republic==\n===Noh Shin-yeong===\nFrom the start of his presidency, Chun began grooming [[Lho Shin-yong|Noh Shin-yeong]] as his eventual successor. In 1980, while working as ambassador to the Geneva Representation Bureau, Noh Shin-yeong was recalled and made Minister of Foreign Affairs. In 1982, he was installed as the Director of the [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|Security Planning Bureau]], and in 1985, he was named Prime Minister.\n\nWhen that became widely known, those supporting Chun's regime were highly critical of his choice of successor. His supporters, mostly those with heavy military backgrounds, believed that the proper way to groom a successor was by military duties, not political positions. Chun was eventually persuaded to reverse his position and ceased pushing for Noh Shin-yeong to succeed him.\n\n===Democratization===\n{{See also|June Democracy Movement}}\nThe 1981 constitution restricted the president to a single seven-year term. Unlike his predecessors, Chun did not attempt to amend the document to run again in 1987. However, he consistently resisted pleas to open up the regime.\n\nOn 13 April 1987, Chun made a \"Defense of the Constitution\" speech. He declared that the DJP candidate for president would be one of his military supporters, and his successor would be chosen in an indirect election similar to the one that elected Chun seven years earlier. That announcement enraged the democratization community and, in concert with several scandals from the Chun government that year, demonstrators began their movement again, starting with a speech at the Anglican Cathedral of Seoul.\n\nTwo months later, he declared [[Roh Tae-woo]] as the Democratic Justice Party's candidate for president, which, by all accounts, effectively handed Roh the presidency. The announcement triggered the [[June Democracy Movement]], a series of large pro-democracy rallies across the country. In hopes of gaining control over a situation that was rapidly getting out of hand, Roh made a speech promising a much more democratic constitution and the first direct presidential elections in 16 years. On 10 July 1987, Chun resigned as head of the Democratic Justice Party, remaining its Honorary Chairman but giving official political party control for the upcoming election to Roh.\n\n===1987 presidential election===\n{{See also|1987 South Korean presidential election}}\nIn the 16 December 1987 Presidential Election, Roh won the election, the first honest national elections of any sort held in the country in two decades, after [[Kim Young-sam]] and [[Kim Dae-jung]] split the popular vote. Chun finished out his term and handed the presidency to Roh on 25 February 1988.\n\n==Later life==\nIn February 1988, having stepped down from the presidency at the conclusion of his term, Chun was named Chairman of the National Statesman Committee and so wielded considerable influence in South Korean politics. In that year, the Democratic Justice Party lost most of its seats in National Assembly elections to opposition parties, paving the way for the so-called \"Fifth Republic Hearings.\" The National Assembly explored the events of the Gwangju Democratization Movement and where responsibility should lay for the resulting massacre. On 11 November 1988, Chun apologized to the nation in a public address, pledging to give his money and belongings back to the country. Chun resigned from both the National Statesman Committee and the Democratic Justice Party.\n\nAt this time, Chun decided to live for several years in [[Baekdamsa]], a Buddhist temple in the Gangwon-do province, in order to pay penance for his actions. On 30 December 1990, Chun left Baekdamsa and returned home.\n\n===Kim Young-sam===\nAfter [[Kim Young-sam]]'s inauguration as President in 1993, Kim declared that Chun Doo-hwan and [[Roh Tae-woo]] had stolen 400 billion won (nearly $370 million) from the South Korean people, and he would conduct internal investigations to prove this. There have been allegations that Kim proceeded to draw attention away from his own corruption.\n\n====Investigations into Chun and Roh====\nOn 16 November 1995, the citizens\u2019 cries were growing louder about the 12 December 1979 military coup and the bloody 5\u201318 Gwangju Democratization Movement incident, so Kim Young-sam announced the beginning of a movement to enact retroactive legislation, naming the bill Special Act on 5\u201318 Democratization Movement. As soon as the Constitutional Court declared Chun's actions as unconstitutional, the prosecutors began a reinvestigation. On 3 December 1995, Chun and 16 others were arrested on charges of conspiracy and insurrection. At the same time, an investigation into the corruption of their presidencies was begun.\n\nIn March 1996, their public trial began. On 26 August, the Seoul District Court issued a death sentence.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} On 16 December 1996, the Seoul High Court issued a sentence of life imprisonment and a fine in the amount of {{SK won|220 billion}}.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} On 17 April 1997, the judgement was finalized in the Supreme Court. Chun was officially convicted of: Leading an Insurrection, Conspiracy to Commit Insurrection, Taking Part in an Insurrection, Illegal Troop Movement Orders, Dereliction of Duty During Martial Law, Murder of Superior Officers, Attempted Murder of Superior Officers, Murder of Subordinate Troops, Leading a Rebellion, Conspiracy to Commit Rebellion, Taking Part in a Rebellion, Murder for the Purpose of Rebellion, as well as assorted crimes relating to bribery.\n\nAfter his sentence was finalized, Chun began serving his prison sentence. On 22 December 1997, Chun's life imprisonment sentence was commuted by President Kim Young-sam, on the advice of incoming President [[Kim Dae-jung]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Chun was still required to pay his massive fine, but at that point he had only paid {{SK won|53.3 billion}}, not quite a fourth of the total fine amount. Chun made a relatively famous quote, saying, \"I have only {{SK won|290,000}} to my name.\" The remaining {{SK won|167.2 billion}} was never collected.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n====Revocation of related military awards====\nAccording to the \"May 18th Special Legislation\", all medals awarded for the military intervention during the [[Gwangju Democratization Movement]] were revoked and ordered to be returned to the government. There are still nine medals that have not been returned to the government.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n====Confiscation of artworks====\nBecause of Chun's unpaid fines amounting to {{SK won|167.2 billion}}, a team of 90 prosecutors, tax collectors and other investigators raided multiple locations simultaneously in July 2013, including Chun's residence and his family members' homes and offices. Television footage showed them hauling away paintings, porcelain and expensive artifacts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ex-Pres.'

Chun and his son Chun Jae-kook, who runs a publishing company, should take steps to prevent books from being sold in bookstores, and if they violate the plan, they should pay 5 million won per episode to the 5.18 Memorial Foundation. Then, in October 2017, when former President Chun re-issued 33 sections of his memoir in black ink and re-issued them, organizations filed a second lawsuit. As a result, on May 15, 2018, the Gwangju District Court again cited an injunction request. In addition to 33 false facts related to May 18 at the time of the first lawsuit, 36 contents were further recognized as false contents.\n\nKim Yong-jang, a former intelligence officer at the 501th Brigade of the U.S. Army on March 14, 2019, was found to be a witness for the first in 39 years. \"On May 21, 1980, Chun, fired near the Jeonil Building in the heart of Gwangju and in Yanglim-dong, upstream of Gwangju.

Chun was subsequently made secretary to the commander of the [[Supreme Council for National Reconstruction]],<ref name=presidential/><ref name=nateperson/> placing him directly under Park. Chun was quickly promoted to major in 1962, while continuing to make powerful friends and acquaintances. As a major, Chun was the deputy chief of operations for the [[Republic of Korea Army Special Warfare Command|Special Warfare Command]]'s battle headquarters, and later worked for the Supreme Council for Reconstruction again as the Chief Civil Affairs Officer. In 1963, Chun was given a position in the [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|Korean Central Intelligence Agency]] (KCIA) as Personnel Director.

Upon returning to Korea in 1971, he was given command of the 1st Special Forces Brigade (Airborne) and later promoted to brigadier general. In 1976 he worked as the deputy chief of the [[Presidential Security Service]] and was promoted to the rank of major general during his time there. In 1978 he became the commanding officer of the [[1st Infantry Division (Republic of Korea)|1st Infantry Division]].<ref name=presidential/><ref name=nateperson/>\n\nFinally, in 1979, he was appointed commander of [[Defense Security Command|Security Command]], his highest position yet.\n\n==Rise to power==\n\n===Hanahoe===\nChun formed [[Hanahoe]] as a secret military club shortly after his promotion to [[general officer]]. It was predominantly composed of his fellow graduates from the 11th class of the Korea Military Academy, as well as other friends and supporters. The membership to this secret club was predominately restricted to officers from the Gyeongsang Provinces with just a token membership reserved for a Cholla Provinces' officer. This secret organization's existence within a highly regimented and rigid hierarchical organization of the army was only possible because it was under the patronage of then President Park Chung-hee.\n\n===Assassination of Park Chung-hee===\n{{Main|Assassination of Park Chung-hee}}\nOn 26 October 1979, South Korean President [[Park Chung-hee]] was assassinated by [[Kim Jae-kyu]], Director of the [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|KCIA]], while at a dinner party. Secretly, Kim had invited General [[Jeong Seung-hwa]], Army Chief of Staff, and Kim Jeong-seop, Vice-Deputy Director of the KCIA, to dinner in another room that night as well. Although Jeong Seung-hwa was neither present during nor involved in the shooting of the President, his involvement later proved crucial. In the chaos that followed, Kim Jae-kyu was not arrested for many hours, as details of the incident were initially unclear.\n\nAfter some confusion over the constitutional procedures for presidential succession, Prime Minister [[Choi Kyu-ha]] finally ascended to the position of Acting President. Soon after, Jeong named Chun's Security Command to head up the investigation into the mysterious assassination. Chun immediately ordered his subordinates to draw up plans for the creation of an all-powerful \"Joint Investigation Headquarters\".<ref name=intel>{{cite news|author =[[Cho Gab-je|Cho, Gab-je]] (\uc870\uac11\uc81c) |author2=Lee, Dong-uk (\uc774\ub3d9\uc6b1)| script-title=ko:(\ubc15\uc815\ud76c\uc758 \uc0dd\uc560) \"\ub0b4 \ubb34\ub364\uc5d0 \uce68\uc744 \ubc49\uc5b4\ub77c!\"...(48)|trans-title=(Biography of Park Chung-hee) \"Spit on my grave!\"...

Invited were four key individuals now responsible for all intelligence collection nationwide: KCIA Deputy Chief of Foreign Affairs, KCIA Deputy Chief of Domestic Affairs, Attorney General, and Chief of the National Police.<ref name=intel/> Chun had each person searched at the door on his way in, before having them seated and informing them of the President's death. Chun declared the KCIA held full responsibility for the President's assassination, and its organization was therefore under investigation for the crime. Chun stated that the KCIA would no longer be allowed to exercise its own budget:\n\n{{quote|For the KCIA \"to continue exercising full discretion of their budget is unacceptable. Therefore, they are only allowed to execute their duties upon receiving authorization from the Joint Investigation Headquarters.\"|Chun Doo-hwan, ''Security Command'' and ''Joint Investigation Headquarters'' commander, 27 October 1979}}\n\nChun subsequently ordered all intelligence reports to now be sent to his office at 8:00&nbsp;am and 5:00&nbsp;pm every day, so he could decide what information to give higher command. In one move, Chun had taken control of the entire nation's intelligence organizations. Chun then put the KCIA Deputy Chief of Foreign Affairs in charge of running the day-to-day business of the KCIA.\n\nMajor Park Jun-kwang, working under Chun at the time, later commented:\n\n{{quote|In front of the most powerful organizations under the Park Chung-hee presidency, it surprised me how easily [Chun] gained control over them and how skillfully he took advantage of the circumstances. In an instant he seemed to have grown into a giant.|Park Jun-kwang, assigned to ''Security Command'' and ''Joint Investigation Headquarters''}}\n\nDuring the investigation and concerned for the welfare of President Park's family, Chun personally gave money (US$500,000) from Park's slush fund to [[Park Geun-hye]], who was 27 at the time. He was reprimanded for this by General Jeong.<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/24/chun-doo-whan-south-kore_n_3490372.html</ref>\n\n===12 December coup d\u2019\u00e9tat===\n{{Main|Coup d'\u00e9tat of December Twelfth}}\nIn the following month Chun, along with [[Roh Tae-woo]], Yu Hak-seong, Heo Sam-su, and others from the 11th graduating class of the KMA, continued taking advantage of the fragile political situation to grow Hanahoe's strength, courting key commanders and subverting the nation's intelligence gathering organizations.\n\nOn 12 December 1979, Chun ordered the arrest of Army Chief of Staff Jeong Seung-hwa on charges of conspiring with Kim Jae-kyu to assassinate the President. This order was made without authorization from President Choi. On the night of Jeong's capture, 29th Regiment, [[9th Infantry Division (Republic of Korea)|9th Division]], along with the 1st and 3rd Airborne Brigades, invaded downtown Seoul to support the 30th and 33rd Security Group loyal to Chun, then a series of conflicts broke out in the capital. [[Jang Tae-wan]], commander of the Capital Garrison Command and Jeong Byeong Ju, commander of the special forces, were also arrested by the rebel troops. Major Kim Oh-rang, Aide-de-camp of General Jeong Byeong-ju, was killed during the gun-fight. By the next morning, the Ministry of Defense and Army HQ were all occupied, and Chun was in firm control of the military. For all intents and purposes, he was now the de facto leader of the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nIn early 1980, Chun was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general, and he took up the position of acting director of the KCIA. On 14 April, Chun was officially installed as director of the KCIA.\n\n====Gwangju Democratization Movement and military intervention====\n{{Further|Coup d'\u00e9tat of May Seventeenth|Gwangju Democratization Movement}}\n[[File:Gwangju5.18FriedhofFotos.JPG|thumb|Memorial Hall in the [[May 18th National Cemetery]] in Gwangju where victims' bodies were buried]]\nOn 17 May 1980, Chun expanded martial law to the entire country, due to rumors of North Korean infiltration into South Korea. To enforce the martial law, troops were dispatched to various parts of the nation. The KCIA manipulated these rumors under the command of Chun. General [[John A. Wickham, Jr.|John A. Wickham]] ([[US Forces Korea|US Armed Forces in Korea]]) reported that Chun's pessimistic assessment of the domestic situation and his stress on the North Korean threat only seemed to be a pretext for a move into the [[Blue House]] (the Korean presidential residence).<ref>The US Government Statement on the Events in Gwangju, Republic of Korea, in May 1980</ref> The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities and further curtailed the press. The event of 17 May meant the beginning of another military dictatorship.\n\nMany townsfolk were growing unhappy with the military presence in their cities, and on 18 May, the citizens of [[Gwangju]] organized into what became known as the Gwangju Democratization Movement. Chun ordered it to be immediately suppressed, sending in crack military troops with tanks and helicopter gunships to retake City Hall and ordered the troops to exercise full force. This led to a bloody massacre over the next two days, ultimately leading to the collapse of the Gwangju Democratization Movement and the deaths of several hundred Gwangju activists. For this, he was called \"The Butcher of Gwangju\" by many people, especially among the students.\n\n====Path to the Presidency====\nIn June 1980, Chun ordered the National Assembly to be dissolved. He subsequently created the Special Committee for National Security Measures (SCNSM), a [[Military junta|Junta]]-like organization, and installed himself as a member. On 17 July, he resigned his position as KCIA Director, and then held only the position of committee member.\n\nOn 5 August, with full control of the military he was self-promoted to four star General and on 22 August he was discharged from active duty to the Army reserves.\n\n====Samchung Re-education Camp====\nBeginning in August 1980, citizens were subjected to organized violence under the name of social cleansing, which aimed at the elimination of social ills, such as violence, smuggling, drugs and deceptions. They were arrested without proper warrants and given [[ex parte]] rankings. Some 42,000 victims were enrolled in the [[Samchung re-education camp]] for \"purificatory education\". More than 60,000 people were arrested in six months between August 1980 and January 1981, including many innocent citizens. They faced violence and hard labour in the Re-education Camp.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hurights.or.jp/archives/newsinbrief-en/section1/2006/09/national-human-rights-commission-of-korea-recommended-equal-compensations-for-foreign-victims-of-sam.html |publisher=Hurights Osaka |title=National Human Rights Commission of Korea Recommended Equal Compensations for Foreign Victims of \"Samchung Re-education Camp\" |accessdate=6 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Fifth Republic==\n[[File:Chun Doo-hwan and Lee SoonJa.jpg|thumb|President Chun, and his wife, Rhee Soon-ja, prepare to depart after their visit to [[Washington D.C.]] in 1981.]]\n\n===President of South Korea (1980\u20131988)===\nIn August 1980, Choi, who had long since become little more than a figurehead, announced that he would be resigning the presidency. On [[1980 South Korean presidential election|27 August]], the National Conference for Unification, the nation's electoral college, gathered in Jang Choong Gymnasium. Chun was the sole candidate.  Out of 2525 members, 2524 voted for Chun with 1 vote counted as invalid, thus with a tally of 99.99% in favor (it was widely speculated at that time that 1 invalid vote was purposely rigged as to differentiate Chun from North Korea's [[Kim Il Sung]], who regularly claimed 100% support in North Korea's elections). He was officially inaugurated into office on 1 September 1980.\n\nOn 17 October, he abolished all political parties \u2014including Park's [[Democratic Republican Party (South Korea)|Democratic Republican Party]], which had essentially ruled the country as a one-party state since the imposition of the Yushin Constitution. In January 1981, Chun formed his own party, the [[Democratic Justice Party]]; however, for all intents and purposes, it was Park's Democratic Republican Party under another name. Soon afterward, a new constitution was enacted that, while far less authoritarian than Park's Yusin Constitution, still gave fairly broad powers to the president. \n\nHe was then re-elected president by the National Conference [[1981 South Korean presidential election|that February]], taking 90 percent of the delegates' vote against three minor candidates. However, Chun's election was a foregone conclusion after the DJP won a large majority of seats at elections for the National Conference two weeks earlier, with three times as many seats as the independents and nine times as many seats as the opposition [[Democratic Korea Party]].\n\n====Missile memorandum====\nIn 1980, in the face of increased tension with the U.S. over his military takeover, President Chun issued a memorandum stating that his country would not develop missiles with a range longer than 180&nbsp;km or capable of carrying greater than a 453&nbsp;kg warhead. After receiving this promise, the [[Reagan administration]] decided to fully recognize Chun's military government.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nIn the late 1990s, South Korea and the U.S. held talks on the issue and, rather than scrap the memorandum completely, they came to an agreement allowing missiles up to 300&nbsp;km in range and capability to carry up to a 500&nbsp;kg warhead. This compromise came into effect in 2001 under the name [[Missile Technology Control Regime]].\n\n====From 1981 to 1988====\n[[File:Chun Doo-hwan, 1985-Mar-22.jpg|thumb|President Chun Doo-hwan, attending a 1985 military briefing]]\nAfter his election in 1981, Chun completely rejected the presidency of Park, even going so far as to strike all references to Park's [[May 16 coup|1961 military coup]] from the constitution. Chun announced that he would be restoring justice to the government to remove the fraud and corruption of Park's tenure.<ref name=bookworld>{{Cite book| author =Jeon, Jae-ho (\uc804\uc7ac\ud638)| script-title=ko:\ubc18\ub3d9\uc801 \uadfc\ub300\uc8fc\uc758\uc790 \ubc15\uc815\ud76c |trans-title=Reactionary Modernist, Park Chung-hee (''Bandongjeok geundaejuuija Bak Jeong-hui'')| publisher = \ucc45\uc138\uc0c1 (Chaeksesang)| year = 2000| location = South Korea| pages = 112\u2013113| isbn = 978-89-7013-148-1 |language=Korean}}</ref>\n\n====South Korean nuclear weapons program====\nChun's government did not have the considerable political influence enjoyed by Park Chung-hee's administration.

In September 1980, Chun repealed \"guilt by association\" laws. In 1981, Chun enacted \"Care and Custody\" legislation; Chun believed that criminals who finish their prison time for a repeat offense should not be immediately returned to society. During the winter of 1984, before declaring a moratorium on the Korean economy, Chun visited Japan, where he requested a loan for $6 billion. With the military coup taking power and crushing the democratization movements country-wide, the citizens' political demands were being ignored, and in this way the [[3S Policy]] ('''S'''ex, '''S'''creen, '''S'''ports) was passed. Based on right-way{{clarify|date=December 2018}} Japanese activist [[Sejima Ryuzo]]'s proposal, Chun tried to appeal to the citizens in order to ensure the success of the 1988 Seoul Olympics preparations. Chun rapidly enacted various measures to this end, forming a pro baseball and pro soccer team, starting the broadcast of color TV throughout the nation as a whole, lessening censorship on sexually suggestive dramas and movies, making school uniforms voluntary, and so forth. In 1981, Chun held a large-scale festival called \"Korean Breeze\", but it was largely ignored by the population.\n\n====1983 North Korean assassination attempt====\n{{Main|Rangoon bombing}}\nIn 1983, Chun was the target of a failed assassination attempt by [[North Korea]]n agents during a visit to [[Rangoon, Burma]]. The North Korean bombing killed 17 of Chun's entourage, including cabinet ministers. Four Burmese government officials were also killed in the attack.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120909053953/http://www.news24.com/Content/World/News/1073/895771ceb4f54f8a90c53701b89bbc0b/08-01-2010-10-58/2_get_death_for_info_leak 2 get death for info leak] ''News24''</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:Chun Doo-hwan and Claude M. Kicklighter, Chung ho-yong, 1985-Mar-22.jpg|thumb|Chun with U.S. Major General [[Claude M. Kicklighter]] in March 1985]]\nChun's presidency occurred during the Cold War, and his foreign policies were based around combating communism not only from North Korea, but also from the Soviet Union and Communist China.\n\nThe United States put pressure on the South Korean government to abandon its plans to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nJapanese newspapers widely reported that Chun was the [[de facto]] leader of the country months before he made any move to become President.\n\nIn 1982, Chun announced the \"Korean People Harmony Democracy Reunification Program\", but due to repeated rejections from North Korea the program was unable to get off the ground.\n\nAlso from 1986 to 1988, he and President [[Corazon Aquino]] of the [[Philippines]] established talks between the two countries for strengthening Philippine-South Korean economic, social and cultural friendship.\n\n==End of the Fifth Republic==\n===Noh Shin-yeong===\nFrom the start of his presidency, Chun began grooming [[Lho Shin-yong|Noh Shin-yeong]] as his eventual successor. In 1980, while working as ambassador to the Geneva Representation Bureau, Noh Shin-yeong was recalled and made Minister of Foreign Affairs. In 1982, he was installed as the Director of the [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|Security Planning Bureau]], and in 1985, he was named Prime Minister.\n\nWhen that became widely known, those supporting Chun's regime were highly critical of his choice of successor. His supporters, mostly those with heavy military backgrounds, believed that the proper way to groom a successor was by military duties, not political positions. Chun was eventually persuaded to reverse his position and ceased pushing for Noh Shin-yeong to succeed him.\n\n===Democratization===\n{{See also|June Democracy Movement}}\nThe 1981 constitution restricted the president to a single seven-year term. Unlike his predecessors, Chun did not attempt to amend the document to run again in 1987. However, he consistently resisted pleas to open up the regime.\n\nOn 13 April 1987, Chun made a \"Defense of the Constitution\" speech. He declared that the DJP candidate for president would be one of his military supporters, and his successor would be chosen in an indirect election similar to the one that elected Chun seven years earlier. That announcement enraged the democratization community and, in concert with several scandals from the Chun government that year, demonstrators began their movement again, starting with a speech at the Anglican Cathedral of Seoul.\n\nTwo months later, he declared [[Roh Tae-woo]] as the Democratic Justice Party's candidate for president, which, by all accounts, effectively handed Roh the presidency. The announcement triggered the [[June Democracy Movement]], a series of large pro-democracy rallies across the country. In hopes of gaining control over a situation that was rapidly getting out of hand, Roh made a speech promising a much more democratic constitution and the first direct presidential elections in 16 years. On 10 July 1987, Chun resigned as head of the Democratic Justice Party, remaining its Honorary Chairman but giving official political party control for the upcoming election to Roh.\n\n===1987 presidential election===\n{{See also|1987 South Korean presidential election}}\nIn the 16 December 1987 Presidential Election, Roh won the election, the first honest national elections of any sort held in the country in two decades, after [[Kim Young-sam]] and [[Kim Dae-jung]] split the popular vote. Chun finished out his term and handed the presidency to Roh on 25 February 1988.\n\n==Later life==\nIn February 1988, having stepped down from the presidency at the conclusion of his term, Chun was named Chairman of the National Statesman Committee and so wielded considerable influence in South Korean politics. In that year, the Democratic Justice Party lost most of its seats in National Assembly elections to opposition parties, paving the way for the so-called \"Fifth Republic Hearings.\" The National Assembly explored the events of the Gwangju Democratization Movement and where responsibility should lay for the resulting massacre. On 11 November 1988, Chun apologized to the nation in a public address, pledging to give his money and belongings back to the country. Chun resigned from both the National Statesman Committee and the Democratic Justice Party.\n\nAt this time, Chun decided to live for several years in [[Baekdamsa]], a Buddhist temple in the Gangwon-do province, in order to pay penance for his actions. On 30 December 1990, Chun left Baekdamsa and returned home.\n\n===Kim Young-sam===\nAfter [[Kim Young-sam]]'s inauguration as President in 1993, Kim declared that Chun Doo-hwan and [[Roh Tae-woo]] had stolen 400 billion won (nearly $370 million) from the South Korean people, and he would conduct internal investigations to prove this. There have been allegations that Kim proceeded to draw attention away from his own corruption.\n\n====Investigations into Chun and Roh====\nOn 16 November 1995, the citizens\u2019 cries were growing louder about the 12 December 1979 military coup and the bloody 5\u201318 Gwangju Democratization Movement incident, so Kim Young-sam announced the beginning of a movement to enact retroactive legislation, naming the bill Special Act on 5\u201318 Democratization Movement. As soon as the Constitutional Court declared Chun's actions as unconstitutional, the prosecutors began a reinvestigation. On 3 December 1995, Chun and 16 others were arrested on charges of conspiracy and insurrection. At the same time, an investigation into the corruption of their presidencies was begun.\n\nIn March 1996, their public trial began. On 26 August, the Seoul District Court issued a death sentence.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} On 16 December 1996, the Seoul High Court issued a sentence of life imprisonment and a fine in the amount of {{SK won|220 billion}}.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} On 17 April 1997, the judgement was finalized in the Supreme Court. Chun was officially convicted of: Leading an Insurrection, Conspiracy to Commit Insurrection, Taking Part in an Insurrection, Illegal Troop Movement Orders, Dereliction of Duty During Martial Law, Murder of Superior Officers, Attempted Murder of Superior Officers, Murder of Subordinate Troops, Leading a Rebellion, Conspiracy to Commit Rebellion, Taking Part in a Rebellion, Murder for the Purpose of Rebellion, as well as assorted crimes relating to bribery.\n\nAfter his sentence was finalized, Chun began serving his prison sentence. On 22 December 1997, Chun's life imprisonment sentence was commuted by President Kim Young-sam, on the advice of incoming President [[Kim Dae-jung]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Chun was still required to pay his massive fine, but at that point he had only paid {{SK won|53.3 billion}}, not quite a fourth of the total fine amount. Chun made a relatively famous quote, saying, \"I have only {{SK won|290,000}} to my name.\" The remaining {{SK won|167.2 billion}} was never collected.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n====Revocation of related military awards====\nAccording to the \"May 18th Special Legislation\", all medals awarded for the military intervention during the [[Gwangju Democratization Movement]] were revoked and ordered to be returned to the government. There are still nine medals that have not been returned to the government.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n====Confiscation of artworks====\nBecause of Chun's unpaid fines amounting to {{SK won|167.2 billion}}, a team of 90 prosecutors, tax collectors and other investigators raided multiple locations simultaneously in July 2013, including Chun's residence and his family members' homes and offices. Television footage showed them hauling away paintings, porcelain and expensive artifacts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ex-Pres.'

Chun and his son Chun Jae-kook, who runs a publishing company, should take steps to prevent books from being sold in bookstores, and if they violate the plan, they should pay 5 million won per episode to the 5.18 Memorial Foundation. Then, in October 2017, when former President Chun re-issued 33 sections of his memoir in black ink and re-issued them, organizations filed a second lawsuit. As a result, on May 15, 2018, the Gwangju District Court again cited an injunction request. In addition to 33 false facts related to May 18 at the time of the first lawsuit, 36 contents were further recognized as false contents.\n\nKim Yong-jang, a former intelligence officer at the 501th Brigade of the U.S. Army on March 14, 2019, was found to be a witness for the first in 39 years. \"On May 21, 1980, Chun, fired near the Jeonil Building in the heart of Gwangju and in Yanglim-dong, upstream of Gwangju.

It was the final match to determine the winner of the [[1963\u201364 Danish Cup]], the 10th season of the Danish national-wide annual football knockout competition, the [[Danish Cup]], open to all [[Danish Football Association|DBU]] member clubs.<ref name=\"cupwins\" /> This was the first time that two sides had ever met in a domestic cup competition and only the third time in a competitive league game.<ref name=\"superstats\" /><ref name=\"vef-06.05.1964\" /> For Odense KFUM, the match represented their first opportunity to win a title on a national level, having never reached the quarterfinals in previous seasons in the cup's former incarnation, while Esbjerg fB were participating in their third cup final, having lost on both previous occasions.<ref name=\"cupwins\" /><ref name=\"dkpt\" /> This was the third consecutive year the tournament's final featured a team from [[Odense]].\n\nEsbjerg fB played in the then [[Danish football league system|top flight]] of Danish association football, [[1964 Danish 1st Division|1st Division]], and [[Bye (sports)|bypassed]] the initial stages of the tournament with an entry into the third round proper, while [[1964 Danish 2nd Division|2nd Division]] club Odense KFUM entered one round earlier. The last three season's reigning [[List of Danish football champions|Danish league champions]] Esbjerg fB's road to the final included victories over [[Boldklubben Fremad Valby|BK Fremad Valby]], [[Vorup Frederiksberg Boldklub|Vorup Frederiksberg BK]], [[Boldklubben 1909|B 1909]] and [[Akademisk Boldklub|Akademisk BK]]. Odense KFUM secured its berth in the final by defeating [[Holb\u00e6k B&IF]], Knabstrup IF, [[Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j Boldklub|Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j BK]], [[Aarhus Gymnastikforening|Aarhus GF]], and the [[1963 Danish 1st Division|previous league season's runners-up]] and [[1963 Danish Cup Final|reigning cup title]] holders, [[Boldklubben 1913|B 1913]].\n\nThe crowd of 24,500 witnessed Esbjerg fB defeating Odense KFUM 2\u20131, winning the competition for the first time in the club's history.

In their first cup match of the [[1963\u201364 Danish Cup|1963\u201364 season]], [[Esbjerg fB]] were drawn against the fifth-tier [[Copenhagen Series|K\u00f8benhavnsserien]] side [[BK Fremad Valby]], and on 24 November 1963 the team and managers traveled to BK Fremad Valby's home ground [[Valby Idr\u00e6tspark]] located in the [[Copenhagen]] district of [[Valby]].<ref name=\"efbh-p-6364\" /> In front of a small crowd of 1,200 spectators, they won the match plagued by pouring rain with an icy wind across the football field, scoring all six goals including an [[own goal]] attributed to [[John Madsen (footballer)|John Madsen]] that shortly equalized the score after 12 minutes of play.<ref name=\"efbh-p-6364\" /><ref name=\"bt-25.11.1963\" /><ref name=\"ber-25.11.1963\" /> Esbjerg fB scored first with a goal by [[Forward (association football)|centre-forward]] [[Carl Bertelsen]] within four minutes of the first half. Following Madsen's own goal, having hit the ball incorrectly outside the reach of second-string goalie Verner Beck, the match remained tied for 17 minutes until Esbjerg fB's right winger [[Knud Petersen (footballer, born 1942)|Knud Petersen]] scored twice in the remainder of the first half and successfully executed a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] in the 68th minute of play, completing the first and only [[Hat-trick#Association football|hat-trick]] of his footballing career.<ref name=\"efbh-k-p\" /> Fellow striker [[Carl Emil Christiansen]] netted the last goal of the game four minutes later, and Esbjerg fB moved on to the next round with a final score of 1\u20135.<ref name=\"bt-25.11.1963\" /><ref name=\"ber-25.11.1963\" />\n\nOn 1 December 1963, Esbjerg fB hosted the [[1963 Kvalifikationsturneringen|4th Division]] club [[Vorup Frederiksberg Boldklub|Vorup Frederiksberg BK]] \u2014 the only remaining team from a league outside the three top divisional structure, and who was relegated to the [[Jutland Series]] next year \u2014 at their home ground, [[Esbjerg Stadium]], in the fourth round. Esbjerg struck first through E.

KFUM progressed by winning 8\u20133 against the [[DBU Zealand Series 1|sixth-tier]] club on a heavy and wet grass turf after leading the match 6\u20130 at 60 minutes of play, following a scoring spree of three goals within a seven minute time frame in the first half.<ref name=\"ber-25.11.1963\" /><ref name=\"bt-25.11.1963\" /> The high-scoring match involved the KFUM players [[Helge J\u00f8rgensen]] (one on penalty), Kaj Peter Larsen and J\u00f8rgen Nielsen each scoring two goals with Tommy Madsen and Karsten Wiingreen making the remaining goals.<ref name=\"ber-25.11.1963\" /><ref name=\"fs-25.11.1963\" /> Tage J\u00f8rgensen saved one penalty kick awarded to Knabstrup IF at the beginning of the first half.<ref name=\"fs-25.11.1963\" />\n\nOdense ended the year by hosting their last cup and competitive match on 1 December 1963 at Odense Stadium against [[1963 Danish 1st Division|1st Division]] club [[Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j Boldklub|Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j BK]], winning the fourth round proper game 3\u20130 (with a half time score of 2\u20130) without losing control with the match at any point.<ref name=\"bt-08.04.1964\" /> Two weeks prior to the cup game, Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j BK had narrowly avoided relegation from the top-tier division on the last matchday.<ref name=\"has-1d1963\" />\n\nThe quarterfinal spot was the Odense KFUM's best result in the nation-wide cup tournament, not taking into account the 1940 edition of the defunct [[Danmarkspokalturneringen]].<ref name=\"superstats\" /><ref name=\"dkpt\" /><ref name=\"bt-08.04.1964\" /> During the off season, Peter Eriksen, Niels Erik Kildemoes and Freddy Hansen joined the senior squad directly from the youth ranks, making their senior league debut in the club's inaugural game of the season against [[K\u00f8ge Boldklub|K\u00f8ge BK]] on 30 March and then against [[Aalborg Boldspilklub|Aalborg BK]] on 5 April.<ref name=\"bt-25.04.1964\" /><ref name=\"bt-31.03.1964\" /><ref name=\"bt-08.04.1964\" /> The quarterfinal game against [[1964 Danish 1st Division|1st Division]] team [[Aarhus Gymnastikforening|Aarhus GF]] had been postponed to 8 April 1964 due to bad weather in December 1963.

J\u00f8rgensen scoring his sixth and seventh goal in the first three matches of the year.<ref name=\"bt-08.04.1964\" /><ref name=\"bt-09.04.1964\" /> An ankle injury meant that full-back Eriksen was replaced with Henning Larsen in the upcoming matches, eventually missing out on the semi-final and the cup final.<ref name=\"bt-10.04.1964\" />\n\nThe senior team's performance in the league and cup got noticed in the media and public, which helped increase their match attendance figures.<ref name=\"kfum-50y\" /> With the game once again being staged at Odense Stadium, every cup match leading up to the final had now being played in their home city of Odense.<ref name=\"vef-06.05.1964\" /> The semi-final clash on 22 April 1964 to a crowd of 9,200 spectators against the defending cup title holders, runners-up in the [[1963 Danish 1st Division|previous league season]], local city rivals and the then neighboring club at Kildemosen sports park, [[Boldklubben 1913|B 1913]], ended in a 2\u20132 draw after full time, necessitating 30 minutes of [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]].<ref name=\"bt-23.04.1964\" /><ref name=\"nt-23.04.1964\" /> B 1913 wore white jerseys as [[away colours]] at the match due to the blue-green clashing of the clubs' [[Kit (association football)|home kits]] \u2014 a similar decision was however not repeated at the cup final.<ref name=\"bt-22.04.1964\" /> The thirteeners took the lead in the 16th minute with a header goal via right winger [[Eigil Misser]], but KFUM scored twice in the next ten minutes to come on top, until Misser scored an equalizer 9 minutes before the end of the second half.<ref name=\"bt-23.04.1964\" /><ref name=\"nt-23.04.1964\" /> A 3\u20132 victory to Odense KFUM was secured with the decisive goal netted by H.

The last three season's reigning [[List of Danish football champions|Danish league champions]] Esbjerg fB's road to the final included victories over [[Boldklubben Fremad Valby|BK Fremad Valby]], [[Vorup Frederiksberg Boldklub|Vorup Frederiksberg BK]], [[Boldklubben 1909|B 1909]] and [[Akademisk Boldklub|Akademisk BK]]. Odense KFUM secured its berth in the final by defeating [[Holb\u00e6k B&IF]], Knabstrup IF, [[Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j Boldklub|Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j BK]], [[Aarhus Gymnastikforening|Aarhus GF]], and the [[1963 Danish 1st Division|previous league season's runners-up]] and [[1963 Danish Cup Final|reigning cup title]] holders, [[Boldklubben 1913|B 1913]].\n\nThe crowd of 24,500 witnessed Esbjerg fB defeating Odense KFUM 2\u20131, winning the competition for the first time in the club's history.

In their first cup match of the [[1963\u201364 Danish Cup|1963\u201364 season]], [[Esbjerg fB]] were drawn against the fifth-tier [[Copenhagen Series|K\u00f8benhavnsserien]] side [[BK Fremad Valby]], and on 24 November 1963 the team and managers traveled to BK Fremad Valby's home ground [[Valby Idr\u00e6tspark]] located in the [[Copenhagen]] district of [[Valby]].<ref name=\"efbh-p-6364\" /> In front of a small crowd of 1,200 spectators, they won the match plagued by pouring rain with an icy wind across the football field, scoring all six goals including an [[own goal]] attributed to [[John Madsen (footballer)|John Madsen]] that shortly equalized the score after 12 minutes of play.<ref name=\"efbh-p-6364\" /><ref name=\"bt-25.11.1963\" /><ref name=\"ber-25.11.1963\" /> Esbjerg fB scored first with a goal by [[Forward (association football)|centre-forward]] [[Carl Bertelsen]] within four minutes of the first half. Following Madsen's own goal, having hit the ball incorrectly outside the reach of second-string goalie Verner Beck, the match remained tied for 17 minutes until Esbjerg fB's right winger [[Knud Petersen (footballer, born 1942)|Knud Petersen]] scored twice in the remainder of the first half and successfully executed a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] in the 68th minute of play, completing the first and only [[Hat-trick#Association football|hat-trick]] of his footballing career.<ref name=\"efbh-k-p\" /> Fellow striker [[Carl Emil Christiansen]] netted the last goal of the game four minutes later, and Esbjerg fB moved on to the next round with a final score of 1\u20135.<ref name=\"bt-25.11.1963\" /><ref name=\"ber-25.11.1963\" />\n\nOn 1 December 1963, Esbjerg fB hosted the [[1963 Kvalifikationsturneringen|4th Division]] club [[Vorup Frederiksberg Boldklub|Vorup Frederiksberg BK]] \u2014 the only remaining team from a league outside the three top divisional structure, and who was relegated to the [[Jutland Series]] next year \u2014 at their home ground, [[Esbjerg Stadium]], in the fourth round. Esbjerg struck first through E.

J\u00f8rgensen received a long horizontal pass from his team colleague innerwing J\u00f8rgen Nielsen within the penalty area, got himself into a free position in front of the goal, but eventually his final shoot ended several meters outside the target.<ref name=\"akt-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"jp-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"aas-08.05.1964\" /> Another close attempt was made by H. J\u00f8rgensen in the middle of the first half, once again receiving a pass from Nielsen, who was looking to [[dribbling|dribble]] his way past the opponent's defenses, but ended up performing a [[somersault]] over the legs of Esbjerg fB's [[John Madsen (footballer)|John Madsen]].<ref name=\"fs-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"bt-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"aas-08.05.1964\" /> Esbjerg midfielder [[Jens Petersen]] had several shot attempts from the distance, which did not cause the Odense KFUM keeper any issues, while forward Bertelsen had two headers towards Odense KFUM's goal, both with no success.<ref name=\"akt-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"fs-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"jp-08.05.1964\" /> A few minutes before the referee sounded the half time whistle, some fumble play in front of Esbjerg fB's half-empty goal ended with a shot by center Odense KFUM forward Freddy Hansen, but Esbjerg fB's goalkeeper [[Erik Gaardh\u00f8je]] saved the attempt using his foot.<ref name=\"akt-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"bt-08.05.1964\" />\n\nDuring periods of the first half, when Esbjerg fB had the advantage in the game play, they combined at a faster pace than the Odense KFUM players.<ref name=\"jp-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"aas-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"ber-08.05.1964\" /> J. Petersen stated that his team had difficulties penetrating Odense KFUM's lines of defence.<ref name=\"fs-08.05.1964\" /> The tactics determined by KFUM's [[head coach]] Ole Petersen and the match selection committee, presided by Ove Birkholm, were to have the team's inner wings fall back to the Odense defensive area and pick up the [[Ball (association football)|ball]], while attempting to keep the ball in play, until the [[Association football positions#Winger|left and right wingers]] were back in their positions \u2013 the same strategy employed by the Odense KFUM team in the last couple of competitive matches, which had successfully paid off.<ref name=\"bt-08.05.1964\" /> Sports editor at ''[[Det fri Aktuelt|Aktuelt]]'', [[Knud Lundberg]], praised KFUM's tactics of deliberately slowing down the pace, keeping the ball in play with [[Passing (association football)|short passings]] at the center of the football field, and slowly initiating their attacks as a countermeasure to EfB's fast-paced squad, especially in the first half.<ref name=\"akt-08.05.1964\" /> Due to H. J\u00f8rgensen being deemed a relatively slow footballer by the opposing team players despite his technical skills and goal scoring abilities, the tactics by Esbjerg fB did not involve an EfB player getting the responsibility of guarding him throughout the entire game.<ref name=\"aas-07.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"ber-17.09.2007\" /> The first half ended with no goals being scored by either sides, who were evenly matched up until the 60th minute into the second half.<ref name=\"fs-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"bt-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"demaa-08.05.1964\" />\n\n====Second half====\n{{external media\n| float  = right\n| video1 = [https://www.danskkulturarv.dk/dr/sport-1964-12/ Video clips of the three goals in the final].

Bertelsen rushed towards the target and without any hesitation he made a low flying flat shot with his left foot, scoring against Odense KFUM.<ref name=\"akt-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"fs-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"jp-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"aas-08.05.1964\" /> The ball game was now constantly taking place outside Odense KFUM's goal.<ref name=\"fs-08.05.1964\" /> Esbjerg fB increased their lead to 2\u20130 after 25 minutes in the second half.<ref name=\"fs-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"demaa-08.05.1964\" /> A corner kick, executed by [[Knud Petersen (footballer, born 1942)|Knud Petersen]], in the right side eventually arrived at Bertelsen, who failed his kick due to a tackle, but it eluded the defense and the ball continued to a free Kikkenborg a few meters from the goal, who scored by hitting the lower edge of the crossbar ending up in the net.<ref name=\"akt-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"fs-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"aas-08.05.1964\" /> Left half back J. Larsen and his team mate, T. J\u00f8rgensen, were present at the goal line, but unable to intervene.<ref name=\"ber-08.05.1964\" />\n\nOdense did not give up their attacks on their opponent's goal, trying to get a tie to the match, and any chance was followed through.<ref name=\"akt-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"jp-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"demaa-08.05.1964\" /> They were eventually able to score their first goal, made by forward Niels Erik Kildemoes, 8 minutes before full time, reducing the score to 2\u20131.<ref name=\"akt-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"jp-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"aas-08.05.1964\" /> The prelude to the goal was created by H. J\u00f8rgensen, who in the left side dribbled his way past 2\u20133 Esbjerg players, attempting to pass the ball to centre-forward Freddy Hansen, who failed at his kick just outside Gaardh\u00f8je's reach, but the ball was picked up by KFUM's 19 years old right winger Kildemoes, who sent the ball into Esbjerg fB's net via the right goal post, between the legs of defender [[Preben Jensen (footballer)|Preben Jensen]].<ref name=\"akt-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"ber-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"fs-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"aas-08.05.1964\" /> Afterwards, Esbjerg fB's innerwing Egon Jensen caused a corner kick, which resulted in two goal attempts by Bertelsen with T. J\u00f8rgensen saving on both occasions, despite Odense KFUM's pressure.<ref name=\"akt-08.05.1964\" /> Esbjerg were under much pressure from Odense in the final minutes of the cup final and centre half back [[John Madsen (footballer|John Madsen]] and right half back [[Jens J\u00f8rgen Hansen]] discredited their team with the audience by kicking the ball far out of the field in time-consuming maneuvers.<ref name=\"fs-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"vef-08.05.1964\" />\n\nAfter two failed corner kick attempts by Odense and only 3 to 4 minutes before the final whistle, KFUM's forward H. J\u00f8rgensen managed to pluck the ball from an inattentive Gaardh\u00f8je as the Esbjerg fB's goalkeeper, who was in no hurry, was about to do a goal kick.<ref name=\"akt-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"fs-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"bt-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"aas-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"vef-08.05.1964\" /> The defensive line of Esbjerg fB had already moved up the field, expecting a long kick from Gaardh\u00f8je.<ref name=\"fs-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"demaa-08.05.1964\" /> The Jutland keeper pursued the Funen team's innerwing to the right back line towards the corner flag, and when H. J\u00f8rgensen managed to dribble himself free, starting a run towards the goal in an arc around the goalkeeper, Gaardh\u00f8je somewhat deliberately grabbed H. J\u00f8rgensen's legs from behind in an [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)|unregulated manner]] about half a meter just outside the [[penalty area]].<ref name=\"akt-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"fs-09.08.2001\" /><ref name=\"demaa-08.05.1964\" /> A warning was given by the referee and an indisputable free kick was awarded to the Odense team \u2013 after a delay caused by P. Jensen, the free kick attempt by Kildemoes went over the goal.<ref name=\"faa-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"akt-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"fs-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"ber-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"vef-08.05.1964\" /> The [[Zealand]]-based referee was not under the impression, that the goalkeeper's offense should have resulted in a dismissal from the game, drawing comparisons to deliberate use of hands in an obvious scoring situation.<ref name=\"ber-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"fs-08.05.1964\" /> However, the act made the goalkeeper and the whole team very [[Popularity|unpopular]] among the majority of the 24,500 spectators, and the protests failed to settle before the referee ended the match \u2013 both the players and spectators had otherwise behaved nicely and quietly in the first part of the game.<ref name=\"ber-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"akt-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"fs-09.08.2001\" /><ref name=\"ber-08.05.1964\" /> Odense KFUM did not manage to equalize in the last moments of the match, avoiding 30 minutes of [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]] (2 x 15 minutes) being added.<ref name=\"fs-09.08.2001\" /><ref name=\"ber-08.05.1964\" />\n\n===Details===\n{{football box\n|date=7 May 1964\n|time=13:30 CET\n|team1=[[Esbjerg fB]]\n|score=2\u20131\n|report=<ref name=\"guinness90\" /><ref name=\"has-1964f\" /><ref name=\"fs-1964\" /><ref name=\"df1964teams\" /><br /><ref name=\"akt-08.05.1964\" /><ref name=\"vef-08.05.1964\" />\n|team2=[[KFUMs Boldklub Odense|Odense KFUM]]\n|goals1=[[Carl Bertelsen]] {{goal|63}}<br />[[Bjarne Kikkenborg]] {{goal|71}}<!--Some newspapers mention 66th minute-->\n|goals2=Niels Erik Kildemoes {{goal|83}}\n|stadium=[[K\u00f8benhavns Idr\u00e6tspark]], Copenhagen\n|attendance=24,500\n|referee=[[Carl W.
