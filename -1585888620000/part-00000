{"title_page": "List of State Basketball League champions", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{State Basketball League Awards}}\nEvery year around late August and early September, [[Basketball Western Australia]] hosts a [[grand final]] weekend for the [[State Basketball League]] (SBL) to determine the champion teams of the Women's SBL and Men's SBL. The current format of the WSBL championship game on the Friday night and the MSBL championship game on the Saturday night has been in place since 2001. All Grand Finals have been played in a one-game championship decider, except in 1995 when a best-of-three series was introduced for both competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sbl.asn.au/past-champions/|title=PAST CHAMPIONS|work=SBL.asn.au|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nUp until 1990, the event was held at [[Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium]]. Then between 1991 and 1999, the event was held at the much larger [[HBF Stadium|Challenge Stadium]] (known as Perth Superdrome between 1991\u201396). The Grand Finals returned to Perry Lakes in 2000, with Perry Lakes remaining the grand final host venue until 2009. In August 2010, Basketball Western Australia hosted their first State Basketball League Grand Finals at the new home of basketball, the $40 million [[Bendat Basketball Centre|WA Basketball Centre]] (later renamed Bendat Basketball Centre in 2015).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://basketballwa.asn.au/blog/2010/08/09/sbl-grand-final-tickets-now-on-sale/|title=SBL GRAND FINAL TICKETS NOW ON

[[grand final]] weekend for the [[State Basketball League]] (SBL) to determine the champion teams of the Women's SBL and Men's SBL. The current format of the WSBL championship game on the Friday night and the MSBL championship game on the Saturday night has been in place since 2001. All Grand Finals have been played in a one-game championship decider, except in 1995 when a best-of-three series was introduced for both competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sbl.asn.au/past-champions/|title=PAST CHAMPIONS|work=SBL.asn.au|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nUp until 1990, the event was held at [[Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium]]. Then between 1991 and 1999, the event was held at the much larger [[HBF Stadium|Challenge Stadium]] (known as Perth Superdrome between 1991\u201396). The Grand Finals returned to Perry Lakes in 2000, with Perry Lakes remaining the grand final host venue until 2009. In August 2010, Basketball Western Australia hosted their first State Basketball League Grand Finals at the new home of basketball, the $40 million [[Bendat Basketball Centre|WA Basketball Centre]] (later renamed Bendat Basketball Centre in 2015).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://basketballwa.asn.au/blog/2010/08/09/sbl-grand-final-tickets-now-on-sale/|title=SBL GRAND FINAL TICKETS NOW ON

The top eight teams in each conference ([[Eastern Conference (NBA)|East]] and [[Western Conference (NBA)|West]]), ranked in order by win-loss records, qualify for the playoffs. The tie-break criteria for playoff seeding and home-court advantage have also changed; head-to-head results between the tied teams is the first tie-breaker, and whether a team won its division championship is the second tie-breaker.<ref name=\"NBA20150908\">{{cite press release|title=NBA to seed conference playoff teams by record|url=http://www.nba.com/2015/news/09/08/nba-to-seed-conference-playoff-teams-by-record/index.html|publisher=National Basketball Association|date=September 8, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen they are 8 teams remaining the games are by seeds 1-4,2-6,3-7,4-8. When only for teams are left the tournament cannot he shuffles or reseeded unlike the National Football League (NFL). The fixtures are then 1-2,3-4, the order of qualification, or may be decided by ballots\n\nAll rounds are [[Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven]] series. Series are played in a 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 format, meaning the team with home-court advantage hosts games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while their opponent hosts games 3, 4, and 6, with games 5\u20137 being played if needed. This format has been used since [[2013\u201314 NBA season|2014]], after NBA team owners unanimously voted to change from a 2\u20133\u20132 format on October 23, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2013/news/10/23/nba-board-of-governors-format-change.ap/ |title=NBA owners change Finals format to 2-2-1-1-1 |publisher=NBA.com |date=2013-10-23 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n\nThe most common criticism of the current structure is related to parity of conferences. On numerous occasions, [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] teams with losing records qualified for the playoffs, while [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] teams with winning records ended up missing them, including the [[2011 NBA playoffs|2011]], [[2013 NBA playoffs|2013]] and the [[2015 NBA playoffs]].\n\n==History==\nThe National Basketball Association was established in 1949 by merger of the [[Basketball Association of America]] (BAA) and [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] but it recognizes the three BAA seasons as part of its own history. In all of its three years the BAA champion was finally determined in a best-of-seven series but its first two tournaments, the [[1947 BAA Playoffs|1947]] and [[1948 BAA Playoffs]], were otherwise quite different from the third, which 21st-century NBA playoffs nearly match. In 1947 and 1948, the Eastern and Western Division champions were matched in a [[Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven]] series following the regular season, whose winner advanced to the championship round. Meanwhile, four runners-up played best-of-three series to determine the other finalist: the two second-place teams were matched in one short series and the two third-place teams in another; the winners of those two series played another one. In 1947 the [[Philadelphia Warriors]] won the runners-up bracket and beat the Western champion [[Chicago Stags]] four games to one, which the NBA recognizes as its first championship; in 1948 Baltimore won the runners-up and beat Eastern champion Philadelphia in the final. Both tournaments generated one finalist from the Eastern and one from the Western Division, but only by chance.<ref name=BBR>[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/BAA_1947.html \"1946\u201347 BAA Season Summary\"]. <br>&nbsp; [https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/BAA_1948.html \"1947\u201348 BAA Season Summary\"].

At the same time, the number of playoff teams was increased from three to four from each Division; two rounds of best-of-three series were played, followed by a best-of-seven championship. The main idea was retained by the NBA. Even the [[1950 NBA Playoffs|1950 tournament]], following a transitional season with three divisions rather than two, initially determined one playoff champion from each division. The Central champion [[Minneapolis Lakers]] became the first league champion under the NBA name by defeating Anderson from the West in a best-of-three, with Syracuse from the East idle, and then knocking off the [[Syracuse Nationals]] in six games.<ref name=BBR2>[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/BAA_1949.html \"1948\u201349 BAA Season Summary\"]. <br>&nbsp; [https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1950.html \"1949\u201350 NBA Season Summary\"].

With only nine league members in 1953\u201354, the NBA cut its postseason tournament field from eight teams to six (from 1954 through 1966, the period of eight to nine league members). [[Round-robin tournament|Round robins]] were played in 1954, uniquely in NBA history\u2014a three-team round robin among the three playoff teams in each division. From 1955 to 1966, the first-place team in each division was idle while its two runners-up faced played a best-of-three. Division finals were expanded to best-of-seven in 1958 and division semifinals to best-of-five in 1961.\n\nWith ten league members again for the 1966\u201367 season, eight teams were again admitted to the tournament, providing a simple three-round knockout (8-team bracket). A year later, the division semifinals were changed to best-of-seven playoff.  Then, in 1975 and 1977, respectively, a fifth and sixth team were added to each Division, necessitating an additional first round of best-of-three series.\n\nFinally in 1984, the tournament expanded to its present 16-team, four-round knockout, and the now-complete set of first-round series were expanded to a best-of-five. In 2003 the first round was changed to also be best-of-seven.\n\nBeginning with the 2004 season, with the addition of the thirtieth NBA franchise, the [[Charlotte Bobcats]], the NBA realigned its divisions. The result was that each conference would have three divisions of five teams each, and the winner of each division was guaranteed a top-three playoff seed. This would change slightly after the 2005\u201306 season; while division winners still receive automatic playoff berths, they are guaranteed a top-''four'' seed, as described below.\n\n===2006 NBA playoffs controversy===\nThe previous playoff format, in place for the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 NBA playoffs, after the NBA was re-aligned into six divisions, created controversy during the 2005\u201306 season and playoffs and would be changed prior to the 2006\u201307 NBA season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2537369 |title=ESPN \u2013 NBA announces postseason seeding format change \u2013 NBA |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |date=2006-08-02 |accessdate=2014-01-30}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 2005, NBA division champions were seeded higher than the other teams in their conference, regardless of their record. Prior to 2004, when the NBA was aligned into two conferences with two divisions each, the division champions were guaranteed the top two seeds. This meant that top two teams in a conference (by record) would be seeded either first and second (if they were in opposite divisions) or first and third (if they were in the same division). Because of the NBA playoffs' preset matchups in the second round, this meant that the top two teams in a conference could never meet until the conference finals, assuming they both made it to that round.\n\nAfter the NBA realigned its two conferences into three divisions each, the seeding rules remained largely unchanged. The top three seeds would now be reserved for division champions. However, this meant that if the top two teams (by record) in a conference were in the same division, they would be seeded first and fourth. Assuming no first-round upsets, this raised the prospect that the top two teams in the conference would face each other in the conference semifinals, instead of the conference finals.\n\nIn the second year of this format, the 2005\u201306 NBA season, the two teams with the best records in the Western Conference, the [[San Antonio Spurs]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]] of the [[Southwest Division (NBA)|Southwest Division]], did just that. The Mavericks had the second-best record in the Western Conference and the third-best record in the entire league, behind the [[Detroit Pistons]] and San Antonio. However, they were seeded fourth because they finished second in the Southwest behind the Spurs. This turn of events led to the playoff format being criticized by many. Besides the prospect of a team losing earlier in the playoffs than its regular-season record or seeding would suggest, critics claimed that it also created an unfair advantage for teams in the 2-7/3-6 half of the Western Conference playoff bracket, who could advance to the conference finals without playing either of the two best teams in the conference in an earlier round.\n\nThe [[Phoenix Suns]], winners of the [[Pacific Division (NBA)|Pacific Division]] and possessors of the third best record, were seeded second, while the [[Denver Nuggets]], winners of the [[Northwest Division (NBA)|Northwest Division]] and tied for only the seventh-best record in the conference, were seeded third.\n\nThe [[Memphis Grizzlies]] and [[Los Angeles Clippers]] met in the second-to-last game of the regular season, after the top four seeds had been clinched. The two teams were already determined to be the fifth and sixth seeds, respectively, and had only to determine which rank higher. The fifth seed would likely need to defeat the best two teams in the conference without home-court advantage to advance to the conference finals, as it would face fourth-seeded Dallas in the first round and likely face first-seeded San Antonio if it managed to defeat Dallas. The sixth seed would play third-seeded Denver in the first round, but would have home-court advantage (since the Grizzlies had the fourth-best record in the conference and the Clippers had the fifth-best), and would not have to face either San Antonio or Dallas until the conference finals at the earliest.\n\nThis led to speculation about whether the Grizzlies or the Clippers would have much commitment to winning their match-up in the second-to-last game of the season, since it was clearly most advantageous to lose the game in order to obtain the 6th seed. The Clippers eventually lost to Memphis without much evidence to support the speculation that the Clippers had lost intentionally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=260418029 |title=No losers here?

Ultimately, Dallas and San Antonio did meet in the second round, with Dallas winning in seven games and advancing all the way to the NBA finals.\n\n===Timeline===\n* [[1947 NBA Playoffs|1947]]: The playoffs were instituted with a three-stage tournament, similar to the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] of the 1930s; the two first-place teams qualified directly to one semifinal where they played each other in a best-of-7 series.  Teams finishing second & third qualified for the best-of-3 quarterfinals, where the two second-placed teams were paired in one quarterfinal, as were the two third-placed teams, and the two quarterfinal winners played each other in a best-of-three semifinal.  The two semifinal winners played each other in the Basketball Association of America (BAA) best-of-7 final series.\n{{3RoundBracket-Byes | RD1= Quarterfinals<br>Best-of-3\n| RD2= Semifinals<br>Best-of-3 (one series)\nBest-of-7 (one series)\n| RD3= BAA finals<br>Best-of-7\n| RD1-seed1=E3\n| RD1-team1=&nbsp;\n| RD1-score1=\n| RD1-seed2=W3\n| RD1-team2=&nbsp;\n| RD1-score2=\n| RD1-seed3=W2\n| RD1-team3=&nbsp;\n| RD1-score3=\n| RD1-seed4=E2\n| RD1-team4=&nbsp;\n| RD1-score4=\n| RD2-seed1=E3\n| RD2-team1=&nbsp;\n| RD2-score1=\n| RD2-seed2=E2\n| RD2-team2=&nbsp;\n| RD2-score2=\n| RD2-seed3=W1\n| RD2-team3=&nbsp;\n| RD2-score3=\n| RD2-seed4=E1\n| RD2-team4=&nbsp;\n| RD2-score4=\n| RD3-seed1=E2\n| RD3-team1=&nbsp;\n| RD3-score1=\n| RD3-seed2=W1\n| RD3-team2=&nbsp;\n| RD3-score2=\n}}\nThere were no [[Bye (sports)|bye]]s, or idle time, for the division champions \u2013 as there would be for higher-seeded playoff teams 1955\u201366 and 1975\u201383. All six 1947 participants played their first tournament games on Wednesday, April 2; in 1948 the two Eastern runners-up (E2, E3 in the figure) were idle for a few days only because there was a three-way Western tie to break. Both winners of the runners-up bracket, Philadelphia in 1947 and Baltimore in 1948, reached the final series having played fewer tournament games than their final opponents, Chicago in 1947 and Philadelphia in 1948, had played in the best-of-7 pairings of division champions. And both winners of the runners-up bracket won the final series. The \"postseason\" actually comprised 11 games played in a span of 21 days for the 1947 Chicago Stags and 13 games in 30 days for 1948 Philadelphia Warriors, the finalists who emerged from the pairing of division champions.<ref name=BBR/>\n\n* [[1949 NBA Playoffs|1949]]: The playoffs were reorganized to match Eastern Division teams exclusively, and Western Division teams exclusively \u2013 in two halves of the bracket, so to speak. Thus the BAA tournament generated a playoff champion in each Division. (So did the NBA in each of three 1950 divisions, and so it has done in each half of the league since then.)<!--evidently under discussion for 2016--> The top four teams from each of the two divisions qualified.  The quarterfinals and semifinals were renamed division semifinals and division finals, respectively, and both rounds were best-of-3.

On numerous occasions, [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] teams with losing records qualified for the playoffs, while [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] teams with winning records ended up missing them, including the [[2011 NBA playoffs|2011]], [[2013 NBA playoffs|2013]] and the [[2015 NBA playoffs]].\n\n==History==\nThe National Basketball Association was established in 1949 by merger of the [[Basketball Association of America]] (BAA) and [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] but it recognizes the three BAA seasons as part of its own history. In all of its three years the BAA champion was finally determined in a best-of-seven series but its first two tournaments, the [[1947 BAA Playoffs|1947]] and [[1948 BAA Playoffs]], were otherwise quite different from the third, which 21st-century NBA playoffs nearly match. In 1947 and 1948, the Eastern and Western Division champions were matched in a [[Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven]] series following the regular season, whose winner advanced to the championship round. Meanwhile, four runners-up played best-of-three series to determine the other finalist: the two second-place teams were matched in one short series and the two third-place teams in another; the winners of those two series played another one. In 1947 the [[Philadelphia Warriors]] won the runners-up bracket and beat the Western champion [[Chicago Stags]] four games to one, which the NBA recognizes as its first championship; in 1948 Baltimore won the runners-up and beat Eastern champion Philadelphia in the final. Both tournaments generated one finalist from the Eastern and one from the Western Division, but only by chance.<ref name=BBR>[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/BAA_1947.html \"1946\u201347 BAA Season Summary\"]. <br>&nbsp; [https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/BAA_1948.html \"1947\u201348 BAA Season Summary\"].

At the same time, the number of playoff teams was increased from three to four from each Division; two rounds of best-of-three series were played, followed by a best-of-seven championship. The main idea was retained by the NBA. Even the [[1950 NBA Playoffs|1950 tournament]], following a transitional season with three divisions rather than two, initially determined one playoff champion from each division. The Central champion [[Minneapolis Lakers]] became the first league champion under the NBA name by defeating Anderson from the West in a best-of-three, with Syracuse from the East idle, and then knocking off the [[Syracuse Nationals]] in six games.<ref name=BBR2>[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/BAA_1949.html \"1948\u201349 BAA Season Summary\"]. <br>&nbsp; [https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1950.html \"1949\u201350 NBA Season Summary\"].

With only nine league members in 1953\u201354, the NBA cut its postseason tournament field from eight teams to six (from 1954 through 1966, the period of eight to nine league members). [[Round-robin tournament|Round robins]] were played in 1954, uniquely in NBA history\u2014a three-team round robin among the three playoff teams in each division. From 1955 to 1966, the first-place team in each division was idle while its two runners-up faced played a best-of-three. Division finals were expanded to best-of-seven in 1958 and division semifinals to best-of-five in 1961.\n\nWith ten league members again for the 1966\u201367 season, eight teams were again admitted to the tournament, providing a simple three-round knockout (8-team bracket). A year later, the division semifinals were changed to best-of-seven playoff.  Then, in 1975 and 1977, respectively, a fifth and sixth team were added to each Division, necessitating an additional first round of best-of-three series.\n\nFinally in 1984, the tournament expanded to its present 16-team, four-round knockout, and the now-complete set of first-round series were expanded to a best-of-five. In 2003 the first round was changed to also be best-of-seven.\n\nBeginning with the 2004 season, with the addition of the thirtieth NBA franchise, the [[Charlotte Bobcats]], the NBA realigned its divisions. The result was that each conference would have three divisions of five teams each, and the winner of each division was guaranteed a top-three playoff seed. This would change slightly after the 2005\u201306 season; while division winners still receive automatic playoff berths, they are guaranteed a top-''four'' seed, as described below.\n\n===2006 NBA playoffs controversy===\nThe previous playoff format, in place for the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 NBA playoffs, after the NBA was re-aligned into six divisions, created controversy during the 2005\u201306 season and playoffs and would be changed prior to the 2006\u201307 NBA season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2537369 |title=ESPN \u2013 NBA announces postseason seeding format change \u2013 NBA |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |date=2006-08-02 |accessdate=2014-01-30}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 2005, NBA division champions were seeded higher than the other teams in their conference, regardless of their record. Prior to 2004, when the NBA was aligned into two conferences with two divisions each, the division champions were guaranteed the top two seeds. This meant that top two teams in a conference (by record) would be seeded either first and second (if they were in opposite divisions) or first and third (if they were in the same division). Because of the NBA playoffs' preset matchups in the second round, this meant that the top two teams in a conference could never meet until the conference finals, assuming they both made it to that round.\n\nAfter the NBA realigned its two conferences into three divisions each, the seeding rules remained largely unchanged. The top three seeds would now be reserved for division champions. However, this meant that if the top two teams (by record) in a conference were in the same division, they would be seeded first and fourth. Assuming no first-round upsets, this raised the prospect that the top two teams in the conference would face each other in the conference semifinals, instead of the conference finals.\n\nIn the second year of this format, the 2005\u201306 NBA season, the two teams with the best records in the Western Conference, the [[San Antonio Spurs]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]] of the [[Southwest Division (NBA)|Southwest Division]], did just that. The Mavericks had the second-best record in the Western Conference and the third-best record in the entire league, behind the [[Detroit Pistons]] and San Antonio. However, they were seeded fourth because they finished second in the Southwest behind the Spurs. This turn of events led to the playoff format being criticized by many. Besides the prospect of a team losing earlier in the playoffs than its regular-season record or seeding would suggest, critics claimed that it also created an unfair advantage for teams in the 2-7/3-6 half of the Western Conference playoff bracket, who could advance to the conference finals without playing either of the two best teams in the conference in an earlier round.\n\nThe [[Phoenix Suns]], winners of the [[Pacific Division (NBA)|Pacific Division]] and possessors of the third best record, were seeded second, while the [[Denver Nuggets]], winners of the [[Northwest Division (NBA)|Northwest Division]] and tied for only the seventh-best record in the conference, were seeded third.\n\nThe [[Memphis Grizzlies]] and [[Los Angeles Clippers]] met in the second-to-last game of the regular season, after the top four seeds had been clinched. The two teams were already determined to be the fifth and sixth seeds, respectively, and had only to determine which rank higher. The fifth seed would likely need to defeat the best two teams in the conference without home-court advantage to advance to the conference finals, as it would face fourth-seeded Dallas in the first round and likely face first-seeded San Antonio if it managed to defeat Dallas. The sixth seed would play third-seeded Denver in the first round, but would have home-court advantage (since the Grizzlies had the fourth-best record in the conference and the Clippers had the fifth-best), and would not have to face either San Antonio or Dallas until the conference finals at the earliest.\n\nThis led to speculation about whether the Grizzlies or the Clippers would have much commitment to winning their match-up in the second-to-last game of the season, since it was clearly most advantageous to lose the game in order to obtain the 6th seed. The Clippers eventually lost to Memphis without much evidence to support the speculation that the Clippers had lost intentionally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=260418029 |title=No losers here?

In 2011, the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] beat the [[San Antonio Spurs]], 4\u20132 and in 2012, the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] beat the [[Chicago Bulls]]  4\u20132.\n* The 1999 Knicks are the only 8th seeded team ever to reach the [[1999 NBA Finals|NBA finals]]; no 8th seeded team has won the NBA finals as of 2019.\n* The 1956\u201357 [[St. Louis Hawks]], 1958\u201359 [[Minneapolis Lakers]] and the 1980\u201381 [[Houston Rockets]] are the only teams with losing records (34-38, 33\u201339 and 40\u201342, respectively) to make it to the NBA finals. In 1981, the Houston Rockets' opponent in the Western Conference Finals, the [[Kansas City Kings]], also had a losing record (40\u201342). [[Boston Celtics]] beat all of these teams in the finals.\n* The [[1994\u201395 Houston Rockets season|1994\u201395 Houston Rockets]], a sixth seed with a record of 47\u201335, are the lowest seeded team to win the NBA finals. In the NBA finals, the Rockets swept the [[Orlando Magic]] (57\u201325) in four games; in doing so, the Rockets defeated four teams that had won 50 or more games during the regular season (the [[Utah Jazz]] at 60\u201322, the [[Phoenix Suns]] at 59\u201323, the [[San Antonio Spurs]] at 62\u201320 and Orlando at 57\u201325), the first time a team had done so. As of now, the 1994-1995 Rockets are the only team to have won an NBA title without having the home-court advantage during any round of the playoffs.\n* The Golden State Warriors own the longest NBA playoff winning streak for a single postseason with 15 straight wins in the 2017 playoffs.  \n* Of all the teams with multiple NBA finals appearances, the [[Chicago Bulls]] are the only team to have never lost in the finals, winning six.\n* The [[Boston Celtics]] possess the most overall NBA finals series wins with an overall record of 17\u20134. The [[Los Angeles Lakers|Los Angeles/Minneapolis Lakers]] have played in the most NBA finals series (31), with an overall record of 16\u201315.\n* The longest active playoff appearance streak currently belongs to the San Antonio Spurs with 22 consecutive appearances in the playoffs, beginning in the 1997\u201398 NBA season. The longest ever streak of playoffs appearances in a row is currently shared between the Spurs and the [[Philadelphia 76ers|Syracuse Nationals/Philadelphia 76ers]], who made the playoffs 22 straight years from the 1949\u201350 season to the 1970\u201371 season.\n* In [[1983 NBA Playoffs|1983]], under the bye-7-7-7 system, the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] attained the best record of 12-1, having only lost in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the [[Milwaukee Bucks]].\n* In [[2001 NBA Playoffs|2001]], under the best of 5-7-7-7 system, the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] attained the best record of 15-1, having only lost in Game 1 of the [[2001 NBA Finals|Finals]] against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]].\n* In [[2017 NBA Playoffs|2017]], under the best of 7-7-7-7 system, the [[Golden State Warriors]] attained the best record of 16-1, having only lost in Game 4 of the [[2017 NBA Finals|Finals]] against the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. The Warriors and Cavaliers came into the Finals with a combined record of 24-1, with the Cavaliers having only lost in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the [[Boston Celtics]].\n* Of the 73 [[List of NBA champions|NBA champions]], 71 of them were either a No. 1 seed (49), a No. 2 seed (16) or a No. 3 seed (6).\n*Of the 73 NBA champions, 38 of them were from the eastern conference while the other 33 were from the western conference. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/teams-with-the-most-nba-championships.html|title=Teams With The Most NBA Championships|website=WorldAtlas|language=en|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n\n==Playoff appearances==\n''Current as of the [[2020 NBA playoffs]]''\n\n===Appearances by active teams===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Team\n!style=\"width:180px\"|Appearances<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stats.nba.com/history/?ls=iref:nba:gnav |title=Franchise History |publisher=NBA.com |date=February 17, 2015 |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Los Angeles Lakers]]\n|61 {{#tag:ref|Includes appearances as the Minneapolis Lakers (1947\u20131960).|group=upper-alpha|name=b}}\n|-\n|[[Boston Celtics]]\n|57\n|-\n|[[Philadelphia 76ers]]\n|49 {{#tag:ref|Includes appearances as the Syracuse Nationals (1946\u20131963).|group=upper-alpha|name=c}}\n|-\n|[[Atlanta Hawks]]\n|46 {{#tag:ref|Includes appearances as the Tri-Cities Blackhawks (1946\u20131951), the Milwaukee Hawks (1951\u20131955), and the St. Louis Hawks (1955\u20131968).|group=upper-alpha|name=d}}\n|-\n|[[Detroit Pistons]]\n|42 {{#tag:ref|Includes appearances as the Fort Wayne Pistons (1949\u20131957).|group=upper-alpha|name=e}}\n|-\n|[[New York Knicks]]\n|41 \n|-\n|[[San Antonio Spurs]]\n|39 {{#tag:ref|Does not include appearances in the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA) playoffs.

\"simplified, yet expressive\": chalices and crucifixes which demonstrated Nugent's interest in modern interpretations of early Christian and [[Romanesque sculpture|Romanesque]] models.<ref

L.

Emergency powers were subsequently invoked by the Prime Minister [[Lon Nol]], who became effective head of state, and led ultimately to the proclamation of the ''[[Khmer Republic]]'' later that year.  It is generally seen as a turning point in the [[Cambodian Civil War]]. No longer a monarchy, Cambodia was semi-officially called ''\"\u00c9tat du Cambodge\"'' (State of Cambodia) in the intervening six months after the coup, until the republic was proclaimed.<ref>The name \"State of Cambodia\" would be later revived under the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] regime between 1989 and 1993. Soizick Crochet, ''Le Cambodge'', Karthala, Paris 1997, {{ISBN|2-86537-722-9}}</ref>\n\nIt also marked the point at which Cambodia became substantially involved in the [[Vietnam War]], as Lon Nol issued an ultimatum to North [[Vietnam]]ese forces to leave Cambodia.\n\n== Background ==\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2020}}\n{{details|Cambodia under Sihanouk (1954\u20131970)}}\n\nSince independence from France in 1954, Cambodia had been led by Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]], whose [[Sangkum]] political movement had retained power after winning the [[1955 Cambodian parliamentary election|1955 parliamentary election]]. In 1963, Sihanouk had forced the National Assembly to approve a constitutional amendment that made him head of state with no fixed term of office. He had retained domestic power through a combination of political manipulation, intimidation, patronage, and careful balancing of left- and right-wing elements within his government; whilst placating the right with nationalist rhetoric, he appropriated much of the language of socialism to marginalize the Cambodian communist movement, whom he called the ''[[Khmers rouges]]'' (\"Red Khmers\").\n\nWith the [[Second Indochina War]] escalating, Sihanouk's balancing act between left and right became harder to maintain. Cross-border smuggling of rice also began to have a serious effect on the Cambodian economy.<ref name=kiernan228>Kiernan, B. ''How Pol Pot came to power'', Yale UP, p.228</ref> In the Cambodian elections of 1966, the usual Sangkum policy of having one candidate in each electoral district was abandoned; there was a huge swing to the right, especially as left-wing deputies had to compete directly with members of the traditional elite, who were able to use their local influence.<ref name=kiernan232>Kiernan, p.232</ref> Although a few communists within the Sangkum \u2013 such as [[Hou Yuon]] and [[Khieu Samphan]] \u2013 chose to stand, most leftists were decisively defeated. Lon Nol, a rightist who had been a longstanding associate of Sihanouk, became Prime Minister.\n\nBy 1969, Lon Nol and the rightists were growing increasingly frustrated with Sihanouk. Although the basis for this was partly economic, political considerations were also involved. In particular, the nationalist and anti-communist sensibilities of Lon Nol and his associates meant that Sihanouk's policy of semi-toleration of [[Viet Cong]] and [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) activity within Cambodian borders was unacceptable; Sihanouk, during his swing to the left in 1963\u201366, had negotiated a secret arrangement with [[Hanoi]] whereby in return for the guaranteed purchase of rice at inflated prices, the port of [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]] was opened for weapons shipments to the Viet Cong. As well as the rightist nationalists, the liberal modernising elements within the Sangkum, headed by [[In Tam]], had also become increasingly alienated by Sihanouk's autocratic style.\n\n== Overthrow of Sihanouk ==\nIn March 1970, while Sihanouk was touring Europe, the [[Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]], large-scale anti-Vietnamese demonstrations erupted in [[Phnom Penh]]. Crowds attacked the [[North Vietnam]]ese and Viet Cong embassies. Sihanouk initially gave a certain degree of support to the demonstrators; he hoped Moscow and Beijing would pressure North Vietnam to reduce its presence in Cambodia. Indeed, it has even been suggested (by [[William Shawcross]] and others) that Sihanouk and Lon Nol may have planned the first demonstrations to gain political leverage against Hanoi.\n\nThe riots, however, escalated beyond the government's control \u2013 although this was likely done with a degree of encouragement from Lon Nol and Sirik Matak \u2013 and the embassy was sacked. Inside, a \"contingency plan\" was allegedly found for the communists to occupy Cambodia. On 12 March, Sirik Matak cancelled Sihanouk's trade agreement with North Vietnam; Lon Nol closed the port of Sihanoukville to the North Vietnamese and issued an impossible ultimatum to them: all PAVN and Viet Cong forces were to withdraw from Cambodian soil within 72 hours (on 15 March) or face military action.<ref name=sutsakhan42>[http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/star/images/239/2390505001A.pdf Sutsakhan, Lt.

Emergency powers were subsequently invoked by the Prime Minister [[Lon Nol]], who became effective head of state, and led ultimately to the proclamation of the ''[[Khmer Republic]]'' later that year.  It is generally seen as a turning point in the [[Cambodian Civil War]]. No longer a monarchy, Cambodia was semi-officially called ''\"\u00c9tat du Cambodge\"'' (State of Cambodia) in the intervening six months after the coup, until the republic was proclaimed.<ref>The name \"State of Cambodia\" would be later revived under the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] regime between 1989 and 1993. Soizick Crochet, ''Le Cambodge'', Karthala, Paris 1997, {{ISBN|2-86537-722-9}}</ref>\n\nIt also marked the point at which Cambodia became substantially involved in the [[Vietnam War]], as Lon Nol issued an ultimatum to North [[Vietnam]]ese forces to leave Cambodia.\n\n== Background ==\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2020}}\n{{details|Cambodia under Sihanouk (1954\u20131970)}}\n\nSince independence from France in 1954, Cambodia had been led by Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]], whose [[Sangkum]] political movement had retained power after winning the [[1955 Cambodian parliamentary election|1955 parliamentary election]]. In 1963, Sihanouk had forced the National Assembly to approve a constitutional amendment that made him head of state with no fixed term of office. He had retained domestic power through a combination of political manipulation, intimidation, patronage, and careful balancing of left- and right-wing elements within his government; whilst placating the right with nationalist rhetoric, he appropriated much of the language of socialism to marginalize the Cambodian communist movement, whom he called the ''[[Khmers rouges]]'' (\"Red Khmers\").\n\nWith the [[Second Indochina War]] escalating, Sihanouk's balancing act between left and right became harder to maintain. Cross-border smuggling of rice also began to have a serious effect on the Cambodian economy.<ref name=kiernan228>Kiernan, B. ''How Pol Pot came to power'', Yale UP, p.228</ref> In the Cambodian elections of 1966, the usual Sangkum policy of having one candidate in each electoral district was abandoned; there was a huge swing to the right, especially as left-wing deputies had to compete directly with members of the traditional elite, who were able to use their local influence.<ref name=kiernan232>Kiernan, p.232</ref> Although a few communists within the Sangkum \u2013 such as [[Hou Yuon]] and [[Khieu Samphan]] \u2013 chose to stand, most leftists were decisively defeated. Lon Nol, a rightist who had been a longstanding associate of Sihanouk, became Prime Minister.\n\nBy 1969, Lon Nol and the rightists were growing increasingly frustrated with Sihanouk. Although the basis for this was partly economic, political considerations were also involved. In particular, the nationalist and anti-communist sensibilities of Lon Nol and his associates meant that Sihanouk's policy of semi-toleration of [[Viet Cong]] and [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) activity within Cambodian borders was unacceptable; Sihanouk, during his swing to the left in 1963\u201366, had negotiated a secret arrangement with [[Hanoi]] whereby in return for the guaranteed purchase of rice at inflated prices, the port of [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]] was opened for weapons shipments to the Viet Cong. As well as the rightist nationalists, the liberal modernising elements within the Sangkum, headed by [[In Tam]], had also become increasingly alienated by Sihanouk's autocratic style.\n\n== Overthrow of Sihanouk ==\nIn March 1970, while Sihanouk was touring Europe, the [[Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]], large-scale anti-Vietnamese demonstrations erupted in [[Phnom Penh]]. Crowds attacked the [[North Vietnam]]ese and Viet Cong embassies. Sihanouk initially gave a certain degree of support to the demonstrators; he hoped Moscow and Beijing would pressure North Vietnam to reduce its presence in Cambodia. Indeed, it has even been suggested (by [[William Shawcross]] and others) that Sihanouk and Lon Nol may have planned the first demonstrations to gain political leverage against Hanoi.\n\nThe riots, however, escalated beyond the government's control \u2013 although this was likely done with a degree of encouragement from Lon Nol and Sirik Matak \u2013 and the embassy was sacked. Inside, a \"contingency plan\" was allegedly found for the communists to occupy Cambodia. On 12 March, Sirik Matak cancelled Sihanouk's trade agreement with North Vietnam; Lon Nol closed the port of Sihanoukville to the North Vietnamese and issued an impossible ultimatum to them: all PAVN and Viet Cong forces were to withdraw from Cambodian soil within 72 hours (on 15 March) or face military action.<ref name=sutsakhan42>[http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/star/images/239/2390505001A.pdf Sutsakhan, Lt.

In the [[ufology|ufological]] and skeptical communities, Klass inspires polarized appraisals. He has been called the \"[[Sherlock Holmes]] of UFOlogy\".<ref name = posner1999 />  Klass demonstrated \"the crusader's zeal for what seems 'right,' regardless of whether it brings popular acclaim,\" a trait he claimed his father instilled in him.<ref name=\"Longden\">{{cite web | last = Longden | first =  Tom | title = Famous Iowans: Philip Klass | work = [[The Des Moines Register|DesMoinesRegister.com]] | publisher =  [[Gannett Company|Gannett]] | url = http://data.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/famous-iowans/philip-klass | accessdate = 2013-05-27}}</ref>  \"I've found,\" said Klass, \"that roughly 97, 98 percent of the people who report seeing UFOs are fundamentally intelligent, honest people who have seen something&nbsp;\u2014 usually at night, in darkness&nbsp;\u2014 that is unfamiliar, that they cannot explain.\"  The rest, he said, were frauds.<ref name=\"NYSun\">{{cite news | last = Miller | first =  Stephen | title = Philip Klass, 85, Journalist, Debunked UFO Reports | newspaper = [[The New York Sun]] | publisher = TWO SL LLC | date = 2005-08-12 | url = http://www.nysun.com/obituaries/philip-klass-85-journalist-debunked-ufo-reports/18507/ | accessdate = 2013-05-27}}</ref>\n\nLongtime ufologist [[James W. Moseley]] illustrated the ambivalence many UFO researchers feel about Klass. On the one hand, Moseley argued that Klass was sincere in his motives and that his work ultimately benefited the field of [[Ufology]].

Fuller]]'s ''[[Exeter incident|Incident at Exeter]]'' (1966), about a series of UFO sightings in and around [[Exeter, New Hampshire]].<ref name=\"blum215\"/> Noting that many of the Exeter UFO incidents took place close to high-power electric lines, Klass suspected that the UFO reports were best explained as a previously unknown type of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] or [[ball lightning]] that might have been generated from the power lines or their transformers. A plasma, thought Klass, could be consistent with many UFO reports of bright lights moving erratically; a highly charged plasma might further explain the reported effects of UFOs on the electrical systems of airplanes and automobiles.  Klass wrote up his theory in a review of Fuller's book which was published in Aviation Week.  This was followed by another skeptical review of work by the [[National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena]] (NICAP).  These articles garnered Klass tremendous attention within the UFO community, and, as Howard Blum put it, \"...&nbsp;as if overnight, he had been christened by both friends and foes 'the country's leading UFO debunker'\".<ref name=\"blum215\"/>\n\nKlass initially applied his ball lightning theory cautiously and selectively in a series of magazine articles. He and physicist [[James E. McDonald]] exchanged cordial letters on the subject, and McDonald agreed that some UFOs might be a type of ball lighting.<ref name = \"druffel2003\">{{cite book | last = Druffel | first = Ann | authorlink = Ann Druffel | title = Firestorm : Dr. James E.

Eventually, Klass wrote to McDonald's superiors at the U.S. Navy (McDonald was formally retired from the Navy, but often worked with the [[Office of Naval Research]]), questioning how McDonald could spend so much time on UFO research and still fulfill the requirements for his atmospheric research grant. This did not result in McDonald losing ONR funding but did draw some criticism of Klass from members of the UFO community.<ref name = \"moseley230\"/><ref>{{cite web | last = Klass | first = Philip | title = Klass Notes on James McDonald | publisher = Robert Sheaffer | url = http://www.debunker.com/historical/KlassContraMcDonald_1968.pdf | accessdate = 7 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nCriticism was also expressed by a more skeptical team of plasma experts assembled by the [[Condon Committee]], all of whom rejected Klass's plasma theory as unscientific.<ref name = clark369/> Since that time, theories evoking similar phenomena with widely differing modes of generation have been proposed by commentators such as [[Michael Persinger]], Terence Meaden, Albert Budden,<ref>{{cite book | last = Budden | first = Albert | title = Electric UFOs : Fireballs, Electromagnetics and Abnormal States | publisher = Blandford | location = London | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780713726855 | oclc = 40603724}}</ref> and [[Paul Devereux]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Devereux | first = Paul | authorlink = Paul Devereux| title = Earth Lights Revelation : UFOs and Mystery Lightform Phenomena : The Earth's Secret Energy Force | publisher = Blandford, distributed in the U.S. by [[Sterling Publishing|Sterling]] | location = London; New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780713722093 | oclc = 22747523}}</ref> In 1999 the MoD [[Project Condign]] report proposed that \"Unidentified Aerial Phenomena\" (UAPs) comparable to the plasmas originally advocated by Klass (but as amended by Devereux and Randles) may represent a viable explanation for some UFO events. Therefore, while his original concept was discredited, it has been adapted by others, and in this regard Klass is regarded as a pioneer of this approach.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Klass quietly abandoned his plasma theory and afterwards argued that all UFO sightings could be explained as misidentification of normal phenomena (such as clouds, stars, comets, or airplanes) and/or as [[hoax]]es. [[Jerome Clark]] contends<ref name = clark369/><ref name = clark1981/> that Klass argued in favor of hoaxes more than almost any other UFO skeptic, but that Klass rarely had evidence in favor of his accusations; this position was echoed by Don Ecker,<ref>{{citation | last = Ecker | first = Don | title = Editorial: Skeptics or Debunkers? | work = UFO Enigma | publisher = Destination Space | date = 2003-10-07 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070203091643/http://www.destinationspace.net/ufo/ufomag/ufomag1008.asp | archivedate = 2007-02-03 | url = http://www.destinationspace.net/ufo/ufomag/ufomag1008.asp}}</ref> who asserted that during a 1992 debate, Klass made unsubstantiated charges of \"[[drug smuggling]]\" against Australian pilot [[Frederick Valentich]], who disappeared in 1978 after claiming a strange UFO was flying near his airplane.\n\nKlass was a founding fellow of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]] (CSICOP, now the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI)) and served on its executive council and UFO subcommittee.

He seemed to have an acute understanding of his position in both his career and his hobby and the power that position afforded him.  When he learned of Friedman's plans to move to Canada in 1980, Klass wrote a letter to A.G. McNamara with the [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]] at the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] in [[Ottawa]].  For decades the NRC had been the unwilling recipient of UFO reports collected by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].  The NRC did not research the reports they received; they merely classified them as \"meteorite\" or \"non-meteorite\" and filed them.  The purpose of Klass's letter was to bring \"bad tidings\" - that Stanton Friedman was moving to Canada.  Klass warned that Friedman would begin accusing them of UFO coverups.  He then went on to smear Friedman's professionalism, while simultaneously claiming to be Friedman's friend when discussing topics other than UFOs.  Ten days later a memo was sent within the NRC management which said, \"I don't know what we can do to prepare for the arrival in Canada of this man Friedman, but if he acts as Klass predicts we can ill afford the publicity he will generate for us.\"  The decision was made quickly to turn over all UFO reports older than a year to the [[Library and Archives Canada|Public Archives of Canada]].  Klass's single letter apparently prompted a major records relocation in Canada and subsequently made Friedman's research easier than it otherwise might have been.<ref>{{Citation | last = Dolan | first = Richard | author-link = Richard M.

In an undated paper on the Canadian UFO situation in Canada, Friedman charged that \"two government-sponsored investigative bodies\" had covered up UFO information, and the government had \"hidden or destroyed\" further information.  In the same paper Friedman also told a different version of the events leading to the Canadian UFO records being moved to the public archives.  He claims that efforts by a \"Canadian researcher\" with the legal name of Mr. X and Friedman himself were responsible for having the records transferred.<ref>{{cite web | last = Friedman | first = Stanton | title = The Canadian UFO Scene | publisher = Patrick Gross | url = http://ufologie.patrickgross.org/htm/friedmancanada.htm | accessdate = 30 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Michael Sokolove wrote in his article \"The Debunkers\": \"Klass was the voice of cool reason, seeking to demonstrate that a temporary inability to fill in the whole story should not open the door to wild speculation. His real argument, like all debunkers', was not with the people who believed that they had witnessed or experienced some paranormal event but with those who made an industry of igniting their imaginations.\"<ref>{{citation | first = Michael | last = Sokolove | title = The lives they lived; The debunker | magazine = [[The New York Times Magazine]] | date = 2005-12-25 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E5DA1730F936A15751C1A9639C8B63}}</ref>\n\nKlass was willing to argue for his opinions wherever he perceived a challenge.  In February 1975 he called the editor of the [[FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin]] and \"in strong terms laced with sarcasm he derided our publication of the article by [[J. Allen Hynek]], 'The UFO Mystery'\".  Klass accused the FBI of perpetuating a hoax in the form of extraterrestrial UFOs and referred to Hynek as a fraud.  The editor explained to Klass that at no point did Hynek say that UFOs were extraterrestrial in origin, and that UFOs present a unique problem for law enforcement as they are often the first people called when a UFO is spotted.  The editor also defended Hynek as a \"widely respected scientist... affiliated with a leading university\", to which Klass replied, \"He won't be for long!\"  Klass followed up with a letter to the LEB offering a rebuttal article, but the offer was declined.<ref name=\"fbi1\"/>\n\nIn 1987, Klass first saw the [[Majestic 12]] documents.  These were a set of documents \"discovered\" by ufologist [[Bill Moore (ufologist)|Bill Moore]] and his associate, television producer Jaime Shandera.  The documents appeared to prove a government cover-up of an alien crash at [[Roswell, New Mexico]], in 1947.  Klass immediately doubted the authenticity of the documents and set about trying to prove his suspicions.  Klass was able to raise numerous questions about each document, but after several months he realized that only the government was in a position to debunk them.  In late 1987 Klass wrote to the FBI to inform them that Moore was distributing what appeared to be top secret documents.  This prompted a lengthy investigation, but definitive proof was never forthcoming from that investigation.  In the end the consensus sided with Klass, with Friedman being the only central figure in the controversy to maintain the documents' authenticity.<ref name=\"blum215\"/>  Klass did find then-classified documents that failed to mention anything about aliens.<ref>{{Scientific American Frontiers|8|2}}</ref>\n\nIn Gary Posner's 1999 interview, Klass explained his views on UFOs: \"As I turn 80, my fondest hope is that a genuine ET craft will land on our back patio and that I will be abducted. Hopefully, with the ETs' advanced technology and knowledge, they will be able to cure my spinal and walking problems and the damage to my vocal cord. Of course, I would have to pay Stanton Friedman $10,000 \u2014 based on my long-standing wager that UFOs will never be proven real \u2014 but I would expect to become wealthy from the royalties of a new book titled ''Why Me, ET?''. And instead of spending many hours each week 'debunking' UFOs, I'll finally have time to watch some TV, go to the movies, and perhaps get to read a few non-UFO books for enjoyment.\"<ref name = posner1999/>\n\n[[Image:PipSmith DickSmith Klass Sheaffer JohnMerrell Randi.jpg|thumb|250px|1983 CSICOP Conference in Buffalo, NY.

By 1974, the offer had changed slightly, to the following form:\n* Klass agrees to pay to the second party the sum of $10,000 within thirty days after ''any'' of the following occur:\n: (A) Any crashed spacecraft, or major piece of a spacecraft is found to be clearly of extraterrestrial origin by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], or\n: (B) The National Academy of Sciences announces that it has examined other evidence which conclusively proves that Earth has been visited by extraterrestrial spacecraft in the 20th century, or\n: (C) A bona fide extraterrestrial visitor, born on a celestial body other than the Earth, appears live before the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the [[United Nations]] or on a national television program.\n* The party accepting this offer pays Klass $100 per year, for a maximum of ten years, each year none of these things occur.<ref name=\"klass1\">{{cite book | last = Klass | first = Philip J. | title = UFOs explained | publisher = [[Random House]] | location = New York | year = 1975 | isbn = 9780394492155 | oclc = 979190 | pages = 355\u2013359}}</ref>\n\nKlass made this offer openly to anyone. The offer was specifically declined by [[Frank Edwards (writer and broadcaster)|Frank Edwards]], [[John G. Fuller]], [[J. Allen Hynek]], and [[James Harder]], some of whom were the most vocal promoters of the [[extraterrestrial hypothesis]]. One person entered into the agreement with Klass. A man in [[Seattle, Washington]], accepted the terms in 1969 and made two annual payments of $100. Then in 1971 he wrongly claimed the prize. When it was pointed out that his claim didn't meet any of the conditions, the man let the agreement lapse. In his book ''UFOs Explained'', Klass offered to refund the full purchase price to every reader of the book if any of the conditions of his \"UFO challenge\" were ever met.<ref name=\"klass1\"/>\n\nIn another challenge, Klass claimed lexicographic inconsistencies based on the use of Pica typeface in [[MJ 12#The Cutler/Twining memo|the Cutler/Twining memo]] and offered $100 to Stanton Friedman for each legitimate example of the use of the same style and size Pica type as used in the memo. Friedman provided 14 examples and was paid $1,000 by Klass.<ref>{{cite book | last = Friedman | first = Stanton | authorlink = | title = Flying Saucers and Science : A Scientist Investigates the Mysteries of UFOs : Interstellar Travel, Crashes, and Government Cover-ups | page = 262 | publisher = New Page Books | location = Franklin Lakes, NJ | year = 2008 | isbn = 9781601630117 | oclc = 179812690}}</ref>\n\n===The UFO curse===\nKlass left this statement, originally published in Moseley's newsletter ''Saucer Smear'' on October 10, 1983.<ref name = \"moseley323\">Moseley (2002), p. 323-24</ref>\n{{quotation|THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF PHILIP J.

In the [[ufology|ufological]] and skeptical communities, Klass inspires polarized appraisals. He has been called the \"[[Sherlock Holmes]] of UFOlogy\".<ref name = posner1999 />  Klass demonstrated \"the crusader's zeal for what seems 'right,' regardless of whether it brings popular acclaim,\" a trait he claimed his father instilled in him.<ref name=\"Longden\">{{cite web | last = Longden | first =  Tom | title = Famous Iowans: Philip Klass | work = [[The Des Moines Register|DesMoinesRegister.com]] | publisher =  [[Gannett Company|Gannett]] | url = http://data.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/famous-iowans/philip-klass | accessdate = 2013-05-27}}</ref>  \"I've found,\" said Klass, \"that roughly 97, 98 percent of the people who report seeing UFOs are fundamentally intelligent, honest people who have seen something&nbsp;\u2014 usually at night, in darkness&nbsp;\u2014 that is unfamiliar, that they cannot explain.\"  The rest, he said, were frauds.<ref name=\"NYSun\">{{cite news | last = Miller | first =  Stephen | title = Philip Klass, 85, Journalist, Debunked UFO Reports | newspaper = [[The New York Sun]] | publisher = TWO SL LLC | date = 2005-08-12 | url = http://www.nysun.com/obituaries/philip-klass-85-journalist-debunked-ufo-reports/18507/ | accessdate = 2013-05-27}}</ref>\n\nLongtime ufologist [[James W. Moseley]] illustrated the ambivalence many UFO researchers feel about Klass. On the one hand, Moseley argued that Klass was sincere in his motives and that his work ultimately benefited the field of [[Ufology]]. In his memoirs, Moseley contended that, when pressed, most leading ufologists would admit that Klass knew the subject and the people involved and was welcomed, or at least pleasantly tolerated, at UFO meetings.<ref name = \"moseley230\">{{cite book | last = Moseley | first = James W. | authorlink1=James W.

Fuller]]'s ''[[Exeter incident|Incident at Exeter]]'' (1966), about a series of UFO sightings in and around [[Exeter, New Hampshire]].<ref name=\"blum215\"/> Noting that many of the Exeter UFO incidents took place close to high-power electric lines, Klass suspected that the UFO reports were best explained as a previously unknown type of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] or [[ball lightning]] that might have been generated from the power lines or their transformers. A plasma, thought Klass, could be consistent with many UFO reports of bright lights moving erratically; a highly charged plasma might further explain the reported effects of UFOs on the electrical systems of airplanes and automobiles.  Klass wrote up his theory in a review of Fuller's book which was published in Aviation Week.  This was followed by another skeptical review of work by the [[National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena]] (NICAP).  These articles garnered Klass tremendous attention within the UFO community, and, as Howard Blum put it, \"...&nbsp;as if overnight, he had been christened by both friends and foes 'the country's leading UFO debunker'\".<ref name=\"blum215\"/>\n\nKlass initially applied his ball lightning theory cautiously and selectively in a series of magazine articles. He and physicist [[James E. McDonald]] exchanged cordial letters on the subject, and McDonald agreed that some UFOs might be a type of ball lighting.<ref name = \"druffel2003\">{{cite book | last = Druffel | first = Ann | authorlink = Ann Druffel | title = Firestorm : Dr. James E.

Eventually, Klass wrote to McDonald's superiors at the U.S. Navy (McDonald was formally retired from the Navy, but often worked with the [[Office of Naval Research]]), questioning how McDonald could spend so much time on UFO research and still fulfill the requirements for his atmospheric research grant. This did not result in McDonald losing ONR funding but did draw some criticism of Klass from members of the UFO community.<ref name = \"moseley230\"/><ref>{{cite web | last = Klass | first = Philip | title = Klass Notes on James McDonald | publisher = Robert Sheaffer | url = http://www.debunker.com/historical/KlassContraMcDonald_1968.pdf | accessdate = 7 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nCriticism was also expressed by a more skeptical team of plasma experts assembled by the [[Condon Committee]], all of whom rejected Klass's plasma theory as unscientific.<ref name = clark369/> Since that time, theories evoking similar phenomena with widely differing modes of generation have been proposed by commentators such as [[Michael Persinger]], Terence Meaden, Albert Budden,<ref>{{cite book | last = Budden | first = Albert | title = Electric UFOs : Fireballs, Electromagnetics and Abnormal States | publisher = Blandford | location = London | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780713726855 | oclc = 40603724}}</ref> and [[Paul Devereux]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Devereux | first = Paul | authorlink = Paul Devereux| title = Earth Lights Revelation : UFOs and Mystery Lightform Phenomena : The Earth's Secret Energy Force | publisher = Blandford, distributed in the U.S. by [[Sterling Publishing|Sterling]] | location = London; New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780713722093 | oclc = 22747523}}</ref> In 1999 the MoD [[Project Condign]] report proposed that \"Unidentified Aerial Phenomena\" (UAPs) comparable to the plasmas originally advocated by Klass (but as amended by Devereux and Randles) may represent a viable explanation for some UFO events. Therefore, while his original concept was discredited, it has been adapted by others, and in this regard Klass is regarded as a pioneer of this approach.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Klass quietly abandoned his plasma theory and afterwards argued that all UFO sightings could be explained as misidentification of normal phenomena (such as clouds, stars, comets, or airplanes) and/or as [[hoax]]es. [[Jerome Clark]] contends<ref name = clark369/><ref name = clark1981/> that Klass argued in favor of hoaxes more than almost any other UFO skeptic, but that Klass rarely had evidence in favor of his accusations; this position was echoed by Don Ecker,<ref>{{citation | last = Ecker | first = Don | title = Editorial: Skeptics or Debunkers? | work = UFO Enigma | publisher = Destination Space | date = 2003-10-07 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070203091643/http://www.destinationspace.net/ufo/ufomag/ufomag1008.asp | archivedate = 2007-02-03 | url = http://www.destinationspace.net/ufo/ufomag/ufomag1008.asp}}</ref> who asserted that during a 1992 debate, Klass made unsubstantiated charges of \"[[drug smuggling]]\" against Australian pilot [[Frederick Valentich]], who disappeared in 1978 after claiming a strange UFO was flying near his airplane.\n\nKlass was a founding fellow of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]] (CSICOP, now the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI)) and served on its executive council and UFO subcommittee.  He conducted a number of skeptic-centered reports on UFOs and UFO sightings.<ref name = posner1999 /><ref name = obit/> He published the bimonthly ''Skeptics UFO Newsletter'' for several years and wrote several books on the subject (see below).\n\nIn the 1970s, Klass heaped praise on astronomer and UFO investigator [[Allan Hendry]]'s ''The UFO Handbook'', but Hendry<ref name=clark1981>{{citation | last = Clark | first = Jerome | authorlink =  | title = Phil Klass vs. The \"UFO Promoters\" | magazine = [[Fate (magazine)|Fate]] | date = February 1981 }}. republished [http://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc402.htm here].</ref> objected strongly to Klass's ''[[modus operandi]]'', which Hendry argued consisted of suppressing and distorting evidence, unscientific reasoning, ''[[ad hominem]]'' attacks, [[smear campaign]]s, scientific [[bait and switch]] tactics, and seemingly refusing to evaluate evidence that conflicted with his preconceptions. Nuclear physicist and UFO researcher [[Stanton T. Friedman]] also frequently jousted with Klass.<ref name = blum215/><ref>{{citation | last = Friedman | first = Stanton | authorlink = Stanton T.

He seemed to have an acute understanding of his position in both his career and his hobby and the power that position afforded him.  When he learned of Friedman's plans to move to Canada in 1980, Klass wrote a letter to A.G. McNamara with the [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]] at the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] in [[Ottawa]].  For decades the NRC had been the unwilling recipient of UFO reports collected by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].  The NRC did not research the reports they received; they merely classified them as \"meteorite\" or \"non-meteorite\" and filed them.  The purpose of Klass's letter was to bring \"bad tidings\" - that Stanton Friedman was moving to Canada.  Klass warned that Friedman would begin accusing them of UFO coverups.  He then went on to smear Friedman's professionalism, while simultaneously claiming to be Friedman's friend when discussing topics other than UFOs.  Ten days later a memo was sent within the NRC management which said, \"I don't know what we can do to prepare for the arrival in Canada of this man Friedman, but if he acts as Klass predicts we can ill afford the publicity he will generate for us.\"  The decision was made quickly to turn over all UFO reports older than a year to the [[Library and Archives Canada|Public Archives of Canada]].  Klass's single letter apparently prompted a major records relocation in Canada and subsequently made Friedman's research easier than it otherwise might have been.<ref>{{Citation | last = Dolan | first = Richard | author-link = Richard M.

In an undated paper on the Canadian UFO situation in Canada, Friedman charged that \"two government-sponsored investigative bodies\" had covered up UFO information, and the government had \"hidden or destroyed\" further information.  In the same paper Friedman also told a different version of the events leading to the Canadian UFO records being moved to the public archives.  He claims that efforts by a \"Canadian researcher\" with the legal name of Mr. X and Friedman himself were responsible for having the records transferred.<ref>{{cite web | last = Friedman | first = Stanton | title = The Canadian UFO Scene | publisher = Patrick Gross | url = http://ufologie.patrickgross.org/htm/friedmancanada.htm | accessdate = 30 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Michael Sokolove wrote in his article \"The Debunkers\": \"Klass was the voice of cool reason, seeking to demonstrate that a temporary inability to fill in the whole story should not open the door to wild speculation. His real argument, like all debunkers', was not with the people who believed that they had witnessed or experienced some paranormal event but with those who made an industry of igniting their imaginations.\"<ref>{{citation | first = Michael | last = Sokolove | title = The lives they lived; The debunker | magazine = [[The New York Times Magazine]] | date = 2005-12-25 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E5DA1730F936A15751C1A9639C8B63}}</ref>\n\nKlass was willing to argue for his opinions wherever he perceived a challenge.  In February 1975 he called the editor of the [[FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin]] and \"in strong terms laced with sarcasm he derided our publication of the article by [[J. Allen Hynek]], 'The UFO Mystery'\".  Klass accused the FBI of perpetuating a hoax in the form of extraterrestrial UFOs and referred to Hynek as a fraud.  The editor explained to Klass that at no point did Hynek say that UFOs were extraterrestrial in origin, and that UFOs present a unique problem for law enforcement as they are often the first people called when a UFO is spotted.  The editor also defended Hynek as a \"widely respected scientist... affiliated with a leading university\", to which Klass replied, \"He won't be for long!\"  Klass followed up with a letter to the LEB offering a rebuttal article, but the offer was declined.<ref name=\"fbi1\"/>\n\nIn 1987, Klass first saw the [[Majestic 12]] documents.  These were a set of documents \"discovered\" by ufologist [[Bill Moore (ufologist)|Bill Moore]] and his associate, television producer Jaime Shandera.  The documents appeared to prove a government cover-up of an alien crash at [[Roswell, New Mexico]], in 1947.  Klass immediately doubted the authenticity of the documents and set about trying to prove his suspicions.  Klass was able to raise numerous questions about each document, but after several months he realized that only the government was in a position to debunk them.  In late 1987 Klass wrote to the FBI to inform them that Moore was distributing what appeared to be top secret documents.  This prompted a lengthy investigation, but definitive proof was never forthcoming from that investigation.  In the end the consensus sided with Klass, with Friedman being the only central figure in the controversy to maintain the documents' authenticity.<ref name=\"blum215\"/>  Klass did find then-classified documents that failed to mention anything about aliens.<ref>{{Scientific American Frontiers|8|2}}</ref>\n\nIn Gary Posner's 1999 interview, Klass explained his views on UFOs: \"As I turn 80, my fondest hope is that a genuine ET craft will land on our back patio and that I will be abducted. Hopefully, with the ETs' advanced technology and knowledge, they will be able to cure my spinal and walking problems and the damage to my vocal cord. Of course, I would have to pay Stanton Friedman $10,000 \u2014 based on my long-standing wager that UFOs will never be proven real \u2014 but I would expect to become wealthy from the royalties of a new book titled ''Why Me, ET?''. And instead of spending many hours each week 'debunking' UFOs, I'll finally have time to watch some TV, go to the movies, and perhaps get to read a few non-UFO books for enjoyment.\"<ref name = posner1999/>\n\n[[Image:PipSmith DickSmith Klass Sheaffer JohnMerrell Randi.jpg|thumb|250px|1983 CSICOP Conference in Buffalo, NY.

By 1974, the offer had changed slightly, to the following form:\n* Klass agrees to pay to the second party the sum of $10,000 within thirty days after ''any'' of the following occur:\n: (A) Any crashed spacecraft, or major piece of a spacecraft is found to be clearly of extraterrestrial origin by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], or\n: (B) The National Academy of Sciences announces that it has examined other evidence which conclusively proves that Earth has been visited by extraterrestrial spacecraft in the 20th century, or\n: (C) A bona fide extraterrestrial visitor, born on a celestial body other than the Earth, appears live before the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the [[United Nations]] or on a national television program.\n* The party accepting this offer pays Klass $100 per year, for a maximum of ten years, each year none of these things occur.<ref name=\"klass1\">{{cite book | last = Klass | first = Philip J. | title = UFOs explained | publisher = [[Random House]] | location = New York | year = 1975 | isbn = 9780394492155 | oclc = 979190 | pages = 355\u2013359}}</ref>\n\nKlass made this offer openly to anyone. The offer was specifically declined by [[Frank Edwards (writer and broadcaster)|Frank Edwards]], [[John G. Fuller]], [[J. Allen Hynek]], and [[James Harder]], some of whom were the most vocal promoters of the [[extraterrestrial hypothesis]]. One person entered into the agreement with Klass. A man in [[Seattle, Washington]], accepted the terms in 1969 and made two annual payments of $100. Then in 1971 he wrongly claimed the prize. When it was pointed out that his claim didn't meet any of the conditions, the man let the agreement lapse. In his book ''UFOs Explained'', Klass offered to refund the full purchase price to every reader of the book if any of the conditions of his \"UFO challenge\" were ever met.<ref name=\"klass1\"/>\n\nIn another challenge, Klass claimed lexicographic inconsistencies based on the use of Pica typeface in [[MJ 12#The Cutler/Twining memo|the Cutler/Twining memo]] and offered $100 to Stanton Friedman for each legitimate example of the use of the same style and size Pica type as used in the memo. Friedman provided 14 examples and was paid $1,000 by Klass.<ref>{{cite book | last = Friedman | first = Stanton | authorlink = | title = Flying Saucers and Science : A Scientist Investigates the Mysteries of UFOs : Interstellar Travel, Crashes, and Government Cover-ups | page = 262 | publisher = New Page Books | location = Franklin Lakes, NJ | year = 2008 | isbn = 9781601630117 | oclc = 179812690}}</ref>\n\n===The UFO curse===\nKlass left this statement, originally published in Moseley's newsletter ''Saucer Smear'' on October 10, 1983.<ref name = \"moseley323\">Moseley (2002), p. 323-24</ref>\n{{quotation|THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF PHILIP J.

It lies approximately 200&nbsp;km south-west of [[Surabaya]], the provincial capital of East Java. The regency lies between 92 and 2,563 meters above sea level and covers an area of about 1,305.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.\n\n==History==\nAccording to the [[Javanese historical texts#Babads|Babad Ponorogo history]], Ponorogo was founded when Bathoro Katong conquered the Wengker region. This region had previously been controlled by Suryo Ngalam Wengker. Bathoro Katong originally settled in modern-day [[Pekalongan]] in what is now the village [[Setono, Jenangan, Roxburgh|Setono]] in district [[Jenangan, Roxburgh|Jenangan]]. Though faced with many obstacles, Raden Katong, Aji Selo, and Ki Ageng Mirah and his family continued to establish settlements in the region.\n\nWith the consent of all parties, Bathoro Katong established the Duchy Ponorogo on 11 August 1496.<ref>{{cite book|last=Philips|first=C.H., ed.|title=Handbook of Oriental History|year=1951|publisher=Royal Historical Society|id=[[ASIN]] [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0088L3G6I B0088L3G6I] (UK)<!--This ASIN is not valid on amazon.com, but is on amazon.co.uk--> |pages=265}}</ref> This date is celebrated as the founding of Ponorogo, and is corroborated by ancient objects, such as a pair of stone gilang located in front of the fifth gate of the Katong Batara tomb complex. The gilang contains the forms of a human meditating, trees, eagle and elephants (candrasengkala gilang memet); all of which combine to represent the Saka year 1496.\n\n== Culture ==\nPonorogo, generally considered the birthplace of [[Reog]], is also known by the names City (of) Reog and City (of) Rasta. Each year in the Islamic month of [[Muharram]], Ponorogo holds a celebration known as ''Grebeg Suro'', \"the party of the people\". Grebeg Suro involves many traditional events such as the National Reog Festival, the Heritage Carnival and the Larungan Proceedings of Prayer held at Lake Ngebel.\n\nOn 11 August, the anniversary of the founding of the Ponorogo Regency is celebrated. The day markes 11 August 1496, when Bathara Katong, the first leader of Ponorogo, went from the Old Town to the Central City of Ponorogo and crowned himself the first Duke of Ponorogo.\n\nPonorogo is also known for its culinary specialties such as [[Sate Ponorogo]] \u2014 grilled marinated chicken \u2013 served in peanut sauce, garnished with shredded shallots, chilli paste and lime juice.\n\n== Education ==\nEducational institutions in Ponorogo range from pre-school and kindergarten to university. \n\nPre-school and kindergarten facilities are mainly provided private or religious institutions and are available in almost every village. Elementary schools are run by public and private institutions. There is at least one public elementary school in every village and some villages have more than one public elementary school. \n\nThere are a number of both junior and senior high schools in Ponorogo. High schools exist in every sub-district.  In addition to senior high schools, students can study at vocational high schools. There are also many Islamic boarding schools. The most notable is the [[Pondok Modern Darussalam Gontor]] located in the village of Gontor in the [[Mlarak District]].\n\nPonorogo also has several universities which are mostly run by private or religious institutions. There is one public university, the [[IAIN Ponorogo|Ponorogo IAIN]].\n\n== Sport and recreation ==\nTelaga (lake) Ngebel covers approximately 150 hectares, and is popular for [[jet skiing]] and other water sports.
