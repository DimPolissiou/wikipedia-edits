Its eastern end is in [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], near [[Newark, California|Newark]] in the [[San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge]], and its western end is in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]]. Bridging [[California State Route 84|State Route 84]] across the bay, it has three lanes each way and a separated bike/pedestrian lane along its south side. Like the [[San Mateo Bridge]] to the north, [[electric power transmission|power line]]s parallel the bridge.\n\n==History and engineering features==\n[[Image:DumbartonBr.jpg|thumb|right|The original vertical-lift span of the Dumbarton Bridge, shown in 1984 shortly before it was demolished]]The bridge has never been officially named, but its commonly used name comes from Dumbarton Point, named in 1876 after [[Dumbarton, Scotland]]. Built originally to provide a shortcut for traffic originating in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, the bridge served industrial and residential areas on both sides. The earlier bridge opened on January 17, 1927, and was the first vehicular bridge to cross San Francisco Bay. A portion of this old drawbridge remains as a fishing pier on the east side of the Bay. The original bridge was built with private capital and then purchased by the state for $2.5 million in 1951.\n\nIts age and the two-lane undivided roadway and lift-span led to a replacement bridge being built to the north. This bridge opened in October 1982 as a four-lane, high-level structure. The structure was re-striped to accommodate six lanes on October 18, 1989, in response to the temporary closing of the [[San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge]] due to the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]], and the permanent widening of the approaches was completed by July 2003.<ref>\"Dumbarton Bridge\" {{cite web|url=http://bata.mtc.ca.gov/bridges/dumbarton.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221185117/http://bata.mtc.ca.gov/bridges/dumbarton.htm |archivedate=2012-02-21 }}</ref> The cost of the complete replacement project was $200 million. The current bridge includes a two-way bicycle and separate pedestrian path on the south-facing side. A {{convert|340|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} center span provides {{convert|85|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} of vertical clearance for shipping. The approach spans on both sides of the Bay are of pre-stressed [[lightweight concrete]] [[girder]]s supporting a lightweight concrete deck. The center spans are twin steel trapezoidal girders which also support a lightweight concrete deck.\n\nThe center span of the original bridge was demolished in a controlled explosion in September 1984.\n[[Image:Dumbarton Bridge CA from the air.JPG|thumb|right|A view from the air, above Palo Alto, looking towards Fremont]]\n\n==Roadway connections==\nThe bridge is part of [[California State Route 84|State Route 84]], and is directly connected to [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]] by a [[freeway]] segment north of the Fremont end.\nThere is no freeway connection between [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. 101]] and the southwest end of the Dumbarton Bridge. Motorists must traverse one of three at-grade routes to connect from the Bayshore Freeway to the bridge. These are (from northwest to southeast):\n# the Bayfront Expressway, a [[limited-access road]] linking to U.S. 101 at Marsh Road, [[Atherton, California|Atherton]] (the official routing of SR 84)\n# Willow Road ([[California State Route 114|SR 114]]), an approximately one-mile expressway through east Menlo Park to U.S. 101\n# University Avenue ([[California State Route 109|SR 109]]), an [[arterial road]] and the main commercial street of [[East Palo Alto, California|East Palo Alto]].\n\nThe Willow Road and University Avenue junctions with Bayfront Expressway are at-grade intersections controlled by traffic lights; there are two additional controlled intersections at Chilco Road and Marsh Road, and the Marsh Road interchange on U.S. 101 is a [[Partial cloverleaf interchange|parclo]]. The result is that Bayfront Expressway is frequently congested, and when not congested is often the site of high-speed car crashes. In 2007, prominent author [[David Halberstam]] was killed in one such crash at the Willow Road intersection.\n\nAccess to [[Interstate 280 in California|I-280]] is available via State Route 84 to [[Woodside Road]] (as signed) or other arterial routes. There are no cross-Peninsula freeway connections between State Routes 92 and 85. In addition, there are no direct cross-Peninsula arterial routes between State Route 84 and Page Mill Road, a five-mile gap.\n\nAlthough the present situation has resulted in severe traffic problems on the bridge itself and in Menlo Park and East Palo Alto, Caltrans has been unable to upgrade the relevant portion of Highway 84 to freeway standards for several decades, due to opposition from the cities of Menlo Park, Atherton and [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]]. Freeway opponents fear that upgrading Highway 84 will encourage more people to live in southern [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] (where housing is more affordable) and commute to jobs in the mid-Peninsula area (where businesses wish to be located in order to be close to [[Silicon Valley]]), thus increasing traffic in their neighborhoods to the south and west of U.S. 101 and even along State Routes 85 and 237.\n\nBus service across the bridge is provided by the [[Dumbarton Express]], run by a consortium of local transit agencies ([[SamTrans]], [[AC Transit]], [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority|VTA]] and others) which connects to [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] at Union City and [[Caltrain]] at Palo Alto and California Avenue. AC Transit also runs Transbay buses U ([[Fremont (BART station)|Fremont BART]] and [[Fremont-Centerville (Amtrak station)|Amtrak]] to [[Stanford University|Stanford]]) and DA (Ardenwood to [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] and [[Facebook]] headquarters) across the bridge. The free [[Stanford Marguerite Shuttle]] also runs buses AE-F and EB across the bridge.\n\n==Environmental factors==\n\nWhen the current bridge was planned in the 1970s, [[Caltrans]] conducted extensive environmental research on the [[marine biology|aquatic]] and [[landform|terrestrial]] environment. Principal concerns of the public were [[air pollution]] and [[noise pollution]] impacts, particularly in some residential areas of Menlo Park and [[East Palo Alto]]. Studies were conducted to produce contour maps of projected [[Sound exposure level|sound level]]s and [[carbon monoxide]] concentrations throughout the western approaches, for each alternative connection scheme.<ref>C.M. Hogan, Leda Patmore, Harry Seidman et al., ''Air Quality and Acoustics Analysis for the Dumbarton Bridge Replacement Project'', ESL Inc., prepared for the Bay Area Division of Toll Crossings (1973)</ref>\n\nThe area around the bridge is an important ecological area, hosting many species of birds, fish and mammals. The [[endangered species]] [[California clapper rail]] is known to be present in the western bridge terminus area.\n\nNear the bridge on the Peninsula are Menlo Park's Bayfront Park, East Palo Alto's Ravenswood Open Space Preserve, and the [[Palo Alto Baylands Nature Preserve]]. An accessible portion of the [[San Francisco Bay National Wildlife]] Refuge lies immediately north of the western bridge terminus, where the Ravenswood trail runs.<ref>''San Francisco Bay Shoreline Guide'', by California State Coastal Conservancy, University of California Press (1995) {{ISBN|0-520-08878-6}}</ref>\n\nOn both sides of the east end of the bridge are large salt ponds and [[levee]] trails belonging to the [[Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge]]. The headquarters and visitor center for the refuge is on a hill south of the bridge approach. North of the east end of the bridge is [[Coyote Hills Regional Park]], with its network of trails running over tall hills. North of that is the [[Alameda Creek Regional Trail]] from the Bay to [[Niles Canyon]]. East of [[Coyote Hills (Alameda County)|Coyote Hills]] is [[Ardenwood Historic Farm]], a restored working farm that preserves and displays turn-of-the-century farming methods\n\n==Tolls==\nTolls are only collected from westbound traffic at the toll plaza on the east side of the bay. Drivers may either pay by cash or use the [[FasTrak]] electronic toll collection device. There are seven toll lanes at the plaza. During peak traffic hours, the leftmost lane is designated a FasTrak-only [[HOV lane]], allowing [[carpool]] vehicles carrying two or more people or motorcycles to pass for a toll of $2.50. The next two leftmost lanes are FasTrak-only lanes for all vehicles, and all other lanes accept both cash and FasTrak. During non-peak hours the HOV lane is open to vehicles carrying only one person, but remains FasTrak-only.\n\n===Historical toll rates===\nPrior to 1969, tolls on the Dumbarton Bridge were collected in both directions. When it opened, the original 1927 span had a toll of $0.40 per car plus $0.05 per passenger. In 1959, tolls were set to $0.35 per car. It was raised to $0.70 in 1969, then $0.75 in 1976. The toll per car remained at $0.75 when the replacement bridge opened in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist4/documents/tollfees.pdf | title=History of California's Bridge Tolls | publisher=[[California Department of Transportation|Caltrans]] | accessdate=June 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe basic toll (for automobiles) on the seven state-owned bridges, including the Dumbarton Bridge, was raised to $1 by Regional Measure 1, approved by Bay Area voters in 1988.<ref>[http://bata.mtc.ca.gov/projects/rm1.htm Regional Measure 1 Toll Bridge Program].

Bridging [[California State Route 84|State Route 84]] across the bay, it has three lanes each way and a separated bike/pedestrian lane along its south side. Like the [[San Mateo Bridge]] to the north, [[electric power transmission|power line]]s parallel the bridge.\n\n==History and engineering features==\n[[Image:DumbartonBr.jpg|thumb|right|The original vertical-lift span of the Dumbarton Bridge, shown in 1984 shortly before it was demolished]]The bridge has never been officially named, but its commonly used name comes from Dumbarton Point, named in 1876 after [[Dumbarton, Scotland]]. Built originally to provide a shortcut for traffic originating in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, the bridge served industrial and residential areas on both sides. The earlier bridge opened on January 17, 1927, and was the first vehicular bridge to cross San Francisco Bay. A portion of this old drawbridge remains as a fishing pier on the east side of the Bay. The original bridge was built with private capital and then purchased by the state for $2.5 million in 1951.\n\nIts age and the two-lane undivided roadway and lift-span led to a replacement bridge being built to the north. This bridge opened in October 1982 as a four-lane, high-level structure. The structure was re-striped to accommodate six lanes on October 18, 1989, in response to the temporary closing of the [[San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge]] due to the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]], and the permanent widening of the approaches was completed by July 2003.<ref>\"Dumbarton Bridge\" {{cite web|url=http://bata.mtc.ca.gov/bridges/dumbarton.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221185117/http://bata.mtc.ca.gov/bridges/dumbarton.htm |archivedate=2012-02-21 }}</ref> The cost of the complete replacement project was $200 million. The current bridge includes a two-way bicycle and separate pedestrian path on the south-facing side. A {{convert|340|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} center span provides {{convert|85|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} of vertical clearance for shipping. The approach spans on both sides of the Bay are of pre-stressed [[lightweight concrete]] [[girder]]s supporting a lightweight concrete deck. The center spans are twin steel trapezoidal girders which also support a lightweight concrete deck.\n\nThe center span of the original bridge was demolished in a controlled explosion in September 1984.\n[[Image:Dumbarton Bridge CA from the air.JPG|thumb|right|A view from the air, above Palo Alto, looking towards Fremont]]\n\n==Roadway connections==\nThe bridge is part of [[California State Route 84|State Route 84]], and is directly connected to [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]] by a [[freeway]] segment north of the Fremont end.\nThere is no freeway connection between [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. 101]] and the southwest end of the Dumbarton Bridge. Motorists must traverse one of three at-grade routes to connect from the Bayshore Freeway to the bridge. These are (from northwest to southeast):\n# the Bayfront Expressway, a [[limited-access road]] linking to U.S. 101 at Marsh Road, [[Atherton, California|Atherton]] (the official routing of SR 84)\n# Willow Road ([[California State Route 114|SR 114]]), an approximately one-mile expressway through east Menlo Park to U.S. 101\n# University Avenue ([[California State Route 109|SR 109]]), an [[arterial road]] and the main commercial street of [[East Palo Alto, California|East Palo Alto]].\n\nThe Willow Road and University Avenue junctions with Bayfront Expressway are at-grade intersections controlled by traffic lights; there are two additional controlled intersections at Chilco Road and Marsh Road, and the Marsh Road interchange on U.S. 101 is a [[Partial cloverleaf interchange|parclo]]. The result is that Bayfront Expressway is frequently congested, and when not congested is often the site of high-speed car crashes. In 2007, prominent author [[David Halberstam]] was killed in one such crash at the Willow Road intersection.\n\nAccess to [[Interstate 280 in California|I-280]] is available via State Route 84 to [[Woodside Road]] (as signed) or other arterial routes. There are no cross-Peninsula freeway connections between State Routes 92 and 85. In addition, there are no direct cross-Peninsula arterial routes between State Route 84 and Page Mill Road, a five-mile gap.\n\nAlthough the present situation has resulted in severe traffic problems on the bridge itself and in Menlo Park and East Palo Alto, Caltrans has been unable to upgrade the relevant portion of Highway 84 to freeway standards for several decades, due to opposition from the cities of Menlo Park, Atherton and [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]]. Freeway opponents fear that upgrading Highway 84 will encourage more people to live in southern [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] (where housing is more affordable) and commute to jobs in the mid-Peninsula area (where businesses wish to be located in order to be close to [[Silicon Valley]]), thus increasing traffic in their neighborhoods to the south and west of U.S. 101 and even along State Routes 85 and 237.\n\nBus service across the bridge is provided by the [[Dumbarton Express]], run by a consortium of local transit agencies ([[SamTrans]], [[AC Transit]], [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority|VTA]] and others) which connects to [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] at Union City and [[Caltrain]] at Palo Alto and California Avenue. AC Transit also runs Transbay buses U ([[Fremont (BART station)|Fremont BART]] and [[Fremont-Centerville (Amtrak station)|Amtrak]] to [[Stanford University|Stanford]]) and DA (Ardenwood to [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] and [[Facebook]] headquarters) across the bridge. The free [[Stanford Marguerite Shuttle]] also runs buses AE-F and EB across the bridge.\n\n==Environmental factors==\n\nWhen the current bridge was planned in the 1970s, [[Caltrans]] conducted extensive environmental research on the [[marine biology|aquatic]] and [[landform|terrestrial]] environment. Principal concerns of the public were [[air pollution]] and [[noise pollution]] impacts, particularly in some residential areas of Menlo Park and [[East Palo Alto]]. Studies were conducted to produce contour maps of projected [[Sound exposure level|sound level]]s and [[carbon monoxide]] concentrations throughout the western approaches, for each alternative connection scheme.<ref>C.M. Hogan, Leda Patmore, Harry Seidman et al., ''Air Quality and Acoustics Analysis for the Dumbarton Bridge Replacement Project'', ESL Inc., prepared for the Bay Area Division of Toll Crossings (1973)</ref>\n\nThe area around the bridge is an important ecological area, hosting many species of birds, fish and mammals. The [[endangered species]] [[California clapper rail]] is known to be present in the western bridge terminus area.\n\nNear the bridge on the Peninsula are Menlo Park's Bayfront Park, East Palo Alto's Ravenswood Open Space Preserve, and the [[Palo Alto Baylands Nature Preserve]]. An accessible portion of the [[San Francisco Bay National Wildlife]] Refuge lies immediately north of the western bridge terminus, where the Ravenswood trail runs.<ref>''San Francisco Bay Shoreline Guide'', by California State Coastal Conservancy, University of California Press (1995) {{ISBN|0-520-08878-6}}</ref>\n\nOn both sides of the east end of the bridge are large salt ponds and [[levee]] trails belonging to the [[Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge]]. The headquarters and visitor center for the refuge is on a hill south of the bridge approach. North of the east end of the bridge is [[Coyote Hills Regional Park]], with its network of trails running over tall hills. North of that is the [[Alameda Creek Regional Trail]] from the Bay to [[Niles Canyon]]. East of [[Coyote Hills (Alameda County)|Coyote Hills]] is [[Ardenwood Historic Farm]], a restored working farm that preserves and displays turn-of-the-century farming methods\n\n==Tolls==\nTolls are only collected from westbound traffic at the toll plaza on the east side of the bay. Drivers may either pay by cash or use the [[FasTrak]] electronic toll collection device. There are seven toll lanes at the plaza. During peak traffic hours, the leftmost lane is designated a FasTrak-only [[HOV lane]], allowing [[carpool]] vehicles carrying two or more people or motorcycles to pass for a toll of $2.50. The next two leftmost lanes are FasTrak-only lanes for all vehicles, and all other lanes accept both cash and FasTrak. During non-peak hours the HOV lane is open to vehicles carrying only one person, but remains FasTrak-only.\n\n===Historical toll rates===\nPrior to 1969, tolls on the Dumbarton Bridge were collected in both directions. When it opened, the original 1927 span had a toll of $0.40 per car plus $0.05 per passenger. In 1959, tolls were set to $0.35 per car. It was raised to $0.70 in 1969, then $0.75 in 1976. The toll per car remained at $0.75 when the replacement bridge opened in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist4/documents/tollfees.pdf | title=History of California's Bridge Tolls | publisher=[[California Department of Transportation|Caltrans]] | accessdate=June 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe basic toll (for automobiles) on the seven state-owned bridges, including the Dumbarton Bridge, was raised to $1 by Regional Measure 1, approved by Bay Area voters in 1988.<ref>[http://bata.mtc.ca.gov/projects/rm1.htm Regional Measure 1 Toll Bridge Program].

It was unified with [[Morocco]] in 1958 after the [[Ifni War]], which started one year after the independence of other regions of Morocco<ref>http://www.sahara-online.net/Western-Sahara/Decolonisation-713.aspx</ref>.\n\nTarfaya is the capital and main town in the [[Tarfaya Province]], and counts a population of 8,027 inhabitants according to the 2014 census<ref>https://www.hcp.ma/downloads/RGPH-2014_t17441.html</ref>. Although founded in the twentieth century, the city has a big historical symbolic in the Moroccan history, dating back to the era of the [[Green March]] in November 1975<ref>https://www.historychannel.com.au/articles/moroccan-green-march-converges-in-tarfaya/</ref>.\n\nThe region of Tarfaya has been linked with relations with foreign powers, following several incursions conducted at its coasts (Spanish, Portuguese, British and French). This blending gave the city a special cultural dimension in its history. The famous French writer and aviator [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]] (1900-1944) lived two years (1927-1928) in Tarfaya before writing his masterpiece [[The Little Prince]] that was later translated to more than 300 languages and dialects<ref>https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/the-little-prince-becomes-world-s-most-translated-book-excluding-religious-works-1.3358885</ref><ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/03/arts/television/cover-story-a-prince-eternal.html?pagewanted=all</ref>.

Tarfaya is also the closest city to the [[Khenifiss National Park]], added to the [[UNESCO World Heritage]] Tentative list<ref>https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1182/</ref>, an ecological site home to hundreds of different kinds of migratory birds each year. It is estimated that more than 20,000 birds from 211 different species breed, nest and feed regularly in the park<ref>http://www.eauxetforets.gov.ma/fr/text.aspx?id=1076&uid=87</ref>.\n\n== History ==\nTarfaya was occupied by the British in 1882, when they built a trading post called Casa del Mar.<ref>{{in lang|fr}}, acquiring their trading office.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n [http://ecole.zzl.org/index.php/mon-pays/38-tarfaya/59-petite-histoire-de-tarfaya.html Petite histoire de Tarfaya] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402133851/http://ecole.zzl.org/index.php/mon-pays/38-tarfaya/59-petite-histoire-de-tarfaya.html |date=2012-04-02 }}</ref> The building is currently in a state of complete disrepair.

The airmail carrier, based in [[Toulouse, France]], was founded by French industrialist [[Pierre-Georges Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re]], who envisioned an air route connecting France to its French colonies in Africa. Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re firmly believed in the future of aviation as a means of commercial transportation and communication between people.\n\nThe nearby Cape Juby airfield was an important refueling and stopover station for A\u00e9ropostale. Author-aviator [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]] was named its station manager in 1927. There he remained for 18 months, on occasion negotiating with the rebellious [[Moors|Moorish tribes]] to release his imprisoned pilots, as he wrote in his first novel, ''Southern Mail''.\n\nOn 28 September 2004 a [[Antoine_de_Saint-Exupery_Museum|museum]] opened in honour of the memory of A\u00e9ropostale, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and its pilots, supported notably by the city of Toulouse and European aircraft maker [[Airbus]]. The museum was inaugurated by renowned aviation journalist Bernard Chabbert, whose father was also part of A\u00e9ropostale's history.\n[[File:Antoine de Saint Exup\u00e9ry Museum Interior View

This blending gave the city a special cultural dimension in its history. The famous French writer and aviator [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]] (1900-1944) lived two years (1927-1928) in Tarfaya before writing his masterpiece [[The Little Prince]] that was later translated to more than 300 languages and dialects<ref>https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/the-little-prince-becomes-world-s-most-translated-book-excluding-religious-works-1.3358885</ref><ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/03/arts/television/cover-story-a-prince-eternal.html?pagewanted=all</ref>.

The airmail carrier, based in [[Toulouse, France]], was founded by French industrialist [[Pierre-Georges Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re]], who envisioned an air route connecting France to its French colonies in Africa. Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re firmly believed in the future of aviation as a means of commercial transportation and communication between people.\n\nThe nearby Cape Juby airfield was an important refueling and stopover station for A\u00e9ropostale. Author-aviator [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]] was named its station manager in 1927. There he remained for 18 months, on occasion negotiating with the rebellious [[Moors|Moorish tribes]] to release his imprisoned pilots, as he wrote in his first novel, ''Southern Mail''.\n\nOn 28 September 2004 a museum opened in honour of the memory of A\u00e9ropostale, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and its pilots, supported notably by the city of Toulouse and European aircraft maker [[Airbus]]. The museum was inaugurated by renowned aviation journalist Bernard Chabbert, whose father was also part of A\u00e9ropostale's history.\n[[File:Antoine de Saint Exup\u00e9ry Museum Interior View Panorama Aug 2017.jpg|center|thumb|980x980px|'''Saint Exup\u00e9ry Museum in Tarfaya opened in honour of the memory of A\u00e9ropostale''']]\n\n== Air services ==\n\nThe town maintains the [[Tarfaya Airport]] with the [[IATA]] code TFY.[[File:Tarfaya Saint-Exupery.jpg|thumb|right|Monument dedicated to [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry|Antoine de Saint Exup\u00e9ry]], the author and the airport manager of [[A\u00e9ropostale (aviation)|L'A\u00e9ropostale]] at Cap Juby, just by Tarfaya]]\n== Climate ==\nTarfaya has a [[desert climate]] (BWh/BWk).\n{{Weather box\n|location = Tarfaya\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 19\n|Feb high C = 19\n|Mar high C = 20\n|Apr high C = 21\n|May high C = 21\n|Jun high C = 22\n|Jul high C = 22\n|Aug high C = 23\n|Sep high C = 23\n|Oct high C = 23\n|Nov high C = 22\n|Dec high C = 20\n|year high C = 21\n|Jan mean C = 16\n|Feb mean C = 16\n|Mar mean C = 17\n|Apr mean C = 18\n|May mean C = 18\n|Jun mean C = 19\n|Jul mean C = 20\n|Aug mean C = 20\n|Sep mean C = 20\n|Oct mean C = 20\n|Nov mean C = 19\n|Dec mean C = 16\n|year mean C = 18\n|Jan low C = 13\n|Feb low C = 13\n|Mar low C = 14\n|Apr low C = 15\n|May low C = 16\n|Jun low C = 17\n|Jul low C = 18\n|Aug low C = 18\n|Sep low C = 18\n|Oct low C = 17\n|Nov low C = 16\n|Dec low C = 13\n|year low C = 16\n|Jan precipitation cm = 0\n|Feb precipitation cm = 0\n|Mar precipitation cm = 0\n|Apr precipitation cm = 0\n|May precipitation cm = 0\n|Jun precipitation cm = 0\n|Jul precipitation cm = 0\n|Aug precipitation cm = 0\n|Sep precipitation cm = 0\n|Oct precipitation cm = 0\n|Nov precipitation cm = 1\n|Dec precipitation cm = 0\n|year precipitation cm = 1\n|source 1 = Weatherbase<ref name=\"Weatherbase\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weatherall.php3?s=196006&refer=&units=metric\n  |title=Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Tarfaya\n  |accessdate=}}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{commons category}}\n\n;Citations\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n\n* Didier Daurat, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JAIYHQAACAAJ ''Saint-Exup\u00e9ry tel que je l'ai connu''], France: \u00c9dition Dynamo, 1954.\n\n{{Coord|27|56|22|N|12|55|34|W|region:MA_type:city|display=title}}\n{{Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in La\u00e2youne-Sakia El Hamra]]\n[[Category:1882 establishments in the British Empire]]\n[[Category:Provincial capitals in Morocco|Tarfaya]]\n[[Category:Tarfaya]]\n", "name_user": "Rossh1", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eA\u00e9ropostale:Added wikilink to Antoine de Saint-Exupery Museum page", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarfaya"}

The center of Trets was surrounded the [[Defensive wall|ramparts]] and its 8 towers (4 left), for defense against successive invasions over the centuries. A 2200 sqm garden along the town walls (''Jardins des Remparts'') was opened in 2011.\n\nSeveral gates (''porte'') were opened in the city walls. The rectangular Gate of Pourri\u00e8res and its preserved machicolations were built in the 14th century. It served as the main gateway access into town. On the East side of city, the Gate Saint-Jean also known as the Gate of Amont (14th) provides uptown access and was used to store munitions. On the North end stood the Gate of Clastre (14th), the Porte Neuve and the Gate of Puyloubier, all destroyed by the mid-19th century.<ref>{{cite web|work=Site Officiel de Trets-en-Provence, Based on Regards sur Trets en Provence by Guy Van Oost et al.|title=A voir sur Trets et les alentours|url=https://www.trets.fr/tourisme/voir-trets-les-alentours|accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nNow the grounds of the Edmond Brun elementary school, a hospital named H\u00f4pital Saint Jacques was established circa 1300 near the church of the same patronage and later transferred, in 1794, to the Observantins convent.\n\nThe low, vaulted passageway called Le Trou de Madame Lion gave access to the [[Chemin de ronde|wall-walk]]. It is thought to have been either a way of confining any epidemic outbreak to the grounds of the hospital or a way of defending against mounted attacks.\n\nTo the southeast is the feudal castle (''Ch\u00e2teau des Remparts'') with its staircase in dimension stone with a ramp from the 17th century, French-style painted ceilings and a baroque chimney.

A 2200 sqm garden along the town walls (''Jardins des Remparts'') was opened in 2011.\n\nSeveral gates (''porte'') were opened in the city walls. The rectangular Gate of Pourri\u00e8res and its preserved machicolations were built in the 14th century. It served as the main gateway access into town. On the East side of city, the Gate Saint-Jean also known as the Gate of Amont (14th) provides uptown access and was used to store munitions.

They form the part of [[Interstate 80 in California|Interstate 80]] between [[Crockett, California|Crockett]] and [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]], [[California]]. The name Carquinez Bridge originally referred to a single [[cantilever bridge]] built in 1927, which was part of the direct route between [[San Francisco]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. A second parallel cantilever bridge was completed in 1958 to deal with the increased traffic. Later, seismic problems made the 1927 span unsafe in case of an earthquake, and led to the construction, and 2003 opening, of a replacement: a [[suspension bridge]] officially named the '''Alfred Zampa Memorial Bridge''', in memory of iron worker [[Al Zampa]], who played an integral role in the construction of numerous [[San Francisco Bay Area]] bridges. The Alfred Zampa Memorial Bridge carries westbound traffic from Vallejo to Crockett, and the 1958 cantilever span carries eastbound traffic.\n\n==History and description==\nThe first regular crossing of the Carquinez Strait began in the mid-1800s as a ferry operated between the cities of Benicia and Martinez, six miles upstream from the bridge site. Auto service started on this route in 1913. A [[train]] ferry operated between Benicia and Porta Costa from 1879 until 1930 when a rail bridge opened.

Steinman|Robinson & Steinman]] and dedicated on May 21, 1927. Prior to this, crossing the [[Carquinez Strait]] necessitated the use of [[Six Minute ferries|ferries]]. The bridge cost $8 million to build. It was the first major crossing of the [[San Francisco Bay]]<ref>''The Barrier Broken'' \u2013 Vallejo Evening Chronicle, May 21, 1927</ref> and a significant technological achievement in its time.\n\nUpon its completion, the span became part of the [[Lincoln Highway]]. This historic transcontinental roadway's original alignment, like the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]] that preceded it nearly sixty years earlier, chose to avoid crossing the Carquinez Strait entirely. The preferred option, given the engineering limitations of the day, was to skirt around the [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta|Delta]] by going south from [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] through [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], then proceeding west across the [[San Joaquin River]] and over the [[Altamont Pass]], and finally reaching [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] from the south; a route that would later become [[U.S. Route 50 in California|U.S. Route 50]] and ultimately Interstates [[Interstate 5 (California)|5]], [[Interstate 205 (California)|205]], and [[Interstate 580 (California)|580]]. This circuitous route, several miles longer, and traversing a rather formidable mountain pass, was preferable to crossing the Carquinez Strait, a deep channel with strong currents and frequent high winds. For decades, building a bridge across the Carquinez Strait was considered prohibitively expensive and technologically risky. Once the bridge was built however, driving from Sacramento to the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] became much more direct. The Carquinez Bridge provided a welcome alternative route from the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] to the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]], one that no longer required loading one's vehicle onto and off of a ferry. With the bridge completed, the Lincoln Highway was realigned to cross the [[Sacramento River]], then proceed southwest through [[Davis, California|Davis]] and [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]], across the Carquinez Bridge, and along the shores of the [[San Pablo Bay|San Pablo]] and [[San Francisco Bay|San Francisco]] bays to [[Richmond, California|Richmond]] and Oakland; becoming [[U.S. Route 40 in California|U.S. Route 40]], and ultimately [[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]].\n\nAfter the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] engineers determined that the aging 1927 span was seismically unstable, and that a retrofit was impossible. The decision was made to replace it with a new suspension bridge. The 1927 span was  temporarily used to hold eastbound traffic while the 1958 eastbound span underwent a seismic retrofit, deck and superstructure rehabilitation, and painting to extend its serviceable life.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/04/25/MNG1IIENCQ1.DTL ''\"Old Carquinez Bridge is disappearing\"''] \u2013 San Francisco Chronicle, April 25, 2006.</ref>  The old 1923 cantelever bridge was dismantled three years after the opening of its replacement; with completion on September 4, 2007.

The bridge was dedicated on November 8, 2003 and opened for traffic on November 11, 2003. Originally, the plan was to dedicate the bridge on November 15, but complications involving then just-recalled Governor [[Gray Davis]] and the transfer power to [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] resulted in the date being moved.

It features a pedestrian and bicycle path, part of a bike trail which it is hoped will eventually [[San Francisco Bay Trail|circle the entire Bay Area]]. The towers are each founded on two footings, which are each supported by six vertical, {{convert|3|m|ft|adj=mid|-diameter}} steel shells infilled with reinforced concrete, followed by {{convert|2.7|m|ft|adj=mid|-diameter}} drilled shafts in rock, i.e., cast-in-drilled hole, or CIDH, piles. The total length of the CIDH pile at the South Tower is approximately 89 m, with about 43 m of drilled shaft in rock. The total length of the CIDH pile at the North Tower ranges from 49 to 64 m, with about 16 to 26 m of drilled shaft in rock. The design parameters used for the South Tower piles were later confirmed by a pile load test. Additional field investigations during construction revealed significant variations in rock conditions at the North Tower, resulting in the redesign of the length of the piles. Major construction challenges encountered during construction of the South Tower piles, and the revised construction procedure, i.e., under-reaming, used by the constructor to mitigate caving.\n\nMaterials for the New Bridge came from all over the world:\n\n* Steel Caissons for CIDH: XKT Engineering \u2013 Vallejo, California\n* Orthotropic Deck Sections: IHI \u2013 Japan\n* Tower and Splay Saddles: \n** Castings: Sheffield Steel \u2013 England\n** Finishing and Machining: Kvaerner \u2013 England\n* Main Cable Wire: [[Bridon Ropes|Bridon]] \u2013 England\n* Wire for Cable Wrapping: Canada\n* Cable Bands: France\n* Suspenders (Hardware, Casting, Fabrication): WRCA \u2013 St. Joseph, Missouri\n* (3) Maintenance Travelers Under Deck Sections: Jesse Engineering \u2013 Tacoma, Washington\n\n==Tolls==\nTolls are collected only from automotive traffic headed eastbound, towards Vallejo at the toll plaza on the north side of the bridge, which is unique in that the toll is collected after crossing the bridge.

They form the part of [[Interstate 80 in California|Interstate 80]] between [[Crockett, California|Crockett]] and [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]], [[California]]. The name Carquinez Bridge originally referred to a single [[cantilever bridge]] built in 1927, which was part of the direct route between [[San Francisco]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. A second parallel cantilever bridge was completed in 1958 to deal with the increased traffic. Later, seismic problems made the 1927 span unsafe in case of an earthquake, and led to the construction, and 2003 opening, of a replacement: a [[suspension bridge]] officially named the '''Alfred Zampa Memorial Bridge''', in memory of iron worker [[Al Zampa]], who played an integral role in the construction of numerous [[San Francisco Bay Area]] bridges. The Alfred Zampa Memorial Bridge carries westbound traffic from Vallejo to Crockett, and the 1958 cantilever span carries eastbound traffic.\n\n==History and description==\nThe first regular crossing of the Carquinez Strait began in the mid-1800s as a ferry operated between the cities of Benicia and Martinez, six miles upstream from the bridge site. Auto service started on this route in 1913. A [[train]] ferry operated between Benicia and Porta Costa from 1879 until 1930 when a rail bridge opened. Ferry service at the site of the bridge started in 1913 by the Rodeo-Vallejo Ferry Company.<ref>Hope, Andrew (2000).

With the bridge completed, the Lincoln Highway was realigned to cross the [[Sacramento River]], then proceed southwest through [[Davis, California|Davis]] and [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]], across the Carquinez Bridge, and along the shores of the [[San Pablo Bay|San Pablo]] and [[San Francisco Bay|San Francisco]] bays to [[Richmond, California|Richmond]] and Oakland; becoming [[U.S. Route 40 in California|U.S. Route 40]], and ultimately [[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]].\n\nAfter the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] engineers determined that the aging 1927 span was seismically unstable, and that a retrofit was impossible. The decision was made to replace it with a new suspension bridge. The 1927 span was  temporarily used to hold eastbound traffic while the 1958 eastbound span underwent a seismic retrofit, deck and superstructure rehabilitation, and painting to extend its serviceable life.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/04/25/MNG1IIENCQ1.DTL ''\"Old Carquinez Bridge is disappearing\"''] \u2013 San Francisco Chronicle, April 25, 2006.</ref>  The old 1923 cantelever bridge was dismantled three years after the opening of its replacement; with completion on September 4, 2007.

It features a pedestrian and bicycle path, part of a bike trail which it is hoped will eventually [[San Francisco Bay Trail|circle the entire Bay Area]]. The towers are each founded on two footings, which are each supported by six vertical, {{convert|3|m|ft|adj=mid|-diameter}} steel shells infilled with reinforced concrete, followed by {{convert|2.7|m|ft|adj=mid|-diameter}} drilled shafts in rock, i.e., cast-in-drilled hole, or CIDH, piles. The total length of the CIDH pile at the South Tower is approximately 89 m, with about 43 m of drilled shaft in rock. The total length of the CIDH pile at the North Tower ranges from 49 to 64 m, with about 16 to 26 m of drilled shaft in rock. The design parameters used for the South Tower piles were later confirmed by a pile load test. Additional field investigations during construction revealed significant variations in rock conditions at the North Tower, resulting in the redesign of the length of the piles. Major construction challenges encountered during construction of the South Tower piles, and the revised construction procedure, i.e., under-reaming, used by the constructor to mitigate caving.\n\nMaterials for the New Bridge came from all over the world:\n\n* Steel Caissons for CIDH: XKT Engineering \u2013 Vallejo, California\n* Orthotropic Deck Sections: IHI \u2013 Japan\n* Tower and Splay Saddles: \n** Castings: Sheffield Steel \u2013 England\n** Finishing and Machining: Kvaerner \u2013 England\n* Main Cable Wire: [[Bridon Ropes|Bridon]] \u2013 England\n* Wire for Cable Wrapping: Canada\n* Cable Bands: France\n* Suspenders (Hardware, Casting, Fabrication): WRCA \u2013 St. Joseph, Missouri\n* (3) Maintenance Travelers Under Deck Sections: Jesse Engineering \u2013 Tacoma, Washington\n\n==Tolls==\nTolls are collected only from automotive traffic headed eastbound, towards Vallejo at the toll plaza on the north side of the bridge, which is unique in that the toll is collected after crossing the bridge.

It is known for its turquoise-blue water, the dramatic mountains (including [[Mount Morrison (California)|Mount Morrison]]) that surround it, the trout fishing it affords, and its unusual history. The lake, known to the Paiute as ''Wit-sa-nap'', was renamed by settlers after an incident on September 23, 1871, wherein a group of convicts escaped from prison in [[Carson City, Nevada]], and took refuge near the lake. They were pursued by a posse and after it caught up to the convicts a shootout followed, wherein a number of both posse members and convicts were killed or wounded. The remaining convicts who survived initially escaped but were eventually captured and lynched.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Sevehah Cliff.jpg|thumb|Sevehah Cliff, composed of folded [[metamorphic rock]], provides a colorful backdrop to Convict Lake.]]\nConvict Lake was originally carved out by glaciers. The lake's surface is approximately {{convert|7850|ft|m}} above sea level, with its greatest depths approximately {{convert|140|ft|m}} deep in various places; it is among the deepest lakes in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The lake is oblong in shape and is surrounded by a [[Canyon#Box canyon|box canyon]] set in the mountains. [[Mount Morrison (California)|Mount Morrison]], the tallest mountain in the area at {{convert|12,241|ft|m}}, lies to the south-east of the lake.<ref name=mono>[[#tourism|Mono County Economic Development, Tourism and Film Commission, 2019]]</ref><ref name=gazett/><ref name=n'geo>[[#basin|National Geographic, Convict Creek Basin]]</ref>\n\nThe lake and canyon area is dominated by light colored [[granite]]. The [[sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic]] rocks in this area once overlaid the entire Sierra Nevada range but have now been eroded away, revealing the underlying granite that uplifted the range. During the formation of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, [[magma]] rose from great depths and obliterated much of the sedimentary rock with which it came in contact. Just below the surface, the magma cooled and formed the granite typical of the range. In the process extreme heat and pressure deformed the immediate overlying sedimentary rocks into numerous and striking shapes.<ref name=n'geo/>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Mono people|Paiute Indians]] of the region are said to have called Convict Lake ''Wit-sa-nap'':<ref>[[#visit|McKenna, 2019]], How Convict Lake Got its Name</ref> <blockquote>\"The streams which flowed from the mountains were supposed to be filled with ''Pot-sa-wa-gees'', water babies, who lived in spirit, but were visible to the eye, having the face of an Indian child and the body of a fish.\" \u2014 According to Indian legend, Hi-na-nu was a wise and noble man, whose spirit was reverenced by the Indians and to whom they looked for guidance in earthly matters.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://convictlake.com/our-resort/about/|title=About|website=Convict Lake Resort|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nConvict Lake, then known as Monte Diablo,<ref name=mono/> came to assume its present name in an unusual manner. On September 17, 1871, 29 prisoners, including murderers, horse thieves, train robbers, and other such convicts, escaped from the [[Nevada State Prison]] in Carson City, killing one guard and wounding several others.<ref name=\"gazett\">{{Cite web|url=http://desertgazette.com/blog/the-story-of-convict-lake/|title=The Story of Convict Lake {{!}} Desert Gazette|last=Feller|first=Walter|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref> The prisoners split into two groups, one of which was led by convicted murderer Charlie Jones. Jones previously had lived in Mono and Inyo counties and led his group south toward the [[Mammoth Lakes, California|Mammoth Lakes]] area. Needing food and supplies, the escaped convicts robbed several people as they went along their way. Crossing the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range, Jones had hoped to reach the range's western slope, where they would be safe from pursuit. Jones correctly assumed that a Carson City [[Posse Comitatus (Common Law)|posse]] was on their trail, but the posse, from [[Benton, California]], led by [[Deputy Sheriff]] George Hightower, had given up within a couple of days and turned back. Meanwhile, on horseback, Billy Poor, a mail rider who was delivering mail for his first time, had accidentally encountered the group camped out near Convict Creek, a few miles south from the lake.<ref name=n'geo/> The convicts naturally assumed that the rider, if permitted to continue on, would reveal their location. Subsequently, Jones captured the man and, with the help of Leandor Morton, killed him,<ref name=tribune>[[#colorful|Tahoe Tribune, October 22, 2008]]</ref><ref>[[#inyo|Chalfant, 1922]], p. 215</ref><ref>[[#lakename|Convict Lake.com]]</ref> after which they took his horse and clothing and dressed his body in discarded prison cloths.<ref name=gazett/>\n\n[[File:Convictlake.jpg|thumb|Convict Lake lies in front of [[Mount Morrison (California)|Mount Morrison]].]]\nOutraged that, Poor, a Mono County resident, was murdered, the local community formed their own posse and pursued the convicts. By September 22, 1871, Sheriff George Hightower and Indian deputy Mono Jim led a new posse of 10 men and caught up to the convicts near Monte Diablo Creek. Early on the morning of September 23, Jones headed out for [[Bishop, California|Bishop]]. Wanting to break off from their group, Jones and another man told the others that they were going to look for food. The four remaining convicts were soon approached by the new posse, and a shootout occurred, leaving [[Wells Fargo Bank|Wells Fargo]] agent Morrison and Mono gunned down. The remaining convicts escaped to be captured later in Round Valley. By November 1, 18 of the 29 original prisoners had been captured. Jones and his partner had avoided the shootout but eventually were captured and executed.<ref>[[#down|U.S. Officer Down Memorial Page, Robert Morrison]]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/sports/convict-lake-has-a-colorful-history/|title=Convict Lake has a colorful history|last=Evans|first=Jeremy|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref><ref>[[#resort|Convict Lake Resort, 2019]]</ref> The remaining convicts were either killed in the shootout, or captured and lynched on the trip back to the prison.<ref name=n'geo/> Mount Morrison, the highest peak in the area, was named after the slain Robert Morrison, with its nearby smaller peak named after Mono Jim.<ref name=tribune/>\n\n===1990 drownings===\n[[File:Convict Lake & Mt Morrison, 2019b.jpg|thumb|Convict Lake in late June, with its characteristic turquoise-blue color.

It is known for its turquoise-blue water, the dramatic mountains (including [[Mount Morrison (California)|Mount Morrison]]) that surround it, the trout fishing it affords, and its unusual history. The lake, known to the Paiute as ''Wit-sa-nap'', was renamed by settlers after an incident on September 23, 1871, wherein a group of convicts escaped from prison in [[Carson City, Nevada]], and took refuge near the lake. They were pursued by a posse and after it caught up to the convicts a shootout followed, wherein a number of both posse members and convicts were killed or wounded. The remaining convicts who survived initially escaped but were eventually captured and lynched.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Sevehah Cliff.jpg|thumb|Sevehah Cliff, composed of folded [[metamorphic rock]], provides a colorful backdrop to Convict Lake.]]\nConvict Lake was originally carved out by glaciers. The lake's surface is approximately {{convert|7850|ft|m}} above sea level, with its greatest depths approximately {{convert|140|ft|m}} deep in various places; it is among the deepest lakes in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The lake is oblong in shape and is surrounded by a [[Canyon#Box canyon|box canyon]] set in the mountains. [[Mount Morrison (California)|Mount Morrison]], the tallest mountain in the area at {{convert|12,241|ft|m}}, lies to the south-east of the lake.<ref name=mono>[[#tourism|Mono County Economic Development, Tourism and Film Commission, 2019]]</ref><ref name=gazett/><ref name=n'geo>[[#basin|National Geographic, Convict Creek Basin]]</ref>\n\nThe lake and canyon area is dominated by light colored [[granite]]. The [[sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic]] rocks in this area once overlaid the entire Sierra Nevada range but have now been eroded away, revealing the underlying granite that uplifted the range. During the formation of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, [[magma]] rose from great depths and obliterated much of the sedimentary rock with which it came in contact. Just below the surface, the magma cooled and formed the granite typical of the range. In the process extreme heat and pressure deformed the immediate overlying sedimentary rocks into numerous and striking shapes.<ref name=n'geo/>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Mono people|Paiute Indians]] of the region are said to have called Convict Lake ''Wit-sa-nap'':<ref>[[#visit|McKenna, 2019]], How Convict Lake Got its Name</ref> <blockquote>\"The streams which flowed from the mountains were supposed to be filled with ''Pot-sa-wa-gees'', water babies, who lived in spirit, but were visible to the eye, having the face of an Indian child and the body of a fish.\" \u2014 According to Indian legend, Hi-na-nu was a wise and noble man, whose spirit was reverenced by the Indians and to whom they looked for guidance in earthly matters.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://convictlake.com/our-resort/about/|title=About|website=Convict Lake Resort|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nConvict Lake, then known as Monte Diablo,<ref name=mono/> came to assume its present name in an unusual manner. On September 17, 1871, 29 prisoners, including murderers, horse thieves, train robbers, and other such convicts, escaped from the [[Nevada State Prison]] in Carson City, killing one guard and wounding several others.<ref name=\"gazett\">{{Cite web|url=http://desertgazette.com/blog/the-story-of-convict-lake/|title=The Story of Convict Lake {{!}} Desert Gazette|last=Feller|first=Walter|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref> The prisoners split into two groups, one of which was led by convicted murderer Charlie Jones. Jones previously had lived in Mono and Inyo counties and led his group south toward the [[Mammoth Lakes, California|Mammoth Lakes]] area. Needing food and supplies, the escaped convicts robbed several people as they went along their way. Crossing the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range, Jones had hoped to reach the range's western slope, where they would be safe from pursuit. Jones correctly assumed that a Carson City [[Posse Comitatus (Common Law)|posse]] was on their trail, but the posse, from [[Benton, California]], led by [[Deputy Sheriff]] George Hightower, had given up within a couple of days and turned back. Meanwhile, on horseback, Billy Poor, a mail rider who was delivering mail for his first time, had accidentally encountered the group camped out near Convict Creek, a few miles south from the lake.<ref name=n'geo/> The convicts naturally assumed that the rider, if permitted to continue on, would reveal their location. Subsequently, Jones captured the man and, with the help of Leandor Morton, killed him,<ref name=tribune>[[#colorful|Tahoe Tribune, October 22, 2008]]</ref><ref>[[#inyo|Chalfant, 1922]], p. 215</ref><ref>[[#lakename|Convict Lake.com]]</ref> after which they took his horse and clothing and dressed his body in discarded prison cloths.<ref name=gazett/>\n\n[[File:Convictlake.jpg|thumb|Convict Lake lies in front of [[Mount Morrison (California)|Mount Morrison]].]]\nOutraged that, Poor, a Mono County resident, was murdered, the local community formed their own posse and pursued the convicts. By September 22, 1871, Sheriff George Hightower and Indian deputy Mono Jim led a new posse of 10 men and caught up to the convicts near Monte Diablo Creek. Early on the morning of September 23, Jones headed out for [[Bishop, California|Bishop]]. Wanting to break off from their group, Jones and another man told the others that they were going to look for food. The four remaining convicts were soon approached by the new posse, and a shootout occurred, leaving [[Wells Fargo Bank|Wells Fargo]] agent Morrison and Mono gunned down. The remaining convicts escaped to be captured later in Round Valley. By November 1, 18 of the 29 original prisoners had been captured. Jones and his partner had avoided the shootout but eventually were captured and executed.<ref>[[#down|U.S. Officer Down Memorial Page, Robert Morrison]]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/sports/convict-lake-has-a-colorful-history/|title=Convict Lake has a colorful history|last=Evans|first=Jeremy|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref><ref>[[#resort|Convict Lake Resort, 2019]]</ref> The remaining convicts were either killed in the shootout, or captured and lynched on the trip back to the prison.<ref name=n'geo/> Mount Morrison, the highest peak in the area, was named after the slain Robert Morrison, with its nearby smaller peak named after Mono Jim.<ref name=tribune/>\n\n===1990 drownings===\n[[File:Convict Lake & Mt Morrison, 2019b.jpg|thumb|Convict Lake in late June, with its characteristic turquoise-blue color.

{"title_page": "Toxic asset", "text_new": "A '''toxic asset''' is a [[financial asset]] that has fallen in value significantly and for which there is no longer a functioning market. Such assets cannot be sold at a price satisfactory to the holder.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toxic Assets|url=http://www.investinganswers.com/financial-dictionary/stock-market/toxic-assets-2268|website=Investing Answers|publisher=investinganswers.com|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref> Because assets are offset against liabilities and frequently leveraged, this decline in price may be quite dangerous to the holder. The term became common during the [[financial crisis of 2007-2008]], in which they played a major role.\n\nWhen the market for toxic assets ceases to function, it is described as \"frozen\". Markets for some toxic assets froze in 2007, and the problem grew much worse in the second half of 2008. Several factors contributed to the freezing of toxic asset markets. The value of the assets were very sensitive to economic conditions, and increased uncertainty in these conditions made it difficult to estimate the value of the assets. Banks and other major financial institutions were unwilling to sell the assets at significantly reduced prices, since lower prices would force them to reduce significantly their stated assets, making them, at least on paper, insolvent.\n\nToxic assets are also euphemistically labeled '''troubled assets'''.\n\n==Origin==\nThe term was in limited use at least as early as 2006, and may have been coined by or popularized by [[Angelo Mozilo]], founder of [[Countrywide Financial]], who used the term \"toxic\" to describe certain mortgage products in emails in spring of 2006, as revealed in SEC filings:<ref>{{Cite journal\n|title=Mozilo knew hazardous waste when he saw it\n|date=2009-06-04\n|journal=[[Los Angeles Times]]\n|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2009/06/the-use-of-toxic-to-describe-high-risk-mortgages-has-been-de-rigueur-for-the-last-two-years-now-it-looks-like-countrywide.html\n}}</ref>\n:\"[The 100% [[loan-to-value]] subprime loan is] the most dangerous product in existence and there can be nothing more toxic...\" (March 28, 2006)\nRegarding Countrywide's subprime 80/20 loans:\n:\"In all my years in the business I have never seen a more toxic prduct [sic]. It's not only subordinated to the first, but the first is subprime. In addition, the [[FICO score#FICO score|FICO]]s are below 600, below 500 and some below 400[.] With real estate values coming down ... the product will become increasingly worse.\" (April 17, 2006)\n\n==Market freeze==\nWhen the [[supply and demand]] of a good equal each other, so buyers and sellers are matched, one says that the \"[[Market clearing|market clears]]\".\n\n[[Classical economics]] and [[neoclassical economics]] posit that market clearing happens by the price adjusting\u2014upwards if demand exceeds supply and downwards if supply exceeds demand. Therefore, it reaches [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] at a price that both buyers and sellers will accept, and, in the absence of outside interference (in a free market), this will happen.\n\nThis has not happened for many types of financial assets during the financial crisis that began in 2007, hence one speaks of \"the market breaking down\".\n\nOne can explain this alternately as the price not adjusting down\u2014the price is too high, with supply being too high, or alternatively demand being too low, or by the theory of an equilibrium price not holding\u2014the price at which sellers will sell is higher than the price at which buyers will buy.\n\nPrior to the crisis, banks and other financial institutions had invested significant amounts of money in complicated financial assets, such as [[collateralized debt obligation]]s and [[credit default swap]]s. The value of these assets was very sensitive to economic factors, such as housing prices, default rates, and financial-market liquidity. Prior to the crisis, the value of these assets had been estimated, using the prevailing economic data.\n\nWhen it became clear that such conditions would not continue, it was no longer clear how much revenue the assets were likely to generate and, hence, how much the assets were worth. Since the assets were typically very sensitive to economic conditions, even relatively small uncertainties in the economic conditions could lead to large uncertainties in the value of the assets, which made it difficult for buyers and sellers in the market to agree on prices.\n\nFurthermore, banks and other large financial institutions were reluctant to accept lower prices for these assets, since lower prices would force them to recalculate the total value of their assets, and, if the loss was sufficiently large, force them to declare a negative total value.

The second program is called the legacy securities program, which will buy mortgage backed securities (RMBS) that were originally rated AAA and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS) which are rated AAA.

The term became common during the [[financial crisis of 2007-2008]], in which they played a major role.\n\nWhen the market for toxic assets ceases to function, it is described as \"frozen\". Markets for some toxic assets froze in 2007, and the problem grew much worse in the second half of 2008. Several factors contributed to the freezing of toxic asset markets. The value of the assets were very sensitive to economic conditions, and increased uncertainty in these conditions made it difficult to estimate the value of the assets. Banks and other major financial institutions were unwilling to sell the assets at significantly reduced prices, since lower prices would force them to reduce significantly their stated assets, making them, at least on paper, insolvent.\n\nToxic assets are also euphemistically labeled '''troubled assets'''.\n\n==Origin==\nThe term was in limited use at least as early as 2006, and may have been coined by or popularized by [[Angelo Mozilo]], founder of [[Countrywide Financial]], who used the term \"toxic\" to describe certain mortgage products in emails in spring of 2006, as revealed in SEC filings:<ref>{{Cite journal\n|title=Mozilo knew hazardous waste when he saw it\n|date=2009-06-04\n|journal=[[Los Angeles Times]]\n|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2009/06/the-use-of-toxic-to-describe-high-risk-mortgages-has-been-de-rigueur-for-the-last-two-years-now-it-looks-like-countrywide.html\n}}</ref>\n:\"[The 100% [[loan-to-value]] subprime loan is] the most dangerous product in existence and there can be nothing more toxic...\" (March 28, 2006)\nRegarding Countrywide's subprime 80/20 loans:\n:\"In all my years in the business I have never seen a more toxic prduct [sic]. It's not only subordinated to the first, but the first is subprime. In addition, the [[FICO score#FICO score|FICO]]s are below 600, below 500 and some below 400[.] With real estate values coming down ... the product will become increasingly worse.\" (April 17, 2006)\n\n==Market freeze==\nWhen the [[supply and demand]] of a good equal each other, so buyers and sellers are matched, one says that the \"[[Market clearing|market clears]]\".\n\n[[Classical economics]] and [[neoclassical economics]] posit that market clearing happens by the price adjusting\u2014upwards if demand exceeds supply and downwards if supply exceeds demand. Therefore, it reaches [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] at a price that both buyers and sellers will accept, and, in the absence of outside interference (in a free market), this will happen.\n\nThis has not happened for many types of financial assets during the financial crisis that began in 2007, hence one speaks of \"the market breaking down\".\n\nOne can explain this alternately as the price not adjusting down\u2014the price is too high, with supply being too high, or alternatively demand being too low, or by the theory of an equilibrium price not holding\u2014the price at which sellers will sell is higher than the price at which buyers will buy.\n\nPrior to the crisis, banks and other financial institutions had invested significant amounts of money in complicated financial assets, such as [[collateralized debt obligation]]s and [[credit default swap]]s. The value of these assets was very sensitive to economic factors, such as housing prices, default rates, and financial-market liquidity. Prior to the crisis, the value of these assets had been estimated, using the prevailing economic data.\n\nWhen it became clear that such conditions would not continue, it was no longer clear how much revenue the assets were likely to generate and, hence, how much the assets were worth. Since the assets were typically very sensitive to economic conditions, even relatively small uncertainties in the economic conditions could lead to large uncertainties in the value of the assets, which made it difficult for buyers and sellers in the market to agree on prices.\n\nFurthermore, banks and other large financial institutions were reluctant to accept lower prices for these assets, since lower prices would force them to recalculate the total value of their assets, and, if the loss was sufficiently large, force them to declare a negative total value. Several banks in the autumn of 2008 were forced to accept buy-outs or mergers because it was believed that they were in this situation. This re-evaluation of total assets based on prevailing market prices is known as [[mark-to-market]] pricing.
