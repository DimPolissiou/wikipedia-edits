The objective of the Congress was to provide a long-term peace plan for Europe by settling critical issues arising from the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The goal was not simply to restore old boundaries but to resize the main powers so they could balance each other and remain at peace.  The leaders were [[conservatism|conservatives]] with little use for [[republicanism]] or [[revolution]], both of which threatened to upset the [[status quo]] in Europe. France lost all its recent conquests while [[Prussia]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] made major territorial gains. Prussia added smaller German states in the west, [[Swedish Pomerania]] and 60% of the [[Kingdom of Saxony]]; Austria gained [[Venice]] and much of northern Italy. Russia gained [[Duchy of Warsaw|parts of Poland]]. The new [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] had been created just months before, and included formerly Austrian territory that in 1830 became [[Belgium]].\n\n[[File:Berlin .Gendarmenmarkt .Deutscher Dom 010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Frontispiece of the Acts of the Congress of Vienna]]\nThe immediate background was [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France's]] defeat and [[treaty of Paris (1814)|surrender in May 1814]], which brought an end to 23 years of nearly continuous war. Negotiations continued despite the outbreak of fighting triggered by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] dramatic return from exile and resumption of power in France during the [[Hundred Days]] of March to July 1815. The Congress's \"final act\" was signed nine days before his final defeat at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] on 18 June 1815.\n\nThe Congress has often been criticized for causing the subsequent suppression of the emerging national and liberal movements,<ref name=\"Olson-Shadle\"/> and it has been seen as a reactionary movement for the benefit of traditional monarchs. However, others praise it for having created relatively long-term stability and peaceful conditions in most of Europe.<ref name=Jarrett/><ref name=Schroeder/>\n\nIn a technical sense, the \"Congress of Vienna\" was not properly a congress: it never met in [[plenary session]], and most of the discussions occurred in informal, face-to-face sessions among the [[Great power|Great Powers]] of Austria, Britain, France, Russia, and sometimes Prussia, with limited or no participation by other delegates. On the other hand, the congress was the first occasion in history where, on a continental scale, national representatives came together to formulate treaties instead of relying mostly on messages among the several capitals. The Congress of Vienna settlement, despite later changes, formed [[Concert of Europe|the framework for European international politics]] until the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914.\n\n==Preliminaries==\nThe [[Treaty of Chaumont]] in 1814 had reaffirmed decisions that had been made already and that would be ratified by the more important Congress of Vienna of 1814\u201315. They included the establishment of a confederated Germany, the division of Italy into independent states, the restoration of the Bourbon kings of Spain, and the enlargement of the Netherlands to include what in 1830 became modern Belgium. The Treaty of Chaumont became the cornerstone of the European Alliance that formed the balance of power for decades.<ref>Frederick B. Artz, ''Reaction & Revolution: 1814\u20131832'' (1934) p 110</ref> Other partial settlements had already occurred at the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] between France and the [[Sixth Coalition]], and the [[Treaty of Kiel]] that covered issues raised regarding [[Scandinavia]].

On the verge of Napoleon's defeat they had outlined their common position in the [[Treaty of Chaumont]] (March 1814), and negotiated the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]] with the [[Bourbon dynasty|Bourbons]] during [[Bourbon Restoration|their restoration]]:\n* [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] was represented by [[Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Prince Metternich]], the Foreign Minister, and by his deputy, [[Baron Johann von Wessenberg-Ampringen|Baron Johann von Wessenberg]]. As the Congress's sessions were in Vienna, Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis]] was kept closely informed.\n* Britain was represented first by its [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Viscount Castlereagh]]; then by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], after Castlereagh's return to England in February 1815. In the last weeks it was headed by the [[Richard Le Poer Trench, 2nd Earl of Clancarty|Earl of Clancarty]], after Wellington left to face Napoleon during the [[Hundred Days]].\n* Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] controlled the Russian delegation which was formally led by the foreign minister, Count [[Karl Robert Nesselrode]]. The tsar had two main goals, to gain control of Poland and to promote the peaceful coexistence of European nations. He succeeded in forming the [[Holy Alliance]] (1815), based on monarchism and anti-secularism, and formed to combat any threat of revolution or republicanism.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Harold|title=The Congress of Vienna; a Study in Allied Unity, 1812\u20131822|publisher=Constable & co. ltd.|year=1946|page=158}}</ref>\n* Prussia was represented by Prince [[Karl August von Hardenberg]], the Chancellor, and the diplomat and scholar [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]].

The result was deadlock, for which Talleyrand proposed a solution: Admit France to the inner circle, and France would support Austria and Britain.

Russia received most of the Napoleonic [[Duchy of Warsaw]] as a \"Kingdom of Poland\" \u2013 called [[Congress Poland]], with the tsar as king ruling it independently of Russia. Russia, however, did not receive the [[province of Posen]] ([[Pozna\u0144]]), which was given to Prussia as the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]], nor [[Krak\u00f3w]], which became a [[Free City of Krak\u00f3w|free city]].  Furthermore, the tsar was unable to unite the new domain with the parts of Poland that had been incorporated into Russia in the 1790s.  Prussia received 60 percent of Saxony-later known as the [[Province of Saxony]], with the remainder returned to King [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony|Frederick Augustus I]] as his [[Kingdom of Saxony]].\n\n==Final Act== <!--[[Final Act of the Congress of Vienna]] links here change this section change the redirct-->\n[[File:Gains territoriaux de la France en 1814.svg|thumb|Territories left to France in 1814, but removed after the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]] in pink]]\nThe Final Act, embodying all the separate treaties, was signed on 9 June 1815 (a few days before the [[Battle of Waterloo]]).

The consolidation of Germany from the nearly 300 states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (dissolved in 1806) into a much less complex system of thirty-nine states (4 of which were free cities) was confirmed. These states formed a loose [[German Confederation]] under the leadership of Austria and [[Prussia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020|reason=For all the facts in the paragraph}}\n\nRepresentatives at the Congress agreed to numerous other territorial changes. By the [[Treaty of Kiel]], Norway had been ceded by the king of [[Denmark-Norway]] to the king of [[Sweden]]. This sparked the nationalist movement which led to the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Norway (1814)|Kingdom of Norway]] on [[Norway in 1814|May 17, 1814]] and the subsequent personal [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Union]] with [[Sweden]]. Austria gained [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia|Lombardy-Venetia]] in Northern Italy, while much of the rest of North-Central Italy went to Habsburg dynasties (the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], the [[Duchy of Modena]], and the [[Duchy of Parma]]).<ref name=\"Stearns-Langer\">{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Stearns |first=Peter N. |last2=Langer |first2=William Leonard |year=2001 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MziRd4ddZz4C&pg=PA440&dq=Murat+support+of+Napoleon+restoration++Ferdinand+IV+to+the+throne&hl=cs&ei=beaZTL_JDdWRjAeuis0t&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCYQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q&f=false 440] |title=The Encyclopedia of world history: ancient, medieval, and modern |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |edition=6th |isbn=0-395-65237-5}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Papal States]] were restored to the Pope. The Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia was restored to its mainland possessions, and also gained control of the Republic of [[Genoa]]. In Southern Italy, Napoleon's brother-in-law, [[Joachim Murat]], was originally allowed to retain his [[Kingdom of Naples]], but his support of Napoleon in the [[Hundred Days]] led to the restoration of the Bourbon [[Ferdinand IV of Naples|Ferdinand IV]] to the throne.{{sfn|Stearns|Langer|2001|p=440}}\n\nA large [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was formed for the [[Prince of Orange]], including both the old [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] and the formerly Austrian-ruled territories in the Southern Netherlands.

The [[Duchy of Lauenburg]] was transferred from Hanover to Denmark, and Prussia annexed [[Swedish Pomerania]]. [[Switzerland]] was enlarged, and Swiss neutrality was established.

Portugal is historically Britain's oldest ally, and with British support succeeded in having the re-incorporation of Olivenza decreed in [[Wikisource:Final Act of the Congress of Vienna/General Treaty#ART.CV|Article CV]] of the General Treaty of the Final Act, which stated that \"The Powers, recognizing the justice of the claims of ... Portugal and the Brazils, upon the town of Olivenza, and the other territories ceded to Spain by the [[Treaty of Badajoz (1801)|Treaty of Badajoz]] of 1801\". Portugal ratified the Final Act in 1815 but Spain would not sign, and this became the most important hold-out against the Congress of Vienna. Deciding in the end that it was better to become part of Europe than to stand alone, Spain finally accepted the Treaty on 7 May 1817; however, Olivenza and its surroundings were never returned to Portuguese control and this issue remains unresolved.{{sfn||Hammond|1966|p={{page number|date=January 2020}} }}\n\nThe United Kingdom received parts of the [[West Indies]] at the expense of the Netherlands and Spain and kept the former Dutch colonies of [[Ceylon]] and the [[Cape Colony]] as well as [[Malta]] and [[Heligoland]].

The objective of the Congress was to provide a long-term peace plan for Europe by settling critical issues arising from the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The goal was not simply to restore old boundaries but to resize the main powers so they could balance each other and remain at peace.  The leaders were [[conservatism|conservatives]] with little use for [[republicanism]] or [[revolution]], both of which threatened to upset the [[status quo]] in Europe. France lost all its recent conquests while [[Prussia]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] made major territorial gains. Prussia added smaller German states in the west, [[Swedish Pomerania]] and 60% of the [[Kingdom of Saxony]]; Austria gained [[Venice]] and much of northern Italy. Russia gained [[Duchy of Warsaw|parts of Poland]]. The new [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] had been created just months before, and included formerly Austrian territory that in 1830 became [[Belgium]].\n\n[[File:Berlin .Gendarmenmarkt .Deutscher Dom 010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Frontispiece of the Acts of the Congress of Vienna]]\nThe immediate background was [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France's]] defeat and [[treaty of Paris (1814)|surrender in May 1814]], which brought an end to 23 years of nearly continuous war. Negotiations continued despite the outbreak of fighting triggered by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] dramatic return from exile and resumption of power in France during the [[Hundred Days]] of March to July 1815. The Congress's \"final act\" was signed nine days before his final defeat at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] on 18 June 1815.\n\nThe Congress has often been criticized for causing the subsequent suppression of the emerging national and liberal movements,<ref name=\"Olson-Shadle\"/> and it has been seen as a reactionary movement for the benefit of traditional monarchs. However, others praise it for having created relatively long-term stability and peaceful conditions in most of Europe.<ref name=Jarrett/><ref name=Schroeder/>\n\nIn a technical sense, the \"Congress of Vienna\" was not properly a congress: it never met in [[plenary session]], and most of the discussions occurred in informal, face-to-face sessions among the [[Great power|Great Powers]] of Austria, Britain, France, Russia, and sometimes Prussia, with limited or no participation by other delegates. On the other hand, the congress was the first occasion in history where, on a continental scale, national representatives came together to formulate treaties instead of relying mostly on messages among the several capitals. The Congress of Vienna settlement, despite later changes, formed [[Concert of Europe|the framework for European international politics]] until the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914.\n\n==Preliminaries==\nThe [[Treaty of Chaumont]] in 1814 had reaffirmed decisions that had been made already and that would be ratified by the more important Congress of Vienna of 1814\u201315. They included the establishment of a confederated Germany, the division of Italy into independent states, the restoration of the Bourbon kings of Spain, and the enlargement of the Netherlands to include what in 1830 became modern Belgium.

The result was deadlock, for which Talleyrand proposed a solution: Admit France to the inner circle, and France would support Austria and Britain.

Russia received most of the Napoleonic [[Duchy of Warsaw]] as a \"Kingdom of Poland\" \u2013 called [[Congress Poland]], with the tsar as king ruling it independently of Russia. Russia, however, did not receive the [[province of Posen]] ([[Pozna\u0144]]), which was given to Prussia as the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]], nor [[Krak\u00f3w]], which became a [[Free City of Krak\u00f3w|free city]].  Furthermore, the tsar was unable to unite the new domain with the parts of Poland that had been incorporated into Russia in the 1790s.  Prussia received 60 percent of Saxony-later known as the [[Province of Saxony]], with the remainder returned to King [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony|Frederick Augustus I]] as his [[Kingdom of Saxony]].\n\n==Final Act== <!--[[Final Act of the Congress of Vienna]] links here change this section change the redirct-->\n[[File:Gains territoriaux de la France en 1814.svg|thumb|Territories left to France in 1814, but removed after the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]] in pink]]\nThe Final Act, embodying all the separate treaties, was signed on 9 June 1815 (a few days before the [[Battle of Waterloo]]).

Portugal is historically Britain's oldest ally, and with British support succeeded in having the re-incorporation of Olivenza decreed in [[Wikisource:Final Act of the Congress of Vienna/General Treaty#ART.CV|Article CV]] of the General Treaty of the Final Act, which stated that \"The Powers, recognizing the justice of the claims of ... Portugal and the Brazils, upon the town of Olivenza, and the other territories ceded to Spain by the [[Treaty of Badajoz (1801)|Treaty of Badajoz]] of 1801\". Portugal ratified the Final Act in 1815 but Spain would not sign, and this became the most important hold-out against the Congress of Vienna. Deciding in the end that it was better to become part of Europe than to stand alone, Spain finally accepted the Treaty on 7 May 1817; however, Olivenza and its surroundings were never returned to Portuguese control and this issue remains unresolved.{{sfn||Hammond|1966|p={{page number|date=January 2020}} }}\n\nThe United Kingdom received parts of the [[West Indies]] at the expense of the Netherlands and Spain and kept the former Dutch colonies of [[Ceylon]] and the [[Cape Colony]] as well as [[Malta]] and [[Heligoland]].

Among these is [[Henry Kissinger]], who in 1954 wrote his [[doctoral dissertation]], ''[[A World Restored]]'', on it. Historian Mark Jarrett argues that the Congress of Vienna and the Congress System marked \"the true beginning of our modern era\". He says the Congress System was deliberate conflict management, and was the first genuine attempt to create an international order based upon consensus rather than conflict. \"Europe was ready,\" Jarrett states, \"to accept an unprecedented degree of international cooperation in response to the French Revolution.\"<ref name=Jarrett>Mark Jarrett, ''The Congress of Vienna and Its Legacy: War and Great Power Diplomacy after Napoleon'' (2013) pp. 353, xiv, 187.</ref> Historian Paul Schroeder argues that the old formulae for \"[[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]\" were in fact highly destabilizing and predatory.

Harvest Bloc) was a bloc of 17 [[Israeli settlements]] in the southern [[Gaza strip]]. In August 2005, the [[Israeli army]] carried out the Cabinet's decision and forcibly removed the 8,600 residents of Gush Katif from their homes. Their communities were demolished as part of [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Israel's unilateral disengagement]] from the Gaza Strip.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Gaza strip may 2005.jpg|thumb|Map of the Gaza Strip in May 2005, a few months prior to the Israeli withdrawal from Gush Katif. The Gush Katif settlement bloc was the blue-shaded region in the southwest of this map.]] \n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}\nGush Katif was located on the southwestern edge of the Gaza Strip, bordered on the southwest by [[Rafah]] and the Egyptian border, on the east by [[Khan Yunis]], on the northeast by [[Deir el-Balah]], and on the west and northwest by the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. A narrow one kilometer strip of land populated by [[Bedouin]]s known as [[al-Mawasi]] lay along the Mediterranean coast. Most of Gush Katif was situated on the [[sand dunes]] that separate the [[coastal plain]] from the sea along much of the southeastern Mediterranean.\n\nTwo roads served the residents of Gush Katif: Road 230, which runs from the southwest along the sea from the Egyptian border at [[Rafiah Yam]] through [[Kfar Yam]] to [[Tel Katifa]] on the bloc's northern border, where it entered Palestinian-controlled territory, and Road 240, which also runs parallel to the sea approximately one kilometre inland, and upon which the majority of the settlements and traffic were located. Road 240's southern end turned south to reach [[Morag (moshav)|Morag]] and continued to [[Sufah]] and the Shalom bloc of villages south of the Gaza Strip, while its northern end turned east to the [[Kissufim]] [[Kissufim junction|junction]], and served as the main route into Gush Katif. These roads were forbidden to Palestinian Arab drivers.\n\nWhile [[Kfar Darom]] and [[Netzarim (settlement)|Netzarim]] were originally accessed along the main road to [[Gaza City|Gaza]] (known as \"Tencher Road\"), Israeli and Palestinian traffic was separated after the [[Oslo Accords]] and the escalation in Arab terror. Netzarim was isolated as an [[enclave]] accessed only through the [[Karni crossing]] and the [[Sa'ad (kibbutz)|Sa'ad]] [[Sa'ad junction|junction]] and in the latter years, only by IDF armored vehicles. In 2002, a bridge was built for Road 240 over the Tencher road so as to physically separate the two arteries and allow unobstructed travel for both Palestinian and Israeli traffic.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{See also|Population statistics for Israeli Gaza Strip settlements}}\n[[Image:Gush Katif-N-Dekalim02.jpg|thumb|[[Neve Dekalim]] was Gush Katif's urban center and home to the largest community.]]\nAbout 8,600 residents lived in Gush Katif,<ref>[http://www.fmep.org/settlement_info/stats_data/gaza_strip_settlements.html Foundation for Middle East Peace, \"Settlements in the Gaza Strip\"]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512095055/http://www.fmep.org/settlement_info/stats_data/gaza_strip_settlements.html |date=May 12, 2006 }}</ref> many of them [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionist]] Jews, though many non-observant and [[Secular Jewish culture|secular Jew]]s also called it home. The three northernmost communities: Nisanit, Dugit and Rafiah Yam were secular. The area also included several hundred Muslim families, mostly of the [[al-Mawasi]] [[Bedouin]] community, who while technically Palestinian residents, were able to enjoy freedom of movement within the Israeli areas due to their peaceful relations. Contrary reports have noted the severity of the restriction of movement for Palestinian residents.<ref>{{cite web|title=Al-Mawasi, Gaza Strip: Impossible Life in an Isolated Enclave, March 2003|url=http://www.btselem.org/publications/summaries/200303_al_mawasi|website=B'tslem|publisher=B'tslem|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nJews and their Israelite ancestors have lived in Gaza since Biblical times.

Land for the village of [[Kfar Darom]] was purchased in the 1930s and settled in 1946. It was evacuated following an Egyptian siege in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]].\n\nGush Katif began in 1968, when [[Yigal Allon]] presented an initiative for the founding of two [[Nahal settlement]]s in the center of the Gaza Strip. He viewed the breaking of the continuity between the northern and southern Arab settlements as vital to Israel's security in the area, which had been captured the previous year in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. In 1970, Kfar Darom was reestablished as the first of many Israeli agricultural villages in the area. Allon's idea was ultimately designed with five key areas (or 'fingers,' thus being called by some the \"five-finger print\") slated for Israeli presence along the length of the Gaza Strip. After the [[Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty]] and the dismantling of the fifth 'finger' ([[Yamit]] bloc) south of Rafah, the fourth ([[Morag (moshav)|Morag]]) and third (Kfar Darom) strips were united into one bloc that would become known as Gush Katif. The second finger, [[Netzarim (settlement)|Netzarim]], was very much connected to Gush Katif until the arrangements following the [[Oslo Accords]], while the bloc on the dunes north of Gaza, which straddled the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]], was more a part of the [[Ashkelon]] area communities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.idf.il/dover/site/mainpage.asp?sl=EN&id=22&docid=43198&clr=1&subject=43024&Pos=1&bScope=False |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311165358/http://www1.idf.il/dover/site/mainpage.asp?sl=EN&id=22&docid=43198&clr=1&subject=43024&Pos=1&bScope=False |archivedate=2007-03-11 }}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s new communities were established, especially with the influx of former residents of the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]. Most of the bloc's communities were established as agricultural cooperatives called [[moshav]]s, where the residents from each town would work in clusters of [[greenhouses]] just outside the residential areas.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Gush Katif-Morag01.jpg|thumb|right|Greenhouses, like these in [[Morag (moshav)|Morag]], were the center of the bloc's industry.]]\nIn the Katif Bloc's greenhouses, advanced technology was used to grow pest-free [[leafy vegetable]]s and [[herb]]s answering to the strictest health, aesthetic and [[Kashrut#Vegetarianism|religious]] requirements.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Most of the [[Organic farming|organic agricultural product]]s were exported to Europe.

On September 12, 2005, the Israeli Army withdrew from each settlement up to the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]]. All public buildings (schools, libraries, community centres, office buildings) as well as industrial buildings, factories, and greenhouses which could not be taken apart were left intact.\n\nOriginally, the Israeli cabinet had planned to destroy synagogues in the settlement, but the government caved in to pressure from religious Jewish organizations and reversed its decision.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20050911/ap_on_re_mi_ea/israel_palestinians_18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121044441/https://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=%2Fap%2F20050911%2Fap_on_re_mi_ea%2Fisrael_palestinians_18 |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 21, 2018 |title=First Israeli Army Convoys Depart Gaza |author=JOSEF FEDERMAN/[[w:Associated Press|Associated Press]] |publisher=Yahoo! |date=September 11, 2005 |access-date=January 5, 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/181_1489529,00050004.htm |title=Palestinians set Gaza synagogues on fire |author=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=September 12, 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030640/http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/181_1489529,00050004.htm |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}</ref> However, most of the synagogues were destroyed by Palestinian mobs immediately after the evacuation.

The settlers, backed by the right-wing, as shown in the Likud referendum, claimed Israel had a historic right to the land and that they provided an important defense buffer against attacks by Palestinians. The conservative government of Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] argued that remaining in Gaza was too costly in both money and lives.\n\nSharon's withdrawal did not advance the peace process because, from the Palestinian perspective, the unilateral pullout took place without negotiation on wider issues affecting both sides.

Israel, the U.S. and a number of European governments refused to recognize Hamas\u2019 election victory and imposed an economic blockade on Gaza. During June 2007, an internal civil conflict between Hamas and Fatah resulted in Hamas taking control of the Gaza Strip, while Fatah ruled the West Bank.<ref>New York Times, June 14, 2007, https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/14/world/middleeast/14mideast.html</ref>\n\nIn May 2011 both parties agreed to reconstitute a united Palestinian government and hold elections by May 2012.<ref>Washington Post https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/palestinian_factions_formally_sign_unity_accord/2011/05/04/AFD89MmF_story.html?wprss=rss_middle-east</ref>\n\nIn July 2014 Israel experienced the effects of the disengagement and Hamas coming to power which resulted in [[Operation Protective Edge]] as Israel sought to protect its residents from the barrage of rockets fired from Gaza; destroyed a network of tunnels aimed at Israel's southern communities; and targeted Hamas bases some of which were located where Gush Katif once stood.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/164158 | title=Hamas Tests Improved Long-Range Missiles}}</ref>\nMany politicians and journalists realized the connection between the Israeli 2005 withdrawal and the Hamas takeover.

Harvest Bloc) was a bloc of 17 [[Israeli settlements]] in the southern [[Gaza strip]]. In August 2005, the [[Israeli army]] carried out the Cabinet's decision and forcibly removed the 8,600 residents of Gush Katif from their homes. Their communities were demolished as part of [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Israel's unilateral disengagement]] from the Gaza Strip.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Gaza strip may 2005.jpg|thumb|Map of the Gaza Strip in May 2005, a few months prior to the Israeli withdrawal from Gush Katif. The Gush Katif settlement bloc was the blue-shaded region in the southwest of this map.]] \n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}\nGush Katif was located on the southwestern edge of the Gaza Strip, bordered on the southwest by [[Rafah]] and the Egyptian border, on the east by [[Khan Yunis]], on the northeast by [[Deir el-Balah]], and on the west and northwest by the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. A narrow one kilometer strip of land populated by [[Bedouin]]s known as [[al-Mawasi]] lay along the Mediterranean coast. Most of Gush Katif was situated on the [[sand dunes]] that separate the [[coastal plain]] from the sea along much of the southeastern Mediterranean.\n\nTwo roads served the residents of Gush Katif: Road 230, which runs from the southwest along the sea from the Egyptian border at [[Rafiah Yam]] through [[Kfar Yam]] to [[Tel Katifa]] on the bloc's northern border, where it entered Palestinian-controlled territory, and Road 240, which also runs parallel to the sea approximately one kilometre inland, and upon which the majority of the settlements and traffic were located. Road 240's southern end turned south to reach [[Morag (moshav)|Morag]] and continued to [[Sufah]] and the Shalom bloc of villages south of the Gaza Strip, while its northern end turned east to the [[Kissufim]] [[Kissufim junction|junction]], and served as the main route into Gush Katif. These roads were forbidden to Palestinian Arab drivers.\n\nWhile [[Kfar Darom]] and [[Netzarim (settlement)|Netzarim]] were originally accessed along the main road to [[Gaza City|Gaza]] (known as \"Tencher Road\"), Israeli and Palestinian traffic was separated after the [[Oslo Accords]] and the escalation in Arab terror. Netzarim was isolated as an [[enclave]] accessed only through the [[Karni crossing]] and the [[Sa'ad (kibbutz)|Sa'ad]] [[Sa'ad junction|junction]] and in the latter years, only by IDF armored vehicles. In 2002, a bridge was built for Road 240 over the Tencher road so as to physically separate the two arteries and allow unobstructed travel for both Palestinian and Israeli traffic.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{See also|Population statistics for Israeli Gaza Strip settlements}}\n[[Image:Gush Katif-N-Dekalim02.jpg|thumb|[[Neve Dekalim]] was Gush Katif's urban center and home to the largest community.]]\nAbout 8,600 residents lived in Gush Katif,<ref>[http://www.fmep.org/settlement_info/stats_data/gaza_strip_settlements.html Foundation for Middle East Peace, \"Settlements in the Gaza Strip\"]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512095055/http://www.fmep.org/settlement_info/stats_data/gaza_strip_settlements.html |date=May 12, 2006 }}</ref> many of them [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionist]] Jews, though many non-observant and [[Secular Jewish culture|secular Jew]]s also called it home.

Land for the village of [[Kfar Darom]] was purchased in the 1930s and settled in 1946. It was evacuated following an Egyptian siege in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]].\n\nGush Katif began in 1968, when [[Yigal Allon]] presented an initiative for the founding of two [[Nahal settlement]]s in the center of the Gaza Strip. He viewed the breaking of the continuity between the northern and southern Arab settlements as vital to Israel's security in the area, which had been captured the previous year in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. In 1970, Kfar Darom was reestablished as the first of many Israeli agricultural villages in the area. Allon's idea was ultimately designed with five key areas (or 'fingers,' thus being called by some the \"five-finger print\") slated for Israeli presence along the length of the Gaza Strip. After the [[Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty]] and the dismantling of the fifth 'finger' ([[Yamit]] bloc) south of Rafah, the fourth ([[Morag (moshav)|Morag]]) and third (Kfar Darom) strips were united into one bloc that would become known as Gush Katif. The second finger, [[Netzarim (settlement)|Netzarim]], was very much connected to Gush Katif until the arrangements following the [[Oslo Accords]], while the bloc on the dunes north of Gaza, which straddled the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]], was more a part of the [[Ashkelon]] area communities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.idf.il/dover/site/mainpage.asp?sl=EN&id=22&docid=43198&clr=1&subject=43024&Pos=1&bScope=False |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311165358/http://www1.idf.il/dover/site/mainpage.asp?sl=EN&id=22&docid=43198&clr=1&subject=43024&Pos=1&bScope=False |archivedate=2007-03-11 }}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s new communities were established, especially with the influx of former residents of the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]].

On August 15, 2005, the forcible evacuation of the Gush Katif settlements began. On August 22, 2005, the residents of the last settlement, Netzarim, were evicted. In essence, many residents returned to pack the contents of their homes and the Israeli government began the destruction of all residential buildings. On September 12, 2005, the Israeli Army withdrew from each settlement up to the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]]. All public buildings (schools, libraries, community centres, office buildings) as well as industrial buildings, factories, and greenhouses which could not be taken apart were left intact.\n\nOriginally, the Israeli cabinet had planned to destroy synagogues in the settlement, but the government caved in to pressure from religious Jewish organizations and reversed its decision.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20050911/ap_on_re_mi_ea/israel_palestinians_18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121044441/https://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=%2Fap%2F20050911%2Fap_on_re_mi_ea%2Fisrael_palestinians_18 |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 21, 2018 |title=First Israeli Army Convoys Depart Gaza |author=JOSEF FEDERMAN/[[w:Associated Press|Associated Press]] |publisher=Yahoo! |date=September 11, 2005 |access-date=January 5, 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/181_1489529,00050004.htm |title=Palestinians set Gaza synagogues on fire |author=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=September 12, 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030640/http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/181_1489529,00050004.htm |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}</ref> However, most of the synagogues were destroyed by Palestinian mobs immediately after the evacuation.

The settlers, backed by the right-wing, as shown in the Likud referendum, claimed Israel had a historic right to the land and that they provided an important defense buffer against attacks by Palestinians. The conservative government of Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] argued that remaining in Gaza was too costly in both money and lives.\n\nSharon\u2019s withdrawal did not advance the peace process because, from the Palestinian perspective, the unilateral pullout took place without negotiation on wider issues affecting both sides. NPR addressed this issue in a Q&A about Israel\u2019s pullout from Gaza.<ref>NPR Q&A https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4775357</ref>\n\n===History after Israeli withdrawal===\nAfter the Israeli withdrawal of settlers, the Palestinian Authority took control of Gaza. On January 25, 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections in both Gaza and the West Bank. Israel, the U.S. and a number of European governments refused to recognize Hamas\u2019 election victory and imposed an economic blockade on Gaza. During June 2007, an internal civil conflict between Hamas and Fatah resulted in Hamas taking control of the Gaza Strip, while Fatah ruled the West Bank.<ref>New York Times, June 14, 2007, https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/14/world/middleeast/14mideast.html</ref>\n\nIn May 2011 both parties agreed to reconstitute a united Palestinian government and hold elections by May 2012.<ref>Washington Post https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/palestinian_factions_formally_sign_unity_accord/2011/05/04/AFD89MmF_story.html?wprss=rss_middle-east</ref>\n\nIn July 2014 Israel experienced the effects of the disengagement and Hamas coming to power which resulted in [[Operation Protective Edge]] as Israel sought to protect its residents from the barrage of rockets fired from Gaza; destroyed a network of tunnels aimed at Israel's southern communities; and targeted Hamas bases some of which were located where Gush Katif once stood.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/164158 | title=Hamas Tests Improved Long-Range Missiles}}</ref>\nMany politicians and journalists realized the connection between the Israeli 2005 withdrawal and the Hamas takeover.

Palestinians dismantled most of what remained, scavenging for cement, rebar and other construction materials. \nThere had been an intense public conflict regarding the many public structures and synagogues in Gush Katif. \"Many asserted that the buildings must be destroyed in order to ensure that they would not be used by terrorist organizations in the future.

Sardina's interest in music started at a young age. At the age of 6, he secretly played his younger sister's guitar and later told his mother he wanted to become a professional musician.\n\nHis parents moved to [[San Diego|San Diego, California]] when he was 15. After a couple of months, Sardina returned to Spain, finished school and started playing in bands. His first experience in a recording studio was at age 16, when he attended a recording session of his cousin's band in [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]].\n\nSardina joined medical school at age 16. During his second year of school, he started working as [[Live sound mixing|front of house]] and [[Live sound mixing|monitor engineer]] for local acts. During his fourth year of school and right before taking the final exam, Sardina decided to drop out. He saved up for a three-week recording certification program at [[Recording Workshop|The Recording Workshop]] school in [[Chillicothe, Ohio]]. Sardina then went back to Spain and continued saving until he enrolled in a program at [[Full Sail University]] in [[Orlando, Florida]].\n\nIn 1993, four weeks before graduating with a Valedictorian Award,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fullsail.edu/about/full-sail-stories/alumni-credited-on-latin-grammy-nominated-projects|title=Seventeen Alumni Credited on Latin GRAMMY Nominated Projects|website=www.fullsail.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imsta.org/panelists/rafa_sardina.php|title=Panelist Biography|website=www.imsta.org|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> Sardina organized a 24-hour trip to [[Los Angeles]]. He did interviews at [[Record Plant]], [[Westlake Recording Studios]] and [[Ocean Way Recording]], where he later started working and became assistant engineer. During his time at Ocean Way, Sardina recorded artists including [[Celine Dion]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Dr. Dre]] and [[David Foster]].\n\nIn 2001, after working for 5 years at Ocean Way, Sardina founded Fishbone Productions and started working as an independent engineer, recording at his studio \"AfterHours\". Sardina became better known for his work on [[Pop music|Pop]], [[Rock music|Rock]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[Latin music|Latin]] records, although he also works on a variety of genres including [[Jazz]], [[Orchestra|Orchestral]], [[Gospel music|Gospel]], [[World music|World]] and [[Soundtrack|Film/TV soundtracks]].

Sardina's interest in music started at a young age. At the age of 6, he secretly played his younger sister's guitar and later told his mother he wanted to become a professional musician.\n\nHis parents moved to [[San Diego|San Diego, California]] when he was 15. After a couple of months, Sardina returned to Spain, finished school and started playing in bands. His first experience in a recording studio was at age 16, when he attended a recording session of his cousin's band in [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]].\n\nSardina joined medical school at age 16. During his second year of school, he started working as [[Live sound mixing|front of house]] and [[Live sound mixing|monitor engineer]] for local acts. During his fourth year of school and right before taking the final exam, Sardina decided to drop out. He saved up for a three-week recording certification program at [[Recording Workshop|The Recording Workshop]] school in [[Chillicothe, Ohio]]. Sardina then went back to Spain and continued saving until he enrolled in a program at [[Full Sail University]] in [[Orlando, Florida]].\n\nIn 1993, four weeks before graduating with a Valedictorian Award,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fullsail.edu/about/full-sail-stories/alumni-credited-on-latin-grammy-nominated-projects|title=Seventeen Alumni Credited on Latin GRAMMY Nominated Projects|website=www.fullsail.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imsta.org/panelists/rafa_sardina.php|title=Panelist Biography|website=www.imsta.org|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> Sardina organized a 24-hour trip to [[Los Angeles]]. He did interviews at [[Record Plant]], [[Westlake Recording Studios]] and [[Ocean Way Recording]], where he later started working and became assistant engineer. During his time at Ocean Way, Sardina recorded artists including [[Celine Dion]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Dr. Dre]] and [[David Foster]].\n\nIn 2001, after working for 5 years at Ocean Way, Sardina founded Fishbone Productions and started working as an independent engineer, recording at his studio \"AfterHours\". Sardina became better known for his work on [[Pop music|Pop]], [[Rock music|Rock]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[Latin music|Latin]] records, although he also works on a variety of genres including [[Jazz]], [[Orchestra|Orchestral]], [[Gospel music|Gospel]], [[World music|World]] and [[Soundtrack|Film/TV soundtracks]]. He continued working with artists including [[Alejandro Sanz]], [[Luis Miguel]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Lady Gaga]] and [[D'Angelo]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSardina engineered the album \"Symphonic Soweto: A Tribute To Nelson Mandela\", which won the South African Music Award for Best Contemporary Album in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aes.org/events/145/presenters/?ID=7496|title=AES New York 2018 \u00bb Presenters: Rafa Sardina|website=www.aes.org|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesouthafrican.com/lifestyle/samas2018-all-the-winners-at-this-years-awards/|title=#SAMAs 2018: Full list of the winners from this year's awards|date=2018-06-03|work=The South African|access-date=2020-04-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== AfterHours Studios ==\nSardina founded AfterHours Studios to record his projects. AfterHours was first located at his previous house. Sardina describes it as being ''\"just a tiny room, tracking little things like drums in the hallway\"''.\n\nThe studio is now located in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles]], where he remodeled a two story three-car garage and an adjacent room. The live room, control room and isolation booth are on the first floor, while an office and a lounge are located on the second floor. The studio operates around a [[Solid State Logic]] Duality console and incorporates multiple [[Effects unit|outboard processors]] into a [[Digital audio workstation|digital recording system]].<ref

{"title_page": "History of the Jews in the Byzantine Empire", "text_new": "{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}\nThe '''history of the [[Jews]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]]''' has been well recorded and preserved.\n\n==Background and legal standing==\n\nAfter the decline of the Greek-speaking [[Hellenistic Judaism]] in ancient times, the use of the Greek language and the integration of the Greek culture into Judaism continued to be an integral part of the life in Jewish communities in the Byzantine Empire.<ref>De Lange, N. R. M. \"Greek Jewish Texts from the Cairo Genizah\". 1996</ref> The legal standing of the Jews of the Byzantine Empire was unique during the entire history of the Empire; they did not belong to the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Eastern Orthodox]] faith, which was the [[State church of the Roman Empire|state religion]], nor were they\u2014in most circumstances\u2014grouped together with [[heresy|heretics]] and [[pagan]]s. They were placed in a legal position somewhere between the two worlds. The place along the spectrum of social freedom in which Byzantine Jews found themselves varied somewhat\u2014though far from drastically\u2014with time, and depended largely on three factors: the [[theology|theological]] desire of the state to maintain the Jews as a living testament to the victory of Christianity, the desire of the state to strengthen its control, and the ability of centralized rule from [[Constantinople]] to enforce its [[legislation]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Foundations of the legal position of Jews: 330\u2013404==\n\nIn 212, [[Caracalla]] bestowed [[Constitutio Antoniniana|citizenship]] on all its residents, including the Jews. This granted Jews [[legal equality]] to all other citizens, and formed the foundation of their legal status in Byzantium following the founding of Constantinople in 330.<ref name = \"Sharf20\">Sharf, p. 20</ref> Indeed, Jews enjoyed the right to practice their faith under the rule of the Byzantines, as long as they paid the [[Fiscus Judaicus]]. For example, [[circumcision]], which was considered [[mutilation]] and therefore [[death penalty|punishable by death]] if performed on a non-Jewish child, and by [[exile]] if performed on a non-Jewish adult, was legally permitted within Jewish religious practices. Byzantine law recognized [[synagogue]]s as places of worship, which could not be arbitrarily molested, Jewish courts had the force of law in [[civil case]]s, and Jews could not be forced to violate ''[[Shabbat]]'' and their [[Jewish festivals|festivals]].<ref name=\"Sharf20-1\">Sharf, pp. 20-1</ref>\n\nSince the year 390 nearly all of the territory of present-day Israel came under Byzantine suzerainty. The area was divided into the following provinces: [[Palestina Prima]], [[Palestina Secunda]] and [[Palestina Salutaris|Palestina Tertia]]. These provinces were part of the [[Diocese of the East]].<ref name = \"Lehmann\">{{cite web | url = http://www.usd.edu/~clehmann/erp/Palestine/history.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090811054625/http://www.usd.edu/~clehmann/erp/Palestine/history.htm | archivedate = 2009-08-11 <!-- 054625 --> | title = Palestine: History: 135\u2013337: Syria Palaestina and the Tetrarchy| accessdate = 2014-08-24| last = Lehmann| first = Clayton Miles|date=Summer 1998| work = The On-line Encyclopedia of the Roman Provinces| publisher = University of South Dakota}}</ref>\n\n==Theodosian Code: 404\u2013527==\n\nIn 404, Jews were excluded from certain governmental posts.<ref name=\"Sharf21\">Sharf, p. 21</ref> In 418, they were barred from the [[civil service]], and from all military positions.<ref name=\"Linder281\">Linder, p. 281</ref> In 425, they were excluded from all remaining public offices, both civilian and military\u2014a prohibition which [[Justinian I]] reiterated.<ref name=\"Sharf21\" /> Such restrictions, however, inevitably compromised the theological arguments for restricting the Jewish [[religion]]; although they empowered the Christian citizens of the empire at the expense of its Jews, all laws dealing with the Jews implicitly recognized the continued existence and legality of the Jewish religion.<ref name=\"Brewer135\">Brewer, p. 135</ref>\n\nThus Emperor [[Theodosius II]] found that he had to balance the first two of the three factors governing the treatment of Jews in the empire\u2014theology, political [[pragmatism]] and enforceability. He could not, however, effectively control the third. In 438, Theodosius had to reaffirm the prohibition on Jews holding public office, because it had been poorly enforced.<ref name=\"Brewer130\">Brewer, p. 130</ref> Even in 527, a decree which renewed this prohibition began by observing that \"heedless of the laws' command [they have] infiltrated public offices\".<ref name=\"Linder360\">Linder, p. 360</ref>\n\nThere was one office, however, that Jews were not forbidden from assuming. This was the office of [[decurion (administrative)|decurion]], a tax collector who was required to pay all deficits in [[revenue]] from his own pocket. Theodosius II, who laid out much of the legal [[precedent]] and foundation for Byzantine law in his [[Theodosian Code]], permitted Jews, like other citizens, to hire a substitute to perform the duties of decurion in their place.<ref name=\"Sharf21\">Sharf, p. 21</ref> Justinian, whose legal code included 33 laws relating to the Jews,<ref name=\"Brewer127\">Brewer, p. 127</ref> initially maintained this ability, but it was abolished in 537.<ref name=\"Sharf21\" /> Sharf explains that the purpose of this was so that the Jews \"never enjoy the fruits of office, but only suffer its pains and penalties\".<ref name=\"Sharf21\" />\n\nIn addition to the matter of holding public office, Jews were also unequal to Christians with respect to the ownership of [[slave]]s. Restrictions on the ownership of Christian slaves by Jews were in place through the reign of many emperors, under the fear that Jews would use conversion of slaves as a means to increase their number. Additionally, this was designed to provide an incentive for non-Christian slaves to convert into Christianity, and an economic restriction on the Jews. Restrictions on slave-owning could not, however, be excessively burdensome, because slaves, although numerous, were between 10-15% of the population.<ref>Slavery in the Late Ancient World, pp.&nbsp;55\u201360, Kyle Harper, 2011</ref> Under the Theodosian Code, therefore, ownership of Christian slaves by Jews was not prohibited, although their purchase was. Thus, one who gained possession of a slave by means such as inheritance would remain his or her owner. Purchase of slaves was usually penalized by compelled sale at the original purchase price.<ref name=\"Sharf22\">Sharf, p. 22</ref>\n\nSlave ownership produces another example of the threefold balancing act of Legislation dealing with the Jewish minority of Byzantium: ownership of Christian slaves undermined the \"living testament\" theology, but was a pragmatic requirement of the time, and the prohibition thereof could not be entirely enforced, since freedom may not necessarily have been a desirable option for a slave who was well-treated by his masters.<ref name=\"Fieldman394\">Fieldman, p. 394</ref>\n\nThe third important restriction on Judaism\u2014in addition to the limitations on public service and slave ownership\u2014was that the Jewish religion, though allowed to survive, was not allowed to thrive. Theologically, the victory of Christianity could be successfully asserted by maintaining a small contingent of Jews within the empire, although allowing them to become too sizable a minority would threaten the theological monopoly of [[Orthodox Christianity]] within the Empire.<ref name=\"Sharf22\" />\n\nOne important ramification of this policy was the prohibition on the construction of new synagogues within the Empire, though the repair of old synagogues was permitted. This prohibition was difficult to enforce, as archaeological evidence in Israel indicates that illegal synagogue construction continued throughout the sixth century.<ref name=\"Gray262-3\">Gray, pp. 262-3</ref> The synagogue did continue to be respected as an inviolable [[place of worship]] until the reign of Justinian.\n\nBeginning at this time, most legislation regarding the Jews\u2014even laws which expanded the rights which they were afforded\u2014were \"prefaced by unambiguous expressions of hatred and contempt for Judaism\".<ref name=\"Sharf23\" />\n\n==Justinian Code: 527\u2013565==\n\nThe [[Justinian Code|Civil Code]] of Justinian tightened the regulations on the ownership of Christian slaves by non-Christians. It abolished compensation for illegal purchases of Christian slaves, and added a 30&nbsp;lb gold fine for this offense. Jews owning Christian slaves during the time of Justinian could be punished by execution.<ref name=\"Sharf22\" />\n\nIn 545, Justinian legislated that the right of existence of any synagogue on land belonging to an [[Christian Church|ecclesiastical institution]] be nullified.<ref name=\"Sharf22\" /> He was also the first emperor to order that existing synagogues be converted into [[Church (building)|church]]es. There is, however, only one example of such a conversion taking place by force: the synagogue in [[Borem]]. This synagogue was most likely converted for military reasons, in light of its strategic position on the frontier with the territory of the Berber tribes.<ref name=\"Brewer131\" /> In fact, Justinian banned all non-Christian places of worship in [[Praetorian prefecture of Africa|northern Africa]], in legislation that grouped Jews with pagans and heretics. This legislation was hardly enforced, but set a precedent for the violability of synagogues and the blurring of the difference between Jews and other non-Christians.<ref name=\"Sharf26\">Sharf, p. 26</ref> Once more, this represents the divergence between the Empire's theological objectives, its pragmatic goals and its capability to enforce its legislation. The poor efficacy of legislation points to the dominating power of the latter in restraining the two former factors, which, in this case, coincided.\n\nThe Jews also found that they were positioned in law somewhere between other non-Christians and the Christian majority.

Ironically, what little enforcement they did enjoy contributed to a notable growth in Jewish culture and [[liturgy]]. For instance, the banning of the reading of ''Mishna'' prompted Jewish scholars to write the ''[[piyutim]]'', important works of poetry which refer strongly to the ''Mishna''. Because these were not banned by the Civil Code, they afforded Jews the ability to circumvent it. Accordingly, this form of religious expression flourished under Justinian.<ref name=\"Weinberger143\">Weinberger, p. 143</ref>\n\n==Punctuated tolerance, Jewish revolts, and the Crusades: 565\u20131204==\n\nAlthough the Justinian Code remained in force in the Eastern Empire until the ninth century,<ref name=\"Brewer127\">Brewer, p. 127</ref> the period following Justinian's reign was generally characterized by toleration of non-Christians, particularly the Jews. However, during the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]] many Jews sided against the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the [[Jewish revolt against Heraclius]], which successfully assisted the invading Persian Sassanids in conquering all of Roman Egypt and Syria.

Although most crusading bands did not adopt a policy of violence or forced conversion against the Jews, the [[First Crusade]] certainly undertook an anti-Jewish face in certain communities. Because the Crusade was undertaken with the goal of \"subjugating all non-believers to the faith,\" many crusaders compelled Jews to convert on pain of death, and there is a large number of recorded cases of mass suicides within Jewish communities\u2014particularly among Jewish maidens\u2014in order to avoid such conversions.<ref name=\"Chazan10\">Chazan, pp. 10-1</ref>\n\n==Latin occupation: 1204\u20131261==\n{{further|Latin Empire|Latinokratia}}\n\nThe [[Fourth Crusade]] further degraded the position of Byzantine Jews. As smaller states separated from a weakened empire, the rulers of these states found themselves more capable of enforcing legislation than their Byzantine counterparts. The most powerful protection on the rights of Jews\u2014governmental impotence to enforce laws\u2014was thus abolished. [[Theodore Doukas]], who crowned himself emperor of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epiros]] after he conquered [[Thessalonica]], was known for his persecution of the Jews, which began in 1229, a year before the end of his reign.<ref name=\"Charnis75\" /> Theodore's disdain for the Jews is well-established. Still, his waiting until 1229\u2014five years after capturing Thessalonica and declaring himself emperor\u2014indicates that antisemitism may not have been the cause of his anti-Jewish edicts. Rather, they appear to have been motivated by a desire to confiscate Jewish property at a time when his empire was short of funds. This explains the expropriations of Jewish property under Theodore, as well as his regime's abstention from religious persecution for its own sake.<ref name=\"Bowman14\">Bowman, p. 14</ref>\n\n[[John Vatatzes]], the emperor of [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], commenced legal persecution of the Jews in 1253.<ref name=\"Charnis75\" /> Unlike Theodore, Vatatzes ordered that the Jews within the Empire of Nicaea be converted to Christianity, though he did not order the expropriation of Jewish property.<ref name=\"Bowman18\">Bowman, p. 18</ref> Although these measures began only a year before Vatatzes' death, they seemed to have set a precedent of persecution which his son, [[Theodore II Laskaris]], followed.<ref name=\"Charnis75\" />\n\nIt was in this environment of persecution that the [[Palaiologos|Palaiologoi]] rose to the imperial throne. [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] largely ended persecution of the Jews. Bowman writes the following:\n\n:Michael VIII summoned the Jewish leaders in his realm and invited them to support him as emperor. Thus Michael's first act toward the Jews [\u2026] was the revocation of John Vatatzes's order of forced baptism. At the same time, however, he made it clear to the Jews that he expected them to show their appreciation for his assistance.<ref name=\"Bowman18\" />\n\nMichael's road to the throne had been of questionable legality, and that fact earned him many enemies. Additionally, he oversaw an empire which was strongly dependent on foreign powers, and had an immense need for gold to fund its great military expenses. It is not surprising, therefore, that he turned to the Jews and other minorities (most notably the Armenians) as a source of support in an embattled state of affairs, and when the ethnic majority and the mainstream elite had grown unfriendly toward him.<ref name=\"Bowman19\">Bowman, p. 19</ref>\n\n==A decaying Empire: 1261\u20131453==\n{{further|Byzantium under the Palaiologoi|Romaniote Jews}}\n[[File:Jews Byzantine Greek Alexander Manuscript (cropped).JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Alexander the Great]], clad as a [[Byzantine emperor]], receives a delegation of Jewish [[rabbi]]s. Miniature from the 14th-century ''Alexander Romance'']]\n[[Andronikos II Palaiologos]] followed his father's precedent. The tolerance of Andronikos was quite notable, even drawing condemnation from [[Patriarch Athanasius III of Alexandria]], against what he saw as \"excessive\" tolerance of Jews and other non-Christians, in particular for permitting them to live amongst Christians.<ref name=\"Charnis75-6\">Charnis, pp. 75-6</ref> The patriarch's complaint indicates that, in spite of the tolerance of the Palaiologoi, the norm of imperial law was to require non-Christians to live separately from Christians. This apparent trend of segregation between the peoples of Byzantium, which certainly included the Jews, is confirmed in a letter by John, bishop of Citrus, in the latter half of the twelfth century, which declared that, \"People of alien tongues and alien beliefs, such as Jews, [[Armenians]], [[Muslims|Ishmaelites]], [[Hagarite]]s and other such as these were permitted from of old to dwell in Christian countries and cities, except that they had to live separately and not together with the Christians\".<ref name=\"Charnis76-7\">Charnis, pp. 76-7</ref> In Constantinople, there was a Jewish quarter near the eponymous gate in the modern [[Yenikap\u0131]] area.<ref>{{Harvnb|Majeska|1984|pp=267\u2013268}}</ref>\n\nBy the fourteenth century, the Jewish question of Byzantium seemed to be most concerned with [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] Jews. Venetians had come to reside in the Empire in large numbers by the early 14th century, and treaties between the Empire and Venice granted the Venetians living in the empire, including Jews of Venetian origin, special privileges, though they also carried certain minor economic prohibitions. Under the [[aegis]] of these treaties, Venetian Jews could buy, sell or rent land anywhere in Constantinople. They also enjoyed a more favorable tax structure than Byzantine citizens, as well as the freedom of movement and settlement anywhere in the Empire.<ref name=\"Bowman20-1\">Bowman, pp. 20-1</ref>\n\nFurther complicating this legal status, some Jews obtained Venetian citizenship either \"by coming from areas subject to the [[Republic of Venice|Republic]] or by purchasing naturalization\", thus obtaining the same privileges as Venetian nationals in the Empire.<ref name=\"Bowman23\">Bowman, p. 23</ref> At this time, the Empire was in rapid decay, and could not seriously enforce laws intended to curtail these rights and regain economic control within its borders. Thus, an exception to the general trend of Byzantine history emerged during this century, whereby Jews were entitled to a broader set of rights than Christians. However, it is important to note that these liberties were conferred based on their being Venetian, not based on their Jewish identity. Non-Venetian Jews did not profit from the Venetian-Byzantine treaties, and non-Jewish Venetians enjoyed the same liberties as their Jewish compatriots.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bowman, Steven.

R. M. \"Greek Jewish Texts from the Cairo Genizah\". 1996</ref> The legal standing of the Jews of the Byzantine Empire was unique during the entire history of the Empire; they did not belong to the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Eastern Orthodox]] faith, which was the [[State church of the Roman Empire|state religion]], nor were they\u2014in most circumstances\u2014grouped together with [[heresy|heretics]] and [[pagan]]s. They were placed in a legal position somewhere between the two worlds. The place along the spectrum of social freedom in which Byzantine Jews found themselves varied somewhat\u2014though far from drastically\u2014with time, and depended largely on three factors: the [[theology|theological]] desire of the state to maintain the Jews as a living testament to the victory of Christianity, the desire of the state to strengthen its control, and the ability of centralized rule from [[Constantinople]] to enforce its [[legislation]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Foundations of the legal position of Jews: 330\u2013404==\n\nIn 212, [[Caracalla]] bestowed [[Constitutio Antoniniana|citizenship]] on all its residents, including the Jews. This granted Jews [[legal equality]] to all other citizens, and formed the foundation of their legal status in Byzantium following the founding of Constantinople in 330.<ref name = \"Sharf20\">Sharf, p. 20</ref> Indeed, Jews enjoyed the right to practice their faith under the rule of the Byzantines, as long as they paid the [[Fiscus Judaicus]]. For example, [[circumcision]], which was considered [[mutilation]] and therefore [[death penalty|punishable by death]] if performed on a non-Jewish child, and by [[exile]] if performed on a non-Jewish adult, was legally permitted within Jewish religious practices. Byzantine law recognized [[synagogue]]s as places of worship, which could not be arbitrarily molested, Jewish courts had the force of law in [[civil case]]s, and Jews could not be forced to violate ''[[Shabbat]]'' and their [[Jewish festivals|festivals]].<ref name=\"Sharf20-1\">Sharf, pp. 20-1</ref>\n\nSince the year 390 nearly all of the territory of present-day Israel came under Byzantine suzerainty. The area was divided into the following provinces: [[Palestina Prima]], [[Palestina Secunda]] and [[Palestina Salutaris|Palestina Tertia]]. These provinces were part of the [[Diocese of the East]].<ref name = \"Lehmann\">{{cite web | url = http://www.usd.edu/~clehmann/erp/Palestine/history.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090811054625/http://www.usd.edu/~clehmann/erp/Palestine/history.htm | archivedate = 2009-08-11 <!-- 054625 --> | title = Palestine: History: 135\u2013337: Syria Palaestina and the Tetrarchy| accessdate = 2014-08-24| last = Lehmann| first = Clayton Miles|date=Summer 1998| work = The On-line Encyclopedia of the Roman Provinces| publisher = University of South Dakota}}</ref>\n\n==Theodosian Code: 404\u2013527==\n\nIn 404, Jews were excluded from certain governmental posts.<ref name=\"Sharf21\">Sharf, p. 21</ref> In 418, they were barred from the [[civil service]], and from all military positions.<ref name=\"Linder281\">Linder, p. 281</ref> In 425, they were excluded from all remaining public offices, both civilian and military\u2014a prohibition which [[Justinian I]] reiterated.<ref name=\"Sharf21\" /> Such restrictions, however, inevitably compromised the theological arguments for restricting the Jewish [[religion]]; although they empowered the Christian citizens of the empire at the expense of its Jews, all laws dealing with the Jews implicitly recognized the continued existence and legality of the Jewish religion.<ref name=\"Brewer135\">Brewer, p. 135</ref>\n\nThus Emperor [[Theodosius II]] found that he had to balance the first two of the three factors governing the treatment of Jews in the empire\u2014theology, political [[pragmatism]] and enforceability. He could not, however, effectively control the third. In 438, Theodosius had to reaffirm the prohibition on Jews holding public office, because it had been poorly enforced.<ref name=\"Brewer130\">Brewer, p. 130</ref> Even in 527, a decree which renewed this prohibition began by observing that \"heedless of the laws' command [they have] infiltrated public offices\".<ref name=\"Linder360\">Linder, p. 360</ref>\n\nThere was one office, however, that Jews were not forbidden from assuming. This was the office of [[decurion (administrative)|decurion]], a tax collector who was required to pay all deficits in [[revenue]] from his own pocket. Theodosius II, who laid out much of the legal [[precedent]] and foundation for Byzantine law in his [[Theodosian Code]], permitted Jews, like other citizens, to hire a substitute to perform the duties of decurion in their place.<ref name=\"Sharf21\">Sharf, p. 21</ref> Justinian, whose legal code included 33 laws relating to the Jews,<ref name=\"Brewer127\">Brewer, p. 127</ref> initially maintained this ability, but it was abolished in 537.<ref name=\"Sharf21\" /> Sharf explains that the purpose of this was so that the Jews \"never enjoy the fruits of office, but only suffer its pains and penalties\".<ref name=\"Sharf21\" />\n\nIn addition to the matter of holding public office, Jews were also unequal to Christians with respect to the ownership of [[slave]]s. Restrictions on the ownership of Christian slaves by Jews were in place through the reign of many emperors, under the fear that Jews would use conversion of slaves as a means to increase their number. Additionally, this was designed to provide an incentive for non-Christian slaves to convert into Christianity, and an economic restriction on the Jews. Restrictions on slave-owning could not, however, be excessively burdensome, because slaves, although numerous, were between 10-15% of the population.<ref>Slavery in the Late Ancient World, pp.&nbsp;55\u201360, Kyle Harper, 2011</ref> Under the Theodosian Code, therefore, ownership of Christian slaves by Jews was not prohibited, although their purchase was. Thus, one who gained possession of a slave by means such as inheritance would remain his or her owner. Purchase of slaves was usually penalized by compelled sale at the original purchase price.<ref name=\"Sharf22\">Sharf, p. 22</ref>\n\nSlave ownership produces another example of the threefold balancing act of Legislation dealing with the Jewish minority of Byzantium: ownership of Christian slaves undermined the \"living testament\" theology, but was a pragmatic requirement of the time, and the prohibition thereof could not be entirely enforced, since freedom may not necessarily have been a desirable option for a slave who was well-treated by his masters.<ref name=\"Fieldman394\">Fieldman, p. 394</ref>\n\nThe third important restriction on Judaism\u2014in addition to the limitations on public service and slave ownership\u2014was that the Jewish religion, though allowed to survive, was not allowed to thrive. Theologically, the victory of Christianity could be successfully asserted by maintaining a small contingent of Jews within the empire, although allowing them to become too sizable a minority would threaten the theological monopoly of [[Orthodox Christianity]] within the Empire.<ref name=\"Sharf22\" />\n\nOne important ramification of this policy was the prohibition on the construction of new synagogues within the Empire, though the repair of old synagogues was permitted. This prohibition was difficult to enforce, as archaeological evidence in Israel indicates that illegal synagogue construction continued throughout the sixth century.<ref name=\"Gray262-3\">Gray, pp. 262-3</ref> The synagogue did continue to be respected as an inviolable [[place of worship]] until the reign of Justinian.\n\nBeginning at this time, most legislation regarding the Jews\u2014even laws which expanded the rights which they were afforded\u2014were \"prefaced by unambiguous expressions of hatred and contempt for Judaism\".<ref name=\"Sharf23\" />\n\n==Justinian Code: 527\u2013565==\n\nThe [[Justinian Code|Civil Code]] of Justinian tightened the regulations on the ownership of Christian slaves by non-Christians. It abolished compensation for illegal purchases of Christian slaves, and added a 30&nbsp;lb gold fine for this offense. Jews owning Christian slaves during the time of Justinian could be punished by execution.<ref name=\"Sharf22\" />\n\nIn 545, Justinian legislated that the right of existence of any synagogue on land belonging to an [[Christian Church|ecclesiastical institution]] be nullified.<ref name=\"Sharf22\" /> He was also the first emperor to order that existing synagogues be converted into [[Church (building)|church]]es. There is, however, only one example of such a conversion taking place by force: the synagogue in [[Borem]]. This synagogue was most likely converted for military reasons, in light of its strategic position on the frontier with the territory of the Berber tribes.<ref name=\"Brewer131\" /> In fact, Justinian banned all non-Christian places of worship in [[Praetorian prefecture of Africa|northern Africa]], in legislation that grouped Jews with pagans and heretics. This legislation was hardly enforced, but set a precedent for the violability of synagogues and the blurring of the difference between Jews and other non-Christians.<ref name=\"Sharf26\">Sharf, p. 26</ref> Once more, this represents the divergence between the Empire's theological objectives, its pragmatic goals and its capability to enforce its legislation. The poor efficacy of legislation points to the dominating power of the latter in restraining the two former factors, which, in this case, coincided.\n\nThe Jews also found that they were positioned in law somewhere between other non-Christians and the Christian majority. For instance, Justinian demanded that [[Passover]] be shown as subservient to [[Easter]]; in cases in which the former would fall before the latter, the Jews were forbidden from celebrating it on its appointed day, and were compelled to delay it.<ref name=\"Sharf23\">Sharf, p. 23</ref> Jews were also forbidden from giving testimony concerning Christians in a [[court of law]]\u2014a restriction already present in the Theodosian code\u2014although Justinian eased this restriction in 537 to allow them to testify in cases between Christian individuals and the state. This privilege was not enjoyed by any other non-Christian group.<ref name=\"Brewer131\">Brewer, p. 131</ref> Once more, the state sacrificed the doctrinal subordination of the Jews in order to gain practical benefits, in this case testimony against those who faced it in court.\n\nQuestions of internal Jewish discourse\u2014which could, under the Theodosian Code, be arbitrated only by Jewish courts\u2014could, under the [[Justinian Code]], be officiated by the state,<ref name=\"Brewer132-3\">Brewer, pp. 132-3</ref> a power which Justinian did not shy away from utilizing. In 553 for instance, Justinian required that the public reading of the [[Pentateuch]] proceed in [[vernacular]], rather than [[Hebrew]], and forbade altogether the reading of the ''[[Mishna]]''.<ref name=\"Sharf24-5\">Sharf, pp. 24-5</ref> In this way, Justinian not only restricted the religious freedom of the Jews, but also expanded his own power in order to reinforce the principle that, \"in theory, there is no area that falls outside of the Empire's legislative power\".<ref name=\"Brewer135\">Brewer, p. 135</ref> Justinian's restrictions were, however, poorly enforced. Ironically, what little enforcement they did enjoy contributed to a notable growth in Jewish culture and [[liturgy]]. For instance, the banning of the reading of ''Mishna'' prompted Jewish scholars to write the ''[[piyutim]]'', important works of poetry which refer strongly to the ''Mishna''.

However, during the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]] many Jews sided against the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the [[Jewish revolt against Heraclius]], which successfully assisted the invading Persian Sassanids in conquering all of Roman Egypt and Syria.

These texts are the oldest known written texts in Modern Greek.<ref>Bremer, E. and R\u00f6hl, S. \"Language of Religion, Language of the People: Medieval Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, 2006</ref> Beside these Rabbanites and as a part of the Empire's Romaniote Jews, important [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] communities like the [[Constantinopolitan Karaites]] and the Karaites of [[Adrianople]] flourished and produced eminent personalities for the Karaite movement like [[Caleb Afendopolo]], [[Elijah Bashyazi]], [[Aaron ben Joseph of Constantinople]], [[Aaron ben Elijah]], [[Judah Hadassi]] and other.<ref>Z. Ankori, Karaites in Byzantium (New York, 1959)</ref>\n\nIn the twelfth century, there were about 2,500 Jews in [[Constantinople]], 2,000 Jews in [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and 500 Jews in [[Thessalonica]].

Although most crusading bands did not adopt a policy of violence or forced conversion against the Jews, the [[First Crusade]] certainly undertook an anti-Jewish face in certain communities. Because the Crusade was undertaken with the goal of \"subjugating all non-believers to the faith,\" many crusaders compelled Jews to convert on pain of death, and there is a large number of recorded cases of mass suicides within Jewish communities\u2014particularly among Jewish maidens\u2014in order to avoid such conversions.<ref name=\"Chazan10\">Chazan, pp. 10-1</ref>\n\n==Latin occupation: 1204\u20131261==\n{{further|Latin Empire|Latinokratia}}\n\nThe [[Fourth Crusade]] further degraded the position of Byzantine Jews. As smaller states separated from a weakened empire, the rulers of these states found themselves more capable of enforcing legislation than their Byzantine counterparts. The most powerful protection on the rights of Jews\u2014governmental impotence to enforce laws\u2014was thus abolished. [[Theodore Doukas]], who crowned himself emperor of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epiros]] after he conquered [[Thessalonica]], was known for his persecution of the Jews, which began in 1229, a year before the end of his reign.<ref name=\"Charnis75\" /> Theodore's disdain for the Jews is well-established. Still, his waiting until 1229\u2014five years after capturing Thessalonica and declaring himself emperor\u2014indicates that antisemitism may not have been the cause of his anti-Jewish edicts. Rather, they appear to have been motivated by a desire to confiscate Jewish property at a time when his empire was short of funds. This explains the expropriations of Jewish property under Theodore, as well as his regime's abstention from religious persecution for its own sake.<ref name=\"Bowman14\">Bowman, p. 14</ref>\n\n[[John Vatatzes]], the emperor of [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], commenced legal persecution of the Jews in 1253.<ref name=\"Charnis75\" /> Unlike Theodore, Vatatzes ordered that the Jews within the Empire of Nicaea be converted to Christianity, though he did not order the expropriation of Jewish property.<ref name=\"Bowman18\">Bowman, p. 18</ref> Although these measures began only a year before Vatatzes' death, they seemed to have set a precedent of persecution which his son, [[Theodore II Laskaris]], followed.<ref name=\"Charnis75\" />\n\nIt was in this environment of persecution that the [[Palaiologos|Palaiologoi]] rose to the imperial throne. [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] largely ended persecution of the Jews. Bowman writes the following:\n\n:Michael VIII summoned the Jewish leaders in his realm and invited them to support him as emperor. Thus Michael's first act toward the Jews [\u2026] was the revocation of John Vatatzes's order of forced baptism. At the same time, however, he made it clear to the Jews that he expected them to show their appreciation for his assistance.<ref name=\"Bowman18\" />\n\nMichael's road to the throne had been of questionable legality, and that fact earned him many enemies. Additionally, he oversaw an empire which was strongly dependent on foreign powers, and had an immense need for gold to fund its great military expenses. It is not surprising, therefore, that he turned to the Jews and other minorities (most notably the Armenians) as a source of support in an embattled state of affairs, and when the ethnic majority and the mainstream elite had grown unfriendly toward him.<ref name=\"Bowman19\">Bowman, p. 19</ref>\n\n==A decaying Empire: 1261\u20131453==\n{{further|Byzantium under the Palaiologoi|Romaniote Jews}}\n[[File:Jews Byzantine Greek Alexander Manuscript (cropped).JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Alexander the Great]], clad as a [[Byzantine emperor]], receives a delegation of Jewish [[rabbi]]s. Miniature from the 14th-century ''Alexander Romance'']]\n[[Andronikos II Palaiologos]] followed his father's precedent. The tolerance of Andronikos was quite notable, even drawing condemnation from [[Patriarch Athanasius III of Alexandria]], against what he saw as \"excessive\" tolerance of Jews and other non-Christians, in particular for permitting them to live amongst Christians.<ref name=\"Charnis75-6\">Charnis, pp. 75-6</ref> The patriarch's complaint indicates that, in spite of the tolerance of the Palaiologoi, the norm of imperial law was to require non-Christians to live separately from Christians. This apparent trend of segregation between the peoples of Byzantium, which certainly included the Jews, is confirmed in a letter by John, bishop of Citrus, in the latter half of the twelfth century, which declared that, \"People of alien tongues and alien beliefs, such as Jews, [[Armenians]], [[Muslims|Ishmaelites]], [[Hagarite]]s and other such as these were permitted from of old to dwell in Christian countries and cities, except that they had to live separately and not together with the Christians\".<ref name=\"Charnis76-7\">Charnis, pp. 76-7</ref> In Constantinople, there was a Jewish quarter near the eponymous gate in the modern [[Yenikap\u0131]] area.<ref>{{Harvnb|Majeska|1984|pp=267\u2013268}}</ref>\n\nBy the fourteenth century, the Jewish question of Byzantium seemed to be most concerned with [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] Jews. Venetians had come to reside in the Empire in large numbers by the early 14th century, and treaties between the Empire and Venice granted the Venetians living in the empire, including Jews of Venetian origin, special privileges, though they also carried certain minor economic prohibitions. Under the [[aegis]] of these treaties, Venetian Jews could buy, sell or rent land anywhere in Constantinople. They also enjoyed a more favorable tax structure than Byzantine citizens, as well as the freedom of movement and settlement anywhere in the Empire.<ref name=\"Bowman20-1\">Bowman, pp. 20-1</ref>\n\nFurther complicating this legal status, some Jews obtained Venetian citizenship either \"by coming from areas subject to the [[Republic of Venice|Republic]] or by purchasing naturalization\", thus obtaining the same privileges as Venetian nationals in the Empire.<ref name=\"Bowman23\">Bowman, p. 23</ref> At this time, the Empire was in rapid decay, and could not seriously enforce laws intended to curtail these rights and regain economic control within its borders. Thus, an exception to the general trend of Byzantine history emerged during this century, whereby Jews were entitled to a broader set of rights than Christians. However, it is important to note that these liberties were conferred based on their being Venetian, not based on their Jewish identity. Non-Venetian Jews did not profit from the Venetian-Byzantine treaties, and non-Jewish Venetians enjoyed the same liberties as their Jewish compatriots.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bowman, Steven.

{"title_page": "Tie-in", "text_new": "{{for|the meaning of the term in U.S. college football|Automatic bids to college bowl games}}\n\nA '''tie-in''' work is a work of fiction or other product based on a media property such as a [[film]], [[video game]], [[television series]], [[board game]], [[web site]], [[role-playing game]] or [[literary property]].  Tie-ins are authorized by the owners of the original property, and are a form of [[cross-promotion]] used primarily to generate additional income from that property and to promote its visibility.\n\n== Types ==\n[[File:Sacoche South Park.jpg|thumb|This pannier bag is a tie-in product from the [[Television program#Seasons/series|TV series]] ''[[South Park]]''.]]\nCommon tie-in products include literary works, which may be [[novelization]]s of a media property, original [[novel]]s or story collections inspired by the property, or republished previously existing books, such as the novels on which a media property was based, with artwork or photographs from the property. According to publishing industry estimates, about one or two percent of the audience of a film will buy its novelization, making these relatively inexpensively produced works a commercially attractive proposition in the case of [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] film franchises. Although increasingly also a domain of previously established novelists, tie-in writing has the disadvantages, from the writers' point of view, of modest pay, tight deadlines and no ownership in the intellectual property created.<ref name=\"NYT 4 January 2015\">{{cite news|last1=Alter|first1=Alexandra|title=Popular TV Series and Movies Maintain Relevance as Novels|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/05/business/media/popular-tv-series-and-movies-maintain-relevance-as-novels.html|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=The New York Times|date=4 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nTie-in products may also have a documentary or supplemental character, such  or \"making-of\" books documenting the creation of a media property. Tie-in products also include other types of works based on the media property, such as [[soundtrack]] recordings, video games or merchandise including toys and clothing.\n\n===Novelizations===\n{{main|Novelization}}\nA novelization is a derivative novel that adapts the story of a work created for another medium, such as a film, TV series, comic strip or video game. Film novelizations were particularly popular before the advent of home video, but continue to find commercial success as part of marketing campaigns for major films. They are often written by accomplished writers based on an early draft of the film's script and on a tight deadline.\n\n===Rebranding of previously published work===\nTie-in books are sometimes reprints of novels rebranded to tie in with their film adaptation. As an example, after [[Roderick Thorp]]'s 1979 novel ''[[Nothing Lasts Forever (1979 novel)|Nothing Lasts Forever]]'' was adapted into the 1988 movie ''[[Die Hard]]'', it was renamed as ''Die Hard'' with the film's poster on the cover. The [[Philip K. Dick]] novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' was similarly republished to tie in with ''[[Blade Runner]]'', the film loosely based on the book. \n\nA tie-in book linked to a film based on [[short fiction]] may be published featuring the adapted story as well as other stories from the same author. As an example, while [[Stephen King]]'s novella \"[[Apt Pupil]]\" was adapted to [[Apt Pupil (film)|the eponymous film]], King's collection ''[[Different Seasons]]'', which featured the story, was reprinted as ''Apt Pupil: A Novella in Different Seasons''. Similarly, novels were published to tie in with the films ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' and ''[[Paycheck (film)|Paycheck]]'', featuring Philip K. Dick's original short stories \"[[The Minority Report]]\" and \"[[Paycheck (short story)|Paycheck]]\" short stories. \n===Expanded Universen===\nTie-in works may also tell new stories in the form of [[sequel]]s, [[prequel]]s and other spin-offs, creating an [[Expanded Universe]] based on the original work. As an example, the many books, comics and video games set in the [[Star Wars expanded universe|an expanded universe]] based initially on the first ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy. In 2015, the ''[[New York Times]]'' noted the flourishing market for TV series tie-in novels, coinciding with the increasing cultural significance of quality television series. The increasing number of previously established novelists taking on tie-in works has also been credited with these works gaining a \"patina of respectability\" after having previously been disregarded in literary circles as derivative and mere merchandise.<ref name=\"NYT 4 January 2015\" />\n\n===Video games===\nSome [[video game]]s are tie-in licences for films, television shows or books.\n\nVideo game movie tie-ins are expensive for a [[video game developer|game developer]] to license, and the [[game designer]]s have to work within constraints imposed by the [[film studio]], under pressure to finish the game in time for the film's release.<ref name=\"fox\">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,277135,00.html|title=Review: Movie Tie-In Games Mostly Disappointing|work=foxnews.com | date=2007-06-01}}</ref> The aim for the publishers is to increase hype and revenue as the two industries effectively market one another's releases.<ref name=\"Canada\">{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/technology/games/story.html?id=2285e0f0-a77a-4536-bec8-6aca99027d7c&k=10775|title=Hollywood and video game industry profit from movie tie-ins|work=Canada.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106053417/http://www.canada.com/topics/technology/games/story.html?id=2285e0f0-a77a-4536-bec8-6aca99027d7c&k=10775|archivedate=2012-11-06}}</ref>\n\nMovie license video games have a reputation for being poor quality.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Amiga Power |date=May 1995 |author= Stuart Campbell |url= http://worldofstuart.excellentcontent.com/world/ap/movies.htm | title = Ready For Your Close-Up }}</ref> For example, ''[[Amiga Power]]'' awarding [[Psygnosis]]'s three movie licenses (''Dracula'', ''Cliffhanger'' and ''Last Action Hero'', all reviewed in June 1994) 36% ''in total''; that magazine being cynical towards licensed games in general, with ''[[The Blues Brothers (video game)|The Blues Brothers]]'' being one of few exceptions. One of the first movie tie-in games, Atari's ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982) was deemed so bad, it was cited as one cause of the video game industry crash.<ref name=\"washington\">{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/19/AR2006071901865.html |title=Movie and Game Studios Getting the Total Picture |accessdate=2007-11-01 |last=Musgrove |first=Mike |date=10 July 2006 |work= |publisher=washingtonpost.com}}</ref> Such poor quality is often due to game developers forced to rush the product in order to meet the movie's release date,<ref name=\"washington\" /> or due to issues with adapting the original work's plot into an interactive form, such as in the case of the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1 (video game)|games]] based on the last two films of the ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' film series, where one reviewer criticised some of the game's missions and side-quests as being unrelated to the film's storyline.<ref name=\"hp7review\">{{cite web|url= http://ps3.ign.com/articles/113/1134912p1.html |title= Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 Video Game Review - PlayStation 3 Review at IGN |work= [[IGN]]|accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nVideo tie-in licences for novels tend to be [[adventure games]]. ''[[The Hobbit (1982 video game)|The Hobbit]]'' (1982) and ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (video game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' are [[text adventure]]s, whilst ''[[I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream (video game)|I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream]]'' (1995) is a [[point-and-click adventure]] and ''[[Neuromancer (video game)|Neuromancer]]'' (1988) is a [[graphic adventure]]. Action games based on novels are less common (''[[William Shatner's TekWar]]'' (1995), a [[first-person shooter]]). Novel tie-ins were published less frequently after the 1990s, with developers only taking risks with stories that had already been licensed for movies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Why-Are-Books-Never-Made-Into-Games-6706.html|title=Why Are Books Never Made Into Games?|author=Rich Knight|date=2007-10-08|accessdate=2009-03-01|work=Blend Games}}</ref>\n\n== Revenue and structure ==\n\nTie-ins are considered an important part of the revenue-stream for any major media release, and planning, and licensing for such works often begins at the very earliest stages of creating such a property. Tie-ins provide both an important way of generating additional income from a property, and a way of satisfying the desires of fans who enthusiastically support a popular media property.\n\nThe lineage of tie-in works can be quite convoluted.  For example, a novelization might be done of a video game, which was based on a television show, based on a movie, based on a comic book which was the original media property.  In several cases, a novelization has been released based on a movie which was in turn adapted from an original novel.  In such cases, it is not uncommon to see the novelization and a movie release of the original novel side-by-side on the same shelf.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nThese tie-ins can be considered as forms of \"free advertising\", as they create more exposure for the media property. Tie-ins need not have a direct association with the property. For example, a particular pizza company can offer coupons that are associated with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies, but that specific pizza company itself does not necessarily have to appear in the movies. By this association, however, the pizza company is exposed to a bigger audience. If a media property does well, the tie-ins gain that positive exposure as well.<ref> Wasko, Janet, Mark Phillips, and Chris Purdie. 1993. \"Hollywood Meets Madison Avenue: The Commercialization of US Films\".

Although increasingly also a domain of previously established novelists, tie-in writing has the disadvantages, from the writers' point of view, of modest pay, tight deadlines and no ownership in the intellectual property created.<ref name=\"NYT 4 January 2015\">{{cite news|last1=Alter|first1=Alexandra|title=Popular TV Series and Movies Maintain Relevance as Novels|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/05/business/media/popular-tv-series-and-movies-maintain-relevance-as-novels.html|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=The New York Times|date=4 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nTie-in products may also have a documentary or supplemental character, such  or \"making-of\" books documenting the creation of a media property. Tie-in products also include other types of works based on the media property, such as [[soundtrack]] recordings, video games or merchandise including toys and clothing.\n\n===Novelizations===\n{{main|Novelization}}\nA novelization is a derivative novel that adapts the story of a work created for another medium, such as a film, TV series, comic strip or video game. Film novelizations were particularly popular before the advent of home video, but continue to find commercial success as part of marketing campaigns for major films. They are often written by accomplished writers based on an early draft of the film's script and on a tight deadline.\n\n===Rebranding of previously published work===\nTie-in books are sometimes reprints of novels rebranded to tie in with their film adaptation. As an example, after [[Roderick Thorp]]'s 1979 novel ''[[Nothing Lasts Forever (1979 novel)|Nothing Lasts Forever]]'' was adapted into the 1988 movie ''[[Die Hard]]'', it was renamed as ''Die Hard'' with the film's poster on the cover. The [[Philip K. Dick]] novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' was similarly republished to tie in with ''[[Blade Runner]]'', the film loosely based on the book. \n\nA tie-in book linked to a film based on [[short fiction]] may be published featuring the adapted story as well as other stories from the same author. As an example, while [[Stephen King]]'s novella \"[[Apt Pupil]]\" was adapted to [[Apt Pupil (film)|the eponymous film]], King's collection ''[[Different Seasons]]'', which featured the story, was reprinted as ''Apt Pupil: A Novella in Different Seasons''. Similarly, novels were published to tie in with the films ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' and ''[[Paycheck (film)|Paycheck]]'', featuring Philip K. Dick's original short stories \"[[The Minority Report]]\" and \"[[Paycheck (short story)|Paycheck]]\" short stories. \n===Expanded Universen===\nTie-in works may also tell new stories in the form of [[sequel]]s, [[prequel]]s and other spin-offs, creating an [[Expanded Universe]] based on the original work. As an example, the many books, comics and video games set in the [[Star Wars expanded universe|an expanded universe]] based initially on the first ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy. In 2015, the ''[[New York Times]]'' noted the flourishing market for TV series tie-in novels, coinciding with the increasing cultural significance of quality television series. The increasing number of previously established novelists taking on tie-in works has also been credited with these works gaining a \"patina of respectability\" after having previously been disregarded in literary circles as derivative and mere merchandise.<ref name=\"NYT 4 January 2015\" />\n\n===Video games===\nSome [[video game]]s are tie-in licences for films, television shows or books.\n\nVideo game movie tie-ins are expensive for a [[video game developer|game developer]] to license, and the [[game designer]]s have to work within constraints imposed by the [[film studio]], under pressure to finish the game in time for the film's release.<ref name=\"fox\">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,277135,00.html|title=Review: Movie Tie-In Games Mostly Disappointing|work=foxnews.com | date=2007-06-01}}</ref> The aim for the publishers is to increase hype and revenue as the two industries effectively market one another's releases.<ref name=\"Canada\">{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/technology/games/story.html?id=2285e0f0-a77a-4536-bec8-6aca99027d7c&k=10775|title=Hollywood and video game industry profit from movie tie-ins|work=Canada.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106053417/http://www.canada.com/topics/technology/games/story.html?id=2285e0f0-a77a-4536-bec8-6aca99027d7c&k=10775|archivedate=2012-11-06}}</ref>\n\nMovie license video games have a reputation for being poor quality.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Amiga Power |date=May 1995 |author= Stuart Campbell |url= http://worldofstuart.excellentcontent.com/world/ap/movies.htm | title = Ready For Your Close-Up }}</ref> For example, ''[[Amiga Power]]'' awarding [[Psygnosis]]'s three movie licenses (''Dracula'', ''Cliffhanger'' and ''Last Action Hero'', all reviewed in June 1994) 36% ''in total''; that magazine being cynical towards licensed games in general, with ''[[The Blues Brothers (video game)|The Blues Brothers]]'' being one of few exceptions. One of the first movie tie-in games, Atari's ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982) was deemed so bad, it was cited as one cause of the video game industry crash.<ref name=\"washington\">{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/19/AR2006071901865.html |title=Movie and Game Studios Getting the Total Picture |accessdate=2007-11-01 |last=Musgrove |first=Mike |date=10 July 2006 |work= |publisher=washingtonpost.com}}</ref> Such poor quality is often due to game developers forced to rush the product in order to meet the movie's release date,<ref name=\"washington\" /> or due to issues with adapting the original work's plot into an interactive form, such as in the case of the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1 (video game)|games]] based on the last two films of the ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' film series, where one reviewer criticised some of the game's missions and side-quests as being unrelated to the film's storyline.<ref name=\"hp7review\">{{cite web|url= http://ps3.ign.com/articles/113/1134912p1.html |title= Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 Video Game Review - PlayStation 3 Review at IGN |work= [[IGN]]|accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nVideo tie-in licences for novels tend to be [[adventure games]]. ''[[The Hobbit (1982 video game)|The Hobbit]]'' (1982) and ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (video game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' are [[text adventure]]s, whilst ''[[I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream (video game)|I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream]]'' (1995) is a [[point-and-click adventure]] and ''[[Neuromancer (video game)|Neuromancer]]'' (1988) is a [[graphic adventure]]. Action games based on novels are less common (''[[William Shatner's TekWar]]'' (1995), a [[first-person shooter]]). Novel tie-ins were published less frequently after the 1990s, with developers only taking risks with stories that had already been licensed for movies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Why-Are-Books-Never-Made-Into-Games-6706.html|title=Why Are Books Never Made Into Games?|author=Rich Knight|date=2007-10-08|accessdate=2009-03-01|work=Blend Games}}</ref>\n\n== Revenue and structure ==\n\nTie-ins are considered an important part of the revenue-stream for any major media release, and planning, and licensing for such works often begins at the very earliest stages of creating such a property. Tie-ins provide both an important way of generating additional income from a property, and a way of satisfying the desires of fans who enthusiastically support a popular media property.\n\nThe lineage of tie-in works can be quite convoluted.  For example, a novelization might be done of a video game, which was based on a television show, based on a movie, based on a comic book which was the original media property.  In several cases, a novelization has been released based on a movie which was in turn adapted from an original novel.  In such cases, it is not uncommon to see the novelization and a movie release of the original novel side-by-side on the same shelf.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nThese tie-ins can be considered as forms of \"free advertising\", as they create more exposure for the media property. Tie-ins need not have a direct association with the property. For example, a particular pizza company can offer coupons that are associated with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies, but that specific pizza company itself does not necessarily have to appear in the movies. By this association, however, the pizza company is exposed to a bigger audience. If a media property does well, the tie-ins gain that positive exposure as well.<ref> Wasko, Janet, Mark Phillips, and Chris Purdie. 1993. \"Hollywood Meets Madison Avenue: The Commercialization of US Films\".
