The church, facing the [[Via Giulia]], was built during the [[Italian Baroque|Baroque age]]. San Filippo was supposed to be demolished together with the surrounding neighborhood in the late 1930s, but due to the onset of WWII the demolition was halted. Abandoned and desecrated after the war, it has been restored in 2000, but maintains a secular usage and is not accessible.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Nolli 1748 San Filippo Neri in Via Giulia.JPG|thumb|left|San Filippo Neri (red arrow) and its Oratory (blue arrow) in their original context in the map of Rome of [[Giambattista Nolli]] (1748)]]\nThe church is located in [[Rome]]'s [[Regola]] [[rioni of Rome|rione]], about halfway down [[Via Giulia]] (at the n. 134B), its facade facing west-southwest, in a neighborhood still devastated by the demolitions of the 1930s.\n\n==Denominations==\nThe church, originally dedicated to [[Saint Trophimus]], was then dedicated to Philip Neri and, because of its tiny area, nicknamed by the roman populace \"San Filippino\" (\"Little Saint Philip\").<ref name=arm422/>\n\n==History==\nThe church was erected in 1623 (or, according to another source, in 1603)<ref name=bu705/> along [[via Giulia]].<ref name=pie7916>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 16</ref> The building's client was Rutilio Brandi, a [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscan]] glove maker native of [[San Gimignano]].<ref name=pie7916/> Brandi was ''penitente'' of [[Philip Neri]] and  ''Governatore'' of the \"Compagnia delle Santissime Piaghe di Ges\u00f9\" (\"Company of the most holy wounds of [[Jesus]]\"), an institute founded in 1617 and whose members were Florentines living in Rome.<ref name=pie7916/><ref name=arm422>Armellini (1891), p. 422</ref> Since he was ill with [[gout]], Brandi had the church [[dedication|dedicated]] to [[Saint Trophimus]], the protector of the gouties.<ref name=pie7916/> Moreover, in the building which embeds the church Brandi founded two charitable works: a little hospital for priests, and an institute for poor girls, dedicated to Philip Neri.<ref name=pie7918/><ref name=arm422/><ref name=del476>Delli (1988), p. 476</ref> Because of that, the shrine's dedication changed with time to [[San Filippo Neri]], the \"apostle of Rome\".<ref name=pie7916/><ref name=arm422/>\n\nIn 1728 the church was restored by [[Filippo Raguzzini]] on behalf of [[Pope Benedict XIII]] (r. 1724-1730); the main work was the new facade, erected between May and October 1728 with a total expense of 500 ''[[Italian scudo|scudi]]''.<ref name=pie7916/> The church facade was demolished again and rebuilt between 1767 and 1768 according to a project of [[Giovanni Francesco Fiori]], in an [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] style between [[Roman Baroque|Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassic]].<ref name=dbi>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giovanni-francesco-fiori_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=Fiori, Giovanni Francesco|encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani |first=Tommaso|last=Manfredi|volume=48 |year=1997|language=it}}</ref>\n\nIn 1797, when the French because of the [[treaty of Tolentino]] pretended a large amount of money from the Pope, San Filippo was the only church in Rome to keep its silver [[reliquary]], since the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the church refused to give it to [[Pius VI]] (r. 1775-1799).<ref name=del476/><ref name=arm422/>\n\nSince it is only about 100 metres from the [[Tiber]], the church was severely damaged during a flood in 1853,<ref name=bu705/> and due to that was restored under [[Pope Pius IX]] (r. 1846-1878) in the same year.<ref name=pie7916/>\n\nAs part of the demolition works ordered by [[Benito Mussolini]] <ref name=bu705/> in 1938 for the construction of a wide avenue between [[Ponte Mazzini]] and the [[Santa Maria in Vallicella|Chiesa Nuova]],<ref>Mazzotta (2014), pp. 185-187</ref> almost all the buildings around the church were demolished, and the church itself, desecrated, was spared only because of the stop of the project due to the beginning of WWII.<ref name=pie7916/> After that, the works of art disappeared into hitherto unknown hands or are completely lost.<ref name=bu705/> The building then fell into disrepair:<ref name=bu705/> it served as a wood storage <ref name=bu705/> and as a deposit for the fruit and vegetables street market of nearby ''vicolo della Moretta''.

Abandoned and desecrated after the war, it has been restored in 2000, but maintains a secular usage and is not accessible.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Nolli 1748 San Filippo Neri in Via Giulia.JPG|thumb|left|San Filippo Neri (red arrow) and its Oratory (blue arrow) in their original context in the map of Rome of [[Giambattista Nolli]] (1748)]]\nThe church is located in [[Rome]]'s [[Regola]] [[rioni of Rome|rione]], about halfway down [[Via Giulia]] (at the n. 134B), its facade facing west-southwest, in a neighborhood still devastated by the demolitions of the 1930s.\n\n==Denominations==\nThe church, originally dedicated to [[Saint Trophimus]], was then dedicated to Philip Neri and, because of its tiny area, nicknamed by the roman populace \"San Filippino\" (\"Little Saint Philip\").<ref name=arm422/>\n\n==History==\nThe church was erected in 1623 (or, according to another source, in 1603)<ref name=bu705/> along [[via Giulia]].<ref name=pie7916>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 16</ref> The building's client was Rutilio Brandi, a [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscan]] glove maker native of [[San Gimignano]].<ref name=pie7916/> Brandi was ''penitente'' of [[Philip Neri]] and  ''Governatore'' of the \"Compagnia delle Santissime Piaghe di Ges\u00f9\" (\"Company of the most holy wounds of [[Jesus]]\"), an institute founded in 1617 and whose members were Florentines living in Rome.<ref name=pie7916/><ref name=arm422>Armellini (1891), p. 422</ref> Since he was ill with [[gout]], Brandi had the church [[dedication|dedicated]] to [[Saint Trophimus]], the protector of the gouties.<ref name=pie7916/> Moreover, in the building which embeds the church Brandi founded two charitable works: a little hospital for priests, and an institute for poor girls, dedicated to Philip Neri.<ref name=pie7918/><ref name=arm422/><ref name=del476>Delli (1988), p. 476</ref> Because of that, the shrine's dedication changed with time to [[San Filippo Neri]], the \"apostle of Rome\".<ref name=pie7916/><ref name=arm422/>\n\nIn 1728 the church was restored by [[Filippo Raguzzini]] on behalf of [[Pope Benedict XIII]] (r. 1724-1730); the main work was the new facade, erected between May and October 1728 with a total expense of 500 ''[[Italian scudo|scudi]]''.<ref name=pie7916/> The church facade was demolished again and rebuilt between 1767 and 1768 with a project of [[Giovanni Francesco Fiori]], in an [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] style between [[Roman Baroque|Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassic]].<ref name=dbi>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giovanni-francesco-fiori_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=Fiori, Giovanni Francesco|encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani |first=Tommaso|last=Manfredi|volume=48 |year=1997|language=it}}</ref>\n\nIn 1797, when the French because of the [[treaty of Tolentino]] pretended a large amount of money from the Pope, San Filippo was the only church in Rome to keep its silver [[reliquary]], since the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the church refused to give it to [[Pius VI]] (r. 1775-1799).<ref name=del476/><ref name=arm422/>\n\nSince it is only about 100 metres from the [[Tiber]], the church was severely damaged during a flood in 1853,<ref name=bu705/> and due to that was restored under [[Pope Pius IX]] (r. 1846-1878) in the same year.<ref name=pie7916/>\n\nAs part of the demolition works ordered by [[Benito Mussolini]] <ref name=bu705/> in 1938 for the construction of a wide avenue between [[Ponte Mazzini]] and the [[Santa Maria in Vallicella|Chiesa Nuova]],<ref>Mazzotta (2014), pp. 185-187</ref> almost all the buildings around the church were demolished, and the church itself, desecrated, was spared only because of the stop of the project due to the beginning of WWII.<ref name=pie7916/> After that, the works of art disappeared into hitherto unknown hands or are completely lost.<ref name=bu705/> The building then fell into disrepair:<ref name=bu705/> it served as a wood storage <ref name=bu705/> and as a deposit for the fruit and vegetables street market of nearby ''vicolo della Moretta''.

While acutely ill, metabolic changes may produce a number of biological findings in people with anorexia that are not necessarily causative of the anorexic behavior. For example, abnormal hormonal responses to challenges with serotonergic agents have been observed during acute illness, but not recovery. Nevertheless, increased [[cerebrospinal fluid]] concentrations of [[5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid]] (a metabolite of serotonin), and changes in anorectic behavior in response to [[tryptophan]] depletion(a metabolic precursor to serotonin) support a role in anorexia. The binding potential of [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors]] and [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors]] have been reportedly decreased and increased respectively in a number of cortical regions. While these findings may be confounded by comorbid psychiatric disorders, taken as a whole they indicate serotonin in anorexia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kaye|first1=WH|last2=Frank|first2=GK|last3=Bailer|first3=UF|last4=Henry|first4=SE|last5=Meltzer|first5=CC|last6=Price|first6=JC|last7=Mathis|first7=CA|last8=Wagner|first8=A|title=Serotonin alterations in anorexia and bulimia nervosa: new insights from imaging studies.|journal=Physiology & Behavior|date=19 May 2005|volume=85|issue=1|pages=73\u201381|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2005.04.013|pmid=15869768}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kaye|first1=WH|last2=Bailer|first2=UF|last3=Frank|first3=GK|last4=Wagner|first4=A|last5=Henry|first5=SE|title=Brain imaging of serotonin after recovery from anorexia and bulimia nervosa.|journal=Physiology & Behavior|date=15 September 2005|volume=86|issue=1\u20132|pages=15\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2005.06.019|pmid=16102788}}</ref> These alterations in serotonin have been linked to traits characteristic of anorexia such as obsessiveness, anxiety, and appetite dysregulation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kaye|first1=W|title=Neurobiology of anorexia and bulimia nervosa.|journal=Physiology & Behavior|date=22 April 2008|volume=94|issue=1|pages=121\u201335|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2007.11.037|pmid=18164737|pmc=2601682}}</ref>\n\nNeuroimaging studies investigating the functional connectivity between brain regions have observed a number of alterations in networks related to cognitive control, introspection, and sensory function.

It is thought that RFS, with falling phosphate and potassium levels,  is more likely to occur when BMI is very low, and when medical comorbidities such as infection or cardiac failure, are present.  In those circumstances, it is recommended to start refeeding slowly but to build up rapidly as long as RFS does not occur.

Symptoms include lightheadedness upon standing, weakness, and cognitive impairment, and may result in [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting]] or near-fainting.<ref name=\"pmid26710932\"/> Orthostasis in anorexia nervosa indicates worsening cardiac function and may indicate a need for hospitalization.<ref name=\"pmid26710932\"/>  Hypotension and orthostasis generally resolve upon recovery to a normal weight. The weight loss in anorexia nervosa also causes [[atrophy]] of cardiac muscle. This leads to decreased [[cardiac output|ability to pump blood]], a reduction in the ability to sustain exercise, a diminished ability to increase blood pressure in response to exercise, and a subjective feeling of fatigue.<ref name=\"pmid3335466\"/>\n\nSome individuals may also have a decrease in cardiac contractility. Cardiac complications can be life-threatening, but the heart muscle generally improves with weight gain, and the heart normalizes in size over weeks to months, with recovery.<ref name=\"pmid3335466\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Goldberg SJ, Comerci GD, Feldman L |title=Cardiac output and regional myocardial contraction in anorexia nervosa |journal=J Adolesc Health Care |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=15\u201321 |year=1988 |pmid=3335466 |doi= 10.1016/0197-0070(88)90013-7|url=}}</ref> Atrophy of the [[myocardium|heart muscle]] is a marker of the severity of the disease, and while it is reversible with treatment and refeeding, it is possible that it may cause permanent, microscopic changes to the heart muscle that increase the risk of sudden cardiac death.<ref name=\"pmid26710932\"/> Individuals with anorexia nervosa may experience chest pain or [[palpitations]]; these can be a result of mitral valve prolapse.

While acutely ill, metabolic changes may produce a number of biological findings in people with anorexia that are not necessarily causative of the anorexic behavior. For example, abnormal hormonal responses to challenges with serotonergic agents have been observed during acute illness, but not recovery. Nevertheless, increased [[cerebrospinal fluid]] concentrations of [[5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid]] (a metabolite of serotonin), and changes in anorectic behavior in response to [[tryptophan]] depletion(a metabolic precursor to serotonin) support a role in anorexia. The binding potential of [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors]] and [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors]] have been reportedly decreased and increased respectively in a number of cortical regions. While these findings may be confounded by comorbid psychiatric disorders, taken as a whole they indicate serotonin in anorexia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kaye|first1=WH|last2=Frank|first2=GK|last3=Bailer|first3=UF|last4=Henry|first4=SE|last5=Meltzer|first5=CC|last6=Price|first6=JC|last7=Mathis|first7=CA|last8=Wagner|first8=A|title=Serotonin alterations in anorexia and bulimia nervosa: new insights from imaging studies.|journal=Physiology & Behavior|date=19 May 2005|volume=85|issue=1|pages=73\u201381|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2005.04.013|pmid=15869768}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kaye|first1=WH|last2=Bailer|first2=UF|last3=Frank|first3=GK|last4=Wagner|first4=A|last5=Henry|first5=SE|title=Brain imaging of serotonin after recovery from anorexia and bulimia nervosa.|journal=Physiology & Behavior|date=15 September 2005|volume=86|issue=1\u20132|pages=15\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2005.06.019|pmid=16102788}}</ref> These alterations in serotonin have been linked to traits characteristic of anorexia such as obsessiveness, anxiety, and appetite dysregulation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kaye|first1=W|title=Neurobiology of anorexia and bulimia nervosa.|journal=Physiology & Behavior|date=22 April 2008|volume=94|issue=1|pages=121\u201335|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2007.11.037|pmid=18164737|pmc=2601682}}</ref>\n\nNeuroimaging studies investigating the functional connectivity between brain regions have observed a number of alterations in networks related to cognitive control, introspection, and sensory function.

It is thought that RFS, with falling phosphate and potassium levels,  is more likely to occur when BMI is very low, and when medical comorbidities such as infection or cardiac failure, are present.  In those circumstances, it is recommended to start refeeding slowly but to build up rapidly as long as RFS does not occur.  Recommendations on energy requirements vary, from 5\u201310 kcal/kg/day in the most medically compromised patients, who appear to have the highest risk of RFS, to 1900 kcal/day.<ref>O'Connor, G. and D.

In such cases, provided that growth potential is preserved, height increase can resume and reach full potential after normal intake is resumed.{{mcn|date=March 2015}} Height potential is normally preserved if the duration and severity of illness are not significant or if the illness is accompanied by delayed bone age (especially prior to a bone age of approximately 15 years), as [[hypogonadism]] may partially counteract the effects of undernutrition on height by allowing for a longer duration of growth compared to controls.{{mcn|date=March 2015}} Appropriate early treatment can preserve height potential, and may even help to increase it in some post-anorexic subjects, due to factors such as long-term reduced estrogen-producing [[adipose tissue]] levels compared to premorbid levels.{{mcn|date=March 2015}} In some cases, especially where onset is before puberty, complications such as stunted growth and pubertal delay are usually reversible.<ref name=\"CG9FullGuideline\">{{cite journal |journal=National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health |year=2004 |title=Core interventions in the treatment and management of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and related eating disorders |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG9FullGuideline.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327055429/http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG9FullGuideline.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAnorexia nervosa causes alterations in the female reproductive system; significant weight loss, as well as psychological stress and intense exercise, typically results in a [[secondary amenorrhea|cessation of menstruation]] in women who are past puberty.

The weight loss in anorexia nervosa also causes [[atrophy]] of cardiac muscle. This leads to decreased [[cardiac output|ability to pump blood]], a reduction in the ability to sustain exercise, a diminished ability to increase blood pressure in response to exercise, and a subjective feeling of fatigue.<ref name=\"pmid3335466\"/>\n\nSome individuals may also have a decrease in cardiac contractility. Cardiac complications can be life-threatening, but the heart muscle generally improves with weight gain, and the heart normalizes in size over weeks to months, with recovery.<ref name=\"pmid3335466\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Goldberg SJ, Comerci GD, Feldman L |title=Cardiac output and regional myocardial contraction in anorexia nervosa |journal=J Adolesc Health Care |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=15\u201321 |year=1988 |pmid=3335466 |doi= 10.1016/0197-0070(88)90013-7|url=}}</ref> Atrophy of the [[myocardium|heart muscle]] is a marker of the severity of the disease, and while it is reversible with treatment and refeeding, it is possible that it may cause permanent, microscopic changes to the heart muscle that increase the risk of sudden cardiac death.<ref name=\"pmid26710932\"/> Individuals with anorexia nervosa may experience chest pain or [[palpitations]]; these can be a result of mitral valve prolapse. Mitral valve prolapse occurs because the size of the heart muscle decreases while the tissue of the [[mitral valve]] remains the same size.
