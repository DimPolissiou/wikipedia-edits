Prominent former members include [[Darren Emerson]], from 1991 to 2001, and Darren Price, as part of the live band from 2005 to 2016.\n\nAfter initial [[incarnation]] as a [[funk]] and [[synth-pop]] band, resulting in two albums between 1988 and 1989, Underworld gained prominence, after reshaping in 1993, into the [[progressive house]] and [[techno]] act, and releasing seven subsequent albums, including critically acclaimed ''[[Dubnobasswithmyheadman]]'' (1994), ''[[Second Toughest in the Infants]]'' (1996), and the signature 1996 single \"[[Born Slippy .NUXX]]\". Known for visual style and dynamic live performances, Underworld have influenced a wide range of artists and been featured in soundtracks and scores for films, television, and the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early years ===\nHyde and Smith began their musical partnership in Cardiff in 1979 with the [[Kraftwerk]] and [[reggae]]-inspired sounds of The Screen Gemz.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hugh|first1=Montgomery|title=How We Met: Rick Smith &amp; Karl Hyde|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/how-we-met-rick-smith-amp-karl-hyde-2130458.html|website=[[The Independent (UK)]]|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Dorian|first1=Lynskey|title=Underworld's Dubnobass ... 20 years on|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/09/karl-hyde-rick-smith-underworld-1994-album-dubnobasswithmyheadman|website=[[The Guardian (UK)]]|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref> They were joined by The Screen Gemz' [[Bass guitar|bass]] player Alfie Thomas, [[drum]]mer Bryn Burrows, and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboardist]] John Warwicker in forming a proto-[[electroclash]]/[[New wave music|new wave]] band whose name was a graphic squiggle, which was subsequently given the pronunciation [[Freur]]. The band signed to [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]], released 1983's ''[[Doot-Doot]]'', and disbanded in 1986 after followup ''[[Get Us out of Here]]'' was withheld.<ref>{{cite web|title=Freur |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/freur-mn0000987643/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, Hyde, Smith, Thomas, Burrows and bass player Baz Allen formed a band under the name Underworld (named after a [[Underworld (1985 film)|Clive Barker-scripted film]] which was scored by Freur),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/09/karl-hyde-rick-smith-underworld-1994-album-dubnobasswithmyheadman |title=Underworld's Dubnobass ... 20 years on |last1=Lynskey |first1=Dorian |date=9 October 2014 |website=[[Theguardian.com]]|accessdate=9 October 2014}}</ref> which tried a more guitar-orientated [[funk]]y [[electropop]] sound. The band signed to [[Sire Records]] and released the album ''[[Underneath the Radar]]'' in 1988 and, following the departure of Burrows, the album ''[[Change the Weather]]'' in 1989. This version of the band disbanded in 1990 and is supposedly regarded as a separate entity by the band's members to the one which would go on to release ''Dubnobasswithmyheadman'' (this album is therefore frequently referred to as being a debut). The Underworld of the ''Underneath the Radar'' and ''Change the Weather'' period is sometimes also referred to as being \"Underworld Mk1\".\n\n=== Underworld Mk2 ===\n{{Listen\n|filename=Underworld Rez.ogg\n|title=\"Rez\"\n|description=The band's 1993 dance anthem, \"Rez\".\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nAfter a break\u2014to concentrate on, among other things, art/design project [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]]\u2014Hyde and Smith recruited DJ [[Darren Emerson]] and after several minor releases and remixes as Lemon Inter<!--This is the intentional spelling of the band name with one 'r'-->upt and Steppin' Razor readopted the Underworld moniker. They produced danceable [[techno]] as a trio (\"Underworld Mk2\").\n\nThe addition of Emerson completed Underworld's techno/rock fusion and seemed to eliminate the pop elements in the original duo's work. Their first album, ''[[Dubnobasswithmyheadman]]'', was considered more accessible than the group's earlier material and crossed a large spectrum of dance music. The signature Hyde lyrics were in place: poetic, hypnotic and whispered; mixing conventional song writing with the use of [[Found art|found material]] from overheard conversations, answering machine recordings and the like. Hyde had been the lead singer in Underworld Mk1 but the original Hyde/Smith dance material was lyric-free as was most of the electronic music emerging from the aftermath of [[acid house]].\n\n=== The ''Trainspotting'' breakthrough ===\nThe band's 1996 album, ''[[Second Toughest in the Infants]]'', was their second studio album with Emerson and achieved a degree of commercial success, due in part to its release coinciding with that of the film ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''. The film featured \"Dark & Long (Dark Train)\", as well as the band's most commercially successful track to date, \"[[Born Slippy.NUXX]]\", which was originally released only as a B-side of a single and does not appear on the ''Second Toughest'' album. The single and the album showed Underworld maturing as a trio, mixing elements of [[techno]], [[House music|house]], [[drum and bass]] and [[experimental music]]. \n\"Born Slippy.NUXX\" is one of Underworld's best-known tracks and is celebrated as one of the greatest dance tracks of the decade. It was originally released in 1995 as a B-side to \"[[Born Slippy]]\" but failed to catch on until it was included in ''Trainspotting''. The track has since sold over a million copies and appeared on countless [[Compilation album|compilations]], [[Mashup (music)|mashups]] and [[remix]]es.\n\n=== ''Beaucoup Fish'' era ===\nAfter the release of fifth studio album ''[[Beaucoup Fish]]'' in 1999, Hyde declared in his interviews that he had sorted out earlier problems with [[alcoholism]] but all the members admitted that the sessions had been fraught with problems, with the individual members working in their own studios and only communicating via mixes of the raw material passed back and forth on [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]]. After the release of the album a large number of mixes of the album tracks seemed to surface on singles, magazine promotional CDs and similar ephemeral formats perhaps indicating the number of revisions the tracks had gone through to get to the point where they were acceptable to all three. The album's name derives from a sample of a Cajun fisherman in Louisiana on the track \"[[Jumbo (song)|Jumbo]]\". The band originally wanted to call the album ''Tonight, Matthew, I'm going to be Underworld'' (a catchphrase used by contestants on the UK [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] programme [[Stars in Their Eyes]]) but were convinced by their record company, [[Junior Boy's Own]], that the name would not be easily understood outside the UK. Finally, after all the singles had been released, a box set, ''[[Beaucoup Fish Singles]]'', which was a retrospective of all 4 singles came out.\n\nUnderworld embarked on a well-received tour in 1999, which resulted in a live CD and DVD drawn from several dates on the tour. Called ''[[Everything, Everything (album)|Everything, Everything]]'', the project captured the live Underworld experience very faithfully. A companion DVD was released separately soon after the album's release. The DVD features live footage of the band mixed with videography and artistic effects by the design group [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]]. The DVD also features several songs not on the album: \"Moaner\", \"Puppies\", \"Kittens\" and \"Rowla\". The disco scene in ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'' features Underworld's 1993 hit \"Rez\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259711/soundtrack|title=Vanilla Sky (2001) |website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Back to a duo ===\nAfter the release and promotion of ''Everything, Everything'', Emerson decided to leave Underworld to focus on his solo projects and record label. Hyde and Smith decided to continue as a duo. They recorded a new album, ''[[A Hundred Days Off]]'', released to general approval. Despite its status as the band's first studio album since Emerson's departure, its general sound and feel was, perhaps surprisingly for many Underworld fans, not dissimilar to the previous albums on which Emerson had had input. In 2003, a 2-disc anthology entitled ''1992\u20132002'' was released. This was the first appearance on an album of previously unavailable single tracks and B-sides, such as \"Bigmouth\", \"[[Spikee]]\", \"Dirty\" and \"8 Ball\". While touring in the summer and autumn of 2005, the duo was joined on stage by Darren Price, a DJ and producer who had remixed Underworld releases in the past.\n\nDuring their tour, they released a 3-CD set ''[[Live in Tokyo 25th November 2005|Live in Tokyo]]'', which was sold after the concert in Japan and later sold online. In late 2005, they released two compilations of new songs with accompanying photographs on Underworld Live, in a series entitled ''[[Riverrun (Underworld project)|Riverrun]]''. These were only released online, with no physical release (except for a promo CD). On 5 June 2006, they released their third installment, and on 10 July 2006, they released ''The Misterons Mix'', a special retrospective mix composed of ''Riverrun'' tracks, as an exclusive free download for customers that had purchased all three ''Riverrun'' releases.\n\nIn September 2006, Underworld released five limited edition (10,000 copies each) [[12\"]] vinyl releases, containing remixes of various ''Riverrun'' tracks. These tracks were also made available for purchase by digital download on the [[Beatport]] website. Later in 2006, the band teamed up with [[Gabriel Yared]] to compose the music score to [[Anthony Minghella]]'s film ''[[Breaking and Entering (film)|Breaking and Entering]]''. [[Breaking and Entering (soundtrack)|The soundtrack]] was released in the UK on 6 November, and in the USA on 5 December.\n\n=== ''Oblivion with Bells''===\n[[File:Underworldlivenewyork2007 crop.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Underworld performing \"[[Jumbo (song)|Jumbo]]\" in [[Central Park]], [[New York City]], 2007.]]\nUnderworld's seventh studio album, ''[[Oblivion with Bells]]'', was released on 16 October 2007.

Approximately 30 masked Greek anarchists stormed the stadium while the [[Beastie Boys]] were performing. Rick Smith was one of the people injured in the ensuing violence and he was taken to a nearby Athens hospital for treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-inside.com/underworld-dj-injured-in-riot-r157510.htm|title=UNDERWORLD DJ INJURED IN RIOT|accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref> On 19 October 2007, Underworld cancelled the remaining dates of their European tour due to illness in the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26653_0_2_0_C|title=Underworld cancel tour after severe illness member|accessdate=24 October 2007}}</ref> The tour was picked up again on 28 January 2008, with a concert in Cologne, followed by 16 dates in Europe, including some festivals.\n\nOn 8 August 2008, Underworld appeared at the [[All Points West Music & Arts Festival]] in [[Liberty State Park]], New Jersey. [[Radiohead]] dedicated their final song \"[[Everything in its Right Place]]\" to Underworld with a special remix. Karl Hyde appeared with [[Brian Eno]] on the final day of the Eno-curated Luminous Festival at Sydney Opera House. \"Pure Scenius\" consisted of three live improvised performances on the same day, featuring Eno, Hyde, Australian improv trio [[The Necks]], electronic artist [[Jon Hopkins]] and guitarist [[Leo Abrahams]].\n\nUnderworld has released two new series via their underworldlive.com site, in mp3 and WAV formats. The tracks are 020202, and the phonestrap/autotrader series. On 3 July 2009, Underworld debuted a new song tentatively titled \"Between Stars\" at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. Shortly before that, a post was made on the band's diary page showing a piece of paper with the song's first verse on it. On 8 August 2009, a show at Los Angeles' Forum was cancelled in circumstances similar to those that led to the group cancelling the show in Athens two years prior. Some of the crowd were climbing down the seats and onto the main floor, a potential safety hazard. The group apologized on their website for having the show called off.\n\nOn 8 March 2010 [[Mark Knight (musician)|Mark Knight]] and [[D. Ramirez]] released the single \"Downpipe\", which featured vocal contributions from Underworld's Karl Hyde. The song, released on Mark Knight's Toolroom Records label, has a music video featuring the \"Playhouse\", a lighting setup on Liberty Hall, the tallest building in [[Dublin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbghaUtVfJg|title=Downpipe music video|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=24 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n===''Barking''===\nOn 13 May 2010, the band released a track called \"Scribble\" for download on the band's site. The track shares elements with \"[[Live in Tokyo 25th November 2005|You Do Scribble]]\", an unreleased song which they featured many times since 2005 in their live performance shows. The track is a collaboration with [[High Contrast]], a [[drum and bass]] [[DJ]] also from Cardiff. On 14 May, the full version of \"Scribble\" was featured on [[Pete Tong]]'s [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] radio show, declaring it as [[Essential Selection|Essential New Tune]] of the week.<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC Radio 1 \u2013 Pete Tong |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ww0v |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822183839/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ww0v |archivedate=22 August 2015 }}</ref> The group also released a video clip for \"Scribble\" on [[YouTube]].

The album was available from the band's website and was packaged with the exhibition catalogue. In December 2010 it was announced that Underworld would reunite with ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'' director Danny Boyle to write the musical score for his production of [[Frankenstein (2011 play)|Frankenstein]] at the [[Royal National Theatre]]. The production was broadcast as a part of [[National Theatre Live]] on 17 March 2011, with a soundtrack release on Underworld's website in March 2011. In February 2011 Underworld confirmed that they would play a huge London summer show on Saturday 27 August on Clapham Common as headliners of South West Four.\n\n=== ''Anthology,'' the Olympics and solo projects ===\nIn November 2011, Underworld announced two new compilations, ''A Collection'' and ''1992\u20132012 Anthology''. ''A Collection'' features many of the band's biggest tracks alongside recent collaborations with High Contrast featuring [[Ti\u00ebsto]] & Underworld (\"The First Note Is Silent\"), Mark Knight & D. Ramirez (\"Downpipe\") and [[Brian Eno]] (\"Beebop Hurry\"). ''1992\u20132012 Anthology'' is a 3-disc set and is a refreshed and revisited version of ''1992\u20132002'' with more material, unreleased tracks and rarities to go some way to completing the picture of the first two decades of Underworld.\n\nIn December 2011, Underworld were chosen to direct the music for the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], reprising their partnership with filmmaker and ceremony director [[Danny Boyle]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hanna |first=Laurie |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/music/2011/12/07/underworld-to-create-london-2012-opening-ceremony-music-115875-23616597/ |title=Underworld to create London 2012 opening ceremony music \u2013 Mirror Online |website=Mirror.co.uk |date=7 December 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> The band also contributed two original tracks for the opening ceremony: \"[[And I Will Kiss]]\" (ft.

Prominent former members include [[Darren Emerson]], from 1991 to 2001, and Darren Price, as part of the live band from 2005 to 2016.\n\nAfter initial [[incarnation]] as a [[funk]] and [[synth-pop]] band, resulting in two albums between 1988 and 1989, Underworld gained prominence, after reshaping in 1993, into the [[progressive house]] and [[techno]] act, and releasing seven subsequent albums, including critically acclaimed ''[[Dubnobasswithmyheadman]]'' (1994), ''[[Second Toughest in the Infants]]'' (1996), and the signature 1996 single \"[[Born Slippy .NUXX]]\". Known for visual style and dynamic live performances, Underworld have influenced a wide range of artists and been featured in soundtracks and scores for films, television, and the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early years ===\nHyde and Smith began their musical partnership in Cardiff in 1979 with the [[Kraftwerk]] and [[reggae]]-inspired sounds of The Screen Gemz.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hugh|first1=Montgomery|title=How We Met: Rick Smith &amp; Karl Hyde|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/how-we-met-rick-smith-amp-karl-hyde-2130458.html|website=[[The Independent (UK)]]|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Dorian|first1=Lynskey|title=Underworld's Dubnobass ... 20 years on|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/09/karl-hyde-rick-smith-underworld-1994-album-dubnobasswithmyheadman|website=[[The Guardian (UK)]]|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref> They were joined by The Screen Gemz' [[Bass guitar|bass]] player Alfie Thomas, [[drum]]mer Bryn Burrows, and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboardist]] John Warwicker in forming a proto-[[electroclash]]/[[New wave music|new wave]] band whose name was a graphic squiggle, which was subsequently given the pronunciation [[Freur]]. The band signed to [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]], released 1983's ''[[Doot-Doot]]'', and disbanded in 1986 after followup ''[[Get Us out of Here]]'' was withheld.<ref>{{cite web|title=Freur |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/freur-mn0000987643/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, Hyde, Smith, Thomas, Burrows and bass player Baz Allen formed a band under the name Underworld (named after a [[Underworld (1985 film)|Clive Barker-scripted film]] which was scored by Freur),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/09/karl-hyde-rick-smith-underworld-1994-album-dubnobasswithmyheadman |title=Underworld's Dubnobass ... 20 years on |last1=Lynskey |first1=Dorian |date=9 October 2014 |website=[[Theguardian.com]]|accessdate=9 October 2014}}</ref> which tried a more guitar-orientated [[funk]]y [[electropop]] sound. The band signed to [[Sire Records]] and released the album ''[[Underneath the Radar]]'' in 1988 and, following the departure of Burrows, the album ''[[Change the Weather]]'' in 1989. This version of the band disbanded in 1990 and is supposedly regarded as a separate entity by the band's members to the one which would go on to release ''Dubnobasswithmyheadman'' (this album is therefore frequently referred to as being a debut). The Underworld of the ''Underneath the Radar'' and ''Change the Weather'' period is sometimes also referred to as being \"Underworld Mk1\".\n\n=== Underworld Mk2 ===\n{{Listen\n|filename=Underworld Rez.ogg\n|title=\"Rez\"\n|description=The band's 1993 dance anthem, \"Rez\".\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nAfter a break\u2014to concentrate on, among other things, art/design project [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]]\u2014Hyde and Smith recruited DJ [[Darren Emerson]] and after several minor releases and remixes as Lemon Inter<!--This is the intentional spelling of the band name with one 'r'-->upt and Steppin' Razor readopted the Underworld moniker. They produced danceable [[techno]] as a trio (\"Underworld Mk2\").\n\nThe addition of Emerson completed Underworld's techno/rock fusion and seemed to eliminate the pop elements in the original duo's work. Their first album, ''[[Dubnobasswithmyheadman]]'', was considered more accessible than the group's earlier material and crossed a large spectrum of dance music. The signature Hyde lyrics were in place: poetic, hypnotic and whispered; mixing conventional song writing with the use of [[Found art|found material]] from overheard conversations, answering machine recordings and the like. Hyde had been the lead singer in Underworld Mk1 but the original Hyde/Smith dance material was lyric-free as was most of the electronic music emerging from the aftermath of [[acid house]].\n\n=== The ''Trainspotting'' breakthrough ===\nThe band's 1996 album, ''[[Second Toughest in the Infants]]'', was their second studio album with Emerson and achieved a degree of commercial success, due in part to its release coinciding with that of the film ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''. The film featured \"Dark & Long (Dark Train)\", as well as the band's most commercially successful track to date, \"[[Born Slippy.NUXX]]\", which was originally released only as a B-side of a single and does not appear on the ''Second Toughest'' album. The single and the album showed Underworld maturing as a trio, mixing elements of [[techno]], [[House music|house]], [[drum and bass]] and [[experimental music]]. \n\"Born Slippy.NUXX\" is one of Underworld's best-known tracks and is celebrated as one of the greatest dance tracks of the decade. It was originally released in 1995 as a B-side to \"[[Born Slippy]]\" but failed to catch on until it was included in ''Trainspotting''. The track has since sold over a million copies and appeared on countless [[Compilation album|compilations]], [[Mashup (music)|mashups]] and [[remix]]es.\n\n=== ''Beaucoup Fish'' era ===\nAfter the release of fifth studio album ''[[Beaucoup Fish]]'' in 1999, Hyde declared in his interviews that he had sorted out earlier problems with [[alcoholism]] but all the members admitted that the sessions had been fraught with problems, with the individual members working in their own studios and only communicating via mixes of the raw material passed back and forth on [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]]. After the release of the album a large number of mixes of the album tracks seemed to surface on singles, magazine promotional CDs and similar ephemeral formats perhaps indicating the number of revisions the tracks had gone through to get to the point where they were acceptable to all three. The album's name derives from a sample of a Cajun fisherman in Louisiana on the track \"[[Jumbo (song)|Jumbo]]\". The band originally wanted to call the album ''Tonight, Matthew, I'm going to be Underworld'' (a catchphrase used by contestants on the UK [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] programme [[Stars in Their Eyes]]) but were convinced by their record company, [[Junior Boy's Own]], that the name would not be easily understood outside the UK. Finally, after all the singles had been released, a box set, ''[[Beaucoup Fish Singles]]'', which was a retrospective of all 4 singles came out.\n\nUnderworld embarked on a well-received tour in 1999, which resulted in a live CD and DVD drawn from several dates on the tour. Called ''[[Everything, Everything (album)|Everything, Everything]]'', the project captured the live Underworld experience very faithfully. A companion DVD was released separately soon after the album's release. The DVD features live footage of the band mixed with videography and artistic effects by the design group [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]]. The DVD also features several songs not on the album: \"Moaner\", \"Puppies\", \"Kittens\" and \"Rowla\". The disco scene in ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'' features Underworld's 1993 hit \"Rez\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259711/soundtrack|title=Vanilla Sky (2001) |website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Back to a duo ===\nAfter the release and promotion of ''Everything, Everything'', Emerson decided to leave Underworld to focus on his solo projects and record label. Hyde and Smith decided to continue as a duo. They recorded a new album, ''[[A Hundred Days Off]]'', released to general approval. Despite its status as the band's first studio album since Emerson's departure, its general sound and feel was, perhaps surprisingly for many Underworld fans, not dissimilar to the previous albums on which Emerson had had input. In 2003, a 2-disc anthology entitled ''1992\u20132002'' was released. This was the first appearance on an album of previously unavailable single tracks and B-sides, such as \"Bigmouth\", \"[[Spikee]]\", \"Dirty\" and \"8 Ball\". While touring in the summer and autumn of 2005, the duo was joined on stage by Darren Price, a DJ and producer who had remixed Underworld releases in the past.\n\nDuring their tour, they released a 3-CD set ''[[Live in Tokyo 25th November 2005|Live in Tokyo]]'', which was sold after the concert in Japan and later sold online. In late 2005, they released two compilations of new songs with accompanying photographs on Underworld Live, in a series entitled ''[[Riverrun (Underworld project)|Riverrun]]''. These were only released online, with no physical release (except for a promo CD). On 5 June 2006, they released their third installment, and on 10 July 2006, they released ''The Misterons Mix'', a special retrospective mix composed of ''Riverrun'' tracks, as an exclusive free download for customers that had purchased all three ''Riverrun'' releases.\n\nIn September 2006, Underworld released five limited edition (10,000 copies each) [[12\"]] vinyl releases, containing remixes of various ''Riverrun'' tracks. These tracks were also made available for purchase by digital download on the [[Beatport]] website. Later in 2006, the band teamed up with [[Gabriel Yared]] to compose the music score to [[Anthony Minghella]]'s film ''[[Breaking and Entering (film)|Breaking and Entering]]''. [[Breaking and Entering (soundtrack)|The soundtrack]] was released in the UK on 6 November, and in the USA on 5 December.\n\n=== ''Oblivion with Bells''===\n[[File:Underworldlivenewyork2007 crop.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Underworld performing \"[[Jumbo (song)|Jumbo]]\" in [[Central Park]], [[New York City]], 2007.]]\nUnderworld's seventh studio album, ''[[Oblivion with Bells]]'', was released on 16 October 2007.

Rick Smith was one of the people injured in the ensuing violence and he was taken to a nearby Athens hospital for treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-inside.com/underworld-dj-injured-in-riot-r157510.htm|title=UNDERWORLD DJ INJURED IN RIOT|accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref> On 19 October 2007, Underworld cancelled the remaining dates of their European tour due to illness in the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26653_0_2_0_C|title=Underworld cancel tour after severe illness member|accessdate=24 October 2007}}</ref> The tour was picked up again on 28 January 2008, with a concert in Cologne, followed by 16 dates in Europe, including some festivals.\n\nOn 8 August 2008, Underworld appeared at the [[All Points West Music & Arts Festival]] in [[Liberty State Park]], New Jersey. [[Radiohead]] dedicated their final song \"[[Everything in its Right Place]]\" to Underworld with a special remix. Karl Hyde appeared with [[Brian Eno]] on the final day of the Eno-curated Luminous Festival at Sydney Opera House. \"Pure Scenius\" consisted of three live improvised performances on the same day, featuring Eno, Hyde, Australian improv trio [[The Necks]], electronic artist [[Jon Hopkins]] and guitarist [[Leo Abrahams]].\n\nUnderworld has released two new series via their underworldlive.com site, in mp3 and WAV formats. The tracks are 020202, and the phonestrap/autotrader series. On 3 July 2009, Underworld debuted a new song tentatively titled \"Between Stars\" at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. Shortly before that, a post was made on the band's diary page showing a piece of paper with the song's first verse on it. On 8 August 2009, a show at Los Angeles' Forum was cancelled in circumstances similar to those that led to the group cancelling the show in Athens two years prior. Some of the crowd were climbing down the seats and onto the main floor, a potential safety hazard. The group apologized on their website for having the show called off.\n\nOn 8 March 2010 [[Mark Knight (musician)|Mark Knight]] and [[D. Ramirez]] released the single \"Downpipe\", which featured vocal contributions from Underworld's Karl Hyde.

The track is a collaboration with [[High Contrast]], a [[drum and bass]] [[DJ]] also from Cardiff.

The film was Capra's last feature, and although it was not the commercial success he hoped it would be, he \"gushed about Falk's performance\".<ref name=Fantle/> Falk was nominated for an Oscar for the role. In his autobiography, Capra wrote about Falk:\n{{quote|The entire production was agony&nbsp;... except for Peter Falk. He was my joy, my anchor to reality.

''The Name Above the Title: an Autobiography'', Macmillan (1971)</ref>{{rp|480}}}}\n\nFor his part, Falk says he \"never worked with a director who showed greater enjoyment of actors and the acting craft. There is nothing more important to an actor than to know that the one person who represents the audience to you, the director, is responding well to what you are trying to do.\" Falk once recalled how Capra reshot a scene even though he yelled \"Cut and Print,\" indicating the scene was finalized. When Falk asked him why he wanted it reshot: \"He laughed and said that he loved the scene so much he just wanted to see us do it again. How's that for support!\"<ref name=Fantle/>\n\nFor the remainder of the 1960s, Falk had mainly supporting movie roles and TV guest-starring appearances. Falk turned in a gem of a performance as one of two cabbies who falls victim to greed in the epic 1963 star-studded comedy ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'', although he only appears in the last fifth of the movie. His other roles included the character of Guy Gisborne in the [[Rat Pack]] musical comedy ''[[Robin and the 7 Hoods]]'' (1964), in which he sings one of the film's numbers, and the spoof ''[[The Great Race]]'' (1965) with [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Tony Curtis]].\n\n===Early television roles===\n[[File:Peter Falk in Decoy episode The Comeback (2).jpg|thumb|In ''[[Decoy (TV series)|Decoy]]'' (1959)]]\nFalk first appeared on television in 1957, in the dramatic anthology programs that later became known as the \"[[Golden Age of Television]]\".

On ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' he portrayed a [[Fidel Castro|Castro]]-type revolutionary complete with beard who, intoxicated with power, kept seeing his would-be assassins in a newly acquired magic mirror. He starred in two of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s television series, as a gangster terrified of death in a 1961 episode of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' and as a homicidal evangelist in 1962's ''[[The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]''.\n\nIn 1961, Falk was nominated for an ''[[Emmy Award]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/peter-falk|title=Peter Falk|work=Television Academy}}</ref> for his performance in the episode \"Cold Turkey\" of [[James Whitmore]]'s short-lived series ''[[The Law and Mr. Jones]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. On September 29, 1961, Falk and [[Walter Matthau]] guest-starred in the premiere episode, \"The Million Dollar Dump\", of ABC's crime drama ''[[Target: The Corruptors]]'', with [[Stephen McNally]] and [[Robert Harland]]. He won an Emmy for ''The Price of Tomatoes'', a drama carried in 1962 on ''[[The Dick Powell Show]]''.\n\nIn 1963, Falk and [[Tommy Sands (entertainer)|Tommy Sands]] appeared as brothers who disagreed on the route for a railroad in \"The Gus Morgan Story\" on ABC's ''[[Wagon Train]]''.

Ethan accidentally shoots wagonmaster Chris Hale, played by [[John McIntire]], while the brothers are in the mountains looking at possible route options. Gus makes the decision to leave Hale behind- even choking him, believing he is dead. Ethan has been overcome with oxygen deprivation and needs Gus' assistance to reach safety down the mountain. Unknown to the Morgans, Hale crawls down the mountain through snow, determined to obtain revenge against Gus. In time, though, Hale comes to understand the difficult choice Morgan had to make, and the brothers reconcile their own differences. This episode is remembered for its examination of how far a man will persist amid adversity to preserve his own life and that of his brother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/wagon-train-the-gus-morgan-story,44066/|title=The Gus Morgan Story|publisher=avclub.com|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nFalk's first television series was in the title role of the drama ''[[The Trials of O'Brien]]'', in which he played a lawyer.

In 1966, he also co-starred in a television production of \"Brigadoon\" with [[Robert Goulet]].\n\nIn 1971, [[Pierre Cossette]] produced the first [[Grammy Awards]] show on television with some help from Falk. Cossette writes in his autobiography, \"What meant the most to me, though, is the fact that Peter Falk saved my ass. I love show business, and I love Peter Falk.\"<ref>Cossette, Pierre. ''Another Day in Showbiz'', ECW Press (2002) p. 182</ref>\n\n===''Columbo''===\n[[File:Peter Falk - 1973.JPG|thumb|As Lt. Columbo, 1973]]\n{{main |Columbo}}\nAlthough Falk appeared in numerous other television roles in the 1960s and 1970s, he is best known as the star of the TV series ''[[Columbo]]'', \"everyone's favorite rumpled television detective\".<ref name=\"Fantle\" /> His character was a shabby and ostensibly absent-minded police detective lieutenant driving a [[Peugeot 403]], who had first appeared in the 1968 film ''Prescription: Murder''. Rather than a [[whodunit]], the show typically revealed the murderer from the beginning, then showed how the [[Los Angeles]] police detective Columbo went about solving the crime. Falk would describe his role to Fantle:\n{{quote|Columbo has a genuine mistiness about him. It seems to hang in the air\u2026 [and] he's capable of being distracted\u2026 Columbo is an ass-backwards Sherlock Holmes. Holmes had a long neck, Columbo has no neck; Holmes smoked a pipe, Columbo chews up six cigars a day.<ref name=Fantle />}}\n\nTelevision critic Ben Falk (no relation) added that Falk \"created an iconic cop\u2026 who always got his man (or woman) after a tortuous cat-and-mouse investigation\". He also noted the idea for the character was \"apparently inspired by Dostoyevsky's dogged police inspector, Porfiry Petrovich, in the novel ''[[Crime and Punishment]]''.<ref>Falk, Ben. ''Television's Strangest Moments'', Chrysalis Books (2005) p. 103</ref>\n\nFalk tries to analyze the character and notes the correlation between his own personality and Columbo's:\n{{quote|I'm a Virgo Jew, and that means I have an obsessive thoroughness. It's not enough to get most of the details, it's necessary to get them all. I've been accused of perfectionism. When [[Lew Wasserman]] (head of Universal Studios) said that Falk is a perfectionist, I don't know whether it was out of affection or because he felt I was a monumental pain in the ass.<ref name = Fantle />}}\n\nWith \"general amazement\", Falk notes: \"The show is all over the world. I've been to little villages in Africa with maybe one TV set, and little kids will run up to me shouting, 'Columbo, Columbo!'\"<ref name = Fantle /> Singer [[Johnny Cash]] recalled acting in one episode, and although he was not an experienced actor, he writes in his autobiography: \"Peter Falk was good to me. I wasn't at all confident about handling a dramatic role, and every day he helped me in all kinds of little ways.\"<ref>Cash, Johnny. ''Cash: the Autobiography'', Harper Collins (1997) p. 197</ref>\n\nThe first episode of ''Columbo'' as a series was directed in 1971 by a 24-year-old [[Steven Spielberg]] in one of his earliest directing jobs. Falk recalled the episode to Spielberg biographer [[Joseph McBride (writer)|Joseph McBride]]:\n{{quote|Let's face it, we had some good fortune at the beginning. Our debut episode, in 1971, was directed by this young kid named Steven Spielberg. I told the producers, Link and Levinson: \"This guy is too good for ''Columbo''\"... Steven was shooting me with a long lens from across the street. That wasn't common twenty years ago. The comfort level it gave me as an actor, besides its great look artistically\u2014well, it told you that this wasn't any ordinary director.\"<ref>McBride, Joseph. ''Steven Spielberg: A Biography'', Simon and Schuster (1997) p. 191</ref>}}\n\nThe character of Columbo had previously been played by [[Bert Freed]] in a single television episode of ''The Chevy Mystery Show'' in 1960, and by [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]]. Falk first played Columbo in ''Prescription: Murder'', a 1968 TV movie, and the 1970 pilot for the series, ''Ransom for a Dead Man''. From 1971 to 1978, ''Columbo'' aired regularly on NBC as part of the [[wheel series|umbrella series]] ''[[NBC Mystery Movie]]''. All episodes were of TV movie length, in a 90- or 120-minute slot including commercials. In 1989, the show returned on ABC in the form of a less frequent series of TV movies, still starring Falk, airing until 2003. Falk won four Emmys for his role as Columbo.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/entertainment/2011-06/25/c_13948960.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807072009/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/entertainment/2011-06/25/c_13948960.htm | url-status = dead | archive-date = August 7, 2011 | title = Actor Peter Falk dies at 83 | publisher = Xinhua | date = June 25, 2011 | accessdate = June 25, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n''Columbo'' was so popular, co-creator [[William Link]] wrote a series of short stories published as ''The Columbo Collection'' (Crippen & Landru, 2010) which includes a drawing by Falk of himself as Columbo, and the cover features a caricature of Falk/Columbo by [[Al Hirschfeld]].<ref>{{cite book |url= http://www.crippenlandru.com/shop/oscommerce-2.3.4/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=88 | title = The Columbo Collection by William Link | date = May 2010 |website =Crippen & Landru Publishers |isbn=978-1-932009-94-1 | accessdate = March 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Later career===\nFalk was a close friend of independent film director [[John Cassavetes]] and appeared in his films ''[[Husbands (film)|Husbands]]'', ''[[A Woman Under the Influence]]'', and, in a [[cameo appearance|cameo]], at the end of ''[[Opening Night (1977 film)|Opening Night]]''. Cassavetes guest-starred in the ''Columbo'' episode \"\u00c9tude in Black\" in 1972; Falk, in turn, co-starred with Cassavetes in the 1976 film ''[[Mikey and Nicky]]''. Falk describes his experiences working with Cassavetes, specifically remembering his directing strategies: \"Shooting an actor when he might be unaware the camera was running.\" {{quote|You never knew when the camera might be going. And it was never: 'Stop. Cut. Start again.' John would walk in the middle of a scene and talk, and though you didn't realize it, the camera kept going. So I never knew what the hell he was doing.

''The Films of John Cassavetes,'' Cambridge Univ.

In ''Wings of Desire'', Falk played a semi-fictionalized version of himself, a famous American actor who had once been an angel, but who had grown disillusioned with only observing life on Earth and had in turn given up his immortality. Falk described the role as \"the craziest thing that I've ever been offered\", but he earned critical acclaim for his supporting performance in the film.<ref name=\"KennyWenders\">{{cite AV media |last1=Kenny |first1=J.M. |last2=Wenders |first2=Wim |date=2009 |title=The Angels Among Us |medium=Blu-ray |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Falk returned to the New York stage to star in an [[Off-Broadway]] production of [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[Mr. Peters' Connections]]''.

How's that for support!\"<ref name=Fantle/>\n\nFor the remainder of the 1960s, Falk had mainly supporting movie roles and TV guest-starring appearances. Falk turned in a gem of a performance as one of two cabbies who falls victim to greed in the epic 1963 star-studded comedy ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'', although he only appears in the last fifth of the movie. His other roles included the character of Guy Gisborne in the [[Rat Pack]] musical comedy ''[[Robin and the 7 Hoods]]'' (1964), in which he sings one of the film's numbers, and the spoof ''[[The Great Race]]'' (1965) with [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Tony Curtis]].\n\n===Early television roles===\n[[File:Peter Falk in Decoy episode The Comeback (2).jpg|thumb|In ''[[Decoy (TV series)|Decoy]]'' (1959)]]\nFalk first appeared on television in 1957, in the dramatic anthology programs that later became known as the \"[[Golden Age of Television]]\".

On ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' he portrayed a [[Fidel Castro|Castro]]-type revolutionary complete with beard who, intoxicated with power, kept seeing his would-be assassins in a newly acquired magic mirror. He starred in two of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s television series, as a gangster terrified of death in a 1961 episode of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' and as a homicidal evangelist in 1962's ''[[The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]''.\n\nIn 1961, Falk was nominated for an ''[[Emmy Award]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/peter-falk|title=Peter Falk|work=Television Academy}}</ref> for his performance in the episode \"Cold Turkey\" of [[James Whitmore]]'s short-lived series ''[[The Law and Mr. Jones]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. On September 29, 1961, Falk and [[Walter Matthau]] guest-starred in the premiere episode, \"The Million Dollar Dump\", of ABC's crime drama ''[[Target: The Corruptors]]'', with [[Stephen McNally]] and [[Robert Harland]]. He won an Emmy for ''The Price of Tomatoes'', a drama carried in 1962 on ''[[The Dick Powell Show]]''.\n\nIn 1963, Falk and [[Tommy Sands (entertainer)|Tommy Sands]] appeared as brothers who disagreed on the route for a railroad in \"The Gus Morgan Story\" on ABC's ''[[Wagon Train]]''. Falk played the title role of \"Gus\", and Sands was his younger brother, Ethan Morgan. Ethan accidentally shoots wagonmaster Chris Hale, played by [[John McIntire]], while the brothers are in the mountains looking at possible route options. Gus makes the decision to leave Hale behind- even choking him, believing he is dead. Ethan has been overcome with oxygen deprivation and needs Gus' assistance to reach safety down the mountain. Unknown to the Morgans, Hale crawls down the mountain through snow, determined to obtain revenge against Gus. In time, though, Hale comes to understand the difficult choice Morgan had to make, and the brothers reconcile their own differences. This episode is remembered for its examination of how far a man will persist amid adversity to preserve his own life and that of his brother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/wagon-train-the-gus-morgan-story,44066/|title=The Gus Morgan Story|publisher=avclub.com|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nFalk's first television series was in the title role of the drama ''[[The Trials of O'Brien]]'', in which he played a lawyer.

''Cash: the Autobiography'', Harper Collins (1997) p. 197</ref>\n\nThe first episode of ''Columbo'' as a series was directed in 1971 by a 24-year-old [[Steven Spielberg]] in one of his earliest directing jobs. Falk recalled the episode to Spielberg biographer [[Joseph McBride (writer)|Joseph McBride]]:\n{{quote|Let's face it, we had some good fortune at the beginning. Our debut episode, in 1971, was directed by this young kid named Steven Spielberg. I told the producers, Link and Levinson: \"This guy is too good for ''Columbo''\"...

From 1971 to 1978, ''Columbo'' aired regularly on NBC as part of the [[wheel series|umbrella series]] ''[[NBC Mystery Movie]]''. All episodes were of TV movie length, in a 90- or 120-minute slot including commercials. In 1989, the show returned on ABC in the form of a less frequent series of TV movies, still starring Falk, airing until 2003.

The show featured [[Bam Bam Bigelow]]'s debut and an award to Flair.<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/>\n\nAt the urging of Bigelow, Heyman made his managerial debut on January 2, 1987, initially appearing on the Northeast [[independent circuit]] before moving to a more high-profile stint with [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] in February 1987. There, he joined forces with [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] and [[Oliver Humperdink]], and acquired the name '''Paul E. Dangerously''' because of his resemblance to [[Michael Keaton]]'s character in ''[[Johnny Dangerously]]''.<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/> After CWF was absorbed by Jim Crockett Promotions, Bigelow brought him to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and the [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA) to manage [[Tommy Rich]] and [[Austin Idol]] in a heated feud with [[Jerry Lawler]], a war which later carried over to the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), with the [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|Original Midnight Express]] ([[Dennis Condrey]] and [[Randy Rose]]) taking over for Idol and the [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]]-[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned]] Rich.<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/><ref name=\"slam\"/>\n\nThe Paul E.

Heyman joined with [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert's]] Hot Stuff Inc. [[Professional wrestling stable|stable]]. Behind the scenes, Gilbert was the head [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booker]] of the [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]], and Heyman became his assistant. Heyman was also the head booker for Windy City Wrestling in Chicago and started developing a reputation as being an innovative television writer and producer.<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/>\n\n===National Wrestling Alliance / World Championship Wrestling (1988\u20131993)===\n{{Main|The Dangerous Alliance}}\nIn 1988, Heyman jumped to [[Jim Crockett Promotions]], where Dangerously again managed the Original Midnight Express in a feud with the new Midnight Express ([[Bobby Eaton]] and [[Stan Lane]]) and their manager, [[Jim Cornette]], as well as managing [[The Undertaker|\"Mean\" Mark Callous]]. He settled into the role of an announcer, joining [[Jim Ross]] to call the matches on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|WTBS']] ''[[WCW Saturday Night|World Championship Wrestling]]'' and other programming. Heyman admitted he learned more working with Ross than from his previous mentors.<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/> While in-between stints in WCW, Heyman went to work for [[International World Class Championship Wrestling|ICW]] as a writer, but was fired on his first day in the middle of his first TV taping.<ref>Wrestling Observer Newsletter (November 27, 1989).</ref>\n\nIn 1991, WCW needed to re-structure its \"[[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]s\", so Heyman returned to the role as spokesman and ringside manager as the [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] of the Dangerous Alliance (a new version of the Four Horsemen), with [[Rick Rude]] as the centerpiece of the stable. According to Heyman, he and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] learned their craft from Rude.<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/> Heyman led Rude to the [[WWE United States Championship|United States title]] and the Anderson-Eaton [[tag team]] to the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|Tag Team titles]].

Dangerously.jpg|thumb|Heyman at an ECW show in 1998]]\n[[File:Paul (E) Heyman Addressing Crowd.jpg|thumb|left|Heyman addressing the crowd at an ECW television taping in 1999]]\nAfter departing WCW, Heyman attempted to start a new promotion in [[Texas]] with [[Jim Crockett, Jr.]]. Disagreement arose, however, as Crockett wanted to build a traditional wrestling brand, while Heyman believed traditional wrestling was antiquated and a new take on the genre was needed.<ref>[http://www.eddiegilbert.com/profile2.html \"Dangerously did work some ECW shows during the year but most of the year saw him trying to get a new promotion off the ground in Texas with Jim Crockett, Jr. The effort would not fly and, by October, Gordon wanted Dangerously brought into ECW\"], Eddiegilbert.com; retrieved May 8, 2012.</ref>\n\nAt this time, Eddie Gilbert was a booker for a Philadelphia-based promotion, [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA)'s [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|Eastern Championship Wrestling]], which he did under the ownership of a local [[Pawnbroker|pawn shop]] owner named [[Tod Gordon]]. Heyman came in to help Gilbert teach the younger wrestlers how to perform on interviews,<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/> but Gilbert's erratic behavior became too much for Gordon, who had a major falling out with Gilbert right before the \"Ultra Clash\" event on September 18, 1993. From that point forward, Heyman was in charge of the creative direction of the company. As Paul E. Dangerously, he managed a few wrestlers, including [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] and [[911 (wrestler)|911]].\n\nA year later, the company was the [[flagship]] promotion of the struggling NWA. A tournament was scheduled to be held in August 1994 for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], at an ECW-hosted event mostly featuring ECW wrestlers. The proposed outcome was the current ECW champion [[Shane Douglas]] becoming champion, but Heyman conspired with Douglas and Gordon without the knowledge of NWA president [[Dennis Coralluzzo]] to have Douglas (and by extension, ECW itself) publicly denounce the NWA and its \"tradition\" after winning the tournament. In his post-match speech, Douglas aggressively assaulted the title's lineage, throwing the belt itself down, proclaiming the NWA a \"dead organization\" and declaring his ECW title a [[World heavyweight championship (professional wrestling)|world-level]] championship. The plan for this [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] [[screwjob]] was known only to those three.<ref>[http://www.wrestlingepicenter.com/shows/ShaneDouglas The New Online Home of The Interactive Interview], WrestlingEpicenter.com; retrieved May 17, 2015.</ref>\n\nThat same week, Heyman and [[Tod Gordon]] rechristened the promotion, eliminating the regional branding \"Eastern\" and declaring the promotion [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]]. They broke the company away from the NWA, and ECW became its own entity. Heyman encouraged wrestlers to express their true feelings about the WWF, the NWA, and WCW. Heyman bought out Gordon and became sole owner of ECW. During his time in ECW, Heyman found an ally in [[Vince McMahon]]'s WWF. McMahon had sent some WWF wrestlers to ECW (under WWF payroll) to develop them and was interested in some ECW wrestlers, such as [[Terry Gordy]] and [[2 Cold Scorpio]]. McMahon paid Heyman $1,000 per week to rent Scorpio.<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/>\n \nIn the final days of ECW, Heyman did not appear on the show and was replaced as the leader of the backstage and creative by ECW wrestler [[Tommy Dreamer]].<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/> ECW entered into bankruptcy in 2001 (just weeks after WCW was sold to WWF for $2,000,000, after AOL Time Warner wrote off over $100 million in debt), with the company $7,000,000 in arrears, with over $3,000,000 owed to the company by InDemand pay per view.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001\u20132006)===\n====Commentator and writer (2001\u20132003)====\nHeyman became a broadcaster for the WWF, replacing [[Jerry Lawler]] who quit due to a dispute when his wife was fired in February 2001. During that time, he resumed his storyline rivalry with Jim Ross. In July, while retaining his commentator role, Heyman recreated ECW as a stable, which then immediately merged with [[Shane McMahon]]'s WCW to form [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|the Alliance]] during [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|the Invasion angle]]. Heyman was \"[[Kayfabe#Contracts, employment status and suspensions|fired]]\" following the 2001 [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] when the Alliance lost a do or die match that marked the end of the invasion angle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://network.wwe.com/video/v534952383?contextType=wwe-show&contextId=raw_replays&contentId=159854032&watchlistAltButtonContext=series|title=Raw Replays|website=WWE Network}}</ref>\n\nHeyman was the lead writer for ''SmackDown!'' from July 2002 to February 2003.

Heyman returned to television to assume Stephanie McMahon's on-camera role as GM. On March 22, 2004, he appeared on ''Raw'' to take part in the annual [[WWE draft|WWE draft lottery]]. During the show he was drafted to ''RAW'' to work for ''RAW'' General Manager [[Eric Bischoff]].

It was during this time that he forged a real-life friendship with [[CM Punk]].<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/>\n\n====Return of ECW and departure (2005\u20132006)====\n[[File:Paulheyman.jpg|thumb|left|Heyman in the ring in 2006]]\nOn May 23, 2005, Heyman returned in a segment with Vince McMahon and Eric Bischoff announcing [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]], with Heyman in charge. On the May 22, 2006 episode of ''Raw'', Heyman appeared as ECW Representative promoting [[ECW One Night Stand (2006)|ECW One Night Stand]]. On May 25, 2006 it was announced that [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW would relaunch]], as a third WWE brand. Heyman was in charge of the new brand on-camera but had minimal creative input off-camera as well. On the May 29 episode of ''Raw'', during a face-off with [[Mick Foley]], Heyman announced that he was granted a draft pick from both [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]] by [[Vince McMahon]]. His Raw draft pick was former ECW wrestler (and [[Money in the Bank ladder match|Money in the Bank]] contract holder) [[Rob Van Dam]], and his SmackDown! draft pick was [[Kurt Angle]]. Heyman predicted that Van Dam would defeat [[John Cena]] at ''One Night Stand'' for the [[WWE Championship]] and then declare himself the new [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW World Heavyweight Champion]].\n\nAt One Night Stand, Van Dam defeated Cena to win the WWE Championship. After Cena knocked an ECW referee unconscious, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] (in a disguise) appeared and speared Cena through a table, before taking out ''SmackDown!'' referee [[Nick Hamilton|Nick Patrick]], allowing Van Dam to hit the Five-Star Frog Splash on Cena. With no referee available Heyman ran down the aisle to count the pinfall. The following night on ''Raw'', Heyman confirmed that because the championship match was contested under \"ECW rules\" (which means, essentially, there are no rules) that the decision stands and RVD is the \"Undisputed\" WWE Champion. As the WWE Champion, Van Dam was the number one man in the reformed ECW, so on the debut of ''ECW on Sci Fi'' the next night Heyman, announced as an \"ECW Representative\", presented him with the re-instated ECW World Heavyweight Championship. Van Dam elected to keep both title belts and was recognized as both the WWE and ECW Champion.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} On the July 4 episode of ''ECW'', Heyman helped [[Big Show]] defeat Van Dam for the ECW title.\n\nHeyman traveled home from the Raw/ECW taping in [[South Carolina]] due to a behind-the-scenes dispute over ECW's only pay-per-view under WWE, [[December to Dismember (2006)|December to Dismember]], McMahon and Heyman clashed in front of several members of the writing team on McMahon's corporate jet the day after the pay-per-view. After allegedly turning down an offer from [[Stephanie McMahon]] to return to his post writing TV for WWE Developmental television shows, Heyman quietly parted ways with WWE in late 2006. The argument with Vince McMahon was over a disagreement over the Elimination Chamber match at December to Dismember. Heyman thought that the Big Show should be eliminated in the Elimination Chamber match by CM Punk via submission, in order to push the rising star. Big Show agreed with this idea, wanting to help push Punk's career, but Vince McMahon disagreed, and Punk was ultimately eliminated first.<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/>\n\n===Return to WWE (2012\u2013present)===\n[[File:CM Punk and Paul Heyman.jpg|thumb|Heyman brandishing the [[WWE Championship]] on behalf of champion [[CM Punk]]]]\n\nIn April 2012, [[Brock Lesnar]] returned to [[WWE]].

Lesnar would go on to defeat Triple H at SummerSlam.\n\nOn the September 3 episode of ''Raw'', after [[CM Punk]] attacked [[John Cena]], Heyman was seen driving the car Punk had entered. This began an alliance between CM Punk and Heyman. Heyman began accompanying Punk to the ring for his matches and promos. Because of the events of the previous weeks, on the February 11 episode of ''Raw'', Heyman addressed the audience intending to resign from the company. CM Punk, however, convinced Heyman to not only stay with the company, but also to be in Punk's corner at the upcoming [[Elimination Chamber (2013)|Elimination Chamber]] pay-per-view for his [[WWE Championship]] match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2013-02-11/wwe-raw-results-26090968|title=Raw results: The Elimination Chamber fills out and Punk makes his biggest power play yet|author=Benigno, Anthony|publisher=WWE|accessdate=January 25, 2016|date=February 11, 2013}}</ref> Around this time, Heyman quietly cut off his signature [[ponytail]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tmz.com/2014/02/06/paul-heyman-ponytail-hhh-didnt-force-me-wwe/|title=WWE Star Paul Heyman -- Triple H Did NOT Force Me to Chop Off My Ponytail|work=TMZ|access-date=February 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nLater, CM Punk earned the right to [[The Streak (wrestling)|fight The Undertaker]] at [[WrestleMania 29]] after winning a Fatal Four Way match at ''Old School Raw''.

As a response, Lesnar and Heyman invaded the headquarters of WWE and trashed Triple H's office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/videos/triple-h-responds-to-brock-lesnars-workplace-invasion-at-wwe-headquarters-raw-ma-26113234|title=Triple H responds to Brock Lesnar's workplace invasion at WWE headquarters: Raw|date=May 6, 2013|publisher=WWE.com}}</ref> At Extreme Rules, Lesnar defeated Triple H with the help of Heyman.\n\nHeyman announced Michael McGillicutty as the newest \"Paul Heyman guy\" on the May 20 ''Raw'' and gave him the new name of [[Curtis Axel]]. On the May 27 episode of ''Raw'', Heyman appeared on the ''Highlight Reel'' with [[Chris Jericho]], where Jericho challenged CM Punk to a match at [[Payback (2013)|Payback]] which Heyman accepted on Punk's behalf. The next week, Heyman and Jericho signed the contract to make it official. The same week on ''SmackDown'', Jericho faced off against Curtis Axel. As Jericho was closing in on the victory, Heyman stood on the announcers table and yelled: \"It's clobbering time\". Punk's music began to play, distracting Jericho long enough for Axel to pick up the victory.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n[[File:Brock Lesnar with Paul Heyman.jpg|thumb|left|[[Brock Lesnar]] and Paul Heyman at [[WrestleMania 29]]]]\n\nAt Payback, Heyman coached Axel during his match with [[Wade Barrett]] and [[The Miz]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] with Axel winning the match and the title. Heyman accompanied Punk to the ring later in the show for his match with Chris Jericho. After ''Payback'', a WWE.com exclusive video aired with Punk telling Heyman that he is his friend and not his client. On the June 17 episode of ''Raw'', Punk challenged [[Alberto Del Rio]], mentioning that he did not want Heyman managing him anymore. Following Punk's match, he was attacked by Lesnar. The next week on ''Raw'', Punk demanded answers from Heyman, who swore he did not ask Lesnar to attack him. Punk forgave Heyman and then faced [[Darren Young]] and, following his win, was attacked by [[Titus O'Neil]] until Curtis Axel saved him, to Punk's chagrin. Heyman announced that he would team with Axel against [[The Prime Time Players]] the next week, again to Punk's disapproval.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAt [[Money in the Bank (2013)|Money in the Bank]], Heyman betrayed CM Punk, costing him his chance at the Money in the Bank briefcase by hitting him three times with a ladder, knocking Punk off the ladder when he was ascending. On the August 5 episode of ''Raw'', Punk retaliated by choking Heyman while Heyman was in Curtis Axel's corner during a match. This prompted Lesnar to enter the ring and attack Punk. Heyman later challenged Punk to a 1-on-1 match for the next week's ''Raw'', which Punk accepted.<ref>[http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2013-08-05/wwe-raw-results-26137732/page-9 CM Punk vs. Intercontinental Champion Curtis Axel went to a No Contest], wwe.com, August 5, 2013; retrieved May 17, 2015.</ref> However, this was revealed to be a trap when Lesnar appeared prior to the match. The plan was foiled, however, when Heyman dared CM Punk to come into the ring and accept the challenge as CM Punk, who had anticipated the trap and hid under the ring, emerged and attacked Lesnar. However, Punk failed to get his hands on Heyman as Curtis Axel came to Heyman's aid.<ref>[http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2013-08-12/wwe-raw-results-26139610/page-11 CM Punk surprised Paul Heyman and Brock Lesnar], wwe.com, August 12, 2013; retrieved May 17, 2015.</ref> This led to a match between Lesnar and Punk at [[SummerSlam (2013)|SummerSlam]], which Lesnar won after interference from Heyman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0svxTVEscaU|title=CM Punk Vs Brock Lesnar WWE SummerSlam 2013 - YouTube video,|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=|access-date=May 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=\"I think the bar was set so high with the chemistry that [[Brock Lesnar|Brock]] and I have, and the chemistry that [[CM Punk|Punk]] and I had, that it would be very difficult to match that ...

Heyman was then booked to team with Axel against CM Punk in an elimination handicap match at [[Night of Champions (2013)|Night of Champions]]. Heyman tried various times to get out of the match, which caused General Manager [[Brad Maddox]] to make the match into a no disqualification elimination handicap match. At Night of Champions, Punk eliminated Axel (who had been forced to defend his [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] against [[Kofi Kingston]] earlier in the night), leaving Heyman alone with Punk. After receiving a beating from Punk and being placed in handcuffs, just as Heyman did to Punk weeks before, Punk was about to attack Heyman with a kendo stick when [[Ryback]] interfered and cost Punk the match by putting Punk through a table.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uproxx.com/sports/2013/09/wwe-night-champions-2013-results|title=WWE Night Of Champions 2013 Results|work=UPROXX}}</ref>\n\nAt [[Battleground (2013)|Battleground]], Punk pinned Ryback after a low blow. At [[Hell in a Cell (2013)|Hell in a Cell]], Punk defeated both Ryback and Heyman and after the match attacked Heyman on top of the cell, putting an end to their feud. On the November 11, 2013 episode of ''Raw'', Heyman stated that he was no longer with Ryback as Ryback never officially accepted his proposal to become a \"Paul Heyman Guy\". After that, CM Punk came out to once again beat Heyman with a kendo stick. The following night on ''SmackDown'', Heyman formally announced to Curtis Axel and Ryback that they were no longer Paul Heyman guys, therefore marking the end of Axel's association with Heyman as he continued to team with Ryback. Heyman returned on the December 30 episode of ''Raw'' alongside Brock Lesnar, who attacked [[Mark Henry]]. He stood by Lesnar as he feuded with [[Big Show]] and [[The Undertaker]] in the first four months of 2014. Lesnar ended [[The Streak (wrestling)|The Undertaker's undefeated streak]] at [[WrestleMania XXX]]; this was Undertaker's first loss at a WrestleMania, as he previously had a record of 21 wins.\n\n[[File:Paul Heyman is the happiest man in the world.jpg|thumb|Heyman in April 2014]]\nOn the ''Raw'' following WrestleMania, [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] revealed himself to be a \"Paul Heyman Guy\".

The same year, he became producer of Studio 54 and hosted the first Wrestle Party 85 show. He called Jim Crockett, who sent [[Ric Flair]], Dusty Rhodes and [[Magnum TA]]. The show featured [[Bam Bam Bigelow]]'s debut and an award to Flair.<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/>\n\nAt the urging of Bigelow, Heyman made his managerial debut on January 2, 1987, initially appearing on the Northeast [[independent circuit]] before moving to a more high-profile stint with [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] in February 1987. There, he joined forces with [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] and [[Oliver Humperdink]], and acquired the name '''Paul E. Dangerously''' because of his resemblance to [[Michael Keaton]]'s character in ''[[Johnny Dangerously]]''.<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/> After CWF was absorbed by Jim Crockett Promotions, Bigelow brought him to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and the [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA) to manage [[Tommy Rich]] and [[Austin Idol]] in a heated feud with [[Jerry Lawler]], a war which later carried over to the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), with the [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|Original Midnight Express]] ([[Dennis Condrey]] and [[Randy Rose]]) taking over for Idol and the [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]]-[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned]] Rich.<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/><ref name=\"slam\"/>\n\nThe Paul E.

Heyman joined with [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert's]] Hot Stuff Inc. [[Professional wrestling stable|stable]]. Behind the scenes, Gilbert was the head [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booker]] of the [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]], and Heyman became his assistant. Heyman was also the head booker for Windy City Wrestling in Chicago and started developing a reputation as being an innovative television writer and producer.<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/>\n\n===National Wrestling Alliance / World Championship Wrestling (1988\u20131993)===\n{{Main|The Dangerous Alliance}}\nIn 1988, Heyman jumped to [[Jim Crockett Promotions]], where Dangerously again managed the Original Midnight Express in a feud with the new Midnight Express ([[Bobby Eaton]] and [[Stan Lane]]) and their manager, [[Jim Cornette]], as well as managing [[The Undertaker|\"Mean\" Mark Callous]]. He settled into the role of an announcer, joining [[Jim Ross]] to call the matches on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|WTBS']] ''[[WCW Saturday Night|World Championship Wrestling]]'' and other programming. Heyman admitted he learned more working with Ross than from his previous mentors.<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/> While in-between stints in WCW, Heyman went to work for [[International World Class Championship Wrestling|ICW]] as a writer, but was fired on his first day in the middle of his first TV taping.<ref>Wrestling Observer Newsletter (November 27, 1989).</ref>\n\nIn 1991, WCW needed to re-structure its \"[[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]s\", so Heyman returned to the role as spokesman and ringside manager as the [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] of the Dangerous Alliance (a new version of the Four Horsemen), with [[Rick Rude]] as the centerpiece of the stable. According to Heyman, he and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] learned their craft from Rude.<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/> Heyman led Rude to the [[WWE United States Championship|United States title]] and the Anderson-Eaton [[tag team]] to the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|Tag Team titles]].

Dangerously.jpg|thumb|Heyman at an ECW show in 1998]]\n[[File:Paul (E) Heyman Addressing Crowd.jpg|thumb|left|Heyman addressing the crowd at an ECW television taping in 1999]]\nAfter departing WCW, Heyman attempted to start a new promotion in [[Texas]] with [[Jim Crockett, Jr.]]. Disagreement arose, however, as Crockett wanted to build a traditional wrestling brand, while Heyman believed traditional wrestling was antiquated and a new take on the genre was needed.<ref>[http://www.eddiegilbert.com/profile2.html \"Dangerously did work some ECW shows during the year but most of the year saw him trying to get a new promotion off the ground in Texas with Jim Crockett, Jr. The effort would not fly and, by October, Gordon wanted Dangerously brought into ECW\"], Eddiegilbert.com; retrieved May 8, 2012.</ref>\n\nAt this time, Eddie Gilbert was a booker for a Philadelphia-based promotion, [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA)'s [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|Eastern Championship Wrestling]], which he did under the ownership of a local [[Pawnbroker|pawn shop]] owner named [[Tod Gordon]]. Heyman came in to help Gilbert teach the younger wrestlers how to perform on interviews,<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/> but Gilbert's erratic behavior became too much for Gordon, who had a major falling out with Gilbert right before the \"Ultra Clash\" event on September 18, 1993. From that point forward, Heyman was in charge of the creative direction of the company. As Paul E. Dangerously, he managed a few wrestlers, including [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] and [[911 (wrestler)|911]].\n\nA year later, the company was the [[flagship]] promotion of the struggling NWA. A tournament was scheduled to be held in August 1994 for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], at an ECW-hosted event mostly featuring ECW wrestlers. The proposed outcome was the current ECW champion [[Shane Douglas]] becoming champion, but Heyman conspired with Douglas and Gordon without the knowledge of NWA president [[Dennis Coralluzzo]] to have Douglas (and by extension, ECW itself) publicly denounce the NWA and its \"tradition\" after winning the tournament. In his post-match speech, Douglas aggressively assaulted the title's lineage, throwing the belt itself down, proclaiming the NWA a \"dead organization\" and declaring his ECW title a [[World heavyweight championship (professional wrestling)|world-level]] championship. The plan for this [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] [[screwjob]] was known only to those three.<ref>[http://www.wrestlingepicenter.com/shows/ShaneDouglas The New Online Home of The Interactive Interview], WrestlingEpicenter.com; retrieved May 17, 2015.</ref>\n\nThat same week, Heyman and [[Tod Gordon]] rechristened the promotion, eliminating the regional branding \"Eastern\" and declaring the promotion [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]]. They broke the company away from the NWA, and ECW became its own entity. Heyman encouraged wrestlers to express their true feelings about the WWF, the NWA, and WCW. Heyman bought out Gordon and became sole owner of ECW. During his time in ECW, Heyman found an ally in [[Vince McMahon]]'s WWF. McMahon had sent some WWF wrestlers to ECW (under WWF payroll) to develop them and was interested in some ECW wrestlers, such as [[Terry Gordy]] and [[2 Cold Scorpio]]. McMahon paid Heyman $1,000 per week to rent Scorpio.<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/>\n \nIn the final days of ECW, Heyman did not appear on the show and was replaced as the leader of the backstage and creative by ECW wrestler [[Tommy Dreamer]].<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/> ECW entered into bankruptcy in 2001 (just weeks after WCW was sold to WWF for $2,000,000, after AOL Time Warner wrote off over $100 million in debt), with the company $7,000,000 in arrears, with over $3,000,000 owed to the company by InDemand pay per view.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001\u20132006)===\n====Commentator and writer (2001\u20132003)====\nHeyman became a broadcaster for the WWF, replacing [[Jerry Lawler]] who quit due to a dispute when his wife was fired in February 2001. During that time, he resumed his storyline rivalry with Jim Ross. In July, while retaining his commentator role, Heyman recreated ECW as a stable, which then immediately merged with [[Shane McMahon]]'s WCW to form [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|the Alliance]] during [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|the Invasion angle]]. Heyman was \"[[Kayfabe#Contracts, employment status and suspensions|fired]]\" following the 2001 [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] when the Alliance lost a do or die match that marked the end of the invasion angle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://network.wwe.com/video/v534952383?contextType=wwe-show&contextId=raw_replays&contentId=159854032&watchlistAltButtonContext=series|title=Raw Replays|website=WWE Network}}</ref>\n\nHeyman was the lead writer for ''SmackDown!'' from July 2002 to February 2003. On Heyman's 2014 WWE documentary ''Ladies and Gentleman, My Name is Paul Heyman'', Heyman stated that the ''SmackDown!'' brand he was writing was beating ''Raw'' in ratings, merchandise and live show attendance during a time McMahon wanted real-life competition between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]] brands.<ref name=\"heymanwriter\">{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/wwe/10-ways-paul-heymans-smackdown-was-the-best-ever.php|title=10 Ways Paul Heyman's Smackdown Was The Best Ever|publisher=whatculture.com|accessdate=September 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Managing Brock Lesnar (2002\u20132003)====\nWhile he was in WWE, [[Tazz]] spoke to him about [[Brock Lesnar]], a WWE developmental wrestler.

General Manager (2003\u20132004)====\nAfter McMahon defeated his daughter [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie]] in October 2003 at the [[No Mercy (2003)|No Mercy]] pay-per-view, the storyline was that she was forced to resign from her position as [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General managers 2|General Manager]] (GM) of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]''. Heyman returned to television to assume Stephanie McMahon's on-camera role as GM. On March 22, 2004, he appeared on ''Raw'' to take part in the annual [[WWE draft|WWE draft lottery]]. During the show he was drafted to ''RAW'' to work for ''RAW'' General Manager [[Eric Bischoff]].

It was during this time that he forged a real-life friendship with [[CM Punk]].<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/>\n\n====Return of ECW and departure (2005\u20132006)====\n[[File:Paulheyman.jpg|thumb|left|Heyman in the ring in 2006]]\nOn May 23, 2005, Heyman returned in a segment with Vince McMahon and Eric Bischoff announcing [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]], with Heyman in charge. On the May 22, 2006 episode of ''Raw'', Heyman appeared as ECW Representative promoting [[ECW One Night Stand (2006)|ECW One Night Stand]]. On May 25, 2006 it was announced that [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW would relaunch]], as a third WWE brand. Heyman was in charge of the new brand on-camera but had minimal creative input off-camera as well. On the May 29 episode of ''Raw'', during a face-off with [[Mick Foley]], Heyman announced that he was granted a draft pick from both [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]] by [[Vince McMahon]]. His Raw draft pick was former ECW wrestler (and [[Money in the Bank ladder match|Money in the Bank]] contract holder) [[Rob Van Dam]], and his SmackDown! draft pick was [[Kurt Angle]]. Heyman predicted that Van Dam would defeat [[John Cena]] at ''One Night Stand'' for the [[WWE Championship]] and then declare himself the new [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW World Heavyweight Champion]].\n\nAt One Night Stand, Van Dam defeated Cena to win the WWE Championship. After Cena knocked an ECW referee unconscious, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] (in a disguise) appeared and speared Cena through a table, before taking out ''SmackDown!'' referee [[Nick Hamilton|Nick Patrick]], allowing Van Dam to hit the Five-Star Frog Splash on Cena. With no referee available Heyman ran down the aisle to count the pinfall. The following night on ''Raw'', Heyman confirmed that because the championship match was contested under \"ECW rules\" (which means, essentially, there are no rules) that the decision stands and RVD is the \"Undisputed\" WWE Champion. As the WWE Champion, Van Dam was the number one man in the reformed ECW, so on the debut of ''ECW on Sci Fi'' the next night Heyman, announced as an \"ECW Representative\", presented him with the re-instated ECW World Heavyweight Championship. Van Dam elected to keep both title belts and was recognized as both the WWE and ECW Champion.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} On the July 4 episode of ''ECW'', Heyman helped [[Big Show]] defeat Van Dam for the ECW title.\n\nHeyman traveled home from the Raw/ECW taping in [[South Carolina]] due to a behind-the-scenes dispute over ECW's only pay-per-view under WWE, [[December to Dismember (2006)|December to Dismember]], McMahon and Heyman clashed in front of several members of the writing team on McMahon's corporate jet the day after the pay-per-view. After allegedly turning down an offer from [[Stephanie McMahon]] to return to his post writing TV for WWE Developmental television shows, Heyman quietly parted ways with WWE in late 2006. The argument with Vince McMahon was over a disagreement over the Elimination Chamber match at December to Dismember. Heyman thought that the Big Show should be eliminated in the Elimination Chamber match by CM Punk via submission, in order to push the rising star. Big Show agreed with this idea, wanting to help push Punk's career, but Vince McMahon disagreed, and Punk was ultimately eliminated first.<ref name=\"PaulHeymanDVD1\"/>\n\n===Return to WWE (2012\u2013present)===\n[[File:CM Punk and Paul Heyman.jpg|thumb|Heyman brandishing the [[WWE Championship]] on behalf of champion [[CM Punk]]]]\n\nIn April 2012, [[Brock Lesnar]] returned to [[WWE]].

Lesnar would go on to defeat Triple H at SummerSlam.\n\nOn the September 3 episode of ''Raw'', after [[CM Punk]] attacked [[John Cena]], Heyman was seen driving the car Punk had entered. This began an alliance between CM Punk and Heyman. Heyman began accompanying Punk to the ring for his matches and promos. Because of the events of the previous weeks, on the February 11 episode of ''Raw'', Heyman addressed the audience intending to resign from the company. CM Punk, however, convinced Heyman to not only stay with the company, but also to be in Punk's corner at the upcoming [[Elimination Chamber (2013)|Elimination Chamber]] pay-per-view for his [[WWE Championship]] match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2013-02-11/wwe-raw-results-26090968|title=Raw results: The Elimination Chamber fills out and Punk makes his biggest power play yet|author=Benigno, Anthony|publisher=WWE|accessdate=January 25, 2016|date=February 11, 2013}}</ref> Around this time, Heyman quietly cut off his signature [[ponytail]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tmz.com/2014/02/06/paul-heyman-ponytail-hhh-didnt-force-me-wwe/|title=WWE Star Paul Heyman -- Triple H Did NOT Force Me to Chop Off My Ponytail|work=TMZ|access-date=February 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nLater, CM Punk earned the right to [[The Streak (wrestling)|fight The Undertaker]] at [[WrestleMania 29]] after winning a Fatal Four Way match at ''Old School Raw''.

As a response, Lesnar and Heyman invaded the headquarters of WWE and trashed Triple H's office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/videos/triple-h-responds-to-brock-lesnars-workplace-invasion-at-wwe-headquarters-raw-ma-26113234|title=Triple H responds to Brock Lesnar's workplace invasion at WWE headquarters: Raw|date=May 6, 2013|publisher=WWE.com}}</ref> At Extreme Rules, Lesnar defeated Triple H with the help of Heyman.\n\nHeyman announced Michael McGillicutty as the newest \"Paul Heyman guy\" on the May 20 ''Raw'' and gave him the new name of [[Curtis Axel]]. On the May 27 episode of ''Raw'', Heyman appeared on the ''Highlight Reel'' with [[Chris Jericho]], where Jericho challenged CM Punk to a match at [[Payback (2013)|Payback]] which Heyman accepted on Punk's behalf. The next week, Heyman and Jericho signed the contract to make it official. The same week on ''SmackDown'', Jericho faced off against Curtis Axel. As Jericho was closing in on the victory, Heyman stood on the announcers table and yelled: \"It's clobbering time\". Punk's music began to play, distracting Jericho long enough for Axel to pick up the victory.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n[[File:Brock Lesnar with Paul Heyman.jpg|thumb|left|[[Brock Lesnar]] and Paul Heyman at [[WrestleMania 29]]]]\n\nAt Payback, Heyman coached Axel during his match with [[Wade Barrett]] and [[The Miz]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] with Axel winning the match and the title. Heyman accompanied Punk to the ring later in the show for his match with Chris Jericho. After ''Payback'', a WWE.com exclusive video aired with Punk telling Heyman that he is his friend and not his client. On the June 17 episode of ''Raw'', Punk challenged [[Alberto Del Rio]], mentioning that he did not want Heyman managing him anymore. Following Punk's match, he was attacked by Lesnar. The next week on ''Raw'', Punk demanded answers from Heyman, who swore he did not ask Lesnar to attack him. Punk forgave Heyman and then faced [[Darren Young]] and, following his win, was attacked by [[Titus O'Neil]] until Curtis Axel saved him, to Punk's chagrin. Heyman announced that he would team with Axel against [[The Prime Time Players]] the next week, again to Punk's disapproval.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAt [[Money in the Bank (2013)|Money in the Bank]], Heyman betrayed CM Punk, costing him his chance at the Money in the Bank briefcase by hitting him three times with a ladder, knocking Punk off the ladder when he was ascending. On the August 5 episode of ''Raw'', Punk retaliated by choking Heyman while Heyman was in Curtis Axel's corner during a match. This prompted Lesnar to enter the ring and attack Punk. Heyman later challenged Punk to a 1-on-1 match for the next week's ''Raw'', which Punk accepted.<ref>[http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2013-08-05/wwe-raw-results-26137732/page-9 CM Punk vs. Intercontinental Champion Curtis Axel went to a No Contest], wwe.com, August 5, 2013; retrieved May 17, 2015.</ref> However, this was revealed to be a trap when Lesnar appeared prior to the match. The plan was foiled, however, when Heyman dared CM Punk to come into the ring and accept the challenge as CM Punk, who had anticipated the trap and hid under the ring, emerged and attacked Lesnar. However, Punk failed to get his hands on Heyman as Curtis Axel came to Heyman's aid.<ref>[http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2013-08-12/wwe-raw-results-26139610/page-11 CM Punk surprised Paul Heyman and Brock Lesnar], wwe.com, August 12, 2013; retrieved May 17, 2015.</ref> This led to a match between Lesnar and Punk at [[SummerSlam (2013)|SummerSlam]], which Lesnar won after interference from Heyman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0svxTVEscaU|title=CM Punk Vs Brock Lesnar WWE SummerSlam 2013 - YouTube video,|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=|access-date=May 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=\"I think the bar was set so high with the chemistry that [[Brock Lesnar|Brock]] and I have, and the chemistry that [[CM Punk|Punk]] and I had, that it would be very difficult to match that ...

Heyman was then booked to team with Axel against CM Punk in an elimination handicap match at [[Night of Champions (2013)|Night of Champions]]. Heyman tried various times to get out of the match, which caused General Manager [[Brad Maddox]] to make the match into a no disqualification elimination handicap match. At Night of Champions, Punk eliminated Axel (who had been forced to defend his [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] against [[Kofi Kingston]] earlier in the night), leaving Heyman alone with Punk. After receiving a beating from Punk and being placed in handcuffs, just as Heyman did to Punk weeks before, Punk was about to attack Heyman with a kendo stick when [[Ryback]] interfered and cost Punk the match by putting Punk through a table.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uproxx.com/sports/2013/09/wwe-night-champions-2013-results|title=WWE Night Of Champions 2013 Results|work=UPROXX}}</ref>\n\nAt [[Battleground (2013)|Battleground]], Punk pinned Ryback after a low blow. At [[Hell in a Cell (2013)|Hell in a Cell]], Punk defeated both Ryback and Heyman and after the match attacked Heyman on top of the cell, putting an end to their feud. On the November 11, 2013 episode of ''Raw'', Heyman stated that he was no longer with Ryback as Ryback never officially accepted his proposal to become a \"Paul Heyman Guy\". After that, CM Punk came out to once again beat Heyman with a kendo stick. The following night on ''SmackDown'', Heyman formally announced to Curtis Axel and Ryback that they were no longer Paul Heyman guys, therefore marking the end of Axel's association with Heyman as he continued to team with Ryback. Heyman returned on the December 30 episode of ''Raw'' alongside Brock Lesnar, who attacked [[Mark Henry]]. He stood by Lesnar as he feuded with [[Big Show]] and [[The Undertaker]] in the first four months of 2014. Lesnar ended [[The Streak (wrestling)|The Undertaker's undefeated streak]] at [[WrestleMania XXX]]; this was Undertaker's first loss at a WrestleMania, as he previously had a record of 21 wins.\n\n[[File:Paul Heyman is the happiest man in the world.jpg|thumb|Heyman in April 2014]]\nOn the ''Raw'' following WrestleMania, [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] revealed himself to be a \"Paul Heyman Guy\".

Starr declined to further investigate the issue, and mentioned it only in a footnote of his [[Starr Report|final report]].\n\nSpeculation continued that Broaddrick had more to say on the matter, and in an interview with ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' that aired on February 24, 1999, Broaddrick discussed the matter in public for the first time, this time saying that Clinton had raped her.<ref name=\"NBCinterview\">''[[Dateline NBC]]'': February 24, 1999.

Upon his arrival, however, he allegedly requested that they instead have coffee in her room to avoid a crowd of reporters in the lobby, and Broaddrick agreed.<ref name=\"NBCinterview\" />\n\nBroaddrick said the two spoke briefly in her room, with Clinton describing plans he had to renovate a prison visible from her window if he became governor. Then, according to Broaddrick, Clinton suddenly kissed her. Broaddrick says she pushed Clinton away and told him she was married and not interested, but he persisted. As recounted in the NBC interview:<ref name=\"NBCinterview\" />\n\n{{quote|text=Then he tries to kiss me again. And the second time he tries to kiss me he starts biting my lip ... He starts to, um, bite on my top lip and I tried to pull away from him. And then he forces me down on the bed.

I was even to the point where I was getting very noisy, you know, yelling to 'Please stop.' And that's when he pressed down on my right shoulder and he would bite my lip. ... When everything was over with, he got up and straightened himself, and I was crying at the moment and he walks to the door, and calmly puts on his sunglasses. And before he goes out the door he says 'You better get some ice on that.'

It was not consensual.\"<ref name=\"NBCinterview\" />\n\nBroaddrick shared the hotel room with her friend and employee Norma Rogers. Rogers attended a conference seminar that morning, and says she returned to their room to find Broaddrick on the bed \"in a state of shock\", with her pantyhose torn in the crotch and her lip swollen as though she had been hit. Rogers says Broaddrick told her Clinton had \"forced himself on her\".<ref name=\"NYT\" /> Rogers helped Broaddrick ice her lip, and then the women left Little Rock. Rogers said that Broaddrick was very upset on the way home and blamed herself for letting Clinton in the room.<ref name=\"NBCinterview\" /> Broaddrick says she did not tell her husband, Gary Hickey, about the incident, and told him she accidentally injured her lip.

Three other friends confirmed that Broaddrick had told them about the incident at the time: Susan Lewis; Louis Ma; and Jean Darden, Norma Rogers' sister.<ref name=\"NBCinterview\" /> Broaddrick did not recall the date of the alleged incident, but said it was spring of 1978 and that she had stayed in the Camelot Hotel. Records show Broaddrick attended a nursing home meeting at the Camelot Hotel in Little Rock on April 25, 1978.<ref name=\"NBCinterview\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> The Clinton White House would not respond to requests for Clinton's official schedule for the date,<ref name=\"WashingtonPost-Feb25-1999\" /> but news reports suggest that he was in Little Rock that day, with no official commitments in the morning.<ref name=\"NBCinterview\" />\n\nThree weeks after the alleged assault, Broaddrick participated in a small Clinton fundraiser at the home of a local dentist. Broaddrick said she was \"in denial\" and felt guilty, thinking that she had given Clinton the wrong idea by letting him into her room.<ref name=\"NBCinterview\" /> When she arrived at the event, she says, her friend who had picked the Clintons up from the airport told her that [[Hillary Clinton]] had asked if she would be at the event. Broaddrick says Bill Clinton did not speak to her at the event, but Hillary Clinton approached her, took her hand, and said \"I just want you to know how much Bill and I appreciate what you do for him.\" When Broaddrick moved her hand away, she says, Hillary Clinton held on to her and said, \"Do you understand? Everything that you do.\" Broaddrick says she felt nauseated and left the gathering. Broaddrick says she interpreted the incident as Hillary Clinton thanking her for keeping quiet.<ref name=vox>{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2016/1/6/10722580/bill-clinton-juanita-broaddrick |title=The rape allegation against Bill Clinton, explained |last=Matthews |first=Dylan |date=November 14, 2017|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Abramson |first=Jill |date=October 11, 2016 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/hillary-clinton-bill-accusers-jones-willey-broaddrick |title=Did Hillary Clinton intimidate Bill's accusers?

Broaddrick had confided in Phillip Yoakum, whom she knew from business circles and at the time considered a friend. When Clinton won the Democratic nomination, Yoakum, widely considered to have a [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] agenda,<ref name=\"NYT\" /> contacted [[Sheffield Nelson]], Clinton's opponent in the 1990 gubernatorial race. Yoakum arranged a meeting between Nelson and Broaddrick, who resisted Yoakum's and Nelson's push that she go public.<ref name=WashingtonPost /> Yoakum secretly taped the conversation and wrote a letter summarizing the allegations, which began to circulate within Republican circles. The story reached ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in October 1992, but the papers dropped the story after Broaddrick refused to talk to reporters and Yoakum refused to release the recording.<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\nIn the fall of 1997, Paula Jones's private investigators tried to talk to Broaddrick at her home, also secretly taping the conversation.<ref name=Observer>Weiss, Philip.

''The Washington Post''.</ref> This, along with the discrepancy between the letter and Broaddrick's affidavit, attracted the attention of independent counsel [[Kenneth Starr]], who was investigating Clinton for obstruction of justice. After being approached by the FBI, Broaddrick consulted her son, a lawyer, who told her she could not lie to federal investigators.<ref name=\"NYT\" /> After Starr granted her [[legal immunity|immunity]], thus assuring that she would not be prosecuted for perjury regarding her affidavit in the Jones case, Broaddrick recanted the affidavit.<ref name=WashingtonPost /> However, she insisted that Clinton had not pressured or bribed her in any way, and so Starr concluded that the story was not relevant to his investigation and his report only mentioned the recanting in a footnote.<ref name=WashingtonPost />\n\n===1999===\nRumors continued to circulate in tabloids and on talk radio, now with Broaddrick's name attached. Broaddrick was upset by a tabloid report that she had been paid to keep quiet, and decided to agree to an interview with NBC's [[Lisa Myers]]. Myers interviewed her on January 20, 1999, the day after [[Impeachment and acquittal of Bill Clinton|Clinton was impeached]]. The interview only aired on February 24, 1999, 35 days later and after Clinton had been acquitted on February 12. NBC was accused of intentionally sitting on the story and invoking unusually demanding standards of corroboration until the impeachment process ended. Broaddrick and another source said NBC gathered the key corroborating evidence within 10 days of the interview, NBC assistant producer Chris Giglio said it may have taken him 14 days\u2014in either case, while the impeachment process was ongoing.<ref name=\"Observer\" /> Though the story was unaired, at least one Republican senator reportedly invoked it to convince undecided Republicans to vote for impeachment.<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\nWhile NBC waited to air the interview, Broaddrick was approached by [[Dorothy Rabinowitz]], who wrote for the ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' editorial page.

No one else was present during the alleged encounter in a Little Rock hotel room nearly 21 years ago. The hotel has since closed. And Mrs. Broaddrick denied the encounter in an affidavit in January 1998 in the Paula Jones case, in which she was known only as 'Jane Doe No. 5'. Through all those years, she refused to come forward. When pressed by the Jones lawyers, she denied the allegation. And now, she has recanted that denial.\"<ref name=NYT />\n\nIn March 1999 [[Slate magazine|''Slate'' magazine]] ran a much-cited{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} article called \"Is Juanita Broaddrick Telling the Truth?\", that gave possible grounds upon which Broaddrick should be believed, or should not be believed, regarding each of a number of key points. On the disbelief side, it was suggested that the five people who said Broaddrick had confided in them soon after the incident could be lying. This argument proposes that Rogers and Darden may have developed a grudge against Clinton; in 1980 as governor, he had commuted the life sentence of Guy Lavern Kuehn, the man who murdered their father in 1971. Skeptics also noted that even if these people were telling the truth, Broaddrick could have been lying to them at the time the original events took place.<ref name=\"Slate\" />\n\nSome details in Broaddrick's account corresponded with other women's allegations.

In an October 2016 recap of the case, [[Dylan Matthews]] of [[Vox (website)|Vox]] said: \"The basic answer is that some of the claims [against Bill Clinton] appear more credible than others.

Today, feminists have repeatedly and convincingly made the case that when women say they've been sexually assaulted, we should assume they're telling the truth.

Upon his arrival, however, he allegedly requested that they instead have coffee in her room to avoid a crowd of reporters in the lobby, and Broaddrick agreed.<ref name=\"NBCinterview\" />\n\nBroaddrick said the two spoke briefly in her room, with Clinton describing plans he had to renovate a prison visible from her window if he became governor. Then, according to Broaddrick, Clinton suddenly kissed her. Broaddrick says she pushed Clinton away and told him she was married and not interested, but he persisted. As recounted in the NBC interview:<ref name=\"NBCinterview\" />\n\n{{quote|text=Then he tries to kiss me again. And the second time he tries to kiss me he starts biting my lip ...

It was not consensual.\"<ref name=\"NBCinterview\" />\n\nBroaddrick shared the hotel room with her friend and employee Norma Rogers. Rogers attended a conference seminar that morning, and says she returned to their room to find Broaddrick on the bed \"in a state of shock\", with her pantyhose torn in the crotch and her lip swollen as though she had been hit. Rogers says Broaddrick told her Clinton had \"forced himself on her\".<ref name=\"NYT\" /> Rogers helped Broaddrick ice her lip, and then the women left Little Rock. Rogers said that Broaddrick was very upset on the way home and blamed herself for letting Clinton in the room.<ref name=\"NBCinterview\" /> Broaddrick says she did not tell her husband, Gary Hickey, about the incident, and told him she accidentally injured her lip.

Broaddrick said she was \"in denial\" and felt guilty, thinking that she had given Clinton the wrong idea by letting him into her room.<ref name=\"NBCinterview\" /> When she arrived at the event, she says, her friend who had picked the Clintons up from the airport told her that [[Hillary Clinton]] had asked if she would be at the event. Broaddrick says Bill Clinton did not speak to her at the event, but Hillary Clinton approached her, took her hand, and said \"I just want you to know how much Bill and I appreciate what you do for him.\" When Broaddrick moved her hand away, she says, Hillary Clinton held on to her and said, \"Do you understand?

Broaddrick had confided in Phillip Yoakum, whom she knew from business circles and at the time considered a friend. When Clinton won the Democratic nomination, Yoakum, widely considered to have a [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] agenda,<ref name=\"NYT\" /> contacted [[Sheffield Nelson]], Clinton's opponent in the 1990 gubernatorial race. Yoakum arranged a meeting between Nelson and Broaddrick, who resisted Yoakum's and Nelson's push that she go public.<ref name=WashingtonPost /> Yoakum secretly taped the conversation and wrote a letter summarizing the allegations, which began to circulate within Republican circles.

Broaddrick was upset by a tabloid report that she had been paid to keep quiet, and decided to agree to an interview with NBC's [[Lisa Myers]]. Myers interviewed her on January 20, 1999, the day after [[Impeachment and acquittal of Bill Clinton|Clinton was impeached]]. The interview only aired on February 24, 1999, 35 days later and after Clinton had been acquitted on February 12. NBC was accused of intentionally sitting on the story and invoking unusually demanding standards of corroboration until the impeachment process ended. Broaddrick and another source said NBC gathered the key corroborating evidence within 10 days of the interview, NBC assistant producer Chris Giglio said it may have taken him 14 days\u2014in either case, while the impeachment process was ongoing.<ref name=\"Observer\" /> Though the story was unaired, at least one Republican senator reportedly invoked it to convince undecided Republicans to vote for impeachment.<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\nWhile NBC waited to air the interview, Broaddrick was approached by [[Dorothy Rabinowitz]], who wrote for the ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' editorial page. Upset with NBC's delay, Broaddrick agreed to speak with Rabinowitz, and the story debuted on the ''Wall Street Journal'''s editorial page on February 19.<ref name=rabin/> NBC aired Myers' interview soon after.\n\n===Clinton response to allegations===\nOn Friday night, February 19, 1999, Clinton's attorney, [[David E.

And Mrs. Broaddrick denied the encounter in an affidavit in January 1998 in the Paula Jones case, in which she was known only as 'Jane Doe No. 5'. Through all those years, she refused to come forward. When pressed by the Jones lawyers, she denied the allegation. And now, she has recanted that denial.\"<ref name=NYT />\n\nIn March 1999 [[Slate magazine|''Slate'' magazine]] ran a much-cited{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} article called \"Is Juanita Broaddrick Telling the Truth?\", that gave possible grounds upon which Broaddrick should be believed, or should not be believed, regarding each of a number of key points. On the disbelief side, it was suggested that the five people who said Broaddrick had confided in them soon after the incident could be lying. This argument proposes that Rogers and Darden may have developed a grudge against Clinton; in 1980 as governor, he had commuted the life sentence of Guy Lavern Kuehn, the man who murdered their father in 1971. Skeptics also noted that even if these people were telling the truth, Broaddrick could have been lying to them at the time the original events took place.<ref name=\"Slate\" />\n\nSome details in Broaddrick's account corresponded with other women's allegations. In an interview that emerged after Broaddrick's allegations, [[Elizabeth Gracen]] had said that Clinton bit her lip during a consensual encounter that became rough.<ref>Isikoff, Michael (May 30, 2000). ''Uncovering Clinton''. Three Rivers Press. p. 256</ref>\n\nBroaddrick said that after the assault, Clinton told her not to worry about pregnancy because childhood [[mumps]] had rendered him sterile.<ref name=rabin /> When contacted about the issue, [[Gennifer Flowers]], who Clinton later admitted to a sexual relationship with, also said that Clinton had thought he couldn't have children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/a-case-of-the-mumps|title=A Case of the Mumps?|last=|first=|date=1999-02-20|website=The Weekly Standard|publisher=|language=en-US|via=\"Washington Examiner\", whose parent company bought Weekly Standard in 2009 and subsumed its content in 2019.|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1999, shortly after the allegations publicly aired, 56% of Americans believed the allegations were false, while a third believed that Broaddrick's allegation of rape was at least possibly true.

(1872\u20131923).{{sfn|Unger|1997}}\n\nShe was educated at [[Norwich High School for Girls]], then boarding schools in [[Clevedon]], Somerset and [[Peterborough]] (Laurel Court).{{sfn|Grant|1995|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nAfter a period as a governess, including for a family in [[Brussels]] from 1890 to 1895, she returned home to care for her father during a serious illness. The experience led her to become a nurse after her father's recovery.{{sfn|Daunton|1990|p=1}} In April 1896, at the age of 30, Cavell applied to become a nurse probationer at the [[Royal London Hospital|London Hospital]]{{sfn|Grant|1995|pp=5\u20136}} under Matron [[Eva Luckes]]. She worked in various hospitals in England, including [[St Leonard's Hospital, Hackney|Shoreditch Infirmary]]{{sfn|Grant|1995|p=8}} (since renamed St Leonard's Hospital). As a private travelling nurse, treating patients in their homes, Cavell travelled to tend patients with cancer, gout, pneumonia, pleurisy, eye issues and appendicitis.{{sfn|Daunton|1990|p=1}}\n\nCavell was sent to assist with the [[typhoid]] outbreak in [[Maidstone]] during 1897.  Along with other staff she was awarded the Maidstone Medal.{{sfn|Gazet|2015}}\n\nIn 1907, Cavell was recruited by Dr [[Antoine Depage]] to be [[matron]] of a newly established nursing school, L'\u00c9cole Belge d'Infirmi\u00e8res Dipl\u00f4m\u00e9es (or the Berkendael Medical Institute) on the Rue de la Culture (now Rue Franz Merjay), in [[Ixelles]], Brussels.{{sfn|Judson|1941}} By 1910, \"Miss Cavell 'felt that the profession of nursing had gained sufficient foothold in Belgium to warrant the publishing of a professional journal' and, therefore, launched the nursing journal, ''L'infirmi\u00e8re''\".{{sfn|Judson|1941}} Within a year, she was training nurses for three hospitals, twenty-four schools, and thirteen kindergartens in Belgium.\n\nWhen the First World War broke out, she was visiting her widowed mother in Norfolk. She returned to Brussels, where her clinic and nursing school were taken over by the [[Red Cross]].\n\n== Return to Brussels ==\nCavell had been offered a position as matron in a Brussels clinic. She worked closely with Dr Depage who was part of a \"growing body of people\" in the medical profession in Belgium. He realised that the care that was being provided by the religious institutions had not been keeping up with medical advances. In 1910, Cavell was asked if she would be the matron for the new secular hospital at [[Saint-Gilles, Belgium|Saint-Gilles]].{{sfn|Daunton|1990|p=3}}\n\n== First World War and execution ==\n\nIn November 1914, after the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|German occupation of Brussels]], Cavell began sheltering British soldiers and funnelling them out of occupied Belgium to the neutral Netherlands. Wounded British and French soldiers as well as Belgian and French civilians of military age were hidden from the Germans and provided with false papers by Prince R\u00e9ginald [[House of Cro\u00ff|de Cro\u00ff]] at his ch\u00e2teau of [[Bellignies]] near Mons. From there, they were conducted by various guides to the houses of Cavell, Louis S\u00e9verin, and others in Brussels, where their hosts would furnish them with money to reach the Dutch frontier, and provide them with guides obtained through Philippe Baucq.{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1922}} This placed Cavell in violation of [[German military law]].{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}}{{sfn|Scovil|1915}} German authorities became increasingly suspicious of the nurse's actions, which were further fuelled by her outspokenness.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}}\n\nShe was arrested on 3 August 1915 and charged with harbouring Allied soldiers. She had been betrayed by [[Georges Gaston Quien]], who was later convicted by a French court as a collaborator.{{sfn|The Mount Washington News|1934}}{{sfn|Palm Beach Daily News|1936}} She was held in Saint-Gilles prison for ten weeks, the last two of which were spent in solitary confinement.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} She made three depositions to the German police (on 8, 18 and 22 August), admitting that she had been instrumental in conveying about 60 British and 15 French soldiers, as well as about 100 French and Belgian civilians of military age, to the frontier and had sheltered most of them in her house.{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1922}}\n\nAt her [[court-martial]], she was prosecuted for aiding British and French soldiers, in addition to young Belgian men, to cross the Dutch border and eventually enter Britain. She admitted her guilt when she signed a statement the day before the trial. Cavell declared that the soldiers she had helped escape thanked her in writing when they arrived safely in Britain. This admission confirmed that Cavell had helped the soldiers navigate the Dutch frontier, but it also established that she helped them escape to a country at war with Germany.{{sfn|Duffy|2009}} Her fellow defendants included Prince Reginald's sister, [[Princess Marie of Cro\u00ff]].\n\nThe penalty, according to German military law, was death. Paragraph 58 of the German Military Code determined that \"at time of war, anyone who with the intention of aiding a hostile power, or of causing harm to the German or allied troops\" commits any of the crimes defined in paragraph 90 of the German Penal Code \"shall be punished with death for war treason\". Specifically, Cavell was charged under paragraph 90 (1) no. 3 ''Reichsstrafgesetzbuch'', for \"conveying troops to the enemy\", a crime normally punishable by life imprisonment in peacetime.{{sfn|Duffy|2009}} It was possible to charge Cavell with war treason as paragraph 160 of the German Military Code extended application of paragraph 58 to foreigners \"present in the zone of war\".\n[[File:C. 1916 Edith Cavell propaganda stamp.JPG|thumbnail|right|A [[cinderella stamp|propaganda stamp]] issued shortly after Cavell's death]]\nWhile the [[First Geneva Convention]] ordinarily guaranteed protection of medical personnel, that protection was forfeit if used as cover for any belligerent action. This forfeiture is expressed in article 7 of the 1906 version of the Convention, which was the version in force at the time,{{sfn|Bevans|1968|p=972}} and justified prosecution on the basis of German law.\n\nThe British government could do nothing to help her. Sir Horace Rowland of the [[Foreign Office]] said, \"I am afraid that it is likely to go hard with Miss Cavell; I am afraid we are powerless.\"{{sfn|Norton-Taylor|2005}} [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil]], Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, advised that, \"Any representation by us will do her more harm than good.\"{{sfn|Norton-Taylor|2005}} The [[United States]], however, had not yet joined the war and was in a position to apply diplomatic pressure. [[Hugh S. Gibson]], First Secretary of the U.S. legation at Brussels, made clear to the German government that executing Cavell would further harm Germany's already damaged reputation. Later, he wrote:{{sfn|Gibson|1917}}\n\n{{Quote|We reminded [German civil governor Baron von der Lancken] of the burning of [[Leuven|Louvain]] and the sinking of the ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'', and told him that this murder would rank with those two affairs and would stir all civilised countries with horror and disgust. Count Harrach broke in at this with the rather irrelevant remark that he would rather see Miss Cavell shot than have harm come to the humblest German soldier, and his only regret was that they had not \"three or four old English women to shoot.\"}}\n\nBaron von der Lancken is known to have stated that Cavell should be pardoned because of her complete honesty and because she had helped save so many lives, German as well as Allied. However, [[Traugott von Sauberzweig|General von Sauberzweig]], the military governor of Brussels, ordered that \"in the interests of the State\" the implementation of the death penalty against Baucq and Cavell should be immediate,{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1922}} denying higher authorities an opportunity to consider clemency.{{sfn|Scovil|1915}}{{sfn|Hughes|2005}} Cavell was defended by lawyer Sadi Kirschen from Brussels. Of the twenty-seven defendants, five were condemned to death: Cavell, Baucq (an architect in his thirties), [[Louise Thuliez]], S\u00e9verin and Countess Jeanne de Belleville. Of the five sentenced to death, only Cavell and Baucq were executed; the other three were granted reprieve.{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1922}}\n\nCavell was arrested not for espionage, as many were led to believe, but for \"war treason\", despite not being a German national.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} She may have been recruited by the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS), and turned away from her espionage duties in order to help Allied soldiers escape, although this is not widely accepted.{{sfn|Rankin|2008|p=36\u201337}} Rankin cites the published statement of [[M. R. D. Foot]], historian and Second World War British intelligence officer, as to Cavell having been part of SIS or MI6.{{sfn|Watson|2014|}} The former director-general of MI5, [[Stella Rimington]], announced in 2015 that she had unearthed documents in Belgian military archives that confirmed an intelligence gathering aspect to Cavell's network. The [[BBC Radio 4]] programme that presented Rimington's quote, noted Cavell's use of secret codes and, though amateurish, other network members' successful transmission of intelligence.{{sfn|Singh|2015}}\n\nWhen in custody, Cavell was questioned in French, but her trial was minuted in German; which some assert gave the prosecutor the opportunity to misinterpret her answers. Although she may have been misrepresented, she made no attempt to defend herself, but responded to have channelled \"''environ deux cents''\" soldiers to the Dutch border. Cavell was provided with a defender approved by the German military governor; a previous defender, who was chosen for Cavell by her assistant, Elizabeth Wilkins,{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} was ultimately rejected by the governor.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}}\n\n[[File:Bellows, George Wesley, The Murder of Edith Cavell, 1918.jpg|thumb|[[George Bellows]], ''The Murder of Edith Cavell'', 1918, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]\n\nThe night before her execution, she told the Reverend Stirling Gahan, the Anglican chaplain who had been allowed to see her and to give her [[Holy Communion]], \"Patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone.\"{{sfn|Gahan|1925|pp=288\u201389}} These words are inscribed on her statue on St Martin's Place (A400) <ref>https://www.bing.com/maps?q=london+st+martin-in-the-fields&form=EDNTHT&mkt=en-us&httpsmsn=1&refig=9991d5b68a0149a3c5e1e5caf1d8d7bb&sp=3&qs=SC&pq=london+st+martin%27&sk=PRES1AS2&sc=8-17&cvid=9991d5b68a0149a3c5e1e5caf1d8d7bb&cc=US&setlang=en-US</ref>, northeast of [[Trafalgar Square]] in London.  Her final words to the German [[Lutheran]] prison chaplain, Paul Le Seur, were recorded as, \"Ask Father Gahan to tell my loved ones later on that my soul, as I believe, is safe, and that I am glad to die for my country.\"{{sfn|Peterson|2018}}\n\nFrom his sick bed [[Brand Whitlock]], the U.S. ambassador to Belgium, wrote a personal note on Cavell's behalf to [[Moritz von Bissing]], the Governor-General of Belgium. Hugh Gibson; Maitre G. de Leval, the legal adviser to the United States legation; and {{ill|Rodrigo Saavedra y Vinent|es}}, 2nd Marques de Villalobar, the Spanish minister, formed a midnight deputation of appeal for mercy or at least postponement of execution.{{sfn|Encyclopedia Americana|1920}} Despite these efforts, on 11 October, Baron von der Lancken allowed the execution to proceed.{{sfn|Scovil|1915}} Sixteen men, forming two firing squads, carried out the sentence pronounced on her and on four Belgian men at the [[Tir national]]{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} shooting range in [[Schaerbeek]], at 7:00{{nbsp}}am on 12 October 1915. There are conflicting reports of the details of Cavell's execution. However, according to the eyewitness account of the Reverend Le Seur, who attended Cavell in her final hours, eight soldiers fired at Cavell while the other eight executed Baucq.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} Her execution, certification of death, and burial were all witnessed by the German poet [[Gottfried Benn]] in his capacity as a 'Senior Doctor in the Brussels Government since the first days of the (German) occupation'. Benn wrote a detailed account titled \"Wie Miss Cavell erschossen wurde\" (''How Miss Cavell was shot'', 1928).{{sfn|Benn|2013}}\n\nThere is also a dispute over the sentencing imposed under the German Military Code. Supposedly, the death penalty relevant to the offence committed by Cavell was not officially declared until a few hours after her death.{{sfn|Judson|1941}} The British post-war Committee of Enquiry into Breaches of the Laws of War however regarded the verdict as legally correct.{{sfn|Macdonell|1920|p=424}}\n\nOn instructions from the Spanish minister, Belgian women immediately buried her body next to Saint-Gilles Prison.{{sfn|Scovil|1915}} After the war, her body was taken back to Britain for a memorial service at [[Westminster Abbey]] and then transferred to Norwich, to be laid to rest at Life's Green on the east side of the cathedral. The King had to grant an exception to an [[Order in Council]] of 1854, which prevented any burials in the grounds of the cathedral, to allow the reburial.{{sfn|Gazette|31332}}\n\n== First World War propaganda ==\n{{see also| British propaganda during World War I}}\n[[File:British Empire Union WWI poster.jpg|thumb|An anti-German post-First World War poster from the [[British Empire Union]], including Cavell's grave]]\n[[File:The Cavell Case.jpg|thumb|''The Cavell Case'' (1919), an American film]]\n[[File:Edith Cavell - Uccle.jpg|thumb|Edith Cavell ([[Uccle]] 2015), by Nathalie Lambert]]\nIn the months and years following Cavell's death, countless newspaper articles, pamphlets, images, and books publicised her story. She became an iconic propaganda figure for military recruitment in Britain, and to help increase favourable sentiment towards the Allies in the United States. She was a popular icon because of her sex, her nursing profession, and her apparently heroic approach to death.{{sfn|Judson|1941}}  Her execution was represented as an act of German barbarism and moral depravity.\n\nNews reports shortly following Cavell's execution were found to be only true in part.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} Even the ''[[American Journal of Nursing]]'' repeated the fictional account of Cavell's execution in which she fainted and fell because of her refusal to wear a blindfold in front of the firing squad.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} Allegedly, while she lay unconscious, the German commanding officer shot her dead with a revolver.{{sfn|Scovil|1915}}  Along with the invasion of Belgium, and the sinking of the ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'', Cavell's execution was widely publicised in both Britain and North America by [[Wellington House]], the British War Propaganda Bureau.{{sfn|Peterson|1939|p=61}}\n\nBecause of the British government's decision to publicise Cavell's story as part of its propaganda effort, she became the most prominent British female casualty of the First World War.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}}  The combination of heroic appeal and a resonant atrocity-story narrative made Cavell's case one of the most effective in British propaganda of the First World War.{{sfn|Peterson|1939|p=61}}\n\nBefore the First World War, Cavell was not well known outside nursing circles.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} This allowed two different depictions of the truth about her in British [[propaganda]], which were a reply to enemy attempts to justify her shooting, including the suggestion that Cavell, during her interrogation, had given information that incriminated others. In November 1915, the British Foreign Office issued a denial that Cavell had implicated anyone else in her testimony.\n\nOne image commonly represented was of Cavell as an innocent victim of a ruthless and dishonourable enemy.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}} This view depicted her as having helped Allied soldiers to escape, but innocent of 'espionage', and was most commonly used in various forms of British propaganda, such as postcards and newspaper illustrations during the war.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}}  Her story was presented in the British press as a means of fuelling a desire for revenge on the battlefield.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}} These images implied that men must enlist in the armed forces immediately in order to stop forces that could arrange the judicial murder of an innocent British woman.\n\nAnother representation of a side of Cavell during the First World War saw her described as a serious, reserved, brave, and patriotic woman who devoted her life to nursing and died to save others. This portrayal has been illustrated in numerous biographical sources, from personal first-hand experiences of the Red Cross nurse. Pastor Le Seur, the German army chaplain, recalled at the time of her execution, \"I do not believe that Miss Cavell wanted to be a [[martyr]]{{nbsp}}... but she was ready to die for her country{{nbsp}}...  Miss Cavell was a very brave woman and a faithful [[Christians|Christian]]\".{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} Another account from Anglican chaplain, the Reverend Gahan, remembers Cavell's words, \"I have no fear or shrinking; I have seen death so often it is not strange, or fearful to me!\"{{sfn|Scovil|1915}} In this interpretation, her stoicism was seen as remarkable for a non-combatant woman, and brought her even greater renown than a man in similar circumstances would have received.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}}\n\n== German response ==\n\nThe Imperial German Government thought that it had acted fairly towards Cavell. In a letter, German Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs, Dr Alfred Zimmermann (not to be confused with [[Arthur Zimmermann]], German Secretary for Foreign Affairs) made a statement to the press on behalf of the German government:\n\n{{quote|It was a pity that Miss Cavell had to be executed, but it was necessary. She was judged justly ... It is undoubtedly a terrible thing that the woman has been executed; but consider what would happen to a State, particularly in war, if it left crimes aimed at the safety of its armies to go unpunished because they were committed by women.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1916|p=481}}}}\nFrom the perspective of the German government, had it released Cavell there might have been a surge in the number of women participating in acts against Germany because they knew they would not be severely punished. It took the view that it was up to the responsible men to follow their legal duty to Germany and ignore the world's condemnation. Its laws did not make distinctions between sexes; the only exception to this being that, according to legal customs, women in a \"delicate\" (probably this means \"pregnant\") condition should not be executed.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1916|p=481}} However, in January 1916, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|the Kaiser]] decreed that, from then, on capital punishment should not be carried out on women without his explicit prior endorsement.{{sfn|Hull|2014|pp=108\u201309}}\n\nThe German government also believed that all of the convicted people were thoroughly aware of the nature of their acts. The court paid particular attention to this point, releasing several people because there was doubt as to whether the accused knew that their actions were punishable.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1916|p=481}} The condemned, in contrast, knew full well what they were doing and the punishment for committing their crimes because \"numerous public proclamations had pointed out the fact that aiding enemies\u2019 armies was punishable with death.\"{{sfn|Zimmermann|1916|p=481}} The Allied response to this was the same as to [[Bethmann-Hollweg]]'s announcement of the invasion of Belgium, or the notice given in the papers of intent to sink such ships as the {{RMS|Lusitania}}; to make a public proclamation of a thing does not make it right.\n\n== Burial and memorials ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}<!--many of the list items are not cited-->\n[[File:Edith Cavell monument.JPG|thumb|Memorial to Cavell outside [[Norwich Cathedral]]]]\n[[File:XII Execution of Edith Cavell painting by Brian Whelan 2015.jpg|thumb|''XII \u2013 Execution of Edith Cavell'', one of 14 paintings on Cavell by [[Brian Whelan]] in [[Norwich Cathedral]]]]\n[[File:Edith Cavel Memorial - statue.jpg|thumb|alt=A marble statue of Edith Cavell in nurse's uniform backed by a large granite column|Detail of the [[Edith Cavell Memorial]], St Martin's Place, London]]\n[[File:Schaerbeek Rue Colonel Bourg Enclos des fusill\u00e9s 02.jpg|thumb|War memorial in Rue Colonel Bourg, [[Schaerbeek]] including Cavell's name]]\n[[File:Monument Cavell-Depage Bxl.JPG|thumb|Monument to Edith Cavell and [[Marie Depage]], Brussels]]\n[[File:CavellVanQEIIJ60.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Cavell Van]] at [[Bodiam railway station]]]]\n\nCavell's remains were returned to Britain after the war.

This is a memorial in her honour rather than formal [[canonisation]], and so not a \"saint's feast day\" in the traditional sense.\n\nFollowing Cavell's death, many memorials were created around the world to remember her. A patriotic song, \"Remember Nurse Cavell\" (words by Gordon V. Thompson, music by Jules Brazil) appeared with 1915 British copyright. The name [[Mount Edith Cavell]] was given in 1916 to a massive peak in Canada's Jasper National Park.

She is celebrated for saving the lives of soldiers from both sides without discrimination and in helping some 200 Allied soldiers escape from German-occupied Belgium during the [[World War I|First World War]], for which she was arrested. She was accused of [[treason]], found guilty by a [[court-martial]] and sentenced to death.  Despite international pressure for mercy, she was shot by a German firing squad. Her execution received worldwide condemnation and extensive press coverage.\n\nThe night before her execution, she said, \"Patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone.\" These words were later inscribed on a memorial to her near [[Trafalgar Square]]. Her strong [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] beliefs propelled her to help all those who needed it, both German and Allied soldiers. She was quoted as saying, \"I can\u2019t stop while there are lives to be saved.\"{{sfn|Judson|1941}} The [[Church of England]] commemorates her in its Calendar of Saints on 12 October.\n\nCavell, who was 49 at the time of her execution, was already notable as a pioneer of modern nursing in Belgium.\n\n== Early life and career ==\n\n[[File:Nurse Edith Cavell 1865-1915 Q32930.jpg|right|thumbnail|Cavell in a garden in Brussels with her two dogs before the outbreak of war]]\n[[File:Nurse Edith Cavell 1865-1915; Brussels Q70204.jpg|thumb|Cavell (seated centre) with a group of multinational student nurses whom she trained in Brussels]]\nCavell was born on 4 December 1865{{sfn|Unger|1997}} in [[Swardeston]], a village near [[Norwich]], where her father was vicar for 45 years.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} She was the eldest of the four children of the Reverend Frederick Cavell (1824\u20131910) and his wife Louisa Sophia Warming (1835\u20131918). Edith's siblings were; Florence Mary (b. 1867), Mary Lilian (b. 1870) and John Frederick S. (1872\u20131923).{{sfn|Unger|1997}}\n\nShe was educated at [[Norwich High School for Girls]], then boarding schools in [[Clevedon]], Somerset and [[Peterborough]] (Laurel Court).{{sfn|Grant|1995|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nAfter a period as a governess, including for a family in [[Brussels]] from 1890 to 1895, she returned home to care for her father during a serious illness. The experience led her to become a nurse after her father's recovery.{{sfn|Daunton|1990|p=1}} In April 1896, at the age of 30, Cavell applied to become a nurse probationer at the [[Royal London Hospital|London Hospital]]{{sfn|Grant|1995|pp=5\u20136}} under Matron [[Eva Luckes]]. She worked in various hospitals in England, including [[St Leonard's Hospital, Hackney|Shoreditch Infirmary]]{{sfn|Grant|1995|p=8}} (since renamed St Leonard's Hospital). As a private travelling nurse, treating patients in their homes, Cavell travelled to tend patients with cancer, gout, pneumonia, pleurisy, eye issues and appendicitis.{{sfn|Daunton|1990|p=1}}\n\nCavell was sent to assist with the [[typhoid]] outbreak in [[Maidstone]] during 1897.  Along with other staff she was awarded the Maidstone Medal.{{sfn|Gazet|2015}}\n\nIn 1907, Cavell was recruited by Dr [[Antoine Depage]] to be [[matron]] of a newly established nursing school, L'\u00c9cole Belge d'Infirmi\u00e8res Dipl\u00f4m\u00e9es (or the Berkendael Medical Institute) on the Rue de la Culture (now Rue Franz Merjay), in [[Ixelles]], Brussels.{{sfn|Judson|1941}} By 1910, \"Miss Cavell 'felt that the profession of nursing had gained sufficient foothold in Belgium to warrant the publishing of a professional journal' and, therefore, launched the nursing journal, ''L'infirmi\u00e8re''\".{{sfn|Judson|1941}} Within a year, she was training nurses for three hospitals, twenty-four schools, and thirteen kindergartens in Belgium.\n\nWhen the First World War broke out, she was visiting her widowed mother in Norfolk. She returned to Brussels, where her clinic and nursing school were taken over by the [[Red Cross]].\n\n== Return to Brussels ==\nCavell had been offered a position as matron in a Brussels clinic. She worked closely with Dr Depage who was part of a \"growing body of people\" in the medical profession in Belgium. He realised that the care that was being provided by the religious institutions had not been keeping up with medical advances. In 1910, Cavell was asked if she would be the matron for the new secular hospital at [[Saint-Gilles, Belgium|Saint-Gilles]].{{sfn|Daunton|1990|p=3}}\n\n== First World War and execution ==\n\nIn November 1914, after the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|German occupation of Brussels]], Cavell began sheltering British soldiers and funnelling them out of occupied Belgium to the neutral Netherlands. Wounded British and French soldiers as well as Belgian and French civilians of military age were hidden from the Germans and provided with false papers by Prince R\u00e9ginald [[House of Cro\u00ff|de Cro\u00ff]] at his ch\u00e2teau of [[Bellignies]] near Mons. From there, they were conducted by various guides to the houses of Cavell, Louis S\u00e9verin, and others in Brussels, where their hosts would furnish them with money to reach the Dutch frontier, and provide them with guides obtained through Philippe Baucq.{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1922}} This placed Cavell in violation of [[German military law]].{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}}{{sfn|Scovil|1915}} German authorities became increasingly suspicious of the nurse's actions, which were further fuelled by her outspokenness.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}}\n\nShe was arrested on 3 August 1915 and charged with harbouring Allied soldiers. She had been betrayed by [[Georges Gaston Quien]], who was later convicted by a French court as a collaborator.{{sfn|The Mount Washington News|1934}}{{sfn|Palm Beach Daily News|1936}} She was held in Saint-Gilles prison for ten weeks, the last two of which were spent in solitary confinement.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} She made three depositions to the German police (on 8, 18 and 22 August), admitting that she had been instrumental in conveying about 60 British and 15 French soldiers, as well as about 100 French and Belgian civilians of military age, to the frontier and had sheltered most of them in her house.{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1922}}\n\nAt her [[court-martial]], she was prosecuted for aiding British and French soldiers, in addition to young Belgian men, to cross the Dutch border and eventually enter Britain. She admitted her guilt when she signed a statement the day before the trial. Cavell declared that the soldiers she had helped escape thanked her in writing when they arrived safely in Britain. This admission confirmed that Cavell had helped the soldiers navigate the Dutch frontier, but it also established that she helped them escape to a country at war with Germany.{{sfn|Duffy|2009}} Her fellow defendants included Prince Reginald's sister, [[Princess Marie of Cro\u00ff]].\n\nThe penalty, according to German military law, was death. Paragraph 58 of the German Military Code determined that \"at time of war, anyone who with the intention of aiding a hostile power, or of causing harm to the German or allied troops\" commits any of the crimes defined in paragraph 90 of the German Penal Code \"shall be punished with death for war treason\". Specifically, Cavell was charged under paragraph 90 (1) no. 3 ''Reichsstrafgesetzbuch'', for \"conveying troops to the enemy\", a crime normally punishable by life imprisonment in peacetime.{{sfn|Duffy|2009}} It was possible to charge Cavell with war treason as paragraph 160 of the German Military Code extended application of paragraph 58 to foreigners \"present in the zone of war\".\n[[File:C. 1916 Edith Cavell propaganda stamp.JPG|thumbnail|right|A [[cinderella stamp|propaganda stamp]] issued shortly after Cavell's death]]\nWhile the [[First Geneva Convention]] ordinarily guaranteed protection of medical personnel, that protection was forfeit if used as cover for any belligerent action. This forfeiture is expressed in article 7 of the 1906 version of the Convention, which was the version in force at the time,{{sfn|Bevans|1968|p=972}} and justified prosecution on the basis of German law.\n\nThe British government could do nothing to help her. Sir Horace Rowland of the [[Foreign Office]] said, \"I am afraid that it is likely to go hard with Miss Cavell; I am afraid we are powerless.\"{{sfn|Norton-Taylor|2005}} [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil]], Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, advised that, \"Any representation by us will do her more harm than good.\"{{sfn|Norton-Taylor|2005}} The [[United States]], however, had not yet joined the war and was in a position to apply diplomatic pressure. [[Hugh S. Gibson]], First Secretary of the U.S. legation at Brussels, made clear to the German government that executing Cavell would further harm Germany's already damaged reputation. Later, he wrote:{{sfn|Gibson|1917}}\n\n{{Quote|We reminded [German civil governor Baron von der Lancken] of the burning of [[Leuven|Louvain]] and the sinking of the ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'', and told him that this murder would rank with those two affairs and would stir all civilised countries with horror and disgust. Count Harrach broke in at this with the rather irrelevant remark that he would rather see Miss Cavell shot than have harm come to the humblest German soldier, and his only regret was that they had not \"three or four old English women to shoot.\"}}\n\nBaron von der Lancken is known to have stated that Cavell should be pardoned because of her complete honesty and because she had helped save so many lives, German as well as Allied. However, [[Traugott von Sauberzweig|General von Sauberzweig]], the military governor of Brussels, ordered that \"in the interests of the State\" the implementation of the death penalty against Baucq and Cavell should be immediate,{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1922}} denying higher authorities an opportunity to consider clemency.{{sfn|Scovil|1915}}{{sfn|Hughes|2005}} Cavell was defended by lawyer Sadi Kirschen from Brussels. Of the twenty-seven defendants, five were condemned to death: Cavell, Baucq (an architect in his thirties), [[Louise Thuliez]], S\u00e9verin and Countess Jeanne de Belleville. Of the five sentenced to death, only Cavell and Baucq were executed; the other three were granted reprieve.{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1922}}\n\nCavell was arrested not for espionage, as many were led to believe, but for \"war treason\", despite not being a German national.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} She may have been recruited by the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS), and turned away from her espionage duties in order to help Allied soldiers escape, although this is not widely accepted.{{sfn|Rankin|2008|p=36\u201337}} Rankin cites the published statement of [[M. R. D. Foot]], historian and Second World War British intelligence officer, as to Cavell having been part of SIS or MI6.{{sfn|Watson|2014|}} The former director-general of MI5, [[Stella Rimington]], announced in 2015 that she had unearthed documents in Belgian military archives that confirmed an intelligence gathering aspect to Cavell's network. The [[BBC Radio 4]] programme that presented Rimington's quote, noted Cavell's use of secret codes and, though amateurish, other network members' successful transmission of intelligence.{{sfn|Singh|2015}}\n\nWhen in custody, Cavell was questioned in French, but her trial was minuted in German; which some assert gave the prosecutor the opportunity to misinterpret her answers. Although she may have been misrepresented, she made no attempt to defend herself, but responded to have channelled \"''environ deux cents''\" soldiers to the Dutch border. Cavell was provided with a defender approved by the German military governor; a previous defender, who was chosen for Cavell by her assistant, Elizabeth Wilkins,{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} was ultimately rejected by the governor.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}}\n\n[[File:Bellows, George Wesley, The Murder of Edith Cavell, 1918.jpg|thumb|[[George Bellows]], ''The Murder of Edith Cavell'', 1918, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]\n\nThe night before her execution, she told the Reverend Stirling Gahan, the Anglican chaplain who had been allowed to see her and to give her [[Holy Communion]], \"Patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone.\"{{sfn|Gahan|1925|pp=288\u201389}} These words are inscribed on her statue on St Martin's Place (A400) <ref>https://www.bing.com/maps?q=london+st+martin-in-the-fields&form=EDNTHT&mkt=en-us&httpsmsn=1&refig=9991d5b68a0149a3c5e1e5caf1d8d7bb&sp=3&qs=SC&pq=london+st+martin%27&sk=PRES1AS2&sc=8-17&cvid=9991d5b68a0149a3c5e1e5caf1d8d7bb&cc=US&setlang=en-US</ref>, northeast of [[Trafalgar Square]] in London.  Her final words to the German [[Lutheran]] prison chaplain, Paul Le Seur, were recorded as, \"Ask Father Gahan to tell my loved ones later on that my soul, as I believe, is safe, and that I am glad to die for my country.\"{{sfn|Peterson|2018}}\n\nFrom his sick bed [[Brand Whitlock]], the U.S. ambassador to Belgium, wrote a personal note on Cavell's behalf to [[Moritz von Bissing]], the Governor-General of Belgium. Hugh Gibson; Maitre G. de Leval, the legal adviser to the United States legation; and {{ill|Rodrigo Saavedra y Vinent|es}}, 2nd Marques de Villalobar, the Spanish minister, formed a midnight deputation of appeal for mercy or at least postponement of execution.{{sfn|Encyclopedia Americana|1920}} Despite these efforts, on 11 October, Baron von der Lancken allowed the execution to proceed.{{sfn|Scovil|1915}} Sixteen men, forming two firing squads, carried out the sentence pronounced on her and on four Belgian men at the [[Tir national]]{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} shooting range in [[Schaerbeek]], at 7:00{{nbsp}}am on 12 October 1915. There are conflicting reports of the details of Cavell's execution. However, according to the eyewitness account of the Reverend Le Seur, who attended Cavell in her final hours, eight soldiers fired at Cavell while the other eight executed Baucq.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} Her execution, certification of death, and burial were all witnessed by the German poet [[Gottfried Benn]] in his capacity as a 'Senior Doctor in the Brussels Government since the first days of the (German) occupation'. Benn wrote a detailed account titled \"Wie Miss Cavell erschossen wurde\" (''How Miss Cavell was shot'', 1928).{{sfn|Benn|2013}}\n\nThere is also a dispute over the sentencing imposed under the German Military Code. Supposedly, the death penalty relevant to the offence committed by Cavell was not officially declared until a few hours after her death.{{sfn|Judson|1941}} The British post-war Committee of Enquiry into Breaches of the Laws of War however regarded the verdict as legally correct.{{sfn|Macdonell|1920|p=424}}\n\nOn instructions from the Spanish minister, Belgian women immediately buried her body next to Saint-Gilles Prison.{{sfn|Scovil|1915}} After the war, her body was taken back to Britain for a memorial service at [[Westminster Abbey]] and then transferred to Norwich, to be laid to rest at Life's Green on the east side of the cathedral. The King had to grant an exception to an [[Order in Council]] of 1854, which prevented any burials in the grounds of the cathedral, to allow the reburial.{{sfn|Gazette|31332}}\n\n== First World War propaganda ==\n{{see also| British propaganda during World War I}}\n[[File:British Empire Union WWI poster.jpg|thumb|An anti-German post-First World War poster from the [[British Empire Union]], including Cavell's grave]]\n[[File:The Cavell Case.jpg|thumb|''The Cavell Case'' (1919), an American film]]\n[[File:Edith Cavell - Uccle.jpg|thumb|Edith Cavell ([[Uccle]] 2015), by Nathalie Lambert]]\nIn the months and years following Cavell's death, countless newspaper articles, pamphlets, images, and books publicised her story. She became an iconic propaganda figure for military recruitment in Britain, and to help increase favourable sentiment towards the Allies in the United States. She was a popular icon because of her sex, her nursing profession, and her apparently heroic approach to death.{{sfn|Judson|1941}}  Her execution was represented as an act of German barbarism and moral depravity.\n\nNews reports shortly following Cavell's execution were found to be only true in part.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} Even the ''[[American Journal of Nursing]]'' repeated the fictional account of Cavell's execution in which she fainted and fell because of her refusal to wear a blindfold in front of the firing squad.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} Allegedly, while she lay unconscious, the German commanding officer shot her dead with a revolver.{{sfn|Scovil|1915}}  Along with the invasion of Belgium, and the sinking of the ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'', Cavell's execution was widely publicised in both Britain and North America by [[Wellington House]], the British War Propaganda Bureau.{{sfn|Peterson|1939|p=61}}\n\nBecause of the British government's decision to publicise Cavell's story as part of its propaganda effort, she became the most prominent British female casualty of the First World War.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}}  The combination of heroic appeal and a resonant atrocity-story narrative made Cavell's case one of the most effective in British propaganda of the First World War.{{sfn|Peterson|1939|p=61}}\n\nBefore the First World War, Cavell was not well known outside nursing circles.{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} This allowed two different depictions of the truth about her in British [[propaganda]], which were a reply to enemy attempts to justify her shooting, including the suggestion that Cavell, during her interrogation, had given information that incriminated others. In November 1915, the British Foreign Office issued a denial that Cavell had implicated anyone else in her testimony.\n\nOne image commonly represented was of Cavell as an innocent victim of a ruthless and dishonourable enemy.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}} This view depicted her as having helped Allied soldiers to escape, but innocent of 'espionage', and was most commonly used in various forms of British propaganda, such as postcards and newspaper illustrations during the war.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}}  Her story was presented in the British press as a means of fuelling a desire for revenge on the battlefield.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}} These images implied that men must enlist in the armed forces immediately in order to stop forces that could arrange the judicial murder of an innocent British woman.\n\nAnother representation of a side of Cavell during the First World War saw her described as a serious, reserved, brave, and patriotic woman who devoted her life to nursing and died to save others. This portrayal has been illustrated in numerous biographical sources, from personal first-hand experiences of the Red Cross nurse. Pastor Le Seur, the German army chaplain, recalled at the time of her execution, \"I do not believe that Miss Cavell wanted to be a [[martyr]]{{nbsp}}... but she was ready to die for her country{{nbsp}}...  Miss Cavell was a very brave woman and a faithful [[Christians|Christian]]\".{{sfn|Hoehling|1957}} Another account from Anglican chaplain, the Reverend Gahan, remembers Cavell's words, \"I have no fear or shrinking; I have seen death so often it is not strange, or fearful to me!\"{{sfn|Scovil|1915}} In this interpretation, her stoicism was seen as remarkable for a non-combatant woman, and brought her even greater renown than a man in similar circumstances would have received.{{sfn|Hughes|2005}}\n\n== German response ==\n\nThe Imperial German Government thought that it had acted fairly towards Cavell. In a letter, German Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs, Dr Alfred Zimmermann (not to be confused with [[Arthur Zimmermann]], German Secretary for Foreign Affairs) made a statement to the press on behalf of the German government:\n\n{{quote|It was a pity that Miss Cavell had to be executed, but it was necessary. She was judged justly ... It is undoubtedly a terrible thing that the woman has been executed; but consider what would happen to a State, particularly in war, if it left crimes aimed at the safety of its armies to go unpunished because they were committed by women.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1916|p=481}}}}\nFrom the perspective of the German government, had it released Cavell there might have been a surge in the number of women participating in acts against Germany because they knew they would not be severely punished. It took the view that it was up to the responsible men to follow their legal duty to Germany and ignore the world's condemnation. Its laws did not make distinctions between sexes; the only exception to this being that, according to legal customs, women in a \"delicate\" (probably this means \"pregnant\") condition should not be executed.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1916|p=481}} However, in January 1916, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|the Kaiser]] decreed that, from then, on capital punishment should not be carried out on women without his explicit prior endorsement.{{sfn|Hull|2014|pp=108\u201309}}\n\nThe German government also believed that all of the convicted people were thoroughly aware of the nature of their acts. The court paid particular attention to this point, releasing several people because there was doubt as to whether the accused knew that their actions were punishable.{{sfn|Zimmermann|1916|p=481}} The condemned, in contrast, knew full well what they were doing and the punishment for committing their crimes because \"numerous public proclamations had pointed out the fact that aiding enemies\u2019 armies was punishable with death.\"{{sfn|Zimmermann|1916|p=481}} The Allied response to this was the same as to [[Bethmann-Hollweg]]'s announcement of the invasion of Belgium, or the notice given in the papers of intent to sink such ships as the {{RMS|Lusitania}}; to make a public proclamation of a thing does not make it right.\n\n== Burial and memorials ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}<!--many of the list items are not cited-->\n[[File:Edith Cavell monument.JPG|thumb|Memorial to Cavell outside [[Norwich Cathedral]]]]\n[[File:XII Execution of Edith Cavell painting by Brian Whelan 2015.jpg|thumb|''XII \u2013 Execution of Edith Cavell'', one of 14 paintings on Cavell by [[Brian Whelan]] in [[Norwich Cathedral]]]]\n[[File:Edith Cavel Memorial - statue.jpg|thumb|alt=A marble statue of Edith Cavell in nurse's uniform backed by a large granite column|Detail of the [[Edith Cavell Memorial]], St Martin's Place, London]]\n[[File:Schaerbeek Rue Colonel Bourg Enclos des fusill\u00e9s 02.jpg|thumb|War memorial in Rue Colonel Bourg, [[Schaerbeek]] including Cavell's name]]\n[[File:Monument Cavell-Depage Bxl.JPG|thumb|Monument to Edith Cavell and [[Marie Depage]], Brussels]]\n[[File:CavellVanQEIIJ60.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Cavell Van]] at [[Bodiam railway station]]]]\n\nCavell's remains were returned to Britain after the war.  As the ship bearing the coffin arrived in Dover, a full [[peal]] of [[Grandsire]] [[Method ringing#Method names|Triples]] (5040 Changes, Parker's Twelve-Part) was rung on the bells of the parish church.  The peal was notable: \"Rung with the bells deeply muffled with the exception of the Tenor which was open at back stroke, in token of respect to Nurse Cavell, whose body arrived at Dover during the ringing and rested in the town till the following morning. The ringers of 1-2-3-4-5-6 are ex-soldiers, F. Elliot having been eight months Prisoner of War in Germany.\"  Deep (or full) muffling is normally only used for the deaths of sovereigns.{{sfn|KCACR}}  A peal using the same method, with the bells half muffled, was rung for the centenary of her repatriation.{{sfn|Baldock|2019}}  After an overnight pause in the parish church the body was conveyed to London and a [[state funeral]] was held at [[Westminster Abbey]]. On 19 May 1919, her body was reburied at the east side of [[Norwich Cathedral]]; a graveside service is still held each October.{{sfn|Norwich Cathedral}} The railway van known as the [[Cavell Van]] that conveyed her remains from Dover to London is kept as a memorial on the [[Kent and East Sussex Railway]] and is usually open to view at [[Bodiam railway station]].\n\nIn the Church of England's [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|calendar of saints]], the day appointed for the commemoration of Cavell is 12 October. This is a memorial in her honour rather than formal [[canonisation]], and so not a \"saint's feast day\" in the traditional sense.\n\nFollowing Cavell's death, many memorials were created around the world to remember her.
