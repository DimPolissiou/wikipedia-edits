Noblemen loyal to the kings also received this [[Noble titles|Title]].\n\nThe title itself is derived from the title [[Emir]]. ''Emir'', meaning \"commander\" or \"Prince\", is derived from the Semitic [[triconsonantal|root]] ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\"Amr\"}}'', meaning \"command\".

They typically provide 6 to 16 weeks of delayed release in turf applications. When a hard polymer is used as the secondary coating, the properties are a cross between diffusion-controlled particles and traditional sulfur-coated.\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[File:Reuse of urine demonstration - fertilised and not fertilised tomato plant experiment (3617543234).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Six tomato plants grown with and without nitrate fertilizer on nutrient-poor sand/clay soil. One of the plants in the nutrient-poor soil has died.]]\nFertilizers  enhance the growth of plants. This goal is met in two ways, the traditional one being additives that provide nutrients.  The second mode by which some fertilizers act is to enhance the effectiveness of the soil by modifying its water retention and aeration.  This article, like many on fertilizers, emphasises the nutritional aspect.\nFertilizers typically provide, in varying [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportions]]:<ref name=Ull/>\n* three main macronutrients:\n** [[Nitrogen]] (N): leaf growth\n** [[Phosphorus]] (P): Development of roots, flowers, seeds, fruit;\n** [[Potassium]] (K): Strong stem growth, movement of water in plants, promotion of flowering and fruiting;\n* three secondary macronutrients: [[calcium]] (Ca), [[magnesium]] (Mg), and [[sulfur]] (S);\n* micronutrients: [[copper]] (Cu), [[Iron fertilisation|iron]] (Fe), [[manganese]] (Mn), [[molybdenum]] (Mo), [[zinc]] (Zn), [[boron]] (B). Of occasional significance are [[silicon]] (Si), [[cobalt]] (Co), and [[vanadium]] (V).\n\nThe nutrients required for healthy plant life are classified according to the elements, but the elements are not used as fertilizers.  Instead [[chemical compound|compounds]] containing these elements are the basis of fertilizers.  The macro-nutrients are consumed in larger quantities and are present in plant tissue in quantities from 0.15% to 6.0% on a [[dry matter]] (DM) (0% moisture) basis. Plants are made up of four main elements: hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen.  Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are widely available as water and carbon dioxide. Although nitrogen makes up most of the atmosphere, it is in a form that is unavailable to plants. Nitrogen is the most important fertilizer since nitrogen is present in [[protein]]s, [[DNA]] and other components (e.g., [[chlorophyll]]).  To be nutritious to plants, nitrogen must be made available in a \"fixed\" form. Only some bacteria and their host plants (notably [[legume]]s) can fix atmospheric nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) by converting it to [[ammonia]].  Phosphate is required for the production of DNA and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], the main energy carrier in cells, as well as certain lipids.\n\nMicronutrients are consumed in smaller quantities and are present in plant tissue on the order of [[Parts-per notation|parts-per-million]] (ppm), ranging from 0.15 to 400 ppm or less than 0.04% dry matter.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://aesl.ces.uga.edu/publications/plant/Nutrient.asp|title = AESL Plant Analysis Handbook&nbsp;\u2013 Nutrient Content of Plant|publisher = Aesl.ces.uga.edu|date = |access-date = 11 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Mills and Jones, 1996\">{{cite book|author1=H.A.

Because these elements enable catalysts (enzymes) their impact far exceeds their weight percentage.\n\n==Classification==\nFertilizers are classified in several ways.  They are classified according to whether they provide a single nutrient (e.g., K, P, or N), in which case they are classified as \"straight fertilizers.\"  \"Multinutrient fertilizers\" (or \"complex fertilizers\") provide two or more nutrients, for example N and P.  Fertilizers are also sometimes classified as inorganic (the topic of most of this article) versus organic.  Inorganic fertilizers exclude carbon-containing materials except [[ureas]].  Organic fertilizers are usually (recycled) plant- or animal-derived matter.  Inorganic are sometimes called synthetic fertilizers since various chemical treatments are required for their manufacture.<ref>J.

[[Ammonium nitrate]] (NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>) is also widely used. [[Urea]] is another popular source of nitrogen, having the advantage that it is solid and non-explosive, unlike ammonia and ammonium nitrate, respectively.

[[Triple superphosphate]] (TSP) typically consists of 44-48% of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and no gypsum. A mixture of single superphosphate and triple superphosphate is called double superphosphate. More than 90% of a typical superphosphate fertilizer is water-soluble.\n\nThe main potassium-based straight fertilizer is Muriate of Potash (MOP).  Muriate of Potash consists of 95-99% KCl, and is typically available as 0-0-60 or 0-0-62 fertilizer.\n\n===Multinutrient fertilizers===\nThese fertilizers are common. They consist of two or more nutrient components.\n\n====Binary (NP, NK, PK) fertilizers====\nMajor two-component fertilizers provide both nitrogen and phosphorus to the plants. These are called NP fertilizers. The main NP fertilizers are [[monoammonium phosphate]] (MAP) and [[diammonium phosphate]] (DAP). The active ingredient in MAP is NH<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. The active ingredient in DAP is (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>. About 85% of MAP and DAP fertilizers are soluble in water.\n\n====NPK fertilizers====\n{{Main|Labeling of fertilizer}}\nNPK fertilizers are three-component fertilizers providing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.\n\n[[NPK rating]] is a rating system describing the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in a fertilizer. NPK ratings consist of three numbers separated by dashes (e.g., 10-10-10 or 16-4-8) describing the chemical content of fertilizers.<ref>{{cite web |title= Summary of State Fertilizer Laws |url=https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dailys/03/dec03/121503/02N-0276_emc-000107-02.pdf |publisher= EPA |accessdate= 14 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Label Requirements of specialty and other bagged fertilizers |url= http://www.michigan.gov/mdard/0,4610,7-125-1569_16993_19405-49343--,00.html |publisher= Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development |accessdate= 14 March 2013}}</ref> The first number represents the percentage of nitrogen in the product; the second number, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>; the third,  K<sub>2</sub>O.

These elements are provided as water-soluble salts. Iron presents special problems because it converts to insoluble (bio-unavailable) compounds at moderate soil pH and phosphate concentrations. For this reason, iron is often administered as a [[Chelation|chelate complex]], e.g., the [[Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid|EDTA]] derivative.

The large production of [[sulfuric acid]] as an industrial chemical is primarily due to its use as cheap acid in processing phosphate rock into phosphate fertilizer. The global primary uses for both [[sulfur]] and [[phosphorus]] compounds relate to this basic process.\n\nIn the [[nitrophosphate process]] or Odda process (invented in 1927), phosphate rock with up to a 20% phosphorus (P) content is dissolved with [[nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>) to produce a mixture of phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) and [[calcium nitrate]] (Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>). This mixture can be combined with a potassium fertilizer to produce a ''compound fertilizer'' with the three macronutrients N, P and K in easily dissolved form.<ref name=EFMA2000>{{cite web|last1=EFMA|title=Best available techniques for pollution prevention and control in the European fertilizer industry.

Potash is soluble in water, so the main effort in producing this nutrient from the ore involves some purification steps; e.g., to remove [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) (common [[salt]]).  Sometimes potash is referred to as K<sub>2</sub>O, as a matter of convenience to those describing the potassium content.  In fact, potash fertilizers are usually [[potassium chloride]], [[potassium sulfate]], [[potassium carbonate]], or [[potassium nitrate]].<ref name=FertEncyl/>\n\n===Compound fertilizers===\nCompound fertilizers, which contain N, P, and K, can often be produced by mixing straight fertilizers.  In some cases, chemical reactions occur between the two or more components.  For example, monoammonium and diammonium phosphates, which provide plants with both N and P, are produced by neutralizing phosphoric acid (from phosphate rock) and ammonia :\n:NH<sub>3</sub>  +  H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>    \u2192   (NH<sub>4</sub>)H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>\n:2 NH<sub>3</sub>  +  H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>    \u2192   (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>\n\n=== Organic fertilizers ===\n{{Main|Organic fertilizer}}\n[[File:HomeComposting Roubaix Fr59.JPG|thumb|Compost bin for small-scale production of organic fertilizer]]\n[[File:Krechty kompostarna.jpg|thumb|A large commercial compost operation]]\n\n\u201c[[Organic fertilizer]]s\u201d can describe those fertilizers with an organic \u2014 biologic \u2014 origin\u2014that is, fertilizers derived from living or formerly living materials.

It is an immature form of coal and improves the soil by aeration and absorbing water but confers no nutritional value to the plants. It is therefore not a fertilizer as defined in the beginning of the article, but rather an amendment. [[Coir]], (derived from coconut husks), bark, and sawdust when added to soil all act similarly (but not identically) to peat and are also considered organic soil amendments - or texturizers - because of their limited nutritive inputs.  Some organic additives can have a reverse effect on nutrients \u2014 fresh sawdust can consume soil nutrients as it breaks down, and may lower soil pH \u2014 but these same organic texturizers (as well as compost, etc.) may increase the availability of nutrients through improved cation exchange, or through increased growth of microorganisms that in turn increase availability of certain plant nutrients. Organic fertilizers such as composts and manures may be distributed locally without going into industry production, making actual consumption more difficult to quantify.\n\n==Application==<!--need timing of application, methods for applying-->\n[[File:7252 Hand top-dressing of super phosphate on Banks Peninsula.jpg|thumb|Applying [[Monocalcium phosphate|super phosphate]] fertilizer by hand, New Zealand, 1938]]\nFertilizers are commonly used for growing all crops, with application rates depending on the soil fertility, usually as measured by a [[soil test]] and according to the particular crop. Legumes, for example, fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and generally do not require nitrogen fertilizer.\n\n===Liquid vs solid===\nFertilizers are applied to crops both as solids and as liquid. About 90% of fertilizers are applied as solids. The most widely used solid inorganic fertilizers are [[urea]], diammonium phosphate and potassium chloride.<ref name=\"IFA2017\">{{cite web|title=About Fertilizers Home Page|url=https://www.fertilizer.org/En/Knowledge_Resources/About_Fertilizers/About_Fertilizers_Home_Page.aspx?|website=www.fertilizer.org|publisher=International Fertilizer Association|accessdate=19 December 2017}}</ref> Solid fertilizer is typically granulated or powdered.  Often solids are available as [[prill]]s, a solid globule.  Liquid fertilizers comprise anhydrous ammonia, aqueous solutions of ammonia, aqueous solutions of ammonium nitrate or urea.  These concentrated products may be diluted with water to form a concentrated liquid fertilizer (e.g., [[UAN]]). Advantages of liquid fertilizer are its more rapid effect and easier coverage.<ref name=Ull/>  The addition of fertilizer to irrigation water is called \"[[fertigation]]\".<ref name=FertEncyl/>\n\n=== Slow- and controlled-release fertilizers ===\nSlow- and controlled-release involve only 0.15% (562,000 tons) of the fertilizer market (1995). Their utility stems from the fact that fertilizers are subject to antagonistic processes.  In addition to their providing the nutrition to plants, excess fertilizers can be poisonous to the same plant.  Competitive with the uptake by plants is the degradation or loss of the fertilizer. Microbes degrade many fertilizers, e.g., by immobilization or oxidation.  Furthermore, fertilizers are lost by evaporation or leaching.  Most slow-release fertilizers are derivatives of urea, a straight fertilizer providing nitrogen. [[Isobutylidenediurea]] (\"IBDU\") and urea-formaldehyde slowly convert in the soil to free urea, which is rapidly uptaken by plants.  IBDU is a single compound with the formula (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CHCH(NHC(O)NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> whereas the urea-formaldehydes consist of mixtures of the approximate formula (HOCH<sub>2</sub>NHC(O)NH)<sub>n</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>.\n\nBesides being more efficient in the utilization of the applied nutrients, slow-release technologies also reduce the impact on the environment and the contamination of the subsurface water.<ref name=SRN/> Slow-release fertilizers (various forms including fertilizer spikes, tabs, etc.) reduce the problem of \"burning\" the plants due to excess nitrogen. Polymer coating of fertilizer ingredients gives tablets and spikes a 'true time-release' or 'staged nutrient release' (SNR) of fertilizer nutrients.\n\nControlled release fertilizers are traditional fertilizers encapsulated in a shell that degrades at a specified rate.  Sulfur is a typical encapsulation material.  Other coated products use thermoplastics (and sometimes ethylene-vinyl acetate and surfactants, etc.) to produce diffusion-controlled release of [[urea]] or other fertilizers. \"Reactive Layer Coating\" can produce thinner, hence cheaper, membrane coatings by applying reactive monomers simultaneously to the soluble particles. \"Multicote\" is a process applying layers of low-cost fatty acid salts with a paraffin topcoat.\n\n===Foliar application===\nFoliar fertilizers are applied directly to leaves. This method is almost invariably used to apply water-soluble straight nitrogen fertilizers and used especially for high-value crops such as fruits.<ref name=Ull/>\n[[File:Fertilizer-Burn.jpg|upright|thumb|Fertilizer burn]]\n\n===Chemicals that affect nitrogen uptake===\nVarious chemicals are used to enhance the efficiency of nitrogen-based fertilizers.  In this way farmers can limit the polluting effects of nitrogen run-off.  Nitrification inhibitors (also known as nitrogen stabilizers) suppress the conversion of ammonia into nitrate, an anion that is more prone to leaching.  1-Carbamoyl-3-methylpyrazole (CMP), [[dicyandiamide]], nitrapyrin (2-chloro-6-trichloromethylpyridine) and 3,4-Dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) are popular.<ref name=\"YangFang2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Ming|last2=Fang|first2=Yunting|last3=Sun|first3=Di|last4=Shi|first4=Yuanliang|title=Efficiency of two nitrification inhibitors (dicyandiamide and 3, 4-dimethypyrazole phosphate) on soil nitrogen transformations and plant productivity: a meta-analysis|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|issue=1|pages=22075|year=2016|issn=2045-2322|doi=10.1038/srep22075|pmid=26902689|bibcode=2016NatSR...622075Y|pmc=4763264}}</ref> Urease inhibitors are used to slow the hydrolytic conversion of urea into ammonia, which is prone to evaporation as well as nitrification.

In 2008, Chinese governments began to partially withdraw fertilizer subsidies, including subsidies to fertilizer transportation and to electricity and natural gas use in the industry. In consequence, the price of fertilizer has gone up and large-scale farms have begun to use less fertilizer. If large-scale farms keep reducing their use of fertilizer subsidies, they have no choice but to optimize the fertilizer they have which would therefore gain an increase in both grain yield and profit.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ju|first=Xiaotang|last2=B.Gu, Y.

They typically provide 6 to 16 weeks of delayed release in turf applications. When a hard polymer is used as the secondary coating, the properties are a cross between diffusion-controlled particles and traditional sulfur-coated.\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[File:Reuse of urine demonstration - fertilised and not fertilised tomato plant experiment (3617543234).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Six tomato plants grown with and without nitrate fertilizer on nutrient-poor sand/clay soil. One of the plants in the nutrient-poor soil has died.]]\nFertilizers  enhance the growth of plants. This goal is met in two ways, the traditional one being additives that provide nutrients.  The second mode by which some fertilizers act is to enhance the effectiveness of the soil by modifying its water retention and aeration.  This article, like many on fertilizers, emphasises the nutritional aspect.\nFertilizers typically provide, in varying [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportions]]:<ref name=Ull/>\n* three main macronutrients:\n** [[Nitrogen]] (N): leaf growth\n** [[Phosphorus]] (P): Development of roots, flowers, seeds, fruit;\n** [[Potassium]] (K): Strong stem growth, movement of water in plants, promotion of flowering and fruiting;\n* three secondary macronutrients: [[calcium]] (Ca), [[magnesium]] (Mg), and [[sulfur]] (S);\n* micronutrients: [[copper]] (Cu), [[Iron fertilisation|iron]] (Fe), [[manganese]] (Mn), [[molybdenum]] (Mo), [[zinc]] (Zn), [[boron]] (B). Of occasional significance are [[silicon]] (Si), [[cobalt]] (Co), and [[vanadium]] (V).\n\nThe nutrients required for healthy plant life are classified according to the elements, but the elements are not used as fertilizers.  Instead [[chemical compound|compounds]] containing these elements are the basis of fertilizers.  The macro-nutrients are consumed in larger quantities and are present in plant tissue in quantities from 0.15% to 6.0% on a [[dry matter]] (DM) (0% moisture) basis. Plants are made up of four main elements: hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen.  Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are widely available as water and carbon dioxide. Although nitrogen makes up most of the atmosphere, it is in a form that is unavailable to plants. Nitrogen is the most important fertilizer since nitrogen is present in [[protein]]s, [[DNA]] and other components (e.g., [[chlorophyll]]).  To be nutritious to plants, nitrogen must be made available in a \"fixed\" form. Only some bacteria and their host plants (notably [[legume]]s) can fix atmospheric nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) by converting it to [[ammonia]].  Phosphate is required for the production of DNA and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], the main energy carrier in cells, as well as certain lipids.\n\nMicronutrients are consumed in smaller quantities and are present in plant tissue on the order of [[Parts-per notation|parts-per-million]] (ppm), ranging from 0.15 to 400 ppm or less than 0.04% dry matter.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://aesl.ces.uga.edu/publications/plant/Nutrient.asp|title = AESL Plant Analysis Handbook&nbsp;\u2013 Nutrient Content of Plant|publisher = Aesl.ces.uga.edu|date = |access-date = 11 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Mills and Jones, 1996\">{{cite book|author1=H.A.

Because these elements enable catalysts (enzymes) their impact far exceeds their weight percentage.\n\n==Classification==\nFertilizers are classified in several ways.  They are classified according to whether they provide a single nutrient (e.g., K, P, or N), in which case they are classified as \"straight fertilizers.\"  \"Multinutrient fertilizers\" (or \"complex fertilizers\") provide two or more nutrients, for example N and P.  Fertilizers are also sometimes classified as inorganic (the topic of most of this article) versus organic.  Inorganic fertilizers exclude carbon-containing materials except [[ureas]].  Organic fertilizers are usually (recycled) plant- or animal-derived matter.  Inorganic are sometimes called synthetic fertilizers since various chemical treatments are required for their manufacture.<ref>J.

[[Ammonium nitrate]] (NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>) is also widely used. [[Urea]] is another popular source of nitrogen, having the advantage that it is solid and non-explosive, unlike ammonia and ammonium nitrate, respectively.

[[Triple superphosphate]] (TSP) typically consists of 44-48% of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and no gypsum. A mixture of single superphosphate and triple superphosphate is called double superphosphate. More than 90% of a typical superphosphate fertilizer is water-soluble.\n\nThe main potassium-based straight fertilizer is Muriate of Potash (MOP).  Muriate of Potash consists of 95-99% KCl, and is typically available as 0-0-60 or 0-0-62 fertilizer.\n\n===Multinutrient fertilizers===\nThese fertilizers are common. They consist of two or more nutrient components.\n\n====Binary (NP, NK, PK) fertilizers====\nMajor two-component fertilizers provide both nitrogen and phosphorus to the plants. These are called NP fertilizers. The main NP fertilizers are [[monoammonium phosphate]] (MAP) and [[diammonium phosphate]] (DAP). The active ingredient in MAP is NH<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. The active ingredient in DAP is (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>. About 85% of MAP and DAP fertilizers are soluble in water.\n\n====NPK fertilizers====\n{{Main|Labeling of fertilizer}}\nNPK fertilizers are three-component fertilizers providing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.\n\n[[NPK rating]] is a rating system describing the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in a fertilizer. NPK ratings consist of three numbers separated by dashes (e.g., 10-10-10 or 16-4-8) describing the chemical content of fertilizers.<ref>{{cite web |title= Summary of State Fertilizer Laws |url=https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dailys/03/dec03/121503/02N-0276_emc-000107-02.pdf |publisher= EPA |accessdate= 14 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Label Requirements of specialty and other bagged fertilizers |url= http://www.michigan.gov/mdard/0,4610,7-125-1569_16993_19405-49343--,00.html |publisher= Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development |accessdate= 14 March 2013}}</ref> The first number represents the percentage of nitrogen in the product; the second number, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>; the third,  K<sub>2</sub>O.

These elements are provided as water-soluble salts. Iron presents special problems because it converts to insoluble (bio-unavailable) compounds at moderate soil pH and phosphate concentrations. For this reason, iron is often administered as a [[Chelation|chelate complex]], e.g., the [[Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid|EDTA]] derivative.

In rare cases, fields are treated with the crushed mineral, but most often more soluble [[Phosphite anion|salts]] are produced by chemical treatment of phosphate minerals. The most popular phosphate-containing minerals are referred to collectively as [[phosphate rock]].  The main minerals are [[fluorapatite]] Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>F (CFA) and [[hydroxyapatite]] Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>OH.  These minerals are converted to water-soluble phosphate salts by treatment with [[Sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) or [[phosphoric acid]]s (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>). The large production of [[sulfuric acid]] as an industrial chemical is primarily due to its use as cheap acid in processing phosphate rock into phosphate fertilizer. The global primary uses for both [[sulfur]] and [[phosphorus]] compounds relate to this basic process.\n\nIn the [[nitrophosphate process]] or Odda process (invented in 1927), phosphate rock with up to a 20% phosphorus (P) content is dissolved with [[nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>) to produce a mixture of phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) and [[calcium nitrate]] (Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>). This mixture can be combined with a potassium fertilizer to produce a ''compound fertilizer'' with the three macronutrients N, P and K in easily dissolved form.<ref name=EFMA2000>{{cite web|last1=EFMA|title=Best available techniques for pollution prevention and control in the European fertilizer industry.

Potash is soluble in water, so the main effort in producing this nutrient from the ore involves some purification steps; e.g., to remove [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) (common [[salt]]).  Sometimes potash is referred to as K<sub>2</sub>O, as a matter of convenience to those describing the potassium content.  In fact, potash fertilizers are usually [[potassium chloride]], [[potassium sulfate]], [[potassium carbonate]], or [[potassium nitrate]].<ref name=FertEncyl/>\n\n===Compound fertilizers===\nCompound fertilizers, which contain N, P, and K, can often be produced by mixing straight fertilizers.  In some cases, chemical reactions occur between the two or more components.  For example, monoammonium and diammonium phosphates, which provide plants with both N and P, are produced by neutralizing phosphoric acid (from phosphate rock) and ammonia :\n:NH<sub>3</sub>  +  H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>    \u2192   (NH<sub>4</sub>)H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>\n:2 NH<sub>3</sub>  +  H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>    \u2192   (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>\n\n=== Organic fertilizers ===\n{{Main|Organic fertilizer}}\n[[File:HomeComposting Roubaix Fr59.JPG|thumb|Compost bin for small-scale production of organic fertilizer]]\n[[File:Krechty kompostarna.jpg|thumb|A large commercial compost operation]]\n\n\u201c[[Organic fertilizer]]s\u201d can describe those fertilizers with an organic \u2014 biologic \u2014 origin\u2014that is, fertilizers derived from living or formerly living materials.

It is an immature form of coal and improves the soil by aeration and absorbing water but confers no nutritional value to the plants. It is therefore not a fertilizer as defined in the beginning of the article, but rather an amendment. [[Coir]], (derived from coconut husks), bark, and sawdust when added to soil all act similarly (but not identically) to peat and are also considered organic soil amendments - or texturizers - because of their limited nutritive inputs.  Some organic additives can have a reverse effect on nutrients \u2014 fresh sawdust can consume soil nutrients as it breaks down, and may lower soil pH \u2014 but these same organic texturizers (as well as compost, etc.) may increase the availability of nutrients through improved cation exchange, or through increased growth of microorganisms that in turn increase availability of certain plant nutrients. Organic fertilizers such as composts and manures may be distributed locally without going into industry production, making actual consumption more difficult to quantify.\n\n==Application==<!--need timing of application, methods for applying-->\n[[File:7252 Hand top-dressing of super phosphate on Banks Peninsula.jpg|thumb|Applying [[Monocalcium phosphate|super phosphate]] fertilizer by hand, New Zealand, 1938]]\nFertilizers are commonly used for growing all crops, with application rates depending on the soil fertility, usually as measured by a [[soil test]] and according to the particular crop. Legumes, for example, fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and generally do not require nitrogen fertilizer.\n\n===Liquid vs solid===\nFertilizers are applied to crops both as solids and as liquid. About 90% of fertilizers are applied as solids. The most widely used solid inorganic fertilizers are [[urea]], diammonium phosphate and potassium chloride.<ref name=\"IFA2017\">{{cite web|title=About Fertilizers Home Page|url=https://www.fertilizer.org/En/Knowledge_Resources/About_Fertilizers/About_Fertilizers_Home_Page.aspx?|website=www.fertilizer.org|publisher=International Fertilizer Association|accessdate=19 December 2017}}</ref> Solid fertilizer is typically granulated or powdered.  Often solids are available as [[prill]]s, a solid globule.  Liquid fertilizers comprise anhydrous ammonia, aqueous solutions of ammonia, aqueous solutions of ammonium nitrate or urea.  These concentrated products may be diluted with water to form a concentrated liquid fertilizer (e.g., [[UAN]]). Advantages of liquid fertilizer are its more rapid effect and easier coverage.<ref name=Ull/>  The addition of fertilizer to irrigation water is called \"[[fertigation]]\".<ref name=FertEncyl/>\n\n=== Slow- and controlled-release fertilizers ===\nSlow- and controlled-release involve only 0.15% (562,000 tons) of the fertilizer market (1995). Their utility stems from the fact that fertilizers are subject to antagonistic processes.  In addition to their providing the nutrition to plants, excess fertilizers can be poisonous to the same plant.  Competitive with the uptake by plants is the degradation or loss of the fertilizer. Microbes degrade many fertilizers, e.g., by immobilization or oxidation.  Furthermore, fertilizers are lost by evaporation or leaching.  Most slow-release fertilizers are derivatives of urea, a straight fertilizer providing nitrogen. [[Isobutylidenediurea]] (\"IBDU\") and urea-formaldehyde slowly convert in the soil to free urea, which is rapidly uptaken by plants.  IBDU is a single compound with the formula (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CHCH(NHC(O)NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> whereas the urea-formaldehydes consist of mixtures of the approximate formula (HOCH<sub>2</sub>NHC(O)NH)<sub>n</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>.\n\nBesides being more efficient in the utilization of the applied nutrients, slow-release technologies also reduce the impact on the environment and the contamination of the subsurface water.<ref name=SRN/> Slow-release fertilizers (various forms including fertilizer spikes, tabs, etc.) reduce the problem of \"burning\" the plants due to excess nitrogen. Polymer coating of fertilizer ingredients gives tablets and spikes a 'true time-release' or 'staged nutrient release' (SNR) of fertilizer nutrients.\n\nControlled release fertilizers are traditional fertilizers encapsulated in a shell that degrades at a specified rate.  Sulfur is a typical encapsulation material.  Other coated products use thermoplastics (and sometimes ethylene-vinyl acetate and surfactants, etc.) to produce diffusion-controlled release of [[urea]] or other fertilizers. \"Reactive Layer Coating\" can produce thinner, hence cheaper, membrane coatings by applying reactive monomers simultaneously to the soluble particles. \"Multicote\" is a process applying layers of low-cost fatty acid salts with a paraffin topcoat.\n\n===Foliar application===\nFoliar fertilizers are applied directly to leaves. This method is almost invariably used to apply water-soluble straight nitrogen fertilizers and used especially for high-value crops such as fruits.<ref name=Ull/>\n[[File:Fertilizer-Burn.jpg|upright|thumb|Fertilizer burn]]\n\n===Chemicals that affect nitrogen uptake===\nVarious chemicals are used to enhance the efficiency of nitrogen-based fertilizers.  In this way farmers can limit the polluting effects of nitrogen run-off.  Nitrification inhibitors (also known as nitrogen stabilizers) suppress the conversion of ammonia into nitrate, an anion that is more prone to leaching.  1-Carbamoyl-3-methylpyrazole (CMP), [[dicyandiamide]], nitrapyrin (2-chloro-6-trichloromethylpyridine) and 3,4-Dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) are popular.<ref name=\"YangFang2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Ming|last2=Fang|first2=Yunting|last3=Sun|first3=Di|last4=Shi|first4=Yuanliang|title=Efficiency of two nitrification inhibitors (dicyandiamide and 3, 4-dimethypyrazole phosphate) on soil nitrogen transformations and plant productivity: a meta-analysis|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|issue=1|pages=22075|year=2016|issn=2045-2322|doi=10.1038/srep22075|pmid=26902689|bibcode=2016NatSR...622075Y|pmc=4763264}}</ref> Urease inhibitors are used to slow the hydrolytic conversion of urea into ammonia, which is prone to evaporation as well as nitrification.

In 2008, Chinese governments began to partially withdraw fertilizer subsidies, including subsidies to fertilizer transportation and to electricity and natural gas use in the industry. In consequence, the price of fertilizer has gone up and large-scale farms have begun to use less fertilizer. If large-scale farms keep reducing their use of fertilizer subsidies, they have no choice but to optimize the fertilizer they have which would therefore gain an increase in both grain yield and profit.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ju|first=Xiaotang|last2=B.Gu, Y.

These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events. The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires. Drawings and writings of children of the Spanish War were the result of a contest organized by Alfred Brauner among the children of Barcelona in 1938 on three themes: \"My life Before the War\", \"What I Saw from the War\" and \"How I See My Life after the War\".<ref name=thesis/> It was then the beginning of their work on \"children who have lived through the war.\" 4000 drawings of refugee children and numerous essays were collected in Spain, which later, along with other drawings of children in war, offered a unique testimony of the conflicts of the 20th century through the eyes of children.<ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 =Ibarz Serrat  | first1 = Virgilio  | authorlink = | title = Los dibujos infantiles de la guerra 1937-1938: el caso de la ni\u00f1a de Ballobar | doi = | journal = Diario del AltoArag\u00f3n | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2009  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Their project to publish drawings and testimonies of children in war received the support of [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Romain Rolland]] who \"regarded this collection as of considerable educational, historical and human interest.\"<ref name=\"Yannick Ripa\"/>\n \nIn 1939, Alfred Brauner welcomed 130 Jewish children from the Palatinate, Berlin and Austria,<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> survivors of the [[Kristallnacht]] at La Guette, a French castle owned by the Rothschild family and made available by [[Baroness Germaine de Rothschild]].<ref name=\"La Guette\">{{Cite web|url= http://www.ajpn.org/sauvetage-Chateau-de-la-Guette-245.html |title= Ch\u00e2teau de la Guette durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale (WWII) |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= www.ajpn.org/index.php | publisher= }}</ref><ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Lochy  | first1 = Emilie | authorlink = | title = Extrait de l'ouvrage : Enfances en guerre - T\u00e9moignages d'enfants sur la guerre | doi = | journal = Le Cercle Psy | volume = 12  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2014 | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Alfred\u2019s  intention was to analyze the problems posed in working with children traumatized by their experiences and by separation from their families, with the aim of adapting them to a new life and preparing them for integration into France.<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> He then described this educational experience in his state thesis, defended in 1946, entitled \"The Psychic Repercussions of Modern War on Childhood.\"<ref name=thesis/>\n \nFrom January 1941, Alfred Brauner entered the [[French Resistance]] and welcomed the [[Austrian resistance]]\u2019s leadership in his [[Rue Bonaparte]] apartment in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Resistance\"/><ref name=\"Bio\"/> With members of the [[\u00d6sterreichische Freiheitsfront]] arriving every morning at a specific time, Alfred Brauner decided to open a German Language course as a cover from [[Gestapo]].<ref name=\"Resistance\"/> In 1945, he helped welcoming and educating 444 surviving boys from the [[Auschwitz]] and [[Buchenwald]] [[concentration camps]], in the scope of the [[Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants]] (OSE) in [[Ecouis]], [[France]].<ref name=\"Boltanski\">{{cite book | author = Christophe Boltanski | title = La Cache | page= | publisher = Stock | year = 2015  | isbn = 978-2-234-07637-2}}</ref><ref name=\"L'accueil\"/><ref name=\"Bio\"/> This welcoming of Buchenwald's child survivors in children's homes inspired the script of the film [[Nina's House]],<ref name=\" \">{{Cite web|url= https://jeudisducinema.be/La-maison-de-Nina |title= La maison de Nina |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= jeudisducinema.be/ | publisher=Les jeudis du cinema }}</ref> as well as the documentary [[The Boys of Buchenwald]].\n \nIn 1950, Alfred Brauner created the \"Practical Research for Children,\" which brings together professionals of childhood in order to develop medico-pedagogical methods intended for the education of children with mental disabilities.<ref name=\"Mintec\"/> In 1955, he founded a day hospital for mentally and physically handicapped children located in the center of Paris, then transferred to Saint-Mand\u00e9, and worked on the rehabilitation of these children, giving priority to their education.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> Alfred Brauner was the ambassador of the association \"''Children Refugees of the World,''\" as well as the only non-physician president of the ''Society of Expression Psychopathology and Art Therapy''.<ref name=\"SFPE\">{{Cite web|url= https://www.sfpe-art-therapie.fr/Quelques-dates-qui-marquent-les-avancees-sur-trois-voies-paralleles_a34.html |title= Quelques dates qui marquent les avanc\u00e9es sur trois voies parall\u00e8les.

These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events. The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires. Drawings and writings of children of the Spanish War were the result of a contest organized by Alfred Brauner among the children of Barcelona in 1938 on three themes: \"My life Before the War\", \"What I Saw from the War\" and \"How I See My Life after the War\".<ref name=thesis/> It was then the beginning of their work on \"children who have lived through the war.\" 4000 drawings of refugee children and numerous essays were collected in Spain, which later, along with other drawings of children in war, offered a unique testimony of the conflicts of the 20th century through the eyes of children.<ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 =Ibarz Serrat  | first1 = Virgilio  | authorlink = | title = Los dibujos infantiles de la guerra 1937-1938: el caso de la ni\u00f1a de Ballobar | doi = | journal = Diario del AltoArag\u00f3n | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2009  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Their project to publish drawings and testimonies of children in war received the support of [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Romain Rolland]] who \"regarded this collection as of considerable educational, historical and human interest.\"<ref name=\"Yannick Ripa\"/>\n \nIn 1939, Alfred Brauner welcomed 130 Jewish children from the Palatinate, Berlin and Austria,<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> survivors of the [[Kristallnacht]] at La Guette, a French castle owned by the Rothschild family and made available by [[Baroness Germaine de Rothschild]].<ref name=\"La Guette\">{{Cite web|url= http://www.ajpn.org/sauvetage-Chateau-de-la-Guette-245.html |title= Ch\u00e2teau de la Guette durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale (WWII) |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= www.ajpn.org/index.php | publisher= }}</ref><ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Lochy  | first1 = Emilie | authorlink = | title = Extrait de l'ouvrage : Enfances en guerre - T\u00e9moignages d'enfants sur la guerre | doi = | journal = Le Cercle Psy | volume = 12  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2014 | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Alfred\u2019s  intention was to analyze the problems posed in working with children traumatized by their experiences and by separation from their families, with the aim of adapting them to a new life and preparing them for integration into France.<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> He then described this educational experience in his state thesis, defended in 1946, entitled \"The Psychic Repercussions of Modern War on Childhood.\"<ref name=thesis/>\n \nFrom January 1941, Alfred Brauner entered the [[French Resistance]] and welcomed the [[Austrian resistance]]\u2019s leadership in his [[Rue Bonaparte]] apartment in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Resistance\"/><ref name=\"Bio\"/> With members of the [[\u00d6sterreichische Freiheitsfront]] arriving every morning at a specific time, Alfred Brauner decided to open a German Language course as a cover from [[Gestapo]].<ref name=\"Resistance\"/> In 1945, he helped welcoming and educating 444 surviving boys from the [[Auschwitz]] and [[Buchenwald]] [[concentration camps]], in the scope of the [[Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants]] (OSE) in [[Ecouis]], [[France]].<ref name=\"Boltanski\">{{cite book | author = Christophe Boltanski | title = La Cache | page= | publisher = Stock | year = 2015  | isbn = 978-2-234-07637-2}}</ref><ref name=\"L'accueil\"/><ref name=\"Bio\"/> This welcoming of Buchenwald's child survivors in children's homes inspired the script of the film [[Nina's House]],<ref name=\" \">{{Cite web|url= https://jeudisducinema.be/La-maison-de-Nina |title= La maison de Nina |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= jeudisducinema.be/ | publisher=Les jeudis du cinema }}</ref> as well as the documentary [[The Boys of Buchenwald]].\n \nIn 1950, Alfred Brauner created the \"Practical Research for Children,\" which brings together professionals of childhood in order to develop medico-pedagogical methods intended for the education of children with mental disabilities.<ref name=\"Mintec\"/> In 1955, he founded a day hospital for mentally and physically handicapped children located in the center of Paris, then transferred to Saint-Mand\u00e9, and worked on the rehabilitation of these children, giving priority to their education.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> Alfred Brauner was the ambassador of the association \"''Children Refugees of the World,''\" as well as the only non-physician president of the ''Society of Expression Psychopathology and Art Therapy''.<ref name=\"SFPE\">{{Cite web|url= https://www.sfpe-art-therapie.fr/Quelques-dates-qui-marquent-les-avancees-sur-trois-voies-paralleles_a34.html |title= Quelques dates qui marquent les avanc\u00e9es sur trois voies parall\u00e8les.

Upon arrival at Brest, France, they continued training until September 1918, then took part in the Meuse Argonne Offensive. Capturing the town of Malancourt on 26 September 1918, they assisted the 313th Infantry on the following day in the capture of the town of [[Montfaucon-d'Argonne]]. Montfaucon was a heavily defended area and observation post of the German army. Of the four Infantry regiments of the 79th Division involved in the offensive, the 314th was hardest-hit. It took several days to account for all the missing personnel and bring the regiment up 50 percent manning.\n\nThe 79th Division was relieved on 30 September and transferred to the Troyon sector. While there, they assumed a variety of duties, including holding the front. They shared the trenches with the 313th, 315th, and 316th Infantry Regiments. During this time, they were harassed with mustard gas, shelling, and enemy trench and air raids but held the line.\n\nAt the end of October, the 79th Division was again ordered to move to participate in the third phase of the [[Meuse Argonne Offensive]]. On 1 November 1918, the 314th advanced. By 9 November, they captured the towns of Crepion, Waville, and Moirey. The following day the unit captured Buisson Chaumont, Hill 328. On 11 November, the 314th advanced against Cote de Romagne and stopped firing at 11 a.m., at the time of the Armistice. By the end day, the 314th had made the greatest advance into German lines east of the Meuse River.\n\nThe regiment continued training, passed a review by General Pershing, and shipped home on 15 May 1919, aboard the [[USS Princess Matoika]]. Arriving at Hoboken, New Jersey on 26 May 1919, they were discharged from service at Camp Dix, New Jersey.\n\n===World War II===\n{{main|79th Infantry Division (United States)}}\n\n=== History of the Log Cabin ===\n\n[[File:314th Infantry Log Cabin.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\nErected at Camp Meade, Maryland in 1917 by the men of the 314th as an Officers' Club and assembly room, it was purchased from the U.S. government after the war, carefully disassembled, and rebuilt on ground provided by the [[Washington Memorial Chapel]] by members of the Regiment.

The centerpiece of the cabin was a bronze tablet listing all the members of the regiment\u2014more than 4,000 names. A star was placed beside each name upon their death as a sign of honor.
