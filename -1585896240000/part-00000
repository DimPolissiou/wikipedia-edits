The rebels elected military officers but no civil structure was ever established.<ref name=\"Harlow p. 103\">Harlow p. 103</ref>  Their flag, featuring a silhouette of a [[California grizzly bear]], became known as the [[Bear Flag]] and was later the basis for the official state flag of California.\n\nThree weeks later, on July 5, 1846, the Republic's military of 100 to 200 men was subsumed into the [[California Battalion]] commanded by Brevet Captain John C. Fr\u00e9mont.  The [[Bear Flag Revolt]] and whatever remained of the \"California Republic\" ceased to exist on July 9 when U.S. Navy Lieutenant [[Joseph Warren Revere (general)|Joseph Revere]] raised the [[United States flag]] in front of the [[Sonoma Barracks]] and sent a second flag to be raised at [[Sutter's Fort]].<ref>Bancroft V: 185\u201386</ref>\n\n==Background of the Bear Flag Revolt==\n[[File:P\u00edo Pico cph.31737.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[P\u00edo Pico]] was territorial governor of Alta California south of [[San Luis Obispo]].]]\n\n===Alta California's Governance===\n\nBy 1845\u201346, Alta California had been largely neglected by [[Mexico]] for the twenty-five years since Mexican independence.  It had evolved into a semi-autonomous region with open discussions among [[Californio]]s about whether California should remain with Mexico; seek independence; or become annexed to the United Kingdom, France, or the United States. The 1845 removal of [[Manuel Micheltorena]], the latest governor to be sent by Mexico and forcefully ejected by the Californians, resulted in a divided government.  The region south of [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]] was ruled by Governor [[P\u00edo Pico]] with his capital in ''The Town of Our Lady the Queen of Angels of the Porci\u00fancula River'', now known as  [[Los Angeles]].  The area to the north of the pueblo of [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]] was under the control of Alta California's [[commander (rank)#Latin America|''Commandante'']] [[Jos\u00e9 Castro]] with headquarters near [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], the traditional capital and, significantly, the location of the [[Old Customhouse (Monterey, California)|Customhouse]]. Pico and Castro disliked each other personally and soon began escalating disputes over control of the Customhouse income.<ref>Walker pp. 42\u201343</ref>\n\nDecrees issued by the central government in Mexico City were often acknowledged and supported with proclamations but ignored in practice.  By the end of 1845, when rumors of a military force being sent from Mexico proved to be false, rulings by the other district government were mostly ignored.<ref>Bancroft IV:540\u2013545</ref>\n\n===Texas, immigration and land===\n[[File:Polkpolk.jpg|175px|thumb|left|U.S. President [[James K. Polk]] favored expansionist policies that led to the annexation of Texas and California.]]\n\nThe relationship between the United States and Mexico had been deteriorating for some time.  Texas, which Mexico still considered to be its territory, had been admitted to statehood in 1845.<ref>Hague p 99</ref>  Mexico had earlier threatened war if this happened.<ref name=\"Walker p. 60\">Walker p. 60</ref>  [[James K. Polk]] was elected President of the United States in 1844, and considered his election a mandate for his expansionist policies.<ref>Walker p. 58</ref>\n\nMexican law had long allowed grants of land to [[naturalized]] Mexican citizens.  Obtaining Mexican citizenship was not difficult and many earlier American immigrants had gone through the process and obtained free grants of land.  That same year (1845) anticipation of war with the United States and the increasing number of immigrants reportedly coming from the United States resulted in orders from Mexico City denying immigrants from the United States entry into California.<ref>Hague p.118</ref>  The orders also required California's officials not to allow land grants, sales or even rental of land to non-citizen emigrants already in California.  All non-citizen immigrants, who had arrived without permission, were threatened with being forced out of California.<ref>Bancroft; IV:598\u2013608</ref>\n\nAlta California's Sub-Prefect [[Francisco Guerrero (politician)|Francisco Guerrero]] had written to U.S. Consul [[Thomas O. Larkin]] that:\n{{quote|a multitude of foreigners [having] come into California and bought fixed property [land], a right of [[Naturalization|naturalized foreigners]] only, he was under the necessity of notifying the authorities in each town to inform such purchasers that the transactions were invalid and they themselves subject to be expelled whenever the government might find it convenient.<ref name=\"Richman p 308\"/>}}\n\n[[File:Jose Castro.jpg|150px|thumb|right|California's ''Commandante General'' [[Jos\u00e9 Castro]] commanded Mexican military forces in Alta California.]]\n\nDuring November 1845, California's ''Commandante General'' Jos\u00e9 Castro met with representatives of the 1845 American immigrants at Sonoma and Sutter's Fort.  In his decree dated November 6 he wrote: \"Therefore conciliating my duty [to enforce the orders from Mexico] with of the sentiment of hospitality which distinguishes the Mexicans, and considering that most of said expedition is composed of families and industrious people, I have deemed it best to permit them, provisionally, to remain in the department\" with the conditions that they obey all laws, apply within three months for a license to settle, and promise to depart if that license was not granted.<ref>Bancroft IV: \npp. 606\u20137</ref>\n\n===Captain Fr\u00e9mont in California===\n[[File:John C. Fremont at National Portrait Gallery IMG 4410.JPG|175px|thumb|left|The rebellion was covertly encouraged by U.S. Army Brevet Captain [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]].]]\nA 62-man exploring and mapping expedition entered California in late 1845 under the command of U.S. Army Brevet Captain [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]]. Fr\u00e9mont was well known in the United States as an author and explorer. He was also the son-in-law of expansionist U.S. Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]]. Early in 1846 Fr\u00e9mont acted provocatively with California's ''Commandante General'' Jos\u00e9 Castro near the pueblo of [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] and then moved his group out of California into [[Oregon Country]]. He was followed into Oregon by U.S. Marine Lt [[Archibald H. Gillespie]] who had been sent from Washington with a secret message to U.S. Consul [[Thomas O. Larkin]] and instructions to share the message with Fr\u00e9mont. Gillespie also brought a packet of letters from Fr\u00e9mont's wife and father-in-law.<ref>Hague p. 128</ref>\n\nFr\u00e9mont's thoughts (as related in his book, written forty years later) after reading the message and letters were: \"I saw the way opening clear before me.  War with Mexico was inevitable; and a grand opportunity presented itself to realize in their fullest extent the far-sighted views of Senator Benton. I resolved to move forward on the opportunity and return forthwith to the [[Sacramento valley]] in order to bring to bear all the influence I could command.\"<ref>Fr\u00e9mont p. 490</ref>  Nevertheless, Fr\u00e9mont needed to be circumspect. As a military officer he could face [[court-martial]] for violating the [[Neutrality Act of 1794]] that made it illegal for an American to wage war against another country at peace with the United States. The next morning Gillespie and Fr\u00e9mont's group departed for California.  Fr\u00e9mont returned to the Sacramento Valley and set up camp near [[Sutter Buttes]].<ref>Harlow p. 85</ref>\n\n===USS ''Portsmouth'' in the San Francisco Bay===\n[[File:USS Portsmouth-Full Sail.jpg|150px|thumb|right|{{USS|Portsmouth|1843|6}} supplied money, materiel, and supplies to the Bear Republic rebels.]]\n\nU.S. Consul [[Thomas O.

In response, the {{USS|Portsmouth|1843|6}} arrived at [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] on April 22, 1846.   After receiving information about Fr\u00e9mont's returning to California, Consul Larkin and ''Portsmouth's'' captain [[John Berrien Montgomery]] decided the ship should move into the [[San Francisco Bay]].

Capt. Fremont invites every freeman in the valley to come to his camp at the Butts [sic], immediately; and he hopes to stay the enemy and put a stop to his\" \u2013 (Here the sheet was folded and worn in-two, and no more is found).<ref>Ide pp. 112\u20133</ref>  Ide and other settlers quickly traveled to Fr\u00e9mont's camp but were generally dissatisfied by the lack of a specific plan and their inability to obtain from Fr\u00e9mont any definite promise of aid.<ref>Bancroft V:104</ref>\n\n===Taking of government horses===\nSome of the group who had been meeting with Fr\u00e9mont departed from his camp and, on June 10, 1846, captured a herd of 170 Mexican government-owned horses being moved by ''[[Californio]]'' soldiers from San Rafael and Sonoma to the Californian ''Commandante General'', [[Jos\u00e9 Castro]], in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]].  It had been reported amongst the emigrants that the officer in charge of the herd had made statements threatening that the horses would be used by Castro to drive the foreigners out of California.  The captured horses were taken to Fr\u00e9mont's new camp at the junction of the Feather and Bear rivers.<ref>Bancroft V:101\u2013108</ref>\n\nThese men next determined to seize the ''pueblo'' of Sonoma to deny the ''Californios'' a rallying point north of [[San Francisco Bay]].<ref name=\"Bancroft V:109\">Bancroft V:109</ref>  Capturing both the arms and military materiel stored in the unmanned [[Presidio of Sonoma]] and Mexican Lieutenant Colonel [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]] would delay any military response from the ''Californios''.  The insurgent group was nominally led by Ezekiel \"Stuttering Zeke\" Merritt, whom Fr\u00e9mont described as his \"field-lieutenant\" and lauded for not questioning him.<ref>Fr\u00e9mont p. 509</ref><ref>CSMM</ref>\n\n===Capture of Sonoma===\n[[File:BearFlagMonument.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Bear Flag monument in [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] commemorating its capture by rebels]]\n\nHistorian George Tays has cautioned \"The description of the men, their actions just prior and subsequent to the taking of Sonoma, are as varied as the number of authors.  No two accounts agree, and it is impossible to determine the truth of their statements.\" <ref>Tays p.240 Note 1</ref> Historian H. H. Bancroft has written that Fr\u00e9mont \"instigated and planned\" the horse raid, and incited the American settlers indirectly and \"guardedly\" to revolt.<ref name=\"Walker p. 121\">Walker p. 121</ref>\n\nBefore dawn on Sunday, June 14, 1846, over 30 American insurgents arrived at the pueblo of Sonoma. They had traveled overnight from Napa Valley.  A majority of their number had started a couple of days earlier from Fremont's camp in the Sacramento valley but others had joined the group along the way. Meeting no resistance, they approached ''Comandante'' Vallejo's home and pounded on his door.  After a few minutes Vallejo opened the door dressed in his Mexican Army uniform.  Communication was not good until American [[Jacob P. Leese]] (Vallejo's brother-in-law) was summoned to translate.<ref>Harlow pp. 98\u201399</ref>\n\nVallejo then invited the [[Filibuster (military)|filibusters']] leaders into his home to negotiate terms.  Two other Californio officers and [[Jacob P. Leese|Leese]] joined the negotiations.  The insurgents waiting outside sent elected \"captains\" [[John Grigsby (soldier)|John Grigsby]] and [[William B. Ide|William Ide]] inside to speed the proceedings.  The effect of Vallejo's hospitality in the form of wine and brandy for the negotiators and someone else's barrel of ''[[aguardiente]]'' for those outside is debatable.  However, when the agreement was presented to those outside they refused to endorse it.  Rather than releasing the Mexican officers under parole they insisted they be held as hostages.  John Grigsby refused to remain as leader of the group, stating he had been deceived by Fr\u00e9mont.  William Ide gave an impassioned speech urging the rebels to stay in Sonoma and start a new republic.<ref>Walker pp. 125\u20136</ref>  Referring to the stolen horses Ide ended his oration with \"Choose ye this day what you will be!  We are robbers, or we ''must'' be conquerors!\"<ref>Harlow p. 102</ref>\n\nAt that time, Vallejo and his three associates were placed on horseback and taken to Fr\u00e9mont accompanied by eight or nine of the insurgents who did not favor forming a new republic under the circumstances.<ref>Bancroft V:117</ref> That night they camped at the Vaca Rancho.  Some young Californio ''vigilantes'' under Juan Padilla evaded the guards, aroused Vallejo and offered to help him escape.  Vallejo declined, wanting to avoid any bloodshed and anticipating that Fr\u00e9mont would release him on parole.<ref>Harlow p.101</ref>\n\nThe [[Sonoma Barracks]] became the headquarters for the remaining twenty-four rebels, who within a few days created their Bear Flag (see the \"Bear Flag\" section below). After the flag was raised [[Californio]]s called the insurgents ''Los Osos'' (The Bears) and \"Bear Flaggers\" because of their flag and in derision of their often scruffy appearance.  The rebels embraced the expression, and their uprising, which they originally called the ''Popular Movement'', became known as the ''Bear Flag Revolt''.<ref>SSHP p. 82</ref>  Henry L. Ford was elected First Lieutenant of the company and obtained promises of obedience to orders.<ref name=\"Harlow p. 103\"/>  Samuel Kelsey was elected Second Lieutenant, Grandville P.

Ide wrote a proclamation announcing and explaining the reasons for the revolt during the night of June 14\u201315, 1846 (below).  There were additional copies and some more moderate versions (produced in both English and Spanish) distributed around northern California through June 18.<ref>Rogers, ''Ide'' p. 82, Appendix A</ref>\n{{Quotation\n|To all persons, citizens of Sonoma, requesting them to remain at peace, and to follow their rightful occupations without fear of molestation.\n\nThe Commander in Chief of the Troops assembled at the Fortress of Sonoma gives his inviolable pledge to all persons in California not found under arms that they shall not be disturbed in their persons, their property or social relations one to another by men under his command.\n\nHe also solemnly declares his object to be First, to defend himself and companions in arms who were invited to this country by a promise of Lands on which to settle themselves and families who were also promised a \"republican government,\" who, when having arrived in California were denied even the privilege of buying or renting Lands of their friends, who instead of being allowed to participate in or being protected by a \"Republican Government\" were oppressed by a \"Military Despotism,\" who were even threatened, by \"Proclamation\" from the Chief Officer of the aforesaid Despotism, with extermination if they would not depart out of the Country, leaving all of their property, their arms and beasts of burden, and thus deprived of the means of flight or defense. We were to be driven through deserts, inhabited by hostile Indians to certain destruction. To overthrow a Government which has seized upon the property of the Missions for its individual aggrandizement; which has ruined and shamefully oppressed the laboring people of California, by their enormous exactions on goods imported into this country; is the determined purpose of the brave men who are associated under his command.\n\nHe also solemnly declares his object in the Second place to be to invite all peaceable and good Citizens of California who are friendly to the maintenance of good order and equal rights (and I do hereby invite them to repair to my camp at Sonoma without delay) to assist us in establishing and perpetuating a \"Republican Government\" which shall secure to all: civil and religious liberty; which shall detect and punish crime; which shall encourage industry, virtue and literature; which shall leave unshackled by Fetters, Commerce, Agriculture, and Mechanism.\n\nHe further declares that he relies upon the rectitude of our intentions; the favor of Heaven and the bravery of those who are bound to and associated with him, by the principle of self preservation; by the love of truth; and by the hatred of tyranny for his hopes of success.\n\nHe further declares that he believes that a Government to be prosperous and happyfying [sic] in its tendency must originate with its people who are friendly to its existence. That its Citizens are its Guardians, its officers are its Servants, and its Glory their reward.  |William B. Ide|Head Quarters Sonoma|June 15, 1846\n}}\n\n===Need for gunpowder===\nA major problem for the Bears in Sonoma was the lack of sufficient [[gunpowder]] to defend against the expected Mexican attack.  William Todd was dispatched on Monday the fifteenth, with a letter<ref group=notes>{{cite web |url=http://www.bearflagmuseum.org/June%2015_1846%20William%20B%20Ide%20Letter%20to%20Stockton%20Montgomery.html |title=Ide's Letter |date= June 15, 1846}}</ref> to be delivered to the [[USS Portsmouth (1843)|USS ''Portsmouth'']] telling of the events in Sonoma and describing themselves as \"fellow country men\". Todd, having been instructed not to repeat any of the requests in the letter (refers to their need for gunpowder), disregarded that and voiced the request for gunpowder.  Captain Montgomery, while sympathetic, declined because of his country's neutrality.<ref>Bancroft V:156</ref>  Todd, Jos\u00e9 de Rosa (the messenger Vallejo sent to Montgomery), and U.S. Navy Lieutenant John S. Misroon returned to Sonoma in the Portsmouth's launch the morning of the 16th.  Misroon's mission was, without interfering with the revolt, to prevent violence to noncombatants.<ref>Harlow p. 104</ref>\n\nTodd was given a second assignment.  He was sent to Bodega Bay with an unnamed companion (sometimes called 'the Englishman') to obtain powder from American settlers in that area.<ref name=\"Walker p. 132\">Walker p. 132</ref>  On June 18, Bears Thomas Cowie and George Fowler were sent to ''Rancho Sotoyome'' (near current-day [[Healdsburg, California]]) to pick up a cache of gunpowder from Moses Carson, brother of Fr\u00e9mont's scout [[Kit Carson]].<ref>Bancroft pp. 155\u201359</ref>\n\n===Sutter's Fort===\n[[File:Sutter's Fort colored engraving 1849.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Sutter's Fort]] was one of two rebel strongholds, having been seized from John Sutter by John Fr\u00e9mont (c.  1849).]]\n\nFr\u00e9mont's \"field-lieutenant\" Merritt returned to Sacramento (known as New Helvetia at the time, so named by the Swiss John Sutter) on June 16 with his prisoners and recounted the events in Sonoma. Fr\u00e9mont either was fearful of going against the popular sentiment at Sonoma or saw the advantages of holding the ''Californio'' officers as hostages.  He also decided to imprison Governor Vallejo's brother-in-law, the American Jacob Leese, in [[Sutter's Fort]].<ref>Bancroft V:120\u201321</ref>  Fr\u00e9mont recounts in his memoirs, \"Affairs had now assumed a critical aspect and I presently saw that the time had come when it was unsafe to leave events to mature under unfriendly, or mistaken, direction \u2026 I knew the facts of the situation.

He issued two proclamations on June 17.  The first asked the citizens of California to come to the aid of their country.  The second promised protection for all foreigners not involved in the revolt.  A group of 50\u201360 militia under command of Captain [[Rancho Arroyo Seco (Torre)|Joaquin de la Torre]] traveled up to [[San Pablo, California|San Pablo]] and, by boat, westward across the [[San Francisco Bay]] to [[San Quentin, California|Point San Quentin]] on the 23rd.  Two additional divisions with a total of about 100 men arrived at San Pablo on June 27.<ref name=\"Bancroft V:132-136\">Bancroft V:132\u2013136</ref>\n\n===Battle of Ol\u00fampali===\nOn June 20 when the procurement parties failed to return as expected, Lieutenant Ford sent Sergeant Gibson with four men to ''Rancho Sotoyome''.  Gibson obtained the powder and on the way back fought with several Californians and captured one of them.  From the prisoner they learned that Cowie and Fowler had died.  There are [[Californio]] and ''Oso'' versions of what had happened.  Ford also learned that William Todd and his companion had been captured by the [[Californio]] irregulars led by Juan Padilla and Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Carrillo.<ref name=\"Walker p. 132\"/>\n\nFord writes, in his biography, that before leaving Sonoma to search for the other two captives and Padilla's men, he sent a note to Ezekiel Merritt in Sacramento asking him to gather volunteers to help defend Sonoma.  Ide's version is that Ford wrote to Fr\u00e9mont saying that the Bears had lost confidence in Ide's leadership.  In either case, Ford then rode toward Santa Rosa with seventeen to nineteen Bears.  Not finding Padilla, the Bears headed toward one of his homes near [[Two Rock, California|Two Rock]].  The following morning the Bears captured three or four men near the [[Rancho Laguna de San Antonio]] and unexpectedly discovered what they assumed was Juan Padilla's group near the Indian rancho of [[Olumpali, California|Ol\u00fampali]].<ref name=\"Harlow p. 108-9\">Harlow pp. 108\u20139</ref>  Ford approached the adobe but more men appeared and others came \"pouring out of the adobe\".  Militiamen from south of the Bay, led by Mexican Captain Joaquin de la Torre, had joined with Padilla's irregulars and now numbered about seventy.  Ford's men positioned themselves in a grove of trees and opened fire when the enemy charged on horseback, killing one Californio and wounding another. During the ensuing [[Battle of Olompali|long-range battle]], William Todd and his companion escaped from the house where they were being held and ran to the Bears. The Californios disengaged from the long-range fighting after suffering a few wounded and returned to San Rafael.<ref>Rogers: Ide p.51</ref> A Californian militiaman reported that their muskets could not shoot as far as the rifles used by some Bears.<ref>Bancroft v:166 note 15</ref> This was the only battle fought during the Bear Flag Revolt.<ref>Walker pp. 132\u201335</ref>\n\nThe deaths of Cowie and Fowler, as well as the lethal battle, raised the anxiety of both the Californios, who left the area for safety, and the immigrants, who moved into Sonoma to be under the protection of the muskets and cannon that had been taken from the [[Sonoma Barracks]]. This increased the number in Sonoma to about two hundred.<ref name=\"Bancroft V:109\"/> Some immigrant families were housed in the Barracks, others in the homes of the Californios.<ref name=\"Harlow p. 108-9\"/><ref>Warner pp. 479\u2013482 Appendix VII</ref>\n\n===Fr\u00e9mont arrives to defend Sonoma===\n[[File:Historic American Buildings Survey George Gibbs Drawing of 1851 Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collection VIEW FROM WEST - Sonoma Plaza, Bear Flag Flagstaff, Sonoma, Sonoma County, CA HABS CAL,49-SONO,7-1.tif|300px|thumb|left|[[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] was a tiny Hispanic settlement in 1846, drawn here as it was in 1851.]]\n\nHaving learned of Ford's request for volunteers to defend Sonoma and hearing reports that General Castro was preparing an attack, Fr\u00e9mont left his camp near Sutter's Fort for Sonoma on June 23.  With him were ninety men \u2013 his own party plus trappers and settlers under Samuel J. Hensley.  Fr\u00e9mont would say in his memoirs that he wrote a letter of resignation from the Army and sent it to his father-in-law [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas Hart Benton]] in case the government should wish to disavow his action.  They arrived at Sonoma in the early morning of the 25th and by noon were on their way to [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]] accompanied by a contingent of Bears under Ford's command.  They arrived at the former San Rafael mission but the Californios had vanished.  The rebels set up camp in the old mission and sent out scouting parties.<ref>Harlow p, 108\u2013110</ref><ref>Walker pp. 134\u20135</ref>\n\nOn Sunday the 28th a small boat was spotted coming across the bay.  Kit Carson and some companions went to intercept it.  It held twin brothers Francisco and Ram\u00f3n de Haro, their uncle Jos\u00e9 de la Reyes Berreyesa, and an oarsman (probably one of the Castro brothers from San Pablo) \u2013 all unarmed.  The Haro brothers and Berreyesa were dropped off at the shoreline and started on foot for the mission.  All three were shot and killed.  Beyond that almost every fact is disputed.  Some say Fr\u00e9mont ordered the killings.  Others, that they were carrying secret messages from Castro to Torre.  Others that Carson committed the homicides as revenge for the deaths of Cowie and Fowler or they were shot by Fr\u00e9mont's Delaware Indians.  This incident became an issue in Fr\u00e9mont's later campaign for President.  Partisan eyewitnesses and newspapers related totally conflicting stories.<ref>Bancroft V:171\u20134</ref><ref>Harlow p.110</ref>\n\n===Captain de la Torre's ruse===\nLate the same afternoon as the killings a scouting party intercepted a letter indicating that Torre intended to attack Sonoma the following morning.  Fr\u00e9mont felt there was no choice but to return to defend Sonoma as quickly as possible.  The garrison there had found a similar letter and had all weapons loaded and at the ready before dawn the next day when Fr\u00e9mont and Ford's forces approached Sonoma \u2013 almost provoking firing by the garrison.  Fr\u00e9mont, understanding that he had been tricked, left again for San Rafael after a hasty breakfast.  He arrived back at the old mission within twenty-four hours of leaving but during that period Torre and his men had time to escape to San Pablo via boat.  Torre had successfully used the ruse not only to escape  but almost succeeded in provoking a 'friendly fire' incident among the insurgents.<ref>Bancroft V;174\u20136</ref>\n\nAfter reaching San Pablo, Torre reported that the combined rebel force was too strong to be attacked as planned.  All three of Castro's divisions then returned to the old headquarters near [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] where a council of war was held on June 30.  It was decided that the current plan must be abandoned and any new approach would require the cooperation of Pio Pico and his southern forces.  A messenger was sent to the Governor.  Meanwhile, the army moved southwards to [[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan]] where General Castro was, on July 6, when he learned of the events in Monterey.<ref>Bancroft V:136</ref>\n\n===Actions in and around Yerba Buena===\nOn July 1, Fr\u00e9mont and twelve men convinced Captain William Phelps to ferry them in the ''Moscow'''s launch to the [[Fort Point, San Francisco|old Spanish fort]] at the entrance to the [[Golden Gate]].  They landed without resistance and spiked the ten old, abandoned cannon.  The next day [[Robert B. Semple]] led ten Bears in the launch to the pueblo of [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (the future San Francisco) to arrest the naturalized Englishman Robert Ridley who was captain of the port.  Ridley was sent to Sutter's Fort to be locked up with other prisoners.<ref>Harlow p. 111</ref>\n\n===Independence Day, 1846, in Sonoma===\n\nA great celebration was held on the [[Fourth of July]] beginning with readings of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in Sonoma's plaza.  There were also cannon salutes, the roasting of whole beeves, and the consumption of many foods and all manner of beverages.  Fr\u00e9mont and the contingent from San Rafael arrived in time for the [[fandango]] held in Salvador Vallejo's big adobe on the corner of the town square.<ref>Walker p. 138\u20139</ref>\n\n===Formation of the California Battalion===\n\nOn July 5, Fr\u00e9mont called a public meeting and proposed to the Bears that they unite with his party and form a single military unit.  He said that he would accept command if they would pledge obedience, proceed honorably, and not violate the chastity of women. A compact was drawn up which all volunteers of the [[California Battalion]] signed or made their marks.<ref>Bancroft V:178\u201380</ref> A majority of those present also agreed to officially date the era of independence not from the taking of Sonoma but from July 5 to allow Fr\u00e9mont to \"begin at the beginning\".<ref>Harlow p. 112</ref>\n\nThe next day Fr\u00e9mont, leaving the fifty men of Company B at the Barracks to defend Sonoma, left with the rest of the Battalion for Sutter's Fort. They took with them two of the captured Mexican field pieces, as well as muskets, a supply of ammunition, blankets, horses, and cattle.<ref>Bancroft V:184\u20135</ref>  The seven-ton ''Mermaid'' was used for transporting the cannon, arms, ammunition and saddles from Napa to Sutter's Fort.<ref>Rogers: Ide p. 56</ref>\n\n===U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps capture Monterey===\nWar against Mexico had already been declared by the United States Congress on May 13, 1846.  Because of the slow cross-continent communication of the time, no one in California knew that conclusively.  (Official notice of the war finally reached California on August 12, 1846.)<ref>Harlow p. 121</ref>  [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[John D. Sloat]], commanding the U.S. Navy's [[Pacific Squadron]], had been waiting in [[Monterey Bay]] since July 1 or 2 to obtain convincing proof of war.  Sloat was 65 years old and had requested to be relieved from his command the previous May.  He was also acutely aware of the 1842 [[Capture of Monterey]], when his predecessor, [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Thomas ap Catesby Jones]], thought war had been declared and captured the capital of Alta California, only to discover his error and abandon it the next day.  This resulted in diplomatic problems, and Jones was removed as commander of the Pacific Squadron.\n\nSloat had learned of Fr\u00e9mont's confrontation with the Californios on [[Fremont Peak (California)|Gavilan Peak]] and of his support for the Bears in Sonoma.  He was also aware of Lt. Gillespie's  tracking down of Fr\u00e9mont with letters and orders.  Sloat finally concluded on July 6 that he needed to act, saying to U.S. Consul [[Thomas O. Larkin|Larkin]], \"I shall be blamed for doing too little or too much \u2013 I prefer the latter.\"<ref>Harlow p. 122</ref>  Early July 7, the [[frigate]] [[USS Savannah (1842)|USS ''Savannah'']] and the two [[Sloop-of-war|sloops]], [[USS Cyane (1837)|USS ''Cyane'']] and [[USS Levant (1837)|USS ''Levant'']] of the [[United States Navy]], captured [[Monterey, California]], and raised the flag of the United States.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/biographies/john_sloat.html \"Commodore John Sloat\"].

Montgomery]].  John E. wrote to his mother later in July that \"Cuffy came down growling\".  The following November, John and his older brother disappeared while traveling to Sacramento and were presumed deceased. Commander Montgomery kept the Bear Flag, had a copy made, and eventually both were delivered to the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]]. In 1855 the Secretary sent both flags to the Senators from California who donated them to the Society of Pioneers in San Francisco.  The original Bear Flag was destroyed in the fires following the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bear Flag Museum|title=History of the Bear Flag|url=http://www.bearflagmuseum.org/|accessdate=May 18, 2014}}</ref> A replica, created in 1896 for the 50th Anniversary celebrations, is on display at the [[Sonoma Barracks]].\n\n==Bear Flag==\n{{main|Bear Flag}}\n[[File:Original_Storm_bear_flag.jpeg|left|thumb|175px|The First [[Bear Flag]], by Peter Storm photographed ca 1870]]\n[[File:Original_Todd_bear_flag.jpg|left|thumb|175px|The original of Todd's [[Bear Flag]], photographed in 1890]]\n[[File:Flag of California.svg|right|thumb|175px|Modern flag of the State of California, for comparison]]\n\nThe most notable legacy of the \"California Republic\" was the adoption of its flag as the basis of the modern state [[Flag of California]].

Todd (1818\u20131879) wrote an account of the Bear Flag used at the storming of Sonoma, perhaps the first to be raised.<ref>[http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=LAH18780113.2.3&srpos=5&e=--1878---1879-187-en--20--1-byDA-txt-txIN-Bear+flag-------1 \"A Note from the Painter of the Original Bear Flag,\" Los Angeles Herald, Volume 9, Number 41, 13 January 1878].</ref> Soon after, his implementation became the basis for the first official State flag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bearflagmuseum.org/JHusseyArticle.html |title=Bear Flag Museum| accessdate= June 13, 2008}}</ref>  Todd acknowledged the contributions of other ''Osos'' to the flag, including [[Granville P. Swift]], Peter Storm, and Henry L. Ford in an 1878 [http://www.bearflagmuseum.org/ToddinLAExpress1878.html newspaper article].   Todd painted the flag on domestic cotton cloth, roughly a yard and a half in length. It featured a red star based on the [[Flag of California#California Lone Star Flag|California Lone Star Flag]] that was flown during California's 1836 revolt led by [[Juan Bautista Alvarado|Juan Alvarado]] and [[Isaac Graham]].<ref name=\"flags over ca\">{{Cite book | title = Flags over California, A History and Guide| place = Sacramento | publisher = State of California, Military Department | year = 2002 | url = http://www.militarymuseum.org/Flags_Over_Ca.pdf}}</ref> The flag also featured an image of a grizzly bear [[Salient (heraldry)|salient]] or [[rampant]] (standing).

It had evolved into a semi-autonomous region with open discussions among [[Californio]]s about whether California should remain with Mexico; seek independence; or become annexed to the United Kingdom, France, or the United States. The 1845 removal of [[Manuel Micheltorena]], the latest governor to be sent by Mexico and forcefully ejected by the Californians, resulted in a divided government.  The region south of [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]] was ruled by Governor [[P\u00edo Pico]] with his capital in ''The Town of Our Lady the Queen of Angels of the Porci\u00fancula River'', now known as  [[Los Angeles]].  The area to the north of the pueblo of [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]] was under the control of Alta California's [[commander (rank)#Latin America|''Commandante'']] [[Jos\u00e9 Castro]] with headquarters near [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], the traditional capital and, significantly, the location of the [[Old Customhouse (Monterey, California)|Customhouse]]. Pico and Castro disliked each other personally and soon began escalating disputes over control of the Customhouse income.<ref>Walker pp. 42\u201343</ref>\n\nDecrees issued by the central government in Mexico City were often acknowledged and supported with proclamations but ignored in practice.  By the end of 1845, when rumors of a military force being sent from Mexico proved to be false, rulings by the other district government were mostly ignored.<ref>Bancroft IV:540\u2013545</ref>\n\n===Texas, immigration and land===\n[[File:Polkpolk.jpg|175px|thumb|left|U.S. President [[James K. Polk]] favored expansionist policies that led to the annexation of Texas and California.]]\n\nThe relationship between the United States and Mexico had been deteriorating for some time.  Texas, which Mexico still considered to be its territory, had been admitted to statehood in 1845.<ref>Hague p 99</ref>  Mexico had earlier threatened war if this happened.<ref name=\"Walker p. 60\">Walker p. 60</ref>  [[James K. Polk]] was elected President of the United States in 1844, and considered his election a mandate for his expansionist policies.<ref>Walker p. 58</ref>\n\nMexican law had long allowed grants of land to [[naturalized]] Mexican citizens.  Obtaining Mexican citizenship was not difficult and many earlier American immigrants had gone through the process and obtained free grants of land.  That same year (1845) anticipation of war with the United States and the increasing number of immigrants reportedly coming from the United States resulted in orders from Mexico City denying immigrants from the United States entry into California.<ref>Hague p.118</ref>  The orders also required California's officials not to allow land grants, sales or even rental of land to non-citizen emigrants already in California.  All non-citizen immigrants, who had arrived without permission, were threatened with being forced out of California.<ref>Bancroft; IV:598\u2013608</ref>\n\nAlta California's Sub-Prefect [[Francisco Guerrero (politician)|Francisco Guerrero]] had written to U.S. Consul [[Thomas O. Larkin]] that:\n{{quote|a multitude of foreigners [having] come into California and bought fixed property [land], a right of [[Naturalization|naturalized foreigners]] only, he was under the necessity of notifying the authorities in each town to inform such purchasers that the transactions were invalid and they themselves subject to be expelled whenever the government might find it convenient.<ref name=\"Richman p 308\"/>}}\n\n[[File:Jose Castro.jpg|150px|thumb|right|California's ''Commandante General'' [[Jos\u00e9 Castro]] commanded Mexican military forces in Alta California.]]\n\nDuring November 1845, California's ''Commandante General'' Jos\u00e9 Castro met with representatives of the 1845 American immigrants at Sonoma and Sutter's Fort.  In his decree dated November 6 he wrote: \"Therefore conciliating my duty [to enforce the orders from Mexico] with of the sentiment of hospitality which distinguishes the Mexicans, and considering that most of said expedition is composed of families and industrious people, I have deemed it best to permit them, provisionally, to remain in the department\" with the conditions that they obey all laws, apply within three months for a license to settle, and promise to depart if that license was not granted.<ref>Bancroft IV: \npp. 606\u20137</ref>\n\n===Captain Fr\u00e9mont in California===\n[[File:John C.

Fr\u00e9mont was well known in the United States as an author and explorer. He was also the son-in-law of expansionist U.S. Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]]. Early in 1846 Fr\u00e9mont acted provocatively with California's ''Commandante General'' Jos\u00e9 Castro near the pueblo of [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] and then moved his group out of California into [[Oregon Country]]. He was followed into Oregon by U.S. Marine Lt [[Archibald H. Gillespie]] who had been sent from Washington with a secret message to U.S. Consul [[Thomas O. Larkin]] and instructions to share the message with Fr\u00e9mont. Gillespie also brought a packet of letters from Fr\u00e9mont's wife and father-in-law.<ref>Hague p. 128</ref>\n\nFr\u00e9mont's thoughts (as related in his book, written forty years later) after reading the message and letters were: \"I saw the way opening clear before me.  War with Mexico was inevitable; and a grand opportunity presented itself to realize in their fullest extent the far-sighted views of Senator Benton. I resolved to move forward on the opportunity and return forthwith to the [[Sacramento valley]] in order to bring to bear all the influence I could command.\"<ref>Fr\u00e9mont p. 490</ref>  Nevertheless, Fr\u00e9mont needed to be circumspect. As a military officer he could face [[court-martial]] for violating the [[Neutrality Act of 1794]] that made it illegal for an American to wage war against another country at peace with the United States. The next morning Gillespie and Fr\u00e9mont's group departed for California.  Fr\u00e9mont returned to the Sacramento Valley and set up camp near [[Sutter Buttes]].<ref>Harlow p. 85</ref>\n\n===USS ''Portsmouth'' in the San Francisco Bay===\n[[File:USS Portsmouth-Full Sail.jpg|150px|thumb|right|{{USS|Portsmouth|1843|6}} supplied money, materiel, and supplies to the Bear Republic rebels.]]\n\nU.S. Consul [[Thomas O. Larkin]], concerned about the increasing possibility of war, sent a request to [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[John D. Sloat]] of U.S. Navy's [[Pacific Squadron]], for a warship to protect U.S. citizens and interests in [[Alta California]].  In response, the {{USS|Portsmouth|1843|6}} arrived at [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] on April 22, 1846.   After receiving information about Fr\u00e9mont's returning to California, Consul Larkin and ''Portsmouth's'' captain [[John Berrien Montgomery]] decided the ship should move into the [[San Francisco Bay]]. She sailed from Monterey on June 1.<ref>Rogers ''Montgomery'' pp. 21\u201323</ref>\n\nLt.

Ide]], a future leader of the Revolt, writes of receiving an unsigned written message on June 8, 1846:  \"Notice is hereby given, that a large body of armed Spaniards on horseback, amounting to 250 men, have been seen on their way to the Sacramento Valley, destroying crops and burning houses, and driving off the cattle.  Capt. Fremont invites every freeman in the valley to come to his camp at the Butts [sic], immediately; and he hopes to stay the enemy and put a stop to his\" \u2013 (Here the sheet was folded and worn in-two, and no more is found).<ref>Ide pp. 112\u20133</ref>  Ide and other settlers quickly traveled to Fr\u00e9mont's camp but were generally dissatisfied by the lack of a specific plan and their inability to obtain from Fr\u00e9mont any definite promise of aid.<ref>Bancroft V:104</ref>\n\n===Taking of government horses===\nSome of the group who had been meeting with Fr\u00e9mont departed from his camp and, on June 10, 1846, captured a herd of 170 Mexican government-owned horses being moved by ''[[Californio]]'' soldiers from San Rafael and Sonoma to the Californian ''Commandante General'', [[Jos\u00e9 Castro]], in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]].  It had been reported amongst the emigrants that the officer in charge of the herd had made statements threatening that the horses would be used by Castro to drive the foreigners out of California.  The captured horses were taken to Fr\u00e9mont's new camp at the junction of the Feather and Bear rivers.<ref>Bancroft V:101\u2013108</ref>\n\nThese men next determined to seize the ''pueblo'' of Sonoma to deny the ''Californios'' a rallying point north of [[San Francisco Bay]].<ref name=\"Bancroft V:109\">Bancroft V:109</ref>  Capturing both the arms and military materiel stored in the unmanned [[Presidio of Sonoma]] and Mexican Lieutenant Colonel [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]] would delay any military response from the ''Californios''.  The insurgent group was nominally led by Ezekiel \"Stuttering Zeke\" Merritt, whom Fr\u00e9mont described as his \"field-lieutenant\" and lauded for not questioning him.<ref>Fr\u00e9mont p. 509</ref><ref>CSMM</ref>\n\n===Capture of Sonoma===\n[[File:BearFlagMonument.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Bear Flag monument in [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] commemorating its capture by rebels]]\n\nHistorian George Tays has cautioned \"The description of the men, their actions just prior and subsequent to the taking of Sonoma, are as varied as the number of authors.  No two accounts agree, and it is impossible to determine the truth of their statements.\" <ref>Tays p.240 Note 1</ref> Historian H. H. Bancroft has written that Fr\u00e9mont \"instigated and planned\" the horse raid, and incited the American settlers indirectly and \"guardedly\" to revolt.<ref name=\"Walker p. 121\">Walker p. 121</ref>\n\nBefore dawn on Sunday, June 14, 1846, over 30 American insurgents arrived at the pueblo of Sonoma. They had traveled overnight from Napa Valley.  A majority of their number had started a couple of days earlier from Fremont's camp in the Sacramento valley but others had joined the group along the way. Meeting no resistance, they approached ''Comandante'' Vallejo's home and pounded on his door.  After a few minutes Vallejo opened the door dressed in his Mexican Army uniform.  Communication was not good until American [[Jacob P. Leese]] (Vallejo's brother-in-law) was summoned to translate.<ref>Harlow pp. 98\u201399</ref>\n\nVallejo then invited the [[Filibuster (military)|filibusters']] leaders into his home to negotiate terms.  Two other Californio officers and [[Jacob P. Leese|Leese]] joined the negotiations.  The insurgents waiting outside sent elected \"captains\" [[John Grigsby (soldier)|John Grigsby]] and [[William B. Ide|William Ide]] inside to speed the proceedings.  The effect of Vallejo's hospitality in the form of wine and brandy for the negotiators and someone else's barrel of ''[[aguardiente]]'' for those outside is debatable.  However, when the agreement was presented to those outside they refused to endorse it.  Rather than releasing the Mexican officers under parole they insisted they be held as hostages.  John Grigsby refused to remain as leader of the group, stating he had been deceived by Fr\u00e9mont.  William Ide gave an impassioned speech urging the rebels to stay in Sonoma and start a new republic.<ref>Walker pp. 125\u20136</ref>  Referring to the stolen horses Ide ended his oration with \"Choose ye this day what you will be!  We are robbers, or we ''must'' be conquerors!\"<ref>Harlow p. 102</ref>\n\nAt that time, Vallejo and his three associates were placed on horseback and taken to Fr\u00e9mont accompanied by eight or nine of the insurgents who did not favor forming a new republic under the circumstances.<ref>Bancroft V:117</ref> That night they camped at the Vaca Rancho.  Some young Californio ''vigilantes'' under Juan Padilla evaded the guards, aroused Vallejo and offered to help him escape.  Vallejo declined, wanting to avoid any bloodshed and anticipating that Fr\u00e9mont would release him on parole.<ref>Harlow p.101</ref>\n\nThe [[Sonoma Barracks]] became the headquarters for the remaining twenty-four rebels, who within a few days created their Bear Flag (see the \"Bear Flag\" section below). After the flag was raised [[Californio]]s called the insurgents ''Los Osos'' (The Bears) and \"Bear Flaggers\" because of their flag and in derision of their often scruffy appearance.  The rebels embraced the expression, and their uprising, which they originally called the ''Popular Movement'', became known as the ''Bear Flag Revolt''.<ref>SSHP p. 82</ref>  Henry L. Ford was elected First Lieutenant of the company and obtained promises of obedience to orders.<ref name=\"Harlow p. 103\"/>  Samuel Kelsey was elected Second Lieutenant, Grandville P. Swift and Samuel Gibson Sergeants.<ref>Bancroft V:158</ref>\n\n===Ide's proclamation ===\n\nWilliam B. Ide wrote a proclamation announcing and explaining the reasons for the revolt during the night of June 14\u201315, 1846 (below).  There were additional copies and some more moderate versions (produced in both English and Spanish) distributed around northern California through June 18.<ref>Rogers, ''Ide'' p. 82, Appendix A</ref>\n{{Quotation\n|To all persons, citizens of Sonoma, requesting them to remain at peace, and to follow their rightful occupations without fear of molestation.\n\nThe Commander in Chief of the Troops assembled at the Fortress of Sonoma gives his inviolable pledge to all persons in California not found under arms that they shall not be disturbed in their persons, their property or social relations one to another by men under his command.\n\nHe also solemnly declares his object to be First, to defend himself and companions in arms who were invited to this country by a promise of Lands on which to settle themselves and families who were also promised a \"republican government,\" who, when having arrived in California were denied even the privilege of buying or renting Lands of their friends, who instead of being allowed to participate in or being protected by a \"Republican Government\" were oppressed by a \"Military Despotism,\" who were even threatened, by \"Proclamation\" from the Chief Officer of the aforesaid Despotism, with extermination if they would not depart out of the Country, leaving all of their property, their arms and beasts of burden, and thus deprived of the means of flight or defense. We were to be driven through deserts, inhabited by hostile Indians to certain destruction. To overthrow a Government which has seized upon the property of the Missions for its individual aggrandizement; which has ruined and shamefully oppressed the laboring people of California, by their enormous exactions on goods imported into this country; is the determined purpose of the brave men who are associated under his command.\n\nHe also solemnly declares his object in the Second place to be to invite all peaceable and good Citizens of California who are friendly to the maintenance of good order and equal rights (and I do hereby invite them to repair to my camp at Sonoma without delay) to assist us in establishing and perpetuating a \"Republican Government\" which shall secure to all: civil and religious liberty; which shall detect and punish crime; which shall encourage industry, virtue and literature; which shall leave unshackled by Fetters, Commerce, Agriculture, and Mechanism.\n\nHe further declares that he relies upon the rectitude of our intentions; the favor of Heaven and the bravery of those who are bound to and associated with him, by the principle of self preservation; by the love of truth; and by the hatred of tyranny for his hopes of success.\n\nHe further declares that he believes that a Government to be prosperous and happyfying [sic] in its tendency must originate with its people who are friendly to its existence. That its Citizens are its Guardians, its officers are its Servants, and its Glory their reward.  |William B. Ide|Head Quarters Sonoma|June 15, 1846\n}}\n\n===Need for gunpowder===\nA major problem for the Bears in Sonoma was the lack of sufficient [[gunpowder]] to defend against the expected Mexican attack.  William Todd was dispatched on Monday the fifteenth, with a letter<ref group=notes>{{cite web |url=http://www.bearflagmuseum.org/June%2015_1846%20William%20B%20Ide%20Letter%20to%20Stockton%20Montgomery.html |title=Ide's Letter |date= June 15, 1846}}</ref> to be delivered to the [[USS Portsmouth (1843)|USS ''Portsmouth'']] telling of the events in Sonoma and describing themselves as \"fellow country men\". Todd, having been instructed not to repeat any of the requests in the letter (refers to their need for gunpowder), disregarded that and voiced the request for gunpowder.  Captain Montgomery, while sympathetic, declined because of his country's neutrality.<ref>Bancroft V:156</ref>  Todd, Jos\u00e9 de Rosa (the messenger Vallejo sent to Montgomery), and U.S. Navy Lieutenant John S. Misroon returned to Sonoma in the Portsmouth's launch the morning of the 16th.  Misroon's mission was, without interfering with the revolt, to prevent violence to noncombatants.<ref>Harlow p. 104</ref>\n\nTodd was given a second assignment.  He was sent to Bodega Bay with an unnamed companion (sometimes called 'the Englishman') to obtain powder from American settlers in that area.<ref name=\"Walker p. 132\">Walker p. 132</ref>  On June 18, Bears Thomas Cowie and George Fowler were sent to ''Rancho Sotoyome'' (near current-day [[Healdsburg, California]]) to pick up a cache of gunpowder from Moses Carson, brother of Fr\u00e9mont's scout [[Kit Carson]].<ref>Bancroft pp. 155\u201359</ref>\n\n===Sutter's Fort===\n[[File:Sutter's Fort colored engraving 1849.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Sutter's Fort]] was one of two rebel strongholds, having been seized from John Sutter by John Fr\u00e9mont (c.  1849).]]\n\nFr\u00e9mont's \"field-lieutenant\" Merritt returned to Sacramento (known as New Helvetia at the time, so named by the Swiss John Sutter) on June 16 with his prisoners and recounted the events in Sonoma. Fr\u00e9mont either was fearful of going against the popular sentiment at Sonoma or saw the advantages of holding the ''Californio'' officers as hostages.  He also decided to imprison Governor Vallejo's brother-in-law, the American Jacob Leese, in [[Sutter's Fort]].<ref>Bancroft V:120\u201321</ref>  Fr\u00e9mont recounts in his memoirs, \"Affairs had now assumed a critical aspect and I presently saw that the time had come when it was unsafe to leave events to mature under unfriendly, or mistaken, direction \u2026 I knew the facts of the situation.

He issued two proclamations on June 17.  The first asked the citizens of California to come to the aid of their country.  The second promised protection for all foreigners not involved in the revolt.  A group of 50\u201360 militia under command of Captain [[Rancho Arroyo Seco (Torre)|Joaquin de la Torre]] traveled up to [[San Pablo, California|San Pablo]] and, by boat, westward across the [[San Francisco Bay]] to [[San Quentin, California|Point San Quentin]] on the 23rd.  Two additional divisions with a total of about 100 men arrived at San Pablo on June 27.<ref name=\"Bancroft V:132-136\">Bancroft V:132\u2013136</ref>\n\n===Battle of Ol\u00fampali===\nOn June 20 when the procurement parties failed to return as expected, Lieutenant Ford sent Sergeant Gibson with four men to ''Rancho Sotoyome''.  Gibson obtained the powder and on the way back fought with several Californians and captured one of them.  From the prisoner they learned that Cowie and Fowler had died.  There are [[Californio]] and ''Oso'' versions of what had happened.  Ford also learned that William Todd and his companion had been captured by the [[Californio]] irregulars led by Juan Padilla and Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Carrillo.<ref name=\"Walker p. 132\"/>\n\nFord writes, in his biography, that before leaving Sonoma to search for the other two captives and Padilla's men, he sent a note to Ezekiel Merritt in Sacramento asking him to gather volunteers to help defend Sonoma.  Ide's version is that Ford wrote to Fr\u00e9mont saying that the Bears had lost confidence in Ide's leadership.  In either case, Ford then rode toward Santa Rosa with seventeen to nineteen Bears.  Not finding Padilla, the Bears headed toward one of his homes near [[Two Rock, California|Two Rock]].  The following morning the Bears captured three or four men near the [[Rancho Laguna de San Antonio]] and unexpectedly discovered what they assumed was Juan Padilla's group near the Indian rancho of [[Olumpali, California|Ol\u00fampali]].<ref name=\"Harlow p. 108-9\">Harlow pp. 108\u20139</ref>  Ford approached the adobe but more men appeared and others came \"pouring out of the adobe\".  Militiamen from south of the Bay, led by Mexican Captain Joaquin de la Torre, had joined with Padilla's irregulars and now numbered about seventy.  Ford's men positioned themselves in a grove of trees and opened fire when the enemy charged on horseback, killing one Californio and wounding another. During the ensuing [[Battle of Olompali|long-range battle]], William Todd and his companion escaped from the house where they were being held and ran to the Bears. The Californios disengaged from the long-range fighting after suffering a few wounded and returned to San Rafael.<ref>Rogers: Ide p.51</ref> A Californian militiaman reported that their muskets could not shoot as far as the rifles used by some Bears.<ref>Bancroft v:166 note 15</ref> This was the only battle fought during the Bear Flag Revolt.<ref>Walker pp. 132\u201335</ref>\n\nThe deaths of Cowie and Fowler, as well as the lethal battle, raised the anxiety of both the Californios, who left the area for safety, and the immigrants, who moved into Sonoma to be under the protection of the muskets and cannon that had been taken from the [[Sonoma Barracks]]. This increased the number in Sonoma to about two hundred.<ref name=\"Bancroft V:109\"/> Some immigrant families were housed in the Barracks, others in the homes of the Californios.<ref name=\"Harlow p. 108-9\"/><ref>Warner pp. 479\u2013482 Appendix VII</ref>\n\n===Fr\u00e9mont arrives to defend Sonoma===\n[[File:Historic American Buildings Survey George Gibbs Drawing of 1851 Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collection VIEW FROM WEST - Sonoma Plaza, Bear Flag Flagstaff, Sonoma, Sonoma County, CA HABS CAL,49-SONO,7-1.tif|300px|thumb|left|[[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] was a tiny Hispanic settlement in 1846, drawn here as it was in 1851.]]\n\nHaving learned of Ford's request for volunteers to defend Sonoma and hearing reports that General Castro was preparing an attack, Fr\u00e9mont left his camp near Sutter's Fort for Sonoma on June 23.  With him were ninety men \u2013 his own party plus trappers and settlers under Samuel J. Hensley.  Fr\u00e9mont would say in his memoirs that he wrote a letter of resignation from the Army and sent it to his father-in-law [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas Hart Benton]] in case the government should wish to disavow his action.  They arrived at Sonoma in the early morning of the 25th and by noon were on their way to [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]] accompanied by a contingent of Bears under Ford's command.  They arrived at the former San Rafael mission but the Californios had vanished.  The rebels set up camp in the old mission and sent out scouting parties.<ref>Harlow p, 108\u2013110</ref><ref>Walker pp. 134\u20135</ref>\n\nOn Sunday the 28th a small boat was spotted coming across the bay.  Kit Carson and some companions went to intercept it.  It held twin brothers Francisco and Ram\u00f3n de Haro, their uncle Jos\u00e9 de la Reyes Berreyesa, and an oarsman (probably one of the Castro brothers from San Pablo) \u2013 all unarmed.  The Haro brothers and Berreyesa were dropped off at the shoreline and started on foot for the mission.  All three were shot and killed.  Beyond that almost every fact is disputed.  Some say Fr\u00e9mont ordered the killings.  Others, that they were carrying secret messages from Castro to Torre.  Others that Carson committed the homicides as revenge for the deaths of Cowie and Fowler or they were shot by Fr\u00e9mont's Delaware Indians.  This incident became an issue in Fr\u00e9mont's later campaign for President.  Partisan eyewitnesses and newspapers related totally conflicting stories.<ref>Bancroft V:171\u20134</ref><ref>Harlow p.110</ref>\n\n===Captain de la Torre's ruse===\nLate the same afternoon as the killings a scouting party intercepted a letter indicating that Torre intended to attack Sonoma the following morning.  Fr\u00e9mont felt there was no choice but to return to defend Sonoma as quickly as possible.  The garrison there had found a similar letter and had all weapons loaded and at the ready before dawn the next day when Fr\u00e9mont and Ford's forces approached Sonoma \u2013 almost provoking firing by the garrison.  Fr\u00e9mont, understanding that he had been tricked, left again for San Rafael after a hasty breakfast.  He arrived back at the old mission within twenty-four hours of leaving but during that period Torre and his men had time to escape to San Pablo via boat.  Torre had successfully used the ruse not only to escape  but almost succeeded in provoking a 'friendly fire' incident among the insurgents.<ref>Bancroft V;174\u20136</ref>\n\nAfter reaching San Pablo, Torre reported that the combined rebel force was too strong to be attacked as planned.  All three of Castro's divisions then returned to the old headquarters near [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] where a council of war was held on June 30.  It was decided that the current plan must be abandoned and any new approach would require the cooperation of Pio Pico and his southern forces.  A messenger was sent to the Governor.  Meanwhile, the army moved southwards to [[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan]] where General Castro was, on July 6, when he learned of the events in Monterey.<ref>Bancroft V:136</ref>\n\n===Actions in and around Yerba Buena===\nOn July 1, Fr\u00e9mont and twelve men convinced Captain William Phelps to ferry them in the ''Moscow'''s launch to the [[Fort Point, San Francisco|old Spanish fort]] at the entrance to the [[Golden Gate]].  They landed without resistance and spiked the ten old, abandoned cannon.  The next day [[Robert B. Semple]] led ten Bears in the launch to the pueblo of [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (the future San Francisco) to arrest the naturalized Englishman Robert Ridley who was captain of the port.  Ridley was sent to Sutter's Fort to be locked up with other prisoners.<ref>Harlow p. 111</ref>\n\n===Independence Day, 1846, in Sonoma===\n\nA great celebration was held on the [[Fourth of July]] beginning with readings of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in Sonoma's plaza.  There were also cannon salutes, the roasting of whole beeves, and the consumption of many foods and all manner of beverages.  Fr\u00e9mont and the contingent from San Rafael arrived in time for the [[fandango]] held in Salvador Vallejo's big adobe on the corner of the town square.<ref>Walker p. 138\u20139</ref>\n\n===Formation of the California Battalion===\n\nOn July 5, Fr\u00e9mont called a public meeting and proposed to the Bears that they unite with his party and form a single military unit.  He said that he would accept command if they would pledge obedience, proceed honorably, and not violate the chastity of women. A compact was drawn up which all volunteers of the [[California Battalion]] signed or made their marks.<ref>Bancroft V:178\u201380</ref> A majority of those present also agreed to officially date the era of independence not from the taking of Sonoma but from July 5 to allow Fr\u00e9mont to \"begin at the beginning\".<ref>Harlow p. 112</ref>\n\nThe next day Fr\u00e9mont, leaving the fifty men of Company B at the Barracks to defend Sonoma, left with the rest of the Battalion for Sutter's Fort. They took with them two of the captured Mexican field pieces, as well as muskets, a supply of ammunition, blankets, horses, and cattle.<ref>Bancroft V:184\u20135</ref>  The seven-ton ''Mermaid'' was used for transporting the cannon, arms, ammunition and saddles from Napa to Sutter's Fort.<ref>Rogers: Ide p. 56</ref>\n\n===U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps capture Monterey===\nWar against Mexico had already been declared by the United States Congress on May 13, 1846.  Because of the slow cross-continent communication of the time, no one in California knew that conclusively.  (Official notice of the war finally reached California on August 12, 1846.)<ref>Harlow p. 121</ref>  [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[John D. Sloat]], commanding the U.S. Navy's [[Pacific Squadron]], had been waiting in [[Monterey Bay]] since July 1 or 2 to obtain convincing proof of war.  Sloat was 65 years old and had requested to be relieved from his command the previous May.  He was also acutely aware of the 1842 [[Capture of Monterey]], when his predecessor, [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Thomas ap Catesby Jones]], thought war had been declared and captured the capital of Alta California, only to discover his error and abandon it the next day.  This resulted in diplomatic problems, and Jones was removed as commander of the Pacific Squadron.\n\nSloat had learned of Fr\u00e9mont's confrontation with the Californios on [[Fremont Peak (California)|Gavilan Peak]] and of his support for the Bears in Sonoma.  He was also aware of Lt. Gillespie's  tracking down of Fr\u00e9mont with letters and orders.  Sloat finally concluded on July 6 that he needed to act, saying to U.S. Consul [[Thomas O. Larkin|Larkin]], \"I shall be blamed for doing too little or too much \u2013 I prefer the latter.\"<ref>Harlow p. 122</ref>  Early July 7, the [[frigate]] [[USS Savannah (1842)|USS ''Savannah'']] and the two [[Sloop-of-war|sloops]], [[USS Cyane (1837)|USS ''Cyane'']] and [[USS Levant (1837)|USS ''Levant'']] of the [[United States Navy]], captured [[Monterey, California]], and raised the flag of the United States.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/biographies/john_sloat.html \"Commodore John Sloat\"].

The following November, John and his older brother disappeared while traveling to Sacramento and were presumed deceased. Commander Montgomery kept the Bear Flag, had a copy made, and eventually both were delivered to the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]]. In 1855 the Secretary sent both flags to the Senators from California who donated them to the Society of Pioneers in San Francisco.  The original Bear Flag was destroyed in the fires following the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bear Flag Museum|title=History of the Bear Flag|url=http://www.bearflagmuseum.org/|accessdate=May 18, 2014}}</ref> A replica, created in 1896 for the 50th Anniversary celebrations, is on display at the [[Sonoma Barracks]].\n\n==Bear Flag==\n{{main|Bear Flag}}\n[[File:Original_Storm_bear_flag.jpeg|left|thumb|175px|The First [[Bear Flag]], by Peter Storm photographed ca 1870]]\n[[File:Original_Todd_bear_flag.jpg|left|thumb|175px|The original of Todd's [[Bear Flag]], photographed in 1890]]\n[[File:Flag of California.svg|right|thumb|175px|Modern flag of the State of California, for comparison]]\n\nThe most notable legacy of the \"California Republic\" was the adoption of its flag as the basis of the modern state [[Flag of California]].

Todd painted the flag on domestic cotton cloth, roughly a yard and a half in length.
