The other faction that split following that convention was the [[Socialist Party USA]] (SPUSA), which remains an independent democratic socialist political party. The DSOC, in Harrington's words \"the remnant of a remnant\", soon became the largest democratic socialist group in the United States. In 1982, it merged with the [[New American Movement]] (NAM), a coalition of intellectuals with roots in the [[New Left]] movements of the 1960s and former members of socialist and communist parties of the [[Old Left]], to form the DSA.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">\n* {{cite news|title=Socialist Party now the Social Democrats, U.S.A.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 31, 1972|page=36|author=Anonymous|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/31/archives/socialist-party-now-the-social-democrats-usa.html|accessdate=February 8, 2010|ref=harv}}\n''The New York Times'' reported on the Convention for three other days:\n* {{cite news|title=Young Socialists open parley; to weigh 'New Politics' split|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 27, 1972|ref=harv|page=25|author=Anonymous|url=http://www.marxisthistory.org/personal/721227-sdusa-news.pdf}}\n* {{cite news|title=Young Socialists defeat motion favoring recognition of Cuba|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 28, 1972|page=15|last=Johnston|first=Laurie|ref=harv|url=http://www.marxisthistory.org/personal/721228-sdusa-news.pdf}}\n* {{cite news|title='Firmness' urged on <!-- CAPITALIZED! -->Communists: Social Democrats reach end of U.S. Convention here|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 1, 1973|page=11|author=Anonymous|url=http://www.marxisthistory.org/personal/730101-sdusa-news.pdf|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the organization consisted of approximately 5,000 ex-DSOC members and 1,000 ex-NAM members.

Questions and Answers from the Democratic Socialists of America\", states that \"no country has fully instituted democratic socialism\".

Opposed to [[capitalism]] and then-[[Real socialism|existing versions of socialism]] alike as cruel and anti-libertarian social systems, Harrington advocated working for a [[Realigning election|realignment]] of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], transforming it from what he saw as an amorphous amalgam of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], [[centrist]] and [[left-liberal]] politicians into something like a Western European social democratic party, within which the DSA would be the anti-capitalist left wing. The DSA Constitution outlines the basic notion behind its ideology as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/constitution/|title=DSA Constitution & Bylaws|publisher=}}</ref> {{quote|text=We are socialists because we reject an economic order based on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression, disability status, age, religion, and national origin, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo. We are socialists because we share a vision of a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning, equitable distribution, feminism, racial equality and non-oppressive relationships. We are socialists because we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving that vision, for building a majority movement that will make democratic socialism a reality in America. We believe that such a strategy must acknowledge the class structure of American society and that this class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population.}}\n\nDSA members have views ranging from [[eco-socialism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/climate_and_environmental_justice_working_group|title=Climate and Environmental Justice Working Group|publisher=}}</ref> [[democratic socialism]],<ref name=\"What is Democratic Socialism?\">{{cite web|url=https://jacobinmag.com/2018/07/democratic-socialism-bernie-sanders-social-democracy-alexandria-ocasio-cortez|title=What is Democratic Socialism?|last=Meyer|first=Neal|date=July 20, 2018|website=Jacobin|accessdate=July 21, 2018}}</ref> [[libertarian socialism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dsa-lsc.org/|title=DSA Libertarian Socialist Caucus|website=DSA Libertarian Socialist Caucus}}</ref> and [[communism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@DSACommunistCaucus/dsa-communist-caucus-our-statement-bccd8fb2bcbd|title=DSA Communist Caucus: Our Statement|first=DSA Communist|last=Caucus|date=September 6, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe DSA regards the abolition of capitalism and the realization of socialism as a gradual long-term goal, therefore the organization focuses its immediate political energies on reforms within capitalism that empower working people while decreasing the power of corporations:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsausa.org/about-us|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=About DSA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Haltiwanger |first1=John |title=Here's the difference between a 'socialist' and a 'Democratic socialist' |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/difference-between-socialist-and-democratic-socialist-2018-6 |website=Business Insider |accessdate=12 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Stein |first1=Jeff|title=9 questions about the Democratic Socialists of America you were too embarrassed to ask |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/5/15930786/dsa-socialists-convention-national |website=Vox |accessdate=12 July 2019 |date=5 August 2017|quote=DSA believes in the abolition of capitalism in favor of an economy run either by \u201cthe workers\u201d or the state}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=The Week staff |first1=|title=Rise of the democratic socialists |url=https://theweek.com/articles/786937/rise-democratic-socialists |website=The Week |accessdate=12 July 2019 |date=30 July 2018|quote=DSA's national platform calls for abolishing capitalism}}</ref> <blockquote>As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.</blockquote>\n\n=== Socialism ===\nOn its website page \"What is Democratic Socialism? Q & A\", the DSA characterizes its vision of socialism as an economic system based on maximum decentralization that can be supportive of a range of models for [[social ownership]], including [[Public enterprise|publicly owned enterprises]] and [[Cooperative|worker-owned cooperatives]]. The DSA rejects centralized economic planning in favor of a combination of democratic planning and market mechanisms:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/what-is-democratic-socialism/#govt|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=Doesn't socialism mean that the government will own and run everything?}}</ref> <blockquote>Social ownership could take many forms, such as worker-owned cooperatives or publicly owned enterprises managed by workers and consumer representatives. Democratic socialists favor as much decentralization as possible. While the large concentrations of capital in industries such as energy and steel may necessitate some form of state ownership, many consumer-goods industries might be best run as cooperatives.\n\nDemocratic socialists have long rejected the belief that the whole economy should be centrally planned. While we believe that democratic planning can shape major social investments like mass transit, housing, and energy, market mechanisms are needed to determine the demand for many consumer goods.</blockquote>\n\nBecause the DSA does not believe capitalism and private corporations can be immediately replaced with socialism, it is favorable to using government regulations and organized labor to make private businesses more accountable to the public interest:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/what-is-democratic-socialism/#corporations|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=Private corporations seem to be a permanent fixture in the US, so why work towards socialism?}}</ref> <blockquote>In the short term we can't eliminate private corporations, but we can bring them under greater democratic control. The government could use regulations and tax incentives to encourage companies to act in the public interest and outlaw destructive activities such as exporting jobs to low-wage countries and polluting our environment. Public pressure can also have a critical role to play in the struggle to hold corporations accountable. Most of all, socialists look to unions to make private business more accountable.</blockquote>\n\n=== Internationalism ===\nAt the 2017 DSA Convention, the group announced its withdrawal from the [[Socialist International]] (SI). The resolution passed states that the DSA will \"[build] direct relationships with socialist and left parties and social movements around the world that we can learn from and which share our values.

A statement issued in April 2017 called the intervention by the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] both a violation of domestic and international law.

This includes pushes for equal rights and protections for all those who identify as LGBTQIA+ as well as rights to housing, jobs, education, public accommodations and healthcare. The DSA recognizes that those who are most discriminated against based on identity are disproportionately women and people of color. The organization also seeks to ensure public schools are safe places for LGBTQIA+ students and that students should have total access to facilities that reflect their gender.

The organization holds that capitalism is built on [[white supremacy]] as well as [[patriarchy|male supremacy]]. The DSA maintains that reproductive rights are central to the [[feminist movement]]. Connecting democratic socialism and socialist feminism, the DSA says \"that birth control and safe abortion should be provided as part of a comprehensive single-payer healthcare program\". Believing that electoral politics can only take socialist feminism so far, the organization also says that the emphasis must be on community-based grassroots movements.

This publication continues in an uninterrupted run from the original ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left'' published by the DSOC (the DSA forerunner) since its establishment in 1973. In 2008, DSA members active in the American labor movement founded Talking Union, a blog that focuses on labor politics, working-class struggles and strategies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingunion.wordpress.com|title=Talking Union: A Project of the DSA Labor Network|publisher=Talkingunion.wordpress.com|date=|accessdate=November 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nLeft-wing quarterly magazine ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' is also considered to be very close to the party, as its editor [[Bhaskar Sunkara]] is a DSA member; however, there is no official affiliations between the magazine and DSA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/1195/walking-the-tightrope/|title=Walking the tightrope - Weekly Worker|website=weeklyworker.co.uk|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Student section ===\n[[File:YDS logo.svg|thumb|upright|[[Young Democratic Socialists of America]] logo]]\nThe [[Young Democratic Socialists of America]] (YDSA) is the official student section of the DSA.

In the 1980s, Harrington said:<ref name=\"obit\"/> <blockquote>Put it this way. Marx was a democrat with a small \"d\". The Democratic Socialists envision a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning [...] and racial equality. I share an immediate program with liberals in this country because the best liberalism leads toward socialism. [...] I want to be on the left wing of the possible.</blockquote>\n\nHarrington made it clear that even if the traditional [[Marxism|Marxist]] vision of a marketless, stateless society was not possible, he did not understand why this needed to \"result in the social consequence of some people eating while others starve\".<ref>Bella Stumbo.

Questions and Answers from the Democratic Socialists of America\", states that \"no country has fully instituted democratic socialism\". Nonetheless, according to the DSA there are lessons to be learned from \"the [[Nordic model|comprehensive welfare state]] maintained by the Swedes, from Canada's [[Medicare (Canada)|national healthcare system]], France's [[Child care#France|nationwide childcare program]], and Nicaragua's [[Nicaraguan Literacy Campaign|literacy programs]]\".<ref name=\"whatis\">{{cite news|url=http://www.dsausa.org/pdf/widemsoc.pdf|title=What is Democratic Socialism?

Opposed to [[capitalism]] and then-[[Real socialism|existing versions of socialism]] alike as cruel and anti-libertarian social systems, Harrington advocated working for a [[Realigning election|realignment]] of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], transforming it from what he saw as an amorphous amalgam of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], [[centrist]] and [[left-liberal]] politicians into something like a Western European social democratic party, within which the DSA would be the anti-capitalist left wing. The DSA Constitution outlines the basic notion behind its ideology as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/constitution/|title=DSA Constitution & Bylaws|publisher=}}</ref> {{quote|text=We are socialists because we reject an economic order based on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression, disability status, age, religion, and national origin, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo. We are socialists because we share a vision of a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning, equitable distribution, feminism, racial equality and non-oppressive relationships. We are socialists because we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving that vision, for building a majority movement that will make democratic socialism a reality in America. We believe that such a strategy must acknowledge the class structure of American society and that this class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population.}}\n\nDSA members have views ranging from [[eco-socialism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/climate_and_environmental_justice_working_group|title=Climate and Environmental Justice Working Group|publisher=}}</ref> [[democratic socialism]],<ref name=\"What is Democratic Socialism?\">{{cite web|url=https://jacobinmag.com/2018/07/democratic-socialism-bernie-sanders-social-democracy-alexandria-ocasio-cortez|title=What is Democratic Socialism?|last=Meyer|first=Neal|date=July 20, 2018|website=Jacobin|accessdate=July 21, 2018}}</ref> [[libertarian socialism]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dsa-lsc.org/|title=DSA Libertarian Socialist Caucus|website=DSA Libertarian Socialist Caucus}}</ref> and [[communism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@DSACommunistCaucus/dsa-communist-caucus-our-statement-bccd8fb2bcbd|title=DSA Communist Caucus: Our Statement|first=DSA Communist|last=Caucus|date=September 6, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe DSA regards the abolition of capitalism and the realization of socialism as a gradual long-term goal, therefore the organization focuses its immediate political energies on reforms within capitalism that empower working people while decreasing the power of corporations:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsausa.org/about-us|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=About DSA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Haltiwanger |first1=John |title=Here's the difference between a 'socialist' and a 'Democratic socialist' |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/difference-between-socialist-and-democratic-socialist-2018-6 |website=Business Insider |accessdate=12 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Stein |first1=Jeff|title=9 questions about the Democratic Socialists of America you were too embarrassed to ask |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/5/15930786/dsa-socialists-convention-national |website=Vox |accessdate=12 July 2019 |date=5 August 2017|quote=DSA believes in the abolition of capitalism in favor of an economy run either by \u201cthe workers\u201d or the state}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=The Week staff |first1=|title=Rise of the democratic socialists |url=https://theweek.com/articles/786937/rise-democratic-socialists |website=The Week |accessdate=12 July 2019 |date=30 July 2018|quote=DSA's national platform calls for abolishing capitalism}}</ref> <blockquote>As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.</blockquote>\n\n=== Socialism ===\nOn its website page \"What is Democratic Socialism? Q & A\", the DSA characterizes its vision of socialism as an economic system based on maximum decentralization that can be supportive of a range of models for [[social ownership]], including [[Public enterprise|publicly owned enterprises]] and [[Cooperative|worker-owned cooperatives]]. The DSA rejects centralized economic planning in favor of a combination of democratic planning and market mechanisms:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/what-is-democratic-socialism/#govt|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=Doesn't socialism mean that the government will own and run everything?}}</ref> <blockquote>Social ownership could take many forms, such as worker-owned cooperatives or publicly owned enterprises managed by workers and consumer representatives. Democratic socialists favor as much decentralization as possible. While the large concentrations of capital in industries such as energy and steel may necessitate some form of state ownership, many consumer-goods industries might be best run as cooperatives.\n\nDemocratic socialists have long rejected the belief that the whole economy should be centrally planned. While we believe that democratic planning can shape major social investments like mass transit, housing, and energy, market mechanisms are needed to determine the demand for many consumer goods.</blockquote>\n\nBecause the DSA does not believe capitalism and private corporations can be immediately replaced with socialism, it is favorable to using government regulations and organized labor to make private businesses more accountable to the public interest:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/what-is-democratic-socialism/#corporations|website=Democratic Socialists of America|accessdate=29 June 2018|title=Private corporations seem to be a permanent fixture in the US, so why work towards socialism?}}</ref> <blockquote>In the short term we can't eliminate private corporations, but we can bring them under greater democratic control. The government could use regulations and tax incentives to encourage companies to act in the public interest and outlaw destructive activities such as exporting jobs to low-wage countries and polluting our environment. Public pressure can also have a critical role to play in the struggle to hold corporations accountable. Most of all, socialists look to unions to make private business more accountable.</blockquote>\n\n=== Internationalism ===\nAt the 2017 DSA Convention, the group announced its withdrawal from the [[Socialist International]] (SI). The resolution passed states that the DSA will \"[build] direct relationships with socialist and left parties and social movements around the world that we can learn from and which share our values.

The organization also seeks to ensure public schools are safe places for LGBTQIA+ students and that students should have total access to facilities that reflect their gender.

The organization holds that capitalism is built on [[white supremacy]] as well as [[patriarchy|male supremacy]]. The DSA maintains that reproductive rights are central to the [[feminist movement]]. Connecting democratic socialism and socialist feminism, the DSA says \"that birth control and safe abortion should be provided as part of a comprehensive single-payer healthcare program\". Believing that electoral politics can only take socialist feminism so far, the organization also says that the emphasis must be on community-based grassroots movements.

His films include ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]'' (1976), a sexually explicit film set in 1930s Japan, and ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence]]'' (1983), about [[World War II]] prisoners of war held by the Japanese.\n\n==Early life==\n\nAfter graduating from [[Kyoto University]] in 1954, where he studied political history,<ref name=\"bergen-guardian\"/> Oshima was hired by film production company [[Shochiku|Shochiku Ltd.]] and quickly progressed to directing his own movies, making his debut feature ''A Town of Love and Hope'' in 1959.\n\n==1960s==\nOshima's cinematic career and influence developed very swiftly,<ref>{{harvnb|Bock|1978|p=311}}</ref> and such films as ''[[Cruel Story of Youth]]'' and ''[[Night and Fog in Japan]]'' followed in 1960. The last of these 1960 films explored Oshima's disillusionment with the traditional political left, and his frustrations with the right, and Shochiku withdrew the film from circulation after less than a week, claiming that, following the recent assassination of the Socialist Party leader [[Inejiro Asanuma]] by the ultranationalist [[Otoya Yamaguchi]], there was a risk of \"unrest\". Oshima left the studio in response, and launched his own independent production company. Despite the controversy, ''Night and Fog in Japan'' placed tenth in that year's ''[[Kinema Jumpo]]''{{'s}} best-films poll of Japanese critics, and it has subsequently amassed considerable acclaim abroad.<ref name=\"Bock, Audie pp 333\">{{harvnb|Bock|1978|p=333}}</ref>\n\nIn 1961 Oshima directed ''The Catch'', based on a [[novella]] by [[Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce]] about the relationship between a wartime Japanese village and a captured [[African American]] serviceman. ''The Catch'' has not traditionally been viewed as one of Oshima's major works, though it did notably introduce a thematic exploration of bigotry and xenophobia, themes which would be explored in greater depth in the later documentary ''Diary of Yunbogi'', and feature films ''[[Death by Hanging]]'' and ''Three Resurrected Drunkards''.<ref>{{harvnb|Turim|1998|p=168}}</ref> He embarked upon a period of work in television, producing a series of documentaries; notably among them 1965's ''Diary Of Yunbogi''. Based upon an examination of the lives of street children in Seoul, it was made by Oshima after a trip to South Korea.<ref name=\"Bock, Audie pp 333\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Oshima|1992|p=101}}</ref>\n\nOshima directed three features in 1968. The first of these - ''[[Death by Hanging]]'' (1968) presented the story of the failed execution of a young Korean for rape and murder, and was loosely based upon an actual crime and execution which had taken place in 1958.<ref>{{cite book|authorlink=Donald Richie|last=Richie|first=Donald|title=A Hundred Years Of Japanese Film|page=198|publisher=Kodansha International|year=2001|location=Tokyo}}</ref> The film utilizes non-realistic \"distancing\" techniques after the fashion of [[Bertold Brecht]] or [[Jean-Luc Godard]] to examine Japan's record of racial discrimination against its Korean minority, incorporating elements of farce and political satire, and a number of visual techniques associated with the cinematic new wave in a densely layered narrative. It was placed third in ''Kinema Jumpo''{{'s}} 1968 poll, and has also garnered significant attention globally.<ref>{{harvnb|Bock|1978|p=335}}</ref> ''Death By Hanging'' inaugurated a string of films (continuing through 1976's ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]'') that clarified a number of Oshima's key themes, most notably a need to question social constraints, and to similarly deconstruct received political doctrines.<ref>{{cite book|authorlink=Tadao Sato|last=Sato|first=Tadao|title=Currents In Japanese Cinema|page=177 |publisher=Kodansha International|year=1982|location=Tokyo}}</ref>\n\nMonths later, ''[[Diary of a Shinjuku Thief]]'' unites a number of Oshima's thematic concerns within a dense, collage-style presentation.  Featuring a title which alludes to [[Jean Genet]]'s ''[[The Thief's Journal]]'', the film explores the links between sexual and political radicalism,<ref>{{harvnb|Turim|1998|p=88}}</ref> specifically examining the day-to-day life of a would-be radical whose sexual desires take the form of [[kleptomania]]. The fragmented narrative is interrupted by commentators, including an underground [[noh]] performance troupe, a psychoanalyst, and an impromptu symposium featuring actors from previous Oshima films (along with Oshima himself), all dissecting varied aspects of shifting sexual politics, as embodied by various characters within the film.\n\n''[[Boy (1969 film)|Boy]]'' (1969), based on another real-life case, was the story of a family who use their child to make money by deliberately getting involved in road accidents and making the drivers pay compensation.\n\n==1970s==\n''[[The Ceremony (1971 film)|The Ceremony]]'' (1971) is a satirical look at Japanese attitudes, famously expressed in a scene where a marriage ceremony has to go ahead even though the bride is not present.\n\nIn 1976, Oshima made ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]'', a film based on a true story of fatal sexual obsession in 1930s Japan. Oshima, a critic of censorship and his contemporary [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s humanism, was determined that the film should feature unsimulated sex and thus the undeveloped film had to be transported to France to be processed. An uncensored version of the movie is still unavailable in Japan. Oshima testified in a Japanese court about whether the film was obscene. \"Nothing that is expressed is obscene,\" the director said. \"What is obscene is what is hidden.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Lim|first=Dennis|title=Nagisa Oshima, Iconoclastic Filmmaker, Dies at 80|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/movies/nagisa-oshima-iconoclastic-filmmaker-dies-at-80.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 15, 2013|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn his 1978 companion film to ''In the Realm of the Senses'', ''[[Empire of Passion]]'', Oshima took a more restrained approach to depicting the sexual passions of the two lovers driven to murder, and the film won the 1978 [[Cannes Film Festival]] award for best director.<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1982/year/1978.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Empire of Passion |accessdate=January 16, 2013|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/9803879/Nagisa-Oshima.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Nagisa Oshima | date=January 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==1980s and beyond==\nIn 1983 Oshima had a critical success with a film made partly in English, ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence]]'', set in a wartime Japanese prison camp, and featuring rock star [[David Bowie]] and musician [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]], alongside [[Takeshi Kitano]].

His films include ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]'' (1976), a sexually explicit film set in 1930s Japan, and ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence]]'' (1983), about [[World War II]] prisoners of war held by the Japanese.\n\n==Early life==\n\nAfter graduating from [[Kyoto University]] in 1954, where he studied political history,<ref name=\"bergen-guardian\"/> Oshima was hired by film production company [[Shochiku|Shochiku Ltd.]] and quickly progressed to directing his own movies, making his debut feature ''A Town of Love and Hope'' in 1959.\n\n==1960s==\nOshima's cinematic career and influence developed very swiftly,<ref>{{harvnb|Bock|1978|p=311}}</ref> and such films as ''[[Cruel Story of Youth]]'' and ''[[Night and Fog in Japan]]'' followed in 1960. The last of these 1960 films explored Oshima's disillusionment with the traditional political left, and his frustrations with the right, and Shochiku withdrew the film from circulation after less than a week, claiming that, following the recent assassination of the Socialist Party leader [[Inejiro Asanuma]] by the ultranationalist [[Otoya Yamaguchi]], there was a risk of \"unrest\". Oshima left the studio in response, and launched his own independent production company. Despite the controversy, ''Night and Fog in Japan'' placed tenth in that year's ''[[Kinema Jumpo]]''{{'s}} best-films poll of Japanese critics, and it has subsequently amassed considerable acclaim abroad.<ref name=\"Bock, Audie pp 333\">{{harvnb|Bock|1978|p=333}}</ref>\n\nIn 1961 Oshima directed ''The Catch'', based on a [[novella]] by [[Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce]] about the relationship between a wartime Japanese village and a captured [[African American]] serviceman. ''The Catch'' has not traditionally been viewed as one of Oshima's major works, though it did notably introduce a thematic exploration of bigotry and xenophobia, themes which would be explored in greater depth in the later documentary ''Diary of Yunbogi'', and feature films ''[[Death by Hanging]]'' and ''Three Resurrected Drunkards''.<ref>{{harvnb|Turim|1998|p=168}}</ref> He embarked upon a period of work in television, producing a series of documentaries; notably among them 1965's ''Diary Of Yunbogi''. Based upon an examination of the lives of street children in Seoul, it was made by Oshima after a trip to South Korea.<ref name=\"Bock, Audie pp 333\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Oshima|1992|p=101}}</ref>\n\nOshima directed three features in 1968. The first of these - ''[[Death by Hanging]]'' (1968) presented the story of the failed execution of a young Korean for rape and murder, and was loosely based upon an actual crime and execution which had taken place in 1958.<ref>{{cite book|authorlink=Donald Richie|last=Richie|first=Donald|title=A Hundred Years Of Japanese Film|page=198|publisher=Kodansha International|year=2001|location=Tokyo}}</ref> The film utilizes non-realistic \"distancing\" techniques after the fashion of [[Bertold Brecht]] or [[Jean-Luc Godard]] to examine Japan's record of racial discrimination against its Korean minority, incorporating elements of farce and political satire, and a number of visual techniques associated with the cinematic new wave in a densely layered narrative. It was placed third in ''Kinema Jumpo''{{'s}} 1968 poll, and has also garnered significant attention globally.<ref>{{harvnb|Bock|1978|p=335}}</ref> ''Death By Hanging'' inaugurated a string of films (continuing through 1976's ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]'') that clarified a number of Oshima's key themes, most notably a need to question social constraints, and to similarly deconstruct received political doctrines.<ref>{{cite book|authorlink=Tadao Sato|last=Sato|first=Tadao|title=Currents In Japanese Cinema|page=177 |publisher=Kodansha International|year=1982|location=Tokyo}}</ref>\n\nMonths later, ''[[Diary of a Shinjuku Thief]]'' unites a number of Oshima's thematic concerns within a dense, collage-style presentation.  Featuring a title which alludes to [[Jean Genet]]'s ''[[The Thief's Journal]]'', the film explores the links between sexual and political radicalism,<ref>{{harvnb|Turim|1998|p=88}}</ref> specifically examining the day-to-day life of a would-be radical whose sexual desires take the form of [[kleptomania]]. The fragmented narrative is interrupted by commentators, including an underground [[noh]] performance troupe, a psychoanalyst, and an impromptu symposium featuring actors from previous Oshima films (along with Oshima himself), all dissecting varied aspects of shifting sexual politics, as embodied by various characters within the film.\n\n''[[Boy (1969 film)|Boy]]'' (1969), based on another real-life case, was the story of a family who use their child to make money by deliberately getting involved in road accidents and making the drivers pay compensation.\n\n==1970s==\n''[[The Ceremony (1971 film)|The Ceremony]]'' (1971) is a satirical look at Japanese attitudes, famously expressed in a scene where a marriage ceremony has to go ahead even though the bride is not present.\n\nIn 1976, Oshima made ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]'', a film based on a true story of fatal sexual obsession in 1930s Japan. Oshima, a critic of censorship and his contemporary [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s humanism, was determined that the film should feature unsimulated sex and thus the undeveloped film had to be transported to France to be processed. An uncensored version of the movie is still unavailable in Japan. Oshima testified in a Japanese court about whether the film was obscene. \"Nothing that is expressed is obscene,\" the director said. \"What is obscene is what is hidden.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Lim|first=Dennis|title=Nagisa Oshima, Iconoclastic Filmmaker, Dies at 80|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/movies/nagisa-oshima-iconoclastic-filmmaker-dies-at-80.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 15, 2013|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn his 1978 companion film to ''In the Realm of the Senses'', ''[[Empire of Passion]]'', Oshima took a more restrained approach to depicting the sexual passions of the two lovers driven to murder, and the film won the 1978 [[Cannes Film Festival]] award for best director.<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1982/year/1978.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Empire of Passion |accessdate=January 16, 2013|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/9803879/Nagisa-Oshima.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Nagisa Oshima | date=January 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==1980s and beyond==\nIn 1983 Oshima had a critical success with a film made partly in English, ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence]]'', set in a wartime Japanese prison camp, and featuring rock star [[David Bowie]] and musician [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]], alongside [[Takeshi Kitano]].

He is widely regarded as a prominent figure and catalyst of the [[New German Cinema]] movement.\n\nHis first feature-length film was a gangster movie called ''[[Love Is Colder Than Death (film)|Love Is Colder Than Death]]'' (1969); he scored his first domestic commercial success with ''[[The Merchant of Four Seasons]]'' (1972) and his first international success with ''[[Ali: Fear Eats the Soul]]'' (1974), both of which are considered masterpieces by contemporary critics. Big-budget projects such as ''[[Despair (film)|Despair]]'' (1978), ''[[Lili Marleen (film)|Lili Marleen]]'' and ''[[Lola (1981 film)|Lola]]'' (both 1981) followed.\n\nHis greatest success came with ''[[The Marriage of Maria Braun]]'' (1979), chronicling the rise and fall of a German woman in the wake of [[World War II]]. Other notable films include ''[[The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant]]'' (1972), ''[[Fox and His Friends]]'' (1975), ''[[Satan's Brew]]'' (1976), and ''[[Querelle]]'' (1982), all of which focused on [[LGBT|gay and lesbian]] themes.\n\nFassbinder died on 10 June 1982, at the age of 37, from a lethal cocktail of [[cocaine]] and [[barbiturate]]s. Although his career lasted less than two decades, he was extremely prolific; by the time of his death, he had completed over forty feature films, two television series, three short films, four video productions, and twenty-four plays.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early life==\nFassbinder was born in the small town of [[Bad W\u00f6rishofen]] on 31 May 1945.<ref>{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=1}}</ref> He was born three weeks after [[Seventh United States Army|US Army]] [[Military occupation|occupied]] the town and the [[End of World War II in Europe|unconditional surrender of Germany]]. The aftermath of [[World War II]] deeply marked his childhood and the lives of his family.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=2}}</ref> In compliance with his mother's wishes, Fassbinder later claimed he was born in 1946, to more clearly establish himself as a child of the post-war period; his real age was revealed shortly before his death.<ref name=\"Thomsen 3\">{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=3}}</ref> He was the only child of Liselotte Pempeit (1922\u201393), a translator, and Helmut Fassbinder, a doctor who worked from the couple's apartment in [[Sendlinger Stra\u00dfe]],<ref name=\"Hayman 2\">{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=2}}</ref> near [[Munich]]'s [[red light district]].<ref name=\"Thomsen 3\"/><ref name=\" Thomsen 3\"/><ref name=\"Watson 13\">{{harv|Watson|1996|p=13}}</ref> When he was three months old, he was left with a paternal uncle and aunt in the country, since his parents feared he would not survive the winter with them. He was one year old when he was returned to his parents in Munich.<ref name=\"Thomsen 3\"/> Fassbinder's mother came from the [[Free City of Danzig]] (now [[Gda\u0144sk]], [[Poland]]), whence many Germans had fled following World War II. As a result, a number of her relatives came to live with them in Munich.\n\nFassbinder's parents were cultured members of the bourgeoisie. His father mainly concentrated on his career, which he saw as a means to indulge his passion for writing poetry. His mother largely ignored him as well, spending the majority of her time with her husband working on his career. In 1951, Liselotte Pempeit and Helmut Fassbinder divorced. Helmut moved to [[Cologne]] while Liselotte raised her son as a single parent in Munich.<ref name=\"Watson 13\"/> In order to support herself and her child, Pempeit took in boarders and found employment as a German to English translator. When she was working, she often sent her son to the cinema to pass time. Later in life, Fassbinder claimed that he saw at least a film a day, sometimes even four a day. During this period, Pempeit was often away from her son for long periods while she recuperated from [[tuberculosis]].<ref name=\"Hayman 3\">{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=3}}</ref> In his mother's absence, Fassbinder was looked after by his mother's tenants and friends. As he was often left alone, he became used to the independence and thus, became a juvenile delinquent. He clashed with his mother's younger lover Siggi, who lived with them when Fassbinder was around eight or nine years old. He had a similar difficult relationship with the much older journalist Wolff Eder (c.1905\u201371), who became his stepfather in 1959.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|pp=14\u201315}}</ref> Early in his adolescence, Fassbinder came out as homosexual.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=15}}</ref>\n\nAs a teen, Fassbinder was sent to boarding school. His time there was marred by his repeated escape attempts, and he eventually left school before any final examinations. At the age of 15, he moved to Cologne with his father.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=5}}</ref> Though they argued constantly, Fassbinder stayed with his father for a couple of years while attending night school. To earn money he worked small jobs, and also helped his father who rented shabby apartments to immigrant workers. During his time with his father, Fassbinder began to immerse himself in the world of culture, writing poems, short plays, and stories.<ref name=\"lorenz48\">{{harv|Lorenz|Schmid|Gehr|1997|p=248}}</ref>\n\n==Beginnings==\nIn 1963, aged eighteen, Fassbinder returned to Munich with plans to attend night school with the idea to eventually study drama. Following his mother's advice, he took acting lessons and from 1964 to 1966 attended the Fridl-Leonhard Studio for actors in Munich.<ref name=\"lorenz48\"/> There, he met [[Hanna Schygulla]], who would become one of his most important actors.<ref>{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=27}}</ref> During this time, he made his first [[8mm film]]s and worked as assistant director, [[Audio engineering|sound man]], or in small acting roles.<ref name=\"lorenz48\"/> During this period, he also wrote the tragic-comic play: ''Drops on Hot Stones''. To gain entry to the [[Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin|Berlin Film School]], Fassbinder submitted a film version of his play ''Parallels''. He also entered several 8&nbsp;mm films including ''This Night'' (now considered [[Lost film|lost]]),<ref>{{harv|Lorenz|Schmid|Gehr|1997|p=3}}</ref> but he was turned down for admission, as were [[Werner Schroeter]] and [[Rosa von Praunheim]] who would also have careers as film directors.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=43}}</ref>\n\nHe returned to Munich where he continued with his writing. He also made two short films,''The City Tramp'' (''Der Stadtstreicher'', 1966) and ''The Little Chaos'' (''Das Kleine Chaos'', 1967). Shot in [[black and white film|black and white]], they were financed by Fassbinder's lover, Christoph Roser, an aspiring actor, in exchange for leading roles.<ref>{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=29}}</ref> Fassbinder acted in both of these films, which also featured [[Irm Hermann]]. In the latter, his mother \u2013 under the name of Lilo Pempeit \u2013 played the first of many parts in her son's films.<ref>{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=26}}</ref>\n\n==Theater career==\nFassbinder joined the Munich Action-Theater in 1967; there, he was active as actor, director and scriptwriter. After two months he became the company's leader. In April 1968 he directed the premiere production of his play ''Katzelmacher'', which tells the story of a foreign worker from Greece who becomes the object of intense racial, sexual, and political hatred among a group of Bavarian slackers. A few weeks later, in May 1968, the Action-Theater was disbanded after its theater was wrecked by one of its founders, jealous of Fassbinder's growing power within the group.<ref name=\" Elsaesser 301\">{{harv|Elsaesser|1996|p=301}}</ref>  It promptly reformed as the Anti-Theater under Fassbinder's direction.<ref name=\" Elsaesser 301\"/> The troupe lived and performed together. This close-knit group of young actors included among them Fassbinder, [[Peer Raben]], [[Harry Baer]] and [[Kurt Raab]], who along with Hanna Schygulla and Irm Hermann became the most important members of his cinematic stock company.<ref name=\" Elsaesser 301\"/> Working with the Anti-Theater, Fassbinder continued writing, directing and acting. In the space of eighteen months he directed twelve plays. Of these twelve plays, four were written by Fassbinder; he rewrote five others.\n\nThe style of his stage directing closely resembled that of his early films, a mixture of choreographed movement and static poses, taking its cues not from the traditions of stage theater, but from musicals, cabaret, films and the student protest movement.\n\nAfter he made his earliest feature films in 1969, Fassbinder centered his efforts in his career as film director, but maintained an intermittent foothold in the theater until his death. He worked in various productions throughout Germany and made a number of radio plays in the early 1970s. In 1974 Fassbinder took directorial control over the Theater am Turm (TAT) of Frankfurt; when this project ended in failure and controversy, Fassbinder became less interested in theater.\n\n==Early films and acclaim==\nFassbinder used his theatrical work as a springboard for making films; and many of the Anti-Theater actors and crew worked with him throughout his entire career (for instance, he made 20 films each with actresses Hanna Schygulla and Irm Herrmann). He was strongly influenced by Brecht's ''[[Distancing effect|Verfremdungseffekt]]'' (alienation effect) and the [[French New Wave]] cinema, particularly the works of [[Jean-Luc Godard]].<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=111}}</ref><ref>{{harv|Elsaesser|1996|p=348}}</ref> Fassbinder developed his rapid working methods early. Because he knew his actors and technicians so well, Fassbinder was able to complete as many as four or five films per year on extremely low budgets. This allowed him to compete successfully for the government grants needed to continue making films.\n\nUnlike the other major ''auteurs'' of the New German Cinema, [[Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff]], [[Werner Herzog]] and [[Wim Wenders]], who started out making movies, Fassbinder's stage background was evident throughout his work. Additionally, he learned how to handle all phases of production, from writing and acting to direction and theater management. This versatility surfaced in his films too where, in addition to some of the aforementioned responsibilities, Fassbinder served as composer, production designer, cinematographer, producer and editor. He also appeared in thirty projects of other directors.\n\nBy 1976, Fassbinder had gained international prominence, prizes at major [[film festival]]s, premieres and retrospectives in Paris, New York and Los Angeles, and a study of his work by [[Tony Rayns]] had been published. All these factors helped make him a familiar name among cinephiles and campus audiences throughout the world.

His films were a fixture in art houses of the time after he became internationally known with ''[[Ali: Fear Eats the Soul]]''. In 1977, he was a member of the jury at the [[27th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1977/04_jury_1977/04_Jury_1977.html |title=Berlinale 1977: Juries |publisher=berlinale.de |language=German |accessdate=19 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Film career==\nStarting at the age of 21, Fassbinder made forty-four films and television dramas in fifteen years, along with directing fifteen plays for the theatre. These films were largely written or adapted for the screen by Fassbinder. He was also [[art director]] on most of the early films, editor or co-editor on many of them (often credited as Franz Walsh, though the spelling varies), and he acted in nineteen of his own films as well as for other directors.<ref name=\"Watson 24\">{{harv|Watson|1992|p=13}}</ref> He wrote fourteen plays, created new versions of six classical plays, and directed or co-directed twenty-five stage plays. He wrote and directed four radio plays and wrote song lyrics. In addition, he wrote thirty-three screenplays and collaborated with other screenwriters on thirteen more. On top of this, he occasionally performed many other roles such as cinematographer and producer on a small number of them. Working with a regular ensemble of actors and technicians, he was able to complete films ahead of schedule and often under budget and thus compete successfully for government subsidies. He worked fast, typically omitting rehearsals and going with the first take.<ref name=\"Watson 24\"/>\n\nFassbinder's first ten films (1969\u20131971) were said to be an extension of his work in the theater, shot usually with a static camera and with deliberately unnaturalistic dialogue.<ref name=\"sensesofcinema1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2002/great-directors/fassbinder/ |title=\u00bb Rainer Werner Fassbinder |author=Joe Ruffell |work=sensesofcinema.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971 through 1977, his films brought him international attention, with films modeled, to ironic effect, on the melodramas [[Douglas Sirk]] made in Hollywood in the 1950s. In these films, Fassbinder explored how deep-rooted prejudices about race, sex, [[sexual orientation]], politics and class are inherent in society, while also tackling his trademark subject of the everyday [[fascism]] of family life and friendship.<ref name=\"sensesofcinema1\"/>\n\nThe final films, from around 1977 until his death, were more varied, with international actors sometimes used and the stock company disbanded, although the casts of some films were still filled with Fassbinder regulars.<ref name=\"sensesofcinema1\"/> He became increasingly idiosyncratic in terms of plot, form and subject matter in movies like ''The Marriage of Maria Braun'' (1979), ''The Third Generation'' (1979) and ''Querelle'' (1982). He also articulated his themes in the bourgeois milieu with his trilogy about women in post-[[fascist]] Germany: ''The Marriage of Maria Braun'' (1979), ''The Angst of Veronica Voss'' and ''Lola''.\n\n\"I would like to build a house with my films\", Fassbinder once remarked. \"Some are the cellars, others the walls, still others the windows. But I hope in the end it will be a house.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ehrenstein |first=David |date=9 July 2002 |title=Rainer's Parade |journal=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |publisher=Here Publishing |issue=867 |page=64 |issn=0001-8996 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=eGQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA64&dq=I+would+like+to+build+a+house+with+my+films+Rainer+Werner+Fassbinder#v=onepage&q=I%20would%20like%20to%20build%20a%20house%20with%20my%20films%20Rainer%20Werner%20Fassbinder&f=false}}</ref>\n\nFassbinder's work as a filmmaker was honored in the 2007 exhibition ''Fassbinder: Berlin Alexanderplatz'', which was organized by [[Klaus Biesenbach]] at the Museum of Contemporary Art together with [[Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art]], Berlin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://momaps1.org/exhibitions/view/153 |title=Fassbinder: Berlin Alexanderplatz |website=momaps1.org |access-date=26 September 2017}}</ref> For his exhibition at MoMA, Klaus Biesenbach received the [[International Association of Art Critics]] (AICA) award.\n\n===Avant-garde films (1969\u20131971)===\nWorking simultaneously in theater and film, Fassbinder created his own style from a fusion of the two artforms. His ten early films are characterized by a self-conscious and assertive [[formalism (film)|formalism]]. Influenced by [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Jean-Marie Straub]] and the theories of [[Bertolt Brecht]], these films are austere and minimalist in style. Although praised by many critics, they proved too demanding and inaccessible for a mass audience. Fassbinder's rapid working methods had begun by this stage.\n\n====''Love Is Colder Than Death'' (1969)====\nShot in black and white with a shoestring budget in April 1969, Fassbinder's first feature-length film, ''[[Love Is Colder Than Death (film)|Love Is Colder Than Death]]'' (1969) (''Liebe ist k\u00e4lter als der Tod''), was a [[deconstruction]] of the American gangster films of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. Fassbinder plays the lead role of Franz, a small-time pimp who is torn between his mistress Joanna, a prostitute played by Hanna Schygulla, and his friend Bruno, a gangster sent after Franz by the syndicate that he has refused to join. Joanna informs the police of a bank robbery the two men have planned. Bruno is killed in the shootout, but Franz and Joanna escape.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=69}}</ref><ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=66}}</ref>\n\n''Love Is Colder Than Death'' is a low key film with muted tone, long sequences, non-naturalistic acting and little dialogue.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=71}}</ref><ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=67}}</ref> Success was not immediate. ''Love Is Colder Than Death'' was ill-received at its premiere at the [[19th Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin Film Festival]]. The film, however, already displays the themes that were to remain present through the director's subsequent work: loneliness, the longing for companionship and love, and the fear and reality of betrayal.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=69}}</ref>\n\n====''Katzelmacher'' (1969)====\nFassbinder's second film, ''[[Katzelmacher]]'' (1969), (Bavarian pejorative slang term for a foreign worker from the Mediterranean), was received more positively, garnering five prizes after its debut at [[Mannheim]]. It features a group of rootless and bored young couples who spend much of their time in idle chatter, empty boasting, drinking, playing cards, intriguing or simply sitting around. The arrival of Jorgos, a guest worker from Greece, leads to a growing curiosity on the part of the women and the antagonism among the men living in a suburban block of apartments in Munich.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=80}}</ref> This kind of social criticism, featuring alienated characters unable to escape the forces of oppression, is a constant throughout Fassbinder's oeuvre. ''Katzelmacher'' was adapted from Fassbinder's first produced play \u2013 a short piece that was expanded from forty minutes to feature length, moving the action from a country village to Munich and delaying the appearance of Jorgos.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=79}}</ref>\n\n====''Gods of the Plague'' (1970)====\n''[[Gods of the Plague]]'' (''G\u00f6tter der Pest'') is a bleak gangster film with a winter setting, shot mostly indoors and at night. The character of Franz (from Fassbinder's first film, but now played by Harry Baer) is released from prison, but falls back with the wrong crowd. He teams up with his best friend, a black Bavarian criminal who killed his brother, to raid a supermarket. Both men are betrayed by Franz's jilted lover Joanna who tips off the police. Franz is killed, and the film ends at his laconic funeral.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=72}}</ref>\n\nSimilar in plot and characters to both ''Love is Colder than Death'' (1969) and ''The American Soldier'' (1970), ''Gods of the Plague''{{'}}s theme of homoerotic love would reappear repeatedly in the director's films.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=73}}</ref>\n\n====''Why Does Herr R. Run Amok?'' (1970)====\nThe last of the four films Fassbinder shot in 1969, was his first in color, ''[[Why Does Herr R. Run Amok?]]'' ''(Warum l\u00e4uft Herr R. Amok?)''. It was co-directed by [[Michael Fengler]] (the friend who had been his cameraman on the short film ''The little Chaos'' in 1967). Only the outlines of the scenes were sketched by Fassbinder. Fengler and the cast then improvised the dialogue. Fassbinder asserted that this was really Fengler's work rather than his. Nevertheless, the two were jointly given a directorial award for the project in the 1971 German Film prize competition, and ''Why Does Herr R. Run Amok?'' has always been considered among Fassbinder's films.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=82}}</ref>\n\n''Why Does Herr R. Run Amok?'' portrays the life of Herr Raab, a technical draughtsman married and with a small child. The pressures of middle-class life take a toll on him. A visit by a woman neighbor occasions the incident that gives the film its title. Irritated by the incessant chat between his wife and her friend while he tries to watch TV, Herr Raab kills the neighbor with a blow to the head with a candle stick and then kills both his wife and their son. Herr Raab is later found hanged in an office restroom.<ref name=\"Watson 1996 83\">{{harv|Watson|1996|p=83}}</ref>\n\n====''The American Soldier'' (1970)====\nThe main theme of the gangster film ''[[The American Soldier]]'' ''(Der Amerikanische Soldat)'' is that violence is an expression of frustrated love. A sudden frenzied outburst of repressed passion, the revelation of desire and a need for love that has been thwarted and comes too late is central here.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=71}}</ref> The eponymous hit man of the title (actually a German, played by Karl Scheydt) is a cold-blooded contract killer, who returns from [[Vietnam]] to his native Munich, where he is hired by three renegade policemen to do away with a number of undesirables. Eventually he ends up killing the girlfriend of one of the policemen with his friend Franz Walsh (Fassbinder). The film closes with the music of the song \"So much tenderness\", written by Fassbinder and sung by Gunther Kaufmann. ''The American Soldier'' is the third and final installment of Fassbinder's  loose trilogy of gangster pictures formed by ''Love is Colder Than Death'' and ''Gods of the Plague''. It pays homage to the Hollywood gangster genre, and also alludes to [[Southern Gothic]] race narratives.\n\n====''The Niklashausen Journey'' (1970)====\nIn ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Niklashauser Fart|de|3=Niklashauser Fart|lt=The Niklashausen Journey}}'' (''Die Niklashauser Fahrt''), Fassbinder co-writes and co-directs with Michael Fengler. This avant-garde film, commissioned by the WDR television network, was shot in May 1970 and it was broadcast in October the same year.<ref name=\"Watson 87\">{{harv|Watson|1996|p=87}}</ref>''The Niklashausen Journey'' was loosely based on the real-life of Hans Boehm, a shepherd who in 1476 claimed that the Virgin Mary called him to foment an uprising against the church and upper classes. Despite a temporary success, Boehm's followers were eventually massacred and he was burned at the stake.<ref name=\"Watson 87\"/> Fassbinder's intention was to show how and why revolutions fail.<ref name=\"Iden 129\">{{harv|Iden|1981|p=129}}</ref> His approach was to compare the political and sexual turmoil of feudal Germany with that of the contraculture movement and the [[protests of 1968]]. Fassbinder did not clarify the time frame of the action, mixing medieval elements (including some costumes, settings, speech and music) with those from other time periods, like the Russian Revolution, the [[Rococo]] period, postwar Germany and the [[Third World]].<ref name=\"Iden 129\"/>\n\n''The Niklashausen Journey'', influenced by [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Weekend (1967 film)|Weekend]]'' and [[Glauber Rocha]]'s ''[[Antonio das Mortes]]'', consists of only about a dozen or so scenes, most of which are either theatrical tableaux where there is no movement of the characters and the camera darts from speaker to speaker or are shots where characters pace back and forth while giving revolutionary speeches about Marxist struggles and debates on economic theories.<ref name=\"Watson 88\">{{harv|Watson|1996|p=88}}</ref>\n\n====''Whity'' (1970)====\nSet in 1876, ''[[Whity (film)|Whity]]'' centers on the title character, a [[mulatto]] who works as the obsequious servant in the mansion of a dysfunctional family in the American South. He is the illegitimate son of the family patriarch and the black cook. Whity tries to carry out all their orders, however demeaning until several of the family members ask him to kill some of the others. He eventually kills them all and runs away to, the desert with a prostitute from the local bar.\n\nThe film was shot in [[Almeria]], [[Spain]], in widescreen, on locations built for the Westerns made by [[Sergio Leone]]. Its production was particularly traumatic for cast and crew. ''Whity'', a mixture of Euro-western and American South melodrama, was badly received by the critics and became Fassbinder's biggest flop. The film was neither picked up for theatrical release, nor was there interest for broadcasting it on television. As a result, ''Whity'' was only seen as its premiere. It remained unavailable until the 1990s, when it began to be screened; now, like almost all of Fassbinder's films, it is available on [[DVD]].\n\n====''Rio das Mortes'' (1971)====\nA whimsical comedy, ''[[Rio das Mortes (film)|Rio das Mortes]]'' follows two young men without prospects who try to raise money in order to realize their dream of finding a buried treasure in [[Peru]] using a map of the [[Rio das Mortes]]. The girlfriend of one of them finds the notion stupid and wants to put a stop to it, but eventually the two friends find a patroness to finance their adventure.<ref>{{harv|Sandford|1982|p=72}}</ref>\n\nBased on an idea by [[Volker Schlondorff]], ''Rio das Mortes'' was shot in January 1970 following ''[[Why Does Herr R. Run Amok?]]'',<ref name=\"Watson 1996 83\"/> but was broadcast on television a year later in February 1971.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=294}}</ref> The film feels casually constructed; the humor is bland and the plot has been criticized for its sloppiness and poor character development.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jclarkmedia.com/fassbinder/fassbinder08.html |title=Fassbinder's Rio das Mortes |last=Clark |first=Jim |date=7 December 2002 |publisher=jclarkmedia.com |accessdate=21 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222082657/http://jclarkmedia.com/fassbinder/fassbinder08.html |archivedate=22 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomsen 86\">{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=86}}</ref> ''Rio das Mortes'' is best remembered for a scene unrelated to the plot, as the girlfriend, played by Schygulla, dances to [[Elvis Presley]]'s \"[[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]]\" on the jukebox in the company of an oafish leather-jacketed youth, played by Fassbinder.<ref name=\"Thomsen 86\"/>\n\n====''Pioneers in Ingolstadt'' (1971)====\n''[[Pioneers in Ingolstadt]]'' ''(Pioniere in Ingolstadt)'' was adapted from an [[Pioneers in Ingolstadt|eponymous]] play by [[Marieluise Flei\u00dfer]] written in 1927.<ref name=\"Sandford 74\">{{harv|Sandford|1982|p=74}}</ref> It follows two young women whose lives are transformed when army engineers (the pioneers of the title) arrive to their town to build a bridge. One of the women flirts from soldier to soldier, but her friend falls in love only to be abandoned.<ref name=\"Thomsen 97\">{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=97}}</ref>\n\nShot in November 1970, ''Pioneers in Ingolstaldt''  was commissioned for television. Fassbinder wanted to bring the plot from the 1920s to contemporary Germany, but the producers, fearing to offend the German army, refused. A compromise did not satisfy any of the parties, and midway through the project Fassbinder lost interest in it.<ref name=\"Sandford 74\"/> The film suffered as a consequence, and it ranks among Fassbinder's weakest films.<ref name=\"Watson 88\"/><ref name=\"Sandford 75\">{{harv|Sandford|1982|p=75}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomsen 95\">{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=95}}</ref>\n\nThe tensions and bitterness that had surrounded the making of ''Whity'' led Fassbinder to dismantle the collective project of the anthiteather as a production company. Instead, he founded his own production company: Tango films.<ref name=\"Sandford 75\"/> ''Pioneers in Ingolstadt'', although broadcast before the theatrical release of ''Beware of a Holy Whore'', was the last film made by Fassbinder during his formative period. In the following year, 1971, Fassbinder shot only one film: ''The Merchant of Four Seasons''.<ref name=\"Sandford 75\"/><ref>{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=IX}}</ref><ref>{{harv|Lorenz|Schmid|Gehr|1997|p=326}}</ref><ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=326}}</ref>\n\n====''Beware of a Holy Whore'' (1971)====\n''[[Beware of a Holy Whore]]'' was based, like many of Fassbinder's films, on a personal experience \u2013 the shooting of his earlier film, the revisionist western ''Whity'' (1970). The film shows an egomaniacal director, beset by a stalled production, temperamental actors, and a frustrated crew. When asked what the movie he is making is about, he replies: \"brutality.\" The film ends with a typical Fassbinder-esque irony, as the crew gang up on the director. ''Beware of a Holy Whore'' marked the end of Fassbinder's avant-garde period. It presented such an embittered and radical self-critique that his future films would have to be quite different from the ones made before. After spinning out ten films in not much more than a year (this film was shot only a few months after ''Whity'') in a frenzied burst of creativity, his anti-film anti-theater drive seemed to conclude.\n\n===German melodramas (1971\u20131975)===\nAfter ''Pioneers in Ingolstadt'', Fassbinder took an eight-month break from filmmaking. During this time, he turned for a model to Hollywood melodrama, particularly the films German \u00e9migr\u00e9 Douglas Sirk made in Hollywood for [[Universal Studios|Universal-International]] in the 1950s: ''[[All That Heaven Allows]]'', ''[[Magnificent Obsession (1954 film)|Magnificent Obsession]]'' and ''[[Imitation of Life (1959 film)|Imitation of Life]]''. Fassbinder was attracted to these films not only because of their entertainment value, but also for their depiction of various kinds of repression and exploitation.\n\n====''The Merchant of Four Seasons'' (1971)====\nFassbinder scored his first domestic commercial success with ''[[The Merchant of Four Seasons]]'' (''H\u00e4ndler der vier Jahreszeiten'', 1971).<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=117}}</ref> The film portrays a married couple who are fruit sellers. Hans faces rejection from his family after he violently assaults his wife for not bending to his will. She leaves him, but after he suffers a heart attack they reunite, though he now has to employ other men. His restricted ability to function leads him to ponder his own futility. He literally drinks himself to death.\n\n''The Merchant of Four Seasons'' uses melodrama as a style to create critical studies of contemporary German life for a general audience. It was Fassbinder's first effort to create what he declared he aspired to: a cinematic statement of the human condition that would transcend national boundaries as the films of [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Federico Fellini]] had done.<ref name=\"Pipolo\">{{harv|Pipolo|2004|pp=18\u201325}}</ref> It is also his first realization of what he learned from Sirk: that people, however small they may be, and their emotions, however insignificant they may seem, could be big on the movie screen.<ref name=\"Pipolo\"/>\n\n====''The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant'' (1972)====\nLoneliness is a common theme in Fassbinder's work, together with the idea that power becomes a determining factor in all human relationships. His characters yearn for love, but seem condemned to exert an often violent control over those around them. A good example is ''[[The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant]]'' (''Die bitteren Tr\u00e4nen der Petra von Kant'', 1972) which was adapted by Fassbinder from his plays. The title character is a fashion designer who lives in a self-created dreamland and the action is restricted mostly to her lavish bedroom. After the failure of her second marriage, Petra falls hopelessly and obsessively in love with Karin, a cunning working-class young woman who wants a career in modeling. The model's exploitation of Petra mirrors Petra's extraordinary psychological abuse of her silent assistant, Marlene. Fassbinder portrays the slow meltdown of these relationships as inevitable, and his actresses (there are no men in the film) move in a slow, trance-like way that hints at a vast world of longing beneath the beautiful, brittle surface.\n\n====''Jailbait'' (1973)====\n''{{Interlanguage link multi|Wildwechsel|de|3=Wildwechsel (Film)|lt=Jailbait}}'' (''Wildwechsel'', 1973), also known as ''Wild Game Crossing'', is a bleak story of  teenage angst, set in industrial northern Germany during the 1950s. Like in many other of his films, Fassbinder analyses lower middle class life with characters who, unable to articulate their feelings, bury them in inane phrases and violent acts.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=118}}</ref>  Love turns into a power struggle of deception and betrayal. The story centers on Hanni, a precocious fourteen-year-old schoolgirl who starts a relationship with Franz, a nineteen-year-old worker in a chicken processing plant. Their romance faces the opposition of the girl's conservative parents. Franz is sentenced to nine months in prison for having sex with a minor. When he is released on probation, they continue their relationship and Hanni becomes pregnant. Afraid of her father's anger, she persuades Franz to kill him. Back in prison, Franz is told by Hanni that their child died at birth and that their love was \"only physical\".<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=120}}</ref>\n\nOriginally made for German television, ''Jailbait'' was based on a play by [[Franz Xaver Kroetz]], who violently disagreed with Fassbinder's adaptation, calling it pornographic.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=119}}</ref> The luridness of its theme furthered the controversy.\n\n====''World on a Wire'' (1973)====\nHis only [[science fiction film]], ''[[World on a Wire]]'' (''Welt am Draht'', 1973), was a departure for Fassbinder. An adaptation of the pulp sci-fi novel ''[[Simulacron-3]]'' by [[Daniel F. Galouye]], it was made as a two-part, 205 minute production for television using [[16mm film]] stock during a hiatus from the lengthy production of ''Effi Briest'' and in the same year as ''Martha'' and ''Ali: Fear Eats the Soul''.\n\nA story of realities within realities, ''World on a Wire'' follows a researcher, working at the institute of cybernetics and future science, who begins to investigate the  mysterious death of his mentor. He falls deep into the cover up behind a computer capable of creating an artificial world with units living as human beings unaware that their world is just a computer  projection. Made in contemporary Paris, the film was stylistically inspired by [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Alphaville (film)|Alphaville]]'' (1965) and in its theme of artificial humans wanting to reach real life anticipated [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982).<ref name=\"Thomsen 136\">{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=136}}</ref>\n\n====''Ali: Fear Eats the Soul'' (1974)====\nFassbinder first gained international success with ''[[Ali: Fear Eats the Soul|Fear Eats the Soul]]'' (''Angst essen Seele auf'', 1974). This film was shot in fifteen days in September 1973 with a very low budget, ranking among Fassbinder's quickest and cheapest. Nevertheless, the impact on Fassbinder's career and in overseas release remains cemented as a great and influential work. It won the International Critics Prize at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] and was acclaimed by critics everywhere as one of 1974's best films.\n\n''Fear Eats the Soul'' was loosely inspired by Sirk's ''All That Heaven Allows'' (1955). It details the vicious response of family and community to a lonely aging white cleaning lady who marries a muscular, much younger black Moroccan immigrant worker. The two are drawn to each other out of mutual loneliness. When their relationship becomes known, they experience various forms of hostility and public rejection. Gradually, their relationship is tolerated, not out of real acceptance, but because those around the good-hearted old lady realize their ability to exploit her is threatened. As the external pressures over the couple begin to subside, internal conflicts surface.\n\n====''Martha'' (1974)====\nFassbinder's main characters tend to be naifs, either men or women, who are rudely, sometimes murderously disabused of their romantic illusions. Shot on 16mm film and made for television, ''[[Martha (1974 film)|Martha]]'' (1974) is a melodrama about cruelty in a traditional marriage.\n\nThe plot focuses on the title character, a spinster librarian. Soon after the death of her father while on vacation in [[Rome]], Martha meets a wealthy civil engineer who sweeps her off her feet. They encounter again at a wedding in her hometown of [[Konstanz (district)|Constance]] and marry. However their married life becomes an exercise for her husband to express his sadism and for Martha to endure her masochism. Her husband shows his desire for her violently leaving marks on her body. He obsessively controls her life, her diet, her taste in music and her interest until she is confined to their house. Martha's initially positive wish to be liked by her oppressive and abusive husband push her to such an extreme that she becomes deranged leading to her own permanent physical paralysis.\n\n====''Effi Briest'' (1974)====\n''[[Effi Briest (1974 film)|Effi Briest]]'' was Fassbinder's dream film and the one in which he invested the most work. While he normally took between nine and 20 days to make a film, this time it required 58 shooting days, dragged out over two years.<ref name=\"Thomsen 145\">{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=145}}</ref> The film is a period piece adapted from [[Theodor Fontane]]'s classic [[Effi Briest|novel]] of 1894, concerning the consequences of betrayed love. Set in the closed, repressive Prussian society of the [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] era, the film paints a portrait of a woman's fate completely linked to an unbending and utterly unforgiving code of social behavior. The plot follows the story of Effi Briest, a young woman who seeks to escape her stifling marriage to a much older man by entering into a brief affair with a charming soldier. Six years later, Effi's husband discovers her affair with tragic consequences.\n\nThe film served as a showpiece for Fassbinder's muse and favorite actress [[Hanna Schygulla]], whose detached acting style fitted the roles the director created for her. Fassbinder made her a star, but artistic differences while making ''Effi Briest'' created a split that lasted for some years, until Fassbinder called her back to take the role of Maria Braun.\n\n====''Like a Bird on a Wire'' (1975)====\n''Like a Bird on a Wire'' (''Wie ein Vogel auf dem Draht'') is a forty-minute television production featuring [[Brigitte Mira]], the main actress in ''Fear eats the Soul'', singing cabaret songs and love ballads from the 1940s and 1950s. Between songs, she drinks and talks about her husbands. The title is borrowed from [[Leonard Cohen]]'s song \"[[Bird on the Wire]]\", with which the program ends.\n\nFassbinder considered this project \"an attempt to do a show about the [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer era]]. For us it certainly wasn't entirely successful. But the film does reveal the utter repulsiveness and sentimentality of the time\" he explained.<ref>{{harv|Kardish|1997|p=57}}</ref>\n\n====''Fox and His Friends'' (1975)====\nMany of Fassbinder's films deal with homosexuality, in keeping with his interest in characters who are social outsiders, but he drew away from most representations of homosexuals in films. In an interview at the 1975 [[Cannes Film Festival]], Fassbinder said about ''[[Fox and His Friends]]'': \"It is certainly the first film in which the characters are homosexuals, without homosexuality being made into a problem. In films, plays or novels, if homosexuals appear, the homosexuality was the problem, or it was a comic turn. But here homosexuality is shown as completely normal, and the problem is something quite different, it's a love story, where one person exploits the love of the other person, and that's the story I always tell\".<ref name=\"Thomsen\n181\">{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=181}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Fox and His Friends'' (''Faustrecht der Freiheit'', 1974) a sweet but unsophisticated working-class homosexual wins the lottery and falls in love with the elegant son of an industrialist. His lover tries to mold him into a gilt-edged mirror of upper-class values, all the while appropriating Fox's lottery winnings for his own ends. He ultimately destroys Fox's illusions, leaving him heartbroken and destitute.\n\nFassbinder worked within the limits of Hollywood melodrama, though the film is partially based on the plight of his then lover Armin Meier (to whom the film is dedicated). The film is notable for Fassbinder's performance as the unlucky Fox, in a self-directed starring role.\n\n''Fox and His Friends'' has been deemed homophobic by some and overly pessimistic by others.<ref name=\"Thomsen 182\">{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=182}}</ref> The film's homosexuals are not, surprisingly, any different from the film's equally lecherous heterosexuals. The film's pessimism is far outweighed by Fassbinder's indictment of Fox as an active participant in his own victimization, a familiar critique found in many of the director's films.\n\n====''Mother K\u00fcsters Goes to Heaven'' (1975)====\nIn ''[[Mother K\u00fcsters Goes to Heaven]]'' (''Mutter K\u00fcsters Fahrt zum Himmel''), a [[melodrama]], Emma K\u00fcsters becomes the center of media and political attention after her husband, a factory worker, killed his supervisor or his supervisor's son and then himself when lay offs were announced. The film drew on both Sirk's melodramas and Weimar-era workers' films, connecting the genres to tell a political coming-of-age story about Mother K\u00fcsters, who seeks to understand what led to her husband's actions and how to respond.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gerhardt |first=Christina |title=Fassbinder's Mothers K\u00fcsters Goes to Heaven in a Genealogy of the Arbeiterfilme |work=[[Film Criticism]] |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/f/fc/13761232.0041.109?view=text;rgn=main |date=28 June 2017 |accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref> The film is very critical of the era's politics and media, as the people to whom Emma K\u00fcsters turns all exploit her and her experience. The media, communists, anarchists and even her own family members all take advantage of Mother K\u00fcsters's tragedy to advance their own agendas.\n\n===='' Fear of Fear'' (1975)====\nMade for German television, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Angst vor der Angst|de|3=Angst vor der Angst|lt=Fear of Fear}}'' (''Angst vor der Angst'') is a physiological drama about a middle-class housewife, locked into a dull life with a distracted husband, two small children, and openly hostile in-laws. She becomes addicted to [[valium]] and alcohol overwhelmed by an irrational anxiety and fear of her inexorable descent into madness.\n\n''Fear of Fear'' is similar in theme to ''Martha'', which also portrays the effect of a dysfunctional marriage in an oppressed housewife, the central role was again played by [[Margit Carstensen]].\n\n====''I Only Want You to Love Me'' (1976)====\n''[[I Only Want You To Love Me]]'' (''Ich will doch nur, da\u00df ihr mich liebt'', 1976) tells the story of Peter, a construction worker in jail for manslaughter. His life is recounted in a series of flashbacks. A hard working man, Peter spends his spare time building a house for his cold unloving parents. He marries and finds a job in another city, but in his desperate yearning for affection he tries to buy the love of those around him with expensive gifts which soon makes him fall into a spiral of debt. When he sees his own unrequited love for his parents reflected during an argument in a bar, he kills a man who serves as a proxy for his father.\n\nThe film was made for television and shot during a pause while making ''Satan's Brew''. Based on a true account taken from ''For Life'', a book of interviews edited by Klaus Antes and Christiane Erhardt, it was Fassbinder's personal reflections on childhood and adolescence.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n====''Satan's Brew'' (1976)====\nIn a time of professional crisis, Fassbinder made ''[[Satan's Brew]]'' (''Satansbraten'', 1976) a bleak amoral comedy that pays homage to [[Antonin Artaud]]'s  [[theatre of cruelty]]. Stylistically far from the melodramas that made him known internationally, ''Satan's Brew'' gave way to a new phase in his career. In ''Satan's Brew'', a neurotic poet suffering from writer's block struggles to make ends meet while dealing with a frustrated long suffering wife, a half witted brother and various prostitutes and masochist women who drift in and out of his life. He convinces himself to be the reincarnation of the gay romantic poet [[Stefan George]] (1868\u20131933) after he plagiarizes his poem ''The Albatros''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brightlightsfilm.com/a-german-tragedy-turned-absurd-fassbinders-satans-brew/|title=A German Tragedy, Turned Absurd: Fassbinder's Satan's Brew|date=2010-02-01|website=Bright Lights Film Journal|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\n===International films (1976\u20131982)===\nEnthusiasm for Fassbinder's films grew quickly after ''Fear Eats the Soul''. [[Vincent Canby]] paid tribute to Fassbinder as \"the most original talent since Godard\". In 1977, the New Yorker Theater in Manhattan held a Fassbinder Festival.\n\nHowever, as enthusiasm for Fassbinder grew outside of Germany, his films still failed to impress the native audience. At home, he was better known for his television work and for his open homosexuality. Coupled with the controversial issues of his films \u2014 terrorism, [[state violence]], [[racism]], sexual politics \u2014 it seemed that everything Fassbinder did provoked or offended someone.\n\nAfter completing in 1978 his last low-budget and very personal ventures (''[[In a Year of 13 Moons]]'' and ''[[The Third Generation (1979 film)|The Third Generation]]'') he would concentrate on making films that were becoming increasingly garish and stylized. However, his TV series ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'' was a naturalistic adaptation of the two-volume novel by [[Alfred D\u00f6blin]], which Fassbinder had read many times.\n\n====''Chinese Roulette '' (1976)====\n''[[Chinese Roulette]]'' (''Chinesisches Roulette'') is a gothic thriller with an ensemble cast. The film follows a twelve-year-old crippled girl, Angela, who, due to her parents' lack of affection, arranges an encounter between them with their respective lovers at the family country estate. The film climaxes with a truth-guessing game. The players divide into two teams, which take it in turn to pick out one member of the other side and ask them question about people and objects. The game is played at the suggestion of Angela, who plays against her mother. When the mother asks: \"In the [[Third Reich]], what would that person have been?\", Angela's answer is \"Commandant of the [[concentration camp]] at [[Bergen Belsen]]\"; it is her mother she is describing.<ref name=\"Hayman, 142\">{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=142}}</ref>\n\n====''The Stationmaster's Wife'' (1977)====\nThere are no happy endings in Fassbinder's films. His protagonists, usually weak men or women with masochistic tendencies, pay a heavy price for their victimization. ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Bolwieser|de|3=Bolwieser|lt=The Stationmaster's Wife}}'' (''Bolwieser'') is based on a 1931 novel, ''Bolwieser: The Novel Of a Husband'' by the Bavarian writer [[Oskar Maria Graf]]. The plot follows the downfall of Xaver Bolwieser, a railway stationmaster submitted to the will of his domineering and unfaithful wife, whose repeated infidelities completely ruin Bolwieser's life. Broadcast initially as a two-part television series, ''The Stationmaster's Wife'' was shortened to a 112-minute feature film and released  in the first anniversary of Fassbinder's death. The film stars [[Kurt Raab]], Fassbinder's close friend whom the director usually cast as a pathetic man. Raab was also set designer of Fassbinder's films until their friendship and professional relationship broke up after making this film.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|pp=206\u2013207}}</ref>\n\n====''Germany in Autumn'' (1978)====\n''[[Germany in Autumn]]'' ''(Deutschland im Herbst)'' is an [[omnibus film]], a collective work of eight German filmmakers including Fassbinder, [[Alf Brustellin]], [[Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff]], [[Bernhard Sinkel]] and [[Alexander Kluge]], the main organizer behind the project. They took a look at the wave of guilt and paranoia that afflicted [[West Germany]]'s society and its authorities in the months between the kidnapping and murder of industrialist [[Hanns Martin Schleyer]] by [[Red Army Faction]] members and the deaths of [[Andreas Baader]], [[Gudrun Ensslin]] and [[Jan-Carl Raspe]] in [[Stammheim Prison]]. The film is a document about terrorism and its sociopolitical aftermath. It begins with Schleyer's wake, a segment filmed by Alexander Kluge and Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff, and it ends with the tumultuous joint funeral of Baader, Ensslin, and Raspe in Stuttgart.\n\n====''Despair'' (1978)====\nFassbinder made three films in [[English language|English]], a language in which he was not proficient: ''[[Despair (film)|Despair]]''  (1978), ''Lili Marleen'' (1980) and ''Querelle'' (1982). All three films have international actors and are very ambitious, yet each faced artistic and commercial problems.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=34}}</ref>\n''Despair'' is based upon the 1936 [[Despair (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Vladimir Nabokov]], adapted by [[Tom Stoppard]] and featuring [[Dirk Bogarde]]. It was made on a budget of 6,000,000 [[Deutsche Mark|DEM]], exceeding the total cost of Fassbinder's first fifteen films.\n\n''[[Despair (film)|Despair \u2013 A journey into the Light]]'' (''Despair \u2013 Eine Reise ins Licht'') tells the story of Hermann Hermann, an unbalanced Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 and chocolate magnate, whose business and marriage have both grown bitter. The factory is close to bankruptcy, and his vulgar wife is chronically unfaithful. He hatches an elaborate plot to take a new identity in the belief it will free him of all his worries. The story of Hermann's descent into madness is juxtaposed against the rise of [[National Socialism]] in the Germany of the 1930s.\n\n====''In a Year of Thirteen Moons'' (1978)====\n\n''[[In a Year of Thirteen Moons]]'' (''In einem Jahr mit 13 Monden'', 1978) is Fassbinder most personal and bleakest work. The film follows the tragic life of Elvira, a [[transsexual]] formerly known as Erwin. In the last few days before her suicide, she decides to visit some of the important people and places in her life. In one sequence, Elvira wanders through the slaughterhouse where she worked as Erwin, recounting her history amid the meat-hooked corpses of cattle whose slit throats rain blood onto the floor.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=257}}</ref> In another scene, Elvira returns to the orphanage where she was raised by [[nun]]s and hears the brutal story of her childhood. Fassbinder's camera tracks the nun (played by his mother) telling Elvira's story; she moves with a kind of military precision through the grounds, recounting the story in blazing detail, unaware that Elvira had collapsed and can no longer hear it.\n\n''In a Year of Thirteen Moons'' was explicitly personal, a reaction to his former lover Armin Meier's suicide.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=255}}</ref> In addition to writing, directing, and editing, Fassbinder also designed the production and worked as the cameraman. When the film played in the New York Film Festival in October 1979, critic [[Vincent Canby]] (who championed Fassbinder's work in the United States) wrote, \"Its only redeeming feature is genius.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C02E6D71438E432A2575BC0A9669D946890D6CF|title=In a Year of 13 Moons (1978) Film: Fassbinder's 'Year of 13 Moons': Unalterable Condition|last=Canby|first=Vincent|date=18 October 1979|newspaper=nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\n====''The Marriage of Maria Braun'' (1979)====\n\nWith ''[[The Marriage of Maria Braun]]'' (''Die Ehe der Maria Braun''), his greatest success, Fassbinder finally attained the popular acceptance he sought with German audiences. The title character is an ambitious and strong willed woman separated from her husband towards the end of World War II. The plot follows Maria Braun's steady rise as a successful business woman during the [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer]] era. Maria's dream of a happy life with her husband remains unfulfilled. Her professional achievements are not accompanied by personal happiness.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=209}}</ref> The film, constructed in the Hollywood tradition of \"women's pictures\" presenting a woman overcoming hardships, serves also as a parable of the West Germany economic miracle embodied in the character of Maria Braun. Her story of manipulation and betrayal parallels Germany's spectacular postwar economic recovery in terms of its cost in human values.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=243}}</ref>\n\nThe film was the first part of a trilogy centered on women during the post-war \"[[Wirtschaftswunder|economic miracle]]\" which was completed with ''[[Lola (1981 film)|Lola]]'' (1981) and ''[[Veronika Voss]]'' (1982).\n\n====''The Third Generation'' (1979)====\nThe economic success of ''The Marriage of Maria Braun'' allowed Fassbinder to pay his debts and to embark on a personal project, ''[[The Third Generation (1979 film)|The Third Generation]]'' (''Die Dritte Generation'', 1979), a black comedy about terrorism. Fassbinder found financial backing for this film difficult to acquire  and it was ultimately made on a small budget and borrowed money.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=164}}</ref> As he did  with ''In a Year of Thirteen Moons'', Fassbinder worked again as the film's cameraman.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=263}}</ref>\n\nThe film concerns a group of aspiring terrorists from leftist bourgeois backgrounds who kidnap an industrialist during carnival season unaware that they have been manipulated by the capitalist and the authorities whose hidden agenda is for terrorism to create a demand for security hardware and to gain support for harsher security measures. The actions of the ineffectual cell of underground terrorists are overlaid with a soundtrack filled with newscast, voiceovers, music and gibberish. The political theme of the film aroused controversy.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n====''Berlin Alexanderplatz'' (1980)====\nReturning to his explorations of German history, Fassbinder finally realized his dream of adapting [[Alfred D\u00f6blin]]'s 1929 novel ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]''. A [[Berlin Alexanderplatz (television)|television series]] running more than 13 hours, with a two-hour coda (released in the U.S. as a 15-hour feature), it was the culmination of the director's inter-related themes of love, life, and power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2008/01/17/the-genius-of-berlin/|title=The Genius of Berlin|last=Buruma|first=Ian|website=The New York Review of Books|date=January 17, 2008|accessdate=February 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n''Berlin Alexanderplatz'' centers on Franz Biberkopf, a former convict and minor pimp, who tries to stay out of trouble but is dragged down by crime, poverty and the duplicity of those around him. His best friend, Reinhold, makes him lose an arm and murders Franz' prostitute girlfriend, Mieze. The love triangle of Franz, Reinhold and Mieze is staged against the rising tide of Nazism in Germany. The film emphasized the sadomasochist relationship between Biberkopf and Reinhold  stressing its homoerotic nature. Fassbinder had read the book at age fourteen; later claiming that it helped him survive a \"murderous puberty\". The influence of D\u00f6blin's novel can be seen in many of Fassbinder's films most of whose protagonists are named Franz, some with the surname Biberkopf like the na\u00efve working class lottery winner in ''Fox and His Friends'', who is played by Fassbinder. He also took the pseudonym of Franz Walsch for his work as editor on his own films: Walsch was an oblique homage to director [[Raoul Walsh]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n====''Lili Marleen'' (1981)====\nFassbinder took on the [[Nazi]] period with ''[[Lili Marleen (film)|Lili Marleen]]'', an international co production, shot in English and with a large budget. The script was vaguely based on the autobiography of [[World War II]] singer [[Lale Andersen]], ''The Sky Has Many Colors''.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=215}}</ref> The film is constructed as a big, tear-jerking [[Hollywood]] [[melodrama]] in its depiction of the unfulfilled love story between a German variety singer separated by the war from a Swiss Jewish composer. Central to the story is the [[Lili Marleen|song]] that gives the film its title.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nFassbinder presents the period of the [[Third Reich]] as a predictable development of German history that was staged as spectacle supported by hate. Filmed with a morbid nostalgia for [[swastika]]s, showbiz glitz and as a cloak-and-dagger romance, the main theme of ''Lili Marleen'' is the question: is it morally justifiable to survive under National Socialism, as the na\u00efve singer does by having a successful career?<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=295}}</ref>\n\n====''Theater In Trance'' (1981)====\n\n''Theater In Trance'' is a documentary which Fassbinder shot in Cologne in June 1981 at the \"Theaters of the World\" Festival. Over scenes from groups such as the [[Squat Theatre]] and the [[Pina Bausch|Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch]] Fassbinder spoke passages from [[Antonin Artaud]] as well as his own commentary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kinowelt-international.de/detail_v3.php?lang=en&kid=009561_1_1&CID=b3e62c9a68f6952c56ed2b6eba5224cc|title=Theatre In Trance|publisher=kinowelt-international.de}}</ref>\n\n====''Lola'' (1981)====\n''[[Lola (1981 film)|Lola]]'' tells the story of an upright, new building commissioner who arrives in a small town. He falls in love with Lola, innocently unaware of the fact that she is a famed prostitute and the mistress of an unscrupulous developer. Unable to reconcile his idealistic image of Lola with reality, the commissioner spirals into the very corruption he had sought to fight out.\n\n====''Veronika Voss'' (1982)====\nFassbinder won the [[Golden Bear]] at the [[32nd Berlin International Film Festival]] for ''[[Veronika Voss]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1982/03_preistr_ger_1982/03_Preistraeger_1982.html|title=Prizes & Honours 1982|publisher=berlinale.de|language=German|accessdate=14 November 2010}}</ref> The original German title, ''Die Sehnsucht der Veronika Voss'', translates as \"The longing of Veronika Voss\". Set in the 1950s, the film depicts the twilight years of the title character, a faded Nazi starlet. A sports reporter becomes enthralled by the unbalanced actress and discovers that she is under the power of a villainous doctor who supplies her with the drugs she craves so long as she can pay the exorbitant fee. Despite the reporter's best attempts, he is unable to save her from a terrible end.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=221}}</ref>\n\n====''Querelle'' (1982)====\nFassbinder did not live to see the premiere of his last film, ''[[Querelle]]'', based on [[Jean Genet]]'s novel ''[[Querelle of Brest|Querelle de Brest]]''.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=256}}</ref> The plot follows the title character, a handsome sailor who is a thief and hustler. Frustrated in a homoerotic relationship with his own brother, Querelle betrays those who love him and pays them even with murder.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Ritrat ad Rainer Werner Fassbinder SW.svg|thumb|upright|[[Digital art]] depicting Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]\nFassbinder had [[Bisexuality|sexual relationships with both men and women]]. He rarely kept his professional and personal life separate, and was known to cast family, friends and lovers in his films. Early in his career he had a lasting but fractured relationship with [[Irm Hermann]], a former secretary whom he forced to become an actress.<ref>{{harv|Lorenz|Schmid|Gehr|1997|p=20}}</ref> Fassbinder usually cast her in unglamorous roles, most notably as the unfaithful wife in ''[[The Merchant of Four Seasons]]'' and the silent abused assistant in ''[[The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant]]''.\n\nIrm Hermann idolized him, but Fassbinder tormented and tortured her for over a decade.<ref name=\"Hayman 22\">{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=22}}</ref> This included [[domestic violence]]: \"He couldn't conceive of my refusing him, and he tried everything.

Despite the fact that Kaufmann was married and had two children, Fassbinder fell madly in love with him. The two began a turbulent affair which ultimately affected the production of ''Baal''. Fassbinder tried to buy Kaufmann's love by casting him in major roles in his films and buying him expensive gifts.<ref>{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=62}}</ref>\n\nKaufmann relished the attention and became more demanding. Fassbinder bought him four [[Lamborghini]]s over the period of a year; Kauffmann wrecked one and sold the others if they failed to meet his expectations.<ref>{{harv|Katz|1987|p=46}}</ref> The relationship came to an end when Kaufmann became romantically involved with composer [[Peer Raben]].

His best-known role was as Ali in ''[[Ali: Fear Eats the Soul]]'' (1974). Their three-year relationship was punctuated with jealousy, violence and heavy drug and alcohol use. Fassbinder finally ended the relationship in 1974, due to Salem's chronic alcoholism and tendency to become violent when he drank. Shortly after the breakup, Salem stabbed three people (none fatally) in Berlin and had to be smuggled out of Berlin.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=19}}</ref> Salem eventually made his way to France where he was arrested and imprisoned.

He is widely regarded as a prominent figure and catalyst of the [[New German Cinema]] movement.\n\nHis first feature-length film was a gangster movie called ''[[Love Is Colder Than Death (film)|Love Is Colder Than Death]]'' (1969); he scored his first domestic commercial success with ''[[The Merchant of Four Seasons]]'' (1972) and his first international success with ''[[Ali: Fear Eats the Soul]]'' (1974), both of which are considered masterpieces by contemporary critics. Big-budget projects such as ''[[Despair (film)|Despair]]'' (1978), ''[[Lili Marleen (film)|Lili Marleen]]'' and ''[[Lola (1981 film)|Lola]]'' (both 1981) followed.\n\nHis greatest success came with ''[[The Marriage of Maria Braun]]'' (1979), chronicling the rise and fall of a German woman in the wake of [[World War II]]. Other notable films include ''[[The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant]]'' (1972), ''[[Fox and His Friends]]'' (1975), ''[[Satan's Brew]]'' (1976), and ''[[Querelle]]'' (1982), all of which focused on [[LGBT|gay and lesbian]] themes.\n\nFassbinder died on 10 June 1982, at the age of 37, from a lethal cocktail of [[cocaine]] and [[barbiturate]]s. Although his career lasted less than two decades, he was extremely prolific; by the time of his death, he had completed over forty feature films, two television series, three short films, four video productions, and twenty-four plays.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early life==\nFassbinder was born in the small town of [[Bad W\u00f6rishofen]] on 31 May 1945.<ref>{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=1}}</ref> He was born three weeks after [[Seventh United States Army|US Army]] [[Military occupation|occupied]] the town and the [[End of World War II in Europe|unconditional surrender of Germany]]. The aftermath of [[World War II]] deeply marked his childhood and the lives of his family.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=2}}</ref> In compliance with his mother's wishes, Fassbinder later claimed he was born in 1946, to more clearly establish himself as a child of the post-war period; his real age was revealed shortly before his death.<ref name=\"Thomsen 3\">{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=3}}</ref> He was the only child of Liselotte Pempeit (1922\u201393), a translator, and Helmut Fassbinder, a doctor who worked from the couple's apartment in [[Sendlinger Stra\u00dfe]],<ref name=\"Hayman 2\">{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=2}}</ref> near [[Munich]]'s [[red light district]].<ref name=\"Thomsen 3\"/><ref name=\" Thomsen 3\"/><ref name=\"Watson 13\">{{harv|Watson|1996|p=13}}</ref> When he was three months old, he was left with a paternal uncle and aunt in the country, since his parents feared he would not survive the winter with them. He was one year old when he was returned to his parents in Munich.<ref name=\"Thomsen 3\"/> Fassbinder's mother came from the [[Free City of Danzig]] (now [[Gda\u0144sk]], [[Poland]]), whence many Germans had fled following World War II. As a result, a number of her relatives came to live with them in Munich.\n\nFassbinder's parents were cultured members of the bourgeoisie. His father mainly concentrated on his career, which he saw as a means to indulge his passion for writing poetry. His mother largely ignored him as well, spending the majority of her time with her husband working on his career. In 1951, Liselotte Pempeit and Helmut Fassbinder divorced. Helmut moved to [[Cologne]] while Liselotte raised her son as a single parent in Munich.<ref name=\"Watson 13\"/> In order to support herself and her child, Pempeit took in boarders and found employment as a German to English translator. When she was working, she often sent her son to the cinema to pass time. Later in life, Fassbinder claimed that he saw at least a film a day, sometimes even four a day. During this period, Pempeit was often away from her son for long periods while she recuperated from [[tuberculosis]].<ref name=\"Hayman 3\">{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=3}}</ref> In his mother's absence, Fassbinder was looked after by his mother's tenants and friends. As he was often left alone, he became used to the independence and thus, became a juvenile delinquent. He clashed with his mother's younger lover Siggi, who lived with them when Fassbinder was around eight or nine years old. He had a similar difficult relationship with the much older journalist Wolff Eder (c.1905\u201371), who became his stepfather in 1959.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|pp=14\u201315}}</ref> Early in his adolescence, Fassbinder came out as homosexual.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=15}}</ref>\n\nAs a teen, Fassbinder was sent to boarding school. His time there was marred by his repeated escape attempts, and he eventually left school before any final examinations. At the age of 15, he moved to Cologne with his father.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=5}}</ref> Though they argued constantly, Fassbinder stayed with his father for a couple of years while attending night school. To earn money he worked small jobs, and also helped his father who rented shabby apartments to immigrant workers. During his time with his father, Fassbinder began to immerse himself in the world of culture, writing poems, short plays, and stories.<ref name=\"lorenz48\">{{harv|Lorenz|Schmid|Gehr|1997|p=248}}</ref>\n\n==Beginnings==\nIn 1963, aged eighteen, Fassbinder returned to Munich with plans to attend night school with the idea to eventually study drama. Following his mother's advice, he took acting lessons and from 1964 to 1966 attended the Fridl-Leonhard Studio for actors in Munich.<ref name=\"lorenz48\"/> There, he met [[Hanna Schygulla]], who would become one of his most important actors.<ref>{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=27}}</ref> During this time, he made his first [[8mm film]]s and worked as assistant director, [[Audio engineering|sound man]], or in small acting roles.<ref name=\"lorenz48\"/> During this period, he also wrote the tragic-comic play: ''Drops on Hot Stones''. To gain entry to the [[Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin|Berlin Film School]], Fassbinder submitted a film version of his play ''Parallels''. He also entered several 8&nbsp;mm films including ''This Night'' (now considered [[Lost film|lost]]),<ref>{{harv|Lorenz|Schmid|Gehr|1997|p=3}}</ref> but he was turned down for admission, as were [[Werner Schroeter]] and [[Rosa von Praunheim]] who would also have careers as film directors.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=43}}</ref>\n\nHe returned to Munich where he continued with his writing. He also made two short films,''The City Tramp'' (''Der Stadtstreicher'', 1966) and ''The Little Chaos'' (''Das Kleine Chaos'', 1967). Shot in [[black and white film|black and white]], they were financed by Fassbinder's lover, Christoph Roser, an aspiring actor, in exchange for leading roles.<ref>{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=29}}</ref> Fassbinder acted in both of these films, which also featured [[Irm Hermann]]. In the latter, his mother \u2013 under the name of Lilo Pempeit \u2013 played the first of many parts in her son's films.<ref>{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=26}}</ref>\n\n==Theater career==\nFassbinder joined the Munich Action-Theater in 1967; there, he was active as actor, director and scriptwriter. After two months he became the company's leader. In April 1968 he directed the premiere production of his play ''Katzelmacher'', which tells the story of a foreign worker from Greece who becomes the object of intense racial, sexual, and political hatred among a group of Bavarian slackers. A few weeks later, in May 1968, the Action-Theater was disbanded after its theater was wrecked by one of its founders, jealous of Fassbinder's growing power within the group.<ref name=\" Elsaesser 301\">{{harv|Elsaesser|1996|p=301}}</ref>  It promptly reformed as the Anti-Theater under Fassbinder's direction.<ref name=\" Elsaesser 301\"/> The troupe lived and performed together. This close-knit group of young actors included among them Fassbinder, [[Peer Raben]], [[Harry Baer]] and [[Kurt Raab]], who along with Hanna Schygulla and Irm Hermann became the most important members of his cinematic stock company.<ref name=\" Elsaesser 301\"/> Working with the Anti-Theater, Fassbinder continued writing, directing and acting. In the space of eighteen months he directed twelve plays. Of these twelve plays, four were written by Fassbinder; he rewrote five others.\n\nThe style of his stage directing closely resembled that of his early films, a mixture of choreographed movement and static poses, taking its cues not from the traditions of stage theater, but from musicals, cabaret, films and the student protest movement.\n\nAfter he made his earliest feature films in 1969, Fassbinder centered his efforts in his career as film director, but maintained an intermittent foothold in the theater until his death. He worked in various productions throughout Germany and made a number of radio plays in the early 1970s. In 1974 Fassbinder took directorial control over the Theater am Turm (TAT) of Frankfurt; when this project ended in failure and controversy, Fassbinder became less interested in theater.\n\n==Early films and acclaim==\nFassbinder used his theatrical work as a springboard for making films; and many of the Anti-Theater actors and crew worked with him throughout his entire career (for instance, he made 20 films each with actresses Hanna Schygulla and Irm Herrmann). He was strongly influenced by Brecht's ''[[Distancing effect|Verfremdungseffekt]]'' (alienation effect) and the [[French New Wave]] cinema, particularly the works of [[Jean-Luc Godard]].<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=111}}</ref><ref>{{harv|Elsaesser|1996|p=348}}</ref> Fassbinder developed his rapid working methods early. Because he knew his actors and technicians so well, Fassbinder was able to complete as many as four or five films per year on extremely low budgets. This allowed him to compete successfully for the government grants needed to continue making films.\n\nUnlike the other major ''auteurs'' of the New German Cinema, [[Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff]], [[Werner Herzog]] and [[Wim Wenders]], who started out making movies, Fassbinder's stage background was evident throughout his work. Additionally, he learned how to handle all phases of production, from writing and acting to direction and theater management. This versatility surfaced in his films too where, in addition to some of the aforementioned responsibilities, Fassbinder served as composer, production designer, cinematographer, producer and editor. He also appeared in thirty projects of other directors.\n\nBy 1976, Fassbinder had gained international prominence, prizes at major [[film festival]]s, premieres and retrospectives in Paris, New York and Los Angeles, and a study of his work by [[Tony Rayns]] had been published. All these factors helped make him a familiar name among cinephiles and campus audiences throughout the world. He lived in Munich when not traveling, rented a house in Paris with ex-wife Ingrid Caven.<ref name=\"nicodemus\">{{cite web |url=http://www.signandsight.com/features/1372.html |title=No morals without style |last=Nicodemus |first=Katja |date=31 May 2007 |publisher=signandsight.com}}</ref> He was often seen in gay bars in New York, earning him cult hero status, but also a controversial reputation in and out of his films. His films were a fixture in art houses of the time after he became internationally known with ''[[Ali: Fear Eats the Soul]]''. In 1977, he was a member of the jury at the [[27th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1977/04_jury_1977/04_Jury_1977.html |title=Berlinale 1977: Juries |publisher=berlinale.de |language=German |accessdate=19 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Film career==\nStarting at the age of 21, Fassbinder made forty-four films and television dramas in fifteen years, along with directing fifteen plays for the theatre. These films were largely written or adapted for the screen by Fassbinder. He was also [[art director]] on most of the early films, editor or co-editor on many of them (often credited as Franz Walsh, though the spelling varies), and he acted in nineteen of his own films as well as for other directors.<ref name=\"Watson 24\">{{harv|Watson|1992|p=13}}</ref> He wrote fourteen plays, created new versions of six classical plays, and directed or co-directed twenty-five stage plays. He wrote and directed four radio plays and wrote song lyrics. In addition, he wrote thirty-three screenplays and collaborated with other screenwriters on thirteen more. On top of this, he occasionally performed many other roles such as cinematographer and producer on a small number of them. Working with a regular ensemble of actors and technicians, he was able to complete films ahead of schedule and often under budget and thus compete successfully for government subsidies. He worked fast, typically omitting rehearsals and going with the first take.<ref name=\"Watson 24\"/>\n\nFassbinder's first ten films (1969\u20131971) were said to be an extension of his work in the theater, shot usually with a static camera and with deliberately unnaturalistic dialogue.<ref name=\"sensesofcinema1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2002/great-directors/fassbinder/ |title=\u00bb Rainer Werner Fassbinder |author=Joe Ruffell |work=sensesofcinema.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971 through 1977, his films brought him international attention, with films modeled, to ironic effect, on the melodramas [[Douglas Sirk]] made in Hollywood in the 1950s. In these films, Fassbinder explored how deep-rooted prejudices about race, sex, [[sexual orientation]], politics and class are inherent in society, while also tackling his trademark subject of the everyday [[fascism]] of family life and friendship.<ref name=\"sensesofcinema1\"/>\n\nThe final films, from around 1977 until his death, were more varied, with international actors sometimes used and the stock company disbanded, although the casts of some films were still filled with Fassbinder regulars.<ref name=\"sensesofcinema1\"/> He became increasingly idiosyncratic in terms of plot, form and subject matter in movies like ''The Marriage of Maria Braun'' (1979), ''The Third Generation'' (1979) and ''Querelle'' (1982). He also articulated his themes in the bourgeois milieu with his trilogy about women in post-[[fascist]] Germany: ''The Marriage of Maria Braun'' (1979), ''The Angst of Veronica Voss'' and ''Lola''.\n\n\"I would like to build a house with my films\", Fassbinder once remarked. \"Some are the cellars, others the walls, still others the windows. But I hope in the end it will be a house.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ehrenstein |first=David |date=9 July 2002 |title=Rainer's Parade |journal=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |publisher=Here Publishing |issue=867 |page=64 |issn=0001-8996 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=eGQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA64&dq=I+would+like+to+build+a+house+with+my+films+Rainer+Werner+Fassbinder#v=onepage&q=I%20would%20like%20to%20build%20a%20house%20with%20my%20films%20Rainer%20Werner%20Fassbinder&f=false}}</ref>\n\nFassbinder's work as a filmmaker was honored in the 2007 exhibition ''Fassbinder: Berlin Alexanderplatz'', which was organized by [[Klaus Biesenbach]] at the Museum of Contemporary Art together with [[Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art]], Berlin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://momaps1.org/exhibitions/view/153 |title=Fassbinder: Berlin Alexanderplatz |website=momaps1.org |access-date=26 September 2017}}</ref> For his exhibition at MoMA, Klaus Biesenbach received the [[International Association of Art Critics]] (AICA) award.\n\n===Avant-garde films (1969\u20131971)===\nWorking simultaneously in theater and film, Fassbinder created his own style from a fusion of the two artforms. His ten early films are characterized by a self-conscious and assertive [[formalism (film)|formalism]]. Influenced by [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Jean-Marie Straub]] and the theories of [[Bertolt Brecht]], these films are austere and minimalist in style. Although praised by many critics, they proved too demanding and inaccessible for a mass audience. Fassbinder's rapid working methods had begun by this stage.\n\n====''Love Is Colder Than Death'' (1969)====\nShot in black and white with a shoestring budget in April 1969, Fassbinder's first feature-length film, ''[[Love Is Colder Than Death (film)|Love Is Colder Than Death]]'' (1969) (''Liebe ist k\u00e4lter als der Tod''), was a [[deconstruction]] of the American gangster films of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. Fassbinder plays the lead role of Franz, a small-time pimp who is torn between his mistress Joanna, a prostitute played by Hanna Schygulla, and his friend Bruno, a gangster sent after Franz by the syndicate that he has refused to join. Joanna informs the police of a bank robbery the two men have planned. Bruno is killed in the shootout, but Franz and Joanna escape.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=69}}</ref><ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=66}}</ref>\n\n''Love Is Colder Than Death'' is a low key film with muted tone, long sequences, non-naturalistic acting and little dialogue.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=71}}</ref><ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=67}}</ref> Success was not immediate. ''Love Is Colder Than Death'' was ill-received at its premiere at the [[19th Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin Film Festival]]. The film, however, already displays the themes that were to remain present through the director's subsequent work: loneliness, the longing for companionship and love, and the fear and reality of betrayal.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=69}}</ref>\n\n====''Katzelmacher'' (1969)====\nFassbinder's second film, ''[[Katzelmacher]]'' (1969), (Bavarian pejorative slang term for a foreign worker from the Mediterranean), was received more positively, garnering five prizes after its debut at [[Mannheim]]. It features a group of rootless and bored young couples who spend much of their time in idle chatter, empty boasting, drinking, playing cards, intriguing or simply sitting around. The arrival of Jorgos, a guest worker from Greece, leads to a growing curiosity on the part of the women and the antagonism among the men living in a suburban block of apartments in Munich.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=80}}</ref> This kind of social criticism, featuring alienated characters unable to escape the forces of oppression, is a constant throughout Fassbinder's oeuvre. ''Katzelmacher'' was adapted from Fassbinder's first produced play \u2013 a short piece that was expanded from forty minutes to feature length, moving the action from a country village to Munich and delaying the appearance of Jorgos.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=79}}</ref>\n\n====''Gods of the Plague'' (1970)====\n''[[Gods of the Plague]]'' (''G\u00f6tter der Pest'') is a bleak gangster film with a winter setting, shot mostly indoors and at night. The character of Franz (from Fassbinder's first film, but now played by Harry Baer) is released from prison, but falls back with the wrong crowd. He teams up with his best friend, a black Bavarian criminal who killed his brother, to raid a supermarket. Both men are betrayed by Franz's jilted lover Joanna who tips off the police. Franz is killed, and the film ends at his laconic funeral.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=72}}</ref>\n\nSimilar in plot and characters to both ''Love is Colder than Death'' (1969) and ''The American Soldier'' (1970), ''Gods of the Plague''{{'}}s theme of homoerotic love would reappear repeatedly in the director's films.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=73}}</ref>\n\n====''Why Does Herr R. Run Amok?'' (1970)====\nThe last of the four films Fassbinder shot in 1969, was his first in color, ''[[Why Does Herr R. Run Amok?]]'' ''(Warum l\u00e4uft Herr R. Amok?)''. It was co-directed by [[Michael Fengler]] (the friend who had been his cameraman on the short film ''The little Chaos'' in 1967). Only the outlines of the scenes were sketched by Fassbinder. Fengler and the cast then improvised the dialogue. Fassbinder asserted that this was really Fengler's work rather than his. Nevertheless, the two were jointly given a directorial award for the project in the 1971 German Film prize competition, and ''Why Does Herr R. Run Amok?'' has always been considered among Fassbinder's films.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=82}}</ref>\n\n''Why Does Herr R. Run Amok?'' portrays the life of Herr Raab, a technical draughtsman married and with a small child. The pressures of middle-class life take a toll on him. A visit by a woman neighbor occasions the incident that gives the film its title. Irritated by the incessant chat between his wife and her friend while he tries to watch TV, Herr Raab kills the neighbor with a blow to the head with a candle stick and then kills both his wife and their son. Herr Raab is later found hanged in an office restroom.<ref name=\"Watson 1996 83\">{{harv|Watson|1996|p=83}}</ref>\n\n====''The American Soldier'' (1970)====\nThe main theme of the gangster film ''[[The American Soldier]]'' ''(Der Amerikanische Soldat)'' is that violence is an expression of frustrated love. A sudden frenzied outburst of repressed passion, the revelation of desire and a need for love that has been thwarted and comes too late is central here.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=71}}</ref> The eponymous hit man of the title (actually a German, played by Karl Scheydt) is a cold-blooded contract killer, who returns from [[Vietnam]] to his native Munich, where he is hired by three renegade policemen to do away with a number of undesirables. Eventually he ends up killing the girlfriend of one of the policemen with his friend Franz Walsh (Fassbinder). The film closes with the music of the song \"So much tenderness\", written by Fassbinder and sung by Gunther Kaufmann. ''The American Soldier'' is the third and final installment of Fassbinder's  loose trilogy of gangster pictures formed by ''Love is Colder Than Death'' and ''Gods of the Plague''. It pays homage to the Hollywood gangster genre, and also alludes to [[Southern Gothic]] race narratives.\n\n====''The Niklashausen Journey'' (1970)====\nIn ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Niklashauser Fart|de|3=Niklashauser Fart|lt=The Niklashausen Journey}}'' (''Die Niklashauser Fahrt''), Fassbinder co-writes and co-directs with Michael Fengler. This avant-garde film, commissioned by the WDR television network, was shot in May 1970 and it was broadcast in October the same year.<ref name=\"Watson 87\">{{harv|Watson|1996|p=87}}</ref>''The Niklashausen Journey'' was loosely based on the real-life of Hans Boehm, a shepherd who in 1476 claimed that the Virgin Mary called him to foment an uprising against the church and upper classes. Despite a temporary success, Boehm's followers were eventually massacred and he was burned at the stake.<ref name=\"Watson 87\"/> Fassbinder's intention was to show how and why revolutions fail.<ref name=\"Iden 129\">{{harv|Iden|1981|p=129}}</ref> His approach was to compare the political and sexual turmoil of feudal Germany with that of the contraculture movement and the [[protests of 1968]]. Fassbinder did not clarify the time frame of the action, mixing medieval elements (including some costumes, settings, speech and music) with those from other time periods, like the Russian Revolution, the [[Rococo]] period, postwar Germany and the [[Third World]].<ref name=\"Iden 129\"/>\n\n''The Niklashausen Journey'', influenced by [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Weekend (1967 film)|Weekend]]'' and [[Glauber Rocha]]'s ''[[Antonio das Mortes]]'', consists of only about a dozen or so scenes, most of which are either theatrical tableaux where there is no movement of the characters and the camera darts from speaker to speaker or are shots where characters pace back and forth while giving revolutionary speeches about Marxist struggles and debates on economic theories.<ref name=\"Watson 88\">{{harv|Watson|1996|p=88}}</ref>\n\n====''Whity'' (1970)====\nSet in 1876, ''[[Whity (film)|Whity]]'' centers on the title character, a [[mulatto]] who works as the obsequious servant in the mansion of a dysfunctional family in the American South. He is the illegitimate son of the family patriarch and the black cook. Whity tries to carry out all their orders, however demeaning until several of the family members ask him to kill some of the others. He eventually kills them all and runs away to, the desert with a prostitute from the local bar.\n\nThe film was shot in [[Almeria]], [[Spain]], in widescreen, on locations built for the Westerns made by [[Sergio Leone]]. Its production was particularly traumatic for cast and crew. ''Whity'', a mixture of Euro-western and American South melodrama, was badly received by the critics and became Fassbinder's biggest flop. The film was neither picked up for theatrical release, nor was there interest for broadcasting it on television. As a result, ''Whity'' was only seen as its premiere. It remained unavailable until the 1990s, when it began to be screened; now, like almost all of Fassbinder's films, it is available on [[DVD]].\n\n====''Rio das Mortes'' (1971)====\nA whimsical comedy, ''[[Rio das Mortes (film)|Rio das Mortes]]'' follows two young men without prospects who try to raise money in order to realize their dream of finding a buried treasure in [[Peru]] using a map of the [[Rio das Mortes]]. The girlfriend of one of them finds the notion stupid and wants to put a stop to it, but eventually the two friends find a patroness to finance their adventure.<ref>{{harv|Sanford|1982|p=72}}</ref>\n\nBased on an idea by [[Volker Schlondorff]], ''Rio das Mortes'' was shot in January 1970 following ''[[Why Does Herr R. Run Amok?]]'',<ref name=\"Watson 1996 83\"/> but was broadcast on television a year later in February 1971.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=294}}</ref> The film feels casually constructed; the humor is bland and the plot has been criticized for its sloppiness and poor character development.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jclarkmedia.com/fassbinder/fassbinder08.html |title=Fassbinder's Rio das Mortes |last=Clark |first=Jim |date=7 December 2002 |publisher=jclarkmedia.com |accessdate=21 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222082657/http://jclarkmedia.com/fassbinder/fassbinder08.html |archivedate=22 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomsen 86\">{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=86}}</ref> ''Rio das Mortes'' is best remembered for a scene unrelated to the plot, as the girlfriend, played by Schygulla, dances to [[Elvis Presley]]'s \"[[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]]\" on the jukebox in the company of an oafish leather-jacketed youth, played by Fassbinder.<ref name=\"Thomsen 86\"/>\n\n====''Pioneers in Ingolstadt'' (1971)====\n''[[Pioneers in Ingolstadt]]'' ''(Pioniere in Ingolstadt)'' was adapted from an [[Pioneers in Ingolstadt|eponymous]] play by [[Marieluise Flei\u00dfer]] written in 1927.<ref name=\"Sanford 74\">{{harv|Sanford|1982|p=74}}</ref> It follows two young women whose lives are transformed when army engineers (the pioneers of the title) arrive to their town to build a bridge.

Fassbinder wanted to bring the plot from the 1920s to contemporary Germany, but the producers, fearing to offend the German army, refused. A compromise did not satisfy any of the parties, and midway through the project Fassbinder lost interest in it.<ref name=\"Sanford 74\"/> The film suffered as a consequence, and it ranks among Fassbinder's weakest films.<ref name=\"Watson 88\"/><ref name=\"Sanford 75\">{{harv|Sanford|1982|p=75}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomsen 95\">{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=95}}</ref>\n\nThe tensions and bitterness that had surrounded the making of ''Whity'' led Fassbinder to dismantle the collective project of the anthiteather as a production company. Instead, he founded his own production company: Tango films.<ref name=\"Sanford 75\"/> ''Pioneers in Ingolstadt'', although broadcast before the theatrical release of ''Beware of a Holy Whore'', was the last film made by Fassbinder during his formative period. In the following year, 1971, Fassbinder shot only one film: ''The Merchant of Four Seasons''.<ref name=\"Sanford 75\"/><ref>{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=IX}}</ref><ref>{{harv|Lorenz|Schmid|Gehr|1997|p=326}}</ref><ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=326}}</ref>\n\n====''Beware of a Holy Whore'' (1971)====\n''[[Beware of a Holy Whore]]'' was based, like many of Fassbinder's films, on a personal experience \u2013 the shooting of his earlier film, the revisionist western ''Whity'' (1970). The film shows an egomaniacal director, beset by a stalled production, temperamental actors, and a frustrated crew. When asked what the movie he is making is about, he replies: \"brutality.\" The film ends with a typical Fassbinder-esque irony, as the crew gang up on the director. ''Beware of a Holy Whore'' marked the end of Fassbinder's avant-garde period. It presented such an embittered and radical self-critique that his future films would have to be quite different from the ones made before. After spinning out ten films in not much more than a year (this film was shot only a few months after ''Whity'') in a frenzied burst of creativity, his anti-film anti-theater drive seemed to conclude.\n\n===German melodramas (1971\u20131975)===\nAfter ''Pioneers in Ingolstadt'', Fassbinder took an eight-month break from filmmaking. During this time, he turned for a model to Hollywood melodrama, particularly the films German \u00e9migr\u00e9 Douglas Sirk made in Hollywood for [[Universal Studios|Universal-International]] in the 1950s: ''[[All That Heaven Allows]]'', ''[[Magnificent Obsession (1954 film)|Magnificent Obsession]]'' and ''[[Imitation of Life (1959 film)|Imitation of Life]]''. Fassbinder was attracted to these films not only because of their entertainment value, but also for their depiction of various kinds of repression and exploitation.\n\n====''The Merchant of Four Seasons'' (1971)====\nFassbinder scored his first domestic commercial success with ''[[The Merchant of Four Seasons]]'' (''H\u00e4ndler der vier Jahreszeiten'', 1971).<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=117}}</ref> The film portrays a married couple who are fruit sellers. Hans faces rejection from his family after he violently assaults his wife for not bending to his will. She leaves him, but after he suffers a heart attack they reunite, though he now has to employ other men. His restricted ability to function leads him to ponder his own futility. He literally drinks himself to death.\n\n''The Merchant of Four Seasons'' uses melodrama as a style to create critical studies of contemporary German life for a general audience. It was Fassbinder's first effort to create what he declared he aspired to: a cinematic statement of the human condition that would transcend national boundaries as the films of [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Federico Fellini]] had done.<ref name=\"Pipolo\">{{harv|Pipolo|2004|pp=18\u201325}}</ref> It is also his first realization of what he learned from Sirk: that people, however small they may be, and their emotions, however insignificant they may seem, could be big on the movie screen.<ref name=\"Pipolo\"/>\n\n====''The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant'' (1972)====\nLoneliness is a common theme in Fassbinder's work, together with the idea that power becomes a determining factor in all human relationships. His characters yearn for love, but seem condemned to exert an often violent control over those around them. A good example is ''[[The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant]]'' (''Die bitteren Tr\u00e4nen der Petra von Kant'', 1972) which was adapted by Fassbinder from his plays. The title character is a fashion designer who lives in a self-created dreamland and the action is restricted mostly to her lavish bedroom. After the failure of her second marriage, Petra falls hopelessly and obsessively in love with Karin, a cunning working-class young woman who wants a career in modeling. The model's exploitation of Petra mirrors Petra's extraordinary psychological abuse of her silent assistant, Marlene. Fassbinder portrays the slow meltdown of these relationships as inevitable, and his actresses (there are no men in the film) move in a slow, trance-like way that hints at a vast world of longing beneath the beautiful, brittle surface.\n\n====''Jailbait'' (1973)====\n''{{Interlanguage link multi|Wildwechsel|de|3=Wildwechsel (Film)|lt=Jailbait}}'' (''Wildwechsel'', 1973), also known as ''Wild Game Crossing'', is a bleak story of  teenage angst, set in industrial northern Germany during the 1950s. Like in many other of his films, Fassbinder analyses lower middle class life with characters who, unable to articulate their feelings, bury them in inane phrases and violent acts.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=118}}</ref>  Love turns into a power struggle of deception and betrayal. The story centers on Hanni, a precocious fourteen-year-old schoolgirl who starts a relationship with Franz, a nineteen-year-old worker in a chicken processing plant. Their romance faces the opposition of the girl's conservative parents. Franz is sentenced to nine months in prison for having sex with a minor. When he is released on probation, they continue their relationship and Hanni becomes pregnant. Afraid of her father's anger, she persuades Franz to kill him. Back in prison, Franz is told by Hanni that their child died at birth and that their love was \"only physical\".<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=120}}</ref>\n\nOriginally made for German television, ''Jailbait'' was based on a play by [[Franz Xaver Kroetz]], who violently disagreed with Fassbinder's adaptation, calling it pornographic.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=119}}</ref> The luridness of its theme furthered the controversy.\n\n====''World on a Wire'' (1973)====\nHis only [[science fiction film]], ''[[World on a Wire]]'' (''Welt am Draht'', 1973), was a departure for Fassbinder. An adaptation of the pulp sci-fi novel ''[[Simulacron-3]]'' by [[Daniel F. Galouye]], it was made as a two-part, 205 minute production for television using [[16mm film]] stock during a hiatus from the lengthy production of ''Effi Briest'' and in the same year as ''Martha'' and ''Ali: Fear Eats the Soul''.\n\nA story of realities within realities, ''World on a Wire'' follows a researcher, working at the institute of cybernetics and future science, who begins to investigate the  mysterious death of his mentor. He falls deep into the cover up behind a computer capable of creating an artificial world with units living as human beings unaware that their world is just a computer  projection. Made in contemporary Paris, the film was stylistically inspired by [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Alphaville (film)|Alphaville]]'' (1965) and in its theme of artificial humans wanting to reach real life anticipated [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982).<ref name=\"Thomsen 136\">{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=136}}</ref>\n\n====''Ali: Fear Eats the Soul'' (1974)====\nFassbinder first gained international success with ''[[Ali: Fear Eats the Soul|Fear Eats the Soul]]'' (''Angst essen Seele auf'', 1974). This film was shot in fifteen days in September 1973 with a very low budget, ranking among Fassbinder's quickest and cheapest. Nevertheless, the impact on Fassbinder's career and in overseas release remains cemented as a great and influential work. It won the International Critics Prize at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] and was acclaimed by critics everywhere as one of 1974's best films.\n\n''Fear Eats the Soul'' was loosely inspired by Sirk's ''All That Heaven Allows'' (1955). It details the vicious response of family and community to a lonely aging white cleaning lady who marries a muscular, much younger black Moroccan immigrant worker. The two are drawn to each other out of mutual loneliness. When their relationship becomes known, they experience various forms of hostility and public rejection. Gradually, their relationship is tolerated, not out of real acceptance, but because those around the good-hearted old lady realize their ability to exploit her is threatened. As the external pressures over the couple begin to subside, internal conflicts surface.\n\n====''Martha'' (1974)====\nFassbinder's main characters tend to be naifs, either men or women, who are rudely, sometimes murderously disabused of their romantic illusions. Shot on 16mm film and made for television, ''[[Martha (1974 film)|Martha]]'' (1974) is a melodrama about cruelty in a traditional marriage.\n\nThe plot focuses on the title character, a spinster librarian. Soon after the death of her father while on vacation in [[Rome]], Martha meets a wealthy civil engineer who sweeps her off her feet. They encounter again at a wedding in her hometown of [[Konstanz (district)|Constance]] and marry. However their married life becomes an exercise for her husband to express his sadism and for Martha to endure her masochism. Her husband shows his desire for her violently leaving marks on her body. He obsessively controls her life, her diet, her taste in music and her interest until she is confined to their house. Martha's initially positive wish to be liked by her oppressive and abusive husband push her to such an extreme that she becomes deranged leading to her own permanent physical paralysis.\n\n====''Effi Briest'' (1974)====\n''[[Effi Briest (1974 film)|Effi Briest]]'' was Fassbinder's dream film and the one in which he invested the most work. While he normally took between nine and 20 days to make a film, this time it required 58 shooting days, dragged out over two years.<ref name=\"Thomsen 145\">{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=145}}</ref> The film is a period piece adapted from [[Theodor Fontane]]'s classic [[Effi Briest|novel]] of 1894, concerning the consequences of betrayed love. Set in the closed, repressive Prussian society of the [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] era, the film paints a portrait of a woman's fate completely linked to an unbending and utterly unforgiving code of social behavior. The plot follows the story of Effi Briest, a young woman who seeks to escape her stifling marriage to a much older man by entering into a brief affair with a charming soldier. Six years later, Effi's husband discovers her affair with tragic consequences.\n\nThe film served as a showpiece for Fassbinder's muse and favorite actress [[Hanna Schygulla]], whose detached acting style fitted the roles the director created for her. Fassbinder made her a star, but artistic differences while making ''Effi Briest'' created a split that lasted for some years, until Fassbinder called her back to take the role of Maria Braun.\n\n====''Like a Bird on a Wire'' (1975)====\n''Like a Bird on a Wire'' (''Wie ein Vogel auf dem Draht'') is a forty-minute television production featuring [[Brigitte Mira]], the main actress in ''Fear eats the Soul'', singing cabaret songs and love ballads from the 1940s and 1950s. Between songs, she drinks and talks about her husbands. The title is borrowed from [[Leonard Cohen]]'s song \"[[Bird on the Wire]]\", with which the program ends.\n\nFassbinder considered this project \"an attempt to do a show about the [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer era]]. For us it certainly wasn't entirely successful. But the film does reveal the utter repulsiveness and sentimentality of the time\" he explained.<ref>{{harv|Kardish|1997|p=57}}</ref>\n\n====''Fox and His Friends'' (1975)====\nMany of Fassbinder's films deal with homosexuality, in keeping with his interest in characters who are social outsiders, but he drew away from most representations of homosexuals in films. In an interview at the 1975 [[Cannes Film Festival]], Fassbinder said about ''[[Fox and His Friends]]'': \"It is certainly the first film in which the characters are homosexuals, without homosexuality being made into a problem. In films, plays or novels, if homosexuals appear, the homosexuality was the problem, or it was a comic turn. But here homosexuality is shown as completely normal, and the problem is something quite different, it's a love story, where one person exploits the love of the other person, and that's the story I always tell\".<ref name=\"Thomsen\n181\">{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=181}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Fox and His Friends'' (''Faustrecht der Freiheit'', 1974) a sweet but unsophisticated working-class homosexual wins the lottery and falls in love with the elegant son of an industrialist. His lover tries to mold him into a gilt-edged mirror of upper-class values, all the while appropriating Fox's lottery winnings for his own ends. He ultimately destroys Fox's illusions, leaving him heartbroken and destitute.\n\nFassbinder worked within the limits of Hollywood melodrama, though the film is partially based on the plight of his then lover Armin Meier (to whom the film is dedicated). The film is notable for Fassbinder's performance as the unlucky Fox, in a self-directed starring role.\n\n''Fox and His Friends'' has been deemed homophobic by some and overly pessimistic by others.<ref name=\"Thomsen 182\">{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=182}}</ref> The film's homosexuals are not, surprisingly, any different from the film's equally lecherous heterosexuals. The film's pessimism is far outweighed by Fassbinder's indictment of Fox as an active participant in his own victimization, a familiar critique found in many of the director's films.\n\n====''Mother K\u00fcsters Goes to Heaven'' (1975)====\nIn ''[[Mother K\u00fcsters Goes to Heaven]]'' (''Mutter K\u00fcsters Fahrt zum Himmel''), a [[melodrama]], Emma K\u00fcsters becomes the center of media and political attention after her husband, a factory worker, killed his supervisor or his supervisor's son and then himself when lay offs were announced. The film drew on both Sirk's melodramas and Weimar-era workers' films, connecting the genres to tell a political coming-of-age story about Mother K\u00fcsters, who seeks to understand what led to her husband's actions and how to respond.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gerhardt |first=Christina |title=Fassbinder's Mothers K\u00fcsters Goes to Heaven in a Genealogy of the Arbeiterfilme |work=[[Film Criticism]] |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/f/fc/13761232.0041.109?view=text;rgn=main |date=28 June 2017 |accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref> The film is very critical of the era's politics and media, as the people to whom Emma K\u00fcsters turns all exploit her and her experience. The media, communists, anarchists and even her own family members all take advantage of Mother K\u00fcsters's tragedy to advance their own agendas.\n\n===='' Fear of Fear'' (1975)====\nMade for German television, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Angst vor der Angst|de|3=Angst vor der Angst|lt=Fear of Fear}}'' (''Angst vor der Angst'') is a physiological drama about a middle-class housewife, locked into a dull life with a distracted husband, two small children, and openly hostile in-laws. She becomes addicted to [[valium]] and alcohol overwhelmed by an irrational anxiety and fear of her inexorable descent into madness.\n\n''Fear of Fear'' is similar in theme to ''Martha'', which also portrays the effect of a dysfunctional marriage in an oppressed housewife, the central role was again played by [[Margit Carstensen]].\n\n====''I Only Want You to Love Me'' (1976)====\n''[[I Only Want You To Love Me]]'' (''Ich will doch nur, da\u00df ihr mich liebt'', 1976) tells the story of Peter, a construction worker in jail for manslaughter. His life is recounted in a series of flashbacks. A hard working man, Peter spends his spare time building a house for his cold unloving parents. He marries and finds a job in another city, but in his desperate yearning for affection he tries to buy the love of those around him with expensive gifts which soon makes him fall into a spiral of debt. When he sees his own unrequited love for his parents reflected during an argument in a bar, he kills a man who serves as a proxy for his father.\n\nThe film was made for television and shot during a pause while making ''Satan's Brew''. Based on a true account taken from ''For Life'', a book of interviews edited by Klaus Antes and Christiane Erhardt, it was Fassbinder's personal reflections on childhood and adolescence.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n====''Satan's Brew'' (1976)====\nIn a time of professional crisis, Fassbinder made ''[[Satan's Brew]]'' (''Satansbraten'', 1976) a bleak amoral comedy that pays homage to [[Antonin Artaud]]'s  [[theatre of cruelty]]. Stylistically far from the melodramas that made him known internationally, ''Satan's Brew'' gave way to a new phase in his career. In ''Satan's Brew'', a neurotic poet suffering from writer's block struggles to make ends meet while dealing with a frustrated long suffering wife, a half witted brother and various prostitutes and masochist women who drift in and out of his life. He convinces himself to be the reincarnation of the gay romantic poet [[Stefan George]] (1868\u20131933) after he plagiarizes his poem ''The Albatros''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brightlightsfilm.com/a-german-tragedy-turned-absurd-fassbinders-satans-brew/|title=A German Tragedy, Turned Absurd: Fassbinder's Satan's Brew|date=2010-02-01|website=Bright Lights Film Journal|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\n===International films (1976\u20131982)===\nEnthusiasm for Fassbinder's films grew quickly after ''Fear Eats the Soul''. [[Vincent Canby]] paid tribute to Fassbinder as \"the most original talent since Godard\". In 1977, the New Yorker Theater in Manhattan held a Fassbinder Festival.\n\nHowever, as enthusiasm for Fassbinder grew outside of Germany, his films still failed to impress the native audience. At home, he was better known for his television work and for his open homosexuality. Coupled with the controversial issues of his films \u2014 terrorism, [[state violence]], [[racism]], sexual politics \u2014 it seemed that everything Fassbinder did provoked or offended someone.\n\nAfter completing in 1978 his last low-budget and very personal ventures (''[[In a Year of 13 Moons]]'' and ''[[The Third Generation (1979 film)|The Third Generation]]'') he would concentrate on making films that were becoming increasingly garish and stylized. However, his TV series ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'' was a naturalistic adaptation of the two-volume novel by [[Alfred D\u00f6blin]], which Fassbinder had read many times.\n\n====''Chinese Roulette '' (1976)====\n''[[Chinese Roulette]]'' (''Chinesisches Roulette'') is a gothic thriller with an ensemble cast. The film follows a twelve-year-old crippled girl, Angela, who, due to her parents' lack of affection, arranges an encounter between them with their respective lovers at the family country estate. The film climaxes with a truth-guessing game. The players divide into two teams, which take it in turn to pick out one member of the other side and ask them question about people and objects. The game is played at the suggestion of Angela, who plays against her mother. When the mother asks: \"In the [[Third Reich]], what would that person have been?\", Angela's answer is \"Commandant of the [[concentration camp]] at [[Bergen Belsen]]\"; it is her mother she is describing.<ref name=\"Hayman, 142\">{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=142}}</ref>\n\n====''The Stationmaster's Wife'' (1977)====\nThere are no happy endings in Fassbinder's films. His protagonists, usually weak men or women with masochistic tendencies, pay a heavy price for their victimization. ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Bolwieser|de|3=Bolwieser|lt=The Stationmaster's Wife}}'' (''Bolwieser'') is based on a 1931 novel, ''Bolwieser: The Novel Of a Husband'' by the Bavarian writer [[Oskar Maria Graf]]. The plot follows the downfall of Xaver Bolwieser, a railway stationmaster submitted to the will of his domineering and unfaithful wife, whose repeated infidelities completely ruin Bolwieser's life. Broadcast initially as a two-part television series, ''The Stationmaster's Wife'' was shortened to a 112-minute feature film and released  in the first anniversary of Fassbinder's death. The film stars [[Kurt Raab]], Fassbinder's close friend whom the director usually cast as a pathetic man. Raab was also set designer of Fassbinder's films until their friendship and professional relationship broke up after making this film.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|pp=206\u2013207}}</ref>\n\n====''Germany in Autumn'' (1978)====\n''[[Germany in Autumn]]'' ''(Deutschland im Herbst)'' is an [[omnibus film]], a collective work of eight German filmmakers including Fassbinder, [[Alf Brustellin]], [[Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff]], [[Bernhard Sinkel]] and [[Alexander Kluge]], the main organizer behind the project. They took a look at the wave of guilt and paranoia that afflicted [[West Germany]]'s society and its authorities in the months between the kidnapping and murder of industrialist [[Hanns Martin Schleyer]] by [[Red Army Faction]] members and the deaths of [[Andreas Baader]], [[Gudrun Ensslin]] and [[Jan-Carl Raspe]] in [[Stammheim Prison]]. The film is a document about terrorism and its sociopolitical aftermath. It begins with Schleyer's wake, a segment filmed by Alexander Kluge and Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff, and it ends with the tumultuous joint funeral of Baader, Ensslin, and Raspe in Stuttgart.\n\n====''Despair'' (1978)====\nFassbinder made three films in [[English language|English]], a language in which he was not proficient: ''[[Despair (film)|Despair]]''  (1978), ''Lili Marleen'' (1980) and ''Querelle'' (1982). All three films have international actors and are very ambitious, yet each faced artistic and commercial problems.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=34}}</ref>\n''Despair'' is based upon the 1936 [[Despair (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Vladimir Nabokov]], adapted by [[Tom Stoppard]] and featuring [[Dirk Bogarde]]. It was made on a budget of 6,000,000 [[Deutsche Mark|DEM]], exceeding the total cost of Fassbinder's first fifteen films.\n\n''[[Despair (film)|Despair \u2013 A journey into the Light]]'' (''Despair \u2013 Eine Reise ins Licht'') tells the story of Hermann Hermann, an unbalanced Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 and chocolate magnate, whose business and marriage have both grown bitter. The factory is close to bankruptcy, and his vulgar wife is chronically unfaithful. He hatches an elaborate plot to take a new identity in the belief it will free him of all his worries. The story of Hermann's descent into madness is juxtaposed against the rise of [[National Socialism]] in the Germany of the 1930s.\n\n====''In a Year of Thirteen Moons'' (1978)====\n\n''[[In a Year of Thirteen Moons]]'' (''In einem Jahr mit 13 Monden'', 1978) is Fassbinder most personal and bleakest work. The film follows the tragic life of Elvira, a [[transsexual]] formerly known as Erwin. In the last few days before her suicide, she decides to visit some of the important people and places in her life. In one sequence, Elvira wanders through the slaughterhouse where she worked as Erwin, recounting her history amid the meat-hooked corpses of cattle whose slit throats rain blood onto the floor.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=257}}</ref> In another scene, Elvira returns to the orphanage where she was raised by [[nun]]s and hears the brutal story of her childhood. Fassbinder's camera tracks the nun (played by his mother) telling Elvira's story; she moves with a kind of military precision through the grounds, recounting the story in blazing detail, unaware that Elvira had collapsed and can no longer hear it.\n\n''In a Year of Thirteen Moons'' was explicitly personal, a reaction to his former lover Armin Meier's suicide.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=255}}</ref> In addition to writing, directing, and editing, Fassbinder also designed the production and worked as the cameraman. When the film played in the New York Film Festival in October 1979, critic [[Vincent Canby]] (who championed Fassbinder's work in the United States) wrote, \"Its only redeeming feature is genius.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C02E6D71438E432A2575BC0A9669D946890D6CF|title=In a Year of 13 Moons (1978) Film: Fassbinder's 'Year of 13 Moons': Unalterable Condition|last=Canby|first=Vincent|date=18 October 1979|newspaper=nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\n====''The Marriage of Maria Braun'' (1979)====\n\nWith ''[[The Marriage of Maria Braun]]'' (''Die Ehe der Maria Braun''), his greatest success, Fassbinder finally attained the popular acceptance he sought with German audiences. The title character is an ambitious and strong willed woman separated from her husband towards the end of World War II. The plot follows Maria Braun's steady rise as a successful business woman during the [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer]] era. Maria's dream of a happy life with her husband remains unfulfilled. Her professional achievements are not accompanied by personal happiness.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=209}}</ref> The film, constructed in the Hollywood tradition of \"women's pictures\" presenting a woman overcoming hardships, serves also as a parable of the West Germany economic miracle embodied in the character of Maria Braun. Her story of manipulation and betrayal parallels Germany's spectacular postwar economic recovery in terms of its cost in human values.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=243}}</ref>\n\nThe film was the first part of a trilogy centered on women during the post-war \"[[Wirtschaftswunder|economic miracle]]\" which was completed with ''[[Lola (1981 film)|Lola]]'' (1981) and ''[[Veronika Voss]]'' (1982).\n\n====''The Third Generation'' (1979)====\nThe economic success of ''The Marriage of Maria Braun'' allowed Fassbinder to pay his debts and to embark on a personal project, ''[[The Third Generation (1979 film)|The Third Generation]]'' (''Die Dritte Generation'', 1979), a black comedy about terrorism. Fassbinder found financial backing for this film difficult to acquire  and it was ultimately made on a small budget and borrowed money.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=164}}</ref> As he did  with ''In a Year of Thirteen Moons'', Fassbinder worked again as the film's cameraman.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=263}}</ref>\n\nThe film concerns a group of aspiring terrorists from leftist bourgeois backgrounds who kidnap an industrialist during carnival season unaware that they have been manipulated by the capitalist and the authorities whose hidden agenda is for terrorism to create a demand for security hardware and to gain support for harsher security measures. The actions of the ineffectual cell of underground terrorists are overlaid with a soundtrack filled with newscast, voiceovers, music and gibberish. The political theme of the film aroused controversy.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n====''Berlin Alexanderplatz'' (1980)====\nReturning to his explorations of German history, Fassbinder finally realized his dream of adapting [[Alfred D\u00f6blin]]'s 1929 novel ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]''. A [[Berlin Alexanderplatz (television)|television series]] running more than 13 hours, with a two-hour coda (released in the U.S. as a 15-hour feature), it was the culmination of the director's inter-related themes of love, life, and power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2008/01/17/the-genius-of-berlin/|title=The Genius of Berlin|last=Buruma|first=Ian|website=The New York Review of Books|date=January 17, 2008|accessdate=February 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n''Berlin Alexanderplatz'' centers on Franz Biberkopf, a former convict and minor pimp, who tries to stay out of trouble but is dragged down by crime, poverty and the duplicity of those around him. His best friend, Reinhold, makes him lose an arm and murders Franz' prostitute girlfriend, Mieze. The love triangle of Franz, Reinhold and Mieze is staged against the rising tide of Nazism in Germany. The film emphasized the sadomasochist relationship between Biberkopf and Reinhold  stressing its homoerotic nature. Fassbinder had read the book at age fourteen; later claiming that it helped him survive a \"murderous puberty\". The influence of D\u00f6blin's novel can be seen in many of Fassbinder's films most of whose protagonists are named Franz, some with the surname Biberkopf like the na\u00efve working class lottery winner in ''Fox and His Friends'', who is played by Fassbinder. He also took the pseudonym of Franz Walsch for his work as editor on his own films: Walsch was an oblique homage to director [[Raoul Walsh]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n====''Lili Marleen'' (1981)====\nFassbinder took on the [[Nazi]] period with ''[[Lili Marleen (film)|Lili Marleen]]'', an international co production, shot in English and with a large budget. The script was vaguely based on the autobiography of [[World War II]] singer [[Lale Andersen]], ''The Sky Has Many Colors''.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=215}}</ref> The film is constructed as a big, tear-jerking [[Hollywood]] [[melodrama]] in its depiction of the unfulfilled love story between a German variety singer separated by the war from a Swiss Jewish composer. Central to the story is the [[Lili Marleen|song]] that gives the film its title.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nFassbinder presents the period of the [[Third Reich]] as a predictable development of German history that was staged as spectacle supported by hate. Filmed with a morbid nostalgia for [[swastika]]s, showbiz glitz and as a cloak-and-dagger romance, the main theme of ''Lili Marleen'' is the question: is it morally justifiable to survive under National Socialism, as the na\u00efve singer does by having a successful career?<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=295}}</ref>\n\n====''Theater In Trance'' (1981)====\n\n''Theater In Trance'' is a documentary which Fassbinder shot in Cologne in June 1981 at the \"Theaters of the World\" Festival. Over scenes from groups such as the [[Squat Theatre]] and the [[Pina Bausch|Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch]] Fassbinder spoke passages from [[Antonin Artaud]] as well as his own commentary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kinowelt-international.de/detail_v3.php?lang=en&kid=009561_1_1&CID=b3e62c9a68f6952c56ed2b6eba5224cc|title=Theatre In Trance|publisher=kinowelt-international.de}}</ref>\n\n====''Lola'' (1981)====\n''[[Lola (1981 film)|Lola]]'' tells the story of an upright, new building commissioner who arrives in a small town. He falls in love with Lola, innocently unaware of the fact that she is a famed prostitute and the mistress of an unscrupulous developer. Unable to reconcile his idealistic image of Lola with reality, the commissioner spirals into the very corruption he had sought to fight out.\n\n====''Veronika Voss'' (1982)====\nFassbinder won the [[Golden Bear]] at the [[32nd Berlin International Film Festival]] for ''[[Veronika Voss]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1982/03_preistr_ger_1982/03_Preistraeger_1982.html|title=Prizes & Honours 1982|publisher=berlinale.de|language=German|accessdate=14 November 2010}}</ref> The original German title, ''Die Sehnsucht der Veronika Voss'', translates as \"The longing of Veronika Voss\". Set in the 1950s, the film depicts the twilight years of the title character, a faded Nazi starlet. A sports reporter becomes enthralled by the unbalanced actress and discovers that she is under the power of a villainous doctor who supplies her with the drugs she craves so long as she can pay the exorbitant fee. Despite the reporter's best attempts, he is unable to save her from a terrible end.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=221}}</ref>\n\n====''Querelle'' (1982)====\nFassbinder did not live to see the premiere of his last film, ''[[Querelle]]'', based on [[Jean Genet]]'s novel ''[[Querelle of Brest|Querelle de Brest]]''.<ref>{{harv|Watson|1996|p=256}}</ref> The plot follows the title character, a handsome sailor who is a thief and hustler. Frustrated in a homoerotic relationship with his own brother, Querelle betrays those who love him and pays them even with murder.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Ritrat ad Rainer Werner Fassbinder SW.svg|thumb|upright|[[Digital art]] depicting Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]\nFassbinder had [[Bisexuality|sexual relationships with both men and women]]. He rarely kept his professional and personal life separate, and was known to cast family, friends and lovers in his films. Early in his career he had a lasting but fractured relationship with [[Irm Hermann]], a former secretary whom he forced to become an actress.<ref>{{harv|Lorenz|Schmid|Gehr|1997|p=20}}</ref> Fassbinder usually cast her in unglamorous roles, most notably as the unfaithful wife in ''[[The Merchant of Four Seasons]]'' and the silent abused assistant in ''[[The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant]]''.\n\nIrm Hermann idolized him, but Fassbinder tormented and tortured her for over a decade.<ref name=\"Hayman 22\">{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=22}}</ref> This included [[domestic violence]]: \"He couldn't conceive of my refusing him, and he tried everything. He almost beat me to death on the streets of [[Bochum]]&nbsp;...\"<ref>{{harv|Baer|1986|p=65}}</ref> In 1977, Hermann became romantically involved with another man and became pregnant by him. Fassbinder proposed to her and offered to adopt the child; she turned him down.<ref>{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=24}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, while portraying the lead role in the TV film ''[[Baal (film)|Baal]]'' under the direction of [[Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff]], Fassbinder met [[G\u00fcnther Kaufmann]], a black Bavarian actor who had a minor role in the film. Despite the fact that Kaufmann was married and had two children, Fassbinder fell madly in love with him. The two began a turbulent affair which ultimately affected the production of ''Baal''. Fassbinder tried to buy Kaufmann's love by casting him in major roles in his films and buying him expensive gifts.<ref>{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=62}}</ref>\n\nKaufmann relished the attention and became more demanding. Fassbinder bought him four [[Lamborghini]]s over the period of a year; Kauffmann wrecked one and sold the others if they failed to meet his expectations.<ref>{{harv|Katz|1987|p=46}}</ref> The relationship came to an end when Kaufmann became romantically involved with composer [[Peer Raben]]. After the end of their relationship, Fassbinder continued to cast Kaufmann in his films, albeit in minor roles.<ref name=\"Watson 94\">{{harv|Watson|1996|p=94}}</ref> Kaufmann appeared in fourteen of Fassbinder's films, with the lead role in ''[[Whity (film)|Whity]]'' (1971).\n\nAlthough he claimed to be opposed to matrimony as an institution, in 1970 Fassbinder married [[Ingrid Caven]], an actress who regularly appeared in his films. Their wedding reception was recycled in the film he was making at that time, ''The American Soldier''.<ref>{{harv|Lorenz|Schmid|Gehr|1997|pp=243\u2013244}}</ref> Their relationship of mutual admiration survived the complete failure of their two-year marriage. \"Ours was a love story in spite of the marriage\", Caven explained in an interview, adding about her former husband's [[sexual orientation|sexuality]]: \"Rainer was a homosexual who also needed a woman. It's that simple and that complex.\"<ref>{{harv|Lorenz|Schmid|Gehr|1997|p=45}}</ref> The three most important women of Fassbinder's life, [[Irm Hermann]], Ingrid Caven and [[Juliane Lorenz]], his last partner, were not disturbed by his homosexuality.<ref>{{harv|Lorenz|Schmid|Gehr|1997|pp=245\u2013246}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Fassbinder began a relationship with [[El Hedi ben Salem]], a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[Berber people|Berber]] who had left his wife and five children the previous year, after meeting him at a [[gay bathhouse]] in Paris.<ref name=\"Watson 94\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/reviews/my-name-is-not-ali-1117948182/|title=My Name Is Not Ali|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|date=3 September 2012|publisher=variety.com|accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref> Over the next three years, Salem appeared in several Fassbinder productions. His best-known role was as Ali in ''[[Ali: Fear Eats the Soul]]'' (1974). Their three-year relationship was punctuated with jealousy, violence and heavy drug and alcohol use. Fassbinder finally ended the relationship in 1974, due to Salem's chronic alcoholism and tendency to become violent when he drank. Shortly after the breakup, Salem stabbed three people (none fatally) in Berlin and had to be smuggled out of Berlin.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=19}}</ref> Salem eventually made his way to France where he was arrested and imprisoned.

Meier was a near-illiterate former butcher who had spent his early years in an orphanage.<ref>{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=682}}</ref> He also appeared in several Fassbinder films in this period. A glimpse into their troubled relationship can be seen in Fassbinder's episode for ''Germany in Autumn'' (1978).<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=20}}</ref> Fassbinder ended the relationship in April 1978. During the week of Fassbinder's birthday (31 May), Meier deliberately consumed four bottles of sleeping pills and alcohol in the kitchen of the apartment he and Fassbinder had previously shared. His body was found a week later.<ref>{{harv|Silverman|1992|p=214}}</ref>\n\nIn the last four years of his life, his companion was Juliane Lorenz (born 1957), the editor of his films during the last years of his life.

The play is about an unscrupulous and very greedy [[Jewish]] businessman in Frankfurt who ruthlessly uses German guilt over [[the Holocaust]] to make himself rich. Though published at the time, and quickly withdrawn, the play was not performed until five years after Fassbinder's death by Thieves Theatre in 1987 at [[ABC No Rio]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13521502.html |title=Der reiche Jude in Manhattan |first=Rainer |last=Weber |date=6 April 1987 |volume=15 |via=Spiegel Online}}</ref> In the turmoil, Fassbinder resigned from his directorship of that prestigious theater complex, complaining that the play had been misinterpreted.<ref name=\"Watson 25\"/><ref name=\"Watson 25\"/>\n\n==Death==\nBy the time he made his last film, ''[[Querelle]]'' (1982), Fassbinder was using drugs and alcohol as a way to cope with his unrelenting schedule.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} On the night of 9\u201310 June 1982, [[Wolf Gremm]], director of the film ''[[Kamikaze 1989]]'' (1982), which starred Fassbinder, was staying in his apartment.<ref name=\"Hayman 135\">{{harv|Hayman|1984|p=135}}</ref> Early that evening, Fassbinder retired to his bedroom.

Greene, Ilaiyaraaja's \"deep understanding of so many different styles of music allowed him to create syncretic pieces of music combining very different musical idioms in unified, coherent musical statements\".<ref name=\"filmmusicsouthernareap.544\" /> Ilaiyaraaja has composed Indian film songs that amalgamated elements of [[genre]]s such as Afro-tribal, [[bossa nova]], [[dance music]] (e.g., [[disco]]), [[doo-wop]], [[flamenco]], [[steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]]-propelled [[Contemporary folk music|Western folk]], [[funk]], [[Indian classical music|Indian classical]], [[Indian folk music|Indian folk/traditional]], [[jazz]], [[American march music#Musicality and the march music form|march]], [[pathos]], [[pop music|pop]], [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]] and [[rock and roll]].\n\nBy virtue of this variety and his intermingling of Western, Indian folk and [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] elements, Ilaiyaraaja's compositions appeal to the Indian rural dweller for its [[rhythm]]ic folk qualities, the Indian classical music enthusiast for the employment of Carnatic ''[[Raga]]s'', and the urbanite for its modern, Western-music sound.<ref>Greene, P.D. 1997.

Volume V: South Asia&nbsp;\u2014 The Indian Subcontinent''. New York: Garland Pub. (p. 545).</ref> Ilaiyaraaja's sense of visualization for composing music is always to match up with the story line of the running movie and possibly by doing so, he creates the best experience for the audience to feel the emotions flavored through his musical score.

He uses electronic music technology that integrates [[synthesizer]]s, electric guitars and [[Electronic keyboard|keyboards]], drum machines, rhythm boxes and [[MIDI]] with large orchestras that feature traditional instruments such as the ''[[veena]]'', ''[[venu]]'', ''[[nadaswaram]]'', ''[[dholak]]'', ''[[mridangam]]'' and ''[[tabla]]'' as well as Western lead instruments such as saxophones and flutes.<ref name=\"filmmusicsouthernareap.544\" />\n\nThe [[bassline]]s in his songs tend to be melodically dynamic, rising and falling in a dramatic fashion. [[Polyrhythm]]s are also apparent, particularly in songs with Indian folk or Carnatic influences.

Greene, Ilaiyaraaja's \"deep understanding of so many different styles of music allowed him to create syncretic pieces of music combining very different musical idioms in unified, coherent musical statements\".<ref name=\"filmmusicsouthernareap.544\" /> Ilaiyaraaja has composed Indian film songs that amalgamated elements of [[genre]]s such as Afro-tribal, [[bossa nova]], [[dance music]] (e.g., [[disco]]), [[doo-wop]], [[flamenco]], [[steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]]-propelled [[Contemporary folk music|Western folk]], [[funk]], [[Indian classical music|Indian classical]], [[Indian folk music|Indian folk/traditional]], [[jazz]], [[American march music#Musicality and the march music form|march]], [[pathos]], [[pop music|pop]], [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]] and [[rock and roll]].\n\nBy virtue of this variety and his intermingling of Western, Indian folk and [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] elements, Ilaiyaraaja's compositions appeal to the Indian rural dweller for its [[rhythm]]ic folk qualities, the Indian classical music enthusiast for the employment of Carnatic ''[[Raga]]s'', and the urbanite for its modern, Western-music sound.<ref>Greene, P.D. 1997.

Volume V: South Asia&nbsp;\u2014 The Indian Subcontinent''. New York: Garland Pub. (p. 545).</ref> Ilaiyaraaja's sense of visualization for composing music is always to match up with the story line of the running movie and possibly by doing so, he creates the best experience for the audience to feel the emotions flavored through his musical score.

He uses electronic music technology that integrates [[synthesizer]]s, electric guitars and [[Electronic keyboard|keyboards]], drum machines, rhythm boxes and [[MIDI]] with large orchestras that feature traditional instruments such as the ''[[veena]]'', ''[[venu]]'', ''[[nadaswaram]]'', ''[[dholak]]'', ''[[mridangam]]'' and ''[[tabla]]'' as well as Western lead instruments such as saxophones and flutes.<ref name=\"filmmusicsouthernareap.544\" />\n\nThe [[bassline]]s in his songs tend to be melodically dynamic, rising and falling in a dramatic fashion. [[Polyrhythm]]s are also apparent, particularly in songs with Indian folk or Carnatic influences.
