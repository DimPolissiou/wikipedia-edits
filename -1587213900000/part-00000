On Ground 5A, the \u2019section 3 proportionality ground\u2019, section 3 of the PFCR, which prohibits the use of facial coverings, disproportionately restricts privacy, and freedom of expression and assembly; on Ground 5B, the \u2018section 5 proportionality ground\u2019, section 5, concerning enforcement powers, is also disproportionate.\n\n=== Ground 1: the delegation of legislative power ground ===\n\nThe applicants submitted that under the Basic Law, legislative power is exclusively vested in the Legislative Council; since the ERO would grant legislative power to the executive, it is inconsistent with the Basic Law.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=35}}</ref> The government submitted that there is \u2018nothing in the Basic Law which provides whether expressly or by implication that the LegCo cannot authorise the CEIC [Chief Executive in Council] to make regulations during an occasion of public danger or emergency\u2019, that the ERO had already twice been held to be valid, that regulations made thereunder were not intended to be permanent, and that the LegCo could apply negative vetting to such regulations.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=36}}</ref>\n\nThe court declined to rule on the question of the constitutionality of the making of regulations by the Chief Executive in Council on an occasion of an emergency, and solely considered that concerning public danger.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=37}}</ref> The court accepted that a distinction between \u2018general legislative power\u2019 and the power to make \u2018subordinate legislation\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=53}}</ref> It drew such a distinction on the basis that the LegCo is \u2018designated as ''the'' legislature\u2019{{efn|Emphasis the court\u2019s.}} and that in the Chinese text of the Basic Law gives the LegCo \u2018''functions'' which in Chinese is \u201c\u8077\u201d in the phrase \u201c\u8077\u6b0a\u201d\u2019, which \u2018connotes\u2026[a] \u2019job\u2019\u201d.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=52}}</ref> The court then determined that the character of the powers granted by the ERO was more akin to that of a general legislative power than a subsidiary one, for several reasons.

section 5 would apply extremely broadly, \u2018irrespective of whether there is any public emeting or procession taking place in the vicinity\u2019, and regardless of the risk of violence, section 5 could \u2018be used by a police officer for the random stoppage of anyone found wearing a facial covering in any public place\u2019, which \u2019exceeds what is reasonably necessary to achieve the aim

did not grant the Chief Executive power to make regulations on an occasion of public danger, and that all the substantive sections of the PFCR except for the prohibition on wearing a mask at an unlawful assembly were invalid in virtue of their disproportionality.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=4}}</ref>\n\n==== Suspension or temporary validity order ====\n\nHowever, the government sought an order by which the PFCR, and therefore the provisions of the ERO in use of the powers granted by which the PFCR was purported to be made should remain \u2018valid and of legal effect\u2019 pending a further appeal.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=5}}</ref> Such an order was sought on the grounds that the quashing of the PFCR would endanger public safety and the rule of law; the court was of the view, however, that those most likely to be involved in violent

validity.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=24}}</ref> The court was of the view that the continued enforcement of the PFCR would likely cause more conflict, and therefore declined to make such a suspension order on the grounds the government sought.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong

unconstitutional, and therefore declared the PFCR invalid and of no effect.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=42}}</ref> On separate grounds it also declared all the substantive sections of the PFCR excepting that prohibiting the use of masks at an unlawful assembly inconsistent with the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights, and therefore of no effect.\n\nNotwithstanding its deliberations above, the court in view of a likely appeal to the Court of Appeal granted a temporary suspension order of seven days.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong

upheld the Court of First Instance\u2019s ruling on the disproportionality of the PFCR in public meetings and processions permitted by the Commissioner of Police as well as on the powers granted to police to require persons to remove face coverings, but quashed its ruling and therefore upheld the PFCR at unauthorised assemblies.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong

the CFI concerning the criteria by which the constitutionality of the ERO on an occasion of public danger should be determined.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=51}}</ref> If the ERO were to delegate power to make primary legislation, it would be unconstitutional, but if it were to delegate subordinate legislation, it would be constitutional.\n\nAlthough, as the CFI noted, \u2018public danger\u2019 is not defined by the ERO,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=131}}</ref> the court was of the view that \u2018there is nothing objectionable in itself to task the CEIC [Chief Executive in Council] to determine if an occasion of public danger exists\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=132}}</ref> Since \u2018emergency or public danger is not capable of exhaustive definition\u2019, legislation in that connection is \u2018necessarily wide and extensive in scope\u2019,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=126}}</ref> and so the broadness of the ERO was not sufficient to rule it unconstitutional.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=128}}</ref> Further objections considered the norms established by the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 1.) vis \u00e0 vis subordinate legislation: the CFI were of the view that the ERO envisaged regulations beyond the scope of the norms established by the IGCO, and therefore that the ERO would allow the enactment of primary legislation by the Chief Executive,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=144}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=146}}</ref> but the court held that the IGCO was disapplied by implication.\n\nIn view of the above, the court rejected the application for judicial review on Ground 1.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=155}}</ref>\n\n=== Grounds 5A and 5B ===\n\n==== Section 3(1)(b): unauthorised assembly ====\n\nWhereas the CFI held that \u2018an assembly which is \u201cunauthorized\u201d may yet be entirely peaceful\u2019,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=154}}</ref> the Court objected to the CFI\u2019s decision that section 3(1)(b), which prohibits the wearing of masks at such assemblies, would be disproportionate. First, the court reconsidered the nature of the definition of an unauthorised assembly as defined by the [[Public Order Ordinance|POO]]. The first scenario in which an assembly would be unauthorised would be a procession or meeting in contravention of a requirement that the Commissioner of Police should be notified and indicate no objection thereto.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=188}}</ref> The construction of the POO must be \u2018compatible with the fundamental right of demonstration and procession\u2019, and therefore in line with \u2018the principle of tolerance and proportionality\u2019\u2014in other words, \u2018there should be prior warnings\u2019 before \u2018arrests and disperals\u2019 etc. occur, unless there is a \u2018seriuos and imminent threat risk to public order and safety\u2019 due to violence or other \u2018reprehensible conducts[sic]\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=193}}</ref> Second, such a gathering could fail to obey an order by the Commissioner of Police.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=188}}</ref> A gathering would be unlikely to solely fall under this provision, since an un-notified and un-notifiable gathering of this sort would likely not be one at which the Commissioner would be present, so the former analysis applies; moreover even if it were not to, \u2018the principle of tolerance and requirement of proportionality\u2019 also hold.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=194}}</ref> The third scenario is that some direction is given to disperse or vary the route or place etc. of a gathering under section 17(2) or (3) of the POO.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=188}}</ref> Again, the principle of tolerance and proportionality holds.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=200}}</ref> Therefore, at all unauthorised assemblies, either some sort of violent conduct has occurred, or the police have publicly issued a warning and order under section 17(3) of the POO.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=200}}</ref> Moreover a person must be aware of the order to refuse or willfully neglect to obey it,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=201}}</ref> and cannot knowingly take part in an unauthorised assembly unless aware that it was unauthorised.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=202}}</ref> The court therefore held that the CFI had envisaged a highly improbable scenario in deciding that the prohibition on the wearing of masks at an entirely orderly assembly was implied by section 3(1)(b) of the PFCR.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=217}}</ref>\n\nThe court summarised its reasoning in 12 steps.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=238}}</ref>\n# The PFCR is enacted in exercise of the powers granted to the Chief Executive under the ERO in response to a public danger arising from the [[2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests]], and its repeal would be \u2018expected\u2019 on the subsiding of that danger.\n# The wearing of masks contributes to that pbulic danger.\n# Section 3(1)(b) prohibits facial coverings only at unauthorised assemblies. It does not prevent the wearing of masks at authorised gatherings held in compliance with conditions imposed by the police.\n# The wearing of facial coverings is, however, only prohibited when a person ''remains'' at an unauthorised assembly after an order is made to disperse, or if violent conduct were to occur threatening public safety. \n# Section 4 provides a defence on the basis of a \u2018reasonable excuse\u2019, e.g., that there was no \u2018reasonable opportunity to leave the scene.\u2019\n# Refusal to disperse is itself an unlawful act.\n# Even if those refusing to disperse do so in exercise of a right to peaceful demonstration, facial coverings are not \u2018at the core of such right[sic]\u2019.\n# An order to disperse would only be made where refusal to disperse would create a risk of a brech of the peace, especially in view of \u2018black block tactics\u2019.\n# Wearing of facial coverings impedes law enforcement by preventing identification and segregation of violent protesters. \n# It also endangers the right of peaceful demonstration by precluding certain less intrusive police action.\n# Therefore, the maintenance of law and order itself is necessary to preserve the right of assembly.\n# Therefore, safeguards both from common law principles outlined above and the judiciary should \u2018prevent arbitrariness in the exercise of discretion by the police\u2019.\n\nIn conclusion, it held that the prohibition on the use of masks at unauthorised assemblies is constitutional.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong

On Ground 2, the \u2018implied repeal ground\u2019 the ERO was repealed by implication by the [[Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance]] and/or the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) as applied in Hong Kong by the Basic Law. On Ground 3, the ERO cannot empower the Chief Executive to make any regulation restricting fundamental rights under the Basic Law or Bill of Rights. On Ground 4, the \u2018principle of legality ground\u2019, the Chief Executive acted ''ultra vires'' in that the ERO only applies to emergency situations. On Ground 5A, the \u2019section 3 proportionality ground\u2019, section 3 of the PFCR, which prohibits the use of facial coverings, disproportionately restricts privacy, and freedom of expression and assembly; on Ground 5B, the \u2018section 5 proportionality ground\u2019, section 5, concerning enforcement powers, is also disproportionate.\n\n=== Ground 1: the delegation of legislative power ground ===\n\nThe applicants submitted that under the Basic Law, legislative power is exclusively vested in the Legislative Council; since the ERO would grant legislative power to the executive, it is inconsistent with the Basic Law.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=35}}</ref> The government submitted that there is \u2018nothing in the Basic Law which provides whether expressly or by implication that the LegCo cannot authorise the CEIC [Chief Executive in Council] to make regulations during an occasion of public danger or emergency\u2019, that the ERO had already twice been held to be valid, that regulations made thereunder were not intended to be permanent, and that the LegCo could apply negative vetting to such regulations.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=36}}</ref>\n\nThe court declined to rule on the question of the constitutionality of the making of regulations by the Chief Executive in Council on an occasion of an emergency, and solely considered that concerning public danger.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=37}}</ref> The court accepted that a distinction between \u2018general legislative power\u2019 and the power to make \u2018subordinate legislation\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=53}}</ref> It drew such a distinction on the basis that the LegCo is \u2018designated as ''the'' legislature\u2019{{efn|Emphasis the court\u2019s.}} and that in the Chinese text of the Basic Law gives the LegCo \u2018''functions'' which in Chinese is \u201c\u8077\u201d in the phrase \u201c\u8077\u6b0a\u201d\u2019, which \u2018connotes\u2026[a] \u2019job\u2019\u201d.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=52}}</ref> The court then determined that the character of the powers granted by the ERO was more akin to that of a general legislative power than a subsidiary one, for several reasons. First, the powers granted by the ERO seemed not so much to \u2019leav[e] another body to devise the detailed legal norms that elaborate or put flesh on the broad matters laid down in the primary legislation\u2019 so much as to allow general legislation\u2014thus this very regulation was the first enactment to concern face covering in Hong Kong.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=56}}</ref> Second, the phrase \u2018any regulations whatsoever\u2019 grants powers \u2018of the widest possible nature\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=57}}</ref> Third, \u2018public danger\u2019 is inadequately defined.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=60}}</ref> Fourth, the ERO grants the Chief Executive power to amend or suspend any other enactment.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=63}}</ref> Fifth, the ERO permits the Chief Executive to prescribe punishments up to life imprisonment, ''inter alia'', which exceed those envisaged by the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 1) vis \u00e0 vis subsidiary legislation.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong ordinance|1|28|1|e}}</ref> Sixth, no time limit is envisaged by the ERO.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=68}}</ref> Seventh, negative vetting is an inadequate safeguard given, ''inter alia'', that its operation could be suspended by a regulation under the ERO, and that the legal effects of its application before repeal by the Legislative Council would not be undone even if negative vetting were possible.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=74}}</ref> \n\nOn the fourth ground, the government submitted that such clauses are entirely permissible in other common law jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and Australia;<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=65}}</ref> however, the court rejected the applicability of such a [[Diceyan]] notion of absolute parliamentary sovereignty in Hong Kong, on the basis that the Legislative Council\u2019s powers are derived from the Basic Law.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=66}}</ref> Ultimately the court concluded that the ERO in allowing for the making of regulations by the Chief Executive at a time of \u2018public danger\u2019 did so sufficiently broadly that it \u2018seems\u2026to create in Hong Kong a separate source of laws that are primary legislation in all but name\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=80}}</ref>\n\nThe government further submitted that the ERO had been vetted for constitutionality before the handover as a \u2018factor in favour of validity\u2019; however, the court held that article 160 of the Basic Law provided for the subsequent discovery of unconstitutionality.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=94}}</ref> The court therefore held the PFCR unconstitutional under ground 1, at least insofar as \u2018public danger\u2019 is concerned.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=97}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=60}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=193}}</ref>\n\n=== Ground 2: the \u2018implied repeal ground\u2019 ===\n\nThe applicants submitted that legislation could only derogate from the Bill of Rights when \u2018the life of the nation\u2019 is at risk, but that the ERO allowed for such derogations in a larger set of circumstances, and therefore was repealed by implication.{{efn|For brevity, the full argument is omitted;

al.|pinpoint=178}}</ref> and was rationally connected to that aim.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=184}}</ref> However, because section 5 would apply extremely broadly, \u2018irrespective of whether there is any public emeting or procession taking place in the vicinity\u2019, and regardless of the risk of violence, section 5 could \u2018be used by a police officer for the random stoppage of anyone found wearing a facial covering in any public place\u2019, which \u2019exceeds what is reasonably necessary to achieve the aim of law enforcement\u2019 etc.,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=189}}</ref> and so is disproportionate.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=191}}</ref>\n\n=== Relief order ===\n\nIn its judgement dated 18 November 2019, the court noted that it had \u2018not heard submissions on the question of relief\u2019;<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=194}}</ref> it therefore made a decision on 22 November.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.}}</ref>\n\nIt was common ground that the PFCR should be declared invalid on the basis that the ERO did not grant the Chief Executive power to make regulations on an occasion of public danger, and that all the substantive sections of the PFCR except for the prohibition on wearing a mask at an unlawful assembly were invalid in virtue of their disproportionality.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=4}}</ref>\n\n==== Suspension or temporary validity order ====\n\nHowever, the government sought an order by which the PFCR, and therefore the provisions of the ERO in use of the powers granted by which the PFCR was purported to be made should remain \u2018valid and of legal effect\u2019 pending a further appeal.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=5}}</ref> Such an order was sought on the grounds that the quashing of the PFCR would endanger public safety and the rule of law; the court was of the view, however, that those most likely to be involved in violent acts would act regardless of the validity of the PFCR,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=17}}</ref> and that the court had already emphasised the importance of the rule of law.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=20}}</ref> To the latter, they added that they were unable to accept that they should make such an order purely because of the risk that to fail to do so could be perceived incorrectly by some.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=20}}</ref>\n\nThe government, however, alternatively sought a \u2018suspension order\u2019, whose effect would be ensure that the government would not \u2019openly [act] against a court\u2019s declaration\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=23}}</ref> It differs from the \u2018temporary validity order\u2019 sought above in that it would not ultimately render actions taken under impugned enactments of legal validity.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=24}}</ref> The court was of the view that the continued enforcement of the PFCR would likely cause more conflict, and therefore declined to make such a suspension order on the grounds the government sought.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=35}}</ref> \n\n==== Disposition ====\n\nThe court held the ERO, insofar as \u2018public danger\u2019 is concerned, unconstitutional, and therefore declared the PFCR invalid and of no effect.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=42}}</ref> On separate grounds it also declared all the substantive sections of the PFCR excepting that prohibiting the use of masks at an unlawful assembly inconsistent with the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights, and therefore of no effect.\n\nNotwithstanding its deliberations above, the court in view of a likely appeal to the Court of Appeal granted a temporary suspension order of seven days.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=38}}</ref>\n\n==Court of Appeal case==\n\nThe government gave notice of its intention to appeal on 25 November 2020.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=7}}</ref> On 9 April 2020, the court ruled that the ERO, insofar as occasions of public danger are concerned, is valid, and therefore that the PFCR is valid and of legal effect.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=353}}</ref> It upheld the Court of First Instance\u2019s ruling on the disproportionality of the PFCR in public meetings and processions permitted by the Commissioner of Police as well as on the powers granted to police to require persons to remove face coverings, but quashed its ruling and therefore upheld the PFCR at unauthorised assemblies.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=355}}</ref>\n\n=== Ground 1: general or subordinate legislative power? ===\n\nThe court accepted the initial reasoning of the CFI concerning the criteria by which the constitutionality of the ERO on an occasion of public danger should be determined.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=51}}</ref> If the ERO were to delegate power to make primary legislation, it would be unconstitutional, but if it were to delegate subordinate legislation, it would be constitutional.\n\nAlthough, as the CFI noted, \u2018public danger\u2019 is not defined by the ERO,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=131}}</ref> the court was of the view that \u2018there is nothing objectionable in itself to task the CEIC [Chief Executive in Council] to determine if an occasion of public danger exists\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=132}}</ref> Since \u2018emergency or public danger is not capable of exhaustive definition\u2019, legislation in that connection is \u2018necessarily wide and extensive in scope\u2019,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=126}}</ref> and so the broadness of the ERO was not sufficient to rule it unconstitutional.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=128}}</ref> Further objections considered the norms established by the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 1.) vis \u00e0 vis subordinate legislation: the CFI were of the view that the ERO envisaged regulations beyond the scope of the norms established by the IGCO, and therefore that the ERO would allow the enactment of primary legislation by the Chief Executive,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=144}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=146}}</ref> but the court held that the IGCO was disapplied by implication.\n\nIn view of the above, the court rejected the application for judicial review on Ground 1.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=155}}</ref>\n\n=== Grounds 5A and 5B ===\n\n==== Section 3(1)(b): unauthorised assembly ====\n\nWhereas the CFI held that \u2018an assembly which is \u201cunauthorized\u201d may yet be entirely peaceful\u2019,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=154}}</ref> the Court objected to the CFI\u2019s decision that section 3(1)(b), which prohibits the wearing of masks at such assemblies, would be disproportionate. First, the court reconsidered the nature of the definition of an unauthorised assembly as defined by the [[Public Order Ordinance|POO]]. The first scenario in which an assembly would be unauthorised would be a procession or meeting in contravention of a requirement that the Commissioner of Police should be notified and indicate no objection thereto.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=188}}</ref> The construction of the POO must be \u2018compatible with the fundamental right of demonstration and procession\u2019, and therefore in line with \u2018the principle of tolerance and proportionality\u2019\u2014in other words, \u2018there should be prior warnings\u2019 before \u2018arrests and disperals\u2019 etc. occur, unless there is a \u2018seriuos and imminent threat risk to public order and safety\u2019 due to violence or other \u2018reprehensible conducts[sic]\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=193}}</ref> Second, such a gathering could fail to obey an order by the Commissioner of Police.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=188}}</ref> A gathering would be unlikely to solely fall under this provision, since an un-notified and un-notifiable gathering of this sort would likely not be one at which the Commissioner would be present, so the former analysis applies; moreover even if it were not to, \u2018the principle of tolerance and requirement of proportionality\u2019 also hold.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=194}}</ref> The third scenario is that some direction is given to disperse or vary the route or place etc. of a gathering under section 17(2) or (3) of the POO.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=188}}</ref> Again, the principle of tolerance and proportionality holds.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=200}}</ref> Therefore, at all unauthorised assemblies, either some sort of violent conduct has occurred, or the police have publicly issued a warning and order under section 17(3) of the POO.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=200}}</ref> Moreover a person must be aware of the order to refuse or willfully neglect to obey it,<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=201}}</ref> and cannot knowingly take part in an unauthorised assembly unless aware that it was unauthorised.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=127376|list=HKCA|number=192|year=2020|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=202}}</ref> The court therefore held that the CFI had envisaged a highly improbable scenario in deciding that the prohibition on the wearing of masks at an entirely orderly assembly was implied by section 3(1)(b) of the PFCR.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=217}}</ref>\n\nThe court summarised its reasoning in 12 steps.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=238}}</ref>\n# The PFCR is enacted in exercise of the powers granted to the Chief Executive under the ERO in response to a public danger arising from the [[2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests]], and its repeal would be \u2018expected\u2019 on the subsiding of that danger.\n# The wearing of masks contributes to that pbulic danger.\n# Section 3(1)(b) prohibits facial coverings only at unauthorised assemblies. It does not prevent the wearing of masks at authorised gatherings held in compliance with conditions imposed by the police.\n# The wearing of facial coverings is, however, only prohibited when a person ''remains'' at an unauthorised assembly after an order is made to disperse, or if violent conduct were to occur threatening public safety. \n# Section 4 provides a defence on the basis of a \u2018reasonable excuse\u2019, e.g., that there was no \u2018reasonable opportunity to leave the scene.\u2019\n# Refusal to disperse is itself an unlawful act.\n# Even if those refusing to disperse do so in exercise of a right to peaceful demonstration, facial coverings are not \u2018at the core of such right[sic]\u2019.\n# An order to disperse would only be made where refusal to disperse would create a risk of a brech of the peace, especially in view of \u2018black block tactics\u2019.\n# Wearing of facial coverings impedes law enforcement by preventing identification and segregation of of violent protesters. \n# It also endangers the right of peaceful demonstration by precluding certain less intrusive police action.\n# Therefore, the maintenance of law and order itself is necessary to preserve the right of assembly.\n# Therefore, safeguards both from common law principles outlined above and the judiciary should \u2018prevent arbitrariness in the exercise of discretion by the police\u2019.\n\nIn conclusion, it held that the prohibition on the use of masks at unauthorised assemblies is constitutional.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125574|list=HKCFI|number=2884|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=241}}</ref>\n\n=== Sections 3(1)(c) and (d) and section 5: authorised assemblies and meetings, and power to remove masks ===\n\nThe court was of the view that the prohibition of the use of masks at \u2018peaceful and orderly\u2019 events \u2018is difficult to see\u2019;<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong
