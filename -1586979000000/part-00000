The series had a rotating cast, with only a small number of cast members appearing throughout the series' run. The only three cast members to appear in every series were [[Caroline Lee-Johnson]], [[Trevor Byfield]] and [[Steve Toussaint]]. The series also adopted a number of different formats: while the early series interspersed various storylines and had running plots across the series; later series adopted a multi-part format resulting in two or three cases per series; while the final series adopted a stand-alone week by-week format.\n\nThe series was axed in 2001 following poor viewing figures for the final series. This was blamed on the loss of several main cast members, a change in the format and the overall look of the series which changed dramatically following an overhaul by ITV executives in 1999.<ref>http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/27-april-2001/846.issue</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main cast===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10%;\"| Character\n! colspan=5| Series\n|-\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Series 1\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Series 2\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Series 3\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Series 4\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Series 5\n|-\n!

Customs and Excise are overwhelmed when they are forced to deal with five concurrent cases. Firstly, Bill and the team organise a raid on an importer who is smuggling Heroin in from Jamaica via the postal service, but the suspect becomes less than co-operative when he tries to hide the evidence by swallowing it, causing him to have a severe reaction. Meanwhile, Diane and Eddie are on the trail of an illegal byplane seen landing in a small village outside Norfolk. They suspect it may have links to a smuggling ring, but a stake out proves to be less than fruitful. Bill is contacted by an old friend from Dutch customs, who are on the trail of another drug dealer, who is using an English courier to ferry his goods across the channel. They decide to fake an accident in order to lure the guilty parties into a honeytrap. Meanwhile, Gerry and Nicki go in search of a missing trader of rare antiques, only to stumble upon a collection of illegally imported coins, supposedly meant for wealthy conman George Webster. Back at the airport, Diane, Kevin and Eddie trail a Colombian woman and her associate who have taken drastic measures to resolve her dead husband's debt to a violent Colombian gang.\n |LineColor=87319F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber= 2\n |Title= Love and Respect\n |Aux1= Anita Bronson\n |Aux2= Keith Washington\n |Aux3= \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1994|4|17|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary= Bill suspects that Peter Crediton, a respected family man, is importing child pornography from Thailand. When the team track a videotape sent to Crediton, they raid his house and find an attic dedicated to illegal material - but Crediton refuses to talk, exercising his right to silence. Meanwhile, Gerry and Nicki interview George Webster in the presence of his solicitor. Webster denies that the recovered coins have been illegally imported and claims that they belonged to his late mother. Webster then tries to bribe Gerry with tickets to the Arsenal game, but Gerry refuses; however George later sends him the tickets in the post, which he and Eddie use to attend the sold-out game. Webster then takes the bribery a step further by offering Gerry \u00a31,500 to make the investigation into his activities disappear, which Gerry accepts. Meanwhile, Diane is pleased when the plane is identified by French police as belonging to a suspect that the French authorities believe is involved in the production of drugs. A late night stakeout places the team right in the thick of the action as the courier flies in to make another drop on English soil. Andreotti continues his pursuit of his hairdresser, unaware that she has a boyfriend.\n |LineColor=87319F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber= 3\n |Title= Trouble in Chinatown\n |Aux1= Anita Bronson\n |Aux2= Keith Washington\n |Aux3= \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1994|4|24|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary= The search of Peter Crediton's house continues, but Bill is shocked to discover a videotape which implicates his wife in the abuse of their own children. The discovery leads Crediton to reveal the other three members of the paedophile ring involved in the illegal abuse in Thailand. Meanwhile, Gerry submits his report which suggests that the team drop the case against Webster, but Nicki isn't convinced of Gerry's findings and questions his motives. At Heathrow, a courier carrying a cargo of heroin in a video camera from Hong Kong is forced to leave his load behind after being approached by customs. The case goes unsolved until Bill and the team take up the case of Billy Cheung, who is found murdered in Chinatown after a large scale riot between two rival Chinese gangs over the ownership of the Red Dragon restaurant, which the owner previously lost in a game of Mahjong. They discover that Billy was carrying a 'chip chop note', which effectively reimbursed the owner \u00a350,000 for the seized heroin. Meanwhile, Eddie's relationship with George Webster continues to blossom, leading to an offer of some part-time security work. However, Gerry is concerned that Webster's proposal will land him in further trouble.\n |LineColor=87319F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber= 4\n |Title= Endangered Species\n |Aux1= Anita Bronson\n |Aux2= Keith Washington\n |Aux3= \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1994|5|1|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary= Aware that the police may have seized the 'chip chop note' found on Billy Cheung's body, the couriers organise for a second shipment of drugs to be brought into the country, again in a camcorder. However, this time, Bill and the team are on the case and stop the mule as he makes his way through Heathrow. They organise for a fake substance to be placed in the camcorder, in order for them to deliver it to its intended recipient - and catch him red-handed. Meanwhile, Eddie discovers that his first assignment for Webster involves couriering a quantity of gold coins across from Jersey. Eddie soon begins to realise, however, that the cargo isn't as legitimate as he first thought, and that he may have gotten himself caught up in a very tricky situation. Meanwhile, a consignment of cargo left behind in a shipping warehouse is smashed accidentally, but the accident reveals a collection of illegally imported elephant parts, including tusks and organs. Kevin tries to get in touch with the consignment owner, but discovers that he is out of the country on business. However, a lead soon comes from the exporters, who are discovered to have listed it, as well as several other consignments, as 'diplomatic cargo'.\n |LineColor=87319F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber= 5\n |Title= Reason for Concern\n |Aux1= Anita Bronson\n |Aux2= Gerry Poulson\n |Aux3= \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1994|5|8|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary= Kevin finally manages to track down the owner of the diplomatic cargo, and arranges for it to be collected. Diane organises a trail on the courier, which leads them back to the abandoned farmhouse where they first suspected the goods were being held. With the help of City and South, Diane orders a raid, and the owner is subsequently arrested. Meanwhile, Eddie continues to become weary of Tommy's erratic behaviour. Bill alerts Jersey customs to the possibility of a gold smuggling operation working out of an antique coin shop operating on the island, and they subsequently place surveillance on the premises. Gerry tries to distance himself from Webster after a proposition to courier illegal gold bullion worth \u00a34,000,000. However, Tommy isn't prepared to let him get away without a stern warning. Andreotti continues pursuing his hairdresser in the hope of a romantic tryst, however, inadvertently accepts an offer of a date from her sister. However, the date proves to be more than fruitful when she offers up information on a shady customer holding a safety deposit box at the bank where she works.

He suspects his wife of having an affair, and follows her to an impromptu meeting with Gerry, unaware that she is simply offloading her marital problems to a friendly ear. Meanwhile, Webster has ambitious plans to smuggle gold bullion across Europe, and asks Gerry if he wants in. Gerry reluctantly agrees, and gives Webster some invaluable inside information on where to store the illegal cargo. Meanwhile, Andreotti is given an opportunity to show what he is made of in the Mullvany case. When the team raid Mulvanny's safety deposit box, they discover a further \u00a340,000 in counterfeit notes. Bewildered at how Mulvanny and his cohort have managed to re-enter the country seven times without being caught, Gerry suspects that they may have swapped their vehicle's number plates whilst out on the continent, a fact which is later confirmed by CCTV footage. A search of Mulvanny's car also uncovers a clever scam involving a botched petrol tank, which is being used to hide the cargo.

Bill is convinced that Gerry is innocent, but Scudamore isn't so sure. Meanwhile, Eddie is devastated to learn that Webster no longer requires his services and tries to track him down. Scudamore decides to pull in Eddie before he decides to skip the country, but Eddie is determined not to be arrested and makes a startling decision, which sends shock waves throughout the team. Gerry and Beverley head for Brussels to collect the illegal bullion, unaware that Scudamore is firmly on their tail. With Tommy and his associate lying in wait for delivery, Scudamore heads up a raid on both parties. Gerry denies all knowledge of any illegal cargo, and claims he was simply taking a day's holiday away from prying eyes. Tommy's associate is subsequently arrested, but Tommy manages to escape through a cluttered scrapyard, and out of sight of Bill and the team. Webster is arrested, but denies all knowledge of Gerry's activities, and even claims he was unaware Gerry and his wife were having an affair. \n |LineColor=87319F\n}}\n|}\n\n===Series 2 (1996)===\nThe second series consists of thirteen episodes, and was broadcast from 28 April to 21 July 1996.

When his contact is later found dead having been the victim of torture, Vaughan realises that their two cases are connected - and that along with the poison dart frogs, \u00a312,000,000 in diamonds and \u00a3500,000 in heroin are also being smuggled into the country. However, it isn't long before the team's prime suspect, Barry Connery, decides to [[:wikt:up the ante|up the ante]], threatening Vaughan's wife - and taking Diane hostage.

Meanwhile, a local vigilante aiming to [[:wikt:put paid to|put paid to]] a paedophile ring operating in the area is found badly beaten, but despite Vaughan's urgency for information, the man is unable to talk. Evidence found at the scene leads the team to a model agency, being run by John and Anne Gilbraith, who sometimes employ the services of teenage girls for modelling. Back at HQ, a prominent MP approaches Scudamore when his daughter fails to board a flight to Spain to see her mother, and Vaughan suspects that she may be the latest victim of the paedophile ring. Meanwhile, Alex is on the trail of Colin Hunter, a man last seen on CCTV leading the missing girl into his car. With Jess on surveillance, Alex forces entry to Hunter's flat and discovers the address of a website which shares inappropriate images of underage children. Vaughan heads to Malaga to try and locate the missing girl, and break the ring - but discovers he may be too late, as the culprits have already fled back to London.\n |LineColor=070065\n}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0155436|title=The Knock}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Knock, The}}\n[[Category:1994 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2000 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:1990s British crime drama television series]]\n[[Category:2000s British crime drama television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:ITV television dramas]]\n[[Category:London Weekend Television programmes]]\n[[Category:Television series by ITV Studios]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in London]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2016}}\n{{Infobox television\n |show_name          = The Knock\n |show_name_2        = \n |image              = Theknocktvseries.jpg\n |image_upright      =\n |caption            = <small>(L to R: The show's main cast in Series Two \u2014 Marston Bloom, Enzo Squillino Jr., Steve Toussaint, Caroline Lee Johnson, Malcolm Storry, Alex Kingston, Andrew Dunn and Tracey Whitwell.)</small>\n |creator            = Anita Bronson\n |genre              = [[Crime fiction|Crime drama]]\n |writer             = Anita Bronson<br>Geoffrey Case<br>[[Ian Kennedy Martin]]<br>Steve Trafford<br>Stephen Leather\n |director           = Various\n |editor             = Nigel Parkes\n |starring           = [[Caroline Lee-Johnson]]<br>[[Steve Toussaint]]<br>[[Enzo Squillino, Jr.]]<br>[[Malcolm Storry]]<br>Marston Bloom<br>[[Andrew Dunn (actor)|Andrew Dunn]]<br>[[Mark Lewis Jones]]<br>[[Peter O'Brien (actor)|Peter O'Brien]]<br>[[Alex Kingston]]<br>Tracey Whitwell<br>Daniel O'Grady<br>Daniel Brown<br>Sarah Malin<br>[[Jonathan Kerrigan]]<br>[[Michelle Morris]]<br>[[Zig Byfield]]\n |composer           = [[Brian Bennett]]<br>[[Warren Bennett (musician)|Warren Bennett]]\n |opentheme          = \n |endtheme           = \"The Knock\"\n |country            = {{Unbulleted list|United Kingdom}}\n |language           = {{Unbulleted list|English}}\n |num_series         = 5\n |num_episodes       = 37\n |list_episodes      = #Episodes\n |executive_producer = Paul Knight\n |producer           = Phillip Leach\n |location           = {{Unbulleted list|United Kingdom}}\n |runtime            = 75 minutes <br><small>(w/advertisements) (Series 1-4)</small> <br> 105 minutes <small>(w/advertisements) (Series 5)</small>\n |company            = Bronson/Knight Productions for [[London Weekend Television|LWT]]\n |channel            = {{Unbulleted list|[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]}}\n |picture_format     = [[4:3]] <small>(1994\u201397)</small><br>[[16:9]] <small>(1999\u20132000)</small>\n |audio_format        = [[Monaural|Mono]] <small>(1994\u201396)</small><br>[[Stereophonic sound|Stereo]] <small>(1997\u20132000)</small>\n |first_aired        = {{start date|1994|4|10|df=yes}}\n |last_aired         = {{end date|2000|11|11|df=yes}}\n}}\n\n'''''The Knock''''' is a [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] television [[crime drama]], created by Anita Bronson and broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], which portrayed the activities of [[customs]] officers from the London City & South Collection Investigation Unit of [[HM Customs and Excise]].<ref>http://www.tv.com/shows/the-knock/episodes/</ref> The series derived its name from the distinctive \"''Knock knock knock''\" command used over the radio to synchronise a raid.\n\nFive series were broadcast from 10 April 1994, until 11 November 2000. The series had a rotating cast, with only a small number of cast members appearing throughout the series' run. The only three cast members to appear in every series were [[Caroline Lee-Johnson]], [[Trevor Byfield]] and [[Steve Toussaint]]. The series also adopted a number of different formats: while the early series interspersed various storylines and had running plots across the series; later series adopted a multi-part format resulting in two or three cases per series; while the final series adopted a stand-alone week by-week format.\n\nThe series was axed in 2001 following poor viewing figures for the final series. This was blamed on the loss of several main cast members, a change in the format and the overall look of the series which changed dramatically following an overhaul by ITV executives in 1999.<ref>http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/27-april-2001/846.issue</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main cast===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10%;\"| Character\n! colspan=5| Series\n|-\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Series 1\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Series 2\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Series 3\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Series 4\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Series 5\n|-\n!

Customs and Excise are overwhelmed when they are forced to deal with five concurrent cases. Firstly, Bill and the team organise a raid on an importer who is smuggling Heroin in from Jamaica via the postal service, but the suspect becomes less than co-operative when he tries to hide the evidence by swallowing it, causing him to have a severe reaction. Meanwhile, Diane and Eddie are on the trail of an illegal byplane seen landing in a small village outside Norfolk. They suspect it may have links to a smuggling ring, but a stake out proves to be less than fruitful. Bill is contacted by an old friend from Dutch customs, who are on the trail of another drug dealer, who is using an English courier to ferry his goods across the channel. They decide to fake an accident in order to lure the guilty parties into a honeytrap. Meanwhile, Gerry and Nicki go in search of a missing trader of rare antiques, only to stumble upon a collection of illegally imported coins, supposedly meant for wealthy conman George Webster. Back at the airport, Diane, Kevin and Eddie trail a Columbian woman and her associate who have taken drastic measures to resolve her dead husband's debt to a violent Columbian gang.\n |LineColor=87319F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber= 2\n |Title= Love and Respect\n |Aux1= Anita Bronson\n |Aux2= Keith Washington\n |Aux3= \n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1994|4|17|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary= Bill suspects that Peter Crediton, a respected family man, is importing child pornography from Thailand. When the team track a videotape sent to Crediton, they raid his house and find an attic dedicated to illegal material - but Crediton refuses to talk, exercising his right to silence. Meanwhile, Gerry and Nicki interview George Webster in the presence of his solicitor. Webster denies that the recovered coins have been illegally imported and claims that they belonged to his late mother. Webster then tries to bribe Gerry with tickets to the Arsenal game, but Gerry refuses; however George later sends him the tickets in the post, which he and Eddie use to attend the sold-out game. Webster then takes the bribery a step further by offering Gerry \u00a31,500 to make the investigation into his activities disappear, which Gerry accepts. Meanwhile, Diane is pleased when the plane is identified by French police as belonging to a suspect that the French authorities believe is involved in the production of drugs. A late night stakeout places the team right in the thick of the action as the courier flies in to make another drop on English soil.

Meanwhile, Gerry submits his report which suggests that the team drop the case against Webster, but Nicki isn't convinced of Gerry's findings and questions his motives. At Heathrow, a courier carrying a cargo of heroin in a video camera from Hong Kong is forced to leave his load behind after being approached by customs. The case goes unsolved until Bill and the team take up the case of Billy Cheung, who is found murdered in Chinatown after a large scale riot between two rival Chinese gangs over the ownership of the Red Dragon restaurant, which the owner previously lost in a game of Mahjong. They discover that Billy was carrying a 'chip chop note', which effectively reimbursed the owner \u00a350,000 for the seized heroin. Meanwhile, Eddie's relationship with George Webster continues to blossom, leading to an offer of some part-time security work.

They organise for a fake substance to be placed in the camcorder, in order for them to deliver it to its intended recipient - and catch him red-handed. Meanwhile, Eddie discovers that his first assignment for Webster involves couriering a quantity of gold coins across from Jersey. Eddie soon begins to realise, however, that the cargo isn't as legitimate as he first thought, and that he may have gotten himself caught up in a very tricky situation. Meanwhile, a consignment of cargo left behind in a shipping warehouse is smashed accidentally, but the accident reveals a collection of illegally imported elephant parts, including tusks and organs. Kevin tries to get in touch with the consignment owner, but discovers that he is out of the country on business.

Gerry reluctantly agrees, and gives Webster some invaluable inside information on where to store the illegal cargo. Meanwhile, Andreotti is given an opportunity to show what he is made of in the Mullvany case. When the team raid Mulvanny's safety deposit box, they discover a further \u00a340,000 in counterfeit notes. Bewildered at how Mulvanny and his cohort have managed to re-enter the country seven times without being caught, Gerry suspects that they may have swapped their vehicle's number plates whilst out on the continent, a fact which is later confirmed by CCTV footage. A search of Mulvanny's car also uncovers a clever scam involving a botched petrol tank, which is being used to hide the cargo.

Scudamore decides to pull in Eddie before he decides to skip the country, but Eddie is determined not to be arrested and makes a startling decision, which sends shock waves throughout the team. Gerry and Beverley head for Brussels to collect the illegal bullion, unaware that Scudamore is firmly on their tail. With Tommy and his associate lying in wait for delivery, Scudamore heads up a raid on both parties. Gerry denies all knowledge of any illegal cargo, and claims he was simply taking a day's holiday away from prying eyes. Tommy's associate is subsequently arrested, but Tommy manages to escape through a cluttered scrapyard, and out of sight of Bill and the team.

Shortly after, artists such as [[Walter de Maria]], [[Philip Taaffe]], [[Francesco Clemente]], and [[Peter Halley]] joined the gallery. Gagosian Gallery\u2019s second New York City location opened in the neighborhood of [[SoHo]], then the heart of the New York art scene, in 1991. Shortly before, the gallery had wooed [[David Salle]] and [[Philip Taaffe]] from long-term relationships with the [[Mary Boone]] Gallery.<ref>Grace Glueck (June 24, 1991), [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/24/arts/one-art-dealer-who-s-still-a-high-roller.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm One Art Dealer Who's Still a High Roller] ''New York Times''.</ref> The new venue served to show large-scale works by artists such as [[Richard Serra]], [[Mark di Suvero]], [[Barnett Newman]], and [[Chris Burden]]. The downtown location showed younger artists such as [[Ellen Gallagher]], [[Jenny Saville]], [[Douglas Gordon]] and [[Cecily Brown]]. The uptown gallery maintained its commitment to historical exhibitions by showing monumental sculptures by [[Mir\u00f3]], [[Alexander Calder|Calder]] and [[Henry Moore|Moore]].\n\nAndy Warhol was exhibited at both New York galleries, in collaboration with the [[Andy Warhol Foundation]], including exhibitions of his Rorschach Paintings, Camouflage Paintings, Late Hand-Painted Paintings, Oxidation Paintings and the Diamond Dust Shadow Paintings. In 1996, The [[Damien Hirst]] exhibition \"No Sense of Absolute Corruption,\" was the first exhibition in America to show Hirst\u2019s animals in [[formaldehyde]] tanks, a controversial series of the artist\u2019s oeuvre.\n\nGagosian opened a location in Beverly Hills designed by architect [[Richard Meier]] in 1995. The Beverly Hills gallery mounted exhibitions by [[Edward Ruscha]], [[Nan Goldin]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Richard Prince]]. It also showed modern artists such as [[Pablo Picasso]], Roy Lichtenstein and [[Abstract Expressionism]] group exhibitions. To finance Koons's giant \"Celebration\" sculptures, a consortium of dealers, including Gagosian, spent years helping the artist line up buyers willing to prepay for them. The buyers paid $2 million to $8 million apiece to own one of the artist' car-sized sculptures of balloon dogs and candy-colored hearts.<ref name=\"Crow\">Kelly Crow (April 1, 2011), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703712504576232791179823226 The Gagosian Effect] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Gagosian Gallery moved from SoHo to West 24th Street, in New York\u2019s industrial Chelsea.

In September 2000, in New York, Gagosian held the Hirst show, ''Damien Hirst: Models, Methods, Approaches, Assumptions, Results and Findings''.\n\nA second London Gallery, also designed by Caruso St John, on Britannia Street, opened in May 2004 with a paintings and sculpture show by [[Cy Twombly]]. Comparable to the Chelsea exhibition space in size, this addition was then the largest commercial art gallery in London.<ref name=\"Higgins\" /> It accommodated large sculpture, video pieces and installations such as [[Martin Kippenberger]]'s show, ''The Magical Misery Tour, Brazil''. The Heddon Street location closed in July 2005.

Pablo Picasso prints were the main body of the first exhibition.. \n\nTo complement the West 24th Street gallery, a [[Richard Gluckman]] designed space on West 21st Street opened in October 2006. A joint exhibition with the 24th Street gallery, ''Cast a Cold Eye: The Late Works of Andy Warhol'', launched Gagosian Gallery\u2019s second location in Chelsea and third location in New York. In 2009, the 21st Street gallery held an exhibition of Pablo Picasso\u2019s late works entitled ''Mosqueteros'', curated by Picasso historian [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]].\n\nThe Madison Avenue location introduced a fifth-floor gallery space, set up to focus more on young and upcoming artists. Featuring works by Hayley Tompkins and [[Anselm Reyle]], Old Space New Space inaugurated the space in January 2007. The fifth-floor gallery has since showcased the works of [[Steven Parrino]], [[Mark Grotjahn]] and [[Isa Genzken]], [[Dan Colen]] and [[Dash Snow]], among others. From 2007 on, Gagosian Gallery has also shown at the art gallery of the Eden Rock St Barths, [[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]], including an exhibition of [[Richard Prince]] (2007).\n\nGagosian opened a gallery in Rome in 2007, exhibiting new works by Cy Twombly. The Italian space is a refurbished former bank on Via Francesco Crispi, built in 1921 and redesigned by Rome-based architect Firouz Galdo in collaboration with Caruso St John. The renovation transformed the classical space into a contemporary gallery while retaining its Roman character. The main banking hall of the building had a huge bay window, and the architects have remodelled the opposite, formerly perpendicular, wall to create an oval space, with plenty of daylight coming through the windows.<ref>Peter Pophamin (December 17, 2007), [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/gagosian-turns-to-rome-for-next-stage-of-his-art-empire-765483.html Gagosian turns to Rome for next stage of his art empire] ''[[The Independent]]''.</ref>\n\nIn November 2008, Gagosian Gallery expanded its Madison Avenue gallery to the fourth floor, with an inaugural exhibition of works by [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] and [[Alberto Giacometti]] in ''Isabel and Other Intimate Strangers'', in collaboration with the Giacometti Foundation and the Bacon Foundation.<ref name=\"Segal\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/08/business/08larry.html?pagewanted=all|title=Pulling Art Sales Out of Thinning Air|author=David Segal | work=The New York Times|date=March 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nBetween 2003 and 2008, artists who had previously been represented by other renowned galleries joined Gagosian, such as [[Anselm Reyle]] from [[Gavin Brown's Enterprise]]; [[John Currin]] from Andrea Rosen; [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]] from [[Metro Pictures]]; [[Tom Friedman (artist)|Tom Friedman]] from Feature; [[Takashi Murakami]] from Marianne Boesky; and Richard Phillips from Friedrich Petzel.<ref>[[Roberta Smith]] (April 18, 2008), [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/18/arts/design/18pace.html Dear Gallery: It Was Fun, but I\u2019m Moving Up] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> On the other hand, several artists left the stable for smaller galleries, including [[Tom Friedman (artist)|Tom Friedman]], [[Mark di Suvero]], and [[Ghada Amer]].

Shortly after, artists such as [[Walter de Maria]], [[Philip Taaffe]], [[Francesco Clemente]], and [[Peter Halley]] joined the gallery. Gagosian Gallery\u2019s second New York City location opened in the neighborhood of [[SoHo]], then the heart of the New York art scene, in 1991.

The downtown location showed younger artists such as [[Ellen Gallagher]], [[Jenny Saville]], [[Douglas Gordon]] and [[Cecily Brown]]. The uptown gallery maintained its commitment to historical exhibitions by showing monumental sculptures by [[Mir\u00f3]], [[Alexander Calder|Calder]] and [[Henry Moore|Moore]].\n\nAndy Warhol was exhibited at both New York galleries, in collaboration with the [[Andy Warhol Foundation]], including exhibitions of his Rorschach Paintings, Camouflage Paintings, Late Hand-Painted Paintings, Oxidation Paintings and the Diamond Dust Shadow Paintings. In 1996, The [[Damien Hirst]] exhibition \"No Sense of Absolute Corruption,\" was the first exhibition in America to show Hirst\u2019s animals in [[formaldehyde]] tanks, a controversial series of the artist\u2019s oeuvre.\n\nGagosian opened a location in Beverly Hills designed by architect [[Richard Meier]] in 1995. The Beverly Hills gallery mounted exhibitions by [[Edward Ruscha]], [[Nan Goldin]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Richard Prince]]. It also showed modern artists such as [[Pablo Picasso]], Roy Lichtenstein and [[Abstract Expressionism]] group exhibitions. To finance Koons's giant \"Celebration\" sculptures, a consortium of dealers, including Gagosian, spent years helping the artist line up buyers willing to prepay for them. The buyers paid $2 million to $8 million apiece to own one of the artist' car-sized sculptures of balloon dogs and candy-colored hearts.<ref name=\"Crow\">Kelly Crow (April 1, 2011), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703712504576232791179823226 The Gagosian Effect] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Gagosian Gallery moved from SoHo to West 24th Street, in New York\u2019s industrial Chelsea.

In September 2000, in New York, Gagosian held the Hirst show, ''Damien Hirst: Models, Methods, Approaches, Assumptions, Results and Findings''.\n\nA second London Gallery, also designed by Caruso St John, on Britannia Street, opened in May 2004 with a paintings and sculpture show by [[Cy Twombly]]. Comparable to the Chelsea exhibition space in size, this addition was then the largest commercial art gallery in London.<ref name=\"Higgins\" /> It accommodated large sculpture, video pieces and installations such as [[Martin Kippenberger]]'s show, ''The Magical Misery Tour, Brazil''. The Heddon Street location closed in July 2005, and a new storefront space on Davies Street opened simultaneously with an exhibition of Pablo Picasso prints.\n\nTo complement the West 24th Street gallery, a [[Richard Gluckman]] designed space on West 21st Street opened in October 2006. A joint exhibition with the 24th Street gallery, ''Cast a Cold Eye: The Late Works of Andy Warhol'', launched Gagosian Gallery\u2019s second location in Chelsea and third location in New York. In 2009, the 21st Street gallery held an exhibition of Pablo Picasso\u2019s late works entitled ''Mosqueteros'', curated by Picasso historian [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]].\n\nThe Madison Avenue location introduced a fifth-floor gallery space, set up to focus more on young and upcoming artists. Featuring works by Hayley Tompkins and [[Anselm Reyle]], Old Space New Space inaugurated the space in January 2007. The fifth-floor gallery has since showcased the works of [[Steven Parrino]], [[Mark Grotjahn]] and [[Isa Genzken]], [[Dan Colen]] and [[Dash Snow]], among others. From 2007 on, Gagosian Gallery has also shown at the art gallery of the Eden Rock St Barths, [[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]], including an exhibition of [[Richard Prince]] (2007).\n\nGagosian opened a gallery in Rome in 2007, exhibiting new works by Cy Twombly. The Italian space is a refurbished former bank on Via Francesco Crispi, built in 1921 and redesigned by Rome-based architect Firouz Galdo in collaboration with Caruso St John. The renovation transformed the classical space into a contemporary gallery while retaining its Roman character. The main banking hall of the building had a huge bay window, and the architects have remodelled the opposite, formerly perpendicular, wall to create an oval space, with plenty of daylight coming through the windows.<ref>Peter Pophamin (December 17, 2007), [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/gagosian-turns-to-rome-for-next-stage-of-his-art-empire-765483.html Gagosian turns to Rome for next stage of his art empire] ''[[The Independent]]''.</ref>\n\nIn November 2008, Gagosian Gallery expanded its Madison Avenue gallery to the fourth floor, with an inaugural exhibition of works by [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] and [[Alberto Giacometti]] in ''Isabel and Other Intimate Strangers'', in collaboration with the Giacometti Foundation and the Bacon Foundation.<ref name=\"Segal\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/08/business/08larry.html?pagewanted=all|title=Pulling Art Sales Out of Thinning Air|author=David Segal | work=The New York Times|date=March 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nBetween 2003 and 2008, artists who had previously been represented by other renowned galleries joined Gagosian, such as [[Anselm Reyle]] from [[Gavin Brown's Enterprise]]; [[John Currin]] from Andrea Rosen; [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]] from [[Metro Pictures]]; [[Tom Friedman (artist)|Tom Friedman]] from Feature; [[Takashi Murakami]] from Marianne Boesky; and Richard Phillips from Friedrich Petzel.<ref>[[Roberta Smith]] (April 18, 2008), [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/18/arts/design/18pace.html Dear Gallery: It Was Fun, but I\u2019m Moving Up] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> On the other hand, several artists left the stable for smaller galleries, including [[Tom Friedman (artist)|Tom Friedman]], [[Mark di Suvero]], and [[Ghada Amer]].

Such aerial manufacturers included Snorkel, Pitman, Aerial Innovations (AI), Ladder Towers Incorporated (LTI), Smeal, Bronto Skylift and Nova Quintech (whose assets Pierce/Oshkosh acquired in 1997).

The object of such games then may be closely tied to the number of tricks taken, as in '''plain-trick games''' such as [[Whist]], [[Contract bridge]], [[Spades (card game)|Spades]], [[Napoleon (card game)|Napoleon]], [[Euchre]], Rowboat, Clubs and [[Spoil Five]], or to the value of the cards contained in taken tricks, as in '''point-trick games''' such as [[Pinochle]], the [[Tarot card games|Tarot]] family, [[Mariage (card game)|Mariage]], [[Rook (card game)|Rook]], [[All Fours]], [[Manille]], [[Briscola]], and most evasion games like [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]].<ref>{{harvnb|Parlett|2008|pages=xvii\u2013xviii}}.</ref> The domino game [[42 (dominoes)|Texas 42]] is an example of a trick-taking game that is not a card game. '''Trick-and-draw games''' are trick-taking games in which the players can fill up their hands after each trick. In most variants, players are free to play any card into a trick in the first phase of the game, but must ''follow suit'' as soon as the stock is depleted. '''Trick-avoidance games''' like [[Reversis]] or [[Polignac (card game)|Polignac]] are those in which the aim is to  avoid taking some or all tricks.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest [[card game]]s were trick-taking games (as evidenced by the rank-and-[[Suit (cards)|suit]] structure) originating from China and spreading westwards during the early part of the second millennium. [[Michael Dummett]] noted that these games share various features. They were played without [[trump (card games)|trumps]], following suit was not required but only the highest card of the suit led wins, rotation was counter-clockwise, they were plain-trick games, and that the [[pip card]]s of one or more suit are in reverse order so that the lower cards beat the higher ones.<ref name=\"DummettGame\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qqm1AAAAIAAJ |title=The Game of Tarot: From Ferrara to Salt Lake City |isbn=9780715610145 |author1=Dummett |first1=Michael A. E |last2=Mann |first2=Sylvia |year=1980}}</ref> Two revolutions occurred in European trick-taking games that would lead to the development of ever more sophisticated card games. The first is the invention of trumps (and following suit to contain their power) in the 15th century. The second was [[bidding]] in the 17th century.\n\nAccording to card game researcher [[David Parlett]], the oldest known European trick-taking game, [[Karn\u00f6ffel]], was mentioned in 1426 in the Bavarian town [[N\u00f6rdlingen]] \u2013 roughly half a century after the introduction of playing cards to Europe, which were first mentioned in Spain in 1371.<ref>{{harvnb|Parlett|1990|pages=35, 164}}.</ref> The oldest known \"trumps\" appear in Karn\u00f6ffel, where specific ranks of one suit were named ''Karn\u00f6ffel, Devil, Pope'' etc. and subject to an elaborate system of trumping powers. Around 1440 in Italy,  special cards called ''[[Trionfi (cards)|trionfi]]'' were introduced with a similar function. These special cards are now known as ''tarots'', and a deck augmented by tarots as a [[tarot]] deck. The trionfi/tarots formed essentially a fifth suit without the ordinary ranks but consisting of trumps in a fixed hierarchy. But one can get a similar effect by declaring all cards of a fixed or randomly determined suit to be trumps. This method, originating with [[Triomphe]], is still followed by a number of modern trick-taking games that do not involve an auction.<ref>{{harvnb|Parlett|1990|pages=163\u2013165}}.</ref> Trumps were retroactively added to some games, such as [[Trappola]]. It is much rarer for trumps to be removed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McLeod|first1=John|title=Playing the Game: Austrian Calling Games|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2013|volume=41|issue=4|pages=235\u2013238}}</ref><ref>McLeod, John. [http://www.pagat.com/marriage/anrufen.html#graden K\u00f6nigrufen (Graden)] at [[pagat.com]]. Retrieved 25 January 2016.</ref> The invention of trumps became so popular that very few European trick-taking games exist without them. This did not stop the two-handed [[Piquet]] from becoming the most popular card game in Europe during the 16th century. Parlett suggests the invention of trumps let players in games involving more than two a greater chance of heading a trick.<ref>{{harvnb|Parlett|1990|pages=180}}</ref>\n\nThe invention of bidding for a trump suit is credited to [[Ombre]], the most popular card game of the 17th century. Rather than having a randomly selected trump suit, players can now hold an auction for it. The most popular games of the 18th-century was tarot which experienced a great revival.<ref>{{harvnb|Parlett|1990|page=300}}.</ref> During this time, many tarot games borrowed bidding over the stock (taroc-l'hombre). In the 20th century, Whist (now with bidding and the dummy hand) developed into [[Contract bridge]], the last global trick-taking game.\n\nIt is possible that the origin of the practice of counting tricks (in plain-trick games) was the counting of cards won in tricks. It was therefore a logical development to accord some cards a higher counting-value, and some cards no value at all, leading to point-trick games. Point-trick games are at least as old as tarot decks and may even predate the invention of trumps. [[Elfern]] and [[F\u00fcnfzehnern]] are possible candidates although the earliest references date to the 19th century. Nearly all point-trick games are played with tarot decks or [[stripped deck]]s, which in many countries became standard before 1600, and neither point-trick games nor stripped decks have a tradition in England.\n\nWhile there are a number of games with unusual card-point values, such as [[Trappola]] and [[All Fours]], most point-trick games are in the huge family of [[Ace\u2013Ten card games]] beginning with [[Brusquembille]]. [[Pinochle]] is a representative of this family that is popular in the United States. Other examples include [[Belote]] and [[Skat (card game)|Skat]].\n\nIn contrast to Europe, Chinese trick-taking games did not develop trumps or bidding. They diverged into multi-trick games where melds can only be beaten by other melds provided they have the same number of cards. During the [[Qing dynasty]], these multi-trick games evolved into the earliest draw-and-discard games where the players' objective is to form melds and \"go out\" rather than capturing the opponents' cards. [[Khanhoo]] is an example of a multi-trick game that became a draw-and-discard game.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Berry|first1=John|title=Chinese Money-Suited Cards|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2003|volume=31|issue=5|pages=230\u2013235}}</ref> Multi-trick games are also probably the source for climbing games like [[Winner (card game)|Winner]] and ''[[dou dizhu]]'' which first appeared during the [[Cultural Revolution]].\n\n==Basic structure==\nCertain actions in trick-taking games with three or more players always proceed in the same direction. In games originating in North and West Europe, including England, Russia, and the United States and Canada, the rotation is typically clockwise (i.e., play proceeds to the left); in South and East Europe, Latin America, and Asia it is typically counterclockwise, so that play proceeds to the right. When games move from one region to another, they tend to initially preserve their original sense of rotation, but a region with a dominant sense of rotation may adapt a migrated game to its own sensibilities.<!--This should be enough. It's easy to guess the rotation in former colonies from this.--> For two-player games the order of play is moot as either direction would result in exactly the same turn order.\n\nIn each ''hand'' or ''deal'', one player is the ''[[Dealer (card player)|dealer]]''. This function moves from deal to deal in the normal direction of play. The dealer usually [[Shuffling|shuffles]] the deck (some games use \"soft shuffling\", where the dealer does not explicitly shuffle the deck), and after giving the player one seat from the dealer opposite the normal direction of play an opportunity to [[Cut (cards)|cut]], hands out the same (prescribed) number of cards to each player, usually in an order following the normal direction of play. Most games deal cards one at a time in rotation; a few games require dealing multiple cards at one time in a ''packet''. The cards apportioned to each player are collectively known as that player's ''hand'' and are only known to the player. Some games involve a set of cards that are not dealt to a player's hand; these cards form the ''stock'' (see below). It is generally good manners to leave one's cards on the table until the deal is complete.\n\nThe player sitting one seat after the declarer (one with the highest bid and not the dealer) in normal rotation is known as the ''[[eldest hand]]'', also called the ''forehand'' in [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] and other games of German origin. The eldest hand ''leads'' to the first ''trick'', i.e. places the first card of the trick face up in the middle of all players. The other players each follow with a single card, in the direction of play. When every player has played a card to the trick, the trick is evaluated to determine the winner, who takes the cards, places them face down on a pile, and leads to the next trick. The winner or taker of a trick is usually the player who played the highest-value card of the suit that was led, unless the game uses one or more ''[[Trump (card games)|trump]]'' cards (see below).\n\nThe player who leads to a trick is usually allowed to play an arbitrary card from their hand. Some games have restrictions on the first card played in the hand, or may disallow leading a card of a particular [[suit (cards)|suit]] until that suit has been played \"off-suit\" in a prior trick (called \"breaking\" the suit, usually seen in cases of a trump or penalty suit). Other games have special restrictions on the card that must be led to the first trick; usually this is a specific card (e.g., 2{{Clubs}}) and the holder of that card is the eldest hand instead of the person one seat after the dealer.\n\nIn many games, the following players must ''[[#Follow suit|follow suit]]'' if they can, i.e., they must play a card of the same suit if possible. A player who cannot follow suit may ''sluff'' a card, i.e., play a card of a different suit. A trick is won by the player who has played the highest-ranked card of the ''suit led'', i.e., of the suit of the first card in the trick (unless the game uses a [[#Trumps|trump suit]]).\n\nIt can be an advantage to lead to a trick, because the player who leads controls the suit that is led and which others must follow; the leading player playing a suit of which he has many, decreases the chance that anyone else would be able to follow suit; while conversely playing a suit of which he has few, allows him to rid his hand of that suit (known as ''[[Void (cards)|voiding]]'' the suit), freeing him from the restriction to follow suit when that suit is led by another player. On the other hand, it can also be advantageous to be the final player who plays to the trick, because at that point one has full information about the other cards played to the trick; the last player to a trick can play a card just slightly higher or lower than the current winning card, guaranteeing they will win or lose it by the minimum amount necessary, saving more valuable high or low value cards for situations where they must guarantee that a card played early to a trick will win or lose.\n\nWhen all cards have been played, the number or contents of the tricks won by each player is tallied and used to update the score. Scoring based on the play of tricks varies widely between games, but in most games either the number of tricks a player or partnership has won (''plain-trick'' games), or the value of certain cards that the player has won by taking tricks (''point-trick'' games) is important.\n\n== Partnerships ==\n* In many games such as [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]] and [[Oh Hell]], all players play individually against each other.\n* In many four-player games such as [[Contract bridge|Bridge]], [[Euchre]] and [[Spades (card game)|Spades]], the players sitting opposite to each other form a fixed partnership.\n* Some games such as [[Pinochle]] are commonly played with or without partnerships, depending on the number of players.\n* In some contract/auction games for three or more players, e.g. most Tarot variants, the contractor (''declarer'' or ''taker'') plays alone against all opponents, who form an ''ad hoc'' partnership (the ''defenders'').\n* In some games the partnerships are decided by chance \u2013 the contractor forms a partnership with the winner of the first trick, or with the player who holds a certain card. This practice originated from Cinquillo and [[Quadrille (card game)|Quadrille]].\n** In [[K\u00f6nigrufen]] and five-player [[French tarot]] the taker can call out a suit of which he does not possess the King, and is partnered with whomever does have it against the other three.\n** Standard [[Schafkopf]] is similar: A \"player\" can \"call\" a suit, and the person holding the ace of that suit becomes his partner for the hand. As this is not openly declared, it can be a challenge for the remaining players, to find out who is partnered with whom through cunning playing for several tricks. Aside from that, standard Schafkopf also has several solo options, where the \"player\" plays alone against the rest.\n** In [[Doppelkopf]] the two players holding the black Queens are partners for that hand. Special rules are provided for the case where a single player holds both black Queens.\n\n==Stock==\nIn some games not all cards are distributed to the players, and a ''stock'' remains. This stock can be referred to by different names, depending on the game; ''supply'', ''talon'', ''nest'', ''skat'', ''kitty'', and ''dog'' are common game-specific and/or regional names.\n\nIn some games the stock remains untouched throughout play of the hand; it is simply a pile of \"extra\" cards that will never be played and whose values are unknown, which will reduce the effectiveness of \"[[Card reading (bridge)|counting cards]]\" (a common strategy of keeping track of the cards that have been played or are yet to be played). In games without bidding, trumps may be decided by exposing a card in the stock as in [[Triomphe]]. In other games, the winner of an auction-bidding process (the taker or declarer) may get to exchange cards from his hand with the stock, either by integrating the stock into his hand and then discarding equal cards as in [[Skat (card game)|Skat]], [[Rook (card game)|Rook]] and [[French tarot]], or in a \"blind\" fashion by discarding and drawing as in [[Ombre]]. The stock, either in its original or discarded form, may additionally form part of one or more players' \"scoring piles\" of tricks taken; it may be kept by the declarer, may be won by the player of the first trick, or may go to an opposing player or partnership.\n\nIn some games, especially two-player games, after each trick every player draws a new card. This continues while the stock lasts. Since this drawing mechanism would normally make it difficult or impossible to detect a revoke (for instance, the player may not be able to follow suit, so they play off-suit and then immediately draw a card of the suit led), in the first phase of trick-play (before the stock is empty) players generally need not follow suit. A widespread game of this type is the [[Marriage group]].\n\n== Bidding ==\n\nIn a ''contract'' game the winning and scoring conditions are not fixed but are chosen by one of the players after seeing their hand. In such games, players make ''bids'' depending on the number of tricks or card points they believe they can win during play of the hand. One or more of these bids stands as the ''contract'', and the player who made that bid is rewarded for meeting it or penalized for not meeting it.\n\nIn ''auction'' games, bidding players are competing against each other for the right to attempt to make the contract. In a few games, the contract is fixed (normally a simple majority, less often based on certain cards captured during play) and players' bids are a wager of game points to be won or lost. In others, the bid is a number of tricks or card points the bidder is confident that they or their partnership will take. Either of these can also include the suit to be used as trumps during the hand. Common bids include slam (winning all the tricks), [[mis\u00e8re]] (losing all the tricks), ouvert (the contractor's hand is exposed), playing without using the stock or only part of it, and winning the last trick or other specific tricks. The highest bid becomes the contract and the highest bidder is the ''contractor'', known in some games as the ''declarer'' or ''taker'', who then plays either with or without a partner. The other players become ''opponents'' or ''defenders'', whose main goal is to prevent the contract being met. They may announce a ''contra'' against the contractor which doubles the points for the hand. The contractor can declare a ''recontra'' which will double the points again.\n\nPopular examples of games with auctions include [[Contract bridge]], [[Pinochle]], [[Tarot card games|tarot games]], [[Skat (card game)|Skat]], [[Belote]] and [[Twenty-eight (card game)|Twenty-Eight]]. In many auction games the eldest hand leads to the first trick, regardless of who won the auction, but in some, such as [[Contract bridge|Contract Bridge]], the first lead is made by the player next in rotation after the contractor, so that the contractor plays last to that trick.\n\nIn ''precision'' or ''exact-prediction'' games, all players choose their winning condition independently: to win precisely a predicted number of tricks ([[Oh Hell]]) or card points ([[Jass|Differenzler]]). Each player's bid stands (in partnership games the partners' bids are often combined), and each player or partnership then tries to take exactly the number of tricks or points they bid, and are rewarded or penalized for doing so independently of anyone else's success or failure in meeting their bid. This type of game began to mature in the 20th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Parlett|1990|pages=311\u2013315}}.</ref> Other games generally falling into the exact-prediction category are [[Spades (card game)|Spades]] and [[Ninety-nine (trick-taking card game)|Ninety-Nine]].\n\n==Trumps==\n''[[Trump (card games)|Trump cards]]'' are a set of one or more cards in the deck that, when played, are of higher value than the suit led. If a trick contains any trump cards, it is won by the highest-value trump card played, not the highest-value card of the suit led.\n\nIn most games with trumps, one of the four suits is identified as the ''trump suit''. In the simplest case, there is a static trump suit such as the Spade suit in the game [[Spades (card game)|Spades]], or a dedicated trump suit in the [[Tarot card games|Tarot]] family (in addition to the other four) is featured. More often, a dynamic trump suit is determined by some means, either randomly by selection of a card as in [[Oh Hell]] and the original form of [[Whist]], or decided by the winner or winning bid of an auction as in [[contract bridge]] and some forms of [[Pinochle]]. In certain games, such as Rowboat and Rage, the trump suit may change during the course of the hand, even from trick to trick. Some psychological variety is added to the game and makes it more difficult to cheat if the trump suit is only chosen after dealing.\n\nIn some games, in addition to or separately from a trump suit, certain fixed cards are always the highest trumps, e.g. the Jacks in [[Skat (card game)|Skat]], the Jacks or Jokers in [[Euchre]], and the Rook Bird card in [[Rook (card game)|Rook]]. They are called ''matadors'' after the high trumps in [[Ombre]]. ''Matadors'' either have high point values or special abilities as in [[Spoil Five]] where they can revoke legally.\n\nSome games have more than one trump suit, such as the quasi-trick game [[Stortok]], in which there are two trumps, with one superseding the other. Other games have no trumps; [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]] for instance has no provision for a trump suit of any kind (the Hearts suit for which the game is named has a different significance). Though trump is part of [[contract bridge]], teams can make bids that do not specify a trump suit, and if that is the winning bid then there is no trump suit for that hand (making such a contract is regarded as harder to accomplish).\n\n==Declarations==\nIn some games such as [[Piquet]], [[Tarocchini]], and [[Belote]], before the taking of tricks commences, players can expose certain cards or [[Meld (cards)|melds]] (combinations) that they possess for bonus points. While this phase may seem to award players for pure chance, those who do declare risk letting their opponents develop strategies to counter the cards that they have revealed.\n\n==Follow suit==\nIn many games, ''following suit'' is the obligatory action of playing a card of the same suit as that of the leading suit. A player must follow suit if that player has cards of the leading suit in his hands. There is a large variation of strictness in following suit among games.<ref>McLeod, John. [https://www.pagat.com/mech.html#followsuit Mechanics of Card Games] at [[pagat.com]]. Retrieved 18 February 2017.</ref>\n\nIn most modern games with trump suits, the rules for following suit do not distinguish between the trump suit and the ''plain suits''. If a trick begins with a plain suit card and a later player cannot follow suit, the player may choose freely to either ''slough'' (discard a card of another plain suit), or ''ruff'' (''trump'' the trick by playing a trump card). Subsequent players to the trick must still follow the original suit, and may only discard or trump if they do not hold a card of the suit led. Certain games are \"play to beat\" or \"must-trump\"; if a player cannot follow suit but can play trump, they must play trump, and additionally if they are able they must beat any trump card already played to the trick. [[Pinochle]] and several of the [[Tarot card games]] have this rule.\n\nSome games, notably [[French tarot]] and a variation of [[Rook (card game)|Rook]], use a special card (in French Tarot's case, the [[The Fool (Tarot card)|Excuse]]) that can be played at any time. If not, he has the choice of playing a trump to possibly win the trick, or rough (waste) a different suit.\n\nIf unable to follow suit or trump, any card can be played. Each trick must contain one card per player, and hence a player unable to satisfy any other instruction is at liberty to play any card. Usually a low-ranking card or one from a short suit is sacrificed. The former is used to protect a higher ranking card while the latter is to help void a suit so as to allow trumping a future trick.\n\nIt is also possible that the specific deal has \"no trump\". In that case, any card other than the leading suit played has no value, in most trick-taking games. In some games such as [[Oh, hell]], where the player may need to not get more tricks to win, playing cards other than the leading suit can be useful.<ref>McLeod, John.

Retrieved 18 February 2017.</ref>\n\nFor example, consider the following [[Whist]] hand:\n:: Trump diamonds {{cards|d}}\n* North: {{cards|As|Ks|4h|9d}}\n* East: {{cards|7s|5d|Qc|10c}}\n* South: {{cards|3h|2d|Jd|Ac}}\n* West: {{cards|5s|2s|6h|5c}}\n\nNorth leads the deal with {{spades|K}}. Now, all the other players must follow suit, i.e. play a spade card. East has a spade card, and thus must follow suit by playing {{spades|7}}. South, however, does not have any spade card, and thus is allowed to play any card he wants. If he desires to win the trick, he can override North's {{spades|K}} by playing a diamond card (diamond being the trump), for example {{diamonds|J}}. If he does not want to win the trick, he can slough any other suit, such as {{hearts|3}}. Let us assume that he plays {{diamonds|J}}, overriding North's card. Now, West still has to follow suit, since he has a spade card, and plays {{spades|2}}. South's trump card, gives him an opportunity to escape following suit, and he wins the trick.\n\nIf a player who can follow suit does not do so, or in games with additional restrictions on card play, not following these restrictions is known as a [[revoke]], or 'renege'. A revoke typically cannot be discovered at the time when it is committed, but when a player plays off-suit to a trick, competent opponents will make a mental note that the player does not hold the suit led, and will notice later if the player later plays a card of the suit they were thought to be void in. The situation is similar for other types of revoke. Most game rules prescribe a severe penalty for a revoke and may also result in the hand being voided (a \"misdeal\"). Decks of cards have been marketed for trick-taking games with the traditional French suit symbols, but in four colors; these are often called [[Four-color deck|\"no-revoke\" decks]], as the color contrast between each suit makes a potential revoking play easier to spot and harder to do accidentally.\n\nIn some trick games\u2014typically ones in which players are not penalized for winning tricks, and there is no requirement for trumping or following suit when possible\u2014players may ''slough'', or play a card face down.  A card so played is incapable of winning the trick; but sloughing has the advantage that the other players cannot see what card is played. As this form of sloughing has the potential to be used to cheat in most games (i.e. playing a winning card face-down to avoid taking an \"overtrick\" or a trick containing penalty points) and is thus not allowed, ''sloughing'' in the vernacular more often refers to simply discarding an off-suit card on a trick, particularly one that could be dangerous to that player if kept. This form of sloughing is important in evasion games and in some contract games where \"overtricks\" are penalized; in [[Oh Hell]], for instance, a player who cannot follow suit may elect to discard a card that would win if played to follow suit later, thus reducing the chance that the player will \"bag\", or take more tricks than needed. This is common in [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]], where high-value cards (especially Spades and Hearts) are dangerous as they increase the chance of winning a trick with penalty points.\n\nSome games such as [[Pinochle]] use several decks shuffled together. In these games, there may be several equal winning cards in a trick; such games then use other rules to break ties. Common rules include:\n* the first-played of the tying cards wins\n* the last-played of the tying cards wins\n* The tying cards cancel each other out, and the trick is taken by the next-highest card that was played.\n* The tying cards cancel each other out, but the trick is spoiled (ignored).\n\nA common additional rule to reduce these occurrences is that a player cannot play a card tying the current high card unless they would renege or fail to overtrump by making any other play.\n\n==Scoring==\nWhen all tricks have been played, the winner of the hand and the players' scores can be determined. The determining factor in plain-trick games (the most popular form of trick-taking games in English-speaking countries) is simply how many tricks each player or partnership has taken. In point-trick games, certain card values are worth varying points, and the players sum the points from cards in their \"scoring piles\" that were accumulated by taking tricks. Points for cards, and the method of counting points, vary by game; in Rook, for example, the 5-card of each color is worth 5 points, the 10 and 14 (or Ace) is worth 10, and the Rook Bird (or Joker) is worth 20, while all other cards are worth nothing. Many Chinese card games like Finding Friends use a very similar system, in which each 5-card is worth 5 points, and the 10 and King are each worth 10 points.<ref>Rules for Chinese trick-taking card game [http://www.zhao-pengyou.com/ \"Finding Friends (Zhao Pengyou)\"]. Retrieved on 7 September 2018.</ref> Pinochle has many popular scoring variants usually based on point values for face cards and Aces, while pip cards score no points. In French Tarot, all cards have a value including a half-point, and are traditionally scored in pairs of a high-value and a low-value card which results in a whole-point value for the pair.\n\nIn the most common ''positive'' or ''race'' games, players seek to win as many tricks or card points as possible. To win a hand, a player typically needs to win a minimal number of tricks or card points; this minimal threshold is usually called the \"contract\", and may be defined by the game's rules (a simple majority of total available points or tricks, or tiered thresholds depending on which player or side has captured certain cards), or the result of an \"auction\" or \"bidding\" process. A player who wins more than the number of tricks or card points necessary for winning the hand may be rewarded with a higher score, or conversely (in exact-prediction games) they may be penalized.\n\nThere are also ''negative'' or ''evasion'' games, in which the object is to avoid tricks or card points. E.g. in Hearts each card point won in a trick contributes negatively to the score. A special type is ''mis\u00e8re'' games, which are usually variants of positive games which can only be won by not winning a single trick.\n\nOther criteria also occur. Sometimes the last trick has special significance. In ''marriage games'' such as Pinochle the winner of the last trick receives 10 points in addition to the card points, while in ''final-trick'' games such as [[c\u1eaft t\u00ea]] only the winner of the last trick can win a hand. There are also blends between positive and negative games, e.g. the aim may be to win a certain prescribed number of tricks. Many card games, regardless of their normal scoring mechanism, give bonuses to players or partnerships who win all tricks or possible points in a hand, or conversely lose all tricks or points.\n\nGames usually end after every player has had an equal chance to be the dealer. The number of rotations varies widely among games. Some games have a cumulative score where all points from each hand add up. Others assign only a set number of game points for winning a hand. For example, a player or side that wins one hand may be awarded one game point, two if they achieve a slam. The player or side with the most game points or the first to reach a certain number of card or game points, is considered the winner.\n\n==Special variations==\n=== Variations to basic rules ===\nNumerous further variations to the basic rules may occur, and only a few examples can be mentioned here:\n* Certain games require the holder of a certain card value to play it as the lead to the first trick of a hand; [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]], as commonly played in North America, requires the player holding the 2{{Clubs}} to play it as the lead-off card. Variants of [[Pinochle]] sometimes require the first player to the left of the dealer that holds a ''dix'' (9{{Clubs}}) to lead off.\n* There may be restrictions on leading certain suits; a common Hearts rule is that a player may not lead a Heart until at least one trick has had a Heart played off-suit to another trick. Spades has a similar but less-common variation regarding its trump suit.\n* There are trick-taking games played with [[Domino]] tiles instead of playing cards. These include the Chinese [[Tien Gow]] and [[42 (dominoes)|Texas 42]]. [[Giog]] is played with [[Xiangqi|Chinese chess]] tiles.\n* Many games are played with one or more ''[[stripped deck]]s'' (a deck from which certain card values are removed). The most common stripped deck is a [[piquet deck]], used for [[piquet]], [[Belote]], [[Skat (card game)|Skat]], [[Euchre]], [[Bezique]] and (with two piquet decks) [[Pinochle]], among others. [[Rook (card game)|Rook]]'s main variant, Kentucky Discard, uses the equivalent of a 52-card deck with all card values 2\u20134 removed. Most regional [[Tarot]] variants, especially Central European and Italian variants like Tarock and Tarocco, use some subset of the \"full\" 78-card Tarot deck.\n* In Bridge the partner of the contractor or ''declarer'' is called ''dummy'' and does not actively participate in the play; dummy's hand is instead laid on the table face-up after the opening lead, and declarer chooses the cards from dummy's hand to play during dummy's turns.\n* In [[Karuta#Unsun Karuta|Hachinin-meri]] and Truf, trumps are played face down. When the trick is finished, the trumps are revealed to see who won the trick.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Depaulis|first1=Thierry|title=Unsun, a Far-eastern Cousin of Ombre|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=1983|volume=12|issue=1|pages=39\u201344}}</ref><ref>McLeod, John. [http://www.pagat.com/exact/truf.html Truf] at [[pagat.com]]. Retrieved 25 January 2016.</ref>\n* In many trumpless games that do not require following suit, sluffing is done face down. This is done in [[Madiao]], [[Tien Gow]], [[Tam c\u00fac]], [[:zh:\u516d\u864e\u724c|Six Tigers]], [[Ganjifa]], [[Kaiserspiel]], and Brazilian [[Truco]].\n* Some cards lose their trick-taking power if they are not led or played in a specific trick as in [[Karn\u00f6ffel]], [[Tien Gow]], and [[Ganjifa]].\n* In [[tarot game]]s played outside of Central Europe, [[The Fool (Tarot card)|the Fool]] is a special card that excuses the player from following suit. Except in rare circumstances in some games, it can neither capture nor be captured. Usually a non-counting card is given as compensation to the trick's winner by the Fool's owner.\n\n=== Rules in Austrian and German games ===\nIn games derived from Austria and Germany, trick-taking is governed by the rules called ''Zw\u00e4nge''. The three main ones are ''Farbzwang'', ''Stichzwang'' and ''Trumpfzwang''. Although they broadly equate to rules in English-speaking countries, there are no single-word equivalents. For many games of this type, applying these rules correctly is crucial to the type of contract being played.\n\n==== ''Farbzwang'' ====\n''Farbzwang'' (or ''Bedienzwang'') literally means \"suit compulsion\" and is the rule that players must follow the suit of the first card to be led to the trick, provided that they have a card of that suit. If a player does not have a card of the led suit, they may play ('discard') a card of their choice. If a player has several cards of the led suit, they may choose which to play. In most cases it makes sense to play a higher ranking card.\n\n==== ''Stichzwang'' ====\n''Stichzwang'' means \"trick compulsion\" and is the rule that players must attempt to win the trick if they are able, either by playing a higher card of the led suit or by playing a trump card.\n\n==== ''Farbzwang'' with ''Stichzwang'' ====\nSome games apply ''Farbzwang'' and ''Stichzwang'' together, which means that a player, when it is his turn, must:\n* take the trick with a higher card of the led suit. If unable to do so, he must\n* discard a lower card of the led suit. If that is not possible, he must\n* take the trick with a trump card, but if that is also not feasible, he may\n* discard a card of his choice.\n\n''Farbzwang'', the requirement to follow suit, always takes precedence over ''Stichzwang''. A player is not allowed to take the trick with a trump if he can follow suit.\n\n==== ''Trumpfzwang'' ====\n''Trumpzwang'' means \"trump compulsion\" and requires that a player ''must'' play a trump if he cannot follow suit. In other words, he may not simply discard, if he cannot follow suit.\n\n''Example'': Acorns are trumps. Forehand plays the 8 of Bells, middlehand trumps with a 10 of Acorns; rearhand has no Bells, but does have a trump card, the 8 of Acorns. He must play this and cannot discard another non-trump card in order to keep the trump for a subsequent trick.\n\n==== ''Tarockzwang'' ====\n''Tarockzwang'' is used in [[tarock game]]s such as [[K\u00f6nigrufen]] and [[Tapp-Tarock]] and means \"Tarock compulsion\" or the requirement to play a Tarock card if one is led to the trick or if a player is unable to follow suit. It is a form of ''Trumpfzwang''.\n\n== Examples ==\n{{Related article|List of Ace-Ten games}}\nTrick-taking games may be divided into point-trick games and plain-trick games. Examples of each are as follows:\n\n=== Point-trick games ===\nPoint-trick game are those in which win or loss is determined by the total value of the \"counters\" in the tricks.<ref name=\"parlett,2008,644\u2013645\">{{harvnb|Parlett|2008|pages=644\u2013645}}.</ref> The counters are cards with a point value, sometimes referred to as \"card points\" to avoid confusion with \"game points\" awarded for winning the game and/or bonuses.\n\nExamples include:\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=20}}\n* [[Bavarian Tarock]]\n* [[Belote]]\n* [[B\u00e9zique]]\n* [[Binokel]]\n* [[Doppelkopf]]\n* [[Jass]]\n* Finding Friends ([[Zhao Pengyou]])\n* [[Schafkopf]]\n* [[Schnapsen]] or [[Sixty-six (card game)|Sixty-six]]\n* [[Skat (card game)|Skat]]\n* [[Tarock]] games ([[French tarot]], [[K\u00f6nigrufen]], [[Zwanzigerrufen]], etc.)\n* [[Trappola]] (Bulka)\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n=== Plain-trick games ===\nPlain-trick games are those in which the outcome is determined by the number of tricks taken, regardless of their content.<ref name=\"parlett,2008,644\u2013645\"/>\n\nExamples of plain-trick games include:\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=20}}\n* [[Boston (card game)|Boston]]\n* [[Bridge (card game)|Bridge]]\n* [[\u00c9cart\u00e9]]\n* [[Jabberwocky (card game)|Jabberwocky]]\n* [[Ombre]] and [[Quadrille (card game)|Quadrille]]\n* [[Piquet]]\n* [[Pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence]]\n* [[Solo Whist]]\n* [[Tippen]]\n* [[Watten (card game)|Watten]]\n* [[Whist]]\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\nIn games that consist of several successive, different, trick-taking contracts, such as Herzeln or Quodlibet, it is not possible to categorise them as either point- or plain-trick games.\n\n=== Trick-avoidance games ===\nTrick-avoidance games are those in which the aim is to avoid taking certain tricks or to avoid taking all tricks. [[Misere]] or [[Bettel (cards)|bettel]] are contracts in which the declarer undertakes to win no tricks. There are also contracts like [[Piccolo (cards)|Piccolo]] in which the aim is to take only one trick.

The object of such games then may be closely tied to the number of tricks taken, as in '''plain-trick games''' such as [[Whist]], [[Contract bridge]], [[Spades (card game)|Spades]], [[Napoleon (card game)|Napoleon]], [[Euchre]], Rowboat, Clubs and [[Spoil Five]], or to the value of the cards contained in taken tricks, as in '''point-trick games''' such as [[Pinochle]], the [[Tarot card games|Tarot]] family, [[Mariage (card game)|Mariage]], [[Rook (card game)|Rook]], [[All Fours]], [[Manille]], [[Briscola]], and most evasion games like [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]].<ref>{{harvnb|Parlett|2008|pages=xvii\u2013xviii}}.</ref> The domino game [[42 (dominoes)|Texas 42]] is an example of a trick-taking game that is not a card game. '''Trick-and-draw games''' are trick-taking games in which the players can fill up their hands after each trick. In most variants, players are free to play any card into a trick in the first phase of the game, but must ''follow suit'' as soon as the stock is depleted. '''Trick-avoidance games''' like [[Reversis]] or [[Polignac (card game)|Polignac]] are those in which the aim is to  avoid taking some or all tricks.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest [[card game]]s were trick-taking games (as evidenced by the rank-and-[[Suit (cards)|suit]] structure) originating from China and spreading westwards during the early part of the second millennium. [[Michael Dummett]] noted that these games share various features. They were played without [[trump (card games)|trumps]], following suit was not required but only the highest card of the suit led wins, rotation was counter-clockwise, they were plain-trick games, and that the [[pip card]]s of one or more suit are in reverse order so that the lower cards beat the higher ones.<ref name=\"DummettGame\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qqm1AAAAIAAJ |title=The Game of Tarot: From Ferrara to Salt Lake City |isbn=9780715610145 |author1=Dummett |first1=Michael A. E |last2=Mann |first2=Sylvia |year=1980}}</ref> Two revolutions occurred in European trick-taking games that would lead to the development of ever more sophisticated card games. The first is the invention of trumps (and following suit to contain their power) in the 15th century. The second was [[bidding]] in the 17th century.\n\nAccording to card game researcher [[David Parlett]], the oldest known European trick-taking game, [[Karn\u00f6ffel]], was mentioned in 1426 in the Bavarian town [[N\u00f6rdlingen]] \u2013 roughly half a century after the introduction of playing cards to Europe, which were first mentioned in Spain in 1371.<ref>{{harvnb|Parlett|1990|pages=35, 164}}.</ref> The oldest known \"trumps\" appear in Karn\u00f6ffel, where specific ranks of one suit were named ''Karn\u00f6ffel, Devil, Pope'' etc. and subject to an elaborate system of trumping powers. Around 1440 in Italy,  special cards called ''[[Trionfi (cards)|trionfi]]'' were introduced with a similar function. These special cards are now known as ''tarots'', and a deck augmented by tarots as a [[tarot]] deck. The trionfi/tarots formed essentially a fifth suit without the ordinary ranks but consisting of trumps in a fixed hierarchy. But one can get a similar effect by declaring all cards of a fixed or randomly determined suit to be trumps. This method, originating with [[Triomphe]], is still followed by a number of modern trick-taking games that do not involve an auction.<ref>{{harvnb|Parlett|1990|pages=163\u2013165}}.</ref> Trumps were retroactively added to some games, such as [[Trappola]]. It is much rarer for trumps to be removed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McLeod|first1=John|title=Playing the Game: Austrian Calling Games|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2013|volume=41|issue=4|pages=235\u2013238}}</ref><ref>McLeod, John. [http://www.pagat.com/marriage/anrufen.html#graden K\u00f6nigrufen (Graden)] at [[pagat.com]]. Retrieved 25 January 2016.</ref> The invention of trumps became so popular that very few European trick-taking games exist without them. This did not stop the two-handed [[Piquet]] from becoming the most popular card game in Europe during the 16th century. Parlett suggests the invention of trumps let players in games involving more than two a greater chance of heading a trick.<ref>{{harvnb|Parlett|1990|pages=180}}</ref>\n\nThe invention of bidding for a trump suit is credited to [[Ombre]], the most popular card game of the 17th century. Rather than having a randomly selected trump suit, players can now hold an auction for it. The most popular games of the 18th-century was tarot which experienced a great revival.<ref>{{harvnb|Parlett|1990|page=300}}.</ref> During this time, many tarot games borrowed bidding over the stock (taroc-l'hombre). In the 20th century, Whist (now with bidding and the dummy hand) developed into [[Contract bridge]], the last global trick-taking game.\n\nIt is possible that the origin of the practice of counting tricks (in plain-trick games) was the counting of cards won in tricks. It was therefore a logical development to accord some cards a higher counting-value, and some cards no value at all, leading to point-trick games. Point-trick games are at least as old as tarot decks and may even predate the invention of trumps. [[Elfern]] and [[F\u00fcnfzehnern]] are possible candidates although the earliest references date to the 19th century. Nearly all point-trick games are played with tarot decks or [[stripped deck]]s, which in many countries became standard before 1600, and neither point-trick games nor stripped decks have a tradition in England.\n\nWhile there are a number of games with unusual card-point values, such as [[Trappola]] and [[All Fours]], most point-trick games are in the huge family of [[Ace\u2013Ten card games]] beginning with [[Brusquembille]]. [[Pinochle]] is a representative of this family that is popular in the United States. Other examples include [[Belote]] and [[Skat (card game)|Skat]].\n\nIn contrast to Europe, Chinese trick-taking games did not develop trumps or bidding. They diverged into multi-trick games where melds can only be beaten by other melds provided they have the same number of cards. During the [[Qing dynasty]], these multi-trick games evolved into the earliest draw-and-discard games where the players' objective is to form melds and \"go out\" rather than capturing the opponents' cards. [[Khanhoo]] is an example of a multi-trick game that became a draw-and-discard game.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Berry|first1=John|title=Chinese Money-Suited Cards|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2003|volume=31|issue=5|pages=230\u2013235}}</ref> Multi-trick games are also probably the source for climbing games like [[Winner (card game)|Winner]] and ''[[dou dizhu]]'' which first appeared during the [[Cultural Revolution]].\n\n==Basic structure==\nCertain actions in trick-taking games with three or more players always proceed in the same direction. In games originating in North and West Europe, including England, Russia, and the United States and Canada, the rotation is typically clockwise (i.e., play proceeds to the left); in South and East Europe, Latin America, and Asia it is typically counterclockwise, so that play proceeds to the right. When games move from one region to another, they tend to initially preserve their original sense of rotation, but a region with a dominant sense of rotation may adapt a migrated game to its own sensibilities.<!--This should be enough. It's easy to guess the rotation in former colonies from this.--> For two-player games the order of play is moot as either direction would result in exactly the same turn order.\n\nIn each ''hand'' or ''deal'', one player is the ''[[Dealer (card player)|dealer]]''. This function moves from deal to deal in the normal direction of play. The dealer usually [[Shuffling|shuffles]] the deck (some games use \"soft shuffling\", where the dealer does not explicitly shuffle the deck), and after giving the player one seat from the dealer opposite the normal direction of play an opportunity to [[Cut (cards)|cut]], hands out the same (prescribed) number of cards to each player, usually in an order following the normal direction of play. Most games deal cards one at a time in rotation; a few games require dealing multiple cards at one time in a ''packet''. The cards apportioned to each player are collectively known as that player's ''hand'' and are only known to the player. Some games involve a set of cards that are not dealt to a player's hand; these cards form the ''stock'' (see below). It is generally good manners to leave one's cards on the table until the deal is complete.\n\nThe player sitting one seat after the declarer (one with the highest bid and not the dealer) in normal rotation is known as the ''[[eldest hand]]'', also called the ''forehand'' in [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] and other games of German origin. The eldest hand ''leads'' to the first ''trick'', i.e. places the first card of the trick face up in the middle of all players. The other players each follow with a single card, in the direction of play. When every player has played a card to the trick, the trick is evaluated to determine the winner, who takes the cards, places them face down on a pile, and leads to the next trick. The winner or taker of a trick is usually the player who played the highest-value card of the suit that was led, unless the game uses one or more ''[[Trump (card games)|trump]]'' cards (see below).\n\nThe player who leads to a trick is usually allowed to play an arbitrary card from their hand. Some games have restrictions on the first card played in the hand, or may disallow leading a card of a particular [[suit (cards)|suit]] until that suit has been played \"off-suit\" in a prior trick (called \"breaking\" the suit, usually seen in cases of a trump or penalty suit). Other games have special restrictions on the card that must be led to the first trick; usually this is a specific card (e.g., 2{{Clubs}}) and the holder of that card is the eldest hand instead of the person one seat after the dealer.\n\nIn many games, the following players must ''[[#Follow suit|follow suit]]'' if they can, i.e., they must play a card of the same suit if possible. A player who cannot follow suit may ''sluff'' a card, i.e., play a card of a different suit. A trick is won by the player who has played the highest-ranked card of the ''suit led'', i.e., of the suit of the first card in the trick (unless the game uses a [[#Trumps|trump suit]]).\n\nIt can be an advantage to lead to a trick, because the player who leads controls the suit that is led and which others must follow; the leading player playing a suit of which he has many, decreases the chance that anyone else would be able to follow suit; while conversely playing a suit of which he has few, allows him to rid his hand of that suit (known as ''[[Void (cards)|voiding]]'' the suit), freeing him from the restriction to follow suit when that suit is led by another player. On the other hand, it can also be advantageous to be the final player who plays to the trick, because at that point one has full information about the other cards played to the trick; the last player to a trick can play a card just slightly higher or lower than the current winning card, guaranteeing they will win or lose it by the minimum amount necessary, saving more valuable high or low value cards for situations where they must guarantee that a card played early to a trick will win or lose.\n\nWhen all cards have been played, the number or contents of the tricks won by each player is tallied and used to update the score. Scoring based on the play of tricks varies widely between games, but in most games either the number of tricks a player or partnership has won (''plain-trick'' games), or the value of certain cards that the player has won by taking tricks (''point-trick'' games) is important.\n\n== Partnerships ==\n* In many games such as [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]] and [[Oh Hell]], all players play individually against each other.\n* In many four-player games such as [[Contract bridge|Bridge]], [[Euchre]] and [[Spades (card game)|Spades]], the players sitting opposite to each other form a fixed partnership.\n* Some games such as [[Pinochle]] are commonly played with or without partnerships, depending on the number of players.\n* In some contract/auction games for three or more players, e.g. most Tarot variants, the contractor (''declarer'' or ''taker'') plays alone against all opponents, who form an ''ad hoc'' partnership (the ''defenders'').\n* In some games the partnerships are decided by chance \u2013 the contractor forms a partnership with the winner of the first trick, or with the player who holds a certain card. This practice originated from Cinquillo and [[Quadrille (card game)|Quadrille]].\n** In [[K\u00f6nigrufen]] and five-player [[French Tarot]] the taker can call out a suit of which he does not possess the King, and is partnered with whomever does have it against the other three.\n** Standard [[Schafkopf]] is similar: A \"player\" can \"call\" a suit, and the person holding the ace of that suit becomes his partner for the hand. As this is not openly declared, it can be a challenge for the remaining players, to find out who is partnered with whom through cunning playing for several tricks. Aside from that, standard Schafkopf also has several solo options, where the \"player\" plays alone against the rest.\n** In [[Doppelkopf]] the two players holding the black Queens are partners for that hand. Special rules are provided for the case where a single player holds both black Queens.\n\n==Stock==\nIn some games not all cards are distributed to the players, and a ''stock'' remains. This stock can be referred to by different names, depending on the game; ''supply'', ''talon'', ''nest'', ''skat'', ''kitty'', and ''dog'' are common game-specific and/or regional names.\n\nIn some games the stock remains untouched throughout play of the hand; it is simply a pile of \"extra\" cards that will never be played and whose values are unknown, which will reduce the effectiveness of \"[[Card reading (bridge)|counting cards]]\" (a common strategy of keeping track of the cards that have been played or are yet to be played). In games without bidding, trumps may be decided by exposing a card in the stock as in [[Triomphe]]. In other games, the winner of an auction-bidding process (the taker or declarer) may get to exchange cards from his hand with the stock, either by integrating the stock into his hand and then discarding equal cards as in [[Skat (card game)|Skat]], [[Rook (card game)|Rook]] and [[French tarot]], or in a \"blind\" fashion by discarding and drawing as in [[Ombre]]. The stock, either in its original or discarded form, may additionally form part of one or more players' \"scoring piles\" of tricks taken; it may be kept by the declarer, may be won by the player of the first trick, or may go to an opposing player or partnership.\n\nIn some games, especially two-player games, after each trick every player draws a new card. This continues while the stock lasts. Since this drawing mechanism would normally make it difficult or impossible to detect a revoke (for instance, the player may not be able to follow suit, so they play off-suit and then immediately draw a card of the suit led), in the first phase of trick-play (before the stock is empty) players generally need not follow suit. A widespread game of this type is the [[Marriage group]].\n\n== Bidding ==\n\nIn a ''contract'' game the winning and scoring conditions are not fixed but are chosen by one of the players after seeing their hand. In such games, players make ''bids'' depending on the number of tricks or card points they believe they can win during play of the hand. One or more of these bids stands as the ''contract'', and the player who made that bid is rewarded for meeting it or penalized for not meeting it.\n\nIn ''auction'' games, bidding players are competing against each other for the right to attempt to make the contract. In a few games, the contract is fixed (normally a simple majority, less often based on certain cards captured during play) and players' bids are a wager of game points to be won or lost. In others, the bid is a number of tricks or card points the bidder is confident that they or their partnership will take. Either of these can also include the suit to be used as trumps during the hand. Common bids include slam (winning all the tricks), [[mis\u00e8re]] (losing all the tricks), ouvert (the contractor's hand is exposed), playing without using the stock or only part of it, and winning the last trick or other specific tricks. The highest bid becomes the contract and the highest bidder is the ''contractor'', known in some games as the ''declarer'' or ''taker'', who then plays either with or without a partner. The other players become ''opponents'' or ''defenders'', whose main goal is to prevent the contract being met. They may announce a ''contra'' against the contractor which doubles the points for the hand. The contractor can declare a ''recontra'' which will double the points again.\n\nPopular examples of games with auctions include [[Contract bridge]], [[Pinochle]], [[Tarot card games|tarot games]], [[Skat (card game)|Skat]], [[Belote]] and [[Twenty-eight (card game)|Twenty-Eight]]. In many auction games the eldest hand leads to the first trick, regardless of who won the auction, but in some, such as [[Contract bridge|Contract Bridge]], the first lead is made by the player next in rotation after the contractor, so that the contractor plays last to that trick.\n\nIn ''precision'' or ''exact-prediction'' games, all players choose their winning condition independently: to win precisely a predicted number of tricks ([[Oh Hell]]) or card points ([[Jass|Differenzler]]). Each player's bid stands (in partnership games the partners' bids are often combined), and each player or partnership then tries to take exactly the number of tricks or points they bid, and are rewarded or penalized for doing so independently of anyone else's success or failure in meeting their bid. This type of game began to mature in the 20th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Parlett|1990|pages=311\u2013315}}.</ref> Other games generally falling into the exact-prediction category are [[Spades (card game)|Spades]] and [[Ninety-nine (trick-taking card game)|Ninety-Nine]].\n\n==Trumps==\n''[[Trump (card games)|Trump cards]]'' are a set of one or more cards in the deck that, when played, are of higher value than the suit led. If a trick contains any trump cards, it is won by the highest-value trump card played, not the highest-value card of the suit led.\n\nIn most games with trumps, one of the four suits is identified as the ''trump suit''. In the simplest case, there is a static trump suit such as the Spade suit in the game [[Spades (card game)|Spades]], or a dedicated trump suit in the [[Tarot card games|Tarot]] family (in addition to the other four) is featured. More often, a dynamic trump suit is determined by some means, either randomly by selection of a card as in [[Oh Hell]] and the original form of [[Whist]], or decided by the winner or winning bid of an auction as in [[contract bridge]] and some forms of [[Pinochle]]. In certain games, such as Rowboat and Rage, the trump suit may change during the course of the hand, even from trick to trick. Some psychological variety is added to the game and makes it more difficult to cheat if the trump suit is only chosen after dealing.\n\nIn some games, in addition to or separately from a trump suit, certain fixed cards are always the highest trumps, e.g. the Jacks in [[Skat (card game)|Skat]], the Jacks or Jokers in [[Euchre]], and the Rook Bird card in [[Rook (card game)|Rook]]. They are called ''matadors'' after the high trumps in [[Ombre]]. ''Matadors'' either have high point values or special abilities as in [[Spoil Five]] where they can revoke legally.\n\nSome games have more than one trump suit, such as the quasi-trick game [[Stortok]], in which there are two trumps, with one superseding the other. Other games have no trumps; [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]] for instance has no provision for a trump suit of any kind (the Hearts suit for which the game is named has a different significance). Though trump is part of [[contract bridge]], teams can make bids that do not specify a trump suit, and if that is the winning bid then there is no trump suit for that hand (making such a contract is regarded as harder to accomplish).\n\n==Declarations==\nIn some games such as [[Piquet]], [[Tarocchini]], and [[Belote]], before the taking of tricks commences, players can expose certain cards or [[Meld (cards)|melds]] (combinations) that they possess for bonus points. While this phase may seem to award players for pure chance, those who do declare risk letting their opponents develop strategies to counter the cards that they have revealed.\n\n==Follow suit==\nIn many games, ''following suit'' is the obligatory action of playing a card of the same suit as that of the leading suit. A player must follow suit if that player has cards of the leading suit in his hands. There is a large variation of strictness in following suit among games.<ref>McLeod, John. [https://www.pagat.com/mech.html#followsuit Mechanics of Card Games] at [[pagat.com]]. Retrieved 18 February 2017.</ref>\n\nIn most modern games with trump suits, the rules for following suit do not distinguish between the trump suit and the ''plain suits''. If a trick begins with a plain suit card and a later player cannot follow suit, the player may choose freely to either ''slough'' (discard a card of another plain suit), or ''ruff'' (''trump'' the trick by playing a trump card). Subsequent players to the trick must still follow the original suit, and may only discard or trump if they do not hold a card of the suit led. Certain games are \"play to beat\" or \"must-trump\"; if a player cannot follow suit but can play trump, they must play trump, and additionally if they are able they must beat any trump card already played to the trick. [[Pinochle]] and several of the [[Tarot card games]] have this rule.\n\nSome games, notably [[French Tarot]] and a variation of [[Rook (card game)|Rook]], use a special card (in French Tarot's case, the [[The Fool (Tarot card)|Excuse]]) that can be played at any time. If not, he has the choice of playing a trump to possibly win the trick, or rough (waste) a different suit.\n\nIf unable to follow suit or trump, any card can be played. Each trick must contain one card per player, and hence a player unable to satisfy any other instruction is at liberty to play any card. Usually a low-ranking card or one from a short suit is sacrificed. The former is used to protect a higher ranking card while the latter is to help void a suit so as to allow trumping a future trick.\n\nIt is also possible that the specific deal has \"no trump\". In that case, any card other than the leading suit played has no value, in most trick-taking games. In some games such as [[Oh, hell]], where the player may need to not get more tricks to win, playing cards other than the leading suit can be useful.<ref>McLeod, John. [http://www.pagat.com/exact/ohhell.html Oh Hell!] at [[pagat.com]]. Retrieved 18 February 2017.</ref>\n\nFor example, consider the following [[Whist]] hand:\n:: Trump diamonds {{cards|d}}\n* North: {{cards|As|Ks|4h|9d}}\n* East: {{cards|7s|5d|Qc|10c}}\n* South: {{cards|3h|2d|Jd|Ac}}\n* West: {{cards|5s|2s|6h|5c}}\n\nNorth leads the deal with {{spades|K}}. Now, all the other players must follow suit, i.e. play a spade card. East has a spade card, and thus must follow suit by playing {{spades|7}}. South, however, does not have any spade card, and thus is allowed to play any card he wants. If he desires to win the trick, he can override North's {{spades|K}} by playing a diamond card (diamond being the trump), for example {{diamonds|J}}. If he does not want to win the trick, he can slough any other suit, such as {{hearts|3}}. Let us assume that he plays {{diamonds|J}}, overriding North's card. Now, West still has to follow suit, since he has a spade card, and plays {{spades|2}}. South's trump card, gives him an opportunity to escape following suit, and he wins the trick.\n\nIf a player who can follow suit does not do so, or in games with additional restrictions on card play, not following these restrictions is known as a [[revoke]], or 'renege'. A revoke typically cannot be discovered at the time when it is committed, but when a player plays off-suit to a trick, competent opponents will make a mental note that the player does not hold the suit led, and will notice later if the player later plays a card of the suit they were thought to be void in. The situation is similar for other types of revoke. Most game rules prescribe a severe penalty for a revoke and may also result in the hand being voided (a \"misdeal\"). Decks of cards have been marketed for trick-taking games with the traditional French suit symbols, but in four colors; these are often called [[Four-color deck|\"no-revoke\" decks]], as the color contrast between each suit makes a potential revoking play easier to spot and harder to do accidentally.\n\nIn some trick games\u2014typically ones in which players are not penalized for winning tricks, and there is no requirement for trumping or following suit when possible\u2014players may ''slough'', or play a card face down.  A card so played is incapable of winning the trick; but sloughing has the advantage that the other players cannot see what card is played. As this form of sloughing has the potential to be used to cheat in most games (i.e. playing a winning card face-down to avoid taking an \"overtrick\" or a trick containing penalty points) and is thus not allowed, ''sloughing'' in the vernacular more often refers to simply discarding an off-suit card on a trick, particularly one that could be dangerous to that player if kept. This form of sloughing is important in evasion games and in some contract games where \"overtricks\" are penalized; in [[Oh Hell]], for instance, a player who cannot follow suit may elect to discard a card that would win if played to follow suit later, thus reducing the chance that the player will \"bag\", or take more tricks than needed. This is common in [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]], where high-value cards (especially Spades and Hearts) are dangerous as they increase the chance of winning a trick with penalty points.\n\nSome games such as [[Pinochle]] use several decks shuffled together. In these games, there may be several equal winning cards in a trick; such games then use other rules to break ties. Common rules include:\n* the first-played of the tying cards wins\n* the last-played of the tying cards wins\n* The tying cards cancel each other out, and the trick is taken by the next-highest card that was played.\n* The tying cards cancel each other out, but the trick is spoiled (ignored).\n\nA common additional rule to reduce these occurrences is that a player cannot play a card tying the current high card unless they would renege or fail to overtrump by making any other play.\n\n==Scoring==\nWhen all tricks have been played, the winner of the hand and the players' scores can be determined. The determining factor in plain-trick games (the most popular form of trick-taking games in English-speaking countries) is simply how many tricks each player or partnership has taken. In point-trick games, certain card values are worth varying points, and the players sum the points from cards in their \"scoring piles\" that were accumulated by taking tricks. Points for cards, and the method of counting points, vary by game; in Rook, for example, the 5-card of each color is worth 5 points, the 10 and 14 (or Ace) is worth 10, and the Rook Bird (or Joker) is worth 20, while all other cards are worth nothing. Many Chinese card games like Finding Friends use a very similar system, in which each 5-card is worth 5 points, and the 10 and King are each worth 10 points.<ref>Rules for Chinese trick-taking card game [http://www.zhao-pengyou.com/ \"Finding Friends (Zhao Pengyou)\"]. Retrieved on 7 September 2018.</ref> Pinochle has many popular scoring variants usually based on point values for face cards and Aces, while pip cards score no points. In French Tarot, all cards have a value including a half-point, and are traditionally scored in pairs of a high-value and a low-value card which results in a whole-point value for the pair.\n\nIn the most common ''positive'' or ''race'' games, players seek to win as many tricks or card points as possible. To win a hand, a player typically needs to win a minimal number of tricks or card points; this minimal threshold is usually called the \"contract\", and may be defined by the game's rules (a simple majority of total available points or tricks, or tiered thresholds depending on which player or side has captured certain cards), or the result of an \"auction\" or \"bidding\" process. A player who wins more than the number of tricks or card points necessary for winning the hand may be rewarded with a higher score, or conversely (in exact-prediction games) they may be penalized.\n\nThere are also ''negative'' or ''evasion'' games, in which the object is to avoid tricks or card points. E.g. in Hearts each card point won in a trick contributes negatively to the score. A special type is ''mis\u00e8re'' games, which are usually variants of positive games which can only be won by not winning a single trick.\n\nOther criteria also occur. Sometimes the last trick has special significance. In ''marriage games'' such as Pinochle the winner of the last trick receives 10 points in addition to the card points, while in ''final-trick'' games such as [[c\u1eaft t\u00ea]] only the winner of the last trick can win a hand. There are also blends between positive and negative games, e.g. the aim may be to win a certain prescribed number of tricks. Many card games, regardless of their normal scoring mechanism, give bonuses to players or partnerships who win all tricks or possible points in a hand, or conversely lose all tricks or points.\n\nGames usually end after every player has had an equal chance to be the dealer. The number of rotations varies widely among games. Some games have a cumulative score where all points from each hand add up. Others assign only a set number of game points for winning a hand. For example, a player or side that wins one hand may be awarded one game point, two if they achieve a slam. The player or side with the most game points or the first to reach a certain number of card or game points, is considered the winner.\n\n==Special variations==\n=== Variations to basic rules ===\nNumerous further variations to the basic rules may occur, and only a few examples can be mentioned here:\n* Certain games require the holder of a certain card value to play it as the lead to the first trick of a hand; [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]], as commonly played in North America, requires the player holding the 2{{Clubs}} to play it as the lead-off card. Variants of [[Pinochle]] sometimes require the first player to the left of the dealer that holds a ''dix'' (9{{Clubs}}) to lead off.\n* There may be restrictions on leading certain suits; a common Hearts rule is that a player may not lead a Heart until at least one trick has had a Heart played off-suit to another trick. Spades has a similar but less-common variation regarding its trump suit.\n* There are trick-taking games played with [[Domino]] tiles instead of playing cards. These include the Chinese [[Tien Gow]] and [[42 (dominoes)|Texas 42]]. [[Giog]] is played with [[Xiangqi|Chinese chess]] tiles.\n* Many games are played with one or more ''[[stripped deck]]s'' (a deck from which certain card values are removed). The most common stripped deck is a [[piquet deck]], used for [[piquet]], [[Belote]], [[Skat (card game)|Skat]], [[Euchre]], [[Bezique]] and (with two piquet decks) [[Pinochle]], among others. [[Rook (card game)|Rook]]'s main variant, Kentucky Discard, uses the equivalent of a 52-card deck with all card values 2\u20134 removed. Most regional [[Tarot]] variants, especially Central European and Italian variants like Tarock and Tarocco, use some subset of the \"full\" 78-card Tarot deck.\n* In Bridge the partner of the contractor or ''declarer'' is called ''dummy'' and does not actively participate in the play; dummy's hand is instead laid on the table face-up after the opening lead, and declarer chooses the cards from dummy's hand to play during dummy's turns.\n* In [[Karuta#Unsun Karuta|Hachinin-meri]] and Truf, trumps are played face down. When the trick is finished, the trumps are revealed to see who won the trick.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Depaulis|first1=Thierry|title=Unsun, a Far-eastern Cousin of Ombre|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=1983|volume=12|issue=1|pages=39\u201344}}</ref><ref>McLeod, John. [http://www.pagat.com/exact/truf.html Truf] at [[pagat.com]]. Retrieved 25 January 2016.</ref>\n* In many trumpless games that do not require following suit, sluffing is done face down. This is done in [[Madiao]], [[Tien Gow]], [[Tam c\u00fac]], [[:zh:\u516d\u864e\u724c|Six Tigers]], [[Ganjifa]], [[Kaiserspiel]], and Brazilian [[Truco]].\n* Some cards lose their trick-taking power if they are not led or played in a specific trick as in [[Karn\u00f6ffel]], [[Tien Gow]], and [[Ganjifa]].\n* In [[tarot game]]s played outside of Central Europe, [[The Fool (Tarot card)|the Fool]] is a special card that excuses the player from following suit. Except in rare circumstances in some games, it can neither capture nor be captured. Usually a non-counting card is given as compensation to the trick's winner by the Fool's owner.\n\n=== Rules in Austrian and German games ===\nIn games derived from Austria and Germany, trick-taking is governed by the rules called ''Zw\u00e4nge''. The three main ones are ''Farbzwang'', ''Stichzwang'' and ''Trumpfzwang''. Although they broadly equate to rules in English-speaking countries, there are no single-word equivalents. For many games of this type, applying these rules correctly is crucial to the type of contract being played.\n\n==== ''Farbzwang'' ====\n''Farbzwang'' (or ''Bedienzwang'') literally means \"suit compulsion\" and is the rule that players must follow the suit of the first card to be led to the trick, provided that they have a card of that suit. If a player does not have a card of the led suit, they may play ('discard') a card of their choice. If a player has several cards of the led suit, they may choose which to play. In most cases it makes sense to play a higher ranking card.\n\n==== ''Stichzwang'' ====\n''Stichzwang'' means \"trick compulsion\" and is the rule that players must attempt to win the trick if they are able, either by playing a higher card of the led suit or by playing a trump card.\n\n==== ''Farbzwang'' with ''Stichzwang'' ====\nSome games apply ''Farbzwang'' and ''Stichzwang'' together, which means that a player, when it is his turn, must:\n* take the trick with a higher card of the led suit. If unable to do so, he must\n* discard a lower card of the led suit. If that is not possible, he must\n* take the trick with a trump card, but if that is also not feasible, he may\n* discard a card of his choice.\n\n''Farbzwang'', the requirement to follow suit, always takes precedence over ''Stichzwang''. A player is not allowed to take the trick with a trump if he can follow suit.\n\n==== ''Trumpfzwang'' ====\n''Trumpzwang'' means \"trump compulsion\" and requires that a player ''must'' play a trump if he cannot follow suit. In other words, he may not simply discard, if he cannot follow suit.\n\n''Example'': Acorns are trumps. Forehand plays the 8 of Bells, middlehand trumps with a 10 of Acorns; rearhand has no Bells, but does have a trump card, the 8 of Acorns. He must play this and cannot discard another non-trump card in order to keep the trump for a subsequent trick.\n\n==== ''Tarockzwang'' ====\n''Tarockzwang'' is used in [[tarock game]]s such as [[K\u00f6nigrufen]] and [[Tapp-Tarock]] and means \"Tarock compulsion\" or the requirement to play a Tarock card if one is led to the trick or if a player is unable to follow suit. It is a form of ''Trumpfzwang''.\n\n== Examples ==\n{{Related article|List of Ace-Ten games}}\nTrick-taking games may be divided into point-trick games and plain-trick games. Examples of each are as follows:\n\n=== Point-trick games ===\nPoint-trick game are those in which win or loss is determined by the total value of the \"counters\" in the tricks.<ref name=\"parlett,2008,644\u2013645\">{{harvnb|Parlett|2008|pages=644\u2013645}}.</ref> The counters are cards with a point value, sometimes referred to as \"card points\" to avoid confusion with \"game points\" awarded for winning the game and/or bonuses.\n\nExamples include:\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=20}}\n* [[Bavarian Tarock]]\n* [[Belote]]\n* [[B\u00e9zique]]\n* [[Binokel]]\n* [[Doppelkopf]]\n* [[Jass]]\n* Finding Friends ([[Zhao Pengyou]])\n* [[Schafkopf]]\n* [[Schnapsen]] or [[Sixty-six (card game)|Sixty-six]]\n* [[Skat (card game)|Skat]]\n* [[Tarock]] games ([[French Tarot]], [[K\u00f6nigrufen]], [[Zwanzigerrufen]], etc.)\n* [[Trappola]] (Bulka)\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n=== Plain-trick games ===\nPlain-trick games are those in which the outcome is determined by the number of tricks taken, regardless of their content.<ref name=\"parlett,2008,644\u2013645\"/>\n\nExamples of plain-trick games include:\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=20}}\n* [[Boston (card game)|Boston]]\n* [[Bridge (card game)|Bridge]]\n* [[\u00c9cart\u00e9]]\n* [[Jabberwocky (card game)|Jabberwocky]]\n* [[Ombre]] and [[Quadrille (card game)|Quadrille]]\n* [[Piquet]]\n* [[Pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence]]\n* [[Solo Whist]]\n* [[Tippen]]\n* [[Watten (card game)|Watten]]\n* [[Whist]]\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\nIn games that consist of several successive, different, trick-taking contracts, such as Herzeln or Quodlibet, it is not possible to categorise them as either point- or plain-trick games.\n\n=== Trick-avoidance games ===\nTrick-avoidance games are those in which the aim is to avoid taking certain tricks or to avoid taking all tricks. [[Misere]] or [[Bettel (cards)|bettel]] are contracts in which the declarer undertakes to win no tricks. There are also contracts like [[Piccolo (cards)|Piccolo]] in which the aim is to take only one trick.
