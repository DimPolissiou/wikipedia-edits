It is on the eastern end of [[Lake Ontario]], at the beginning of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and at the mouth of the [[Cataraqui River]] (south end of the [[Rideau Canal]]). The city is midway between [[Toronto]], Ontario and [[Montreal]], Quebec. The [[Thousand Islands]] tourist region is nearby to the east. Kingston is nicknamed the \"Limestone City\" because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local [[limestone]].\n\nGrowing European exploration in the 17th century, and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade, led to the founding of a [[New France|French]] [[trading post]] and military fort at a site known as \"Cataraqui\"  (generally pronounced \"kah-tah-ROCK-way\") in 1673. This outpost, called Fort Cataraqui, and later [[Fort Frontenac]], became a focus for settlement. Since 1760, the site of Kingston, Ontario, was in effective British possession.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Preston |editor1-first=Richard A. |title=Kingston before the War of 1812: A Collection of Documents (Ontario Series) |date=1959 |publisher=The Publications of the Champlain Society |page=37 |url=https://doi.org/10.3138/9781442618503}}</ref> Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort, and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] began settling the region in the 1780s. \n\nKingston was named the first capital of the [[United Province of Canada]] on February 10, 1841.<ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;81</ref> While its time as a capital city was short (ending in 1844), the community has remained an important [[military]] installation.

Support for this is found in a journal entry of a British Army officer in Kingston in 1843. He wrote ''\"Began to skate this year, improved quickly and had great fun at hockey on the ice.\"''<ref name=\"queens\">{{cite web|title=Hockey night in Kingston |url=http://www.queensjournal.ca/article.php?point=vol133/issue11/features/lead1 |accessdate=June 21, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Kingston is also home to the oldest continuing hockey rivalry in the world by virtue of a game played in 1886 on the frozen Kingston harbour between Queen's University and the Royal Military College of Canada. To mark this event, the city hosts an annual game between the two institutions, played on a cleared patch of frozen lake with both teams wearing period-correct uniforms and using rules from that era. The two schools also contest the annual Carr-Harris Cup, named for [[Lorne Carr-Harris]], under modern competitive conditions to commemorate and continue their rivalry.\n\nThe [[Memorial Cup]], which serves as the annual championship event for the [[Canadian Hockey League]], began in 1919 on the initiative of Kingstonian [[James T. Sutherland]]. The first championship was held in Kingston. Sutherland, a member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], also helped establish the annual exhibition game between the Royal Military College of Canada and the [[United States Military Academy]] (West Point) in 1923.\n\nKingston is represented in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL) by the [[Kingston Frontenacs]], and in [[Ontario Junior Hockey League]] (OJHL) by the [[Kingston Voyageurs]]. The Frontenacs general manager is Kingston native [[Doug Gilmour]].\n\nThe [[International Hockey Hall of Fame]], was established in September 1943 with a building constructed in 1965. The original building was near the [[Kingston Memorial Centre]] (which was opened in 1950), but has since been relocated to Kingston's west end at the Invista Centre. The International Hockey Hall of Fame, founded by the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]], is the oldest sports hall of fame in Canada.<ref>Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum, [http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ \u201cAbout the Hall\u201d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053203/http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ |date=November 29, 2014 }}, \"Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum\"</ref> The museum's collection is home to various items that pay homage to Kingston's role in the history of hockey in Canada. These include: the original square hockey puck from the first Queens University vs. the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) game in 1886, hockey's oldest sweater worn by a Queen's student in 1894, and Canada's first Olympic gold medal from 1924, among others.<ref>Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum, [http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/exhibits/top-10-artifacts.html \u201cThe Top 10 Artifacts in the Museum\u201d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053201/http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/exhibits/top-10-artifacts.html |date=November 29, 2014 }}, \"Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum\"</ref>\n\nNew to the city is Leon's Centre, in the downtown core.

The [[Kingston Yacht Club]] in downtown Kingston has a learn to sail program for both children and adults.\n\n===Diving===\nKingston is known for fresh-water [[wreck diving]]. [[List of shipwrecks of Canada#Ontario|Kingston's shipwrecks]] are well preserved by its cool fresh water, and the recent [[zebra mussel]] invasion has caused a dramatic improvement in water clarity that has enhanced the quality of diving in the area.\n\n===Lawn bowling===\nThe Kingston Lawn Bowling Club has been at its location on Napier Street since 1932, although the sport's beginnings in Kingston have been traced back to 1914.<ref>[https://kingstonlawnbowlingclub.weebly.com/about-us.html Kingston Lawn Bowling Club \u2013 About Us] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514141551/http://kingstonlawnbowlingclub.weebly.com/about-us.html |date=May 14, 2016 }} Retrieved November 22, 2018</ref> While the club offers a variety of recreational opportunities, a number of its members have gone on to compete successfully at the provincial level and beyond.

The first winner of the [[Canadian Amateur Championship]] that same year was Kingstonian Thomas Harley, a Scottish immigrant carpenter. Richard H. (Dick) Green, who immigrated to the area from England in the late 1920s, was the longtime club professional for nearly 40 years at [[Cataraqui Golf and Country Club]] (founded in 1917 and redesigned by [[Stanley Thompson]] in 1930). Green also helped design several courses in eastern Ontario, including Smiths Falls (1949), Glen Lawrence (1955), Rideau Lakes (1961), Amherstview (1971), Garrison (1971), Evergreen (1972), Belle Park Fairways (1975), Rivendell (1979), and Colonnade (1984). [[Matt McQuillan]], a professional player on the [[PGA Tour]] for the 2011 and 2012 seasons, was born and raised in Kingston, and developed his game at the [[Garrison Golf and Curling Club]]. McQuillan won the 2005 Telus [[Edmonton]] Open on the [[Canadian Professional Golf Tour]].\n\n===Curling===\nThree curling clubs are in the Kingston area: the Cataraqui Golf & Country Club, Garrison Golf & Curling Club, and the [[Royal Kingston Curling Club]].<ref>[http://www.curlingrink.ca/city.php?city=kingston CurlingRink.ca \u2013 Kingston Curling Clubs and Rinks \u2013 Kingston, Ontario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706174549/http://www.curlingrink.ca/city.php?city=kingston |date=July 6, 2011 }} Retrieved March 2, 2011</ref> The Royal Kingston Curling Club (RKCC) was founded in 1820, and was granted Royal patronage in 1993.

KPRFC is a non-profit organization answering directly to the Eastern Ontario Rugby Union (EORU), the [[Ontario Rugby Union]] (ORU), and [[Rugby Canada]] (RC). The Kingston Panthers R.F.C, recently celebrated their fortieth anniversary with an EORU championship in the Division 1 championship game at [[Twin Elm Rugby Park]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]].\n\n===Football===\nThe earliest known incarnation of an organized football team in Kingston is the [[Kingston Granites]] which played in the predecessor league to the [[Canadian Football League]], the [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]], (ORFU). The team played for four seasons between 1898 and 1901 winning 1 ORFU title in 1899 defeating the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] 8\u20130. Kingston also hosted the [[10th Grey Cup]] on December 2, 1922. The Limestone Grenadiers now represent Kingston and the surrounding area in the OVFL. The Club franchise catchment area draws players from Frontenac, Hastings, Lanark, Leeds, Lennox and Prince Edward counties. League play runs from late May through August. The Junior and Varsity teams' main schedule pits the Grenadiers against eastern Ontario opponents and cross-over games with western Ontario teams leading to a provincial title championship game.\nMany notable football people, CFL, NFL players, coaches and personalities have been associated with Kingston including:\n\n===Volleyball===\n\nThe Kingston Volleyball Club (KVC) was founded in 2015.

It is on the eastern end of [[Lake Ontario]], at the beginning of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and at the mouth of the [[Cataraqui River]] (south end of the [[Rideau Canal]]). The city is midway between [[Toronto]], Ontario and [[Montreal]], Quebec. The [[Thousand Islands]] tourist region is nearby to the east. Kingston is nicknamed the \"Limestone City\" because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local [[limestone]].\n\nGrowing European exploration in the 17th century, and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade, led to the founding of a [[New France|French]] [[trading post]] and military fort at a site known as \"Cataraqui\"  (generally pronounced \"kah-tah-ROCK-way\") in 1673. This outpost, called Fort Cataraqui, and later [[Fort Frontenac]], became a focus for settlement. Since 1760, the site of Kingston, Ontario, was in effective British possession.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Preston |editor1-first=Richard A. |title=Kingston before the War of 1812: A Collection of Documents (Ontario Series) |date=1959 |publisher=The Publications of the Champlain Society |page=37 |url=https://doi.org/10.3138/9781442618503}}</ref> Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort, and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] began settling the region in the 1780s. \n\nKingston was named the first capital of the [[United Province of Canada]] on February 10, 1841.<ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;81</ref> While its time as a capital city was short (ending in 1844), the community has remained an important [[military]] installation.

The resulting explosion spread the fire throughout the city's downtown area, destroying a large number of buildings, including the old city hall. To prevent similar incidents from occurring in future, the city began building with limestone or brick.

Queen's University grew from about 2,000 students in the 1940s to its present size of over 28,000 students, more than 90 per cent of whom are from outside the Kingston area. The Kingston campus of [[St. Lawrence College, Ontario|St. Lawrence College]] was established in 1969, and the college has 6,700 full-time students. The Royal Military College of Canada was founded in 1876, and has about 1,000 students. Kingston is a regional health care centre, anchored by Kingston General Hospital and the medical school at Queen's. The city's economy is also dominated by post-secondary education, military institutions, and prison installations.\n\nMunicipal governance had been a topic of discussion since the mid-1970s due to financial imbalance between the city and the surrounding [[Township (Canada)|townships]], which now had large residential areas and a population approaching that of the city proper. On January 1, 1998, the City was amalgamated with Kingston Township and [[Pittsburgh, Kingston|Pittsburgh Township]] to form the new City of Kingston.

As a result of the report of the ''Commission of Inquiry into Certain Events at the Prison for Women in Kingston'', the facility was closed in 2000. Queen's University purchased the property with the intention of renovating it to house the Queen's Archives, but the interior of the building was awarded a heritage designation; therefore, Queen's lost the ability to renovate the interior and is considering its options.\n\nIn September 2013, after almost 180 years of housing prisoners, Kingston Penitentiary closed. The maximum security prison was named a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in February 1990 due to its history and reputation. In its early years, the prison had a vital role in constructing the city. The prison brought prosperity to Kingston, and along with eight other prisons being built in the area, helped create an impressive local economy.<ref>Steve Cameron, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/kingston-penitentiary-closes-its-doors-as-canadas-most-famous-prison/article14598900/?page=all \"Kingston Penitentiary: Canada's most famous prison closes its doors\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071218/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/kingston-penitentiary-closes-its-doors-as-canadas-most-famous-prison/article14598900/?page=all |date=March 4, 2016 }}, ''The Globe and Mail'', September 29, 2013</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\nKingston is within the [[Mixedwood Plains Ecozone (Canada)|Mixedwood Plains Ecozone]], and is dominated in the Kingston area by a mixture of [[deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] tree species and abundant water resources.<ref>[http://ecozones.ca/english/zone/MixedwoodPlains/land.html Ecological Framework of Canada \u2013 Mixedwood Plains Ecozone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315210334/http://ecozones.ca/english/zone/MixedwoodPlains/land.html |date=March 15, 2016 }}.

To mark this event, the city hosts an annual game between the two institutions, played on a cleared patch of frozen lake with both teams wearing period-correct uniforms and using rules from that era. The two schools also contest the annual Carr-Harris Cup, named for [[Lorne Carr-Harris]], under modern competitive conditions to commemorate and continue their rivalry.\n\nThe [[Memorial Cup]], which serves as the annual championship event for the [[Canadian Hockey League]], began in 1919 on the initiative of Kingstonian [[James T. Sutherland]]. The first championship was held in Kingston. Sutherland, a member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], also helped establish the annual exhibition game between the Royal Military College of Canada and the [[United States Military Academy]] (West Point) in 1923.\n\nKingston is represented in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL) by the [[Kingston Frontenacs]], and in [[Ontario Junior Hockey League]] (OJHL) by the [[Kingston Voyageurs]]. The Frontenacs general manager is Kingston native [[Doug Gilmour]].\n\nThe [[International Hockey Hall of Fame]], was established in September 1943 with a building constructed in 1965. The original building was near the [[Kingston Memorial Centre]] (which was opened in 1950), but has since been relocated to Kingston's west end at the Invista Centre. The International Hockey Hall of Fame, founded by the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]], is the oldest sports hall of fame in Canada.<ref>Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum, [http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ \u201cAbout the Hall\u201d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053203/http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ |date=November 29, 2014 }}, \"Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum\"</ref> The museum's collection is home to various items that pay homage to Kingston's role in the history of hockey in Canada.

The department store chain [[Stern's]], a division of Federated, ceased operations in 2001 and most of its stores became Macy's stores.  In 2003, Federated changed the nameplates of almost all their non-Macy's stores \u2014 the lone exception was Bloomingdales \u2014 to include the Macy's name, a rebranding internally dubbed Project Hyphen. For example, [[Seattle]]-based [[The Bon March\u00e9]] became Bon-Macy's; Goldsmith's in [[Tennessee]] became Goldsmith's-Macy's; Lazarus, Burdines, and Rich's also added \"-Macy's\" to their name. A year later, the hyphenated names were changed to simply Macy's, a rebranding process referred internally to as Project Star.\n\nIn 1998, Federated settled an [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] investigation for $14.46 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US|14460000|1998|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) due to unethical debt-collection practices. Federated routinely forced credit card holders/debtors to sign an agreement that legally bound them to repay their outstanding balances instead of having the unsecured debt discharge via the filing of [[bankruptcy]]. Federated failed to file reaffirmation agreements with bankruptcy courts. As a result, the changes in the agreements were not legally binding.<ref>\"Federated Settles for Millions,\" ''BCD News and Comment''. Vol. 32:1.

This news came after a gradual pulling out of the Cincinnati area with a couple of area store closures and the retirement of a top executive.\n\n===2005&ndash;2006: Acquisition of May===\n[[File:Macy's Inc.svg|thumb|Former Macy's, Inc logo, until 2019]]\n[[File:Federatedlogo.png|thumb|left|200px|The former Federated Department Stores logo, in use until 2007.]]\nOn July 18, 2005, [[Federated Department Stores]] announced that it would acquire [[May Department Stores]] company for $11 billion (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US|11000000000|2005|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) in cash and stock. Also part of the buyout was the bridal and formal unit of May, consisting of [[David's Bridal]] and [[After Hours Formalwear]]. Federated would also assume $6 billion (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US|6000000000|2005|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) of May's debt, bringing total consideration to $17 billion (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US|17000000000|2005|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}). The deal would create the nation's largest department store chain with over 1,000 stores and $30 billion (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US|30000000000|2005|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) in annual sales. To help finance the deal, Federated agreed to sell its combined proprietary credit card business (but still administered by FACS Group, a subsidiary of Federated) to Citigroup. The merger was completed on August 30, 2005, after an assurance agreement was reached with the Attorneys General of [[New York State|New York]], [[California]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Maryland]] and [[Pennsylvania]].\n\nAs a result of the merger, Federated also in the process reacquired two of their former department store chains Foley's & Filene's (Which Federated originally sold to May Company), putting them back under the Federated Department Stores corporate umbrella for the first time since 1988.\n\nFederated announced plans to sell 80 store locations in 2006, having pledged in its settlement to sell most of them as viable businesses, with preference being given to a group of thirteen competitors. This number could fluctuate pursuant to Federated's negotiations with various mall landlords and its final decision regarding using former Macy locations for its luxury [[Bloomingdale's]] operation.\n\nOn January 12, 2006, Federated announced its plans to divest May Company's [[Lord & Taylor]] division (48 stores in 12 states) by the end of 2006 after utilizing prime and conflicting real estate by closing and converting several locations. On June 22, 2006, Macy's announced that [[NRDC Equity Partners]], LLC would purchase [[Lord & Taylor]] for US$1.2 billion (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US|1200000000|2006|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}), and completed the sale in October 2006.\n\nOn September 9, 2006, the former May Company store names [[Famous-Barr]], [[Filene's]], [[Foley's]], [[Kaufmann's]], [[Hecht's]], [[The Jones Store]], [[L. S. Ayres]], [[Marshall Field's]], [[Meier & Frank]], [[Robinsons-May]], and [[Strawbridge's]] disappeared as Federated switched most of them to the [[Macy's]] masthead and a few to the Bloomingdale's name. The conversion of Marshall Field's in Chicago was particularly criticized, with many customers boycotting its historic State Street flagship store. The [[Chicago Tribune]] continues to report on the poor reception of Macy's in Chicago. Pittsburgh customers also strongly resisted the name change from Kaufmann's, in part because of the [[edgar J. Kaufmann|Kaufmann family]] role in Pittsburgh history, as well as the central store's Christmas windows and holiday parade.\n\nOne of the consequences of this [[rebranding]] is that several malls have two Macy's stores. In downtown Boston, Federated liquidated an acquired Filene's because it already had a Macy's (formerly a Jordan Marsh) across the street. The two stores have a combined floorspace of more than {{convert|1400000|sqft|m2}}, more than two-thirds the size of Macy's New York City flagship store.\n\nOn November 17, 2006, the bridal and formal unit was sold. David's Bridal and Priscilla of Boston were sold to [[Leonard Green & Partners]]. After Hours Formalwear was sold to [[Men's Wearhouse]].<ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7B1129F724-5EEA-43BC-9EA9-DCBEE75093EC%7D&siteid=google&sid=8455&symb= Federated Agrees to Sell Bridal Group], Federated Department Stores, Inc., November 17, 2006.</ref>\n\n===2007&ndash;present: Operations as Macy's, Inc.===\nOn February 27, 2007, Federated announced that its board of directors would ask shareholders to change the company's name to '''Macy's Group, Inc.''' By March 28, the company revised its plans for the new name, opting to eventually become Macy's, Inc. Federated shareholders approved the revised proposal during the company's annual meeting on May 18, 2007.<ref>http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070518/federated_macy_s.html?.v=1\n</ref> The company was previously known as Federated Retail Holdings, Inc.\n\nThe name took effect on June 1, 2007.  Reasoning for the proposed name change, according to [[Terry Lundgren]], Federated's chairman, president and chief executive officer \u2014 hinges on the large-scale conversions throughout the company toward the Macy's nameplate. \"Today, we are a brand-driven company focused on Macy's and Bloomingdale's, not a federation of department stores,\" Lundgren said in the company's press release heralding the proposed name.<ref>[http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=84477&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=967632&highlight= Federated Plans Corporate Name Change]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Federated Department Stores, February 27, 2007.</ref>  Upon the change to Macy's Inc., Federated's stock ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange changed from \"FD\" to \"M\", making the new Macy's Inc. one of a handful of single-letter [[ticker symbol]] companies.<ref>[http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070328/federated_name.html Federated Plans 'M' Stock Ticker], AP, March 28, 2007.</ref>\n\nIn April, 2008, Moody's Investors Service said that it may downgrade Macy's Inc. bonds to just above junk status.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Moody's may downgrade Macy's on weak credit|url = http://www.marketwatch.com/story/moodys-may-downgrade-macys-on-weak-credit|website = MarketWatch|accessdate = 2015-05-24|first = Wallace|last = Witkowski}}</ref> That same month, Fitch Ratings downgraded their ratings to BBB- from BBB, noting a deterioration in the company's operating and credit metrics.

This new localization strategy is known as \"My Macy's.\"\n\nEmployees of the Macy's North headquarters office in [[Minneapolis]], the Macy's Northwest headquarters office in [[Seattle]], and the Macy's Midwest headquarters office in [[St. Louis]] were given [[Termination of employment#Pink slip|pink slips]], as Macy's pared its seven regional centers to four. About 40 new jobs were to be created in May as part of the restructuring. By 2009, the company expected to save $100 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US|100000000|2009|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) a year from the cuts.\n\nOn February 2, 2009, Macy's announced the elimination of 7,000 jobs, or 4% of its work force, and slashed its dividend as it looked to lower expenses as part of major restructuring.\n[[Cincinnati]]-based Macy's Inc. said the work force reduction includes positions in offices, stores and other locations. The cuts will include some unfilled jobs. \n\"Reducing our workforce is an unfortunate outcome of the current economic environment, and I am frustrated that so many of our people will be unable to move forward with us as we proceed into a very exciting future for Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale's\" said [[Terry J. Lundgren]], chairman, president and chief executive officer. \"\n\nMacy's also got rid of its division structure and integrated its functions into one organization. Macy's central buying, merchandise planning, stores senior management and marketing functions merged to its [[New York City]] corporate office (formerly [[Macy's East]]). Corporate-related business functions, such as finance and human resources, will be primarily in Cincinnati. To buy with local consumers in mind, Macy's developed a concept called \"My Macy's\", in which the buyers and planners all look at what the local consumer base is looking for in their local Macy's store.  This will help bring a better sense of branding, sizing, and marketing to each Macy's store nationwide.\n\nMacy's Inc. decided to close the Bloomingdale's at the [[Mall of America]] in [[Minnesota]]. Since 1994, Bloomingdale's had been one of the 4 anchor stores of the mall, and will be replaced with a $30 million renovation with four new foreign clothing stores.\n\nOn October 14, 2013, Macy's Inc. announced the decision to open most of their stores for the first time on [[Thanksgiving Day]] 2013, breaking a long-standing tradition of 155 years, and joined the ranks of retailers who created [[Gray Thursday]] the year before. Its doors opened at 8 p.m. (local time) on the holiday evening, and remained open for 24 hours straight until the close of business on Friday, which is usually about 10 p.m.<ref>{{cite news|title=Most Macy's stores will open at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/10/14/macys-thanksgiving/2978757/|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=October 15, 2013|first1=Hadley|last1=Malcolm|date=October 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{As of| February 2014}}, Macy's Inc. is valued at US$28 billion.<ref name=\"Macy's Sets Strategy to Keep Momentum\">{{cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/retail-news/department-stores/macys-sets-strategy-to-keep-momentum-7511220?src=nl/mornReport/20140226 | title=Macy's Sets Strategy to Keep Momentum | publisher=WWD | date=February 26, 2014 | accessdate=February 26, 2014 | author=Moin, David}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2015 Macy's announced it would close 40 stores, 5% of its total stores in early 2016.

(originally '''Federated Department Stores, Inc.''') is an American [[holding company]] founded by Xavier Warren in 1929. Upon its establishment, Federated held ownership of the regional [[department store]] chains [[Abraham & Straus]], [[Lazarus (department store)|Lazarus]], [[Filene's]], and [[John Shillito Company|Shillito's]]. [[Bloomingdale's]] joined Federated Department Stores the following year. Throughout its early history, frequent acquisitions and divestitures saw the company operate a number of nameplates. In 1994, Federated took over the department store chain [[Macy's]].  With the acquisition of [[The May Department Stores Company]] in 2005, the regional nameplates were retired and replaced by the Macy's and Bloomingdale's brands nationwide by 2006. Ultimately, Federated itself was renamed Macy's, Inc. in 2007.\n\nMacy's, Inc. is headquartered in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]. It operates the subsidiaries Macy's, Bloomingdale's, and the beauty store chain [[Bluemercury]], all of which have a [[Flagship#Retailing|flagship store]] located in the [[New York City]] borough of [[Manhattan]]. As of November, 2019, the company operated 871 stores in the [[United States]], [[Guam]], and [[Puerto Rico]].<ref name=storecount>{{cite web |url=https://www.macysinc.com/about/store-count-and-square-footage |title=Store Count and Square Footage |publisher=Macy's, Inc.}}</ref> Its namesake locations and related operations account for 90% of its revenue. According to [[Deloitte]], Macy's, Inc. is the world's largest fashion goods retailer and the 36th largest retailer overall, based on the company's reported 2010 retail sales revenue of $25 billion (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US|25000000000|2010|r=0}}}} in {{inflation/year|US}}).<ref>Deloitte, ''Switching Channels: Global Powers of Retailing 2012'', January 2012, at pp. G11 and G27.</ref>\n\n==History==\n===1929&ndash;2005: Operations as Federated===\nFederated Department Stores traces its corporate lineage to [[Lazarus (department store)|F&R Lazarus & Company]], founded in Columbus, Ohio, in 1851. On November 25, 1929, Federated was founded by Xavier Warren in Columbus as a department store [[holding company]] for Lazarus (including its Cincinnati division, then known as [[Shillito's]]), [[Abraham & Straus]], and [[Filene's|William Filene's Sons]] of Boston.

As well, Lazarus convinced President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] that it would help American economy to change the [[Thanksgiving]] holiday from the last Thursday of November to the fourth Thursday, thus extending the Christmas shopping season. An act of Congress perpetuated the arrangement in 1941. [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] became a nationwide sensation and the most profitable day for Federated.

The department store chain [[Stern's]], a division of Federated, ceased operations in 2001 and most of its stores became Macy's stores.  In 2003, Federated changed the nameplates of almost all their non-Macy's stores \u2014 the lone exception was Bloomingdales \u2014 to include the Macy's name, a rebranding internally dubbed Project Hyphen. For example, [[Seattle]]-based [[The Bon March\u00e9]] became Bon-Macy's; Goldsmith's in [[Tennessee]] became Goldsmith's-Macy's; Lazarus, Burdines, and Rich's also added \"-Macy's\" to their name. A year later, the hyphenated names were changed to simply Macy's, a rebranding process referred internally to as Project Star.\n\nIn 1998, Federated settled an [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] investigation for $14.46 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US|14460000|1998|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) due to unethical debt-collection practices. Federated routinely forced credit card holders/debtors to sign an agreement that legally bound them to repay their outstanding balances instead of having the unsecured debt discharge via the filing of [[bankruptcy]]. Federated failed to file reaffirmation agreements with bankruptcy courts. As a result, the changes in the agreements were not legally binding.<ref>\"Federated Settles for Millions,\" ''BCD News and Comment''. Vol. 32:1.

This news came after a gradual pulling out of the Cincinnati area with a couple of area store closures and the retirement of a top executive.\n\n===2005&ndash;2006: Acquisition of May===\n[[File:Macy's Inc.svg|thumb|Former Macy's, Inc logo, until 2019]]\n[[File:Federatedlogo.png|thumb|left|200px|The former Federated Department Stores logo, in use until 2007.]]\nOn July 18, 2005, [[Federated Department Stores]] announced that it would acquire [[May Department Stores]] company for $11 billion (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US|11000000000|2005|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) in cash and stock. Also part of the buyout was the bridal and formal unit of May, consisting of [[David's Bridal]] and [[After Hours Formalwear]]. Federated would also assume $6 billion (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US|6000000000|2005|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) of May's debt, bringing total consideration to $17 billion (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US|17000000000|2005|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}). The deal would create the nation's largest department store chain with over 1,000 stores and $30 billion (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US|30000000000|2005|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) in annual sales. To help finance the deal, Federated agreed to sell its combined proprietary credit card business (but still administered by FACS Group, a subsidiary of Federated) to Citigroup. The merger was completed on August 30, 2005, after an assurance agreement was reached with the Attorneys General of [[New York State|New York]], [[California]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Maryland]] and [[Pennsylvania]].\n\nAs a result of the merger, Federated also in the process reacquired two of their former department store chains Foley's & Filene's (Which Federated originally sold to May Company), putting them back under the Federated Department Stores corporate umbrella for the first time since 1988.\n\nFederated announced plans to sell 80 store locations in 2006, having pledged in its settlement to sell most of them as viable businesses, with preference being given to a group of thirteen competitors. This number could fluctuate pursuant to Federated's negotiations with various mall landlords and its final decision regarding using former Macy locations for its luxury [[Bloomingdale's]] operation.\n\nOn January 12, 2006, Federated announced its plans to divest May Company's [[Lord & Taylor]] division (48 stores in 12 states) by the end of 2006 after utilizing prime and conflicting real estate by closing and converting several locations. On June 22, 2006, Macy's announced that [[NRDC Equity Partners]], LLC would purchase [[Lord & Taylor]] for US$1.2 billion (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US|1200000000|2006|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}), and completed the sale in October 2006.\n\nOn September 9, 2006, the former May Company store names [[Famous-Barr]], [[Filene's]], [[Foley's]], [[Kaufmann's]], [[Hecht's]], [[The Jones Store]], [[L. S. Ayres]], [[Marshall Field's]], [[Meier & Frank]], [[Robinsons-May]], and [[Strawbridge's]] disappeared as Federated switched most of them to the [[Macy's]] masthead and a few to the Bloomingdale's name. The conversion of Marshall Field's in Chicago was particularly criticized, with many customers boycotting its historic State Street flagship store. The [[Chicago Tribune]] continues to report on the poor reception of Macy's in Chicago. Pittsburgh customers also strongly resisted the name change from Kaufmann's, in part because of the [[edgar J. Kaufmann|Kaufmann family]] role in Pittsburgh history, as well as the central store's Christmas windows and holiday parade.\n\nOne of the consequences of this [[rebranding]] is that several malls have two Macy's stores. In downtown Boston, Federated liquidated an acquired Filene's because it already had a Macy's (formerly a Jordan Marsh) across the street. The two stores have a combined floorspace of more than {{convert|1400000|sqft|m2}}, more than two-thirds the size of Macy's New York City flagship store.\n\nOn November 17, 2006, the bridal and formal unit was sold. David's Bridal and Priscilla of Boston were sold to [[Leonard Green & Partners]]. After Hours Formalwear was sold to [[Men's Wearhouse]].<ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7B1129F724-5EEA-43BC-9EA9-DCBEE75093EC%7D&siteid=google&sid=8455&symb= Federated Agrees to Sell Bridal Group], Federated Department Stores, Inc., November 17, 2006.</ref>\n\n===2007&ndash;present: Operations as Macy's, Inc.===\nOn February 27, 2007, Federated announced that its board of directors would ask shareholders to change the company's name to '''Macy's Group, Inc.'''

Reasoning for the proposed name change, according to [[Terry Lundgren]], Federated's chairman, president and chief executive officer \u2014 hinges on the large-scale conversions throughout the company toward the Macy's nameplate. \"Today, we are a brand-driven company focused on Macy's and Bloomingdale's, not a federation of department stores,\" Lundgren said in the company's press release heralding the proposed name.<ref>[http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=84477&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=967632&highlight= Federated Plans Corporate Name Change]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Federated Department Stores, February 27, 2007.</ref>  Upon the change to Macy's Inc., Federated's stock ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange changed from \"FD\" to \"M\", making the new Macy's Inc. one of a handful of single-letter [[ticker symbol]] companies.<ref>[http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070328/federated_name.html Federated Plans 'M' Stock Ticker], AP, March 28, 2007.</ref>\n\nIn April, 2008, Moody's Investors Service said that it may downgrade Macy's Inc. bonds to just above junk status.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Moody's may downgrade Macy's on weak credit|url = http://www.marketwatch.com/story/moodys-may-downgrade-macys-on-weak-credit|website = MarketWatch|accessdate = 2015-05-24|first = Wallace|last = Witkowski}}</ref> That same month, Fitch Ratings downgraded their ratings to BBB- from BBB, noting a deterioration in the company's operating and credit metrics.

This new localization strategy is known as \"My Macy's.\"\n\nEmployees of the Macy's North headquarters office in [[Minneapolis]], the Macy's Northwest headquarters office in [[Seattle]], and the Macy's Midwest headquarters office in [[St. Louis]] were given [[Termination of employment#Pink slip|pink slips]], as Macy's pared its seven regional centers to four. About 40 new jobs were to be created in May as part of the restructuring. By 2009, the company expected to save $100 million (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US|100000000|2009|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) a year from the cuts.\n\nOn February 2, 2009, Macy's announced the elimination of 7,000 jobs, or 4% of its work force, and slashed its dividend as it looked to lower expenses as part of major restructuring.\n[[Cincinnati]]-based Macy's Inc. said the work force reduction includes positions in offices, stores and other locations. The cuts will include some unfilled jobs. \n\"Reducing our workforce is an unfortunate outcome of the current economic environment, and I am frustrated that so many of our people will be unable to move forward with us as we proceed into a very exciting future for Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale's\" said [[Terry J. Lundgren]], chairman, president and chief executive officer. \"\n\nMacy's also got rid of its division structure and integrated its functions into one organization. Macy's central buying, merchandise planning, stores senior management and marketing functions merged to its [[New York City]] corporate office (formerly [[Macy's East]]). Corporate-related business functions, such as finance and human resources, will be primarily in Cincinnati. To buy with local consumers in mind, Macy's developed a concept called \"My Macy's\", in which the buyers and planners all look at what the local consumer base is looking for in their local Macy's store.

The '''Triple Alliance''' was an agreement between [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]], and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. It was formed on 20 May 1882<ref name=\"Grenville\"/> and renewed periodically until it expired in 1915 during [[Diplomatic history of World War I|World War I]]. Germany and Austria-Hungary had been [[dual Alliance (1879)|closely allied]] since 1879.  Italy was looking for support against France shortly after it lost North African ambitions to the French.  Each member promised mutual support in the event of an attack by any other [[great power]].  The treaty provided that Germany and Austria-Hungary were to assist Italy if it was attacked by France without provocation.  In turn, Italy would assist Germany if attacked by France. In the event of a war between Austria-Hungary and Russia, Italy promised to remain neutral. The existence and membership of the treaty were well known, but its exact provisions were kept secret until 1919.\n\nWhen the treaty was renewed in February 1887, Italy gained an empty promise of German support of Italian colonial ambitions in North Africa in return for Italy's continued friendship. Austria-Hungary had to be pressured by German chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] into accepting the principles of consultation and mutual agreement with Italy on any territorial changes initiated in the Balkans or on the coasts and islands of the Adriatic and Aegean seas. Italy and Austria-Hungary did not overcome their basic conflict of interest in that region despite the treaty.  In 1891 attempts were made to join Britain to the Triplice, which, though unsuccessful, were widely believed to have succeeded in Russian diplomatic circles.<ref name=\"Kennan\">{{Cite book |author=George Frost Kennan |title=The Fateful Alliance: France, Russia, and the Coming of the First World War |date=1984 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-1707-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fatefulalliance00geor/page/82 82\u201386] |url=https://archive.org/details/fatefulalliance00geor/page/82 }}</ref>\n\nShortly after renewing the Alliance in June 1902, Italy secretly extended a similar guarantee to France.<ref name=\"Seymour\">{{cite book|title = The Diplomatic Background of the War|url = https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.189309|author = Charles Seymour|publisher = [[Yale University Press]]|year = 1916|pages = [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.189309/page/n55 35], 147}}</ref> By a particular agreement, neither Austria-Hungary nor Italy would change the [[status quo]] in the [[Balkans]] without previous consultation.{{efn|group=lower-alpha|\"However, if, in the course of events, the maintenance of the status quo in the regions of the Balkans or of the Ottoman coasts and islands in the Adriatic and in the Aegean Sea should become impossible, and if, whether in consequence of the action of a third Power or otherwise, Austria-Hungary or Italy should find themselves under the necessity of modifying it by a temporary or permanent occupation on their part, this occupation shall take place only after a previous agreement between the two Powers, based upon the principle of a reciprocal compensation for every advantage, territorial or other, which each of them might obtain beyond the present status quo, and giving satisfaction to the interests and well founded claims of the two Parties.\"<ref name=\"Grenville\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q99JAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA38#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Major International Treaties of the Twentieth Century: A History and Guide with Texts |editor1-last=Grenville |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Wasserstein |editor2-first=Bernard |publisher=Routledge |date=2013 |accessdate=2 March 2014 |page=38 |isbn=9780415141253}}</ref>}} On 18 October 1883 [[Carol I of Romania]], through his Prime Minister [[Ion C.

At the time, most European countries tried to ensure similar guarantees, and because of the Tunisian crisis, Italy found no other big potential ally than its historical enemy, Austria-Hungary, against which Italy had fought three wars in the 34 years before the first treaty signing.{{efn|group=lower-alpha|The [[First Italian War of Independence|First]], [[Second Italian War of Independence|Second]] and [[Third Italian War of Independence|Third]] Italian Wars of Independence.}}\n\nHowever, Italian public opinion remained unenthusiastic about their country's alignment with Austria-Hungary, a past enemy of [[Italian unification]], and whose [[Italian people|Italian]] populated districts in the [[Trentino]] and [[Istria]] were seen as occupied territories by [[Italian irredentism|Italian irredentists]]. In the years before [[World War I]], many distinguished military analysts predicted that Italy would attack its supposed ally in the event of a large scale conflict.

It was formed on 20 May 1882<ref name=\"Grenville\"/> and renewed periodically until it expired in 1915 during [[Diplomatic history of World War I|World War I]]. Germany and Austria-Hungary had been [[dual Alliance (1879)|closely allied]] since 1879.  Italy was looking for support against France shortly after it lost North African ambitions to the French.  Each member promised mutual support in the event of an attack by any other [[great power]].  The treaty provided that Germany and Austria-Hungary were to assist Italy if it was attacked by France without provocation.  In turn, Italy would assist Germany if attacked by France. In the event of a war between Austria-Hungary and Russia, Italy promised to remain neutral. The existence and membership of the treaty were well known, but its exact provisions were kept secret until 1919.\n\nWhen the treaty was renewed in February 1887, Italy gained an empty promise of German support of Italian colonial ambitions in North Africa in return for Italy's continued friendship. Austria-Hungary had to be pressured by German chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] into accepting the principles of consultation and mutual agreement with Italy on any territorial changes initiated in the Balkans or on the coasts and islands of the Adriatic and Aegean seas. Italy and Austria-Hungary did not overcome their basic conflict of interest in that region despite the treaty.  In 1891 attempts were made to join Britain to the Triplice, which, though unsuccessful, were widely believed to have succeeded in Russian diplomatic circles.<ref name=\"Kennan\">{{Cite book |author=George Frost Kennan |title=The Fateful Alliance: France, Russia, and the Coming of the First World War |date=1984 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-1707-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fatefulalliance00geor/page/82 82\u201386] |url=https://archive.org/details/fatefulalliance00geor/page/82 }}</ref>\n\nShortly after renewing the Alliance in June 1902, Italy secretly extended a similar guarantee to France.<ref name=\"Seymour\">{{cite book|title = The Diplomatic Background of the War|url = https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.189309|author = Charles Seymour|publisher = [[Yale University Press]]|year = 1916|pages = [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.189309/page/n55 35], 147}}</ref> By a particular agreement, neither Austria-Hungary nor Italy would change the [[status quo]] in the [[Balkans]] without previous consultation.{{efn|group=lower-alpha|\"However, if, in the course of events, the maintenance of the status quo in the regions of the Balkans or of the Ottoman coasts and islands in the Adriatic and in the Aegean Sea should become impossible, and if, whether in consequence of the action of a third Power or otherwise, Austria-Hungary or Italy should find themselves under the necessity of modifying it by a temporary or permanent occupation on their part, this occupation shall take place only after a previous agreement between the two Powers, based upon the principle of a reciprocal compensation for every advantage, territorial or other, which each of them might obtain beyond the present status quo, and giving satisfaction to the interests and well founded claims of the two Parties.\"<ref name=\"Grenville\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q99JAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA38#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Major International Treaties of the Twentieth Century: A History and Guide with Texts |editor1-last=Grenville |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Wasserstein |editor2-first=Bernard |publisher=Routledge |date=2013 |accessdate=2 March 2014 |page=38 |isbn=9780415141253}}</ref>}} On 18 October 1883 [[Carol I of Romania]], through his Prime Minister [[Ion C.

Born in the [[Electorate of Hanover]], Herschel followed his father into the Military Band of Hanover, before migrating to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in 1757 at the age of nineteen.\n\nHerschel constructed his first large telescope in 1774, after which he spent nine years carrying out sky surveys to investigate double stars. Herschel published catalogues of [[nebula]]e in 1802 (2,500 objects) and in 1820 (5,000 objects). The resolving power of the Herschel telescopes revealed that many objects called nebulae in the [[Messier object|Messier catalogue]] were actually clusters of stars. On 13 March 1781 while making observations he made note of a new object in the constellation of Gemini. This would, after several weeks of verification and consultation with other astronomers, be confirmed to be a new planet, eventually given the name of [[Uranus]]. This was the first planet to be discovered since antiquity and Herschel became famous overnight. As a result of this discovery, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] appointed him Court Astronomer. He was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] and grants were provided for the construction of new telescopes.\n\nHerschel pioneered the use of [[Astronomical spectroscopy|astronomical spectrophotometry]], using prisms and temperature measuring equipment to measure the wavelength distribution of stellar spectra. In the course of these investigations, Herschel discovered [[Infrared|infrared radiation]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Herschel discovers infrared light |url=http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/classroom_activities/herschel_bio.html |website=Cool Cosmos |accessdate=6 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225094516/http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/classroom_activities/herschel_bio.html |archive-date=25 February 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\nOther work included an improved determination of the rotation period of [[Mars]],<ref name=\"Copus\"/> the discovery that the Martian polar caps vary seasonally, the discovery of [[Titania (moon)|Titania]] and [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]] (moons of Uranus) and [[Enceladus]] and [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] (moons of [[Saturn]]). Herschel was made a Knight of the [[Royal Guelphic Order]] in 1816. He was the first [[President of the Royal Astronomical Society]] when it was founded in 1820. He died in August 1822, and his work was continued by his only son, [[John Herschel]].\n\n==Early life and musical activities==\nHerschel was born in the [[Electorate of Hanover]] in Germany, then part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], one of ten children of Isaac Herschel by his marriage to Anna Ilse Moritzen, of German Lutheran ancestry. His Jewish descent is acknowledged by his biographer, [[Edward S. Holden]], and it is also indicated by the fact that his grandfather was named Abraham, his father Isaac, and his eldest brother Jacob. His father's family traced its roots back to [[Jews]] from [[Moravia]].

At the time the crowns of [[kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]] were [[personal union|united]] under [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. As the threat of war with France loomed, the Hanoverian Guards were recalled from England to defend Hanover.

Caroline has been referred to as a bitter, jealous woman who worshipped her brother and resented her sister-in-law for invading her domestic life. With the arrival of Mary, Caroline lost her managerial and social responsibilities in the household, and with them much of her status. Caroline destroyed her journals between the years 1788 to 1798, so her feelings during this period are not entirely known. According to her memoir, Caroline then moved to separate lodgings, but continued to work as her brother's assistant. When her brother and his family were away from their home, she would often return to take care of it for them. In later life, Caroline and Lady Herschel exchanged affectionate letters.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCaroline continued her astronomical work after William's death in 1822. She worked to verify and confirm his findings as well as putting together catalogues of nebulae. Towards the end of her life, she arranged two-and-a-half thousand nebulae and star clusters into zones of similar polar distances. She did this so that her nephew, John, could re-examine them systematically.

Optician [[John Dollond]] (1706\u20131761) tried to correct for this distortion by combining two separate lenses, but it was still difficult to achieve good resolution for far distant light sources.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n\n[[Reflecting telescope|Reflector telescopes]], invented by [[Isaac Newton]] in 1668, used a single [[concave mirror]] rather than a convex lens. This avoids chromatic aberration. The concave mirror gathered more light than a lens, reflecting it onto a flat mirror at the end of the telescope for viewing. A smaller mirror could provide greater magnification and a larger field of view than a convex lens. Newton's first mirror was 1.3 inches in diameter; such mirrors were rarely more than 3 inches in diameter.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n\nBecause of the poor reflectivity of mirrors made of [[speculum metal]], Herschel eliminated the small diagonal mirror of a standard [[newtonian reflector]] from his design and tilted his primary mirror so he could view the formed image directly. This \"front view\" design has come to be called the [[Herschelian telescope]].<ref name=\"Maurer\">{{cite journal |last1=Maurer |first1=A. |last2=Forbes |first2=E.

The [[40-foot telescope]] was, at that time, the largest [[scientific instrument]] that had been built. It was hailed as a triumph of \"human perseverance and zeal for the sublimest science\".<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"Lubbock\"/>{{rp|215}}\n\nIn 1785 Herschel approached King George for money to cover the cost of building the 40-foot telescope.

As it was, it took five years, and went over budget.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n\nThe Herschel home in Slough became a scramble of \"labourers and workmen, smiths and carpenters\".<ref name=\"Distillations\"/> A 40-foot telescope tube had to be cast of iron. The tube was large enough to walk through. Mirror blanks were poured from [[Speculum metal]], a mix of [[copper]] and [[tin]]. They were almost four feet in diameter and weighed 1,000 pounds. When the first disk deformed due to its weight, a second thicker one was made with a higher content of copper. The mirrors had to be hand polished, a painstaking process. A mirror was repeatedly put into the telescope and removed again to ensure that it was properly formed. When a mirror deformed or tarnished, it had to be removed, repolished and replaced in the apparatus. A huge rotating platform was built to support the telescope, enabling it to be repositioned by assistants as a sweep progressed. A platform near the top of the tube enabled the viewer to look down into the tube and view the resulting image.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"Greenwich\">{{cite web |title=40-foot Herschelian (reflector) telescope tube remains \u2013 National Maritime Museum |url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/11109.html |website=Royal Museums Greenwich |accessdate=5 June 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:PIA06256 Mimas full view.jpg|thumb|Saturn orbiter's view of Mimas]]\nIn 1789, shortly after this instrument was operational, Herschel discovered a new [[Moons of Saturn#Table of known moons|moon]] of [[Saturn]]: [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], only 250 miles in diameter.{{sfn |Holmes |2008 |pp=190}} Discovery of a second moon ([[Enceladus]]) followed, within the first month of observation.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"Mimas\"/><ref name=\"Enceladus\"/>\n\nThe 40-foot telescope proved very cumbersome, and in spite of its size, not very effective at showing clearer images.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/> Herschel's technological innovations had taken him to the limits of what was possible with the technology of his day.

Born in the [[Electorate of Hanover]], Herschel followed his father into the Military Band of Hanover, before migrating to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in 1757 at the age of nineteen.\n\nHerschel constructed his first large telescope in 1774, after which he spent nine years carrying out sky surveys to investigate double stars. Herschel published catalogues of [[nebula]]e in 1802 (2,500 objects) and in 1820 (5,000 objects). The resolving power of the Herschel telescopes revealed that many objects called nebulae in the [[Messier object|Messier catalogue]] were actually clusters of stars. On 13 March 1781 while making observations he made note of a new object in the constellation of Gemini. This would, after several weeks of verification and consultation with other astronomers, be confirmed to be a new planet, eventually given the name of [[Uranus]]. This was the first planet to be discovered since antiquity and Herschel became famous overnight. As a result of this discovery, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] appointed him Court Astronomer. He was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] and grants were provided for the construction of new telescopes.\n\nHerschel pioneered the use of [[Astronomical spectroscopy|astronomical spectrophotometry]], using prisms and temperature measuring equipment to measure the wavelength distribution of stellar spectra. In the course of these investigations, Herschel discovered [[Infrared|infrared radiation]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Herschel discovers infrared light |url=http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/classroom_activities/herschel_bio.html |website=Cool Cosmos |accessdate=6 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225094516/http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/classroom_activities/herschel_bio.html |archive-date=25 February 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\nOther work included an improved determination of the rotation period of [[Mars]],<ref name=\"Copus\"/> the discovery that the Martian polar caps vary seasonally, the discovery of [[Titania (moon)|Titania]] and [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]] (moons of Uranus) and [[Enceladus]] and [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] (moons of [[Saturn]]). Herschel was made a Knight of the [[Royal Guelphic Order]] in 1816. He was the first [[President of the Royal Astronomical Society]] when it was founded in 1820. He died in August 1822, and his work was continued by his only son, [[John Herschel]].\n\n==Early life and musical activities==\nHerschel was born in the [[Electorate of Hanover]] in Germany, then part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], one of ten children of Isaac Herschel by his marriage to Anna Ilse Moritzen, of German Lutheran ancestry. His Jewish descent is acknowledged by his biographer, [[Edward S. Holden]], and it is also indicated by the fact that his grandfather was named Abraham, his father Isaac, and his eldest brother Jacob. His father's family traced its roots back to [[Jews]] from [[Moravia]].

In 1755 the Hanoverian Guards regiment, in whose band Wilhelm and his brother Jakob were engaged as oboists, was ordered to England. At the time the crowns of [[kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]] were [[personal union|united]] under [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. As the threat of war with France loomed, the Hanoverian Guards were recalled from England to defend Hanover. After they were defeated at the [[Battle of Hastenbeck]], Herschel's father Isaak sent his two sons to seek refuge in England in late 1757.

With the arrival of Mary, Caroline lost her managerial and social responsibilities in the household, and with them much of her status. Caroline destroyed her journals between the years 1788 to 1798, so her feelings during this period are not entirely known. According to her memoir, Caroline then moved to separate lodgings, but continued to work as her brother's assistant.

She worked to verify and confirm his findings as well as putting together catalogues of nebulae.

Optician [[John Dollond]] (1706\u20131761) tried to correct for this distortion by combining two separate lenses, but it was still difficult to achieve good resolution for far distant light sources.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n\n[[Reflecting telescope|Reflector telescopes]], invented by [[Isaac Newton]] in 1668, used a single [[concave mirror]] rather than a convex lens. This avoids chromatic aberration. The concave mirror gathered more light than a lens, reflecting it onto a flat mirror at the end of the telescope for viewing. A smaller mirror could provide greater magnification and a larger field of view than a convex lens. Newton's first mirror was 1.3 inches in diameter; such mirrors were rarely more than 3 inches in diameter.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n\nBecause of the poor reflectivity of mirrors made of [[speculum metal]], Herschel eliminated the small diagonal mirror of a standard [[newtonian reflector]] from his design and tilted his primary mirror so he could view the formed image directly. This \"front view\" design has come to be called the [[Herschelian telescope]].<ref name=\"Maurer\">{{cite journal |last1=Maurer |first1=A. |last2=Forbes |first2=E.

When the first disk deformed due to its weight, a second thicker one was made with a higher content of copper. The mirrors had to be hand polished, a painstaking process. A mirror was repeatedly put into the telescope and removed again to ensure that it was properly formed. When a mirror deformed or tarnished, it had to be removed, repolished and replaced in the apparatus.

When Thomsen and Andreasen analyzed samples locally from places uncontaminated by modern farming, they found that the range of Sr isotopic values in the surrounding natural environment matched those in the girl. Thus, it is most plausible that she originated from and spent her entire life in the Egtved area, and did not come far abroad, as proposed by Frei et ''al''. Thomsen and Andreasen's results show that the girl did live about half the year in one area \u2013 likely the river valley in Egtved \u2013 and the other half of the year in another place \u2013 likely the local plateau, perhaps in the practice of [[transhumance]] farming and seasonal pastoral movement within a small area.\n\nIn a 2019 article based on strontium isotope analysis, Sophie Bergerbrant suggests an origin of Sweden or Norway for the Egtved Girl.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://gup.ub.gu.se/file/207811|title= Revisiting the Egtved Girl|last= Bergebrant|first= Sophie|date= 2019|website= Gothenburg University library website|publisher= NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet, Institutt for arkeologi og kulturhistorie og Museumsforlaget|access-date= 2019-11-17|quote=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[H\u00e5ga mound]]\n*[[Haraldsk\u00e6r Woman]]\n*[[Skrydstrup Woman]]\n*[[The King's Grave]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Egtved Girl.gif|Replica of the Egtved Girl's outfit.\nImage:Mummy with fur - The Danish National Museum.jpg|Remains of the Egtved Girl.\nImage:Egtvedpigensgrav.jpg|The reconstructed barrow.\nImage:Egtved Girls museum.jpg|Egtved Girl's museum.\n</gallery>\n\n==Footnotes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*Barber, E.W.

It was sealed and transported to the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in Copenhagen, where it was opened, revealing the Egtved Girl.\n\nIn the coffin, the girl was wrapped in an ox hide. She wore a loose [[bodice]] with sleeves reaching the elbow. She had a bare waist and wore a short string skirt. She had bronze bracelets, and a woolen belt with a large disc decorated with spirals and a spike. At her feet were the cremated remains of a child aged 5 to 6. By her head there was a small [[birch bark]] box that contained an [[stitching awl|awl]], bronze pins, and a [[hair net]].\n\nBefore the coffin was closed she was covered with a blanket and an ox hide. Flowering [[yarrow]] (indicating a summer burial) and a bucket of beer made of wheat, honey, [[bog-myrtle]] and [[cowberry|cowberries]] were placed atop. Her distinctive outfit, which caused a sensation when it was unearthed in the 1920s, is the best preserved example of a style now known to be common in northern Europe during the [[Bronze Age]]. The good preservation of the Egtved Girl is due to the acidic bog conditions of the soil, which is a common condition of this locale.<ref>{{cite news |author= |agency= |title=Remains of Bronze-Age Cultic Priestess Hold Surprise |url=http://www.livescience.com/50911-bronze-age-danish-burial.html |quote=The girl's final resting place was first unearthed in 1921, in a large burial mound made of peat bog. |newspaper=[[LiveScience]] |date=May 21, 2015 |accessdate=2015-05-31 }}</ref>\n\n== Reconstruction ==\nThe outfit was reconstructed for the [[National Museum of Denmark]] by the [[Lejre Experimental Centre]] and is on display there. A reconstructed set of clothes, as well as details of the excavation, are on display in the Egtved Girl's museum at the excavation site.\n\n== Origin and life ==\nInitial work by Frei et al in 2015, since contradicted, examined [[chemical isotope]]s of strontium (Sr) from the Egtved Girl's teeth, fingernails, hair & clothing, and based on these, proposed that she had likely come from [[Schwarzwald|the Black Forest]] region of Germany, but married and moved to Denmark, subsequently traveling back and forth between the two areas.<ref name=\"Margarita\">{{cite journal|last1=Margarita Frei|first1=Karin|last2=Mannering|first2=Ulla|last3=Kristiansen|first3=Kristian|last4=Allentoft|first4=Morten E.|last5=Wilson|first5=Andrew S.|last6=Skals|first6=Irene|last7=Tridico|first7=Silvana|last8=Louise Nosch|first8=Marie|last9=Willerslev|first9=Eske|last10=Clarke|first10=Leon|last11=Frei|first11=Robert|title=Tracing the dynamic life story of a Bronze Age Female|journal=Scientific Reports|date=21 May 2015|volume=5|pages=10431|doi=10.1038/srep10431|pmid=25994525|pmc=4440039}}</ref> \n\nHowever, Thomsen and Andreasen (2019)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thomsen|first=Erik|last2=Andreasen|first2=Rasmus|date=13 March 2019|title=Agricultural lime disturbs natural strontium isotope variations: Implications for provenance and migration studies|journal=Science Advances|volume=5|issue=3|pages=eaav8083|doi=10.1126/sciadv.aav8083|pmid=30891501|pmc=6415960}}</ref> later demonstrated that the Sr isotopic data obtained from the area in which the girl's remains were found, which were used by Frei et ''al.'' for comparison with the data from her remains & personal effects had been contaminated by added Sr from [[agricultural lime]], due to modern farming in the Egtved area. When Thomsen and Andreasen analyzed samples locally from places uncontaminated by modern farming, they found that the range of Sr isotopic values in the surrounding natural environment matched those in the girl. Thus, it is most plausible that she originated from and spent her entire life in the Egtved area, and did not come far abroad, as proposed by Frei et ''al''. Thomsen and Andreasen's results show that the girl did live about half the year in one area \u2013 likely the river valley in Egtved \u2013 and the other half of the year in another place \u2013 likely the local plateau, perhaps in the practice of [[transhumance]] farming and seasonal pastoral movement within a small area.\n\nIn a 2019 article based on strontium isotope analysis, Sophie Bergerbrant suggests an origin of Sweden or Norway for the Egtved Girl.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://gup.ub.gu.se/file/207811|title= Revisiting the Egtved Girl|last= Bergebrant|first= Sophie|date= 2019|website= Gothenburg University library website|publisher= NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet, Institutt for arkeologi og kulturhistorie og Museumsforlaget|access-date= 2019-11-17|quote=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[H\u00e5ga mound]]\n*[[Haraldsk\u00e6r Woman]]\n*[[Skrydstrup Woman]]\n*[[The King's Grave]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Egtved Girl.gif|Replica of the Egtved Girl's outfit.\nImage:Mummy with fur - The Danish National Museum.jpg|Remains of the Egtved Girl.\nImage:Egtvedpigensgrav.jpg|The reconstructed barrow.\nImage:Egtved Girls museum.jpg|Egtved Girl's museum.\n</gallery>\n\n==Footnotes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*Barber, E.W.
