A major breakthrough came in 2000 with the findings of Mayr and Keele. They conducted several experiments. In the first experiment, the main goal was to prove the existence of standard backward inhibition. The tasks given related to following sets of commands on a computer associated with four rectangles found in the middle of a black screen of varying sizes and colors, each set encompassing multiple commands. The first set of commands had to do with the rectangles' color and the second set with their size, and the third set again with their color. They found that for tasks A, B, and C, the response times for the third task will be slower in the case of an A-B-A sequence than a C-B-A sequence.\n\nThe second experiment was similar, but they included four different possible sets of commands instead of two, as well as other means designed to limit the possibility of negative priming. The results confirmed that the inhibitory process is not the result of priming. The third experiment was designed to confirm whether [[top-down processing]] or [[bottom-up processing]] is responsible for backward inhibition. In the top-down scenario, participants had to rely on verbal commands to complete the task with the rectangles, activating top-down processing. In the bottom-up scenario, participants weren't given any commands to complete the task. They had to completely rely on their own observations and sense to choose the right rectangles, activation bottom-up processing. It was found that backward inhibition relies on top-down processing. The fourth experiment found that backward inhibition contributes at least partly to the shift costs between tasks, even when they are repeated many times. In the fifth and last experiment, it was tested whether knowing that the first task would be repeated after the second task would effect the response times of the participants. It was found that foreknowledge of the task changes and repetitions didn't change the presence of backward inhibition.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Backward inhibition and rumination=== \nSome evidence suggests that individuals who commonly [[Rumination (psychology)|ruminate]] have difficulty with backward inhibition. In a study conducted at Stanford University, Whitmer and Gotlib tested the \"role of rumination\" in backward inhibition and specifically in major depressive disorders. With a large control group and a large experimental group, they found that the rate at which someone switches from one task to another has little to do with depression and more to do with rumination. This suggests that rumination somehow prevents backward inhibition from taking place.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0027474|title=Switching and backward inhibition in major depressive disorder: The role of rumination|year=2012|last1=Whitmer|first1=Anson J.|last2=Gotlib|first2=Ian H.|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=121|issue=3|pages=570\u2013578|pmid=22468767}}</ref>\n\n===In hearing===\n\u2192Backward inhibition seems to exist but not as clearly as it does in vision.

Born in [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], he studied [[classical sculpture]] and used this to develop a complete Renaissance style in sculpture, whose periods in Rome, [[Padua]] and [[Siena]] introduced to other parts of Italy a long and productive career. He worked with stone, bronze, wood, clay, stucco and wax, and had several assistants, with four perhaps being a typical number.

Brunelleschi's buildings and Donatello's sculptures are both considered supreme expressions of the spirit of this era in architecture and sculpture, and they exercised a potent influence upon the artists of the age.\n\n==Work in Florence==\n[[File:Sangiovannievangelista.jpg|thumb|In 1409\u20131411 he executed the colossal seated figure of ''Saint John the Evangelist''.]]\n[[File:Donatello david plaster replica head and shoulders front right 1000px wide.jpg|thumb|Donatello ''David'' head and shoulders front right]]\nIn Florence, Donatello assisted [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] with the statues of prophets for the north door of the [[Baptistery of Florence Cathedral]], for which he received payment in November 1406 and early 1408. In 1409\u20131411 he executed the colossal seated figure of ''Saint John the Evangelist'', which until 1588 occupied a niche of the old cathedral fa\u00e7ade, and is now placed in the [[Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Florence)|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]].

In 1417 he completed the ''Saint George'' for the [[Confraternity]] of the Cuirass-makers.  The elegant ''St. George and the Dragon'' relief on the statue's base, executed in schiacciato (a very low [[bas-relief]]) is one of the first examples of [[one-point perspective]] in sculpture. From 1423 is the ''[[Saint Louis of Toulouse (Donatello)|Saint Louis of Toulouse]]'' for the Orsanmichele, now in the Museum of the [[Basilica di Santa Croce]].  Donatello had also sculpted the classical frame for this work, which remains, while the statue was moved in 1460 and replaced by the ''[[Incredulity of Saint Thomas]]'' by [[Verrocchio]].\n\nBetween 1415 and 1426, Donatello created five statues for the [[Campanile di Giotto|campanile]] of [[Santa Maria del Fiore]] in Florence, also known as the [[Duomo]].  These works are the ''Beardless Prophet''; ''Bearded Prophet'' (both from 1415); the ''Sacrifice of Isaac'' (1421); ''[[Statue of Habacuc|Habbakuk]]'' (1423\u201325); and ''Jeremiah'' (1423\u201326); which follow the classical models for orators and are characterized by strong portrait details.  From the late teens is the ''[[Pazzi Madonna]]'' relief in [[Berlin]].  In 1425, he executed the notable ''Crucifix'' for [[Santa Croce, Florence|Santa Croce]]; this work portrays Christ in a moment of the agony, eyes and mouth partially opened, the body contracted in an ungraceful posture.\n\nFrom 1425 to 1427, Donatello collaborated with [[Michelozzo]] on the funerary monument of the [[Antipope John XXIII]] for the [[Baptistery|Battistero]] in Florence.  Donatello made the recumbent bronze figure of the deceased, under a shell. In 1427, he completed in [[Pisa]] a marble relief for the [[Tomb of Cardinal Rainaldo Brancacci|funerary monument of Cardinal Rainaldo Brancacci]] at the church of [[Sant'Angelo a Nilo]] in [[Naples]]. In the same period, he executed the relief of the ''[[The Feast of Herod (Donatello)|Feast of Herod]]'' and the statues of ''Faith'' and ''Hope'' for the [[Baptistery of San Giovanni, Siena|Baptistery of San Giovanni in Siena]]. The relief is mostly in ''[[stiacciato]]'', with the foreground figures are done in bas-relief.\n\n==Major commissions in Florence==\n[[Image:Florence - David by Donatello.jpg|thumb|left|[[David (Donatello)|''David'']] at [[Bargello]], Florence]]\nThe dating of the statue{{clarify|date=August 2019}} is not settled, though recent scholarship has indicated it was made around 1460.

The two works that testify to his presence in this city, the ''Tomb of Giovanni Crivelli'' at [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli|Santa Maria ''in Aracoeli'']], and the ''Ciborium'' at [[St. Peter's Basilica]], bear a strong stamp of classical influence.\n\nDonatello's return to Florence almost coincided with Cosimo's. In May 1434, he signed a contract for the marble pulpit on the facade of [[Prato cathedral]], the last project executed in collaboration with [[Michelozzo]]. This work, a passionate, pagan, rhythmically conceived bacchanalian dance of half-nude putti, was the forerunner of the great ''Cantoria'', or singing tribune, at the Duomo in Florence on which Donatello worked intermittently from 1433 to 1440 and was inspired by ancient sarcophagi and Byzantine ivory chests. In 1435, he executed the ''Annunciation'' for the Cavalcanti altar in Santa Croce, inspired by 14th-century iconography, and in 1437\u20131443, he worked in the Old Sacristy of the [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze|San Lorenzo]] in Florence, on two doors and lunettes portraying saints, as well as eight stucco tondoes. From 1438 is the wooden statue of [[St. John the Baptist]] for [[Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari]] in Venice. Around 1440, he executed a bust of a ''Young Man with a Cameo'' now in the Bargello, the first example of a lay bust portrait since the classical era.\n\n==In Padua==\n[[Image:Gattamelata.jpg|thumb|150px|Donatello's [[equestrian statue]] of [[Erasmo of Narni|Gattamelata]] at [[Padua]]]]\n\nIn 1443, Donatello was called to [[Padua]] by the heirs of the famous [[Condottieri|condottiero]] [[Erasmo da Narni]] (better known as the ''Gattamelata'', or \"Honey-Cat\"), who had died that year. Completed in 1450 and placed in the square facing the [[Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua|Basilica of St. Anthony]], his ''[[Equestrian Monument of Gattamelata]]''  was the first example of such a monument since ancient times. (Other equestrian statues, from the 14th century, had not been executed in bronze and had been placed over tombs rather than erected independently, in a public place.) This work became the prototype for other equestrian monuments executed in Italy and Europe in the following centuries.\n\nFor the Basilica of St. Anthony, Donatello created, most famously, the bronze Crucifix of 1444\u201347 and additional statues for the choir, including a ''Madonna with Child'' and six saints, constituting a [[Sacra Conversazione|Holy Conversation]], which is no longer visible since the renovation by [[Camillo Boito]] in 1895. The ''Madonna with Child'' portrays the Child being displayed to the faithful, on a throne flanked by two [[sphinx]]es, allegorical figures of knowledge. On the throne's back is a relief of Adam and Eve. During this period\u20141446\u201350\u2014Donatello also executed four extremely important reliefs with scenes from the life of St. Anthony for the high altar.\n\n==Main works==\n* ''[[St. Mark (Donatello)|St. Mark]]'' (1411\u20131413), [[Orsanmichele]], Florence\n* ''St. George Tabernacle'' (c. 1415\u20131417) \u2013 [[Museo Nazionale del Bargello]], Florence\n* ''[[Statue of Habacuc|Prophet Habakkuk]]'' (1423\u20131425) \u2013 [[Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Florence)|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]], Florence\n* ''[[The Feast of Herod (Donatello)|The Feast of Herod]]'' (c. 1425) \u2013 [[Baptismal font]], [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Siena)|Baptistry of San Giovanni]], [[Siena]]\n* ''[[Donatello's David|David]]'' (c. 1425\u20131430) \u2013 Museo Nazionale del Bargello, Florence\n* ''Madonna of the Clouds'' (c. 1425\u20131435) marble relief, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]\n* ''[[Equestrian Monument of Gattamelata]]'' (1445\u20131450) \u2013 Piazza del Santo, [[Padua]]\n* ''[[Magdalene Penitent]]'' (c. 1455) \u2013 Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence\n* ''[[Judith and Holofernes (Donatello)|Judith and Holofernes]]'' (1455\u20131460) \u2013 [[Palazzo Vecchio]], Florence\n* ''[[Virgin and Child with Four Angels (Donatello)|Virgin and Child with Four Angels]]'' or ''[[Chellini Madonna]]'' (1456), [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Donatello,_Uzzano,_Bargello.jpeg|''Bust of [[Niccolo da Uzzano]]'' by Donatello in Museo Nazionale del Bargello, Florence, Italy.\nFile:Donatello, maria maddalena 03.JPG|''[[Magdalene Penitent]]'' (c. 1455) \u2013 Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence.\nFile:San giovanni evangelista di donatello 03.JPG|The head of ''Saint John the Evangelist'', 1408-1415 which until 1588 occupied a niche of the old cathedral fa\u00e7ade, and is now placed in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo.\n</gallery>\n\n==In popular culture==\nDonatello is portrayed by [[Ben Starr (actor)|Ben Starr]] in the 2016 television series ''[[Medici: Masters of Florence]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medici: Masters of Florence|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5057130/|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=24 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]] in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] is named after him.\n\nThe ''Donatello'' [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module]] (MPLM) built by the [[Italian Space Agency]], was one of three MPLMs operated by [[NASA]] to transfer supplies and equipment to and from the [[International Space Station]]. The others were named ''[[Leonardo MPLM|Leonardo]]'' and ''[[Raffaello MPLM|Raffaello]]''.\n\n==Discovery==\nIn 2020 thanks to Gianluca Amato art historian, who did the doctoral thesis at the University of Naples Federico II on the wooden crucifixes between the late thirteenth and the first half of the sixteenth century, with studies he discovered that the crucifix of the church of Sant'Angelo a Legnaia is of the hand of Donatello.\nThis discovery has been historically evaluated considering that the work belonged to the Compagnia di Sant'Agostino which was based in the oratory adjacent to the mother church of Sant'Angelo a Legnaia. The promoters of the research were Don Moreno Bucalossi and Anna Bisceglia functionary and historian of the art of the superintendence who in 2012 considered the work worthy of study and restoration. Silvia Bens\u00ec took care of the restoration that brought the work that has now returned to its home to its former glory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lanazione.it/firenze/cultura/donatello-crocifisso-ritrovato-restauro-giuditta-oloferne-palazzo-vecchio-1.5058823|title=\"Quel crocifisso ligneo \u00e8 di Donatello\", la sensazionale scoperta a Firenze|last=MUGNAINI|first=OLGA|date=1583507238961|website=La Nazione|language=it|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adnkronos.com/cultura/2020/03/06/studioso-scopre-crocifisso-inedito-donatello_D6ikj4DDnZLdbSnwmW8GTI.html|title=Studioso scopre Crocifisso inedito di Donatello|website=Adnkronos|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.qaeditoria.it/(X(1)S(n1sjsot2ie2dsjaeaksesp5s))/details.aspx?idarticle=118822&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1|title=E|last=Salzano|first=Marco Pipolo & Guido|website=QAeditoria.it - QA turismo cultura & arte|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.isolottolegnaia.it/crocifisso-donatello-nella-chiesa-legnaia-la-storia/|title=Crocifisso di Donatello nella chiesa di Legnaia, la storia|date=2020-03-06|website=Isolotto Legnaia Firenze|language=it-IT|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>\n[[File:Il Cristo di Sant&#039;Angelo di Legnaia.jpg|thumb|Il Cristo di Sant&#039;Angelo di Legnaia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{EB1911|wstitle=Donatello|volume=8|pages=406\u2013408}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Avery, Charles, ''Donatello: An Introduction'', New York, 1994.\n* Avery, Charles, ''Donatello.

Born in [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], he studied [[classical sculpture]] and used this to develop a complete Renaissance style in sculpture, whose periods in Rome, [[Padua]] and [[Siena]] introduced to other parts of Italy a long and productive career. He worked with stone, bronze, wood, clay, stucco and wax, and had several assistants, with four perhaps being a typical number. Though his best-known works were mostly statues in the round, he developed a new, very shallow, type of [[bas-relief]] for small works, and a good deal of his output was larger architectural reliefs.\n\n==Early life==\n[[Image:Siena.Duomo.Donatello.JohnBaptist0.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Statue of ''St. John the Baptist'' in the Duomo di Siena]]\nDonatello was the son of Niccol\u00f2 di Betto Bardi, who was a member of the Florentine [[Arte della Lana]], and was born in Florence, probably in the year 1386.

Brunelleschi's buildings and Donatello's sculptures are both considered supreme expressions of the spirit of this era in architecture and sculpture, and they exercised a potent influence upon the artists of the age.\n\n==Work in Florence==\n[[File:Sangiovannievangelista.jpg|thumb|In 1409\u20131411 he executed the colossal seated figure of ''Saint John the Evangelist''.]]\n[[File:Donatello david plaster replica head and shoulders front right 1000px wide.jpg|thumb|Donatello ''David'' head and shoulders front right]]\nIn Florence, Donatello assisted [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] with the statues of prophets for the north door of the [[Baptistery of Florence Cathedral]], for which he received payment in November 1406 and early 1408. In 1409\u20131411 he executed the colossal seated figure of ''Saint John the Evangelist'', which until 1588 occupied a niche of the old cathedral fa\u00e7ade, and is now placed in the [[Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Florence)|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]].  This work marks a decisive step forward from late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] [[Mannerism]] in the search for naturalism and the rendering of human feelings.<ref>Janson, ''The Sculpture of Donatello'', Princeton, 1963.</ref> The face, the shoulders and the bust are still idealized, while the hands and the fold of cloth over the legs are more realistic.\n\nIn 1411\u20131413, Donatello worked on a statue of ''[[St. Mark (Donatello)|St. Mark]]'' for the [[guild]] church of [[Orsanmichele]].

This work became the prototype for other equestrian monuments executed in Italy and Europe in the following centuries.\n\nFor the Basilica of St. Anthony, Donatello created, most famously, the bronze Crucifix of 1444\u201347 and additional statues for the choir, including a ''Madonna with Child'' and six saints, constituting a [[Sacra Conversazione|Holy Conversation]], which is no longer visible since the renovation by [[Camillo Boito]] in 1895. The ''Madonna with Child'' portrays the Child being displayed to the faithful, on a throne flanked by two [[sphinx]]es, allegorical figures of knowledge. On the throne's back is a relief of Adam and Eve. During this period\u20141446\u201350\u2014Donatello also executed four extremely important reliefs with scenes from the life of St. Anthony for the high altar.\n\n==Main works==\n* ''[[St. Mark (Donatello)|St. Mark]]'' (1411\u20131413), [[Orsanmichele]], Florence\n* ''St. George Tabernacle'' (c. 1415\u20131417) \u2013 [[Museo Nazionale del Bargello]], Florence\n* ''[[Statue of Habacuc|Prophet Habakkuk]]'' (1423\u20131425) \u2013 [[Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Florence)|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]], Florence\n* ''[[The Feast of Herod (Donatello)|The Feast of Herod]]'' (c. 1425) \u2013 [[Baptismal font]], [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Siena)|Baptistry of San Giovanni]], [[Siena]]\n* ''[[Donatello's David|David]]'' (c. 1425\u20131430) \u2013 Museo Nazionale del Bargello, Florence\n* ''Madonna of the Clouds'' (c. 1425\u20131435) marble relief, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]\n* ''[[Equestrian Monument of Gattamelata]]'' (1445\u20131450) \u2013 Piazza del Santo, [[Padua]]\n* ''[[Magdalene Penitent]]'' (c. 1455) \u2013 Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence\n* ''[[Judith and Holofernes (Donatello)|Judith and Holofernes]]'' (1455\u20131460) \u2013 [[Palazzo Vecchio]], Florence\n* ''[[Virgin and Child with Four Angels (Donatello)|Virgin and Child with Four Angels]]'' or ''[[Chellini Madonna]]'' (1456), [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Donatello,_Uzzano,_Bargello.jpeg|''Bust of [[Niccolo da Uzzano]]'' by Donatello in Museo Nazionale del Bargello, Florence, Italy.\nFile:Donatello, maria maddalena 03.JPG|''[[Magdalene Penitent]]'' (c. 1455) \u2013 Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence.\nFile:San giovanni evangelista di donatello 03.JPG|The head of ''Saint John the Evangelist'', 1408-1415 which until 1588 occupied a niche of the old cathedral fa\u00e7ade, and is now placed in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo.\n</gallery>\n\n==In popular culture==\nDonatello is portrayed by [[Ben Starr (actor)|Ben Starr]] in the 2016 television series ''[[Medici: Masters of Florence]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medici: Masters of Florence|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5057130/|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=24 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]] in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] is named after him.\n\nThe ''Donatello'' [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module]] (MPLM) built by the [[Italian Space Agency]], was one of three MPLMs operated by [[NASA]] to transfer supplies and equipment to and from the [[International Space Station]]. The others were named ''[[Leonardo MPLM|Leonardo]]'' and ''[[Raffaello MPLM|Raffaello]]''.\n\n==Discovery==\nIn 2020 thanks to Gianluca Amato art historian, who did the doctoral thesis at the University of Naples Federico II on the wooden crucifixes between the late thirteenth and the first half of the sixteenth century, with studies he discovered that the crucifix of the church of Sant'Angelo a Legnaia is of the hand of Donatello.\nThis discovery has been historically evaluated considering that the work belonged to the Compagnia di Sant'Agostino which was based in the oratory adjacent to the mother church of Sant'Angelo a Legnaia. The promoters of the research were Don Moreno Bucalossi and Anna Bisceglia functionary and historian of the art of the superintendence who in 2012 considered the work worthy of study and restoration. Silvia Bens\u00ec took care of the restoration that brought the work that has now returned to its home to its former glory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lanazione.it/firenze/cultura/donatello-crocifisso-ritrovato-restauro-giuditta-oloferne-palazzo-vecchio-1.5058823|title=\"Quel crocifisso ligneo \u00e8 di Donatello\", la sensazionale scoperta a Firenze|last=MUGNAINI|first=OLGA|date=1583507238961|website=La Nazione|language=it|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adnkronos.com/cultura/2020/03/06/studioso-scopre-crocifisso-inedito-donatello_D6ikj4DDnZLdbSnwmW8GTI.html|title=Studioso scopre Crocifisso inedito di Donatello|website=Adnkronos|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.qaeditoria.it/(X(1)S(n1sjsot2ie2dsjaeaksesp5s))/details.aspx?idarticle=118822&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1|title=E|last=Salzano|first=Marco Pipolo & Guido|website=QAeditoria.it - QA turismo cultura & arte|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.isolottolegnaia.it/crocifisso-donatello-nella-chiesa-legnaia-la-storia/|title=Crocifisso di Donatello nella chiesa di Legnaia, la storia|date=2020-03-06|website=Isolotto Legnaia Firenze|language=it-IT|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>\n[[File:Il Cristo di Sant&#039;Angelo di Legnaia.jpg|thumb|Il Cristo di Sant&#039;Angelo di Legnaia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{EB1911|wstitle=Donatello|volume=8|pages=406\u2013408}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Avery, Charles, ''Donatello: An Introduction'', New York, 1994.\n* Avery, Charles, ''Donatello.

The film was directed by [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]], and stars the regular television cast of [[Dan Castellaneta]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Yeardley Smith]], [[Hank Azaria]], [[Harry Shearer]], [[Tress MacNeille]], [[Pamela Hayden]], [[Russi Taylor]], and [[Albert Brooks]]. The film follows [[Homer Simpson]], who irresponsibly pollutes the lake in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] after the town has cleaned it up, causing the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] to imprison the town under a giant dome. After he and [[Simpson family|his family]] narrowly manage to escape, they ultimately abandon Homer for his selfishness, and he works to redeem his folly by stopping Russ Cargill, the head of the EPA, from destroying Springfield.\n\nAlthough previous attempts to create a ''Simpsons'' film had been made, they all failed due to the lack of a script of appropriate length and production crew members. Eventually in 2001, producers [[James L. Brooks]], [[Matt Groening]], [[Al Jean]], [[Richard Sakai]] and [[Mike Scully]] began development of the film and a writing team consisting of Brooks, Groening, Jean, Scully, [[Ian Maxtone-Graham]], [[George Meyer]], [[David Mirkin]], [[Mike Reiss]], [[Matt Selman]], [[John Swartzwelder]] and [[Jon Vitti]] was assembled. They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening's being the one developed into a film. The script was rewritten over a hundred times, with rewrites continuing after work on the animation began in 2006. Consequently, hours of finished material was cut from the final release, including [[cameo appearance|cameo roles]] from [[Erin Brockovich]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Isla Fisher]], [[Kelsey Grammer]] and [[Edward Norton]]. [[Tom Hanks]] and the members of [[Green Day]] voice their own animated counterparts in the final cut of the film, while Albert Brooks, a frequent guest performer on the series, provides the voice of the villain Cargill.\n\n[[Tie-in]] promotions were made with several companies to promote the film's release, including [[Burger King]] and [[7-Eleven]], the latter of which [[Kwik-E-Mart#7-Eleven promotion|transformed selected stores]] into [[Kwik-E-Mart]]s. The film premiered in [[Springfield, Vermont]] on July 21, 2007 and was released theatrically six days later by [[20th Century Fox]] across the United States. ''The Simpsons Movie'' was both a critical and commercial success, grossing over $527 million worldwide and becoming the [[2007 in film#Highest-grossing films|eighth highest-grossing film of 2007]], [[List of highest-grossing animated films#Traditional animation|the second highest-grossing traditionally animated film]] (behind the original version of ''[[The Lion King]]'') and the highest-ever grossing film based on an animated television series. In August 2018, it was reported that a [[sequel]] was in development.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movieweb.com/the-simpsons-movie-2-development-fox/|title=The Simpsons Movie 2 Reportedly in Development at Fox|first=Kevin |last=Burwick|work=movieweb.com|date=August 10, 2018|accessdate=August 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAs rock band [[Green Day]] perform on Lake Springfield, the band members fail to engage the audience in a discussion about the environment. They are killed when the pollution in the lake erodes their barge, causing it to sink. At their memorial, [[Grampa Simpson]] prophesies the destruction of the town but only [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] takes it seriously. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and her new friend Colin, whom she has fallen in love with, hold a seminar where they convince the town to clean up the lake. Meanwhile, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] adopts a pig from [[Krusty Burger]], which causes his now neglected son [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] to look to their neighbor, [[Ned Flanders]], as a parental figure. \n\nHomer stores the pig's feces in an overflowing silo, which horrifies Marge. Homer attempts to dispose of it safely at Marge's request, but gets distracted and instead dumps the silo in the lake, critically polluting it. Moments later, a squirrel jumps into the lake and becomes severely mutated. Flanders and Bart discover the squirrel during a hike, and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] captures it. [[Russ Cargill]], head of the EPA, informs President [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] on Springfield's pollution crisis and presents five countering options. The President randomly picks the action of enclosing [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] in a giant glass dome. When Homer's silo is discovered, an angry mob of townspeople approach the [[The Simpsons house|Simpsons' home]]. The family escapes through a sinkhole in [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]'s sandbox and flee to Alaska. Homer wins a motorcycle contest and is awarded a truck, which the family use to restart themselves. \n\nAfter three months of failed escape attempts, cracks start to appear in the dome and Cargill, not wanting news of what he has done to become widespread, plots to destroy Springfield. In Alaska, the Simpsons see an advertisement featuring [[Tom Hanks]] for a new [[Grand Canyon]] on the site of Springfield. Realizing that their hometown is in danger, Marge and the kids elect to save it, but Homer objects to help the people who tried to kill them. The family abandon Homer but are captured by the EPA and placed back in the dome. After a visit from a mysterious Inuit shaman, Homer has an epiphany that he must save the town in order to save himself.\n\nHomer learns his family are in Springfield and a helicopter lowers a bomb suspended by rope through a hole in the dome. Homer climbs to the peak of the dome using superglue and descends the rope, knocking the escaping townspeople and the bomb off. After reuniting with Bart, they use a motorcycle to travel up the side of the dome and Bart throws the bomb through the hole, seconds before detonation. The bomb explodes, shattering the dome. Cargill attempts to kill Homer and Bart for ruining his plan, but Maggie knocks him out with a boulder. The townspeople praise Homer, who rides off with Marge on the motorcycle into the sunset as Springfield begins restoration.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, the Simpsons are shown watching the credits of the actual movie.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main article|List of The Simpsons characters}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:110px;\"| Voice actor\n! scope=\"col\" | Credited roles\n! scope=\"col\" class=unsortable | Uncredited roles (in order of appearance)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Dan|Castellaneta}}\n| [[Homer Simpson]], [[Abe Simpson]], [[Krusty the Clown]], [[Groundskeeper Willie]], [[Mayor Quimby]], [[Sideshow Mel]], [[Mr. Teeny]],  [[EPA]] Official, [[Itchy and Scratchy|Itchy]], [[Barney Gumble]]\n| Stage Manager, [[Blue Haired Lawyer]], Multi-Eyed Squirrel, [[Hans Moleman]], Panicky Man, Kissing Cop, Bear, Boy on Phone, [[NSA]] Worker, Officer, [[Rich Texan]], [[Santa's Little Helper]], [[Squeaky-Voiced Teen]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Julie|Kavner}}\n| [[Marge Simpson]], [[Patty and Selma|Selma Bouvier, Patty Bouvier]]\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Nancy|Cartwright}}\n| [[Bart Simpson]], [[Ralph Wiggum]], [[Todd Flanders]], [[Nelson Muntz]]\n| [[Maggie Simpson]], TV Daughter, Woman on Phone\n|-nik Simpson\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Yeardley|Smith}}\n| [[Lisa Simpson]]\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Hank|Azaria}}\n| [[Moe Szyslak]], [[Chief Wiggum]], [[Cletus Spuckler]], [[Professor Frink]], [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]], [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Lou|Lou]], [[Comic Book Guy]], [[Captain McCallister]], [[Bumblebee Man]], [[List of The Simpsons characters#Dr. Nick Rivera|Dr. Nick]]\n| [[Lenny and Carl|Carl]], Male EPA Worker, Dome Depot Announcer, Kissing Cop, Carnival Barker, Gas Station Clerk, [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Drederick Tatum|Drederick Tatum]], EPA Passenger, Robot, [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Wiseguy|Wiseguy]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Harry|Shearer}}\n| [[Mr. Burns]], [[Waylon Smithers|Smithers]], [[Ned Flanders]], [[Reverend Lovejoy]], [[Lenny and Carl|Lenny]], President [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Principal Skinner|Seymour Skinner]], [[Kent Brockman]], [[Dr. Hibbert]], [[Otto Mann]]\n| [[Itchy and Scratchy|Scratchy]], Skull, Toll Booth Operator, Guard\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Pamela|Hayden}}\n| [[Milhouse Van Houten]], [[Rod Flanders]], [[Jimbo Jones]]\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Tress|MacNeille}}\n| Medicine Woman, [[Agnes Skinner]], [[Crazy Cat Lady]], Colin, [[Cookie Kwan]]\n| Sweet Old Lady, [[Mrs. Muntz]], [[Plopper]], Female EPA Worker, [[List of The Simpsons characters#Lindsey Neagle|Lindsey Neagle]], [[GPS]] Voice, TV Son, Girl on Phone\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Albert|Brooks}} (as \"A.

The film was directed by [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]], and stars the regular television cast of [[Dan Castellaneta]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Yeardley Smith]], [[Hank Azaria]], [[Harry Shearer]], [[Tress MacNeille]], [[Pamela Hayden]], [[Russi Taylor]], and [[Albert Brooks]]. The film follows [[Homer Simpson]], who irresponsibly pollutes the lake in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] after the town has cleaned it up, causing the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] to imprison the town under a giant dome. After he and [[Simpson family|his family]] narrowly manage to escape, they ultimately abandon Homer for his selfishness, and he works to redeem his folly by stopping Russ Cargill, the head of the EPA, from destroying Springfield.\n\nAlthough previous attempts to create a ''Simpsons'' film had been made, they all failed due to the lack of a script of appropriate length and production crew members. Eventually in 2001, producers [[James L. Brooks]], [[Matt Groening]], [[Al Jean]], [[Richard Sakai]] and [[Mike Scully]] began development of the film and a writing team consisting of Brooks, Groening, Jean, Scully, [[Ian Maxtone-Graham]], [[George Meyer]], [[David Mirkin]], [[Mike Reiss]], [[Matt Selman]], [[John Swartzwelder]] and [[Jon Vitti]] was assembled. They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening's being the one developed into a film. The script was rewritten over a hundred times, with rewrites continuing after work on the animation began in 2006. Consequently, hours of finished material was cut from the final release, including [[cameo appearance|cameo roles]] from [[Erin Brockovich]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Isla Fisher]], [[Kelsey Grammer]] and [[Edward Norton]]. [[Tom Hanks]] and the members of [[Green Day]] voice their own animated counterparts in the final cut of the film, while Albert Brooks, a frequent guest performer on the series, provides the voice of the villain Cargill.\n\n[[Tie-in]] promotions were made with several companies to promote the film's release, including [[Burger King]] and [[7-Eleven]], the latter of which [[Kwik-E-Mart#7-Eleven promotion|transformed selected stores]] into [[Kwik-E-Mart]]s. The film premiered in [[Springfield, Vermont]] on July 21, 2007 and was released theatrically six days later by [[20th Century Fox]] across the United States. ''The Simpsons Movie'' was both a critical and commercial success, grossing over $527 million worldwide and becoming the [[2007 in film#Highest-grossing films|eighth highest-grossing film of 2007]], [[List of highest-grossing animated films#Traditional animation|the second highest-grossing traditionally animated film]] (behind the original version of ''[[The Lion King]]'') and the highest-ever grossing film based on an animated television series. In August 2018, it was reported that a [[sequel]] was in development.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movieweb.com/the-simpsons-movie-2-development-fox/|title=The Simpsons Movie 2 Reportedly in Development at Fox|first=Kevin |last=Burwick|work=movieweb.com|date=August 10, 2018|accessdate=August 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nWhile rock band [[Green Day]] are performing on Lake Springfield, the band members fail to engage the audience in a discussion about the environment. They are killed when the pollution in the lake erodes their barge, causing it to sink. At their memorial, [[Grampa Simpson]] prophesies the destruction of the town but only [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] takes it seriously. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and her new friend Colin, whom she has fallen in love with, hold a seminar where they convince the town to clean up the lake. Meanwhile, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] adopts a pig from [[Krusty Burger]], which causes his now neglected son [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] to look to their neighbor, [[Ned Flanders]], as a parental figure. \n\nHomer stores the pig's feces in an overflowing silo, which horrifies Marge, and she tells him to dispose of it safely. However, Homer gets distracted and instead dumps the silo in the lake, critically polluting it. Moments later, a squirrel jumps into the lake and becomes severely mutated. Nearby, Flanders and Bart discover the squirrel during a hike, and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] captures it. [[Russ Cargill]], head of the EPA, presents five options to President [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], who randomly picks the action of enclosing [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] in a giant glass dome. When the police discover Homer's silo in the lake, an angry mob of townspeople approach the [[The Simpsons house|Simpsons' home]]. The family escapes through a sinkhole in [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]'s sandbox and flee to Alaska. \n\nAfter three months of failed escape attempts, cracks start to appear in the dome and Cargill, not wanting news of what he has done to become widespread, plans to destroy Springfield. In Alaska, the Simpsons see an advertisement featuring [[Tom Hanks]] for a new [[Grand Canyon]] on the site of Springfield. Realizing that their hometown is in danger, Marge and the kids decide to return to save it, but Homer refuses to help the people who tried to kill them. The family abandon Homer and leave but are captured by the EPA and placed back in the dome. After a visit from a mysterious Inuit shaman, Homer has an epiphany that he must save the town in order to save himself. Just as he arrives at Springfield to do so, a helicopter lowers a bomb suspended by rope through a hole in the dome. Homer climbs using superglue to the peak of the dome and descends the rope, knocking the escaping townspeople and bomb off. Homer grabs the bomb and a motorcycle. After reuniting with Bart, they cycle up the side of the dome and Bart throws the bomb through the hole, seconds before detonation. The bomb explodes, shattering the dome. Cargill attempts to kill Homer and Bart for ruining his plan, but Maggie knocks him out with a boulder. The town praises Homer, who rides off with Marge on the motorcycle into the sunset. The townspeople begin restoring Springfield back to normal.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, the Simpsons are shown watching the credits of the actual movie.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main article|List of The Simpsons characters}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:110px;\"| Voice actor\n! scope=\"col\" | Credited roles\n! scope=\"col\" class=unsortable | Uncredited roles (in order of appearance)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Dan|Castellaneta}}\n| [[Homer Simpson]], [[Abe Simpson]], [[Krusty the Clown]], [[Groundskeeper Willie]], [[Mayor Quimby]], [[Sideshow Mel]], [[Mr. Teeny]],  [[EPA]] Official, [[Itchy and Scratchy|Itchy]], [[Barney Gumble]]\n| Stage Manager, [[Blue Haired Lawyer]], Multi-Eyed Squirrel, [[Hans Moleman]], Panicky Man, Kissing Cop, Bear, Boy on Phone, [[NSA]] Worker, Officer, [[Rich Texan]], [[Santa's Little Helper]], [[Squeaky-Voiced Teen]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Julie|Kavner}}\n| [[Marge Simpson]], [[Patty and Selma|Selma Bouvier, Patty Bouvier]]\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Nancy|Cartwright}}\n| [[Bart Simpson]], [[Ralph Wiggum]], [[Todd Flanders]], [[Nelson Muntz]]\n| [[Maggie Simpson]], TV Daughter, Woman on Phone\n|-nik Simpson\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Yeardley|Smith}}\n| [[Lisa Simpson]]\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Hank|Azaria}}\n| [[Moe Szyslak]], [[Chief Wiggum]], [[Cletus Spuckler]], [[Professor Frink]], [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]], [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Lou|Lou]], [[Comic Book Guy]], [[Captain McCallister]], [[Bumblebee Man]], [[List of The Simpsons characters#Dr. Nick Rivera|Dr. Nick]]\n| [[Lenny and Carl|Carl]], Male EPA Worker, Dome Depot Announcer, Kissing Cop, Carnival Barker, Gas Station Clerk, [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Drederick Tatum|Drederick Tatum]], EPA Passenger, Robot, [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Wiseguy|Wiseguy]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Harry|Shearer}}\n| [[Mr. Burns]], [[Waylon Smithers|Smithers]], [[Ned Flanders]], [[Reverend Lovejoy]], [[Lenny and Carl|Lenny]], President [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Principal Skinner|Seymour Skinner]], [[Kent Brockman]], [[Dr. Hibbert]], [[Otto Mann]]\n| [[Itchy and Scratchy|Scratchy]], Skull, Toll Booth Operator, Guard\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Pamela|Hayden}}\n| [[Milhouse Van Houten]], [[Rod Flanders]], [[Jimbo Jones]]\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Tress|MacNeille}}\n| Medicine Woman, [[Agnes Skinner]], [[Crazy Cat Lady]], Colin, [[Cookie Kwan]]\n| Sweet Old Lady, [[Mrs. Muntz]], [[Plopper]], Female EPA Worker, [[List of The Simpsons characters#Lindsey Neagle|Lindsey Neagle]], [[GPS]] Voice, TV Son, Girl on Phone\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Albert|Brooks}} (as \"A.
