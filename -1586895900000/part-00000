{"title_page": "Carlos (Calusa)", "text_new": "[[File:Flmn chiefshut.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Diorama of Carlos (center) and his court at the [[Florida Museum of Natural History]]]]\n'''Carlos''', also known as '''Calos''' or '''King Calusa''' (died 1567), was king or [[paramount chief]] of the [[Calusa]] people of [[Southwest Florida]] from about 1556 until his death. As his father and predecessor was also known as Carlos, he is sometimes called '''Carlos II'''. Carlos ruled over one of the most powerful and prosperous [[chiefdom]]s in the region at the time, controlling the coastal areas of southwest Florida and wielding influence throughout the southern peninsula. Contemporary Europeans recognized him as the most powerful chief in Florida.\n\nCarlos inherited the throne from his father, who had been installed as regent while the designated heir, Felipe, was too young to rule. Carlos' father bypassed Felipe in favor of Carlos, creating tension between Carlos and Felipe's families. Felipe served as war chief and was seen as a stronger leader by many Calusa.\n\nCarlos was chief at the time of contact with the Spanish under [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s]] in 1566. At this time, Carlos faced internal political pressure from Felipe as well as war with external enemies, most notably the [[Tocobaga]] around [[Tampa Bay]]. As a result, he initially sought an alliance with the Spanish. The alliance soon failed due to the conflicting aims of the two parties, and the relationship between the Calusa and the Spanish turned violent. Eventually Carlos was captured and executed by Spanish officers. Felipe succeeded him as chief.\n\n==Background and succession==\n[[File:FLMap-Calusa-core&domain.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Approximate Calusa core territory (red) and sphere of influence (blue) in Carlos' time]]\n\nDuring Carlos' time, the Calusa were a major power in Florida. Both the Spanish and French colonists considered Carlos the most powerful chief in the region.<ref>McGoun 1993:17, 21.</ref> The Calusa did not practice substantive agriculture, but the abundant supply of fish and shellfish in their territory supported their large, sedentary population.<ref>McGoun, pp. 34\u201335.</ref> They controlled southwest Florida coast from [[Charlotte Harbor (estuary)|Charlotte Harbor]] south to the [[Florida Bay]] and wielded influence over most peoples in the southern part of the peninsula, possibly stretching as far north as [[Cape Canaveral]].<ref>McGoun 1993:24\u201326.</ref> Calusa society was highly organized, with considerable power vested in the chiefs. The chief's power derived from their paramount place in the Calusa religious system as well as their ability to control and distribute trade goods.<ref>McGoun 1993:14, 17.</ref> William McGoun writes that the Calusa represented a highly stratified [[chiefdom]], and may have been emerging as a [[state (polity)|state]]. This interpretation is based on Carlos' succession controversy, which suggested that power was at least partly vested in the institution of the throne rather than a hereditary line.<ref>McGoun 1993: 15\u201316, 35.</ref>\n\nCarlos inherited the chiefdom from his father and predecessor, whose name was given as Senquene by shipwreck survivor [[Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda]], who lived as a prisoner of the Calusa from about 1549 to 1566. Senquene is known in other Spanish sources as Carlos, leading scholars sometimes to call his son Carlos II.<ref name=McGoun16>McGoun, p. 16 and note.</ref> In 1568, Jesuit missionary [[Juan Rogel]] wrote an account of the contentious succession of the recent kings, based on Calusa informants, which scholars have parsed to develop a model of the succession leading up to Carlos.<ref name=succession>The Calusa succession is charted in Goggin and Sturtevant 1964:193\u2013194; Lewis 1978:32\u201333; Marquardt 1987:104-106; Widmer 1988:6; and McGoun 1993:12\u201316 and note.</ref>\n\nSenquene was originally the chief priest, serving under his brother, the king.<ref>There is some confusion in the sources concerning the names of Carlos' father and the previous king. [[Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda]] says ''Senquene'' was the name of Carlos II's father and predecessor (Hann 5). However, Lewis (32) and Marquardt (104\u2013106) refer to the original king (Carlos II's father's brother) as \"Senquene\". Goggin and Sturtevant, Widmer, and McGoun follow Fontaneda in giving Senquene as the name of Carlos II's father.</ref> Their sister was married to the war chief (a position known to the Spanish as \"captain general\") with whom she had a son, who was eventually known to the Spanish as Felipe. The king had no sons of his own. As the Calusa, unusually among [[Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands|Southeastern peoples]], apparently practiced [[patrilineal succession]], the king named Felipe his heir. He formally adopted Felipe and married him to his daughter. However, the king died while Felipe was still too young to rule. Senquene and Felipe's father agreed that Senquene should rule temporarily until Felipe came of age. After Senquene took the kingship, Carlos was born. Senquene reneged on his vow to step down; he named Carlos his successor and had the previous king's daughter divorced from Felipe and remarried to Carlos. He placated Felipe's enraged family by naming Felipe the next captain general and arranging a marriage to one of his own daughters. This development caused unease for many Calusa, who saw it as a usurpation.<ref name=McGoun16/><ref>Hann 267\u2013269.</ref><ref name=Widmer6>Widmer 1988:6.</ref>\n\nCarlos II had an older sister, later baptized Antonia, whom he loved greatly. By the time of contact with the Spanish, Antonia was one of Carlos' wives (according to Spanish reports Calusa chiefs were expected to take their sister as one of their wives). His queen or principal wife, whose name is unknown, was the sister of Felipe.<ref name=Widmer6/> Carlos had several other wives, many of whom were daughters of his [[vassal|vassal chiefs]].<ref>McGoun 1993: 34.</ref>\n\n==Kingship==\nCarlos likely rose to the kingship in the 1550s; William Marquart suggests 1556 based on events that happened that year. Carlos' succession evidently inspired challenges from other powerful chiefdoms. In 1556, the daughter of Oathchaqua, chief of the [[Ais people|Ais]] of [[Cape Canaveral]], set out for Calusa to cement an alliance between their peoples by marrying Carlos. During the journey, she was captured by the chief of the [[Surruque]] or Serrope, who took her as his own wife. In doing so, Chief Surruque challenged Carlos' authority, disrupted the key alliance and trading route between the Calusa and Ais, and positioned himself as a significant power. A few years later, the [[Tocobaga]] of [[Tampa Bay]] asserted themselves by capturing twelve Calusa nobles, including the sister of Carlos' wife. Beset with problems, Carlos struggled to respond.<ref>Marquardt 1987:106</ref>\n\nCarlos was king at the time of contact with the Spanish under [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s]]. Avil\u00e9s arrived in the Calusa region in 1566, five months after establishing the settlement of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] in northeast Florida and ejecting the French [[Huguenot]]s from their settlement of [[Fort Caroline]]. The Spanish landed at Carlos' capital, Calos, probably on [[Mound Key]].<ref>McGoun 1993: 9.</ref> Men\u00e9ndez' primary goal in the voyage was to secure the release of Spanish shipwreck survivors living among the Calusa, including his son Juan.<ref>McGoun, p. 9\u201311.</ref>\n\nCarlos jumped at the chance for an alliance with the powerful foreigners. He hoped such an alliance would help against his people's enemies, in particular the Tocabaga. He also may have hoped it would give him the upper hand in his rivalry with Felipe, whom the Spanish chronicler Gonzalo Sol\u00eds de Mer\u00e1s wrote was even more feared by his people than Carlos himself.<ref>McGoun, p. 12.</ref> According to historian Stephen Edward Reilly, this power struggle was the primary reason Carlos pursued an alliance with the Spanish.<ref>McGoun, pp. 12\u201313.</ref>\n\nCarlos attempted to solidify the alliance with the Spanish by offering to wed his sister Antonia to Men\u00e9ndez, who very reluctantly accepted. He allowed the Spanish to establish a small outpost and a [[Jesuit]] mission, [[San Ant\u00f3n de Carlos]], near the main town of Calos.<ref name=McGoun14>McGoun, p. 14.</ref> He also sent several prominent Calusa, including Felipe, a certain Sebastian, and Sebastian's son Pedro (relatives of Carlos), on a trip to [[Havana]]. However, relations with the Spanish soon soured. Carlos did reluctantly release his captive shipwreck survivors, but was angered when Men\u00e9ndez refused to aid him against the Tocobaga. He was further dismayed when Men\u00e9ndez put off consummating his marriage to Antonia (Sol\u00eds de Mer\u00e1s is unclear as to whether they ever consummated the union).<ref>McGoun, p. 13.</ref>\n\n==Death and aftermath==\nThereafter, the relationship took a violent turn, as Carlos repeatedly plotted against the Spanish. He attempted three times to assassinate Men\u00e9ndez. After Men\u00e9ndez's departure, the Calusa were continuously hostile towards the Spanish outpost and its commander, Francisco de Reinoso. Reinoso wanted to fight back, but was prevented from doing so by Father Juan de Rogel, who led Mission San Ant\u00f3n. In Spring 1567, Reinoso managed to compel Rogel to journey to Havana, allowing him to strike against the Calusa. Reinoso had Carlos captured and killed, along with his advisers, and installed Felipe in his place.<ref name=\"McGoun14\"/>\n\nFelipe proved a stronger king than Carlos, and therefore a greater danger to the Spanish. Though he appeased the Spanish by ostensibly converting to Christianity, he did not abandon the traditional religious practice or the power it afforded him. In 1569, the Calusa attacked the landing party of [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez M\u00e1rquez]]. Men\u00e9ndez M\u00e1rquez repelled the attack and had Felipe and twenty of his supporters killed. Pedro, whom Spanish sources call Carlos' \"first cousin\", succeeded Felipe as chief of the Calusa. Pedro was no more compliant than his predecessors had been, and the Spanish abandoned the region.<ref>McGoun, pp. 15\u201316 and note.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n*{{cite encyclopedia |last= Goggin |first= John M. |author-link=John Mann Goggin|last2= Sturtevant |first2= William C.|author-link2=William C.

By the time of contact with the Spanish, Antonia was one of Carlos' wives (according to Spanish reports Calusa chiefs were expected to take their sister as one of their wives). His queen or principal wife, whose name is unknown, was the sister of Felipe.<ref name=Widmer6/> Carlos had several other wives, many of whom were daughters of his [[vassal|vassal chiefs]].<ref>McGoun 1993: 34.</ref>\n\n==Kingship==\nCarlos likely rose to the kingship in the 1550s; William Marquart suggests 1556 based on events that happened that year. Carlos' succession evidently inspired challenges from other powerful chiefdoms. In 1556, the daughter of Oathchaqua, chief of the [[Ais people|Ais]] of [[Cape Canaveral]], set out for Calusa to cement an alliance between their peoples by marrying Carlos. During the journey, she was captured by the chief of the [[Surruque]] or Serrope, who took her as his own wife. In doing so, Chief Surruque challenged Carlos' authority, disrupted the key alliance and trading route between the Calusa and Ais, and positioned himself as a significant power. A few years later, the [[Tocobaga]] of [[Tampa Bay]] asserted themselves by capturing twelve Calusa nobles, including the sister of Carlos' wife. Beset with problems, Carlos struggled to respond.<ref>Marquardt 1987:106</ref>\n\nCarlos was king at the time of contact with the Spanish under [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s]]. Avil\u00e9s arrived in the Calusa region in 1566, five months after establishing the settlement of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] in northeast Florida and ejecting the French [[Huguenot]]s from their settlement of [[Fort Caroline]]. The Spanish landed at Carlos' capital, Calos, probably on [[Mound Key]].<ref>McGoun 1993: 9.</ref> Men\u00e9ndez' primary goal in the voyage was to secure the release of Spanish shipwreck survivors living among the Calusa, including his son Juan.<ref>McGoun, p. 9\u201311.</ref>\n\nCarlos jumped at the chance for an alliance with the powerful foreigners. He hoped such an alliance would help against his people's enemies, in particular the Tocabaga. He also may have hoped it would give him the upper hand in his rivalry with Felipe, whom the Spanish chronicler Gonzalo Sol\u00eds de Mer\u00e1s wrote was even more feared by his people than Carlos himself.<ref>McGoun, p. 12.</ref> According to historian Stephen Edward Reilly, this power struggle was the primary reason Carlos pursued an alliance with the Spanish.<ref>McGoun, pp. 12\u201313.</ref>\n\nCarlos attempted to solidify the alliance with the Spanish by offering to wed his sister Antonia to Men\u00e9ndez, who very reluctantly accepted. He allowed the Spanish to establish a small outpost and a [[Jesuit]] mission, [[San Ant\u00f3n de Carlos]], near the main town of Calos.<ref name=McGoun14>McGoun, p. 14.</ref> He also sent several prominent Calusa, including Felipe, a certain Sebastian, and Sebastian's son Pedro (relatives of Carlos), on a trip to [[Havana]]. However, relations with the Spanish soon soured. Carlos did reluctantly release his captive shipwreck survivors, but was angered when Men\u00e9ndez refused to aid him against the Tocobaga. He was further dismayed when Men\u00e9ndez put off consummating his marriage to Antonia (Sol\u00eds de Mer\u00e1s is unclear as to whether they ever consummated the union).<ref>McGoun, p. 13.</ref>\n\n==Death and aftermath==\nThereafter, the relationship took a violent turn, as Carlos repeatedly plotted against the Spanish. He attempted three times to assassinate Men\u00e9ndez. After Men\u00e9ndez's departure, the Calusa were continuously hostile towards the Spanish outpost and its commander, Francisco de Reinoso. Reinoso wanted to fight back, but was prevented from doing so by Father Juan de Rogel, who led Mission San Ant\u00f3n. In Spring 1567, Reinoso managed to compel Rogel to journey to Havana, allowing him to strike against the Calusa. Reinoso had Carlos captured and killed, along with his advisers, and installed Felipe in his place.<ref name=\"McGoun14\"/>\n\nFelipe proved a stronger king than Carlos, and therefore a greater danger to the Spanish. Though he appeased the Spanish by ostensibly converting to Christianity, he did not abandon the traditional religious practice or the power it afforded him. In 1569, the Calusa attacked the landing party of [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez M\u00e1rquez]]. Men\u00e9ndez M\u00e1rquez repelled the attack and had Felipe and twenty of his supporters killed. Pedro, whom Spanish sources call Carlos' \"first cousin\", succeeded Felipe as chief of the Calusa. Pedro was no more compliant than his predecessors had been, and the Spanish abandoned the region.<ref>McGoun, pp. 15\u201316 and note.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n*{{cite encyclopedia |last= Goggin |first= John M. |author-link=John Mann Goggin|last2= Sturtevant |first2= William C.|author-link2=William C.

The [[McLaren Group|McLaren]] edition from the [[OnePlus 6T|6T]] returns on the 7T Pro.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/10/oneplus-7t-pro-mclaren-edition-announcement/|title=The OnePlus 7T Pro is a speedier take on a familiar design|work=[[Engadget]]|last=Bonifacic|first=Igor|date=10 October 2019|accessdate=10 October 2019}}</ref> Both have minor upgrades as with previous T phones, such as new software, upgraded cameras and a faster chipset.\n\n==Specifications==\n===Design===\nThe 7T and 7T Pro's designs are similar to their predecessors, with an anodized aluminum frame and [[Gorilla Glass]] on both the front and back. The 7T has a near-full screen display with an 86.5% screen-to-body ratio; a small notch at the top of the phone houses the front camera. The camera module on the rear is now circular, with the flash located inside the lens. The 7T Pro is nearly identical to the 7 Pro externally with an 88.1% screen-to-body ratio. The 7T is available in Frosted Silver and Glacial Blue, both of which have a matte finish, and the 7T Pro is available in Haze Blue, which is a lighter shade than the 7 Pro's Nebula Blue.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oneplus.com/7t/specs?from=7t|title=OnePlus 7T Specification{{Snd}} OnePlus (United States)|website=www.oneplus.com|access-date=2019-10-05}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_7t-9816.php|title=OnePlus 7T{{Snd}} Full phone specifications|website=www.gsmarena.com|access-date=2019-10-05}}</ref>\n\n===Hardware===\nInternally, both the 7T and 7T Pro use the Snapdragon 855+ processor with the [[Adreno]] 640 GPU, both of which have a higher [[Clock rate|clock speed]] than the chipset used in the 7 and 7 Pro. They are available with either 128 or 256&nbsp;GB of non-expandable [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0 storage and 8&nbsp;GB of [[LPDDR4X]] RAM. A 6.55-inch (166.4mm) [[1080p]] (1080 \u00d7 2400) [[AMOLED]] display is used with a wider 20:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]], while retaining the 90&nbsp;Hz [[refresh rate]] of the 7 Pro.

The 7T uses a 3800 mAh battery, while the 7T Pro uses a 4085 mAh battery which is marginally larger than the 7 Pro's. Power and data connections are provided through the USB-C port; fast charging is supported at 30W. Warp Charge 30T is now supported, which is 23% faster than Warp Charge 30 which was used on the 7 Pro. Biometric options include an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor and facial recognition.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/26/oneplus-7t-specs-price-availability-camera-hands-on/|title=The OnePlus 7T offers a high-speed HDR display for $599|last=Low|first=Cherlynn|date=26 September 2019|work=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=26 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oneplus.com/uk/7t-pro/specs?from=7t-pro|title=OnePlus 7T Pro Specification{{Snd}} OnePlus (United Kingdom)|website=oneplus.com|accessdate=2019-11-11}}</ref>\n\n====Camera====\nA 16&nbsp;MP f/2.0 sensor is used for the front camera, while the rear has an upgraded triple camera setup. The 7T Pro uses a mechanized pop-up camera like on the 7 Pro. The array on both phones consists of a primary lens, a telephoto (zoom) lens, and an ultrawide lens. The primary wide lens has a 48&nbsp;MP sensor, while a 16&nbsp;MP sensor is used for the ultrawide lens and a 12&nbsp;MP sensor is used for the telephoto lens. The 7T Pro's camera hardware is unchanged, with a 48&nbsp;MP lens, a 16&nbsp;MP ultrawide lens and an 8&nbsp;MP telephoto lens, but it can now record ultra slow-motion 720p video at 960&nbsp;fps (the 7T also receives the same upgraded slow-motion capabilities) and the laser autofocus has been relocated to the left of the camera. While the 7T's telephoto lens benefits from an increase in resolution and a wider f/2.2 [[aperture]], it lacks the 7T Pro's [[Image stabilization#Optical image stabilization|optical image stabilization]] and laser autofocus and only has 2x optical zoom compared to the 7T Pro's 3x optical zoom, resulting in a smaller 51&nbsp;mm [[focal length]] opposed to the 7T Pro's 78&nbsp;mm focal length. The ultrawide lens has also been upgraded; it is 17&nbsp;mm compared to 13&nbsp;mm on the 7T Pro.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/09/oneplus-announces-the-oneplus-7t-a-90hz-display-phone-for-599/|title=The OnePlus 7T packs a 90&nbsp;Hz display, Snapdragon 855+ for $599|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=26 September 2019|work=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=26 September 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> Additionally, both phones benefit from a new macro mode which allows users to take photos from as close as 2.5&nbsp;cm away from the subject.<ref name=\"Verge 7T Pro\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/10/20906256/oneplus-7t-pro-release-date-price-news-features-pop-up-selfie-camera-90hz-screen|title=The OnePlus 7T Pro is a spec bump upgrade that won't come to the US|work=[[The Verge|Circuitbreaker]]|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=10 October 2019|accessdate=10 October 2019}}</ref> A new Hybrid Image Stabilization for video is also available, and Portrait Mode and Night Scape can now be used on the wide and ultrawide lenses respectively.\n\n===Software===\nThe 7T and 7T Pro run on [[OxygenOS]] 10, which is based on [[Android 10]].\n\n===Network compatibility===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model\n!GSM\nBands\n!CDMA\nBands\n!UMTS\nBands\n!LTE\nBands\n|-\n|7T\n|rowspan=\"2\"|850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900&nbsp;MHz\n|rowspan=\"2\"|BC0, BC1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 19\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 66, 71\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 46, 48 \n|-\n|7T Pro\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 32, 66\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41\n|}\nThe OnePlus 7T Pro will only be available in Europe, India, China and Hong Kong.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/oneplus-best-phone-isnt-coming-to-the-us/|title=OnePlus' best phone isn't coming to the US|work=[[Ars Technica]]|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=10 October 2019|accessdate=10 October 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Variants===\nBoth the OnePlus 7T and OnePlus 7T Pro have several variants.

The camera module on the rear is now circular, with the flash located inside the lens. The 7T Pro is nearly identical to the 7 Pro externally with an 88.1% screen-to-body ratio.

Power and data connections are provided through the USB-C port; fast charging is supported at 30W.

The 7T Pro uses a mechanized pop-up camera like on the 7 Pro. The array on both phones consists of a primary lens, a telephoto (zoom) lens, and an ultrawide lens. The primary wide lens has a 48&nbsp;MP sensor, while a 16&nbsp;MP sensor is used for the ultrawide lens and a 12&nbsp;MP sensor is used for the telephoto lens. The 7T Pro's camera hardware is unchanged, with a 48&nbsp;MP lens, a 16&nbsp;MP ultrawide lens and an 8&nbsp;MP telephoto lens, but it can now record ultra slow-motion 720p video at 960&nbsp;fps (the 7T also receives the same upgraded slow-motion capabilities) and the laser autofocus has been relocated to the left of the camera. While the 7T's telephoto lens benefits from an increase in resolution and a wider f/2.2 [[aperture]], it lacks the 7T Pro's [[Image stabilization#Optical image stabilization|optical image stabilization]] and laser autofocus and only has 2x optical zoom compared to the 7T Pro's 3x optical zoom, resulting in a smaller 51&nbsp;mm [[focal length]] opposed to the 7T Pro's 78&nbsp;mm focal length. The ultrawide lens has also been upgraded; it is 17&nbsp;mm compared to 13&nbsp;mm on the 7T Pro.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/09/oneplus-announces-the-oneplus-7t-a-90hz-display-phone-for-599/|title=The OnePlus 7T packs a 90&nbsp;Hz display, Snapdragon 855+ for $599|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=26 September 2019|work=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=26 September 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> Additionally, both phones benefit from a new macro mode which allows users to take photos from as close as 2.5&nbsp;cm away from the subject.<ref name=\"Verge 7T Pro\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/10/20906256/oneplus-7t-pro-release-date-price-news-features-pop-up-selfie-camera-90hz-screen|title=The OnePlus 7T Pro is a spec bump upgrade that won't come to the US|work=[[The Verge|Circuitbreaker]]|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=10 October 2019|accessdate=10 October 2019}}</ref> A new Hybrid Image Stabilization for video is also available, and Portrait Mode and Night Scape can now be used on the wide and ultrawide lenses respectively.\n\n===Software===\nThe 7T and 7T Pro run on [[OxygenOS]] 10, which is based on [[Android 10]].\n\n===Network compatibility===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model\n!GSM\nBands\n!CDMA\nBands\n!UMTS\nBands\n!LTE\nBands\n|-\n|7T\n|rowspan=\"2\"|850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900&nbsp;MHz\n|rowspan=\"2\"|BC0, BC1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 19\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 66, 71\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 46, 48 \n|-\n|7T Pro\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 32, 66\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41\n|}\nThe OnePlus 7T Pro will only be available in Europe, India, China and Hong Kong.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/oneplus-best-phone-isnt-coming-to-the-us/|title=OnePlus' best phone isn't coming to the US|work=[[Ars Technica]]|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=10 October 2019|accessdate=10 October 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Variants===\nBoth the OnePlus 7T and OnePlus 7T Pro have several variants.

He left a grim reputation for wickedness.\n \nOrme was the eldest surviving son of [[Robert Orme (MP)|Robert Orme]], of Woolavington, Sussex and his wife Dorothea Dawney, daughter of [[John Dawnay, 1st Viscount Downe]]. When his father died in 1711, and he succeeded to the Lavington estate, his neighbour, the Duke of Richmond took him up. He married Charlotte Hanway, daughter of Captain Jonas Hanway, RN in 1715. She died in January 1727, and on 4 March 1727 he married as his second wife Anne Lafitte, daughter of Rev. Daniel Lafitte of Bordeaux, vicar of Woolavington.<ref name = HOP>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1715-1754/member/orme-garton-1696-1758 | title= ORME, Garton (1696-1758), of Woolavington, nr. Midhurst, Suss. | publisher= History of Parliament Online| accessdate = 2 February 2019 }}</ref>\n\nOrme was appointed Gentleman Usher to the Princess of Wales on her marriage in 1736 and retained the post for the rest of his life. He was returned unopposed as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Arundel (UK Parliament constituency)|Arundel]] on his own interest at a by-election on 23 November 1739. He voted with the Opposition as a servant of the Prince of Wales. He was re-elected at the [[1741 British general election ]] after an expensive contest, spending money so freely that it was thought that the Prince was financing him. He consistently voted with the Leicester House party, although he was only a minor figure.<ref name=HOP/>\n\nAt the [[1747 British general election]] Orme was again returned for Arundel, with Theobald Taaffe, defeating candidates supported by his old patron, the Duke of Richmond. The Duke unsuccessfully tried to induce his candidates to petition \u2018against the bribery of Orme and Taaffe\u2019. Learning of moves to turn him out at the next election, he wrote in 1748 to the Duke, suggesting that they should reach a mutually satisfactory arrangement relating to the borough. He became Gentleman in Waiting to the Prince.  Soon afterwards he fell into financial difficulties. In 1750 a private Act was passed enabling him to sell or mortgage his estates and his daughter's portion to pay his debts. In 1752 he sold his East Dean estate for \u00a312,000. He did not stand in [[1754 British general election|the 1754 election]].<ref name=HOP/> \n\nOrme died on 20 October 1758 leaving one daughter by his first wife and an appalling reputation.

He left a grim reputation for wickedness.\n \nOrme was the eldest surviving son of [[Robert Orme (MP)|Robert Orme]], of Woolavington, Sussex and his wife Dorothea Dawney, daughter of [[John Dawnay, 1st Viscount Downe]]. When his father died in 1711, and he succeeded to the Lavington estate, his neighbour, the Duke of Richmond took him up. He married Charlotte Hanway, daughter of Captain Jonas Hanway, RN in 1715. She died in January 1727, and on 4 March 1727 he married as his second wife Anne Lafitte, daughter of Rev.

He was returned unopposed as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Arundel (UK Parliament constituency)|Arundel]] on his own interest at a by-election on 23 November 1739. He voted with the Opposition as a servant of the Prince of Wales. He was re-elected at the [[1741 British general election ]] after an expensive contest, spending money so freely that it was thought that the Prince was financing him. He consistently voted with the Leicester House party, although he was only a minor figure.<ref name=HOP/>\n\nAt the [[1747 British general election]] Orme was again returned for Arundel, with Theobald Taaffe, defeating candidates supported by his old patron, the Duke of Richmond. The Duke unsuccessfully tried to induce his candidates to petition \u2018against the bribery of Orme and Taaffe\u2019. Learning of moves to turn him out at the next election, he wrote in 1748 to the Duke, suggesting that they should reach a mutually satisfactory arrangement relating to the borough. He became Gentleman in Waiting to the Prince.  Soon afterwards he fell into financial difficulties. In 1750 a private Act was passed enabling him to sell or mortgage his estates and his daughter\u2019s portion to pay his debts. In 1752 he sold his East Dean estate for \u00a312,000.

He graduated from the Law School of Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington, Illinois and became an [[Lawyer|attorney]]. He also became active in Jewish causes, joining his local B'nai B'rith lodge. He grew increasingly concerned at what he saw as pervasive stereotyping of Jews, and after walking out on a theater performance in Chicago where he felt that Jews were being caricatured, he decided to form an organization to refute anti-Jewish stereotypes (\"Anti-Defamation League\" 2). He discussed the situation with a fellow attorney, [[Adolph Kraus]], the president of B'nai B'rith, and on September 17, 1913, Livingston founded the Anti-Defamation League, at that time a committee of the Chicago B'nai B'rith (\"Jews Organize\" 8; Hutchings, 11).\n\nLivingston was known as a tireless advocate for tolerance, speaking out against anti-Semitism all over the United States, through speaking engagements and conferences. Under his leadership, the Anti-Defamation League was able to address stereotypes in the popular culture, as well as in academia. For example, in 1930, the ADL was able to persuade Roget's Thesaurus to remove an objectionable portion from its pages: it has defined \"Jew\" as synonymous with \"cunning, rich, usurer, extortioner, heretic.\" The editors of Roget's apologized and agreed to change the definition in the next edition (\"Disparaging Reference\" 5) In 1944, Livingston also wrote a book that refuted some of the most common anti-Jewish myths, especially those used by the Nazis. \"Must Men Hate?\" received a number of favorable reviews, including one that called it an \"impressive\" and \"valuable\" volume (Jordan-Smith, C4).\n\nAfter graduation from Illinois Wesleyan Law School in 1894, Livingston began an active thirty (30) year law practice in Bloomington, Illinois.
