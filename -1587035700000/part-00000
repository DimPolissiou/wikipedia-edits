She wrote the words to the song \"[[Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star]]\", which is widely known, but it is generally forgotten who wrote it. The sisters, Jane and [[Ann Taylor (poet)|Ann Taylor]] and their authorship of various works have often been confused, in part because their early ones were published together. Ann Taylor's son, Josiah Gilbert, wrote in her biography, \"Two little poems \u2013 'My Mother,' and 'Twinkle, twinkle, little Star' \u2013 are perhaps more frequently quoted than any; the first, a lyric of life, was by Ann, the second, of nature, by Jane; and they illustrate this difference between the sisters.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/taylor/autobiography/autobiography-I.html |title=The Autobiography and Other Memorials of Mrs Gilbert, Formerly Ann Taylor |accessdate=17 April 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nBorn in London, Jane Taylor lived with her family at Shilling Grange in Shilling Street, [[Lavenham]], Suffolk, where her house can still be seen. Her mother was the writer [[Ann Taylor (1757\u20131830)|Ann Taylor]]. In 1796\u20131810, she lived in [[Colchester]]. This may be where \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\" was written,<ref>[http://www.beenthere-donethat.org.uk/dutchquarter.html Dutch Quarter]</ref> although [[Ongar, Essex|Ongar]] and [[Lavenham]] make similar claims. The Taylor sisters belonged to an extensive literary family. Their father, [[Isaac Taylor of Ongar]], was an engraver and later a dissenting minister. Their mother, Ann Taylor (n\u00e9e Martin) (1757\u20131830), wrote seven works of moral and religious advice, two of them fictionalised.<ref>ODNB entry for Taylor, Ann (1757\u20131830), by Robin Taylor Gilbert [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27018 Retrieved 27 May 2013. Pay-walled].</ref>\n\n===Literary career===\n[[File:Original Poems' and Others, by Ann and Jane Taylor and Adelaide O'Keeffe.jpg|thumb|The 'Original Poems' and Others, by [[:en:Ann Taylor (poet)|Ann]] and Jane Taylor and [[:en:Adelaide O'Keeffe|Adelaide O'Keeffe]] \u2013 1905 edition]]\nThe collection ''Original Poems for Infant Minds by several young persons'' was solicited by the publisher Darton and Harvey and published anonymously.<ref>Donelle Ruwe,''British Children's Poetry in the Romantic Era'' (2014) 71.</ref> The main contributors were Ann Taylor, Jane Taylor and Adelaide O'Keeffe, but Bernard Barton and various other members of the Taylor family contributed to it as well. As Donelle Ruwe writes in her study of its genesis and reception history, it was issued as a single-volume work in 1804, and when it proved successful, further poems were solicited for an additional volume, which was published in 1805. Over time, the collection became associated with the Taylor family. Although O'Keeffe wrote to the publisher requesting a greater percentage of the collection's proceeds, Darton and Harvey deferred to the Taylor family regarding all editorial decisions. For their part, the Taylor family was openly hostile to O'Keeffe and dismissive of her background in writing for the stage. (O'Keeffe's father was the popular Irish playwright [[John O'Keeffe (Irish writer)|John O'Keeffe]].)<ref>Ruwe, 69\u201370.</ref>\n\nAfter the success of ''Original Poems for Infant Minds,'' Ann and Jane Taylor published the poetry collections ''Rhymes for the Nursery'' in 1806 and ''Hymns for Infant Minds'' in 1810.<ref>For discussion of the Taylor sisters' impact on 19th-century hymn traditions for children, see Alisa Clapp-Itnyre (2016) ''British Hymn Books for Children, 1800\u20131900: Re-Tuning the History of Childhood''.</ref> In the two volumes of ''Original Poems for Infant Minds'', the Taylor sisters, O'Keeffe and the other contributors were identified as authors for each poem by initial or other identifying markers. In ''Rhymes for the Nursery'' (1806), Ann and Jane Taylor were not identified as authors of the collection or of individual poems. The most famous piece in the 1806 collection is \"The Star,\" commonly known today as \"[[Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star]]\", which was set to a French tune.\n\nChristina Duff Stewart identifies authorship in ''Rhymes for the Nursery'' based on a copy belonging to [[Isaac Taylor (canon)|Canon Isaac Taylor]], who noted the pieces by Ann and Jane Taylor.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=Christina Duff |title=The Taylors of Ongar: An Analytical Bio-Bibliography |publisher=[[Garland Publishing]] |year=1975 |location=New York & London |pages= |isbn=}}</ref> Canon Isaac was Taylor's nephew, a son of her brother [[Isaac Taylor]] of [[Stanford Rivers]]. Stewart also confirms attributions of ''Original Poems'' based on the publisher's records.\n\nJane Taylor also wrote the popular moral verse, ''The Violet'', which begins:\n<poem>\n''Down in a green and shady bed,\n''A modest violet grew; \n''Its stalk was bent, it hung its head\n''As if to hide from view. \n''And yet it was a lovely flower,\n''Its colour bright and fair; \n''It might have graced a rosy bower,\n''Instead of hiding there.''\n</poem>\n\nTaylor's novel ''Display'' (1814), reminiscent of [[Maria Edgeworth]] or perhaps even [[Jane Austen]], went through at least 13 editions up to 1832. Her ''Essays in Rhyme'' appeared in 1816, and contained some significant poetry. In the fictional ''Correspondence between a Mother and Her Daughter at School'' (1817), Taylor collaborated with her mother. ''The Family Mansion. A Tale'' appeared in 1819, and ''Practical Hints to Young Females'' some time before 1822.<ref>''Women Writers IV. R\u2013Z''. Catalogue of Jarndyce, Antiquarian Booksellers, London, Summer 2012.</ref>\n\nJane Taylor accepted the editorship of the religious ''Youth's Magazine''. She wrote numerous shorter pieces for the magazine, including moral tales and personal essays, and these were collected in ''The Contributions of Q. Q.''  Throughout her life, Taylor wrote many essays, plays, stories, poems, and letters which were never published. She was also erroneously named as author of works such as ''The Authoress'' (1819), ''Prudence and Principle'' (1818), and ''Rachel: A Tale'' (1817).<ref>Donelle Ruwe, \"[Jane Taylor]'s The Authoress: Aesthetics, Pedagogy, and a Parody of the Amateur Lady Author.\" ''ANQ: A Quarterly Journal of Short Articles, Notes, and Reviews'' 20.4 (Fall 2007): 44\u201350; see also Rainer Sch\u00f6werling's introduction to his facsimile edition of ''The Authoress: A Tale.'' [London: Taylor and Hessey, 1819. Germany: Belsar Verlag, 1988].</ref>\n\n===Death===\nJane Taylor died on 13 April 1824 of [[breast cancer]] at the age of 40, her mind still \"teeming with unfulfilled projects\". She was buried at Ongar churchyard in [[Essex]]. After her death, her brother Isaac collected many of her works and included a biography of her in ''The Writings of Jane Taylor, In Five Volumes'' (1832).\n\n==Popular influence==\n*Taylor's most famous verse, \"[[Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star]]\", is almost always uncredited. \"Its opening stanza persists as if it were folklore, the name of its creator almost entirely forgotten.\"<ref>Paula R. Feldman, ed: ''British women poets of the Romantic era: an anthology'' (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997), p. 712. {{ISBN|080185430X}}</ref> Alternative versions, pastiches and parodies abounded.

Ann Taylor's son, Josiah Gilbert, wrote in her biography, \"Two little poems \u2013 'My Mother,' and 'Twinkle, twinkle, little Star' \u2013 are perhaps more frequently quoted than any; the first, a lyric of life, was by Ann, the second, of nature, by Jane; and they illustrate this difference between the sisters.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/taylor/autobiography/autobiography-I.html |title=The Autobiography and Other Memorials of Mrs Gilbert, Formerly Ann Taylor |accessdate=17 April 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nBorn in London, Jane Taylor lived with her family at Shilling Grange in Shilling Street, [[Lavenham]], Suffolk, where her house can still be seen. Her mother was the writer [[Ann Taylor (1757\u20131830)|Ann Taylor]]. In 1796\u20131810, she lived in [[Colchester]]. This may be where \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\" was written,<ref>[http://www.beenthere-donethat.org.uk/dutchquarter.html Dutch Quarter]</ref> although [[Ongar, Essex|Ongar]] and [[Lavenham]] make similar claims. The Taylor sisters belonged to an extensive literary family. Their father, [[Isaac Taylor of Ongar]], was an engraver and later a dissenting minister. Their mother, Ann Taylor (n\u00e9e Martin) (1757\u20131830), wrote seven works of moral and religious advice, two of them fictionalised.<ref>ODNB entry for Taylor, Ann (1757\u20131830), by Robin Taylor Gilbert [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27018 Retrieved 27 May 2013. Pay-walled].</ref>\n\n===Literary career===\n[[File:Original Poems' and Others, by Ann and Jane Taylor and Adelaide O'Keeffe.jpg|thumb|The 'Original Poems' and Others, by [[:en:Ann Taylor (poet)|Ann]] and Jane Taylor and [[:en:Adelaide O'Keeffe|Adelaide O'Keeffe]] \u2013 1905 edition]]\nThe collection ''Original Poems for Infant Minds by several young persons'' was solicited by the publisher Darton and Harvey and published anonymously.<ref>Donelle Ruwe,''British Children's Poetry in the Romantic Era'' (2014) 71.</ref> The main contributors were Ann Taylor, Jane Taylor and Adelaide O'Keeffe, but Bernard Barton and various other members of the Taylor family contributed to it as well. As Donelle Ruwe writes in her study of its genesis and reception history, it was issued as a single-volume work in 1804, and when it proved successful, further poems were solicited for an additional volume, which was published in 1805. Over time, the collection became associated with the Taylor family. Although O'Keeffe wrote to the publisher requesting a greater percentage of the collection's proceeds, Darton and Harvey deferred to the Taylor family regarding all editorial decisions. For their part, the Taylor family was openly hostile to O'Keeffe and dismissive of her background in writing for the stage. (O'Keeffe's father was the popular Irish playwright [[John O'Keeffe (Irish writer)|John O'Keeffe]].)<ref>Ruwe, 69\u201370.</ref>\n\nAfter the success of ''Original Poems for Infant Minds,'' Ann and Jane Taylor published the poetry collections ''Rhymes for the Nursery'' in 1806 and ''Hymns for Infant Minds'' in 1810.<ref>For discussion of the Taylor sisters' impact on 19th-century hymn traditions for children, see Alisa Clapp-Itnyre (2016) ''British Hymn Books for Children, 1800\u20131900: Re-Tuning the History of Childhood''.</ref> In the two volumes of ''Original Poems for Infant Minds'', the Taylor sisters, O'Keeffe and the other contributors were identified as authors for each poem by initial or other identifying markers. In ''Rhymes for the Nursery'' (1806), Ann and Jane Taylor were not identified as authors of the collection or of individual poems. The most famous piece in the 1806 collection is \"The Star,\" commonly known today as \"[[Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star]]\", which was set to a French tune.\n\nChristina Duff Stewart identifies authorship in ''Rhymes for the Nursery'' based on a copy belonging to [[Isaac Taylor (canon)|Canon Isaac Taylor]], who noted the pieces by Ann and Jane Taylor.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=Christina Duff |title=The Taylors of Ongar: An Analytical Bio-Bibliography |publisher=[[Garland Publishing]] |year=1975 |location=New York & London |pages= |isbn=}}</ref> Canon Isaac was Taylor's nephew, a son of her brother [[Isaac Taylor]] of [[Stanford Rivers]]. Stewart also confirms attributions of ''Original Poems'' based on the publisher's records.\n\nJane Taylor also wrote the popular moral verse, ''The Violet'', which begins:\n<poem>\n''Down in a green and shady bed,\n''A modest violet grew; \n''Its stalk was bent, it hung its head\n''As if to hide from view. \n''And yet it was a lovely flower,\n''Its colour bright and fair; \n''It might have graced a rosy bower,\n''Instead of hiding there.''\n</poem>\n\nTaylor's novel ''Display'' (1814), reminiscent of [[Maria Edgeworth]] or perhaps even [[Jane Austen]], went through at least 13 editions up to 1832. Her ''Essays in Rhyme'' appeared in 1816, and contained some significant poetry. In the fictional ''Correspondence between a Mother and Her Daughter at School'' (1817), Taylor collaborated with her mother. ''The Family Mansion. A Tale'' appeared in 1819, and ''Practical Hints to Young Females'' some time before 1822.<ref>''Women Writers IV. R\u2013Z''. Catalogue of Jarndyce, Antiquarian Booksellers, London, Summer 2012.</ref>\n\nJane Taylor accepted the editorship of the religious ''Youth's Magazine''. She wrote numerous shorter pieces for the magazine, including moral tales and personal essays, and these were collected in ''The Contributions of Q. Q.''  Throughout her life, Taylor wrote many essays, plays, stories, poems, and letters which were never published. She was also erroneously named as author of works such as ''The Authoress'' (1819), ''Prudence and Principle'' (1818), and ''Rachel: A Tale'' (1817).<ref>Donelle Ruwe, \"[Jane Taylor]'s The Authoress: Aesthetics, Pedagogy, and a Parody of the Amateur Lady Author.\" ''ANQ: A Quarterly Journal of Short Articles, Notes, and Reviews'' 20.4 (Fall 2007): 44\u201350; see also Rainer Sch\u00f6werling's introduction to his facsimile edition of ''The Authoress: A Tale.'' [London: Taylor and Hessey, 1819. Germany: Belsar Verlag, 1988].</ref>\n\n===Death===\nJane Taylor died on 13 April 1824 of [[breast cancer]] at the age of 40, her mind still \"teeming with unfulfilled projects\". She was buried at Ongar churchyard in [[Essex]]. After her death, her brother Isaac collected many of her works and included a biography of her in ''The Writings of Jane Taylor, In Five Volumes'' (1832).\n\n==Popular influence==\n*Taylor's most famous verse, \"[[Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star]]\", is almost always uncredited. \"Its opening stanza persists as if it were folklore, the name of its creator almost entirely forgotten.\"<ref>Paula R.

One of the first missions with the PRC was to capture a suicide bomber in [[Urozgan Province|Urozgan]] before he had the opportunity to attack. The operation was conducted in darkness \"When they found the suicide bomber they were chasing, a barrel pressed against his temple was used to ease the man awake.\" Now the enemy was secure, along with his explosive vest, and rockets, the PRC commanders, and their own magistrate, had a stand off with Hastie \u2014 insisting that they should execute the captured man.<ref name=\":2\" /> The \"person under confinement\" was escorted to prison by Hastie and his team. \n\n==== 5.

The order was given for all personnel to put on armour and helmets if they were moving outside of secure buildings. An airstrike was considered once the exact location of the bomber was found, however, it was decided to neutralise the threat using Hastie's unit, on the ground. The force element was flown in on two Australian [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]]<nowiki/>s, the bomber located and killed, and the team extracted. From wheels down to wheels up had taken 22 minutes. There were no force injuries or casualties. <blockquote>It was the SOTG machine at its most efficient and precise. When we got back and the order was given to all on base that they could take off the body armour and helmets when outside there was a sigh of relief. There was no doubt about that mission.

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2019-09-11.151.1&s=speaker:10843#g151.2|title=Peel-Harvey Estuary: 11 Sep 2019: House debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:AH with family (KN).jpg|thumb|Ruth and Andrew Hastie with their children in Mandurah, October 2018]]\nHastie met his wife Ruth in the summer of 2007 while he was studying at [[George Washington University]].

One of the first missions with the PRC was to capture a suicide bomber in [[Urozgan Province|Urozgan]] before he had the opportunity to attack. The operation was conducted in darkness \"When they found the suicide bomber they were chasing, a barrel pressed against his temple was used to ease the man awake.\" Now the enemy was secure, along with his explosive vest, and rockets, the PRC commanders, and their own magistrate, had a stand off with Hastie \u2014 insisting that they should execute the captured man.<ref name=\":2\" /> The \"person under confinement\" was escorted to prison by Hastie and his team. \n\n==== 5. Truck bomb ====\nHastie's B Company received intelligence of a Taliban plan to use a truck to enter their own [[Forward operating base]]. The order was given for all personnel to put on armour and helmets if they were moving outside of secure buildings. An airstrike was considered once the exact location of the bomber was found, however, it was decided to neutralise the threat using Hastie's unit, on the ground. The force element was flown in on two Australian [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]]<nowiki/>s, the bomber located and killed, and the team extracted. From wheels down to wheels up had taken 22 minutes. There were no force injuries or casualties. <blockquote>It was the SOTG machine at its most efficient and precise. When we got back and the order was given to all on base that they could take off the body armour and helmets when outside there was a sigh of relief. There was no doubt about that mission.

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty.

Her dreams to study abroad are halted by pregnancy after Jung Gyo-bin ([[Byun Woo-min]]) takes advantage of her when she was drunk. She decides to marry him and give up on her dreams in order to be a responsible mother to her unborn child. Eun-jae's pregnancy soon meets with a tragic miscarriage when she tries to protect her mother in law, Baek Mi-in ([[Geum Bo-ra]]), when she was pushed down the steps by a creditor of the said in-law. Eun-jae falls and loses her baby. It takes a long time until Eun-jae becomes pregnant again. Around this time, Shin Ae-ri ([[Kim Seo-hyung]]) returns from her five-year-long studies from France where she studied make-up.\n\nAe-ri grew up in the same household as Eun-jae ever since she became an orphan when she was 10 years old. Her family was on the way to the Goo's household in order to have dinner with them when Ae-ri threw the clothes and doll at her father who was driving. Also because her father was driving during a storm, they ended crashing the car. Both Ae-ri's parents dies and the Goo Family takes in Ae-ri and raise her for 20 years along with Eun-jae, treating her as if she was their own daughter. Later on, Ae-ri becomes the girlfriend of Eun-jae's brother, Kang-jae ([[Choi Joon-yong]]). Then, she would have left for France, revealing that someone was taking care of her tuitions for her.\n\nAfter 7 years of living with the Jung family as Gyo-bin's housewife (and also as the housekeeper to the Jung family's mansion), Eun-jae soon discovers that her husband has been cheating on her with Ae-ri. It turns out that it was he who had funded Ae-ri's travel to France. To add to this insult, Ae-ri reveals that she bore Gyo-bin's child five years prior named Jung Ni-no ([[Jung Yun-seok]]). Eun-jae's brother, Kang-jae, comes to know about the situation, upon which he sets out in anger to assault Gyo-bin. This event leads to Kang Jae and his mother in forcing Eun-jae to sign consent for a divorce. After the divorce, Gyo-bin and Ae-ri marry while Eun-jae moves back to her own family's house. Ae-ri goes to pay a visit to Eun-jae, demanding her to get an abortion. Eun-jae refuses to do so because of which Gyo-bin drags her to a gynecologist in Sokcho, forcing her into aborting their baby. Eun-jae again refuses. Gyo-bin then drives her to Sokcho Beach, throwing her necklace, given by her father-in-law as a promise not to give up on Gyo-bin, into the sea. Eun-jae tries to save the necklace, but not knowing how to swim, she soon finds herself being dragged away by the waves. Eun-jae begs Gyo-bin to save her baby but Gyo-bin ignores Eun-jae and abandons her at sea to drown and die. Ae-ri and Gyo-bin decide to keep this all a secret, lying that Eun-jae had committed suicide. Ae-ri fakes Eun-jae's suicide note which she gives to the police and Gyo-bin thereafter tells everybody that he had not seen Eun-jae the whole day.\n\nIn the midst of all this, Min Gun-woo ([[Lee Jae-hwang]]), the adoptive son of Lady Min ([[Jung Ae-ri]]) was near Sokcho in a search for his missing younger stepsister, Min So-hee ([[Chae Young-in]]). So-hee loved Gun-woo and wanted to marry him. When her mother, Lady Min refused, So-hee told Gun-woo to marry her secretly anyway. Gun-woo had decided not to tell his mother what was happening, as So-hee had run away from home. Lady Min arranged for another girl to marry Gun-woo, hoping that So-hee will give up and come back. So-hee arranges a marriage to Gun-woo on the same day as Lady Min arranges marriage. Gun-wo decides to follow his mother's wishes and marries the other girl. So-hee devastated that he did not come, then walks into the sea to drown herself. Gun-woo, searching for So-hee, finds Eun-jae's unconscious body instead. He then takes her to a physician doctor who reveals that she must lose the baby in order for her to be saved. Through the help of Gun-woo and the doctor, Eun-jae is allowed to live in the hospital for free where she worked at the same time to show her gratitude.\n\nLady Min, thinking Eun-jae's experience was similar to hers, introduces Eun-jae to her home. Thereafter, Eun-jae takes on the identity of So-hee, in order to seek revenge against Gyo-bin and Ae-ri who had destroyed her life and tried to kill her. Gun-woo falls in love with Eun-jae in the process and Eun-jae with Gun-woo, but Eun-jae decides to hold her feelings back for him in order to fulfill her revenge. Ae-ri gets suspicious of the woman claiming to be So-hee. One day, the two women meet and Ae-ri is positive that So-hee is Eun-jae. Eun-jae acted well and said that Ae-ri was crazy. Gyo-bin divorces Ae-ri and marries So-hee (Eun-jae). Gyo-bin kicks Ae-ri out of her house but keeps Ni-no, his son with Eun-jae.\n\nAe-ri gets even more suspicious and calls Gyo-bin when she sees So-hee (Eun-jae) and Gun-woo embrace each other. So-hee (Eun-jae) reassures that she loves Gyo-bin and that's why she has married him, ensuring him that Gun-woo and she are just close siblings. Gyo-bin wants to sleep with So-hee (Eun-jae), but she brings twin beds instead of one big bed and refuses his advances. Ae-ri begs for Gyo-bin and his family to give her son to her. Ae-ri gets Ni-no, but Ni-no gets injured and Ae-ri pities her son as she is now poor and would not be able to provide him a comfortable life. She returns Ni-no to Gyo-bin's family.\n\nSo-hee (Eun-jae) soon becomes worried about her true identity to be revealed by Ae-ri. So, with the help of Lady Min, they go to her parents and tells them the truth who helps her to have her true identity still covered. In order to complete her revenge, she tricks Gyo-bin to give all his family assets to her and her \"mother\" Lady Min, his father's company, their house, his mother's house and land and causes their family to go bankrupt. Lady Min had a history with Gyo Bin's father. They had a child together (they were not married) named Star. To Lady Min, Gyo Bin's father supposedly killed Star due to a sickness that was never treated and killed Lady Min's father by stealing their land. Lady Min gets revenge by telling him to give all his assets (including Cheonji Constructions) and selling his house because of items on properties that were created by Gyo-bin to Lady Min. Because of this, he complied and gave them up. To humiliate his family further, Lady Min gets his family to switch houses with Eun-jae's family, or his large house will be auctioned and sold away. Gyo-bin's family is now poor while Eun-jae's family is now living more comfortably. Gyo-bin says that he now loves Eun-jae and tries to force her to stay with him since they are still lawfully wedded but the disgusted Eun-jae hates him.\n\nThe real So-hee comes alive and she was suffering from serious depression. She gets mad at Eun-jae because Gun-woo has fallen in love with her and they had planned a wedding where So-hee later crashes. One day, when Eun-jae goes to work and when everyone was praising her for her make-up artist skills, So-hee tells all the workers that she was the real daughter of Lady Min and she proclaims herself the owner of Min Beauty Shop. Ae-ri sees this and asks So-hee to cooperate with her to ruin Eun-jae's life. At first, this works out. Later, when Ae-ri becomes the reason for Gun-woo to divorce So-hee, their collaboration ends. Lady Min persuades Gun-woo to marry So-hee because he thinks her depression would get better and Soo Hee won't ruin Eun-jae's life. So-hee does the complete opposite.\n\nEun-jae continues to become the best makeup artist and lives now with her family. One day, Gun-woo goes to work to sign a contract with Harrison. Ae-ri wants to be back with Gyo-bin and bring back the position he had before and also the construction company, so Ha-jo ([[Kim Dong-hyun (actor)|Kim Dong-hyun]]) tells Gyo-bin to sign the contract. Meanwhile, So-hee ruins Eun-jae's artwork and rips a page out. While they fight, Ae-ri calls Gyo-bin about how Eun-jae was being attacked by So-hee. Gun-woo turns the car and drives to the Beauty Shop. He sees So-hee ripping the page and tells her to divorce him. Gun-woo is now late for his meeting, so Ha-jo tells Gyo-bin to sign the contract instead. Gun-woo decides to divorce So-hee no matter what. Ae-ri comes back to the family. She makes Gyo-bin sleep with her, making her pregnant. While she is pregnant, doctors discover that she has a tumor in her stomach. Doctors reluctantly tell her to get an abortion so she could receive the cancer treatment, but she adamantly refuses. She felt that the baby was the only way to keep her and Gyo-bin together.\n\nAe-rii and Eun-jae participate in a makeup competition that has three stages. In the first stage, Eun-jae, another lady, and Ae-ri won and would be competing against one another. Ae-ri and Eun-jae wn advances to the next round and would be competing against each other. In the third stage, Ae-ri gets desperate so she secretly bribes the judges. The judges are just about to proclaim Ae-ri as the grand prize winner, but find out just in time about the bribes, so they disqualify Ae-ri and awards Eun-jae as the winner. Ae-ri has a miscarriage, but this time after realizing her mistakes, Eun-jae find the heart to forgive her childhood best friend and both of them become true friends again. Eun-jae insists that Ae-ri get the cancer treatment, but Ae-ri is scared that the chemotherapy will make her not be as beautiful as she once was and also overwhelmed by the guilt of her past actions, and decides to let cancer kill her.\n\nIn the last episode, Ha-neul / Star ([[Oh Young-sil]]) marries and becomes pregnant with her husband Kang-jae. Ae-ri and Gyo-bin go on vacation during which Ae-ri makes a seashell necklace for Ni-no. Ae Ri begins to make two letters, one for Gyo-bin and the other for Eun-jae. Overwhelmed by her guilt and knowing that she will die someday, Ae-ri goes to the ocean to commit suicide but Gyo-bin attempts to save her. Ae-ri screams at him to let her go and reasons out with hims that he needs to take care of Ni-no and that she was going to die anyway. He was going to save her however, the current was too strong. Both of them drowns and dies. All the families attend their funeral. Eun-jae gives Ni-no the seashell necklace saying that it was the last present from his mother. Ni-no goes onto the street and a car nearly crashes into him. He states his mother and father were on the other side of the street. Everybody assumes that they were protecting their son from danger. Ae-ri's letter to Eun-jae said to bury her ashes on the beach where Eun-jae had almost died in.\n\nSo-hee and Lady Min decide to go to America together. Lady Min gives Ha-jo the papers to own Cheonji Constructions once more. Gun-woo meets Eun-jae while she was spreading the ashes. He apologizes for hurting her feelings and that he wouldn't do it again. He feels that Eun-jae should be his wife. So-hee gives Eun-jae two rings and a letter entrusting Gun Woo to Eun-jae. Gun-woo puts his arm around Eun-jae and looks at the sky with her. They are sure that they saw Ae-ri and Gyo-bin together.

Her dreams to study abroad are halted by pregnancy after Jung Gyo-bin ([[Byun Woo-min]]) takes advantage of her when she was drunk. She decides to marry him and give up on her dreams in order to be a responsible mother to her unborn child. Eun-jae's pregnancy soon meets with a tragic miscarriage when she tries to protect her mother in law, Baek Mi-in ([[Geum Bo-ra]]), when she was pushed down the steps by a creditor of the said in-law. Eun-jae falls and loses her baby. It takes a long time until Eun-jae becomes pregnant again. Around this time, Shin Ae-ri ([[Kim Seo-hyung]]) returns from her five-year-long studies from France where she studied make-up.\n\nAe-ri grew up in the same household as Eun-jae ever since she became an orphan when she was 10 years old. Her family was on the way to the Goo's household in order to have dinner with them when Ae-ri threw the clothes and doll at her father who was driving. Also because her father was driving during a storm, they ended crashing the car. Both Ae-ri's parents dies and the Goo Family takes in Ae-ri and raise her for 20 years along with Eun-jae, treating her as if she was their own daughter. Later on, Ae-ri becomes the girlfriend of Eun-jae's brother, Kang-jae ([[Choi Joon-yong]]). Then, she would have left for France, revealing that someone was taking care of her tuitions for her.\n\nAfter 7 years of living with the Jung family as Gyo-bin's housewife (and also as the housekeeper to the Jung family's mansion), Eun-jae soon discovers that her husband has been cheating on her with Ae-ri. It turns out that it was he who had funded Ae-ri's travel to France. To add to this insult, Ae-ri reveals that she bore Gyo-bin's child five years prior named Jung Ni-no ([[Jung Yun-seok]]). Eun-jae's brother, Kang-jae, comes to know about the situation, upon which he sets out in anger to assault Gyo-bin. This event leads to Kang Jae and his mother in forcing Eun-jae to sign consent for a divorce. After the divorce, Gyo-bin and Ae-ri get married while Eun-jae moves back to her own family's house. Ae-ri goes to pay a visit to Eun-jae, demanding her to get an abortion. Eun-jae refuses to do so because of which Gyo-bin drags her to a gynecologist in Sokcho, forcing her into aborting their baby. Eun-jae again refuses. Gyo-bin then drives her to Sokcho Beach, throwing her necklace, given by her father-in-law as a promise not to give up on Gyo-bin, into the sea. Eun-jae tries to save the necklace, but not knowing how to swim, she soon finds herself being dragged away by the waves. Eun-jae begs Gyo-bin to save her baby but Gyo-bin ignores Eun-jae and abandons her at sea to drown and die. Ae-ri and Gyo-bin decide to keep this all a secret, lying that Eun-jae had committed suicide. Ae-ri fakes Eun-jae's suicide note which she gives to the police and Gyo-bin thereafter tells everybody that he had not seen Eun-jae the whole day.\n\nIn the midst of all this, Min Gun-woo ([[Lee Jae-hwang]]), the adoptive son of Lady Min ([[Jung Ae-ri]]) was near Sokcho in a search for his missing younger stepsister, Min So-hee ([[Chae Young-in]]). So-hee loved Gun-woo and wanted to marry him. When her mother, Lady Min refused, So-hee told Gun-woo to marry her secretly anyway. Gun-woo had decided not to tell his mother what was happening, as So-hee had run away from home. Lady Min arranged for another girl to marry Gun-woo, hoping that So-hee will give up and come back. So-hee arranges a marriage to Gun-woo on the same day as Lady Min arranges marriage. Gun-wo decides to follow his mother's wishes and marries the other girl. So-hee devastated that he did not come, then walks into the sea to drown herself. Gun-woo, searching for So-hee, finds Eun-jae's unconscious body instead. He then takes her to a physician doctor who reveals that she must lose the baby in order for her to be saved. Through the help of Gun-woo and the doctor, Eun-jae is allowed to live in the hospital for free where she worked at the same time to show her gratitude.\n\nLady Min, thinking Eun-jae's experience was similar to hers, introduces Eun-jae to her home. Thereafter, Eun-jae takes on the identity of So-hee, in order to seek revenge against Gyo-bin and Ae-ri who had destroyed her life and tried to kill her. Gun-woo falls in love with Eun-jae in the process and Eun-jae with Gun-woo, but Eun-jae decides to hold her feelings back for him in order to fulfill her revenge. Ae-ri gets suspicious of the woman claiming to be So-hee. One day, the two women meet and Ae-ri is positive that So-hee is Eun-jae. Eun-jae acted well and said that Ae-ri was crazy. Gyo-bin divorces Ae-ri and marries So-hee (Eun-jae). Gyo-bin kicks Ae-ri out of her house but keeps Ni-no, his son with Eun-jae.\n\nAe-ri gets even more suspicious and calls Gyo-bin when she sees So-hee (Eun-jae) and Gun-woo embrace each other. So-hee (Eun-jae) reassures that she loves Gyo-bin and that's why she has married him, ensuring him that Gun-woo and she are just close siblings. Gyo-bin wants to sleep with So-hee (Eun-jae), but she brings twin beds instead of one big bed and refuses his advances. Ae-ri begs for Gyo-bin and his family to give her son to her. Ae-ri gets Ni-no, but Ni-no gets injured and Ae-ri pities her son as she is now poor and would not be able to provide him a comfortable life. She returns Ni-no to Gyo-bin's family.\n\nSo-hee (Eun-jae) soon becomes worried about her true identity to be revealed by Ae-ri. So, with the help of Lady Min, they go to her parents and tells them the truth who helps her to have her true identity still covered. In order to complete her revenge, she tricks Gyo-bin to give all his family assets to her and her \"mother\" Lady Min, his father's company, their house, his mother's house and land and causes their family to go bankrupt. Lady Min had a history with Gyo Bin's father. They had a child together (they were not married) named Star. To Lady Min, Gyo Bin's father supposedly killed Star due to a sickness that was never treated and killed Lady Min's father by stealing their land. Lady Min gets revenge by telling him to give all his assets (including Cheonji Constructions) and selling his house because of items on properties that were created by Gyo-bin to Lady Min. Because of this, he complied and gave them up. To humiliate his family further, Lady Min gets his family to switch houses with Eun-jae's family, or his large house will be auctioned and sold away. Gyo-bin's family is now poor while Eun-jae's family is now living more comfortably. Gyo-bin says that he now loves Eun-jae and tries to force her to stay with him since they are still lawfully wedded but the disgusted Eun-jae hates him.\n\nThe real So-hee comes alive and she was suffering from serious depression. She gets mad at Eun-jae because Gun-woo has fallen in love with her and they had planned a wedding where So-hee later crashes. One day, when Eun-jae goes to work and when everyone was praising her for her make-up artist skills, So-hee tells all the workers that she was the real daughter of Lady Min and she proclaims herself the owner of Min Beauty Shop. Ae-ri sees this and asks So-hee to cooperate with her to ruin Eun-jae's life. At first, this works out. Later, when Ae-ri becomes the reason for Gun-woo to divorce So-hee, their collaboration ends. Lady Min persuades Gun-woo to get married to So-hee because he thinks her depression would get better and Soo Hee won't ruin Eun-jae's life. So-hee does the complete opposite.\n\nEun-jae continues to become the best makeup artist and lives now with her family. One day, Gun-woo goes to work to sign a contract with Harrison. Ae-ri wants to be back with Gyo-bin and bring back the position he had before and also the construction company, so Ha-jo ([[Kim Dong-hyun (actor)|Kim Dong-hyun]]) tells Gyo-bin to sign the contract. Meanwhile, So-hee ruins Eun-jae's artwork and rips a page out. While they fight, Ae-ri calls Gyo-bin about how Eun-jae was being attacked by So-hee. Gun-woo turns the car and drives to the Beauty Shop. He sees So-hee ripping the page and tells her to divorce him. Gun-woo is now late for his meeting, so Ha-jo tells Gyo-bin to sign the contract instead. Gun-woo decides to divorce So-hee no matter what. Ae-ri comes back to the family. She makes Gyo-bin sleep with her, making her pregnant. While she is pregnant, doctors discover that she has a tumor in her stomach. Doctors reluctantly tell her to get an abortion so she could receive the cancer treatment, but she adamantly refuses. She felt that the baby was the only way to keep her and Gyo-bin together.\n\nAe-rii and Eun-jae participate in a makeup competition that has three stages. In the first stage, Eun-jae, another lady, and Ae-ri won and would be competing against one another. Ae-ri and Eun-jae wn advances to the next round and would be competing against each other. In the third stage, Ae-ri gets desperate so she secretly bribes the judges. The judges are just about to proclaim Ae-ri as the grand prize winner, but find out just in time about the bribes, so they disqualify Ae-ri and awards Eun-jae as the winner. Ae-ri has a miscarriage, but this time after realizing her mistakes, Eun-jae find the heart to forgive her childhood best friend and both of them become true friends again. Eun-jae insists that Ae-ri get the cancer treatment, but Ae-ri is scared that the chemotherapy will make her not be as beautiful as she once was and also overwhelmed by the guilt of her past actions, and decides to let cancer kill her.\n\nIn the last episode, Ha-neul / Star ([[Oh Young-sil]]) marries and becomes pregnant with her husband Kang-jae. Ae-ri and Gyo-bin go on vacation during which Ae-ri makes a seashell necklace for Ni-no. Ae Ri begins to make two letters, one for Gyo-bin and the other for Eun-jae. Overwhelmed by her guilt and knowing that she will die someday, Ae-ri goes to the ocean to commit suicide but Gyo-bin attempts to save her. Ae-ri screams at him to let her go and reasons out with hims that he needs to take care of Ni-no and that she was going to die anyway. He was going to save her however, the current was too strong. Both of them drowns and dies. All the families attend their funeral. Eun-jae gives Ni-no the seashell necklace saying that it was the last present from his mother. Ni-no goes onto the street and a car nearly crashes into him. He states his mother and father were on the other side of the street. Everybody assumes that they were protecting their son from danger. Ae-ri's letter to Eun-jae said to bury her ashes on the beach where Eun-jae had almost died in.\n\nSo-hee and Lady Min decide to go to America together. Lady Min gives Ha-jo the papers to own Cheonji Constructions once more. Gun-woo meets Eun-jae while she was spreading the ashes. He apologizes for hurting her feelings and that he wouldn't do it again. He feels that Eun-jae should be his wife. So-hee gives Eun-jae two rings and a letter entrusting Gun Woo to Eun-jae. Gun-woo puts his arm around Eun-jae and looks at the sky with her. They are sure that they saw Ae-ri and Gyo-bin together. The whole drama ended by having the two couples smiling at each other.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Jang Seo-hee]] as Goo Eun-jae / Min So-hee\n* [[Byun Woo-min]] as Jung Gyo-bin\n* [[Kim Seo-hyung]] as Shin Ae-ri / Michelle Shin\n* [[Lee Jae-hwang]] as Min Gun-woo\n\n===Supporting===\n{{colbegin}}\n====Eun-jae's Family====\n* [[Kim Yong-gun]] as Goo Young-soo\n:Eun-jae's father\n* [[Yoon Mi-ra]] as Yoon Mi-ja\n:Eun-jae's mother\n* [[Choi Joon-yong]] as Goo Kang-jae\n:Eun-jae's big brother and also his antagonist\n\n====Gyo-bin's Family====\n* [[Kim Dong-hyun (actor)|Kim Dong-hyun]] as Jung Ha-jo\n: Gyo-bin's father\n* [[Geum Bo-ra]] as Baek Mi-in \n: Gyo-bin's mother\n* [[Oh Young-sil]] as Jung Ha-neul / Star\n: Gyo-bin's stepsister, Lady Min & Ha-jo's love child\n* [[Song Hee-ah]] as Jung Soo-bin\n: Gyo-bin's little sister\n* [[Jung Yun-seok]] as Jung Ni-no\n: Gyo-bin & Ae-ri's son\n\n====Gun-woo's Family====\n* [[Jung Ae-ri]] as Min Hyun-joo / Lady Min\n: Gun-woo's adopt mother\n* [[Chae Young-in]] as Min So-hee\n: Gun-woo's adopt little sister\n{{colend}}\n\n==Controversy==\nTemptation of a Wife has been widely criticized for its content and production.
