In 2004, Austrian author [[Barbara Neuwirth]] wrote the text for ''Eurydike'', a piece which was commissioned for the [[Brucknerfest]] in Linz, and included a chamber orchestra, drama and dance ensemble.   \n \nIn 2004, the company increased its staff of artistic directors and choreographers to include Arturas Valudskis, Rebecca Murgi, Shlomo Bitton, Teresa Ranieri, Mahmoud Aboudoma, Robert Pienz and Iris Heitzinger.\n\n[[File:1997, Heartbeat, editta braun company.jpg|thumb|1997, Heartbeat, editta braun company]]\nOver the years, outstanding artists from various disciplines (besides dance: drama, composition, direction, writing, dramaturgy, video, light design) have contributed their creative potential to the company. In the beginning, the company\u2019s dance style was especially influenced by C\u00e9line Guillaume and Georg Blaschke, the work together with dance legend [[Jean Babil\u00e9e]], for whom [[Jean Cocteau]] and [[Roland Petit]] created [[Le jeune homme et la mort]], was particularly sensational, immensely furthering the company\u2019s international acclaim. Composer Peter Valentin contributed his work during this time.\n\nFor ten years, dancer Barbara Motschiunik played a main role in each production; in 2006, Anna Maria M\u00fcller and Tomaz Simatovic joined the group, together with Juan Dante Murillo Bobadilla.\n\nSince 2010, several younger performers have joined the company, including Iris Heitzinger, Martyna Lorenc, Jerca Roznik Novak and others.

For instance, one roentgen deposits  {{convert|0.00877|Gy|rad|abbr=off|lk=on}} of [[absorbed dose]] in dry air, or {{convert|0.0096|Gy|rad|abbr=on}} in soft tissue.<ref>{{cite web|title=APPENDIX E: Roentgens, RADs, REMs, and other Units|url=http://web.princeton.edu/sites/ehs/radsafeguide/rsg_app_e.htm|work=Princeton University Radiation Safety Guide|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=10 May 2012}}</ref> One roentgen of X-rays may deposit anywhere from {{convert|0.01|to|0.04|Gy|rad|abbr=on}} in bone depending on the beam energy.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sprawls|first=Perry|title=Radiation Quantities and Units|url=http://www.sprawls.org/ppmi2/RADQU/3RADQU08.gif|work=The Physical Principles of Medical Imaging, 2nd Ed|accessdate=10 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAs the science of [[radiation dosimetry]] developed, it was realised that the ionising effect, and hence tissue damage, was linked to the energy absorbed, not just radiation exposure.

He was hired to kidnap and presumably murder Phil McCormick. He attacked Phil at his workplace and dragged him to his car and tossed him in his trunk. On his way to his destination, Malvo got into an accident in rural [[Minnesota]], hitting a deer, and sustained a head injury. The crash caused his trunk to pop open, allowing McCormick to escape. McCormick, however, died shortly thereafter by freezing to death. After getting his injury checked out at the local hospital, Malvo meets [[Lester Nygaard]] waiting in line to receive treatment for an accident. Lester tells Malvo about how his nose was broken by a man named Sam Hess, a childhood bully. Lester makes a joke about killing Hess, and Malvo takes the suggestion seriously. He asks Lester for confirmation on whether he wants Hess dead or not, but Lester gives no answer. Lester's name is called and a nurse repeatedly urges Lester to move along, which makes him rise in annoyance and yell \"yeah\" which Malvo might have interpreted as approval. Later, Malvo murders Hess at a strip club by throwing a knife into the back of his head while Hess is in the middle of having sex with a stripper.\n\nWhen Lester hears of Sam's death, he confronts Malvo in a coffee shop, where Malvo encourages him to take matters into his own hands. Later that night, after being aggravated by his wife, Lester murders her and calls Malvo for help. Lester plans to murder Malvo with his shotgun and blame his wife's death on Malvo once he arrives, but the local police chief, Vern Thurman, arrives first. As Vern is preparing to arrest Lester after noticing a blood trail that leads to his wife's corpse, Malvo appears and shoots Thurman twice, retreating downstairs where he mysteriously disappears. Malvo eventually steals Lester's car and is later pulled over for speeding in [[Duluth, Minnesota]], where he threatens Deputy Gus Grimly, who lets him go out of fear.\n\nThe next day, Malvo visits a local post office to get a package sent by his employer which contains his new identity: Frank Peterson, a minister and respected member of his community. Malvo then meets with his next client, supermarket \"king\" Stavros Milos. Malvo is hired to track down the individual blackmailing Stavros, who he later finds out to be Don Chumph, the fitness trainer for Stavros' soon to be ex-wife. Malvo confronts Chumph and takes over the blackmail operation, using Chumph as his lackey in the endeavor. Deputy Gus Grimly, who had previously let Malvo go, spots him on the side of the road and arrests him for murder and car theft. While on the way to the police station, Malvo tells Grimly that he is making a big mistake. Malvo alters his look with a pair of stolen glasses and other alterations to his attire, after having arrived at the police station. He uses his new false identity as Frank Peterson to persuade the police to let him go. As a result of the arrest and subsequent misunderstanding, Gus is put on desk work and removed from the field.\n\nMeanwhile, Malvo begins taunting Stavros psychologically, which included killing his dog and replacing his medication with [[adderall]]. He also rigs his shower to spray blood instead of water, and releases hundreds of crickets into Stavros' supermarket. Malvo does this to allude to the [[Book of Exodus]], a play on Stavros' deep religious views. While Stavros decides to take the blackmail money back to where he originally found it in [[Fargo (film)|1987]], Malvo rigs Chumph to an exercise machine and tapes a shotgun to his hands. When \"Chumph\" (Malvo) takes a few shots out of a window, Malvo leaves. The shots trigger the SWAT team to come to Chumph's house. This causes Chumph to be gunned down as it appears that he is armed and dangerous. Coincidentally, Stavros' son Dmitri is accidentally killed in a car crash during the ongoing whiteout, completing Malvo's Book of Exodus plot.\n\nWhile driving during the whiteout, Malvo's car is attacked and trapped by two men, [[Mr. Wrench and Mr. Numbers]]. They then exit their cars and begin firing handguns and assault rifles at Malvo. After escaping the initial assault, Malvo evades the assailants, taking refuge in the whiteout. Malvo later deliberately cuts the top of his hand and leaves a trail of blood in the snow as bait, which Mr. Numbers follows and is subsequently caught and stabbed repeatedly until he answers Malvo's question about who hired the two hitmen. When he responds with \"Fargo\", Malvo slits his throat and leaves him to bleed out in the snow. Picking up Mr. Numbers' assault rifle, Malvo moves on, attempting unsuccessfully to find Mr. Wrench.\n\nNow set on finding out who is responsible for the assault, Malvo visits his employer Mr. Rundle in Nevada. When Rundle fails to provide the information he wants, Malvo murders him and eventually traces the source of the attack to the Fargo Crime Syndicate. With this new information, Malvo enters the crime syndicate's main base of operations and massacres 22 people within a matter of minutes by himself. Later he locates and pays a visit to Mr. Wrench, who is recovering in the hospital. When he awakens, Malvo taunts Wrench on the death of his partner Mr. Numbers. However, Malvo gives Wrench the key to his handcuffs, and tells him that he respects him for coming closer to killing him than anyone has. He tells Wrench that if he still feels raw about things after he heals, that he should come track him down and try again.\n\n=== 2007 ===\nOne year later, Malvo now lives in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] as a dentist named Michaelson. He is there to befriend Dr. Burt Canton so that he can find and kill Burt's brother, who is in the [[witness protection program]]. To get even closer to Canton, Malvo gets engaged to Canton's dental assistant Jemma Stalone. While staying in Las Vegas with Jemma, Canton, and Canton's wife for a night before going to meet and kill Canton's brother, Malvo is recognized by Lester Nygaard, who was in the same bar as him. Lester engages Malvo, but Malvo acts like he has never met him before and threatens him to just walk away while his group is preparing to leave. Lester refuses to pretend that he does not know Malvo and joins him and his group in the elevator. Malvo questions Lester, asking him if this is what he really wants. When Lester says yes, Malvo pulls out his gun and kills Canton, Canton's wife, and Jemma. Malvo tells Lester about how the bounty he was working on for the past 6 months is now defunct, and tells Lester to assist him in dragging and disposing the bodies in a dumpster. Scared for his life, Lester strikes Malvo on the head with his trophy and runs away.\n\nMalvo then follows Lester back to Minnesota and visits Lou Solverson's diner, asking around about Lester's whereabouts only to leave without the information and only moments before Deputy [[Molly Solverson]] and two [[FBI]] agents arrive to discuss how to track down Malvo himself. Meanwhile, Lester and his new wife Linda prepare to go to Acapulco to escape Malvo and the police, but need to stop by their shop to get their passports. When Lester sends Linda, wearing his coat, to get the passports to see if Malvo is actually there, Malvo emerges from the shadows and shoots and kills Linda, thinking she was Lester.\n\nMalvo then moves into a remote cabin listening to a police scanner to monitor Lester's interactions with the police. Malvo also breaks into the car of FBI agents Pepper and Budge to get their credentials and to call FBI headquarters to cancel their requested backup. He then visits a local car dealership and steals a car resembling the FBI car, taking the salesman hostage. Malvo then waits outside the police station and trails Lester when the agents drive him home. While Pepper and Budge stand guard outside Lester's house, Malvo's car pulls up in front of them. They go to see who is inside the vehicle and see that the salesman is driving, with his hands ductaped to the steering wheel. Malvo then approaches them from behind, shooting and killing them both.\n\nMalvo then breaks into Lester's home and steps on a hidden beartrap, severely damaging his left leg. Lester then fires a shot at Malvo, but misses. Lester then tries to shoot again but his gun jams and he goes back to the bathroom. Malvo then leaves, and steals the FBI's car to get back to his cabin. When he arrives, Gus Grimly, who was waiting after spotting him leaving the cabin earlier in the day, confronts Malvo and shoots him, killing him. Gus is commended for bravery for his role in bringing down Malvo. While investigating his cabin, Molly discovers Malvo's collection of tapes, which feature recorded conversations with those Malvo has convinced to commit murder. There is a tape labelled with Lester's name which features a recording of the phone call he made to Malvo after Pearl's murder, at long last providing proof of Lester's guilt.\n\n== Personality ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2017}}\nMalvo is largely defined by his belief that human beings are, at the end of the day, still very much like primal beasts. He has fully embraced this philosophy and rarely behaves as though he has the slightest inclination of right and wrong; for example, he abducts a man in broad daylight without any regard for the witnesses or security cameras.\n\nMalvo advises Lester to remind his wife that \"[he is] still an ape\", as a way to demonstrate his masculinity and to fight back against his wife's domineering and criticism.\n\nLike other characters from [[Coen brothers]] works, such as [[Anton Chigurh]] and [[Hanzee Dent]], Malvo can be perceived as a personification of relentless and evolving violence, particularly in his slaughter of Moses Tripoli and his underlings at their headquarters in Fargo.\n\nIn addition to his complete disregard of traditionally accepted concepts of morality and constant readiness to commit extremely violent deeds, Malvo also shows an inclination to acts of low-level unpleasantness whose apparent goal is to spread misery and disrupt interpersonal relations around him. For example, in Episode One he talks a junior motel employee into urinating into his bullying boss's car tank and then anonymously informs the boss about the incident while it is happening. Similarly, in Episode Nine, he informs the new tenant of Lester Nygaard's old house in gruesome detail about the murders that happened there while the tenant's young children are listening, suggesting heavily that the ghost of the late Mrs Nygaard is still haunting the house.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe character of Lorne Malvo and Thornton's performance received critical acclaim from critics.<ref name=\"hitfixcriticsperformancepoll\" />\n\n[[Alan Sepinwall]] of ''[[HitFix]]'' praised Thornton's performance, calling it \"deadpan genius\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-fargo-the-six-ungraspables-its-so-hard-to-be-a-saint-in-the-city |title=Review: 'Fargo' \u2013 'The Six Ungraspables': It's so hard to be a saint in the city |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |date=May 13, 2014 |website=HitFix |access-date=July 8, 2016}}</ref> and wrote that Thornton \"is always a pleasure to watch, but the understated mode he's in for this role is perhaps the best use of his particular talents and screen presence.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/series-premiere-review-fargo-the-crocodiles-dilemma-gorilla-my-dreams |title=Series premiere review: 'Fargo' \u2013 'The Crocodile's Dilemma': Gorilla my dreams |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |date=April 15, 2014 |website=HitFix |access-date=July 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nMaureen Ryan of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' also praised Thornton's performance, writing that it \"is fascinating from his first moment on the show and steals the entire miniseries out from under everyone.

It\u2019s a delight to witness the restrained malevolence that rolls off Malvo. Like [[Los Pollos Hermanos]] proprietor [[Gus Fring]], Malvo is a man who knows exactly who he is and what he wants to do, and Thornton displays a similar level of coiled yet casual mastery.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/15/fargo-review_n_5154611.html |title=\u2018Fargo\u2019 Review: A Frosty Treat From The Frozen North |last=Ryan |first=Maureen |date=April 15, 2014 |website=The Huffington Post |access-date=July 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Fargo}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Malvo, Lorne}}\n[[Category:Fargo characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\n[[Category:Fictional con artists]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2014]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox character\n| color              = #AF181F\n| name               = Lorne Malvo\n| series             = [[Fargo (TV series)|Fargo]]\n| image              = Lorne Malvo Rifle.jpg\n| first_minor        = [[The Crocodile's Dilemma]]\n| first_date         = April 15, 2014\n| last_minor         = [[Morton's Fork (Fargo)|Morton's Fork]]\n| last_date          = June 17, 2014\n| creator            = [[Noah Hawley]]\n| portrayer          = [[Billy Bob Thornton]]\n| aliases            = Duluth<br />Dr. Michaelson<br />Saint Paul<br />Frank Peterson\n| occupation         = Contract killer\n| significant_other  = Jemma Stalone\n}}\n\n'''Lorne Malvo''' is a fictional character and the main [[antagonist]] of the [[Fargo (season 1)|first season]] of the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] television series ''[[Fargo (TV series)|Fargo]]''.

McCormick, however, died shortly thereafter by freezing to death. After getting his injury checked out at the local hospital, Malvo meets [[Lester Nygaard]] waiting in line to receive treatment for an accident. Lester tells Malvo about how his nose was broken by a man named Sam Hess, a childhood bully. Lester makes a joke about killing Hess, and Malvo takes the suggestion seriously. He asks Lester for confirmation on whether he wants Hess dead or not, but Lester gives no answer. Lester's name is called and a nurse repeatedly urges Lester to move along, which makes him rise in annoyance and yell \"yeah\" which Malvo might have interpreted as approval. Later, Malvo murders Hess at a strip club by throwing a knife into the back of his head while Hess is in the middle of having sex with a stripper.\n\nWhen Lester hears of Sam's death, he confronts Malvo in a coffee shop, where Malvo encourages him to take matters into his own hands. Later that night, after being aggravated by his wife, Lester murders her and calls Malvo for help. Lester plans to murder Malvo with his shotgun and blame his wife's death on Malvo once he arrives, but the local police chief, Vern Thurman, arrives first. As Vern is preparing to arrest Lester after noticing a blood trail that leads to his wife's corpse, Malvo appears and shoots Thurman twice, retreating downstairs where he mysteriously disappears. Malvo eventually steals Lester's car and is later pulled over for speeding in [[Duluth, Minnesota]], where he threatens Deputy Gus Grimly, who lets him go out of fear.\n\nThe next day, Malvo visits a local post office to get a package sent by his employer which contains his new identity: Frank Peterson, a minister and respected member of his community. Malvo then meets with his next client, supermarket \"king\" Stavros Milos. Malvo is hired to track down the individual blackmailing Stavros, who he later finds out to be Don Chumph, the fitness trainer for Stavros' soon to be ex-wife. Malvo confronts Chumph and takes over the blackmail operation, using Chumph as his lackey in the endeavor. Deputy Gus Grimly, who had previously let Malvo go, spots him on the side of the road and arrests him for murder and car theft. While on the way to the police station, Malvo tells Grimly that he is making a big mistake. Malvo alters his look with a pair of stolen glasses and other alterations to his attire, after having arrived at the police station. He uses his new false identity as Frank Peterson to persuade the police to let him go. As a result of the arrest and subsequent misunderstanding, Gus is put on desk work and removed from the field.\n\nMeanwhile, Malvo begins taunting Stavros psychologically, which included killing his dog and replacing his medication with [[adderall]]. He also rigs his shower to spray blood instead of water, and releases hundreds of crickets into Stavros' supermarket. Malvo does this to allude to the [[Book of Exodus]], a play on Stavros' deep religious views. While Stavros decides to take the blackmail money back to where he originally found it in [[Fargo (film)|1987]], Malvo rigs Chumph to an exercise machine and tapes a shotgun to his hands. When \"Chumph\" (Malvo) takes a few shots out of a window, Malvo leaves. The shots trigger the SWAT team to come to Chumph's house. This causes Chumph to be gunned down as it appears that he is armed and dangerous. Coincidentally, Stavros' son Dmitri is accidentally killed in a car crash during the ongoing whiteout, completing Malvo's Book of Exodus plot.\n\nWhile driving during the whiteout, Malvo's car is attacked and trapped by two men, [[Mr. Wrench and Mr. Numbers]]. They then exit their cars and begin firing handguns and assault rifles at Malvo. After escaping the initial assault, Malvo evades the assailants, taking refuge in the whiteout. Malvo later deliberately cuts the top of his hand and leaves a trail of blood in the snow as bait, which Mr. Numbers follows and is subsequently caught and stabbed repeatedly until he answers Malvo's question about who hired the two hitmen. When he responds with \"Fargo\", Malvo slits his throat and leaves him to bleed out in the snow. Picking up Mr. Numbers' assault rifle, Malvo moves on, attempting unsuccessfully to find Mr. Wrench.\n\nNow set on finding out who is responsible for the assault, Malvo visits his employer Mr. Rundle in Nevada. When Rundle fails to provide the information he wants, Malvo murders him and eventually traces the source of the attack to the Fargo Crime Syndicate. With this new information, Malvo enters the crime syndicate's main base of operations and massacres 22 people within a matter of minutes by himself. Later he locates and pays a visit to Mr. Wrench, who is recovering in the hospital. When he awakens, Malvo taunts Wrench on the death of his partner Mr. Numbers. However, Malvo gives Wrench the key to his handcuffs, and tells him that he respects him for coming closer to killing him than anyone has. He tells Wrench that if he still feels raw about things after he heals, that he should come track him down and try again.\n\n=== 2007 ===\nOne year later, Malvo now lives in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] as a dentist named Michaelson. He is there to befriend Dr. Burt Canton so that he can find and kill Burt's brother, who is in the [[witness protection program]]. To get even closer to Canton, Malvo gets engaged to Canton's dental assistant Jemma Stalone. While staying in Las Vegas with Jemma, Canton, and Canton's wife for a night before going to meet and kill Canton's brother, Malvo is recognized by Lester Nygaard, who was in the same bar as him. Lester engages Malvo, but Malvo acts like he has never met him before and threatens him to just walk away while his group is preparing to leave. Lester refuses to pretend that he does not know Malvo and joins him and his group in the elevator. Malvo questions Lester, asking him if this is what he really wants. When Lester says yes, Malvo pulls out his gun and kills Canton, Canton's wife, and Jemma. Malvo tells Lester about how the bounty he was working on for the past 6 months is now defunct, and tells Lester to assist him in dragging and disposing the bodies in a dumpster. Scared for his life, Lester strikes Malvo on the head with his trophy and runs away.\n\nMalvo then follows Lester back to Minnesota and visits Lou Solverson's diner, asking around about Lester's whereabouts only to leave without the information and only moments before Deputy [[Molly Solverson]] and two [[FBI]] agents arrive to discuss how to track down Malvo himself. Meanwhile, Lester and his new wife Linda prepare to go to Acapulco to escape Malvo and the police, but need to stop by their shop to get their passports. When Lester sends Linda, wearing his coat, to get the passports to see if Malvo is actually there, Malvo emerges from the shadows and shoots and kills Linda, thinking she was Lester.\n\nMalvo then moves into a remote cabin listening to a police scanner to monitor Lester's interactions with the police. Malvo also breaks into the car of FBI agents Pepper and Budge to get their credentials and to call FBI headquarters to cancel their requested backup. He then visits a local car dealership and steals a car resembling the FBI car, taking the salesman hostage. Malvo then waits outside the police station and trails Lester when the agents drive him home. While Pepper and Budge stand guard outside Lester's house, Malvo's car pulls up in front of them. They go to see who is inside the vehicle and see that the salesman is driving, with his hands ductaped to the steering wheel. Malvo then approaches them from behind, shooting and killing them both.\n\nMalvo then breaks into Lester's home and steps on a hidden beartrap, severely damaging his left leg. Lester then fires a shot at Malvo, but misses. Lester then tries to shoot again but his gun jams and he goes back to the bathroom. Malvo then leaves, and steals the FBI's car to get back to his cabin. When he arrives, Gus Grimly, who was waiting after spotting him leaving the cabin earlier in the day, confronts Malvo and shoots him, killing him. Gus is commended for bravery for his role in bringing down Malvo. While investigating his cabin, Molly discovers Malvo's collection of tapes, which feature recorded conversations with those Malvo has convinced to commit murder. There is a tape labelled with Lester's name which features a recording of the phone call he made to Malvo after Pearl's murder, at long last providing proof of Lester's guilt.\n\n== Personality ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2017}}\nMalvo is largely defined by his belief that human beings are, at the end of the day, still very much like primal beasts. He has fully embraced this philosophy and rarely behaves as though he has the slightest inclination of right and wrong; for example, he abducts a man in broad daylight without any regard for the witnesses or security cameras.\n\nMalvo advises Lester to remind his wife that \"[he is] still an ape\", as a way to demonstrate his masculinity and to fight back against his wife's domineering and criticism.\n\nLike other characters from [[Coen brothers]] works, such as [[Anton Chigurh]] and [[Hanzee Dent]], Malvo can be perceived as a personification of relentless and evolving violence, particularly in his slaughter of Moses Tripoli and his underlings at their headquarters in Fargo.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe character of Lorne Malvo and Thornton's performance received critical acclaim from critics.<ref name=\"hitfixcriticsperformancepoll\" />\n\n[[Alan Sepinwall]] of ''[[HitFix]]'' praised Thornton's performance, calling it \"deadpan genius\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-fargo-the-six-ungraspables-its-so-hard-to-be-a-saint-in-the-city |title=Review: 'Fargo' \u2013 'The Six Ungraspables': It's so hard to be a saint in the city |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |date=May 13, 2014 |website=HitFix |access-date=July 8, 2016}}</ref> and wrote that Thornton \"is always a pleasure to watch, but the understated mode he's in for this role is perhaps the best use of his particular talents and screen presence.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/series-premiere-review-fargo-the-crocodiles-dilemma-gorilla-my-dreams |title=Series premiere review: 'Fargo' \u2013 'The Crocodile's Dilemma': Gorilla my dreams |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |date=April 15, 2014 |website=HitFix |access-date=July 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nMaureen Ryan of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' also praised Thornton's performance, writing that it \"is fascinating from his first moment on the show and steals the entire miniseries out from under everyone.

It\u2019s a delight to witness the restrained malevolence that rolls off Malvo. Like [[Los Pollos Hermanos]] proprietor [[Gus Fring]], Malvo is a man who knows exactly who he is and what he wants to do, and Thornton displays a similar level of coiled yet casual mastery.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/15/fargo-review_n_5154611.html |title=\u2018Fargo\u2019 Review: A Frosty Treat From The Frozen North |last=Ryan |first=Maureen |date=April 15, 2014 |website=The Huffington Post |access-date=July 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Fargo}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Malvo, Lorne}}\n[[Category:Fargo characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\n[[Category:Fictional con artists]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2014]]\n", "name_user": "87.175.91.169", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200ePersonality)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorne_Malvo"}

Based on the 2015 Census of population by the Philippine Statistics Authority, the highly urbanized cities of Metro Manila were listed as being some of the densest cities in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://psa.gov.ph/content/philippine-population-density-based-2015-census-population |title=Philippine Population Density (Based on the 2015 Census of Population) &#124; Philippine Statistics Authority |website=Psa.gov.ph |date=2016-09-01 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n\nEmerson Carlos, MMDA assistant general manager for operation, mentioned that in 2015, the total motor vehicles registered in Metro Manila have already peaked at 2.5 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://manilastandard.net/news/metro/183101/metro-crowded-with-2-5m-autos.html |title=Metro crowded with 2.5m autos |newspaper=[[Manila Standard]] |date=2015-07-26 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n\n== Causes ==\n=== Infrastructure problems ===\nOne of the primary causes of traffic density within Metro Manila is the current transportation infrastructure. Overall, there is a lack of quality infrastructure thus insufficient modes of mobility. The Duterte administration has promised that the coming years will be the, \"golden age of infrastructure\",<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|last1=France-Press|first1=Agence|title=Philippines aims for \u2018golden age of infrastructure|url=http://business.inquirer.net/225770/philippines-aims-golden-age-infrastructure|website=INQUIRER.net|accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref> with a record $168 billion to be spent on 5,000 projects across the nation\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Road network====\nThe road network of Metro Manila consists of radial (R-1 to R-10) and circumferential (C-1 to C-5) roads. These are the principal arteries within the city, however given the density of vehicles within the metropolis the roads have become inadequate. \"Metro Manila only has 1 km of road per 424 vehicles.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|last1=Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and National Economic Development Agency (NEDA)|title=Roadmap for Transport Infrastructure Development for Metro Manila and Its Surrounding Areas|date=March 2014|publisher=ALMEC Corporation|pages=2\u20134|url=http://libopac.jica.go.jp/images/report/12149597.pdf|accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the roads are of poor quality and do not receive maintenance. For example, in the scope of the entire country, \"Of the 31,400 km of national roads in the system, only about 45% (14,200 km) were assessed as being in good or fair condition in November 2011.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Asian Development Bank|title=Philippines: Transport Sector Assessment, Strategy, and Road Map|url=https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/33700/files/philippines-transport-assessment.pdf|format=PDF|website=Adb.org|accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref> The poor quality of roads has made road-transportation inefficient. Furthermore, this has contributed to the increase in road accidents, which therefore affects both traffic congestion and public health.\n\n====The railway system====\n[[File:Manila Line 2 train approaching Katipunan Station.jpg|thumb|[[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 2|Line 2]]]]\n[[File:MRT-3 Train Taft Avenue 2.jpg|thumb|[[Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 3|Line 3]]]]\n\nThe current railways carry around 1.3 million passengers per day and spans 79&nbsp;km in 4 different lines.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1998, plans for a railway expansion were implemented however only 5&nbsp;km of the planned 73&nbsp;km was actually built. As such, there exists a lack of an adequate non-road-based public transportation system.<ref name=\":1\" /> This is made evident with the problem of overcrowding during peak hours.\n\n====Road-based Public Transport====\nIn Metro Manila, there exists a variety of road-based public transport, such as tricycles, taxis, buses, and jeepneys which are all privately owned. While there is such a prevalence of these modes of transportation, these \"account for more than 50% of daily commuting trips, incur no subsidy, and with low productivity.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> Meanwhile, \"car travel accounts for 30% of person-km, but constitutes 72% of the road traffic in terms of PCU-km.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> The high number of vehicles on the road, which could be attributed to the high population, is one of the contributors to traffic congestion.\n\n=== Urban planning problems ===\nThe layout of Metro Manila lacks holistic and intrinsic planning from the ground up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/understanding-urban-planning-land-use-transportation-and-traffic/272140/|title=Understanding urban planning, land use, transportation and traffic - The Manila Times Online|website=www.manilatimes.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-09}}</ref> The poor design did not account for the density of the city or the eventual propensity to vehicles. A classic example is the fact that the city hosts more vehicles than the roads could afford. Furthermore, laws and policies that are meant to mitigate such poor design are not enforced properly.\n\n====Urban area expansion====\nThe urban area of Metro Manila experiences a high growth rate in population. Within the period of 2000-2001, the city experienced a rate of 1.8%.<ref name=\":1\" /> This growth rate is a result of the spillover of people from nearby towns, cities, and provinces. As the main hub of the Philippines, the influx of people is foreseeable yet the city has not taken such into account. Thus, the urban planning of the city is not adequate vis a vis the high population density. Statistics show that the city must \"accommodate about an additional two million to six million by 2030.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> Thus, if such trend continues, 224 persons per hectare is estimated. This high population thus calls for an appropriate transportation system to allow for mobility within the city.\n\n====Traffic congestion====\n\"Today, traffic demand is at 12.8 million trips in Metro Manila. Most of these trips are made using the public transport owing to its 69% share of total trips. The lesser share of the trips is done by private mode and yet it is this mode that takes up 78% of road space.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />  At the current state, the traffic volume within the metropolis already exceeds the capacities of existing roads. The urban planning failed to bring into fruition a public transport system that could function in the dense, compact city of Metro Manila.\n\n=== Economic theories ===\nThe Roadmap for Transport Infrastructure for Metro Manila and its Surrounding Areas (Region III & Region IV-A) study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in response to the National Economic Development (NEDA) request for assistance in creating a guide for transport development in Metro Manila, the two regions of Central Luzon and CALABARZON. The guide was made to help NEDA deliberate on the contents of a short-term (2014 - 2016) and a medium term (2017 - 2022) transport investment program (TRIP).\n\nFor the short-term transport investment program (TRIP), it takes the goals of the Philippine Development Plan for 2011 to 2016 and makes it into projects in the transport sector. It has invested as much as 5% of the GDP in infrastructure as one of the five key strategies to achieving the TRIP. A huge difference from the previous investing rate, which was as low as 2% of the GDP.\n\nSame study has also found that during their research period, the Metro Manila traffic was costing the city and the people Php 2.4 billion per day in the year 2012. And, if no measures are undertaken, this transport cost can rise up to Php 6.0 billion per day in 2030. This is will be worst-case scenario in the increase of transport costs in Metro Manila and the areas of Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna, and Cavite  if there will be no improvements done on the transport infrastructure of these areas and the Philippines overall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libopac.jica.go.jp/images/report/12149597.pdf |format=PDF |title=ROADMAP FOR TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT FOR METRO MANILA AND ITS SURROUNDING AREAS (REGION III & REGION IV-A) |website=Libopac.jica.go.jp |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n\n=== High population ===\nIn Busina: Current State, Alternatives and Emerging Filipino Values on Metro Manila Traffic, Metro Manila is classified as a global power city. This is because of majority of the industries present in the Philippines have located their offices in the National Capital Region (NCR). The city is also where all the foreign consulates and embassies are situated. This makes NCR the home of finance and commerce, hence the allure of in-migration from Filipinos from the provinces. Although this is not the main cause of road traffic in the city, the influx of people adds to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/24720903/Busina_Current_State_Alternatives_and_Emerging_Filipino_Values_on_Metro_Manila_Traffic |title=Busina: Current State, Alternatives and Emerging Filipino Values on Metro Manila Traffic &#124; Chester Cabalza |website=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Heavy road traffic (andalucia, sampaloc, Manila)(2014-11-12).jpg|thumb|Heavy traffic congestion along [[Alfonso Mendoza Street]] (formerly Calle Andaluc\u00eda), Manila]]\nYves Boquet, in his paper Battling Congestion in Manila: The EDSA Problem, quotes [[Robert Cervero]] in saying globalization, outsourcing and relocating much of the manufacturing activities are just some of the other causes that add to the high population in Metro Manila. These activities are mainly responsible for the influx that was previously mentioned. These activities are creating the job that appeal to people in the province to make the move.\n\n=== Growing number of private 4-wheel vehicles ===\nAnother cause of heavy traffic in the cities is the increase of the purchasing power of most people in Metro Manila.<ref name=\"unescap1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/bulletin82_Article-4.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Chapter04_YVES BOQUET_Battling congestion in Manila |format=PDF |website=Unescap.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref> According to Euromonitor\u2019s Consumer Lifestyles in the Philippines (2015), young professionals in the Metro tend to buy small cars such as Toyota Wigo, Mitsubishi Mirage, and Honda Jazz that adds to road congestion.

All of which are accommodated on barely 0.2% of the country\u2019s land area.<ref name=\"unescap1\"/>\n\nAccording to the study of MMDA<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bworldonline.com/how-many-vehicles-pass-through-edsa-each-day/|title=How many vehicles pass through EDSA everyday? {{!}} BusinessWorld|last=Gloria|first=Mira|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref>, in EDSA alone, there are 247,527 private 4-wheel vehicles that ply everyday. It has the highest number compared to [[Motorcycle|motorcycles]], [[Taxicab|taxi]], [[bus]], and  [[Truck|trucks]].\n\n=== Public transportation system ===\n[[File:Public transport - jeepneys and buses (Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City)(2017-12-04) 2.jpg|thumb|Traffic congestion created by jeepneys and buses along [[Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City|Commonwealth Avenue]]]]\nThe main modes of public transport in the Philippines are [[jeepney]]s, [[bus]]es, taxis, trains and [[Motorized tricycle (Philippines)|tricycle]]s, all of which are readily available in Metro Manila. The introduction of transportation apps Grab and Uber came in 2013 and 2014, respectively, further widening the options of public transport. The Philippine traffic was considered the world\u2019s 9th worst in 2015 by Numbeo despite this range of public transport options. Although there is a wide array of choices, the public still spend an average of 45.5 minutes before reaching their workplace. This is why most Filipinos still find travelling via public transport inconvenient due to the high vehicle density and the unavoidable traffic congestion, according to Euromonitor\u2019s Consumer Lifestyles in the Philippines (2015).<ref name=\"euromonitor1\"/>\n\n=== Road accidents ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Road Accident in the Philippine.jpg|thumb|Road accident in the Philippines (2014) {{deletable image-caption|18 July 2017|f11}}]] -->\nAccording to Metro Manila Accident Reporting and Analysis System (MMARAS) data from 2008 to 2011 and a study of the severity of road crashes in Metro Manila, accidents that involved heavy and multiple vehicles, and an elderly pedestrian (60 years old and above), as well as those that occurred during the evening (7 pm to midnight) and late at night (1 am to 5 am) had significantly higher odds of resulting in a fatal outcome. But when the crash involves a female pedestrian and when the road surface is wet the odds of a fatal outcome are lower. \nThe study found that most accidents involving pedestrians happen on high-speed, high-traffic-volume, multilane roadways, that are surrounded by land uses that generate a mix of heavy vehicular and pedestrian traffic. It was also found that fatal crashes involving pedestrian happen close to different types of transit stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:350213/datastream/PDF/view |format=PDF |title=Severity of Road Crashes Involving Pedestrians in Metro Manila, Philippines |author1=Nina Verzosa |author2=Rebecca Miles |website=Diginole.lib.fsu.edu |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n\n== Effects ==\n\n=== Societal ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nThe congestion of vehicles on the road is not entirely unhealthy for the society. In a more specific viewpoint, the congestion between vehicles within a particular region, allows the circulation of other vehicles. Congestion occurs inevitably in highly urbanized sectors where the ratio between the population of people and the given area is not proportional and when the demand is high. In some cases, it is even desirable up to a certain point since getting rid of it imposes higher costs than allowing it to persist. The main social effects that occur due to the congestion of vehicles are namely: wasting of time (non-productivity; opportunity cost), delays, frustrated drivers/motorists/passengers, encouraging road rage.\n\n====Wasting of time====\nThe time spent in traffic can be considered as unproductive or generally, a waste of time. The concept of opportunity cost comes into play especially for people who have other places to be instead of being stuck in traffic.\n\n====Delays====\nThe traffic congestion in highly urbanized cities can be a huge detriment in terms of the delivery of goods from once place to another, leading to the loss of trust between parties who rely heavily on these daily deliveries for the benefit of their own businesses. Essentially, it may lead to situations such as: late arrival for work, important meetings, and school, which may result in lost business, disciplinary action or other personal losses. Delays may also come in the form of congestion may interfere with the flow of traffic when it comes to emergency cases (ambulance, police cars, etc.)\n\n====Frustrated Drivers====\nThe most commonly known effect of heavy traffic congestion would be in the form of \"Road Rage\". Road Rage is the aggressive behavior of an automobile driver which includes rude gestures, such as face clapping, verbal insults and deliberate reckless driving that may endanger the lives of both the drivers and the people surrounding them.\n\n=== Economic ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nTraffic congestion, in some cities, does more good than bad to a certain extent. And in other cities, it does more bad than good. Congestion on the road, from an Economic viewpoint suggests that higher levels of congestion are related to faster economic growth. However, above a certain limit, congestion starts to become a detriment to economic growth and the overall welfare of society, rather than an asset. This is due to the cost of the alleviation of congestion in some cities would be higher than the cost of congestion itself.\n\n'''Delays'''\nThe traffic congestion in highly urbanized cities can be a huge detriment in terms of the delivery of goods from once place to another, leading to the loss of trust between parties who rely heavily on these daily deliveries for the benefit of their own businesses. In any case, delivery of raw materials to be turned into finished products or inventory is a time-sensitive task, and traffic congestion does not contribute positively to this sector.\n\n'''Damaged Vehicles'''\nThe depreciation on vehicles as a result of staying still in traffic and the often use of acceleration and brakes, eventually resulting into more repairs or expenses in general.\n\n'''Loss of Revenue for Public Transport'''\nPublic transport, trucks and other services are also affected by the traffic in Metro Manila. Instead of being able to do three or four round trips, they usually end up doing less; which means a significant loss in revenues, and ultimately leading to a failing business. Public transportation also suffers in that the available schedules become less frequent and the time spent waiting is longer.\n\n=== Environmental effects ===\n[[File:Espa\u00f1a Boulevard2.jpg|thumb|Afternoon rush hour traffic congestion at [[Espa\u00f1a Boulevard]].]]\nAside from social and economic effects, traffic congestion also has massive effects on the environment, specifically its contribution to air pollution. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution is defined as the contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by chemical, physical, or biological means. Air pollution is an \u201cinvisible danger\u201d that people must not ignore. Despite the fact that it cannot be seen, air pollution has affected the lives of a number of Filipinos. The WHO said that air pollution is killing millions worldwide, including those in developing countries like the Philippines. Furthermore, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) noted that dirty air threatens the lives of 12 million residents.<ref name=\"manilatimes1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/the-lurking-menace-to-health-and-economy/92149/ |title=The lurking menace to health and economy |website=Manilatimes.net |date=2014-04-27 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n\nThe effects of pollutants found in vehicle exhaust include the following:<ref name=\"environmentalleader1\">{{cite web|last=Hermes |first=Jennifer |url=https://www.environmentalleader.com/2012/01/how-traffic-jams-affect-air-quality/ |title=How Traffic Jams Affect Air Quality |publisher=Environmental Leader |date=2012-01-05 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n* High levels of nitrogen oxide are toxic to humans\n* Sulfur dioxide is the primary cause of acid rain\n* Carbon dioxide contributes to climate change by insulating more heat from the sun\n* Ozone can impair lung function\n\nAccording to the National Emissions Inventory, last 2012, 71% of the air pollution in the Philippines comes from vehicles on the road. Furthermore, the situation is much worse in the National Capital Region (NCR), wherein 85% of the air pollution comes from vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/healthandwellness/536203/stress-pollution-fatigue-how-traffic-jams-affect-your-health/story/ |title=Stress, pollution, fatigue: How traffic jams affect your health &#124; Lifestyle &#124; GMA News Online |website=Gmanetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref> Also, based on data gathered from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Metro Manila\u2019s air quality situation has worsened in terms of total suspended particulates. There was a rise from 106&nbsp;\u00b5g/Ncm in July to December 2014 to 130&nbsp;\u00b5g/Ncm in January to April 2015, which are both above the maximum safe level of 90&nbsp;\u00b5g/Ncm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/715587/metros-air-quality-getting-worse-study |title=Metro's air quality getting worse\u2014study &#124; Inquirer News |website=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2015-08-23 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n\nThe more cars there are on the road, the more pollution is emitted into the air. This is because motor vehicles are one of the main sources of pollution in the world. On the other hand, there is an inverse relationship between the moving speed of traffic and air pollution. The slower the traffic moves, the more pollution is emitted into the air. This is due to the fact that cars burn the most fuel when accelerating to get up to speed. More gas is used up whenever there is an on and off pressing on the gas and break pedals during traffic jams.<ref name=\"environmentalleader1\"/>\n\nThus air pollution continues to be a serious threat in the Philippines. There have been efforts to lessen the number of vehicles on the road and the production of fuel-efficient green cars with reduced emissions, but air pollution remains to be a problem. The Guardian said that \u201cdespite all the promises of green growth and reduced emissions, traditional car sales are accelerating, while efforts to shift towards \u2018greener\u2019 hybrid and electric vehicles are stuck in neutral, particularly in the place where it matters most.\u201d <ref name=\"manilatimes1\"/>\n\n== Countermeasures ==\n=== Department of Transportation ===\n{{See also|Department of Transportation (Philippines)}}\nIn August of 2016, The Department of Transportation (DOTr), in charge of the country\u2019s transportation systems, has moved towards a more integrated approach to managing traffic on Metro Manila\u2019s roads. To do so, the department divided the metropolis into 10 traffic sectors so as to be able to share assets among other government agencies involved in traffic management such as the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), the highway Patrol Group of the Philippine National Police (HPG-PNP), the Land Transportation Office (LTO) and the Land Transportation Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB). According to the DOTr, by combining forces and coming up with a single chain of command, the agencies will be able to collaborate for better traffic monitoring,  uniform implementation of penalties and joint training for traffic personnel.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2016/08/17/dotr-acts-better-address-traffic-congestion-metro-manila-492031 |title=DOTr acts to better address traffic congestion in Metro Manila |website=SunStar.com.ph |date= |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n\n=== Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MMDA lining up.jpg|thumb|MMDA lining up {{deletable image-caption|18 July 2017|f11}}]] -->\n{{See also|Metropolitan Manila Development Authority}}\nThe Metropolitan Manila Development Authority\u2019s (MMDA) services include urban development planning, solid waste disposal, flood control and sewerage management, urban, renewal and zoning, health and sanitation, urban protection, pollution control, public safety during calamities and/or disasters and transport and traffic management; the latter acting as the MMDA\u2019s most visible function.  Although the presence of MMDA traffic enforcers on the cities\u2019 roads seem to be, for the most part, their greatest effort, there are a number of other traffic management initiatives they implement.\n\n====The Unified Vehicular Volume Reduction Program (UVVRP) ====\n{{see also|Unified Vehicular Volume Reduction Program}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MMDA Number Coding Scheme.jpg|thumb|MMDA's proposed number coding scheme during 2013 {{deletable image-caption|18 July 2017|f11}}]] -->\nThe Unified Vehicular Volume Reduction Program (UVVRP) is what is more commonly referred to as the \u201ccolor coding\u201d or \u201cnumber coding\u201d system implemented by the MMDA. It is a travel demand management program meant to ration road space based on the license plates of vehicles; by regulating the number of vehicles using the roads, the program thereby reduces volume and eases traffic congestion.\n\nThe scheme was intended to be a temporary solution in light of the traffic congestion caused by infrastructure projects in the 1990s. Despite that the UVVRP was not created to be a long-term policy, at present it is still being used and remains to be one of the MMDA\u2019s most well-known traffic initiatives.<ref>Regidor, Jose Regin F. \"Traffic Congestion in Metro Manila: Is the UVVRP Still Effective?.\" Philippine Engineering Journal 34, no. 1 (2013).</ref>\n\nThe first version of the UVVRP was implemented in 1995. During the 1990s, there were many road and railway infrastructure projects being built throughout Metro Manila; in order to address the resulting increase in congestion, the MMDA issued Regulation No. 95-001 or the \u201cOdd-Even Scheme.\u201d The scheme banned private vehicles with less than three passengers from passing restricted roads during AM and PM peak periods on particular days. Vehicles in use for public transportation, emergencies, police and military, school buses, diplomatic matters and official media were exempted from this regulation.\n\nOn Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, vehicles with license plates that ended in odd numbers were restricted from use; while those that ended in even numbers were restricted from use on Mondays, Wednesday and Fridays. The peak periods during which the vehicles were banned were defined to be from 7:00-9:00 am and 5:00-7:00pm. Per violation, there was a P300 penalty charged to offenders.\n\nRegulation 96-or the  \u201cModified Odd-Even Scheme\u201d was then issued in 1996. This scheme applied to public utility vehicles such as taxis, buses, public utility jeepneys, etc., which are banned from all streets of Metro Manila on particular days of the week from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM based on the plate number ending of each vehicle, as follows: 1 and 2 on Mondays, 3 and 4 on Tuesdays, 5 and 6 on 7 Wednesdays, 7 and 8 on Thursdays, 9 and 0 on Fridays. This regulation took effect February 19, 1996 and covered all roads in Metropolitan Manila.\n\n1996 was also the year the MMDA, adopted Regulation 96-005 entitled the \u201cUnified Vehicular Volume Reduction Program\u201d as a replacement of Regulations Nos. 95-001 and 96-004. This program aimed to regulate the operation of certain motor vehicles on all national, city and municipal roads in Metropolitan Manila. Under this scheme, private vehicles are banned for longer hours (i.e., between 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM).\n\nIn 2003, the UVVRP was modified to allow for a window time between 10:00 AM to 3:00PM which was considered to be the off-peak period within the day when restricted vehicles could travel along the specified roads. This scheme, however, was not uniformly adopted in all cities and municipalities throughout metropolis due to differing traffic conditions.\n\nIn 2010, the UVVRP included both public transportation and private vehicles under the scheme.<ref>Regidor, Jose Regin F., and Noriel Christopher C. Tiglao. \"Alternative Solutions to Traffic Problems: Metro Manila in Retrospect.\" In 11th World Conference on Transport Research. 2007.</ref>\n\nToday, the provision of the UVVRP are as follows: vehicles cannot drive around Metro Manila based on the last digit of the license plate. 1 and 2 are banned on Mondays, 3 and 4 on Tuesdays, 5 and 6 on Wednesdays 7 and 8 on Thursdays and 9 and 0 on Fridays. The period of the UVVRP is from 7am to 8pm without window hours and it applies to national, circumferential and radial roads in the metropolis.\n\nThe plate numbers restrained from driving within Metro Manila are summarized into this table:<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.mmda.gov.ph/20-faq/1748-all-about-number-coding-uvvrp |title=All about number coding (UVVRP) |website=Mmda.gov.ph |date=2010-11-15 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Under this scheme, trucks are prohibited from traveling along major road networks for most of the day, depending on the type and weight of truck. It has been in place since 1978 and restrains large trucks to designated routes in order to give way to other road users.  Infractions of the ban carry a fine of P2000.<ref>Regidor, J.R.F. and Tiglao, N.C.C., 2007. Alternative Solutions to Traffic Problems: Metro Manila in Retrospect.

This act prohibited cargo trucks with a gross vehicular weight of over 4000 kilograms from driving along eleven major roads in Metro Manila during peak traffic hours (6:00 am\u2013 9:00am, and 4:00pm\u20138:00pm) daily except on weekends.\n\nThe Department of Transportation and Communication issued Memorandum Circulars No. 90-367 in 1990 which repealed the previous truck ban schedule and changed it to the following:\n* 7:00am \u2013 10:00 am on weekdays \n* 4:00pm \u2013 8:00pm Monday-Thursday \n* 4:00pm \u2013 9:00 pm on Fridays\n\nIn 1991, in response to the appeal for an alternate route and reduction of the truck ban, the MMDA issues Ordinance No. 19, amending the original Ordinance No. 78-04. This provided alternate routes to those included in the truck ban and allowed a 2-hour reduction of the truck ban period resulting in these effects:  \n* 7:00am \u2013 9:00 am on weekdays\n* 5:00pm \u2013 8:00pm Monday-Thursday\n* 4:00pm \u2013 9:00 pm on Fridays\n\nThis was further amended when Ordinance No. 5 Series of 1994 was issued. As a result, trucks were banned from the major arterial road Epifanio Delos Santos Avenue. This was an \u201call-day\u201d ban that lasted from 6:00am \u2013 9:00pm and was implemented Monday through Friday. It also restricted trucks from passing along 10 major routes between these particular hours:\n\u2022\t6:00am \u2013 9:00am (daily with the exception of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays)\n\u2022\t5:00pm \u2013 9:00pm (daily with the exception of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays)\n\nSince then, the MMDA has issued Regulation No. 96-008 in 1996 thus extending truck ban to Saturdays; leaving only Sundays and holidays as the exception. This was done in desire to further reduce traffic congestion experienced throughout the week. The gross capacity weight of trucks was also changed from 4,000 kilograms to 4,500 kilograms by the issuance of Regulation No. 99-002.\n\n====U-Turn Scheme====\n[[File:Taguig-c5-kalayaan-2012-01.JPG|thumb|An elevated U-turn slot at [[Circumferential Road 5|Carlos P. Garcia Avenue or C-5 Road]] in Taguig]]\n[[File:MMDA U-turn slot at EDSA-North 2005.jpg|thumb|A U-turn slot along [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]].]]\nThe U-turn Scheme was implemented by the MMDA in 2002 primarily to account for roundabout operations on the road. This entailed the creation of median opens along busy arterial roads and was composed of two originally separate schemes: the \u201cBig Rotunda Scheme\u201d and the \u201cClearway Scheme\u201d.\n\n;Big Rotunda Scheme\n* Construction of median opening pairs\n* Closing intersection by use of temporary barriers\n\n;Clearway Scheme\n* Promote uninterrupted flow along arterial roads\n* Meant to speed up congestion along clogged roads\n\nEssentially, the scheme resulted in the closing of many road intersections as well as the suspension of traffic signal operations in order to allow for the system of median openings. The set up of the U-turn scheme caused lanes of vehicles approaching an intersection to converge and thus be diverted into a single stream towards the U-turn.\n\nThe U-turn scheme was first applied along [[Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City|Commonwealth Avenue]] in Quezon City and [[Marikina\u2013Infanta Highway]] in Pasig and Marikina. Later on, the scheme was also implemented in other areas on Metro Manila including various intersections along EDSA.<ref>Regidor, J.R.F., 2004. Analyzing Impacts of Transportation Infrastructure and Policies on Traffic Flow in Metro Manila Using Advanced Tools and Techniques. Philippine Engineering Journal, 25(1).</ref>\n\n====Social Media Platforms====\nSince 2010, the MMDA has tapped into the use of social media such as Twitter, in an effort to alleviate the traffic situation. Through such platforms, the MMDA is able to broadcast live updates to their followers, send out and respond to tweets 24 hours a day. The Twitter feed is mostly used to relay information regarding traffic, accidents and number coding (UVVRP) updates.\n\n====Mobile Application: MMDA Traffic Navigator====\nThe MMDA Traffic Navigator was a mobile application launched in 2011 for android and iOS meant to give users quick access to traffic situations surrounding the Metro Manila\u2019s major routes. It delivers real-time traffic updates in specific roads and highways by relying on CCTVs to assess the congestion in particular areas. In areas where there are no available CCTVs, reports are instead collected from traffic enforces. The application may be accessed via system view or line view; and provides indicators as to whether the current traffic is considered light, moderate or heavy.<ref>Consulta, A.D.M., Nariz, E.J.N. and Rosario, S.B., 2015.

Overall, there is a lack of quality infrastructure thus insufficient modes of mobility. The Duterte administration has promised that the coming years will be the, \"golden age of infrastructure\",<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|last1=France-Press|first1=Agence|title=Philippines aims for \u2018golden age of infrastructure|url=http://business.inquirer.net/225770/philippines-aims-golden-age-infrastructure|website=INQUIRER.net|accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref> with a record $168 billion to be spent on 5,000 projects across the nation\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Road network====\nThe road network of Metro Manila consists of radial (R-1 to R-10) and circumferential (C-1 to C-5) roads. These are the principal arteries within the city, however given the density of vehicles within the metropolis the roads have become inadequate. \"Metro Manila only has 1 km of road per 424 vehicles.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|last1=Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and National Economic Development Agency (NEDA)|title=Roadmap for Transport Infrastructure Development for Metro Manila and Its Surrounding Areas|date=March 2014|publisher=ALMEC Corporation|pages=2\u20134|url=http://libopac.jica.go.jp/images/report/12149597.pdf|accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the roads are of poor quality and do not receive maintenance. For example, in the scope of the entire country, \"Of the 31,400 km of national roads in the system, only about 45% (14,200 km) were assessed as being in good or fair condition in November 2011.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Asian Development Bank|title=Philippines: Transport Sector Assessment, Strategy, and Road Map|url=https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/33700/files/philippines-transport-assessment.pdf|format=PDF|website=Adb.org|accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref> The poor quality of roads has made road-transportation inefficient. Furthermore, this has contributed to the increase in road accidents, which therefore affects both traffic congestion and public health.\n\n====The railway system====\n[[File:Manila Line 2 train approaching Katipunan Station.jpg|thumb|[[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 2|Line 2]]]]\n[[File:MRT-3 Train Taft Avenue 2.jpg|thumb|[[Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 3|Line 3]]]]\n\nThe current railways carry around 1.3 million passengers per day and spans 79&nbsp;km in 4 different lines.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1998, plans for a railway expansion were implemented however only 5&nbsp;km of the planned 73&nbsp;km was actually built. As such, there exists a lack of an adequate non-road-based public transportation system.<ref name=\":1\" /> This is made evident with the problem of overcrowding during peak hours.\n\n====Road-based Public Transport====\nIn Metro Manila, there exists a variety of road-based public transport, such as tricycles, taxis, buses, and jeepneys which are all privately owned. While there is such a prevalence of these modes of transportation, these \"account for more than 50% of daily commuting trips, incur no subsidy, and with low productivity.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> Meanwhile, \"car travel accounts for 30% of person-km, but constitutes 72% of the road traffic in terms of PCU-km.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> The high number of vehicles on the road, which could be attributed to the high population, is one of the contributors to traffic congestion.\n\n=== Urban planning problems ===\nThe layout of Metro Manila lacks holistic and intrinsic planning from the ground up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/understanding-urban-planning-land-use-transportation-and-traffic/272140/|title=Understanding urban planning, land use, transportation and traffic - The Manila Times Online|website=www.manilatimes.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-09}}</ref> The poor design did not account for the density of the city or the eventual propensity to vehicles. A classic example is the fact that the city hosts more vehicles than the roads could afford. Furthermore, laws and policies that are meant to mitigate such poor design are not enforced properly.\n\n====Urban area expansion====\nThe urban area of Metro Manila experiences a high growth rate in population. Within the period of 2000-2001, the city experienced a rate of 1.8%.<ref name=\":1\" /> This growth rate is a result of the spillover of people from nearby towns, cities, and provinces. As the main hub of the Philippines, the influx of people is foreseeable yet the city has not taken such into account. Thus, the urban planning of the city is not adequate vis a vis the high population density. Statistics show that the city must \"accommodate about an additional two million to six million by 2030.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> Thus, if such trend continues, 224 persons per hectare is estimated. This high population thus calls for an appropriate transportation system to allow for mobility within the city.\n\n====Traffic congestion====\n\"Today, traffic demand is at 12.8 million trips in Metro Manila. Most of these trips are made using the public transport owing to its 69% share of total trips. The lesser share of the trips is done by private mode and yet it is this mode that takes up 78% of road space.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />  At the current state, the traffic volume within the metropolis already exceeds the capacities of existing roads. The urban planning failed to bring into fruition a public transport system that could function in the dense, compact city of Metro Manila.\n\n=== Economic theories ===\nThe Roadmap for Transport Infrastructure for Metro Manila and its Surrounding Areas (Region III & Region IV-A) study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in response to the National Economic Development (NEDA) request for assistance in creating a guide for transport development in Metro Manila, the two regions of Central Luzon and CALABARZON. The guide was made to help NEDA deliberate on the contents of a short-term (2014 - 2016) and a medium term (2017 - 2022) transport investment program (TRIP).\n\nFor the short-term transport investment program (TRIP), it takes the goals of the Philippine Development Plan for 2011 to 2016 and makes it into projects in the transport sector. It has invested as much as 5% of the GDP in infrastructure as one of the five key strategies to achieving the TRIP. A huge difference from the previous investing rate, which was as low as 2% of the GDP.\n\nSame study has also found that during their research period, the Metro Manila traffic was costing the city and the people Php 2.4 billion per day in the year 2012. And, if no measures are undertaken, this transport cost can rise up to Php 6.0 billion per day in 2030. This is will be worst-case scenario in the increase of transport costs in Metro Manila and the areas of Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna, and Cavite  if there will be no improvements done on the transport infrastructure of these areas and the Philippines overall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libopac.jica.go.jp/images/report/12149597.pdf |format=PDF |title=ROADMAP FOR TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT FOR METRO MANILA AND ITS SURROUNDING AREAS (REGION III & REGION IV-A) |website=Libopac.jica.go.jp |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n\n=== High population ===\nIn Busina: Current State, Alternatives and Emerging Filipino Values on Metro Manila Traffic, Metro Manila is classified as a global power city. This is because of majority of the industries present in the Philippines have located their offices in the National Capital Region (NCR). The city is also where all the foreign consulates and embassies are situated. This makes NCR the home of finance and commerce, hence the allure of in-migration from Filipinos from the provinces. Although this is not the main cause of road traffic in the city, the influx of people adds to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/24720903/Busina_Current_State_Alternatives_and_Emerging_Filipino_Values_on_Metro_Manila_Traffic |title=Busina: Current State, Alternatives and Emerging Filipino Values on Metro Manila Traffic &#124; Chester Cabalza |website=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Heavy road traffic (andalucia, sampaloc, Manila)(2014-11-12).jpg|thumb|Heavy traffic congestion along [[Alfonso Mendoza Street]] (formerly Calle Andaluc\u00eda), Manila]]\nYves Boquet, in his paper Battling Congestion in Manila: The EDSA Problem, quotes [[Robert Cervero]] in saying globalization, outsourcing and relocating much of the manufacturing activities are just some of the other causes that add to the high population in Metro Manila.

It has the highest number compared to [[Motorcycle|motorcycles]], [[Taxicab|taxi]], [[bus]], and  [[Truck|trucks]].\n\n=== Public transportation system ===\n[[File:Public transport - jeepneys and buses (Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City)(2017-12-04) 2.jpg|thumb|Traffic congestion created by jeepneys and buses along [[Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City|Commonwealth Avenue]]]]\nThe main modes of public transport in the Philippines are [[jeepney]]s, [[bus]]es, taxis, trains and [[Motorized tricycle (Philippines)|tricycle]]s, all of which are readily available in Metro Manila. The introduction of transportation apps Grab and Uber came in 2013 and 2014, respectively, further widening the options of public transport. The Philippine traffic was considered the world\u2019s 9th worst in 2015 by Numbeo despite this range of public transport options. Although there is a wide array of choices, the public still spend an average of 45.5 minutes before reaching their workplace. This is why most Filipinos still find travelling via public transport inconvenient due to the high vehicle density and the unavoidable traffic congestion, according to Euromonitor\u2019s Consumer Lifestyles in the Philippines (2015).<ref name=\"euromonitor1\"/>\n\n=== Road accidents ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Road Accident in the Philippine.jpg|thumb|Road accident in the Philippines (2014) {{deletable image-caption|18 July 2017|f11}}]] -->\nAccording to Metro Manila Accident Reporting and Analysis System (MMARAS) data from 2008 to 2011 and a study of the severity of road crashes in Metro Manila, accidents that involved heavy and multiple vehicles, and an elderly pedestrian (60 years old and above), as well as those that occurred during the evening (7 pm to midnight) and late at night (1 am to 5 am) had significantly higher odds of resulting in a fatal outcome. But when the crash involves a female pedestrian and when the road surface is wet the odds of a fatal outcome are lower. \nThe study found that most accidents involving pedestrians happen on high-speed, high-traffic-volume, multilane roadways, that are surrounded by land uses that generate a mix of heavy vehicular and pedestrian traffic. It was also found that fatal crashes involving pedestrian happen close to different types of transit stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:350213/datastream/PDF/view |format=PDF |title=Severity of Road Crashes Involving Pedestrians in Metro Manila, Philippines |author1=Nina Verzosa |author2=Rebecca Miles |website=Diginole.lib.fsu.edu |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n\n== Effects ==\n\n=== Societal ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nThe congestion of vehicles on the road is not entirely unhealthy for the society. In a more specific viewpoint, the congestion between vehicles within a particular region, allows the circulation of other vehicles. Congestion occurs inevitably in highly urbanized sectors where the ratio between the population of people and the given area is not proportional and when the demand is high. In some cases, it is even desirable up to a certain point since getting rid of it imposes higher costs than allowing it to persist. The main social effects that occur due to the congestion of vehicles are namely: wasting of time (non-productivity; opportunity cost), delays, frustrated drivers/motorists/passengers, encouraging road rage.\n\n====Wasting of time====\nThe time spent in traffic can be considered as unproductive or generally, a waste of time. The concept of opportunity cost comes into play especially for people who have other places to be instead of being stuck in traffic.\n\n====Delays====\nThe traffic congestion in highly urbanized cities can be a huge detriment in terms of the delivery of goods from once place to another, leading to the loss of trust between parties who rely heavily on these daily deliveries for the benefit of their own businesses. Essentially, it may lead to situations such as: late arrival for work, important meetings, and school, which may result in lost business, disciplinary action or other personal losses. Delays may also come in the form of congestion may interfere with the flow of traffic when it comes to emergency cases (ambulance, police cars, etc.)\n\n====Frustrated Drivers====\nThe most commonly known effect of heavy traffic congestion would be in the form of \"Road Rage\". Road Rage is the aggressive behavior of an automobile driver which includes rude gestures, such as face clapping, verbal insults and deliberate reckless driving that may endanger the lives of both the drivers and the people surrounding them.\n\n=== Economic ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nTraffic congestion, in some cities, does more good than bad to a certain extent. And in other cities, it does more bad than good. Congestion on the road, from an Economic viewpoint suggests that higher levels of congestion are related to faster economic growth. However, above a certain limit, congestion starts to become a detriment to economic growth and the overall welfare of society, rather than an asset. This is due to the cost of the alleviation of congestion in some cities would be higher than the cost of congestion itself.\n\n'''Delays'''\nThe traffic congestion in highly urbanized cities can be a huge detriment in terms of the delivery of goods from once place to another, leading to the loss of trust between parties who rely heavily on these daily deliveries for the benefit of their own businesses. In any case, delivery of raw materials to be turned into finished products or inventory is a time-sensitive task, and traffic congestion does not contribute positively to this sector.\n\n'''Damaged Vehicles'''\nThe depreciation on vehicles as a result of staying still in traffic and the often use of acceleration and brakes, eventually resulting into more repairs or expenses in general.\n\n'''Loss of Revenue for Public Transport'''\nPublic transport, trucks and other services are also affected by the traffic in Metro Manila. Instead of being able to do three or four round trips, they usually end up doing less; which means a significant loss in revenues, and ultimately leading to a failing business. Public transportation also suffers in that the available schedules become less frequent and the time spent waiting is longer.\n\n=== Environmental effects ===\n[[File:Espa\u00f1a Boulevard2.jpg|thumb|Afternoon rush hour traffic congestion at [[Espa\u00f1a Boulevard]].]]\nAside from social and economic effects, traffic congestion also has massive effects on the environment, specifically its contribution to air pollution. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution is defined as the contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by chemical, physical, or biological means. Air pollution is an \u201cinvisible danger\u201d that people must not ignore. Despite the fact that it cannot be seen, air pollution has affected the lives of a number of Filipinos. The WHO said that air pollution is killing millions worldwide, including those in developing countries like the Philippines. Furthermore, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) noted that dirty air threatens the lives of 12 million residents.<ref name=\"manilatimes1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/the-lurking-menace-to-health-and-economy/92149/ |title=The lurking menace to health and economy |website=Manilatimes.net |date=2014-04-27 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n\nThe effects of pollutants found in vehicle exhaust include the following:<ref name=\"environmentalleader1\">{{cite web|last=Hermes |first=Jennifer |url=https://www.environmentalleader.com/2012/01/how-traffic-jams-affect-air-quality/ |title=How Traffic Jams Affect Air Quality |publisher=Environmental Leader |date=2012-01-05 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n* High levels of nitrogen oxide are toxic to humans\n* Sulfur dioxide is the primary cause of acid rain\n* Carbon dioxide contributes to climate change by insulating more heat from the sun\n* Ozone can impair lung function\n\nAccording to the National Emissions Inventory, last 2012, 71% of the air pollution in the Philippines comes from vehicles on the road. Furthermore, the situation is much worse in the National Capital Region (NCR), wherein 85% of the air pollution comes from vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/healthandwellness/536203/stress-pollution-fatigue-how-traffic-jams-affect-your-health/story/ |title=Stress, pollution, fatigue: How traffic jams affect your health &#124; Lifestyle &#124; GMA News Online |website=Gmanetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref> Also, based on data gathered from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Metro Manila\u2019s air quality situation has worsened in terms of total suspended particulates. There was a rise from 106&nbsp;\u00b5g/Ncm in July to December 2014 to 130&nbsp;\u00b5g/Ncm in January to April 2015, which are both above the maximum safe level of 90&nbsp;\u00b5g/Ncm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/715587/metros-air-quality-getting-worse-study |title=Metro's air quality getting worse\u2014study &#124; Inquirer News |website=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2015-08-23 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n\nThe more cars there are on the road, the more pollution is emitted into the air. This is because motor vehicles are one of the main sources of pollution in the world. On the other hand, there is an inverse relationship between the moving speed of traffic and air pollution. The slower the traffic moves, the more pollution is emitted into the air. This is due to the fact that cars burn the most fuel when accelerating to get up to speed. More gas is used up whenever there is an on and off pressing on the gas and break pedals during traffic jams.<ref name=\"environmentalleader1\"/>\n\nThus air pollution continues to be a serious threat in the Philippines. There have been efforts to lessen the number of vehicles on the road and the production of fuel-efficient green cars with reduced emissions, but air pollution remains to be a problem. The Guardian said that \u201cdespite all the promises of green growth and reduced emissions, traditional car sales are accelerating, while efforts to shift towards \u2018greener\u2019 hybrid and electric vehicles are stuck in neutral, particularly in the place where it matters most.\u201d <ref name=\"manilatimes1\"/>\n\n== Countermeasures ==\n=== Department of Transportation ===\n{{See also|Department of Transportation (Philippines)}}\nIn August of 2016, The Department of Transportation (DOTr), in charge of the country\u2019s transportation systems, has moved towards a more integrated approach to managing traffic on Metro Manila\u2019s roads. To do so, the department divided the metropolis into 10 traffic sectors so as to be able to share assets among other government agencies involved in traffic management such as the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), the highway Patrol Group of the Philippine National Police (HPG-PNP), the Land Transportation Office (LTO) and the Land Transportation Franchising Regulatory Board (LTFRB). According to the DOTr, by combining forces and coming up with a single chain of command, the agencies will be able to collaborate for better traffic monitoring,  uniform implementation of penalties and joint training for traffic personnel.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2016/08/17/dotr-acts-better-address-traffic-congestion-metro-manila-492031 |title=DOTr acts to better address traffic congestion in Metro Manila |website=SunStar.com.ph |date= |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n\n=== Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MMDA lining up.jpg|thumb|MMDA lining up {{deletable image-caption|18 July 2017|f11}}]] -->\n{{See also|Metropolitan Manila Development Authority}}\nThe Metropolitan Manila Development Authority\u2019s (MMDA) services include urban development planning, solid waste disposal, flood control and sewerage management, urban, renewal and zoning, health and sanitation, urban protection, pollution control, public safety during calamities and/or disasters and transport and traffic management; the latter acting as the MMDA\u2019s most visible function.  Although the presence of MMDA traffic enforcers on the cities\u2019 roads seem to be, for the most part, their greatest effort, there are a number of other traffic management initiatives they implement.\n\n====The Unified Vehicular Volume Reduction Program (UVVRP) ====\n{{see also|Unified Vehicular Volume Reduction Program}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MMDA Number Coding Scheme.jpg|thumb|MMDA's proposed number coding scheme during 2013 {{deletable image-caption|18 July 2017|f11}}]] -->\nThe Unified Vehicular Volume Reduction Program (UVVRP) is what is more commonly referred to as the \u201ccolor coding\u201d or \u201cnumber coding\u201d system implemented by the MMDA. It is a travel demand management program meant to ration road space based on the license plates of vehicles; by regulating the number of vehicles using the roads, the program thereby reduces volume and eases traffic congestion.\n\nThe scheme was intended to be a temporary solution in light of the traffic congestion caused by infrastructure projects in the 1990s. Despite that the UVVRP was not created to be a long-term policy, at present it is still being used and remains to be one of the MMDA\u2019s most well-known traffic initiatives.<ref>Regidor, Jose Regin F. \"Traffic Congestion in Metro Manila: Is the UVVRP Still Effective?.\" Philippine Engineering Journal 34, no. 1 (2013).</ref>\n\nThe first version of the UVVRP was implemented in 1995. During the 1990s, there were many road and railway infrastructure projects being built throughout Metro Manila; in order to address the resulting increase in congestion, the MMDA issued Regulation No. 95-001 or the \u201cOdd-Even Scheme.\u201d The scheme banned private vehicles with less than three passengers from passing restricted roads during AM and PM peak periods on particular days. Vehicles in use for public transportation, emergencies, police and military, school buses, diplomatic matters and official media were exempted from this regulation.\n\nOn Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, vehicles with license plates that ended in odd numbers were restricted from use; while those that ended in even numbers were restricted from use on Mondays, Wednesday and Fridays. The peak periods during which the vehicles were banned were defined to be from 7:00-9:00 am and 5:00-7:00pm. Per violation, there was a P300 penalty charged to offenders.\n\nRegulation 96-or the  \u201cModified Odd-Even Scheme\u201d was then issued in 1996. This scheme applied to public utility vehicles such as taxis, buses, public utility jeepneys, etc., which are banned from all streets of Metro Manila on particular days of the week from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM based on the plate number ending of each vehicle, as follows: 1 and 2 on Mondays, 3 and 4 on Tuesdays, 5 and 6 on 7 Wednesdays, 7 and 8 on Thursdays, 9 and 0 on Fridays. This regulation took effect February 19, 1996 and covered all roads in Metropolitan Manila.\n\n1996 was also the year the MMDA, adopted Regulation 96-005 entitled the \u201cUnified Vehicular Volume Reduction Program\u201d as a replacement of Regulations Nos. 95-001 and 96-004. This program aimed to regulate the operation of certain motor vehicles on all national, city and municipal roads in Metropolitan Manila. Under this scheme, private vehicles are banned for longer hours (i.e., between 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM).\n\nIn 2003, the UVVRP was modified to allow for a window time between 10:00 AM to 3:00PM which was considered to be the off-peak period within the day when restricted vehicles could travel along the specified roads. This scheme, however, was not uniformly adopted in all cities and municipalities throughout metropolis due to differing traffic conditions.\n\nIn 2010, the UVVRP included both public transportation and private vehicles under the scheme.<ref>Regidor, Jose Regin F., and Noriel Christopher C. Tiglao. \"Alternative Solutions to Traffic Problems: Metro Manila in Retrospect.\" In 11th World Conference on Transport Research. 2007.</ref>\n\nToday, the provision of the UVVRP are as follows: vehicles cannot drive around Metro Manila based on the last digit of the license plate. 1 and 2 are banned on Mondays, 3 and 4 on Tuesdays, 5 and 6 on Wednesdays 7 and 8 on Thursdays and 9 and 0 on Fridays. The period of the UVVRP is from 7am to 8pm without window hours and it applies to national, circumferential and radial roads in the metropolis.\n\nThe plate numbers restrained from driving within Metro Manila are summarized into this table:<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.mmda.gov.ph/20-faq/1748-all-about-number-coding-uvvrp |title=All about number coding (UVVRP) |website=Mmda.gov.ph |date=2010-11-15 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Under this scheme, trucks are prohibited from traveling along major road networks for most of the day, depending on the type and weight of truck. It has been in place since 1978 and restrains large trucks to designated routes in order to give way to other road users.  Infractions of the ban carry a fine of P2000.<ref>Regidor, J.R.F. and Tiglao, N.C.C., 2007. Alternative Solutions to Traffic Problems: Metro Manila in Retrospect.

This act prohibited cargo trucks with a gross vehicular weight of over 4000 kilograms from driving along eleven major roads in Metro Manila during peak traffic hours (6:00 am\u2013 9:00am, and 4:00pm\u20138:00pm) daily except on weekends.\n\nThe Department of Transportation and Communication issued Memorandum Circulars No. 90-367 in 1990 which repealed the previous truck ban schedule and changed it to the following:\n* 7:00am \u2013 10:00 am on weekdays \n* 4:00pm \u2013 8:00pm Monday-Thursday \n* 4:00pm \u2013 9:00 pm on Fridays\n\nIn 1991, in response to the appeal for an alternate route and reduction of the truck ban, the MMDA issues Ordinance No. 19, amending the original Ordinance No. 78-04. This provided alternate routes to those included in the truck ban and allowed a 2-hour reduction of the truck ban period resulting in these effects:  \n* 7:00am \u2013 9:00 am on weekdays\n* 5:00pm \u2013 8:00pm Monday-Thursday\n* 4:00pm \u2013 9:00 pm on Fridays\n\nThis was further amended when Ordinance No. 5 Series of 1994 was issued. As a result, trucks were banned from the major arterial road Epifanio Delos Santos Avenue. This was an \u201call-day\u201d ban that lasted from 6:00am \u2013 9:00pm and was implemented Monday through Friday. It also restricted trucks from passing along 10 major routes between these particular hours:\n\u2022\t6:00am \u2013 9:00am (daily with the exception of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays)\n\u2022\t5:00pm \u2013 9:00pm (daily with the exception of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays)\n\nSince then, the MMDA has issued Regulation No. 96-008 in 1996 thus extending truck ban to Saturdays; leaving only Sundays and holidays as the exception. This was done in desire to further reduce traffic congestion experienced throughout the week. The gross capacity weight of trucks was also changed from 4,000 kilograms to 4,500 kilograms by the issuance of Regulation No. 99-002.\n\n====U-Turn Scheme====\n[[File:Taguig-c5-kalayaan-2012-01.JPG|thumb|An elevated U-turn slot at [[Circumferential Road 5|Carlos P. Garcia Avenue or C-5 Road]] in Taguig]]\n[[File:MMDA 1.jpg|thumb|A U-turn slot along [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]].]]\nThe U-turn Scheme was implemented by the MMDA in 2002 primarily to account for roundabout operations on the road. This entailed the creation of median opens along busy arterial roads and was composed of two originally separate schemes: the \u201cBig Rotunda Scheme\u201d and the \u201cClearway Scheme\u201d.\n\n;Big Rotunda Scheme\n* Construction of median opening pairs\n* Closing intersection by use of temporary barriers\n\n;Clearway Scheme\n* Promote uninterrupted flow along arterial roads\n* Meant to speed up congestion along clogged roads\n\nEssentially, the scheme resulted in the closing of many road intersections as well as the suspension of traffic signal operations in order to allow for the system of median openings. The set up of the U-turn scheme caused lanes of vehicles approaching an intersection to converge and thus be diverted into a single stream towards the U-turn.\n\nThe U-turn scheme was first applied along [[Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City|Commonwealth Avenue]] in Quezon City and [[Marikina\u2013Infanta Highway]] in Pasig and Marikina. Later on, the scheme was also implemented in other areas on Metro Manila including various intersections along EDSA.<ref>Regidor, J.R.F., 2004. Analyzing Impacts of Transportation Infrastructure and Policies on Traffic Flow in Metro Manila Using Advanced Tools and Techniques. Philippine Engineering Journal, 25(1).</ref>\n\n====Social Media Platforms====\nSince 2010, the MMDA has tapped into the use of social media such as Twitter, in an effort to alleviate the traffic situation. Through such platforms, the MMDA is able to broadcast live updates to their followers, send out and respond to tweets 24 hours a day. The Twitter feed is mostly used to relay information regarding traffic, accidents and number coding (UVVRP) updates.\n\n====Mobile Application: MMDA Traffic Navigator====\nThe MMDA Traffic Navigator was a mobile application launched in 2011 for android and iOS meant to give users quick access to traffic situations surrounding the Metro Manila\u2019s major routes. It delivers real-time traffic updates in specific roads and highways by relying on CCTVs to assess the congestion in particular areas. In areas where there are no available CCTVs, reports are instead collected from traffic enforces. The application may be accessed via system view or line view; and provides indicators as to whether the current traffic is considered light, moderate or heavy.<ref>Consulta, A.D.M., Nariz, E.J.N. and Rosario, S.B., 2015.
