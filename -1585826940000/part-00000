All of their programs are run through two impact partners, Mayan Families & Whole Planet Foundation, who are registered 501C3 non profit organizations. You read more about their impact work on their website LivingonOne.org.\n\nThey have also continued to visit and film with the community, resulting in a new film in 2015, called '[http://www.Livingonone.org/Rosa 'Rosa - These Storms'']. The film follows their friend and star of Living on One Dollar, Rosa Coj Bocel, over a five-year period to provide a personal look into the life and hope of a young Mayan woman. Among others, it premiered at Seattle International Film Festival, LA Shorts, Washington West, Cleveland, and Sonoma International. It was also featuring by The Atlantic Magazine, Short of the Week, and Vimeo Staff Picks. Rosa was able to fly from Guatemala to Washington D.C. to accept an award on the film's behalf and to speak with NPR and others.

In 1899 the German palaeobotanist [[Henry Potoni\u00e9]] coined the term \"''Cycadofilices''\" (\"cycad-ferns\") for such fossils, suggesting that they were a group of non-seed plants intermediate between the [[fern]]s and cycads.<ref name=\"Potonie1899\">Potoni\u00e9, H.

Today, despite being regarded by most palaeobotanists as only distantly related to ferns, these spurious names have nonetheless established themselves. Nowadays, four orders of Palaeozoic seed plants tend to be referred to as pteridosperms: [[Lyginopteridales]], [[Medullosales]], [[Callistophytales]] and [[Peltaspermales]].\n\nTheir discovery attracted considerable attention at the time, as the pteridosperms were the first extinct group of vascular plants to be identified solely from the fossil record.  In the 19th century the Carboniferous Period was often referred to as the \"Age of Ferns\" but these discoveries during the first decade of the 20th century made it clear that the \"Age of Pteridosperms\" was perhaps a better description.\n\nDuring the 20th century the concept of pteridosperms was expanded to include various Mesozoic groups of seed plants with fern-like fronds, such as the [[Corystospermaceae]].  Some palaeobotanists also included seed plant groups with entire leaves such as the [[Glossopteridales]] and [[Gigantopteridales]], which was stretching the concept.  In the context of modern phylogenetic models,<ref name=\"HiltonBateman2006\">{{citation |author1=Hilton, J.  |author2=Bateman, R. M.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2006 |title=Pteridosperms are the backbone of seed-plant phylogeny |journal=Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society |volume=33 |pages=119\u2013168 |doi=10.3159/1095-5674(2006)133[119:PATBOS]2.0.CO;2}}</ref> the groups often referred to as pteridosperms appear to be liberally spread across a range of clades, and many palaeobotanists today would regard pteridosperms as little more than a [[paraphyletic]] 'grade-group' with no common lineage. One of the few characters that may unify the group is that the [[ovule]]s were borne in a [[:wiktionary:cupule|cupule]], a group of enclosing branches, but this has not been confirmed for all \"pteridosperm\" groups.\n\nWith regard to the enduring value of the division, many palaeobotanists still use the pteridosperm grouping in an informal sense to refer to the seed plants that are not [[angiosperm]]s, coniferoids ([[conifer]]s or [[cordaite]]s), [[Ginkgoaceae|ginkgophytes]] or [[cycad]]ophytes (cycads or [[Bennettitales|bennettite]]s). This is particularly useful for extinct seed plant groups whose systematic relationships remain speculative, as they can be classified as pteridosperms with no valid implications being made as to their systematic affinities.

In 1899 the German palaeobotanist [[Henry Potoni\u00e9]] coined the term \"''Cycadofilices''\" (\"cycad-ferns\") for such fossils, suggesting that they were a group of non-seed plants intermediate between the [[fern]]s and cycads.<ref name=\"Potonie1899\">Potoni\u00e9, H. (1899). ''Lehrbuch der Pflanzenpal\u00e4ontologie.'' Berlin.</ref>  Shortly afterwards, the British palaeobotanists [[Francis Wall Oliver|Frank Oliver]] and [[Dukinfield Henry Scott]] (with the assistance of Oliver's student at the time, [[Marie Stopes]]) made the critical discovery that some of these fronds (genus ''Lyginopteris'') were associated with seeds (genus ''Lagenostoma'') that had identical and very distinctive glandular hairs, and concluded that both fronds and seeds belonged to the same plant.<ref name=\"OliverScott1904\">{{cite journal |author1=Oliver F.

Today, despite being regarded by most palaeobotanists as only distantly related to ferns, these spurious names have nonetheless established themselves. Nowadays, four orders of Palaeozoic seed plants tend to be referred to as pteridosperms: [[Lyginopteridales]], [[Medullosales]], [[Callistophytales]] and [[Peltaspermales]].\n\nTheir discovery attracted considerable attention at the time, as the pteridosperms were the first extinct group of vascular plants to be identified solely from the fossil record.  In the 19th century the Carboniferous Period was often referred to as the \"Age of Ferns\" but these discoveries during the first decade of the 20th century made it clear that the \"Age of Pteridosperms\" was perhaps a better description.\n\nDuring the 20th century the concept of pteridosperms was expanded to include various Mesozoic groups of seed plants with fern-like fronds, such as the [[Corystospermaceae]].  Some palaeobotanists also included seed plant groups with entire leaves such as the [[Glossopteridales]] and [[Gigantopteridales]], which was stretching the concept.  In the context of modern phylogenetic models,<ref name=\"HiltonBateman2006\">{{citation |author1=Hilton, J.  |author2=Bateman, R. M.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2006 |title=Pteridosperms are the backbone of seed-plant phylogeny |journal=Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society |volume=33 |pages=119\u2013168 |doi=10.3159/1095-5674(2006)133[119:PATBOS]2.0.CO;2}}</ref> the groups often referred to as pteridosperms appear to be liberally spread across a range of clades, and many palaeobotanists today would regard pteridosperms as little more than a [[paraphyletic]] 'grade-group' with no common lineage. One of the few characters that may unify the group is that the [[ovule]]s were borne in a [[:wiktionary:cupule|cupule]], a group of enclosing branches, but this has not been confirmed for all \"pteridosperm\" groups.\n\nWith regard to the enduring value of the division, many palaeobotanists still use the pteridosperm grouping in an informal sense to refer to the seed plants that are not [[angiosperm]]s, coniferoids ([[conifer]]s or [[cordaite]]s), [[Ginkgoaceae|ginkgophytes]] or [[cycad]]ophytes (cycads or [[Bennettitales|bennettite]]s). This is particularly useful for extinct seed plant groups whose systematic relationships remain speculative, as they can be classified as pteridosperms with no valid implications being made as to their systematic affinities. Also, from a purely curatorial perspective the term pteridosperms is a useful shorthand for describing the fern-like fronds that were probably produced by seed plants, which are commonly found in many Palaeozoic and Mesozoic fossil floras.\n\n==Phylogeny==\nAn alternative phylogeny of spermatophytes based on the work by Nov\u00edkov & Baraba\u0161-Krasni 2015<ref>{{cite book | author=Nov\u00edkov & Baraba\u0161-Krasni | year=2015 | title=Modern plant systematics | volume=| pages=685 | publisher=Liga-Pres| isbn=978-966-397-276-3 |doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.4745.6164}}</ref> with plant taxon authors from Anderson, Anderson & Cleal 2007<ref>{{cite book | author=Anderson, Anderson & Cleal | year=2007 | title=Brief history of the gymnosperms: classification, biodiversity, phytogeography and ecology | journal=Strelitzia | volume=20 | issue= | pages=280 | publisher=SANBI| isbn=978-1-919976-39-6 |doi=}}</ref> showing the relationship of extinct clades.\n\n{{barlabel |size=8 |at=3 |label=Seed ferns|cladogram=\n{{Cladex| style=font-size:100%;line-height:80%\n|label1=[[Spermatophyta|Spermatophytina]]\n                            |1={{Cladex\n                              |1=\u2020[[Moresnetiopsida]] <small>Doweld 2001</small> |barbegin1=darkgreen\n                              |2={{Cladex\n                                |1=\u2020[[Lyginopteridopsida]] <small>Nov\u00e1k 1961 emend.

It also is the headquarters of the [[East Sikkim]] district. Gangtok is in the eastern [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] range, at an elevation of {{convert|1650|m|abbr=on}}. The town's population of 100,000 are from different ethnicities such as [[Bhutia]], [[Lepcha people|Lepchas]] and [[Indian Gorkha]]s. Within the higher peaks of the Himalaya and with a year-round mild [[temperate]] climate, Gangtok is at the centre of Sikkim's tourism industry. Gangtok is a city of great food, atmosphere sceneries and beautiful buddhist monastery which in includes rumtek and enchey monastery.\n\nrumtek and enchey are the most famous and know monastery.\n\nGangtok rose to prominence as a popular [[Buddhist pilgrimage]] site after the construction of the [[Enchey Monastery]] in 1840. In 1894, the ruling Sikkimese [[Chogyal]], [[Thutob Namgyal]], transferred the capital to Gangtok. In the early 20th century, Gangtok became a major stopover on the [[trade route]] between [[Lhasa]] in [[Tibet]] and cities such as [[Kolkata]] (then Calcutta) in [[British India]]. After India won its independence from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1947, Sikkim chose to remain an independent monarchy, with Gangtok as its capital. In 1975, after the integration with the union of India, Gangtok was made India's 22nd state capital. The current Chief minister is Prem Singh Golay. \n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe precise meaning of the name \"Gangtok\" is unclear, though the most popular meaning is \"hill cut\".<ref name=\"telegang\" />\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of Sikkim}}\nLike the rest of Sikkim, not much is known about the early history of Gangtok.<ref name=\"TT20031006\" /> The earliest records date from the construction of the [[hermit]]ic Gangtok monastery in 1716.<ref name=\"bernier1\" /> Gangtok remained a small hamlet until the construction of the [[Enchey Monastery]] in 1840 made it a pilgrimage center. It became the capital of what was left of Sikkim after an English conquest in the mid-19th century in response to a hostage crisis. After the [[History of Tibet|defeat of the Tibetans]] by the British, Gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between Tibet and British India at the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"nslepcha\" /> Most of the roads and the [[telegraph]] in the area were built during this time. \n\nIn 1894, [[Thutob Namgyal]], the Sikkimese monarch under British rule, shifted the capital from [[Tumlong]] to Gangtok, increasing the city's importance. A new grand palace along with other state buildings was built in the new capital. Following [[Indian independence movement|India's independence]] in 1947, Sikkim became a [[nation-state]] with Gangtok as its capital. Sikkim came under the [[suzerainty]] of India, with the condition that it would retain its independence, by the treaty signed between the [[Chogyal]] and the then [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref name=\"HISTORY OF SIKKIM\" /> This pact gave the Indians control of external affairs on behalf of Sikkimese. Trade between India and Tibet continued to flourish through the [[Nathula]] and [[Jelepla Pass|Jelepla passes]], offshoots of the ancient [[Silk Road]] near Gangtok. These border passes were sealed after the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, which deprived Gangtok of its trading business.<ref name=\"nathuladown\" /> The Nathula pass was finally opened for liited trade in 2006, fuelling hopes of economic boom.<ref name=\"bbc-1\" /><ref>Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2011).

the capital and the largest town and an beautiful state of the [[India]]n state of [[Sikkim]]. It also is the headquarters of the [[East Sikkim]] district. Gangtok is in the eastern [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] range, at an elevation of {{convert|1650|m|abbr=on}}. The town's population of 100,000 are from different ethnicities such as [[Bhutia]], [[Lepcha people|Lepchas]] and [[Indian Gorkha]]s. Within the higher peaks of the Himalaya and with a year-round mild [[temperate]] climate, Gangtok is at the centre of Sikkim's tourism industry. Gangtok is a city of great food, atmosphere sceneries and beautiful buddhist monastery which in includes rumtek and enchey monastery.\n\nrumtek and enchey are the most famous and know monastery.\n\nGangtok rose to prominence as a popular [[Buddhist pilgrimage]] site after the construction of the [[Enchey Monastery]] in 1840. In 1894, the ruling Sikkimese [[Chogyal]], [[Thutob Namgyal]], transferred the capital to Gangtok. In the early 20th century, Gangtok became a major stopover on the [[trade route]] between [[Lhasa]] in [[Tibet]] and cities such as [[Kolkata]] (then Calcutta) in [[British India]]. After India won its independence from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1947, Sikkim chose to remain an independent monarchy, with Gangtok as its capital. In 1975, after the integration with the union of India, Gangtok was made India's 22nd state capital. The current Chief minister is Prem Singh Golay. \n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe precise meaning of the name \"Gangtok\" is unclear, though the most popular meaning is \"hill cut\".<ref name=\"telegang\" />\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of Sikkim}}\nLike the rest of Sikkim, not much is known about the early history of Gangtok.<ref name=\"TT20031006\" /> The earliest records date from the construction of the [[hermit]]ic Gangtok monastery in 1716.<ref name=\"bernier1\" /> Gangtok remained a small hamlet until the construction of the [[Enchey Monastery]] in 1840 made it a pilgrimage center. It became the capital of what was left of Sikkim after an English conquest in the mid-19th century in response to a hostage crisis. After the [[History of Tibet|defeat of the Tibetans]] by the British, Gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between Tibet and British India at the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"nslepcha\" /> Most of the roads and the [[telegraph]] in the area were built during this time. \n\nIn 1894, [[Thutob Namgyal]], the Sikkimese monarch under British rule, shifted the capital from [[Tumlong]] to Gangtok, increasing the city's importance. A new grand palace along with other state buildings was built in the new capital. Following [[Indian independence movement|India's independence]] in 1947, Sikkim became a [[nation-state]] with Gangtok as its capital. Sikkim came under the [[suzerainty]] of India, with the condition that it would retain its independence, by the treaty signed between the [[Chogyal]] and the then [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref name=\"HISTORY OF SIKKIM\" /> This pact gave the Indians control of external affairs on behalf of Sikkimese. Trade between India and Tibet continued to flourish through the [[Nathula]] and [[Jelepla Pass|Jelepla passes]], offshoots of the ancient [[Silk Road]] near Gangtok. These border passes were sealed after the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, which deprived Gangtok of its trading business.<ref name=\"nathuladown\" /> The Nathula pass was finally opened for liited trade in 2006, fuelling hopes of economic boom.<ref name=\"bbc-1\" /><ref>Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2011). ''China's Ancient Tea Horse Road''. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN: B005DQV7Q2</ref>\n\nIn 1975, after years of political uncertainty and struggle, including riots, the monarchy was abrogated and Sikkim became India's twenty-second state, with Gangtok as its capital after a referendum.<!---Nest&Wings pg-21-24|NaW---> Gangtok has witnessed annual landslides, resulting in loss of life and damage to property. The largest disaster occurred in June 1997, when 38 were killed and hundreds of buildings were destroyed.<ref name=\"chap4\" /> gangtok's chief minister was Pawan Kumar chamling for past 25 years. \n\n== Geography ==\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=350|caption_align=center\n| align    = left\n| title = [[Kangchenjunga]]\n| image1 = Kangch-Goechala.jpg\n| image2 = Kangchenjunga East Face from Zemu Glacier.jpg\n| footer   = <center>[[Kangchenjunga]], visible from Gangtok, the third [[List of highest mountains|highest mountain in the world]], near the [[Zemu Glacier]].</center> \n}}\nGangtok is located at {{Coord|27.3325|N|88.6140|E|}} (coordinates of Gangtok head post office).<ref name=\"FallinGrain\" /> It is situated in the lower [[Himalaya]]s at an elevation of {{convert|1650|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"metgang\" /> The town lies on one side of a hill, with \"The Ridge\",<ref name=\"nslepcha\" /><ref name=\"discoveringbook\" /> a promenade housing the [[Raj Bhavan (Sikkim)|Raj Bhawan]], the [[governor]]'s residence, at one end and the palace, situated at an altitude of about {{convert|1800|m|abbr=on}}, at the other. The city is flanked on east and west by two streams, namely [[Roro Chu]] and [[Ranikhola]], respectively.<ref name=\"chap4\" /> These two rivers divide the natural drainage into two parts, the eastern and western parts. Both the streams meet the Ranipul and flow south as the main Ranikhola before it joins the [[Teesta River|Teesta]] at [[Singtam]].<ref name=\"chap4\" /> Most of the roads are steep, with the buildings built on compacted ground alongside them.<ref name=\"mapsindiagang\" /> Kanchenjunga, only add to the gongokian environs. \n\n[[File:Ban Jhakri Falls - Gangtok.jpg|thumb|right|Banjhakri Falls - Gangtok]]\nMost of [[Sikkim]], including Gangtok, is underlain by [[Precambrian]] rocks which contains [[Foliation (geology)|foliated]] [[phyllite]]s and [[schists]]; slopes are therefore prone to frequent landslides.<ref name=\"chap2\" /> Surface runoff of water by natural streams (''jhora'') and man-made drains has contributed to the risk of landslides.<ref name=\"chap4\" /> According to the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]], the town falls under [[Earthquake hazard zoning of India|seismic zone-IV]] (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing seismic activity), near the [[convergent boundary]] of the [[India Plate|Indian]] and the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] [[tectonic plate]]s and is subject to frequent earthquakes. The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow-clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town from the distance. Mount [[Kanchenjunga]] (8,598&nbsp;m or 28,208&nbsp;ft)\u2014the world's third-highest peak\u2014is visible to the west of the city. The existence of steep slopes, vulnerability to landslides, large forest cover and inadequate access to most areas have been a major impediment to the natural and balanced growth of the city.<ref name=\"chap4\" />\n\nThere are densely forested regions around Gangtok, consisting of temperate, [[deciduous]] forests of [[Populus|poplar]], [[birch]], [[oak]], and [[elm]], as well as [[evergreen]], [[coniferous]] trees of the [[alpine climate|wet alpine]] zone.<ref name=\"chap2\" /> [[Orchids]] are common, and rare varieties of orchids are featured in flower shows in the city. [[Bamboo]]s are also abundant. In the lower reaches of the town, the vegetation gradually changes from alpine to temperate deciduous and [[subtropical]].<ref name=\"chap2\" /> Flowers such as [[sunflower]], [[Tagetes|marigold]], [[poinsettia]], and others bloom, especially in November and December.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Gangtok weatherbox}}\n\nGangtok features a monsoon-influenced [[subtropical highland climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cwb''). Because of its elevation and sheltered environment, Gangtok enjoys a mild, [[temperate]] climate all year round. Like most Himalayan towns, Gangtok has five seasons: summer, [[monsoon]]s, autumn, winter, and spring. Temperatures range from an average maximum of {{convert|22|C|F|lk=on|abbr=on|0}} in summer to an average minimum of {{convert|4|C|F|abbr=on|0}} in winter.<ref name=\"weatherchart\" /> Summers (lasting from late April to June) are mild, with maximum temperatures rarely crossing {{convert|25|C|F|abbr=on|lk=on|0}}. The monsoon season from June to September is characterised by intense torrential rains often causing landslides that block Gangtok's land access to the rest of the country.

Several Arab tribes attempted to fight him on the way, but were defeated.\n\nWhen news of the advance of Abraha's army came, the Arab tribes of the Quraysh, Banu Kinanah, [[Banu Khuza'a]] and Banu Hudhayl united in defense of the Ka\u2018bah. A man from the [[Himyarite Kingdom]] was sent by Abraha to advise them that Abraha only wished to demolish the Kaaba and if they resisted, they would be crushed. [[Abd_al-Muttalib|\u2018Abdul Muttalib]] told the Meccans to seek refuge in the hills while he with some leading members of the Quraysh remained within the precincts of the Ka\u2018bah. Abraha sent a dispatch inviting Abdul-Muttalib to meet with Abraha and discuss matters. When Abdul-Muttalib left the meeting he was heard saying, \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonor the servants of His House.\"\n\nThe reference to the story in [[Qur\u2019an]] is rather short. According to [[Sura]]h [[al-Fil]], the next day [as Abraha prepared to enter the city], a dark cloud of [[Restless flycatcher|small birds]] named '[[Ababil (mythology)|Ababil]]' ({{lang-ar|\u0623\u064e\u0628\u0640\u0627\u0628\u0640\u064a\u0640\u0644}}) appeared. The birds carried [[Lava|small rocks]] in their beaks, and bombarded the Ethiopian forces and smashed them like \"eaten straw\". However according to [[Muhammad Asad]] this surah does not describe birds literally carrying small rocks, he instead, referencing [[Al-Zamakhshari]] and [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] translates the above mentioned verses as:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|(2)Thus, He let loose upon them great swarms of flying creatures (3) which smote them with stone-hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Message 8f The Quran, by Mohammad Asad, Surah 105:2-3|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n|}\nMohammad Asad the words used in this verse, namely the \"stones of sijjil\", denote  \"a writing and, tropically, something that has been decreed [by God]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibid M. Asad, Commentary on Surah 102, see note 2|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=Lit., \"with stones of sijjil\". As explained in note [114] on\u00a011:82, this latter term is synonymous with sijill, which signifies \"a writing\" and, tropically, \"something that has been decreed [by God]\": hence, the phrase hijarah min sijjil is a metaphor for \"stone-hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained\", i.e., in God's decree (Zamakhshari and Razi, with analogous comments on the same expression in\u00a011:82).}}</ref> He further explains that this decree by god was a very sudden epidemic outbreak, which, according to Ibn Ishaq, caused fever (in arabic hasbah) and smallpox (arab. judari). This, as Asad concludes, points to the fact that the \"stone hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained\" were a very sudden virulent epidemic due to the fact that the word for fever \"hasbah\" primarily means \"pelting [or smiting] with stones\" in the famous arabic dictionary ''al-Qamous'' (\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0645\u0648\u0633) by [[Fairuzabadi]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibid|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=As already mentioned in the introductory note, the particular chastisement to which the above verse alludes seems to have been a sudden epidemic of extreme virulence: according to Waqidi and Muhammad ibn Ishaq - the latter as quoted by Ibn Hisham and Ibn Kathir - \"this was the first time that spotted fever (hasbah) and smallpox (judari) appeared in the land of the Arabs\". It is interesting to note that the word hasbah - which, according to some authorities, signifies also typhus - primarily means \"pelting [or smiting\"] with stones\" (Qamus)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Al-Qamus Al-Muhit by Mu\u1e25ammad Ibn-Ja\u02bbq\u016bb al- F\u012br\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d\u012b|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The word ta'ir can denote any \"flying creature, whether bird or insect (Taj al-'Arus)\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibid|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=As regards the noun ta'ir (of which tayr is the plural), we ought to remember that it denotes any \"flying creature\", whether bird or insect (Taj al-'Arus). Neither the Qur'an nor any authentic Tradition offers us any evidence as to the nature of the \"flying creatures\" mentioned in the above verse; and since, on the other hand, all the \"descriptions\" indulged in by the commentators are purely imaginary, they need not be seriously considered. If the hypothesis of an epidemic is correct, the \"flying creatures\" - whether birds or insects - may well have been the carriers of the infection. One thing, however, is clear: whatever the nature of the doom that overtook the invading force, it was certainly miraculous in the true sense of this word - namely, in the sudden, totally unexpected rescue which it brought to the distressed people of Mecca.}}</ref>\n\n==Shia==\nAccording to [[Hadith]], in al-Kafi Volume one, Imam [[Ali]] was born in the 30th year of the Elephant<ref>{{cite web |title=The birth of El Imam Ali related to the year of the elephant |url=http://balaghah.net/old/nahj-htm/eng/id/article/46.htm |website=balaghah.net |accessdate=24 July 2018}}</ref> and died in AH&nbsp;40.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Al-Islam|first1=Thiqatu|title=Al-Kafi|date=2015|publisher=Islamic Seminary Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-9914308-6-4|page=457|edition=Second|url=http://www.theislamicseminary.org/wp/|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027221543/http://www.theislamicseminary.org/wp/|archivedate=2017-10-27}}</ref>\n\n== Other sources ==\nThis event is referred to in the Qur\u2019an, in [[Sura]]h 105, ''[[Al-Fil]]'' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0640\u0641\u0650\u0640\u064a\u0640\u0644}}, \"The Elephant\"), and is discussed in its related [[tafsir]].\n\nSome scholars have placed the Year of the Elephant one or two decades earlier than 570 CE,<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordencycloped03espo_0/page/154 154]|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World: Libe-Sare|last1=Esposito|first1=John L.|authorlink=John L.

Several Arab tribes attempted to fight him on the way, but were defeated.\n\nWhen news of the advance of Abraha's army came, the Arab tribes of the Quraysh, Banu Kinanah, [[Banu Khuza'a]] and Banu Hudhayl united in defense of the Ka\u2018bah. A man from the [[Himyarite Kingdom]] was sent by Abraha to advise them that Abraha only wished to demolish the Kaaba and if they resisted, they would be crushed. [[Abd_al-Muttalib|\u2018Abdul Muttalib]] told the Meccans to seek refuge in the hills while he with some leading members of the Quraysh remained within the precincts of the Ka\u2018bah. Abraha sent a dispatch inviting Abdul-Muttalib to meet with Abraha and discuss matters. When Abdul-Muttalib left the meeting he was heard saying, \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonor the servants of His House.\"\n\nThe reference to the story in [[Qur\u2019an]] is rather short. According to [[Sura]]h [[al-Fil]], the next day [as Abraha prepared to enter the city], a dark cloud of [[Restless flycatcher|small birds]] named '[[Ababil (mythology)|Ababil]]' ({{lang-ar|\u0623\u064e\u0628\u0640\u0627\u0628\u0640\u064a\u0640\u0644}}) appeared. The birds carried [[Lava|small rocks]] in their beaks, and bombarded the Ethiopian forces and smashed them like \"eaten straw\". However according to [[Muhammad Asad]] this surah does not describe birds literally carrying small rocks, he instead, referencing [[Al-Zamakhshari]] and [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] translates the above mentioned verses as:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|(2)Thus, He let loose upon them great swarms of flying creatures (3) which smote them with stone-hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Message 8f The Quran, by Mohammad Asad, Surah 105:2-3|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n|}\nMohammad Asad the words used in this verse, namely the \"stones of sijjil\", denote  \"a writing and, tropically, something that has been decreed [by God]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibid M. Asad, Commentary on Surah 102, see note 2|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=Lit., \"with stones of sijjil\". As explained in note [114] on\u00a011:82, this latter term is synonymous with sijill, which signifies \"a writing\" and, tropically, \"something that has been decreed [by God]\": hence, the phrase hijarah min sijjil is a metaphor for \"stone-hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained\", i.e., in God's decree (Zamakhshari and Razi, with analogous comments on the same expression in\u00a011:82).}}</ref> He further explains that this decree by god was a very sudden epidemic outbreak, which, according to Ibn Ishaq, caused fever (in arabic hasbah) and smallpox (arab. judari). This, as Asad concludes, points to the fact that the \"stone hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained\" were a very sudden virulent epidemic due to the fact that the word for fever \"hasbah\" primarily means \"pelting [or smiting] with stones\" in the famous arabic dictionary ''al-Qamous'' (\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0645\u0648\u0633) by [[Fairuzabadi]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibid|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=As already mentioned in the introductory note, the particular chastisement to which the above verse alludes seems to have been a sudden epidemic of extreme virulence: according to Waqidi and Muhammad ibn Ishaq - the latter as quoted by Ibn Hisham and Ibn Kathir - \"this was the first time that spotted fever (hasbah) and smallpox (judari) appeared in the land of the Arabs\". It is interesting to note that the word hasbah - which, according to some authorities, signifies also typhus - primarily means \"pelting [or smiting\"] with stones\" (Qamus)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Al-Qamus Al-Muhit by Mu\u1e25ammad Ibn-Ja\u02bbq\u016bb al- F\u012br\u016bz\u0101b\u0101d\u012b|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The word ta'ir can denote any \"flying creature, whether bird or insect (Taj al-'Arus)\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibid|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=As regards the noun ta'ir (of which tayr is the plural), we ought to remember that it denotes any \"flying creature\", whether bird or insect (Taj al-'Arus). Neither the Qur'an nor any authentic Tradition offers us any evidence as to the nature of the \"flying creatures\" mentioned in the above verse; and since, on the other hand, all the \"descriptions\" indulged in by the commentators are purely imaginary, they need not be seriously considered. If the hypothesis of an epidemic is correct, the \"flying creatures\" - whether birds or insects - may well have been the carriers of the infection. One thing, however, is clear: whatever the nature of the doom that overtook the invading force, it was certainly miraculous in the true sense of this word - namely, in the sudden, totally unexpected rescue which it brought to the distressed people of Mecca.}}</ref>\n\n==Shia==\nAccording to [[Hadith]], in al-Kafi Volume one, Imam [[Ali]] was born in the 30th year of the Elephant<ref>{{cite web |title=The birth of El Imam Ali related to the year of the elephant |url=http://balaghah.net/old/nahj-htm/eng/id/article/46.htm |website=balaghah.net |accessdate=24 July 2018}}</ref> and died in AH&nbsp;40.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Al-Islam|first1=Thiqatu|title=Al-Kafi|date=2015|publisher=Islamic Seminary Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-9914308-6-4|page=457|edition=Second|url=http://www.theislamicseminary.org/wp/|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027221543/http://www.theislamicseminary.org/wp/|archivedate=2017-10-27}}</ref>\n\n== Other sources ==\nThis event is referred to in the Qur\u2019an, in [[Sura]]h 105, ''[[Al-Fil]]'' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0640\u0641\u0650\u0640\u064a\u0640\u0644}}, \"The Elephant\"), and is discussed in its related [[tafsir]].\n\nSome scholars have placed the Year of the Elephant one or two decades earlier than 570 CE,<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordencycloped03espo_0/page/154 154]|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World: Libe-Sare|last1=Esposito|first1=John L.|authorlink=John L.
