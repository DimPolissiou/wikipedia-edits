Sincere, Jr. |publisher=The American Civil Defense Association |journal=Journal of Civil Defense |date=October 1984 |page=17}}</ref> However, the onset of [[World War III]] is in the background and not fully elaborated. The story follows a group of American high school students who resist the occupation with [[guerrilla warfare]], naming themselves \"[[Wolverine]]s\", after their high school mascot.\n\n==Plot==\nThe United States has become strategically isolated after [[NATO]] is completely disbanded. At the same time, the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies aggressively expand their sphere of influence. In addition, the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian]] wheat harvest fails while a socialist ''[[coup d'etat]]'' occurs in Mexico.\n\nOn a September morning, in the small town of [[Calumet, Colorado|Calumet]], [[Colorado]], a local high school teacher pauses when he sees Soviet paratroopers landing in a nearby field. The paratroopers open fire when the teacher walks outside to question them. Pandemonium follows, as students flee amid heavy gunfire. Jed Eckert, who had dropped his brother Matt off at the high school, ragging him about a recent loss of a football game, returns to the high school and picks up Matt and several of their friends, narrowly escaping all that is going on.  In downtown Calumet, [[Cuban Army|Cuban]] and [[Soviet Army|Soviet troops]] are trying to impose order after a hasty occupation. Cuban Colonel Bella instructs the [[KGB]] to go to a local sporting goods store and obtain the records of the store's gun sales on the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms|ATF]]'s [[Form 4473]], which lists citizens who have purchased firearms.\n\nBrothers Jed and Matt Eckert, along with their friends Robert Morris, Danny, Daryl Bates, and Arturo \"Aardvark\" Mondragon, flee into the wilderness after hastily equipping themselves at the sporting goods store owned by Robert's father. While on the way to the mountains they run into a Soviet roadblock, but are saved by an attacking [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[UH-1]] helicopter gunship. After several weeks in the forest, they sneak back into town, where Jed and Matt learn that their father is being held in a [[re-education]] camp. They visit the site and speak to him through the fence, and learn that their mother is already dead; Mr. Eckert, reminding his sons of how he had purposely raised them in a strenuous manner, orders his sons to avenge his inevitable death and that of his wife.\n\nThe kids visit the Masons and learn that they are behind enemy lines in \"occupied America\". Robert's father is revealed to have been executed because of the missing inventory from his store. The Masons charge Jed and Matt with taking care of their two granddaughters, Toni and Erica. After killing Soviet soldiers in the woods, the youths begin an armed resistance against the occupation forces, calling themselves \"Wolverines\" after their high school mascot. The occupation forces initially try reprisal tactics, executing groups of civilians following every Wolverine attack. During one of these mass executions, the fathers of Jed, Matt, and Aardvark are killed. Daryl's father, Mayor Bates, tries to soften the blow against Calumet and save the lives of the captured citizens by appeasing the occupation authorities, effectively becoming a collaborator, but with little success. Despite the reprisal tactics, the occupation forces get nowhere.\n\nThe Wolverines find a downed American fighter pilot, Lt. Col. Andrew Tanner ([[Powers Boothe]]), who informs them of the current state of the war: several American cities, including Washington, D.C., were destroyed by nuclear strikes; the [[Strategic Air Command]] was crippled by Cuban saboteurs, and paratroopers were dropped from fake commercial airliners to seize key positions in preparation for subsequent assaults via Mexico and [[Alaska]]. Most of the Southern United States and North Western Canada has been taken over by the Soviets, but American counterattacks have halted Soviet advances along the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Mississippi River]] and the lines have stabilized. The only remaining U.S. allies, the United Kingdom and the [[People's Republic of China]], are militarily crippled. Concerned about [[nuclear fallout]], both sides refrain from the further use of nuclear weapons.\n\nTanner assists the Wolverines in organizing raids against the Soviets. Their actions draw the attention of a Soviet General, who orders reprisals against the civilian population. The Wolverines' actions, and the reprisals against civilians eventually leads to the high command of both sides of war to know the name \"Wolverines\", and the Soviet generals publicly stating that the area \"may not be pacified for much longer\". Soon after, in a visit to the front line, Tanner and Aardvark are killed in the crossfire of a tank battle. Daryl is caught by the Soviets after being turned in by his collaborating father. Using threats of torture, KGB officers force Daryl to swallow a [[tracking device]], then release him to rejoin the guerrillas. A ''[[Spetsnaz]]'' unit is sent into the mountains carrying portable [[radio triangulation]] equipment, but are ambushed by the Wolverines. The group traces the source of the radio triangulation signal to Daryl, who confesses and pleads for mercy. He is executed, along with a Spetsnaz operative by an increasingly hardened Robert when the others cannot find the heart to kill their friend. \n\nThe remaining [[Wolverine]]s are ambushed by [[Mi-24]] helicopter gunships, and Toni and Robert are killed, Robert while successfully but suicidally attacking a gunship. Jed and Matt go to attack the Soviet headquarters in Calumet, to distract the troops while Danny and Erica escape. The plan works, but both Jed and Matt are mortally wounded. Colonel Bella comes across the brothers, but sensing the already too-great loss of the war, the colonel is unable to bring himself to kill them, and so he motions them on. The brothers reach a bench in the park where they spent time as kids, holding each other as they die. Meanwhile, Danny and Erica trek through the Rocky Mountain Wilderness where they reach the frontier of Free America.\n\nIn the closing scene, a plaque is seen with Partisan Rock in the background. The rock is fenced off and an American flag flies nearby. The plaque reads:\n\n{{quote|... In the early days of World War III, guerrillas \u2013 mostly children \u2013 placed the names of their lost upon this rock. They fought here alone and gave up their lives, so \"that this nation shall not perish from the earth.\"}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Patrick Swayze]] as Jed Eckert\n* [[C.

It was set in the near future as a combined force of Russians and Cubans launched an invasion of the Southwestern US. Ten children take to the hills when their small town is captured and they turn into a skilled and lethal guerrilla band.<ref>Bart p 109\u2013110</ref>\n\nProducer [[Barry Beckerman]] read the script, and, in the words of Peter Bart, \"thought it had the potential to become a tough, taut, \"art\" picture  made on a modest budget that could possibly break out to find a wider audience.\"<ref name=\"Bart p 110\">Bart p 110</ref> He got his father Sidney Beckerman to help him pay a $5,000 option. Reynolds wanted to direct but the Beckermans wanted someone more established. [[Walter Hill]] briefly considered the script before turning it down. So too did other directors.<ref name=\"Bart p 110\"/>\n\nThe Beckermans pitched the project to [[David Begelman]] when he was at MGM and were turned down. They tried again at that studio when it was being run by [[Frank Yablans]]. Senior vice-president for production [[Peter Bart]], who remembers it as a \"sharply written anti-war movie ... a sort of ''[[Lord of the Flies]]''\",<ref name=\"bart\">{{cite news|title=First Look: Famous Firings a Tough Ax to Follow|last=Bart|first= Peter|newspaper=Variety|date=September 28, 2009|page=2}}</ref>  took the project to the head of the studio, [[Frank Yablans]].\n\nThe script's chances of being filmed increased when Kevin Reynolds became mentored by [[Steven Spielberg]] who helped him make ''[[Fandango (1985 film)|Fandango]]''.<ref name=\"Bart p 110\"/> MGM bought the script.\n\n===John Milius===\nBart recalls that things changed when \"the chieftains at MGM got a better idea. Instead of making a poignant little antiwar movie, why not make a teen ''Rambo'' and turn the project over to John Milius, a genial and rotund filmmaker who loved war movies and also loved war? The idea was especially popular with a member of the MGM board of directors, [[Alexander Haig|General Alexander Haig]], the former Nixon chief of staff, who yearned to supervise the film personally and develop a movie career.\"<ref name=\"bart\"/>\n\nBart says most of MGM's executives, except for Yablans, were opposed to Milius directing. Bart claims he made a last minute attempt to get Reynolds to direct the film and went to see Spielberg. However, by this stage ''Fandango'' was in rough cut, and Bart sensed that Spielberg was disappointed in the film and would not speak up for Reynolds.<ref>Bart p 111</ref>\n\nMilius was signed to direct at a fee of $1.25 million, plus a gun of his choice.<ref>Bart p 112</ref>\n\nMilius set about rewriting the script. He and Haig devised a backstory in which the circumstances of the invasion would take place; this was reportedly based on Hitler's proposed plans to invade the USA.<ref>Bart p 112\u2013113</ref> Haig took Milius under his wing, bringing him to the [[Hudson Institute]], the conservative think tank founded by [[Herman Kahn]], to develop a plausible scenario. Milius saw the story as a Third World liberation struggle in reverse; Haig introduced Nicaragua and suggested that, with the collapse of NATO, a left-wing Mexican regime would participate in the Soviet invasion, effectively splitting the U.S. in half.<ref>{{cite news | last=Hoberman | first=J. | title=The North Koreans Are Coming! | newspaper=Film Comment | edition=48.6 | date=November 2012 | pages=52\u201354, 56}}</ref> Bart says, \"Even Milius was taken aback by Haig's approach to the project. 'This is going to end up as a jingoistic, flag-waving movie,' Milius fretted. As a result, the budget of this once $6&nbsp;million movie almost tripled.\"<ref name=\"bart\"/>\n\nOther changes included a shift in focus from conflict within the group to conflict between the teens and their oppressors, and the acceleration of the ages of some of the characters from early teens to high school age and beyond.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=Tony |date=2007 |title=Hollywood's Cold War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QzIkDQAAQBAJ |location= |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=270 |isbn=9780748630738}}</ref> There was also the addition of a sequence where some children visit a camp to find their parents have been brainwashed.<ref>Bart p 113</ref>\n\nMilius later said, \"I see this as an anti-war movie in the sense that if both sides could see this, maybe it wouldn't have to happen. I think it would be good for Americans to see what a war would be like. The film isn't even that violent \u2013 the war shows none of the horrors that could happen in World War III. In fact, everything that happened in the movie happened in World War Two.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nBart says Yablans pushed through filming faster than Milius wanted because MGM needed a movie over the summer. Milius wanted more time to plan, including devising futuristic weaponry and to not shoot over winter, but had to accede.<ref>Bart p 114</ref>\n\nThe Pentagon withdrew its cooperation from the film.<ref>Bart p 133</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nMilius wanted [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] to play the US pilot but Frank Yablans overruled him. Powers Boothe was selected instead.<ref>Bart p 135</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe movie was filmed in and around the city of [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]]. Many of the buildings and structures which appear in the film, including a historic [[Fred Harvey Company]] hotel adjacent to the train depot, the train yard, and a building near downtown, which was repainted with the name of \"Calumet, Colorado\", are still there today. An old [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] grocery store was converted to a sound stage and used for several scenes in the movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/locations_reddawn.htm |title=Red Dawn Movie Filming Locations |work=The 80s Movies Rewind |publisher=Fast-rewind.com |accessdate=August 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBefore starting work on the movie, the cast underwent an intensive eight-week military training course. During that time, production crews designed and built special combat vehicles in [[Newhall, California]]. ''[[Soldier of Fortune (magazine)|Soldier of Fortune]]'' reported that the movie's [[T-72]] tank was such a precise replica that \"while it was being carted around Los Angeles, two [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[intelligence officer]]s followed it to the studio and wanted to know where it had come from\".\n\nPowers Boothe later claimed, \"Milius cut out the emotional life of its characters. Originally, my character was anti-war, as well as a rightist. I was supposed to be the voice of reason in that movie. But certain cuts negated my character.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=ACTOR FINDS SUCCESS IN THE WILDS|last=Baltake|first=Joe|newspaper= Philadelphia Daily News|date=July 18, 1985|page= 51}}</ref>\n\nLea Thompson says the original cut featured a love scene between her and Powers Boothe but it \"was cut out after some previews because of the age difference.

Sincere, Jr. |publisher=The American Civil Defense Association |journal=Journal of Civil Defense |date=October 1984 |page=17}}</ref> However, the onset of [[World War III]] is in the background and not fully elaborated. The story follows a group of American high school students who resist the occupation with [[guerrilla warfare]], naming themselves \"[[Wolverine]]s\", after their high school mascot.\n\n==Plot==\nThe United States has become strategically isolated after [[NATO]] is completely disbanded. At the same time, the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies aggressively expand their sphere of influence. In addition, the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian]] wheat harvest fails while a socialist ''[[coup d'etat]]'' occurs in Mexico.\n\nOn a September morning, in the small town of [[Calumet, Colorado|Calumet]], [[Colorado]], a local high school teacher pauses when he sees Soviet paratroopers landing in a nearby field. The paratroopers open fire when the teacher walks outside to question them. Pandemonium follows, as students flee amid heavy gunfire. Jed Eckert, who had dropped his brother Matt off at the high school, ragging him about a recent loss of a football game, returns to the high school and picks up Matt and several of their friends, narrowly escaping all that is going on.  In downtown Calumet, [[Cuban Army|Cuban]] and [[Soviet Army|Soviet troops]] are trying to impose order after a hasty occupation. Cuban Colonel Bella instructs the [[KGB]] to go to a local sporting goods store and obtain the records of the store's gun sales on the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms|ATF]]'s [[Form 4473]], which lists citizens who have purchased firearms.\n\nBrothers Jed and Matt Eckert, along with their friends Robert Morris, Danny, Daryl Bates, and Arturo \"Aardvark\" Mondragon, flee into the wilderness after hastily equipping themselves at the sporting goods store owned by Robert's father. While on the way to the mountains they run into a Soviet roadblock, but are saved by an attacking [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[UH-1]] helicopter gunship. After several weeks in the forest, they sneak back into town, where Jed and Matt learn that their father is being held in a [[re-education]] camp. They visit the site and speak to him through the fence, and learn that their mother is already dead; Mr. Eckert, reminding his sons of how he had purposely raised them in a strenuous manner, orders his sons to avenge his inevitable death and that of his wife.\n\nThe kids visit the Masons and learn that they are behind enemy lines in \"occupied America\". Robert's father is revealed to have been executed because of the missing inventory from his store. The Masons charge Jed and Matt with taking care of their two granddaughters, Toni and Erica. After killing Soviet soldiers in the woods, the youths begin an armed resistance against the occupation forces, calling themselves \"Wolverines\" after their high school mascot. The occupation forces initially try reprisal tactics, executing groups of civilians following every Wolverine attack. During one of these mass executions, the fathers of Jed, Matt, and Aardvark are killed. Daryl's father, Mayor Bates, tries to soften the blow against Calumet and save the lives of the captured citizens by appeasing the occupation authorities, effectively becoming a collaborator, but with little success. Despite the reprisal tactics, the occupation forces get nowhere.\n\nThe Wolverines find a downed American fighter pilot, Lt. Col. Andrew Tanner ([[Powers Boothe]]), who informs them of the current state of the war: several American cities, including Washington, D.C., were destroyed by nuclear strikes; the [[Strategic Air Command]] was crippled by Cuban saboteurs, and paratroopers were dropped from fake commercial airliners to seize key positions in preparation for subsequent assaults via Mexico and [[Alaska]]. Most of the Southern United States and North Western Canada has been taken over by the Soviets, but American counterattacks have halted Soviet advances along the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Mississippi River]] and the lines have stabilized. The only remaining U.S. allies, the United Kingdom and the [[People's Republic of China]], are militarily crippled. Concerned about [[nuclear fallout]], both sides refrain from the further use of nuclear weapons.\n\nTanner assists the Wolverines in organizing raids against the Soviets. Their actions draw the attention of a Soviet General, who orders reprisals against the civilian population. The Wolverines' actions, and the reprisals against civilians eventually leads to the high command of both sides of war to know the name \"Wolverines\", and the Soviet generals publicly stating that the area \"may not be pacified for much longer\". Soon after, in a visit to the front line, Tanner and Aardvark are killed in the crossfire of a tank battle. Daryl is caught by the Soviets after being turned in by his collaborating father. Using threats of torture, KGB officers force Daryl to swallow a [[tracking device]], then release him to rejoin the guerrillas. A ''[[Spetsnaz]]'' unit is sent into the mountains carrying portable [[radio triangulation]] equipment, but are ambushed by the Wolverines. The group traces the source of the radio triangulation signal to Daryl, who confesses and pleads for mercy. He is executed, along with a Spetsnaz operative by an increasingly hardened Robert when the others cannot find the heart to kill their friend. \n\nThe remaining [[Wolverine]]s are ambushed by [[Mi-24]] helicopter gunships, and Toni and Robert are killed, Robert while successfully but suicidally attacking a gunship. Jed and Matt go to attack the Soviet headquarters in Calumet, to distract the troops while Danny and Erica escape. The plan works, but both Jed and Matt are mortally wounded. Colonel Bella comes across the brothers, but sensing the already too-great loss of the war, the colonel is unable to bring himself to kill them, and so he motions them on. The brothers reach a bench in the park where they spent time as kids, holding each other as they die. Meanwhile, Danny and Erica trek through the Rocky Mountain Wilderness where they reach the frontier of Free America.\n\nIn the closing scene, a plaque is seen with Partisan Rock in the background. The rock is fenced off and an American flag flies nearby. The plaque reads:\n\n{{quote|... In the early days of World War III, guerrillas \u2013 mostly children \u2013 placed the names of their lost upon this rock. They fought here alone and gave up their lives, so \"that this nation shall not perish from the earth.\"}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Patrick Swayze]] as Jed Eckert\n* [[C.

Reynolds wanted to direct but the Beckermans wanted someone more established. [[Walter Hill]] briefly considered the script before turning it down. So too did other directors.<ref name=\"Bart p 110\"/>\n\nThe Beckermans pitched the project to [[David Begelman]] when he was at MGM and were turned down. They tried again at that studio when it was being run by [[Frank Yablans]]. Senior vice-president for production [[Peter Bart]], who remembers it as a \"sharply written anti-war movie ... a sort of ''[[Lord of the Flies]]''\",<ref name=\"bart\">{{cite news|title=First Look: Famous Firings a Tough Ax to Follow|last=Bart|first= Peter|newspaper=Variety|date=September 28, 2009|page=2}}</ref>  took the project to the head of the studio, [[Frank Yablans]].\n\nThe script's chances of being filmed increased when Kevin Reynolds became mentored by [[Steven Spielberg]] who helped him make ''[[Fandango (1985 film)|Fandango]]''.<ref name=\"Bart p 110\"/> MGM bought the script.\n\n===John Milius===\nBart recalls that things changed when \"the chieftains at MGM got a better idea. Instead of making a poignant little antiwar movie, why not make a teen ''Rambo'' and turn the project over to John Milius, a genial and rotund filmmaker who loved war movies and also loved war? The idea was especially popular with a member of the MGM board of directors, [[Alexander Haig|General Alexander Haig]], the former Nixon chief of staff, who yearned to supervise the film personally and develop a movie career.\"<ref name=\"bart\"/>\n\nBart says most of MGM's executives, except for Yablans, were opposed to Milius directing. Bart claims he made a last minute attempt to get Reynolds to direct the film and went to see Spielberg. However, by this stage ''Fandango'' was in rough cut, and Bart sensed that Spielberg was disappointed in the film and would not speak up for Reynolds.<ref>Bart p 111</ref>\n\nMilius was signed to direct at a fee of $1.25 million, plus a gun of his choice.<ref>Bart p 112</ref>\n\nMilius set about rewriting the script. He and Haig devised a backstory in which the circumstances of the invasion would take place; this was reportedly based on Hitler's proposed plans to invade the USA.<ref>Bart p 112\u2013113</ref> Haig took Milius under his wing, bringing him to the [[Hudson Institute]], the conservative think tank founded by [[Herman Kahn]], to develop a plausible scenario. Milius saw the story as a Third World liberation struggle in reverse; Haig introduced Nicaragua and suggested that, with the collapse of NATO, a left-wing Mexican regime would participate in the Soviet invasion, effectively splitting the U.S. in half.<ref>{{cite news | last=Hoberman | first=J. | title=The North Koreans Are Coming! | newspaper=Film Comment | edition=48.6 | date=November 2012 | pages=52\u201354, 56}}</ref> Bart says, \"Even Milius was taken aback by Haig's approach to the project. 'This is going to end up as a jingoistic, flag-waving movie,' Milius fretted. As a result, the budget of this once $6&nbsp;million movie almost tripled.\"<ref name=\"bart\"/>\n\nOther changes included a shift in focus from conflict within the group to conflict between the teens and their oppressors, and the acceleration of the ages of some of the characters from early teens to high school age and beyond.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=Tony |date=2007 |title=Hollywood's Cold War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QzIkDQAAQBAJ |location= |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=270 |isbn=9780748630738}}</ref> There was also the addition of a sequence where some children visit a camp to find their parents have been brainwashed.<ref>Bart p 113</ref>\n\nMilius later said, \"I see this as an anti-war movie in the sense that if both sides could see this, maybe it wouldn't have to happen. I think it would be good for Americans to see what a war would be like. The film isn't even that violent \u2013 the war shows none of the horrors that could happen in World War III. In fact, everything that happened in the movie happened in World War Two.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nBart says Yablans pushed through filming faster than Milius wanted because MGM needed a movie over the summer. Milius wanted more time to plan, including devising futuristic weaponry and to not shoot over winter, but had to accede.<ref>Bart p 114</ref>\n\nThe Pentagon withdrew its cooperation from the film.<ref>Bart p 133</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nMilius wanted [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] to play the US pilot but Frank Yablans overruled him. Powers Boothe was selected instead.<ref>Bart p 135</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe movie was filmed in and around the city of [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]]. Many of the buildings and structures which appear in the film, including a historic [[Fred Harvey Company]] hotel adjacent to the train depot, the train yard, and a building near downtown, which was repainted with the name of \"Calumet, Colorado\", are still there today. An old [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] grocery store was converted to a sound stage and used for several scenes in the movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/locations_reddawn.htm |title=Red Dawn Movie Filming Locations |work=The 80s Movies Rewind |publisher=Fast-rewind.com |accessdate=August 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBefore starting work on the movie, the cast underwent an intensive eight-week military training course. During that time, production crews designed and built special combat vehicles in [[Newhall, California]]. ''[[Soldier of Fortune (magazine)|Soldier of Fortune]]'' reported that the movie's [[T-72]] tank was such a precise replica that \"while it was being carted around Los Angeles, two [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[intelligence officer]]s followed it to the studio and wanted to know where it had come from\".\n\nPowers Boothe later claimed, \"Milius cut out the emotional life of its characters.

{"title_page": "Parthanatos", "text_new": "'''Parthanatos''' (derived from the Greek \u0398\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, \"[[Death]]\") is a form of [[programmed cell death]] that is distinct from other cell death processes such as [[necrosis]] and [[apoptosis]]. While necrosis is caused by acute cell injury resulting in traumatic cell death and apoptosis is a highly controlled process signalled by apoptotic [[Intracellular signaling|intracellular signals]], parthanatos is caused by the accumulation of PAR and the nuclear translocation of [[apoptosis-inducing factor]] (AIF) from [[mitochondria]].<ref name=\":0\">David KK, Andrabi SA, Dawson TM, Dawson VL. 2009. Parthanatos, a messenger of death. Front. Biosci. 14: 1116-28</ref> Parthanatos is also known as [[PARP1|PARP-1]] dependent cell death. PARP-1 mediates parthanatos when it is over-activated in response to extreme [[genomic stress]] and synthesizes PAR which causes [[nuclear translocation]] of AIF. Parthanatos is involved in diseases that afflict hundreds of millions of people worldwide.  Well known diseases involving parthanatos include [[Parkinson's disease]], [[stroke]], [[heart attack]], and [[diabetes]].  It also has potential use as a treatment for ameliorating disease and various medical conditions such as diabetes and [[obesity]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Name===\nThe term parthanatos was not coined until a review in 2009.<ref name=\":0\" />  The word parthanatos is derived from [[Thanatos]], the personification of death in Greek mythology.\n\n===Discovery===\nParthanatos was first discovered in a 2006 paper by Yu et al. studying the increased production of mitochondrial [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) by [[hyperglycemia]].<ref>Yu T, Robotham JL, Yoon Y. 2006. Increased production of reactive oxygen species in hyperglycemic conditions requires dynamic change of mitochondrial morphology. PNAS. 103(8): p 2653-2658.</ref>  This phenomenon is linked with negative effects arising from clinical complications of [[diabetes]] and [[obesity]].\n\nResearchers noticed that high glucose concentrations led to overproduction of [[reactive oxygen species]] and rapid fragmentation of [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]]. Inhibition of mitochondrial [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvate]] uptake blocked the increase of ROS, but did not prevent mitochondrial fragmentation. After incubating cells with the non-metabolizable [[Stereoisomerism|stereoisomer]] L-glucose, neither reactive oxygen species increase nor mitochondrial fragmentation were observed. Ultimately, the researchers found that mitochondrial fragmentation mediated by the fission process is a necessary component for high glucose-induced respiration increase and ROS overproduction. \n\nExtended exposure to high glucose conditions are similar to untreated diabetic conditions, and so the effects mirror each other.  In this condition, the exposure creates a periodic and prolonged increase in ROS production along with mitochondrial morphology change.  If [[mitochondrial fission]] was inhibited, the periodic fluctuation of ROS production in a high glucose environment was prevented.  This research shows that when cell damage to the ROS is too great, PARP-1 will initiate cell death.\n\n==Morphology==\n[[File:PARP1proteindomainbreakdown.png|thumbnail|430x170px|PARP-1 protein domain breakdown]]\n\n===Structure of PARP-1===\nPoly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 ([[PARP1|PARP-1]]) is a nuclear enzyme that is found universally in all [[eukaryote]]s and is encoded by the PARP-1 gene. It belongs to the PARP family, which is a group of catalysts that transfer [[ADP-ribose]] units from NAD (nicotinamide dinucleotide) to protein targets, thus creating branched or linear polymers.<ref>Vyas S, Chesarone-Cataldo M, Todorova T, Huang YH, Chang P. 2013. A systematic analysis of the PARP protein family identifies new functions critical for cell physiology. Nat Commun. 4: 2240.</ref> The major [[protein domain|domains]] of PARP-1 impart the ability to fulfill its functions. These protein sections include the [[DNA-binding domain]] on the [[N-terminus]] (allows PARP-1 to detect DNA breaks), the automodification domain (has a [[BRCA1]] C terminus motif which is key for protein-protein interactions), and a [[catalytic site]] with the NAD+-fold (characteristic of mono-ADP ribosylating toxins).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Role of PARP-1===\nNormally, PARP-1 is involved in a variety of functions that are important for cell [[homeostasis]] such as mitosis. Another of these roles is [[DNA repair]], including the repair of base lesions and single-strand breaks.<ref>Reynolds P, Cooper S, Lomax M, O\u2019Neill P. 2015. Disruption of PARP1 function inhibits base excision repair of a sub-set of DNA lesions. Nucleic Acids Res. 43(8): 4028-4038.</ref> PARP-1 interacts with a wide variety of substrates including [[histone]]s, [[helicases|DNA helicases]], high mobility group proteins, [[topoisomerase]]s I and II, single-strand break repair factors, [[base-excision repair|base-excision repair factors]], and several [[transcription factors]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Role of PAR===\nPARP-1 accomplishes many of its roles through regulating poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR). PAR is a [[polymer]] that varies in length and can be either linear or branched.<ref>Juarez-Salinas H, Mendoza-Alvarez H, Levi V, Jacobson MK, Jacobson EL. 1983. Simultaneous determination of linear and branched residues in poly(ADP-ribose). Anal Biochem. 131(2): 410-418.</ref> It is negatively charged which allows it to alter the function of the proteins it binds to either [[covalently]] or non-covalently.<ref name=\":0\" /> PAR binding affinity is strongest for branched polymers, weaker for long linear polymers and weakest for short linear polymers.<ref name=\":1\">Panzeter PL, Realini CA, Althaus FR. 1991. Noncovalent Interactions of Poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) with Histones. Biochemistry-US. 31: 1397-1385.</ref>  PAR also binds selectively with differing strengths to the different histones.<ref name=\":1\" /> It is suspected that PARP-1 modulates processes (such as [[DNA repair]], [[DNA transcription]], and [[mitosis]]) through the binding of PAR to its target proteins.\n\n==Pathway==\n\nThe parthanatos pathway is activated by [[DNA]] damage caused by [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic]] stress or [[excitotoxicity]].<ref name=\":2\">Fatokun AA, Dawson VL, Dawson TM. 2014. Parthanatos: mitochondrial-linked mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities. Br J Pahrmacol. 171:2000-2016.</ref> This damage is recognized by the PARP-1 enzyme which causes an [[upregulation]] in PAR. PAR causes translocation of [[apoptosis-inducing factor]] (AIF) from the mitochondria to the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] where it induces DNA fragmentation and ultimately [[cell death]].<ref name=\":3\">Andrabi SA, Kim NS, Yu SW, Wang H, Koh DW, Sasaki M et\u2009al. 2006. Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymer is a death signal. Proc Natl Acad Sci. 103: 18308\u201318313</ref> This general pathway has been outlined now for almost a decade. While considerable success has been made in understanding the molecular events in parthanatos, efforts are still ongoing to completely identify all of the major players within the pathway, as well how spatial and temporal relationships between mediators affect them.\n\n===Pathway activation===\nExtreme damage of DNA causing breaks and changes in [[chromatin]] structure have been shown to induce the parthanatos pathway.<ref name=\":2\" /> Stimuli that causes the DNA damage can come from a variety of different sources. [[Methylnitronitrosoguanidine]], an [[alkylation|alkylating agent]], has been widely used in several studies to induce the parthanatos pathway.<ref name=\":4\">Yu SW, Wang H, Poitras MF, Coombs C, Bowers WJ, Federoff HJ et al.

Differential role of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1in apoptotic and necrotic neuronal death induced by mild or intense [[NMDA]] exposure [[in vitro]]. Mol Cell Neurosci 25: 172\u2013180</ref> The damage must be extreme enough for the chromatin structure to be altered. This change in structure is recognized by the N-terminal [[zinc-finger]] domain on the PARP-1 protein.<ref>D'Amours D, Desnoyers S, D'Silva I, Poirier GG. 1999. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reactions in the regulation of nuclear functions. Biochem. J. 342: 249-268</ref> The protein can recognize both single and double strand DNA breaks.\n\n===Cell death initiation===\nOnce the PARP-1 protein recognizes the DNA damage, it [[catalyzes]] [[post-transcriptional modification]] of PAR.<ref name=\":3\" /> PAR will be formed either as a branched or linear molecule. Branching and long-chain polymers will be more toxic to the cell than simple short polymers.<ref name=\":5\">Zelphati O, Wang Y, Kitada S, Reed JC, Felgner PL, Corbeil J (2001). Intracellular delivery of proteins with a new lipid-mediated delivery system. J Biol Chem 276: 35103\u201335110.</ref> The more extreme the DNA damage, the more PAR accumulates in the nucleus. Once enough PAR has accumulated, it will translocate from the nucleus into the [[cytosol]]. One study has suggested that PAR can translocate as a free polymer,<ref name=\":5\" /> however translocation of a protein-conjugated PAR cannot be ruled out and is in fact a topic of active research.<ref name=\":2\" /> PAR moves through the cytosol and enters the mitochondria through depolarization.<ref name=\":3\" /> Within the mitochondria, PAR binds directly to the [[Apoptosis-inducing factor|AIF]] which has a PAR polymer binding site, causing the AIF to dissociate from the mitochondria.<ref>Wang Y, Kim NS, Haince JF, Kang HC, David KK, Andrabi SA et al. 2011. Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) binding to apoptosis-inducing factor is critical for PAR polymerase-1-dependent cell death (parthanatos). Sci Signal 4: ra20</ref> AIF is then translocated to the nucleus where it induces chromatin condensation and large scale (50Kb) DNA fragmentation.<ref name=\":3\" /> How AIF induces these effects is still unknown. It is thought that an AIF associated nuclease (PAAN) that is currently unidentified may be present.<ref name=\":2\" /> Human AIF have a DNA binding site<ref name=\":4\" /> that would indicate that AIF binds directly to the DNA in the nucleus directly causing the changes. However, as mice AIF do not have this binding domain and are still able to undergo parthanatos,<ref>Mate MJ, Ortiz-Lombardia M, Boitel B, Haouz A, Tello D, Susin SA et al. (2002). The crystal structure of the mouse apoptosis-inducing factor AIF. Nat Struct Biol 9: 442\u2013446.</ref> it is evident that there must be another mechanism involved.\n\n===PARG===\nPAR, which is responsible for the activation of AIF, is regulated in the cell by the [[enzyme]] poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase ([[PARG]]). After PAR is synthesized by PAR-1, it is degraded through a process catalyzed by PARG.<ref>Kameshita I, Matsuda Z, Taniguchi T, Shizuta Y (1984). Poly (ADP-Ribose) synthetase. Separation and identification of three proteolytic fragments as the substrate-binding domain, the DNA-binding domain, and the automodification domain. J Biol Chem 259:4770\u20134776.</ref> PARG has been found to protect against PAR-mediated cell death<ref name=\":3\" /> while its deletion has increased toxicity through the accumulation of PAR.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Other proposed mechanisms===\n\nBefore the discovery of the PAR and AIF pathway, it was thought that the overactivation of PARP-1 lead to over consumption of [[NAD+]].<ref>Berger NA, Sims JL, Catino DM, Berger SJ (1983). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase mediates the suicide response to massive DNA damage: studies in normal and DNA-repair defective cells. Princess Takamatsu Symp 13: 219\u2013226.</ref> As a result of NAD+ depletion, a decrease of ATP production would occur, and the resulting loss of energy would kill the cell.<ref>Berger NA, Berger SJ (1986). Metabolic consequences of DNA damage: the role of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase as mediator of the suicide response. Basic Life Sci 38: 357\u2013363.</ref><ref>Ha HC, Snyder SH. 1999. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase is a mediator of necrotic cell death by ATP depletion. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 96: 13978\u201313982</ref> However it is now known that this loss of energy would not be enough to account for cell death. In cells lacking [[PARG]], activation of PARP-1 leads to cell death in the presence of ample NAD+.<ref>Zhou Y, Feng X, Koh DW (2011). Activation of cell death mediated by apoptosis-inducing factor due to the absence of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase. Biochemistry 50: 2850\u20132859.</ref>\n\n===Differences between cell death pathways===\n\nParthanatos is defined as a unique cell death pathway from [[apoptosis]] for a few key reasons. Primarily, apoptosis is dependent on the [[caspase|caspase pathway]] activated by [[cytochrome c]] release, while the parthanatos pathway is able to act independently of caspase.<ref name=\":2\" /> Furthermore, unlike apoptosis, parthanatos causes large scale DNA fragmentation (apoptosis only produces small scale fragmentation) and does not form [[apoptotic|apoptotic bodies]].<ref>Wang Y, Dawson VL, Dawson TM. 2009. Poly(ADP-ribose) signals to mitochondrial [[Apoptosis-inducing factor|AIF]]: a key event in parthanatos. Exp Neurol 218: 193\u2013202.</ref>\nWhile parthanatos does share similarities with [[necrosis]], is also has several differences. Necrosis is not a regulated pathway and does not undergo any controlled nuclear fragmentation. While parthanatos does involve loss of cell membrane integrity like [[necrosis]], it is not accompanied by cell swelling.<ref>Wang H, Yu SW, Koh DW, Lew J, Coombs C, Bowers W et al. (2004). Apoptosis-inducing factor substitutes for caspase executioners in NMDA-triggered excitotoxic neuronal death.

Elevated levels of [[nitric oxide]] (NO) have been shown to cause [[neurotoxicity]] in samples of rat hippocampal [[neurons]].<ref name=\":6\">Dawson V, Dawson T, Bartley D, Solomon H. Mechanisms of Nitric Oxide-mediated neurotoxicity in primary brain cultures.1993. Journal of Neuroscience. 13(6): 2651-2661.</ref> A deeper look into the effects of NO on neurons showed that nitric oxides cause damage to DNA strands; the damage in turn elicits PAR enzyme activity that leads to further degradation and neuronal death. PAR- blockers halted the [[Cell death|cell death mechanisms]] in the presence of elevated NO levels.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nPARP activity has also been linked to the neurodegenerative properties of toxin induced [[Parkinsonism]]. 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine ([[MPTP]]) is a [[neurotoxin]] that has been linked to neurodegeneration and development of Parkinson Disease-like symptoms in patients since 1983. The MPTP toxin\u2019s effects were discovered when four people were intravenously injecting the [[toxin]] that they produced inadvertently when trying to street-synthesise the merpyridine ([[MPPP]]) drug.<ref>Langston JW, Ballard P, Tetrud JW, Irwin I. 1983. Chronic Parkinsonism in humans due to a     product of meperidine-analog synthesis.

While necrosis is caused by acute cell injury resulting in traumatic cell death and apoptosis is a highly controlled process signalled by apoptotic [[Intracellular signaling|intracellular signals]], parthanatos is caused by the accumulation of PAR and the nuclear translocation of [[apoptosis-inducing factor]] (AIF) from [[mitochondria]].<ref name=\":0\">David KK, Andrabi SA, Dawson TM, Dawson VL. 2009. Parthanatos, a messenger of death. Front. Biosci. 14: 1116-28</ref> Parthanatos is also known as [[PARP1|PARP-1]] dependent cell death. PARP-1 mediates parthanatos when it is over-activated in response to extreme [[genomic stress]] and synthesizes PAR which causes [[nuclear translocation]] of AIF. Parthanatos is involved in diseases that afflict hundreds of millions of people worldwide.  Well known diseases involving parthanatos include [[Parkinson's disease]], [[stroke]], [[heart attack]], and [[diabetes]].  It also has potential use as a treatment for ameliorating disease and various medical conditions such as diabetes and [[obesity]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Name===\nThe term parthanatos was not coined until a review in 2009.<ref name=\":0\" />  The word parthanatos is derived from [[Thanatos]], the personification of death in Greek mythology.\n\n===Discovery===\nParthanatos was first discovered in a 2006 paper by Yu et al. studying the increased production of mitochondrial [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) by [[hyperglycemia]].<ref>Yu T, Robotham JL, Yoon Y. 2006. Increased production of reactive oxygen species in hyperglycemic conditions requires dynamic change of mitochondrial morphology. PNAS. 103(8): p 2653-2658.</ref>  This phenomenon is linked with negative effects arising from clinical complications of [[diabetes]] and [[obesity]].\n\nResearchers noticed that high glucose concentrations led to overproduction of [[reactive oxygen species]] and rapid fragmentation of [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]]. Inhibition of mitochondrial [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvate]] uptake blocked the increase of ROS, but did not prevent mitochondrial fragmentation. After incubating cells with the non-metabolizable [[Stereoisomerism|stereoisomer]] L-glucose, neither reactive oxygen species increase nor mitochondrial fragmentation were observed. Ultimately, the researchers found that mitochondrial fragmentation mediated by the fission process is a necessary component for high glucose-induced respiration increase and ROS overproduction. \n\nExtended exposure to high glucose conditions are similar to untreated diabetic conditions, and so the effects mirror each other.  In this condition, the exposure creates a periodic and prolonged increase in ROS production along with mitochondrial morphology change.  If [[mitochondrial fission]] was inhibited, the periodic fluctuation of ROS production in a high glucose environment was prevented.  This research shows that when cell damage to the ROS is too great, PARP-1 will initiate cell death.\n\n==Morphology==\n[[File:PARP1proteindomainbreakdown.png|thumbnail|430x170px|PARP-1 protein domain breakdown]]\n\n===Structure of PARP-1===\nPoly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 ([[PARP1|PARP-1]]) is a nuclear enzyme that is found universally in all [[eukaryote]]s and is encoded by the PARP-1 gene. It belongs to the PARP family, which is a group of catalysts that transfer [[ADP-ribose]] units from NAD (nicotinamide dinucleotide) to protein targets, thus creating branched or linear polymers.<ref>Vyas S, Chesarone-Cataldo M, Todorova T, Huang YH, Chang P. 2013. A systematic analysis of the PARP protein family identifies new functions critical for cell physiology. Nat Commun. 4: 2240.</ref> The major [[protein domain|domains]] of PARP-1 impart the ability to fulfill its functions. These protein sections include the [[DNA-binding domain]] on the [[N-terminus]] (allows PARP-1 to detect DNA breaks), the automodification domain (has a [[BRCA1]] C terminus motif which is key for protein-protein interactions), and a [[catalytic site]] with the NAD+-fold (characteristic of mono-ADP ribosylating toxins).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Role of PARP-1===\nNormally, PARP-1 is involved in a variety of functions that are important for cell [[homeostasis]] such as mitosis. Another of these roles is [[DNA repair]], including the repair of base lesions and single-strand breaks.<ref>Reynolds P, Cooper S, Lomax M, O\u2019Neill P. 2015. Disruption of PARP1 function inhibits base excision repair of a sub-set of DNA lesions. Nucleic Acids Res. 43(8): 4028-4038.</ref> PARP-1 interacts with a wide variety of substrates including [[histone]]s, [[helicases|DNA helicases]], high mobility group proteins, [[topoisomerase]]s I and II, single-strand break repair factors, [[base-excision repair|base-excision repair factors]], and several [[transcription factors]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Role of PAR===\nPARP-1 accomplishes many of its roles through regulating poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR). PAR is a [[polymer]] that varies in length and can be either linear or branched.<ref>Juarez-Salinas H, Mendoza-Alvarez H, Levi V, Jacobson MK, Jacobson EL. 1983. Simultaneous determination of linear and branched residues in poly(ADP-ribose). Anal Biochem. 131(2): 410-418.</ref> It is negatively charged which allows it to alter the function of the proteins it binds to either [[covalently]] or non-covalently.<ref name=\":0\" /> PAR binding affinity is strongest for branched polymers, weaker for long linear polymers and weakest for short linear polymers.<ref name=\":1\">Panzeter PL, Realini CA, Althaus FR. 1991. Noncovalent Interactions of Poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) with Histones. Biochemistry-US. 31: 1397-1385.</ref>  PAR also binds selectively with differing strengths to the different histones.<ref name=\":1\" /> It is suspected that PARP-1 modulates processes (such as [[DNA repair]], [[DNA transcription]], and [[mitosis]]) through the binding of PAR to its target proteins.\n\n==Pathway==\n\nThe parthanatos pathway is activated by [[DNA]] damage caused by [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic]] stress or [[excitotoxicity]].<ref name=\":2\">Fatokun AA, Dawson VL, Dawson TM. 2014. Parthanatos: mitochondrial-linked mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities.

Once enough PAR has accumulated, it will translocate from the nucleus into the [[cytosol]]. One study has suggested that PAR can translocate as a free polymer,<ref name=\":5\" /> however translocation of a protein-conjugated PAR cannot be ruled out and is in fact a topic of active research.<ref name=\":2\" /> PAR moves through the cytosol and enters the mitochondria through depolarization.<ref name=\":3\" /> Within the mitochondria, PAR binds directly to the [[Apoptosis-inducing factor|AIF]] which has a PAR polymer binding site, causing the AIF to dissociate from the mitochondria.<ref>Wang Y, Kim NS, Haince JF, Kang HC, David KK, Andrabi SA et al. 2011. Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) binding to apoptosis-inducing factor is critical for PAR polymerase-1-dependent cell death (parthanatos). Sci Signal 4: ra20</ref> AIF is then translocated to the nucleus where it induces chromatin condensation and large scale (50Kb) DNA fragmentation.<ref name=\":3\" /> How AIF induces these effects is still unknown. It is thought that an AIF associated nuclease (PAAN) that is currently unidentified may be present.<ref name=\":2\" /> Human AIF have a DNA binding site<ref name=\":4\" /> that would indicate that AIF binds directly to the DNA in the nucleus directly causing the changes. However, as mice AIF do not have this binding domain and are still able to undergo parthanatos,<ref>Mate MJ, Ortiz-Lombardia M, Boitel B, Haouz A, Tello D, Susin SA et al. (2002). The crystal structure of the mouse apoptosis-inducing factor AIF. Nat Struct Biol 9: 442\u2013446.</ref> it is evident that there must be another mechanism involved.\n\n===PARG===\nPAR, which is responsible for the activation of AIF, is regulated in the cell by the [[enzyme]] poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase ([[PARG]]). After PAR is synthesized by PAR-1, it is degraded through a process catalyzed by PARG.<ref>Kameshita I, Matsuda Z, Taniguchi T, Shizuta Y (1984). Poly (ADP-Ribose) synthetase.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase mediates the suicide response to massive DNA damage: studies in normal and DNA-repair defective cells.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase is a mediator of necrotic cell death by ATP depletion. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 96: 13978\u201313982</ref> However it is now known that this loss of energy would not be enough to account for cell death. In cells lacking [[PARG]], activation of PARP-1 leads to cell death in the presence of ample NAD+.<ref>Zhou Y, Feng X, Koh DW (2011). Activation of cell death mediated by apoptosis-inducing factor due to the absence of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase. Biochemistry 50: 2850\u20132859.</ref>\n\n===Differences between cell death pathways===\n\nParthanatos is defined as a unique cell death pathway from [[apoptosis]] for a few key reasons. Primarily, apoptosis is dependent on the [[caspase|caspase pathway]] activated by [[cytochrome c]] release, while the parthanatos pathway is able to act independently of caspase.<ref name=\":2\" /> Furthermore, unlike apoptosis, parthanatos causes large scale DNA fragmentation (apoptosis only produces small scale fragmentation) and does not form [[apoptotic|apoptotic bodies]].<ref>Wang Y, Dawson VL, Dawson TM. 2009. Poly(ADP-ribose) signals to mitochondrial [[Apoptosis-inducing factor|AIF]]: a key event in parthanatos. Exp Neurol 218: 193\u2013202.</ref>\nWhile parthanatos does share similarities with [[necrosis]], is also has several differences. Necrosis is not a regulated pathway and does not undergo any controlled nuclear fragmentation. While parthanatos does involve loss of cell membrane integrity like [[necrosis]], it is not accompanied by cell swelling.<ref>Wang H, Yu SW, Koh DW, Lew J, Coombs C, Bowers W et al. (2004).
