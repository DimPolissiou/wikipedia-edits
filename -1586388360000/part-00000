Players who played ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' on the first day of release (October 26) were granted access the following day, November 28. Players who played the game within the first three days of release (October 26\u201329) were granted access on November 29, and the game opened for all other players on November 30.<ref name=\"Polygon: Beta\"/> The beta ended on May 15, 2019.<ref name=\"USgamer: reset\"/>}}|'''Microsoft Windows'''|November 5, 2019|'''Stadia'''|November 19, 2019}}\n| genre      = [[Action-adventure]]\n| modes      = [[Multiplayer]]\n}}\n\n'''''Red Dead Online''''' is an [[online multiplayer]] [[action-adventure game]] developed and published by [[Rockstar Games]] as the online component of ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]''. After several months in [[Beta release|beta]], ''Red Dead Online'' was released for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in May 2019,{{efn|name=Release}} and for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] in November 2019. Players control a [[silent protagonist]] who is freed from prison and tasked with taking revenge in exchange for their innocence. Set one year before the events of the single-player game, ''Red Dead Online'' comprises story missions where four players complete tasks to advance the narrative. The game also features several side missions and events.\n\nLike the single-player game, ''Red Dead Online'' is presented through both [[First-person (gaming)|first]] and [[Third-person view|third-person]] perspectives, and the player may freely roam in its interactive [[open world]]. Gameplay elements include shootouts, heists, [[hunting]], horseback riding, interacting with [[non-player character]]s, and maintaining the character's honor rating through moral choices and deeds. A bounty system governs the response of law enforcement and bounty hunters to crimes committed by players. Players can traverse the open world alone or in a posse of up to seven players, with or against whom they can partake in organized activities.\n\nDeveloped in tandem with the single-player story, ''Red Dead Online'' is viewed as a separate product despite the development team's wishes to translate elements of the single-player to a multiplayer environment. The team took lessons learned from the multiplayer of ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]'' when developing the game. ''Red Dead Online'' received criticism at launch for its balancing of gameplay and in-game currency; later updates addressed the issues. It received positive responses with praise for its presentation of missions, co-operative events, and technical improvements. The game is set to receive several updates over time, as with ''Grand Theft Auto Online''; updates throughout 2019 implemented roles that players can select to earn additional rewards.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Red Dead Online gameplay.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Players can use camps, either individually or as part of a posse, to rest, access their wardrobe, craft, cook, and fast-travel.]]\n\n''Red Dead Online'' is the multiplayer component of the 2018 video game ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]''.<ref name=\"Polygon: 7\"/> Played from a first or third-person perspective, the game is set in an open-world environment featuring a fictionalized version of the Western United States.<ref name=\"TechRadar Gameplay\"/> Player progression in the single-player story does not affect the multiplayer game. Upon entering the game world, players customize a [[player character|character]] and are [[free roam game|free to explore]] the environment alone or in a \"posse\" group. Players can partake in organized activities with or against members of their posse, or against other groups. As players complete activities throughout the game world, they receive [[experience points]] to [[level up (video gaming)|raise their characters in rank]] and receive bonuses, thereby progressing in the game.<ref name=\"Polygon: 7\"/>\n\nCamps can be set temporarily set up throughout the game world, either for an individual player or a posse, where players can rest, access their wardrobe, craft, cook, and fast-travel. Horses are the main forms of transportation, of which there are various breeds, each with different attributes. Players must either train or tame a wild horse to use it. Increased use of a horse will begin a bonding process, which can be increased by cleaning and feeding it, and the player will acquire advantages as they ride their horse. Players must insure their horse so it heals over time and cannot die.<ref name=\"Polygon Guide\"/>\n\nDispersed throughout the game world are story missions in which four players complete tasks to advance the game's narrative.<ref name=\"Polygon Guide\"/> The game world also features events in which up to 32 players can partake individually or with a posse group.<ref name=\"VG247 Beta\"/> Event types include a deathmatch mode devoid of firearms and a race mode by horseback. Players are notified when a competitive event begins somewhere in the game world and are given the option to immediately travel to the event. Alternatively, players can join specific events at will. Outside of events, [[non-player character]] (\"strangers\") in the game world offer missions, such as contract killings or camp raidings.<ref name=\"Polygon: 7\"/> Up to four players can join a temporary, ad hoc posse group for the duration of a game session. Alternatively, for a fee, up to seven players can join a persistent posse that regenerates when its leader comes online. Within a persistent posse, players can customize the group's style and track player stats. [[Friendly fire]] can be disabled so that teammates do not injure each other.<ref name=\"Polygon: 7\"/> If two players continue to kill each other, the game presents two optional modes: parley, in which the players are alone for ten minutes without weapons; and feud, where the two players partake in a three-minute shootout.<ref name=\"Polygon Guide\"/>\n\n''Red Dead Online'' adds several new systems atop the single-player mode's gameplay. In addition to in-game cash, which can be used for supplies, ''Online'' adds gold, a second in-game currency used to purchase luxury and special items. Players acquire gold nuggets by completing challenges and can convert 100 nuggets into gold bars. Rather than having to travel to a town's store, online player characters can order supplies anywhere from a handheld catalog. The orders become available for pickup in any town's post office or the player's camp. ''Online'' also introduces \"ability cards\", in which players can activate one active and three passive powers for their characters. Players receive these cards by rising in rank or direct purchase, and can then upgrade the cards with in-game currency or experience points.<ref name=\"Polygon: 7\"/> ''Red Dead Online'' uses the Honor system from the single-player story, measuring how the player's actions are perceived in terms of morality. Morally positive choices and deeds like helping strangers and abiding the law will add up to the player's Honor, while negative deeds such as theft and harming innocents will subtract from the player's Honor. Some story missions can only be initiated if the player's Honor is at a particular level.<ref name=\"Polygon Guide\"/>\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe story takes place in 1898, one year before the events of ''Red Dead Redemption 2''. The player takes on the role of a [[silent protagonist]] who is arrested for murder and imprisoned in Sisika Penitentiary. Six months into their sentence and awaiting execution, they are assigned to a work detail. The prison transport is intercepted in transit by a group of well-armed men who free the prisoners. Their leader introduces himself as Horley and escorts the player character to his employer, the widow Jessica LeClerk. Jessica tells the story of how her husband Philip was murdered by his business partners Jeremiah Shaw, Amos and Grace Lancing, and their outlaw accomplice Teddy Brown to gain control of his share of the business. The player character was arrested for the crime as a matter of convenience. Jessica claims to be the only person who knows of the player character's innocence as the caliber of bullets used to kill Philip did not match the caliber used by the player character. She lets the player character go with her blessing provided that they help her take revenge on Philip's killers.\n\nHorley sets the player to work assisting the sheriffs of Blackwater, Valentine, and Tumbleweed in apprehending wanted criminals and how the player handles decides their honor. If the player chooses an honorable path, their work attracts the attention of US Marshal Tom Davies, who enlists the player in locating notorious bandit Alfredo Montez. Knowing that Montez will continue to kill indiscriminately but lacking the evidence to prosecute him, Davies suggests that the player character bring Montez in dead rather than alive. The player apprehends Montez, which earns them a reputation with the Marshals as being reliable. This, in turn, allows them to work with the Marshals in finding Teddy Brown as the Marshals are coming under pressure from Shaw and the Lancings to leave Brown be. The player leads an assault on Fort Mercer, incapacitating Brown and killing his gang. Jessica questions him about Philip's murder and he claims sole responsibility for it. Jessica rejects this and executes him. Alternatively, if the player chooses a dishonorable path, Horley introduces them to bank robber Samson Finch. Finch is looking to put together a gang to carry out a robbery he has spent a year planning. He had been intending to rob a group of industrialists until he was betrayed by his partner. Finch has the player form a posse and attack the Fort Wallace garrison, killing his partner and thwarting a rival robbery plot. Disguised as dispatch riders, the gang rob a merchant bank in Saint Denis and make off with bearer bonds. \n\nWith Brown dead, Amos Lancing and Jeremiah Shaw try to finalize their takeover of Philip's business by coercing Jessica into signing a forged contract. Jessica, Horley, and the player mount a posse to confront them, which ends with Jessica shooting Lancing in broad daylight and Shaw fleeing after being confronted by Horley. Horley recovers the forged documents while the player and the posse protect Jessica and eventually escape out of town. Jessica laments the missed opportunity to confront Grace Lancing as she has now been declared a fugitive, but settles for knowing that Grace is now a widow too.\n\n===''A Life of 'Shine''===\n''A Life of 'Shine'' is a story chapter that was added as part of a free [[downloadable content]] update in December 2019. The story sees Cripps, the player character's outfitter, introduce the player character to Maggie Fike. Maggie once controlled the [[moonshine|moonshining]] business in Lemoyne, but disappeared after falling afoul of [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|revenue agents]] led by Reid Hixon. Maggie convinces the player character to invest in her business and help her carry out her revenge as Hixon had her locked in a shack with a burning still before it exploded, disfiguring her face. The player rescues Marcel, a French chef, from a rival moonshine operation to work the still and then frees Maggie's nephew Lemuel \"Lem\" Fike from the revenuers. This attracts the attention of the Braithwaite family, who have turned to moonshining to make ends meet. The Braithwaites have recruited Maggie's former cook Danny-Lee to oversee production and Maggie believes that Danny-Lee abandoned her when Hixon raided her business. The player character sabotages the Braithwaite operation by spiking their stills with a mixture that sours the flavour, ruining their reputation.\n\nMeanwhile, Lem sets about securing a shipment of ingredients to boost the business' production, but his carelessness leads Hixon and the revenuers directly to them. Hixon taunts Lem, claiming that he let the player character free Lem to lead the revenuers to Maggie. The player character helps Lem fight off waves of revenue agents and secures the shipment. Maggie realizes that they can use this to their advantage and has Lem arrange a meeting with Danny-Lee and the Braithwaites whilst simultaneously tipping Hixon off to the meeting. Lem and the player character plan to spring a trap for Hixon by detonating a volatile moonshine mix, but they are caught before they can set it off. Lem sets the trap off and the player character is forced to fight their way through a burning forest. They confront Hixon, who tries to bargain for his life, but the player character executes him. The player character kills the last of the Braithwaites' raiders and captures Danny-Lee. They take Danny-Lee back to Maggie, who intends to kill him, but he pleads with her, arguing that there was nothing he could do to save her the night of Hixon's raid. Maggie relents and spares him on the condition that she never sees him again. The player character, Maggie and Lem then return to producing moonshine.\n\n== Development ==\n''Red Dead Online'' was developed in tandem with the single-player story.<ref name=\"OXM\"/> Though ''Red Dead Online'' and ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' share assets and gameplay, Rockstar views them as separate products with independent trajectories, reflected in its decision to launch the multiplayer title separately. The development team took lessons learned from the multiplayer of ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010) and apply those with the best elements of ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]'' (2013), particularly in regards to introducing narrative elements to a multiplayer title.<ref name=\"IGN: reveal\"/> The team also seeks to translate elements of the single-player story to ''Red Dead Online'', overhauling them for an online space.<ref name=\"OXM\"/> Producer Rob Nelson felt that, while the team's experience on ''Grand Theft Auto Online'' helped with the foundations of ''Red Dead Online'', the differences in the game's direction, pace, and scale demanded a different overall approach, slowly leading the player into the world with smaller steps instead of the fast pace of ''Grand Theft Auto Online''.<ref name=\"OXM\"/>\n\n''Red Dead Online''{{'s}} [[public beta]] opened on November 27, 2018, to players who owned a special edition of the base game, and then progressively opened to all owners.<ref name=\"Polygon: 7\"/>{{efn|name=Release}} The progressive release was a choice by Rockstar to mitigate any major performance issues by the influx of players.<ref name=\"GameSpot Release\"/> Rockstar added and adapted several game modes during the game's beta stage,<ref name=\"Verge Gun Rush\"/> and made changes to the game's balance and economy.<ref name=\"Polygon Economy Fix\"/><ref name=\"Verge Grief\"/> Player progression in the public beta carried over when the beta ended on May 14, 2019. ''Red Dead Online'' implements [[microtransactions]] by letting players purchase gold bars for in-game items such as weapons and cosmetics. Rockstar had adopted a similar approach for ''Grand Theft Auto Online''.<ref name=\"USgamer: reset\"/>\n\n=== Additional content ===\nPost-release content is continually added to ''Red Dead Online'' through free title updates. Rockstar plans to evolve the game's world over time, including expanding the player's in-game businesses from a small camp to a larger company. Rockstar intends to add more role-playing elements to ''Red Dead Online'' over time,<ref name=\"OXM\"/> including additional roles and missions.<ref name=\"VG247 Interview\"/> One of the team's greater challenges with the game is the addition of experiences that allow player freedom without too much structure.<ref name=\"OXM\"/> In December 2018, saloons in the game world played [[Christmas music]].<ref name=\"Kotaku Christmas\"/>\n\nTo coincide with the full release of the game in May 2019, Rockstar released an update that included new story missions, dynamic events, free roam activities, and [[poker]].<ref name=\"GameSpot Beta\"/> The ''Frontier Pursuits'' update was added to the game on September 10, 2019,<ref name=\"GI Frontier Pursuits\"/> and implemented three new roles: bounty hunter, where players earn rewards by tracking down targets; trader, which involves players collecting and selling items to expand their camp into a business; and collector, which is focused on discovering collectibles using items such as a metal detector and binoculars.<ref name=\"GI Roles\"/> The development team decided to implement roles as a result of frequent player requests for a stronger connection to their character.<ref name=\"OXM\"/> The update also added an Outlaw Pass, which grants players access to additional rewards for an in-game price, and a limited promotion named the Wheeler, Rawson & Co Club, where players could unlock specific rewards as they gain experience.<ref name=\"GI Frontier Pursuits\"/> With each of the roles, players are assigned special tasks for a limited time, such as Legendary Bounties for bounty hunters and specific items for collectors.<ref name=\"IGN Legendary Bounties\"/> The moonshiner role was added to the game on December 13, 2019. An extension to the trader, the moonshiner role focuses on producing, managing, and distributing [[moonshine]]. The update also included additional content, such as the first purchasable property and a new Outlaw Pass.<ref name=\"GameSpot Moonshiner\"/> To celebrate Christmas in December 2019, Rockstar granted free supplies to players and added a temporary period of snowfall in the game world.<ref name=\"Polygon Christmas 2019\"/>\n\n== Reception ==\n''Red Dead Online'' received criticism at launch for its in-game currency rewards for activities, with players complaining that they were too low for the cost of goods and upgrades.<ref name=\"USgamer Economy\"/> Some players calculated that a single gold bar could take an estimated eight hours to earn in the game.<ref name=\"Polygon Economy\"/> Rockstar agreed to re-balance the game's economy following complaints.<ref name=\"Polygon Economy Fix\"/> Similar complaints also emerged about the [[Griefer|griefing]] taking place in the game;<ref name=\"Kotaku Griefing\"/> Rockstar fixed these issues by making player visibility dependent on their proximity and behavior.<ref name=\"Verge Grief\"/> ''[[The Verge]]'' reported that several users who played as black characters had been targeted by [[griefer]]s posing as [[Ku Klux Klan]]-inspired clans or [[slave catcher]]s who often called them racial slurs.<ref name=\"Verge Racist\"/>\n\n[[IGN]]'s Luke Reilly praised the game's co-operative story missions, noting that the game's [[player versus player]] modes typically have a skill imbalance. Reilly lauded the technical improvements made throughout the game's updates, though noted that some remained.<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/> Matt Martin of [[VG247]] found the game to be more enjoyable than ''Grand Theft Auto Online'', from both a technical and gameplay perspective. Martin criticized some balancing issues, but attributed them to the game's beta status.<ref name=\"VG247\"/> ''The Verge''{{'}}s Andrew Webster found ''Red Dead Online''{{'}}s [[Battle royale game|battle royale]] game mode more tense than games such as ''[[Fortnite]]'' due to the smaller player count and slower playstyle.<ref name=\"Verge BR\"/> ''[[Kotaku]]''{{'}}s Heather Alexandra wrote that ''Red Dead Online'' was \"gamier\" than its single-player counterpart, specifically in seeing the realistic towns transformed into deathmatch levels.<ref name=\"Kotaku Theme Park\"/> John Saavedra of [[Den of Geek]] criticized the simplicity of the story missions, writing that the free roam missions are a better way to \"break up the monotony\" of traversing the world.<ref name=\"Den of Geek\"/> Jordan Oloman of [[Eurogamer]] appreciated the improvements made to the game by May 2019, particularly praising the quality of the story missions, but felt that players needed more purpose within the game world.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Direction\"/>\n\n''Red Dead Online'' was nominated for Best Multiplayer Game at the 2019 [[Golden Joystick Awards]].<ref name=\"Golden Joystick 19

After several months in [[Beta release|beta]], ''Red Dead Online'' was released for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in May 2019,{{efn|name=Release}} and for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] in November 2019. Players control a [[silent protagonist]] who is freed from prison and tasked with taking revenge in exchange for their innocence. Set one year before the events of the single-player game, ''Red Dead Online'' comprises story missions where four players complete tasks to advance the narrative. The game also features several side missions and events.\n\nLike the single-player game, ''Red Dead Online'' is presented through both [[First-person (gaming)|first]] and [[Third-person view|third-person]] perspectives, and the player may freely roam in its interactive [[open world]]. Gameplay elements include shootouts, heists, [[hunting]], horseback riding, interacting with [[non-player character]]s, and maintaining the character's honor rating through moral choices and deeds. A bounty system governs the response of law enforcement and bounty hunters to crimes committed by players. Players can traverse the open world alone or in a posse of up to seven players, with or against whom they can partake in organized activities.\n\nDeveloped in tandem with the single-player story, ''Red Dead Online'' is viewed as a separate product despite the development team's wishes to translate elements of the single-player to a multiplayer environment. The team took lessons learned from the multiplayer of ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]'' when developing the game. ''Red Dead Online'' received criticism at launch for its balancing of gameplay and in-game currency; later updates addressed the issues. It received positive responses with praise for its presentation of missions, co-operative events, and technical improvements. The game is set to receive several updates over time, as with ''Grand Theft Auto Online''; updates throughout 2019 implemented roles that players can select to earn additional rewards.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Red Dead Online gameplay.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Players can use camps, either individually or as part of a posse, to rest, access their wardrobe, craft, cook, and fast-travel.]]\n\n''Red Dead Online'' is the multiplayer component of the 2018 video game ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]''.<ref name=\"Polygon: 7\"/> Played from a first or third-person perspective, the game is set in an open-world environment featuring a fictionalized version of the Western United States.<ref name=\"TechRadar Gameplay\"/> Player progression in the single-player story does not affect the multiplayer game. Upon entering the game world, players customize a [[player character|character]] and are [[free roam game|free to explore]] the environment alone or in a \"posse\" group. Players can partake in organized activities with or against members of their posse, or against other groups. As players complete activities throughout the game world, they receive [[experience points]] to [[level up (video gaming)|raise their characters in rank]] and receive bonuses, thereby progressing in the game.<ref name=\"Polygon: 7\"/>\n\nCamps can be set temporarily set up throughout the game world, either for an individual player or a posse, where players can rest, access their wardrobe, craft, cook, and fast-travel. Horses are the main forms of transportation, of which there are various breeds, each with different attributes. Players must either train or tame a wild horse to use it. Increased use of a horse will begin a bonding process, which can be increased by cleaning and feeding it, and the player will acquire advantages as they ride their horse. Players must insure their horse so it heals over time and cannot die.<ref name=\"Polygon Guide\"/>\n\nDispersed throughout the game world are story missions in which four players complete tasks to advance the game's narrative.<ref name=\"Polygon Guide\"/> The game world also features events in which up to 32 players can partake individually or with a posse group.<ref name=\"VG247 Beta\"/> Event types include a deathmatch mode devoid of firearms and a race mode by horseback. Players are notified when a competitive event begins somewhere in the game world and are given the option to immediately travel to the event. Alternatively, players can join specific events at will. Outside of events, [[non-player character]] (\"strangers\") in the game world offer missions, such as contract killings or camp raidings.<ref name=\"Polygon: 7\"/> Up to four players can join a temporary, ad hoc posse group for the duration of a game session. Alternatively, for a fee, up to seven players can join a persistent posse that regenerates when its leader comes online. Within a persistent posse, players can customize the group's style and track player stats. [[Friendly fire]] can be disabled so that teammates do not injure each other.<ref name=\"Polygon: 7\"/> If two players continue to kill each other, the game presents two optional modes: parley, in which the players are alone for ten minutes without weapons; and feud, where the two players partake in a three-minute shootout.<ref name=\"Polygon Guide\"/>\n\n''Red Dead Online'' adds several new systems atop the single-player mode's gameplay. In addition to in-game cash, which can be used for supplies, ''Online'' adds gold, a second in-game currency used to purchase luxury and special items. Players acquire gold nuggets by completing challenges and can convert 100 nuggets into gold bars. Rather than having to travel to a town's store, online player characters can order supplies anywhere from a handheld catalog. The orders become available for pickup in any town's post office or the player's camp. ''Online'' also introduces \"ability cards\", in which players can activate one active and three passive powers for their characters. Players receive these cards by rising in rank or direct purchase, and can then upgrade the cards with in-game currency or experience points.<ref name=\"Polygon: 7\"/> ''Red Dead Online'' uses the Honor system from the single-player story, measuring how the player's actions are perceived in terms of morality. Morally positive choices and deeds like helping strangers and abiding the law will add up to the player's Honor, while negative deeds such as theft and harming innocents will subtract from the player's Honor. Some story missions can only be initiated if the player's Honor is at a particular level.<ref name=\"Polygon Guide\"/>\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe story takes place in 1898, one year before the events of ''Red Dead Redemption 2''. The player takes on the role of a [[silent protagonist]] who is arrested for murder and imprisoned in Sisika Penitentiary. Six months into their sentence and awaiting execution, they are assigned to a work detail. The prison transport is intercepted in transit by a group of well-armed men who free the prisoners. Their leader introduces himself as Horley and escorts the player character to his employer, the widow Jessica LeClerk. Jessica tells the story of how her husband Philip was murdered by his business partners Jeremiah Shaw, Amos and Grace Lancing, and their outlaw accomplice Teddy Brown to gain control of his share of the business. The player character was arrested for the crime as a matter of convenience. Jessica claims to be the only person who knows of the player character's innocence as the caliber of bullets used to kill Philip did not match the caliber used by the player character. She lets the player character go with her blessing provided that they help her take revenge on Philip's killers.\n\nHorley sets the player to work assisting the sheriffs of Blackwater, Valentine, and Tumbleweed in apprehending wanted criminals and how the player handles decides their honor. If the player chooses an honorable path, their work attracts the attention of US Marshal Tom Davies, who enlists the player in locating notorious bandit Alfredo Montez. Knowing that Montez will continue to kill indiscriminately but lacking the evidence to prosecute him, Davies suggests that the player character bring Montez in dead rather than alive. The player apprehends Montez, which earns them a reputation with the Marshals as being reliable. This, in turn, allows them to work with the Marshals in finding Teddy Brown as the Marshals are coming under pressure from Shaw and the Lancings to leave Brown be. The player leads an assault on Fort Mercer, incapacitating Brown and killing his gang. Jessica questions him about Philip's murder and he claims sole responsibility for it. Jessica rejects this and executes him. Alternatively, if the player chooses a dishonorable path, Horley introduces them to bank robber Samson Finch. Finch is looking to put together a gang to carry out a robbery he has spent a year planning. He had been intending to rob a group of industrialists until he was betrayed by his partner. Finch has the player form a posse and attack the Fort Wallace garrison, killing his partner and thwarting a rival robbery plot. Disguised as dispatch riders, the gang rob a merchant bank in Saint Denis and make off with bearer bonds. \n\nWith Brown dead, Amos Lancing and Jeremiah Shaw try to finalize their takeover of Philip's business by coercing Jessica into signing a forged contract. Jessica, Horley, and the player mount a posse to confront them, which ends with Jessica shooting Lancing in broad daylight and Shaw fleeing after being confronted by Horley. Horley recovers the forged documents while the player and the posse protect Jessica and eventually escape out of town. Jessica laments the missed opportunity to confront Grace Lancing as she has now been declared a fugitive, but settles for knowing that Grace is now a widow too.\n\n===''A Life of 'Shine''===\n''A Life of 'Shine'' is a story chapter that was added as part of a free [[downloadable content]] update in December 2019. The story sees Cripps, the player character's outfitter, introduce the player character to Maggie Fike. Maggie once controlled the [[moonshine|moonshining]] business in Lemoyne, but disappeared after falling afoul of [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|revenue agents]] led by Reid Hixson. Maggie convinces the player character to invest in her business and help her carry out her revenge as Hixson had her locked in a shack with a burning still before it exploded, disfiguring her face. The player rescues Marcel, a French chef, from a rival moonshine operation to work the still and then frees Maggie's nephew Lem from the revenuers. This attracts the attention of the Braithwaite family, who have turned to moonshining to make ends meet. The Braithwaites have recruited Maggie's former cook Danny-Lee to oversee production and Maggie believes that Danny-Lee abandoned her when Hixson raided her business. The player character sabotages the Braithwaite operation by spiking their stills with a mixture that sours the flavour, ruining their reputation.\n\nMeanwhile, Lem sets about securing a shipment of ingredients to boost the business' production, but his carelessness leads Hixson and the revenuers directly to them. Hixson taunts Lem, claiming that he let the player character free Lem to lead the revenuers to Maggie. The player character helps Lem fight off waves of revenue agents and secures the shipment. Maggie realises that they can use this to their advantage and has Lem arrange a meeting with Danny-Lee and the Braithwaites whilst simultaneously tipping Hixson off to the meeting. Lem and the player character plan to spring a trap for Hixson by detonating a volatile moonshine mix, but they are caught before they can set it off. Lem sets the trap off and the player character is forced to fight their way through a burning forest. They confront Hixson, who tries to bargain for his life, but the player character executes him. The player character kills the last of the Braithwaites' soldiers and captures Danny-Lee. They take Danny-Lee back to Maggie, who intends to kill him, but he pleads with her, arguing that there was nothing he could do to save her the night of Hixson's raid. Maggie relents and spares him on the condition that she never sees him again. The player character, Maggie and Lem then return to producing moonshine.\n\n== Development ==\n''Red Dead Online'' was developed in tandem with the single-player story.<ref name=\"OXM\"/> Though ''Red Dead Online'' and ''Red Dead Redemption 2'' share assets and gameplay, Rockstar views them as separate products with independent trajectories, reflected in its decision to launch the multiplayer title separately. The development team took lessons learned from the multiplayer of ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010) and apply those with the best elements of ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]'' (2013), particularly in regards to introducing narrative elements to a multiplayer title.<ref name=\"IGN: reveal\"/> The team also seeks to translate elements of the single-player story to ''Red Dead Online'', overhauling them for an online space.<ref name=\"OXM\"/> Producer Rob Nelson felt that, while the team's experience on ''Grand Theft Auto Online'' helped with the foundations of ''Red Dead Online'', the differences in the game's direction, pace, and scale demanded a different overall approach, slowly leading the player into the world with smaller steps instead of the fast pace of ''Grand Theft Auto Online''.<ref name=\"OXM\"/>\n\n''Red Dead Online''{{'s}} [[public beta]] opened on November 27, 2018, to players who owned a special edition of the base game, and then progressively opened to all owners.<ref name=\"Polygon: 7\"/>{{efn|name=Release}} The progressive release was a choice by Rockstar to mitigate any major performance issues by the influx of players.<ref name=\"GameSpot Release\"/> Rockstar added and adapted several game modes during the game's beta stage,<ref name=\"Verge Gun Rush\"/> and made changes to the game's balance and economy.<ref name=\"Polygon Economy Fix\"/><ref name=\"Verge Grief\"/> Player progression in the public beta carried over when the beta ended on May 14, 2019. ''Red Dead Online'' implements [[microtransactions]] by letting players purchase gold bars for in-game items such as weapons and cosmetics. Rockstar had adopted a similar approach for ''Grand Theft Auto Online''.<ref name=\"USgamer: reset\"/>\n\n=== Additional content ===\nPost-release content is continually added to ''Red Dead Online'' through free title updates. Rockstar plans to evolve the game's world over time, including expanding the player's in-game businesses from a small camp to a larger company. Rockstar intends to add more role-playing elements to ''Red Dead Online'' over time,<ref name=\"OXM\"/> including additional roles and missions.<ref name=\"VG247 Interview\"/> One of the team's greater challenges with the game is the addition of experiences that allow player freedom without too much structure.<ref name=\"OXM\"/> In December 2018, saloons in the game world played [[Christmas music]].<ref name=\"Kotaku Christmas\"/>\n\nTo coincide with the full release of the game in May 2019, Rockstar released an update that included new story missions, dynamic events, free roam activities, and [[poker]].<ref name=\"GameSpot Beta\"/> The ''Frontier Pursuits'' update was added to the game on September 10, 2019,<ref name=\"GI Frontier Pursuits\"/> and implemented three new roles: bounty hunter, where players earn rewards by tracking down targets; trader, which involves players collecting and selling items to expand their camp into a business; and collector, which is focused on discovering collectibles using items such as a metal detector and binoculars.<ref name=\"GI Roles\"/> The development team decided to implement roles as a result of frequent player requests for a stronger connection to their character.<ref name=\"OXM\"/> The update also added an Outlaw Pass, which grants players access to additional rewards for an in-game price, and a limited promotion named the Wheeler, Rawson & Co Club, where players could unlock specific rewards as they gain experience.<ref name=\"GI Frontier Pursuits\"/> With each of the roles, players are assigned special tasks for a limited time, such as Legendary Bounties for bounty hunters and specific items for collectors.<ref name=\"IGN Legendary Bounties\"/> The moonshiner role was added to the game on December 13, 2019. An extension to the trader, the moonshiner role focuses on producing, managing, and distributing [[moonshine]]. The update also included additional content, such as the first purchasable property and a new Outlaw Pass.<ref name=\"GameSpot Moonshiner\"/> To celebrate Christmas in December 2019, Rockstar granted free supplies to players and added a temporary period of snowfall in the game world.<ref name=\"Polygon Christmas 2019\"/>\n\n== Reception ==\n''Red Dead Online'' received criticism at launch for its in-game currency rewards for activities, with players complaining that they were too low for the cost of goods and upgrades.<ref name=\"USgamer Economy\"/> Some players calculated that a single gold bar could take an estimated eight hours to earn in the game.<ref name=\"Polygon Economy\"/> Rockstar agreed to re-balance the game's economy following complaints.<ref name=\"Polygon Economy Fix\"/> Similar complaints also emerged about the [[Griefer|griefing]] taking place in the game;<ref name=\"Kotaku Griefing\"/> Rockstar fixed these issues by making player visibility dependent on their proximity and behavior.<ref name=\"Verge Grief\"/> ''[[The Verge]]'' reported that several users who played as black characters had been targeted by [[griefer]]s posing as [[Ku Klux Klan]]-inspired clans or [[slave catcher]]s who often called them racial slurs.<ref name=\"Verge Racist\"/>\n\n[[IGN]]'s Luke Reilly praised the game's co-operative story missions, noting that the game's [[player versus player]] modes typically have a skill imbalance. Reilly lauded the technical improvements made throughout the game's updates, though noted that some remained.<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/> Matt Martin of [[VG247]] found the game to be more enjoyable than ''Grand Theft Auto Online'', from both a technical and gameplay perspective. Martin criticized some balancing issues, but attributed them to the game's beta status.<ref name=\"VG247\"/> ''The Verge''{{'}}s Andrew Webster found ''Red Dead Online''{{'}}s [[Battle royale game|battle royale]] game mode more tense than games such as ''[[Fortnite]]'' due to the smaller player count and slower playstyle.<ref name=\"Verge BR\"/> ''[[Kotaku]]''{{'}}s Heather Alexandra wrote that ''Red Dead Online'' was \"gamier\" than its single-player counterpart, specifically in seeing the realistic towns transformed into deathmatch levels.<ref name=\"Kotaku Theme Park\"/> John Saavedra of [[Den of Geek]] criticized the simplicity of the story missions, writing that the free roam missions are a better way to \"break up the monotony\" of traversing the world.<ref name=\"Den of Geek\"/> Jordan Oloman of [[Eurogamer]] appreciated the improvements made to the game by May 2019, particularly praising the quality of the story missions, but felt that players needed more purpose within the game world.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Direction\"/>\n\n''Red Dead Online'' was nominated for Best Multiplayer Game at the 2019 [[Golden Joystick Awards]].<ref name=\"Golden Joystick 19

Thirty-five of the 100 seats in the [[United States Senate]] and all 435 seats in the [[United States House of Representatives]] were contested. Thirty-nine state and territorial [[Governor (United States)|governorships]] as well as numerous state and local elections were also contested.\n\nIn the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|United States House of Representatives]], Democrats made a net gain of 41 seats.{{efn|name=undecided|Democrats won a net gain of 40 seats on election day, but gained one more seat in a [[2018 Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district special election|special election]] held earlier in 2018.

In the [[2018 United States Senate elections|United States Senate]], Republicans expanded their majority by two seats, despite Democratic candidates receiving 52 million votes nationwide, while Republican candidates received 34 million. As a result of the 2018 elections, the [[116th United States Congress]] became the first Congress since the [[99th United States Congress]] ([[1984 United States elections|elected in 1984]]) in which the Democrats control the U.S. House of Representatives and the Republicans control the U.S. Senate. In the state elections, Democrats gained seven state governorships, control of at least 350 state legislative seats, and control of six state legislative chambers.\n \nThe elections marked the highest [[voter turnout]] seen in midterm elections since [[United States elections, 1914|1914]]. The elections saw several electoral firsts for women, racial minorities and [[LGBT]] candidates, including the election of the [[Jared Polis|first openly gay governor]] and the [[Kyrsten Sinema|first openly bisexual U.S. senator]]. In various referenda, numerous states voted to expand [[Medicaid]] coverage, require [[Voter ID laws in the United States|voter identification]], establish independent [[redistricting commission]]s, legalize [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], repeal [[felony disenfranchisement]] laws and enact other proposals.\n\nDuring the campaign, Democrats focused on health care, frequently attacking Republicans for supporting repeal of provisions of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (also known as Obamacare), including protections for individuals with preexisting conditions. Republican messaging focused on immigration and the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]]. There were [[Russian interference in the 2018 United States elections|allegations of attempted Russian interference in these elections]] as well as [[Voter suppression in the United States#2017\u20132018|controversies regarding potential voter suppression]] and other alleged election irregularities. The election was widely characterized as a [[Wave elections in the United States|\"blue wave\" election]] in the U.S. House and in the gubernatorial races to an extent, but not in the U.S. Senate, where Democrats suffered a net loss of two seats.\n\n== Issues, advertisements, and campaigning ==\n\nIn May 2018, President Trump began to emphasize his effort to overcome the traditional strength of the non-presidential party in midterm elections, with the \"top priority for the White House [being to hold] the Republican majority in the Senate\".

Thirty-five of the 100 seats in the [[United States Senate]] and all 435 seats in the [[United States House of Representatives]] were contested. Thirty-nine state and territorial [[Governor (United States)|governorships]] as well as numerous state and local elections were also contested.\n\nIn the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|United States House of Representatives]], Democrats made a net gain of 41 seats.{{efn|name=undecided|Democrats won a net gain of 40 seats on election day, but gained one more seat in a [[2018 Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district special election|special election]] held earlier in 2018. One House seat in North Carolina remained vacant after the elections due to allegations of election fraud; a [[2019 North Carolina's 9th congressional district special election|special election]] filled it in 2019.}} The Democratic Party gained a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, thereby ending the [[Government trifecta|federal trifecta]] that the Republican Party had established in the [[United States elections, 2016|2016 elections]]. In the [[2018 United States Senate elections|United States Senate]], Republicans expanded their majority by two seats, despite Democratic candidates receiving 52 million votes nationwide, while Republican candidates received 34 million. As a result of the 2018 elections, the [[116th United States Congress]] became the first Congress since the [[99th United States Congress]] ([[1984 United States elections|elected in 1984]]) in which the Democrats control the U.S. House of Representatives and the Republicans control the U.S. Senate. In the state elections, Democrats gained seven state governorships, control of at least 350 state legislative seats, and control of six state legislative chambers.\n \nThe elections marked the highest [[voter turnout]] seen in midterm elections since [[United States elections, 1914|1914]]. The elections saw several electoral firsts for women, racial minorities and [[LGBT]] candidates, including the election of the [[Jared Polis|first openly gay governor]] and the [[Kyrsten Sinema|first openly bisexual U.S. senator]]. In various referenda, numerous states voted to expand [[Medicaid]] coverage, require [[Voter ID laws in the United States|voter identification]], establish independent [[redistricting commission]]s, legalize [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], repeal [[felony disenfranchisement]] laws and enact other proposals.\n\nDuring the campaign, Democrats focused on health care, frequently attacking Republicans for supporting repeal of provisions of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (also known as Obamacare), including protections for individuals with preexisting conditions. Republican messaging focused on immigration and the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]].

It aired in the UK on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] ([[Scottish Television]]) on Thursday 18 January 1968 (and a day later on [[ATV Midlands]] and [[Grampian Television|Grampian]]) and in the United States on [[CBS]] on 7 September 1968.<ref name=\"Pixley\">{{cite book |last=Pixley |first=Andrew |date=2007 |title=The Prisoner: A Complete Production Guide |url= |location= |publisher=Network Distributing |page=247 |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anorakzone.com/prisoner/girldeath.html |title=The Girl Who Was Death |author= |website=anorakzone.com |date= |publisher= |accessdate=22 March 2019 }}</ref>\n\nThe episode starred [[Patrick McGoohan]] as [[Number Six (The Prisoner)|Number Six]] and [[Kenneth Griffith]] in the first of two episodes he appeared in.<ref name=\"Davies\">{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Steven Paul |date=2007 |title=The Prisoner Handbook |url= |location= |publisher=Pan |page=138 |isbn=978-0-230-53028-7 |author-link= }}</ref> According to several sources, including ''The Prisoner'' by Robert Fairclough, this episode was adapted from an unused, two-part script originally commissioned for ''[[Danger Man]]''.<ref name=\"Pixley\"/>\n\n==Plot summary==\nA [[Cricket|cricket match]] ends in a player (Colonel Hawke-Englishe) being assassinated with a bomb disguised as a cricket ball. [[Number Six (The Prisoner)|Number Six]] is on an operational assignment, but it is unclear whether this is \"real time\", pre-[[The Village (The Prisoner)|The Village]], or possibly another induced hallucination.\n\nSecret messages are passed to him at a shoeshine box. In a record shop, he receives an assignment to find a Professor Schnipps who has been working on a rocket that will destroy all of [[London]]. It turns out that Colonel Hawke-Englishe was investigating the matter, which is why he was assassinated. He picks up where Colonel Hawke-Englishe left off in another match, but manages to avoid the same fate. He finds a note to meet a mysterious person at the local [[pub]]; while there, he drinks from a glass that says ''You have just been poisoned''. He then starts to drink numerous drinks to try and vomit out the poison.\n\nWhen he goes to the restroom, he gets another message to meet at the [[Turkish bath]]. While he is relaxing, a mysterious figure places a plastic dome over his head and locks his stall. Avoiding death, he now gets another message to go to the carnival, to the local fight. Number Six dresses up in a [[Sherlock Holmes]] costume with [[deerstalker hat]] and cape, with [[moustache]] and [[Muttonchops|mutton chop sideburns]]. \nAt the fight, he is picked for the next match and told by his opponent to go to the [[Tunnel of love (ride)|tunnel of love]]. He then hears the voice of a woman, which is a recording in his boat that is rigged with explosives. He tracks down, and is tracked by, a seductive woman called Sonia, alias \"Death\". She leaves the amusement park with Number Six in pursuit.\n\nThey come to an abandoned village, where Sonia has set traps. He successfully evades all of them, goes into a shed to avoid being shot, and rides a [[bulldozer]]. Sonia destroys it with a rocket launcher and departs.\n\nEventually, after faking his death, Number Six tracks Sonia to a [[lighthouse]] where Schnipps (dressed as [[Napoleon]]) and his associates are based. His lieutenants are dressed in [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]] uniforms and represent an apparently anti-London alliance composed of [[Scotland|Scottish]], [[Wales|Welsh]], [[Ireland|Irish]], and [[Northern England|Northern]] (particularly [[Yorkshire]]) marshals.\n\nNumber Six sabotages their firearms and hand grenades, rigging them to backfire or malfunction. Captured, Number Six is tied up and left inside the lighthouse, which is revealed to be the rocket. As it is about to launch, he escapes and the rocket blows up without launching, killing his adversaries.\n\nIn the end, it turns out that the adventure was nothing but a bedtime story which Number Six was telling to some children in the Village nursery. Number Two (who looks like Schnipps) and his assistant (who looks like Sonia) were hoping that he would drop his guard and allow some clue as to why he resigned.\n\nBut Number Six, after putting the children to bed, turns to the hidden camera and cheekily wishes: \"Good night, children... everywhere.\"\n\n==Additional guest cast==\n* [[Kenneth Griffith]] . . .

The fairground scenes were filmed in the former Kursaal Funfair<ref name=\"A Pixley\">{{cite book|first=Andrew|last=Pixley|year=2007|title=The Prisoner \u2013 A Complete Production Guide}}</ref> in [[Southend-on-Sea]], some of which appear in the episode as [[Rear projection effect|back projection]]<nowiki/>s.\n\n===Production notes===\nWhen Sonia traps Number Six in a hot box in the Turkish baths, she does so by sliding a broom shaft through the handles of the doors. This technique was used on [[James Bond]] in ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' two years before.\n\nThe episode features an actor named John Drake in a small role as a bowler in the two cricket matches featured in its early scenes; \"John Drake\" was the name of Patrick McGoohan's previous TV alter ego in the series ''[[Danger Man]]'', which reworked material from scripts not used in the previous series.\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe broadcast date of the episode varied in different ITV regions of the UK. This was the first episode that was not shown first on [[ATV Midlands]] and [[Grampian Television]] (who picked up ATV Midlands' broadcasts), since they had been forced to delay their broadcasts to accommodate the fact that the series finale [[Fall Out (The Prisoner)|Fall Out]] would be ready for screening on Friday 19 January as planned. As a result, ATV Midlands took a two week hiatus from broadcasting ''The Prisoner'' after airing [[Living in Harmony]] on 29 December 1967. The two colour episodes of [[Danger Man]] that had originally been planned to air after Fall Out were brought forward and screened on ATV Midlands and Grampian on Friday 5 and 12 January 1968.

It was written by [[Terence Feely]] and directed by [[David Tomblin]] and was the sixteenth produced. It aired in the UK on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] ([[Scottish Television]]) on Thursday 18 January 1968 (and a day later on [[ATV Midlands]] and [[Grampian Television|Grampian]]) and in the United States on [[CBS]] on 7 September 1968.<ref name=\"Pixley\">{{cite book |last=Pixley |first=Andrew |date=2007 |title=The Prisoner: A Complete Production Guide |url= |location= |publisher=Network Distributing |page=247 |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anorakzone.com/prisoner/girldeath.html |title=The Girl Who Was Death |author= |website=anorakzone.com |date= |publisher= |accessdate=22 March 2019 }}</ref>\n\nThe episode starred [[Patrick McGoohan]] as [[Number Six (The Prisoner)|Number Six]] and [[Kenneth Griffith]] in the first of two episodes he appeared in.<ref name=\"Davies\">{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Steven Paul |date=2007 |title=The Prisoner Handbook |url= |location= |publisher=Pan |page=138 |isbn=978-0-230-53028-7 |author-link= }}</ref> According to several sources, including ''The Prisoner'' by Robert Fairclough, this episode was adapted from an unused, two-part script originally commissioned for ''[[Danger Man]]''.<ref name=\"Pixley\"/>\n\n==Plot summary==\nA [[Cricket|cricket match]] ends in a player (Colonel Hawke-Englishe) being assassinated with a bomb disguised as a cricket ball. [[Number Six (The Prisoner)|Number Six]] is on an operational assignment, but it is unclear whether this is \"real time\", pre-[[The Village (The Prisoner)|The Village]], or possibly another induced hallucination.\n\nSecret messages are passed to him at a shoeshine box. In a record shop, he receives an assignment to find a Professor Schnipps who has been working on a rocket that will destroy all of [[London]]. It turns out that Colonel Hawke-Englishe was investigating the matter, which is why he was assassinated. He picks up where Colonel Hawke-Englishe left off in another match, but manages to avoid the same fate. He finds a note to meet a mysterious person at the local [[pub]]; while there, he drinks from a glass that says ''You have just been poisoned''. He then starts to drink numerous drinks to try and vomit out the poison.\n\nWhen he goes to the restroom, he gets another message to meet at the [[Turkish bath]]. While he is relaxing, a mysterious figure places a plastic dome over his head and locks his stall. Avoiding death, he now gets another message to go to the carnival, to the local fight. Number Six dresses up in a [[Sherlock Holmes]] costume with [[deerstalker hat]] and cape, with [[moustache]] and [[Muttonchops|mutton chop sideburns]]. \nAt the fight, he is picked for the next match and told by his opponent to go to the [[Tunnel of love (ride)|tunnel of love]]. He then hears the voice of a woman, which is a recording in his boat that is rigged with explosives. He tracks down, and is tracked by, a seductive woman called Sonia, alias \"Death\". She leaves the amusement park with Number Six in pursuit.\n\nThey come to an abandoned village, where Sonia has set traps. He successfully evades all of them, goes into a shed to avoid being shot, and rides a [[bulldozer]]. Sonia destroys it with a rocket launcher and departs.\n\nEventually, after faking his death, Number Six tracks Sonia to a [[lighthouse]] where Schnipps (dressed as [[Napoleon]]) and his associates are based. His lieutenants are dressed in [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]] uniforms and represent an apparently anti-London alliance composed of [[Scotland|Scottish]], [[Wales|Welsh]], [[Ireland|Irish]], and [[Northern England|Northern]] (particularly [[Yorkshire]]) marshals.\n\nNumber Six sabotages their firearms and hand grenades, rigging them to backfire or malfunction. Captured, Number Six is tied up and left inside the lighthouse, which is revealed to be the rocket. As it is about to launch, he escapes and the rocket blows up without launching, killing his adversaries.\n\nIn the end, it turns out that the adventure was nothing but a bedtime story which Number Six was telling to some children in the Village nursery. Number Two (who looks like Schnipps) and his assistant (who looks like Sonia) were hoping that he would drop his guard and allow some clue as to why he resigned.\n\nBut Number Six, after putting the children to bed, turns to the hidden camera and cheekily wishes: \"Good night, children... everywhere.\"\n\n==Additional guest cast==\n* [[Kenneth Griffith]] . . .

The fairground scenes were filmed in the former Kursaal Funfair<ref name=\"A Pixley\">{{cite book|first=Andrew|last=Pixley|year=2007|title=The Prisoner \u2013 A Complete Production Guide}}</ref> in [[Southend-on-Sea]], some of which appear in the episode as [[Rear projection effect|back projection]]<nowiki/>s.\n\n===Production notes===\nWhen Sonia traps Number Six in a hot box in the Turkish baths, she does so by sliding a broom shaft through the handles of the doors. This technique was used on [[James Bond]] in ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' two years before.\n\nThe episode features an actor named John Drake in a small role as a bowler in the two cricket matches featured in its early scenes; \"John Drake\" was the name of Patrick McGoohan's previous TV alter ego in the series ''[[Danger Man]]'', which reworked material from scripts not used in the previous series.\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe broadcast date of the episode varied in different ITV regions of the UK. This was the first episode that was not shown first on [[ATV Midlands]] and [[Grampian Television]] (who picked up ATV Midlands' broadcasts), since they had been forced to delay their broadcasts to accommodate the fact that the series finale [[Fall Out (The Prisoner)|Fall Out]] would be ready for screening on Friday 19 January as planned. As a result, ATV Midlands took a two week hiatus from broadcasting ''The Prisoner'' after airing [[Living in Harmony]] on 29 December 1967. The two colour episodes of [[Danger Man]] that had originally been planned to air after Fall Out were brought forward and screened on ATV Midlands and Grampian on Friday 5 and 12 January 1968. [[ITV Anglia|Anglia Television]], which had been broadcasting ''The Prisoner'' on Saturdays, one week behind ATV Midlands, also took a two week hiatus after broadcasting ''Living in Harmony'' on 6 January.\n\nThis delay meant that ATV Midlands and Grampian were no longer leading the series' broadcasts; the episode was first shown on [[Scottish Television]] Thursday 18 January 1968, on Friday 19 January on [[ATV Midlands]] and [[Grampian Television]],, on Sunday 21 January on [[ATV London]], whose broadcasts were also taken up by [[Southern Television]], [[Westward Television]] and [[ITV Tyne Tees|Tyne-Tees]]; on Friday 26 January  on [[Border Television]] on Saturday 27 January on [[ITV Anglia|Anglia Television]] and on Friday 16 February on [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]] in the North West, which had also taken a two week hiatus from broadcasting ''The Prisoner''. The aggregate viewing figures for the ITV regions that debuted the season in 1967 have been estimated at 8.9 million.

The performance video was streamed on the project's independent label's website, To whom it may concern., on November 16, 2010, and released as a digital album on December 4, the same year, the project's one-year anniversary. For the project's seven-year anniversary in 2016,<ref name=\"trailer\"/> the film was made available for download and streaming,<ref name=\"vod\"/> and released on DVD on April 10, 2017.<ref name=\"twimc3\"/>\n\nThe one-hour performance takes place in [[Handen]], Sweden, with a single attendee chosen by followers to represent the audience.\n\n==Background and performance==\n{| class=\"wikitable floatleft\" style=\"width:22em\"\n|+style=\"text-align:left\"|Set list\n|-\n|\n{{ordered list|style=margin-left:0\n| \"u-1\"\n| \"b\"\n| Interlude: \"Prelude 699130082.451322-5.4.21.3.1.20.9.15.14.1.12\"\n| \"t\"\n| Interlude: \"20101001\"\n| \"n\"\n| \"o\"\n| Interlude: \"13.1.14.4.18.1.7.15.18.1.1110\"\n| \"u-2\"\n| Interlude: \"15.6.6.9.3.9.14.1.18.21.13.56155\"\n| \"y\"\n| \"9.20.19.13.5.723378\"\n| \".\"\n}}\n|}\n\nTwo months since the release of \"y\", the seventh episode from the ''[[bounty (album)|bounty]]'' audiovisual series and album, a video requesting a volunteer was uploaded to iamamiwhomami's channel on October 1, 2010.<ref name=\"vogue\"/> This would be the first time the project addressed the audience directly, but not the first message the project delivered.<ref name=\"mtv-mail\"/> At the time, no official confirmation regarding who was behind the act, the internet's speculation already had name for the woman in the videos, Swedish singer-songwriter [[Jonna Lee (singer)|Jonna Lee]].<ref name=\"billboard\"/><ref name=\"telegraph\"/><ref name=\"mtv-jonna\"/>\nFollowing the cryptic nature of the project, the video instructed viewers to choose their representative by October 8, with full name, phone number, and address, with no explanation of the purpose.<ref name=\"yt20101001\"/> This resulted in fans choosing YouTube user Hillary ''tehhils'',<ref name=\"forsakenorder-20101001\"/> who had to decline claiming difficulties to obtain a passport and suggested to pass on the task to German<ref name=\"aqnb\"/><ref name=\"lonelyleaf\"/> user ''ShootUpTheStation''. Subsequently, a video documenting a phone call made by Jonna Lee to the volunteer was uploaded on November 9, where she interviews him with questions about things like health, phobias, habits, and beliefs, ending with \"we will pick you up to the airport\" and requesting him to \"film [his] entire journey\".<ref name=\"yt20101109\"/> A series of six short videos from ShootUpTheStation's camera were uploaded from November 12 to 15, in which he documented his journey and his stay at a hotel where multiple visitors would come in to deliver a lesson.<ref name=\"volunteer-playlist\"/><ref name=\"jwz\"/>\n\nOn November 15, 2010, a concert was finally announced on a video titled \"http&#58;&#47;&#47;towhomitmayconcern.cc&#47;\",<ref name=\"yt-announcement\"/><ref name=\"vogue\"/> which would later become the label's website and store.\n\nThe performance consist of the 7 ''bounty'' songs released in 2010, as well as the third ''[[bounty (album)|bounty]]'' prelude \u2014which would later have a studio version released as \"LIKE HELL\" on ionnalee's ''[[Everyone Afraid to Be Forgotten|EVERYONE AFRAID TO BE FORGOTTEN]]''\u2014, and a new song known as \".\" ({{lang|sv|punkt}}) \u2014studio version later released as \"shadowshow\" on ''[[Blue (iamamiwhoami album)|BLUE]]''\u2014. The interludes are also some of the preludes, and music from the promos leading to the concert.\n\n==Release==\nThe concert video installation began streaming at approximately 00:15 CET on November 16, 2010, on the label's website, lasting 64 minutes and was available to be viewed for three additional hours on the site.<ref name=\"higherplain\"/> The project went inactive after this, until it was released as a single-track album on digital stores and streaming platforms on December 4, 2010,<ref name=\"itunes\"/> coinciding with the audiovisual group's one-year anniversary. Along with the album release, singles for some songs from the performance were made available: \"b\", \"t\", \"n\", \"o\", \"u-2\", \"y\", and \".\" (pronounced \"{{lang|sv|[[wikt:punkt#Swedish|punkt]]}}\";<ref name=\"gaynight-interview\"/> \"period\" in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]).<ref name=\"itunes-iam\"/>\nIn 2013, the album and its singles were pulled from all retailers.<ref name=\"iambf\"/>\n\nAgain, for the project's seventh anniversary on December 4, 2016, the film was released for download and on-demand streaming, and then a DVD edition came on April 10, 2017.

During the years prior to the arrival of the Europeans, many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultures existed in the area,<ref name=\"YHS\">[http://www.yarmouth.me.us Yarmouth Historical Society], via the Yarmouth/North Yarmouth Community Guide, ''Portland Press Herald'', Summer 2007</ref> largely because of the natural features of the coastal land. Rivers provided several resources, including food, fertile soil, power for the mills and the navigability between the inland areas and the ocean.<ref>[http://www.yarmouthmehistory.org/ancient-north-yarmouth-and-yarmouth/ \"Ancient North Yarmouth and Yarmouth\"] - Yarmouth Historical Society</ref>\n\nIn 1640, a 31-year-old Englishman, George Felt, who had emigrated to [[Charlestown, Massachusetts]], eleven years earlier, purchased 300 acres of land at Broad Cove from John Phillips (b. 1607, d. c. 1667), a Welshman, and in 1643 became one of the first European settlers in Yarmouth. (His family in [[Bedfordshire, England]], went by the family name ''Felce''. He called himself George ''Felch'', however, when he moved to America. He began to be known as George ''Felt'' in his later years.)\n\nIn 1630, Felt married 29-year-old Elizabeth Wilkinson, with whom he had six children: Elizabeth, George Jr., Mary, Moses I, Aaron and Moses II. Around 1649, the family moved back to [[Malden, Massachusetts]], just as it was being incorporated into a city. They returned to Casco Bay in 1667, shortly after which Felt bought two thousand more acres of land from Phillips. In 1684, Felt moved back to Massachusetts. He died in Malden, aged about 84, with Elizabeth surviving him by only on year. The couple had become the first citizens of Malden to receive town aid, such was their fall from wealth during the latter stages of their time in Maine.\n\nEnglishman William Royall (b. circa 1595, d. 1676) emigrated to [[Salem, Massachusetts]], in July 1629, aboard the ''[[Lyon's Whelp]]''. He was a servant in the [[Massachusetts Bay Company|Massachusetts Bay Colony Company]], and after serving his seven years, he was provided with a land grant in the [[Casco Bay]] area of Maine. In 1636, he purchased a farm at what is now the upscale Lambert Point, next to Redding Creek, at the southern tip of Lambert Road, where he lived with his wife, [[County Durham]] native Phoebe Green. They had thirteen children together between 1639 and 1657, the first being son William Jr.\n\nThe Royal River has ever-since borne Royall Sr.'s name, minus the second ''L'', though two streets off Gilman Road \u2014 Royall Meadow Road and Royall Point Road \u2014 carry the original spelling. This stream and its vicinity were called by the Indians \"Westcustogo\" \u2014 a name that, until the early 1990s, was preserved by an inn of the same name on Princes Point Road at its intersection with Lafayette Street.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/me4/westcustogoinn/ Westcustogo Inn]</ref>  (The building remains but it is now occupied by another business.)\n\nRoyall's family moved to [[Dorchester, Massachusetts]], in 1675, a year before William Sr.'s death. (He was able to see Isaac, son of William Jr. and one of his four grandchildren, born in 1672 before they moved south.) Following in his grandfather's footsteps, some eighty years after the fact, Isaac's brother, Sam Royall, moved to Yarmouth sometime after 1724. He died in the town in 1784. His son, Elijah, followed six years later.\n\nJohn Cousins (b. circa 1596, d. 1682), a native of [[Wiltshire]], England, had arrived a year or more earlier than Royall, with his wife, Mary, occupying the neck of land between the branches of the stream which has since taken his last name, and owning the island now also so-named. Their son, Isaac,<ref name=banfield>[http://banfield-hodgkinsfamily.com/cousinsdocument2.pdf \"Cousins Make Mark on Maine\"] - banfield-hodgkinsfamily.com</ref> emigrated from Wiltshire in 1647, aged about 34, arriving with his new wife, Elizabeth.<ref name=banfield/>\n\n[[File:Royal River, Yarmouth, Maine.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Royal River]] rushing by the mill en route to the First Falls]]\n\nBy 1676, approximately sixty-five people lived in Westcustogo. Soon after, however, conflicts forged by [[King Philip's War]] caused them to abandon their homes and move south.<ref name=\"YHS\"/> John Cousins was injured and went to [[York, Maine]], to receive treatment. He died in Cider Hill, [[York County, Maine|York County]], in 1682, aged 86. He deeded his real estate in Casco Bay to his wife.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nAlso in 1676, Mussel Cove resident George Felt Jr. was killed on [[Peaks Island]] during the conflicts.<ref>[https://digitalcommons.usm.maine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=oml_rare_books \"A History of Peaks Island and Its People.

She had emigrated to America with her parents in 1635.\n\nSome settlers returned to their dwellings in 1679, and within twelve months the region became incorporated as [[North Yarmouth, Maine|North Yarmouth]], the eighth town of the [[province]] of Maine.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nIn 1684, an English developer named Walter Gendall claimed to own all of Felt's two thousand acres in Casco Bay. He had purchased one hundred acres from him in 1680.<ref name=banks/> Gendall had emigrated to America around 1640.<ref name=banks>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=yale.39002070890232&view=1up&seq=7 ''Captain Walter Gendall, of North Yarmouth, Maine: A Biographical Sketch'', Doctor Charles E.

They continued the contest until nightfall, when the Indians retired. It was not long before they appeared again, in such force that the thirty-six families of the settlement were forced to flee, abandoning their homes for a second time.\n\nThe unrest kept the area deserted for many years, but by 1715 settlers revisited their homes, by which point they found their fields and the sites of their habitations covered by a young growth of trees. The mills at the First Falls were rebuilt first.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nIn 1722, a \"Committee for the Resettlement of North Yarmouth\" was formed in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].\n\nIn 1725, Massachusetts natives William and Matthew Scales were killed at the hands of the Indians. William's wife and daughter, both named Susannah, survived. His daughter married James Buxton the same year. They are both buried in the Ledge Cemetery.\n\nJoseph Felt, son of Moses Felt II, also perished. His wife, Sarah (Mills), and children were taken into captivity for five years. One of the captors remarked to Felt's widow: \"Husband much tough man! Shot good many times, no die! Take scalp off alive; then take knife and cut neck long 'round.\"<ref>''History of Cumberland County, Maine: Town of Cumberland'', Everts & Peck, 1880</ref> Joseph Felt's daughter and George Felt's great-granddaughter, Sarah, married in 1720 Captain Peter Weare, who recovered the family in some woods near Quebec. He later drowned while crossing the river near his home. The captain's son and Joseph Felt's brother-in-law, Joseph Weare, became a noted scout, pursuing the Native Americans at every opportunity until his death during a trip to Boston sometime after 1774. His widow, Mary Noyes, remarried, to Humphrey Merrill of Falmouth.\n\nOnce resettlement began, in 1727, the town's population began to grow rapidly. A proprietors' map was drawn up. It surveyed land divisions made with 103 original proprietors, each with a home lot of ten acres. If this lot was occupied and improved, the settler was permitted to apply for larger after-divisions.\n\nThe structural frame of the first [[meeting house]] was raised in 1729 near Westcustogo Hill on what is now Gilman Road, and nine years later the first school was built at the northwestern corner of the Princes Point Road intersection.\n\nNorth Yarmouth held its first town meeting on May 14, 1733.\n\nIn August 1746, a party of thirty-two Indians secreted themselves near the Lower Falls for the apparent purpose of surprising Weare's garrison, in the process killing 35-year-old Philip Greely, whose barking dog blew their cover.<ref name=rowe1936/> His wife was Hannah. Their son, Captain Jonathan Greeley, died in an engagement with a British [[frigate]] off [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]], in 1781. He was 39. Hannah remarried, to Jonathan Underwood.\n\nIn June 1748,<ref>[https://archives.mainegenealogy.net/2011/09/north-yarmouth-deaths-1736-1762.html North Yarmouth Necrology, 1736\u20131762)] - Rev. Amasa Loring</ref> a large party of Indians surprised four people near the Ledge meeting house. They killed the elderly Ebenezer Eaton.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nJoseph Burnell was the only inhabitant of the town to be killed at the hands of the Indians in 1751. He had been on horseback near the Presumpscot River falls when he was ambushed and shot. He was found scalped, with his steed lying nearby, having been shot four times.<ref name=rowe1936/> He left behind a wife and 14-year-old daughter, both named Sarah.\n\nIn 1756, Indians attacked the Means family, who lived at Flying Point. The family consisted of Thomas, his wife Alice, daughters Alice and Jane,<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/maineulsterscots/posts/1120272948037730 \"Maine Ulster Scots Project\"] - Facebook, May 6, 2016</ref> an infant son, Robert, and Molly Finney, sister of the patriarch and aged about sixteen. The family was dragged out of their home. Thomas was shot and scalped. Mother and baby ran back into the house and barricaded the door. One of the attackers shot through a hole in the wall, killing the infant and puncturing his mother's breast. John Martin, who had been sleeping in another room, fired at them, causing them to flee. They took with them Molly, whom they made follow them through the woods to Canada. Upon her arrival in Quebec, she was sold as a slave. A few months later, Captain William McLellan, of Falmouth, was in Quebec in charge of a group of prisoners for exchange. He had known Molly before her capture and secretly arranged for her escape. He came below her window and threw her a rope which she slid down. McLellan brought her back to Falmouth on his vessel. They married shortly afterwards.<ref name=rowe1936/> Alice remarried, to Colonel George Rogers. Thomas is interred in Freeport's First Parish Cemetery, alongside his son. His wife is buried with her second husband in Flying Point Cemetery.\n\nThe Means massacre was the last act of resistance by the indigenous people to occur within the limits of the town.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nBy 1764, 1,098 individuals lived in 154 houses. By 1810, the population was 3,295. During a time of peace, settlement began to relocate along the coast and inland.<ref name=\"YHS\"/>\n\nThe town's Main Street gradually became divided into the Upper Village (also known as the Corner) and Lower Falls, the split roughly located around the present-day [[U.S. Route 1 in Maine|U.S. Route 1]] overpass (Brickyard Hollow, as it was known). Among the new proprietors at the time were descendants of the [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]] [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]].\n\n[[File:Sylvanus Blanchard's house2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wooden plaques provided by the Yarmouth Village Improvement Society adorn more than 100 notable buildings in the town.

A 1975 replica now stands just beyond the brick schools on West Main Street.\n\n==Secession from North Yarmouth==\nYarmouth constituted the eastern part of North Yarmouth until 1849, when it [[secession|seceded]] and incorporated as an independent town. The split occurred due to bickering between the inland, farming-based contingent and the coastal maritime-oriented community. Unable to resolve this difference, the two halves of the town separated into present-day Yarmouth and North Yarmouth.<ref name=\"YHS\"/>\n\nIn 1849 there were nine districts in Yarmouth, designated by numbers: Number One: (Cousins) Island; Number Two: Ledge; Number Three: (Lower) Falls; Number Four: Corner; Number Five: (Princes) Point; Number Six: Greely Road; Number Seven: Pratt; Number Eight: Sweetser; and Number Nine: East (Main). By 1874, however, efforts were made to abolish this setup due its being seen as \"unfair\" in terms of fund distribution.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nBy 1850, Yarmouth's population was 2,144, and very little changed over the hundred years that followed.\n\n[[File:Sparhawk Mill 2 2018.jpg|400px|thumb|Looking down the [[Royal River]] from beneath the [[U.S. Route 1 in Maine|Route 1]] overpass in Royal River Park]]\n\n18th- and 19th-century business relied heavily upon a variety of natural resources. Once lumber was cut and sent to market, the land was farmed. [[Tanneries]] were built near brooks; potteries and brickyards put to use the natural clay in the area; and mills flourished along the Royal River, providing services such as iron-forging and fulling cloth.<ref name=\"YHS\"/>\n\n==Shipbuilding==\n[[File:Yarmouth harbor.jpg|thumb|300px|A circa-1870 view of Yarmouth harbor, taken from where Yankee Marina \u2014 off Lafayette Street \u2014 is now, looking directly north to the East Main Street bridge]]\n\nMaritime activities were important from the beginning of the third settlement. Almost three hundred vessels were launched by Yarmouth's shipyards in the century between 1790 and 1890.<ref name=\"Hall\">''Images of America: Yarmouth'', Hall, Alan M., Arcadia (2002)</ref> Lumber from inland areas was shipped out from the harbor. Vessels were being built by 1740, and by 1818 shipbuilding in the area was in full swing, though Yarmouth's industry peaked in the 1870s, and declined rapidly shortly thereafter. Four major shipyards built vessels during this period. On the western side of the river, Henry Hutchins and Edward J. Stubbs operated from 1851 to 1884. Sylvanus Blanchard and his three sons owned the Blanchard Brothers shipyard on Union Wharf.<ref>[https://www.fishermensvoice.com/archives/0411BackThen.html \"Back Then\"] - ''Fishermen's Voice''</ref> Lyman Fessenden Walker's (b. 1836, d. 1920) shipyard launched forty vessels of all sizes.

It was here that the final large sailing vessel was built, in 1890.<ref name=\"YHS\"/> Today, there are just two boatyards, one on either side of Lower Falls Landing: Yarmouth Boatyard (formerly Union Wharf; established in 1948; located almost beneath the northbound lanes of Interstate 295) and Yankee Marina (established in 1964; whose entrance is near the crest of the Route 88 hill).\n\n==19th century Yarmouth==\nIn 1887, a fire started in the dry grass south of Grand Trunk Station by a spark from a passing train. Fanned by a strong wind, it spread rapidly into the woods and up over the ledge. Two hundred acres were burned, and the fire was only stopped because it reached the waters of Broad Cove.<ref name=rowe1936>''Ancient North Yarmouth and Yarmouth, Maine 1636-1936: A History'', William Hutchison Rowe (1937)</ref>\n\nYarmouth's \"town system\"<ref name=rowe1936/> went into effect in April 1889.

A strong southerly breeze carried the sparks directly across the most thickly-settled part of town, causing small fires in various places so that over twenty buildings were burning concurrently.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nIn 1903, the post office established a route around town for the rural free delivery of mail. Hired was Joshua Adams Drinkwater as the town's first [[letter carrier]]. Early in the morning he would leave Princes Point, pick up the mail at Lower Falls, and then deliver letters to the northern edge of town, including Sligo and Mountfort Roads. Around noon, he would pick up the afternoon sack for the town's western and coastal farms. Each day, as he passed his farm on Princes Point Road, he would change horses and eat lunch with his wife, Harriet.<ref>''Images of America: Yarmouth'', Alan M.

(His family in [[Bedfordshire, England]], went by the family name ''Felce''. He called himself George ''Felch'', however, when he moved to America. He began to be known as George ''Felt'' in his later years.)\n\nIn 1630, Felt married 29-year-old Elizabeth Wilkinson, with whom he had six children: Elizabeth, George Jr., Mary, Moses I, Aaron and Moses II. Around 1649, the family moved back to [[Malden, Massachusetts]], just as it was being incorporated into a city. They returned to Casco Bay in 1667, shortly after which Felt bought two thousand more acres of land from Phillips. In 1684, Felt moved back to Massachusetts. He died in Malden, aged about 84, with Elizabeth surviving him by only on year. The couple had become the first citizens of Malden to receive town aid, such was their fall from wealth during the latter stages of their time in Maine.\n\nEnglishman William Royall (b. circa 1595, d. 1676) emigrated to [[Salem, Massachusetts]], in July 1629, aboard the ''[[Lyon's Whelp]]''. He was a servant in the [[Massachusetts Bay Company|Massachusetts Bay Colony Company]], and after serving his seven years, he was provided with a land grant in the [[Casco Bay]] area of Maine. In 1636, he purchased a farm at what is now the upscale Lambert Point, next to Redding Creek, at the southern tip of Lambert Road, where he lived with his wife, [[County Durham]] native Phoebe Green. They had thirteen children together between 1639 and 1657, the first being son William Jr.\n\nThe Royal River has ever-since borne Royall Sr.'s name, minus the second ''L'', though two streets off Gilman Road \u2014 Royall Meadow Road and Royall Point Road \u2014 carry the original spelling. This stream and its vicinity were called by the Indians \"Westcustogo\" \u2014 a name that, until the early 1990s, was preserved by an inn of the same name on Princes Point Road at its intersection with Lafayette Street.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/me4/westcustogoinn/ Westcustogo Inn]</ref>  (The building remains but it is now occupied by another business.)\n\nRoyall's family moved to [[Dorchester, Massachusetts]], in 1675, a year before William Sr.'s death. (He was able to see Isaac, son of William Jr. and one of his four grandchildren, born in 1672 before they moved south.) Following in his grandfather's footsteps, some eighty years after the fact, Isaac's brother, Sam Royall, moved to Yarmouth sometime after 1724. He died in the town in 1784. His son, Elijah, followed six years later.\n\nJohn Cousins (b. circa 1596, d. 1682), a native of [[Wiltshire]], England, had arrived a year or more earlier than Royall, with his wife, Mary, occupying the neck of land between the branches of the stream which has since taken his last name, and owning the island now also so-named.

They continued the contest until nightfall, when the Indians retired. It was not long before they appeared again, in such force that the thirty-six families of the settlement were forced to flee, abandoning their homes for a second time.\n\nThe unrest kept the area deserted for many years, but by 1715 settlers revisited their homes, by which point they found their fields and the sites of their habitations covered by a young growth of trees. The mills at the First Falls were rebuilt first.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nIn 1722, a \"Committee for the Resettlement of North Yarmouth\" was formed in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].\n\nIn 1725, Massachusetts natives William and Matthew Scales were killed at the hands of the Indians. William's wife and daughter, both named Susannah, survived. His daughter married James Buxton the same year. They are both buried in the Ledge Cemetery.\n\nJoseph Felt, son of Moses Felt II, also perished. His wife, Sarah (Mills), and children were taken into captivity for five years. One of the captors remarked to Felt's widow: \"Husband much tough man! Shot good many times, no die!

His widow, Mary Noyes, remarried, to Humphrey Merrill of Falmouth.\n\nOnce resettlement began, in 1727, the town's population began to grow rapidly. A proprietors' map was drawn up. It surveyed land divisions made with 103 original proprietors, each with a home lot of ten acres. If this lot was occupied and improved, the settler was permitted to apply for larger after-divisions.\n\nThe structural frame of the first [[meeting house]] was raised in 1729 near Westcustogo Hill on what is now Gilman Road, and nine years later the first school was built at the northwestern corner of the Princes Point Road intersection.\n\nNorth Yarmouth held its first town meeting on May 14, 1733.\n\nIn August 1746, a party of thirty-two Indians secreted themselves near the Lower Falls for the apparent purpose of surprising Weare's garrison, in the process killing 35-year-old Philip Greely, whose barking dog blew their cover.<ref name=rowe1936/> His wife was Hannah. Their son, Captain Jonathan Greeley, died in an engagement with a British [[frigate]] off [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]], in 1781. He was 39.

The family was dragged out of their home. Thomas was shot and scalped. Mother and baby ran back into the house and barricaded the door. One of the attackers shot through a hole in the wall, killing the infant and puncturing his mother's breast. John Martin, who had been sleeping in another room, fired at them, causing them to flee. They took with them Molly, whom they made follow them through the woods to Canada. Upon her arrival in Quebec, she was sold as a slave. A few months later, Captain William McLellan, of Falmouth, was in Quebec in charge of a group of prisoners for exchange. He had known Molly before her capture and secretly arranged for her escape. He came below her window and threw her a rope which she slid down. McLellan brought her back to Falmouth on his vessel.

Vessels were being built by 1740, and by 1818 shipbuilding in the area was in full swing, though Yarmouth's industry peaked in the 1870s, and declined rapidly shortly thereafter. Four major shipyards built vessels during this period. On the western side of the river, Henry Hutchins and Edward J. Stubbs operated from 1851 to 1884. Sylvanus Blanchard and his three sons owned the Blanchard Brothers shipyard on Union Wharf.<ref>[https://www.fishermensvoice.com/archives/0411BackThen.html \"Back Then\"] - ''Fishermen's Voice''</ref> Lyman Fessenden Walker's (b. 1836, d. 1920) shipyard launched forty vessels of all sizes.

A strong southerly breeze carried the sparks directly across the most thickly-settled part of town, causing small fires in various places so that over twenty buildings were burning concurrently.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nIn 1903, the post office established a route around town for the rural free delivery of mail. Hired was Joshua Adams Drinkwater as the town's first [[letter carrier]]. Early in the morning he would leave Princes Point, pick up the mail at Lower Falls, and then deliver letters to the northern edge of town, including Sligo and Mountfort Roads. Around noon, he would pick up the afternoon sack for the town's western and coastal farms.

Rugby was originally a small [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] farming settlement on the hill overlooking the [[River Avon, Warwickshire|River Avon]] and was mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as ''Rocheberie'', a popular theory is that this was a phonetic translation of the [[Old English]] name ''Hrocaberg'' meaning 'Hroca's hill fortification'; ''Hroca'' being an Anglo-Saxon man's name pronounced with a silent 'H', and ''berg'' being a name for a hill fortification, with the 'g' being pronounced as an 'ee' sound. By the 13th century the name of the town was commonly spelt as ''Rokeby'' before gradually evolving into the modern form.<ref name=\"RGOAT\">{{cite book |last1=Osbourne, Andy |first1=Rawlins, Eddy |title=Rugby Growth Of A Town |date=1988}}</ref> In 1140 the first mention was made of [[St Andrew's Church, Rugby|St Andrew's Church]] which was originally a chapel of the mother church at [[Clifton-upon-Dunsmore]], until Rugby was established as a [[parish]] in its own right in 1221. Rugby obtained a charter to hold a [[Marketplace|market]] in 1255, and soon developed into a small country [[market town]].<ref name=\"Rughistim\">{{cite web|title=Rugby history timeline|url=http://www.rugby-local-history.org/index.php/history?id=114|publisher=Rugby Local History Research Group|accessdate=30 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920204515/http://www.rugby-local-history.org/index.php/history?id=114|archive-date=20 September 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Rugby School]] was founded in 1567 with money left in the will of [[Lawrence Sheriff]], a locally born man, who moved to London and became grocer to Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Rugby School was originally intended as a school for local boys, but by the 18th century it had acquired a national reputation and gradually became a mostly fee-paying private school, with most of its pupils coming from outside Rugby. The [[Lawrence Sheriff School]] was eventually founded in 1878 to carry on Sheriff's original intentions.<ref>{{cite web|title=SHERIFF, Lawrence|url=http://www.rugby-local-history.org/index.php/biographies?id=97|publisher=Rugby Local History Group|accessdate=11 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412001354/http://www.rugby-local-history.org/index.php/biographies?id=97|archive-date=12 April 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Rughistim\"/>\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] passed through Rugby in 1642 on his way to [[Nottingham]], and 120 [[Cavalier]] Horse Troops reportedly stayed at the town, however the townsfolk were sympathetic to the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] cause, and they were disarmed by the Cavalier soldiers. Later, in 1645, Rugby was strongly Parliamentarian, and [[Oliver Cromwell]] and two regiments of [[Roundhead]] soldiers stayed at Rugby in April that year, two months before the [[Battle of Naseby]] in nearby [[Northamptonshire]].<ref name=\"RGOAT\"/><ref name=\"Rughistim\"/> \n\nThe growth of Rugby was slow, due in part to the nearby markets at [[Dunchurch]] and [[Hillmorton]] which were better positioned in terms of road traffic. In 1663 Rugby was recorded as containing 160 houses with a population of around 650. By 1730 this had increased to 183 houses, with a population of around 900. Rugby's importance and population increased more rapidly during the late 18th and early 19th century due to the growing national reputation of Rugby School, which had moved from its original location at a (now long vanished) schoolhouse north of St Andrew's Church, to its present location south of the town centre by 1750. By the time of the first national census in 1801, Rugby had a population of 1,487 with 278 houses. By 1831 this had increased further to 2,501 in 415 houses. This growth was driven by parents who wished to send their boys to Rugby School, but were unable to afford the boarding fees and so took up residence in Rugby.<ref name=\"RFASPAST\">''Rugby, Further Aspects Of The Past'' (1977) Rugby Local History Group</ref><ref name=\"BHOL\"/><ref name=\"RGOAT\"/>\n[[File:45 of '(Our own country.

From 1924 until 1942, the prominent Conservative [[David Margesson, 1st Viscount Margesson|David Margesson]] was Rugby's MP, his resignation triggered the [[1942 Rugby by-election]] which was won by an independent trade unionist [[William Brown (trade unionist)|William Brown]], who retained the seat until losing it to [[James Johnson (British politician)|James Johnson]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 1950. From 1950 until 1983 Rugby was a Labour-Conservative marginal, with the Labour Party holding it for the majority of that period.<ref name=\"CR\">{{cite web|title=THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CONSTITUENCIES BEGINNING WITH \"R\"|url=http://www.leighrayment.com/commons/Rcommons2.htm|publisher=leighrayment|accessdate=1 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219110721/http://www.leighrayment.com/commons/Rcommons2.htm|archive-date=19 December 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> \n\nIn 1983 Rugby was joined with [[Kenilworth]] to become part of the parliamentary constituency of [[Rugby and Kenilworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Rugby and Kenilworth]]. Between 1983 and 1997 [[Jim Pawsey]] was the Conservative Member of Parliament, losing in 1997 to Labour's [[Andy King (British politician)|Andy King]].

In the 2010 general election, the existing Rugby and Kenilworth constituency was  abolished and split in two. A new [[Rugby (UK Parliament constituency)|Rugby constituency]] was created, and a new constituency of [[Kenilworth and Southam (UK Parliament constituency)|Kenilworth and Southam]] formed to the south of Rugby, and as a result the town regained its pre-1983 status of returning its own member of parliament, albeit with the addition of the [[Bulkington]] Ward from [[Nuneaton (UK Parliament constituency)|Nuneaton]].

Rugby was originally a small [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] farming settlement on the hill overlooking the [[River Avon, Warwickshire|River Avon]] and was mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as ''Rocheberie'', a popular theory is that this was a phonetic translation of the [[Old English]] name ''Hrocaberg'' meaning 'Hroca's hill fortification'; ''Hroca'' being an Anglo-Saxon man's name pronounced with a silent 'H', and ''berg'' being a name for a hill fortification, with the 'g' being pronounced as an 'ee' sound. By the 13th century the name of the town was commonly spelt as ''Rokeby'' before gradually evolving into the modern form.<ref name=\"RGOAT\">{{cite book |last1=Osbourne, Andy |first1=Rawlins, Eddy |title=Rugby Growth Of A Town |date=1988}}</ref> In 1140 the first mention was made of [[St Andrew's Church, Rugby|St Andrew's Church]] which was originally a chapel of the mother church at [[Clifton-upon-Dunsmore]], until Rugby was established as a [[parish]] in its own right in 1221. Rugby obtained a charter to hold a [[Marketplace|market]] in 1255, and soon developed into a small country [[market town]].<ref name=\"Rughistim\">{{cite web|title=Rugby history timeline|url=http://www.rugby-local-history.org/index.php/history?id=114|publisher=Rugby Local History Research Group|accessdate=30 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920204515/http://www.rugby-local-history.org/index.php/history?id=114|archive-date=20 September 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Rugby School]] was founded in 1567 with money left in the will of [[Lawrence Sheriff]], a locally born man, who moved to London and became grocer to Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Rugby School was originally intended as a school for local boys, but by the 18th century it had acquired a national reputation and gradually became a mostly fee-paying private school, with most of its pupils coming from outside Rugby. The [[Lawrence Sheriff School]] was eventually founded in 1878 to carry on Sheriff's original intentions.<ref>{{cite web|title=SHERIFF, Lawrence|url=http://www.rugby-local-history.org/index.php/biographies?id=97|publisher=Rugby Local History Group|accessdate=11 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412001354/http://www.rugby-local-history.org/index.php/biographies?id=97|archive-date=12 April 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Rughistim\"/>\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] passed through Rugby in 1642 on his way to [[Nottingham]], and 120 [[Cavalier]] Horse Troops reportedly stayed at the town, however the townsfolk were sympathetic to the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] cause, and they were disarmed by the Cavalier soldiers. Later, in 1645, Rugby was strongly Parliamentarian, and [[Oliver Cromwell]] and two regiments of [[Roundhead]] soldiers stayed at Rugby in April that year, two months before the [[Battle of Naseby]] in nearby [[Northamptonshire]].<ref name=\"RGOAT\"/><ref name=\"Rughistim\"/> \n\nThe growth of Rugby was slow, due in part to the nearby markets at [[Dunchurch]] and [[Hillmorton]] which were better positioned in terms of road traffic. In 1663 Rugby was recorded as containing 160 houses with a population of around 650. By 1730 this had increased to 183 houses, with a population of around 900. Rugby's importance and population increased more rapidly during the late 18th and early 19th century due to the growing national reputation of Rugby School, which had moved from its original location at a (now long vanished) schoolhouse north of St Andrew's Church, to its present location south of the town centre by 1750. By the time of the first national census in 1801, Rugby had a population of 1,487 with 278 houses. By 1831 this had increased further to 2,501 in 415 houses. This growth was driven by parents who wished to send their boys to Rugby School, but were unable to afford the boarding fees and so took up residence in Rugby.<ref name=\"RFASPAST\">''Rugby, Further Aspects Of The Past'' (1977) Rugby Local History Group</ref><ref name=\"BHOL\"/><ref name=\"RGOAT\"/>\n[[File:45 of '(Our own country.

Rugby was described by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] as 'Butterfieldtown'<ref name=\"WarwickshireTownsAndVillages\">Allen, Geoff, (2000) ''Warwickshire Towns & Villages'', {{ISBN|1-85058-642-X}}</ref> due to the number of buildings designed by [[William Butterfield]] in the 19th century, including much of Rugby School and the extension of [[St Andrew's Church, Rugby|St Andrew's Church]].\n\nThe main shopping area in Rugby is in the streets around the Clock Tower, two of which \u2013 High Street and Sheep Street \u2013 were pedestrianised in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Rughistim\"/> Until the 19th century, Rugby's urban area consisted of only Market Place, High Street, Sheep Street, Church Street, North Street and what is now Lawrence Sheriff Street. These centred on what is now the Clock Tower, which was built in 1887 on the site of an ancient cross. These streets still form the core of the town centre. In the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era]]s several more shopping streets were added in order to cater for the growing town, including Albert Street and Regent Street, the latter of which was built in 1905, and was intended to be Rugby's main shopping street, although it never achieved this goal.<ref name=\"RGOAT\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Rugby roads J\u2013Y |url=http://www.rugby-local-history.org/index.php/rugby-roads?id=118 |publisher=Rugby Local History Research Group |accessdate=23 August 2019}}</ref> The town centre has an indoor shopping centre called [[Rugby Central Shopping Centre]] which opened in 1979 (previously named The Clock Tower shopping centre).<ref name=\"Rughistim\"/> A street [[market (place)|market]] is held in the town centre several days a week.

It was one of the two bright comets that had their perihelion in 1957, the other being [[Comet Arend\u2013Roland]]. Its peak magnitude was estimated to be around 1<ref>{{cite web |title=Brightest comets in the last two-thirds century |url=http://www.icq.eps.harvard.edu/brightest.html |website=www.icq.eps.harvard.edu |date=November 17, 2013}}</ref> and it has been characterised as a [[great comet]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richter |first1=N. |title=II Cometary physics and the comets Arend-Roland and Mrkos |journal=Vistas in Astronomy |date=January 1960 |volume=3 |pages=132\u2013137 |doi=10.1016/0083-6656(60)90013-1}}</ref>\n\n== Observations ==\nThe comet was discovered by Czech astronomer Antonin Mrkos by [[naked eye]], at the observatory on [[Lomnick\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. He announced its discovery on August 2, 1957 and by that point it was already discovered independently by others. However, the comet became known as comet Mrkos. The comet was then near perihelion and its [[apparent magnitude]] was estimated to be around 2.<ref name=\"Porter\">{{cite journal |last1=Porter |first1=J.G. |title=I Arend-Roland (1956h) and Mrkos (1957d) |journal=Vistas in Astronomy |date=January 1960 |volume=3 |pages=128\u2013132 |doi=10.1016/0083-6656(60)90012-X}}</ref>\n\nThe comet gradually moved away of the sun and became a conspicuous object visible after the sunset. The tail of the comet was estimated to be more than 5 degrees long.
