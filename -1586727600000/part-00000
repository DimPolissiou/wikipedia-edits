The aircraft took off from Addis Ababa at 08:38 [[East Africa Time|local time]] (05:38 [[coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) with 149 passengers and 8 crew on board.<ref name=National /> One minute into the flight, the first officer, acting on the instructions of the captain, reported a \"flight control\" problem to the control tower. Two minutes into the flight, the plane's [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System|MCAS]] system activated, pitching the plane into a dive toward the ground. The pilots struggled to control it and managed to prevent the nose from diving further, but the plane continued to lose altitude. The MCAS then activated again, dropping the nose even further down. The pilots then flipped a pair of switches to disable the electrical [[trim tab]] system, which also disabled the MCAS software. However, in shutting off the electrical trim system, they also shut off their ability to trim the [[stabilizer (aeronautics)|stabilizer]] into a neutral position with the electrical switch located on their [[yoke (aeronautics)|yokes]]. The only other possible way to move the stabilizer would be by cranking the wheel by hand, but because the stabilizer was located opposite to the [[elevator (aeronautics)|elevator]], strong aerodynamic forces were pushing on it. As the pilots had inadvertently left the engines on full takeoff power, which caused the plane to accelerate at high speed, there was further pressure on the stabilizer. The pilots' attempts to manually crank the stabilizer back into position failed. Three minutes into the flight, with the aircraft continuing to lose altitude and accelerating beyond its safety limits, the captain instructed the first officer to request permission from air traffic control to return to the airport. Permission was granted, and the air traffic controllers diverted other approaching flights. Following instructions from air traffic control, they turned the aircraft to the east, and it rolled to the right. The right wing came to point down as the turn steepened. At 8:43, having struggled to keep the plane's nose from diving further by manually pulling the yoke, the captain asked the first officer to help him, and turned the electrical trim tab system back on in the hope that it would allow him to put the stabilizer back into neutral trim. However, in turning the trim system back on, he also reactivated the MCAS system, which pushed the nose further down. The captain and first officer attempted to raise the nose by manually pulling their yokes, but the aircraft continued to plunge toward the ground.<ref name=\"nymag\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/world/boeing-737-max-ethiopian-airlines.html|title=Boeing 737 Max Hit Trouble Right Away, Pilot\u2019s Tense Radio Messages Show|last=Gebrekidan|first=Selam|date=2019-03-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-16|last2=Glanz|first2=James|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190315210038/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/world/boeing-737-max-ethiopian-airlines.html|archive-date=15 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe aircraft disappeared from radar screens and crashed at almost 08:44, six minutes after takeoff<!--, having reached an altitude of about 7,000 feet [[Above Ground Level]]{{fv}}-->.<ref name=et302prelimreport /><!-- Aviation Herald mean to use the abbreviation AMSL = \"Above Mean Sea Level\".

The aircraft took off from Addis Ababa at 08:38 [[East Africa Time|local time]] (05:38 [[coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) with 149 passengers and 8 crew on board.<ref name=National /> One minute into the flight, the first officer, acting on the instructions of the captain, reported a \"flight control\" problem to the control tower. Two minutes into the flight, the plane's [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System|MCAS]] system activated, pitching the plane into a dive toward the ground. The pilots struggled to control it and managed to prevent the nose from diving further, but the plane continued to lose altitude. The MCAS then activated again, dropping the nose even further down. The pilots then flipped a pair of switches to disable the electrical [[trim tab]] system, which also disabled the MCAS software. However, in shutting off the electrical trim system, they also shut off their ability to trim the [[stabilizer (aeronautics)|stabilizer]] into a neutral position with the electrical switch located on their [[yoke (aeronautics)|yokes]]. The only other possible way to move the stabilizer would be by cranking the wheel by hand, but because the stabilizer was located opposite to the [[elevator (aeronautics)|elevator]], strong aerodynamic forces were pushing on it. As the pilots had inadvertently left the engines on full takeoff power, which caused the plane to accelerate at high speed, there was further pressure on the stabilizer. The pilots' attempts to manually crank the stabilizer back into position failed. Three minutes into the flight, with the aircraft continuing to lose altitude and accelerating beyond its safety limits, the captain instructed the first officer to request permission from air traffic control to return to the airport. Permission was granted, and the air traffic controllers diverted other approaching flights. Following instructions from air traffic control, they turned the aircraft to the east, and it rolled to the right. The right wing came to point down as the turn steepened. At 8:43, having struggled to keep the plane's nose from diving further by manually pulling the yoke, the captain asked the first officer to help him, and turned the electrical trim tab system back on in the hope that it would allow him to put the stabilizer back into neutral trim. However, in turning the trim system back on, he also reactivated the MCAS system, which pushed the nose further down. The captain and first officer attempted to raise the nose by manually pulling their yokes, but the aircraft continued to plunge toward the ground.<ref name=\"nymag\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/world/boeing-737-max-ethiopian-airlines.html|title=Boeing 737 Max Hit Trouble Right Away, Pilot\u2019s Tense Radio Messages Show|last=Gebrekidan|first=Selam|date=2019-03-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-16|last2=Glanz|first2=James|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190315210038/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/world/boeing-737-max-ethiopian-airlines.html|archive-date=15 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe aircraft disappeared from radar screens and crashed at almost 08:44, six minutes after takeoff<!--, having reached an altitude of about 7,000 feet [[Above Ground Level]]{{fv}}-->.<ref name=et302prelimreport /><!-- Aviation Herald mean to use the abbreviation AMSL = \"Above Mean Sea Level\".

The largest excavation of korai was at the [[Acropolis of Athens]] in the 1880s.<ref name=\":3\" /> They served their purpose as votive offerings to the patron goddess, Athena, on the Acropolis throughout the sixth and early fifth century. However, in 480/479 BCE, Persians attacked and desecrated the city of Athens. This included the Acropolis and many of the statues that were there. After the attack, the Athenians buried the korai, whether they were broken or not, in \"graveyards\" on the Acropolis. It was believed they did this to rid the reminder of the act of barbarianism done by the Persians and allow Athens to rebuild into a new era.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Function==\n\n[[File:ACMA_681_Kore_Antenor_1.JPG|thumb|304x304px| Antenor Kore]]The kore statue had two main purposes.

How elaborate the statue was varied between each one. Korai demonstrated individual wealth and status because they were fairly expensive to create and limited to the upper class. To indicate their wealth, elite Greeks had their statues decorated in paint and jewels.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=A companion to ancient aesthetics|publisher=|others=Destr\u00e9e, Pierre|isbn=9781119009788|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=95\u201396|oclc=905450335|date = 2015-04-28}}</ref> An example of a kore used as a votive offering is the Antenor Kore which was dedicated by [[Nearchos (painter)|Nearkhos]].<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nAncient Greeks also used korai for funerary purposes.<ref name=\":1\" /> They were grave markers and offerings for the deceased. It is suggested by historians that the funerary kore portray the appearance of the dead. This became evident with their names being inscribed on the bases of the statues.<ref name=\":0\" /> An example would be the statue of [[Phrasikleia Kore|Phrasikleia]] unearthed from the Meogeia plain in Attica. The statue marked the grave of a young unwed girl according to the inscription found on the base.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=A companion to Greek art|date=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|others=Smith, Tyler Jo., Plantzos, Dimitris.|isbn=9781118273319|location=Malden, Mass.|pages=108\u2013110|oclc=797820354}}</ref>\n\nWhether korai were given as votive offerings or grave markers, according to historian Robin Osborne, they were allegoric symbols as \u201ctokens of exchange.\u201d Unlike the nude and distant kouroi, korai are completely clothed and engage with their viewer. Their arm is extended and offers gifts of fruit, flowers, and birds. Patrons used korai as offerings to the gods or the dead.

It has been difficult for historians and scholars to determine the identities of the korai statues, but they have theories of whom they might be. There are two theories that many historians are in agreement on for identification: the \"divinities\" theory and \"agalmata\" theory.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=The poetics of appearance in the Attic korai|last=Clorinda)|first=Stieber, Mary C.

This theory could only be true for some of the statues. The problem historians have with this theory is that not all of the statues share similar characteristics.<ref name=\":3\" /> If they represented a specific deity, then each kore would share traits to identify them as that particular individual. This became evident to the korai found at the Acropolis in Athens. Not all of the korai could be identified as Athena, the patron goddess, because of how unique each statue looks. No two korai look the same in appearance. They each have individual characteristics.<ref name=\":4\" /> According to Henri Lechat, in order for all of the korai to be goddesses, they would all be different female deities.<ref name=\":3\" /> That would be more divine beings than Greeks have in their [[Twelve Olympians|pantheon]]. However, some of the korai are actually divine figures, such as the Nikandre Kore as a statue of Artemis.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Agalmata theory ===\n\nThe \"agalmata\" theory proposes that many korai are generic maidens who represent the Archaic ideal of female beauty.<ref name=\":3\" /> Those maidens could be the priestesses, the donor of the statue, or young girls who served the goddess.<ref name=\":2\" /> The nice thing about this theory is that it does not really clash with other theories about identification. It accepts that some of the korai could be goddesses or other female divinities, but not all of them. Art historian Jeffery M. Hurwit suggests that the generic maidens were symbols for ideal beauty that embellished the sanctuaries and pleased the deities.<ref name=\":3\" /> Their presence is mainly meant to be a delightful gift for spectators to gaze upon. That was their identity above anything else. Korai were meant to bring delight and pleasure. The main idea for the patrons was that if the korai were pleasurable to look at, then it would also please the deity as well.&nbsp;\n\n==Polychromy==\n[[File:NAMABG-Peplos Kore as Artemis.JPG|thumb|277x277px|\nReconstruction of the Peplos Kore as Artemis.\n]][[File:Istanbul - Museo archeologico - Mostra sul colore nell'antichit\u00e0 02 - Foto G.

[[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], who pioneered the study of Greco-Roman art history in 1755, held strongly the belief that color in ancient sculpture was inferior and spoils the purely white marble.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Colour in sculpture : a survey from ancient Mesopotamia to the present|last=Hannelore|first=H\u00e4gele|publisher=|isbn=9781443852654|location=Newcastle upon Tyne, UK|pages=253|oclc=859834125|date = 2013-09-11}}</ref> His bias has been believed even today. Scientists and art historians try to counter this belief by providing evidence of visible remaining colors (mainly reds and blues that survive) and scientific research: microscopy and pigment analysis, ultraviolet fluorescence and reflection, and raking light.<ref name=\":6\" /> [[Vinzenz Brinkmann]] and his colleagues have been working to recreate these ancient works to represent their former glory in color.<ref name=\":6\" /> Scientists have been able to loosely determine colors used and possible appearances of sculptures when colored. However, most of the appearances that have been determined by researchers are only rough possibilities as seen with the Peplos Kore. Art historians debate who the Peplos Kore is.<ref name=\":02\" /> They believe the sculpture is either Artemis or the patron goddess of the Acropolis, Athena. Evidence leans towards the possibility of Artemis more.<ref name=\":02\" /> However, without the true coloring, it is difficult to say for sure.\n\nGreeks used color to depict narrative values in korai.<ref name=\":6\" /> Color did more than allow the artists to achieve a more life-like appearance.

One example of patterning is seen on an ''ependytes'', which is an Oriental prestige garment.<ref name=\":9\" /> This is seen on the Peplos Kore. Historians originally believed that the Peplos Kore was wearing a regular peplos, but in fact was wearing an ependytes with animal friezes. This type of garment was usually for goddesses.<ref name=\":9\" /> Without the colors, the context of the Peplos Kore was lost. The motifs used in the clothing could be used to identify which goddess it was supposed to be.\n\nThe Phrasikleia Kore is another example of polychromy being an important part of the korai. When the sculptor designed this kore, he incised into the marble, creating a light relief of a pattern. This is evident with the rosette and meander patterning in the dress.<ref name=\":5\" /> The technique used was common among sculptors when planning out the coloring of the finished product.<ref name=\":6\" /> Evidently, this shows that color was not just an afterthought for the artists. They used it with a purpose.\n\nColor was also an indicator of wealth. The more prestigious the use of color indicated a higher social position due to the high cost of dyes. Clothes in bright colors were more expensive.<ref name=\":9\" /> In addition, color was used to depict jewelry or gems on a kore.

There are two theories that many historians are in agreement on for identification: the \"divinities\" theory and \"agalmata\" theory.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=The poetics of appearance in the Attic korai|last=Clorinda)|first=Stieber, Mary C.

This theory could only be true for some of the statues. The problem historians have with this theory is that not all of the statues share similar characteristics.<ref name=\":3\" /> If they represented a specific deity, then each kore would share traits to identify them as that particular individual. This became evident to the korai found at the Acropolis in Athens. Not all of the korai could be identified as Athena, the patron goddess, because of how unique each statue looks. No two korai look the same in appearance. They each have individual characteristics.<ref name=\":4\" /> According to Henri Lechat, in order for all of the korai to be goddesses, they would all be different female deities.<ref name=\":3\" /> That would be more divine beings than Greeks have in their [[Twelve Olympians|pantheon]]. However, some of the korai are actually divine figures, such as the Nikandre Kore as a statue of Artemis.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Agalmata theory ===\n\nThe \"agalmata\" theory proposes that many korai are generic maidens who represent the Archaic ideal of female beauty.<ref name=\":3\" /> Those maidens could be the priestesses, the donor of the statue, or young girls who served the goddess.<ref name=\":2\" /> The nice thing about this theory is that it does not really clash with other theories about identification. It accepts that some of the korai could be goddesses or other female divinities, but not all of them. Art historian Jeffery M. Hurwit suggests that the generic maidens were symbols for ideal beauty that embellished the sanctuaries and pleased the deities.<ref name=\":3\" /> Their presence is mainly meant to be a delightful gift for spectators to gaze upon. That was their identity above anything else. Korai were meant to bring delight and pleasure. The main idea for the patrons was that if the korai were pleasurable to look at, then it would also please the deity as well.&nbsp;\n\n==Polychromy==\n[[File:NAMABG-Peplos Kore as Artemis.JPG|thumb|277x277px|\nReconstruction of the Peplos Kore as Artemis.\n]][[File:Istanbul - Museo archeologico - Mostra sul colore nell'antichit\u00e0 02 - Foto G.

{"title_page": "Fitness landscape", "text_new": "{{short description|Model used to visualise relationship between genotypes and reproductive success}}\n{{evolutionary biology}}\nIn [[evolutionary biology]], '''fitness landscapes''' or '''adaptive landscapes'''  (types of [[evolutionary landscape]]s) are used to visualize the relationship between [[genotype]]s and [[reproductive success]]. It is assumed that every [[genotype]] has a well-defined replication rate (often referred to as [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]). This fitness is the \"height\" of the landscape. Genotypes which are similar are said to be \"close\" to each other, while those that are very different are \"far\" from each other. The set of all possible genotypes, their degree of similarity, and their related fitness values is then called a fitness landscape. The idea of a fitness landscape is a metaphor to help explain [[argument from poor design|flawed forms]] in evolution by [[natural selection]], including exploits and glitches in animals like their reactions to [[supernormal stimulus|supernormal stimuli]].\n\nThe idea of studying evolution by visualizing the distribution of fitness values as a kind of landscape was first introduced by [[Sewall Wright]] in 1932.<ref name=Wright>{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Sewall |year=1932 |title=The roles of mutation, inbreeding, crossbreeding, and selection in evolution |journal=Proceedings of the Sixth International Congress on Genetics |volume=1 |issue=8 |pages=355\u201366 |url=http://www.esp.org/books/6th-congress/facsimile/contents/6th-cong-p356-wright.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn [[evolutionary algorithm|evolutionary optimization]] problems, fitness landscapes are evaluations of a [[fitness function]] for all candidate solutions (see below).\n\n==In biology==\n\n[[File:fitness-landscape-cartoon.png|thumb|Sketch of a fitness landscape. The arrows indicate the preferred flow of a population on the landscape, and the points A and C are local optima. The red ball indicates a population that has moved from a very low fitness value to the top of a peak.]]\n\nIn all fitness landscapes, height represents and is a visual metaphor for [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]. There are three distinct ways of characterizing the other dimensions, though in each case distance represents and is a metaphor for degree of dissimilarity.<ref name=Provine>{{cite book |last=Provine |first=William B. |title=Sewall Wright and Evolutionary Biology |year=1986 |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}{{pn|date=March 2018}}</ref>\n\nFitness landscapes are often conceived of as ranges of mountains. There exist local peaks (points from which all paths are downhill, i.e. to lower fitness) and valleys (regions from which many paths lead uphill). A fitness landscape with many local peaks surrounded by deep valleys is called rugged. If all [[genotype]]s<!--should we not (also) be talking about [[phenotype]]s here?--> have the same replication rate, on the other hand, a fitness landscape is said to be flat. An evolving [[population]] typically climbs uphill in the fitness landscape, by a series of small genetic changes, until -- in the infinite time limit -- a local optimum is reached. Note that a local optimum cannot always be found even in evolutionary time: if the local optimum can be found in a reasonable amount of time then the fitness landscape is called \"easy\" and if the time required is exponential then the fitness landscape is called \"hard\".<ref name=\"Kaznatcheev\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.genetics.org/content/212/1/245 |title=Computational Complexity as an Ultimate Constraint on Evolution |journal=Genetics |volume=212 |issue=1 |pages=245\u2013265 |last1=Kaznatcheev |first1=Artem |doi=10.1534/genetics.119.302000 |year=2019 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Visualization of two dimensions of a NK fitness landscape.png|thumb|Visualization of two dimensions of an [[NK model|NK fitness landscape]].

Instead, a network of genotypes are connected via mutational paths.\n\n[[Stuart Kauffman]]'s [[NK model]] falls into this category of fitness landscape.

See the visualizations below for examples of phenotype to fitness landscapes.\n\n==In evolutionary optimization==\n\nApart from the field of evolutionary biology, the concept of a fitness landscape has also gained importance in [[evolutionary algorithm|evolutionary optimization]] methods such as [[genetic algorithm]]s or [[evolution strategy|evolution strategies]]. In evolutionary optimization, one tries to solve real-world problems (e.g., [[engineering]] or [[logistics]] problems) by imitating the dynamics of biological evolution. For example, a delivery truck with a number of destination addresses can take a large variety of different routes, but only very few will result in a short driving time.\n\nIn order to use evolutionary optimization, one has to define for every possible [[solution point|solution]] ''s'' to the problem of interest (i.e., every possible route in the case of the delivery truck) how 'good' it is. This is done by introducing a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f(s)'' (scalar valued means that ''f(s)'' is a simple number, such as 0.3, while ''s'' can be a more complicated object, for example a list of destination addresses in the case of the delivery truck), which is called the [[fitness function]].\n\nA high ''f(s)'' implies that ''s'' is a good solution. In the case of the delivery truck, ''f(s)'' could be the number of deliveries per hour on route ''s''. The best, or at least a very good, solution is then found in the following way: initially, a population of random solutions is created. Then, the solutions are mutated and selected for those with higher fitness, until a satisfying solution has been found.\n\nEvolutionary optimization techniques are particularly useful in situations in which it is easy to determine the quality of a single solution, but hard to go through all possible solutions one by one (it is easy to determine the driving time for a particular route of the delivery truck, but it is almost impossible to check all possible routes once the number of destinations grows to more than a handful).\n\nThe concept of a scalar valued fitness function ''f(s)'' also corresponds to the concept of a potential or [[energy function]] in [[physics]]. The two concepts only differ in that [[physicists]] traditionally think in terms of minimizing the potential function, while [[biologists]] prefer the notion that fitness is being maximized. Therefore, taking the inverse of a potential function turns it into a fitness function, and vice versa.\n\n==Caveats and limitations==\nSeveral important caveats exist. Since the human mind struggles to think in greater than three dimensions, 3D topologies can mislead when discussing highly multi-dimensional fitness landscapes.<ref name=pmid21644947>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01236.x |pmid=21644947 |pmc=3668694 |title=Visualizing Fitness Landscapes |journal=Evolution |volume=65 |issue=6 |pages=1544\u201358 |year=2011 |last1=McCandlish |first1=David M }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=George R. |last1=McGhee |year=2006 |title=The Geometry of Evolution: Adaptive Landscapes and Theoretical Morphospaces |url={{Google books|YzzKx81IDLsC|plainurl=yes}} |isbn=978-1-139-45995-2 }}{{pn|date=March 2018}}</ref> In particular it is not clear whether peaks in natural biological fitness landscapes are ever truly separated by fitness valleys in such multidimensional landscapes, or whether they are connected by vastly long neutral ridges.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gavrilets |first=S. |authorlink=Sergey Gavrilets |title=Fitness Landscapes and the Origin of Species |year=2004 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages= |isbn=978-0-691-11983-0 }}{{pn|date=March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10539-008-9116-z |title=The end of the adaptive landscape metaphor? |journal=Biology & Philosophy |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=625\u201338 |year=2008 |last1=Kaplan |first1=Jonathan }}</ref> Additionally, the fitness landscape is not static in time but dependent on the changing environment and evolution of other genes.<ref name=pmid26844293/> It is hence more of a seascape,<ref name=pmid19232770>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2009.01.002 |pmid=19232770 |title=From fitness landscapes to seascapes: Non-equilibrium dynamics of selection and adaptation |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=111\u20139 |year=2009 |last1=Mustonen |first1=Ville |last2=L\u00e4ssig |first2=Michael }}</ref> further affecting how separated adaptive peaks can actually be.

It is assumed that every [[genotype]] has a well-defined replication rate (often referred to as [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]). This fitness is the \"height\" of the landscape. Genotypes which are similar are said to be \"close\" to each other, while those that are very different are \"far\" from each other. The set of all possible genotypes, their degree of similarity, and their related fitness values is then called a fitness landscape. The idea of a fitness landscape is a metaphor to help explain [[argument from poor design|flawed forms]] in evolution by [[natural selection]], including exploits and glitches in animals like their reactions to [[supernormal stimulus|supernormal stimuli]].\n\nThe idea of studying evolution by visualizing the distribution of fitness values as a kind of landscape was first introduced by [[Sewall Wright]] in 1932.<ref name=Wright>{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Sewall |year=1932 |title=The roles of mutation, inbreeding, crossbreeding, and selection in evolution |journal=Proceedings of the Sixth International Congress on Genetics |volume=1 |issue=8 |pages=355\u201366 |url=http://www.esp.org/books/6th-congress/facsimile/contents/6th-cong-p356-wright.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn [[evolutionary algorithm|evolutionary optimization]] problems, fitness landscapes are evaluations of a [[fitness function]] for all candidate solutions (see below).\n\n==In biology==\n\n[[File:fitness-landscape-cartoon.png|thumb|Sketch of a fitness landscape. The arrows indicate the preferred flow of a population on the landscape, and the points A and C are local optima. The red ball indicates a population that has moved from a very low fitness value to the top of a peak.]]\n\nIn all fitness landscapes, height represents and is a visual metaphor for [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]. There are three distinct ways of characterizing the other dimensions, though in each case distance represents and is a metaphor for degree of dissimilarity.<ref name=Provine>{{cite book |last=Provine |first=William B. |title=Sewall Wright and Evolutionary Biology |year=1986 |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}{{pn|date=March 2018}}</ref>\n\nFitness landscapes are often conceived of as ranges of mountains. There exist local peaks (points from which all paths are downhill, i.e. to lower fitness) and valleys (regions from which many paths lead uphill). A fitness landscape with many local peaks surrounded by deep valleys is called rugged. If all [[genotype]]s<!--should we not (also) be talking about [[phenotype]]s here?--> have the same replication rate, on the other hand, a fitness landscape is said to be flat. An evolving [[population]] typically climbs uphill in the fitness landscape, by a series of small genetic changes, until -- in the infinite time limit -- a local optimum is reached. Note that a local optimum cannot always be found even in evolutionary time: if the local optimum can be found in a reasonable amount of time then the fitness landscape is called _easy_ and if the time required is exponential then the fitness landscape is called _hard_.<ref name=\"Kaznatcheev\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.genetics.org/content/212/1/245 |title=Computational Complexity as an Ultimate Constraint on Evolution |journal=Genetics |volume=212 |issue=1 |pages=245\u2013265 |last1=Kaznatcheev |first1=Artem |doi=10.1534/genetics.119.302000 |year=2019 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Visualization of two dimensions of a NK fitness landscape.png|thumb|Visualization of two dimensions of an [[NK model|NK fitness landscape]].

Instead, a network of genotypes are connected via mutational paths.\n\n[[Stuart Kauffman]]'s [[NK model]] falls into this category of fitness landscape. Newer network analysis techniques such as selection-weighted attraction graphing (SWAG) also use a dimensionless genotype space.<ref name=pmid26844293>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/sciadv.1500921 |pmid=26844293 |pmc=4737206 |title=Environmental changes bridge evolutionary valleys |journal=Science Advances |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=e1500921 |year=2016 |last1=Steinberg |first1=B |last2=Ostermeier |first2=M |bibcode=2016SciA....2E0921S }}</ref>\n\n===Allele frequency to fitness landscapes===\n\nWright's mathematical work described fitness as a function of allele frequencies.<ref name=Provine /> Here, each dimension describes an allele frequency at a different gene, and goes between 0 and 1.\n\n===Phenotype to fitness landscapes===\n\nIn the third kind of fitness landscape, each dimension represents a different phenotypic trait.<ref name=Provine /> Under the assumptions of quantitative genetics, these phenotypic dimensions can be mapped onto genotypes. See the visualizations below for examples of phenotype to fitness landscapes.\n\n==In evolutionary optimization==\n\nApart from the field of evolutionary biology, the concept of a fitness landscape has also gained importance in [[evolutionary algorithm|evolutionary optimization]] methods such as [[genetic algorithm]]s or [[evolution strategy|evolution strategies]]. In evolutionary optimization, one tries to solve real-world problems (e.g., [[engineering]] or [[logistics]] problems) by imitating the dynamics of biological evolution. For example, a delivery truck with a number of destination addresses can take a large variety of different routes, but only very few will result in a short driving time.\n\nIn order to use evolutionary optimization, one has to define for every possible [[solution point|solution]] ''s'' to the problem of interest (i.e., every possible route in the case of the delivery truck) how 'good' it is. This is done by introducing a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f(s)'' (scalar valued means that ''f(s)'' is a simple number, such as 0.3, while ''s'' can be a more complicated object, for example a list of destination addresses in the case of the delivery truck), which is called the [[fitness function]].\n\nA high ''f(s)'' implies that ''s'' is a good solution. In the case of the delivery truck, ''f(s)'' could be the number of deliveries per hour on route ''s''. The best, or at least a very good, solution is then found in the following way: initially, a population of random solutions is created. Then, the solutions are mutated and selected for those with higher fitness, until a satisfying solution has been found.\n\nEvolutionary optimization techniques are particularly useful in situations in which it is easy to determine the quality of a single solution, but hard to go through all possible solutions one by one (it is easy to determine the driving time for a particular route of the delivery truck, but it is almost impossible to check all possible routes once the number of destinations grows to more than a handful).\n\nThe concept of a scalar valued fitness function ''f(s)'' also corresponds to the concept of a potential or [[energy function]] in [[physics]]. The two concepts only differ in that [[physicists]] traditionally think in terms of minimizing the potential function, while [[biologists]] prefer the notion that fitness is being maximized. Therefore, taking the inverse of a potential function turns it into a fitness function, and vice versa.\n\n==Caveats and limitations==\nSeveral important caveats exist. Since the human mind struggles to think in greater than three dimensions, 3D topologies can mislead when discussing highly multi-dimensional fitness landscapes.<ref name=pmid21644947>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01236.x |pmid=21644947 |pmc=3668694 |title=Visualizing Fitness Landscapes |journal=Evolution |volume=65 |issue=6 |pages=1544\u201358 |year=2011 |last1=McCandlish |first1=David M }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=George R. |last1=McGhee |year=2006 |title=The Geometry of Evolution: Adaptive Landscapes and Theoretical Morphospaces |url={{Google books|YzzKx81IDLsC|plainurl=yes}} |isbn=978-1-139-45995-2 }}{{pn|date=March 2018}}</ref> In particular it is not clear whether peaks in natural biological fitness landscapes are ever truly separated by fitness valleys in such multidimensional landscapes, or whether they are connected by vastly long neutral ridges.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gavrilets |first=S. |authorlink=Sergey Gavrilets |title=Fitness Landscapes and the Origin of Species |year=2004 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages= |isbn=978-0-691-11983-0 }}{{pn|date=March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10539-008-9116-z |title=The end of the adaptive landscape metaphor? |journal=Biology & Philosophy |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=625\u201338 |year=2008 |last1=Kaplan |first1=Jonathan }}</ref> Additionally, the fitness landscape is not static in time but dependent on the changing environment and evolution of other genes.<ref name=pmid26844293/> It is hence more of a seascape,<ref name=pmid19232770>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2009.01.002 |pmid=19232770 |title=From fitness landscapes to seascapes: Non-equilibrium dynamics of selection and adaptation |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=111\u20139 |year=2009 |last1=Mustonen |first1=Ville |last2=L\u00e4ssig |first2=Michael }}</ref> further affecting how separated adaptive peaks can actually be.

In places the sandstones of the Dox Formation have small folds and convolutions that are indicative of [[Soft-sediment deformation structures|soft sediment deformation]]. In addition, in places, the uppermost {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on}} of the Dox Formation is mildly baked. A thin lava flow occurs within the uppermost part of the Dox Formation. Thus, the contact between the Cardenas Lavas and the Dox Formation is [[conformity|conformable]] and interfingering. This indicates that [[sand]]s were still being deposited when the first lavas erupted and that deposition occurred during the transition from the accumulation of Dox Formation to Cardenas Basalt.<ref name=\"HendricksOthers2003a\"/><ref name=\"LucchittaOthers1983a\"/><ref name=\"TimmonsOthers2012a\">Timmons, JM, J.

Locally, the contact is a low relief erosional surface associated with a thin weathering zone developed in the lavas of the Cardenas Basalt. Along the length of the outcrop of this unconformity, it cuts as much as {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} down into the Cardenas Basalt.

The interbedded sandstones and hyaloclastites provide evidence that these eruptions occurred in wet coastal environments such as [[river delta]]s or [[tidal flats]]. The coarseness of the lapillites in the upper unit indicates that the [[volcanic vents]] from which this material erupted were close to present day outcrops.

On the basis of other geologic criteria, geologists have found that the dates, which range from 700 to 1,000 million years ago, obtained for the age of the Cardenas Basalt and upper age of the Unkar Group were too young and something was clearly perturbing the dating systematics. The current interpretation is that the deposition of the overlying Chuar Group in a marine setting disrupted the potassium-argon (K-Ar) radiometric system. Apparently, fluids associated with the deposition of the Chuar Group have altered the older Cardenas Basalt, partially degraded the minerals, and therefore disrupted the K-Ar systematics. Using newer dating techniques and approaches not available to earlier geologists, the Cardenas Basalt and intrusive sills have been re-dated. New data acquired using newer dating techniques and approaches, indicate that the Cardenas Basalt erupted about 1,104 million years ago.

After being publicly exposed as a [[Marxism|Marxist]] in 1953, Hay stepped down from the Society's leadership, shortly before the other founders were forced to resign by more conservative members. Hay continued his involvement in gay activism, involving himself in the foundation of the Los Angeles branch of the [[Gay Liberation Front]] (GLF) in 1969, before leaving this to move to New Mexico.{{sfn|Timmons|1990}} Walker was from a middle-class Jewish household in [[Hawthorne, California]], and went on to study psychology at [[UCLA]], focusing on Jungian psychology. For his master's thesis at [[Lone Mountain College]] he proposed a gay sex guide containing historical information and psychological reassurance; the concept was rejected by the faculty committee but was subsequently published as ''Men Loving Men: A Gay Sex Guide and Consciousness Book'' (1977). Describing himself as \"a gay shaman\", he was subsequently introduced to Hay in 1976.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=258&ndash;259}}\n\nRaised into an [[Amish-Mennonite]] community, Kilhefner had studied at [[Howard University]] where he joined the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]] and the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]]. After university, he spent time in Ethiopia with the [[Peace Corps]] before joining the [[Peace and Freedom Party]] and becoming a leading figure in the GLF from 1969 to 1971.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=257}} As the GLF evolved into the [[Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center|L.A. Gay Community Services Center]], Kilhefner became its first executive director. As it grew, it sought the support of wealthy gay people to finance its social work and public relations, with Kilhefner being concerned at its increasingly assimilationist stance and taking a leave of absence in 1976. He proceeded to enter into a retreat run by [[Baba Ram Dass]], where he got into an extended conversation with Hay in May 1978.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=258, 260&ndash;261}}\n\nKilhefner stated in 2019 that the Radical Faeries came out of conversations between Harry and him beginning in 1973 about \"the course of the Gay Liberation movement and what was missing.\" He continues that the \"intellectual and spiritual foundation came out of workshops [he] hosted in 1975-1981 called Gay Voices and Visions.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bernadicou |first1=August |title=DON KILHEFNER: THE ORIGINS OF THE RADICAL FAERIES |url=https://www.augustnation.com/radical-faeries |accessdate=10 November 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn Autumn 1978, the therapist [[Betty Berzon]] invited the three men to lead a workshop on \"New Breakthroughs in the Nature of How We Perceive Gay Consciousness\" at the annual conference of the [[Gay Academic Union]], held at the [[University of Southern California]] in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=261}} This event convinced Hay and his partner [[John Burnside (inventor)|John Burnside]] that they should leave their home in [[New Mexico]] and move to Los Angeles, where they settled into a 1920s house on the eastern edge of [[Hollywood]].{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=261, 264}} The three then decided to organise an outdoor conference at which they could teach other gay men about their ideas regarding gay consciousness. Kilhefner identified an ideal location from an advert in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''; the Sri Ram Ashram was a gay-friendly spiritual retreat in the desert near [[Benson, Arizona]], owned by an American named Swami Bill. Hay, Kilhefner, and Burnside visited to check its suitability, and although Hay disliked Bill and didn't want to use the site, Kilhefner insisted.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bernadicou |first1=August |title=DON KILHEFNER: THE ORIGINS OF THE RADICAL FAERIES |url=https://www.augustnation.com/radical-faeries |website=August Nation |publisher=The LGBTQ History Project |accessdate=10 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote=\"It was lovely to see so many people shedding clothes as they shed anxieties and fears and found themselves among friends who thought as they did.

The term \"Radical\" was chosen to reflect both political extremity and the idea of \"root\" or \"essence\", while the term \"Faerie\" was chosen in reference both to the [[fairy|immortal animistic spirits of European folklore]] and to the fact that \"fairy\" had become a pejorative slang term for gay men.{{sfnm|1a1=Timmons|1y=1990|1p=250|2a1=Timmons|2y=2011|2p=33}} Initially, Hay rejected the term \"movement\" when discussing the Radical Faeries, considering it to instead be a \"way of life\" for gay males, and he began referring to it as a \"not-movement\".{{sfnm|1a1=Timmons|1y=1990|1p=250|2a1=Timmons|2y=2011|2p=32}} In organising the event, Hay handled the political issues, Burnside the logistics and mechanics, Kilhefner the budgetary and administrative side, and Walker was to be its spiritual leader.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=264}} A flier, written by Kilhefner,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bernadicou |first1=August |title=DON KILHEFNER: THE ORIGINS OF THE RADICAL FAERIES |url=https://www.augustnation.com/radical-faeries |website=August Nation |publisher=The LGBTQ History Project |accessdate=10 November 2019}}</ref> advertising the event was released and proclaimed that gays had a place in the \"paradigm shift\" of the [[New Age]], and quoted [[Mark Satin]] and [[Aleister Crowley]] alongside Hay; these fliers were sent out to gay and leftist bookstores as well as gay community centres and [[health food store]]s.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=264&ndash;265}}\n\nAround 220 men turned up to the event, despite the fact that the Ashram could only accommodate around 75.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=265}} Hay gave a welcoming speech in which he outlined his ideas regarding [[Subject-SUBJECT consciousness]], calling on those assembled to \"throw off the ugly green frogskin of hetero-imitation to find the shining Faerie prince beneath\".{{Sfn|Timmons|1990|p=265}} Rather than being referred to as \"workshops\", the events that took place were known as \"Faerie circles\",{{Sfn|Timmons|1990|p=265}} and were on such varied subjects as massage, nutrition, local botany, healing energy, the politics of gay enspiritment, [[English country dancing]], and [[auto-fellatio]].{{Sfn|Timmons|1990|p=267}} Those assembled took part in spontaneous rituals, providing invocations to spirits and performing blessings and chants,{{Sfn|Timmons|1990|p=265}} with most participants discarding the majority of their clothes, instead wearing feathers, beads, and bells, and decorating themselves in rainbow makeup.{{Sfn|Timmons|1990|p=266}} Many reported feeling a change of consciousness during the event, which one person there described as \"a four day [[LSD|acid]] trip &ndash; without the acid!\".{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=266&ndash;267}} On the final night of the gathering, they put together a performance of the [[Symmetricon]], an invention of Burnside's, while Hay gave a farewell speech.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=268}}\n\n===Growth, friction, and split: 1979&ndash;80===\n[[File:Harry Hay (1929106169).jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Faerie gathering in 1986, with Hay in bottom left corner]]\nAfter Hay and the others returned to Los Angeles, they received messages of thanks from various participants, many of whom asked when the next Faerie gathering would be.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=268&ndash;269}} Hay decided to found a Faerie circle in Los Angeles that met at their house, which became known as \"Faerie Central\", devoting half their time to serious discussion and the other half to recreation, in particular English circle dancing. As more joined the circle, they began meeting in [[West Hollywood]]'s First Presbyterian Church and then the olive grove atop the hill at [[Barnsdall Park]]; however they found it difficult to gain the same change of consciousness that had been present at the rural gathering.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=269}} The group began to discuss what the Faerie movement was developing into; Hay encouraged them to embark on political activism, using Marxism and his Subject-SUBJECT consciousness theory as a framework for bringing about societal change. Others however wanted the movement to focus on spirituality and exploring the [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]], lambasting politics as part of \"the straight world\".{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=269&ndash;270}} Another issue of contention was over what constituted a \"Faery\"; Hay had an idealized image of what someone with \"gay consciousness\" thought and acted like, and turned away some prospective members of the Circle because he disagreed with their views. One prospective member, the gay theatre director John Callaghan, joined the circle in February 1980, but was soon ejected by Hay after he voiced concern about hostility toward heterosexuals among the group.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=270&ndash;271}}\n\nThe second Faerie gathering took place in August 1980 in [[Estes Park, Colorado|Estes Park]] near [[Boulder, Colorado]]. Twice as long and almost twice as large as the first, it became known as Faery Woodstock.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=272&ndash;273}} It also exhibited an increasing influence from the U.S. Pagan movement, as Faeries incorporated elements from Evans' ''Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture'' and [[Starhawk]]'s ''[[The Spiral Dance]]'' into their practices.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=272}}  At that gathering, Dennis Melba'son presented a shawl that he had created with a crocheted depiction of the Northwest European Iron Age deity [[Cernunnos]] on it; the shawl became an important symbol of the Faeries, and would be sent from gathering to gathering over subsequent decades.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=273}} There, Hay publicly revealed the founding trio's desire for the creation of a permanent residential Faerie community, where they could grow their own crops and thus live self-sustainably. This project would involve setting up a non-profit corporation to purchase property under a community land trust with tax-exempt status. They were partly inspired by a pre-existing gay collective in rural Tennessee, Short Mountain.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=273&ndash;275}} The gathering was also attended by an increasing number of men from outside of America, particularly Canada, but also from Australia, Norway, France and Germany, many of whom returned to their countries of origin to establish Faerie communes, such as the Wellington Boot, Common Ground etc. in Australia.\n\n[[File:Radical Faeries 2010 London Pride.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Radical Faeries with banner at 2010 London Gay Pride]]\nThere was some antagonism between Hay and Walker from the beginning of their venture, in part stemming from personality differences. It was made worse by their differing approaches to Jungian psychology; Walker saw analytical psychology as central to his world view and believed that it could be utilised to aid the gay movement, whereas Hay was disdainful of it.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=262&ndash;263}} As the Los Angeles Circle grew, Kilhefner also became annoyed with Hay over the latter's tendency to dominate conversations both in and out of the Circle, as well as his proselytizing attitude.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=271}} In 1980 Walker secretly formed the \"Faerie Fascist Police\" to combat \"Faerie fascism\" and \"power-tripping\" within the Faeries. He specifically targeted Hay: \"I recruited people to spy on Harry and see when he was manipulating people, so we could undo his undermining of the scene.\"{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=275}}\n\nAt a winter 1980 gathering in southern Oregon designed to discuss acquiring land for a Faerie sanctuary, a newcomer to the group, coached by Walker, confronted Harry about the power dynamics within the core circle. In the ensuing conflict, the core circle splintered. Plans for the land sanctuary stalled and a separate circle formed.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=277\u201378}} The core circle made an attempt to reconcile, but at a meeting that came to be known as \"Bloody Sunday\", Kilhefner quit, accusing Hay and Burnside of \"power tripping\", while Walker resigned.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=282\u201383}} Walker and Kilhefner formed a new Los Angeles-based gay spiritual group called Treeroots which promoted a form of rural gay consciousness associated with Jungian psychology and [[ceremonial magic]].{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=284}} However, despite the division among its founders, the Radical Faerie movement continued to grow, largely as a result of its egalitarian structure, with many participants being unaware of the squabbles.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=285}} Hay himself continued to be welcomed at gatherings, coming to be seen as an [[wikt:statesman|elder statesman]] in the movement.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=288}}\n\n===Continued growth: 1981&ndash;present===\n[[File:Folleterre Faerie Sanctuary.jpeg|thumb|right|The Folleterre Faerie Sanctuary in France]]\nThe first Faerie gathering in Australia was held in January 1981, at Tony Newman's Whole Earth Dream Farm near Ourimbah (established in 1974), inspired by the reporting of the second Faerie gathering in Colorado by RFD, and held in conjunction with Sydney's Gay Men's Rap, although this first gathering did not generate any ongoing Faerie activity. A subsequent and unconnected Faerie gathering was held on 9\u201312 April 1982, at Mandala, a gay spiritual commune established near Uki in Northern NSW in 1974 by David Johnstone. This second gathering included Faeries who had attended the second and third gatherings in the United States, and led to continued growth of the Radical Faeries in Australia, and repeated attempts to establish Faerie communes, such as Common Ground (Clarence River Valley), and eventually the ongoing commune Faerieland, near Nimbin, NSW.\n\nGuided by Mica Kindman, Lloyd Fair, Cass Brayton, and Will Roscoe, the San Francisco Faerie Circle had formed a non-profit corporation under the name of NOMENUS (varyingly interpreted as \"No Men Us\", \"No Menace\", and \"No Menus\"), supported by Hay. They raised enough money to put a down payment on some land from a 1983 gathering in [[Napa County, California|Napa]], however decided against forming a self-sufficient community, instead choosing to purchase a smaller piece of land that could be stationed by a few caretakers and which could house regular gatherings.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=288&ndash;289}} In 1987 they purchased Magdalene Farm &ndash; an 80-acre property near [[Grant's Pass, Oregon]] &ndash; from George Jalbert, who has unsuccessfully hoped to establish his own rural gay commune there over the preceding decade.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=290}}\n\nThroughout the 1980s the Radical Faerie movement had spread out from the United States and had gatherings in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Italy,{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=250}} as well as Folleterre in France.\n\n[[Black Leather Wings]] is an organization for spiritual gay [[Leather subculture|leather folk]] affiliated with the Radical Faeries.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dusk Peterson |url=http://duskpeterson.com/leatherculture/spirituality/organizations.htm |title=Transcend &#124; Leather Spirituality Organizations |publisher=Duskpeterson.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-23}}</ref> The [[San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley]] includes bronze boot prints that honor 28 people important to the local leather communities, including [[Mark Thompson (author)|Mark Thompson]], a co-founder of Black Leather Wings, and Alexis Sorel, a Black Leather Wings member.<ref name=\"artandarchitecture-sf1\">[http://www.artandarchitecture-sf.com/ringold-alleys-leather-memoir.html Ringold Alley ''Leather Memoir'']</ref><ref name=\"Jewish\">{{cite web|last=Paull |first=Laura |url=https://www.jweekly.com/2018/06/21/honoring-gay-leather-culture-with-art-installation-in-soma-alleyway/ |title=Honoring gay leather culture with art installation in SoMa alleyway \u2013 J |publisher=Jweekly.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-23}}</ref>\n\n==Sanctuaries and gatherings==\n[[File:The Mayday Kiss.jpg|thumb|The Kiss - 2003]]\n\nRural land or urban buildings where Faeries come together to live a communal life are called '''sanctuaries''',<ref name=OIPRLG>Morgensen, Scott. 2009. \"Back and Forth to the Land: Negotiating Rural and Urban Sexuality Among the Radical Faeries.\" In Ellen Lewin and William L.

After being publicly exposed as a [[Marxism|Marxist]] in 1953, Hay stepped down from the Society's leadership, shortly before the other founders were forced to resign by more conservative members. Hay continued his involvement in gay activism, involving himself in the foundation of the Los Angeles branch of the [[Gay Liberation Front]] (GLF) in 1969, before leaving this to move to New Mexico.{{sfn|Timmons|1990}} Walker was from a middle-class Jewish household in [[Hawthorne, California]], and went on to study psychology at [[UCLA]], focusing on Jungian psychology. For his master's thesis at [[Lone Mountain College]] he proposed a gay sex guide containing historical information and psychological reassurance; the concept was rejected by the faculty committee but was subsequently published as ''Men Loving Men: A Gay Sex Guide and Consciousness Book'' (1977). Describing himself as \"a gay shaman\", he was subsequently introduced to Hay in 1976.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=258&ndash;259}}\n\nRaised into an [[Amish-Mennonite]] community, Kilhefner had studied at [[Howard University]] where he joined the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]] and the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]]. After university, he spent time in Ethiopia with the [[Peace Corps]] before joining the [[Peace and Freedom Party]] and becoming a leading figure in the GLF from 1969 to 1971.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=257}} As the GLF evolved into the [[Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center|L.A. Gay Community Services Center]], Kilhefner became its first executive director. As it grew, it sought the support of wealthy gay people to finance its social work and public relations, with Kilhefner being concerned at its increasingly assimilationist stance and taking a leave of absence in 1976. He proceeded to enter into a retreat run by [[Baba Ram Dass]], where he got into an extended conversation with Hay in May 1978.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=258, 260&ndash;261}}\n\nKilhefner stated in 2019 that the Radical Faeries came out of conversations between Harry and him beginning in 1973 about \"the course of the Gay Liberation movement and what was missing.\" He continues that the \"intellectual and spiritual foundation came out of workshops [he] hosted in 1975-1981 called Gay Voices and Visions.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bernadicou |first1=August |title=DON KILHEFNER: THE ORIGINS OF THE RADICAL FAERIES |url=https://www.augustnation.com/radical-faeries |accessdate=10 November 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn Autumn 1978, the therapist [[Betty Berzon]] invited the three men to lead a workshop on \"New Breakthroughs in the Nature of How We Perceive Gay Consciousness\" at the annual conference of the [[Gay Academic Union]], held at the [[University of Southern California]] in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=261}} This event convinced Hay and his partner [[John Burnside (inventor)|John Burnside]] that they should leave their home in [[New Mexico]] and move to Los Angeles, where they settled into a 1920s house on the eastern edge of [[Hollywood]].{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=261, 264}} The three then decided to organise an outdoor conference at which they could teach other gay men about their ideas regarding gay consciousness. Kilhefner identified an ideal location from an advert in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''; the Sri Ram Ashram was a gay-friendly spiritual retreat in the desert near [[Benson, Arizona]], owned by an American named Swami Bill. Hay, Kilhefner, and Burnside visited to check its suitability, and although Hay disliked Bill and didn't want to use the site, Kilhefner insisted.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bernadicou |first1=August |title=DON KILHEFNER: THE ORIGINS OF THE RADICAL FAERIES |url=https://www.augustnation.com/radical-faeries |website=August Nation |publisher=The LGBTQ History Project |accessdate=10 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote=\"It was lovely to see so many people shedding clothes as they shed anxieties and fears and found themselves among friends who thought as they did.

The term \"Radical\" was chosen to reflect both political extremity and the idea of \"root\" or \"essence\", while the term \"Faerie\" was chosen in reference both to the [[fairy|immortal animistic spirits of European folklore]] and to the fact that \"fairy\" had become a pejorative slang term for gay men.{{sfnm|1a1=Timmons|1y=1990|1p=250|2a1=Timmons|2y=2011|2p=33}} Initially, Hay rejected the term \"movement\" when discussing the Radical Faeries, considering it to instead be a \"way of life\" for gay males, and he began referring to it as a \"not-movement\".{{sfnm|1a1=Timmons|1y=1990|1p=250|2a1=Timmons|2y=2011|2p=32}} In organising the event, Hay handled the political issues, Burnside the logistics and mechanics, Kilhefner the budgetary and administrative side, and Walker was to be its spiritual leader.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=264}} A flier, written by Kilhefner,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bernadicou |first1=August |title=DON KILHEFNER: THE ORIGINS OF THE RADICAL FAERIES |url=https://www.augustnation.com/radical-faeries |website=August Nation |publisher=The LGBTQ History Project |accessdate=10 November 2019}}</ref> advertising the event was released and proclaimed that gays had a place in the \"paradigm shift\" of the [[New Age]], and quoted [[Mark Satin]] and [[Aleister Crowley]] alongside Hay; these fliers were sent out to gay and leftist bookstores as well as gay community centres and [[health food store]]s.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=264&ndash;265}}\n\nAround 220 men turned up to the event, despite the fact that the Ashram could only accommodate around 75.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=265}} Hay gave a welcoming speech in which he outlined his ideas regarding [[Subject-SUBJECT consciousness]], calling on those assembled to \"throw off the ugly green frogskin of hetero-imitation to find the shining Faerie prince beneath\".{{Sfn|Timmons|1990|p=265}} Rather than being referred to as \"workshops\", the events that took place were known as \"Faerie circles\",{{Sfn|Timmons|1990|p=265}} and were on such varied subjects as massage, nutrition, local botany, healing energy, the politics of gay enspiritment, [[English country dancing]], and [[auto-fellatio]].{{Sfn|Timmons|1990|p=267}} Those assembled took part in spontaneous rituals, providing invocations to spirits and performing blessings and chants,{{Sfn|Timmons|1990|p=265}} with most participants discarding the majority of their clothes, instead wearing feathers, beads, and bells, and decorating themselves in rainbow makeup.{{Sfn|Timmons|1990|p=266}} Many reported feeling a change of consciousness during the event, which one person there described as \"a four day [[LSD|acid]] trip &ndash; without the acid!\".{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=266&ndash;267}} On the final night of the gathering, they put together a performance of the [[Symmetricon]], an invention of Burnside's, while Hay gave a farewell speech.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=268}}\n\n===Growth, friction, and split: 1979&ndash;80===\n[[File:Harry Hay (1929106169).jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Faerie gathering in 1986, with Hay in bottom left corner]]\nAfter Hay and the others returned to Los Angeles, they received messages of thanks from various participants, many of whom asked when the next Faerie gathering would be.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=268&ndash;269}} Hay decided to found a Faerie circle in Los Angeles that met at their house, which became known as \"Faerie Central\", devoting half their time to serious discussion and the other half to recreation, in particular English circle dancing. As more joined the circle, they began meeting in [[West Hollywood]]'s First Presbyterian Church and then the olive grove atop the hill at [[Barnsdall Park]]; however they found it difficult to gain the same change of consciousness that had been present at the rural gathering.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=269}} The group began to discuss what the Faerie movement was developing into; Hay encouraged them to embark on political activism, using Marxism and his Subject-SUBJECT consciousness theory as a framework for bringing about societal change. Others however wanted the movement to focus on spirituality and exploring the [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]], lambasting politics as part of \"the straight world\".{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=269&ndash;270}} Another issue of contention was over what constituted a \"Faery\"; Hay had an idealized image of what someone with \"gay consciousness\" thought and acted like, and turned away some prospective members of the Circle because he disagreed with their views. One prospective member, the gay theatre director John Callaghan, joined the circle in February 1980, but was soon ejected by Hay after he voiced concern about hostility toward heterosexuals among the group.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=270&ndash;271}}\n\nThe second Faerie gathering took place in August 1980 in [[Estes Park, Colorado|Estes Park]] near [[Boulder, Colorado]]. Twice as long and almost twice as large as the first, it became known as Faery Woodstock.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=272&ndash;273}} It also exhibited an increasing influence from the U.S. Pagan movement, as Faeries incorporated elements from Evans' ''Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture'' and [[Starhawk]]'s ''[[The Spiral Dance]]'' into their practices.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=272}}  At that gathering, Dennis Melba'son presented a shawl that he had created with a crocheted depiction of the Northwest European Iron Age deity [[Cernunnos]] on it; the shawl became an important symbol of the Faeries, and would be sent from gathering to gathering over subsequent decades.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=273}} There, Hay publicly revealed the founding trio's desire for the creation of a permanent residential Faerie community, where they could grow their own crops and thus live self-sustainably. This project would involve setting up a non-profit corporation to purchase property under a community land trust with tax-exempt status. They were partly inspired by a pre-existing gay collective in rural Tennessee, Short Mountain.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=273&ndash;275}} The gathering was also attended by an increasing number of men from outside of America, particularly Canada, but also from Australia, Norway, France and Germany, many of whom returned to their countries of origin to establish Faerie communes, such as the Wellington Boot, Common Ground etc. in Australia.\n\n[[File:Radical Faeries 2010 London Pride.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Radical Faeries with banner at 2010 London Gay Pride]]\nThere was some antagonism between Hay and Walker from the beginning of their venture, in part stemming from personality differences. It was made worse by their differing approaches to Jungian psychology; Walker saw analytical psychology as central to his world view and believed that it could be utilised to aid the gay movement, whereas Hay was disdainful of it.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=262&ndash;263}} As the Los Angeles Circle grew, Kilhefner also became annoyed with Hay over the latter's tendency to dominate conversations both in and out of the Circle, as well as his proselytizing attitude.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=271}} In 1980 Walker secretly formed the \"Faerie Fascist Police\" to combat \"Faerie fascism\" and \"power-tripping\" within the Faeries. He specifically targeted Hay: \"I recruited people to spy on Harry and see when he was manipulating people, so we could undo his undermining of the scene.\"{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=275}}\n\nAt a winter 1980 gathering in southern Oregon designed to discuss acquiring land for a Faerie sanctuary, a newcomer to the group, coached by Walker, confronted Harry about the power dynamics within the core circle. In the ensuing conflict, the core circle splintered. Plans for the land sanctuary stalled and a separate circle formed.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=277\u201378}} The core circle made an attempt to reconcile, but at a meeting that came to be known as \"Bloody Sunday\", Kilhefner quit, accusing Hay and Burnside of \"power tripping\", while Walker resigned.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=282\u201383}} Walker and Kilhefner formed a new Los Angeles-based gay spiritual group called Treeroots which promoted a form of rural gay consciousness associated with Jungian psychology and [[ceremonial magic]].{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=284}} However, despite the division among its founders, the Radical Faerie movement continued to grow, largely as a result of its egalitarian structure, with many participants being unaware of the squabbles.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=285}} Hay himself continued to be welcomed at gatherings, coming to be seen as an [[wikt:statesman|elder statesman]] in the movement.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=288}}\n\n===Continued growth: 1981&ndash;present===\n[[File:Folleterre Faerie Sanctuary.jpeg|thumb|right|The Folleterre Faerie Sanctuary in France]]\nThe first Faerie gathering in Australia was held in January 1981, at Tony Newman's Whole Earth Dream Farm near Ourimbah (established in 1974), inspired by the reporting of the second Faerie gathering in Colorado by RFD, and held in conjunction with Sydney's Gay Men's Rap, although this first gathering did not generate any ongoing Faerie activity. A subsequent and unconnected Faerie gathering was held on 9\u201312 April 1982, at Mandala, a gay spiritual commune established near Uki in Northern NSW in 1974 by David Johnstone. This second gathering included Faeries who had attended the second and third gatherings in the United States, and led to continued growth of the Radical Faeries in Australia, and repeated attempts to establish Faerie communes, such as Common Ground (Clarence River Valley), and eventually the ongoing commune Faerieland, near Nimbin, NSW.\n\nGuided by Mica Kindman, Lloyd Fair, Cass Brayton, and Will Roscoe, the San Francisco Faerie Circle had formed a non-profit corporation under the name of NOMENUS (varyingly interpreted as \"No Men Us\", \"No Menace\", and \"No Menus\"), supported by Hay. They raised enough money to put a down payment on some land from a 1983 gathering in [[Napa County, California|Napa]], however decided against forming a self-sufficient community, instead choosing to purchase a smaller piece of land that could be stationed by a few caretakers and which could house regular gatherings.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=288&ndash;289}} In 1987 they purchased Magdalene Farm &ndash; an 80-acre property near [[Grant's Pass, Oregon]] &ndash; from George Jalbert, who has unsuccessfully hoped to establish his own rural gay commune there over the preceding decade.{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=290}}\n\nThroughout the 1980s the Radical Faerie movement had spread out from the United States and had gatherings in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Italy,{{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=250}} as well as Folleterre in France.\n\n[[Black Leather Wings]] is an organization for spiritual gay [[Leather subculture|leather folk]] affiliated with the Radical Faeries.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dusk Peterson |url=http://duskpeterson.com/leatherculture/spirituality/organizations.htm |title=Transcend &#124; Leather Spirituality Organizations |publisher=Duskpeterson.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-23}}</ref> The [[San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley]] includes bronze boot prints that honor 28 people important to the local leather communities, including [[Mark Thompson (author)|Mark Thompson]], a co-founder of Black Leather Wings, and Alexis Sorel, a Black Leather Wings member.<ref name=\"artandarchitecture-sf1\">[http://www.artandarchitecture-sf.com/ringold-alleys-leather-memoir.html Ringold Alley ''Leather Memoir'']</ref><ref name=\"Jewish\">{{cite web|last=Paull |first=Laura |url=https://www.jweekly.com/2018/06/21/honoring-gay-leather-culture-with-art-installation-in-soma-alleyway/ |title=Honoring gay leather culture with art installation in SoMa alleyway \u2013 J |publisher=Jweekly.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-23}}</ref>\n\n==Sanctuaries and gatherings==\n[[File:The Mayday Kiss.jpg|thumb|The Kiss - 2003]]\n\nRural land or urban buildings where Faeries come together to live a communal life are called '''sanctuaries''',<ref name=OIPRLG>Morgensen, Scott. 2009. \"Back and Forth to the Land: Negotiating Rural and Urban Sexuality Among the Radical Faeries.\" In Ellen Lewin and William L.

He was born on September 2, 1875, in Nagyberezna (Velikij Bereznij, [[Ukraine]]), as the son of the [[Roman Catholic]] Ferdinand Both. At that time, the settlement had mixed national and religious population, with a majority of Rusine and German inhabitants. Ferdinand, the father of Antal Both, set up a pharmacy in this town. In 1885, when Antal was 10 years old, his parents enrolled him in the [[Piarist]] grammar school in Nagyk\u00e1roly (today Carei, Romania). Since this school did not have the right to run 7th and 8th-grade classes, he went to study to the [[Roman Catholic]] grammar school in Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti (Satu Mare, Romania). He graduated from there in 1893.\n\nAfter his matura examinations, he stayed in Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti and had schooling in the diocesan seminary of Szatm\u00e1r.

He regularly organized series of educational lectures, which he himself attended and occasionally commented, presenting his special religious and Christian social views. He organized and edited a local journal under title of Magyar T\u00e1rsadalom (Hungarian Society), which provided him with publication opportunities. The first edition of the periodical appeared in 1914, and after a longer pause was restarted in 1926, but despite his efforts, it remained a local paper.

He instructed them with the pedagogical force of example by accompanying the students to church every Sunday and feast day.

Until his death he was working to create a comprehensive dictionary of the six languages he spoke.  He also had an extensive contact network via letter discussions with the Vatican (Latin), the Russian Orthodox Pope (Russian), the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese (Greek), and in Hebrew with the various Rabbis of the Hungarian Rabbinical Schools. Some of the manuscripts were taken from Hungary in 1945. Probably Antal Both himself handed them over to his daughter and her husband when they were leaving for the United States, to cover their living expenses by publishing them in case of financial need.<ref>Szabadi: Both Antal (1878\u20131963), p. 119.

Jeopardizing his  and his family's life, he hid three Jewish boys in his press house and saved them from certain death.  Although he held the Jews responsible for the coming apocalyptic end-time, he hoped for their collective conversion that would usher in the age of Salvation. He was also convinced that God endowed the Hungarian nation with a distinctive role in this process. Szabadi sees in this mentality the reason for Antal Both's openness to other religious denominations and for his insistence on promoting the mission among Russians and Jews.<ref>Szabadi: Both Antal (1878\u20131963), p. 120.</ref> For him, the church hierarchy was fallen and priests could not achieve the unity between denominations and nations. This task could only be accomplished by the \u201csecular order\u201d, the common priesthood of lay believers. His thoughts significantly diverged from biblical teachings and the tenets of Christian churches in other areas, too. According to J\u00f3zsef Tak\u00e1cs, \u201chis spirituality was noticeably influenced, besides Catholicism, by symbolism, the social movements between the two World Wars, and by the writings of a Rabbi from Rimaszombat (Rimavska Sobot\u00e1, Slovakia) as well as by contemporary political events such as World War 2, which broke out in 1939, the Prime Ministerial order forcing the Jews to wear discriminating marks in 1944, the beginnings of the communist regime in 1948, and the Cold War. [\u2026] Antal Both had original concepts, views and ideas, but these do not elevate him to the level of the middlebrow theologians and philosophers of the first half of the 20th century.\u201d<ref>Tak\u00e1cs J\u00f3zsef: Szakv\u00e9lem\u00e9ny Both Antal irodalmi hagyat\u00e9k\u00e1r\u00f3l (unpublished manuscript, prepared at the request of the Antal Both Cultural and Theological Foundations, Debrecen, Sep 30, 2017), cited by Szabadi: Both Antal (1878\u20131963), p. 121.</ref> \u00c9va Elekes summarizes her opinion about Antal Both as follows: \u201cEven if the Teacher was a bit \u2018eccentric\u2019 and \u2018dreaming\u2019, his life was effective, busy and extraordinary.

He was born on September 2, 1875, in Nagyberezna (Velikij Bereznij, [[Ukraine]]), as the son of the [[Roman Catholic]] Ferdinand Both. At that time, the settlement had mixed national and religious population, with a majority of Rusine and German inhabitants. Ferdinand, the father of Antal Both, set up a pharmacy in this town. In 1885, when Antal was 10 years old, his parents enrolled him in the [[Piarist]] grammar school in Nagyk\u00e1roly (today Carei, Romania). Since this school did not have the right to run 7th and 8th-grade classes, he went to study to the [[Roman Catholic]] grammar school in Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti (Satu Mare, Romania). He graduated from there in 1893.\n\nAfter his matura examinations, he stayed in Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti and had schooling in the diocesan seminary of Szatm\u00e1r.

Similarly to some 60 other schools of this type nationwide, it served the education of graduated apprentices and journeymen who stood before their military training.<ref>It had Hungarian Grammar, Geography, History, Mathematics, Nature Sciences, Hygienics and Geometry in its curriculum. See Mayer: Munk\u00e1sgimn\u00e1ziumok (digital print).</ref> Antal Both was in military service during World War I. In 1918, he was honorably discharged as a territorial lieutenant, and he was honored with the Signum Laudis award for his service. He was an active participant and organizer of the uprising in Balassagyarmat (\u201cthe chasing away of the Bohemians\u201d), which happened at the end of January 1919.<ref>Barth\u00f3\u2013Tyekvicska: A balassagyarmati \u201ecsehkiver\u00e9s\u201d, p. 186.</ref> He was on furlough at the time of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, and, according to some sources, he spent the time on studying vocational schools. Afterwards, \u201cin the whole year of 1920 he was granted leave by the Board of Education and Religion with a full stipend.\u201d<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nAfter 1920, he spent 15 highly active years in Balassagyarmat until his retirement. In addition to lecturing on his favorite subjects, Latin and Greek, he founded the Clerical Society and the local body of the Turan Assembly. He regularly organized series of educational lectures, which he himself attended and occasionally commented, presenting his special religious and Christian social views. He organized and edited a local journal under title of Magyar T\u00e1rsadalom (Hungarian Society), which provided him with publication opportunities. The first edition of the periodical appeared in 1914, and after a longer pause was restarted in 1926, but despite his efforts, it remained a local paper. He actively participated in the work of the Hungarian Society for Social Sciences, the Catholic Young Men's Club and the Mad\u00e1ch Society. He was also an elected official of the latter.<ref>Szabadi: Both Antal (1878\u20131963), p. 118.</ref>\n\nAs a teacher, he was committed to modern pedagogical methods, and he emphasized the moral education of youth. His responsibility for his students urged him as inventor to patent his school-backpack and the \u201caerating shoes\u201d, a forerunner of modern sports shoes, the self-wring floor mop (forerunner of the twist wonder mop), and the fade away ink (forerunner of the invisible ink). Despite his rigor, he was a popular teacher. His students looked up to him and remembered him with affection even after decades.<ref>Elekes: Both Antal, pp. 99\u2013101.</ref>\n\nHe retired in 1936, at the age of 61. His colleague, K\u00e1roly Blazsik wrote his valedictory for the school's bulletin. He emphasized Both's admiration for classical languages, his work for public instruction, his labor as an adult educator, and also that \u201che was for is students a teacher not in a bureaucratic sense but like a nurturer and loving father. He instructed them with the pedagogical force of example by accompanying the students to church every Sunday and feast day. He also attended the weekday services, where he kneeled, prayed and took holy communion with exemplary devotion. This is how he cultivated a disposition of a good person, a good teacher and a good father.\u201d<ref>A Bgy-i M. Kir. \u00c1ll.

The documents are available on the Foundation\u2019s homepage. See http://bothantal.hu/579-2/.</ref> From the last 15 years of his life, no manuscripts exist. Until his death he was working to create a comprehensive dictionary of the six languages he spoke.  He also had an extensive contact network via letter discussions with the Vatican (Latin), the Russian Orthodox Pope (Russian), the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese (Greek), and in Hebrew with the various Rabbis of the Hungarian Rabbinical Schools. Some of the manuscripts were taken from Hungary in 1945. Probably Antal Both himself handed them over to his daughter and her husband when they were leaving for the United States, to cover their living expenses by publishing them in case of financial need.<ref>Szabadi: Both Antal (1878\u20131963), p. 119. From his dated manuscripts the Rusz miszt\u00e9riuma (\u201eMistery of Rus\u201d) is the latest, and both the Hungarian and the Russian(!) versions are dated to 1958.</ref> Although the translation of one of his works into English was completed, it has never been published. Antal Both's other documents and his miscellaneous, mainly personal literary remains continue to be kept in Balassagyarmat.<ref>To be found in: Mad\u00e1ch Imre K\u00f6nyvt\u00e1r Helyt\u00f6rt\u00e9neti Gy\u0171jtem\u00e9nye, Helyt\u00f6rt\u00e9neti Gy\u0171jtem\u00e9ny, MNL N\u00f3gr\u00e1d Megyei Lev\u00e9lt\u00e1r\u00e1nak Fi\u00f3klev\u00e9lt\u00e1ra.</ref>\n\nAntal Both's thinking is characterized by mysticism, historical-theological reflection, prophetic self-definition, a na\u00efve and peculiar mingling of distinct ideologies and at the same time by a desire for insight, a strong sense of social responsibility, and a deep commitment to nation and humanity. Jeopardizing his  and his family's life, he hid three Jewish boys in his press house and saved them from certain death.  Although he held the Jews responsible for the coming apocalyptic end-time, he hoped for their collective conversion that would usher in the age of Salvation. He was also convinced that God endowed the Hungarian nation with a distinctive role in this process. Szabadi sees in this mentality the reason for Antal Both's openness to other religious denominations and for his insistence on promoting the mission among Russians and Jews.<ref>Szabadi: Both Antal (1878\u20131963), p. 120.</ref> For him, the church hierarchy was fallen and priests could not achieve the unity between denominations and nations. This task could only be accomplished by the \u201csecular order\u201d, the common priesthood of lay believers. His thoughts significantly diverged from biblical teachings and the tenets of Christian churches in other areas, too. According to J\u00f3zsef Tak\u00e1cs, \u201chis spirituality was noticeably influenced, besides Catholicism, by symbolism, the social movements between the two World Wars, and by the writings of a Rabbi from Rimaszombat (Rimavska Sobot\u00e1, Slovakia) as well as by contemporary political events such as World War 2, which broke out in 1939, the Prime Ministerial order forcing the Jews to wear discriminating marks in 1944, the beginnings of the communist regime in 1948, and the Cold War. [\u2026] Antal Both had original concepts, views and ideas, but these do not elevate him to the level of the middlebrow theologians and philosophers of the first half of the 20th century.\u201d<ref>Tak\u00e1cs J\u00f3zsef: Szakv\u00e9lem\u00e9ny Both Antal irodalmi hagyat\u00e9k\u00e1r\u00f3l (unpublished manuscript, prepared at the request of the Antal Both Cultural and Theological Foundations, Debrecen, Sep 30, 2017), cited by Szabadi: Both Antal (1878\u20131963), p. 121.</ref> \u00c9va Elekes summarizes her opinion about Antal Both as follows: \u201cEven if the Teacher was a bit \u2018eccentric\u2019 and \u2018dreaming\u2019, his life was effective, busy and extraordinary.

The Foundation has its seat in [[Debrecen]], at the Reformed College of Debrecen.

Following her death, the appointed trustees of the Foundation, who had formerly come into contact with the [[Reformed]] College of Debrecen in connection with another trust, found that Marianne Bodn\u00e1r\u2019s original intentions can be best achieved through the [[Debrecen]] Reformed College and its member institution, the Reformed Theological University of Debrecen. Consequently, they initiated the establishment of a new, [[Hungary|Hungarian]] foundation as a legal successor of the \u201cLiving Trust\u201d at the Tisz\u00e1nt\u00fal Reformed Diocese.<ref>Kust\u00e1r: A Debreceni Reform\u00e1tus Koll\u00e9gium leg\u00fajabb alap\u00edtv\u00e1nya, p. 112.</ref> The Board of Directors of the Diocese and of the College decided in favor of the request, and registered the trust as \u201cAntal Both Theological and Cultural Foundation\u201d in 2016. \n\nThe main objective of the foundation is to cultivate the memory and the intellectual and cultural heritage of Antal Both as well as to support other scholarly and cultural activities that serve ecumenical dialogue, especially between the [[Roman Catholic]] and the [[Protestant Church]]es, in order to deepen and reinforce their mutual understanding, and to create opportunities for joint ministry and witness.<ref>http://bothantal.hu/the-mission-of-the-foundation/</ref> In accordance with these objectives, the Board of Trustees offers grants that assist research projects related to Denominational Studies, support cultural events with ecumenical aspects as well as school programs and the publication of books. The Foundation grants the \u201cPor Unitate in Christo\u201d Award, established by the Foundation, to those who preeminently foster ecumenical dialogue. It also sponsors publication and research projects in the field of Denominational Studies.

Dietrich (Chrysler, Lincoln, Checker)<ref name=\"Gibson Thunder Bird IV\"/> along with the [[Gibson Firebird|Firebird]] guitar, which it resembles in design, construction, and name.\n\n==Design and construction==\n[[Image:Josh Reedy Decemberadio.jpg|thumb|250px|Josh Reedy of [[DecembeRadio]] playing a custom Gibson Thunderbird onstage.]]\n\nThe Thunderbird bass, like the [[Rickenbacker#Basses|Rickenbacker 4000 series]] and the Firebird guitar designed concurrently, had [[neck-through]] construction: the neck wood runs the entire length of the body, with the rest of the body glued into place, although some cheaper [[Epiphone]] models feature a more conventional bolt-on neck construction.\n\nWhile previous Gibson bass guitars had a short scale of 30\u00bd\",   the Thunderbird had a 34\" scale equal to that of the 34\" scale of Fender's bass guitars.\n\nThere were originally two Thunderbird models, the Thunderbird II (one pickup) and Thunderbird IV (two pickups) The Thunderbird generally features bass humbuckers, colloquially referred to as \"soapbars\" due to their oblong shape.\n\n===Non-reverse Thunderbirds===\nIn 1966, Gibson changed the Thunderbird's design and construction. The original Thunderbirds (and Firebirds) had a \"reverse\" body, with the treble horn extended and the bass horn recessed. Due to a lawsuit brought by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] because of the resemblance to the [[Fender Jazzmaster]], the body styles were modified, with the result being called the \"non-reverse\" body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibsonbass.com/thunderbird66.php |title=1966 Gibson Thunderbird bass |publisher=Gibsonbass.com |date=1965-06-22 |accessdate=2009-11-09}}</ref> Also, the expensive neck-through construction was replaced by traditional Gibson set-neck construction. The non-reverse Thunderbird was continued until 1969, when the Thunderbird was discontinued. Though fewer non-reverse Thunderbirds were shipped, the original reverse-body instruments retain a higher collector's value. Gibson started producing the non-reverse Thunderbirds again for the public in late 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/Bass/Gibson-USA/Thunderbird-Non-Reverse-Bass.aspx |title=Gibson Thunderbird Non-Reverse Bass|publisher=[[Gibson Guitar Corporation]]  |accessdate=2013-01-10}}</ref>\n\n==1976-79 reissue==\nThe Thunderbird IV was reissued in 1976 as a bicentennial edition. This reissue featured the original body shape and neck-through construction but unlike the previous issues, the bicentennial edition included the new \"3-point\" bridge and a red, white, and blue thunderbird logo. The bass was offered in tobacco burst, ebony, white, or natural finish. After the bicentennial, the Thunderbird was continued as a regular production model until 1979, when it was discontinued once again.\n\n==Current and recent Thunderbird models==\nThe Thunderbird IV was re-introduced to the Gibson line in 1987 and was in regular production until 2015.\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Gibson_thunderbird_IV_bass.JPG|right]] -->\n\nThe most recent official Thunderbirds produced by Gibson Guitar Corporation:\n''(Most, if not all, of the following links are broken.

Dietrich (Chrysler, Lincoln, Checker)<ref name=\"Gibson Thunder Bird IV\"/> along with the [[Gibson Firebird|Firebird]] guitar, which it resembles in design, construction, and name.\n\n==Design and construction==\n[[Image:Josh Reedy Decemberadio.jpg|thumb|250px|Josh Reedy of [[DecembeRadio]] playing a custom Gibson Thunderbird onstage.]]\n\nThe Thunderbird bass, like the [[Rickenbacker#Basses|Rickenbacker 4000 series]] and the Firebird guitar designed concurrently, had [[neck-through]] construction: the neck wood runs the entire length of the body, with the rest of the body glued into place, although some cheaper [[Epiphone]] models feature a more conventional bolt-on neck construction.\n\nWhile previous Gibson bass guitars had a short scale of 30\u00bd\",   the Thunderbird had a 34\" scale equal to that of the 34\" scale of Fender's bass guitars.\n\nThere were originally two Thunderbird models, the Thunderbird II (one pickup) and Thunderbird IV (two pickups) The Thunderbird generally features bass humbuckers, colloquially referred to as \"soapbars\" due to their oblong shape.\n\n===Non-Reverse Thunderbirds===\nIn 1966, Gibson changed the Thunderbird's design and construction. The original Thunderbirds (and Firebirds) had a \"reverse\" body, with the treble horn extended and the bass horn recessed. Due to a lawsuit brought by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] because of the resemblance to the [[Fender Jazzmaster]], the body styles were modified, with the result being called the \"non-reverse\" body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibsonbass.com/thunderbird66.php |title=1966 Gibson Thunderbird bass |publisher=Gibsonbass.com |date=1965-06-22 |accessdate=2009-11-09}}</ref> Also, the expensive neck-through construction was replaced by traditional Gibson set-neck construction. The non-reverse Thunderbird was continued until 1969, when the Thunderbird was discontinued. Though fewer non-reverse Thunderbirds were shipped, the original reverse-body instruments retain a higher collector's value. Gibson started producing the non-reverse Thunderbirds again for the public in late 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/Bass/Gibson-USA/Thunderbird-Non-Reverse-Bass.aspx |title=Gibson Thunderbird Non-Reverse Bass|publisher=[[Gibson Guitar Corporation]]  |accessdate=2013-01-10}}</ref>\n\n==1976-79 Reissue==\nThe Thunderbird IV was reissued in 1976 as a bicentennial edition. This reissue featured the original body shape and neck-through construction but unlike the previous issues, the bicentennial edition included the new \"3-point\" bridge and a red, white, and blue thunderbird logo. The bass was offered in tobacco burst, ebony, white, or natural finish. After the bicentennial, the Thunderbird was continued as a regular production model until 1979, when it was discontinued once again.\n\n==Current and Recent Thunderbird models==\nThe Thunderbird IV was re-introduced to the Gibson line in 1987 and was in regular production until 2015.\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Gibson_thunderbird_IV_bass.JPG|right]] -->\n\nThe most recent official Thunderbirds produced by Gibson Guitar Corporation:\n''(Most, if not all, of the following links are broken.
