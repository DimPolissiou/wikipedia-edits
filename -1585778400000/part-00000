The population was 15,651 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Bay Village is located in [[Ohio's 9th congressional district]].\n\n==History==\nBefore the first European-Americans arrived in the area around 1600, [[Erie people|Erie Indians]] lived in Bay Village and the surrounding areas.  The most important Indian trail in Ohio is present-day Lake Road, which is a main road in Bay Village. In that same century, what is now Bay Village, along with [[Avon Lake, Ohio|Avon Lake]], [[Avon, Ohio|Avon]], and [[Westlake, Ohio|Westlake]], was part of one territory. This territory was later called by the whites in a native language, \"Xeuma\", a term roughly meaning \"those who came before us\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rmBKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA339&dq=xeuma&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjZ9ODf1e_lAhVK4qwKHSoJAqsQ6AEwBXoECAkQAg#v=onepage&q=xeuma&f=false|title=Western Reserve Historical Society Publication|last=Society|first=Western Reserve Historical|date=1892|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe area belonged to [[Connecticut]] until 1803, the year in which Ohio became a state.  Before 1803, the [[Connecticut Land Company]] sold and gave away land in the area to Connecticut citizens, who had lost their homes and farms during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].  Because many had lost their homes to fires during the war, this new area was named \"the Firelands\".  One surveyor with the Connecticut Land Company was [[Moses Cleaveland]].  He came with his friends on horseback from Connecticut and stopped at the [[Cuyahoga River]] with his Indian guides in July 1796.  The land was then divided into five townships.  The area between the Cuyahoga River and The Firelands to the west was laid out in 1806. \n<ref>{{cite web|title=Bay Village Historical Society-Online|url=http://www.bayhistorical.com|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nJoseph Cahoon settled the City of Bay Village in 1810.  Bay Village was part of the original [[Dover Township, Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Dover Township]].  Bay Township split from Dover Township in 1901.  In 1903, Bay Village was incorporated, and the first mayor and council were elected.  In 1917, the last Cahoon descendant died, leaving the family home and 115 acres of land to the city.  John Huntington, one of the original partners of [[Standard Oil Company]], donated his summer estate to the [[Cleveland Metroparks]].  Bay Village became a city on January 1, 1950, when it had reached a population of 6,917.<ref>{{cite web|title=City of Bay Village|url=http://www.cityofbayvillage.com/about-our-city.aspx|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBay Village is located at {{Coord|41|29|3|N|81|55|36|W|type:city}} (41.484193, \u221281.926581).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.06|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|4.57|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|2.49|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2013-01-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-01-25 }}</ref>\n\nBay Village is home to the [[Cleveland Metroparks]] Huntington Reservation.

[[Cleveland]] in [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]], [[Ohio]], United States. The population was 15,651 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Bay Village is located in [[Ohio's 9th congressional district]].\n\n==History==\nBefore the first European-Americans arrived in the area around 1600, [[Erie people|Erie Indians]] lived in Bay Village and the surrounding areas.  The most important Indian trail in Ohio is present-day Lake Road, which is a main road in Bay Village. In that same century, what is now Bay Village, along with [[Avon Lake, Ohio|Avon Lake]], [[Avon, Ohio|Avon]], and [[Westlake, Ohio|Westlake]], was part of one territory. This territory was later called by the whites in a native language, \"Xeuma\", a term roughly meaning \"those who came before us\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rmBKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA339&dq=xeuma&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjZ9ODf1e_lAhVK4qwKHSoJAqsQ6AEwBXoECAkQAg#v=onepage&q=xeuma&f=false|title=Western Reserve Historical Society Publication|last=Society|first=Western Reserve Historical|date=1892|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe area belonged to [[Connecticut]] until 1803, the year in which Ohio became a state.  Before 1803, the [[Connecticut Land Company]] sold and gave away land in the area to Connecticut citizens, who had lost their homes and farms during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].  Because many had lost their homes to fires during the war, this new area was named \"the Firelands\".  One surveyor with the Connecticut Land Company was [[Moses Cleaveland]].  He came with his friends on horseback from Connecticut and stopped at the [[Cuyahoga River]] with his Indian guides in July 1796.  The land was then divided into five townships.  The area between the Cuyahoga River and The Firelands to the west was laid out in 1806. \n<ref>{{cite web|title=Bay Village Historical Society-Online|url=http://www.bayhistorical.com|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nJoseph Cahoon settled the City of Bay Village in 1810.  Bay Village was part of the original [[Dover Township, Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Dover Township]].  Bay Township split from Dover Township in 1901.  In 1903, Bay Village was incorporated, and the first mayor and council were elected.  In 1917, the last Cahoon descendant died, leaving the family home and 115 acres of land to the city.  John Huntington, one of the original partners of [[Standard Oil Company]], donated his summer estate to the [[Cleveland Metroparks]].  Bay Village became a city on January 1, 1950, when it had reached a population of 6,917.<ref>{{cite web|title=City of Bay Village|url=http://www.cityofbayvillage.com/about-our-city.aspx|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBay Village is located at {{Coord|41|29|3|N|81|55|36|W|type:city}} (41.484193, \u221281.926581).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.06|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|4.57|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|2.49|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2013-01-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-01-25 }}</ref>\n\nBay Village is home to the [[Cleveland Metroparks]] Huntington Reservation.

You should say something about all these women that are saying [they're] turning gay.'\" Rose stated that she is more neutral on the topic, and believes people are being complimentary when making such comments rather than trying to be derogatory or diminish the coming out process. She compared today's society to how society was in the past, saying that people would probably watch someone onscreen that they were attracted to, but not be able to joke about it \"because that would be so frowned upon.\" She said that people should not nitpick who can or cannot identify as genderqueer, gender-neutral, bisexual or trans, or tell them how to live their lives, adding that people should let others say what they want to about their sexuality, and that this is a message the LGBT community should be supporting.<ref name=\"Rees\"/>\n\nIn ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s 2019 LGBTQ special issue, Rose again discussed her gender identity, and the backlash to her casting as the title character of the television series ''Batwoman''.<ref name=\"Gomez\"/> She stated that the opportunity to audition for ''Orange Is the New Black'' came about because the show wanted to have a gender-neutral character, but that she has also received criticism because of her genderfluid identity, adding, \"When I got cast as a lesbian in ''Batwoman'', I didn't know that being a gender-fluid woman meant that I couldn't be a lesbian because I'm not a woman \u2014 not considered lesbian enough.\" She said that while her initial response was dismissive, she later considered if there was a way to remedy the situation so that others would not be offended by her identity, stating, \"That's when I sort of said, 'I'm a woman that identifies as a woman. I'm not trans. But if being gender-fluid means that I can't identify as a woman at any point, then I guess I can't be that.\" She pondered making up a term that does not offend people and would indicate that she is \"fluid in [her] gender, but also a lesbian.\"<ref name=\"Gomez\">{{cite web |author=Gomez, Patrick |title=Gender-fluid Ruby Rose Opens up About the backlash She's Received for Identifying As a Lesbian|url=https://ew.com/celebrity/2019/06/05/batwoman-ruby-rose-lesbian-backlash-interview/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=Entertainment Weekly Inc |date=2019-06-19 |accessdate=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

You should say something about all these women that are saying [they're] turning gay.'\" Rose stated that she is more neutral on the topic, and believes people are being complimentary when making such comments rather than trying to be derogatory or diminish the coming out process. She compared today's society to how society was in the past, saying that people would probably watch someone onscreen that they were attracted to, but not be able to joke about it \"because that would be so frowned upon.\" She said that people should not nitpick who can or cannot identify as genderqueer, gender-neutral, bisexual or trans, or tell them how to live their lives, adding that people should let others say what they want to about their sexuality, and that this is a message the LGBT community should be supporting.<ref name=\"Rees\"/>\n\nIn ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s 2019 LGBTQ special issue, Rose again discussed her gender identity, and the backlash to her casting as the title character of the television series ''Batwoman''.<ref name=\"Gomez\"/> She stated that the opportunity to audition for ''Orange Is the New Black'' came about because the show wanted to have a gender-neutral character, but that she has also received criticism because of her genderfluid identity, adding, \"When I got cast as a lesbian in ''Batwoman'', I didn't know that being a gender-fluid woman meant that I couldn't be a lesbian because I'm not a woman \u2014 not considered lesbian enough.\" She said that while her initial response was dismissive, she later considered if there was a way to remedy the situation so that others would not be offended by her identity, stating, \"That's when I sort of said, 'I'm a woman that identifies as a woman. I'm not trans. But if being gender-fluid means that I can't identify as a woman at any point, then I guess I can't be that.\" She pondered making up a term that does not offend people and would indicate that she is \"fluid in [her] gender, but also a lesbian.\"<ref name=\"Gomez\">{{cite web |author=Gomez, Patrick |title=Gender-fluid Ruby Rose Opens up About the backlash She's Received for Identifying As a Lesbian|url=https://ew.com/celebrity/2019/06/05/batwoman-ruby-rose-lesbian-backlash-interview/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=Entertainment Weekly Inc |date=2019-06-19 |accessdate=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
