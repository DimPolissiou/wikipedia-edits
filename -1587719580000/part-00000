[[Alex Morgan]] and [[Megan Rapinoe]] also make cameo appearances. The story mode also has new playable characters, such as Danny Williams, who is Alex Hunter's best friend, and also featuring a character new to the series, Alex Hunter's [[half-sister]], Kim Hunter.\n\n===Story===\nThe story begins with a TV-style 'previously on' section that recaps the key events of the first journey. Then the game cuts to Alex Hunter and his friend Danny Williams, enjoying their last day on holiday in Brazil, before they are approached by some young kids who challenge them to a football game. After returning home to England, Alex and his team are informed about a pre-season tournament in the US, before which Alex is invited to an interview with [[Rio Ferdinand]], but later runs into his old friend and rival Gareth Walker, who says he can't believe that Alex is still with his agent Michael Taylor. Then at the tour in LA, Alex's team faces off against [[Real Madrid]] and at the end of the match, regardless of the result, Alex swaps numbers with [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], who suggests that Alex comes and plays for Madrid, having been impressed by his play. If the player beats Real Madrid, you play against LA Galaxy, where Hunter encounters [[Gyasi Zardes]] in the tunnel before the match starts. Alex also meets his father during the tour, and begrudgingly accepts an invitation to have dinner with him. After the tour, Alex Hunter and his teammates go to Chicago where they participate in the [[Major League Soccer All-Star Game|MLS All-Star Game]].\n\nFollowing the first game of the new [[Premier League]] season, Michael tells Alex that none other than Real Madrid are keen on signing him. Despite it being a risky move with Alex who is still in his youth, he decides to follow his dreams, and put forward a transfer request. This causes both Alex's teammates and the fans to lose faith in his commitment to the team \u2013 even to the point of the fans booing him when he is subbed on during a game. Unfortunately, just one day before the transfer window closes, Michael reveals that he found out that the Real Madrid deal was a scam, and that they were never interested in him joining their team. While the club executive appreciates that neither Michael or Alex had any reason to believe the deal was fake, it doesn't counter the fact that Alex put a transfer request in \u2013 meaning that he wanted to leave. Alex is subsequently pulled from the senior squad and put on the youth squad. With just hours until the deadline, Michael admits that he really wanted to sign Alex with Madrid because he was falling behind in his reputation as an agent, and so he went with the deal without really thinking too much. Alex is enraged at Michael for gambling his football career for his personal gain, and the player is then given the option to forgive Michael and stay with him, or fire him due to his almost career ending mistake.\n\nRegardless of the player's decision, Alex then gets a call from his Dad, who is now working for [[LA Galaxy]]. The team offer him a contract to play for LA, due to some injuries their strikers have suffered from. With no other option to go for, aside from training with the youth squad, Alex accepts the deal, helping the team to reach the playoffs. Shortly after he arrives in the US, a young girl recognizes him in the changing rooms. While dining out with his father, Alex learns that she is Kim Hunter \u2013 his half sister. Less than impressed with his father for not telling him about Kim, Alex storms off, but later comes to support Kim during her international debut for the [[United States women's national soccer team|US ladies]] against Germany. With Christmas coming around, Alex returns home to England after the season with LA ends, but gives Kim their grandfather's football for luck in her future games.\n\nAfter reuniting with Danny, who signed up with Alex's former club when he left, Alex learns that [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]], [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|PSG]], and [[Bayern Munich]] are interested in signing him (if the player kept Michael, he signs him or if the player fired him, Alex is signed by his dad). Alex signs to one of them and when he arrives finds out that Dino, the manager of Alex's former loan club, is at his new club as well. Dino pairs Alex up with either [[Thomas Muller]], [[Antoine Griezmann]], or [[Dele Alli]], the player serving as Alex's strike partner. Just three games in however, Alex suffers a knee injury that sidelines him from the pitch for most of the season. At this point the game switches to Danny Williams' perspective, whose career at Alex's former club is at risk. After playing a game, the player is given the option to either play as Williams and try and save his career, or simply give it up and take control of Hunter in the next chapter.\n\nHaving recovered from his injury in rehab, Alex meets up with Kim for a kick around before going back to his European team, where he finds out that Dino's job is at risk, and he may be fired if the club doesn't win any silverware by the season's end. If Hunter plays well and wins the league or cup final, Dino keeps his job. If not, Dino will indeed be fired and Alex helps him clean out his desk.\n\nAfter the season ends, Alex takes Jim over to the US to meet Kim for the first time and they dine at the restaurant. After he eats, Alex receives a call from an agent who claims to have been keeping her eye on him. She offers to make him an icon and tells him to meet up with her, leading into his appearance in [[FIFA 19]].\n\n==Development==\n''FIFA 18'' was developed and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. In January 2017, during the [[Nintendo Switch]] Presentation, EA announced a custom-built port of ''FIFA 18'' on the Nintendo Switch console. It runs on an internally developed [[game engine]], as opposed to [[Frostbite (game engine)|Frostbite engine]] that several versions of the game run on. While the Switch version includes a career mode, it excludes the story-based Journey mode. The Switch version runs at a resolution of 1080p at 60 frames per second when docked to a TV, and 720p at 60 frames per second in the handheld/tabletop mode. The Switch version marks the first time Ultimate Team ever made an appearance on a Nintendo system. Features exclusive to the Switch version include local multiplayer in the form of the new mode Local Seasons, allowing up to 2 Nintendo Switches to connect and compete in a five-match sequence. Another mode exclusive to Switch is the Switch Kick-Off mode, allowing players to instantly get into local/solo matches.<ref name=\"NLcitesAdvNSFIFA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/06/fifa_18_on_switch_to_include_ultimate_team_ea_boasts_of_most_advanced_portable_version |title=FIFA 18 on Switch to Include Ultimate Team, EA Boasts of Most 'Advanced' Portable Version |first=Thomas |last=Whitehead |date=10 June 2017 |website=[[Nintendo Life]] |accessdate= 24 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=F18>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-11-fifa-18-on-nintendo-switch-is-the-best-portable-fifa-ever |title=FIFA 18 on Nintendo Switch is the best portable FIFA ever|date=21 June 2017|publisher=Wesley Yin-Poole}}</ref>\n\nThe faces for [[Forest Green Rovers]] were captured for the game, a first for a club outside of Europe's top leagues.

Players criticized EA of changing the game through patches which resulted in large amounts of glitches and bugs in the game, players not getting what they paid for, and the need to spend a large amount of real currency to obtain a decent Ultimate Team. FIFA Ultimate Team packs have been called [[loot box]]es in another name and the similarity to addictive gambling due to their use of variable-ratio scheduling used in gambling. Players also accused Ultimate Team packs of having mediocre drop rates.

[[Alex Morgan]] and [[Megan Rapinoe]] also make cameo appearances. The story mode also has new playable characters, such as Danny Williams, who is Alex Hunter's best friend, and also featuring a character new to the series, Alex Hunter's [[half-sister]], Kim Hunter.\n\n===Story===\nThe story begins with a TV-style 'previously on' section that recaps the key events of the first journey. Then the game cuts to Alex Hunter and his friend Danny Williams, enjoying their last day on holiday in Brazil, before they are approached by some young kids who challenge them to a football game. After returning home to England, Alex and his team are informed about a pre-season tournament in the US, before which Alex is invited to an interview with [[Rio Ferdinand]], but later runs into his old friend and rival Gareth Walker, who says he can't believe that Alex is still with his agent Michael Taylor. Then at the tour in LA, Alex's team faces off against [[Real Madrid]] and at the end of the match, regardless of the result, Alex swaps numbers with [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], who suggests that Alex comes and plays for Madrid, having been impressed by his play. If the player beats Real Madrid, you play against LA Galaxy, where Hunter encounters [[Gyasi Zardes]] in the tunnel before the match starts. Alex also meets his father during the tour, and begrudgingly accepts an invitation to have dinner with him. After the tour, Alex Hunter and his teammates go to Chicago where they participate in the [[Major League Soccer All-Star Game|MLS All-Star Game]].\n\nFollowing the first game of the new [[Premier League]] season, Michael tells Alex that none other than Real Madrid are keen on signing him. Despite it being a risky move with Alex who is still in his youth, he decides to follow his dreams, and put forward a transfer request. This causes both Alex's teammates and the fans to lose faith in his commitment to the team \u2013 even to the point of the fans booing him when he is subbed on during a game. Unfortunately, just one day before the transfer window closes, Michael reveals that he found out that the Real Madrid deal was a scam, and that they were never interested in him joining their team. While the club executive appreciates that neither Michael or Alex had any reason to believe the deal was fake, it doesn't counter the fact that Alex put a transfer request in \u2013 meaning that he wanted to leave. Alex is subsequently pulled from the senior squad and put on the youth squad. With just hours until the deadline, Michael admits that he really wanted to sign Alex with Madrid because he was falling behind in his reputation as an agent, and so he went with the deal without really thinking too much. Alex is enraged at Michael for gambling his football career for his personal gain, and the player is then given the option to forgive Michael and stay with him, or fire him due to his almost career ending mistake.\n\nRegardless of the player's decision, Alex then gets a call from his Dad, who is now working for [[LA Galaxy]]. The team offer him a contract to play for LA, due to some injuries their strikers have suffered from. With no other option to go for, aside from training with the youth squad, Alex accepts the deal, helping the team to reach the playoffs. Shortly after he arrives in the US, a young girl recognizes him in the changing rooms. While dining out with his father, Alex learns that she is Kim Hunter \u2013 his half sister. Less than impressed with his father for not telling him about Kim, Alex storms off, but later comes to support Kim during her international debut for the [[United States women's national soccer team|US ladies]] against Germany. With Christmas coming around, Alex returns home to England after the season with LA ends, but gives Kim their grandfather's football for luck in her future games.\n\nAfter reuniting with Danny, who signed up with Alex's former club when he left, Alex learns that [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]], [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|PSG]], and [[Bayern Munich]] are interested in signing him (if the player kept Michael, he signs him or if the player fired him, Alex is signed by his dad). Alex signs to one of them and when he arrives finds out that Dino, the manager of Alex's former loan club, is at his new club as well. Dino pairs Alex up with either [[Thomas Muller]], [[Antoine Griezmann]], or [[Dele Alli]], the player serving as Alex's strike partner. Just three games in however, Alex suffers a knee injury that sidelines him from the pitch for most of the season. At this point the game switches to Danny Williams' perspective, whose career at Alex's former club is at risk. After playing a game, the player is given the option to either play as Williams and try and save his career, or simply give it up and take control of Hunter in the next chapter.\n\nHaving recovered from his injury in rehab, Alex meets up with Kim for a kick around before going back to his European team, where he finds out that Dino's job is at risk, and he may be fired if the club doesn't win any silverware by the season's end. If Hunter plays well and wins the league or cup final, Dino keeps his job. If not, Dino will indeed be fired and Alex helps him clean out his desk.\n\nAfter the season ends, Alex takes Jim over to the US to meet Kim for the first time and they dine at the restaurant. After he eats, Alex receives a call from an agent who claims to have been keeping her eye on him. She offers to make him an icon and tells him to meet up with her, leading into his appearance in [[FIFA 19]].\n\n==Development==\n''FIFA 18'' was developed and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. In January 2017, during the [[Nintendo Switch]] Presentation, EA announced a custom-built port of ''FIFA 18'' on the Nintendo Switch console. It runs on an internally developed [[game engine]], as opposed to [[Frostbite (game engine)|Frostbite engine]] that several versions of the game run on. While the Switch version includes a career mode, it excludes the story-based Journey mode. The Switch version runs at a resolution of 1080p at 60 frames per second when docked to a TV, and 720p at 60 frames per second in the handheld/tabletop mode. The Switch version marks the first time Ultimate Team ever made an appearance on a Nintendo system. Features exclusive to the Switch version include local multiplayer in the form of the new mode Local Seasons, allowing up to 2 Nintendo Switches to connect and compete in a five-match sequence. Another mode exclusive to Switch is the Switch Kick-Off mode, allowing players to instantly get into local/solo matches.<ref name=\"NLcitesAdvNSFIFA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/06/fifa_18_on_switch_to_include_ultimate_team_ea_boasts_of_most_advanced_portable_version |title=FIFA 18 on Switch to Include Ultimate Team, EA Boasts of Most 'Advanced' Portable Version |first=Thomas |last=Whitehead |date=10 June 2017 |website=[[Nintendo Life]] |accessdate= 24 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=F18>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-11-fifa-18-on-nintendo-switch-is-the-best-portable-fifa-ever |title=FIFA 18 on Nintendo Switch is the best portable FIFA ever|date=21 June 2017|publisher=Wesley Yin-Poole}}</ref>\n\nThe faces for [[Forest Green Rovers]] were captured for the game, a first for a club outside of Europe's top leagues.

Players criticized EA of changing the game through patches which resulted in large amounts of glitches and bugs in the game, players not getting what they paid for, and the need to spend a large amount of real currency to obtain a decent Ultimate Team. FIFA Ultimate Team packs have been called [[loot box]]es in another name and the similarity to addictive gambling due to their use of variable-ratio scheduling used in gambling.

Popular music of the area includes:\n* ''Shishtoo-war (Sauz)'', a popular folk music played with shehnai on happy occasions, mostly at marriages.\n* ''Shab-daraaz (Dani)'' is a sad tone based on heartbroken love poems.\n* ''Ghalhwar'' is a combination of Dani and Sauz. This is a mixture of fast and classical music played at the starting of a polo match.\n\n== Notable people from Chitral ==\n* [[Saleem Khan (politician)]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Khowar language]]\n* [[Khoshey people]]\n* [[Kashmiri people]]\n* [[Shina people]]\n* [[Brokpa]]s\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://chitraltoday.net/about-chitral/ chitraltoday.net]\n\n{{Ethnic groups in Pakistan}}\n{{Ethnic groups in India}}\n\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in India]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Afghanistan]]\n[[Category:Social groups of Jammu and Kashmir]]\n[[Category:Social groups of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]\n[[Category:Dardic peoples]]\n[[Category:Chitral District]]\n", "name_user": "118.107.136.73", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Undid revision 952432635 byZakaria1978(talk) No improvement)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kho_people"}

It was founded in 1970 by the ''[[maechi]]'' (nun) [[Chandra Khonnokyoong]] and [[Luang Por Dhammajayo]]. The temple's founding has roots in the [[Dhammakaya tradition]] founded by [[Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro]] at [[Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen]] in the early twentieth century.{{sfn|Sirikanchana|2010|p=885}}{{sfn|Swearer|2010|p=114}}{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=52}} Wat Phra Dhammakaya is known for its modern dissemination methods and use of technology.\n\nThe temple was initially founded as a meditation center, after Maechi Chandra and the just ordained monk Luang Por Dhammajayo could no longer accommodate the rising number of participants in their activities at [[Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen]], becoming an official temple in 1977. The temple experienced rapid growth during the 1980s, when the temple's programs became widely known among the urban middle class. Wat Phra Dhammakaya expanded its area quickly during this period and started building its iconic ''[[stupa]]'' (pagoda).\n\nDuring the period of the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], however, the temple was subject to widespread criticism for its fundraising methods and teachings, Luang Por Dhammajayo was eventually charged with embezzlement and removed from his office as abbot. In 2006, the charges were withdrawn and he was restored as abbot. The temple grew further in the following years and became known for its many projects in education, promotion of ethics, and scholarship in Thai society. The temple's tradition developed an international scope, as of 2007, the temple's following was estimated at one million practitioners worldwide and thirty to fifty international centers outside of Thailand.\n\nUnder the [[2014 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat|2014 military junta]], the abbot and the temple were put under scrutiny again and Luang Por Dhammajayo was accused of receiving stolen money of a supporter and money-laundering. This incident led to several standoffs between the temple and the junta, eventually leading to 23 day lock down of the temple in 2017 by the junta that made headlines worldwide. In the aftermath of the lock down the junta stated they will look for Luang Por Dhammajayo elsewhere but continued its scrutiny of the temple, giving the vice abbot, [[Luang Por Dattajivo]] several charges as well.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Founding years (1963\u20131978) ==\n\n=== First encounters ===\n\nWat Phra Dhammakaya started with the ''[[maechi]]'' (nun) [[Chandra Khonnokyoong]].

An experienced architect and experienced engineers were employed, and the latest technology was used in the construction, to meet the demands of the project and to follow the [[Stupa#Construction|traditions of ''cetiyas'' and ''stupas'']]. Though traditionally ''stupas'' were often financed by kings, the Dhammakaya Cetiya was to be financed by people of all parts of society, all contributing their part.

This edition was to provide the technology and comparative data for scholars to come to a reconstruction of the Tipitaka texts as they were known in the fifth century CE, when they were first written down.

It was founded in 1970 by the ''[[maechi]]'' (nun) [[Chandra Khonnokyoong]] and [[Luang Por Dhammajayo]]. The temple's founding has roots in the [[Dhammakaya tradition]] founded by [[Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro]] at [[Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen]] in the early twentieth century.{{sfn|Sirikanchana|2010|p=885}}{{sfn|Swearer|2010|p=114}}{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=52}} Wat Phra Dhammakaya is known for its modern dissemination methods and use of technology.\n\nThe temple was initially founded as a meditation center, after Maechi Chandra and the just ordained monk Luang Por Dhammajayo could no longer accommodate the rising number of participants in their activities at [[Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen]], becoming an official temple in 1977. The temple experienced rapid growth during the 1980s, when the temple's programs became widely known among the urban middle class. Wat Phra Dhammakaya expanded its area quickly during this period and started building its iconic ''[[stupa]]'' (pagoda).\n\nDuring the period of the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], however, the temple was subject to widespread criticism for its fundraising methods and teachings, Luang Por Dhammajayo was eventually charged with embezzlement and removed from his office as abbot. In 2006, the charges were withdrawn and he was restored as abbot. The temple grew further in the following years and became known for its many projects in education, promotion of ethics, and scholarship in Thai society. The temple's tradition developed an international scope, as of 2007, the temple's following was estimated at one million practitioners worldwide and thirty to fifty international centers outside of Thailand.\n\nUnder the [[2014 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat|2014 military junta]], the abbot and the temple were put under scrutiny again and Luang Por Dhammajayo was accused of receiving stolen money of a supporter and money-laundering. This incident led to several standoffs between the temple and the junta, eventually leading to 23 day lock down of the temple in 2017 by the junta that made headlines worldwide. In the aftermath of the lock down the junta stated they will look for Luang Por Dhammajayo elsewhere but continued its scrutiny of the temple, giving the vice abbot, [[Luang Por Dattajivo]] several charges as well.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Founding years (1963\u20131978) ==\n\n=== First encounters ===\n\nWat Phra Dhammakaya started with the ''[[maechi]]'' (nun) [[Chandra Khonnokyoong]].

Chaiyabun had set up a group called \"Dhammaprasit\" and this group had financed the house together in which to organize meditations. Once Chaiyabun was ordained as a monk in 1969 and received the name [[Phra Dhammajayo]], he started teaching Dhammakaya meditation together with Maechi Chandra.{{sfn|Heikkil\u00e4-Horn|1996|p=94}} Because of the popularity of both teachers, the house soon became overcrowded with interested students and they considered it more appropriate to start a new meditation center by themselves.{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998}} Although initially they intended to {{em|buy}} a plot of land in Pathum Thani, the landowner ''[[Khunying]]'' Prayat Suntharawet gave a plot four times the requested size to practice generosity at the occasion of her birthday.

At the time Pathum Thani was well outside Bangkok's northern suburbs.{{sfn|Zehner|1990|p=408}} From acidic paddy fields, a woodland was created to be a park for meditation practitioners. The initial budget for construction was very low (3,200 [[Baht]]), but despite these economical constraints, the construction of the buildings on the land was able to continue.<ref name=\"Forbes 2015\" /> A book about the initiative was compiled, to inspire people to join in and help.{{sfn|Dhammakaya Foundation|2005|pp=102\u20133}} In the accounts of the temple, it is told that the construction happened with great attention for detail. For example, the outside of the wall of the ''[[Ubosot]]'' was made of gravel that was selected manually.{{sfn|Thammachay\u014d|Thattach\u012bw\u014d|Tawandhamma Foundation|2007|pp=46\u20139}} Because the land at first was very acidic, only [[Acacia|wattle]] could be planted.

The following year it was officially recognized as a temple by the Thai government, as \"Wat Voranee Dhammakayaram\", named after the daughter of ''Khunying'' Prayat, Voranee. However, there was disagreement as to who should become the abbot of the temple, and how the temple should develop further: Voranee then stopped supporting the temple.

Shortly afterwards, the Thai media responded very critically, leading to a nationwide, very intense debate about the state of [[Thai Buddhism]] in general, and Wat Phra Dhammakaya in particular, that lasted for an unusually long ten months. Critics believed that Wat Phra Dhammakaya, and Thai Buddhism in general, had become too much of a commercial enterprise ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e38\u0e17\u0e18\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e19\u0e34\u0e0a\u0e22\u0e4c}}) and had grown corrupt; practitioners and temple devotees argued tradition was being followed.<ref name=\"Falk 2007\" />{{sfn|Scott|2009|pp=2\u20133, 13, 124}}\n\nThe main criticism was that the temple was using fundraising methods that did not fit in with Buddhism.

This edition was to provide the technology and comparative data for scholars to come to a reconstruction of the Tipitaka texts as they were known in the fifth century CE, when they were first written down.

It is an important quantity in physics because it is a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]]\u2014the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant.\n\nIn three [[dimensions]], the angular momentum for a [[point particle]] is a [[pseudovector]] '''r''' \u00d7 '''p''', the [[cross product]] of the particle's [[position vector]] '''r''' (relative to some origin) and its [[momentum vector]]; the latter is '''p''' = ''m'''''v''' in Newtonian mechanics. This definition can be applied to each point in [[Continuum mechanics|continua]] like solids or fluids, or [[field (physics)|physical fields]]. Unlike momentum, angular momentum does depend on where the origin is chosen, since the particle's position is measured from it.\n\nJust like for [[angular velocity]], there are two special types of angular momentum: the spin angular momentum and the orbital angular momentum. The spin angular momentum of an object is defined as the angular momentum about its [[centre of mass]] coordinate. The orbital angular momentum of an object about a chosen origin is defined as the angular momentum of the centre of mass about the origin. The total angular momentum of an object is the sum of the spin and orbital angular momenta. The orbital angular momentum vector of a particle is always parallel and directly proportional to the orbital [[angular velocity]] vector '''\u03c9''' of the particle, where the constant of proportionality depends on both the mass of the particle and its distance from origin. However, the spin angular momentum of the object is proportional but not always parallel to the spin angular velocity '''\u03a9''', making the constant of proportionality a second-rank [[tensor]] rather than a scalar.\n\nAngular momentum is additive; the total angular momentum of any composite system is the (pseudo) [[vector sum]] of the angular momenta of its constituent parts. For a continuous rigid body, the total angular momentum is the volume integral of angular momentum density (i.e. angular momentum per unit volume in the limit as volume shrinks to zero) over the entire body.\n\nTorque can be defined as the rate of change of angular momentum, analogous to [[force]]. The net ''external'' torque on any system is always equal to the ''total'' torque on the system; in other words, the sum of all internal torques of any system is always 0 (this is the rotational analogue of [[Newton's Third Law]]). Therefore, for a ''closed'' system (where there is no net external torque), the ''total'' torque on the system must be 0, which means that the total angular momentum of the system is constant. The conservation of angular momentum helps explain many observed phenomena, for example the increase in rotational speed of a spinning [[figure skater]] as the skater's arms are contracted, the high rotational rates of [[neutron star]]s, the [[Coriolis effect]], and the [[precession]] of [[gyroscope]]s. In general, conservation does limit the possible motion of a system, but does not uniquely determine what the exact motion is.\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], angular momentum (like other quantities) is expressed as an [[operator (physics)|operator]]<!-- note that [[angular momentum operator]] is linked from [[#In quantum mechanics]]-->, and its one-dimensional projections have [[point spectrum|quantized eigenvalues]]. Angular momentum is subject to the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], implying that at any time, only one [[vector projection|projection]] (also called \"component\") can be measured with definite precision; the other two then remain uncertain. Because of this, it turns out that the notion of a quantum particle literally \"spinning\" about an axis does not exist. Nevertheless, elementary particles still possess a spin angular momentum, but this angular momentum does not correspond to spinning motion in the ordinary sense.<ref>{{cite book |title=Understanding the Properties of Matter |edition=2nd, illustrated, revised |first1=Michael |last1=de Podesta |publisher=CRC Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-415-25788-6 |page=29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ya-4enCDoWQC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=ya-4enCDoWQC&pg=PA29 Extract of page 29]</ref>\n\n==In classical mechanics==\n=== Definition ===\n{{Main|Scalar (physics)|Euclidean vector}}\n\n==== Orbital angular momentum in two dimensions ====\n[[File:Ang mom 2d.png|right|thumb|[[Velocity]] of the [[particle]] ''m'' with respect to the origin ''O'' can be resolved into components parallel to (''v''<sub>\u2225</sub>) and perpendicular to (''v''<sub>\u22a5</sub>) the radius vector ''r''.

For instance, a particle of matter at the outer edge of a wheel is, in effect, at the end of a [[lever]] of the same length as the wheel's radius, its momentum turning the lever about the center point. This imaginary lever is known as the ''moment arm''.

If the net force on some body is directed always toward some point, the ''center'', then there is no torque on the body with respect to the center, as all of the force is directed along the [[Position (vector)|radius vector]], and none is [[perpendicular]] to the radius. Mathematically, torque <math>\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{0}, </math> because in this case <math>\\mathbf{r}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{F}</math> are parallel vectors. Therefore, the angular momentum of the body about the center is constant. This is the case with [[gravity|gravitational attraction]] in the [[orbit]]s of [[planet]]s and [[satellite]]s, where the gravitational force is always directed toward the primary body and orbiting bodies conserve angular momentum by exchanging distance and velocity as they move about the primary. Central force motion is also used in the analysis of the [[Bohr model]] of the [[atom]].\n\nFor a planet, angular momentum is distributed between the spin of the planet and its revolution in its orbit, and these are often exchanged by various mechanisms. The conservation of angular momentum in the [[Lunar theory|Earth\u2013Moon system]] results in the transfer of angular momentum from Earth to Moon, due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal torque]] the Moon exerts on the Earth. This in turn results in the slowing down of the rotation rate of Earth, at about 65.7 nanoseconds per day,<ref>{{cite journal\n| title =Long-term changes in the rotation of the earth \u2013 700 B.C. to A.D. 1980\n|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\n|volume = 313\n| issue =1524\n| last1 =Stephenson\n| first1 =F.

This causes the [[Spinning top|top]] to [[precess]].]]\n\nThe conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an [[Ice skating|ice skater]] as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of the mass of her body closer to the axis, she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is the product of [[moment of inertia]] and [[angular velocity]], if the angular momentum remains constant (is conserved), then the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater must increase.\n\nThe same phenomenon results in extremely fast spin of compact stars (like [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s) when they are formed out of much larger and slower rotating stars. Decrease in the size of an object ''n'' times results in increase of its angular velocity by the factor of ''n''<sup>2</sup>.\n\nConservation is not always a full explanation for the dynamics of a system but is a key constraint. For example, a spinning [[top]] is subject to gravitational torque making it lean over and change the angular momentum about the [[nutation]] axis, but neglecting friction at the point of spinning contact, it has a conserved angular momentum about its spinning axis, and another about its [[precession]] axis. Also, in any [[planetary system]], the planets, star(s), comets, and asteroids can all move in numerous complicated ways, but only so that the angular momentum of the system is conserved.\n\n[[Noether's theorem]] states that every [[conservation law]] is associated with a [[symmetry]] (invariant) of the underlying physics. The symmetry associated with conservation of angular momentum is [[rotational invariance]]. The fact that the physics of a system is unchanged if it is rotated by any angle about an axis implies that angular momentum is conserved.<ref>{{cite book| title=The classical theory of fields|series=Course of Theoretical Physics|first1= L.

In this formalism, angular momentum is the [[2-form]] [[Noether charge]] associated with rotational invariance. As a result, angular momentum is not conserved for general [[curved space]]times, unless it happens to be asymptotically rotationally invariant.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nIn classical mechanics, the angular momentum of a particle can be reinterpreted as a plane element:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{r} \\wedge \\mathbf{p} \\,,</math>\n\nin which the [[exterior product]] \u2227 replaces the [[cross product]] \u00d7 (these products have similar characteristics but are nonequivalent). This has the advantage of a clearer geometric interpretation as a plane element, defined from the '''x''' and '''p''' vectors, and the expression is true in any number of dimensions (two or higher). In Cartesian coordinates:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathbf{L} &= \\left(xp_y - yp_x\\right)\\mathbf{e}_x \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_y + \\left(yp_z - zp_y\\right)\\mathbf{e}_y \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_z + \\left(zp_x - xp_z\\right)\\mathbf{e}_z \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_x\\\\\n             &= L_{xy}\\mathbf{e}_x \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_y + L_{yz}\\mathbf{e}_y \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_z + L_{zx}\\mathbf{e}_z \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_x \\,,\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nor more compactly in index notation:\n\n:<math>L_{ij} = x_i p_j - x_j p_i\\,.</math>\n\nThe angular velocity can also be defined as an antisymmetric second order tensor, with components ''\u03c9<sub>ij</sub>''. The relation between the two antisymmetric tensors is given by the moment of inertia which must now be a fourth order tensor:<ref>Synge and Schild, Tensor calculus, Dover publications, 1978 edition, p. 161. {{ISBN|978-0-486-63612-2}}.</ref>\n\n:<math>L_{ij} = I_{ijk\\ell} \\omega_{k\\ell} \\,. </math>\n\nAgain, this equation in '''L''' and '''\u03c9''' as tensors is true in any number of dimensions. This equation also appears in the [[geometric algebra]] formalism, in which '''L''' and '''\u03c9''' are bivectors, and the moment of inertia is a mapping between them.\n\nIn [[relativistic mechanics]], the [[relativistic angular momentum]] of a particle is expressed as an [[antisymmetric tensor]] of second order:\n\n:<math>M_{\\alpha\\beta} = X_\\alpha P_\\beta - X_\\beta P_\\alpha</math>\n\nin the language of [[four-vector]]s, namely the [[Four-position|four position]] ''X'' and the [[four momentum]] ''P'', and absorbs the above '''L''' together with the motion of the [[centre of mass]] of the particle.\n\nIn each of the above cases, for a system of particles, the total angular momentum is just the sum of the individual particle angular momenta, and the centre of mass is for the system.\n\n== In quantum mechanics ==\n{{Main|Angular momentum operator}}\nAngular momentum in [[quantum mechanics]] differs in many profound respects from angular momentum in [[classical mechanics]].

'''L''' is then an [[Operator (physics)|operator]], specifically called the ''[[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum operator]]''. The components of the angular momentum operator satisfy the commutation relations of the Lie algebra so(3). Indeed, these operators are precisely the infinitesimal action of the rotation group on the quantum Hilbert space.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 17.3</ref> (See also the discussion below of the angular momentum operators as the generators of rotations.)\n\nHowever, in quantum physics, there is another type of angular momentum, called ''[[spin (physics)|spin angular momentum]]'', represented by the spin operator '''S'''. Almost all [[elementary particle]]s have spin. Spin is often depicted as a particle literally spinning around an axis, but this is a misleading and inaccurate picture: spin is an intrinsic property of a particle, unrelated to any sort of motion in space and fundamentally different from orbital angular momentum. All [[elementary particle]]s have a characteristic spin, for example [[electron]]s have \"spin 1/2\" (this actually means \"spin [[reduced Planck constant|\u0127]]/2\") while [[photon]]s have \"spin 1\" (this actually means \"spin \u0127\").\n\nFinally, there is [[total angular momentum]] '''J''', which combines both the spin and orbital angular momentum of all particles and fields. (For one particle, '''J''' = '''L''' + '''S'''.) [[Conservation of angular momentum]] applies to '''J''', but not to '''L''' or '''S'''; for example, the [[spin\u2013orbit interaction]] allows angular momentum to transfer back and forth between '''L''' and '''S''', with the total remaining constant. Electrons and photons need not have integer-based values for total angular momentum, but can also have fractional values.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1501748|pmid=28861467|title=There are many ways to spin a photon: Half-quantization of a total optical angular momentum|journal=Science Advances|volume=2|issue=4|pages=e1501748|year=2016|last1=Ballantine|first1=K.

A standing wave like this can have 0,1,2, or any integer number of wavelengths around the circle, but it ''cannot'' have a non-integer number of wavelengths like 8.3. In quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized for a similar reason.]]\n(There are additional restrictions as well, see [[angular momentum operator]] for details.)\n\nThe [[reduced Planck constant]] <math>\\hbar</math> is tiny by everyday standards, about 10<sup>\u221234</sup> [[Joule-second|J s]], and therefore this quantization does not noticeably affect the angular momentum of macroscopic objects. However, it is very important in the microscopic world. For example, the structure of [[electron shell]]s and subshells in chemistry is significantly affected by the quantization of angular momentum.\n\nQuantization of angular momentum was first postulated by [[Niels Bohr]] in his [[Bohr model]] of the atom and was later predicted by [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] in his [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation#Quantization|Schr\u00f6dinger equation]].\n\n=== Uncertainty ===\nIn the definition <math>\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{r}\\times\\mathbf{p}</math>, six operators are involved: The [[position operator]]s <math>r_x</math>, <math>r_y</math>, <math>r_z</math>, and the [[momentum operator]]s <math>p_x</math>, <math>p_y</math>, <math>p_z</math>. However, the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] tells us that it is not possible for all six of these quantities to be known simultaneously with arbitrary precision. Therefore, there are limits to what can be known or measured about a particle's angular momentum. It turns out that the best that one can do is to simultaneously measure both the angular momentum vector's [[magnitude (vector)|magnitude]] and its component along one axis.\n\nThe uncertainty is closely related to the fact that different components of an [[angular momentum operator]] do not [[commutator|commute]], for example <math>L_xL_y \\neq L_yL_x</math>. (For the precise [[commutation relation]]s, see [[angular momentum operator]].)\n\n=== Total angular momentum as generator of rotations ===\nAs mentioned above, orbital angular momentum '''L''' is defined as in classical mechanics: <math>\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{r}\\times\\mathbf{p}</math>, but ''total'' angular momentum '''J''' is defined in a different, more basic way: '''J''' is defined as the \"generator of rotations\".<ref name=littlejohn>{{cite web|url=http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/1011/notes/spinrot.pdf|authorlink1=Robert Grayson Littlejohn|title= Lecture notes on rotations in quantum mechanics|first= Robert |last=Littlejohn|accessdate= 13 Jan 2012|work=Physics 221B Spring 2011|year=2011}}</ref> More specifically, '''J''' is defined so that the operator\n:<math>R(\\hat{n},\\phi) \\equiv \\exp\\left(-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\phi\\, \\mathbf{J}\\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}\\right)</math>\nis the [[Rotation operator (quantum mechanics)|rotation operator]] that takes any system and rotates it by angle <math>\\phi</math> about the axis <math>\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}</math>. (The \"exp\" in the formula refers to [[matrix exponential|operator exponential]]) To put this the other way around, whatever our quantum Hilbert space is, we expect that the [[rotation group SO(3)]] will act on it. There is then an associated action of the Lie algebra so(3) of SO(3); the operators describing the action of so(3) on our Hilbert space are the (total) angular momentum operators.\n\nThe relationship between the angular momentum operator and the rotation operators is the same as the relationship between [[Lie algebra]]s and [[Lie group]]s in mathematics. The close relationship between angular momentum and rotations is reflected in [[Noether's theorem]] that proves that angular momentum is conserved whenever the laws of physics are rotationally invariant.\n\n== In electrodynamics ==\n{{See also|Momentum#Particle in field|l1=Momentum (Particle in field)}}\n\nWhen describing the motion of a [[charged particle]] in an [[electromagnetic field]], the [[canonical momentum]] '''P''' (derived from the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] for this system) is not [[gauge invariant]]. As a consequence, the canonical angular momentum '''L''' = '''r''' \u00d7 '''P''' is not gauge invariant either.

This had been known since [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] expounded his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|second law of planetary motion]]. Newton derived a unique geometric proof, and went on to show that the attractive force of the Sun's [[gravity]] was the cause of all of Kepler's laws.\n\nDuring the first interval of time, an object is in motion from point '''A''' to point '''B'''. Undisturbed, it would continue to point '''c''' during the second interval. When the object arrives at '''B''', it receives an impulse directed toward point '''S'''. The impulse gives it a small added velocity toward '''S''', such that if this were its only velocity, it would move from '''B''' to '''V''' during the second interval. By the [[Parallelogram of force|rules of velocity composition]], these two velocities add, and point '''C''' is found by construction of parallelogram '''BcCV'''. Thus the object's path is deflected by the impulse so that it arrives at point '''C''' at the end of the second interval. Because the triangles '''SBc''' and '''SBC''' have the same base '''SB''' and the same height '''Bc''' or '''VC''', they have the same area. By symmetry, triangle '''SBc''' also has the same area as triangle '''SAB''', therefore the object has swept out equal areas '''SAB''' and '''SBC''' in equal times.\n\nAt point '''C''', the object receives another impulse toward '''S''', again deflecting its path during the third interval from '''d''' to '''D'''. Thus it continues to '''E''' and beyond, the triangles '''SAB''', '''SBc''', '''SBC''', '''SCd''', '''SCD''', '''SDe''', '''SDE''' all having the same area. Allowing the time intervals to become ever smaller, the path '''ABCDE''' approaches indefinitely close to a continuous curve.\n\nNote that because this derivation is geometric, and no specific force is applied, it proves a more general law than Kepler's second law of planetary motion. It shows that the Law of Areas applies to any central force, attractive or repulsive, continuous or non-continuous, or zero.\n\n==== Conservation of angular momentum in the Law of Areas ====\nThe proportionality of angular momentum to the area swept out by a moving object can be understood by realizing that the bases of the triangles, that is, the lines from '''S''' to the object, are equivalent to the [[Angular momentum#Scalar \u2013 angular momentum in two dimensions|radius {{math|<var>r</var>}}]], and that the heights of the triangles are proportional to the perpendicular component of [[Angular momentum#Scalar \u2013 angular momentum in two dimensions|velocity {{math|<VAR>v</var><sub>\u22a5</sub>}}]]. Hence, if the area swept per unit time is constant, then by the triangular area formula {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}(base)(height)}}, the product {{math|(base)(height)}} and therefore the product {{math|<VAR>rv</var><sub>\u22a5</sub>}} are constant: if {{math|<VAR>r</var>}} and the base length are decreased, {{math|<VAR>v</var><sub>\u22a5</sub>}} and height must increase proportionally. Mass is constant, therefore [[Angular momentum#Scalar \u2013 angular momentum in two dimensions|angular momentum {{math|<VAR>rmv</var><sub>\u22a5</sub>}}]] is conserved by this exchange of distance and velocity.\n\nIn the case of triangle '''SBC''', area is equal to {{sfrac|1|2}}('''SB''')('''VC'''). Wherever '''C''' is eventually located due to the impulse applied at '''B''', the product ('''SB''')('''VC'''), and therefore {{math|<VAR>rmv</var><sub>\u22a5</sub>}} remain constant. Similarly so for each of the triangles.\n\n=== After Newton ===\n[[Leonhard Euler]], [[Daniel Bernoulli]], and [[Patrick d'Arcy]] all understood angular momentum in terms of conservation of [[areal velocity]], a result of their analysis of Kepler's second law of planetary motion.

It is an important quantity in physics because it is a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]]\u2014the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant.\n\nIn three [[dimensions]], the angular momentum for a [[point particle]] is a [[pseudovector]] '''r''' \u00d7 '''p''', the [[cross product]] of the particle's [[position vector]] '''r''' (relative to some origin) and its [[momentum vector]]; the latter is '''p''' = ''m'''''v''' in Newtonian mechanics. This definition can be applied to each point in [[Continuum mechanics|continua]] like solids or fluids, or [[field (physics)|physical fields]]. Unlike momentum, angular momentum does depend on where the origin is chosen, since the particle's position is measured from it.\n\nJust like for [[angular velocity]], there are two special types of angular momentum: the spin angular momentum and the orbital angular momentum. The spin angular momentum of an object is defined as the angular momentum about its [[centre of mass]] coordinate. The orbital angular momentum of an object about a chosen origin is defined as the angular momentum of the centre of mass about the origin. The total angular momentum of an object is the sum of the spin and orbital angular momenta. The orbital angular momentum vector of a particle is always parallel and directly proportional to the orbital [[angular velocity]] vector '''\u03c9''' of the particle, where the constant of proportionality depends on both the mass of the particle and its distance from origin. However, the spin angular momentum of the object is proportional but not always parallel to the spin angular velocity '''\u03a9''', making the constant of proportionality a second-rank [[tensor]] rather than a scalar.\n\nAngular momentum is additive; the total angular momentum of any composite system is the (pseudo) [[vector sum]] of the angular momenta of its constituent parts. For a continuous rigid body, the total angular momentum is the volume integral of angular momentum density (i.e. angular momentum per unit volume in the limit as volume shrinks to zero) over the entire body.\n\nTorque can be defined as the rate of change of angular momentum, analogous to [[force]]. The net ''external'' torque on any system is always equal to the ''total'' torque on the system; in other words, the sum of all internal torques of any system is always 0 (this is the rotational analogue of [[Newton's Third Law]]). Therefore, for a ''closed'' system (where there is no net external torque), the ''total'' torque on the system must be 0, which means that the total angular momentum of the system is constant. The conservation of angular momentum helps explain many observed phenomena, for example the increase in rotational speed of a spinning [[figure skater]] as the skater's arms are contracted, the high rotational rates of [[neutron star]]s, the [[Coriolis effect]], and the [[precession]] of [[gyroscope]]s. In general, conservation does limit the possible motion of a system, but does not uniquely determine what the exact motion is.\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], angular momentum (like other quantities) is expressed as an [[operator (physics)|operator]]<!-- note that [[angular momentum operator]] is linked from [[#In quantum mechanics]]-->, and its one-dimensional projections have [[point spectrum|quantized eigenvalues]]. Angular momentum is subject to the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], implying that at any time, only one [[vector projection|projection]] (also called \"component\") can be measured with definite precision; the other two then remain uncertain. Because of this, it turns out that the notion of a quantum particle literally \"spinning\" about an axis does not exist. Nevertheless, elementary particles still possess a spin angular momentum, but this angular momentum does not correspond to spinning motion in the ordinary sense.<ref>{{cite book |title=Understanding the Properties of Matter |edition=2nd, illustrated, revised |first1=Michael |last1=de Podesta |publisher=CRC Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-415-25788-6 |page=29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ya-4enCDoWQC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=ya-4enCDoWQC&pg=PA29 Extract of page 29]</ref>\n\n==In classical mechanics==\n=== Definition ===\n{{Main|Scalar (physics)|Euclidean vector}}\n\n==== Orbital angular momentum in two dimensions ====\n[[File:Ang mom 2d.png|right|thumb|[[Velocity]] of the [[particle]] ''m'' with respect to the origin ''O'' can be resolved into components parallel to (''v''<sub>\u2225</sub>) and perpendicular to (''v''<sub>\u22a5</sub>) the radius vector ''r''.

For instance, a particle of matter at the outer edge of a wheel is, in effect, at the end of a [[lever]] of the same length as the wheel's radius, its momentum turning the lever about the center point. This imaginary lever is known as the ''moment arm''.

If the net force on some body is directed always toward some point, the ''center'', then there is no torque on the body with respect to the center, as all of the force is directed along the [[Position (vector)|radius vector]], and none is [[perpendicular]] to the radius. Mathematically, torque <math>\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{0}, </math> because in this case <math>\\mathbf{r}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{F}</math> are parallel vectors. Therefore, the angular momentum of the body about the center is constant. This is the case with [[gravity|gravitational attraction]] in the [[orbit]]s of [[planet]]s and [[satellite]]s, where the gravitational force is always directed toward the primary body and orbiting bodies conserve angular momentum by exchanging distance and velocity as they move about the primary. Central force motion is also used in the analysis of the [[Bohr model]] of the [[atom]].\n\nFor a planet, angular momentum is distributed between the spin of the planet and its revolution in its orbit, and these are often exchanged by various mechanisms. The conservation of angular momentum in the [[Lunar theory|Earth\u2013Moon system]] results in the transfer of angular momentum from Earth to Moon, due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal torque]] the Moon exerts on the Earth. This in turn results in the slowing down of the rotation rate of Earth, at about 65.7 nanoseconds per day,<ref>{{cite journal\n| title =Long-term changes in the rotation of the earth \u2013 700 B.C. to A.D. 1980\n|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\n|volume = 313\n| issue =1524\n| last1 =Stephenson\n| first1 =F.

This causes the [[Spinning top|top]] to [[precess]].]]\n\nThe conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an [[Ice skating|ice skater]] as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of the mass of her body closer to the axis, she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is the product of [[moment of inertia]] and [[angular velocity]], if the angular momentum remains constant (is conserved), then the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater must increase.\n\nThe same phenomenon results in extremely fast spin of compact stars (like [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s) when they are formed out of much larger and slower rotating stars. Decrease in the size of an object ''n'' times results in increase of its angular velocity by the factor of ''n''<sup>2</sup>.\n\nConservation is not always a full explanation for the dynamics of a system but is a key constraint. For example, a spinning [[top]] is subject to gravitational torque making it lean over and change the angular momentum about the [[nutation]] axis, but neglecting friction at the point of spinning contact, it has a conserved angular momentum about its spinning axis, and another about its [[precession]] axis. Also, in any [[planetary system]], the planets, star(s), comets, and asteroids can all move in numerous complicated ways, but only so that the angular momentum of the system is conserved.\n\n[[Noether's theorem]] states that every [[conservation law]] is associated with a [[symmetry]] (invariant) of the underlying physics. The symmetry associated with conservation of angular momentum is [[rotational invariance]]. The fact that the physics of a system is unchanged if it is rotated by any angle about an axis implies that angular momentum is conserved.<ref>{{cite book| title=The classical theory of fields|series=Course of Theoretical Physics|first1= L.

This has the advantage of a clearer geometric interpretation as a plane element, defined from the '''x''' and '''p''' vectors, and the expression is true in any number of dimensions (two or higher). In Cartesian coordinates:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathbf{L} &= \\left(xp_y - yp_x\\right)\\mathbf{e}_x \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_y + \\left(yp_z - zp_y\\right)\\mathbf{e}_y \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_z + \\left(zp_x - xp_z\\right)\\mathbf{e}_z \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_x\\\\\n             &= L_{xy}\\mathbf{e}_x \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_y + L_{yz}\\mathbf{e}_y \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_z + L_{zx}\\mathbf{e}_z \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_x \\,,\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nor more compactly in index notation:\n\n:<math>L_{ij} = x_i p_j - x_j p_i\\,.</math>\n\nThe angular velocity can also be defined as an antisymmetric second order tensor, with components ''\u03c9<sub>ij</sub>''. The relation between the two antisymmetric tensors is given by the moment of inertia which must now be a fourth order tensor:<ref>Synge and Schild, Tensor calculus, Dover publications, 1978 edition, p. 161. {{ISBN|978-0-486-63612-2}}.</ref>\n\n:<math>L_{ij} = I_{ijk\\ell} \\omega_{k\\ell} \\,. </math>\n\nAgain, this equation in '''L''' and '''\u03c9''' as tensors is true in any number of dimensions. This equation also appears in the [[geometric algebra]] formalism, in which '''L''' and '''\u03c9''' are bivectors, and the moment of inertia is a mapping between them.\n\nIn [[relativistic mechanics]], the [[relativistic angular momentum]] of a particle is expressed as an [[antisymmetric tensor]] of second order:\n\n:<math>M_{\\alpha\\beta} = X_\\alpha P_\\beta - X_\\beta P_\\alpha</math>\n\nin the language of [[four-vector]]s, namely the [[Four-position|four position]] ''X'' and the [[four momentum]] ''P'', and absorbs the above '''L''' together with the motion of the [[centre of mass]] of the particle.\n\nIn each of the above cases, for a system of particles, the total angular momentum is just the sum of the individual particle angular momenta, and the centre of mass is for the system.\n\n== In quantum mechanics ==\n{{Main|Angular momentum operator}}\nAngular momentum in [[quantum mechanics]] differs in many profound respects from angular momentum in [[classical mechanics]].

'''L''' is then an [[Operator (physics)|operator]], specifically called the ''[[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum operator]]''. The components of the angular momentum operator satisfy the commutation relations of the Lie algebra so(3). Indeed, these operators are precisely the infinitesimal action of the rotation group on the quantum Hilbert space.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 17.3</ref> (See also the discussion below of the angular momentum operators as the generators of rotations.)\n\nHowever, in quantum physics, there is another type of angular momentum, called ''[[spin (physics)|spin angular momentum]]'', represented by the spin operator '''S'''. Almost all [[elementary particle]]s have spin. Spin is often depicted as a particle literally spinning around an axis, but this is a misleading and inaccurate picture: spin is an intrinsic property of a particle, unrelated to any sort of motion in space and fundamentally different from orbital angular momentum. All [[elementary particle]]s have a characteristic spin, for example [[electron]]s have \"spin 1/2\" (this actually means \"spin [[reduced Planck constant|\u0127]]/2\") while [[photon]]s have \"spin 1\" (this actually means \"spin \u0127\").\n\nFinally, there is [[total angular momentum]] '''J''', which combines both the spin and orbital angular momentum of all particles and fields. (For one particle, '''J''' = '''L''' + '''S'''.) [[Conservation of angular momentum]] applies to '''J''', but not to '''L''' or '''S'''; for example, the [[spin\u2013orbit interaction]] allows angular momentum to transfer back and forth between '''L''' and '''S''', with the total remaining constant. Electrons and photons need not have integer-based values for total angular momentum, but can also have fractional values.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1501748|pmid=28861467|title=There are many ways to spin a photon: Half-quantization of a total optical angular momentum|journal=Science Advances|volume=2|issue=4|pages=e1501748|year=2016|last1=Ballantine|first1=K.

A standing wave like this can have 0,1,2, or any integer number of wavelengths around the circle, but it ''cannot'' have a non-integer number of wavelengths like 8.3. In quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized for a similar reason.]]\n(There are additional restrictions as well, see [[angular momentum operator]] for details.)\n\nThe [[reduced Planck constant]] <math>\\hbar</math> is tiny by everyday standards, about 10<sup>\u221234</sup> [[Joule-second|J s]], and therefore this quantization does not noticeably affect the angular momentum of macroscopic objects. However, it is very important in the microscopic world. For example, the structure of [[electron shell]]s and subshells in chemistry is significantly affected by the quantization of angular momentum.\n\nQuantization of angular momentum was first postulated by [[Niels Bohr]] in his [[Bohr model]] of the atom and was later predicted by [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] in his [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation#Quantization|Schr\u00f6dinger equation]].\n\n=== Uncertainty ===\nIn the definition <math>\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{r}\\times\\mathbf{p}</math>, six operators are involved: The [[position operator]]s <math>r_x</math>, <math>r_y</math>, <math>r_z</math>, and the [[momentum operator]]s <math>p_x</math>, <math>p_y</math>, <math>p_z</math>. However, the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] tells us that it is not possible for all six of these quantities to be known simultaneously with arbitrary precision. Therefore, there are limits to what can be known or measured about a particle's angular momentum. It turns out that the best that one can do is to simultaneously measure both the angular momentum vector's [[magnitude (vector)|magnitude]] and its component along one axis.\n\nThe uncertainty is closely related to the fact that different components of an [[angular momentum operator]] do not [[commutator|commute]], for example <math>L_xL_y \\neq L_yL_x</math>. (For the precise [[commutation relation]]s, see [[angular momentum operator]].)\n\n=== Total angular momentum as generator of rotations ===\nAs mentioned above, orbital angular momentum '''L''' is defined as in classical mechanics: <math>\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{r}\\times\\mathbf{p}</math>, but ''total'' angular momentum '''J''' is defined in a different, more basic way: '''J''' is defined as the \"generator of rotations\".<ref name=littlejohn>{{cite web|url=http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/1011/notes/spinrot.pdf|authorlink1=Robert Grayson Littlejohn|title= Lecture notes on rotations in quantum mechanics|first= Robert |last=Littlejohn|accessdate= 13 Jan 2012|work=Physics 221B Spring 2011|year=2011}}</ref> More specifically, '''J''' is defined so that the operator\n:<math>R(\\hat{n},\\phi) \\equiv \\exp\\left(-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\phi\\, \\mathbf{J}\\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}\\right)</math>\nis the [[Rotation operator (quantum mechanics)|rotation operator]] that takes any system and rotates it by angle <math>\\phi</math> about the axis <math>\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}</math>. (The \"exp\" in the formula refers to [[matrix exponential|operator exponential]]) To put this the other way around, whatever our quantum Hilbert space is, we expect that the [[rotation group SO(3)]] will act on it. There is then an associated action of the Lie algebra so(3) of SO(3); the operators describing the action of so(3) on our Hilbert space are the (total) angular momentum operators.\n\nThe relationship between the angular momentum operator and the rotation operators is the same as the relationship between [[Lie algebra]]s and [[Lie group]]s in mathematics. The close relationship between angular momentum and rotations is reflected in [[Noether's theorem]] that proves that angular momentum is conserved whenever the laws of physics are rotationally invariant.\n\n== In electrodynamics ==\n{{See also|Momentum#Particle in field|l1=Momentum (Particle in field)}}\n\nWhen describing the motion of a [[charged particle]] in an [[electromagnetic field]], the [[canonical momentum]] '''P''' (derived from the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] for this system) is not [[gauge invariant]]. As a consequence, the canonical angular momentum '''L''' = '''r''' \u00d7 '''P''' is not gauge invariant either. Instead, the momentum that is physical, the so-called ''kinetic momentum'' (used throughout this article), is (in [[SI units]])\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{p} = m\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{P} - e \\mathbf{A} </math>\n\nwhere ''e'' is the [[electric charge]] of the particle and '''A''' the [[magnetic vector potential]] of the electromagnetic field.

This had been known since [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] expounded his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|second law of planetary motion]]. Newton derived a unique geometric proof, and went on to show that the attractive force of the Sun's [[gravity]] was the cause of all of Kepler's laws.\n\nDuring the first interval of time, an object is in motion from point '''A''' to point '''B'''. Undisturbed, it would continue to point '''c''' during the second interval. When the object arrives at '''B''', it receives an impulse directed toward point '''S'''. The impulse gives it a small added velocity toward '''S''', such that if this were its only velocity, it would move from '''B''' to '''V''' during the second interval. By the [[Parallelogram of force|rules of velocity composition]], these two velocities add, and point '''C''' is found by construction of parallelogram '''BcCV'''. Thus the object's path is deflected by the impulse so that it arrives at point '''C''' at the end of the second interval. Because the triangles '''SBc''' and '''SBC''' have the same base '''SB''' and the same height '''Bc''' or '''VC''', they have the same area. By symmetry, triangle '''SBc''' also has the same area as triangle '''SAB''', therefore the object has swept out equal areas '''SAB''' and '''SBC''' in equal times.\n\nAt point '''C''', the object receives another impulse toward '''S''', again deflecting its path during the third interval from '''d''' to '''D'''. Thus it continues to '''E''' and beyond, the triangles '''SAB''', '''SBc''', '''SBC''', '''SCd''', '''SCD''', '''SDe''', '''SDE''' all having the same area. Allowing the time intervals to become ever smaller, the path '''ABCDE''' approaches indefinitely close to a continuous curve.\n\nNote that because this derivation is geometric, and no specific force is applied, it proves a more general law than Kepler's second law of planetary motion. It shows that the Law of Areas applies to any central force, attractive or repulsive, continuous or non-continuous, or zero.\n\n==== Conservation of angular momentum in the Law of Areas ====\nThe proportionality of angular momentum to the area swept out by a moving object can be understood by realizing that the bases of the triangles, that is, the lines from '''S''' to the object, are equivalent to the [[Angular momentum#Scalar \u2013 angular momentum in two dimensions|radius {{math|<var>r</var>}}]], and that the heights of the triangles are proportional to the perpendicular component of [[Angular momentum#Scalar \u2013 angular momentum in two dimensions|velocity {{math|<VAR>v</var><sub>\u22a5</sub>}}]]. Hence, if the area swept per unit time is constant, then by the triangular area formula {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}(base)(height)}}, the product {{math|(base)(height)}} and therefore the product {{math|<VAR>rv</var><sub>\u22a5</sub>}} are constant: if {{math|<VAR>r</var>}} and the base length are decreased, {{math|<VAR>v</var><sub>\u22a5</sub>}} and height must increase proportionally. Mass is constant, therefore [[Angular momentum#Scalar \u2013 angular momentum in two dimensions|angular momentum {{math|<VAR>rmv</var><sub>\u22a5</sub>}}]] is conserved by this exchange of distance and velocity.\n\nIn the case of triangle '''SBC''', area is equal to {{sfrac|1|2}}('''SB''')('''VC'''). Wherever '''C''' is eventually located due to the impulse applied at '''B''', the product ('''SB''')('''VC'''), and therefore {{math|<VAR>rmv</var><sub>\u22a5</sub>}} remain constant. Similarly so for each of the triangles.\n\n=== After Newton ===\n[[Leonhard Euler]], [[Daniel Bernoulli]], and [[Patrick d'Arcy]] all understood angular momentum in terms of conservation of [[areal velocity]], a result of their analysis of Kepler's second law of planetary motion. It is unlikely that they realized the implications for ordinary rotating matter.<ref>see {{cite web\n|url=http://weatherglass.de/PDFs/Angular_momentum.pdf\n|last=Borrelli\n|first=Arianna\n|date=2011\n|title=Angular momentum between physics and mathematics}} for an excellent and detailed summary of the concept of angular momentum through history.</ref>\n\nIn 1736 Euler, like Newton, touched on some of the equations of angular momentum in his ''[[Mechanica]]'' without further developing them.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/mechanica1.html\n|title=Euler : Mechanica Vol. 1\n|last=Bruce\n|first=Ian\n|date=2008}}</ref>\n\nBernoulli wrote in a 1744 letter of a \"moment of rotational motion\", possibly the first conception of angular momentum as we now understand it.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://eulerarchive.maa.org/correspondence/letters/OO0153.pdf\n|title=Euler's Correspondence with Daniel Bernoulli, Bernoulli to Euler, 04 February, 1744|website=The Euler Archive}}</ref>\n\nIn 1799, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] first realized that a fixed plane was associated with rotation\u2014his ''[[invariable plane]]''.\n\n[[Louis Poinsot]] in 1803 began representing rotations as a line segment perpendicular to the rotation, and elaborated on the \"conservation of moments\".\n\nIn 1852 [[L\u00e9on Foucault]] used a [[gyroscope]] in an experiment to display the Earth's rotation.\n\n[[William John Macquorn Rankine|William J.

{"title_page": "Biolinguistics", "text_new": "{{short description|The study of the biology and evolution of language}}\n[[File:Palmarini Pio Manz\u00f9.jpg|thumb|Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini]]\n'''Biolinguistics''' can be defined as the study of biology and the evolution of language. It is a highly interdisciplinary as it related to various fields such as [[biology]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and [[neurolinguistics]] to explain the formation of language. It is important as it seeks to yield a framework by which we can understand the fundamentals of the faculty of language. This field was first introduced by Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini, professor of Linguistics and Cognitive Science at the [[University of Arizona]]. It was first introduced in 1971, at an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). Biolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\". Hacettepe \u00fcniversitesi E\u011fitim Fak\u00fcltesi \u00d6\u011fretim \u00fcyesi.  https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/88422</ref> Chomsky and Lenneberg militated against it by arguing for the innate knowledge of language. Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which being that language acquisition is biologically constrained. These works were regarded as pioneers in the shaping of biolinguistic thought, in what was the beginning of a change in paradigm in the study of language.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martins |first1=Pedro Tiago |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics |journal=Linguistics Vanguard |date=27 August 2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007 }}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Darwin.jpg|thumb]]\n[[Darwinism]] inspired many researchers to study language, in particular the evolution of language, mainly by means of biology. Darwins theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions i) Whether individuals undergo something like selection as they evolve, and ii) selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, weather the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power or just one of the several contributing causes. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>Dating all the way back to 1821, German linguist August Scheilurer was the representative pioneer of biolinguistics, discussing the evolution of language based on Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from German linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]]. Darwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars much as Max M\u00fcller by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, also stimulates brain development, enabling long trains of though and strengthening power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and variation, and remarking on how each development gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\nThe first phase in the development of biolinguistics runs through the late 1960's with the publicaiton of Lennberg's Biological Foundation of Language (1967). The range of topics under active investigation on the biology of language during this period included: language acquisition, genetics of language disorders (dyslexia, specific lanuage disabilities, deaf children), and the evolution of language. During the first phase work was carried out in three specific areas; language, development of language, and, evolution of language. The greatest progress was made in the area regarding the specifying the notion on language. \n\nThe first official biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

In 1976 Chomsky formulated the fundamental questions of biolingusitcs as follows: i) function, ii) structure, iii) physical basis, iv) development in the individual, v) evolutionary development. In the late 1980's a great deal of progress was made in answering  question about the development of language. This then prompted further questions about language design. function, and, the evolution of language.  \nThe following year, Juan Uriagereka, a graduate student of Howard Lasnik, wrote the introductory text to Minimalist Syntax, Rhyme and Reason. Their work renewed interest in biolinguistics, catalysing many linguists to look into biolinguistics with their colleagues in adjacent scientific disciplines.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Di Sciullo |first1=Anna Maria |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=The Biolinguistic Enterprise: New Perspectives on the Evolution and Nature of the Human Language Faculty Volume 1 of Oxford Studies in Biolinguistics |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press, 2011 |isbn=9780199553273 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6REUDAAAQBAJ&dq=origins+of+biolinguistics}}</ref> Both Jenkins and Uriagereka stressed the importance of addressing the emergence of the language faculty in humans. At around the same time, [[geneticist]]s discovered a link between the language deficit manifest by the [[KE family]] members and the gene [[FOXP2]].

While Professor [[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]] claims that the interdisciplinary research of biology and linguistics in the 1950s-1960s led to the rise of biolinguistics. Furthermore, Jenkins believes that biolinguistics was the outcome of transformational grammarians studying human linguistic and biological mechanism. On the other hand, linguists [[Martin Nowak]] and [[Charles Yang (linguist)|Charles Yang]] argue that biolinguistics, originating in the 1970s, is distinct transformational grammar; rather a new branch of the linguistics-biology research paradigm initiated by transformational grammar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Jieqiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\n\n=== Chomsky's Theories ===\n \n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values).

The [[Language Acquisition Device]] (LAD) was \u00a0presented as an innate structure in humans which enabled language learning. Individuals are thought to be \u201cwired\u201d with universal grammar rules enabling them to understand and evaluate complex syntactic structures. Proponents of the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being exposed to a rich linguistic environment. Later, Chomsky exchanged this notion instead for that of Universal Grammar, providing evidence for a biological basis of language. \n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995.

Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]]</ref> \nThe program further aims to develop ideas involving the [[economy of derivation]] and [[economy of representation]], which had started to become an independent theory in the early 1990s, but were then still considered as peripherals of [[transformational grammar]].<ref>For a full description of the checking mechanism see [[David Adger|Adger, David]]. 2003. ''Core Syntax. A Minimalist Approach''. Oxford: Oxford University Press; and also Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Blackwell Publishers</ref> \n\nThe [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]] operation is used by Chomsky to explain the structure of syntax trees within the Minimalist program.  Merge itself is a process which provides the basis of phrasal formation as a result of taking two element within a phrase and combining them<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sciullo|first=Anna Maria Di|last2=Isac|first2=Daniela|date=2008-09-30|title=The Asymmetry of Merge|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/53|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=260\u2013290|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> In A.M. Di Sciullo & D. Isac's ''The Asymmetry of Merge'' (2008), they highlight the two key bases of Merge by Chomsky;\n\n* Merge is binary\n* Merge is recursive\n\nIn order to understand this, take the following sentence:  ''Emma dislikes pies''\n\nThis phrase can be broken down into its lexical items: \n\n[VP [DP Emma] [V' [V dislikes] [DP [D the] [NP pie]]]\n\nThe above phrasal representation allows for an understanding of each lexical item. In order to build a tree using Merge, using bottom-up formation the two final element of the phrase are selected and then combined to form a new element on the tree. In image a) you can see that the determiner ''the'' and the Noun Phrase ''pie''  are both selected. Through the process of Merge, the new formed element on the tree is the determiner Phrase (DP) which holds, ''the pie,'' which is visible in b).  <gallery>\nFile:The pie.png|a) Selection of the final two element of the phrase\nFile:DP the pie.png|b) The two selected elements are then \"merged\" and they produce one new constituent, known as the Determiner Phrase (DP)\nFile:Dislikes the pie.png|c) Selection of DP ''the pie'' with V ''dislikes''\nFile:V bar dslikesthepie.png|d) Merge operation has occurred, yielded new element on tree, V' (V-bar) \nFile:Emma dislikes the pie.png|e) Selection of V' ''dislikes the pie a''nd DP subject ''Emma''\nFile:Ling pie tree.png|f) Merge operation has undergone, yielded new element on tree; VP\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn a minimalist approach, there are three core components of the language faculty proposed: Sensory-Motor system (SM), Conceptual-Intentional system (CI), and Narrow Syntax (NS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Di Sciullo |display-authors=etal |first=Anna Maria|date=Winter 2010|title=The Biological Nature of Human Language|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88c9/74fedaf9adb067941d98debad51e8c84be02.pdf|journal=Biolinguistics|volume=4|pages=|via=}}</ref> SM includes biological requisites for language production and perception, such as articulatory organs, and CI meets the biological requirements related to inference, interpretation, and reasoning, those involved in other cognitive functions. As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of The Faculty of Language be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|archivedate=2007-02-21|accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. [[Natural law|Natural Law]] in this case would provide insight on concepts such as binary branching in syntactic trees and well as the Merge operation. This would translate to thinking it in terms of taking two elements on a syntax tree and such that their sum yields another element that falls below on the given syntax tree (Refer to trees above in ''Minimalist Program''). By adhering to this sum of two elements that precede it, provides support for binary structures. Furthermore, the possibility of ternary branching would deviate from the Fibonacci sequence and consequently wold not hold as strong support to the relevance of Natural Law in syntax.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2008-03-25|title=On the Nature of Syntax|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/9|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=196\u2013224|issn=1450-3417}}</ref>\n\n==== Biolinguistics: Challenging the Usage-Based Approach ====\nAs mentioned above, biolinguistics challenges the idea that the acquisition of language is a result of behavior based learning. This alternative approach the biolinguistics challenges is known as the usage-based (UB) approach. UB supports that idea that knowledge of human language is acquired via exposure and usage <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ibbotson|first=Paul|date=2013|title=The Scope of Usage-Based Theory|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255/full#B163|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255|issn=1664-1078|doi-access=free}}</ref>.

In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. This intergration of other fields to explain language is recognized as the ''strong'' view in biolinguistics<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boeckx|first=Cedric|last2=Grohmann|first2=Kleanthes K.|date=2007|title=The BIOLINGUISTICS Manifesto|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/26|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=1|pages=001\u2013008|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. He suggested that this organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Recent Developments ==\n'''Generative Procedure Accepted At Present & Its Developments'''\n\nIn biolinguistics, language is recognised to be based on recursive generative procedure that retrieves words from the lexicon and applies them repeatedly to output phrases. This generative procedure was hypothesised to be a result of a minor brain mutation due to evidence that word ordering is limited to externalisation and plays no role in core syntax or semantics. Thus, different lines of inquiry to explain this were explored. \n\nThe most commonly accepted line of inquiry to explain this is [[Noam Chomsky]]'s minimalist approach to syntactic representations. In 2016, Chomsky and Berwick defined the [[minimalist program]] under the Strong Minimalist Thesis in their book ''Why Only Us'' by saying that language is mandated by efficient computations and, thus, keeps to the simplest recursive operations. The main basic operation in the minimalist program is [[Merge (linguistics)|merge]]. Under merge there are two ways in which larger expressions can be constructed: externally and internally. Lexical items that are merged externally build argument representations with disjoint constituents. The internal merge creates constituent structures where one is a part of another. This induces [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], the capacity to pronounce phrases in one position, but interpret them elsewhere. \n\nRecent investigations of displacement concur to a slight rewiring in cortical brain regions that could have occurred historically and perpetuated generative grammar. Upkeeping this line of thought, in 2009, Ramus and Fishers speculated that a single gene could create a signalling molecule to facilitate new brain connections or a new area of the brain altogether via prenatally defined brain regions. This would result in information processing greatly important to language, as we know it. The spread of this advantage trait could be responsible for secondary externalisation and the interaction we engage in.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/why-only-us|title=Why Only Us {{!}} The MIT Press|last=Press|first=The MIT|website=mitpress.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> If this holds, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n''' Human versus Animal Communication '''\n\nCompared to other topics in linguistics where data can be displayed with evidence cross-linguistically, due to the nature of biolinguistics, and that it is apply to the entirety of linguistics rather than just a specific subsection, examining other species can assist in providing this data. Although animals do not have the same linguistic competencies as humans, is it assumed that they can provide evidence for some linguistic competence. Over the last twenty five years, clarifications on the fundamental features of human language have been carried out, which has at the same time, deepened knowledge on the communicative abilities and cognitive processes of non-human animal. [[Animal communication]] can be defined in general terms, the transfer of information by an animal that proves a change in the behaviour of the receiver of the information <ref> Preece, K., & Beekman, M. (2014). Honeybee waggle dance error: Adaption or constraint? Unravelling the complex dance language of honeybees. Animal Behaviour, 94, 19-26 </ref> The concept that has been claimed as the main factor of human language is the syntactic operation of the centre-embedded recursion <ref> Bar\u00f3n Birchenall, Leonardo. (2016). Animal communication and human language: An overview. International journal of comparative psychology / ISCP; sponsored by the International Society for Comparative Psychology and the University of Calabria. 29. 1-27 </ref>.  Non-human primates (NHP) know a lot about their environment, however they seem to be unable to intentionally communication this knowledge to others, at least through vocalizations. Overall, animal communicative abilities appear to be highly restricted to survival matters. Additionally, non-human animals apparently do not intend to convey information to others when communicating. Comparing animal language to human language acquisition, in regards to repertoire of elements used for communicative purposes (sounds or signs), the \u201cvocabulary\u201d of animals does not get anywhere close to that of humans. By the age of three years old, a neurotypical child produces an estimate of 500 different words, and can comprehend at least double that <ref> Gershkoff-Stowe, L., & Hahn, E. (2007). Fast mapping skills in the developing lexicon. Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research, 50, 682-697 </ref>. An average adult, graduated from university has a repertoire of about 20,000 word families. In comparison the animal with the largest repertoire, the common nightingale includes 200 different elements <ref> Colbert-White, E., Corballis, M., & Fragaszy, D. (2014). Where apes and songbirds are left behind: A comparative assessment of the requisites for speech. Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews, 9, 1-28 </ref>. Elements of language acquisition that are found within human languages such as a lexical explosion period or [[fast mapping]] do not seem apparent within non-human animals. It is possible that the phylogenetic development of human language relies on ancient perceptual capacities already present in birds and some mammals. Those capacities would have converged at a certain point of the evolution with skills for structural organization and conceptual abstraction, already existent in humans, and not necessarily present in the species of which perceptual abilities were inherited <ref> Heimbauer, A. (2012). Investigating speech perception in evolutionary perspective: Comparisons of chimpanzee (Pantroglodytes) and human capabilities (Unpublished doctoral dissertation). Georgia State University, Georgia </ref>. Human language ability is constituted by a multiplicity of factors, which are shared to one degree or another with other species. \n\n'''Relevant Biological & Evolutionary Research'''\n\nThe relatively new science of [[Evolutionary developmental biology|evo-devo]] that suggests everyone is a common descendant from a single tree has opened pathways into gene and biochemical study. One way in which this manifested within biolinguistics is through the suggestion of a common language gene, namely [[FOXP2|FOXP2.]] Though this gene is subject to debate, there have been interesting recent discoveries made concerning it and the part it plays in the secondary externalization process. Recent studies of birds and mice resulted in an emerging consensus that FOXP2 is not a blueprint for internal syntax nor the narrow faculty of language, but rather makes up the regulatory machinery pertaining to the process of externalization. The fact that it has been found to assists sequencing sound or gesture one after the next, hence implying that FOXP2 helps transfer knowledge from declarative to procedural memory. Therefore, FOXP2 has been discovered to be an aid in formulating a linguistic\u00a0 input-output system that runs smoothly.\n\n==Critiques==\n'''Alternative Theoretical Approaches'''\n\nStemming from the usage-based approach, the [[Competition Model]], developed by [[Elizabeth Bates]] and [[Brian MacWhinney]], views language acquisition as consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon a linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues with the use of competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nFrom the side of [[biosemiotics]], the has been a recent claim that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language. This meaning-making consists internal and external cognitive processes. Thus, it holds that such process organisation could not have only given a rise to language alone. According to this perspective all living things possess these processes, regardless of how wide the variation, as a posed to species-specific.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

The weak is founded on theoretical linguistics that is generativist in persuasion. On the other hand, the strong stream goes beyond the commonly explored theoretical linguistics, with an oriented towards biology, as well as other relevant fields of study.\u00a0 Since the early emergence of biolinguistics to its present day, there has been a focused mainly on the weak stream, seeing little difference between the inquiry into generative linguistics and the biological nature of language as well as heavily relying on the Chomskyan origin of the term.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Martins|first=Pedro Tiago|last2=Boeckx|first2=Cedric|date=2016-12-01|title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/lingvan/open-issue/article-10.1515-lingvan-2016-0007/article-10.1515-lingvan-2016-0007.xml|journal=Linguistics Vanguard|language=en|volume=-1|issue=open-issue|doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007}}</ref> \n\nAs expressed by research professor and linguist Cedric Boeckx, it is a prevalent opinion that biolinguistics need to focus on biology as to give substance to the linguistic theorizing this field has engaged in. Particular criticisms mentioned\u00a0 include a lack of distinction between generative linguistics and biolinguistics, lack of discoveries pertaining to properties of grammar in the context of biology, and lack of recognition for the importance broader mechanisms, such as  biological non-linguistic properties. After all, it is only advantage to label propensity for language as biological if such insight is used towards a research.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has additionally noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem.'' Due to this different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Poeppel|first=David|title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones|last2=Embick|first2=David|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|year=2005|editor=Anne Cutler|chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience}}</ref>\n\nA recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general was developed by Prakash Mondal who shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representational character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

It is a highly interdisciplinary as it related to various fields such as [[biology]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and [[neurolinguistics]] to explain the formation of language. It is important as it seeks to yield a framework by which we can understand the fundamentals of the faculty of language. This field was first introduced by Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini, professor of Linguistics and Cognitive Science at the [[University of Arizona]]. It was first introduced in 1971, at an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). Biolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\".

Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which being that language acquisition is biologically constrained. These works were regarded as pioneers in the shaping of biolinguistic thought, in what was the beginning of a change in paradigm in the study of language.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martins |first1=Pedro Tiago |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics |journal=Linguistics Vanguard |date=27 August 2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007 }}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Darwin.jpg|thumb]]\n[[Darwinism]] inspired many researchers to study language, in particular the evolution of language, mainly by means of biology. Darwins theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions i) Whether individuals undergo something like selection as they evolve, and ii) selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, weather the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power or just one of the several contributing causes. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>Dating all the way back to 1821, German linguist August Scheilurer was the representative pioneer of biolinguistics, discussing the evolution of language based on Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from German linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]]. Darwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars much as Max M\u00fcller by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, also stimulates brain development, enabling long trains of though and strengthening power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and variation, and remarking on how each development gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\nThe first phase in the development of biolinguistics runs through the late 1960's with the publicaiton of Lennberg's Biological Foundation of Language (1967). The range of topics under active investigation on the biology of language during this period included: language acquisition, genetics of language disorders (dyslexia, specific lanuage disabilities, deaf children), and the evolution of language. During the first phase work was carried out in three specific areas; language, development of language, and, evolution of language. The greatest progress was made in the area regarding the specifying the notion on language. \n\nThe first official biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

This then prompted further questions about language design. function, and, the evolution of language.  \nThe following year, Juan Uriagereka, a graduate student of Howard Lasnik, wrote the introductory text to Minimalist Syntax, Rhyme and Reason.

On the other hand, linguists [[Martin Nowak]] and [[Charles Yang (linguist)|Charles Yang]] argue that biolinguistics, originating in the 1970s, is distinct transformational grammar; rather a new branch of the linguistics-biology research paradigm initiated by transformational grammar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Jieqiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\n\n=== Chomsky's Theories ===\n \n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values).

The [[Language Acquisition Device]] (LAD) was \u00a0presented as an innate structure in humans which enabled language learning. Individuals are thought to be \u201cwired\u201d with universal grammar rules enabling them to understand and evaluate complex syntactic structures. Proponents of the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being exposed to a rich linguistic environment. Later, Chomsky exchanged this notion instead for that of Universal Grammar, providing evidence for a biological basis of language. \n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995.

Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]]</ref> \nThe program further aims to develop ideas involving the [[economy of derivation]] and [[economy of representation]], which had started to become an independent theory in the early 1990s, but were then still considered as peripherals of [[transformational grammar]].<ref>For a full description of the checking mechanism see [[David Adger|Adger, David]]. 2003. ''Core Syntax. A Minimalist Approach''. Oxford: Oxford University Press; and also Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Blackwell Publishers</ref> \n\nThe [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]] operation is used by Chomsky to explain the structure of syntax trees within the Minimalist program.  Merge itself is a process which provides the basis of phrasal formation as a result of taking two element within a phrase and combining them<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sciullo|first=Anna Maria Di|last2=Isac|first2=Daniela|date=2008-09-30|title=The Asymmetry of Merge|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/53|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=260\u2013290|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> In A.M. Di Sciullo & D. Isac's ''The Asymmetry of Merge'' (2008), they highlight the two key bases of Merge by Chomsky;\n\n* Merge is binary\n* Merge is recursive\n\nIn order to understand this, take the following sentence:  ''Emma dislikes pies''\n\nThis phrase can be broken down into its lexical items: \n\n[VP [DP Emma] [V' [V dislikes] [DP [D the] [NP pie]]]\n\nThe above phrasal representation allows for an understanding of each lexical item. In order to build a tree using Merge, using bottom-up formation the two final element of the phrase are selected and then combined to form a new element on the tree. In image a) you can see that the determiner ''the'' and the Noun Phrase ''pie''  are both selected. Through the process of Merge, the new formed element on the tree is the determiner Phrase (DP) which holds, ''the pie,'' which is visible in b).  <gallery>\nFile:The pie.png|a) Selection of the final two element of the phrase\nFile:DP the pie.png|b) The two selected elements are then \"merged\" and they produce one new constituent, known as the Determiner Phrase (DP)\nFile:Dislikes the pie.png|c) Selection of DP ''the pie'' with V ''dislikes''\nFile:V bar dslikesthepie.png|d) Merge operation has occurred, yielded new element on tree, V' (V-bar) \nFile:Emma dislikes the pie.png|e) Selection of V' ''dislikes the pie a''nd DP subject ''Emma''\nFile:Ling pie tree.png|f) Merge operation has undergone, yielded new element on tree; VP\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn a minimalist approach, there are three core components of the language faculty proposed: Sensory-Motor system (SM), Conceptual-Intentional system (CI), and Narrow Syntax (NS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Di Sciullo |display-authors=etal |first=Anna Maria|date=Winter 2010|title=The Biological Nature of Human Language|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88c9/74fedaf9adb067941d98debad51e8c84be02.pdf|journal=Biolinguistics|volume=4|pages=|via=}}</ref> SM includes biological requisites for language production and perception, such as articulatory organs, and CI meets the biological requirements related to inference, interpretation, and reasoning, those involved in other cognitive functions. As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of The Faculty of Language be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|archivedate=2007-02-21|accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. Natural Law in this case would provide insight on concepts such as binary branching in syntactic trees. This would translate to thinking it in terms of taking two elements on a syntax tree and such that their sum yields another element that falls below on the given syntax tree. By adhering to this sum of two elements that precede it, provides support for binary structures. Furthermore, the possibility of ternary branching would deviate from the Fibonacci sequence and consequently wold not hold as strong support to the relevance of Natural Law in syntax.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2008-03-25|title=On the Nature of Syntax|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/9|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=196\u2013224|issn=1450-3417}}</ref>\n\n==== Biolinguistics: Challenging the Usage-Based Approach ====\nAs mentioned above, biolinguistics challenges the idea that the acquisition of language is a result of behavior based learning. This alternative approach the biolinguistics challenges is known as the usage-based (UB) approach. UB supports that idea that knowledge of human language is acquired via exposure and usage <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ibbotson|first=Paul|date=2013|title=The Scope of Usage-Based Theory|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255/full#B163|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255|issn=1664-1078|doi-access=free}}</ref>. One of the primary issues that is highlighted when arguing against the Usage-Based approach, is that UB fails to address the issue of poverty of stimulus<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ghalebi|first=Rezvan|last2=Sadighi|first2=Firooz|date=2015-08-06|title=The Usage-based Theory of Language Acquisition: A review of Major Issues|url=http://www.jallr.com/index.php/JALLR/article/view/138|journal=Journal of Applied Linguistics and Language Research|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=190\u2013195|issn=2376-760X}}</ref>, whereas biolinguistics addresses this by way of the Language Acquisition Device.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. This intergration of other fields to explain language is recognized as the ''strong'' view in biolinguistics<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boeckx|first=Cedric|last2=Grohmann|first2=Kleanthes K.|date=2007|title=The BIOLINGUISTICS Manifesto|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/26|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=1|pages=001\u2013008|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. He suggested that this organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Recent Developments ==\n'''Generative Procedure Accepted At Present & Its Developments'''\n\nIn biolinguistics, language is recognised to be based on recursive generative procedure that retrieves words from the lexicon and applies them repeatedly to output phrases. This generative procedure was hypothesised to be a result of a minor brain mutation due to evidence that word ordering is limited to externalisation and plays no role in core syntax or semantics. Thus, different lines of inquiry to explain this were explored. \n\nThe most commonly accepted line of inquiry to explain this is [[Noam Chomsky]]'s minimalist approach to syntactic representations. In 2016, Chomsky and Berwick defined the [[minimalist program]] under the Strong Minimalist Thesis in their book ''Why Only Us'' by saying that language is mandated by efficient computations and, thus, keeps to the simplest recursive operations. The main basic operation in the minimalist program is [[Merge (linguistics)|merge]]. Under merge there are two ways in which larger expressions can be constructed: externally and internally. Lexical items that are merged externally build argument representations with disjoint constituents. The internal merge creates constituent structures where one is a part of another. This induces [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], the capacity to pronounce phrases in one position, but interpret them elsewhere. \n\nRecent investigations of displacement concur to a slight rewiring in cortical brain regions that could have occurred historically and perpetuated generative grammar. Upkeeping this line of thought, in 2009, Ramus and Fishers speculated that a single gene could create a signalling molecule to facilitate new brain connections or a new area of the brain altogether via prenatally defined brain regions. This would result in information processing greatly important to language, as we know it. The spread of this advantage trait could be responsible for secondary externalisation and the interaction we engage in.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/why-only-us|title=Why Only Us {{!}} The MIT Press|last=Press|first=The MIT|website=mitpress.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> If this holds, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n''' Human versus Animal Communication '''\n\nCompared to other topics in linguistics where data can be displayed with evidence cross-linguistically, due to the nature of biolinguistics, and that it is apply to the entirety of linguistics rather than just a specific subsection, examining other species can assist in providing this data. Although animals do not have the same linguistic competencies as humans, is it assumed that they can provide evidence for some linguistic competence. Over the last twenty five years, clarifications on the fundamental features of human language have been carried out, which has at the same time, deepened knowledge on the communicative abilities and cognitive processes of non-human animal. [[Animal communication]] can be defined in general terms, the transfer of information by an animal that proves a change in the behaviour of the receiver of the information <ref> Preece, K., & Beekman, M. (2014). Honeybee waggle dance error: Adaption or constraint? Unravelling the complex dance language of honeybees. Animal Behaviour, 94, 19-26 </ref> The concept that has been claimed as the main factor of human language is the syntactic operation of the centre-embedded recursion <ref> Bar\u00f3n Birchenall, Leonardo. (2016). Animal communication and human language: An overview. International journal of comparative psychology / ISCP; sponsored by the International Society for Comparative Psychology and the University of Calabria. 29. 1-27 </ref>.  Non-human primates (NHP) know a lot about their environment, however they seem to be unable to intentionally communication this knowledge to others, at least through vocalizations. Overall, animal communicative abilities appear to be highly restricted to survival matters. Additionally, non-human animals apparently do not intend to convey information to others when communicating. Comparing animal language to human language acquisition, in regards to repertoire of elements used for communicative purposes (sounds or signs), the \u201cvocabulary\u201d of animals does not get anywhere close to that of humans. By the age of three years old, a neurotypical child produces an estimate of 500 different words, and can comprehend at least double that <ref> Gershkoff-Stowe, L., & Hahn, E. (2007). Fast mapping skills in the developing lexicon. Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research, 50, 682-697 </ref>. An average adult, graduated from university has a repertoire of about 20,000 word families. In comparison the animal with the largest repertoire, the common nightingale includes 200 different elements <ref> Colbert-White, E., Corballis, M., & Fragaszy, D. (2014). Where apes and songbirds are left behind: A comparative assessment of the requisites for speech. Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews, 9, 1-28 </ref>. Elements of language acquisition that are found within human languages such as a lexical explosion period or [[fast mapping]] do not seem apparent within non-human animals. It is possible that the phylogenetic development of human language relies on ancient perceptual capacities already present in birds and some mammals. Those capacities would have converged at a certain point of the evolution with skills for structural organization and conceptual abstraction, already existent in humans, and not necessarily present in the species of which perceptual abilities were inherited <ref> Heimbauer, A. (2012). Investigating speech perception in evolutionary perspective: Comparisons of chimpanzee (Pantroglodytes) and human capabilities (Unpublished doctoral dissertation). Georgia State University, Georgia </ref>. Human language ability is constituted by a multiplicity of factors, which are shared to one degree or another with other species. \n\n'''Relevant Biological & Evolutionary Research'''\n\nThe relatively new science of [[Evolutionary developmental biology|evo-devo]] that suggests everyone is a common descendant from a single tree has opened pathways into gene and biochemical study. One way in which this manifested within biolinguistics is through the suggestion of a common language gene, namely [[FOXP2|FOXP2.]] Though this gene is subject to debate, there have been interesting recent discoveries made concerning it and the part it plays in the secondary externalization process. Recent studies of birds and mice resulted in an emerging consensus that FOXP2 is not a blueprint for internal syntax nor the narrow faculty of language, but rather makes up the regulatory machinery pertaining to the process of externalization. The fact that it has been found to assists sequencing sound or gesture one after the next, hence implying that FOXP2 helps transfer knowledge from declarative to procedural memory. Therefore, FOXP2 has been discovered to be an aid in formulating a linguistic\u00a0 input-output system that runs smoothly.\n\n==Critiques==\n'''Alternative Theoretical Approaches'''\n\nStemming from the usage-based approach, the [[Competition Model]], developed by [[Elizabeth Bates]] and [[Brian MacWhinney]], views language acquisition as consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon a linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues with the use of competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nFrom the side of [[biosemiotics]], the has been a recent claim that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language. This meaning-making consists internal and external cognitive processes. Thus, it holds that such process organisation could not have only given a rise to language alone. According to this perspective all living things possess these processes, regardless of how wide the variation, as a posed to species-specific.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

Cham: Springer.</ref>\n\n\n'''Over-Emphasised Weak Stream Focus''' \n\nWhen talking about biolinguistics there are two senses that are adopted to the term: strong and weak biolinguistics. The weak is founded on theoretical linguistics that is generativist in persuasion. On the other hand, the strong stream goes beyond the commonly explored theoretical linguistics, with an oriented towards biology, as well as other relevant fields of study.\u00a0 Since the early emergence of biolinguistics to its present day, there has been a focused mainly on the weak stream, seeing little difference between the inquiry into generative linguistics and the biological nature of language as well as heavily relying on the Chomskyan origin of the term.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Martins|first=Pedro Tiago|last2=Boeckx|first2=Cedric|date=2016-12-01|title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/lingvan/open-issue/article-10.1515-lingvan-2016-0007/article-10.1515-lingvan-2016-0007.xml|journal=Linguistics Vanguard|language=en|volume=-1|issue=open-issue|doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007}}</ref> \n\nAs expressed by research professor and linguist Cedric Boeckx, it is a prevalent opinion that biolinguistics need to focus on biology as to give substance to the linguistic theorizing this field has engaged in. Particular criticisms mentioned\u00a0 include a lack of distinction between generative linguistics and biolinguistics, lack of discoveries pertaining to properties of grammar in the context of biology, and lack of recognition for the importance broader mechanisms, such as  biological non-linguistic properties. After all, it is only advantage to label propensity for language as biological if such insight is used towards a research.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has additionally noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem.'' Due to this different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Poeppel|first=David|title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones|last2=Embick|first2=David|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|year=2005|editor=Anne Cutler|chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience}}</ref>\n\nA recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general was developed by Prakash Mondal who shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representational character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.
