This estate consisted of {{convert|1350|acre|km2}}, and was later part of Gloucester County.  He was educated at Oxford in England and may have studied law at the London [[Inns of Court]].  He seemed destined for a career in the church, but he elected rather to return to the life of a Virginia gentleman, residing at \"Paradise\".  In 1673, when his older brother John died unmarried, Richard inherited the estate, \"[[Machodoc]]\".  Richard left \"Paradise\" to overseers and removed to his new estate.\n\nRichard married Laetitia Corbin (ca. 1657\u20131706), daughter of Richard's neighbor and, Councillor, Hon.

In 1676 Richard became a member of the King's Council and he served in this capacity off and on until 1698.  On one such absence in 1690 he had lost his seat because of his refusal to take the oath of allegiance to [[William III of England|William III]], [[King of England]] (\"William of Orange\") (1650\u20131702).  However, he was reinstated within a year.  Richard was forced to retire from this position because of ill health.  The Council was a body that served as the Governor's privy council, the Upper House of the Colonial Legislature, and the Colonial Supreme Court.  As early as 1680 he was Colonel of Horse in the counties of Westmoreland, Northumberland and Stafford.  He was appointed by Sir Gov. [[Edmund Andros]] (1637\u20131714) to be \"''Naval Officer and Receiver of Virginia Dutys for the River Potomac''\".  Richard II, had one of the largest libraries in the Colony.  He spent almost his whole life in study, and usually wrote his notes in Greek, Hebrew, or Latin.  It was because of this that he was termed \"the scholar\".  Richard was a supporter of the Established Church.\n\nRichard died March 12, 1714 at \"Machodoc\", [[Westmoreland County, Virginia|Westmoreland County]].  His will was probated on April 27, 1715.  He was buried at the old \"Burnt House Fields\", located near \"Mount Pleasant\".  Laetitia died on October 6, 1706 at \"Machodoc\", and her tombstone can still be seen at \"Mount Pleasant\".\n\nRichard established his residence at the \"Machodoc\" plantation, which was located on the [[Potomac River]], near the town of Hague, in Westmoreland County.  This was a large brick house, largely inclosed by a brick wall.  The estate was inherited by his son Hon. Richard Lee III (1679\u20131718) who was at the time residing in London as a tobacco merchant with his family.  Richard III leased his estate in Virginia to his brothers, [[Thomas Lee (Virginia colonist)|Thomas]], Hon. (1690\u20131750) and [[Henry Lee I|Henry]] (1691\u20131747), for \"''an annual rent of one peppercorn only, payable on Christmas Day''\".  After Richard's death in 1718, the estate was sold by his wife [[Martha Silk]] (d.ca. 1734), who sold it to her brother-in-law, Colonel Thomas Lee, Hon. (1690\u20131750).  Thomas resided here until it burned down January 29, 1729, and removed to his newly built \"[[Stratford Hall (plantation)|Stratford Hall]]\".  The fire was so serious that the field near the old mansion at \"Machodoc\" where the Lee burial ground became was forever named the old \"Burnt House Fields\".  The land was sold to Richard Lee III's only son Col. George Lee (1714\u20131761), who had come over from England.  A new plantation was built by George who called his new estate \"Mount Pleasant\".  The new house was built further back from the river and upon higher ground.

He is known as Himmatwala (''courageous man''). He then goes to Ramnagar village, where he meets his mother, Savitri ([[Zarina Wahab]]), and his younger sister, Padma ([[Leena Jumani]]), who are living a miserable life.\n\nRavi's mother Savitri tells Ravi that Ravi's father ([[Anil Dhawan]]) was an honest and respected man, and he was the priest of the temple. His father was framed by Sher Singh ([[Mahesh Manjrekar]]), the tyrant zamindar (landlord), for robbing the temple since the latter saw him commit a murder. Disgusted, Ravi's father committed suicide. In revenge, young Ravi tried to kill Sher Singh, but failed. When Ravi's house is burnt, Savitri tells him to run away as Sher Singh will kill him.\n\nWith revenge in his mind, Ravi beats up Narayan Das ([[Paresh Rawal]]), Sher Singh's manager and brother-in-law, as well as threatening Sher Singh. The next day, he publicly humiliates Sher Singh's daughter, Rekha ([[Tamannaah]]) because she was beating up her innocent driver. In response, Rekha unleashes a tiger on the village in front of Ravi. Her plan was unsuccessful, however, as it backfired. Rekha falls down from the terrace and is about to be attacked by the animal, when Ravi jumps and saves her life. Rekha falls in love with Ravi, and afterwards, saves Ravi's life against her father Sher Singh's plans.\n\nOn the other hand, Ravi comes to know that Padma is in love with Shakti ([[Adhyayan Suman]]), Narayan Das's son. He has his objections and so has Narayan. However, Sher Singh tells Narayan Das that marrying Shakti with Padma would give them an upper hand over Ravi as they can ill-treat Padma and keep Ravi in control. Meanwhile, Padma now knows that Ravi who is living with her, is not the '''real Ravi''' ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]), and Ravi died in a road accident. Before dying, the real Ravi asked him to take care of his family. Padma is initially upset, but then reconciles after Ravi saves her life.\n\nShortly after Padma and Shakti get married, both the father and son start ill-treating Padma. In revenge, Ravi uses Rekha against her own father, just like what she advises him. After Rekha tells her father Sher Singh that she is pregnant with Ravi's child, Sher Singh begs Ravi to marry Rekha. Eventually, Ravi punished Narayan Das and Shakti by doing all the household chores. He also wins the Sarpanch election, and Sher Singh finally gives all the property documents back to the villagers, which Sher Singh had illegally taken from them before.\n\nHowever, Shakti overhears Rekha and Ravi's conversation about the fake pregnancy and that he is not the real Ravi. Angered, Sher Singh tries to kill him by bringing 20 fighters from the city, but failed. While they are beating Ravi, the tiger (which Ravi had fought with) comes and saves his life.

He is known as Himmatwala (''courageous man''). He then goes to Ramnagar village, where he meets his mother, Savitri ([[Zarina Wahab]]), and his younger sister, Padma ([[Leena Jumani]]), who are living a miserable life.\n\nRavi's mother Savitri tells Ravi that Ravi's father ([[Anil Dhawan]]) was an honest and respected man, and he was the priest of the temple. His father was framed by Sher Singh ([[Mahesh Manjrekar]]), the tyrant zamindar (landlord), for robbing the temple since the latter saw him commit a murder. Disgusted, Ravi's father committed suicide. In revenge, young Ravi tried to kill Sher Singh, but failed. When Ravi's house is burnt, Savitri tells him to run away as Sher Singh will kill him.\n\nWith revenge in his mind, Ravi beats up Narayan Das ([[Paresh Rawal]]), Sher Singh's manager and brother-in-law, as well as threatening Sher Singh. The next day, he publicly humiliates Sher Singh's daughter, Rekha ([[Tamannaah]]) because she was beating up her innocent driver. In response, Rekha unleashes a tiger on the village in front of Ravi. Her plan was unsuccessful, however, as it backfired. Rekha falls down from the terrace and is about to be attacked by the animal, when Ravi jumps and saves her life. Rekha falls in love with Ravi, and afterwards, saves Ravi's life against her father Sher Singh's plans.\n\nOn the other hand, Ravi comes to know that Padma is in love with Shakti ([[Adhyayan Suman]]), Narayan Das's son. He has his objections and so has Narayan. However, Sher Singh tells Narayan Das that marrying Shakti with Padma would give them an upper hand over Ravi as they can ill-treat Padma and keep Ravi in control. Meanwhile, Padma now knows that Ravi who is living with her, is not the '''real Ravi''' ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]), and Ravi died in a road accident. Before dying, the real Ravi asked him to take care of his family. Padma is initially upset, but then reconciles after Ravi saves her life.\n\nShortly after Padma and Shakti get married, both the father and son start ill-treating Padma. In revenge, Ravi uses Rekha against her own father, just like what she advises him. After Rekha tells her father Sher Singh that she is pregnant with Ravi's child, Sher Singh begs Ravi to marry Rekha. Eventually, Ravi punished Narayan Das and Shakti by doing all the household chores. He also wins the Sarpanch election, and Sher Singh finally gives all the property documents back to the villagers, which Sher Singh had illegally taken from them before.\n\nHowever, Shakti overhears Rekha and Ravi's conversation about the fake pregnancy and that he is not the real Ravi. Angered, Sher Singh tries to kill him by bringing 20 fighters from the city, but failed. While they are beating Ravi, the tiger (which Ravi had fought with) comes and saves his life. Ravi then brutally beats Shakti, and is about to kill Sher Singh when his mother stops him.\n\nIn the end, Sher Singh, Narayan Das and Shakti ask for the forgiveness from Ravi, Savitri and the rest of the villagers.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Ajay Devgan and Tamannaah.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Ajay Devgan]] with co-star [[Tamannaah]] during the trailer launch of their film ''Himmatwala'']]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ajay Devgn]] as Ravi (II) \"Himmatwala\" Ravi , Ravi's friend\n* [[Tamannaah]] as Rekha Singh Bandookwala, Ravi (II)'s love interest\n* [[Paresh Rawal]] as Narayan Das, Sher Singh's brother-in-law, Shakti's father, and Rekha's uncle\n* [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] as Sher Singh Bandookwala, Rekha's father\n* [[Adhyayan Suman]] as Shakti Das, Narayan's son, Rekha's cousin, Padma's husband, and Ravi's brother-in-law\n* [[Zarina Wahab]] as Savitri Kishan Verma, Kishan's widow, Ravi and Padma's mother, and Shakti's mother-in-law\n* [[Leena Jumani]] as Padma Verma/Padma Shakti Das, Savitri and Kishan's daughter, Ravi's younger sister, and Shakti's wife<ref>{{cite web|author=Yahoo!

For example, [[Orlando Gibbons]] composed such Services. In [[Orthodox Christianity]] the Magnificat, or \"Song of the [[Theotokos]]\", is sung in the [[Orthros]] ([[matins]]) as part of the [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]]. [[All-night vigil]]s include the Orthros, and a setting of such vigil thus usually includes the setting of a Magnificat, e.g. the \"Canticle of the Theotokos\" (\u00ab\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044a \u0434\u0443\u0448\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u044f \u0413\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u00bb, Velichit dusha moya Gospoda, \"My soul doth magnify the Lord\"), No. 13 in [[All-Night Vigil (Tchaikovsky)|Tchaikovsky's ''All-Night Vigil'']].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n! style=white-space:nowrap | Composer\n! | Born\n! | Died\n! | Magnificat compositions\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap data-sort-value=\"Dunstaple, John\"| [[John Dunstaple]]\n| data-sort-value=\"1390\" | {{circa}} \u20091390\n| 1453 \n| Three Magnificats\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap data-sort-value=\"Dufay, Guillaume\"| [[Guillaume Dufay]]\n| data-sort-value=\"1397\" | {{circa}} \u20091397\n| 1474\n| Three Magnificats, e.g. [[choralwiki:Magnificat Quinti Toni (Guillaume Dufay)|Magnificat Quinti Toni]]\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap data-sort-value=\"Binchois, Gilles\"| [[Gilles Binchois]]\n| data-sort-value=\"1400\" | {{circa}} 1400\n| 1460\n| Magnificats, e.g. [[choralwiki:Magnificat 3ii Toni (Gilles Binchois)|Magnificat 3ii Toni]]\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap data-sort-value=\"Kellyk, Hugh\"| [[Hugh Kellyk]]\n| data-sort-value=\"1400\" | ?\n| data-sort-value=\"1480\" | {{floruit}} {{circa|lk=no}} 1480\n| Magnificat a 5 \u2013 see ''[[Eton Choirbook]]''<ref name=EtonBNF>{{BNF|43039821v}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap data-sort-value=\"Nesbet, John\"| [[John Nesbet]]\n| data-sort-value=\"1410\" | ?\n| data-sort-value=\"1488\" | 1488 (?)\n| Magnificat \u2013 see ''[[Eton Choirbook]]''<ref name=EtonBNF />\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap data-sort-value=\"Horwood, William\"| [[William Horwood (composer)|William Horwood]]\n| data-sort-value=\"1430\" | {{circa}} 1430\n| 1484\n| Magnificat secundi toni a 5 ([[SATB|SATTB]]) \u2013 see ''[[Eton Choirbook]]''<ref name=EtonBNF />\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap data-sort-value=\"Weerbeke, Gaspar van\"| [[Gaspar van Weerbeke|Gaspar van<br>Weerbeke]]\n| data-sort-value=\"1445\" | {{circa}} 1445\n| data-sort-value=\"1516\" | after 1516\n| Magnificat\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap data-sort-value=\"Agricola, Alexander\"| [[Alexander Agricola]]\n| data-sort-value=\"1445\" | 1445 or 1446\n| 1506 \n| Magnificat primi toni;

Often only six out of twelve verses of the Magnificat were set in polyphony, performance alternating verses sung in polyphony and verses sung in [[monody]] according to the [[church mode|church tone]]. In such [[alternatim]] settings the even verses were chosen more often for setting in polyphony, because they contained the last verse of the [[doxology]], so that the singing of the Magnificat ended with a piece in polyphony.<ref>Christopher Michael Porter.

For example, [[Orlando Gibbons]] composed such Services. In [[Orthodox Christianity]] the Magnificat, or \"Song of the [[Theotokos]]\", is sung in the [[Orthros]] ([[matins]]) as part of the [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]]. [[All-night vigil]]s include the Orthros, and a setting of such vigil thus usually includes the setting of a Magnificat, e.g. the \"Canticle of the Theotokos\" (\u00ab\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044a \u0434\u0443\u0448\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u044f \u0413\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u00bb, Velichit dusha moya Gospoda, \"My soul doth magnify the Lord\"), No. 13 in [[All-Night Vigil (Tchaikovsky)|Tchaikovsky's ''All-Night Vigil'']].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n! style=white-space:nowrap | Composer\n! | Born\n! | Died\n! | Magnificat compositions\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap data-sort-value=\"Dunstaple, John\"| [[John Dunstaple]]\n| data-sort-value=\"1390\" | {{circa}} \u20091390\n| 1453 \n| Three Magnificats\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap data-sort-value=\"Dufay, Guillaume\"| [[Guillaume Dufay]]\n| data-sort-value=\"1397\" | {{circa}} \u20091397\n| 1474\n| Three Magnificats, e.g. [[choralwiki:Magnificat Quinti Toni (Guillaume Dufay)|Magnificat Quinti Toni]]\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap data-sort-value=\"Binchois, Gilles\"| [[Gilles Binchois]]\n| data-sort-value=\"1400\" | {{circa}} 1400\n| 1460\n| Magnificats, e.g. [[choralwiki:Magnificat 3ii Toni (Gilles Binchois)|Magnificat 3ii Toni]]\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap data-sort-value=\"Kellyk, Hugh\"| [[Hugh Kellyk]]\n| data-sort-value=\"1400\" | ?\n| data-sort-value=\"1480\" | {{floruit}} {{circa|lk=no}} 1480\n| Magnificat a 5 \u2013 see ''[[Eton Choirbook]]''<ref name=EtonBNF>{{BNF|43039821v}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap data-sort-value=\"Nesbet, John\"| [[John Nesbet]]\n| data-sort-value=\"1410\" | ?\n| data-sort-value=\"1488\" | 1488 (?)\n| Magnificat \u2013 see ''[[Eton Choirbook]]''<ref name=EtonBNF />\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap data-sort-value=\"Horwood, William\"| [[William Horwood (composer)|William Horwood]]\n| data-sort-value=\"1430\" | {{circa}} 1430\n| 1484\n| Magnificat secundi toni a 5 ([[SATB|SATTB]]) \u2013 see ''[[Eton Choirbook]]''<ref name=EtonBNF />\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap data-sort-value=\"Weerbeke, Gaspar van\"| [[Gaspar van Weerbeke|Gaspar van<br>Weerbeke]]\n| data-sort-value=\"1445\" | {{circa}} 1445\n| data-sort-value=\"1516\" | after 1516\n| Magnificat\n|-\n| style=white-space:nowrap data-sort-value=\"Agricola, Alexander\"| [[Alexander Agricola]]\n| data-sort-value=\"1445\" | 1445 or 1446\n| 1506 \n| Magnificat primi toni;

{"title_page": "Anti-religious persecution in Communist Romania", "text_new": "The '''Romania Anti-Religious Campaign''', refers to the anti-religious campaign initiated by the [[Socialist Republic of Romania]], which under the doctrine of [[Marxist\u2013Leninist atheism]], took a hostile stance against [[religion]], and set its sights on the ultimate goal of an [[Atheism|atheistic]] society,<ref>{{cite book|last1= Leustean|first1=Lucian|title=Orthodoxy and the Cold War: Religion and Political Power in Romania, 1947-65|date=2009|publisher=la University of Michigan|isbn=3447058749|page=92|url=|quote= was to transform Romania into a communist atheist society.}}</ref> wherein religion would be recognized as the ideology of the [[bourgeoisie]].\n\n==Scope==\nRomania's Communist government achieved an incredible degree of control (relative to the other [[Eastern Bloc]] nations) of the nation's largest religious community: the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]. This control was used to foster political support for the regime as well as to manipulate Romania's image abroad.\n\nIn Romania, more than 5,000 Orthodox Christian [[priest]]s were imprisoned. The Orthodox archdiocese of Cluj, contains biographies of 1,700 church personnel jailed.<ref>January 23, 1999, issue of the London Tablet by Jonathen Luxmoore, Published by Chesterton Review Feb/May 1999</ref>\n\n==1945-1965==\n{{Long section|date=January 2020}}\n\n=== Cultural background ===\nThe [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], in accordance with [[Marxist\u2013Leninist atheism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] interpretation of history, saw religion as a [[Capitalism|capitalist]] remnant that would inevitably disappear as its social base disappeared.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\">Lavinia Stan and Lucian Turcescu. The Romanian Orthodox Church and Post-Communist Democratisation. Europe-Asia Studies, Vol. 52, No. 8 (Dec., 2000), pp. 1467-1488</ref>\n\nThe Romanian Orthodox church had a long history of submitting to the rule of foreign rulers, and when the Communists took power after the [[Soviet Army]] 'liberated' Romania, the Communists used this tradition to their advantage. The People's Republic of Romania was officially installed on December 30, 1947, and the Romanian Orthodox Church found collaboration with the new state to be beneficial to it. This collaboration, led to Romania taking a different path towards anti-religious work than in the USSR, because the regime found the submissive church to be a very effective tool in maintaining power.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\">Lucian N. Leustean. Constructing Communism in the Romanian People's Republic. Orthodoxy and State, 1948-49. Europe-Asia Studies, Vol. 59, No. 2 (Mar., 2007), pp. 303-329</ref> Therefore, while the state saw religion as something that would not have a permanent place in their future vision for Romania, they nevertheless saw it as a very important tool in the short-term when many Romanians adhered to religious beliefs. Nevertheless, up until 1965, the state made considerable efforts at weakening the church's role in society, abolished previous [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s granted to it and eliminated its educational and charitable activities.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\" />\n\n=== Centralizing around the Romanian Orthodox church ===\nAs a result of Romania's re-enlargement at the end of [[World War II]], with the restitution of Northern Transylvania after the nullification of [[Second Vienna Award|The Second Vienna Award]], non-Orthodox [[Ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] became more numerous. Rivalries developed in the different religious groups and the government used this to its own advantage by letting the Romanian Orthodox church to strengthen its position in society in exchange for giving greater communist control over the church.<ref name=\"autogenerated1986\">Religion in Eastern Europe.\" Department of State Bulletin 86 (1986)</ref>\n\n==== Abolishing of the Uniate eastern-catholic church ====\nIn 1948 the government abolished the [[Uniate Romanian Church|Uniate]] eastern-catholic churches (the second largest religious grouping in Romania, holding 1.5 million people in 1948<ref>John M. Kramer. The Vatican's \"Ostpolitik\". The Review of Politics, Vol. 42, No. 3 (Jul., 1980), pp. 283-308</ref>) and forcibly integrated them into the Romanian Orthodox church; this followed from a similar measure employed by [[Joseph Stalin]] against [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic]]s in the [[USSR]] shortly after the end of the war. The measure was presented as a popular movement that began within the [[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches|eastern-rite catholic churches]] (a small group of 37 priests from the eastern-rite churches signed a document approving the union, all of whom were then [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by the eastern-rite [[bishop]]), and was hailed as bringing freedom to the people in achieving national unity. The [[Patriarch]] welcomed the new union and supported the government's decision.\n\nIn the first week after this new union was made, six Uniate bishops and 25 Uniate priests were arrested for their opposition to the change. The government initially feared putting them on trial, due to the mass reactions as had followed similar arrests in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Hungary]], and instead they were placed under [[house arrest]]. They were later moved to [[Sighet prison]], wherein more clergy would join them. It is known that 11 Uniate bishops died in prison.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/> The Uniate church was completely outlawed; many of its members that chose not to join the Orthodox church either continued to operate underground or instead joined the (still legal) [[Latin Rite|Latin-rite]] Catholics in Romania. All Uniate properties and churches were confiscated and (most of them) handed over to the Orthodox community.\n\nA total of 400 priests in the Eastern catholic churches were killed by the state.{{cn|date=August 2018}} Over 2000 eastern catholic churches were seized (most of which were never returned by the Romanian Orthodox church even after [[Communism]] fell).<ref>Liviu Andreescu. The Construction of Orthodox Churches in Post-Communist Romania. Europe-Asia Studies, Vol. 59, No. 3 (May, 2007), pp. 451-480</ref>\n\n=== Legal actions taken against the religious institutions ===\nThe 1927 concordat with the [[Holy See|Vatican]] was abolished, and all [[Catholic school]]s were seized by the state. The Vatican was treated as a threat to Romania. Gheorghiu-Dej claimed:\n\n<blockquote> The Pope will undoubtedly find occasion to assail our constitution because it does not tally with the Vatican's tendencies, which are to interfere in the internal concerns of various countries under the pretext of evangelizing the Catholic faithful [\u2026] Who knows whether the Vatican will not consider anathematising us on the pretext that our constitution does not provide for the submission of our fellow countrymen of Catholic persuasion to the political interests of the Vatican or because we do not allow ourselves to be tempted by America's golden calf, to the feet of which the Vatican would bring its faithful<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/></blockquote>\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of the Soviet Union, the regime outlawed institutions of [[religious education]] for the general populace. Article 27 of the new constitution stated:\n\n<blockquote>Freedom of conscience and freedom of religious worship shall be guaranteed by the State. Religious denominations shall be free to organise themselves and may freely function, provided that their ritual and practice are not contrary to the constitution, public security and morals. No religious denomination, congregation, or community may open or maintain institutions for general education, but may only operate special theological schools for training ministers necessary to their religious service under State control. The Romanian Orthodox Church is autocephalous and unitary in its organisation. The method of organisation and the functioning of the religious denominations will be established by law.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe Ministry of Education ordered the removal of religious objects from schools (including many [[icon]]s), and replaced them with pictures of communist leaders. The anti-religious work in the schools was resisted by parents who did not send their children to the schools at the beginning of the school year and by teachers who defied instructions by asking the students to pray. The [[Securitate]] also found that many Communist activists were people of [[religious belief]]. The Orthodox church in Romania, in order to make a compromise with the state's anti-religious work, asked for the schools to return the icons to the churches.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/>\n\nIn theory, [[religious denomination]]s were permitted to organize and function, but in practice the regime found many ways to suppress those who threatened '[[public security]]'.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/> Legislation was passed that took control of all aspects of religious life, required all religious denominations to have central organizations that required state approval, forbade the organization of [[Political party|political parties]] on confessional bases, and that all [[religious leader]]s needed to be registered and approved by the government.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/> The Orthodox church was forced to close its seminaries and retained only three institutes for theological instruction, a [[seminary]] for [[monk]]s and two seminaries for [[nun]]s; Roman Catholics and [[Protestant]]s were each allowed one seminary.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/> Government inspectors were designated for the church, and church publications were reduced as well as censured.\n\nThe Romanian academy was reorganized and several important religious figures were removed from membership. In 1949, a faction of the Orthodox church known as the 'Army of the Lord' ([[Oastea Domnului]]) was outlawed.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\" />\n\n=== Appointment of a supportive Orthodox Patriarch ===\nThe Romanian Orthodox Patriarch, Nicodim, had not opposed the post-war installation of the new regime, however, he had been reticent about the rise of Communism and proved to be an obstacle in the regime's initial attempts at taking control of the church. On February 27, 1948, he died under unexplained circumstances; during the following months when a new Patriarch was to be chosen, Metropolitan Irineu of [[Moldova]] (who was thought to be Nicodim's successor) also died under unexplained circumstances. Metropolitan [[Justinian Marina]], a bishop who had published a new doctrine for the church called the 'Social Apostolate' that forged cooperation between the church and the government, was then named the new Patriarch of the Orthodox Church in Romania.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/> From this point onwards in the history of the People's Republic of Romania, the regime controlled the [[Patriarchate]] and ensured that only candidates loyal to them would occupy the post.\n\nThe Communists gained complete control of the church, and began persecuting its membership, while the hierarchy turned a blind eye towards this and even cooperated through using its resources to assist the state in its [[State terrorism|terror campaign]] against targeted members; the hierarchy denied the existence of [[persecution]]. The Communists were permitted to choose who served in the church, who was admitted to seminary and even what the sermon content would be.<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\">Ediger, Ruth M. \"History of an institution as a factor for predicting church institutional behavior: the cases of the Catholic Church in Poland, the Orthodox Church in Romania, and the Protestant churches in East Germany.\" East European Quarterly 39.3 (2005)</ref> The national clerical bodies' elections were dominated by the party who imposed its own candidates and filled clerical bodies with people loyal to the party. Priests who were opposed to the Communists were removed (the church hierarchy itself could even dismiss them). The bishops openly criticized the [[Western world|West]] and praised the political achievements of the Soviet Union; the pastoral letters of Patriarch Justinian often had strong political messages that criticized the West as well as Roman Catholics.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\">Lucian N. Leustean. Between Moscow and London: Romanian Orthodoxy and National Communism, 1960-1965. The Slavonic and East European Review, Vol. 85, No. 3 (Jul., 2007), pp. 491-521</ref> A new [[theology]] was taught by the church which joined together Marxist\u2013Leninist ideology and Orthodox teachings.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\"/>\n\nThese changes in the church were presented to the public eye, not as an attempt by the state to control the church, but rather a popular decision among the nation's Christians to embrace communism.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/>\n\n=== Symbiotic relationship between the Romanian Orthodox church and the state ===\nIn reward for its complete submission, the Romanian Orthodox church gained many privileges (besides the aforementioned elimination of rival religious groupings in Romania). Unlike in the USSR, wherein clergy were paid only by [[donation]]s (and taxed at extreme rates), or like in Bulgaria, wherein clergy received a salary from the state at a [[subsistence economy|subsistence]] level, the clergy in Romania were paid a salary from the government that was equivalent to the average wage of the population. The church also received large public [[Subsidy|subsidies]] for the restoring and building of thirty new churches after the end of the War. They did not receive support from orthodox churches in neighbouring countries. The Romanian Orthodox Church was the only [[religious body]] in the Eastern bloc that freely published significant amounts of religious and liturgical works, as well as translations from western books. Patriarch Justinian became a visible [[public figure]], not in competition with but in submission to the system, and he served as a guest at state diplomatic receptions. The government permitted the Orthodox church to canonize the first Romanian Orthodox saints in 1955.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/>\n\nDespite this good relationship, the regime also attempted to [[Indoctrination|indoctrinate]] the population (especially the youth) with atheism. Students were forced to attend special Scouts assemblies that coincided with [[religious festival]]s.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/> On the feast of Christ's [[baptism]] in 1948 (traditionally celebrated in Romania by the Orthodox Patriarch to bless the Monarch and his Queen for the next year), over 170,000 'volunteers' were sent to work on national building sites in celebration of the [[working class]].<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/> In 1949, an anti-religious organization based on Soviet models was formed, which was called the Society for the Popularisation of Science and Culture. Its goal was to 'propagate among the labouring masses political and scientific knowledge to fight [[obscurantism]], [[superstition]], [[mysticism]], and all other influences of bourgeois ideologies'.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/> Leading communist intellectuals joined this society; it was organized into regional organizations and branches around the country and recruited thousands of [[Propaganda|propagandists]] to give lectures around the country.\n\nThe Securitate found a great chasm had developed between the church hierarchy and [[laity]]. The laity were subject to poor economic conditions and anti-religious persecution, while their hierarchy enjoyed very good relations with the state. The children of Gheorghiu-Dej even went often to Patriarch Justinian's home to be treated with sumptuous meals.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/>\n\nMonasteries were required to take roles as craft centres (Justinian reformed [[monasticism]] so that every monk or nun would have a useful trade so that monasticism would not be regarded as an [[anachronism]]<ref name=\"democratisation1467\" />) and future monks/nuns were required to have at least 7 years [[education]]. Monasteries were later suppressed in the late 1950s. A waves of closures of monastic seminaries and monasteries took place between 1958-1964 (coinciding with [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]]'s accelerated anti-religious campaign in the same period). About 4000 monks and nuns were either jailed or forced to 'return to the world'.\n\n=== Church lands and the Land reform ===\n[[Land reform]] was undertaken in Romania according to the Soviet model of [[collectivization]]; as in other Communist states, the government wished to deprive the church of its land, because the church was a major land owner in the country. The [[Romanian Government]] was very cautious to avoid acting in a confrontational manner on this issue, and therefore it arranged it such that priests went on an individual basis to publicly state that they could not work the land and because they wished to support the Communist transformation of Romania, they were therefore freely giving their land to the people.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\" /> The Patriarch applauded the measure, and called on the [[peasantry]] to follow suit by giving up their land to collectivization.\n\nIn his pastoral letter on collectivization, the Patriarch applauded the 'high' level of [[religious freedom]] present in Romania, wherein the state not only guaranteed but 'defended' the church, and he denounced the previous concordat in Romania that had brought injustice to the church.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\" />\n\n<br />\n\n=== Arrests ===\nIn 1961, [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], leader of Communist Romania, declared that over 80,000 people were arrested between 1945 and 1952, of which 30,000 were imprisoned. This included many members of the [[clergy]] and ordinary [[Layman|lay people]] that were convicted after they asserted their religious beliefs. The Eastern Orthodox nevertheless did not suffer mass persecution, and the church even benefited  from collaboration with the regime.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\" />\n\nFollowing the 1949 social re-orientation programs, many priests deemed \"reactionary\" by the state were arrested.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\" />\n\nImprisoned believers could be subject to atheistic [[brainwashing]] classes in prison. [[Richard Wurmbrand]], a [[Lutheran Church|Lutheran]] pastor in Romania, famously escaped to the west in the 1960s after fourteen years in prison, where he testified before the [[United States Congress|US congress]] and gave detailed accounts of the [[torture]] he and others underwent in prison. He spoke on brainwashing:<blockquote> Now the worst times came; the times of brain-washing. Those who have not passed through brain-washing can't understand what torture it is. From 5 in the morning until 10 in the evening\u2026 17 hours a day\u2026 we had to sit just like this [he sat straight looking forward]. We were not allowed to lean. For nothing in the world could we rest a little bit-our head. To close you eyes was a crime! From 5 in the morning until 10 in the evening we had to sit like this and hear: 'Communism is good. Communism is good. Communism is good. Communism is good. Communism is good. Christianity is stupid! Christianity is stupid! Christianity is stupid! Nobody more believes in Christ. Nobody more believes in Christ. Give up! Give up! Give up!' For days, weeks, years, we had to listen to these things!</blockquote><ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7957160113259127737#]</ref>\n\nClergy were required to enroll in state classes meant to indoctrinate them known as 'missionary courses'.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/> They were required to pass final exams in these courses in order to serve as priests, and their grades determined which [[parish]] they would be sent to (i.e., better grades would lead them to better parishes; the priest's pay was also different depending on what part of the country they were in). After graduation they were also required to attend conferences every year involving both religious and political themes (after three absences, their positions were revoked); [[cantor (church)|cantor]]s in the church were also required to attend similar conferences. Conference political themes included such topics as 'The Church Should not be Static', 'The Orthodox Church and the Russian Orthodox Church, 'The Vatican's Anti-Progressivism', 'The Catholic Problem in the People's Republic of Romania' and 'Religious Liberty in the People's Republic of Romania'.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/>\n\nThe Patriarch had some success in using his good relations with the regime, to some degree, shield the church from persecution.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/> He also on one occasion defended the Saint Leon church in [[Bucharest]] from demolition.<ref name=\"autogenerated1119\">Lavinia Stan and Lucian Turcescu.

It used the church to make contacts with western Christians in order to present a better image of Romania abroad. It especially focused on developing relations with the [[Church of England]], which had been fostering contact with Romania since the inter-war period. The Anglican church gave much support to the Romanian Orthodox church, especially after the election of [[Michael Ramsay]] as [[archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1961.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/>\n\nThe patriarch tried to convince an Anglican representing the [[World Council of Churches]] that they were paying too much attention to the matter of the closure of monasteries, and claimed that the church was looking after the monks. Not long after, the Romanian Orthodox church was accepted into membership in the World Council of Churches. The church was used abroad to support Romania's image, while at the same time within the country the people would face continual atheistic propaganda.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/>\n\nThe Romanian Orthodox church in the United States split between those that continued to recognize the authority of the Holy Synod in Bucharest and those that didn't. The regime used this power to influence the activities of the Romanian diaspora where political opposition was harder to control. In 1963, when the bishop for the Romanian Orthodox in the United States died, a new bishop was appointed but could not take up residence as a result of him being denied a visa.\n\nVasile Lazarescu, Archbishop of Timi\u0219oara and Metropolitan of Banat, was found to be helping families of some imprisoned priests, and (following direction from the state) he was therefore accused by the church hierarchy of [[embezzlement]] and retired to a [[monastery]] in 1961.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/>\n\nWhen the [[Second Vatican Council]] was opened in 1962, the Romanian Orthodox Church was the only church in the communist bloc that refused to send representatives, and the pope was criticized. The Romanian church also refused to participate at the contemporary historic meeting between the [[Pope]] and [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch]].\n\nIn 1963, the Society for the Dissemination of Science and Culture (an organization meant to promote atheism) published brochures against religion: 'Adam and Eve our Ancestors?', 'When and Why Did Religion Appear?', 'The Origin of Christianity', 'Anthology of Atheism in Romania' and 'The Bible in Pictures'.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/> The work by the French atheist [[L\u00e9o Taxil]], 'La Bible amusante', was also translated into [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and published.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/>\n\nRomania's leader, Gheorghiu-Dej told the [[Austria]]n ambassador in 1964: <blockquote>\u2026as long as the church has no [[political power]] and the state has full control of the education of the young I am not against religion.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/> </blockquote>\n\nIn 1965, after Khrushchev had strongly attacked the church in Russia for several years, the number of priests in [[Moscow]] (a population of 7 million) was only 45, while in Bucharest (a population of 1.5 million), due to the continued cooperation and favoured treatment by the regime, there were 430 priests.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/>\n\nThe state continued to try to present a positive image of itself internationally, by using religious bodies as tools. In 1965, the regime allowed (for the first time since 1945) a superior of a catholic order (specifically the Superior of the Salvatorian Fathers) to visit Romania. The Archbishop of Canterbury also visited Romania in June 1965, and met with high-ranking members of the Communist government as well as the Patriarch (he was also given a special dinner by the Department of Religious Confessions).<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/> When the Archbishop asked about the government's attitudes to religious minority, the chairman of the council of ministers responded that [[England]] had set a historical precedent <blockquote> to prevent a foreign ecclesiastical ruler interfering in the national affairs <ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/></blockquote> (the largest religious minority in Romania were Catholics, of which only the Latin-rite Catholics still existed, due to the state's liquidation of the eastern-rite Catholics). Archbishop Ramsay, wishing to please the regime, praised the country's economic achievements; he also declined to criticize abuses of [[religious freedom]] or the atheist propaganda.\n\n==1965\u20131990==\nWhen [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] (coming to power in 1965) gained increasing control, the only religious bodies that provided significant dissent to the regime were evangelical Protestants, who formed only a small portion of the population.<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\"/>\n\nCeau\u0219escu formed personal working relationships with the leaders of all religious bodies in Romania after coming to power.<ref name=\"autogenerated619\">Rodney Stark. Gods, Rituals, and the Moral Order. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Vol. 40, No. 4 (Dec., 2001), pp. 619-636</ref>\n\nThe visit of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], achieved through Patriarch Justinian's efforts, as well as the increased attention on the religious situation in Romania from the visit, forced the regime to blunt anti-religious activities against the church until Justinian's death in 1977. It ceased to close monasteries, agreed to rehabilitate some formerly imprisoned clergy, and gave financial support for the restoration of some churches of historical importance.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\"/>\n\n[[Abortion]] was outlawed in 1966 (on grounds of the need to achieve demographic targets) and remained so until the country's [[democratization]] following the fall of communism; this contrasted from other Communist states wherein abortion was legalized (even if economic logic pointed at a need for a larger workforce) and even used as an ideological weapon against churches.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\"/> 300 new churches were allowed to be built.<ref name=\"autogenerated1119\"/>\n\nCeau\u0219escu used the church for his nationalistic efforts at separating Romania from Moscow. In 1972 he allowed his father to be buried with Orthodox rites and broadcast on live radio. He also tacitly tolerated the use of orthodox [[baptism]]s, [[marriage]]s and [[funeral]]s used by communist officials that were also believers.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\"/> He also gave extensive financial subsidies to all churches and exempted clergy as well as seminarians from [[military service]].<ref name=\"autogenerated619\"/> Churches were also permitted to operate huge network of [[sunday school]]s.<ref name=\"autogenerated619\"/>\n\nIn May 1974, Justinian brought the church into the Front of Socialist Unity and Democracy, a nationalist body controlled by the party.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\"/>\n\nAfter Justinian's death in 1977, a new anti-church campaign began in Romania. This coincided with an [[earthquake]] that struck southern Romania as well as Bucharest in the same year, which then led to [[urban renewal]]s projects that included the demolition of churches.<ref name=\"autogenerated1119\"/> The succeeding patriarch continued to praise Ceau\u0219escu's leadership and the religious freedom granted to the people of Romania.\n\nFather [[Gheorghe Calciu-Dumitreasa]], was sentenced in 1979 to prison and later sent into exile for preaching sermons against atheism.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\"/> Patriarch Justin Moisescu (Justinian's successor) allowed the [[Holy Synod]] to [[Defrocking|defrock]] Dumitreasa and other priests that the state arrested.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\"/> Between 1977 and 1982, 22 churches and monasteries were demolished, and 14 others were closed down or moved to disadvantageous sites.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\"/>\n\nRomanian Orthodox priests in the west were defrocked by the church in Romania for criticizing the situation of the church in Romania.\n\nSome religious revival occurred in Romania in the 1980s and engaged in more open religious practices, which the authorities tolerated. This toleration was accompanied by ruthless repression, with charismatic religious leaders subject to harassment, imprisonment and forced emigration (and also potentially killed). Religious congregations that were becoming larger in this revival had great difficulties in trying to enlarge their facilities, and some attempted to do so without permission with the government responding by tearing down the new construction. Printing and importing bibles was very difficult, and reportedly [[Bible]]s could be pulped for making [[toilet paper]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1986\"/>\n\nCeausescu re-developed Bucharest from his coming to power until his fall. Ceau\u0219escu did not like to see [[church architecture]] in Bucharest, and therefore eighteen churches and monasteries in the city (including Sf\u00e2nta Vineri, a 17th-century monument) were destroyed as part of the city's redevelopment.<ref name=\"autogenerated170\">Darrick Danta.

Patriarch [[Teoctist]] of the Romanian Orthodox Church supported Ceau\u0219escu up until the end of the regime, and even congratulated him after the state murdered one hundred demonstrators in [[Timi\u0219oara]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\"/> It was not until the day before Ceau\u0219escu's execution on December 24, 1989 that the Patriarch condemned him as \"a new child-murdering [[Herod the Great|Herod]]\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\"/>\n\nFollowing the removal of Communism, the Patriarch resigned (only to return a few months after) and the holy synod apologized for those 'who did not have the courage of the [[martyr]]s'.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Romania|Religion}}\n\n*[[Anti-religious campaign during the Russian Civil War (1917\u20131921)]]\n*[[League of Militant Atheists]]\n*[[Persecution of Christians in Warsaw Pact countries]]\n*[[Polish anti-religious campaign (1945\u20131990)]]\n*[[USSR anti-religious campaign (1921\u20131928)]]\n*[[USSR anti-religious campaign (1928\u20131941)]]\n*[[USSR anti-religious campaign (1958\u20131964)]]\n*[[USSR anti-religious campaign (1970s\u20131987)]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7957160113259127737# Richard Wurmbrand's 1966 interview about his 14-year imprisonment in Romania.]\n\n[[Category: History of Christianity in Romania]]\n[[Category: Persecution of Christians in the Eastern Bloc]]\n[[Category: Socialist Republic of Romania]]\n", "text_old": "The '''Romania Anti-Religious Campaign''', refers to the anti-religious campaign initiated by the [[Socialist Republic of Romania]], which under the doctrine of [[Marxist\u2013Leninist atheism]], took a hostile stance against [[religion]], and set its sights on the ultimate goal of an [[Atheism|atheistic]] society,<ref>{{cite book|last1= Leustean|first1=Lucian|title=Orthodoxy and the Cold War: Religion and Political Power in Romania, 1947-65|date=2009|publisher=la University of Michigan|isbn=3447058749|page=92|url=|quote= was to transform Romania into a communist atheist society.}}</ref> wherein religion would be recognized as the ideology of the [[bourgeoisie]].\n\n==Scope==\nRomania's Communist government achieved an incredible degree of control (relative to the other [[Eastern Bloc]] nations) of the nation's largest religious community: the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]].

The People's Republic of Romania was officially installed on December 30, 1947, and the Romanian Orthodox Church found collaboration with the new state to be beneficial to it. This collaboration, led to Romania taking a different path towards anti-religious work than in the USSR, because the regime found the submissive church to be a very effective tool in maintaining power.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/> Therefore, while the state saw religion as something that would not have a permanent place in their future vision for Romania, they nevertheless saw it as a very important tool in the short-term when many Romanians adhered to religious beliefs. Nevertheless, up until 1965, the state made considerable efforts at weakening the church's role in society, abolished previous [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s granted to it and eliminated its educational and charitable activities.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\"/>\n\nAs a result of Romania's re-enlargement at the end of [[World War II]], with the restitution of Northern Transylvania after the nullification of [[Second Vienna Award|The Second Vienna Award]], non-Orthodox [[Ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] became more numerous. Rivalries developed in the different religious groups and the government used this to its own advantage by letting the Romanian Orthodox church to strengthen its position in society in exchange for giving greater communist control over the church.<ref name=\"autogenerated1986\">Religion in Eastern Europe.\" Department of State Bulletin 86 (1986)</ref>\n\nIn 1948 the government abolished the [[Uniate Romanian Church|Uniate]] eastern-catholic churches (the second largest religious grouping in Romania, holding 1.5 million people in 1948<ref>John M. Kramer. The Vatican's \"Ostpolitik\". The Review of Politics, Vol. 42, No. 3 (Jul., 1980), pp. 283-308</ref>) and forcibly integrated them into the Romanian Orthodox church; this followed from a similar measure employed by [[Joseph Stalin]] against [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic]]s in the [[USSR]] shortly after the end of the war. The measure was presented as a popular movement that began within the [[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches|eastern-rite catholic churches]] (a small group of 37 priests from the eastern-rite churches signed a document approving the union, all of whom were then [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by the eastern-rite [[bishop]]), and was hailed as bringing freedom to the people in achieving national unity. The [[Patriarch]] welcomed the new union and supported the government's decision.\n\nIn the first week after this new union was made, six Uniate bishops and 25 Uniate priests were arrested for their opposition to the change. The government initially feared putting them on trial, due to the mass reactions as had followed similar arrests in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Hungary]], and instead they were placed under [[house arrest]]. They were later moved to [[Sighet prison]], wherein more clergy would join them. It is known that 11 Uniate bishops died in prison.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/> The Uniate church was completely outlawed; many of its members that chose not to join the Orthodox church either continued to operate underground or instead joined the (still legal) [[Latin Rite|Latin-rite]] Catholics in Romania. All Uniate properties and churches were confiscated and (most of them) handed over to the Orthodox community.\n\nA total of 400 priests in the Eastern catholic churches were killed by the state.{{cn|date=August 2018}} Over 2000 eastern catholic churches were seized (most of which were never returned by the Romanian Orthodox church even after [[Communism]] fell).<ref>Liviu Andreescu. The Construction of Orthodox Churches in Post-Communist Romania. Europe-Asia Studies, Vol. 59, No. 3 (May, 2007), pp. 451-480</ref>\n\nThe 1927 concordat with the [[Holy See|Vatican]] was abolished, and all [[Catholic school]]s were seized by the state. The Vatican was treated as a threat to Romania. Gheorghiu-Dej claimed:\n\n<blockquote> The Pope will undoubtedly find occasion to assail our constitution because it does not tally with the Vatican's tendencies, which are to interfere in the internal concerns of various countries under the pretext of evangelizing the Catholic faithful [\u2026] Who knows whether the Vatican will not consider anathematising us on the pretext that our constitution does not provide for the submission of our fellow countrymen of Catholic persuasion to the political interests of the Vatican or because we do not allow ourselves to be tempted by America's golden calf, to the feet of which the Vatican would bring its faithful<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/></blockquote>\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of the Soviet Union, the regime outlawed institutions of [[religious education]] for the general populace. Article 27 of the new constitution stated:\n\n<blockquote>Freedom of conscience and freedom of religious worship shall be guaranteed by the State. Religious denominations shall be free to organise themselves and may freely function, provided that their ritual and practice are not contrary to the constitution, public security and morals. No religious denomination, congregation, or community may open or maintain institutions for general education, but may only operate special theological schools for training ministers necessary to their religious service under State control. The Romanian Orthodox Church is autocephalous and unitary in its organisation. The method of organisation and the functioning of the religious denominations will be established by law.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe Ministry of Education ordered the removal of religious objects from schools (including many [[icon]]s), and replaced them with pictures of communist leaders. The anti-religious work in the schools was resisted by parents who did not send their children to the schools at the beginning of the school year and by teachers who defied instructions by asking the students to pray. The [[Securitate]] also found that many Communist activists were people of [[religious belief]]. The Orthodox church in Romania, in order to make a compromise with the state's anti-religious work, asked for the schools to return the icons to the churches.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/>\n\nIn theory, [[religious denomination]]s were permitted to organize and function, but in practice the regime found many ways to suppress those who threatened '[[public security]]'.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/> Legislation was passed that took control of all aspects of religious life, required all religious denominations to have central organizations that required state approval, forbade the organization of [[Political party|political parties]] on confessional bases, and that all [[religious leader]]s needed to be registered and approved by the government.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/> The Orthodox church was forced to close its seminaries and retained only three institutes for theological instruction, a [[seminary]] for [[monk]]s and two seminaries for [[nun]]s; Roman Catholics and [[Protestant]]s were each allowed one seminary.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/> Government inspectors were designated for the church, and church publications were reduced as well as censured.\n\nThe Romanian Orthodox Patriarch, Nicodim, had not opposed the post-war installation of the new regime, however, he had been reticent about the rise of Communism and proved to be an obstacle in the regime's initial attempts at taking control of the church. On February 27, 1948, he died under unexplained circumstances; during the following months when a new Patriarch was to be chosen, Metropolitan Irineu of [[Moldova]] (who was thought to be Nicodim's successor) also died under unexplained circumstances. Metropolitan [[Justinian Marina]], a bishop who had published a new doctrine for the church called the 'Social Apostolate' that forged cooperation between the church and the government, was then named the new Patriarch of the Orthodox Church in Romania.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/> From this point onwards in the history of the People's Republic of Romania, the regime controlled the [[Patriarchate]] and ensured that only candidates loyal to them would occupy the post.\n\nThe Communists gained complete control of the church, and began persecuting its membership, while the hierarchy turned a blind eye towards this and even cooperated through using its resources to assist the state in its [[State terrorism|terror campaign]] against targeted members; the hierarchy denied the existence of [[persecution]]. The Communists were permitted to choose who served in the church, who was admitted to seminary and even what the sermon content would be.<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\">Ediger, Ruth M. \"History of an institution as a factor for predicting church institutional behavior: the cases of the Catholic Church in Poland, the Orthodox Church in Romania, and the Protestant churches in East Germany.\" East European Quarterly 39.3 (2005)</ref> The national clerical bodies' elections were dominated by the party who imposed its own candidates and filled clerical bodies with people loyal to the party. Priests who were opposed to the Communists were removed (the church hierarchy itself could even dismiss them).

Unlike in the USSR, wherein clergy were paid only by [[donation]]s (and taxed at extreme rates), or like in Bulgaria, wherein clergy received a salary from the state at a [[subsistence economy|subsistence]] level, the clergy in Romania were paid a salary from the government that was equivalent to the average wage of the population. The church also received large public [[Subsidy|subsidies]] for the restoring and building of thirty new churches after the end of the War. They did not receive support from orthodox churches in neighbouring countries. The Romanian Orthodox Church was the only [[religious body]] in the Eastern bloc that freely published significant amounts of religious and liturgical works, as well as translations from western books. Patriarch Justinian became a visible [[public figure]], not in competition with but in submission to the system, and he served as a guest at state diplomatic receptions. The government permitted the Orthodox church to canonize the first Romanian Orthodox saints in 1955.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/>\n\nDespite this good relationship, the regime also attempted to [[Indoctrination|indoctrinate]] the population (especially the youth) with atheism. Students were forced to attend special pioneer assemblies that coincided with [[religious festival]]s.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/> On the feast of Christ's [[baptism]] in 1948 (traditionally celebrated in Romania by the Orthodox Patriarch to bless the Monarch and his Queen for the next year), over 170,000 'volunteers' were sent to work on national building sites in celebration of the [[working class]].<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/> In 1949, an anti-religious organization based on Soviet models was formed, which was called the Society for the Popularisation of Science and Culture. Its goal was to 'propagate among the labouring masses political and scientific knowledge to fight [[obscurantism]], [[superstition]], [[mysticism]], and all other influences of bourgeois ideologies'.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/> Leading communist intellectuals joined this society; it was organized into regional organizations and branches around the country and recruited thousands of [[Propaganda|propagandists]] to give lectures around the country.\n\nThe Securitate found a great chasm had developed between the church hierarchy and [[laity]]. The laity were subject to poor economic conditions and anti-religious persecution, while their hierarchy enjoyed very good relations with the state. The children of Gheorghiu-Dej even went often to Patriarch Justinian's home to be treated with sumptuous meals.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/>\n\nThe Romanian academy was reorganized and several important religious figures were removed from membership. In 1949, a faction of the Orthodox church known as the 'Army of the Lord' ([[Oastea Domnului]]) was outlawed.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/>\n\n[[Land reform]] was undertaken in Romania according to the Soviet model of [[collectivization]]; as in other Communist states, the government wished to deprive the church of its land, because the church was a major land owner in the country. The [[Romanian Government]] was very cautious to avoid acting in a confrontational manner on this issue, and therefore it arranged it such that priests went on an individual basis to publicly state that they could not work the land and because they wished to support the Communist transformation of Romania, they were therefore freely giving their land to the people.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/> The Patriarch applauded the measure, and called on the [[peasantry]] to follow suit by giving up their land to collectivization.\n\nIn his pastoral letter on collectivization, the Patriarch applauded the 'high' level of [[religious freedom]] present in Romania, wherein the state not only guaranteed but 'defended' the church, and he denounced the previous concordat in Romania that had brought injustice to the church.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/>\n\nFollowing the 1949 social re-orientation programs, many priests deemed \"reactionary\" by the state were arrested.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\"/>\n\nMonasteries were required to take roles as craft centres (Justinian reformed [[monasticism]] so that every monk or nun would have a useful trade so that monasticism would not be regarded as an [[anachronism]]<ref name=\"democratisation1467\"/>) and future monks/nuns were required to have at least 7 years [[education]]. Monasteries were later suppressed in the late 1950s. A waves of closures of monastic seminaries and monasteries took place between 1958-1964 (coinciding with [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]]'s accelerated anti-religious campaign in the same period). About 4000 monks and nuns were either jailed or forced to 'return to the world'.\n\nImprisoned believers could be subject to atheistic [[brainwashing]] classes in prison. [[Richard Wurmbrand]], a [[Lutheran Church|Lutheran]] pastor in Romania, famously escaped to the west in the 1960s after fourteen years in prison, where he testified before the [[United States Congress|US congress]] and gave detailed accounts of the [[torture]] he and others underwent in prison. He spoke on brainwashing: <blockquote> Now the worst times came; the times of brain-washing. Those who have not passed through brain-washing can't understand what torture it is. From 5 in the morning until 10 in the evening\u2026 17 hours a day\u2026 we had to sit just like this [he sat straight looking forward]. We were not allowed to lean. For nothing in the world could we rest a little bit-our head. To close you eyes was a crime! From 5 in the morning until 10 in the evening we had to sit like this and hear: 'Communism is good. Communism is good. Communism is good. Communism is good. Communism is good. Christianity is stupid! Christianity is stupid! Christianity is stupid! Nobody more believes in Christ. Nobody more believes in Christ. Give up! Give up! Give up!' For days, weeks, years, we had to listen to these things!</blockquote><ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7957160113259127737#]</ref>\n\nClergy were required to enrol in state classes meant to indoctrinate them known as 'missionary courses'.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/> They were required to pass final exams in these courses in order to serve as priests, and their grades determined which [[parish]] they would be sent to (i.e., better grades would lead them to better parishes; the priest's pay was also different depending on what part of the country they were in). After graduation they were also required to attend conferences every year involving both religious and political themes (after three absences, their positions were revoked); [[cantor (church)|cantor]]s in the church were also required to attend similar conferences. Conference political themes included such topics as 'The Church Should not be Static', 'The Orthodox Church and the Russian Orthodox Church, 'The Vatican's Anti-Progressivism', 'The Catholic Problem in the People's Republic of Romania' and 'Religious Liberty in the People's Republic of Romania'.<ref name=\"autogenerated303\"/>\n\nThe Patriarch had some success in using his good relations with the regime, to some degree, shield the church from persecution.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/> He also on one occasion defended the Saint Leon church in [[Bucharest]] from demolition.<ref name=\"autogenerated1119\">Lavinia Stan and Lucian Turcescu. Politics, National Symbols and the Romanian Orthodox Cathedral. Europe-Asia Studies, Vol. 58, No. 7 (Nov., 2006), pp. 1119-1139</ref>\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, the state began to increasingly use the Romanian Orthodox church for an international role. It used the church to make contacts with western Christians in order to present a better image of Romania abroad. It especially focused on developing relations with the [[Church of England]], which had been fostering contact with Romania since the inter-war period. The Anglican church gave much support to the Romanian Orthodox church, especially after the election of [[Michael Ramsay]] as [[archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1961.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/>\n\nThe patriarch tried to convince an Anglican representing the [[World Council of Churches]] that they were paying too much attention to the matter of the closure of monasteries, and claimed that the church was looking after the monks. Not long after, the Romanian Orthodox church was accepted into membership in the World Council of Churches. The church was used abroad to support Romania's image, while at the same time within the country the people would face continual atheistic propaganda.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/>\n\nThe Romanian Orthodox church in the United States split between those that continued to recognize the authority of the Holy Synod in Bucharest and those that didn't. The regime used this power to influence the activities of the Romanian diaspora where political opposition was harder to control. In 1963, when the bishop for the Romanian Orthodox in the United States died, a new bishop was appointed but could not take up residence as a result of him being denied a visa.\n\nVasile Lazarescu, Archbishop of Timi\u0219oara and Metropolitan of Banat, was found to be helping families of some imprisoned priests, and (following direction from the state) he was therefore accused by the church hierarchy of [[embezzlement]] and retired to a [[monastery]] in 1961.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/>\n\nWhen the [[Second Vatican Council]] was opened in 1962, the Romanian Orthodox Church was the only church in the communist bloc that refused to send representatives, and the pope was criticized. The Romanian church also refused to participate at the contemporary historic meeting between the [[Pope]] and [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch]].\n\nIn 1963, the Society for the Dissemination of Science and Culture (an organization meant to promote atheism) published brochures against religion: 'Adam and Eve our Ancestors?', 'When and Why Did Religion Appear?', 'The Origin of Christianity', 'Anthology of Atheism in Romania' and 'The Bible in Pictures'.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/> The work by the French atheist [[L\u00e9o Taxil]], 'La Bible amusante', was also translated into [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and published.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/>\n\nRomania's leader, Gheorghiu-Dej told the [[Austria]]n ambassador in 1964: <blockquote>\u2026as long as the church has no [[political power]] and the state has full control of the education of the young I am not against religion.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/> </blockquote>\n\nIn 1965, after Khrushchev had strongly attacked the church in Russia for several years, the number of priests in [[Moscow]] (a population of 7 million) was only 45, while in Bucharest (a population of 1.5 million), due to the continued cooperation and favoured treatment by the regime, there were 430 priests.<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/>\n\nThe state continued to try to present a positive image of itself internationally, by using religious bodies as tools. In 1965, the regime allowed (for the first time since 1945) a superior of a catholic order (specifically the Superior of the Salvatorian Fathers) to visit Romania. The Archbishop of Canterbury also visited Romania in June 1965, and met with high-ranking members of the Communist government as well as the Patriarch (he was also given a special dinner by the Department of Religious Confessions).<ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/> When the Archbishop asked about the government's attitudes to religious minority, the chairman of the council of ministers responded that [[England]] had set a historical precedent <blockquote> to prevent a foreign ecclesiastical ruler interfering in the national affairs <ref name=\"autogenerated491\"/></blockquote> (the largest religious minority in Romania were Catholics, of which only the Latin-rite Catholics still existed, due to the state's liquidation of the eastern-rite Catholics). Archbishop Ramsay, wishing to please the regime, praised the country's economic achievements; he also declined to criticize abuses of [[religious freedom]] or the atheist propaganda.\n\n==1965\u20131990==\nWhen [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] (coming to power in 1965) gained increasing control, the only religious bodies that provided significant dissent to the regime were evangelical Protestants, who formed only a small portion of the population.<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\"/>\n\nCeau\u0219escu formed personal working relationships with the leaders of all religious bodies in Romania after coming to power.<ref name=\"autogenerated619\">Rodney Stark. Gods, Rituals, and the Moral Order. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Vol. 40, No. 4 (Dec., 2001), pp. 619-636</ref>\n\nThe visit of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], achieved through Patriarch Justinian's efforts, as well as the increased attention on the religious situation in Romania from the visit, forced the regime to blunt anti-religious activities against the church until Justinian's death in 1977. It ceased to close monasteries, agreed to rehabilitate some formerly imprisoned clergy, and gave financial support for the restoration of some churches of historical importance.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\"/>\n\n[[Abortion]] was outlawed in 1966 (on grounds of the need to achieve demographic targets) and remained so until the country's [[democratization]] following the fall of communism; this contrasted from other Communist states wherein abortion was legalized (even if economic logic pointed at a need for a larger workforce) and even used as an ideological weapon against churches.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\"/> 300 new churches were allowed to be built.<ref name=\"autogenerated1119\"/>\n\nCeau\u0219escu used the church for his nationalistic efforts at separating Romania from Moscow. In 1972 he allowed his father to be buried with Orthodox rites and broadcast on live radio. He also tacitly tolerated the use of orthodox [[baptism]]s, [[marriage]]s and [[funeral]]s used by communist officials that were also believers.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\"/> He also gave extensive financial subsidies to all churches and exempted clergy as well as seminarians from [[military service]].<ref name=\"autogenerated619\"/> Churches were also permitted to operate huge network of [[sunday school]]s.<ref name=\"autogenerated619\"/>\n\nIn May 1974, Justinian brought the church into the Front of Socialist Unity and Democracy, a nationalist body controlled by the party.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\"/>\n\nAfter Justinian's death in 1977, a new anti-church campaign began in Romania. This coincided with an [[earthquake]] that struck southern Romania as well as Bucharest in the same year, which then led to [[urban renewal]]s projects that included the demolition of churches.<ref name=\"autogenerated1119\"/> The succeeding patriarch continued to praise Ceau\u0219escu's leadership and the religious freedom granted to the people of Romania.\n\nFather [[Gheorghe Calciu-Dumitreasa]], was sentenced in 1979 to prison and later sent into exile for preaching sermons against atheism.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\"/> Patriarch Justin Moisescu (Justinian's successor) allowed the [[Holy Synod]] to [[Defrocking|defrock]] Dumitreasa and other priests that the state arrested.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\"/> Between 1977 and 1982, 22 churches and monasteries were demolished, and 14 others were closed down or moved to disadvantageous sites.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\"/>\n\nRomanian Orthodox priests in the west were defrocked by the church in Romania for criticizing the situation of the church in Romania.\n\nSome religious revival occurred in Romania in the 1980s and engaged in more open religious practices, which the authorities tolerated. This toleration was accompanied by ruthless repression, with charismatic religious leaders subject to harassment, imprisonment and forced emigration (and also potentially killed). Religious congregations that were becoming larger in this revival had great difficulties in trying to enlarge their facilities, and some attempted to do so without permission with the government responding by tearing down the new construction. Printing and importing bibles was very difficult, and reportedly [[Bible]]s could be pulped for making [[toilet paper]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1986\"/>\n\nCeausescu re-developed Bucharest from his coming to power until his fall. Ceau\u0219escu did not like to see [[church architecture]] in Bucharest, and therefore eighteen churches and monasteries in the city (including Sf\u00e2nta Vineri, a 17th-century monument) were destroyed as part of the city's redevelopment.<ref name=\"autogenerated170\">Darrick Danta.

Patriarch [[Teoctist]] of the Romanian Orthodox Church supported Ceau\u0219escu up until the end of the regime, and even congratulated him after the state murdered one hundred demonstrators in [[Timi\u0219oara]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\"/> It was not until the day before Ceau\u0219escu's execution on December 24, 1989 that the Patriarch condemned him as \"a new child-murdering [[Herod the Great|Herod]]\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\"/>\n\nFollowing the removal of Communism, the Patriarch resigned (only to return a few months after) and the holy synod apologized for those 'who did not have the courage of the [[martyr]]s'.<ref name=\"democratisation1467\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Romania|Religion}}\n\n*[[Anti-religious campaign during the Russian Civil War (1917\u20131921)]]\n*[[League of Militant Atheists]]\n*[[Persecution of Christians in Warsaw Pact countries]]\n*[[Polish anti-religious campaign (1945\u20131990)]]\n*[[USSR anti-religious campaign (1921\u20131928)]]\n*[[USSR anti-religious campaign (1928\u20131941)]]\n*[[USSR anti-religious campaign (1958\u20131964)]]\n*[[USSR anti-religious campaign (1970s\u20131987)]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7957160113259127737# Richard Wurmbrand's 1966 interview about his 14-year imprisonment in Romania.]\n\n[[Category: History of Christianity in Romania]]\n[[Category: Persecution of Christians in the Eastern Bloc]]\n[[Category: Socialist Republic of Romania]]\n", "name_user": "Pratat", "label": "safe", "comment": "Made much progress on sub sectioning, very interesting article!", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-religious_persecution_in_Communist_Romania"}
{"title_page": "Bicyclic semigroup", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], the '''bicyclic semigroup''' is an algebraic object important for the structure theory of [[semigroup]]s. Although it is in fact a [[monoid]], it is usually referred to as simply a semigroup.  It is perhaps most easily understood as the [[syntactic monoid]] describing the [[Dyck language]] of balanced pairs of parentheses. Thus, it finds common applications in [[combinatorics]], such as describing [[binary tree]]s and [[associative algebra]]s.\n\n==History==\n\nThe first published description of this object was given by [[Evgenii Lyapin]] in 1953. [[Alfred H. Clifford]] and [[Gordon Preston]] claim that one of them, working with [[David Rees (mathematician)|David Rees]], discovered it independently (without publication) at some point before 1943.\n\n==Construction==\n\nThere are at least three standard ways of constructing the bicyclic semigroup, and various notations for referring to it. Lyapin called it ''P''; Clifford and Preston used <math>\\mathcal{C}</math>; and most recent papers have tended to use ''B''. This article will use the modern style throughout.\n\n===From a free semigroup===\n\nThe bicyclic semigroup is the [[free semigroup]] on two generators ''p'' and ''q'', under the relation ''p'' ''q'' = 1. That is, each semigroup element is a string of those two letters, with the proviso that the subsequence \"''p'' ''q''\" does not appear. \nThe semigroup operation is concatenation of strings, which is clearly [[associative]]. \nIt can then be shown that all elements of ''B'' in fact have the form ''q''<sup>''a''</sup> ''p''<sup>''b''</sup>, for some [[natural number]]s ''a'' and ''b''. The composition operation simplifies to\n: (''q''<sup>''a''</sup> ''p''<sup>''b''</sup>) (''q''<sup>''c''</sup> ''p''<sup>''d''</sup>) = ''q''<sup>''a'' + ''c'' &minus; min{''b'', ''c''}</sup> ''p''<sup>''d'' + ''b'' &minus; min{''b'', ''c''}</sup>.\n\n===From ordered pairs===\n\nThe way in which these exponents are constrained suggests that the \"''p'' and ''q'' structure\" can be discarded, leaving only operations on the \"''a'' and ''b''\" part. \nSo ''B'' is the semigroup of pairs of natural numbers (including zero), with operation<ref>Hollings (2007), p. 332</ref>\n:(''a'', ''b'') (''c'', ''d'') = (''a'' + ''c'' &minus; min{''b'', ''c''}, ''d'' + ''b'' &minus; min{''b'', ''c''}).\nThis is sufficient to define ''B'' so that it is the same object as in the original construction. Just as ''p'' and ''q'' generated ''B'' originally, with the empty string as the monoid identity, this new construction of ''B'' has generators (1, 0) and (0, 1), with identity (0, 0).\n\n===From functions===\n\nIt can be shown that ''any'' semigroup ''S'' generated by elements ''e'', ''a'', and ''b'' satisfying the statements below is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the bicyclic semigroup.\n* ''a'' ''e'' = ''e'' ''a'' = ''a''\n* ''b'' ''e'' = ''e'' ''b'' = ''b''\n* ''a'' ''b'' = ''e''\n* ''b'' ''a'' \u2260 ''e''\nIt is not entirely obvious that this should be the case&mdash;perhaps the hardest task is understanding that ''S'' must be infinite. To see this, suppose that ''a'' (say) does not have infinite order, so ''a''<sup>''k'' + ''h''</sup> = ''a''<sup>''h''</sup> for some ''h'' and ''k''. Then ''a''<sup>''k''</sup> = ''e'', and\n:''b'' = ''e'' ''b'' = ''a''<sup>''k''</sup> ''b'' = ''a''<sup>''k'' - 1</sup> ''e'' = ''a''<sup>''k'' - 1</sup>,\nso \n:''b'' ''a'' = ''a''<sup>''k''</sup> = ''e'',\nwhich is not allowed&mdash;so there are infinitely many distinct powers of ''a''. The full proof is given in Clifford and Preston's book.\n\nNote that the two definitions given above both satisfy these properties. A third way of deriving ''B'' uses two appropriately-chosen functions to yield the bicyclic semigroup as a monoid of transformations of the natural numbers. Let \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b9 be elements of the [[transformation semigroup]] on the natural numbers, where\n*\u03b9(''n'') = ''n''\n*\u03b1(''n'') = ''n'' + 1\n*\u03b2(''n'') = 0 if ''n'' = 0, and ''n'' &minus; 1 otherwise.\nThese three functions have the required properties, so the semigroup they generate is ''B''.<ref name=Lot459>{{cite book | last=Lothaire | first=M. | authorlink=M.

The elements \u03c6(''a''), \u03c6(''b'') and \u03c6(''e'') of ''S'' will always satisfy the conditions above (because \u03c6 is a homomorphism) with the possible exception that \u03c6(''b'') \u03c6(''a'') might turn out to be \u03c6(''e''). If this is not true, then \u03c6(''B'') is isomorphic to ''B''; otherwise, it is the cyclic semigroup generated by \u03c6(''a''). In practice, this means that the bicyclic semigroup can be found in many different contexts.\n\nThe [[idempotent]]s of ''B'' are all pairs (''x'', ''x''), where ''x'' is any natural number (using the ordered pair characterisation of ''B''). Since these commute, and ''B'' is ''regular'' (for every ''x'' there is a ''y'' such that ''x'' ''y'' ''x'' = ''x''), the bicyclic semigroup is an [[inverse semigroup]]. (This means that each element ''x'' of ''B'' has a unique inverse ''y'', in the \"weak\" semigroup sense that ''x'' ''y'' ''x'' = ''x'' and ''y'' ''x'' ''y'' = ''y''.)\n\nEvery [[Semigroup#Subsemigroups and ideals|ideal]] of ''B'' is principal: the left and right principal ideals of (''m'', ''n'') are\n* (''m'', ''n'') ''B'' = {(''s'', ''t'') : ''s'' \u2265 ''m''} and\n* ''B'' (''m'', ''n'') = {(''s'', ''t'') : ''t'' \u2265 ''n''}.\nEach of these contains infinitely many others, so ''B'' does not have minimal left or right ideals.\n\nIn terms of [[Green's relations]], ''B'' has only one ''D''-class (it is ''bisimple''), and hence has only one ''J''-class (it is ''simple''). The ''L'' and ''R'' relations are given by\n* (''a'', ''b'') ''R'' (''c'', ''d'') [[if and only if]] ''a'' = ''c''; and\n* (''a'', ''b'') ''L'' (''c'', ''d'') if and only if ''b'' = ''d''.<ref>Howie p.60</ref>\nThis implies that two elements are ''H''-related if and only if they are identical. Consequently, the only subgroups of ''B'' are infinitely many copies of the trivial group, each corresponding to one of the idempotents.\n\nThe [[Green's relations|egg-box diagram]] for ''B'' is infinitely large; the upper left corner begins:\n{| cellpadding=6\n| (0, 0) || (1, 0) || (2, 0) || ...\n|-\n| (0, 1) || (1, 1) || (2, 1) || ...\n|-\n| (0, 2) || (1, 2) || (2, 2) || ...\n|-\n| ... || ... || ... || ...\n|}\nEach entry represents a singleton ''H''-class; the rows are the ''R''-classes and the columns are ''L''-classes. The idempotents of ''B'' appear down the diagonal, in accordance with the fact that in a regular semigroup with commuting idempotents, each ''L''-class and each ''R''-class must contain exactly one idempotent.\n\nThe bicyclic semigroup is the \"simplest\" example of a bisimple inverse semigroup with identity; there are many others. Where the definition of ''B'' from ordered pairs used the class of natural numbers (which is not only an additive semigroup, but also a commutative [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] under min and max operations), another set with appropriate properties could appear instead, and the \"+\", \"&minus;\" and \"max\" operations modified accordingly.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Four-spiral semigroup]]\n*[[Special classes of semigroups]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n\n* ''The algebraic theory of semigroups'', A.

The full proof is given in Clifford and Preston's book.\n\nNote that the two definitions given above both satisfy these properties. A third way of deriving ''B'' uses two appropriately-chosen functions to yield the bicyclic semigroup as a monoid of transformations of the natural numbers. Let \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b9 be elements of the [[transformation semigroup]] on the natural numbers, where\n*\u03b9(''n'') = ''n''\n*\u03b1(''n'') = ''n'' + 1\n*\u03b2(''n'') = 0 if ''n'' = 0, and ''n'' &minus; 1 otherwise.\nThese three functions have the required properties, so the semigroup they generate is ''B''.<ref name=Lot459>{{cite book | last=Lothaire | first=M. | authorlink=M. Lothaire | title=Algebraic combinatorics on words | others=With preface by Jean Berstel and Dominique Perrin | edition=Reprint of the 2002 hardback | series=Encyclopedia of Mathematics and Its Applications | volume=90| publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-521-18071-9 | zbl=1221.68183 | page=459 }}</ref>\n\n==Properties==\n\nThe bicyclic semigroup has the property that the image of any [[homomorphism]] \u03c6 from ''B'' to another semigroup ''S'' is either cyclic, or it is an isomorphic copy of ''B''. The elements \u03c6(''a''), \u03c6(''b'') and \u03c6(''e'') of ''S'' will always satisfy the conditions above (because \u03c6 is a homomorphism) with the possible exception that \u03c6(''b'') \u03c6(''a'') might turn out to be \u03c6(''e''). If this is not true, then \u03c6(''B'') is isomorphic to ''B''; otherwise, it is the cyclic semigroup generated by \u03c6(''a''). In practice, this means that the bicyclic semigroup can be found in many different contexts.\n\nThe [[idempotent]]s of ''B'' are all pairs (''x'', ''x''), where ''x'' is any natural number (using the ordered pair characterisation of ''B''). Since these commute, and ''B'' is ''regular'' (for every ''x'' there is a ''y'' such that ''x'' ''y'' ''x'' = ''x''), the bicyclic semigroup is an [[inverse semigroup]]. (This means that each element ''x'' of ''B'' has a unique inverse ''y'', in the \"weak\" semigroup sense that ''x'' ''y'' ''x'' = ''x'' and ''y'' ''x'' ''y'' = ''y''.)\n\nEvery [[Semigroup#Subsemigroups and ideals|ideal]] of ''B'' is principal: the left and right principal ideals of (''m'', ''n'') are\n* (''m'', ''n'') ''B'' = {(''s'', ''t'') : ''s'' \u2265 ''m''} and\n* ''B'' (''m'', ''n'') = {(''s'', ''t'') : ''t'' \u2265 ''n''}.\nEach of these contains infinitely many others, so ''B'' does not have minimal left or right ideals.\n\nIn terms of [[Green's relations]], ''B'' has only one ''D''-class (it is ''bisimple''), and hence has only one ''J''-class (it is ''simple''). The ''L'' and ''R'' relations are given by\n* (''a'', ''b'') ''R'' (''c'', ''d'') [[if and only if]] ''a'' = ''c''; and\n* (''a'', ''b'') ''L'' (''c'', ''d'') if and only if ''b'' = ''d''.<ref>Howie p.60</ref>\nThis implies that two elements are ''H''-related if and only if they are identical. Consequently, the only subgroups of ''B'' are infinitely many copies of the trivial group, each corresponding to one of the idempotents.\n\nThe [[Green's relations|egg-box diagram]] for ''B'' is infinitely large; the upper left corner begins:\n{| cellpadding=6\n| (0, 0) || (1, 0) || (2, 0) || ...\n|-\n| (0, 1) || (1, 1) || (2, 1) || ...\n|-\n| (0, 2) || (1, 2) || (2, 2) || ...\n|-\n| ... || ... || ... || ...\n|}\nEach entry represents a singleton ''H''-class; the rows are the ''R''-classes and the columns are ''L''-classes. The idempotents of ''B'' appear down the diagonal, in accordance with the fact that in a regular semigroup with commuting idempotents, each ''L''-class and each ''R''-class must contain exactly one idempotent.\n\nThe bicyclic semigroup is the \"simplest\" example of a bisimple inverse semigroup with identity; there are many others. Where the definition of ''B'' from ordered pairs used the class of natural numbers (which is not only an additive semigroup, but also a commutative [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] under min and max operations), another set with appropriate properties could appear instead, and the \"+\", \"&minus;\" and \"max\" operations modified accordingly.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Four-spiral semigroup]]\n*[[Special classes of semigroups]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n\n* ''The algebraic theory of semigroups'', A.
