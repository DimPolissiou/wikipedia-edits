Originally released for [[Windows]], ''Zoo Tycoon 2'' is also available for [[Windows Mobile]], [[PDA]], and [[OS X|Mac OS X]], although expansions are not included in the Mac version. A [[Nintendo DS]] version, titled ''[[Zoo Tycoon 2 DS]]'', was released in 2008.\n\n''Zoo Tycoon 2'' features similar gameplay as its predecessor, ''[[Zoo Tycoon (2001 video game)|Zoo Tycoon]]''. The object of the game is to build and operate a [[zoo]] by creating [[exhibits]] and [[aquariums]], keeping guests and akkllkmimknimals happy, and maintaining employees, finances, terrain, and scenery.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe ''Zoo Tycoon 2'' gameplay revolves around creating suitable exhibits for animals through habitat modifications (ground cover, water, elevation, foliage and rocks and a variety of items including food, enrichment and shelter) which fulfill the animal's needs (habitat, hunger, thirst, stimulation, privacy, sleep, social, exercise). Guests will visit the zoo to see the animals, and they also have needs that need to be fulfilled through scenery and buildings (hunger, thirst, bathroom, seating, entertainment).\n\nZoo Tycoon 2 features three [[gameplay]] modes: Campaign, Challenge and Freeform. In Campaign mode, the player plays through a scenario in an existing zoo and is assigned different goals to complete, such as achieving a certain fame level, caring for rescued animals, or breeding endangered species. In Challenge mode, the player starts a zoo from scratch and will be given random challenges which can be accepted or rejected. In both of these modes, players will have limited money to manage and will start with limited access to animals and items, with more becoming available as zoo fame level increases. The last mode, Freeform, allows the player create a zoo from scratch with unlimited money and access to all animals and items from the start.\n\n==Expansion packs==\n\n===''Endangered Species''===\n\nIn October 2005, [[Microsoft]] released the ''Zoo Tycoon 2: Endangered Species'' expansion pack. This expansion pack adds more rare animals, including the [[koala]], [[Gray Wolf]], [[Komodo dragon]], [[Scimitar oryx|scimitar-horned oryx]], [[American bison]] and [[orangutan]], as well as a number of new forms of transportation, including sky trams, jeep tours and elevated paths. The expansion also has a feature called \"variant skins\", which means that when the player adopts an animal, it may look different from normal members of its species (such as a [[White tiger|white Bengal tiger]] and [[king cheetah]]).\n\n===''African Adventure''===\n\n''Zoo Tycoon 2: African Adventure'', released in May 2006, adds various new [[Africa|African]] animals such as the [[bongo (antelope)|bongo]], [[secretary bird]], [[ratel]], and the [[meerkat]], and allows the player to drive through exhibits with African-themed [[jeep]] tours to get closer to them. The expansion pack also includes new maps based on well-known African locations, as well as new desert-themed buildings, [[lizard]] live food, and a new set of challenges and campaigns. The Jeep vehicle tours originally included in ''Endangered Species'' are featured in this expansion, with the addition of the new [[Jeep Liberty]].\n\n===''Dino Danger Pack'' (premium download)===\nThe ''Dino Danger Pack'' was released at the end of July 2006. The pack could only be downloaded from the ''Zoo Tycoon'' website via [[credit card]]. It added four new animals to the game- ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', ''[[Triceratops]]'', ''[[Carnotaurus]]'', and ''[[Styracosaurus]]'', as well as new objects to be used for them and a campaign game. The ''Dino Danger Pack'' could be purchased and downloaded at ''Zoo Tycoon'' premium downloads.<ref name=premium>{{cite web|url=http://zootycoon.com/Downloads/premiumdownloads.htm|title=Zoo Tycoon.com - Premium Downloads|accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref> Since the release of ''[[Zoo Tycoon 2: Extinct Animals]]'', which includes more updated versions of all of the animals included in the pack, ''Dino Danger'' was taken [[Online and offline|offline]] from the ''Zoo Tycoon'' website and can no longer be downloaded there. However, other sites still offer this pack.\n\n===''Zookeeper Collection''===\nThe ''Zookeeper Collection'' was released on October 17, 2006. Rather than being an expansion, it is more of a large combination pack featuring the ''Endangered Species'' and ''African Adventure'' expansions, as well as all animals and content from ''Zoo Tycoon 2''.\n\n===''Marine Mania''===\n\nReleased on October 17, 2006, ''Zoo Tycoon 2: Marine Mania'' features 20 new aquatic animals, new marine options, marine shows and several other new gaming features. The expansion also includes marine [[Plant|plants]], the ability to build tanks, animal shows, mini games to teach some of the player's marine animals behaviors, and four new [[aquatic ecology|aquatic biomes]] ([[reef]], [[coastal]], [[pelagic]], and [[benthic]]), and new scenarios and challenges. Changes have been made to the original method of biome layout allowing the ability to turn off rocks, flowers and/or trees. New animals range from the giant [[whale shark]]s to the tiny [[rockhopper penguin]]s.\n\n===''Extinct Animals''===\n\n[[Image:Styracosaurus ans Short Faced Bear.jpg|thumb|A typical zoo in ''Extinct Animals'', with ''[[Styracosaurus]]es'' and a [[short-faced bear]]]]\n''Zoo Tycoon 2: Extinct Animals'' was released on October 17, 2007. It is the largest and latest expansion in the [[Zoo Tycoon (series)|''Zoo Tycoon'' series]], with 34 adoptable animals and one bonus animal. The player can find [[Fossil|fossils]], or get staff to find them. The player can then assemble the fossils, and can also create normal and \"Super\" extinct animals in an extinct research lab. The player can also stop rampaging dinosaurs.\n\n=== ''Ultimate Collection'' ===\n''Zoo Tycoon 2: Ultimate Collection'' contains the original game, all four official expansions and a new menu theme exclusive to it, similar to ''Zoo Tycoon: Complete Collection''.<ref>[http://zootycoon.com/Community/Zoo+News+-+Ultimate+Collection+Announce.htm Zoo Tycoon - ZOO NEWS - JUNE 19, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080711045641/http://zootycoon.com/Community/Zoo+News+-+Ultimate+Collection+Announce.htm |date=July 11, 2008 }}</ref> This title was released on September 30, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Zoo-Tycoon-2-Ultimate-Pc/dp/B001BZ2F56/|title=Zoo Tycoon 2: Ultimate Collection: Video Games|date=|publisher=Amazon.com|author=Zoo Tycoon 2: Ultimate Collection|accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> Some users reported disk problems, whereby the third disk was the same as the second one.

Changes have been made to the original method of biome layout allowing the ability to turn off rocks, flowers and/or trees. New animals range from the giant [[whale shark]]s to the tiny [[rockhopper penguin]]s.\n\n===''Extinct Animals''===\n\n[[Image:Styracosaurus ans Short Faced Bear.jpg|thumb|A typical zoo in ''Extinct Animals'', with ''[[Styracosaurus]]es'' and a [[short-faced bear]]]]\n''Zoo Tycoon 2: Extinct Animals'' was released on October 17, 2007.

A song entitled \"Punk Song #2\" was recorded but not renamed; it later appeared on the \"[[Freak (Silverchair song)|Freak]]\" single. \"Punk Song #3\" (\"Satin Sheets\") was originally recorded for ''Freak Show'', but was omitted from the album and included on ''[[Neon Ballroom]]'' (1999) instead.\n\nAn unreleased song entitled \"Slime\" was recorded during the ''Freak Show'' sessions, but it has yet to be released. The existence of \"Slime\" can originally be traced back to the 1996 late October/early November European press release where it is listed amongst the rest of the ''Freak Show'' track listing. The song was described in the press release as \"similar to 'No Association'\" but \"more melodic\". Thematically-speaking, it was described as the \"linchpin\" of the entire album.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n== Release ==\nAlthough ''Freak Show'' was shelved until February 1997 for the general public, European and Australian promotional pressings were officially circulated throughout the music press in late October/early November 1996.

[[Silverchair]]. It was recorded during May\u2013November 1996 and released on 4 February 1997 by record labels [[Murmur (record label)|Murmur]] and [[Epic Records|Epic]]. It was nominated for the 1997 [[ARIA Music Awards of 1997|ARIA Music Award]] for Best Group, but lost to [[Savage Garden (Savage Garden album)|Savage Garden]].\n\n== Recording and production ==\n[[Silverchair]] began recording their second studio album, ''Freak Show'', in May 1996 while experiencing the success of their debut album, 1995's ''[[Frogstomp]]'', in Australia and the US.\n\n''Freak Show'' was produced by [[Nick Launay]] ([[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]], [[Models (band)|Models]], [[Midnight Oil]]).<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\">{{cite web | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/62OUYFdii?url=http://www.howlspace.com.au/en2/silverchair/silverchair.htm | url = http://www.howlspace.com.au/en2/silverchair/silverchair.htm | title = Silverchair | work = HowlSpace \u2013 The Living History of Our Music | last = Nimmervoll | first = Ed | authorlink = Ed Nimmervoll | publisher = White Room Electronic Publishing Pty Ltd | archivedate = 13 October 2011 | accessdate = 13 October 2011 | url-status = dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Spencer\">{{cite book| last1 = Spencer| first1 = Chris| first2 = Paul | last2 = McHenry | first3 = Zbig | last3 = Nowara| title = The Who's Who of Australian Rock | origyear = 1989| year = 2007| publisher = Moonlight Publishing| isbn = 978-1-86503-891-9| chapter = 'silverchair' entry }}</ref>\n\n== Content ==\nFrontman [[Daniel Johns]] described the album's title in 1997 by comparing the on-the-road life of Silverchair to that of a [[traveling carnival]]. The album's front cover image is an illustration of [[Grady Stiles|Grady Stiles, Jr.]], a sideshow performer afflicted with [[ectrodactyly]], who used the stage name \"Lobster Boy\". The image is courtesy of Circus World Museum, Baraboo, Wisconsin.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McIver |first1=Stuart |title=Murder in the Tropics |date=1995 |publisher=Pineapple Press |isbn=1561644412 |page=43 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rIzFh7AeAI8C&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43&dq=Lobster+Boy+Circus+World+Museum&source=bl&ots=kFR_SXvyZO&sig=CZ2AVHTos5UDHU4gA0ZbhgCFL0c&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjCxtbRsb_bAhXh54MKHYNNBzIQ6AEImAEwDA#v=onepage&q=Lobster%20Boy%20Circus%20World%20Museum&f=false}}</ref>\n\nJohns also stated that some of the lyrics were toned-down for release on ''Freak Show''. Although, the majority of the songs found on the album still retain emotional and angst-fueled themes that include disease and suicide. One writer claimed the songs focused on the anger and backlash that the expectations of ''Frogstomp'' brought upon the band.<ref name=\"Wooldridge\">{{Cite news | title = ''Freak Show'' Review | work = Juice | first = Simon | last = Wooldridge | date = February 1997 }}</ref>\n\nMany ''Freak Show'' songs such as \"Slave\", \"Freak\", \"No Association\", and \"Nobody Came\" were performed live two years prior to their release on the album.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} A demo version of \"Freak\" is featured in trailers for the 1995 space combat film ''[[Screamers (1995 film)|Screamers]]''. This is one of the aforementioned ''Freak Show'' songs that Silverchair debuted live as early as January 1995.<ref>https://thebrag.com/looking-back-silverchairs-freak-show-20-years-later</ref>\n\nSeveral of the songs also had different titles prior to the album's release.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} These include: \"Cat and Mouse\" (\"The Closing\"), \"The Proxy Song\" (\"The Door\"), and \"Punk Song #1\" (\"Lie to Me\"). A song entitled \"Punk Song #2\" was recorded but not renamed; it later appeared on the \"[[Freak (Silverchair song)|Freak]]\" single. \"Punk Song #3\" (\"Satin Sheets\") was originally recorded for ''Freak Show'', but was omitted from the album and included on ''[[Neon Ballroom]]'' (1999) instead.\n\nAn unreleased song entitled \"Slime\" was recorded during the ''Freak Show'' sessions, but it has yet to be released. The existence of \"Slime\" can originally be traced back to the 1996 late October/early November European press release where it is listed amongst the rest of the ''Freak Show'' track listing. The song was described in the press release as \"similar to 'No Association'\" but \"more melodic\". Thematically-speaking, it was described as the \"linchpin\" of the entire album.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n== Release ==\nAlthough ''Freak Show'' was shelved until February 1997 for the general public, European and Australian promotional pressings were officially circulated throughout the music press in late October/early November 1996. The release of ''Freak Show'' was originally slated for the autumn of 1996; it was later pushed back to avoid competition from [[Pearl Jam]]'s ''[[No Code]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n''Freak Show'' was released on 4 February 1997.

He said: <blockquote>During the recording of ''Freak Show'' they were incredibly wild and young, the energy and adrenaline in the room was like the biggest sugar rush imaginable.
