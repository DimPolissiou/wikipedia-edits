Large areas would be brought under tree plantation, arrangements would be made for water conservation and waste water recycling, and non-conventional energy resources would be used to the maximum.<ref>[https://www.sarkariepress.com/cgpsc-online-form-8423-2/ Chhattisgarh PSC Recruitment 2020]</ref>\n* It would reflect the rich heritage and culture of Chhattisgarh and India in its urban design and architecture.

However, a diversification of economy is desirable, which would be attained through the following activities:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nayaraipur.com/nayaraipur/leftmenu/economic.aspx?ival=17 |accessdate=12 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007205255/http://www.nayaraipur.com/nayaraipur/leftmenu/economic.aspx?ival=17 |archivedate=7 October 2008 }}</ref>\n* Software technology park\n* Gems, jewellery and other similar industries\n* Business offices\n* Health, education and research services\n* Regional recreational activities\n* Nandan Van Zoo & Safari\n* International cricket stadium\n* 5 star hotels\n* 18 hole golf course and golf villas\n* Museums\n* Art gallery and library\n* Garden\n* Botanical garden\n* Lakes\n\n== Planning methodology ==\n\nWhile venturing to prepare the development plan for Naya Raipur, basic studies were made in the form of a secondary survey of data on [[Chandigarh]] (the first planned capital of a state in independent India) and Raipur, the elder sister and the most important \u201corganic\u201d metropolis in the region.\n\nThe space quantum against each activity/work-centre was then ascertained going by the accepted thumb-rule of the concerned industry/trade/activity, to the case of capital complex, and exact figures of  government jobs were taken into consideration. The resultant space quantum was then allocated on two-dimension on the structure plan and final quantum, shape, location, was defined by exact boundaries/roads on the plan.\n\nWith iterations, the allocated spaces were again translated in terms of number of jobs and the total number of job in the city arrived at. With a population of 5.6 lakhs, the Naya Raipur City is expected to generate approximately 2.2 lakh jobs, with an assumed workforce participation rate of 40%. The high standards of physical and social infrastructure adopted for the city will be able to cope with the maximum capacity of the city.[https://www.sarkariepress.com/cgpsc-online-form-8423-2/ Chhattisgarh PSC Job 2020 ]</ref>\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Roads ===\n* Length of proposed roads: 225&nbsp;km\n* Construction work on 71&nbsp;km of road has been started (100&nbsp;m and 60&nbsp;m row)\n* Construction agency: M/s B.

The design will be a grid pattern city plan. One of the major influences of the design was [[Kuala Lumpur]]'s new capital complex at [[Putrajaya]].\n\n=== Zoo ===\n\nThe site where the Nandan Van Zoo & Safari, Naya Raipur is proposed, is located at 35&nbsp;km from the main [[Raipur Junction railway station]], 30&nbsp;km from the [[Raipur Bus Stand]] and 15&nbsp;km from the [[Swami Vivekananda Airport]] Raipur. Its gross area is 202.87 hectare.

NRDA is the nodal agency undertaking comprehensive development of this [[Greenfield land|'greenfield']] city.\n\nChief executive officers are appointed by government and other officers and staff working under NRDA organisation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nayaraipur.com/nayaraipur/topmenu/aboutnrda.aspx |accessdate=12 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406202259/http://www.nayaraipur.com/nayaraipur/topmenu/aboutnrda.aspx |archivedate=6 April 2009 }}</ref> [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS) officer P.

Large areas would be brought under tree plantation, arrangements would be made for water conservation and waste water recycling, and non-conventional energy resources would be used to the maximum.<ref>[http://www.nayaraipur.com/nayaraipur/leftmenu/VisionForDevelopment.aspx?ival=2]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref>\n* It would reflect the rich heritage and culture of Chhattisgarh and India in its urban design and architecture. Special efforts would be taken to make it a people friendly and visitor friendly city.<ref name=\"nayaraipur.com\">[https://realtimes.in/single.php?id=9125 |date=May 2013}}</ref>\n* The city's design would a promote sense of security and comfort among its citizens, especially women, children and the physically challenged.<ref name=\"nayaraipur.com\" />\n\n== Economic base ==\n\nThe main activity base of Naya Raipur would be the government/state capital functions. However, a diversification of economy is desirable, which would be attained through the following activities:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nayaraipur.com/nayaraipur/leftmenu/economic.aspx?ival=17 |accessdate=12 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007205255/http://www.nayaraipur.com/nayaraipur/leftmenu/economic.aspx?ival=17 |archivedate=7 October 2008 }}</ref>\n* Software technology park\n* Gems, jewellery and other similar industries\n* Business offices\n* Health, education and research services\n* Regional recreational activities\n* Nandan Van Zoo & Safari\n* International cricket stadium\n* 5 star hotels\n* 18 hole golf course and golf villas\n* Museums\n* Art gallery and library\n* Garden\n* Botanical garden\n* Lakes\n\n== Planning methodology ==\n\nWhile venturing to prepare the development plan for Naya Raipur, basic studies were made in the form of a secondary survey of data on [[Chandigarh]] (the first planned capital of a state in independent India) and Raipur, the elder sister and the most important \u201corganic\u201d metropolis in the region.\n\nThe space quantum against each activity/work-centre was then ascertained going by the accepted thumb-rule of the concerned industry/trade/activity, to the case of capital complex, and exact figures of  government jobs were taken into consideration. The resultant space quantum was then allocated on two-dimension on the structure plan and final quantum, shape, location, was defined by exact boundaries/roads on the plan.\n\nWith iterations, the allocated spaces were again translated in terms of number of jobs and the total number of job in the city arrived at. With a population of 5.6 lakhs, the Naya Raipur City is expected to generate approximately 2.2 lakh jobs, with an assumed workforce participation rate of 40%. The high standards of physical and social infrastructure adopted for the city will be able to cope with the maximum capacity of the city.<ref name=\"nayaraipur.in\">[http://www.nayaraipur.in/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=48&Itemid=53]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Roads ===\n* Length of proposed roads: 225&nbsp;km\n* Construction work on 71&nbsp;km of road has been started (100&nbsp;m and 60&nbsp;m row)\n* Construction agency: M/s B.

The design will be a grid pattern city plan. One of the major influences of the design was [[Kuala Lumpur]]'s new capital complex at [[Putrajaya]].\n\n=== Zoo ===\n\nThe site where the Nandan Van Zoo & Safari, Naya Raipur is proposed, is located at 35&nbsp;km from the main [[Raipur Junction railway station]], 30&nbsp;km from the [[Raipur Bus Stand]] and 15&nbsp;km from the [[Swami Vivekananda Airport]] Raipur.

A sequel to 2013's ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]'', it is the seventh installment in the ''[[Fast & Furious]]'' franchise and stars [[Vin Diesel]], [[Paul Walker]], [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[Tyrese Gibson]], [[Ludacris|Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges]], [[Jordana Brewster]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Kurt Russell]] and [[Jason Statham]]. ''Furious 7'' follows [[Dominic Toretto]] (Diesel), [[Brian O'Conner]] (Walker), and the rest of their team, who have returned to the [[United States]] to live normal lives after securing amnesty for their past crimes in ''Fast & Furious 6'', until Deckard Shaw (Statham), a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his comatose younger brother Owen Shaw, puts the team in danger once again.\n\nWith the previous three installments set between ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'' (2003) and ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' (2006), ''Furious 7'' is the first installment in the franchise to take place after ''Tokyo Drift''. The film also marks the final film appearance of Walker, who died in a [[single-vehicle crash]] on November 30, 2013, with filming only half-completed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fast and Furious star Paul Walker killed in car crash|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/01/paul-walker-dies-car-crash|work=Guardian|first=Catherine|last=Shoard|date=1 December 2013}}</ref> Following Walker's death, filming was delayed for script rewrites and his brothers, Caleb and [[Cody Walker (actor)|Cody]], were used as stand-ins to complete his remaining scenes.<ref name=\"Brothers\">{{cite news|title=Paul Walker's Surprising Replacement in Fast & Furious 7|url=http://time.com/64024/paul-walker-replacement-fast-furious-7/|accessdate=25 May 2015|work=[[Time.com]]|publisher=Nolan Feeney|date=April 15, 2014}}</ref> These script rewrites completed the story arc for Walker's character, which was subsequently retired.\n\nPlans for a seventh installment were first announced in February 2012 when Johnson stated that production on the film would begin after the completion of ''Fast & Furious 6''. In April 2013, Wan, predominantly known for horror films, was announced to direct the film in place of [[Justin Lin]], who left the franchise after directing the previous four installments. Casting began in the same month with the returns of Diesel and Walker and an initial release date was set. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in September 2013, resumed in April 2014 and ended in July 2014, with other filming locations including [[Los Angeles]], [[Colorado]], [[Abu Dhabi]] and [[Tokyo]].\n\n''Furious 7'' premiered in Los Angeles on April 1, 2015 and was theatrically released in the United States on April 3, 2015, playing in [[3D film|3D]], [[IMAX 3D]], and [[4DX]] internationally. Upon release, the film became a critical and blockbuster success, with praise being aimed at the film's action sequences and its emotional tribute to Walker. The film grossed $397.6 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which is the [[List of highest-grossing openings for films|tenth highest-grossing opening of all time]]. The film has grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of the franchise after just twelve days, the third highest-grossing [[2015 in film|film of 2015]]<ref>{{cite web|title = 5 Success Lessons Learned From 'Fast and Furious' Franchise|url = http://www.empirehive.com/success-lessons-learned-from-fast-and-furious/|website = EmpireHive|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}</ref> and the [[List of highest-grossing films|ninth highest-grossing film of all time]].\n\nA sequel, ''[[The Fate of the Furious]]'', was released on April 14, 2017.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature-length films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nAfter defeating Owen Shaw and his crew and securing amnesty for their past crimes,{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]''.}} [[Dominic Toretto|Dominic \"Dom\" Toretto]], [[Brian O'Conner]], and the rest of their team have returned to the United States to live normal lives again. Brian begins to accustom himself to life as a father, while Dom tries to help Letty Ortiz regain her memory. Meanwhile, Owen's older brother, Deckard Shaw, breaks into the secure hospital that the comatose Owen is being held in and swears vengeance against Dom and his team, before breaking into Luke Hobbs' FBI office to extract profiles of Dom's crew. After revealing his identity, Shaw engages Hobbs in a fight, and escapes when he detonates a bomb that severely injures Hobbs. Dom later learns from his sister Mia that she is pregnant again and convinces her to tell Brian. However, a [[letter bomb]] sent from [[Tokyo]], explodes and destroys the Toretto house just seconds after Han, a member of Dom's team, is apparently killed by Shaw in Tokyo.{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the 2006 film ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' and ''Fast & Furious 6''.}} Dom visits Hobbs in a hospital, where he learns that Shaw is a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his brother. Dom travels to Tokyo to claim Han's body, and acquires personal items found at Han's crash site from Han's friend, Sean Boswell.\n\nDuring Han's funeral in [[Los Angeles]], Dom notices a car observing them, and after a chase, confronts its driver, who is revealed to be Shaw. Shaw flees when a covert ops team arrives and opens fire, led by [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Mr. Nobody|Mr. Nobody]]. Nobody says that he will assist Dom in stopping Shaw if he helps him obtain God's Eye, a computer program that uses digital devices to track down a person, and save its creator, a hacker named Ramsey, from a mercenary named Mose Jakande. Dom, Brian, Letty, Roman Pearce, and Tej Parker then [[airdrop]] their cars over the [[Caucasus Mountains]] in Azerbaijan, ambush Jakande's convoy, and rescue Ramsey. The team then heads to [[Abu Dhabi]], where a billionaire has acquired the flash drive containing God's Eye, and manages to steal it from the owner. With God's Eye near [[repeater|telecommunications repeaters]], the team tracks down Shaw, who is waiting at a remote factory. Dom, Brian, Nobody and his team attempt to capture Shaw, but are ambushed by Jakande and his men, and are forced to flee while Jakande obtains God's Eye. At his own request, the injured Nobody is left behind to be evacuated by helicopter while Brian and Dom continue without him. To reduce their disadvantage, the crew returns to Los Angeles to fight Shaw, Jakande and his men. Meanwhile, Brian promises Mia that once they deal with Shaw, he will retire and fully dedicate himself to their family.\n\nWhile Jakande pursues Brian and the rest of the team with a [[stealth helicopter]] and an [[unmanned combat aerial vehicle|aerial drone]], Ramsey attempts to hack into God's Eye. Hobbs, seeing the team in trouble, leaves the hospital and destroys the drone with an ambulance. Brian engages Jakande's henchman Kiet and throws him down an elevator shaft before hijacking a signal repeater tower, allowing Ramsey to regain control of God's Eye and shut it down. Dom and Shaw engage in a one-on-one brawl on top of a public parking garage, before Jakande intervenes and attacks them both. Shaw is defeated when part of the parking garage collapses beneath him. Dom then launches his vehicle at Jakande's helicopter, tossing Shaw's bag of grenades onto its skids, though his car crash-lands. Hobbs then shoots the bag of grenades from ground level, destroying the helicopter and killing Jakande. Dom is pulled from the wreckage of his car, believed to be dead. As Letty cradles Dom's body in her arms, she reveals that she has regained her memories, and that she remembers their wedding. Dom regains consciousness soon after, remarking, \"It's about time\".\n\nShaw is taken into custody by Hobbs and locked away in a secret, high-security prison. At a beach, Brian and Mia play with their son while Dom, Letty, Roman, Tej, and Ramsey observe, acknowledging that Brian is better off retired with his family. As Dom silently leaves, Ramsey asks if he intends to say goodbye. Dom says, \"It's never goodbye.\" He drives away, but Brian catches up with him at a crossroad. \n\nAs Dom remembers the times that he had with Brian, they bid each other farewell and drive off in separate directions.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:PaulWalkerEdit-1.jpg|175px|right|thumb|''Furious 7'' marked the final film performance of [[Paul Walker]], who died in a car accident on November 30, 2013.

Both would be written by [[Chris Morgan (writer)|Chris Morgan]] and directed by [[Justin Lin]], who had been the franchise's writer and director, respectively, since ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' (2006).<ref name=\"SequelLaTimes\"/> On December 20, 2011, following the release of ''[[Fast Five]]'', [[Vin Diesel]] stated that ''Fast Six'' would be split into two parts, with writing for the two films occurring simultaneously. On the decision, Diesel said:<ref name=\"SequelDec20\"/>\n\n<blockquote>We have to pay off this story, we have to service all of these character relationships, and when we started mapping all that out it just went beyond 110 pages&nbsp; ... &nbsp;The studio said, 'You can't fit all that story in one damn movie!'<ref name=\"SequelDec20\"/></blockquote>\n\nHowever, in an interview on February 15, 2012, [[Dwayne Johnson]] stated that the two intended sequels would no longer be filmed simultaneously because of weather issues in filming locations, and that production on ''Fast Seven'' would only begin after the completion of ''Fast Six''.<ref name=\"SequelFeb1512\"/>\n\nIn April 2013, during post-production of the retitled ''Fast & Furious 6'', Lin announced that he would not return to direct a seventh film, as the studio wanted to produce the film on an accelerated schedule for release in summer 2014. This would have required Lin to begin pre-production on the sequel while performing post-production on ''Fast & Furious 6'', which he considered would affect the quality of the final product. Despite the usual two-year gap between the previous installments, Universal chose to pursue a sequel quicker due to having fewer reliable franchises than its competitor studios.<ref name=\"Sequel1\"/> However, subsequent interviews with Lin have suggested that the sixth film was always intended to be the final installment under his direction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: Fast & Furious 6 Director Justin Lin|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=104306|work=Comingsoon.net|accessdate=October 29, 2013|date=May 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2013, Australian director [[James Wan]], predominantly known for [[horror film]]s, was announced as the sequel's director, with [[Neal H.

The film also marks the final film appearance of Walker, who died in a [[single-vehicle crash]] on November 30, 2013, with filming only half-completed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fast and Furious star Paul Walker killed in car crash|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/01/paul-walker-dies-car-crash|work=Guardian|first=Catherine|last=Shoard|date=1 December 2013}}</ref> Following Walker's death, filming was delayed for script rewrites and his brothers, Caleb and [[Cody Walker (actor)|Cody]], were used as stand-ins to complete his remaining scenes.<ref name=\"Brothers\">{{cite news|title=Paul Walker's Surprising Replacement in Fast & Furious 7|url=http://time.com/64024/paul-walker-replacement-fast-furious-7/|accessdate=25 May 2015|work=[[Time.com]]|publisher=Nolan Feeney|date=April 15, 2014}}</ref> These script rewrites completed the story arc for Walker's character, which was subsequently retired.\n\nPlans for a seventh installment were first announced in February 2012 when Johnson stated that production on the film would begin after the completion of ''Fast & Furious 6''. In April 2013, Wan, predominantly known for horror films, was announced to direct the film in place of [[Justin Lin]], who left the franchise after directing the previous four installments. Casting began in the same month with the returns of Diesel and Walker and an initial release date was set. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in September 2013, resumed in April 2014 and ended in July 2014, with other filming locations including [[Los Angeles]], [[Colorado]], [[Abu Dhabi]] and [[Tokyo]].\n\n''Furious 7'' premiered in Los Angeles on April 1, 2015 and was theatrically released in the United States on April 3, 2015, playing in [[3D film|3D]], [[IMAX 3D]], and [[4DX]] internationally. Upon release, the film became a critical and blockbuster success, with praise being aimed at the film's action sequences and its emotional tribute to Walker. The film grossed $397.6 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which is the [[List of highest-grossing openings for films|tenth highest-grossing opening of all time]].

Brian begins to accustom himself to life as a father, while Dom tries to help Letty Ortiz regain her memory. Meanwhile, Owen's older brother, Deckard Shaw, breaks into the secure hospital that the comatose Owen is being held in and swears vengeance against Dom and his team, before breaking into Luke Hobbs' FBI office to extract profiles of Dom's crew. After revealing his identity, Shaw engages Hobbs in a fight, and escapes when he detonates a bomb that severely injures Hobbs. Dom later learns from his sister Mia that she is pregnant again and convinces her to tell Brian. However, a [[letter bomb]] sent from [[Tokyo]], explodes and destroys the Toretto house just seconds after Han, a member of Dom's team, is apparently killed by Shaw in Tokyo.{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the 2006 film ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' and ''Fast & Furious 6''.}} Dom visits Hobbs in a hospital, where he learns that Shaw is a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his brother. Dom travels to Tokyo to claim Han's body, and acquires personal items found at Han's crash site from Han's friend, Sean Boswell.\n\nDuring Han's funeral in [[Los Angeles]], Dom notices a car observing them, and after a chase, confronts its driver, who is revealed to be Shaw. Shaw flees when a covert ops team arrives and opens fire, led by [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Mr. Nobody|Mr. Nobody]]. Nobody says that he will assist Dom in stopping Shaw if he helps him obtain God's Eye, a computer program that uses digital devices to track down a person, and save its creator, a hacker named Ramsey, from a mercenary named Mose Jakande. Dom, Brian, Letty, Roman Pearce, and Tej Parker then [[airdrop]] their cars over the [[Caucasus Mountains]] in Azerbaijan, ambush Jakande's convoy, and rescue Ramsey. The team then heads to [[Abu Dhabi]], where a billionaire has acquired the flash drive containing God's Eye, and manages to steal it from the owner. With God's Eye near [[repeater|telecommunications repeaters]], the team tracks down Shaw, who is waiting at a remote factory. Dom, Brian, Nobody and his team attempt to capture Shaw, but are ambushed by Jakande and his men, and are forced to flee while Jakande obtains God's Eye. At his own request, the injured Nobody is left behind to be evacuated by helicopter while Brian and Dom continue without him. To reduce their disadvantage, the crew returns to Los Angeles to fight Shaw, Jakande and his men. Meanwhile, Brian promises Mia that once they deal with Shaw, he will retire and fully dedicate himself to their family.\n\nWhile Jakande pursues Brian and the rest of the team with a [[stealth helicopter]] and an [[unmanned combat aerial vehicle|aerial drone]], Ramsey attempts to hack into God's Eye. Hobbs, seeing the team in trouble, leaves the hospital and destroys the drone with an ambulance. Brian engages Jakande's henchman Kiet and throws him down an elevator shaft before hijacking a signal repeater tower, allowing Ramsey to regain control of God's Eye and shut it down. Dom and Shaw engage in a one-on-one brawl on top of a public parking garage, before Jakande intervenes and attacks them both. Shaw is defeated when part of the parking garage collapses beneath him. Dom then launches his vehicle at Jakande's helicopter, tossing Shaw's bag of grenades onto its skids, though his car crash-lands. Hobbs then shoots the bag of grenades from ground level, destroying the helicopter and killing Jakande. Dom is pulled from the wreckage of his car, believed to be dead. As Letty cradles Dom's body in her arms, she reveals that she has regained her memories, and that she remembers their wedding. Dom regains consciousness soon after, remarking, \"It's about time\".\n\nShaw is taken into custody by Hobbs and locked away in a secret, high-security prison. At a beach, Brian and Mia play with their son while Dom, Letty, Roman, Tej, and Ramsey observe, acknowledging that Brian is better off retired with his family. As Dom silently leaves, Ramsey asks if he intends to say goodbye. Dom says, \"It's never goodbye.\" He drives away, but Brian catches up with him at a crossroad. \n\nAs Dom remembers the times that he had with Brian, they bid each other farewell and drive off in separate directions.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:PaulWalkerEdit-1.jpg|175px|right|thumb|''Furious 7'' marked the final film performance of [[Paul Walker]], who died in a car accident on November 30, 2013.

This would have required Lin to begin pre-production on the sequel while performing post-production on ''Fast & Furious 6'', which he considered would affect the quality of the final product. Despite the usual two-year gap between the previous installments, Universal chose to pursue a sequel quicker due to having fewer reliable franchises than its competitor studios.<ref name=\"Sequel1\"/> However, subsequent interviews with Lin have suggested that the sixth film was always intended to be the final installment under his direction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: Fast & Furious 6 Director Justin Lin|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=104306|work=Comingsoon.net|accessdate=October 29, 2013|date=May 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2013, Australian director [[James Wan]], predominantly known for [[horror film]]s, was announced as the sequel's director, with [[Neal H.

Hurricane Raymond was the strongest storm of the season, but weakened significantly before landfall.\n\n__TOC__\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Seasonal summary==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:215\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/01/1989 till:01/12/1989\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/01/1989\n\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1)  legend:Tropical_Depression_=_&lt;39_mph_(0-62_km/h)\n  id:TS     value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)  legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39-73_mph_(63-117 km/h)\n  id:C1     value:rgb(1,1,0.80)     legend:Category_1_=_74-95_mph_(118-153_km/h)\n  id:C2     value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46)  legend:Category_2_=_96-110_mph_(154-177_km/h)\n  id:C3     value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)  legend:Category_3_=_111-130_mph_(178-209-km/h)\n  id:C4     value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13)  legend:Category_4_=_131-155_mph_(210-249_km/h)\n  id:C5     value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)  legend:Category_5_=_&gt;156_mph_(&gt;250_km/h)\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=\n\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:09/01/1989 till:15/01/1989 color:TS text:\"Winona (TS)\"\n  barset:break\n  from:31/05/1989 till:05/06/1989 color:TS text:\"Adolph (TS)\"\n  from:15/06/1989 till:20/06/1989 color:C1 text:\"Barbara (C1)\"\n  from:18/06/1989 till:23/06/1989 color:C1 text:\"[[Hurricane Cosme (1989)|Cosme (C1)]]\"\n  from:09/07/1989 till:14/07/1989 color:TD text:\"Four-E (TD)\"\n  from:10/07/1989 till:16/07/1989 color:TD text:\"Five-E (TD)\"\n  from:11/07/1989 till:21/07/1989 color:C1 text:\"[[Hurricane Dalilia (1989)|Dalilia (C1)]]\"\n  from:16/07/1989 till:18/07/1989 color:TD text:\"Seven-E (TD)\"\n  from:19/07/1989 till:21/07/1989 color:TS text:\"Erick (TS)\"\n  barset:break\n  from:23/07/1989 till:28/07/1989 color:TS text:\"Flossie (TS)\"\n  from:30/07/1989 till:05/08/1989 color:C1 text:\"Gil (C1)\"\n  from:14/08/1989 till:25/08/1989 color:C3 text:\"Ismael (C3)\"\n  from:15/08/1989 till:17/08/1989 color:TS text: \"Henriette (TS)\"\n  from:21/08/1989 till:25/08/1989 color:TS text:\"Juliette (TS)\"\n  from:25/08/1989 till:29/08/1989 color:C3 text:\"[[Hurricane Kiko (1989)|Kiko (C3)]]\"\n  from:27/08/1989 till:06/09/1989 color:C1 text:\"Lorena (C1)\"\n  from:28/08/1989 till:31/08/1989 color:TS text:\"Manuel (TS)\"\n  barset:break\n  from:03/09/1989 till:07/09/1989 color:TS text:\"Narda (TS)\"\n  from:08/09/1989 till:16/09/1989 color:C4 text:\"[[Hurricane Octave (1989)|Octave (C4)]]\"\n  from:21/09/1989 till:25/09/1989 color:TS text:\"Priscilla (TS)\"\n  from:25/09/1989 till:27/09/1989 color:TD text:\"Twenty-E (TD)\"\n  from:25/09/1989 till:05/10/1989 color:C4 text:\"[[Hurricane Raymond (1989)|Raymond (C4)]]\"\n  from:03/10/1989 till:04/10/1989 color:TD text:\n  barset:break\n   barset:skip\n   barset:skip\n   barset:skip\n   barset:skip\n   barset:skip\n  from:07/10/1989 till:08/10/1989 color:TD text:\"Twenty Two-E (TD)\"\n  from:15/10/1989 till:17/10/1989 color:TD text:\"Twenty Three-E (TD)\"\n  from:18/10/1989 till:19/10/1989 color:TD text:\"Twenty Four-E (TD)\"\n\n  bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/01/1989 till:01/02/1989 text:January\n  from:01/02/1989 till:01/03/1989 text:February\n  from:01/03/1989 till:01/04/1989 text:March\n  from:01/04/1989 till:01/05/1989 text:April\n  from:01/05/1989 till:01/06/1989 text:May\n  from:01/06/1989 till:01/07/1989 text:June\n  from:01/07/1989 till:01/08/1989 text:July\n  from:01/08/1989 till:01/09/1989 text:August\n  from:01/09/1989 till:01/10/1989 text:September\n  from:01/10/1989 till:01/11/1989 text:October\n  from:01/11/1989 till:01/12/1989 text:November\n\n</timeline>\n</center>\nOverall, the season continued the general trend in the 1980s of near to above-average seasons in the East Pacific.<ref name=\"EPAC Book\"/> Seventeen cyclones formed. Eight peaked at tropical storm strength. Nine systems became hurricanes, of which four were major hurricanes at Category&nbsp;3 intensity or higher on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. On August 28, three systems were active, one of a few times when there has been three tropical cyclones active simultaneously (Kiko, Lorena, and Manuel) in the east Pacific (west of 140\u00b0W).{{EPAC hurricane best track}} Despite the activity this season, no named storms formed in October.

Initially, the system was hampered by wind shear as it moved west-northwestward to the south of Hawaii; however, by January&nbsp;11, the system was able to maintain convection over its center and was classified as a tropical depression. On January&nbsp;13, it was estimated in post-storm analysis to have become a tropical storm at an unprecedented {{coord|20.7|-170.5}}. Meteorologists at the time struggled to forecast the storm as climatological forecast guidance (modeling based off previous cyclones), was not available due to the uniqueness of Winona. On January&nbsp;15, the system crossed the [[International Dateline]] and entered the Western Pacific basin.\n\nAs a tropical depression, Winona brought heavy rains to portions of Hawaii, triggering flash flooding on a few islands. No damage resulted from the floods. After becoming a tropical storm, the system brushed Wake Island, bringing gusty winds and moderate rainfall. Several days later, the storm passed near the [[Mariana Islands]] and [[Guam]], bringing tropical storm-force wind gusts and heavy rainfall. Minor damage resulted from Winona but there was no loss of life. Operationally, this system was not classified a tropical storm until January 16, thus it was not warned upon by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center during its early stages.<ref name=\"WinonaJTWC\">{{cite report|author=Lt.

Eight peaked at tropical storm strength. Nine systems became hurricanes, of which four were major hurricanes at Category&nbsp;3 intensity or higher on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. On August 28, three systems were active, one of a few times when there has been three tropical cyclones active simultaneously (Kiko, Lorena, and Manuel) in the east Pacific (west of 140\u00b0W).{{EPAC hurricane best track}} Despite the activity this season, no named storms formed in October. This was the second consecutive season this happened.{{Tropical Cyclones of the Eastern North Pacific Basin, 1949-2006|refname=EPAC Book}}\n\n==Systems==\n\n===Tropical Storm Winona===\n{{Infobox Hurricane Small\n|Basin=EPac\n|Image=Tropical Storm Winona 1989.jpg\n|Track=Winona 1989 track.png\n|Formed=January 9\n|Dissipated=January 15 <small>([[1989 Pacific typhoon season#Tropical Storm Winona|Exited basin]])</small>\n|1-min winds=40\n|Pressure=\n}}\n{{See also|List of off-season Pacific hurricanes}}\nDuring the second week of January, an upper-level trough located east of [[Hawaii]] created an area of divergence to its southeast, allowing an area of low pressure to develop alongside deep convection. Initially, the system was hampered by wind shear as it moved west-northwestward to the south of Hawaii; however, by January&nbsp;11, the system was able to maintain convection over its center and was classified as a tropical depression. On January&nbsp;13, it was estimated in post-storm analysis to have become a tropical storm at an unprecedented {{coord|20.7|-170.5}}. Meteorologists at the time struggled to forecast the storm as climatological forecast guidance (modeling based off previous cyclones), was not available due to the uniqueness of Winona. On January&nbsp;15, the system crossed the [[International Dateline]] and entered the Western Pacific basin.\n\nAs a tropical depression, Winona brought heavy rains to portions of Hawaii, triggering flash flooding on a few islands. No damage resulted from the floods. After becoming a tropical storm, the system brushed Wake Island, bringing gusty winds and moderate rainfall. Several days later, the storm passed near the [[Mariana Islands]] and [[Guam]], bringing tropical storm-force wind gusts and heavy rainfall. Minor damage resulted from Winona but there was no loss of life. Operationally, this system was not classified a tropical storm until January 16, thus it was not warned upon by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center during its early stages.<ref name=\"WinonaJTWC\">{{cite report|author=Lt.

He was reportedly replaced by Coco the Elephant in 1960 when [[Mexican-Americans]] complained about the ethnic stereotype. In 1963, the [[Hanna-Barbera]] character [[Snagglepuss]] took over as the mascot. Ogg the Caveman took over towards the end of 1967.\n\nBy the end of 1973, Tusk the Elephant became the mascot of the cereal, and he remained until the end of 1982, when [[Snap, Crackle and Pop]] (the mascots of Rice Krispies) replaced and retired Tusk the Elephant. In 1991, the mascot became Coco the Monkey. In 2001, Snap, Crackle, and Pop returned and they have remained the product's mascots to date.\n\nThe cereal was introduced in the [[United Kingdom]] under the \"Coco Pops\" name in 1961, with [[Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks|Mr. Jinks]] as the mascot. Later in the 1960s, Sweep (a dog hand puppet from the popular children's television programme ''[[The Sooty Show]]'') became the mascot for Coco Pops.\n\nIn 1963, Coco the Monkey was introduced, and he remains the mascot in those countries where the cereal is known as Coco Pops, Choco Krispies, and Choco Pops. In recent years, the design of Coco has been refined to give him a younger look. Coco's friends are Shortie Giraffe, Alan Anteater, Heftie Hippo, Ozmelda Ostrich, Kylie Kangaroo, and Rocky Raccoon, while Crafty Croc and the gorillas are his arch enemies.\n\nIn 1986, the cereal introduced the mascot Simmo. It became popular quickly, with a short stint on the face of the merchandise and packaging for Cocoa Krispies. The Simmo mascot featured on various materials for around about three months. Simmo also starred in an advert for the company in 1986, alongside a female companion who only appeared once named \"Heapo\", a cartoon [[hippopotamus]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130619225310/http://www.zimbio.com/Retro%2BTV%2BCommercials/articles/bqQ0wBnSZoe/1986%2BKelloggs%2BCoCo%2BPops]</ref>\n\nMore recent advertisements (2009) in the United Kingdom have opted away from using Coco and his friends, instead opting for things such as dancing milkmen and astronauts. Coco is still present on the box of the cereal and at the end of the advertisement, but is no longer the featured character. However, the cereal box of 2009 has Coco's head as the main feature, with the title 'Coco Pops' and a smaller cereal bowl, on the right of the box. Briefly, Coco was seen as a real-life chimp. As of 2011, Kellogg's decided to bring Coco and his friends, as well as Croc back, under a new space age style campaign, known as the \"Coco Pops Promise\".\n\nIn those countries where the cereal is known as \"Choco Krispis,\" an elephant is the mascot. In 1986, Kelloggs named the elephant \"Melvin\". Recently, he has been called \"Commando Melvin,\" due to commercials featuring him as a space-faring fighter and adventurer, although this is due to a misunderstanding, as Commando Melvin refers exclusively to the organization featured in the commercials, whose purpose is to defend the \"forti calcio plus\", a supposed ingredient in the cereal from aliens or other such villains.\n\nIn July 2014, in Mexico, due to concerns about the sugary and caloric contents of the cereal and the relation kids made with the friendly mascot, Melvin the elephant had a physical transformation from a traditional elephant body to an athletic body, resembling a strong teenager while keeping the head of the mascot.

Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein participate directly in the single market via the [[European Economic Area]], [[Switzerland]] does so via bilateral treaties and the other [[European microstates]] ([[Andorra]], [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]], [[Vatican City]]) have specific agreements with the EU and neighbouring countries, including their use of the [[euro]] as their currency. Most of these countries are also part of the [[Schengen Area]]. While this integration is designed as a substitute for full membership, there are ongoing debates in a number of these countries as to whether they should join as full members. Three (Norway, Iceland and Switzerland) have all previously had live applications to join the EU which have been withdrawn or otherwise frozen. Such applications could be resubmitted in the event of a change in the political landscape.\n\nGeorgia, Moldova and Ukraine ratified an Association Agreement with the EU and the [[European Parliament]] passed a resolution in 2014 stating that \"in accordance with Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, as well as any other European country, have a European perspective and can apply for EU membership in compliance with the principles of democracy, respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights, minority rights and ensuring the rule of rights.\"<ref name=\"en.trend.az\">{{cite web|url= https://en.trend.az/scaucasus/georgia/2264637.html|title=Georgia can apply for EU membership if it complies with democratic principles|date=18 April 2014|website=Trend.Az}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"EU perspective\"/><ref name=\"en.trend.az\"/> They also entered the [[Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area]] with the EU, that creates \"framework for modernising [...] trade relations and for economic development by the opening of markets via the progressive removal of customs tariffs and quotas, and by an extensive harmonisation of laws, norms and regulations in various trade-related sectors, creating the conditions for aligning key sectors\" of their economies with EU standards.<ref name=\"DCFTA Ukr\">[http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/april/tradoc_150981.pdf< EU-Ukraine Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. trade.ec.europa.eu.</ref>  However, the EU did not expand further into the [[post-Soviet states|post-Soviet space]] in the 2010s.<ref name=\"euobserver.com\">{{cite web|first=Andrew |last=Rettman |url=http://euobserver.com/9/31109 |title=EU unlikely to expand into post-Soviet east in next decade |publisher=Euobserver.com |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=7 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n<!---\n\nNOTE - AVOID WP:CRYSTAL BY KEEPING SPECULATION AND VAGUE PROPOSALS TO THE RELEVANT RELATIONS PAGES (i.e. Belarus\u2013European Union relations)\n\nAs discussed on talk page, we're including those with reasonable backing. That is that the proposal for membership must have one of the following;\n\n-Official government policy from within the last 5 years to pursue membership (not just a statement by someone that it would be nice) - examples: Serbia, Bosnia, Ukraine are all actively pursuing membership is a live government agenda. Ukraine has a European perspective and is making serious reforms even if they are not on the agenda as the first two are.\n\n-Party policy of one of the two largest parties in the national parliament from within the past 5 years - examples: San Marino membership is backed by most political parties, including ones who have been the largest recently, but is not government policy.

The referendum's result was that New Caledonia would remain a part of the French Republic.\n\n==See also==\n* [[European integration]]\n* [[Treaty of Accession 2011]]\n* [[Withdrawal from the European Union#Future withdrawals and major withdrawal campaigns|Withdrawal from the European Union]]\n* [[Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance]], a funding mechanism for EU candidate countries\n* [[Canada\u2013European Union relations]]\n* [[Israel\u2013European Union relations]]\n* [[Japan-European Union relations]]\n* [[South Korea-European Union relations]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em\n|refs=\n<ref name=\"DW 16.09.2014\">[http://www.dw.de/ukraine-ratifies-eu-association-agreement/a-17925681 Ukraine ratifies EU association agreement].

Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein participate directly in the single market via the [[European Economic Area]], [[Switzerland]] does so via bilateral treaties and the other [[European microstates]] ([[Andorra]], [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]], [[Vatican City]]) have specific agreements with the EU and neighbouring countries, including their use of the [[euro]] as their currency. Most of these countries are also part of the [[Schengen Area]]. While this integration is designed as a substitute for full membership, there are ongoing debates in a number of these countries as to whether they should join as full members. Three (Norway, Iceland and Switzerland) have all previously had live applications to join the EU which have been withdrawn or otherwise frozen. Such applications could be resubmitted in the event of a change in the political landscape.\n\nGeorgia, Moldova and Ukraine ratified an Association Agreement with the EU and the [[European Parliament]] passed a resolution in 2014 stating that \"in accordance with Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, as well as any other European country, have a European perspective and can apply for EU membership in compliance with the principles of democracy, respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights, minority rights and ensuring the rule of rights.\"<ref name=\"en.trend.az\">{{cite web|url= https://en.trend.az/scaucasus/georgia/2264637.html|title=Georgia can apply for EU membership if it complies with democratic principles|date=18 April 2014|website=Trend.Az}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"EU perspective\"/><ref name=\"en.trend.az\"/> They also entered the [[Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area]] with the EU, that creates \"framework for modernising [...] trade relations and for economic development by the opening of markets via the progressive removal of customs tariffs and quotas, and by an extensive harmonisation of laws, norms and regulations in various trade-related sectors, creating the conditions for aligning key sectors\" of their economies with EU standards.<ref name=\"DCFTA Ukr\">[http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/april/tradoc_150981.pdf< EU-Ukraine Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. trade.ec.europa.eu.</ref>  However, the EU did not expand further into the [[post-Soviet states|post-Soviet space]] in the 2010s.<ref name=\"euobserver.com\">{{cite web|first=Andrew |last=Rettman |url=http://euobserver.com/9/31109 |title=EU unlikely to expand into post-Soviet east in next decade |publisher=Euobserver.com |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=7 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n<!---\n\nNOTE - AVOID WP:CRYSTAL BY KEEPING SPECULATION AND VAGUE PROPOSALS TO THE RELEVANT RELATIONS PAGES (i.e. Belarus\u2013European Union relations)\n\nAs discussed on talk page, we're including those with reasonable backing. That is that the proposal for membership must have one of the following;\n\n-Official government policy from within the last 5 years to pursue membership (not just a statement by someone that it would be nice) - examples: Serbia, Bosnia, Ukraine are all actively pursuing membership is a live government agenda. Ukraine has a European perspective and is making serious reforms even if they are not on the agenda as the first two are.\n\n-Party policy of one of the two largest parties in the national parliament from within the past 5 years - examples: San Marino membership is backed by most political parties, including ones who have been the largest recently, but is not government policy. It did however result in a referendum so realistic moves can be expected.\n\n-A previous application to join the EU. - examples: Iceland, Norway, Swizterland. Debates remain live in these countries and applications have been unfrozen in the past.\n\nIf your source is merely someone, even in government, saying they'd like to pursue it - especially if that country has no European perspective - please keep it to the relations article until it progresses enough that it is a realistic possibility.\n\n---->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

Nor would it be clear on what terms it would be a member. 6.3 Some have argued that the rights conferred on individuals by EU citizenship might influence the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to somehow resist this outcome.

If Spain does not recognise the independence of a Catalan state, Catalonia cannot separately join the EU and it is still recognised as part of Spain's EU membership.\n\n===Flanders===\n{{Further|Flemish Movement|Partition of Belgium}}\nThere is an active movement towards Flemish independence, or union with the Netherlands, with the future status of [[Wallonia]] and [[Brussels]] (the [[Brussels and the European Union|''de facto'' capital of the EU]]) unclear as viable political states, perhaps producing a unique situation from Scotland and Catalonia.

The Common Fisheries Policy was introduced in 1970 for the very reason of getting access for the first EC members into waters of candidate countries, UK, Ireland and Denmark with the Faroe Islands.\n\nNevertheless, there are politicians, mainly in the right-wing [[Union Party (Faroe Islands)|Union Party]] (''Sambandsflokkurin''), led by their chairman [[Kaj Leo Johannesen]], who would like to see the Faroes as a member of the EU. However, the chairman of the left-wing [[Republic (Faroe Islands)|Republic]] (''Tj\u00f3\u00f0veldi''), [[H\u00f8gni Hoydal]], has expressed concerns that if the Faroes were to join the EU as is, they might vanish inside the EU, comparing this with the situation of the [[Shetland Islands]] and [[\u00c5land]] today, and wants the local government to solve the political situation between the Faroes and Denmark first.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portal.fo/sub_page/grein_pdf.php?ide=46055 |title=Portal.fo|language=fo |accessdate=7 January 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n[[Greenland]], a self-governing community that is part of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], entered the EC with Denmark in 1973, because it had no local independence at that time.

Rather than change their status from an OCT to an outermost region, as their change in status within the Netherlands would imply, it was decided that their status would remain the same for at least five years. After those five years, their status would be reviewed.\n\nIf it was decided that one or all of the islands wish to integrate more with the EU then the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] provides for that following a unanimous decision from the [[European Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/cg00014.en07.pdf|format=PDF|title=Treaty of Lisbon Article 2, point 293}}</ref> Former [[European Commissioner for Enlargement]] [[Danuta H\u00fcbner]] has said before the [[European Parliament]] that she does not expect many problems to occur with such a status change, as the population of the islands is only a few thousand people.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n===French overseas departments and territories===\nThe territories of [[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Mayotte]] and [[R\u00e9union]] are ''[[overseas department]]s'' of France and at the same time mono-departmental ''overseas region''s.
