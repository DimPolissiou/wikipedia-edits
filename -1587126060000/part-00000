G2A.COM's target demographic was young gamers with a lack of disposable income for video game purchases, so Go2Arena's objective became to sell video games at the lowest price possible. At that time, Bartosz Skwarczek approached many large developers at various events such as [[Gamescom]], [[E3]] and [[G-Star]] hoping to secure partnership deals in order tobecome an official seller of their games. Due to a lack of interest from developers, as well as fluctuations in market trends, the company's business model changed from retailer to marketplace.<ref name=\"g2a-history\">{{cite web|access-date=8 January 2016|date=3 January 2016|title=The Early History of G2A|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-early-history-of-g2a-563085251.html|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]}}</ref>\n\nSales numbers in 2016 showed the platform had processed 22 million transactions throughout the entire G2A ecosystem, which is valued at $313 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hbrp.pl/a/zachowalismy-energie-start-upu-w-duzej-firmie/D10Kntp71M|title=Zachowali\u015bmy energi\u0119 start-upu w du\u017cej firmie|last=Ro\u017cek|first=Dawid|date=August 2017|publisher=[[Harvard Business Review]]}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2018, a new product category was introduced to G2A Marketplace \u2013 electronics and merchandise tailored to gamers.

At that time, Bartosz Skwarczek approached many large developers at various events such as [[Gamescom]], [[E3]] and [[G-Star]] hoping to secure partnership deals in order tobecome an official seller of their games.
