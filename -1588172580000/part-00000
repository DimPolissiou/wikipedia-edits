Likewise, using \"[[10 Downing Street|Number 10]]\" to mean \"the Office of the [[Prime Minister (UK)|Prime Minister]]\" (of the United Kingdom) is a synecdoche.\n\n==Definition==\nSynecdoche is a [[rhetorical]] [[Trope (literature)|trope]] and a type of figurative speech similar to [[metonymy]]\u2014a figure of speech that uses a term that denotes one thing to refer to a related thing.<ref name=\"seu\">[http://mcl.as.uky.edu/glossary-rhetorical-terms#42 Glossary of Rhetorical Terms], University of Kentucky</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jakobson|first=Roman & Morris Halle|title=Fundamentals of Language|year=1956|publisher=Mouton|location=The Hague|isbn=978-1178718140|page=95}}</ref> Indeed, synecdoche is sometimes considered a subclass of metonymy.

It is used in reference to political relations, including \"having a footing\", to mean a country or organization is in a position to act, or \"the wrong hands\", to describe opposing groups, usually in the context of military power.<ref name=\"Political Metaphors\" >{{cite web |title=President Obama's State of the Union Address |work=Metaphors in American Politics |url=http://www.politicalmetaphors.com/tag/synecdoche/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305010025/http://www.politicalmetaphors.com/tag/synecdoche/ |archive-date=5 March 2014 |accessdate=2 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe two main types of synecdoche are ''microcosm'' and ''macrocosm''.

The residence of an executive is often credited for the executive's action. A spokesperson of the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States]] is identified in \"The [[White House]] announced a new plan to reduce hunger.\" References to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King or Queen of the United Kingdom]] are made in the same fashion by referring to today's official residence, [[Buckingham Palace]]. Worldwide examples include \"the [[Sublime Porte]]\" of the [[Ottoman Empire]], and \"the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]]\" of [[Russia]].\n\n[[Sonnet]]s and other forms of love poetry frequently use synecdoches to characterize the beloved in terms of individual body parts rather than a coherent whole. This practice is especially common in the [[Petrarchan sonnet]], where the idealised beloved is often described part by part, from head to toe.\n\nSynecdoche is also popular in advertising. Since synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole, its use requires the audience to make associations and \"fill in the gaps\", engaging with the ad by thinking about the product.<ref name=\"Chandler\" >{{cite book |last=Chandler |first=Daniel |title=Semiotics: the Basics |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=132\u2013133 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=utd_AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PT126&dq=Barthes%201974%2C%20162%3B&pg=PT126#v=onepage&q=Barthes%201974,%20162;&f=false |isbn=978-1-134-32476-7}}</ref> Moreover, catching the attention of an audience with advertising is often referred to by advertisers as \"getting eyeballs\", another synecdoche.<ref name=\"Bureman\" >{{cite web |title=Synecdoche: The Art of Getting Eyeballs |first=Liz |last=Bureman |url=http://thewritepractice.com/synecdoche/ |work=The Write Practice |accessdate=2 January 2019|date=2013-09-24 }}</ref>\nSynecdoche is very common in spoken English, especially in reference to sports.

He grew up in [[Salem, Oregon]], where his father was a professor at [[Willamette University]]. His education included bachelor's (Willamette University, 1941) and master's ([[Haverford College]], 1942) degrees in sociology, and master's (1948) and Ph.D. (1949) degrees in anthropology from [[Harvard University]]. His academic career in anthropology included professorships at the [[University of Oregon]] (1949-1955), the [[University of Wisconsin]] (1955-1969), and the [[University of Connecticut]] (1969-1999). His primary field of specialization was physical anthropology, including Aleutian-Siberian studies, human biology, population history and human evolution.

{"title_page": "List of Colorado Buffaloes head football coaches", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThe [[Colorado Buffaloes football]] program represents the [[University of Colorado Boulder]] in the [[Pac-12 Conference]] South Division of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]. The team has had 25&nbsp;head coaches since it started playing organized football in 1890. The university adopted the nickname ''Buffaloes'' in 1934 after previously being known as the ''Silver and Gold'', ''Silver Helmets'', ''Yellow Jackets'', ''Hornets'', ''Arapahoes'', ''Big Horns'', ''Grizzlies'' and ''Frontiersmen''.<ref name=\"Nicknames\"/> Colorado played without a head coach during their first four years. The team first joined a conference in 1893 when they became a member of the Colorado Football Association. They joined the Colorado Faculty Athletic Conference in 1909, immediately followed by the [[Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference]] in 1910. Before the 1938 season, Colorado joined the [[Mountain States Conference|Mountain States (Skyline) Conference]]. They joined the Big Seven Conference in 1948, which was renamed the [[Big Eight Conference]] in 1958 when Oklahoma State joined/rejoined the Conference.<ref name=\"Big_7_8\"/> The Buffaloes became a charter member of the Big 12 in 1996 when the Big Eight disbanded.<ref name=\"Big12Hist\"/> The Buffaloes have played in 1,139&nbsp;games during their 120&nbsp;seasons. In those seasons, nine coaches have led Colorado to postseason [[bowl game]]s: [[Bunny Oakes]], [[Dallas Ward]], [[William E. Davis|Bud Davis]], [[Eddie Crowder]], [[Bill Mallory]], [[Bill McCartney]], [[Rick Neuheisel]], [[Gary Barnett]], and [[Dan Hawkins (American football)|Dan Hawkins]]. Nine coaches have won [[athletic conference|conference]] championships with the Buffaloes: [[Fred Folsom]], [[Myron E. Witham|Myron Witham]], [[Bill Saunders|William Saunders]], Oakes, [[James J. Yeager|Jim Yeager]], [[Sonny Grandelius]], Mallory, McCartney, and Barnett.\n\nMcCartney is the all-time leader in games coached, with 153, and total wins, with 93. Folsom had the longest tenure as head coach, remaining in the position for 15&nbsp;seasons. [[Harry Heller]] and [[Willis Kienholz|Willis Keinholtz]] are tied for the highest overall [[winning percentage]]. Each served a single season and won eight of his nine games for a winning percentage of .889. Of coaches who served more than one season, Folsom leads with a .765 winning percentage. [[Jon Embree]] is, in terms of overall winning percentage, the worst coach the Buffaloes have had with a .160 winning percentage. Former Colorado head coach Bill McCartney was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 2013 and is the only CU coach to have won several national coach of the year honors, with all of them coming in 1989. Barnett won conference coach of the year honors in 2001 and 2004.

The team has had 25&nbsp;head coaches since it started playing organized football in 1890. The university adopted the nickname ''Buffaloes'' in 1934 after previously being known as the ''Silver and Gold'', ''Silver Helmets'', ''Yellow Jackets'', ''Hornets'', ''Arapahoes'', ''Big Horns'', ''Grizzlies'' and ''Frontiersmen''.<ref name=\"Nicknames\"/> Colorado played without a head coach during their first four years. The team first joined a conference in 1893 when they became a member of the Colorado Football Association. They joined the Colorado Faculty Athletic Conference in 1909, immediately followed by the [[Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference]] in 1910. Before the 1938 season, Colorado joined the [[Mountain States Conference|Mountain States (Skyline) Conference]]. They joined the Big Seven Conference in 1948, which was renamed the [[Big Eight Conference]] in 1958 when Oklahoma State joined/rejoined the Conference.<ref name=\"Big_7_8\"/> The Buffaloes became a charter member of the Big 12 in 1996 when the Big Eight disbanded.<ref name=\"Big12Hist\"/> The Buffaloes have played in 1,139&nbsp;games during their 120&nbsp;seasons. In those seasons, nine coaches have led Colorado to postseason [[bowl game]]s: [[Bunny Oakes]], [[Dallas Ward]], [[William E. Davis|Bud Davis]], [[Eddie Crowder]], [[Bill Mallory]], [[Bill McCartney]], [[Rick Neuheisel]], [[Gary Barnett]], and [[Dan Hawkins (American football)|Dan Hawkins]]. Nine coaches have won [[athletic conference|conference]] championships with the Buffaloes: [[Fred Folsom]], [[Myron E. Witham|Myron Witham]], [[Bill Saunders|William Saunders]], Oakes, [[James J. Yeager|Jim Yeager]], [[Sonny Grandelius]], Mallory, McCartney, and Barnett.\n\nMcCartney is the all-time leader in games coached, with 153, and total wins, with 93. Folsom had the longest tenure as head coach, remaining in the position for 15&nbsp;seasons. [[Harry Heller]] and [[Willis Kienholz|Willis Keinholtz]] are tied for the highest overall [[winning percentage]]. Each served a single season and won eight of his nine games for a winning percentage of .889. Of coaches who served more than one season, Folsom leads with a .765 winning percentage. [[Jon Embree]] is, in terms of overall winning percentage, the worst coach the Buffaloes have had with a .160 winning percentage. Former Colorado head coach Bill McCartney was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 2013 and is the only CU coach to have won several national coach of the year honors, with all of them coming in 1989. Barnett won conference coach of the year honors in 2001 and 2004.

Following the release of his previous album ''[[Ommadawn]]'' (1975), Oldfield moved into a new home in [[Bisley, Gloucestershire]], where he set up a new recording studio. He started on a follow-up in 1977 which took form as a [[double album]] with one, side-long track on each side of the [[LP record]]. Oldfield wished to use real [[incantations]] in the music, but ended up using folklore as a loose running theme, such as [[Diana (mythology)|Dianna the Huntress]]. Though primarily instrumental, lyrical sections are adapted from works by poems [[Longfellow]] and [[Ben Jonson]]. Oldfield completed the self-awareness seminar [[Exegesis (group)|Exegesis]] while recording ''Incantations''.\n\n''Incantations'' peaked at No. 14 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], becoming Oldfield's first album not to reach the UK top-five. It was supported by Oldfield's first concert tour as a solo artist, the [[Tour of Europe 1979]], which featured all four parts of ''Incantations'' performed on stage with a band, orchestra, and choir. The album was reissued in 2000 and 2011; the latter release features a digital remaster with a new stereo mix and additional content, including Oldfield's 1979 disco-influenced non-album single \"[[Guilty (Mike Oldfield song)|Guilty]]\" and footage from his 1979 live album, ''[[Exposed (Mike Oldfield album)|Exposed]]''.\n\n== Background and writing==\nBy the end of 1975 Oldfield had released his third album, ''[[Ommadawn]]'' (1975), which, like his previous two albums, ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' (1973) and ''[[Hergest Ridge (album)|Hergest Ridge]]'' (1974), had reached the top-five of the [[UK Albums Chart]] and helped to solidify Oldfield's popularity as a musician. The three albums were similar in structure, formed of a single composition split into two parts of the [[LP record]].

Since this musical structure requires that each idea be [[Modulation (music)|modulated]] through twelve keys, before the next is introduced, more time is required to develop each idea, so that each section unfolds more slowly than is usual in Oldfield's work. A byproduct of this musical structure is that most of the album is not in any one key, but cycles continuously through them all.\n\nThe lyrics in \"Part One\" simply repeat the names of the goddesses [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], and [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]].\n\nThe lyrics in \"Part Two\" are taken from the beginnings of chapter XXII and XII (in that order) of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]]'s epic poem \"[[The Song of Hiawatha]]\".\n\nThe lyrics in \"Part Four\" are [[Ben Jonson]]'s \"Ode to Cynthia\" from ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]'', but adjusted again to match the music.\n\nWhen the CD version was released, due to the shorter length of the format at the time (early [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|redbook]] standards only allowed for a maximum playing time of 74:33), many early pressings unnecessarily have \"Part Three\" shortened from 16:59 down to 13:49 by cutting from the beginning. When 80-minute CDs became the norm and quality control was increased, the full cut of \"Part Three\" was restored. All modern pressings have the full version of the piece.\n\n== Artwork ==\nThe cover was once again done by [[Trevor Key]]. The beach in the cover photograph is [[Cala Pregonda]], in [[Menorca]]. The current CD sleeve has a different [[typeface]] than the original LP artwork (which is shown at the top of the page). Early copies of the album came with a poster showing a subtly different photograph from the one used on the cover.\n\nThe cover photograph used may have been [[Photo manipulation|altered]] by Key. There have been some theories about why this may have been done, although the claim that Oldfield was not actually on the beach is easily contradicted by other photographs from the shoot. It is assumed that Key simply cut and pasted the image of Oldfield onto a slightly different background for artistic reasons.\n\nThe 2011 reissue of the album was given new artwork, showing a new photograph of the same rock formation and no image of Oldfield.\n\n== Release and reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r129941|first=Steven|last=McDonald|title=''Incantations'' review}}</ref>\n}}\n''Incantations'' was released in the UK on 1 December 1978 and received a strong opening commercial response.

Following the release of his previous album ''[[Ommadawn]]'' (1975), Oldfield moved into a new home in [[Bisley, Gloucestershire]], where he set up a new recording studio. He started on a follow-up in 1977 which took form as a [[double album]] with one, side-long track on each side of the [[LP record]]. Oldfield wished to use real [[incantations]] in the music, but ended up using folklore as a loose running theme, such as [[Diana (mythology)|Dianna the Huntress]]. Though primarily instrumental, lyrical sections are adapted from works by poems [[Longfellow]] and [[Ben Jonson]]. Oldfield completed the self-awareness seminar [[Exegesis]] while recording ''Incantations''.\n\n''Incantations'' peaked at No. 14 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], becoming Oldfield's first album not to reach the UK top-five. It was supported by Oldfield's first concert tour as a solo artist, the [[Tour of Europe 1979]], which featured all four parts of ''Incantations'' performed on stage with a band, orchestra, and choir. The album was reissued in 2000 and 2011; the latter release features a digital remaster with a new stereo mix and additional content, including Oldfield's 1979 disco-influenced non-album single \"[[Guilty (Mike Oldfield song)|Guilty]]\" and footage from his 1979 live album, ''[[Exposed (Mike Oldfield album)|Exposed]]''.\n\n== Background and writing==\nBy the end of 1975 Oldfield had released his third album, ''[[Ommadawn]]'' (1975), which, like his previous two albums, ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' (1973) and ''[[Hergest Ridge (album)|Hergest Ridge]]'' (1974), had reached the top-five of the [[UK Albums Chart]] and helped to solidify Oldfield's popularity as a musician. The three albums were similar in structure, formed of a single composition split into two parts of the [[LP record]]. The release of ''Ommadawn'' marked the end of Oldfield's time at his home in [[Kington, Herefordshire]], from which he moved to Througham Slad Manor near [[Bisley, Gloucestershire]] and set up a recording studio there.<ref name=MM75>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/1975_10/Beyond-the-Ridge-Portrait-of-a-Genius|title=Beyond the Ridge: Portrait of a Genius|work=Melody Maker|first=Karl|last=Dallas |date=25 October 1975|accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen work on ''Incantations'' began, Oldfield recalled that his initial goal was a record that contained \"real [[incantation]]s to exert a benign magical influence on anybody who heard it\".<ref name=DIS11>{{cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4143187-if-people-go-one-way-i-instinctively-go-the-other-dis-meets-mike-oldfield|title=\"If people go one way I instinctively go the other\" - DiS meets Mike Oldfield|first=Andrew|last=Kennedy|date=2 August 2011|publisher=Drowned in Sound|accessdate=3 March 2019}}</ref> He intended to base the music around real spells and chants, and asked the A&R department of his label, [[Virgin Records]], to invite the head [[Druidry (modern)|Druid]] to his home and discuss it further.

A byproduct of this musical structure is that most of the album is not in any one key, but cycles continuously through them all.\n\nThe lyrics in \"Part One\" simply repeat the names of the goddesses [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], and [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]].\n\nThe lyrics in \"Part Two\" are taken from the beginnings of chapter XXII and XII (in that order) of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]]'s epic poem \"[[The Song of Hiawatha]]\".\n\nThe lyrics in \"Part Four\" are [[Ben Jonson]]'s \"Ode to Cynthia\" from ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]'', but adjusted again to match the music.\n\nWhen the CD version was released, due to the shorter length of the format at the time (early [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|redbook]] standards only allowed for a maximum playing time of 74:33), many early pressings unnecessarily have \"Part Three\" shortened from 16:59 down to 13:49 by cutting from the beginning. When 80-minute CDs became the norm and quality control was increased, the full cut of \"Part Three\" was restored. All modern pressings have the full version of the piece.\n\n== Artwork ==\nThe cover was once again done by [[Trevor Key]]. The beach in the cover photograph is [[Cala Pregonda]], in [[Menorca]]. The current CD sleeve has a different [[typeface]] than the original LP artwork (which is shown at the top of the page). Early copies of the album came with a poster showing a subtly different photograph from the one used on the cover.\n\nThe cover photograph used may have been [[Photo manipulation|altered]] by Key. There have been some theories about why this may have been done, although the claim that Oldfield was not actually on the beach is easily contradicted by other photographs from the shoot. It is assumed that Key simply cut and pasted the image of Oldfield onto a slightly different background for artistic reasons.\n\nThe 2011 reissue of the album was given new artwork, showing a new photograph of the same rock formation and no image of Oldfield.\n\n== Release and reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r129941|first=Steven|last=McDonald|title=''Incantations'' review}}</ref>\n}}\n''Incantations'' was released in the UK on 1 December 1978 and received a strong opening commercial response.

As he watched them move toward the horizon, he noticed them shifting and changing shapes, where they looked like strange [[spacecraft]] (referred to in the German lyrics as a \"[[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]\").

Finding nothing but balloons, the pilots put on a large show of fire power. The display of force worries the nations along the borders and the [[war minister]]s on each side bang the drums of conflict to grab power for themselves. In the end, a cataclysmic war results from the otherwise harmless flight of balloons and causes devastation on all sides without a victor, as indicated in the denouement of the song: ''\"99 Jahre Krieg lie\u00dfen keinen Platz f\u00fcr Sieger,\"'' which translates as, \"99 years of war have left no place for winners.\" The anti-war song finishes with the singer walking through the devastated ruins of the world and finding a balloon. The description of what happens in the final line of the piece is the same in German and English: ''\"Denk' an dich und lass' ihn fliegen,\"'' or \"I think of you and let it go.\"<ref name=\"Compare\">{{cite web|title= 99 Luftballons, Side by Side Comparison |website= In the 80s |accessdate= 29 October 2014|url= http://www.inthe80s.com/redger3.shtml}}</ref>\n\n==English version and other re-recordings==\nThe English version retains the spirit of the original narrative, but many of the lyrics are translated poetically rather than being directly translated: red helium balloons are casually released by the civilian singer (narrator) with her unnamed friend into the sky and are mistakenly registered by a faulty [[early warning system]] as enemy contacts, resulting in panic and eventually nuclear war, with the end of the song near-identical to the end of the original German version.<ref name=\"Compare\"/>\n\nFrom the outset Nena and other members of the band expressed disapproval of the English version of the song, \"99 Red Balloons\".

band [[Nena (band)|Nena]] from their 1983 [[Nena (album)|self-titled album]]. An English-language version titled \"'''99 Red Balloons'''\", with lyrics by [[Kevin McAlea]], was also released on the album ''[[99 Luftballons (album)|99 Luftballons]]'' in 1984 after widespread success of the original in Europe and Japan. The English version is not a [[direct translation]] of the German original and contains lyrics with a somewhat different meaning.<ref>{{cite web|title= 99 Red Balloons \u2013 interview with the writer, Kevin McAlea |publisher= Eighty-eightynine |url= http://www.eightyeightynine.com/music/99luftballoons-english.html |accessdate= 17 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Lyrics==\n{{Quote frame|I got really fat goose bumps and said, \"Oh Carlo, that's the best you have ever written.\"<ref>{{cite web|title= 28.

As he watched them move toward the horizon, he noticed them shifting and changing shapes, where they looked like strange [[spacecraft]] (referred to in the German lyrics as a \"[[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]\"). He thought about what might happen if they floated over the [[Berlin Wall]] to the [[East Berlin|Soviet sector]].<ref>''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 15 March 1984</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nAlso cited by the band was a newspaper article from the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' about five local high school students in 1973 who played a prank to simulate a UFO by launching 99 (one was lost from the original 100) aluminized Mylar balloons attached with ribbons to a traffic flare.  The red flame from the flare reflected by the balloons gave the appearance of a large pulsating red object floating over [[Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area|Red Rock Canyon]] outside the [[Las Vegas Valley]] in Nevada.<ref>{{cite news|title= Strange flying object sighted over Red Rock |date= 9 September 1973 |newspaper= [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]}}</ref>\n\nA direct translation of the title is sometimes given as \"Ninety-Nine Air Balloons\", but the song became known in English as \"Ninety-Nine Red Balloons\".<ref>{{cite web|title= The New English-German Dictionary: \"Luftballon\" |accessdate= 2 June 2007 |url= http://www.iee.et.tu-dresden.de/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/wernerr/search.sh?string=luftballon&nocase=on&hits=50 |quote= ''balloon -- der Luftballon''}} {{dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= The New English-German Dictionary: \"Balloon\" |accessdate= 2 June 2007 |url= http://www.iee.et.tu-dresden.de/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/wernerr/search.sh?string=balloon&nocase=on&hits=50 |quote= ''balloon -- der Ballon, balloon -- der Luftballon''}} {{dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The title \"99 Red Balloons\" almost [[scansion|scans]] correctly with the syllables falling in the right places within the rhythm of the first line of lyrics, although ''Neunundneunzig'' (99) has one syllable more than \"ninety-nine\".\n\nThe lyrics of the original German version tell a story: 99 balloons are set free and are mistaken for UFOs, causing a [[General officer|general]] to send pilots to investigate. Finding nothing but balloons, the pilots put on a large show of fire power. The display of force worries the nations along the borders and the [[war minister]]s on each side bang the drums of conflict to grab power for themselves. In the end, a cataclysmic war results from the otherwise harmless flight of balloons and causes devastation on all sides without a victor, as indicated in the denouement of the song: ''\"99 Jahre Krieg lie\u00dfen keinen Platz f\u00fcr Sieger,\"'' which translates as, \"99 years of war have left no place for winners.\" The anti-war song finishes with the singer walking through the devastated ruins of the world and finding a balloon. The description of what happens in the final line of the piece is the same in German and English: ''\"Denk' an dich und lass' ihn fliegen,\"'' or \"I think of you and let it go.\"<ref name=\"Compare\">{{cite web|title= 99 Luftballons, Side by Side Comparison |website= In the 80s |accessdate= 29 October 2014|url= http://www.inthe80s.com/redger3.shtml}}</ref>\n\n==English version and other re-recordings==\nThe English version retains the spirit of the original narrative, but many of the lyrics are translated poetically rather than being directly translated: red helium balloons are casually released by the civilian singer (narrator) with her unnamed friend into the sky and are mistakenly registered by a faulty [[early warning system]] as enemy contacts, resulting in panic and eventually nuclear war, with the end of the song near-identical to the end of the original German version.<ref name=\"Compare\"/>\n\nFrom the outset Nena and other members of the band expressed disapproval of the English version of the song, \"99 Red Balloons\".

They had a different style of headlight and interior lighting to subsequent builds.\n\nThere were:\n:8 Power Cars - DCF 8001\u20138008 - Economy Class\n:4 Driving Trailer Cars - DDC 9001\u20139004 - 1st Class upper deck, Economy Class other seats\n:4 Trailer Cars - DTF 9011-9012 - Economy Class; DTC 9021\u20139022 - 1st Class upper deck, Economy Class other seats\n\nThe configuration of these cars was unsuccessful. The cars were fitted with [[Associated Electrical Industries|AEI]] equipment, and the electrical equipment was split between the power and trailer car. The cables were not able to provide the power needed to operate the train as proposed. This resulted in many failures of the train to operate and also failures in the air-conditioning system.\n\nOne class travel was introduced in September 1974, so the seating was all economy class. This led to the refurbishment of the DDIU sets with the original luggage racks above the seating in the single deck section being removed. During this time the sets were targeted as U sets, the plates used on the [[New South Wales U set|single deck interurbans]].\n\nIn the early 1980s it was decided to convert these to trailer cars hence 16 power cars were ordered with no matching trailers. Between March and December 1982 the cars were rewired at [[Electric Carriage Workshops]], and the driver compartments removed and replaced by passenger toilets and luggage space. The reinforced plastic ends remained, albeit with the blue removed.<ref name=DigestJan85/>\n\nThe cars were subsequently renumbered:\n:DCF 8001\u20138008 > DMT 9201\u20139207 (7 cars remained after writing off DCF 8004)\n:DDC 9001\u20139004 > DDT 9208\u20139211\n:DTF 9011\u20139012 & DTC 9021\u20139022 > DFT 9212\u20139215\n\nIn 2002 these sets were withdrawn and scrapped following the discovery of rust in the steel frames.\n\n=== Second batch (DCM & DCT) ===\nFrom October 1977 the second batch began to enter service, with many differences from the first batch. The electrical equipment was all mounted on the power car, using [[Mitsubishi Electric]] equipment; they had stainless steel [[underframe]]s; were fitted with vacuum retention toilets, and had gold as opposed to green tinted windows. These cars were the first of the ''V sets'', with the V showing that they were installed with vacuum retention toilets.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} They operated separately from the 1970 cars, as the two types were not compatible with each other.<ref name=DigestJan85/>\n\nThe cars built were:\n\n:Power Cars - DCM 8021\u20138036\n:Driving Trailer Cars - DCT 9031\u20139044\n\nThe driving trailers were not used that much, due to driver complaints about an uncomfortable \"kick\" when the power car started to push the trailer. The controls in the DCTs were gradually stripped and used to replace defective controls in the DCMs. In 1990 DCT 9034 was refurbished by [[CityRail]] as a lounge car with lounge chairs and a kitchen for use as a charter car named ''Contura''.<ref>\"CityRail launches lounge car\" ''Railway Digest'' December 1990 page 424</ref> It wasn't a success, not helped by poor marketing, and it was rebuilt as a conventional trailer (without controls) in 2000 and renumbered DET 9216. During the ''Citydecker'' refurbishment carried out by [[UGL Rail|A Goninan & Co]] in the 1990s, DCT 9031-9036 had their driver controls reinstated and were recoded as DTDs allowing [[CityRail]] to introduce ''The River'' a two-car service from [[Wyong railway station|Wyong]] to [[St Marys railway station, Sydney|St Marys]]. At the same time the DCMs were refurbished, receiving destination indicators and ditchlights. The refurbishment also saw the installation of air-conditioning in the driver's cabs of the DCMs, their lack of air-conditioning had a union ban preventing them being used as leading cars since 1995.<ref>\"A Review of Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) Rolling Stock\" ''Railway Digest'' March 1995 page 36</ref> DCM 8032\u20138036 were modified to have wheelchair seating, and recoded as DTMs. The DCMs that had destination indicators eventually had them removed and replaced with a metal blanking plate, after a decision not to use them on Interurban services.

They had a different style of headlight and interior lighting to subsequent builds.\n\nThere were:\n:8 Power Cars - DCF 8001\u20138008 - Economy Class\n:4 Driving Trailer Cars - DDC 9001\u20139004 - 1st Class upper deck, Economy Class other seats\n:4 Trailer Cars - DTF 9011-9012 - Economy Class; DTC 9021\u20139022 - 1st Class upper deck, Economy Class other seats\n\nThe configuration of these cars was unsuccessful. The cars were fitted with [[Associated Electrical Industries|AEI]] equipment, and the electrical equipment was split between the power and trailer car. The cables were not able to provide the power needed to operate the train as proposed. This resulted in many failures of the train to operate and also failures in the air-conditioning system.\n\nOne class travel was introduced in September 1974, so the seating was all economy class. This led to the refurbishment of the DDIU sets with the original luggage racks above the seating in the single deck section being removed. During this time the sets were targeted as U sets, the plates used on the [[New South Wales U set|single deck interurbans]].\n\nIn the early 1980s it was decided to convert these to trailer cars hence 16 power cars were ordered with no matching trailers. Between March and December 1982 the cars were rewired at [[Electric Carriage Workshops]], and the driver compartments removed and replaced by passenger toilets and luggage space. The reinforced plastic ends remained, albeit with the blue removed.<ref name=DigestJan85/>\n\nThe cars were subsequently renumbered:\n:DCF 8001\u20138008 > DMT 9201\u20139207 (7 cars remained after writing off DCF 8004)\n:DDC 9001\u20139004 > DDT 9208\u20139211\n:DTF 9011\u20139012 & DTC 9021\u20139022 > DFT 9212\u20139215\n\nIn 2002 these sets were withdrawn and scrapped following the discovery of rust in the steel frames.\n\n=== Second batch (DCM & DCT) ===\nFrom October 1977 the second batch began to enter service, with many differences from the first batch. The electrical equipment was all mounted on the power car, using [[Mitsubishi Electric]] equipment; they had stainless steel [[underframe]]s; were fitted with vacuum retention toilets, and had gold as opposed to green tinted windows. These cars were the first of the ''V sets'', with the V showing that they were installed with vacuum retention toilets.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} They operated separately from the 1970 cars, as the two types were not compatible with each other.<ref name=DigestJan85/>\n\nThe cars built were:\n\n:Power Cars - DCM 8021\u20138036\n:Driving Trailer Cars - DCT 9031\u20139044\n\nThe driving trailers were not used that much, due to driver complaints about an uncomfortable \"kick\" when the power car started to push the trailer. The controls in the DCTs were gradually stripped and used to replace defective controls in the DCMs. In 1990 DCT 9034 was refurbished by [[CityRail]] as a lounge car with lounge chairs and a kitchen for use as a charter car named ''Contura''.<ref>\"CityRail launches lounge car\" ''Railway Digest'' December 1990 page 424</ref> It wasn't a success, not helped by poor marketing, and it was rebuilt as a conventional trailer (without controls) in 2000 and renumbered DET 9216. During the ''Citydecker'' refurbishment carried out by [[UGL Rail|A Goninan & Co]] in the 1990s, DCT 9031-9036 had their driver controls reinstated and were recoded as DTDs allowing [[CityRail]] to introduce ''The River'' a two-car service from [[Wyong railway station|Wyong]] to [[St Marys railway station, Sydney|St Marys]]. At the same time the DCMs were refurbished, receiving destination indicators and ditchlights. The refurbishment also saw the installation of air-conditioning in the driver's cabs of the DCMs, their lack of air-conditioning had a union ban preventing them being used as leading cars since 1995.<ref>\"A Review of Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) Rolling Stock\" ''Railway Digest'' March 1995 page 36</ref> DCM 8032\u20138036 were modified to have wheelchair seating, and recoded as DTMs. The DCMs that had destination indicators eventually had them removed and replaced with a metal blanking plate, after a decision not to use them on Interurban services. Some were withdrawn in 2011.\n[[File:V38Katoomba.jpg|thumb|V set DIM at [[Katoomba railway station|Katoomba]] with the [[State Rail Authority]] glass reinforced plastic end introduced in June 1984]]\n\n=== Third batch (DIM & DIT) ===\nFrom May 1981 DIM Power Cars and DIT trailers started to be delivered.

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Barack Obama was the first [[African-American]] president of the United States. He previously served as a [[U.S. senator]] from [[Illinois]] from 2005 to 2008 and an [[Illinois state senator]] from 1997 to 2004.<!--  PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE FROM \"AFRICAN AMERICAN\", per consensus. See discussions and FAQ (Q2) on the talk page. -->\n\nObama was born in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. After graduating from [[Columbia University]] in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in [[Chicago]]. In 1988, he enrolled in [[Harvard Law School]], where he was the first black person to head the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the [[University of Chicago Law School]] from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he [[Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama|represented the 13th district]] from 1997 until 2004 in the [[Illinois Senate]], when he [[United States Senate election in Illinois, 2004|ran for the U.S. Senate]]. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate-primary win, his well-received July [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] [[2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address|keynote address]], and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, he was nominated for president a year after [[Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign|his presidential campaign]] began, and after [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|close primary campaigns]] against [[Hillary Clinton]]. Obama was [[2008 United States presidential election|elected]] over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[John McCain]] and was [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inaugurated]] alongside [[Joe Biden]] on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the [[2009 Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate.\n\nObama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. The main reforms that were passed include the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (commonly referred to as the \"Affordable Care Act\" or \"Obamacare\"), the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], and the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]]. The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] and [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]] served as economic stimulus amidst the [[Great Recession]]. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the [[Budget Control Act of 2011|Budget Control]] and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012|American Taxpayer Relief Acts]]. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]], reduced nuclear weapons with the United States\u2013Russia [[New START]] treaty, and [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)|ended military involvement]] in the [[Iraq War]]. He ordered [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military involvement in Libya]], contributing to the overthrow of [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. He also ordered the military operations that resulted in [[death of Osama bin Laden|the deaths of Osama bin Laden]] and suspected Yemeni [[Al-Qaeda]] operative [[Anwar al-Awlaki]].\n\nAfter winning [[2012 United States presidential election|re-election]] by defeating Republican opponent [[Mitt Romney]], Obama was [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|sworn in for a second term]] in 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for [[LGBT American]]s. His administration filed briefs that urged the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] to strike down [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] bans as unconstitutional (''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' and ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''); same-sex marriage was [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|legalized]] nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled so in ''Obergefell''. He advocated for [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]] in response to the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], indicating support for a ban on [[assault weapons]], and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning [[global warming]] and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014\u2013present)|military intervention in Iraq]] in response to gains made by [[ISIL]] after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of [[ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan]] in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 [[Paris Agreement]] on global climate change, initiated [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|sanctions against Russia]] following the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014\u2013present)|invasion in Ukraine]] and again after [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]], brokered a [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|nuclear deal with Iran]], and [[United States\u2013Cuban Thaw|normalized U.S. relations with Cuba]]. Obama nominated [[Barack Obama Supreme Court candidates|three justices to the Supreme Court]]: [[Sonia Sotomayor]] and [[Elena Kagan]] were confirmed as justices, while [[Merrick Garland]] faced partisan [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|obstruction]] and was not confirmed.

He previously served as a [[U.S. senator]] from [[Illinois]] from 2005 to 2008 and an [[Illinois state senator]] from 1997 to 2004.<!--  PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE FROM \"AFRICAN AMERICAN\", per consensus. See discussions and FAQ (Q2) on the talk page. -->\n\nObama was born in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. After graduating from [[Columbia University]] in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in [[Chicago]]. In 1988, he enrolled in [[Harvard Law School]], where he was the first black person to head the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the [[University of Chicago Law School]] from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he [[Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama|represented the 13th district]] from 1997 until 2004 in the [[Illinois Senate]], when he [[United States Senate election in Illinois, 2004|ran for the U.S. Senate]]. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate-primary win, his well-received July [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] [[2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address|keynote address]], and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, he was nominated for president a year after [[Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign|his presidential campaign]] began, and after [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|close primary campaigns]] against [[Hillary Clinton]]. Obama was [[2008 United States presidential election|elected]] over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[John McCain]] and was [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inaugurated]] alongside [[Joe Biden]] on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the [[2009 Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate.\n\nObama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. The main reforms that were passed include the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (commonly referred to as the \"Affordable Care Act\" or \"Obamacare\"), the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], and the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]]. The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] and [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]] served as economic stimulus amidst the [[Great Recession]]. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the [[Budget Control Act of 2011|Budget Control]] and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012|American Taxpayer Relief Acts]]. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]], reduced nuclear weapons with the United States\u2013Russia [[New START]] treaty, and [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)|ended military involvement]] in the [[Iraq War]]. He ordered [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military involvement in Libya]], contributing to the overthrow of [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. He also ordered the military operations that resulted in [[death of Osama bin Laden|the deaths of Osama bin Laden]] and suspected Yemeni [[Al-Qaeda]] operative [[Anwar al-Awlaki]].\n\nAfter winning [[2012 United States presidential election|re-election]] by defeating Republican opponent [[Mitt Romney]], Obama was [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|sworn in for a second term]] in 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for [[LGBT American]]s. His administration filed briefs that urged the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] to strike down [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] bans as unconstitutional (''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' and ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''); same-sex marriage was [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|legalized]] nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled so in ''Obergefell''. He advocated for [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]] in response to the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], indicating support for a ban on [[assault weapons]], and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning [[global warming]] and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014\u2013present)|military intervention in Iraq]] in response to gains made by [[ISIL]] after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of [[ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan]] in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 [[Paris Agreement]] on global climate change, initiated [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|sanctions against Russia]] following the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014\u2013present)|invasion in Ukraine]] and again after [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]], brokered a [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|nuclear deal with Iran]], and [[United States\u2013Cuban Thaw|normalized U.S. relations with Cuba]]. Obama nominated [[Barack Obama Supreme Court candidates|three justices to the Supreme Court]]: [[Sonia Sotomayor]] and [[Elena Kagan]] were confirmed as justices, while [[Merrick Garland]] faced partisan [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|obstruction]] and was not confirmed.

Born in Angola, Marques moved to Portugal as a child.\n\n== Club career ==\n\n=== Early career ===\nAfter coming through the youth ranks at Portuguese club [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], Marques left to join Swiss side [[FC Baden]]. Following his spell at Baden, he began his professional career at Germany's [[SSV Ulm 1846]] in the 1999\u20132000 season. He subsequently moved to [[Hertha BSC]], but did not appear in a single match for the first team in the [[Bundesliga]].\n\nAfter only six months with Hertha, Marques moved to fellow Bundesliga club [[VfB Stuttgart]], spending there three-and-a-half seasons there and winning the [[2002 UEFA Intertoto Cup]] after beating French side [[Lille OSC|Lille]]. In the 2004\u201305 season, he moved back to Portugal to join [[Primeira Liga]] side [[C.S. Mar\u00edtimo|Mar\u00edtimo]] in [[Madeira]]. However, after struggling to break into the first team, Marques was released after just one season. As a free agent, he then began to look for clubs abroad.\n\n=== Leeds United ===\nPrior to the 2005\u201306 season, Marques went on trial to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], where he impressed then manager [[Joe Royle]] enough to want to sign him permanently. However, Marques instead chose to move to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on a [[Bosman transfer|free transfer]].<ref>{{cite news | date=29 July 2007 | url=http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=295303&plid=5163&clid=2&cpid=10 | title=Leeds land Marques | publisher=[[Sky Sports]] | accessdate=22 June 2007 | author=James Pearson }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He was signed by manager [[Kevin Blackwell]], but Marques made only one appearance for Leeds in the 2005\u201306 season in the [[2005\u201306 Football League Cup|League Cup]] against [[Oldham Athletic F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], in which he was clearly very nervous and uncomfortable playing out of position at right-back. Marques did not feature again for Leeds that season, with [[Paul Butler (footballer, born 1972)|Paul Butler]], [[Sean Gregan]], [[Matthew Kilgallon]], [[Clarke Carlisle]] and [[Michael Duberry]] all ahead of him in the pecking order. Towards the end of the 2005\u201306 season, he joined [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on a short-term loan,<ref>{{cite news | date=23 March 2007 | url=http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=373786&plid=5163&clid=88&cpid=10 | title=Tigers land Leeds stopper | publisher=[[Sky Sports]] | accessdate=22 June 2007 | author=James Pearson }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> though his loan was cut short due to injury. He then returned to Leeds. He represented Angola in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], and was one of two Leeds players to take part in that tournament, [[Eddie Lewis (American soccer)|Eddie Lewis]] being the other, for the [[United States national men's soccer team|United States]].\n\nThe 2006\u201307 campaign again saw Marques overlooked by manager [[Kevin Blackwell]], and initially again by the new Leeds manager [[Dennis Wise]], who said Marques would not feature under his leadership and was told he was free to leave the club, along with a number of other squad and fringe players.<ref>{{cite news | date=23 November 2007 | url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/ViewArticle.aspx?SectionID=46&ArticleID=1893312 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20080430150016/http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/ViewArticle.aspx?SectionID=46&ArticleID=1893312 | url-status=dead | archive-date=30 April 2008 | title=Wise considers transfer option | publisher=Yorkshire Evening Post | accessdate=22 June 2007 | author=Phil Hay }}</ref>\n\nMarques was eventually called up to the first team squad for Leeds' 2\u20131 victory against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] on 1 January 2007, where he turned in a solid performance at centre-back. This performance saw Marques being rewarded with a long run in the starting lineup at [[Elland Road]]. With questions mounting about whether his contract would be extended, Marques stated he would prefer to concentrate on Leeds' relegation battle than signing a new deal. He was an instant hit with the fans.<ref>{{cite news | date=17 April 2007 | url=http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=461447&plid=5163&clid=2&cpid=10 | title=Marques putting Leeds first | publisher=Sky Sports | accessdate=22 June 2007 | author=James Pearson }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Despite some impressive performances, Marques' efforts were not enough to save Leeds from relegation to [[EFL League One|League One]] for the first time in club history. Nonetheless, Marques showed his commitment to the club and signed a new contract on 7 August 2007.\n\nMarques was a regular starter in the first team and scored his first goal for Leeds on 18 August 2007 in the 4\u20131 drubbing of [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] in the dying minutes of the match. Marques missed several matches in January 2008, joining the [[Angola national football team|Angola national team]] for the [[2008 African Cup of Nations]].\n\nOn his return, Marques established himself as fourth-choice captain at Leeds,<ref>{{cite news | date=22 February 2008 | url=http://www.leedsunited.com/page/NewsroomDetail/0,,10273~1246741,00.html | title=Captain Rui | publisher=Leeds United | accessdate=11 May 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410001044/http://www.leedsunited.com/page/NewsroomDetail/0,,10273~1246741,00.html | archivedate=10 April 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> taking up the armband for most of March 2008 while [[Alan Thompson (footballer, born 1973)|Alan Thompson]], [[Jonathan Douglas]] and [[Andrew Hughes (footballer, born 1978)|Andy Hughes]] were out injured. Marques incurred an injury and was replaced by [[Paul Huntington]] in Leeds' starting line-up. Due to Huntington's fantastic form, Marques was kept out of the side for the rest of the season, only being limited to occasional substitute appearances.\n\nBefore he left the club, manager [[Dennis Wise]] stated he would offer Marques a new contract; Wise even said Marques should wait longer before signing the deal to help get a wage increase. Upon his arrival, new manager [[Gary McAllister]] offered Marques a new contract, however talks stalled, with the length of the contract appearing to be the deciding factor in Marques' decision. Talks were delayed until the summer and Leeds reached the League One playoff final, but lost 1\u20130 against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]].<ref>{{cite news | date=10 April 2008 | url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/Contract-length-the-key-in.3967302.jp | title=Contract length the key in Rui Marques talks | publisher=Yorkshire Evening Post| accessdate=11 May 2008}}</ref> During the summer, Marques was linked to a move to the [[Premier League]], with him interesting [[Roy Keane]]'s [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. However, on 20 May 2008, he signed a new contract with Leeds, contracting him to the club for a further two seasons.\n\nAt the start of the [[2008\u201309 Leeds United F.C. season|2008\u201309 season]], Marques, who is fluent in Spanish, acted as a translator for new Argentine signing [[Luciano Becchio]]. After a poor start to the 2008\u201309 season, with Leeds' defence leaking a lot of goals, McAllister was sacked and was replaced by [[Simon Grayson]]. Marques scored in Leeds' 2\u20130 win against [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] on 28 January 2009. Marques played regularly under Grayson and began partnering new signing [[Richard Naylor]], but when [[Sam Sodje]] was signed on loan from [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], Marques lost his place when he suffered an hamstring injury. Leeds reached the playoff semi-finals but lost to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].\n\nWith Sam Sodje's loan spell over and captain [[Richard Naylor]] injured, Marques found himself as first choice central defence partnership with [[Patrick Kisnorbo]] at the start of the [[2009\u201310 Leeds United F.C. season|2009\u201310 season]]. However, Marques lost his starting place when he suffered an Achilles injury while on international duty in September, and dropped down the pecking order when he was out injured when Leeds completed the signing of [[Leigh Bromby]]. Marques' injury kept him out for a prolonged period lasting over several matches. After featuring in some reserve matches and closed-door friendlies, Marques returned from injury and was named to the substitutes' bench against [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]]. After his spell out injured, he was behind [[Patrick Kisnorbo]], Richard Naylor, [[Leigh Bromby]] and [[\u013dubom\u00edr Michal\u00edk]] in the pecking order for Leeds. Marques was named on the bench against Oldham Athletic and kept his place on the bench against [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]]. When Naylor and Kisnorbo both became fit, they returned to the starting lineup, with Michal\u00edk dropping to the substitutes' bench at Marques' expense.\n\nMarques was unavailable for selection for Leeds during most of January 2010, as he was called up to host nation Angola's [[2010 African Cup of Nations]] squad. The most high-profile games he was unavailable for was Leeds' [[2009\u201310 FA Cup]] tie away to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the away FA Cup tie to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. Angola were eliminated from the Cup of Nations on 24 January, so Marques returned to Leeds. Marques incurred a small injury at the tournament, which kept him on the sidelines for a number of Leeds' matches. When he recovered, he never had a chance to play, even when the club was struggling to win a match for the last part of the season.\n\nOn 14 May 2010, it was announced Marques would not be offered a new contract at the club, meaning he was free to find a new club. At the time of his departure, Marques was the longest-serving player at the club.<ref>{{cite news | title = Leeds United trim squad after promotion | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 14 May 2010 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/8682477.stm | accessdate = 15 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n== International career ==\nDespite being eligible for the [[Portugal national football team|Portugal national team]], Marques pledged his allegiance to the country of his birth, Angola. Marques played for Angola in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], where he played against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], [[Iran national football team|Iran]] and Portugal, with Angola finishing third in their group. Marques also played in the [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations]], in which he played in all of Angola's matches.\n\nMarques was called up by Angola for the 2010 African Cup of Nations, where his country Angola were the host nation of the tournament, during this spell he was unavailable to play for Leeds. On 30 December 2009, he played in the 1\u20130 loss to [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]], a friendly match as a warm-up for the Cup of Nations. He then played in the 1\u20131 draw against [[Gambia national football team|Gambia]].\n\nAngola's first match of the African Cup of Nations was against [[Mali national football team|Mali]], a match which Marques started. Angola were 4\u20130 up with 15 minutes to play, but chaotically conceded 4 goals in the last 15 minutes as the match finished 4\u20134, with the likes of [[Seydou Keita]] and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9]] scoring for Mali. Marques then played the entire match in Angola's 2\u20130 win over [[Malawi national football team|Malawi]] and also started in the 0\u20130 draw with [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], a match which enabled Angola to progress to the quarter-finals as winners of their group.\n\nMarques' tournament came to an end when Angola were eliminated in the quarter-finals following a 1\u20130 loss to [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], with [[Asamoah Gyan]] scoring the winner. Marques would return to Leeds from the tournament with an injury.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Soccerbase}}\n* {{NFT player|pid=13162}}\n\n{{Angola squad 2006 FIFA World Cup}}\n{{Angola squad 2008 Africa Cup of Nations}}\n{{Angola squad 2010 Africa Cup of Nations}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marques, Rui}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1977 births]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Luanda]]\n[[Category:Portuguese people of Angolan descent]]\n[[Category:Association football defenders]]\n[[Category:Angolan footballers]]\n[[Category:Angola international footballers]]\n[[Category:2008 Africa Cup of Nations players]]\n[[Category:2010 Africa Cup of Nations players]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in Switzerland]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in Germany]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in England]]\n[[Category:FC Baden players]]\n[[Category:SSV Ulm 1846 players]]\n[[Category:Hertha BSC players]]\n[[Category:VfB Stuttgart players]]\n[[Category:C.S.

Born in Angola, Marques moved to Portugal as a child.\n\n== Club career ==\n\n=== Early career ===\nAfter coming through the youth ranks at Portuguese club [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], Marques left to join Swiss side [[FC Baden]]. Following his spell at Baden, he began his professional career at Germany's [[SSV Ulm 1846]] in the 1999\u20132000 season. He subsequently moved to [[Hertha BSC]], but did not appear in a single match for the first team in the [[Bundesliga]].\n\nAfter only six months with Hertha, Marques moved to fellow Bundesliga club [[VfB Stuttgart]], spending there three-and-a-half seasons there and winning the [[2002 UEFA Intertoto Cup]] after beating French side [[Lille OSC|Lille]]. In the 2004\u201305 season, he moved back to Portugal to join [[Primeira Liga]] side [[C.S. Mar\u00edtimo|Mar\u00edtimo]] in [[Madeira]]. However, after struggling to break into the first team, Marques was released after just one season. As a free agent, he then began to look for clubs abroad.\n\n=== Leeds United ===\nPrior to the 2005\u201306 season, Marques went on trial to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], where he impressed then manager [[Joe Royle]] enough to want to sign him permanently. However, Marques instead chose to move to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on a [[Bosman transfer|free transfer]].<ref>{{cite news | date=29 July 2007 | url=http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=295303&plid=5163&clid=2&cpid=10 | title=Leeds land Marques | publisher=[[Sky Sports]] | accessdate=22 June 2007 | author=James Pearson }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He was signed by manager [[Kevin Blackwell]], but Marques made only one appearance for Leeds in the 2005\u201306 season in the [[2005\u201306 Football League Cup|League Cup]] against [[Oldham Athletic F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], in which he was clearly very nervous and uncomfortable playing out of position at right-back. Marques did not feature again for Leeds that season, with [[Paul Butler (footballer, born 1972)|Paul Butler]], [[Sean Gregan]], [[Matthew Kilgallon]], [[Clarke Carlisle]] and [[Michael Duberry]] all ahead of him in the pecking order. Towards the end of the 2005\u201306 season, he joined [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on a short-term loan,<ref>{{cite news | date=23 March 2007 | url=http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=373786&plid=5163&clid=88&cpid=10 | title=Tigers land Leeds stopper | publisher=[[Sky Sports]] | accessdate=22 June 2007 | author=James Pearson }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> though his loan was cut short due to injury. He then returned to Leeds. He represented Angola in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], and was one of two Leeds players to take part in that tournament, [[Eddie Lewis (American soccer)|Eddie Lewis]] being the other, for the [[United States national men's soccer team|United States]].\n\nThe 2006\u201307 campaign again saw Marques overlooked by manager [[Kevin Blackwell]], and initially again by the new Leeds manager [[Dennis Wise]], who said Marques would not feature under his leadership and was told he was free to leave the club, along with a number of other squad and fringe players.<ref>{{cite news | date=23 November 2007 | url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/ViewArticle.aspx?SectionID=46&ArticleID=1893312 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20080430150016/http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/ViewArticle.aspx?SectionID=46&ArticleID=1893312 | url-status=dead | archive-date=30 April 2008 | title=Wise considers transfer option | publisher=Yorkshire Evening Post | accessdate=22 June 2007 | author=Phil Hay }}</ref>\n\nMarques was eventually called up to the first team squad for Leeds' 2\u20131 victory against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] on 1 January 2007, where he turned in a solid performance at centre-back. This performance saw Marques being rewarded with a long run in the starting lineup at [[Elland Road]]. With questions mounting about whether his contract would be extended, Marques stated he would prefer to concentrate on Leeds' relegation battle than signing a new deal. He was an instant hit with the fans.<ref>{{cite news | date=17 April 2007 | url=http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=461447&plid=5163&clid=2&cpid=10 | title=Marques putting Leeds first | publisher=Sky Sports | accessdate=22 June 2007 | author=James Pearson }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Despite some impressive performances, Marques' efforts were not enough to save Leeds from relegation to [[EFL League One|League One]] for the first time in club history. Nonetheless, Marques showed his commitment to the club and signed a new contract on 7 August 2007.\n\nMarques was a regular starter in the first team and scored his first goal for Leeds on 18 August 2007 in the 4\u20131 drubbing of [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] in the dying minutes of the match. Marques missed several matches in January 2008, joining the [[Angola national football team|Angola national team]] for the [[2008 African Cup of Nations]].\n\nOn his return, Marques established himself as fourth-choice captain at Leeds,<ref>{{cite news | date=22 February 2008 | url=http://www.leedsunited.com/page/NewsroomDetail/0,,10273~1246741,00.html | title=Captain Rui | publisher=Leeds United | accessdate=11 May 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410001044/http://www.leedsunited.com/page/NewsroomDetail/0,,10273~1246741,00.html | archivedate=10 April 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> taking up the armband for most of March 2008 while [[Alan Thompson (footballer, born 1973)|Alan Thompson]], [[Jonathan Douglas]] and [[Andrew Hughes (footballer, born 1978)|Andy Hughes]] were out injured. Marques incurred an injury and was replaced by [[Paul Huntington]] in Leeds' starting line-up. Due to Huntington's fantastic form, Marques was kept out of the side for the rest of the season, only being limited to occasional substitute appearances.\n\nBefore he left the club, manager [[Dennis Wise]] stated he would offer Marques a new contract; Wise even said Marques should wait longer before signing the deal to help get a wage increase. Upon his arrival, new manager [[Gary McAllister]] offered Marques a new contract, however talks stalled, with the length of the contract appearing to be the deciding factor in Marques' decision. Talks were delayed until the summer and Leeds reached the League One playoff final, but lost 1\u20130 against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]].<ref>{{cite news | date=10 April 2008 | url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/Contract-length-the-key-in.3967302.jp | title=Contract length the key in Rui Marques talks | publisher=Yorkshire Evening Post| accessdate=11 May 2008}}</ref> During the summer, Marques was linked to a move to the [[Premier League]], with him interesting [[Roy Keane]]'s [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. However, on 20 May 2008, he signed a new contract with Leeds, contracting him to the club for a further two seasons.\n\nAt the start of the [[2008\u201309 Leeds United F.C. season|2008\u201309 season]], Marques, who is fluent in Spanish, acted as a translator for new Argentine signing [[Luciano Becchio]]. After a poor start to the 2008\u201309 season, with Leeds' defence leaking a lot of goals, McAllister was sacked and was replaced by [[Simon Grayson]]. Marques scored in Leeds' 2\u20130 win against [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] on 28 January 2009. Marques played regularly under Grayson and began partnering new signing [[Richard Naylor]], but when [[Sam Sodje]] was signed on loan from [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], Marques lost his place when he suffered an hamstring injury. Leeds reached the playoff semi-finals but lost to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].\n\nWith Sam Sodje's loan spell over and captain [[Richard Naylor]] injured, Marques found himself as first choice central defence partnership with [[Patrick Kisnorbo]] at the start of the [[2009\u201310 Leeds United F.C. season|2009\u201310 season]]. However, Marques lost his starting place when he suffered an Achilles injury while on international duty in September, and dropped down the pecking order when he was out injured when Leeds completed the signing of [[Leigh Bromby]]. Marques' injury kept him out for a prolonged period lasting over several matches. After featuring in some reserve matches and closed-door friendlies, Marques returned from injury and was named to the substitutes' bench against [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]]. After his spell out injured, he was behind [[Patrick Kisnorbo]], Richard Naylor, [[Leigh Bromby]] and [[\u013dubom\u00edr Michal\u00edk]] in the pecking order for Leeds. Marques was named on the bench against Oldham Athletic and kept his place on the bench against [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]]. When Naylor and Kisnorbo both became fit, they returned to the starting lineup, with Michal\u00edk dropping to the substitutes' bench at Marques' expense.\n\nMarques was unavailable for selection for Leeds during most of January 2010, as he was called up to host nation Angola's [[2010 African Cup of Nations]] squad. The most high-profile games he was unavailable for was Leeds' [[2009\u201310 FA Cup]] tie away to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the away FA Cup tie to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. Angola were eliminated from the Cup of Nations on 24 January, so Marques returned to Leeds. Marques incurred a small injury at the tournament, which kept him on the sidelines for a number of Leeds' matches. When he recovered, he never had a chance to play, even when the club was struggling to win a match for the last part of the season.\n\nOn 14 May 2010, it was announced Marques would not be offered a new contract at the club, meaning he was free to find a new club. At the time of his departure, Marques was the longest-serving player at the club.<ref>{{cite news | title = Leeds United trim squad after promotion | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 14 May 2010 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/8682477.stm | accessdate = 15 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n== International career ==\nDespite being eligible for the [[Portugal national football team|Portugal national team]], Marques pledged his allegiance to the country of his birth, Angola. Marques played for Angola in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], where he played against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], [[Iran national football team|Iran]] and Portugal, with Angola finishing third in their group. Marques also played in the [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations]], in which he played in all of Angola's matches.\n\nMarques was called up by Angola for the 2010 African Cup of Nations, where his country Angola were the host nation of the tournament, during this spell he was unavailable to play for Leeds. On 30 December 2009, he played in the 1\u20130 loss to [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]], a friendly match as a warm-up for the Cup of Nations. He then played in the 1\u20131 draw against [[Gambia national football team|Gambia]].\n\nAngola's first match of the African Cup of Nations was against [[Mali national football team|Mali]], a match which Marques started. Angola were 4\u20130 up with 15 minutes to play, but chaotically conceded 4 goals in the last 15 minutes as the match finished 4\u20134, with the likes of [[Seydou Keita]] and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9]] scoring for Mali. Marques then played the entire match in Angola's 2\u20130 win over [[Malawi national football team|Malawi]] and also started in the 0\u20130 draw with [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], a match which enabled Angola to progress to the quarter-finals as winners of their group.\n\nMarques' tournament came to an end when Angola were eliminated in the quarter-finals following a 1\u20130 loss to [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], with [[Asamoah Gyan]] scoring the winner. Marques would return to Leeds from the tournament with an injury.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Soccerbase}}\n* {{NFT player|pid=13162}}\n\n{{Angola squad 2006 FIFA World Cup}}\n{{Angola squad 2008 Africa Cup of Nations}}\n{{Angola squad 2010 Africa Cup of Nations}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marques, Rui}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1977 births]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Luanda]]\n[[Category:Portuguese people of Angolan descent]]\n[[Category:Association football defenders]]\n[[Category:Angolan footballers]]\n[[Category:Angola international footballers]]\n[[Category:2008 Africa Cup of Nations players]]\n[[Category:2010 Africa Cup of Nations players]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in Switzerland]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in Germany]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in England]]\n[[Category:FC Baden players]]\n[[Category:SSV Ulm 1846 players]]\n[[Category:Hertha BSC players]]\n[[Category:VfB Stuttgart players]]\n[[Category:C.S.
