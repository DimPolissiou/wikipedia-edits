A number of languages express this position either by the name for the day or by the naming of the other days. In Hebrew it is called \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df ''yom rishon'', in Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u062f ''al-ahad'', in Persian and related languages \u06cc\u06a9\u0634\u0646\u0628\u0647 ''yek-shanbe'', all meaning \"first\".\n\nIn [[Greek language|Greek]], the names of the days Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday (\"\u0394\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\", \"\u03a4\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\", \"\u03a4\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7\" and \"\u03a0\u03ad\u03bc\u03c0\u03c4\u03b7\") mean \"second\", \"third\", \"fourth\", and \"fifth\" respectively. This leaves Sunday in the first position of the week count. The current Greek name for Sunday, ''\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae'' (Kyriake), means \"Lord's Day\" coming from the word ''\u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2'' (Kyrios), which is the Greek word for \"Lord\". Similarly in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], where the days from Monday to Friday are counted as \"segunda-feira\", \"ter\u00e7a-feira\", \"quarta-feira\", \"quinta-feira\" and \"sexta-feira\", while Sunday itself similar to Greek has the name of \"Lord's Day\" (\"domingo\"). In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the working days in the week are named as: \"Th\u1ee9 Hai\" (second day), \"Th\u1ee9 Ba\" (third day), \"Th\u1ee9 T\u01b0\" (fourth day), \"Th\u1ee9 N\u0103m\" (fifth day), \"Th\u1ee9 S\u00e1u\" (sixth day), \"Th\u1ee9 B\u1ea3y\" (seventh day). Sunday is called \"Ch\u1ee7 Nh\u1eadt\", a corrupted form of \"Ch\u00faa Nh\u1eadt\" meaning \"Lord's Day\". Some colloquial text in the south of [[Vietnam]] and from the church may still use the old form to mean Sunday.  In [[German language|German]], Wednesday is called \"Mittwoch\", literally \"mid-week\", implying that weeks run from Sunday to Saturday.\n\nThe name is similar in the [[Romance Languages]]. In [[Italian language|Italian]], Sunday is called \"domenica\", which also means \"Lord's Day\" (from Latin \"Dies Dominica\"). One finds similar cognates in [[French language|French]], where the name is \"dimanche\", as well as [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (\"duminic\u0103\") and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (\"domingo\").\n\n[[Slavic languages]] implicitly number Monday as day number one, not two. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! \n!

In Old Russian Sunday was also called ''\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044f'' \"free day\" or \"day with no work\", but in the contemporary language this word means \"week\".\n[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''p\u00e9ntek'' (Friday) is a Slavic [[loanword]], so the correlation with \"five\" is not evident to Hungarians. Hungarians use ''Vas\u00e1rnap'' for Sunday, which means \"market day\". \n\nIn the [[Maltese language]], due to its [[Siculo-Arabic]] origin, Sunday is called \"Il-\u0126add\", a corruption of \"wie\u0127ed\" meaning \"one\". Monday is \"It-Tnejn\" meaning \"two\". Similarly Tuesday is \"It-Tlieta\" (three), Wednesday is \"L-Erbg\u0127a\" (four) and Thursday is \"Il-\u0126amis\" (five).\n\nIn [[Armenian language|Armenian]], Monday is (Yerkoushabti) literally meaning 2nd day of the week, Tuesday (Yerekshabti) 3rd day, Wednesday (Chorekshabti) 4th day, Thursday (Hingshabti) 5th day. Saturday is (Shabat) coming from the word Sabbath or Shabbath in Hebrew, and \"Kiraki\" coming from the word \"Krak\" meaning \"fire\" is Sunday, \"Krak\" describing the sun by fire. Apostle John also refers to the \"Lord's Day\" (in [[Greek language|Greek]], ''\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u1f21\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1'', \"kyriake hemera\" i.e. the day of the Lord) in Rev. 1:10, which is another possible origin of the Armenian word for Sunday.\n\nHowever, in many European countries calendars almost always show Monday as the first day of the week,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/weekinfo.htm#TSW |title=Calendar Weeks |author=J. R. Stockton |accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref> which follows the [[ISO 8601]] standard.\n\nIn the [[Persian calendar]], Sunday is the second day of the week. However, it is called \"number one\" as counting starts from zero; the first day - Saturday - is denoted as 00.\n\n<span id=\"Sunday_and_the_Sabbath\"></span>\n\n==Sunday in Christianity==\n\n===Pagan correspondence===\n\nIn Roman culture, Sunday was the day of the Sun god. In paganism, the Sun was a source of life, giving warmth and illumination to mankind. It was the center of a popular cult among Romans, who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed.{{Dubious| Is this in source given, Chadwick's book? I don't have the book at hand, and I don't think it particularly implausible, but I have never heard of such a Roman custom and wouldn't think it is altogether implausible either to suppose that to the Sabbatarian propagandists roaming about this article invented such a custom.|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe opportunity to spot in the nature-worship of their heathen neighbors a symbolism valid to their own faith was not lost on the Christians. One of the Church fathers, [[St. Jerome]], would declare: \"If pagans call [the Lord's Day] [...] the 'day of the sun,' we willingly agree, for today the light of the world is raised, today is revealed the sun of justice with healing in his rays.\"<ref>St. Jerome, Pasch.: CCL 78, 550, as quoted in: [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|CCC]] 1166.</ref>\n\nA similar consideration may have influenced the choice of the [[Christmas|Christmas date]] on the day of the winter solstice, whose celebration was part of the Roman cult of the Sun.{{Dubious|Again, on 25th December was certainly the Sol Invictus feast and possibly a Mithraic feast, but neither cult is ''Roman cult'' properly speaking. Whether the ancient Romans, who by the way were not Germanics, laid much importance on the winter solstice only a few days before or after their ''Saturnalia'' seems dubious to me. My guess would be that the source means the Sol-invictus-feast, but it would be wrong to describe this as \"Roman cult\".|date=July 2017}}<ref>{{cite book|author=Owen Chadwick|title=A History of Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qugouOh3KjMC&pg=PA22|year=1998|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=22}}</ref> In the same vein, Christian churches have been built and are still being built (as far as possible) with an orientation so that the congregation faced toward the sunrise in the East. Much later, [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] would sing in his famous [[Canticle of the Sun|canticle]]: \"Be praised, my Lord, through all your creatures, especially through my lord Brother Sun, who brings the day; and you give light through him. And he is beautiful and radiant in all his splendor! Of you, Most High, he bears the likeness.\"\n\n===Christian usage===\n{{See also|Sabbath in Christianity}}\n\nThe ancient Romans traditionally used the eight-day [[Nundinae|nundinal cycle]], a market week, but in the time of [[Augustus]] in the 1st century AD, a seven-day week also came into use.\n\n[[Justin Martyr]], in the mid [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]], mentions \"memoirs of the apostles\" as being read on \"the day called that of the sun\" (Sunday) alongside the \"writings of the prophets.\" <ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Citation | first = Justin | last = Martyr | title = [[First Apology]] | at = 67.3}}.</ref>\n\nOn 7 March 321, [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]], Rome's first Christian Emperor (see [[Constantine I and Christianity]]), decreed that Sunday would be observed as the Roman day of rest:<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last = Zerubavel\n| first = Eviatar\n| title = The Seven Day Circle: The History and Meaning of the Week\n| publisher = University of Chicago Press\n| date = 1989\n| page = 45\n| isbn = 9780226981659}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|On the venerable Day of the Sun let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed.

It also indicates that Jews were observing the Sabbath on the Saturday.\n\n===Modern practices===\nSome Christian denominations, called \"[[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Sabbatarians]]\", observe a [[Saturday Sabbath]]. The name \"Sabbatarian\" has also been claimed by Christians, especially Protestants, who believe Sunday must be observed with just the sort of rigorous abstinence from work associated with \"[[Shabbat]]\". Christians in the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Seventh Day Baptist]], and [[Church of God (disambiguation)#Sabbatarian Churches of God|Church of God]] (Seventh-Day) denominations, as well as many [[Messianic Jews]], have maintained the practice of abstaining from work and gathering for worship on Saturdays (sunset to sunset) as did all of the followers of God in the Bible.\n\nFor most Christians the custom and obligation of Sunday rest is not as strict. A minority of Christians do not regard the day they attend church as important, so long as they attend. There is considerable variation in the observance of Sabbath rituals and restrictions, but some cessation of normal weekday activities is customary. Many Christians today observe Sunday as a day of church-attendance.\n\nIn [[Roman Catholic]] liturgy, Sunday begins on Saturday evening. The evening Mass on Saturday is liturgically a full Sunday Mass and fulfills the obligation of Sunday Mass attendance, and [[Vespers]] (evening prayer) on Saturday night is liturgically \"first Vespers\" of the Sunday. The same evening anticipation applies to other major solemnities and feasts, and is an echo of the Jewish practice of starting the new day at sunset. Those who work in the medical field, in law enforcement, and soldiers in a war zone are dispensed from the usual obligation to attend Church on Sunday. They are encouraged to combine their work with attending religious services if possible.\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], Sunday begins at the [[Little Entrance]] of Vespers (or [[All-Night Vigil]]) on Saturday evening and runs until \"Vouchsafe, O Lord\" (after the \"[[prokeimenon]]\") of Vespers on Sunday night. During this time, the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] at all services begin with the words, \"May Christ our True God, who rose from the dead ....\" Anyone who wishes to receive [[Holy Communion]] at [[Divine Liturgy]] on Sunday morning is required to attend Vespers the night before (see [[Eucharistic discipline]]). Among Orthodox Christians, Sunday is considered to be a \"Little [[Easter|Pascha]]\" (Easter), and because of the Paschal joy, the making of [[poklon|prostrations]] is forbidden, except in certain circumstances. Leisure activities and idleness, being secular and offensive to Christ as it is time-wasting, is prohibited{{dubious|date=April 2017}}.\n\nSome languages lack separate words for \"Saturday\" and \"Sabbath\" (e. g. Italian, Portuguese). Outside the English-speaking world, ''Sabbath'' as a word, if it is used, refers to the Saturday (or the specific Jewish practices on it); Sunday is called the Lord's Day e. g. in Romance languages and Modern Greek. On the other hand, English-speaking Christians often refer to the Sunday as the Sabbath (other than Seventh-day Sabbatarians); a practice which, probably due to the international connections and the Latin tradition of the Roman Catholic Church, is more widespread among (but not limited to) Protestants. [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] traditionally referred to Sunday as \"First Day\" eschewing the [[paganism|pagan]] origin of the English name, while referring to Saturday as the \"Seventh day\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iymc.org/calendarnames.html |title=Guide to Quaker Calendar Names |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= |publisher=Iowa Yearly Meeting (Conservative) Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) |access-date=30 March 2017 |quote=In the 20th Century, many Friends began accepting use of the common date names, feeling that any pagan meaning has been forgotten. The numerical names continue to be used, however, in many documents and more formal situations.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe Russian word for Sunday is \"Voskresenie,\" meaning \"Resurrection day.\" The Greek word for Sunday is \"Kyriake\" (the \"Lord's Day\"). The [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] words for Sunday (\"ned\u011ble,\" \"niedziela,\" \"nedelja\", \"nedjelja,\"  \"\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0459\u0430\", \"\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0456\u043b\u044f\" and \"\u043d\u044f\u0434\u0437\u0435\u043b\u044f\" respectively) can be translated as \"without acts (no work).\"\n\n==Common occurrences on Sunday==\n\n===In government and business===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\n{{further information|Sunday shopping}}\nIn the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], most government offices are closed on both Saturday and Sunday. The practice of offices closing on Sunday in government and in some rural areas of the United States stem from a system of [[Blue law|blue laws]]. Blue laws were established in the early puritan days which forbade secular activities on Sunday and were rigidly enforced. Some public activities are still regulated by these blue laws in the 21st century.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/blue-law|title=Blue law {{!}} American history|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en}}</ref> In 1985 twenty-two states in which religious fundamentalism remained strong maintained general restrictions on Sunday behavior.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=BL014|title=Blue Laws {{!}} The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture|website=www.okhistory.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}</ref> In Oklahoma, for example, it is stated: \"Oklahoma's statutes state that \"acts deemed useless and serious interruptions of the repose and religious liberty of the community,\" such as trades, manufacturing, mechanical employment, horse racing, and gaming are forbidden. Public selling of commodities other than necessary foods and drinks, medicine, ice, and surgical and burial equipment, and other necessities can legally be prohibited on Sunday. In Oklahoma a fine not to exceed twenty-five dollars may be imposed on individuals for each offense.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Because of these blue laws, many private sector retail businesses open later and close earlier on Sunday or don't open at all.\n\nMany countries, particularly in [[Europe]] such as [[Sweden]], [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Belgium]], but also in other countries such as [[Peru]], hold their national and local [[elections]] on a Sunday, either by law or by tradition.\n\n===In media===\nMany American and British daily [[newspaper]]s publish a larger edition on Sundays, which often includes [[color]] [[comic strip]]s, a [[magazine]], and a [[coupon]] section; may only publish on a Sunday, or may have a \"sister-paper\" with a different masthead that only publishes on a Sunday.\n\nNorth American [[radio]] stations often play specialty radio shows such as [[Casey Kasem]]'s countdown or other nationally syndicated radio shows that may differ from their regular weekly music patterns on Sunday morning or Sunday evening. In the [[United Kingdom]], there is a Sunday tradition of chart shows on [[BBC Radio 1]] and [[Independent Local Radio|commercial radio]]; this originates in the broadcast of chart shows and other populist material on Sundays by [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] when the [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Reithian]] [[BBC]]'s Sunday output consisted largely of solemn and religious programmes.  The first Sunday chart show was broadcast on the [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]] on 7 January 1962,<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/b7556e5ed91d41a589b75dfe03b2c3f0 BBC Genome Project - Radio Times listings]</ref> which was considered a radical step at the time.

Certain historically religious cities such as [[Boston]] and [[Baltimore]] among others will schedule games no earlier than 1:35 PM to ensure time for people who go to religious service in the morning can get to the game in time.\n\nIn the United States, professional [[American football]] is usually played on Sunday, although Saturday (via ''[[Run to the Playoffs|Saturday Night Football]]''), Monday (via ''[[Monday Night Football]]''), and Thursday (via ''[[Run to the Playoffs|Thursday Night Football]]'' or [[Thanksgiving]]) see some professional games. [[College football]] usually occurs on Saturday, and [[high school football|high-school football]] tends to take place on Friday night or Saturday afternoon.\n\nIn the [[UK]], some [[Club (organization)|club]] and [[Premier League]] football matches and tournaments usually take place on Sundays. [[Rugby football|Rugby]] matches and tournaments usually take place in club grounds or [[park]]s on Sunday mornings. It is not uncommon for church attendance to shift on days when a late morning or early afternoon game is anticipated by a local community.\n\nOne of the remains of [[pillarisation|religious segregation in the Netherlands]] is seen in [[Hoofdklasse|amateur football]]: The Saturday-clubs are by and large [[Protestantism in the Netherlands|Protestant Christian]] clubs, who were [[first-day Sabbath|not allowed to play on Sunday]]. The Sunday-clubs were in general [[Catholicism in the Netherlands|Catholic]] and working class clubs, whose players had to work on Saturday and therefore could only play on Sunday.\n\nIn [[Ireland]], [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]] matches are predominantly played on Sundays, with the first (used to be second) and fourth (used to be third) Sundays in September always playing host to the All-Ireland hurling and football championship finals, respectively.\n\nProfessional [[golf]] tournaments traditionally end on Sunday. Traditionally, those in the United Kingdom ended on Saturday, but this changed some time ago; for example, the [[Open Championship|Open]] ran from Wednesday to Saturday up to 1979<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/d4d2f847153343079994435985ac03aa Radio Times listing - Wednesday 18 July 1979]</ref> but has run from Thursday to Sunday since 1980.<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/af9a92015e214b3cb57a66869c49dd24 Radio Times listing - Sunday 20 July 1980]</ref>\n\nIn the United States and Canada, [[National Basketball Association]] and [[National Hockey League]] games, which are usually played at night during the week, are frequently played during daytime hours - often broadcast on national television.\n\nMost [[NASCAR Sprint Cup]] and [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]] events are held on Sundays. [[Formula One World Championship]] races are always held on Sundays regardless of timezone/country, while [[MotoGP]] holds most races on Sundays, with Middle Eastern races being the exception on Saturday.

During the 1st and 2nd century, the week of seven days was introduced into [[Rome]] from [[Egypt]], and the Roman names of the planets were given to each successive day.\n\n[[Germanic peoples]] seem to have adopted the [[week]] as a division of time from the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], but they changed the Roman names into those of corresponding [[Teutons|Teutonic]] [[deities]]. Hence, the ''dies Solis'' became Sunday (German, ''Sonntag'').\n\nThe English noun ''Sunday'' derived sometime before 1250 from ''sunedai'', which itself developed from [[Old English]] (before 700) ''Sunnand\u00e6g'' (literally meaning \"[[sun]]'s day\"), which is cognate to other [[Germanic languages]], including [[Old Frisian]] ''sunnandei'', [[Old Saxon]] ''sunnundag'', [[Middle Dutch]] ''sonnendach'' (modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''zondag''), [[Old High German]] ''sunnun tag'' (modern [[German language|German]] ''Sonntag''), and [[Old Norse]] ''sunnudagr'' ([[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''s\u00f8ndag'', [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''sunnudagur'' and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''s\u00f6ndag''). The Germanic term is a [[Interpretatio graeca|Germanic interpretation]] of [[Latin]] ''dies solis'' (\"day of the sun\"), which is a translation of the [[Ancient Greek]] ''hem\u00e9ra hel\u00edou''.<ref name=BARNHART778>Barnhart (1995:778).</ref>\nThe [[p-Celtic]] [[Welsh language]] also translates the Latin \"day of the sun\" as ''dydd Sul''.\n\nIn most [[Languages of India|Indian languages]], the word for Sunday is ''Raviv\u0101ra'' or ''Adityav\u0101ra'' or its derived forms \u2014 ''v\u0101ra'' meaning day, ''Aditya'' and ''Ravi'' both being a [[style (manner of address)]] for [[Surya]] i.e. the [[Sun]] and [[Suryadeva]] the chief [[solar deity]] and one of the [[Aditya]]s. Raviv\u0101ra is first day cited in [[Jyotisha]], which provides logical reason for giving the name of each week day. In the [[Thai solar calendar]] of [[Thailand]], the name (\"Waan Arthit\") is derived from Aditya, and the associated colour is [[red]].\n\nIn [[Russian language|Russian]] the word for Sunday is \u0412\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435 (Voskreseniye) meaning \"[[Resurrection]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seminarzkr.narod.ru/kalendar/pages/01_mir/pr_00_nedelja.html|title=\u0414\u041d\u0418 \u041d\u0415\u0414\u0415\u041b\u0418 - \u0421\u041b\u0410\u0412\u042f\u041d\u0421\u041a\u0410\u042f \u0421\u0415\u0414\u042c\u041c\u0418\u0426\u0410 | accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref> In other [[Slavic languages]] the word means \"no work\", for example Polish: Niedziela, Ukrainian: \u041d\u0435\u0434i\u043b\u044f, Belorussian: \u041d\u044f\u0434\u0437\u0435\u043b\u044f, Croatian: nedjelja, Serbian and Slovenian: Nedelja, Czech: Ned\u011ble, and Bulgarian: \u041d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044f.\n\nThe [[Modern Greek]] word for Sunday, {{lang-el|\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae}}, is derived from {{lang-el|\u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2}} ([[Kyrios]], Lord) also, due to its liturgical significance as the day commemorating [[Resurrection of Jesus|the resurrection of Jesus Christ]], i.e. [[Lord's Day|The Lord's Day]].\n\nIn Korean, Sunday is called \uc77c\uc694\uc77c Il-yo-Il, meaning \"day of sun\". In Japanese, Sunday is \u65e5\u66dc\u65e5 Nichiy\u014dbi, which translates to \"sun day\".\n\nThe [[Arabic]] word for Sunday is \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u062f (Al-Ahad), which means \"The first\". Usually it's comes after the word \u064a\u0648\u0645 (Youm or Yom) which means day. Which translates as \"The first day\" when combining them.\n\n==Position in the week==\n\n===ISO 8601===\nThe international standard [[ISO 8601]] for representation of dates and [[time]]s, states that Sunday is the seventh and last day of the week.<ref>\n\n\"Monday shall be identified as calendar day [1] of any calendar week, and subsequent calendar days of the same calendar week shall be numbered in ascending sequence to Sunday (calendar day [7]).\"\nFurther discussion: UK National Physical Laboratory: \"Which is the first day of the week?

A number of languages express this position either by the name for the day or by the naming of the other days. In Hebrew it is called \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df ''yom rishon'', in Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u062f ''al-ahad'', in Persian and related languages \u06cc\u06a9\u0634\u0646\u0628\u0647 ''yek-shanbe'', all meaning \"first\".\n\nIn [[Greek language|Greek]], the names of the days Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday (\"\u0394\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\", \"\u03a4\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\", \"\u03a4\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7\" and \"\u03a0\u03ad\u03bc\u03c0\u03c4\u03b7\") mean \"second\", \"third\", \"fourth\", and \"fifth\" respectively. This leaves Sunday in the first position of the week count. The current Greek name for Sunday, ''\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae'' (Kyriake), means \"Lord's Day\" coming from the word ''\u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2'' (Kyrios), which is the Greek word for \"Lord\". Similarly in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], where the days from Monday to Friday are counted as \"segunda-feira\", \"ter\u00e7a-feira\", \"quarta-feira\", \"quinta-feira\" and \"sexta-feira\", while Sunday itself similar to Greek has the name of \"Lord's Day\" (\"domingo\"). In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the working days in the week are named as: \"Th\u1ee9 Hai\" (second day), \"Th\u1ee9 Ba\" (third day), \"Th\u1ee9 T\u01b0\" (fourth day), \"Th\u1ee9 N\u0103m\" (fifth day), \"Th\u1ee9 S\u00e1u\" (sixth day), \"Th\u1ee9 B\u1ea3y\" (seventh day). Sunday is called \"Ch\u1ee7 Nh\u1eadt\", a corrupted form of \"Ch\u00faa Nh\u1eadt\" meaning \"Lord's Day\". Some colloquial text in the south of [[Vietnam]] and from the church may still use the old form to mean Sunday.  In [[German language|German]], Wednesday is called \"Mittwoch\", literally \"mid-week\", implying that weeks run from Sunday to Saturday.\n\nThe name is similar in the [[Romance Languages]]. In [[Italian language|Italian]], Sunday is called \"domenica\", which also means \"Lord's Day\" (from Latin \"Dies Dominica\"). One finds similar cognates in [[French language|French]], where the name is \"dimanche\", as well as [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (\"duminic\u0103\") and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (\"domingo\").\n\n[[Slavic languages]] implicitly number Monday as day number one, not two. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! \n!

In Old Russian Sunday was also called ''\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044f'' \"free day\" or \"day with no work\", but in the contemporary language this word means \"week\".\n[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''p\u00e9ntek'' (Friday) is a Slavic [[loanword]], so the correlation with \"five\" is not evident to Hungarians. Hungarians use ''Vas\u00e1rnap'' for Sunday, which means \"market day\". \n\nIn the [[Maltese language]], due to its [[Siculo-Arabic]] origin, Sunday is called \"Il-\u0126add\", a corruption of \"wie\u0127ed\" meaning \"one\". Monday is \"It-Tnejn\" meaning \"two\". Similarly Tuesday is \"It-Tlieta\" (three), Wednesday is \"L-Erbg\u0127a\" (four) and Thursday is \"Il-\u0126amis\" (five).\n\nIn [[Armenian language|Armenian]], Monday is (Yerkoushabti) literally meaning 2nd day of the week, Tuesday (Yerekshabti) 3rd day, Wednesday (Chorekshabti) 4th day, Thursday (Hingshabti) 5th day. Saturday is (Shabat) coming from the word Sabbath or Shabbath in Hebrew, and \"Kiraki\" coming from the word \"Krak\" meaning \"fire\" is Sunday, \"Krak\" describing the sun by fire. Apostle John also refers to the \"Lord's Day\" (in [[Greek language|Greek]], ''\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u1f21\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1'', \"kyriake hemera\" i.e. the day of the Lord) in Rev. 1:10, which is another possible origin of the Armenian word for Sunday.\n\nHowever, in many European countries calendars almost always show Monday as the first day of the week,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/weekinfo.htm#TSW |title=Calendar Weeks |author=J. R. Stockton |accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref> which follows the [[ISO 8601]] standard.\n\nIn the [[Persian calendar]], Sunday is the second day of the week. However, it is called \"number one\" as counting starts from zero; the first day - Saturday - is denoted as 00.\n\n<span id=\"Sunday_and_the_Sabbath\"></span>\n\n==Sunday in Christianity==\n\n===Pagan correspondence===\n\nIn Roman culture, Sunday was the day of the Sun god. In paganism, the Sun was a source of life, giving warmth and illumination to mankind. It was the center of a popular cult among Romans, who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed.{{Dubious| Is this in source given, Chadwick's book? I don't have the book at hand, and I don't think it particularly implausible, but I have never heard of such a Roman custom and wouldn't think it is altogether implausible either to suppose that to the Sabbatarian propagandists roaming about this article invented such a custom.|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe opportunity to spot in the nature-worship of their heathen neighbors a symbolism valid to their own faith was not lost on the Christians. One of the Church fathers, [[St. Jerome]], would declare: \"If pagans call [the Lord's Day] [...] the 'day of the sun,' we willingly agree, for today the light of the world is raised, today is revealed the sun of justice with healing in his rays.\"<ref>St. Jerome, Pasch.: CCL 78, 550, as quoted in: [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|CCC]] 1166.</ref>\n\nA similar consideration may have influenced the choice of the [[Christmas|Christmas date]] on the day of the winter solstice, whose celebration was part of the Roman cult of the Sun.{{Dubious|Again, on 25th December was certainly the Sol Invictus feast and possibly a Mithraic feast, but neither cult is ''Roman cult'' properly speaking. Whether the ancient Romans, who by the way were not Germanics, laid much importance on the winter solstice only a few days before or after their ''Saturnalia'' seems dubious to me. My guess would be that the source means the Sol-invictus-feast, but it would be wrong to describe this as \"Roman cult\".|date=July 2017}}<ref>{{cite book|author=Owen Chadwick|title=A History of Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qugouOh3KjMC&pg=PA22|year=1998|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=22}}</ref> In the same vein, Christian churches have been built and are still being built (as far as possible) with an orientation so that the congregation faced toward the sunrise in the East. Much later, [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] would sing in his famous [[Canticle of the Sun|canticle]]: \"Be praised, my Lord, through all your creatures, especially through my lord Brother Sun, who brings the day; and you give light through him. And he is beautiful and radiant in all his splendor! Of you, Most High, he bears the likeness.\"\n\n===Christian usage===\n{{See also|Sabbath in Christianity}}\n\nThe ancient Romans traditionally used the eight-day [[Nundinae|nundinal cycle]], a market week, but in the time of [[Augustus]] in the 1st century AD, a seven-day week also came into use.\n\n[[Justin Martyr]], in the mid [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]], mentions \"memoirs of the apostles\" as being read on \"the day called that of the sun\" (Sunday) alongside the \"writings of the prophets.\" <ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Citation | first = Justin | last = Martyr | title = [[First Apology]] | at = 67.3}}.</ref>\n\nOn 7 March 321, [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]], Rome's first Christian Emperor (see [[Constantine I and Christianity]]), decreed that Sunday would be observed as the Roman day of rest:<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last = Zerubavel\n| first = Eviatar\n| title = The Seven Day Circle: The History and Meaning of the Week\n| publisher = University of Chicago Press\n| date = 1989\n| page = 45\n| isbn = 9780226981659}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|On the venerable Day of the Sun let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed.

It also indicates that Jews were observing the Sabbath on the Saturday.\n\n===Modern practices===\nSome Christian denominations, called \"[[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Sabbatarians]]\", observe a [[Saturday Sabbath]]. The name \"Sabbatarian\" has also been claimed by Christians, especially Protestants, who believe Sunday must be observed with just the sort of rigorous abstinence from work associated with \"[[Shabbat]]\". Christians in the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Seventh Day Baptist]], and [[Church of God (disambiguation)#Sabbatarian Churches of God|Church of God]] (Seventh-Day) denominations, as well as many [[Messianic Jews]], have maintained the practice of abstaining from work and gathering for worship on Saturdays (sunset to sunset) as did all of the followers of God in the Bible.\n\nFor most Christians the custom and obligation of Sunday rest is not as strict. A minority of Christians do not regard the day they attend church as important, so long as they attend. There is considerable variation in the observance of Sabbath rituals and restrictions, but some cessation of normal weekday activities is customary. Many Christians today observe Sunday as a day of church-attendance.\n\nIn [[Roman Catholic]] liturgy, Sunday begins on Saturday evening. The evening Mass on Saturday is liturgically a full Sunday Mass and fulfills the obligation of Sunday Mass attendance, and [[Vespers]] (evening prayer) on Saturday night is liturgically \"first Vespers\" of the Sunday. The same evening anticipation applies to other major solemnities and feasts, and is an echo of the Jewish practice of starting the new day at sunset. Those who work in the medical field, in law enforcement, and soldiers in a war zone are dispensed from the usual obligation to attend Church on Sunday. They are encouraged to combine their work with attending religious services if possible.\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], Sunday begins at the [[Little Entrance]] of Vespers (or [[All-Night Vigil]]) on Saturday evening and runs until \"Vouchsafe, O Lord\" (after the \"[[prokeimenon]]\") of Vespers on Sunday night. During this time, the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] at all services begin with the words, \"May Christ our True God, who rose from the dead ....\" Anyone who wishes to receive [[Holy Communion]] at [[Divine Liturgy]] on Sunday morning is required to attend Vespers the night before (see [[Eucharistic discipline]]). Among Orthodox Christians, Sunday is considered to be a \"Little [[Easter|Pascha]]\" (Easter), and because of the Paschal joy, the making of [[poklon|prostrations]] is forbidden, except in certain circumstances. Leisure activities and idleness, being secular and offensive to Christ as it is time-wasting, is prohibited{{dubious|date=April 2017}}.\n\nSome languages lack separate words for \"Saturday\" and \"Sabbath\" (e. g. Italian, Portuguese). Outside the English-speaking world, ''Sabbath'' as a word, if it is used, refers to the Saturday (or the specific Jewish practices on it); Sunday is called the Lord's Day e. g. in Romance languages and Modern Greek. On the other hand, English-speaking Christians often refer to the Sunday as the Sabbath (other than Seventh-day Sabbatarians); a practice which, probably due to the international connections and the Latin tradition of the Roman Catholic Church, is more widespread among (but not limited to) Protestants. [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] traditionally referred to Sunday as \"First Day\" eschewing the [[paganism|pagan]] origin of the English name, while referring to Saturday as the \"Seventh day\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iymc.org/calendarnames.html |title=Guide to Quaker Calendar Names |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= |publisher=Iowa Yearly Meeting (Conservative) Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) |access-date=30 March 2017 |quote=In the 20th Century, many Friends began accepting use of the common date names, feeling that any pagan meaning has been forgotten.

The practice of offices closing on Sunday in government and in some rural areas of the United States stem from a system of [[Blue law|blue laws]].

In the [[United Kingdom]], there is a Sunday tradition of chart shows on [[BBC Radio 1]] and [[Independent Local Radio|commercial radio]]; this originates in the broadcast of chart shows and other populist material on Sundays by [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] when the [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Reithian]] [[BBC]]'s Sunday output consisted largely of solemn and religious programmes.

BBC Radio 1's chart show moved to Fridays in July 2015<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-32019327|title=Radio 1 chart show moving to Friday afternoons|first=Mark|last=Savage|date=24 March 2015|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> but a chart update on Sundays was launched in July 2019.<ref>[http://www.musicweek.com/media/read/bbc-radio-1-to-launch-first-glance-sunday-chart-show-this-week/076743 Music Week website, 10 July 2019]</ref>\n\nPeriod or older-skewing television dramas, such as ''[[Downton Abbey]]'', ''[[Call the Midwife]]'', ''[[Lark Rise to Candleford (TV series)|Lark Rise to Candleford]]'' and ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'' are commonly shown on Sunday evenings in the UK; the first of these was ''[[Dr Finlay's Casebook]]'' in the 1960s.<ref>''The Kaleidoscope British Independent Television Drama Research Guide 1955-2010'' and ''The Kaleidoscope BBC Television Drama Research Guide 1936-2011'', [[Kaleidoscope Publishing]]</ref>  Similarly, ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' has been shown on Sundays on [[BBC One|BBC1]] since 1979<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?adv=0&q=Antiques%20Roadshow&media=all&yf=1923&yt=2009&mf=1&mt=12&tf=00:00&tt=00:00#search|title=Search Results - BBC Genome|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref> and ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]'' was shown on Sundays for many years until it ended in 2010.<ref>''The British Television Comedy Research Guide 1936-2011'', [[Kaleidoscope Publishing]], 2011</ref> On Sunday nights, [[BBC Radio 2]] plays music in styles it once played most of the time but which are now rarely heard on the station, with presenters such as [[Clare Teal]]<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00079z4 The Swing and Big Band Show, BBC Radio 2, 4 August 2019]</ref> and [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00079z6 Don Black, BBC Radio 2, 4 August 2019]</ref> Even younger-skewing media outlets sometimes skew older on Sundays within the terms of their own audience; for example, [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] introduced an \"Old Skool Sunday\" schedule in the autumn of 2019.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2019/1xtra-schedule BBC press release, 5 August 2019]</ref>\n\nMany American, Australian and British television networks and stations also broadcast their [[Sunday morning talk shows|political interview shows]] on Sunday mornings.\n\n===In sports===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\n[[Major League Baseball]] usually schedules all Sunday games in the daytime except for the nationally televised ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]'' matchup. Certain historically religious cities such as [[Boston]] and [[Baltimore]] among others will schedule games no earlier than 1:35 PM to ensure time for people who go to religious service in the morning can get to the game in time.\n\nIn the United States, professional [[American football]] is usually played on Sunday, although Saturday (via ''[[Run to the Playoffs|Saturday Night Football]]''), Monday (via ''[[Monday Night Football]]''), and Thursday (via ''[[Run to the Playoffs|Thursday Night Football]]'' or [[Thanksgiving]]) see some professional games. [[College football]] usually occurs on Saturday, and [[high school football|high-school football]] tends to take place on Friday night or Saturday afternoon.\n\nIn the [[UK]], some [[Club (organization)|club]] and [[Premier League]] football matches and tournaments usually take place on Sundays. [[Rugby football|Rugby]] matches and tournaments usually take place in club grounds or [[park]]s on Sunday mornings. It is not uncommon for church attendance to shift on days when a late morning or early afternoon game is anticipated by a local community.\n\nOne of the remains of [[pillarisation|religious segregation in the Netherlands]] is seen in [[Hoofdklasse|amateur football]]: The Saturday-clubs are by and large [[Protestantism in the Netherlands|Protestant Christian]] clubs, who were [[first-day Sabbath|not allowed to play on Sunday]]. The Sunday-clubs were in general [[Catholicism in the Netherlands|Catholic]] and working class clubs, whose players had to work on Saturday and therefore could only play on Sunday.\n\nIn [[Ireland]], [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]] matches are predominantly played on Sundays, with the first (used to be second) and fourth (used to be third) Sundays in September always playing host to the All-Ireland hurling and football championship finals, respectively.\n\nProfessional [[golf]] tournaments traditionally end on Sunday. Traditionally, those in the United Kingdom ended on Saturday, but this changed some time ago; for example, the [[Open Championship|Open]] ran from Wednesday to Saturday up to 1979<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/d4d2f847153343079994435985ac03aa Radio Times listing - Wednesday 18 July 1979]</ref> but has run from Thursday to Sunday since 1980.<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/af9a92015e214b3cb57a66869c49dd24 Radio Times listing - Sunday 20 July 1980]</ref>\n\nIn the United States and Canada, [[National Basketball Association]] and [[National Hockey League]] games, which are usually played at night during the week, are frequently played during daytime hours - often broadcast on national television.\n\nMost [[NASCAR Sprint Cup]] and [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]] events are held on Sundays. [[Formula One World Championship]] races are always held on Sundays regardless of timezone/country, while [[MotoGP]] holds most races on Sundays, with Middle Eastern races being the exception on Saturday. All Formula One events and MotoGP events with Sunday races involve qualifying taking place on Saturday.\n\n==Astrology==\nSunday is associated with the Sun and is symbolized by '''<big>\u2609</big>'''.\n\n==Named days==\n* [[Advent Sunday]]\n* [[Black Sunday (disambiguation)|Black Sunday]]\n* [[Bloody Sunday (disambiguation)|Bloody Sunday]]\n* [[Cold Sunday]]\n* [[Easter Sunday]] represents the resurrection of Christ\n* [[Gaudete Sunday]] is the third Sunday of [[Advent]].\n* [[Gloomy Sunday]]\n* [[Good Shepherd Sunday]] is the fourth Sunday of Easter.\n* [[Laetare Sunday]] is the fourth Sunday of [[Lent]].\n* [[Octave of Easter|Low Sunday]], first Sunday after Easter, is also known as the Octave of Easter, White Sunday, Quasimodo Sunday, Alb Sunday, Antipascha Sunday, and [[Divine Mercy Sunday]].\n* [[Passion Sunday]], the fifth Sunday of [[Lent]] as the beginning of [[Passiontide]] (since 1970 for Roman Catholics in the ordinary form of the rite, the term remains only official among the greater title of the Palm Sunday, which used to be also the \"2nd Sunday of Passiontide\")\n* [[Palm Sunday]] is the Sunday before Easter.\n* [[Selection Sunday]]\n* [[Septuagesima]], [[Sexagesima]] and [[Quinquagesima]] Sunday are the last three Sundays before [[Lent]]. ''Quinquagesima'' (\"fiftieth\"), is the fiftieth day before Easter, reckoning inclusively; but ''Sexagesima'' is not the sixtieth day and ''Septuagesima'' is not the seventieth but is the sixty-fourth day prior. The use of these terms was abandoned by the Catholic Church in the 1970 calendar reforms (the Sundays before Lent are now simply \"Sundays in ordinary time\" with no special status). However, their use is still continued in [[Lutheran]] tradition: for example, \"Septuagesimae\".\n* [[Shavuot]] is the Jewish Pentecost, or 'Festival of Weeks'. For [[Karaite Jews]] it always falls on a Sunday.\n* [[Stir-up Sunday]] is the last Sunday before [[Advent]].\n* [[Super Bowl|Super Bowl Sunday]]\n* [[Trinity Sunday]] is the first Sunday after [[Pentecost]].\n* [[Whitsun]]day \"White Sunday\" is the day of [[Pentecost]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[After Saturday Comes Sunday]] \n* [[Blue law]]s\n* [[Kyriaki (martyr)|Saint Kyriake]]\n* [[Sol Invictus]]\n* [[Sunday Christian]]\n* [[Sunday (computer virus)]]\n* [[Sunday Island (disambiguation)|Sunday Island]]\n* [[Sunday league football]]\n* [[Sunday Morning (disambiguation)|Sunday Morning]]\n* [[Sunday night blues]]\n* [[Sunday roast]]\n* [[Sunday school]]\n* [[Sunday shopping]]\n* [[Surya]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [[Robert Barnhart|Barnhart, Robert K.]] (1995).

While some individual police, as the situation developed, behaved with care and courtesy, many appeared to be excessively aggressive.<ref name=campbell/></blockquote>Overall, the situation got violent towards the end of the campaign.
