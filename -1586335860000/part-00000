Initially, as the temperature of the pan is just below {{convert|100|C|F}}, the water flattens out and slowly evaporates, or if the temperature of the pan is well below {{convert|100|C|F}}, the water stays liquid. As the temperature of the pan goes above {{convert|100|C|F}}, the water droplets hiss when touching the pan and these droplets evaporate quickly. Later, as the temperature exceeds the Leidenfrost point, the Leidenfrost effect comes into play. On contact with the pan, the water droplets bunch up into small balls of water and skitter around, lasting much longer than when the temperature of the pan was lower. This effect works until a much higher temperature causes any further drops of water to evaporate too quickly to cause this effect.\n\nThis is because at temperatures above the Leidenfrost point, the bottom part of the water droplet vaporizes immediately on contact with the hot pan. The resulting gas suspends the rest of the water droplet just above it, preventing any further direct contact between the liquid water and the hot pan.  As steam has much poorer [[thermal conductivity]] than the metal pan, further heat transfer between the pan and the droplet is slowed down dramatically. This also results in the drop being able to skid around the pan on the layer of gas just under it.\n\n[[File:Heat transfer leading to Leidenfrost effect for water at 1 atm.png|thumb|Behavior of water on a hot plate. Graph shows heat transfer (flux) vs temperature. Leidenfrost effect occurs after transition boiling.]]\n\nThe temperature at which the Leidenfrost effect begins to occur is not easy to predict. Even if the volume of the drop of liquid stays the same, the Leidenfrost point may be quite different, with a complicated dependence on the properties of the surface, as well as any impurities in the liquid. Some research has been conducted into a theoretical model of the system, but it is quite complicated.<ref name=\"Bernardin & Mudawar\" >{{cite journal |doi=10.1115/1.1470487 |title=A Cavity Activation and Bubble Growth Model of the Leidenfrost Point |journal=Journal of Heat Transfer |volume=124 |issue=5 |pages=864\u201374 |date=2002 |last1=Bernardin |first1=John D. |last2=Mudawar |first2=Issam}}</ref>  As a very rough estimate, the Leidenfrost point for a drop of water on a frying pan might occur at {{convert|193|C|F}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nThe effect was also described by the eminent Victorian steam boiler designer, [[Sir William Fairbairn]], in reference to its effect on massively reducing heat transfer from a hot iron surface to water, such as within a boiler.

A drop of water that was vaporized almost immediately at {{convert|168|C}} persisted for 152 seconds at {{convert|202|C}}. Lower temperatures in a boiler [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] might evaporate water more quickly as a result; compare [[Mpemba effect]]. An alternative approach was to increase the temperature beyond the Leidenfrost point. Fairbairn considered this too, and may have been contemplating the [[flash boiler|flash steam boiler]], but considered the technical aspects insurmountable for the time.\n\nThe Leidenfrost point may also be taken to be the temperature for which the hovering droplet lasts longest.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Incropera, DeWitt, Bergman & Lavine: Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer, 6th edition.

It represents the point on the boiling curve where the heat flux is at the minimum and the surface is completely covered by a vapor blanket. Heat transfer from the surface to the liquid occurs by conduction and radiation through the vapor. In 1756, Leidenfrost observed that water droplets supported by the vapor film slowly evaporate as they move about on the hot surface. As the surface temperature is increased, radiation through the vapor film becomes more significant and the heat flux increases with increasing excess temperature.\n\nThe minimum heat flux for a large horizontal plate can be derived from Zuber's equation,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n<math display=\"block\">{{\\frac{q}{A}}_{min}}=C{{h}_{fg}}{{\\rho }_{v}}{{\\left[ \\frac{\\sigma g\\left( {{\\rho }_{L}}-{{\\rho }_{v}} \\right)}{{{\\left( {{\\rho }_{L}}+{{\\rho }_{v}} \\right)}^{2}}} \\right]}^{{}^{1}\\!\\!\\diagup\\!\\!{}_{4}\\;}}</math>\n\nwhere the properties are evaluated at saturation temperature. Zuber's constant, C is approximately 0.09 for most fluids at moderate pressures.\n\n== Heat transfer correlations ==\n\nThe heat transfer coefficient may be approximated using Bromley's equation,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n<math display=\"block\">h=C{{\\left[ \\frac{k_{v}^{3}{{\\rho }_{v}}g\\left( {{\\rho }_{L}}-{{\\rho }_{v}} \\right)\\left( {{h}_{fg}}+0.4{{c}_{pv}}\\left( {{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{sat}} \\right) \\right)}{{{D}_{o}}{{\\mu }_{v}}\\left( {{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{sat}} \\right)} \\right]}^{{}^{1}\\!\\!\\diagup\\!\\!{}_{4}\\;}}</math>\n\nWhere, <math>{{D}_{o}}</math> is the outside diameter of the tube. The correlation constant C is 0.62 for horizontal cylinders and vertical plates and 0.67 for spheres. Vapor properties are evaluated at film temperature.\n\nFor stable film boiling on a horizontal surface, Berenson has modified Bromley's equation to yield,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">James R.

The total heat transfer coefficient can be is thus a combination of the two. Bromley has suggested the following equations for film boiling boiling from the outer surface of horizontal tubes.\n\n<math display=\"block\">{{h}^{{}^{4}\\!\\!\\diagup\\!\\!{}_{3}\\;}}={{h}_{conv}}^{{}^{4}\\!\\!\\diagup\\!\\!{}_{3}\\;}+{{h}_{rad}}{{h}^{{}^{1}\\!\\!\\diagup\\!\\!{}_{3}\\;}}</math>\n\nIf <math>{{h}_{rad}}<{{h}_{conv}}</math>,\n\n<math display=\"block\">h={{h}_{conv}}+\\frac{3}{4}{{h}_{rad}}</math>\n\nThe effective radiation coefficient, <math>{{h}_{rad}}</math> can be expressed as,\n\n<math display=\"block\">{{h}_{rad}}=\\frac{\\varepsilon \\sigma \\left( T_{s}^{4}-T_{sat}^{4} \\right)}{\\left( {{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{sat}} \\right)}</math>\n\nWhere, <math>\\varepsilon </math> is the emissivity of the solid and <math>\\sigma </math> is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n== Pressure field in a Leidenfrost droplet ==\n\nThe equation for the pressure field in the vapor region between the droplet and the solid surface can be solved for using the standard momentum and [[continuity equations]].  For the sake of simplicity in solving, a linear temperature profile and a parabolic velocity profile are assumed within the [[vapor phase]]. The heat transfer within the vapor phase is assumed to be through [[Conduction (heat)|conduction]]. With these approximations, the Navier-Stokes equation can be solved<ref>Carey, Van P. , Liquid Vapor Phase change Phenomena</ref> to get the pressure field.\n\n== Leidenfrost temperature and surface tension effects ==\n\nThe Leidenfrost temperature is the property of a given set of solid-liquid pair. The temperature of the solid surface beyond which the liquid undergoes Leidenfrost phenomenon is termed as Leidenfrost temperature. The calculation of Leidenfrost temperature involves the calculation of minimum film boiling temperature of a fluid. Berenson<ref>Berenson, P.J., ''[http://heattransfer.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=1432357 Film boiling heat transfer from a horizontal surface] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402125436/http://heattransfer.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=1432357 |date=2015-04-02 }}'', Journal of Heat Transfer, Volume 83, 1961, Pages 351-362</ref> obtained a relation for the minimum film boiling temperature from minimum heat flux arguments. While the equation for the minimum film boiling temperature, which can be found in the reference above, is quite complex, the features of it can be understood from a physical perspective.  One critical parameter to consider is the [[surface tension]]. The proportional relationship between the minimum film boiling temperature and surface tension is to be expected since fluids with higher surface tension need higher quantities of heat flux for the onset of [[nucleate boiling]]. Since film boiling occurs after nucleate boiling, the minimum temperature for film boiling should have a proportional dependence on the surface tension.\n\nHenry developed a model for Leidenfrost phenomenon which includes transient wetting and microlayer evaporation.<ref>Henry, R.E., ''[A correlation for the minimum film boiling temperature]'',Chem. Eng. Prog. Symp. Ser. , Volume 70, 1974, Pages 81-90</ref> Since the Leidenfrost phenomenon is a special case of film boiling, the Leidenfrost temperature is related to the minimum film boiling temperature via a relation which factors in the properties of the solid being used. While the Leidenfrost temperature is not directly related to the surface tension of the fluid, it is indirectly dependent on it through the film boiling temperature. For fluids with similar thermophysical properties, the one with higher surface tension usually has a higher Leidenfrost temperature.\n\nFor example, for a saturated water-copper interface, the Leidenfrost temperature is {{convert|257|C}}. The Leidenfrost temperatures for glycerol and common alcohols are significantly smaller because of their lower surface tension values (density and [[viscosity]] differences are also contributing factors.)\n\n== Reactive Leidenfrost effect ==\n[[File:Reactive Leidenfrost Effect with Cellulose.jpg|thumb|Reactive Leidenfrost effect of cellulose on silica, {{convert|750|C}}]]\n\nNon-volatile materials were discovered in 2015 to also exhibit a 'reactive Leidenfrost effect,' whereby solid particles were observed to float above hot surfaces and skitter around erratically.<ref>\"Scientists levitate wood on structured surfaces captured by high speed photography\" Phys.org. {{cite web |url=http://phys.org/news/2015-06-scientists-levitate-wood-surfaces-captured.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611164453/http://phys.org/news/2015-06-scientists-levitate-wood-surfaces-captured.html |archivedate=2015-06-11 }}</ref>  Detailed characterization of the reactive Leidenfrost effect was completed for small particles of [[cellulose]] (~0.5&nbsp;mm) on high temperature polished surfaces by high speed photography.

Some research has been conducted into a theoretical model of the system, but it is quite complicated.<ref name=\"Bernardin & Mudawar\" >{{cite journal |doi=10.1115/1.1470487 |title=A Cavity Activation and Bubble Growth Model of the Leidenfrost Point |journal=Journal of Heat Transfer |volume=124 |issue=5 |pages=864\u201374 |date=2002 |last1=Bernardin |first1=John D. |last2=Mudawar |first2=Issam}}</ref>  As a very rough estimate, the Leidenfrost point for a drop of water on a frying pan might occur at {{convert|193|C|F}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nThe effect was also described by the eminent Victorian steam boiler designer, [[Sir William Fairbairn]], in reference to its effect on massively reducing heat transfer from a hot iron surface to water, such as within a boiler.

Lower temperatures in a boiler [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] might evaporate water more quickly as a result; compare [[Mpemba effect]]. An alternative approach was to increase the temperature beyond the Leidenfrost point. Fairbairn considered this too, and may have been contemplating the [[flash boiler|flash steam boiler]], but considered the technical aspects insurmountable for the time.\n\nThe Leidenfrost point may also be taken to be the temperature for which the hovering droplet lasts longest.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Incropera, DeWitt, Bergman & Lavine: Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer, 6th edition.

It represents the point on the boiling curve where the heat flux is at the minimum and the surface is completely covered by a vapor blanket. Heat transfer from the surface to the liquid occurs by conduction and radiation through the vapor. In 1756, Leidenfrost observed that water droplets supported by the vapor film slowly evaporate as they move about on the hot surface. As the surface temperature is increased, radiation through the vapor film becomes more significant and the heat flux increases with increasing excess temperature.\n\nThe minimum heat flux for a large horizontal plate can be derived from Zuber's equation,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n<math display=\"block\">{{\\frac{q}{A}}_{min}}=C{{h}_{fg}}{{\\rho }_{v}}{{\\left[ \\frac{\\sigma g\\left( {{\\rho }_{L}}-{{\\rho }_{v}} \\right)}{{{\\left( {{\\rho }_{L}}+{{\\rho }_{v}} \\right)}^{2}}} \\right]}^{{}^{1}\\!\\!\\diagup\\!\\!{}_{4}\\;}}</math>\n\nwhere the properties are evaluated at saturation temperature. Zuber's constant, C is approximately 0.09 for most fluids at moderate pressures.\n\n== Heat transfer correlations ==\n\nThe heat transfer coefficient may be approximated using Bromley's equation,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n<math display=\"block\">h=C{{\\left[ \\frac{k_{v}^{3}{{\\rho }_{v}}g\\left( {{\\rho }_{L}}-{{\\rho }_{v}} \\right)\\left( {{h}_{fg}}+0.4{{c}_{pv}}\\left( {{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{sat}} \\right) \\right)}{{{D}_{o}}{{\\mu }_{v}}\\left( {{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{sat}} \\right)} \\right]}^{{}^{1}\\!\\!\\diagup\\!\\!{}_{4}\\;}}</math>\n\nWhere, <math>{{D}_{o}}</math> is the outside diameter of the tube. The correlation constant C is 0.62 for horizontal cylinders and vertical plates and 0.67 for spheres. Vapor properties are evaluated at film temperature.\n\nFor stable film boiling on a horizontal surface, Berenson has modified Bromley's equation to yield,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">James R. Welty; Charles E. Wicks; Robert E. Wilson; Gregory L. Rorrer., \"Fundamentals of Momentum, Heat and Mass transfer\" 5th edition, John Wiley and Sons.

The total heat transfer coefficient can be is thus a combination of the two. Bromley has suggested the following equations for film boiling boiling from the outer surface of horizontal tubes.\n\n<math display=\"block\">{{h}^{{}^{4}\\!\\!\\diagup\\!\\!{}_{3}\\;}}={{h}_{conv}}^{{}^{4}\\!\\!\\diagup\\!\\!{}_{3}\\;}+{{h}_{rad}}{{h}^{{}^{1}\\!\\!\\diagup\\!\\!{}_{3}\\;}}</math>\n\nIf <math>{{h}_{rad}}<{{h}_{conv}}</math>,\n\n<math display=\"block\">h={{h}_{conv}}+\\frac{3}{4}{{h}_{rad}}</math>\n\nThe effective radiation coefficient, <math>{{h}_{rad}}</math> can be expressed as,\n\n<math display=\"block\">{{h}_{rad}}=\\frac{\\varepsilon \\sigma \\left( T_{s}^{4}-T_{sat}^{4} \\right)}{\\left( {{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{sat}} \\right)}</math>\n\nWhere, <math>\\varepsilon </math> is the emissivity of the solid and <math>\\sigma </math> is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n== Pressure field in a Leidenfrost droplet ==\n\nThe equation for the pressure field in the vapor region between the droplet and the solid surface can be solved for using the standard momentum and [[continuity equations]].  For the sake of simplicity in solving, a linear temperature profile and a parabolic velocity profile are assumed within the [[vapor phase]]. The heat transfer within the vapor phase is assumed to be through [[Conduction (heat)|conduction]]. With these approximations, the Navier-Stokes equation can be solved<ref>Carey, Van P. , Liquid Vapor Phase change Phenomena</ref> to get the pressure field.\n\n== Leidenfrost temperature and surface tension effects ==\n\nThe Leidenfrost temperature is the property of a given set of solid-liquid pair. The temperature of the solid surface beyond which the liquid undergoes Leidenfrost phenomenon is termed as Leidenfrost temperature. The calculation of Leidenfrost temperature involves the calculation of minimum film boiling temperature of a fluid. Berenson<ref>Berenson, P.J., ''[http://heattransfer.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=1432357 Film boiling heat transfer from a horizontal surface] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402125436/http://heattransfer.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=1432357 |date=2015-04-02 }}'', Journal of Heat Transfer, Volume 83, 1961, Pages 351-362</ref> obtained a relation for the minimum film boiling temperature from minimum heat flux arguments. While the equation for the minimum film boiling temperature, which can be found in the reference above, is quite complex, the features of it can be understood from a physical perspective.  One critical parameter to consider is the [[surface tension]]. The proportional relationship between the minimum film boiling temperature and surface tension is to be expected since fluids with higher surface tension need higher quantities of heat flux for the onset of [[nucleate boiling]]. Since film boiling occurs after nucleate boiling, the minimum temperature for film boiling should have a proportional dependence on the surface tension.\n\nHenry developed a model for Leidenfrost phenomenon which includes transient wetting and microlayer evaporation.<ref>Henry, R.E., ''[A correlation for the minimum film boiling temperature]'',Chem. Eng. Prog. Symp. Ser. , Volume 70, 1974, Pages 81-90</ref> Since the Leidenfrost phenomenon is a special case of film boiling, the Leidenfrost temperature is related to the minimum film boiling temperature via a relation which factors in the properties of the solid being used. While the Leidenfrost temperature is not directly related to the surface tension of the fluid, it is indirectly dependent on it through the film boiling temperature. For fluids with similar thermophysical properties, the one with higher surface tension usually has a higher Leidenfrost temperature.\n\nFor example, for a saturated water-copper interface, the Leidenfrost temperature is {{convert|257|C}}. The Leidenfrost temperatures for glycerol and common alcohols are significantly smaller because of their lower surface tension values (density and [[viscosity]] differences are also contributing factors.)\n\n== Reactive Leidenfrost effect ==\n[[File:Reactive Leidenfrost Effect with Cellulose.jpg|thumb|Reactive Leidenfrost effect of cellulose on silica, {{convert|750|C}}]]\n\nNon-volatile materials were discovered in 2015 to also exhibit a 'reactive Leidenfrost effect,' whereby solid particles were observed to float above hot surfaces and skitter around erratically.<ref>\"Scientists levitate wood on structured surfaces captured by high speed photography\" Phys.org. {{cite web |url=http://phys.org/news/2015-06-scientists-levitate-wood-surfaces-captured.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611164453/http://phys.org/news/2015-06-scientists-levitate-wood-surfaces-captured.html |archivedate=2015-06-11 }}</ref>  Detailed characterization of the reactive Leidenfrost effect was completed for small particles of [[cellulose]] (~0.5&nbsp;mm) on high temperature polished surfaces by high speed photography.

The new phenomenon of a 'reactive Leidenfrost (RL) effect' was characterized by a dimensionless quantity (\u03c6<sub>RL</sub>= \u03c4<sub>conv</sub>/\u03c4<sub>rxn</sub>), which relates the time constant of solid particle heat transfer to the time constant of particle reaction, with the reactive Leidenfrost effect occurring for 10<sup>\u22121</sup>< \u03c6<sub>RL</sub>< 10<sup>+1</sup>.

His thoughts and work influenced the launching of many social, religious, literary and political organisations and movements in Kerala and for the first time gave voice to those who were marginalised.\n\nChattampi Swamikal denounced the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] interpretation of Hindu texts citing sources from the [[Vedas]]. Swamikal along with his contemporary, [[Narayana Guru]], strived to reform the heavily [[ritualistic]] and caste-ridden Hindu society of the late 19th century [[Kerala]]. Swamikal also worked for the emancipation of women and encouraged them to come to the forefront of society. Swamikal promoted [[vegetarianism]] and professed non-violence ([[Ahimsa]]). Swamikal believed that the different religions are different paths leading to the same place. Chattampi Swamikal throughout his intellectually and spiritually enriched life maintained many friends from different regions of Kerala. He authored several books on spirituality, history, and language staying with these friends.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Statue of chattampi swamikal at attukal temple DSC 8709.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Chattampi Swamikal at Attukal temple]]\nChattampi Swami was born on 25 August 1853 at Kollur in southern [[Travancore]]. His father was Thamarassery Vasudeva Sharma, a [[Nambudiri]] [[Brahmin]] from Mavelikkara, and his mother was Nangamma Pillai, a [[Nair]] from Kannammoola. He was formally named Ayyappan but was called by the pet name of Kunjan Pillai \u2013 meaning \"small male baby\" \u2013 by all. As his parents were not able to provide him formal education, he learned letters and words from children of his neighbourhood who attended schools. Also he learned Sanskrit by overhearing the classes at a Brahmin house nearby. Knowing his thirst for learning an uncle took him to the traditional school conducted by Pettayil Raman Pillai Asan, a renowned scholar and writer who taught him without any fee. It was there that he earned the name Chattampi on account of his assignment as the monitor of the class.<ref name=\"Raman\">[[#Nair|Raman Nair]], pp. 44, 48</ref>\n\n==J\u00f1\u0101napraj\u0101garam==\n\nIn the 1870s Raman Pillai started a scholarly group named 'J\u00f1\u0101napraj\u0101garam' with experts on different subjects with progressive attitude. It served as a meeting place for many scholars of that time and facilitated Kunjan to acquaint himself with many great men. He also could learn Tamil from Swaminatha Desikar and philosophy from Professor Manonmaniyam Sundaram Pillai during his participation in 'Jnanaprajagaram'. Kunjan Pillai was introduced into the science of [[yoga]] by the [[Ayyavu Swamikal|Thycaud Ayyavu Swamikal]]<ref>Ayyavu Mission (1997). ''Brahmasree Thycaud Ayyavu Swami''. Trivandrum.</ref> a scholar and yogi who used to give lectures at 'Jnanaprajagaram'. While so a wandering sadhu who came to his village temple initiated him into spiritual world by giving the Balasubramanya Mantra. Mastering this mantra gave him a new vigour and zeal and he assumed the name Shanmukhadasa due to his deep devotion of [[Murugan|Subramanya]].\n\n==Ordinary days==\nAs the burden of supporting the family fell on him, Kunjan Pillai took to many manual works. For many days he served as a labourer carrying building materials for the construction of Government Secretariat building in Trivandrum. For some time he worked as a document writer and also as an advocate's clerk. He stood first in a test for clerical posts in Government Secretariat [[Thiruvananthapuram|Trivandrum]] conducted by Sir T Madhava Rao the then Divan of Travancore State. But he left the service after a short while as it curtailed his freedom and prevented his wanderings for spiritual exploitations and research.<ref>[[#Nair|Raman Nair]], p. 59</ref>\n\n==Meets Subba Jatapadikal==\n\nIn one of the Philosophical Conferences organised annually by the Travancore Kings at the Palace complex adjacent to Sree Padmanabha Swami Temple Kunjan Pillai met Subba Jatapadikal from Kalladaikurichin in Southern [[Tamil Nadu]]; a renowned teacher well versed in Tarka, Vyakarana, Mimasa, and Vedanta.<ref>[[#Nair|Raman Nair]], p. 71</ref> Both were impressed by the other and Kunjan's wish to learn at Kalladaikurichin under him was granted.\n\nHe spent many years learning under Subba Jatapadikal.  There he acquired deep and extensive mastery of all sastras in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Sanskrit]]. He also learned Siddha medicine, music, and martial arts. During this period he was greatly influenced by the works of Kodakanallur Sundara Swamikal a great Advaitin. He later translated his work Nijananda Vilasam containing the cream of Vedanta into simple Malayalam to guide spiritual aspirants.\n\n==Study of other religions==\nAfter completing his studies under Subba Jatapadikal he spent long periods of learning under a Christian priest. In a secluded church in Southern Tamil Nadu assisting the priest he learned Christian meditation and learned Christian Religion and philosophy. Later he lived with an old Muslim well versed in Qur'an and [[Sufism|Sufi]] mysticism who taught him the main tenet of Islam. Kunjan acquired proficiency reading Qur'an in the traditional way. Leaving him he wandered for months with many avadutas in Southern Tamil Nadu and also travelled all over India. These days revealed to him that the basic concepts of all religions are the same.<ref>[[#Nair|Raman Nair]], pp. 78\u201379</ref>\n\n==Self-realisation==\nAt the end of his wanderings and quest Kunjan Pillai was led to self-realisation by an avaduta whom he met at a wayside in Vadaveeswaram a village in Tamil Nadu with whom he lived for many months in the forests without any contact with the outside world.<ref>[[#Nair|Raman Nair]], p. 91</ref> It is believed that this avaduta belonged to the line of immortal masters of Southern India; the [[siddhar|Siddhas]] who knew the scientific art for realising God. He returned to Kerala as a great scholar and saint.<ref>Sukumaran Nair, G (2000) ''Chattampi Swamikal'' (Navakerala Silpikal Series).

Advaita Philosophy of Chattampi Swamikal. Kanyakumari, Ayya Vaikunta Nathar Siddhalayam. p. 25</ref> In 1882, at the Aniyoor Temple near Vamanapuram, Swamikal met Nanu Asan, later known as Narayana Guru. Asan was three years younger than Swamikal and in search of spiritual guidance. By then Swamikal was well-versed in yoga and spiritual matters and their meeting proved to be the start of a profound and cherished companionship, although the two were of different temperaments<ref>Nataraja Guru (1980). ''Word of the Guru''. Cochin, Paico. p. 259</ref> In those days Nanu Asan was a soft-spoken introvert and Swamikal was an outspoken extrovert. They lived and travelled for many months together. Swami introduced Asan to all arts and sciences he had mastered and also gave him the Balasubrahmanya mantra. These were the formative years of Asan, who later became a social reformer. Later Swamikal took Asan to his guru, [[Ayyavu Swamikal]].<ref>Maheswaran Nair, K (2016). ''Sree Narayana Guru''. Kottayam, Sahithya Prvarthaka Sahakarana Sangham. pp. 104\u2013105.</ref> After completing Asan's studies under Ayyavu Swamikal the men left him and wandered together in southern Tamil Nadu where they met many scholars. Narayana Guru practised austere Jnana and Yoga under Swamikal during this period.<ref>Poulose, C (2002). ''Advaita Philosophy of Chattampi Swamikal''. Kanyakumari, Ayya Vaikunta Nathar Siddhalayam. p. 26</ref> It was with Chattampi Swamikal that Asan made his first trip to Maruthuvamalai, and later to Aruvippuram, which was chosen as his abode for meditation and spiritual activities and which was where he was led to self-realisation. It was after this that he was known as Narayana Guru. Swamikal did not stay there for long, although the two maintained a lifelong contact, respect and regard for each other.<ref>[[#Nair|Raman Nair]], p. 145</ref>The poem Narayana Guru composed when he came to know of Swami's samadhi was the only offering he gave to any person and it reveals how he considered Swamikal to be a realised soul.<ref>Bhaskaran, T (1985) ''Narayana Guru.

Contribution of Chattampi Swamikal to Advaitha Philosophy: A Study with Special Reference to Advaithachinthapaddhathi (PhD Theses). Kannur, Kerala: Kannur University</ref> written in simple language to enable ordinary people without knowledge of Sanskrit to learn Vedanta.

The ''Christumatha Saram'' is his summary of what Christianity is, in accordance with the classical Indian [[Purva paksha]] tradition. In ''Christumatha Chedanam'', he criticises various tenets of Christianity which goes against the teachings of Christ. Relying on the Bible itself he disapproves the arguments supporting conversion presented by the missionaries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chattampi Swamikal (1995).

Convictions of common origin and belief in a common ancestry were indispensable for the development of a collective mindset. Swami explored the roots of Kerala society and original inhabitants, and sociologically and genealogically connected most of the present groups in Kerala including the priestly class to common ancestors who were the original inhabitants known as the Nakas. B. Hrdaya Kumari says that ''Pracheena Malayalam'' is not only a good example of Swamikal's logical arguments but is the earliest example of application of hypothesis and fixed methodology for historical studies.<ref>Hridaya Kumari, B (2002).

His thoughts and work influenced the launching of many social, religious, literary and political organisations and movements in Kerala and for the first time gave voice to those who were marginalised.\n\nChattampi Swamikal denounced the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] interpretation of Hindu texts citing sources from the [[Vedas]]. Swamikal along with his contemporary, [[Narayana Guru]], strived to reform the heavily [[ritualistic]] and caste-ridden Hindu society of the late 19th century [[Kerala]]. Swamikal also worked for the emancipation of women and encouraged them to come to the forefront of society. Swamikal promoted [[vegetarianism]] and professed non-violence ([[Ahimsa]]). Swamikal believed that the different religions are different paths leading to the same place. Chattampi Swamikal throughout his intellectually and spiritually enriched life maintained many friends from different regions of Kerala. He authored several books on spirituality, history, and language staying with these friends.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Statue of chattampi swamikal at attukal temple DSC 8709.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Chattampi Swamikal at Attukal temple]]\nChattampi Swami was born on 25 August 1853 at Kollur in southern [[Travancore]]. His father was Thamarassery Vasudeva Sharma, a [[Nambudiri]] [[Brahmin]] from Mavelikkara, and his mother was Nangamma Pillai, a [[Nair]] from Kannammoola. He was formally named Ayyappan but was called by the pet name of Kunjan Pillai \u2013 meaning \"small male baby\" \u2013 by all. As his parents were not able to provide him formal education, he learned letters and words from children of his neighbourhood who attended schools. Also he learned Sanskrit by overhearing the classes at a Brahmin house nearby. Knowing his thirst for learning an uncle took him to the traditional school conducted by Pettayil Raman Pillai Asan, a renowned scholar and writer who taught him without any fee. It was there that he earned the name Chattampi on account of his assignment as the monitor of the class.<ref name=\"Raman\">[[#Nair|Raman Nair]], pp. 44, 48</ref>\n\n==J\u00f1\u0101napraj\u0101garam==\n\nIn the 1870s Raman Pillai started a scholarly group named 'J\u00f1\u0101napraj\u0101garam' with experts on different subjects with progressive attitude. It served as a meeting place for many scholars of that time and facilitated Kunjan to acquaint himself with many great men. He also could learn Tamil from Swaminatha Desikar and philosophy from Professor Manonmaniyam Sundaram Pillai during his participation in 'Jnanaprajagaram'. Kunjan Pillai was introduced into the science of [[yoga]] by the [[Ayyavu Swamikal|Thycaud Ayyavu Swamikal]]<ref>Ayyavu Mission (1997). ''Brahmasree Thycaud Ayyavu Swami''. Trivandrum.</ref> a scholar and yogi who used to give lectures at 'Jnanaprajagaram'. While so a wandering sadhu who came to his village temple initiated him into spiritual world by giving the Balasubramanya Mantra. Mastering this mantra gave him a new vigour and zeal and he assumed the name Shanmukhadasa due to his deep devotion of [[Murugan|Subramanya]].\n\n==Ordinary days==\nAs the burden of supporting the family fell on him, Kunjan Pillai took to many manual works. For many days he served as a labourer carrying building materials for the construction of Government Secretariat building in Trivandrum. For some time he worked as a document writer and also as an advocate's clerk. He stood first in a test for clerical posts in Government Secretariat [[Thiruvananthapuram|Trivandrum]] conducted by Sir T Madhava Rao the then Divan of Travancore State. But he left the service after a short while as it curtailed his freedom and prevented his wanderings for spiritual exploitations and research.<ref>[[#Nair|Raman Nair]], p. 59</ref>\n\n==Meets Subba Jatapadikal==\n\nIn one of the Philosophical Conferences organised annually by the Travancore Kings at the Palace complex adjacent to Sree Padmanabha Swami Temple Kunjan Pillai met Subba Jatapadikal from Kalladaikurichin in Southern [[Tamil Nadu]]; a renowned teacher well versed in Tarka, Vyakarana, Mimasa, and Vedanta.<ref>[[#Nair|Raman Nair]], p. 71</ref> Both were impressed by the other and Kunjan's wish to learn at Kalladaikurichin under him was granted.\n\nHe spent many years learning under Subba Jatapadikal.  There he acquired deep and extensive mastery of all sastras in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Sanskrit]]. He also learned Siddha medicine, music, and martial arts. During this period he was greatly influenced by the works of Kodakanallur Sundara Swamikal a great Advaitin. He later translated his work Nijananda Vilasam containing the cream of Vedanta into simple Malayalam to guide spiritual aspirants.\n\n==Study of other religions==\nAfter completing his studies under Subba Jatapadikal he spent long periods of learning under a Christian priest. In a secluded church in Southern Tamil Nadu assisting the priest he learned Christian meditation and learned Christian Religion and philosophy. Later he lived with an old Muslim well versed in Qur'an and [[Sufism|Sufi]] mysticism who taught him the main tenet of Islam. Kunjan acquired proficiency reading Qur'an in the traditional way. Leaving him he wandered for months with many avadutas in Southern Tamil Nadu and also travelled all over India. These days revealed to him that the basic concepts of all religions are the same.<ref>[[#Nair|Raman Nair]], pp. 78\u201379</ref>\n\n==Self-realisation==\nAt the end of his wanderings and quest Kunjan Pillai was led to self-realisation by an avaduta whom he met at a wayside in Vadaveeswaram a village in Tamil Nadu with whom he lived for many months in the forests without any contact with the outside world.<ref>[[#Nair|Raman Nair]], p. 91</ref> It is believed that this avaduta belonged to the line of immortal masters of Southern India; the [[siddhar|Siddhas]] who knew the scientific art for realising God. He returned to Kerala as a great scholar and saint.<ref>Sukumaran Nair, G (2000) ''Chattampi Swamikal'' (Navakerala Silpikal Series).

Advaita Philosophy of Chattampi Swamikal. Kanyakumari, Ayya Vaikunta Nathar Siddhalayam. p. 25</ref> In 1882, at the Aniyoor Temple near Vamanapuram, Swamikal met Nanu Asan, later known as Narayana Guru. Asan was three years younger than Swamikal and in search of spiritual guidance. By then Swamikal was well-versed in yoga and spiritual matters and their meeting proved to be the start of a profound and cherished companionship, although the two were of different temperaments<ref>Nataraja Guru (1980). ''Word of the Guru''. Cochin, Paico. p. 259</ref> In those days Nanu Asan was a soft-spoken introvert and Swamikal was an outspoken extrovert. They lived and travelled for many months together. Swami introduced Asan to all arts and sciences he had mastered and also gave him the Balasubrahmanya mantra. These were the formative years of Asan, who later became a social reformer. Later Swamikal took Asan to his guru, [[Ayyavu Swamikal]].<ref>Maheswaran Nair, K (2016). ''Sree Narayana Guru''. Kottayam, Sahithya Prvarthaka Sahakarana Sangham. pp. 104\u2013105.</ref> After completing Asan's studies under Ayyavu Swamikal the men left him and wandered together in southern Tamil Nadu where they met many scholars. Narayana Guru practised austere Jnana and Yoga under Swamikal during this period.<ref>Poulose, C (2002). ''Advaita Philosophy of Chattampi Swamikal''. Kanyakumari, Ayya Vaikunta Nathar Siddhalayam. p. 26</ref> It was with Chattampi Swamikal that Asan made his first trip to Maruthuvamalai, and later to Aruvippuram, which was chosen as his abode for meditation and spiritual activities and which was where he was led to self-realisation. It was after this that he was known as Narayana Guru. Swamikal did not stay there for long, although the two maintained a lifelong contact, respect and regard for each other.<ref>[[#Nair|Raman Nair]], p. 145</ref>The poem Narayana Guru composed when he came to know of Swami's samadhi was the only offering he gave to any person and it reveals how he considered Swamikal to be a realised soul.<ref>Bhaskaran, T (1985) ''Narayana Guru.

Notable among them is ''Advaita Chinthapaddhathi'' (1949), an introductory manual on practical Advaita.<ref> Vijayalaksmi, K V (2011). Contribution of Chattampi Swamikal to Advaitha Philosophy: A Study with Special Reference to Advaithachinthapaddhathi (PhD Theses). Kannur, Kerala: Kannur University</ref> written in simple language to enable ordinary people without knowledge of Sanskrit to learn Vedanta. The book describes the trigunas, trimurthees, jivatmas,  panchabutas, sukshma, sthula, sarirotpatti, dasagunas, prapancholpatti, Tatvamasi, and related Vedic concepts.<ref> Vidyanandha Theerthapada Swamikal (1974). Forward to Advaitha  Chinthapaddhathi of Chattampi Swamikal (Malayalam). Vazhur, Kerala: Theerthapadha Ashram</ref>\n\n===Works on Christianity===\n''Christumatha Nirupanam'' contains two books \u2013 the ''Christumatha Saram'' (meaning Cream of Christianity) and ''Christumatha Nirupanam''. The ''Christumatha Saram'' is his summary of what Christianity is, in accordance with the classical Indian [[Purva paksha]] tradition. In ''Christumatha Chedanam'', he criticises various tenets of Christianity which goes against the teachings of Christ. Relying on the Bible itself he disapproves the arguments supporting conversion presented by the missionaries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chattampi Swamikal (1995). Christhumatha Chedhanam|url= https://archive.org/stream/KristumataChedanamChattampiSwamikalEnglishTranslation/Kristumata%20Chedanam%20-%20Chattampi%20Swamikal%20-%20English%20Translation#page/n147/mode/2up}}</ref>\n\n===Research methods===\n''Pracheena Malayalam'' also aimed at awakening the mind of the people of the region divided by various complexes to a collective sense of 'We'. Convictions of common origin and belief in a common ancestry were indispensable for the development of a collective mindset. Swami explored the roots of Kerala society and original inhabitants, and sociologically and genealogically connected most of the present groups in Kerala including the priestly class to common ancestors who were the original inhabitants known as the Nakas. B. Hrdaya Kumari says that ''Pracheena Malayalam'' is not only a good example of Swamikal's logical arguments but is the earliest example of application of hypothesis and fixed methodology for historical studies.<ref>Hridaya Kumari, B (2002). ''Chila Keraleeya Navodhana Pravanathakal''. Bhashaposhini, pp. 16\u201323</ref>\n\n===Women\u2019s rights===\nSwamikal also worked for the emancipation of women and encouraged them to come to the forefront of society. He stated that ancient religion and law in India gave equal status to women and that their role is very important in family and society.<ref>Chattampi Swami (1953). ''Prapanchathil Stree Purushanmarkulla Sthanam'' (The position of women and men in the universe). Quilon, Sadabdha Smaraka Grantham. p. 154</ref> He stated that it was the misinterpretation of ancient texts resulting from male arrogance that degraded the position of women and their enslavement.{{cn|date=May 2018}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\nLeelaprabhu-Dr. Sudheer Kidangur\n\n==Cited sources==\n*{{cite book|ref=Nair |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=K-JRfipEdV0C&pg=PA44 |first1=R  |last1=Raman Nair |first2=L |last2=Sulochana Devi |year=2010 |title=Chattampi Swami: An Intellectual Biography |publisher= Chattampi Swami Archive, Centre for South Indian Studies|isbn=9788190592826}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* {{cite book\n | title = Parama Bhattara Chattampi Swami Tiruvatikal(Malayalam)\n | author = Gopala Pillai, Paravoor K\n | year = 2010\n | isbn =  | publisher = Current Books\n | location = Thrissur, Kerala\n  }}\n\n* {{cite book\n | title = Chattampi Swamikal: Jeevithavum Krithikalum\n | author = Maheswaran Nair, K\n | year = 1995\n | isbn =  | publisher = Dhuma Books\n | location = Trivandrum\n  }}\n\n* {{cite book\n | title = Chattampi Swamikal: The Great Scholar saint of Kerala\n | author = Karunakara Menon, K P\n | year = 1967\n | isbn =  | publisher = PG Narayana Pillai\n | location = Trivandrum\n  }}\n\n\n\n* {{cite book\n | title = Sree Chattampi Swamikalu (Kannada)\n | author = Narayana Moodithaya\n | year = 2008\n | isbn =  | publisher = Kasaragodu Prakasana\n | location = Kasaragod, India\n  }}\n\n* {{cite book\n | title = Advaita Philosophy of Brahmasree Chattampi Swamikal\n | author = Poulose, C\n | year = 2002\n | isbn =  | publisher = Ayya Vaikunta nathar Siddhasramam\n | location = Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu\n  }}\n\n* {{cite book\n  | title = Sree Vidyadhiraja Chattampi Swamikalude Jeevacharithravum Pradana Krithikalum\n | author = Prajnananda Theerthapada Swami, Ed and Comp.\n | year = 2011\n | isbn =  | publisher = Sree Theerthapadasramam\n | location = Vazhoor, Kottayam, Kerala\n  }}\n\n* {{cite book\n | title = Chattampi Swamikal: Oru Dhyshanika Jeevacharithram (Malayalam)\n | author = Raman Nair, R and Sulochana Devi, L\n | year = 2016\n | isbn =  | publisher = Chattampi Swami Archivr, Centre for South Indian Studies\n | location = Trivandrum\n  }}\n\n* {{cite book\n | title = Vidyadhiraja Chattampi Swamikal\n | author = Santhkumari Amma, Kumbalath\n | year = 2003\n | isbn =  | publisher = Dept of Cultural Publications, Govt of Kerala\n | location = Trivandrum, Kerala\n  }}\n\n* {{cite book\n | title = Contribution of Chattampi Swamikal to Advaitha Philosophy: A Study with Special Reference to Advaithachinthapaddhathi (PhD Theses)\n | author = Vijayalaksmi, K V\n | year = 2011\n | isbn =  | publisher = Kannur University\n | location = Kannur, Kerala\n  }}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.panmanaashram.com/default.aspx Panmana Ashram]\n*[http://chattampiswami.com/ Parama Bhattara Vidyadhiraja Chattampi Swamikal]\n*[http://csarchive.in/ Chattampi Swami Archive]\n{{commons category-inline}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Swamikal, Chattampi}}\n[[Category:1853 births]]\n[[Category:1925 deaths]]\n[[Category:Indian Hindu religious leaders]]\n[[Category:Indian social reformers]]\n[[Category:Writers from Thiruvananthapuram]]\n[[Category:Advaitin philosophers]]\n[[Category:Hindu philosophers]]\n[[Category:Vedanta]]\n[[Category:Malayali people]]\n[[Category:19th-century Hindu religious leaders]]\n[[Category:20th-century Hindu religious leaders]]\n[[Category:Malayalam-language writers]]\n", "name_user": "Ayathanalok", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattampi_Swamikal"}

The two chief seats of Nanna's/S\u012bn's worship were [[Ur]] in the south of Mesopotamia and [[Harran]] in the north. A moon god by the same name was also worshipped in [[ancient history of Yemen|South Arabia]].\n\n== Name ==\nThe original meaning of the name ''Nanna'' is unknown. The earliest spelling found in Ur and [[Uruk]] is <sup>[[DINGIR|D]]</sup>[[Liste der archaischen Keilschriftzeichen|LAK]]-32.NA (where NA is to be understood as a [[phonetic complement]]). The name of Ur, spelled (cuneiform: \ud808\udec0\ud808\udc15\ud808\udda0) LAK-32.UNUG<sup>KI</sup>=URIM<sub>2</sub><sup>KI</sup>, is itself derived from the theonym, and means \"the abode (UNUG) of Nanna (LAK-32)\". He was also the father of [[Hadad|Ishkur]].\n\nThe [[Fara period|pre-classical]] sign LAK-32 later collapses with \u0160E\u0160 (the ideogram for \"brother\"), and the classical Sumerian spelling is <sup>D</sup>\u0160E\u0160.KI, with the phonetic reading ''na-an-na''. The technical term for the crescent moon could also refer to the deity, (cuneiform: \ud808\udc2d\ud808\udf13\ud808\udeac <sup>D</sup>U<sub>4</sub>.SAKAR). Later, the name is spelled logographically as <sup>D</sup>NANNA.\n\nThe Semitic moon god Su'en/Sin is in origin a separate deity from Sumerian Nanna, but from the [[Akkadian Empire]] period the two undergo syncretization and are identified. The occasional [[Assyria]]n spelling of <sup>D</sup>NANNA-''ar'' <sup>D</sup>''Su'en-e'' is due to association with Akkadian ''na-an-na-ru'' \"illuminator, lamp\", an epitheton of the moon god. The name of the Assyrian moon god Su'en''/''S\u00een is usually spelled as <sup>D</sup>EN.ZU, or simply with the numeral [[30 (number)|30]], (cuneiform: \ud808\udc2d\ud808\udf0d <sup>D</sup>XXX).<ref>''[[Reallexikon der Assyriologie]]'', 1997, {{ISBN|978-3-11-014809-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=O1yFrzi-MgYC&pg=RA2-PA360 p.360]</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n{{Pre-Islamic Arabian deities}}\nHe is commonly designated as ''En-zu'', which means \"lord of wisdom\".

The \"wisdom\" personified by the moon-god is likewise an expression of the science of astronomy or the practice of [[astrology]], in which the observation of the moon's phases is an important factor.\n\nHis wife was [[Ningal]] (\"Great Lady\"), who bore him [[Utu]]/[[Shamash]] (\"Sun\") and [[Inanna]]/[[Ishtar]] (the goddess of the planet [[Venus]]). The tendency to centralize the powers of the universe leads to the establishment of the doctrine of a triad consisting of Sin/Nanna and his children.\n\nSin had a beard made of [[lapis lazuli]] and rode on a winged [[bull]]. The bull was one of his symbols, through his father, [[Enlil]], \"Bull of Heaven\", along with the crescent and the tripod (which may be a lamp-stand). On [[cylinder seal]]s, he is represented as an old man with a flowing beard and the crescent symbol. In the astral-theological system he is represented by the number 30 and the moon.
