The centrosome replicates during the [[S phase]] of the cell cycle. During the [[prophase]] in the process of cell division called [[mitosis]], the centrosomes migrate to opposite poles of the cell. The mitotic spindle then forms between the two centrosomes. Upon division, each daughter cell receives one centrosome. Aberrant numbers of centrosomes in a cell have been associated with [[cancer]].

Cells without centrosomes lack radial arrays of [[astral microtubules]]. They are also defective in spindle positioning and in the ability to establish a central localization site in cytokinesis. The function of centrosome in this context is hypothesized to ensure the fidelity of [[cell division]] because it greatly increases the efficacy. Some cell types  arrest in the following cell cycle when centrosomes are absent. This is not a universal phenomenon.\n\nWhen the nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' egg is fertilized the sperm delivers a pair of centrioles. These centrioles will form the centrosomes which will direct the first cell division of the [[zygote]] and this will determine its polarity.

The centrosome replicates during the [[S phase]] of the cell cycle. During the [[prophase]] in the process of cell division called [[mitosis]], the centrosomes migrate to opposite poles of the cell. The mitotic spindle then forms between the two centrosomes. Upon division, each daughter cell receives one centrosome. Aberrant numbers of centrosomes in a cell have been associated with [[cancer]].

Cells without centrosomes lack radial arrays of [[astral microtubules]]. They are also defective in spindle positioning and in the ability to establish a central localization site in cytokinesis. The function of centrosome in this context is hypothesized to ensure the fidelity of [[cell division]] because it greatly increases the efficacy. Some cell types  arrest in the following cell cycle when centrosomes are absent.

It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive [[metal]]. Sodium is an [[alkali metal]], being in [[group 1 element|group 1]] of the periodic table, because it has a single electron in its outer shell, which it readily donates, creating a positively charged ion\u2014the Na<sup>+</sup> [[cation]]. Its only stable [[isotope]] is <sup>23</sup>Na. The free metal does not occur in nature, and must be prepared from compounds. Sodium is the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust]] and exists in numerous [[minerals]] such as [[feldspar]]s, [[sodalite]], and [[halite|rock salt]] (NaCl). Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble: sodium ions have been [[Leaching (chemistry)|leached]] by the action of water from the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[mineral]]s over eons, and thus sodium and [[chlorine]] are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans.\n\nSodium was first isolated by [[Humphry Davy]] in 1807 by the [[electrolysis]] of [[sodium hydroxide]]. Among many other useful sodium compounds, [[sodium hydroxide]] ([[lye]]) is used in [[Soap|soap manufacture]], and [[sodium chloride]] ([[edible salt]]) is a [[De-ice|de-icing]] agent and a nutrient for animals including humans.\n\nSodium is an [[Dietary mineral|essential element]] for all animals and some plants. Sodium ions are the major cation in the [[extracellular fluid]] (ECF) and as such are the major contributor to the ECF [[osmotic pressure]] and ECF compartment volume. Loss of water from the ECF compartment increases the sodium concentration, a condition called [[hypernatremia]]. [[Tonicity|Isotonic]] loss of water and sodium from the ECF compartment decreases the size of that compartment in a condition called ECF [[hypovolemia]].\n\nBy means of the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|sodium-potassium pump]], living human cells pump three sodium ions out of the cell in exchange for two potassium ions pumped in; comparing ion concentrations across the cell membrane, inside to outside, [[potassium]] measures about 40:1, and sodium, about 1:10. In [[Neuron|nerve cells]], the electrical charge across the cell membrane enables transmission of the nerve impulse\u2014an [[action potential]]\u2014when the charge is dissipated; sodium plays a key role in that activity.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\n===Physical===\n[[File:Na-D-sodium D-lines-589nm.jpg|thumb|left|[[Emission spectrum]] for sodium, showing the [[Fraunhofer lines|D line]].]]\nSodium at [[standard temperature and pressure]] is a soft silvery metal that combines with oxygen in the air and forms grayish white [[sodium oxide]] unless immersed in oil or inert gas, which are the conditions it is usually stored in. Sodium metal can be easily cut with a knife and is a good conductor of electricity and heat because it has only one electron in its valence shell, resulting in weak [[metallic bonding]] and free electrons, which carry energy. Due to having low atomic mass and large atomic radius, sodium is third-least dense of all elemental metals and is one of only three metals that can float on water, the other two being lithium and potassium.<ref name=Greenwood75>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 75</ref> The melting (98&nbsp;\u00b0C) and boiling (883&nbsp;\u00b0C) points of sodium are lower than those of lithium but higher than those of the heavier alkali metals potassium, rubidium, and caesium, following periodic trends down the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/chemistry/compounds-and-elements/alkali-metals|title=\"Alkali Metals.\" Science of Everyday Things|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> These properties change dramatically at elevated pressures: at 1.5 [[Bar (unit)|Mbar]], the color changes from silvery metallic to black; at 1.9 Mbar the material becomes transparent with a red color; and at 3 Mbar, sodium is a clear and transparent solid.

It is found in many minerals, some very soluble, such as [[halite]] and [[natron]], others much less soluble, such as [[amphibole]] and [[zeolite]]. The insolubility of certain sodium minerals such as [[cryolite]] and [[feldspar]] arises from their polymeric anions, which in the case of feldspar is a polysilicate.\n\n===Astronomical observations===\nAtomic sodium has a very strong [[spectral line]] in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum (the same line as is used in [[Sodium-vapor lamp|sodium vapour street lights]]). This appears as an [[absorption line]] in many types of stars, including the [[Sun]]. The line was first studied in 1814 by [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] during his investigation of the lines in the solar spectrum, now known as the [[Fraunhofer lines]].

In stars, it is seen in any whose surfaces are cool enough for sodium to exist in atomic form (rather than ionised). This corresponds to stars of roughly [[F-type main sequence star|F-type]] and cooler. Many other stars appear to have a sodium absorption line, but this is actually caused by gas in the foreground [[interstellar medium]].

It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive [[metal]]. Sodium is an [[alkali metal]], being in [[group 1 element|group 1]] of the periodic table, because it has a single electron in its outer shell, which it readily donates, creating a positively charged ion\u2014the Na<sup>+</sup> [[cation]]. Its only stable [[isotope]] is <sup>23</sup>Na. The free metal does not occur in nature, and must be prepared from compounds. Sodium is the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust]] and exists in numerous [[minerals]] such as [[feldspar]]s, [[sodalite]], and [[halite|rock salt]] (NaCl). Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble: sodium ions have been [[Leaching (chemistry)|leached]] by the action of water from the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[mineral]]s over eons, and thus sodium and [[chlorine]] are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans.\n\nSodium was first isolated by [[Humphry Davy]] in 1807 by the [[electrolysis]] of [[sodium hydroxide]]. Among many other useful sodium compounds, [[sodium hydroxide]] ([[lye]]) is used in [[Soap|soap manufacture]], and [[sodium chloride]] ([[edible salt]]) is a [[De-ice|de-icing]] agent and a nutrient for animals including humans.\n\nSodium is an [[Dietary mineral|essential element]] for all animals and some plants. Sodium ions are the major cation in the [[extracellular fluid]] (ECF) and as such are the major contributor to the ECF [[osmotic pressure]] and ECF compartment volume. Loss of water from the ECF compartment increases the sodium concentration, a condition called [[hypernatremia]]. [[Tonicity|Isotonic]] loss of water and sodium from the ECF compartment decreases the size of that compartment in a condition called ECF [[hypovolemia]].\n\nBy means of the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|sodium-potassium pump]], living human cells pump three sodium ions out of the cell in exchange for two potassium ions pumped in; comparing ion concentrations across the cell membrane, inside to outside, [[potassium]] measures about 40:1, and sodium, about 1:10. In [[Neuron|nerve cells]], the electrical charge across the cell membrane enables transmission of the nerve impulse\u2014an [[action potential]]\u2014when the charge is dissipated; sodium plays a key role in that activity.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\n===Physical===\n[[File:Na-D-sodium D-lines-589nm.jpg|thumb|left|[[Emission spectrum]] for sodium, showing the [[Fraunhofer lines|D line]].]]\nSodium at [[standard temperature and pressure]] is a soft silvery metal that combines with oxygen in the air and forms grayish white [[sodium oxide]] unless immersed in oil or inert gas, which are the conditions it is usually stored in. Sodium metal can be easily cut with a knife and is a good conductor of electricity and heat because it has only one electron in its valence shell, resulting in weak [[metallic bonding]] and free electrons, which carry energy. Due to having low atomic mass and large atomic radius, sodium is third-least dense of all elemental metals and is one of only three metals that can float on water, the other two being lithium and potassium.<ref name=Greenwood75>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 75</ref> The melting (98&nbsp;\u00b0C) and boiling (883&nbsp;\u00b0C) points of sodium are lower than those of lithium but higher than those of the heavier alkali metals potassium, rubidium, and caesium, following periodic trends down the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/chemistry/compounds-and-elements/alkali-metals|title=\"Alkali Metals.\" Science of Everyday Things|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> These properties change dramatically at elevated pressures: at 1.5 [[Bar (unit)|Mbar]], the color changes from silvery metallic to black; at 1.9 Mbar the material becomes transparent with a red color; and at 3 Mbar, sodium is a clear and transparent solid.

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech may also be introduced using special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=54 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the vantage point of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''\"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d'' versus ''\"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=55-64 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=12-13 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref>\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn spoken language, there are several ways to present a quotation. For example, the speaker may begin with a lead-in that relates a quotation to the topic currently being discussed, which may be followed by supplementary information on the person to be quoted, and finally the quotation itself.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McArthur |first1=Tom |last2=Lam-McArthur |first2=Jacqueline |last3=Fontaine |first3=Lisa |title=The Oxford Companion to the English Language$ The Oxford Companion to the English Language (2 ed.) |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191744389 |edition=2nd}}</ref> The quotation is introduced by a quotative marker.\n\n====Quotative markers====\n===== English =====\nIn English, the verb ''\"be like\"'' or ''\"said\"'' are being used as quotatives in American English. <ref> Frederica Barbieri.

The verb is usually a verb of communication or thought. In spoken Japanese, the use of pronouns and honorific form are commonly seen; yet, honorific form is not an evidence between direct and indirect speech. Thus, Japanese fails to distinguish between direct and indirect speech as shown in the above examples.\n<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\n====Nested quotations====\n====Crosslinguistic variations====\n\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame the quoter's own opinions.<ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69-98 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327?via%3Dihub | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are used to express reported speech, thoughts, or perceptions. <ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are markers equivalent to full verbs with meanings ''say, speak, mention, tell, etc.''\n<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5-25 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u660e\u65e5 !! \u6674\u308c\u308b !! -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u660e\u65e5 !! \u6674\u308c\u308b !! -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 !! \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000!!\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative evidentials=====\nQuotative evidentials provide knowledge of who or where information originated from in speech.

In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=54 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the vantage point of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''\"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d'' versus ''\"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=55-64 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |pages=12-13 |edition=1st ed.}}</ref>\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn spoken language, there are several ways to present a quotation. For example, the speaker may begin with a lead-in that relates a quotation to the topic currently being discussed, which may be followed by supplementary information on the person to be quoted, and finally the quotation itself.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McArthur |first1=Tom |last2=Lam-McArthur |first2=Jacqueline |last3=Fontaine |first3=Lisa |title=The Oxford Companion to the English Language$ The Oxford Companion to the English Language (2 ed.) |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191744389 |edition=2nd}}</ref> The quotation is introduced by a quotative marker.\n\n====Quotative markers====\n===== English =====\nIn English, the verb ''\"be like\"'' or ''\"said\"'' are being used as quotatives in American English. <ref> Frederica Barbieri.

The verb is usually a verb of communication or thought. In spoken Japanese, the use of pronouns and honorific form are commonly seen; yet, honorific form is not an evidence between direct and indirect speech. Thus, Japanese fails to distinguish between direct and indirect speech as shown in the above examples.\n<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\n====Nested quotations====\n====Crosslinguistic variations====\n\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame the quoter's own opinions.<ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69-98 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327?via%3Dihub | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are used to express reported speech, thoughts, or perceptions. <ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are markers equivalent to full verbs with meanings ''say, speak, mention, tell, etc.''\n<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5-25 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u660e\u65e5 !! \u6674\u308c\u308b !! -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u660e\u65e5 !! \u6674\u308c\u308b !! -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 !! \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000!!\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative evidentials=====\nQuotative evidentials provide knowledge of who or where information originated from in speech.

However, user can replace them with open source components like e.g. NEMO UI instead Jolla's UI.\n\nAfter Nokia abandoned in 2011 the [[MeeGo]] project, most of the MeeGo team left Nokia, and established Jolla as a company to use MeeGo and [[Mer (software distribution)|Mer]] business opportunities. The MER standard allows it to be launched on any hardware with kernel compatible with MER. In 2012, Linux Sailfish OS based on MeeGo and using middleware of MER core stack distribution was launched for public use. The first device, the [[Jolla (mobile phone)|Jolla smartphone]], was unveiled on May 20, 2013. In 2015, [[Jolla Tablet]] was launched and the [[BRICS]] countries declared it an officially supported OS there. Jolla started licensing Sailfish OS 2.0 for third parties.

It was first discovered as a mysterious code post on GitHub in August 2016, without any official announcement. In contrast to prior Google-developed operating systems such as Chrome OS and Android, which are based on Linux kernels, Fuchsia is based on a new microkernel called \"Zircon\", derived from \"Little Kernel\", a small operating system intended for embedded systems. This allows it to remove [[Linux]] and the copyleft [[GPL]] underwhich the Linux kernel is licensed; Fuchsia is licensed under the [[permissive licenses|permissive]] [[BSD_licenses#3-clause|BSD 3-clause]], [[Apache 2.0]], and [[MIT license]]s. Upon inspection, media outlets noted that the code post on GitHub suggested Fuchsia's capability to run on universal devices, from embedded systems to smartphones, tablets and personal computers. In May 2017, Fuchsia was updated with a user interface, along with a developer writing that the project was not a for experimental, prompting media speculation about Google's intentions with the operating system, including the possibility of it replacing Android.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Amadeo |first1=Ron |title=Google\u2019s \u201cFuchsia\u201d smartphone OS dumps Linux, has a wild new UI |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/googles-fuchsia-smartphone-os-dumps-linux-has-a-wild-new-ui/ |work=Ars Technica |date=May 8, 2017 |language=en-us}}</ref>\n\n====LiteOS====\n[[LiteOS]] is a lightweight open source real-time operating system which is part of Huawei's \"1+2+1\" Internet of Things solution, which is similar to Google Android Things and Samsung Tizen.

(However, third party mods allow non Pixel smartphones to install Pixel Launcher with Google Now feed integration).\n\n:Current Google Pixel Launcher version list\n* Pixel Launcher \u2013 \"7.1.1\" (based on Android 7.x \"Nougat\")(Initial release)\n* Pixel Launcher \u2013 \"8.1.0\" (based on Android 8.x \"Oreo\")(Minor UI update)\n* Pixel Launcher \u2013 \"9.x.x\" (based on Android 9.x \"Pie\")(Minor UI update)\n* Pixel Launcher \u2013 \"10.x.x\" (based on Android 10.x \"10\")(Moderate UI update that support Theme)\n\n===== Replicant OS =====\n[[Replicant (operating system)|Replicant]] is a custom mobile operating system based on the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] with all proprietary drivers and bloat closed source software removed.\n\n:Current ReplicantOS version list\n* ReplicantOS 2.x (based on Android Froyo/AOSP 2.2.x)\n* ReplicantOS 4.x (based on Android Ice Cream Sandwich/AOSP 4.0.x)\n* ReplicantOS 4.2 (based on Android Jelly Bean/AOSP 4.2.x)\n* ReplicantOS 6.x (based on Android Marshmallow/AOSP 6.0.x)\n\n===== Xperia UI =====\nSony Xperia UI (formerly known as Timescape UI) was the front-end UI that developed by [[Sony Mobile]] (formerly Sony Ericsson) for their [[Sony Xperia]] series that is running [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform. Sony Xperia UI mostly consists of Sony own's application such as Sony Music (formerly known as Walkman Music player), Albums and Video Player. During its time as Timescape UI, the UI was different than the standard Android UI, instead of traditional apps dock on the bottom part, it was located at the four corner of the home screen, while the middle of the screen consist of the widget. However the recent development of UI are closely resemble to those of Stock Android.\n\n:Current Xperia UI version list:\n* Timescape version 1 \u2013 based on Android \"Eclair\" 2.0/2.1, initial release\n* Timescape version 2 \u2013 based on Android \"Gingerbread\" 2.3.x, redesigned UI\n* Xperia UI version 3 \u2013 based on Android \"Gingerbread\" and \"Ice Cream Sandwich\" 2.3.x and 4.0.x, redesigned UI\n* Xperia UI version 4 \u2013 based on Android \"Jelly Bean\" 4.2.x \u2013 4.3.x, redesigned UI\n* Xperia UI version 5 \u2013 based on Android \"KitKat\" 4.4.x, redesigned UI\n* Xperia UI version 6 \u2013 based on Android \"Lollipop\" 5.0.x \u2013 5.1.x, redesigned UI\n* Xperia UI version 7 \u2013 based on Android \"Marshmallow\" 6.x, redesigned UI\n* Xperia UI version 8 \u2013 based on Android \"Nougat\" 7.x, redesigned UI\n* Xperia UI version 9 \u2013 based on Android \"Oreo\" 8.x, redesigned UI\n\n===== ZenUI =====\n[[Asus Zen UI|ZenUI]] is a front-end touch interface developed by [[ASUS]] with partners, featuring a full [[touch user interface]]. ZenUI is used by Asus for its [[Android phone]]s and [[tablet computer]]s, and is not available for licensing by external parties. ZenUI also comes preloaded with Asus-made apps like ZenLink (PC Link, Share Link, Party Link & Remote Link).\n\n:Current ZenUI version list:\n* ZenUI 1.0 \u2013 based on Android \"Jelly Bean\" and \"KitKat\" 4.3.x and 4.4.x, initial release\n* ZenUI 2.0 \u2013 based on Android \"Lollipop\" 5.0.x \u2013 5.1.x, redesigned UI\n* ZenUI 3.0 \u2013 based on Android \"Marshmallow\" 6.x, redesigned UI\n* ZenUI 4.0 \u2013 based on Android \"Nougat\" 7.x, redesigned UI\n* ZenUI 5.0 \u2013 based on Android \"Oreo\" 8.x, redesigned UI\n\n====Chrome OS====\n[[Chrome OS]] is an operating system designed by [[Google]] that is based on the [[Linux kernel]] and uses the [[Google Chrome]] web browser as its principal user interface. As a result, Chrome OS primarily supports [[web application]]s. Google announced the project in July 2009, conceiving it as an operating system in which both applications and user data reside in the [[Cloud computing|cloud]]: hence Chrome OS primarily runs [[web application]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/chromium-os-kernel|title = Kernel Design|date = |accessdate = |website = The Chromium Projects|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nDue to increase of popularity with 2-in-1 PCs, most recent Chromebooks are introduced with touch screen capability, with Android applications starting to become available for the operating system in 2014. And in 2016, access to Android apps in the entire [[Google Play Store]] was introduced on supported Chrome OS devices. With the support of Android applications, there are Chromebook devices that are positioned as tablet based instead of notebooks.\n\nChrome OS is only available pre-installed on hardware from Google manufacturing partners. An [[Open-source software|open source]] equivalent, [[Chromium OS]], can be [[compiled]] from downloaded [[source code]]. Early on, Google provided design goals for Chrome OS, but has not otherwise released a technical description.\n\n====Sailfish OS====\n{{format|date=March 2020}}\n[[Sailfish OS]] is from [[Jolla]]. It is open source with [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) for middleware stack core which comes from MER. Sailfish due to Jolla's business model and due to alliances with various partners and due to intentional design of OS internals, is capable to adopt in several layers third party software including Jolla software e.g. Jolla's UI is [[proprietary software]] (closed source), so such components can be proprietary with many different kinds of licences. However, user can replace them with open source components like e.g. NEMO UI instead Jolla's UI.\n\nAfter Nokia abandoned in 2011 the [[MeeGo]] project, most of the MeeGo team left Nokia, and established Jolla as a company to use MeeGo and [[Mer (software distribution)|Mer]] business opportunities. The MER standard allows it to be launched on any hardware with kernel compatible with MER. In 2012, Linux Sailfish OS based on MeeGo and using middleware of MER core stack distribution was launched for public use. The first device, the [[Jolla (mobile phone)|Jolla smartphone]], was unveiled on May 20, 2013. In 2015, [[Jolla Tablet]] was launched and the [[BRICS]] countries declared it an officially supported OS there. Jolla started licensing Sailfish OS 2.0 for third parties. Some devices sold are updateable to Sailfish 2.0 with no limits.\n\n[[Nemo Mobile]] is a community-driven OS, similar to Sailfish but attempting to replace its proprietary components, such as the user interface.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.merproject.org/wiki/Nemo |title=Nemo | website= Mer Wiki |date= |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ohloh.net/p/nemomobile |title=The Nemo Mobile Open Source Project on Ohloh |publisher=Ohloh.net |date= |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{citation |author=Marko Saukko |title=Porting Nemo Mobile and Mer Project to new Hardware |publisher=[[FOSDEM|FOSDEM 2013]] |url=https://archive.fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/porting_nemo_mobile_and_mer/ |date=February 3, 2013 |accessdate= July 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\nEach Sailfish OS version release is named after a Finnish lake:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Sailfish OS versions and names\n!

It is an open source system (however the SDK was closed source and proprietary) that aims to offer a consistent user experience across devices. Tizen's main components are the Linux kernel and the [[WebKit]] runtime. According to Intel, Tizen \"combines the best of LiMo and MeeGo.\" [[HTML5]] apps are emphasized, with MeeGo encouraging its members to transition to Tizen, stating that the \"future belongs to HTML5-based applications, outside of a relatively small percentage of apps, and we are firmly convinced that our investment needs to shift toward HTML5.\" Tizen will be targeted at a variety of platforms such as handsets, touch pc, smart TVs and in-vehicle entertainment.<ref>[https://www.tizen.org/blogs/dawnfoster/2011/welcome-tizen Welcome to Tizen!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013071516/https://www.tizen.org/blogs/dawnfoster/2011/welcome-tizen |date=October 13, 2011 }}.

It was first discovered as a mysterious code post on GitHub in August 2016, without any official announcement. In contrast to prior Google-developed operating systems such as Chrome OS and Android, which are based on Linux kernels, Fuchsia is based on a new microkernel called \"Zircon\", derived from \"Little Kernel\", a small operating system intended for embedded systems. This allows it to remove [[Linux]] and the copyleft [[GPL]] underwhich the Linux kernel is licensed; Fuchsia is licensed under the [[permissive licenses|permissive]] [[BSD_licenses#3-clause|BSD 3-clause]], [[Apache 2.0]], and [[MIT license]]s. Upon inspection, media outlets noted that the code post on GitHub suggested Fuchsia's capability to run on universal devices, from embedded systems to smartphones, tablets and personal computers. In May 2017, Fuchsia was updated with a user interface, along with a developer writing that the project was not a for experimental, prompting media speculation about Google's intentions with the operating system, including the possibility of it replacing Android.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Amadeo |first1=Ron |title=Google\u2019s \u201cFuchsia\u201d smartphone OS dumps Linux, has a wild new UI |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/googles-fuchsia-smartphone-os-dumps-linux-has-a-wild-new-ui/ |work=Ars Technica |date=May 8, 2017 |language=en-us}}</ref>\n\n====LiteOS====\n[[LiteOS]] is a lightweight open source real-time operating system which is part of Huawei's \"1+2+1\" Internet of Things solution, which is similar to Google Android Things and Samsung Tizen.
