It was launched on 15 September 2014 as the successor to the [[Perodua Viva|Viva]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web | url=http://paultan.org/2014/09/15/perodua-axia-launched/ | title=Perodua Axia launched \u2013 final prices lower than estimated, from RM24,600 to RM44,530 on-the-road | work=paultan.org | accessdate=8 February 2017}}</ref> The car takes over the title of being the most affordable car in Malaysia from the Viva.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://paultan.org/2014/08/19/perodua-axia-first-impressions/ | title=DRIVEN: Perodua Axia, first impressions of the EEV | work=paultan.org | accessdate=14 December 2014}}</ref> The Axia is the first model to d\u00e9but from Perodua's all-new second factory in [[Rawang, Selangor|Rawang]], [[Selangor]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \u2018Axia\u2019, which is pronounced \u2018a-zee-a\u2019 or \u2018A-xia\u2019, is derived from the Greek word \u2018\u0391\u039e\u0399\u0391\u2019 ('''axia)''' which means value. The word Axia also resembles the word [[Asia]] but with the letter \u2018s\u2019 having been replaced by \u2018x\u2019 which represents the number ten, as the Axia is Perodua's tenth model.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia booking opens\"/>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Pre-launch ===\nThe Axia was developed as the successor to the Viva. Perodua chose to license the [[Daihatsu Ayla|Daihatsu Ayla/Toyota Agya]] platform for their Viva Replacement Model (VRM).<ref name=\"Perodua Axia first teaser\"/> The Ayla and Agya duo have been on sale in neighbouring [[Indonesia]] and [[Philippines]] since 2013, but not in [[Malaysia]]. Although the Viva replacement model will be based on the Ayla/Agya platform, Perodua has iterated that the upper body and external elements will be indigenously designed, and the car will not be just a [[Rebadging|rebadged]] model.\n\nOn 26 August 2013, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, [[Najib Razak]] announced that the replacement model to the Viva will launch in 2014 as the cheapest new car on the market.<ref name=\"Perodua Viva replacement early details\"/> The new model will be built at Perodua's all-new RM1.3 billion, 65,000 sq ft second manufacturing plant, located adjacent to the company's original factory in [[Rawang, Selangor|Rawang]], [[Selangor]].<ref name=\"Perodua second factory\"/> Perodua's new factory will mirror Daihatsu Kyushu's factory in terms of work ethics, technology and efficiency.<ref name=\"Perodua second factory 2\"/> Perodua has since announced the construction of a new engine manufacturing factory in Sendayan, [[Negeri Sembilan]] at cost of RM600 million.<ref name=\"Perodua new engine factory\"/>\n\nPerodua showcased the Global Model A Segment Space (GMA) concept at the 2013 Kuala Lumpur International Motor Show in November.<ref name=\"Perodua GMA interior\"/> The GMA previewed the interior design of the Viva Replacement Model (VRM). Perodua also showcased a new engine, the 1.0 litre [[Daihatsu]] [[Toyota KR engine#1KR-DE|1KR-DE]] as a possible candidate for the VRM.<ref name=\"Perodua GMA engine\"/>\n\nOn 11 June 2014, the first spyshots of an undisguised Perodua Axia were leaked online.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mohd Izarul / campromania |url=http://funtasticko.net/panas-adakah-ini-perodua-axia/ |title=PANAS : Adakah ini Perodua AXIA? |publisher=funtasticko.net |date=11 June 2014 |accessdate=6 August 2014 |language=ms}}</ref> Further photos of various pre-launch Perodua Axia units have since been leaked online, but on 6 August 2014, additional photos revealed the final product name was indeed \u2018Perodua Axia\u2019, after months of media speculation.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mohd Izarul / campromania |url=http://funtasticko.net/axia-sah-nama-rasmi-model-kompak-baharu-perodua/ |title=AXIA sah nama rasmi model kompak baharu Perodua! |publisher=funtasticko.net |date=6 August 2014 |accessdate=6 August 2014 |language=ms}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 August 2014, Perodua teased a photo of the Axia on their official [[Facebook]] page.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia first teaser\"/> Three days later, Perodua announced that bookings for the Axia will open on 15 August, with prices starting from RM24,900 along with a five-year warranty, a first for a Perodua model 5 years\n.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia booking opens\"/> The following day, the first official photo from Perodua confirmed the product name \u2018Axia\u2019 along with the tagline \u2018Your Smart Move\u2019.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia 1.0 G\"/> Later that same day, even more extensive official details on the Axia were unveiled.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia 1.0 SE\"/> Perodua released a teaser of the front end of the Axia Standard E and G variants on 19 August 2014.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia Standard face\"/> The more expensive Axia SE and Advance variants sport a more aggressive and sporty exterior, whereas the cheaper Standard E and G trim lines offer a more modest and basic package.\n\nThe tentative pricing and equipment list for the Perodua Axia was leaked online on 14 August 2014.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia specs leaked\"/>\n\nIn the morning of 19 August 2014, Perodua announced that around 3,500 bookings have been made for the Axia in just the five days since 15 August, when bookings were officially opened.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia Bookings\"/> Around 60-70% of the total bookings were made for the mid-range Axia Standard G model, whereas around 13% accounted for the base model, the Axia Standard E, and the remaining 17-27% made up the more expensive Axia SE and range-topping Axia Advance models.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia Bookings\"/> Additionally, Perodua maintained that production of the now seven-year-old [[Perodua Viva|Viva]] will continue for as long as the demand persists. However, production of the no-frills Viva 660 and high-end Viva 1.0 and Elite is expected to cease nonetheless, with just the mid-range Viva 850 remaining in production.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia Bookings\"/> Perodua also claimed that the all-new Axia will have 95% locally sourced content, with the remainder being imported from [[Indonesia]] and [[Japan]]. Despite having the vast majority of parts and components locally sourced, Perodua will still have to pay royalties to [[Toyota]] and [[Daihatsu]] for the licensing of their platform, engine and other key elements which were not indigenously designed by Perodua in Malaysia. Perodua also announced during the media briefing on 19 August that the tentative launch of the Perodua Axia would be in September 2014.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia Bookings\"/> The company aims to sell 10,000 Axia units per month.\n\nThe Axia, which is a [[city car]]/[[A-segment]] car was not originally launched to compete with the similar but more upmarket [[Subcompact car|subcompact]]/[[B-segment]] [[Proton Iriz]], which also launched in the second half of 2014.<ref name=\"Perodua Viva replacement early details 2\"/>\n\n=== Facelifts ===\nThe Axia received first facelift update on 20 January 2017 with the new 1.0L VVT-i engine. The same four variants remained on sale. The facelift brought along revised front grill and bumpers, an external boot release and revised equipment list.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://paultan.org/2017/01/17/2017-perodua-axia-facelift-in-showrooms-from-rm25k/ |title=2017 Perodua Axia facelift officially launched \u2013 1.0L VVT-i engine, two new faces and features, from RM25k |first=Hafriz |last=Shah |work=paultan.org |location=Malaysia |date=20 January 2017 |access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 20 September 2019, the second-facelifted Axia was launched with six variants, including the new GXtra and SUV-inspired Style variants. Only E variant has manual transmission, and all the rest have automatic transmissions with ABS and EBD. The engine for second-facelifted Axia is retained from the previous facelift. At this facelift, both top SE and AV variants share similar appearance with E, G and GXtra variants with few trim differences; and new safety features are fitted such as VSC for GXtra upwards and ASA2.0 for AV variant. Other features such as retractable side mirrors, reverse sensors, driver seat height adjuster and anti-snatch hook are fitted for GXtra upwards also. Axia Style differs from others with different SUV-style bumpers, decorative roof rails, different grille and clear tail lamps.

Although the Viva replacement model will be based on the Ayla/Agya platform, Perodua has iterated that the upper body and external elements will be indigenously designed, and the car will not be just a [[Rebadging|rebadged]] model.\n\nOn 26 August 2013, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, [[Najib Razak]] announced that the replacement model to the Viva will launch in 2014 as the cheapest new car on the market.<ref name=\"Perodua Viva replacement early details\"/> The new model will be built at Perodua's all-new RM1.3 billion, 65,000 sq ft second manufacturing plant, located adjacent to the company's original factory in [[Rawang, Selangor|Rawang]], [[Selangor]].<ref name=\"Perodua second factory\"/> Perodua's new factory will mirror Daihatsu Kyushu's factory in terms of work ethics, technology and efficiency.<ref name=\"Perodua second factory 2\"/> Perodua has since announced the construction of a new engine manufacturing factory in Sendayan, [[Negeri Sembilan]] at cost of RM600 million.<ref name=\"Perodua new engine factory\"/>\n\nPerodua showcased the Global Model A Segment Space (GMA) concept at the 2013 Kuala Lumpur International Motor Show in November.<ref name=\"Perodua GMA interior\"/> The GMA previewed the interior design of the Viva Replacement Model (VRM). Perodua also showcased a new engine, the 1.0 litre [[Daihatsu]] [[Toyota KR engine#1KR-DE|1KR-DE]] as a possible candidate for the VRM.<ref name=\"Perodua GMA engine\"/>\n\nOn 11 June 2014, the first spyshots of an undisguised Perodua Axia were leaked online.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mohd Izarul / campromania |url=http://funtasticko.net/panas-adakah-ini-perodua-axia/ |title=PANAS : Adakah ini Perodua AXIA? |publisher=funtasticko.net |date=11 June 2014 |accessdate=6 August 2014 |language=ms}}</ref> Further photos of various pre-launch Perodua Axia units have since been leaked online, but on 6 August 2014, additional photos revealed the final product name was indeed \u2018Perodua Axia\u2019, after months of media speculation.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mohd Izarul / campromania |url=http://funtasticko.net/axia-sah-nama-rasmi-model-kompak-baharu-perodua/ |title=AXIA sah nama rasmi model kompak baharu Perodua! |publisher=funtasticko.net |date=6 August 2014 |accessdate=6 August 2014 |language=ms}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 August 2014, Perodua teased a photo of the Axia on their official [[Facebook]] page.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia first teaser\"/> Three days later, Perodua announced that bookings for the Axia will open on 15 August, with prices starting from RM24,900 along with a five-year warranty, a first for a Perodua model 5 years\n.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia booking opens\"/> The following day, the first official photo from Perodua confirmed the product name \u2018Axia\u2019 along with the tagline \u2018Your Smart Move\u2019.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia 1.0 G\"/> Later that same day, even more extensive official details on the Axia were unveiled.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia 1.0 SE\"/> Perodua released a teaser of the front end of the Axia Standard E and G variants on 19 August 2014.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia Standard face\"/> The more expensive Axia SE and Advance variants sport a more aggressive and sporty exterior, whereas the cheaper Standard E and G trim lines offer a more modest and basic package.\n\nThe tentative pricing and equipment list for the Perodua Axia was leaked online on 14 August 2014.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia specs leaked\"/>\n\nIn the morning of 19 August 2014, Perodua announced that around 3,500 bookings have been made for the Axia in just the five days since 15 August, when bookings were officially opened.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia Bookings\"/> Around 60-70% of the total bookings were made for the mid-range Axia Standard G model, whereas around 13% accounted for the base model, the Axia Standard E, and the remaining 17-27% made up the more expensive Axia SE and range-topping Axia Advance models.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia Bookings\"/> Additionally, Perodua maintained that production of the now seven-year-old [[Perodua Viva|Viva]] will continue for as long as the demand persists. However, production of the no-frills Viva 660 and high-end Viva 1.0 and Elite is expected to cease nonetheless, with just the mid-range Viva 850 remaining in production.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia Bookings\"/> Perodua also claimed that the all-new Axia will have 95% locally sourced content, with the remainder being imported from [[Indonesia]] and [[Japan]]. Despite having the vast majority of parts and components locally sourced, Perodua will still have to pay royalties to [[Toyota]] and [[Daihatsu]] for the licensing of their platform, engine and other key elements which were not indigenously designed by Perodua in Malaysia. Perodua also announced during the media briefing on 19 August that the tentative launch of the Perodua Axia would be in September 2014.<ref name=\"Perodua Axia Bookings\"/> The company aims to sell 10,000 Axia units per month.\n\nThe Axia, which is a [[city car]]/[[A-segment]] car was not originally launched to compete with the similar but more upmarket [[Subcompact car|subcompact]]/[[B-segment]] [[Proton Iriz]], which also launched in the second half of 2014.<ref name=\"Perodua Viva replacement early details 2\"/>\n\n=== Facelifts ===\nThe Axia received first facelift update on 20 January 2017 with the new 1.0L VVT-i engine. The same four variants remained on sale. The facelift brought along revised front grill and bumpers, an external boot release and revised equipment list.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://paultan.org/2017/01/17/2017-perodua-axia-facelift-in-showrooms-from-rm25k/ |title=2017 Perodua Axia facelift officially launched \u2013 1.0L VVT-i engine, two new faces and features, from RM25k |first=Hafriz |last=Shah |work=paultan.org |location=Malaysia |date=20 January 2017 |access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 20 September 2019, the second-facelifted Axia was launched with six variants, including the new GXtra and SUV-inspired Style variants. Only E variant has manual transmission, and all the rest have automatic transmissions with ABS and EBD. The engine for second-facelifted Axia is retained from the previous facelift. At this facelift, both top SE and AV variants share similar appearance with E, G and GXtra variants with few trim differences; and new safety features are fitted such as VSC for GXtra upwards and ASA2.0 for AV variant. Other features such as retractable side mirrors, reverse sensors, driver seat height adjuster and anti-snatch hook are fitted for GXtra upwards also. Axia Style differs from others with different SUV-style bumpers, decorative roof rails, different grille and clear tail lamps. Axia Style, as well as SE and AV variants have keyless entry, push start button and white-illuminated meter panel as additional standard features.\n\n== Equipment ==\n\n=== Exterior<ref>http://www.perodua.com.my/ourcars/axia/overview/exterior</ref> ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He estimated that he stopped using the drug around 29 times during his life, but was only able to quit permanently after moving to a small Italian village in 1981 where he took up olive farming.<ref name=\"guardian-interview\" />\n\nIn February 2013, Baker said he had [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] from years of heavy smoking, and chronic back pain from degenerative [[osteoarthritis]].<ref name=\"idrummag\" /> In February 2016, Baker announced he had been diagnosed with \"serious heart issues\" and cancelled all future gigs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gingerbaker.com/blog/ginger-is-shocked-by-the-news-of-his-health/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505062347/http://www.gingerbaker.com/blog/ginger-is-shocked-by-the-news-of-his-health/|url-status=dead|title=Ginger is shocked by the news of his health|date=27 February 2016|archivedate=5 May 2016|website=gingerbaker.com}}</ref> Writing on his blog, he said, \"Just seen doctor&nbsp;... big shock&nbsp;... no more gigs for this old drummer&nbsp;... everything is off&nbsp;... of all things I never thought it would be my heart&nbsp;...\"<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Kreps |first1=Daniel |title=Ginger Baker Cancels Tour Due to 'Serious Heart Problems' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ginger-baker-cancels-tour-due-to-serious-heart-problems-20160228 |access-date=12 May 2016 |work=Rolling Stone |date=28 February 2016}}</ref> In late March 2016, it was revealed that Baker was set for pioneering treatment. \"There are two options for surgery and, depending on how strong my old lungs are, they may do both.\" He added, \"Cardiologist is brilliant.
