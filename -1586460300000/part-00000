In addition, as Horberry (2010:26) points out, use of a middle initial would imply that \"Christ\" was Jesus's last name; it is not; for discussion, see [[Jesus]]. For more on humor, see \"Variants\", below.</ref> \n\n== History ==\n[[File:Campbell Alexander.png|Alexander Campbell around 1855|thumb|250px]]\nThe earliest use of the phrase is unknown, but in his autobiography, [[Mark Twain]] (1835\u20131910) observed that it was in general use even in his childhood.<ref>\"In that day, the common swearers of the region [i.e., around his home town of [[Hannibal, Missouri|Hannibal]]] had a way of their own of ''emphasizing'' the Savior's name when they were using it profanely\". The context of Twain's remark (given here in the main text) makes it clear that he was referring to \"Jesus H. Christ\". Source:  Harriet Elinor Smith, ed. (2010) ''The autobiography of Mark Twain''. Berkeley: University of California Press, p. 458.</ref> Twain refers to an episode from 1847, when he was working as a printer's apprentice; Smith (1994) tells the tale thus:\n\n<blockquote>[Twain] recounts a practical joke a friend played on a revival preacher when Twain was an apprentice in a printing shop that [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]], a famous evangelist then visiting Hannibal, hired to print a pamphlet of his sermon. While checking the galleys, Twain's fellow apprentice, Wales McCormick, found he had to make room for some dropped words, which he managed by shortening Jesus Christ on the same line to J. C. As soon as Campbell had read the proofs, he swept indignantly into the shop and commanded McCormick, \"So long as you live, don't you ever diminish the Savior's name again. Put it all in.\" The puckish McCormick obeyed, and then some: he set Jesus H. Christ and printed up all the pamphlets.<ref>Smith (1994:332).  See also R. Kent Rasmussen, \"Wales McCormick\", in ''Critical Companion to Mark Twain: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work'', Infobase Publishing, 2007, p. 786.</ref><ref>Draper (1993) offers further details: the printing shop was the printing facility for the ''Hannibal Courier''. Avoiding \"J. C.\" required three of 16 pages to be reset.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSmith suggests (1994:331-2) that \"Jesus H. Christ\" is a specifically American profanity, and indicates that at least in his experience it is uttered primarily by men. Quinion (2009), a British author, likewise specifies the phrase as belonging to American English.\n\n== Stress pattern ==\nMultiple authors emphasize the practice of placing a strong stress on the \"H\", relating it in various ways to [[expletive infixation]]. Thus Quinion writes:\n\n<blockquote>Its long survival must have a lot to do with its cadence, and the way that an especially strong stress can be placed on the H. You might also think of it as an example of emphatic infixing that loosely fits the models of words like ''abso-bloody-lutely'' or ''tribu-bloody-lation''.<ref>Quinion (2009)</ref></blockquote>\n\nSimilar remarks were made by the linguist [[Dwight Bolinger]], who mentions \"Jesus H. Christ\" in a discussion of the strategies used by English speakers to add additional stresses to \"highly charged words\" for purposes of emphasis.<ref>Bolinger (1986:84-86)</ref> Horberry suggests \"The strong emphasis on the H somehow improves the rhythm of its host phrase.\"<ref>Horberry (2010:25)</ref> The ''Green's Dictionary of Slang'' says \"the H is redundant other than for rhythm\".<ref>Online edition, https://greensdictofslang.com/entry/vi5qeqa</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:IHC-monogram-Jesus-medievalesque.svg|right|thumb|The [[Christogram|divine monogram]], conjectured to be the source of \"Jesus H. Christ\"]]\nUsing the name of Jesus Christ as an oath has been common for many centuries. But the precise origins of the letter ''H'' in the expression ''Jesus H. Christ'' are obscure. While many explanations have been proposed, the most widely accepted derivation is from the [[Christogram|divine monogram]] of Christian symbolism. The symbol, derived from the first three letters of the [[Greek language|Greek]] name of Jesus ({{lang|grc|\u0399\u0397\u03a3\u039f\u03a5\u03a3}}), is transliterated iota-eta-sigma, which can look like IHS, {{lang|grc|\u0399\u0397\u03f9}} (with [[lunate sigma]]), JHS or JHC (\"J\" was historically a mere variant of \"I\"; see [[J]]).\n\nFor how this learned-sounding abbreviation could have served as the basis for vulgar slang, Smith offers the hypothesis that it was noticed by ordinary people when it was worn as a decoration on the [[vestment]]s of [[Anglican]] (i.e., in America, [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]]) clergy.<ref name=\"S332\">Smith (1994:332)</ref> The \"JHC\" variant would particularly invite interpretation of the \"H\" as part of a name.\n\n=== Folk etymology ===\nIf this is the most likely origin of the \"H\", there remains the issue of [[folk etymology]]; that is, the sense shared by ordinary people (not necessarily historically correct) of where the H comes from. Here, a possible origin is the name \"Harold\"; which indeed is mentioned by Smith (1994:32) as the basis of a variant form, \"Jesus Harold Christ\". The \"Harold\" may arise from a common misinterpretation (often by children) of the phrase in the [[Lord's Prayer]], \"Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name.\" This phrase can be mistakenly interpreted as specifying the name of the Deity (\"thy name is ... \"), rather than the true reading, which is \"may thy name be hallowed\". The confusion would arise from the phonetic similarity of ''hallowed'' ([[Help:IPA|IPA]] [\u02c8h\u00e6lo\u028ad]) to ''Harold'' (IPA [\u02c8h\u00e6r\u0259ld]).<ref>For web attestations of the misinterpretation, see [http://www.kissthisguy.com/our-father-who-art-in-heaven-harold-be-misheard-21128.htm], [http://www.iusedtobelieve.com/religion/prayers/prayers_d10.php], [http://www.holyvisions.co.uk/visionsjokes.htm], [http://www.karlroadcc.org/node/28], and [https://books.google.com/books?id=L02fnVSQSBwC&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=Harold+be+thy+name&source=bl&ots=yyQsBJOhLr&sig=Mdcgs20UF-1Jq6rE1BAP_ZjDzgk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZO0xVL3aFo6oogTekoCIBQ&ved=0CB0Q6AEwADge#v=onepage&q=Harold%20be%20thy%20name&f=false]</ref>\n\nIan Ransom reports another folk etymology in a memoir of his childhood.

For more on humor, see \"Variants\", below.</ref> \n\n== History ==\n[[File:Campbell Alexander.png|Alexander Campbell around 1855|thumb|250px]]\nThe earliest use of the phrase is unknown, but in his autobiography, [[Mark Twain]] (1835\u20131910) observed that it was in general use even in his childhood.<ref>\"In that day, the common swearers of the region [i.e., around his home town of [[Hannibal, Missouri|Hannibal]]] had a way of their own of ''emphasizing'' the Savior's name when they were using it profanely\". The context of Twain's remark (given here in the main text) makes it clear that he was referring to \"Jesus H. Christ\". Source:  Harriet Elinor Smith, ed. (2010) ''The autobiography of Mark Twain''. Berkeley: University of California Press, p. 458.</ref> Twain refers to an episode from 1847, when he was working as a printer's apprentice; Smith (1994) tells the tale thus:\n\n<blockquote>[Twain] recounts a practical joke a friend played on a revival preacher when Twain was an apprentice in a printing shop that [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]], a famous evangelist then visiting Hannibal, hired to print a pamphlet of his sermon. While checking the galleys, Twain's fellow apprentice, Wales McCormick, found he had to make room for some dropped words, which he managed by shortening Jesus Christ on the same line to J. C. As soon as Campbell had read the proofs, he swept indignantly into the shop and commanded McCormick, \"So long as you live, don't you ever diminish the Savior's name again. Put it all in.\" The puckish McCormick obeyed, and then some: he set Jesus H. Christ and printed up all the pamphlets.<ref>Smith (1994:332).  See also R. Kent Rasmussen, \"Wales McCormick\", in ''Critical Companion to Mark Twain: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work'', Infobase Publishing, 2007, p. 786.</ref><ref>Draper (1993) offers further details: the printing shop was the printing facility for the ''Hannibal Courier''. Avoiding \"J. C.\" required three of 16 pages to be reset.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSmith suggests (1994:331-2) that \"Jesus H. Christ\" is a specifically American profanity, and indicates that at least in his experience it is uttered primarily by men. Quinion (2009), a British author, likewise specifies the phrase as belonging to American English.\n\n== Stress pattern ==\nMultiple authors emphasize the practice of placing a strong stress on the \"H\", relating it in various ways to [[expletive infixation]]. Thus Quinion writes:\n\n<blockquote>Its long survival must have a lot to do with its cadence, and the way that an especially strong stress can be placed on the H. You might also think of it as an example of emphatic infixing that loosely fits the models of words like ''abso-bloody-lutely'' or ''tribu-bloody-lation''.<ref>Quinion (2009)</ref></blockquote>\n\nSimilar remarks were made by the linguist [[Dwight Bolinger]], who mentions \"Jesus H. Christ\" in a discussion of the strategies used by English speakers to add additional stresses to \"highly charged words\" for purposes of emphasis.<ref>Bolinger (1986:84-86)</ref> Horberry suggests \"The strong emphasis on the H somehow improves the rhythm of its host phrase.\"<ref>Horberry (2010:25)</ref> The ''Green's Dictionary of Slang'' says \"the H is redundant other than for rhythm\".<ref>Online edition, https://greensdictofslang.com/entry/vi5qeqa</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:IHC-monogram-Jesus-medievalesque.svg|right|thumb|The [[Christogram|divine monogram]], conjectured to be the source of \"Jesus H. Christ\"]]\nUsing the name of Jesus Christ as an oath has been common for many centuries. But the precise origins of the letter ''H'' in the expression ''Jesus H. Christ'' are obscure. While many explanations have been proposed, the most widely accepted derivation is from the [[Christogram|divine monogram]] of Christian symbolism. The symbol, derived from the first three letters of the [[Greek language|Greek]] name of Jesus ({{lang|grc|\u0399\u0397\u03a3\u039f\u03a5\u03a3}}), is transliterated iota-eta-sigma, which can look like IHS, {{lang|grc|\u0399\u0397\u03f9}} (with [[lunate sigma]]), JHS or JHC (\"J\" was historically a mere variant of \"I\"; see [[J]]).\n\nFor how this learned-sounding abbreviation could have served as the basis for vulgar slang, Smith offers the hypothesis that it was noticed by ordinary people when it was worn as a decoration on the [[vestment]]s of [[Anglican]] (i.e., in America, [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]]) clergy.<ref name=\"S332\">Smith (1994:332)</ref> The \"JHC\" variant would particularly invite interpretation of the \"H\" as part of a name.\n\n=== Folk etymology ===\nIf this is the most likely origin of the \"H\", there remains the issue of [[folk etymology]]; that is, the sense shared by ordinary people (not necessarily historically correct) of where the H comes from. Here, a possible origin is the name \"Harold\"; which indeed is mentioned by Smith (1994:32) as the basis of a variant form, \"Jesus Harold Christ\". The \"Harold\" may arise from a common misinterpretation (often by children) of the phrase in the [[Lord's Prayer]], \"Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name.\" This phrase can be mistakenly interpreted as specifying the name of the Deity (\"thy name is ... \"), rather than the true reading, which is \"may thy name be hallowed\". The confusion would arise from the phonetic similarity of ''hallowed'' ([[Help:IPA|IPA]] [\u02c8h\u00e6lo\u028ad]) to ''Harold'' (IPA [\u02c8h\u00e6r\u0259ld]).<ref>For web attestations of the misinterpretation, see [http://www.kissthisguy.com/our-father-who-art-in-heaven-harold-be-misheard-21128.htm], [http://www.iusedtobelieve.com/religion/prayers/prayers_d10.php], [http://www.holyvisions.co.uk/visionsjokes.htm], [http://www.karlroadcc.org/node/28], and [https://books.google.com/books?id=L02fnVSQSBwC&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=Harold+be+thy+name&source=bl&ots=yyQsBJOhLr&sig=Mdcgs20UF-1Jq6rE1BAP_ZjDzgk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZO0xVL3aFo6oogTekoCIBQ&ved=0CB0Q6AEwADge#v=onepage&q=Harold%20be%20thy%20name&f=false]</ref>\n\nIan Ransom reports another folk etymology in a memoir of his childhood. The context is how local adults habitually yelled at children:\n\n<blockquote>I hailed from devoted Jesus ''H.'' Christ territory. As a child, \"H\" was a middle initial meaning \"Holy\" and included to honor Jesus while his name was being used to scramble young brains into malleable balls of pure fear. Most folks bellowed the simple \"Jesus Christ,\" so children felt privileged to hear that added \"H.\"<ref>Ransom (2006:37)</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Variants ==\nThe number of variant forms, usually with \"H\" replaced by something longer, is vast.<ref>A machine search of the internet for expressions occurring in the frame \"Jesus _____ Christ\", both h-initial and more generally, is reported by blogger \"Tensor\" at [http://tenser.typepad.com/tenser_said_the_tensor/2007/01/what_does_the_h.html].</ref> \"Jesus Harold Christ\" (i.e. - \"Our Father, who art in Heaven, Harold be thy name...\") is mentioned above.

Lyon was the first editor of DOB's newsletter, [[The Ladder (magazine)|''The Ladder'']], beginning in 1956. Martin took over editorship of the newsletter from 1960 to 1962, and was then replaced by other editors until the newsletter ended its connection with the Daughters of Bilitis in 1970.<ref name=\"ABOUT\"/><ref name=\"LGBTRAN\"/>\n\nWithin five years of its origin, the Daughters of Bilitis had chapters around the country, including Chicago, New York, New Orleans, San Diego, Los Angeles, Detroit, Denver, Cleveland and Philadelphia.  There were 500 subscribers to ''The Ladder'' but far more readers, as copies were circulated among women who were reluctant to put their names to a subscription list.<ref name=\"GLBTQSS\" /> For their pioneering work on ''The Ladder'', Martin and Lyon were among the first inductees into the LGBT Journalists Hall of Fame, which was established in 2005 by the [[National Lesbian & Gay Journalists Association]]. Lyon and Martin remained involved in the DOB until the late 1960s. The Daughters of Bilitis, which had taken a conservative approach to helping lesbians deal with society, disbanded in 1970 due to the rise of more radical activism.<ref name=\"GLBTQSS\" />\n\n===National Organization for Women===\nMartin and Lyon have been active in the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) since 1967. Del Martin was the first open lesbian elected to the board of directors of NOW. Lyon and Martin worked to combat the [[homophobia]] they perceived in NOW, and encouraged the National Board of Directors of NOW's 1971 resolution that lesbian issues were [[feminist]] issues.<ref name=\"GLBTQSS\"/>\n\n===San Francisco Commission on the Status of Women===\n\"Del\" Martin was the first openly gay woman to be appointed to the SFCOSW by then Mayor [[George R. Moscone]]  in 1977.  Martin joined forces with other minority SFCOSW Commissioners, such as Kathleen Hardiman Arnold (now Kathleen Rand Reed), and the first Black woman to be elected to the Board of Supervisors, [[Ella Hill Hutch]], to focus on the nexus of gay women's rights and racial and ethnic discrimination.  In their later work with a health clinic, Martin and Lyon focused, for instance, on the specific health and issues affecting Black and Latina gay women.  Martin was ahead of her time in understanding the cultural aspects of gay health.\n\n===Alice B. Toklas Democratic Club===\nThe [[Alice B. Toklas Democratic Club]], named after San Francisco-born author [[Alice B. Toklas]], was formed on Valentine's Day 1972 at the offices of the [[Society for Individual Rights]] near 6th and Market Streets in San Francisco. The founding member was James Foster, who was the first openly gay man to speak at a national political convention.  He spoke to the need for inclusion of gays and lesbians in the political process.  Though Lyon and Martin were not able to attend this first meeting, they became members soon thereafter.  The first motion the club passed was in support of the [[marijuana]] initiative. Among the founding members were Gary Miller and Ron Bentley. The purpose of the club is to support candidates who are supportive of gay and lesbian rights and help them get elected to public office. Among its earlier presidents were Jo Daly <!--(don't remember what year)--> and Gary Miller (1975). In 1975 the club endorsed [[George Moscone]] for mayor over [[Dianne Feinstein]]. The club changed its name to the '''Alice B. Toklas Gay and Lesbian Democratic Club'''.\n\n===Lyon-Martin Health Services===\n'''Lyon-Martin Health Services''' was founded in 1979<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&article=3087|title=The Bay Area Reporter Online - Lesbian pioneers first in city to wed|work=Bay Area Reporter|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref> by a group of medical providers and health activists as a clinic for lesbians who lacked access to non-judgmental and affordable health care. Named after Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, the clinic soon became a model for culturally-sensitive community-based health care. Since 1993, Lyon-Martin also has provided case management and primary healthcare in programs specifically designed for very low-income and uninsured women with [[HIV]], as well as services for [[transgender]] people.\n\n===Senior activists===\n[[File:GLBTHistoryMuseum.WeddingPantsuits12 10.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pantsuits worn by Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon to their weddings in San Francisco in 2004 and 2008; on display at the GLBT History Museum, 4127 18th St., San Francisco.

Lyon was the first editor of DOB's newsletter, [[The Ladder (magazine)|''The Ladder'']], beginning in 1956. Martin took over editorship of the newsletter from 1960 to 1962, and was then replaced by other editors until the newsletter ended its connection with the Daughters of Bilitis in 1970.<ref name=\"ABOUT\"/><ref name=\"LGBTRAN\"/>\n\nWithin five years of its origin, the Daughters of Bilitis had chapters around the country, including Chicago, New York, New Orleans, San Diego, Los Angeles, Detroit, Denver, Cleveland and Philadelphia.  There were 500 subscribers to ''The Ladder'' but far more readers, as copies were circulated among women who were reluctant to put their names to a subscription list.<ref name=\"GLBTQSS\" /> For their pioneering work on ''The Ladder'', Martin and Lyon were among the first inductees into the LGBT Journalists Hall of Fame, which was established in 2005 by the [[National Lesbian & Gay Journalists Association]]. Lyon and Martin remained involved in the DOB until the late 1960s. The Daughters of Bilitis, which had taken a conservative approach to helping lesbians deal with society, disbanded in 1970 due to the rise of more radical activism.<ref name=\"GLBTQSS\" />\n\n===National Organization for Women===\nMartin and Lyon have been active in the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) since 1967. Del Martin was the first open lesbian elected to the board of directors of NOW. Lyon and Martin worked to combat the [[homophobia]] they perceived in NOW, and encouraged the National Board of Directors of NOW's 1971 resolution that lesbian issues were [[feminist]] issues.<ref name=\"GLBTQSS\"/>\n\n===San Francisco Commission on the Status of Women===\n\"Del\" Martin was the first openly gay woman to be appointed to the SFCOSW by then Mayor [[George R. Moscone]]  in 1977.  Martin joined forces with other minority SFCOSW Commissioners, such as Kathleen Hardiman Arnold (now Kathleen Rand Reed), and the first Black woman to be elected to the Board of Supervisors, [[Ella Hill Hutch]], to focus on the nexus of gay women's rights and racial and ethnic discrimination.  In their later work with a health clinic, Martin and Lyon focused, for instance, on the specific health and issues affecting Black and Latina gay women.  Martin was ahead of her time in understanding the cultural aspects of gay health.\n\n===Alice B. Toklas Democratic Club===\nThe [[Alice B. Toklas Democratic Club]], named after San Francisco-born author [[Alice B. Toklas]], was formed on Valentine's Day 1972 at the offices of the [[Society for Individual Rights]] near 6th and Market Streets in San Francisco. The founding member was James Foster, who was the first openly gay man to speak at a national political convention.  He spoke to the need for inclusion of gays and lesbians in the political process.  Though Lyon and Martin were not able to attend this first meeting, they became members soon thereafter.  The first motion the club passed was in support of the [[marijuana]] initiative. Among the founding members were Gary Miller and Ron Bentley. The purpose of the club is to support candidates who are supportive of gay and lesbian rights and help them get elected to public office. Among its earlier presidents were Jo Daly <!--(don't remember what year)--> and Gary Miller (1975). In 1975 the club endorsed [[George Moscone]] for mayor over [[Dianne Feinstein]]. The club changed its name to the '''Alice B. Toklas Gay and Lesbian Democratic Club'''.\n\n===Lyon-Martin Health Services===\n'''Lyon-Martin Health Services''' was founded in 1979<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&article=3087|title=The Bay Area Reporter Online - Lesbian pioneers first in city to wed|work=Bay Area Reporter|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref> by a group of medical providers and health activists as a clinic for lesbians who lacked access to non-judgmental and affordable health care. Named after Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, the clinic soon became a model for culturally-sensitive community-based health care. Since 1993, Lyon-Martin also has provided case management and primary healthcare in programs specifically designed for very low-income and uninsured women with [[HIV]], as well as services for [[transgender]] people.\n\n===Senior activists===\n[[File:GLBTHistoryMuseum.WeddingPantsuits12 10.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pantsuits worn by Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon to their weddings in San Francisco in 2004 and 2008; on display at the GLBT History Museum, 4127 18th St., San Francisco.

The village has two public houses (''Copper Beech'' and ''Stanton Arms'') and a [[Miners' institute|miners' welfare club]]. The village used to have a village hall with squash and sauna facilities with some gym equipment. However, the district council of Newark decided to close these due mainly to the low usage of both the squash and sauna facilities. The old squash centre site has now been turned into a Miners Museum. The village hall's main part is still in use for coffee mornings, and other community gatherings including a bowls event for local people. \n \nOn the Kirklington side of the village is a supported Living home for adults with learning disabilities and autism  called LifeWays.\n\nBilsthorpe Flying High Academy is the local education facility for children with access to nursery and primary learning.
