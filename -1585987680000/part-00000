The Convention requires courts of contracting [[Sovereign state|states]] to give effect to private agreements to [[arbitration|arbitrate]] and to recognize and enforce [[arbitration award]]s made in other contracting states. Widely considered the foundational instrument for [[international arbitration]], it applies to arbitrations that are not considered as domestic awards in the state where recognition and enforcement is sought.\n\nThe New York Convention is very successful.  Nowadays many countries have adopted Arbitration laws based on the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law|UNCITRAL]] Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration. This works with the New York Convention so that the provisions on making an enforceable award, or asking a court to set it aside or not enforce it, are the same under the Model Law and the New York Convention.  The Model Law does not replace the NYC, it works with it. An award made in a country which is not a signatory to the NYC cannot take advantage of the Convention to enforce that award in the 163 Contracting States unless there is some bilateral recognition, whether or not the Arbitration was held under the provisions of the UNCITRAL Model Law.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1953, the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] (ICC) produced the first draft Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of International Arbitral Awards to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]].  With slight modifications, the Council submitted the convention to the International Conference in the Spring of 1958. The Conference was chaired by [[Willem Schurmann]], the Dutch Permanent Representative to the United Nations and [[Oscar Schachter]], a leading figure in international law who later taught at [[Columbia Law School]] and the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs, and served as the President of the American Society of International Law.\n\n[[International arbitration]] is an increasingly popular means of [[alternative dispute resolution]] for cross-border commercial transactions. The primary advantage of arbitration over court litigation is enforceability:  an arbitration award is enforceable in most countries in the world. Other advantages of arbitration include the ability to select a neutral forum to resolve disputes, that arbitration awards are final and not ordinarily subject to appeal, the ability to choose flexible procedures for the arbitration, and confidentiality.\n\nOnce a dispute between parties is settled, the winning party needs to collect the award or judgment. If the loser voluntarily pays, no court action is necessary.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Argen|first=Robert|date=2015-01-01|title=Ending Blind Spot Justice: Broadening the Transparency Trend in International Arbitration|ssrn=2393188|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}</ref> Otherwise, unless the assets of the losing party are located in the country where the court judgment was rendered, the winning party needs to obtain a court judgment in the jurisdiction where the other party resides or where its assets are located. Unless there is a treaty on recognition of court judgments between the country where the judgment is rendered and the country where the winning party seeks to collect, the winning party will be unable to use the court judgment to collect.\n\n=== Cases and statistics ===\nPublic information on overall and specific arbitration cases is quite limited as there is no need to involve the courts at all unless there is a dispute, and in most cases the loser pays voluntarily.<ref name=\":0\" /> In China, a review of disputed cases in China found that from 2000 to 2011, in 17 cases the Supreme People's Court upheld the refusal to enforce the arbitration agreement due to a provision in Article V; China has an automatic appeal system to the highest court, so this includes all such refusals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/ab/vol1/iss1/10/|title=\"Implementation of the New York Convention in China\" by Xiaohong Xia|website=digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref>\n\n==Summary of provisions==\nUnder the Convention, an [[arbitration award]] issued in any other state can generally be freely enforced in any other contracting state, only subject to certain, limited defenses. These defenses are:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/bjil/vol3/iss2/2/|title=\"Enforcement of Arbitral Awards under the New York Convention - Practic\" by Joseph T. McLaughlin and Laurie Genevro|website=scholarship.law.berkeley.edu|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref>\n\n#a party to the arbitration agreement was, under the law applicable to him, under some [[Capacity (law)|incapacity]], or the arbitration agreement was not valid under its [[Contract (conflict)#Proper law|governing law]];\n#a party was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings, or was otherwise unable to present its case;\n#the award deals with an issue not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains matters beyond the scope of the arbitration (subject to the proviso that an award which contains decisions on such matters may be enforced to the extent that it contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration which can be separated from those matters not so submitted);\n#the composition of the [[arbitral tribunal]] was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties or, failing such agreement, with the law of the place where the hearing took place (the \"[[lex loci arbitri]]\");\n#the award has not yet become binding upon the parties, or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority, either in the country where the arbitration took place, or pursuant to the law of the arbitration agreement;\n#the subject matter of the award was not capable of resolution by arbitration; or\n#enforcement would be contrary to \"[[public policy]]\".\n{{wikisource|Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards}}\n\nAdditionally, there are three types of reservations that countries may apply:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://interarb.com/nyc/reservations |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620215224/http://interarb.com/nyc/reservations |archivedate=20 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }} New York Convention, 1958 - Reservations</ref>\n\n#Conventional Reservation - some countries only enforce arbitration awards issued in a Convention member state\n#Commercial Reservation \u2013 some countries only enforce arbitration awards that are related to commercial transactions\n#Reciprocity reservation \u2013 some countries may choose not to limit the Convention to only awards from other contracting states, but may however limit application to awards from non-contracting states such that they will only apply it to the extent to which such a non-contracting state grants reciprocal treatment.\n\nStates may make any or all of the above reservations. Because there are two similar issues conflated under the term \"reciprocity\", it is important to determine which such reservation (or both) an enforcing state has made.\n\n==Parties to the Convention==\nAs of September 2019, the Convention has 163 state parties, which includes 158 of the 193 United Nations member states plus the [[Cook Islands]], the [[Holy See]], and the [[State of Palestine]]. Thirty-threeUN member states have not adopted the Convention. In addition, [[Taiwan]] has not been permitted to adopt the Convention (but generally enforces foreign arbitration judgments) and a number of [[British Overseas Territories]] have not had the Convention extended to them by Order in Council. British Overseas Territories to which the New York Convention has not yet been extended by Order in Council are: [[Anguilla]], [[Falkland Islands]], [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], [[Montserrat]], [[Saint Helena]] (including Ascension and Tristan da Cunha).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In ''[[Foster v. Neilson]]'', the Supreme Court held \"Our constitution declares a treaty to be the law of the land.  It is, consequently, to be regarded in courts of justice as equivalent to an act of the Legislature, whenever it operates of itself without the aid of any legislative provision.\"<ref>Foster v. Neilson, 27 U.S. 253, 314 (1829). See also Valentine v. U.S. ex rel. Neidecker, 57 S.Ct. 100, 103 (1936); Medellin v. Dretke, 125 S.Ct. 2088, 2103 (2005); Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 126 S.Ct. 2669, 2695 (2006).</ref> Thus, over a course of 181 years, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a self-executing treaty is an act of the Legislature (i.e., act of Congress).\n\nWith specific regard to the New York Convention, at least one court discussed, but ultimately avoided, the issue of whether the treaty is self-executing.  The court nonetheless held that the Convention was, at the least, an implemented non-self-executing treaty that still had legal force as a treaty (as distinguished from an Act of Congress).<ref>''Safety National Casualty Corp. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London'', 587 F.3d 714 (5th Cir. 2009) (en banc), ''cert. den'd'', 562 U.S. 827 (2010).</ref> Based on that determination, the court held that the Convention preempted state law that sought to void arbitration clauses in international reinsurance treaties.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Hague Choice of Court Convention]]\n*[[Hague Judgments Convention]]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://archive.is/20050720011050/http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/NYConvention.html/ Uncitral]\n* [http://www.newyorkconvention1958.org/ 1958 New York Convention Guide] (This website was developed by Shearman & Sterling and Columbia Law School, in cooperation with UNCITRAL)\n* [http://www.newyorkconvention.org/ New York Convention], gives access to information regarding the New York Convention in general, its history, its interpretation and application by the courts\n* [http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/NYConvention_status.html Status.

of Foreign Arbitral Awards''', commonly known as the '''New York Convention''', was adopted by a [[United Nations]] diplomatic conference on 10 June 1958 and entered into force on 7 June 1959. The Convention requires courts of contracting [[Sovereign state|states]] to give effect to private agreements to [[arbitration|arbitrate]] and to recognize and enforce [[arbitration award]]s made in other contracting states. Widely considered the foundational instrument for [[international arbitration]], it applies to arbitrations that are not considered as domestic awards in the state where recognition and enforcement is sought.\n\nThe New York Convention is very successful.  Nowadays many countries have adopted Arbitration laws based on the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law|UNCITRAL]] Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration. This works with the New York Convention so that the provisions on making an enforceable award, or asking a court to set it aside or not enforce it, are the same under the Model Law and the New York Convention.  The Model Law does not replace the NYC, it works with it. An award made in a country which is not a signatory to the NYC cannot take advantage of the Convention to enforce that award in the 161 signatory countries unless there is some bilateral recognition, whether or not the Arbitration was held under the provisions of the UNCITRAL Model Law.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1953, the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] (ICC) produced the first draft Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of International Arbitral Awards to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]].  With slight modifications, the Council submitted the convention to the International Conference in the Spring of 1958. The Conference was chaired by [[Willem Schurmann]], the Dutch Permanent Representative to the United Nations and [[Oscar Schachter]], a leading figure in international law who later taught at [[Columbia Law School]] and the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs, and served as the President of the American Society of International Law.\n\n[[International arbitration]] is an increasingly popular means of [[alternative dispute resolution]] for cross-border commercial transactions. The primary advantage of arbitration over court litigation is enforceability:  an arbitration award is enforceable in most countries in the world. Other advantages of arbitration include the ability to select a neutral forum to resolve disputes, that arbitration awards are final and not ordinarily subject to appeal, the ability to choose flexible procedures for the arbitration, and confidentiality.\n\nOnce a dispute between parties is settled, the winning party needs to collect the award or judgment. If the loser voluntarily pays, no court action is necessary.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Argen|first=Robert|date=2015-01-01|title=Ending Blind Spot Justice: Broadening the Transparency Trend in International Arbitration|ssrn=2393188|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}</ref> Otherwise, unless the assets of the losing party are located in the country where the court judgment was rendered, the winning party needs to obtain a court judgment in the jurisdiction where the other party resides or where its assets are located. Unless there is a treaty on recognition of court judgments between the country where the judgment is rendered and the country where the winning party seeks to collect, the winning party will be unable to use the court judgment to collect.\n\n=== Cases and statistics ===\nPublic information on overall and specific arbitration cases is quite limited as there is no need to involve the courts at all unless there is a dispute, and in most cases the loser pays voluntarily.<ref name=\":0\" /> In China, a review of disputed cases in China found that from 2000 to 2011, in 17 cases the Supreme People's Court upheld the refusal to enforce the arbitration agreement due to a provision in Article V; China has an automatic appeal system to the highest court, so this includes all such refusals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/ab/vol1/iss1/10/|title=\"Implementation of the New York Convention in China\" by Xiaohong Xia|website=digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref>\n\n==Summary of provisions==\nUnder the Convention, an [[arbitration award]] issued in any other state can generally be freely enforced in any other contracting state, only subject to certain, limited defenses. These defenses are:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/bjil/vol3/iss2/2/|title=\"Enforcement of Arbitral Awards under the New York Convention - Practic\" by Joseph T. McLaughlin and Laurie Genevro|website=scholarship.law.berkeley.edu|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref>\n\n#a party to the arbitration agreement was, under the law applicable to him, under some [[Capacity (law)|incapacity]], or the arbitration agreement was not valid under its [[Contract (conflict)#Proper law|governing law]];\n#a party was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings, or was otherwise unable to present its case;\n#the award deals with an issue not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains matters beyond the scope of the arbitration (subject to the proviso that an award which contains decisions on such matters may be enforced to the extent that it contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration which can be separated from those matters not so submitted);\n#the composition of the [[arbitral tribunal]] was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties or, failing such agreement, with the law of the place where the hearing took place (the \"[[lex loci arbitri]]\");\n#the award has not yet become binding upon the parties, or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority, either in the country where the arbitration took place, or pursuant to the law of the arbitration agreement;\n#the subject matter of the award was not capable of resolution by arbitration; or\n#enforcement would be contrary to \"[[public policy]]\".\n{{wikisource|Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards}}\n\nAdditionally, there are three types of reservations that countries may apply:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://interarb.com/nyc/reservations |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620215224/http://interarb.com/nyc/reservations |archivedate=20 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }} New York Convention, 1958 - Reservations</ref>\n\n#Conventional Reservation - some countries only enforce arbitration awards issued in a Convention member state\n#Commercial Reservation \u2013 some countries only enforce arbitration awards that are related to commercial transactions\n#Reciprocity reservation \u2013 some countries may choose not to limit the Convention to only awards from other contracting states, but may however limit application to awards from non-contracting states such that they will only apply it to the extent to which such a non-contracting state grants reciprocal treatment.\n\nStates may make any or all of the above reservations. Because there are two similar issues conflated under the term \"reciprocity\", it is important to determine which such reservation (or both) an enforcing state has made.\n\n==Parties to the Convention==\nAs of September 2019, the Convention has 161 state parties, which includes 158 of the 193 United Nations member states plus the [[Cook Islands]], the [[Holy See]], and the [[State of Palestine]]. Thirty-five UN member states have not adopted the Convention. In addition, [[Taiwan]] has not been permitted to adopt the Convention (but generally enforces foreign arbitration judgments) and a number of [[British Overseas Territories]] have not had the Convention extended to them by Order in Council. British Overseas Territories to which the New York Convention has not yet been extended by Order in Council are: [[Anguilla]], [[Falkland Islands]], [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], [[Montserrat]], [[Saint Helena]] (including Ascension and Tristan da Cunha).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In ''[[Foster v. Neilson]]'', the Supreme Court held \"Our constitution declares a treaty to be the law of the land.  It is, consequently, to be regarded in courts of justice as equivalent to an act of the Legislature, whenever it operates of itself without the aid of any legislative provision.\"<ref>Foster v. Neilson, 27 U.S. 253, 314 (1829). See also Valentine v. U.S. ex rel. Neidecker, 57 S.Ct. 100, 103 (1936); Medellin v. Dretke, 125 S.Ct. 2088, 2103 (2005); Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 126 S.Ct. 2669, 2695 (2006).</ref> Thus, over a course of 181 years, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a self-executing treaty is an act of the Legislature (i.e., act of Congress).\n\nWith specific regard to the New York Convention, at least one court discussed, but ultimately avoided, the issue of whether the treaty is self-executing.  The court nonetheless held that the Convention was, at the least, an implemented non-self-executing treaty that still had legal force as a treaty (as distinguished from an Act of Congress).<ref>''Safety National Casualty Corp. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London'', 587 F.3d 714 (5th Cir. 2009) (en banc), ''cert. den'd'', 562 U.S. 827 (2010).</ref> Based on that determination, the court held that the Convention preempted state law that sought to void arbitration clauses in international reinsurance treaties.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Hague Choice of Court Convention]]\n*[[Hague Judgments Convention]]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://archive.is/20050720011050/http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/NYConvention.html/ Uncitral]\n* [http://www.newyorkconvention1958.org/ 1958 New York Convention Guide] (This website was developed by Shearman & Sterling and Columbia Law School, in cooperation with UNCITRAL)\n* [http://www.newyorkconvention.org/ New York Convention], gives access to information regarding the New York Convention in general, its history, its interpretation and application by the courts\n* [http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/NYConvention_status.html Status.

[[Rome]].{{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=99}} In 1920 he further moved to [[Nice]], where he lived for 17 more years. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=102}}\n\n==Tennis career==\nMikhail Sumarokov-Elston was an eight-time national tennis champion, and also a two-time national indoors champion.<ref name=\"rusart\" /><ref name=\"smsport\" /> He was successful in singles five consecutive times between 1910\u201314, two more time in mixed doubles and also a doubles champion.<ref name=\"smsport\" /> He is still the youngest All-Russia champion to date with his 14 years of age at the time of his first triump. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004a|p=26}} He won his first indoor trophy in 1911 in St. Petersburg. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004a|p=27}}On international level his first main tournament was the 1905 Bad Homburg Cup (of which he won the second-class edition) but lost in the second round to [[Irving Wright]].<ref name=\"spalding\" /> The next year at the [[Wiesbaden]] Championships, where he \u2013 still an adolescent \u2013 was forced to withdraw from the second round after beating Herr von Parpart in the kick-off round.<ref name=\"rusart\" /> He played in several other tournaments throughout Germany, France and Switzerland before returning to Russia.<ref name=\"rusart\" /> There he won city tournaments in Moscow and [[St. Petersburg]].<ref name=\"rustennisfame\" /> Altogether he was crowned two-time St. Petersburg champion in 1912 and 1914 and two-time Moscow champion in 1910 counting the singles and doubles.<ref name=\"rusart\" />\n\nOnly a week after his first St. Petersburg title Sumarokov traveled to [[Sweden]] to participate in the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] with veteran player [[Aleksandr Alenitsyn]]. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=37}} That tournament was also his only preparation for the games as he had to pass his high school diploma exams prior. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=37}} The Olympic draw suffered a setback on expected entries of well-known players due to scheduling conflicts with the [[1912 Wimbledon Championships]]. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=40}} Even Alenitsyn withdrew from the singles outdoor event before its start.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=40}} The first match against the Swedish champion [[Carl Setterwall]] saw an easy two set lead for Sumarokov the third was taken by Sweden after a twenty-game tie and the fourth last set was secured by Russia.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=41}} In the next round [[1912 French Championships]] finalist Oscar Kreuzer waited for his opponent.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=41}} The match, which was witnessed by [[Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia (1890\u20131958)|Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna]] had a back-and-forth fight so fierce that Sumarokov torn the strings of his racquet and had to change it but that could't save him from losing to the German in four sets.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=42}} He found consolation in the doubles tournament where he and Alenitsyn reached the quarterfinals.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=43}}\n\nThe first Russian Championships opened for foreign player registration were held for the first time in 1912.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=43}}  Among the non-Russian entrants were [[Ludwig von Salm-Hoogstraeten]], [[Harold Kitson]] and [[Einer Ulrich]].{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|pp=43-44}} The first of these big tests came in the semifinals against Count Salm. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=44}}The Austrian lost in straight sets only showing resistance in the second. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=44}} The final match should have been a showdown between Kitson and Sumarokov but lasted short.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=45}} After Sumarokov scored the first set 6:3 Kitson got frustrated, complained to the chair umpire, grabbed his towel and left the court citing a right hand injury, which resulted in a walkover home victory.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=45}} He became the undisputed champion after winning the doubles and mixed doubles as well with Count Salm and Ekaterina Hirschfeld respectively. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=46}}\n\n1913 started the same way as the year before, Mikhail had to pass his University exams so he had few chances to practise before setting out to [[Paris]] for the [[World Hard Court Championships]].{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=57}} There he advanced through the first round beating E. Chelli. In the second round he was drawn to face young French prodigy and reigning Olympic champion [[Andr\u00e9 Gobert]].{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=58}} It was a quick defeat as Sumarokov couldn't adapt to the fast-paced net-volley game of Gobert. He was also eliminated from the doubles contest in the very first round mostly due to his partner [[Paul Aym\u00e9]]'s leg injury, which he suffered the previous night and kept them handicapped the whole match. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=60}} Oddly it is thanks to these early exits that he was eligible for the consolation tournament, which was organized for the losers of the first two rounds. There he played his first match against one-half of his recent doubles opponents [[William le Maire de Warz\u00e9e d'Hermalle]] (who had a 6-1 head-to-head record against fellow Belgian Champion [[Paul de Borman]] at the time{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=63}}). {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=60}} This proved to be a tough warm-up for the later matches and it went two sets six-all before Elston broke through. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|pp=61-63}} His former doubles partner [[Paul Aym\u00e9]] resigned from the quarterfinal for unknown reasons and gave him a walkover. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=63}} In the semifinal came a pleasant surprise as the defending consolation title-holder [[Felix Pipes]] lost to him in two fast sets. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=63}} The final was a rematch from the Russian Championships with [[Ludwig von Salm-Hoogstraeten]].{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=63}} The day was struck with extreme heat so intense that it was dangerous to health. After a four set deuce the two finalists agreed to leave the decision to the drawing of lots and finish the match. The luck favored Salm and therefore he was announced the winner. The Cup was awarded to him but as soon as the chairman of the International Lawn Tennis Federation Henry Wallet realized that the winner's name was traditionally engraved onto the cup he reversed his decision and divided the prizes. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=64}}\n\nTwo weeks later Sumarokov was schedules to retain his title at the second annual Russian International Championships. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=66}} It had a star-loaded 136-competitor field with Frenchmen [[Maurice Germot]], [[Max Decugis]] and British [[Arthur Lowe (tennis)|Arthur Lowe]] and [[Charles P. Dixon]] all were present.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=66}} In the first semifinal Sumarokov encountered Germot and overcame him in three straight sets while in the other all-English semifinal Dixon triumphed over Lowe. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=67}} The final showed that the Russian player could stand the ground against world top ten challengers as well. From a two-one set disadvantage he closed the match with a two love-sets and kept his title after 2 hours 54 minutes battle. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|pp=68-69}} He then lost to Dixon in the first round of the doubles but beat him again for the mixed doubles title. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=69}}\n\nAlthough never played in the [[Davis Cup]] he represented Russia in the international matches against Great Britain and France in the last two consecutive years preceding the [[First World War]].<ref name=\"rusart\" /> First in 1913  against the England team of [[Roderick McNair]], [[Albert Prebble]], [[Arthur Lowe (tennis)|Arthur Lowe]] and [[Charles P. Dixon]].{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=70}} The two tennis federation agreed in a 12-match tie with 8 singles and 4 doubles rubbers.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=70}} Sumarokov was still exhausted from his recent Russian Championships final with Dixon and thus lost easily to Lowe and decided to step back from further participation and had to be replaced with inexperienced players.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=71}} As a consequence the Russian team lost. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=72}} This marked the first time that an official national tennis team was formed. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=73}}\n\nIn the 1914 Russian Championships he became a five-time champion after defeating [[Heinrich Kleinschroth]] in a five-set final. Curiosity of the Russian-German meeting was that the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Sarajevo regicide]] happened during the tournament (which later escalated into [[World War I]]) and Russia had sent an envoy to France to strengthen a possible alliance against the German Empire.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=80}} Just two weeks later the first Russia-France team match was held. It was agreed to follow [[Davis Cup]] rules and the French delegation was an all-Olympian squad of [[Maurice Germot]], [[Max Decugis]], [[Albert Canet]], [[\u00c9douard M\u00e9ny de Marangue]]{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|pp=83-84}} The team challenge was interrupted in the middle with the outbreak of World War I and the visitors only managed to get onto the last train home before Germany declared war on the [[Russian Empire]] on 19 July.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=85}}\n\nAfter the war he won the Malta Championships in 1919.<ref name=\"rusart\" /> The following year he clinched his first French title at the South of France Championships beating home favorite [[Alain Gerbault]] in a five-set final.<ref name=\"rusart\" /> The next year in [[Nice]] he was eliminated in the semifinal stage by [[Gordon Lowe]].<ref name=\"rusart\" /> However he did defend his South of France title by beating [[Giovanni Balbi de Robecco]] by only dropping two games.<ref name=\"rusart\" /> This was the first time he partnered [[Suzanne Lenglen]] for the mixed contest, which they won.<ref name=\"rusart\" />  In 1922 he was triumphant in Nice] as well, grabbing the singles trophy easily against [[Maurice F\u00e9rrier]].{{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=117}} He took the doubles as well with Gerbault. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=117}}He defended the South of France title for the second time against legendary [[Henri Cochet]] having had beaten [[Charles Aeschlimann]] on his way to the final.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=119}}<ref name=\"PetitNi\u00e7ois\" /> At the same tournament he also repeated his last year feat with Lenglen by overcoming [[Lord Rocksavage]] and [[Elizabeth Ryan]] in the mixed final.<ref name=\"rusart\" /><ref name=\"PetitNi\u00e7ois\" /> He almost celebrated his first triple crown trophy with his teammate Gerbault but fell short in the doubles final against Rocksavage-Cochet.<ref name=\"PetitNi\u00e7ois\" /> It is worth to note that it was the first time Sumarokov played on grass courts. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=124}} In 1923 the team of Sumarokov-Lenglen dropped the same title to [[Randolph Lycett]] and [[Elizabeth Ryan]].<ref name=\"rusart\" /> In 1931 at the Parc Imperial L.T.C. de Nice [[George Lyttleton-Rogers]] and his partner [[Rosie Berthet]] had an overwhelming victory over Sumarokov-Elston and Miss. J. Franks in the mixed final.<ref name=\"tennis&golf\" /> The same year he was also mixed doubles runner-up in two other tournaments at the New Court Lawn Tennis Club and Cannes Lawn Tennis Club losing both times.<ref name=\"rusart\" /> He reached the semifinals of the doubles and mixed in the Nice Tennis Club tournament.<ref name=\"figaro\" /> He won the Russian \u00c9migr\u00e9 Tennis Championships three consecutive times beginning from 1935.<ref name=\"rusart\" /> He turned professional in 1936.<ref name=\"rusart\" />\n\n===Playing style and equipment===\nHe played left-handed with a heavy topspin, after he had to give up his right-handed style due to a childhood injury.<ref name=\"rusart\" />\nHis left-hand serve was so rare that he gave exhibition matches in Germany to [[Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia]] and [[Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia (1863\u20131919)|Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia]].<ref name=\"Straits\" /> According to his contemporary coach Alexandr Stakhovich he was a baseline player with a formidable backhand.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=58}} Sumarokov played with Doherty, [[Slazenger]] and Driva racquets. In 1911 he changed to Maxim racquets. The manufacturer even released an autographed series of racquets with \"Sumarokov\" written on it with golden embossed letters. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004a|p=33}} Later he adjusted his game to putting a curl to the ball as well as hitting it hard and with a high trajectory as described by [[Henri Cochet]] in his book ''Tennis''. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=120}} He is thought to be the first who used this method, which became popular decades later, and being used by many players most notably [[Jimmy Connors]] and [[Guillermo Vilas]].{{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=120}}\n\n==Personal life==\nMikhail Sumarokov-Elston was well educated and at the age of thirteen he already spoke five languages.<ref name=\"Straits\" /> Apart from playing tennis he was an amateur [[chess]] player as well. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=76}} He was in a great relationship with Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]] and played tennis with a couple of times. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=49}}In 1913 he was elected an honorary member of the Stade Fran\u00e7ais in Paris.<ref name=\"rusart\" /> He married Natalia Nikolaevna Bellik in 1932.<ref name=\"rusart\" /><ref name=\"findagrave\" /> The next year she gave birth to their daughter Sofia.<ref name=\"rusart\" /> They moved to London in 1937, where led the Anglo-Russian Sports Club in [[Chiswick]].<ref name=\"rusart\" /> Died in the [[University College Hospital]] in 1970 and was buried in the [[Chiswick New Cemetery]].<ref name=\"rusart\" /><ref name=\"findagrave\" /> In 2002 he was inducted to the Russian Tennis Hall of Fame for his sport merits.<ref name=\"rusart\" /><ref name=\"smsport\" />\n\n==Notes==\n*{{note label|birth|a|a}} Sources differ regarding his birth date.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004a|p=15}} However his grave shows  {{OldStyleDate|November 21|1893|9 November}}.<ref name=\"findagrave\" />\n*{{note label|ancestor|b|b}} According to the newest researches the house of Kutuzov is not related to the House of Sumarokov by blood but only by adoption.<ref name=\"Kutuzov\" />\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

He competed in two events at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]].<ref name=\"sports-reference\" /> Apart from his supremacy in the Russian national championships he was a Maltese champion and various French Riviera titleholder.<ref name=\"rusart\" />\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:Romanoffs leaving crimea.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The Sumarokovs along with the [[House of Romanov|Russian Imperial Family]] (latter pictured) leaving [[Crimea]]]]\nMikhail Sumarokov-Elston was born on in 1893{{ref label|birth|a|a}} to Count [[Nicholai Felixovich Sumarokov-Elston]] reserve Lieutenant of the [[1st Guard Cavalry division (Russian Empire)|Cavalry Regiment]] and Countess [[Sofia Mikhaylovna Koskul]].{{sfn|Fomenko|2004a|p=14}} He was the great-great-great-great-grandson of poet [[Alexander Sumarokov]] and the Great Great Grandson of [[Field Marshal]] [[Mikhail Kutuzov]].<ref name=\"yusupov\" />{{ref label|ancestor|b|b}} He was the nephew of tennis player Count [[Pavel Sumarokov-Elston]], who was his first coach and doubles partner, grandson of Count-General [[Felix Sumarokov-Elston]], Governor of [[Kuban Oblast]], and cousin of the infamous Prince [[Felix Yussupov]], who later became known as one of the collaborators who conspired to kill [[Grigori Rasputin]], cult leader and mentor of Empress consort of Russia [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra]].<ref name=\"rusart\" /><ref name=\"yusupov\" /> Felix provided his own palace for the murder spot and also shot Rasputin once before murdering him with the help of his accomplices.<ref name=\"Rasputin\" /> Mikhail had a sister called Elena and a brother Nicholas. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004a|p=17}} At the age of twelve he had a surgery on his right hand, which as a result was rendered unsuitable for tennis and he later switched to left-hand play.<ref name=\"rusart\" /> First he moved to [[Dresden]] and was trained by [[Kurt Bergmann]] and [[George K. Logie]].<ref name=\"rusart\" /> In 1906 he entered the second-class tournament of the [[Bad Homburg]] Championships, where he defeated [[Jack Hillyard]] amongst many to claim his first title.<ref name=\"rusart\" /><ref name=\"Straits\" /> With this he set a record of being the youngest winner ever at the time in the history of the tournament.<ref name=\"Straits\" /> In 1908 his father and brother died within two weeks of each other. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004a|p=19}} He moved back to his homeland and graduated first at the [[Annenschule]]{{sfn|Fomenko|2004a|p=21}} then at the Law Faculty of the [[Saint Petersburg State University|St. Petersburg University]].{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=75}}\n\nHe volunteered for the Russian [[Red Cross]] motorized ambulance unit at the outbreak of [[World War I]],{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=86}} and was assigned to the [[Black Sea Fleet]].{{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=87}} Her mother died on 3 April 1915.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=89}} He was invalided out of the military service on 26 November 1916 and travelled home to St. Petersburg.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=89}} Mikhail was arrested for a couple of days by the [[Bolsheviks]], but released because of disagreement among the people who detained him.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=94}} The family permanently emigrated from Russia in the midst of the [[Russian Revolution]], which emerged from the social fallback of the World War.<ref name=\"smsport\" /><ref name=\"rustennisfame\" /> First they fled to [[Koreiz]] where they were joined by fugitive [[Felix Yussupov]] who had been freed from his house arrest due to his involvement in the Rasputin murder.<ref name=\"rusart\" /><ref name=\"Rasputin\" /> They agreed to join the [[White Army]], but General [[Anton Denikin]] refused the request because the princes had ties to the Imperial dynasty. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=94}}\nThey sailed to [[Malta]] on 13 April 1919 aboard the British battleship {{HMS|Marlborough|1912|6}}, which also transported several other Russian nobility exiles, including [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Empress Maria Feodorovna]].<ref name=\"rusart\" />{{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=95}} From there they moved to [[Rome]].{{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=99}} In 1920 he further moved to [[Nice]], where he lived for 17 more years. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=102}}\n\n==Tennis career==\nMikhail Sumarokov-Elston was an eight-time national tennis champion, and also a two-time national indoors champion.<ref name=\"rusart\" /><ref name=\"smsport\" /> He was successful in singles five consecutive times between 1910\u201314, two more time in mixed doubles and also a doubles champion.<ref name=\"smsport\" /> He is still the youngest All-Russia champion to date with his 14 years of age at the time of his first triump. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004a|p=26}} He won his first indoor trophy in 1911 in St. Petersburg. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004a|p=27}}On international level his first main tournament was the 1905 Bad Homburg Cup (of which he won the second-class edition) but lost in the second round to [[Irving Wright]].<ref name=\"spalding\" /> The next year at the [[Wiesbaden]] Championships, where he \u2013 still an adolescent \u2013 was forced to withdraw from the second round after beating Herr von Parpart in the kick-off round.<ref name=\"rusart\" /> He played in several other tournaments throughout Germany, France and Switzerland before returning to Russia.<ref name=\"rusart\" /> There he won city tournaments in Moscow and [[St. Petersburg]].<ref name=\"rustennisfame\" /> Altogether he was crowned two-time St. Petersburg champion in 1912 and 1914 and two-time Moscow champion in 1910 counting the singles and doubles.<ref name=\"rusart\" />\n\nOnly a week after his first St. Petersburg title Sumarokov traveled to [[Sweden]] to participate in the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] with veteran player [[Aleksandr Alenitsyn]]. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=37}} That tournament was also his only preparation for the games as he had to pass his high school diploma exams prior. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=37}} The Olympic draw suffered a setback on expected entries of well-known players due to scheduling conflicts with the [[1912 Wimbledon Championships]]. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=40}} Even Alenitsyn withdrew from the singles outdoor event before its start.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=40}} The first match against the Swedish champion [[Carl Setterwall]] saw an easy two set lead for Sumarokov the third was taken by Sweden after a twenty-game tie and the fourth last set was secured by Russia.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=41}} In the next round [[1912 French Championships]] finalist Oscar Kreuzer waited for his opponent.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=41}} The match, which was witnessed by [[Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia (1890\u20131958)|Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna]] had a back-and-forth fight so fierce that Sumarokov torn the strings of his racquet and had to change it but that could't save him from losing to the German in four sets.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=42}} He found consolation in the doubles tournament where he and Alenitsyn reached the quarterfinals.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=43}}\n\nThe first Russian Championships opened for foreign player registration were held for the first time in 1912.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=43}}  Among the non-Russian entrants were [[Ludwig von Salm-Hoogstraeten]], [[Harold Kitson]] and [[Einer Ulrich]].{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|pp=43-44}} The first of these big tests came in the semifinals against Count Salm. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=44}}The Austrian lost in straight sets only showing resistance in the second. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=44}} The final match should have been a showdown between Kitson and Sumarokov but lasted short.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=45}} After Sumarokov scored the first set 6:3 Kitson got frustrated, complained to the chair umpire, grabbed his towel and left the court citing a right hand injury, which resulted in a walkover home victory.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=45}} He became the undisputed champion after winning the doubles and mixed doubles as well with Count Salm and Ekaterina Hirschfeld respectively. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=46}}\n\n1913 started the same way as the year before, Mikhail had to pass his University exams so he had few chances to practise before setting out to [[Paris]] for the [[World Hard Court Championships]].{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=57}} There he advanced through the first round beating E. Chelli. In the second round he was drawn to face young French prodigy and reigning Olympic champion [[Andr\u00e9 Gobert]].{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=58}} It was a quick defeat as Sumarokov couldn't adapt to the fast-paced net-volley game of Gobert. He was also eliminated from the doubles contest in the very first round mostly due to his partner [[Paul Aym\u00e9]]'s leg injury, which he suffered the previous night and kept them handicapped the whole match. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=60}} Oddly it is thanks to these early exits that he was eligible for the consolation tournament, which was organized for the losers of the first two rounds. There he played his first match against one-half of his recent doubles opponents [[William le Maire de Warz\u00e9e d'Hermalle]] (who had a 6-1 head-to-head record against fellow Belgian Champion [[Paul de Borman]] at the time{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=63}}). {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=60}} This proved to be a tough warm-up for the later matches and it went two sets six-all before Elston broke through. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|pp=61-63}} His former doubles partner [[Paul Aym\u00e9]] resigned from the quarterfinal for unknown reasons and gave him a walkover. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=63}} In the semifinal came a pleasant surprise as the defending consolation title-holder [[Felix Pipes]] lost to him in two fast sets. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=63}} The final was a rematch from the Russian Championships with [[Ludwig von Salm-Hoogstraeten]].{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=63}} The day was struck with extreme heat so intense that it was dangerous to health. After a four set deuce the two finalists agreed to leave the decision to the drawing of lots and finish the match. The luck favored Salm and therefore he was announced the winner. The Cup was awarded to him but as soon as the chairman of the International Lawn Tennis Federation Henry Wallet realized that the winner's name was traditionally engraved onto the cup he reversed his decision and divided the prizes. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=64}}\n\nTwo weeks later Sumarokov was schedules to retain his title at the second annual Russian International Championships. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=66}} It had a star-loaded 136-competitor field with Frenchmen [[Maurice Germot]], [[Max Decugis]] and British [[Arthur Lowe (tennis)|Arthur Lowe]] and [[Charles P. Dixon]] all were present.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=66}} In the first semifinal Sumarokov encountered Germot and overcame him in three straight sets while in the other all-English semifinal Dixon triumphed over Lowe. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=67}} The final showed that the Russian player could stand the ground against world top ten challengers as well. From a two-one set disadvantage he closed the match with a two love-sets and kept his title after 2 hours 54 minutes battle. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|pp=68-69}} He then lost to Dixon in the first round of the doubles but beat him again for the mixed doubles title. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=69}}\n\nAlthough never played in the [[Davis Cup]] he represented Russia in the international matches against Great Britain and France in the last two consecutive years preceding the [[First World War]].<ref name=\"rusart\" /> First in 1913  against the England team of [[Roderick McNair]], [[Albert Prebble]], [[Arthur Lowe (tennis)|Arthur Lowe]] and [[Charles P. Dixon]].{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=70}} The two tennis federation agreed in a 12-match tie with 8 singles and 4 doubles rubbers.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=70}} Sumarokov was still exhausted from his recent Russian Championships final with Dixon and thus lost easily to Lowe and decided to step back from further participation and had to be replaced with inexperienced players.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=71}} As a consequence the Russian team lost. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=72}} This marked the first time that an official national tennis team was formed. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=73}}\n\nIn the 1914 Russian Championships he became a five-time champion after defeating [[Heinrich Kleinschroth]] in a five-set final. Curiosity of the Russian-German meeting was that the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Sarajevo regicide]] happened during the tournament (which later escalated into [[World War I]]) and Russia had sent an envoy to France to strengthen a possible alliance against the German Empire.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=80}} Just two weeks later the first Russia-France team match was held. It was agreed to follow [[Davis Cup]] rules and the French delegation was an all-Olympian squad of [[Maurice Germot]], [[Max Decugis]], [[Albert Canet]], [[\u00c9douard M\u00e9ny de Marangue]]{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|pp=83-84}} The team challenge was interrupted in the middle with the outbreak of World War I and the visitors only managed to get onto the last train home before Germany declared war on the [[Russian Empire]] on 19 July.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=85}}\n\nAfter the war he won the Malta Championships in 1919.<ref name=\"rusart\" /> The following year he clinched his first French title at the South of France Championships beating home favorite [[Alain Gerbault]] in a five-set final.<ref name=\"rusart\" /> The next year in [[Nice]] he was eliminated in the semifinal stage by [[Gordon Lowe]].<ref name=\"rusart\" /> However he did defend his South of France title by beating [[Giovanni Balbi de Robecco]] by only dropping two games.<ref name=\"rusart\" /> This was the first time he partnered [[Suzanne Lenglen]] for the mixed contest, which they won.<ref name=\"rusart\" />  In 1922 he was triumphant in Nice] as well, grabbing the singles trophy easily against [[Maurice F\u00e9rrier]].{{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=117}} He took the doubles as well with Gerbault. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=117}}He defended the South of France title for the second time against legendary [[Henri Cochet]] having had beaten [[Charles Aeschlimann]] on his way to the final.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=119}}<ref name=\"PetitNi\u00e7ois\" /> At the same tournament he also repeated his last year feat with Lenglen by overcoming [[Lord Rocksavage]] and [[Elizabeth Ryan]] in the mixed final.<ref name=\"rusart\" /><ref name=\"PetitNi\u00e7ois\" /> He almost celebrated his first triple crown trophy with his teammate Gerbault but fell short in the doubles final against Rocksavage-Cochet.<ref name=\"PetitNi\u00e7ois\" /> It is worth to note that it was the first time Sumarokov played on grass courts. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=124}} In 1923 the team of Sumarokov-Lenglen dropped the same title to [[Randolph Lycett]] and [[Elizabeth Ryan]].<ref name=\"rusart\" /> In 1931 at the Parc Imperial L.T.C. de Nice [[George Lyttleton-Rogers]] and his partner [[Rosie Berthet]] had an overwhelming victory over Sumarokov-Elston and Miss. J. Franks in the mixed final.<ref name=\"tennis&golf\" /> The same year he was also mixed doubles runner-up in two other tournaments at the New Court Lawn Tennis Club and Cannes Lawn Tennis Club losing both times.<ref name=\"rusart\" /> He reached the semifinals of the doubles and mixed in the Nice Tennis Club tournament.<ref name=\"figaro\" /> He won the Russian \u00c9migr\u00e9 Tennis Championships three consecutive times beginning from 1935.<ref name=\"rusart\" /> He turned professional in 1936.<ref name=\"rusart\" />\n\n===Playing style and equipment===\nHe played left-handed with a heavy topspin, after he had to give up his right-handed style due to a childhood injury.<ref name=\"rusart\" />\nHis left-hand serve was so rare that he gave exhibition matches in Germany to [[Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia]] and [[Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia (1863\u20131919)|Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia]].<ref name=\"Straits\" /> According to his contemporary coach Alexandr Stakhovich he was a baseline player with a formidable backhand.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=58}} Sumarokov played with Doherty, [[Slazenger]] and Driva racquets. In 1911 he changed to Maxim racquets. The manufacturer even released an autographed series of racquets with \"Sumarokov\" written on it with golden embossed letters. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004a|p=33}} Later he adjusted his game to putting a curl to the ball as well as hitting it hard and with a high trajectory as described by [[Henri Cochet]] in his book ''Tennis''. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=120}} He is thought to be the first who used this method, which became popular decades later, and being used by many players most notably [[Jimmy Connors]] and [[Guillermo Vilas]].{{sfn|Fomenko|2004c|p=120}}\n\n==Personal life==\nMikhail Sumarokov-Elston was well educated and at the age of thirteen he already spoke five languages.<ref name=\"Straits\" /> Apart from playing tennis he was an amateur [[chess]] player as well. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=76}} He was in a great relationship with Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]] and played tennis with a couple of times. {{sfn|Fomenko|2004b|p=49}}In 1913 he was elected an honorary member of the Stade Fran\u00e7ais in Paris.<ref name=\"rusart\" /> He married Natalia Nikolaevna Bellik in 1932.<ref name=\"rusart\" /><ref name=\"findagrave\" /> The next year she gave birth to their daughter Sofia.<ref name=\"rusart\" /> They moved to London in 1937, where led the Anglo-Russian Sports Club in [[Chiswick]].<ref name=\"rusart\" /> Died in the [[University College Hospital]] in 1970 and was buried in the [[Chiswick New Cemetery]].<ref name=\"rusart\" /><ref name=\"findagrave\" /> In 2002 he was inducted to the Russian Tennis Hall of Fame for his sport merits.<ref name=\"rusart\" /><ref name=\"smsport\" />\n\n==Notes==\n*{{note label|birth|a|a}} Sources differ regarding his birth date.{{sfn|Fomenko|2004a|p=15}} However his grave shows  {{OldStyleDate|November 21|1893|9 November}}.<ref name=\"findagrave\" />\n*{{note label|ancestor|b|b}} According to the newest researches the house of Kutuzov is not related to the House of Sumarokov by blood but only by adoption.<ref name=\"Kutuzov\" />\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

It is best to avoid swimming near mangrove areas or the mouths of creeks; swimming in the open ocean should be safe, but it is best to have a spotter around.\n\n==Religion==\nMost of the tribal people in Andaman and Nicobar Islands believe in a religion that can be described as a form of [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[Animism]].

[[Priyadarshan]]'s 1996 film ''[[Kaalapani (1996 film)|Kaalapani]]'' (Malayalam; ''[[Sirai Chaalai]]'' in Tamil) depicts the Indian freedom struggle and the lives of prisoners in the [[Cellular Jail]] in Port Blair.

Fares are high during the peak seasons of spring and winter, although fares have decreased over time due to the expansion of the civil aviation industry in India. Private flights are also allowed to land in Port Blair airport with prior permission.\n\nThere is also a ship service from Chennai, Visakhapatnam and Kolkata.

George Routledge and Sons, London.</ref> In 1855, the government proposed another settlement on the islands, including a [[Cellular Jail|convict establishment]], but the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] forced a delay in its construction. However, because the rebellion gave the British so many prisoners, it made the new Andaman settlement and prison urgently necessary. Construction began in November 1857 at Port Blair using inmates' labour, avoiding the vicinity of a salt swamp that seemed to have been the source of many of the earlier problems at Port Cornwallis.\n\n17 May 1859 was another major day for Andaman. The [[Battle of Aberdeen (Andaman Islands)|Battle of Aberdeen]] was fought between the [[Great Andamanese]] tribe and the British. Today, a memorial stands in Andaman water sports complex as a tribute to the people who lost their lives. Fearing foreign invasion and with help from an escaped convict from Cellular Jail, the Great Andamanese stormed the British post, but they were outnumbered and soon suffered heavy loss of life.

A principal character in the novel ''[[Six Suspects (novel)|Six Suspects]]'' by [[Vikas Swarup]] is from the Andaman Islands.\n\nBrodie Moncur, the main protagonist of [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd's]] 2018 novel ''Love is Blind'', spends time in the Andaman Islands in the early years of the 20th century.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe only commercial airport in the islands is [[Veer Savarkar International Airport]] in [[Port Blair]], which has scheduled services to [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]], [[New Delhi]], [[Bengaluru]], [[Visakhapatnam]] and [[Bhubaneswar]]. The airport is under the control of the [[Indian Navy]]. Prior to 2016 only daylight operations were allowed; however, since 2016 night flights have also operated.<ref>{{cite news|editor1=Roy, Sanjib Kumar|editor2=Sheekha, Andaman |title=Maiden night flight arrives in Isles|url=http://www.andamansheekha.com/2016/01/21/maiden-night-flight-arrives-in-isles-goair-flight-with-155-tourists-lands-at-vsi-airport-to-operate-chartered-flight-between-bengaluru-port-blair/|accessdate=21 January 2016|work= Andaman Sheekha|date=21 January 2016}}</ref> A small airstrip, about {{convert|1000|m|ft}} long, is located near the eastern shore of North Andaman near [[Diglipur]].\n\nDue to the length of the routes and the small number of airlines flying to the islands, fares have historically been relatively expensive, although cheaper for locals than visitors. Fares are high during the peak seasons of spring and winter, although fares have decreased over time due to the expansion of the civil aviation industry in India.\n\nThere is also a ship service from Chennai, Visakhapatnam and Kolkata. The journey requires three days and two nights, and depends on weather.\n\n==See also==\n<!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order & add a short description [[WP:SEEALSO]] -->\n* [[List of endemic birds of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]\n* [[List of trees of the Andaman Islands]]\n* [[Lists of islands]]\n<!-- please keep entries in alphabetical order -->\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Sources'''\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Andaman Islands|volume=1|pages=955\u2013958}}\n*[http://www.andamantravelagent.com/about-andaman History & Culture.
