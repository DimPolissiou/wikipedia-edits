It is best stored in the pod, as  exposed or ground seeds quickly lose their flavour. Grinding the pods and seeds together lowers both the quality and the price. For recipes requiring whole cardamom pods, a generally accepted equivalent is 10 pods equals {{frac|1|1|2}} teaspoons of ground cardamom.\n\nIt is a common ingredient in Indian cooking. It is also often used in [[baking]] in the [[Nordic countries]], in particular in [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], and [[Finland]], where it is used in traditional treats such as the Scandinavian Yule bread ''Julekake'', the Swedish ''kardemummabullar'' sweet bun, and Finnish sweet bread ''[[pulla]]''. In the [[Middle East]], green cardamom powder is used as a spice for sweet dishes, as well as traditional flavouring in coffee and tea. Cardamom is used to a wide extent in savoury dishes. In some Middle Eastern countries, coffee and cardamom are often ground in a wooden mortar, a ''[[mihbaj]]'', and cooked together in a skillet, a ''mehmas'', over wood or gas, to produce mixtures as much as 40% cardamom.\n\nIn Asia, both types of cardamom are widely used in both sweet and savory dishes, particularly in the south. Both are frequent components in spice mixes, such as Indian and Nepali [[Masala (spice)|masalas]] and Thai curry pastes. Green cardamom is often used in traditional [[Indian sweets]] and in ''[[masala chai]]'' (spiced tea). Both are also often used as a garnish in basmati rice and other dishes. Individual seeds are sometimes chewed and used in much the same way as chewing gum. It is used by confectionery giant [[Wrigley Company|Wrigley]]; its Eclipse Breeze Exotic Mint packaging indicates the product contains \"cardamom to neutralize the toughest breath odors\". It is also included in aromatic bitters, [[gin]], and [[herbal tea]]s.\n\nIn Korea, medicinal cardamom (''[[Amomum villosum]]'' var. ''xanthioides'') and black cardamom (''[[Amomum tsao-ko]]'') are used in traditional tea called ''[[jeho-tang]]''.\n\n===Composition===\n[[Image:CardamonEssOil.png|thumb|Cardamom (''E. cardamomum'') essential oil in clear glass vial]]\n\nThe content of essential oil in the seeds is strongly dependent on storage conditions, but may be as high as 8%.

''E. cardamomum'' (green cardamom) is used as a spice, a [[wikt:masticatory|masticatory]], and in medicine; it is also smoked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gardenguides.com/127456-uses-cardamom.html |title=The Uses of Cardamom |publisher=Garden Guides |date=2017-09-21 |accessdate=2018-05-29}}</ref> [[File:Cardamom (Kerala, India).jpg|thumb|A dried cardamom and a peeled one]]\n\n===Food and beverage===\n[[File:Spice shop in Kandy Market, Sri Lanka.jpg|thumb|Spice shop in Sri Lanka]]\n[[File:\u201cSpiced\u201d Tea \u2013 Flavoured by Cinnamon and Cardamom, Comilla, Bangladesh, 26 April 2014.jpg|thumb|Besides use as flavourant and spice in foods, cardamom-flavoured tea, also flavoured with [[cinnamon]], is consumed as a hot beverage in [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], and [[Pakistan]].]]\nCardamom has a strong, unique taste, with an intensely aromatic, resinous fragrance. Black cardamom has a distinctly more smoky, though not bitter, aroma, with a coolness some consider similar to mint.\n\nGreen cardamom is one of the most expensive spices by weight<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-cardamom-765160|title=Is Cardamom a Spice?|website=The Spruce Eats|access-date=2019-01-29}}</ref> but little is needed to impart flavour. It is best stored in the pod, as  exposed or ground seeds quickly lose their flavour. Grinding the pods and seeds together lowers both the quality and the price. For recipes requiring whole cardamom pods, a generally accepted equivalent is 10 pods equals {{frac|1|1|2}} teaspoons of ground cardamom.\n\nIt is a common ingredient in Indian cooking. It is also often used in [[baking]] in the [[Nordic countries]], in particular in [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], and [[Finland]], where it is used in traditional treats such as the Scandinavian Yule bread ''Julekake'', the Swedish ''kardemummabullar'' sweet bun, and Finnish sweet bread ''[[pulla]]''. In the [[Middle East]], green cardamom powder is used as a spice for sweet dishes, as well as traditional flavouring in coffee and tea. Cardamom is used to a wide extent in savoury dishes. In some Middle Eastern countries, coffee and cardamom are often ground in a wooden mortar, a ''[[mihbaj]]'', and cooked together in a skillet, a ''mehmas'', over wood or gas, to produce mixtures as much as 40% cardamom.\n\nIn Asia, both types of cardamom are widely used in both sweet and savory dishes, particularly in the south. Both are frequent components in spice mixes, such as Indian and Nepali [[Masala (spice)|masalas]] and Thai curry pastes. Green cardamom is often used in traditional [[Indian sweets]] and in ''[[masala chai]]'' (spiced tea). Both are also often used as a garnish in basmati rice and other dishes. Individual seeds are sometimes chewed and used in much the same way as chewing gum. It is used by confectionery giant [[Wrigley Company|Wrigley]]; its Eclipse Breeze Exotic Mint packaging indicates the product contains \"cardamom to neutralize the toughest breath odors\". It is also included in aromatic bitters, [[gin]], and [[herbal tea]]s.\n\nIn Korea, medicinal cardamom (''[[Amomum villosum]]'' var. ''xanthioides'') and black cardamom (''[[Amomum tsao-ko]]'') are used in traditional tea called ''[[jeho-tang]]''.\n\n===Composition===\n[[Image:CardamonEssOil.png|thumb|Cardamom (''E. cardamomum'') essential oil in clear glass vial]]\n\nThe content of essential oil in the seeds is strongly dependent on storage conditions, but may be as high as 8%.

[[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] is the monarch of sixteen Commonwealth realms ([[Antigua and Barbuda]]; the [[Commonwealth of Australia]]; the [[Commonwealth of the Bahamas]]; [[Barbados]]; [[Belize]]; [[Canada]]; [[Grenada]]; [[Jamaica]]; [[New Zealand]]; the [[Independent State of Papua New Guinea]]; the [[Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis]]; [[Saint Lucia]]; [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]; [[Solomon Islands]]; [[Tuvalu]]; and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]). They evolved out of the [[British Empire]] into fully independent states within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] that retain the Queen as head of state, unlike other Commonwealth countries that are either dependencies, republics or have a different royal house. All sixteen realms are constitutional monarchies and full democracies, where the Queen has limited powers or a largely ceremonial role.\n* '''Other European constitutional monarchies'''.\n**The [[Principality of Andorra]]; the [[Kingdom of Belgium]]; the [[Kingdom of Denmark]]; the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]]; the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]; the [[Kingdom of Norway]]; the [[Spain|Kingdom of Spain]]; and the [[Kingdom of Sweden]] are fully democratic states in which the monarch has a limited or largely ceremonial role.\n**Andorra is unique among all existing monarchies, as it is a [[diarchy]], with the Co-Princeship being shared by the [[President of France]] and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell|Bishop of Urgell]]. This arrangement creates a unique situation among monarchies, as a) neither Co-Prince is of Andorran descent, b) one is elected by common citizens of a foreign country (France), but not by Andorrans as they cannot vote in the French Presidential Elections, c) the other, the bishop of Urgell, is appointed by a foreign head of state, the Pope.\n* '''European mixed monarchies'''. [[Prince of Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]] and [[Prince of Monaco|Monaco]] are constitutional monarchies in which the Prince retains many powers of an absolute monarch. For example, the [[Liechtenstein constitutional referendum, 2003|2003 Constitution referendum]] gives the [[Prince of Liechtenstein]] the power to veto any law that the [[Landtag]] (parliament) proposes and vice versa. The Prince can hire or dismiss any elective member or government employee from his or her post. However, unlike an absolute monarch, the people can call for a referendum to end the Prince's reign. The [[Prince of Monaco]] has simpler powers: he cannot hire or dismiss any elective member or government employee from his or her post, but he can select the [[Minister of State of Monaco|minister of state]], [[Politics of Monaco|government council]] and judges.\n* <p>'''Muslim monarchies'''. These Muslim monarchs of the [[Kingdom of Bahrain]]; the [[Nation of Brunei, the Abode of Peace]]; the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]]; the [[State of Kuwait]]; the [[Kingdom of Morocco]]; the [[Sultanate of Oman]]; the [[State of Qatar]]; and the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]]; and the [[United Arab Emirates]] generally retain far more powers than their European or Commonwealth counterparts.</p><p>Absolute monarchs remain in the [[Nation of Brunei, the Abode of Peace]]; the Sultanate of Oman; the State of Qatar; and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Kingdom of Bahrain, and the State of Kuwait are classified as mixed, meaning there are representative bodies of some kind, but the monarch retains most of his powers. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, Malaysia, the Kingdom of Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates are constitutional monarchies, but their monarchs still retain more substantial powers than in European equivalents.</p>\n* '''East and Southeast Asian constitutional monarchies'''. The [[Kingdom of Bhutan]]; the [[Kingdom of Cambodia]]; [[Japan]]; and the [[Kingdom of Thailand]] have constitutional monarchies where the monarch has a limited or ceremonial role. Thailand changed from traditional absolute monarchy into a constitutional one during the twentieth century, while the Kingdom of Bhutan changed in 2008. The Kingdom of Cambodia had its own monarchy after independence from the [[French Colonial Empire]], which was deposed after the [[Khmer Rouge]] came into power. The monarchy was subsequently restored in the peace agreement of 1993.\n* '''Other monarchies'''. Five monarchies do not fit into one of the above groups by virtue of geography or class of monarchy: the [[Kingdom of Tonga]] in [[Polynesia]]; [[Eswatini|Kingdom of Eswatini (Swaziland)]] and the [[Kingdom of Lesotho]] in [[Africa]]; and the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] (S.M.O.M.), and the [[Vatican City State]] in [[Europe]]. Of these, the Kingdom of Lesotho and the Kingdom of Tonga are constitutional monarchies, while the Kingdom of Eswatini and the Vatican City State are absolute monarchies. The Kingdom of Eswatini is increasingly being considered a [[diarchy]]. The King, or [[Ngwenyama]], rules alongside his mother, the [[Ndlovukati]], as dual heads of state originally designed to be checks on political power. The Ngwenyama, however, is considered the administrative head of state, while the Ndlovukati is considered the spiritual and national head of state, a position which has become largely symbolic in recent years.  S.M.O.M. is governed by an elected [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Prince and Grand Master]].  The [[Pope]] is the absolute monarch of the Vatican by virtue of his position as head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and Bishop of Rome; he is an elected rather than hereditary ruler. The Pope need not be a citizen of the territory prior to [[Papal conclave|his election by the cardinals]].\n\n==Lines of succession==\n{{anchor|Oldest extant monarchies}}\nSome of the extant sovereign monarchies have lines of succession that go back to the medieval period or antiquity:  \n*The [[kings of Cambodia]] claim descent from [[Queen Soma]] (1st century), although the historiographical record is interrupted in the \"[[Post-Angkor Period]]\" (15th/16th centuries). A real unified [[Khmer Empire|kingdom of Cambodia]] first came to existence in 802. The monarchy in Cambodia was abolished between 1970 and 1993.\n*There exists several suggestions to a possible line of succession in the Danish monarchy from the late 7th century and until [[Gorm the Old]], but none of these suggestions have so far won universal acceptance. Most monarchs in [[Monarchy of Denmark|Denmark]] since the 940s have been [[Lineal descendant|descendants]] of Gorm the Old's father [[Harthacnut I of Denmark|Harthacnut]] and '''''all''''' monarchs in Denmark since 1047 have been [[Lineal descendant|descendants]] of titular [[Queen mother|Queen]] [[Estrid Svendsdatter]]. A formal [[Order of succession|law of succession]] was not adapted in Denmark until [[Absolute monarchy#Denmark\u2013Norway|1665]].\n*[[Japan]], considered a [[constitutional monarchy]] under the [[Imperial House of Japan]], is said to be the world's oldest extant continuous hereditary monarchy,<ref>{{cite news|author1=D.M.|title=Why is the Japanese monarchy under threat?|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/06/economist-explains-0|accessdate=4 June 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=2 June 2017}}</ref> with a traditional origin in [[Emperor Jimmu|660 BC]], commonly accepted archaeological and cultural evidence from the [[Kofun period#Yamato court|3rd century]] and reliable historiographical evidence from at least the [[Emperor Kinmei|6th century]]. \n*The monarchs of the [[Hereditary Kingdom of Norway|kingdom of Norway]] by virtue of descent from [[Harald I Fairhair]], who [[Unification of Norway|united the realm]] in 872. Harald as a member of the [[House of Yngling]] is given a partly legendary line of succession from earlier petty kings in historiographical tradition. Far from all monarchs of Norway since the 930s have been [[Lineal descendant|descendants]] of Harald Fairhair (at least 7 or 8 Norwegian kings from the period c. 970 \u2013 1859 weren't descendants of Harald Fairhair).\n*The [[kings of Spain]] via descent from the [[Catholic Monarchs]] (via the [[Habsburg Spain|House of Habsburg]]), ultimately combining the lines of succession of [[Sancho II of Castile and Le\u00f3n|Castile and Le\u00f3n]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], realms established in the  10th to 11th centuries in the course of the ''[[Reconquista]]'', via the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] claiming descent from the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] (which, originally ruled by the [[Thervingi]] kings, had become elective in the 6th century). The monarchy of Spain was abolished twice in the 19th & 20th centuries (1873-1874 and 1931-1947) and replaced by republics.\n*The monarchs of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth realms [[Succession to the British throne|inherit the throne]] by virtue of the line of descent from the [[House of Stuart]] ([[Union of the Crowns]] 1603), combining the lines of succession of the kingdoms of [[kingdom of England|England]] and [[kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] going back to the 9th century. The succession to the English throne can be argued to originate with the [[House of Wessex]], established in the [[Cerdic|6th century]]; that to the Scottish throne with descent from [[List of kings of the Picts|Pictish kings]] which likewise enter the historical record around the 6th century. The line of succession and descent of the Scottish throne are unbroken, whereas the English throne shifted between several unrelated dynasties/families between 1013 and 1066. The monarchy of England was abolished in 1649 and that of Scotland in 1652 and replaced by various types of [[Republicanism|republican]] governments between the years [[Interregnum (1649\u20131660)|1649 to 1660]].\n\n==Current monarchies==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!style=\"text-align:left\"|[[Monarchy]]\n!style=\"text-align:left\"|Official local name\n!style=\"text-align:left\"|Title of Head of State\n!style=\"text-align:left\"|Title of Head of Government\n!style=\"text-align:left\"|Type of Monarchy\n!style=\"text-align:left\"|Succession\n!style=\"text-align:left\"| {{longitem|Current<br/>constitution}}\n|-\n|{{flag|Principality of Andorra}} <ref name=\"CIAAndorra\">{{cite web|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/an.html|title=   Europe :: Andorra|publisher= CIA The World Factbook}}</ref>\n|In [[Catalan language|Catalan]];

[[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] is the monarch of sixteen Commonwealth realms ([[Antigua and Barbuda]]; the [[Commonwealth of Australia]]; the [[Commonwealth of the Bahamas]]; [[Barbados]]; [[Belize]]; [[Canada]]; [[Grenada]]; [[Jamaica]]; [[New Zealand]]; the [[Independent State of Papua New Guinea]]; the [[Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis]]; [[Saint Lucia]]; [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]; [[Solomon Islands]]; [[Tuvalu]]; and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]). They evolved out of the [[British Empire]] into fully independent states within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] that retain the Queen as head of state, unlike other Commonwealth countries that are either dependencies, republics or have a different royal house. All sixteen realms are constitutional monarchies and full democracies, where the Queen has limited powers or a largely ceremonial role.\n* '''Other European constitutional monarchies'''.\n**The [[Principality of Andorra]]; the [[Kingdom of Belgium]]; the [[Kingdom of Denmark]]; the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]]; the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]; the [[Kingdom of Norway]]; the [[Spain|Kingdom of Spain]]; and the [[Kingdom of Sweden]] are fully democratic states in which the monarch has a limited or largely ceremonial role.\n**Andorra is unique among all existing monarchies, as it is a [[diarchy]], with the Co-Princeship being shared by the [[President of France]] and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell|Bishop of Urgell]]. This arrangement creates a unique situation among monarchies, as a) neither Co-Prince is of Andorran descent, b) one is elected by common citizens of a foreign country (France), but not by Andorrans as they cannot vote in the French Presidential Elections, c) the other, the bishop of Urgell, is appointed by a foreign head of state, the Pope.\n* '''European mixed monarchies'''. [[Prince of Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]] and [[Prince of Monaco|Monaco]] are constitutional monarchies in which the Prince retains many powers of an absolute monarch. For example, the [[Liechtenstein constitutional referendum, 2003|2003 Constitution referendum]] gives the [[Prince of Liechtenstein]] the power to veto any law that the [[Landtag]] (parliament) proposes and vice versa. The Prince can hire or dismiss any elective member or government employee from his or her post. However, unlike an absolute monarch, the people can call for a referendum to end the Prince's reign. The [[Prince of Monaco]] has simpler powers: he cannot hire or dismiss any elective member or government employee from his or her post, but he can select the [[Minister of State of Monaco|minister of state]], [[Politics of Monaco|government council]] and judges.\n* <p>'''Muslim monarchies'''. These Muslim monarchs of the [[Kingdom of Bahrain]]; the [[Nation of Brunei, the Abode of Peace]]; the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]]; the [[State of Kuwait]]; the [[Kingdom of Morocco]]; the [[Sultanate of Oman]]; the [[State of Qatar]]; and the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]]; and the [[United Arab Emirates]] generally retain far more powers than their European or Commonwealth counterparts.</p><p>Absolute monarchs remain in the [[Nation of Brunei, the Abode of Peace]]; the Sultanate of Oman; the State of Qatar; and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Kingdom of Bahrain, and the State of Kuwait are classified as mixed, meaning there are representative bodies of some kind, but the monarch retains most of his powers. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, Malaysia, the Kingdom of Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates are constitutional monarchies, but their monarchs still retain more substantial powers than in European equivalents.</p>\n* '''East and Southeast Asian constitutional monarchies'''. The [[Kingdom of Bhutan]]; the [[Kingdom of Cambodia]]; and the [[Kingdom of Thailand]] have constitutional monarchies where the monarch has a limited or ceremonial role. Thailand changed from traditional absolute monarchy into a constitutional one during the twentieth century, while the Kingdom of Bhutan changed in 2008. The Kingdom of Cambodia had its own monarchy after independence from the [[French Colonial Empire]], which was deposed after the [[Khmer Rouge]] came into power. The monarchy was subsequently restored in the peace agreement of 1993.\n* '''Other monarchies'''. Five monarchies do not fit into one of the above groups by virtue of geography or class of monarchy: the [[Kingdom of Tonga]] in [[Polynesia]]; [[Eswatini|Kingdom of Eswatini (Swaziland)]] and the [[Kingdom of Lesotho]] in [[Africa]]; and the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] (S.M.O.M.), and the [[Vatican City State]] in [[Europe]]. Of these, the Kingdom of Lesotho and the Kingdom of Tonga are constitutional monarchies, while the Kingdom of Eswatini and the Vatican City State are absolute monarchies. The Kingdom of Eswatini is increasingly being considered a [[diarchy]]. The King, or [[Ngwenyama]], rules alongside his mother, the [[Ndlovukati]], as dual heads of state originally designed to be checks on political power. The Ngwenyama, however, is considered the administrative head of state, while the Ndlovukati is considered the spiritual and national head of state, a position which has become largely symbolic in recent years.  S.M.O.M. is governed by an elected [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Prince and Grand Master]].  The [[Pope]] is the absolute monarch of the Vatican by virtue of his position as head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and Bishop of Rome; he is an elected rather than hereditary ruler. The Pope need not be a citizen of the territory prior to [[Papal conclave|his election by the cardinals]].\n\n==Lines of succession==\n{{anchor|Oldest extant monarchies}}\nSome of the extant sovereign monarchies have lines of succession that go back to the medieval period or antiquity:  \n*The [[kings of Cambodia]] claim descent from [[Queen Soma]] (1st century), although the historiographical record is interrupted in the \"[[Post-Angkor Period]]\" (15th/16th centuries). A real unified [[Khmer Empire|kingdom of Cambodia]] first came to existence in 802. The monarchy in Cambodia was abolished between 1970 and 1993.\n*There exists several suggestions to a possible line of succession in the Danish monarchy from the late 7th century and until [[Gorm the Old]], but none of these suggestions have so far won universal acceptance. Most monarchs in [[Monarchy of Denmark|Denmark]] since the 940s have been [[Lineal descendant|descendants]] of Gorm the Old's father [[Harthacnut I of Denmark|Harthacnut]] and '''''all''''' monarchs in Denmark since 1047 have been [[Lineal descendant|descendants]] of titular [[Queen mother|Queen]] [[Estrid Svendsdatter]]. A formal [[Order of succession|law of succession]] was not adapted in Denmark until [[Absolute monarchy#Denmark\u2013Norway|1665]].\n*[[Japan]], considered a [[constitutional monarchy]] under the [[Imperial House of Japan]], is said to be the world's oldest extant continuous hereditary monarchy,<ref>{{cite news|author1=D.M.|title=Why is the Japanese monarchy under threat?|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/06/economist-explains-0|accessdate=4 June 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=2 June 2017}}</ref> with a traditional origin in [[Emperor Jimmu|660 BC]], commonly accepted archaeological and cultural evidence from the [[Kofun period#Yamato court|3rd century]] and reliable historiographical evidence from at least the [[Emperor Kinmei|6th century]]. \n*The monarchs of the [[Hereditary Kingdom of Norway|kingdom of Norway]] by virtue of descent from [[Harald I Fairhair]], who [[Unification of Norway|united the realm]] in 872. Harald as a member of the [[House of Yngling]] is given a partly legendary line of succession from earlier petty kings in historiographical tradition. Far from all monarchs of Norway since the 930s have been [[Lineal descendant|descendants]] of Harald Fairhair (at least 7 or 8 Norwegian kings from the period c. 970 \u2013 1859 weren't descendants of Harald Fairhair).\n*The [[kings of Spain]] via descent from the [[Catholic Monarchs]] (via the [[Habsburg Spain|House of Habsburg]]), ultimately combining the lines of succession of [[Sancho II of Castile and Le\u00f3n|Castile and Le\u00f3n]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], realms established in the  10th to 11th centuries in the course of the ''[[Reconquista]]'', via the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] claiming descent from the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] (which, originally ruled by the [[Thervingi]] kings, had become elective in the 6th century). The monarchy of Spain was abolished twice in the 19th & 20th centuries (1873-1874 and 1931-1947) and replaced by republics.\n*The monarchs of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth realms [[Succession to the British throne|inherit the throne]] by virtue of the line of descent from the [[House of Stuart]] ([[Union of the Crowns]] 1603), combining the lines of succession of the kingdoms of [[kingdom of England|England]] and [[kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] going back to the 9th century. The succession to the English throne can be argued to originate with the [[House of Wessex]], established in the [[Cerdic|6th century]]; that to the Scottish throne with descent from [[List of kings of the Picts|Pictish kings]] which likewise enter the historical record around the 6th century. The line of succession and descent of the Scottish throne are unbroken, whereas the English throne shifted between several unrelated dynasties/families between 1013 and 1066. The monarchy of England was abolished in 1649 and that of Scotland in 1652 and replaced by various types of [[Republicanism|republican]] governments between the years [[Interregnum (1649\u20131660)|1649 to 1660]].\n\n==Current monarchies==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!style=\"text-align:left\"|[[Monarchy]]\n!style=\"text-align:left\"|Official local name\n!style=\"text-align:left\"|Title of Head of State\n!style=\"text-align:left\"|Title of Head of Government\n!style=\"text-align:left\"|Type of Monarchy\n!style=\"text-align:left\"|Succession\n!style=\"text-align:left\"| {{longitem|Current<br/>constitution}}\n|-\n|{{flag|Principality of Andorra}} <ref name=\"CIAAndorra\">{{cite web|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/an.html|title=   Europe :: Andorra|publisher= CIA The World Factbook}}</ref>\n|In [[Catalan language|Catalan]];
