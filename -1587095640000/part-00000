Many thousands of variants exist; the 2007 catalogue ''The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants'' estimates that there are well over 2,000, with the author noting that many more known variants were considered too trivial for inclusion.{{sfnp|Pritchard|2000|p=8|ps=: \"Most published ones (but none described here), are, in truth, forgettable.\"}} \n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n|\n|rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|nd|rd\n|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl\n|rl|nl|bl|ql|kl|bl|nl|rl\n| Standard chess\n}}\n\n==Chess-derived games==\n{{Dynamic list}}\nThese chess variants are derived from chess by changing the board, board setup, pieces, or rules.\n\n===Orthodox chess rules===\nMany variants employ standard chess rules and mechanics, but vary the starting position of the pieces or number of pieces.\n\n====Orthodox rules on a standard 8\u00d78 board====\n\n=====Different starting position=====\nThese variants use standard boards and pieces, but the pieces start on nontraditional squares. In most such variants, the pawns are placed on their usual squares, but the position of other pieces is either randomly determined or selected by the players. The motivation for these variants is usually to nullify established [[chess opening|opening]] knowledge. The downside of these variants is that the initial position usually has less harmony and balance than the standard chess position.{{sfnp|Pritchard|2000|p=18}}\n{| style=\"float:right;\"  border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n |-valign=\"top\"\n |\n{{Chess diagram\n |tright\n |\n |bd|nd|rd|bd|nd|kd|rd|qd\n |pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd\n | | | | | | | | \n | | | | | | | | \n | | | | | | | | \n | | | | | | | | \n |pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl\n |bl|nl|rl|bl|nl|kl|rl|ql\n |'''[[Chess960]]''', one of the 960 possible starting positions\n}}\n|\n{{Chess diagram\n |tright\n |\n |rl|nl|bl|kl|ql|bl|nl|rl\n |pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl\n | | | | | | | | \n | | | | | | | | \n | | | | | | | | \n | | | | | | | | \n |pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd\n |rd|nd|bd|kd|qd|bd|nd|rd\n |'''Upside-down chess''' starting position (White sits at bottom)\n}}\n|}\n\n* '''[[Chess960]]''' (or '''Fischer Random Chess'''): The placement of the pieces on the first [[rank (chess)|rank]] is randomised, with the opponent's pieces mirroring it. Invented by [[Bobby Fischer]] (1996).\n* '''[[Displacement chess]]''': Some pieces in the initial position are exchanged but the rules remain exactly the same. Some examples of this may be that the king and queen are flipped, or the knight on the b-[[file (chess)|file]] is traded with the bishop on the f-file.\n* '''Pre-chess''': The game starts with white and black pawns set as usual, but the initial position of other pieces is selected by the players. White first places one of his pieces on his first rank, and then Black does the same. Players continue to alternate in this manner until all pieces have been placed, with the only restriction being that bishops must be on opposite-colour squares. The game then proceeds in the usual way. Proposed by [[Pal Benko]] in 1978.{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=77}}\n* '''[[Transcendental Chess]]''': Similar to [[Chess960]], but the opening white and black positions do not mirror each other.\n* '''Upside-down chess''': The white and black pieces are switched so that White's pieces are on the 8th rank, with pawns on the 7th rank, one step away from promotion. The starting position looks like a standard chess starting position, but from the other player's perspective. As the pawns are blocked by pieces in the starting position, the game always starts with a knight move, and smother checkmates are common.<ref>[http://www.chessvariants.org/diffsetup.dir/upside.html Upside-down chess] by [[Hans Bodlaender]]</ref>\n\n=====Different number of pieces=====\nThese variants use standard chess pieces on a standard board, but players begin with unorthodox numbers of pieces. For example, starting with multiple queens or fewer pawns. Many such games use unbalanced starting positions, with one player having more or less of a particular piece than the other player.\n* '''Charge of the Light Brigade''': Apart from the usual king and pawns, one side has three queens and the other has seven knights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessvariants.com/invention/charge-of-the-light-brigade |title=Charge of the Light Brigade |last=Muller |first=H.G. |publisher=[[The Chess Variant Pages]] |date=2015-02-27 |accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref>\n* '''[[Dunsany's Chess]]''' (and the similar '''Horde chess'''): One side has standard chess pieces, and the other side has 32 pawns.\n* '''Endgame chess''' (or '''The Pawns Game'''): Players start the game with only pawns and a king. Normal check, checkmate, ''[[en passant]]'', and pawn promotion rules apply.{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=72}}\n* '''[[Chess handicap|Handicap chess]]''' (or '''Chess with odds'''): Variations to equalise chances of players with different strength.\n* '''Peasants' Revolt''': White has a king and eight pawns (the peasants) against Black's king, pawn, and four knights (the nobles). Black has the advantage. To narrow the contest, the game has also been played with three knights (on b8, c8, and g8) instead of four. By R. L. Frey (1947).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessvariants.org/large.dir/peasantrevolt.html |title=Peasant Revolt |last=Whelan |first=George |publisher=[[The Chess Variant Pages]] |date=2003-03-10 |accessdate=2014-01-21}}</ref>{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=76}}\n* '''Sixteen Pawns''': White plays without his queen, but chooses where on the third and fourth ranks to place eight extra pawns. By [[Legall de Kermeur]] (18th century). [[Alexandre Deschapelles]] and [[Louis-Charles Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais]] later established that eight extra pawns favour White too much, and hence played the game with only five, six, or seven extra pawns for White instead.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chessvariants.com/unequal.dir/16pawns.html | title=Sixteen Pawns}}</ref>\n* '''[[Really Bad Chess]]''': A [[mobile video game]] by [[Zach Gage]]; Each player has one king and fifteen other pieces selected at random. \n* '''Weak!''': White has the usual pieces, Black has one king, seven knights, and sixteen pawns.

Invented by Grigorevich Shafran (1939).\n* '''[[Spherical chess]]''': A family of variants played on a chessboard wrapped around a sphere. The a- and h-files are adjacent. The poles are circular or octagonal and may or may not be occupied according to the variant. There are no board edges, so kings always have eight adjacent squares. Trans-polar diagonal moves mostly differentiate between variants.{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=223|ps=}}{{sfnp|Pritchard|1994|pp=285\u201386|ps=}}\n\n===Unorthodox rules with traditional pieces===\nThese variants introduce changes in the mechanics of the game, such as movement of pieces, rules for capturing, or winning conditions, using standard chess pieces.\n\n====Unorthodox rules on a standard 8\u00d78 board====\n* '''Absorption chess''' (also called '''cannibal chess''', '''power absorption chess''', or '''seizer's chess'''): Pieces gain the abilities of the pieces they capture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chessvariants.com/difftaking.dir/cannibal.html|title=Cannibal Chess and Absorption Chess}} ''[[The Chess Variant Pages]]''</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://chess.computerwebservices.net/power.php |title=Power Absorption Chess |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Chess Variants |publisher=Computer Web Services}}</ref>\n* '''[[Andernach chess]]''': A piece making a capture changes colour.\n* '''[[Atomic chess]]''': Capture on any square results in an \"atomic explosion\" which kills (i.e. removes from the game) all pieces in the eight surrounding squares, except for pawns.\n* '''[[Beirut Chess]]''': Players secretly equip one of their men with a \"bomb\", which can be detonated at any time, wiping out all pieces on surrounding squares.

All pieces are placed randomly, except for the knights.\n}}\n|}\n\nSimilar to [[Patience (game)|solitaire]], there are a few chess variants for a single player. Unlike [[chess puzzle]]s, these variants have a random starting position. Some of these are similar to [[Mathematical chess problem#Permutation problems|permutation chess problems]], for example the game '''Queen's Quadrille''', which was invented by Karen Robinson in 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chessvariants.com/solitaire.dir/quadrille.html|title=Queen's Quadrille|website=www.chessvariants.com}}</ref> All chess pieces (except pawns) are randomly placed on a 4\u00d74 board. Then one of the queens is removed and the game is started. Pieces move as usual, however capturing is not allowed. A player can move white and black pieces in any order, without regard for colour. The goal is to move the queen along a predetermined pattern; for example from one corner to the other, or visit all squares on the board only once. The same idea is found in the game '''Hippodrome''', which was invented by Andy Lewicki in 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chessvariants.com/solitaire.dir/hippodrome.html|title=Hippodrome|website=www.chessvariants.com}}</ref> The initial position is obtained by placing four knights on the first row and all other pieces from a chess set (except pawns) on the remaining fields. Then one of the pieces (except knights) is removed and the game is started. The goal is to move all knights to the opposite rank.\n\nIn 1998 Robinson also invented a game which Hans Bodlaender named '''Chess Contradance''', as the setup is like a contradance with the two lines facing each other.  The pieces are setup as in regular chess, but without pawns. The first and eighth ranks are safe havens, i.e., no piece can be captured on these ranks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the pieces such that all pieces move to the opposite back row without ever putting any piece in danger of being captured. Black and White alternate moves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chessvariants.com/solitaire.dir/squaredance.html|title=Chess Contradance|website=www.chessvariants.com}}</ref>\n\n===Variants for more than two people {{anchor|Multiplayer variants}}===\n[[File:Bughouse game.jpg|right|thumb|275px|'''[[Bughouse chess]]''', the game in progress]]\n* '''[[Bosworth (game)|Bosworth]]''': A four-player variant played on 6\u00d76 board.

Allies use opposite colours and give captured pieces to their partner.

The team may discuss and play alternative moves freely.\n* '''[[Djambi]]''': Can be played by four players on a 9\u00d79 board and four sets of special pieces. Pieces can capture or move those of an adversary. Captured pieces are not removed from the board, but turned upside down. There are variants for three or five players (''Pentachiavel''). (1975)\n* '''[[Enochian chess]]''': A four-player variant with magical symbolism, associated with the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].\n* '''[[Forchess]]''': A four-player variant using the standard board and two sets of standard pieces.\n* '''[[Fortress chess]]''': A four-player variant played in Russia in 18th and 19th centuries.\n* '''[[Four-player chess]]''' (or  '''Four-handed''', '''Four-man''', '''Four-way chess'''): Can be played by four people and uses a special board and four sets of differently coloured pieces.\n* '''[[Quatrochess]]''': A four-player variant, in addition to the standard chess army, each side controls a chancellor, archbishop, mann, wazir, fers, two camels, and two giraffes.

In most such variants, the pawns are placed on their usual squares, but the position of other pieces is either randomly determined or selected by the players. The motivation for these variants is usually to nullify established [[chess opening|opening]] knowledge. The downside of these variants is that the initial position usually has less harmony and balance than the standard chess position.{{sfnp|Pritchard|2000|p=18}}\n{| style=\"float:right;\"  border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n |-valign=\"top\"\n |\n{{Chess diagram\n |tright\n |\n |bd|nd|rd|bd|nd|kd|rd|qd\n |pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd\n | | | | | | | | \n | | | | | | | | \n | | | | | | | | \n | | | | | | | | \n |pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl\n |bl|nl|rl|bl|nl|kl|rl|ql\n |'''[[Chess960]]''', one of the 960 possible starting positions\n}}\n|\n{{Chess diagram\n |tright\n |\n |rl|nl|bl|kl|ql|bl|nl|rl\n |pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl\n | | | | | | | | \n | | | | | | | | \n | | | | | | | | \n | | | | | | | | \n |pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd\n |rd|nd|bd|kd|qd|bd|nd|rd\n |'''Upside-down chess''' starting position (White sits at bottom)\n}}\n|}\n\n* '''[[Chess960]]''' (or '''Fischer Random Chess'''): The placement of the pieces on the first [[rank (chess)|rank]] is randomised, with the opponent's pieces mirroring it. Invented by [[Bobby Fischer]] (1996).\n* '''[[Displacement chess]]''': Some pieces in the initial position are exchanged but the rules remain exactly the same. Some examples of this may be that the king and queen are flipped, or the knight on the b-[[file (chess)|file]] is traded with the bishop on the f-file.\n* '''Pre-chess''': The game starts with white and black pawns set as usual, but the initial position of other pieces is selected by the players. White first places one of his pieces on his first rank, and then Black does the same. Players continue to alternate in this manner until all pieces have been placed, with the only restriction being that bishops must be on opposite-colour squares. The game then proceeds in the usual way. Proposed by [[Pal Benko]] in 1978.{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=77}}\n* '''[[Transcendental Chess]]''': Similar to [[Chess960]], but the opening white and black positions do not mirror each other.\n* '''Upside-down chess''': The white and black pieces are switched so that White's pieces are on the 8th rank, with pawns on the 7th rank, one step away from promotion. The starting position looks like a standard chess starting position, but from the other player's perspective. As the pawns are blocked by pieces in the starting position, the game always starts with a knight move, and smother checkmates are common.<ref>[http://www.chessvariants.org/diffsetup.dir/upside.html Upside-down chess] by [[Hans Bodlaender]]</ref>\n\n=====Different number of pieces=====\nThese variants use standard chess pieces on a standard board, but players begin with unorthodox numbers of pieces. For example, starting with multiple queens or fewer pawns. Many such games use unbalanced starting positions, with one player having more or less of a particular piece than the other player.\n* '''Charge of the Light Brigade''': Apart from the usual king and pawns, one side has three queens and the other has seven knights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessvariants.com/invention/charge-of-the-light-brigade |title=Charge of the Light Brigade |last=Muller |first=H.G. |publisher=[[The Chess Variant Pages]] |date=2015-02-27 |accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref>\n* '''[[Dunsany's Chess]]''' (and the similar '''Horde chess'''): One side has standard chess pieces, and the other side has 32 pawns.\n* '''Endgame chess''' (or '''The Pawns Game'''): Players start the game with only pawns and a king.

Unlike [[chess puzzle]]s, these variants have a random starting position. Some of these are similar to [[Mathematical chess problem#Permutation problems|permutation chess problems]], for example the game '''Queen's Quadrille''', which was invented by Karen Robinson in 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chessvariants.com/solitaire.dir/quadrille.html|title=Queen's Quadrille|website=www.chessvariants.com}}</ref> All chess pieces (except pawns) are randomly placed on a 4\u00d74 board. Then one of the queens is removed and the game is started. Pieces move as usual, however capturing is not allowed. A player can move white and black pieces in any order, without regard for colour. The goal is to move the queen along a predetermined pattern; for example from one corner to the other, or visit all squares on the board only once. The same idea is found in the game '''Hippodrome''', which was invented by Andy Lewicki in 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chessvariants.com/solitaire.dir/hippodrome.html|title=Hippodrome|website=www.chessvariants.com}}</ref> The initial position is obtained by placing four knights on the first row and all other pieces from a chess set (except pawns) on the remaining fields. Then one of the pieces (except knights) is removed and the game is started. The goal is to move all knights to the opposite rank.\n\nIn 1998 Robinson also invented a game which Hans Bodlaender named '''Chess Contradance''', as the setup is like a contradance with the two lines facing each other.  The pieces are setup as in regular chess, but without pawns. The first and eighth ranks are safe havens, i.e., no piece can be captured on these ranks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the pieces such that all pieces move to the opposite back row without ever putting any piece in danger of being captured. Black and White alternate moves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chessvariants.com/solitaire.dir/squaredance.html|title=Chess Contradance|website=www.chessvariants.com}}</ref>\n\n===Variants for more than two people {{anchor|Multiplayer variants}}===\n[[File:Bughouse game.jpg|right|thumb|275px|'''[[Bughouse chess]]''', the game in progress]]\n* '''[[Bosworth (game)|Bosworth]]''': A four-player variant played on 6\u00d76 board.
