Located {{convert|530|km}} north of [[Thunder Bay]], highway access is via [[Ontario Highway 599|Highway 599]], the only access road to the town from the south. More northerly communities rely on [[winter road]]s for access and are cut off to land travel in the summer. Highway 599 meets the [[Northern Ontario Resource Trail]], formerly [[Highway 808 (Ontario)|Tertiary Highway 808]], at Pickle Lake.\n\nThe Township of Pickle Lake has a population of 425 and its main industries are transportation (by air and land) and tourism. [[Pickle Lake Airport]] serves as the supply point to northern [[First Nations]]. It is an access point for animal watching, with many opportunities to view moose, woodland caribou, timber wolf, black bear, game birds, bald eagles, song birds, and [[migratory birds]] such as ducks and geese. It is also a popular fishing and hunting destination. The town is sometimes referred to as the gateway to Ontario's \"Last Frontier\" because of its remote location. Pickle Lake has its own detachment of the [[Ontario Provincial Police]].\n\nThe community is located on the north-east shore of Pickle Lake, from which it takes its name. The city lies at similar latitudes to [[London|London, UK]], [[Berlin]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Calgary]] and [[Saskatoon]] but is much colder due to arctic air originating in [[Labrador]] and its inland location.\n\n==History==\nPickle Lake was founded as a local transportation centre for mining activities after gold was discovered nearby in 1928. From that time until 1995 over 2.5 million ounces of gold were produced in the area. Copper was also mined near Pickle Lake in the 1970s. Exploration for gold and copper in the Pickle Lake area continues to this day.\n\nJack Hammell's Pickle Crow Gold Mines (1935\u20131961) produced 1,446,214 ounces of gold.  Alex and Murdoch Mosher's Central Patricia Mine (1927\u20131951) produced 621,806 ounces.<ref name=\"Barnes1\">{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=Michael|title=Gold in Ontario|date=1995|publisher=The Boston Mills Press|location=Erin|isbn=155046146X|pages=85\u201389}}</ref>\n\nPickle Lake was incorporated as a township in 1980. It got its name from the shape of the lake which resembled a cucumber, or 'Pickle'.\n\nThe township also includes the former townsites of Central Patricia and Pickle Crow. Both formerly independent settlements, Central Patricia now consists only of a few buildings located at the terminus of Highway 599 within the township, while Pickle Crow is a [[ghost town]]. After the Pickle Crow gold mine was shut down in 1966, the [[Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario)|Ministry of Natural Resources]] set fire to the site as part of its program to clean up abandoned mines.<ref>[http://www.picklelake.ca/TownshipofPickleLake/BriefHistoryofPickleLake.aspx Brief History of Pickle Lake].</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Canada census\n |2016_population=388 | 2016_pop_delta=\u22128.7 | 2016_land_area=252.18 | 2016_pop_density=1.5\n |2016_median_age=32.0 | 2016_median_age_m=33.0 | 2016_median_age_f=30.0\n |2016_total_pvt_dwell=223 | 2016_mean_hh_income=80,896 | 2016_access_date=2019-06-06\n |2011_population=425 | 2011_pop_delta=\u221211.3 | 2011_land_area=255.08 | 2011_pop_density=1.7\n |2011_median_age=28.5 | 2011_median_age_m=28.2 | 2011_median_age_f=29.2\n |2011_total_pvt_dwell=225 | 2011_mean_hh_income= | 2011_access_date=2012-04-03\n |2006_population=479 | 2006_pop_delta=+20.1 | 2006_land_area=255.08 | 2006_pop_density=1.9\n |2006_median_age=30.2 | 2006_median_age_m=31.0 | 2006_median_age_f=28.5\n |2006_total_pvt_dwell=275 | 2006_mean_hh_income=43,499 | 2006_access_date=2011-06-28\n |2001_population=399 | 2001_pop_delta=\u221226.7 | 2001_land_area=255.08 | 2001_pop_density=1.6\n |2001_median_age=29.9 | 2001_median_age_m=28.3 | 2001_median_age_f=31.5\n |2001_total_pvt_dwell=253 | 2001_mean_hh_income=42,980 | 2001_access_date=2011-06-28\n}}\n\nHistoric populations:<ref name=\"cp2001\"/><ref>Statistics Canada: [[Canada 1996 Census]]</ref><ref name=\"statcan2011\"/><ref name=\"census2016\"/>\n* Population in 2016: 386 (\u22128.7% from 2011)\n* Population in 2011: 425 (\u221211.3% from 2006)\n* Population in 2006: 479 (+20.1% from 2001)\n* Population in 2001: 399\n* Population in 1996: 544\n* Population in 1991: 654\n\n==Climate==\nPickle Lake has a [[humid continental climate]] that closely borders on a [[subarctic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfb/Dfc'').

[[Pickle Lake Airport]] serves as the supply point to northern [[First Nations]]. It is an access point for animal watching, with many opportunities to view moose, woodland caribou, timber wolf, black bear, game birds, bald eagles, song birds, and [[migratory birds]] such as ducks and geese. It is also a popular fishing and hunting destination. The town is sometimes referred to as the gateway to Ontario's \"Last Frontier\" because of its remote location. Pickle Lake has its own detachment of the [[Ontario Provincial Police]].\n\nThe community is located on the north-east shore of Pickle Lake, from which it takes its name.\n\n==History==\nPickle Lake was founded as a local transportation centre for mining activities after gold was discovered nearby in 1928. From that time until 1995 over 2.5 million ounces of gold were produced in the area. Copper was also mined near Pickle Lake in the 1970s. Exploration for gold and copper in the Pickle Lake area continues to this day.\n\nJack Hammell's Pickle Crow Gold Mines (1935\u20131961) produced 1,446,214 ounces of gold.  Alex and Murdoch Mosher's Central Patricia Mine (1927\u20131951) produced 621,806 ounces.<ref name=\"Barnes1\">{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=Michael|title=Gold in Ontario|date=1995|publisher=The Boston Mills Press|location=Erin|isbn=155046146X|pages=85\u201389}}</ref>\n\nPickle Lake was incorporated as a township in 1980. It got its name from the shape of the lake which resembled a cucumber, or 'Pickle'.\n\nThe township also includes the former townsites of Central Patricia and Pickle Crow. Both formerly independent settlements, Central Patricia now consists only of a few buildings located at the terminus of Highway 599 within the township, while Pickle Crow is a [[ghost town]]. After the Pickle Crow gold mine was shut down in 1966, the [[Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario)|Ministry of Natural Resources]] set fire to the site as part of its program to clean up abandoned mines.<ref>[http://www.picklelake.ca/TownshipofPickleLake/BriefHistoryofPickleLake.aspx Brief History of Pickle Lake].</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Canada census\n |2016_population=388 | 2016_pop_delta=\u22128.7 | 2016_land_area=252.18 | 2016_pop_density=1.5\n |2016_median_age=32.0 | 2016_median_age_m=33.0 | 2016_median_age_f=30.0\n |2016_total_pvt_dwell=223 | 2016_mean_hh_income=80,896 | 2016_access_date=2019-06-06\n |2011_population=425 | 2011_pop_delta=\u221211.3 | 2011_land_area=255.08 | 2011_pop_density=1.7\n |2011_median_age=28.5 | 2011_median_age_m=28.2 | 2011_median_age_f=29.2\n |2011_total_pvt_dwell=225 | 2011_mean_hh_income= | 2011_access_date=2012-04-03\n |2006_population=479 | 2006_pop_delta=+20.1 | 2006_land_area=255.08 | 2006_pop_density=1.9\n |2006_median_age=30.2 | 2006_median_age_m=31.0 | 2006_median_age_f=28.5\n |2006_total_pvt_dwell=275 | 2006_mean_hh_income=43,499 | 2006_access_date=2011-06-28\n |2001_population=399 | 2001_pop_delta=\u221226.7 | 2001_land_area=255.08 | 2001_pop_density=1.6\n |2001_median_age=29.9 | 2001_median_age_m=28.3 | 2001_median_age_f=31.5\n |2001_total_pvt_dwell=253 | 2001_mean_hh_income=42,980 | 2001_access_date=2011-06-28\n}}\n\nHistoric populations:<ref name=\"cp2001\"/><ref>Statistics Canada: [[Canada 1996 Census]]</ref><ref name=\"statcan2011\"/><ref name=\"census2016\"/>\n* Population in 2016: 386 (\u22128.7% from 2011)\n* Population in 2011: 425 (\u221211.3% from 2006)\n* Population in 2006: 479 (+20.1% from 2001)\n* Population in 2001: 399\n* Population in 1996: 544\n* Population in 1991: 654\n\n==Climate==\nPickle Lake has a [[humid continental climate]] that closely borders on a [[subarctic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfb/Dfc'').

Retrieved 2011-02-18.</ref> The narrative centers around a professor who wakes up from a four-day long coma and sets out to prove his identity after no one recognizes him, including his own wife, and another man claims to be him.\n\nReleased in the United States on February 18, 2011, the film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $136 million against its $30 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nDr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) and his wife Liz (January Jones) arrive in [[Berlin]] for a [[biotechnology]] summit. At their [[Hotel Adlon|hotel]], as Liz goes to check in, Harris realizes he left his briefcase containing his passport at the airport and takes a taxi to retrieve it (without telling Liz). The taxi is involved in an accident and crashes into the River [[Spree]], knocking him unconscious. The driver rescues him but flees the scene. Harris regains consciousness at a hospital and learns he has been in a coma for four days.\n\nDesperate to find his wife, who he realizes doesn't know what happened to him, Harris returns to the hotel. There he discovers Liz with another man who she says is her husband and declares she does not know Harris. The police are called and he attempts to call a colleague named Cole (Frank Langella), to no avail. Stating he wants to go back to the hospital, he dodges the police but finds himself being followed. While on a train, he loses the man following him and writes down his schedule for the next day from memory. \n\nHarris is able to track Gina (Diane Kruger), the taxi driver who saved him, but she is an illegal [[Bosnia]]n immigrant and is afraid to help him. He then goes to  visit the office of Prof. Leo Bressler (Sebastian Koch), whom he is scheduled to meet, only to find \"Dr. Harris\" (Aidan Quinn) is already there. As Harris attempts to prove his identity, \"Harris\" provides identification and a family photo, both of which have his face. Overwhelmed by the [[identity crisis]], Harris falls unconscious and awakens back at the hospital. Smith (the man who was following him), an apparent assassin sent to target Harris, kills Gretchen Erfurt, Harris's attending nurse, but Harris escapes.\n\nHarris seeks help from Erfurt's friend, private investigator and former [[Stasi]] agent Ernst J\u00fcrgen (Bruno Ganz). Harris's only clues are his father's book on botany and Gina, who has been working at a diner since the crash. While Harris persuades her to help him, J\u00fcrgen researches Harris and the biotechnology summit, discovering it is to be attended by Prince Shada of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The prince is funding a secret project headed by Bressler, and has survived numerous assassination attempts. J\u00fcrgen suspects that the identity theft might be related.\n\nHarris and Gina are attacked in her apartment by Smith and another assassin, Jones; they escape after Gina kills Smith. In his book, Harris finds that Liz has written a series of numbers that correspond to words found on specific pages. Using his schedule, Harris confronts Liz alone; she tells him he got in the taxi because he left his briefcase at the airport and that she will meet him there. Meanwhile, J\u00fcrgen receives Cole at his office and reveals his findings about a secret assassination group known as Section 15. J\u00fcrgen deduces that Cole is a former mercenary and member of the group; knowing Cole is there to interrogate and kill him and with no way of escape, J\u00fcrgen commits suicide to protect Harris.\n\nAfter retrieving his briefcase, Gina parts ways with Harris. When she sees him kidnapped by Cole and Jones, she steals a taxi and follows them. When Harris awakes, Cole explains that \"Martin Harris\" is just a cover name created by Harris and Liz was his professional teammate. His head injury caused him to believe the persona was real; when Liz notified Cole of the injury, \"Harris\" was activated as his replacement. He continues to explain Harris is a trained assassin that they have to eliminate.  Gina drives up in time to save Harris, running over Jones before he can kill Harris, then rams the van Cole is in over a railing, killing him as well. During the commotion, Harris finds a hidden compartment in his briefcase containing two Canadian passports, remembering that he and Liz were in Berlin three months prior to plant a bomb in Prince Shada's suite.\n\nNow aware of his own role in the assassination plot, Martin seeks to redeem himself by thwarting it. Hotel security immediately hold Martin and Gina, but Martin proves his earlier visit to the hotel. After being convinced of the bomb's presence, security evacuates the hotel. Harris realizes that Prince Shada is not Section 15's target, but rather Bressler, who has developed a genetically modified breed of corn capable of surviving harsh climates. If Bressler is killed and his research is stolen, his findings would be worth billions of dollars should they fall into the wrong hands. Liz, who previously accessed Bressler's laptop and stole the data, tells \"Harris\" to complete their mission in getting rid of Bressler, while she disarms the bomb they no longer need. Unable to disarm it in time, Liz is blown up. During the evacuation, Harris stops \"Harris\" from killing Bressler and kills him, ending Section 15's plans for good. Gina finds Harris and they escape during the aftermath of the bombing.\n\nAs the bombing is identified as a failed assassination of Prince Shada, Bressler announces he is making his corn available to the world for free. As the announcement is televised, Harris and Gina board a train with new identities.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as Dr. Martin Harris\n* [[Diane Kruger]] as Gina\n* [[January Jones]] as Elizabeth \"Liz\" Harris\n* [[Aidan Quinn]] as Martin B\n* [[Frank Langella]] as Professor Rodney Cole\n* [[Bruno Ganz]] as Ernst J\u00fcrgen, a former [[Stasi]] operative\n* [[Sebastian Koch]] as Professor Bressler\n* [[Stipe Erceg]] as Jones\n* Olivier Schneider as Smith\n* [[Rainer Bock]] as Herr Strauss (chief of hotel security)\n* [[Mido Hamada]] as Prince Shada\n* [[Karl Markovics]] as Dr. Farge\n* [[Eva L\u00f6bau]] as Nurse Gretchen Erfurt\n* Clint Dyer as Biko\n{{div col end}}\nMany German actors were cast for the film.

Together they had two children: (Anne-Marie, born in 1918, G\u00fcnther, born in 1921). During the [[World War I]] Gustav Lepman served as an officer in the German army on the battlefields in France. He died as the result of his war injuries in 1922, leaving her widowed at age 31.\n \nAfter the death of her husband, Jella Lepman became editor of the ''Stuttgarter Neues Tagblatt'', the first woman ever to hold this position. She wrote socio-political contributions and in 1927 introduced the newspaper supplement for women titled  \"The woman in house, profession and society\". In addition, she published her first children's book (1927 ''The Sleeping Sunday'') and a theatrical play for children (1929 ''The Singing Pfennig'') which was performed on the smaller state of the W\u00fcrttemberg State Theatre. She became a member of the [[German Democratic Party]] (''Deutsche Demokratische Partei'', DDP), where she was a leader in the women's group.

She remained its director until her retirement in 1957.\n\nDuring the [[reconstruction of Germany]], she was convinced that placing books into the hands of the children would offer them hope for the future. In 1952 she initiated a conference about international understanding through children's books, which led to the foundation of the non-profit [[International Board on Books for Young People]] in [[Zurich]] in 1953. Lepman wrote more in detail about this time of her life in her autobiographical book ''A Bridge of Children's Books''. She was one of the initiators of the [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]], the world's most important award for writers and illustrators of young people's literature. It was first issued in 1956, and she served as its jury president from 1956 to 1960.\n\nJella Lepman wrote many children\u2019s books and collections of children\u2019s stories, including a multivolume collection of bedtime stories that she collected over the years.

At the age of 17, in 1908, she organised an international reading room for the children of foreign works at a cigarette factory in an industrial quarter of Stuttgart.\n\nIn 1913 she married Gustav Horace Lepman (1877-1922), the German-American co-owner of a bedspring factory in [[Feuerbach]]. Together they had two children: (Anne-Marie, born in 1918, G\u00fcnther, born in 1921). During the [[World War I]] Gustav Lepman served as an officer in the German army on the battlefields in France. He died as the result of his war injuries in 1922, leaving her widowed at age 31.\n \nAfter the death of her husband, Jella Lepman became editor of the ''Stuttgarter Neues Tagblatt'', the first woman ever to hold this position. She wrote socio-political contributions and in 1927 introduced the newspaper supplement for women titled  \"The woman in house, profession and society\". In addition, she published her first children's book (1927 ''The Sleeping Sunday'') and a theatrical play for children (1929 ''The Singing Pfennig'') which was performed on the smaller state of the W\u00fcrttemberg State Theatre. She became a member of the [[German Democratic Party]] (''Deutsche Demokratische Partei'', DDP), where she was a leader in the women's group. In 1929, she ran, unsuccessfully, for the German [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.stadtlexikon-stuttgart.de/article/d6a07d28-640b-4bcb-b202-a823655f6cbd/Jella_Lepman_%281891-1970%29.html | title=Jella Lepman (1891 \u2013 1970) |accessdate=April 1, 2020|date=April 19, 2018| work=Stadtlexikon| author=Ferchl, Irene |language=de}}</ref>\n\nWith the [[Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933, Jella Lepman, as a Jew, lost her job at the newspaper, but was able to continue working for it as a freelancer until 1935.

In 1938 she helped organise the papers of [[Arthur Schnitzler]] which had recently arrived at the [[University of Cambridge]]. Later, she worked for the [[BBC]] and the [[American Broadcasting Station in Europe]] (ABSIE). In 1942 she published a German-language reader titled '' Die Kinder vom Kuckuckshof, eine Detektivgeschichte aus dem Schwarzwald '' for the publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] and in 1943, under the pseudonym Katherine Thomas, the book '' Women in Nazi Germany ''.\n\n== After the war ==\nAfter the end of [[World War II]], she returned to Germany in October 1945 as a consultant to the [[United States Army|US Army]] as part of the {{ill|Reeducation (denazification)|lt=Reeducation|de|Reeducation}} program of the American occupied zone,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://libreas.eu/ausgabe25/05becchi/ | title=Jella Lepman: Die Gr\u00fcnderin der Internationalen Jugendbibliothek | author=Anna Becchi | date=2014 | website= | publisher=LIBREAS.

In 1946 she organised the first international exhibition in post-war Germany, the {{ill|Internationale Jugendbuchausstellung |lt=Internationale Jugendbuchausstellung|de|Internationale Jugendbuchausstellung}}, which displayed 2000 books from 14 countries. It was shown in several large cities around Germany and visited by over one million people. These books became the founding collection for the [[International Youth Library]] which was opened in the [[Schwabing]] section of Munich 14 September 1949. She remained its director until her retirement in 1957.\n\nDuring the [[reconstruction of Germany]], she was convinced that placing books into the hands of the children would offer them hope for the future. In 1952 she initiated a conference about international understanding through children's books, which led to the foundation of the non-profit [[International Board on Books for Young People]] in [[Zurich]] in 1953. Lepman wrote more in detail about this time of her life in her autobiographical book ''A Bridge of Children's Books''. She was one of the initiators of the [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]], the world's most important award for writers and illustrators of young people's literature. It was first issued in 1956, and she served as its jury president from 1956 to 1960.\n\nJella Lepman wrote many children\u2019s books and collections of children\u2019s stories, including a multivolume collection of bedtime stories that she collected over the years. Her books have been translated into many different languages. She gave her friend [[Erich K\u00e4stner]] the idea the inspired his children's book ''The Animals' Conference'' (''Die Konferenz der Tiere'', 1949).\n\nLepman died in 1970 at the age of 79 years in Zurich and her final resting place is in the [[Zurich Enzenb\u00fchl cemetery]] on Forchstra\u00dfe. There is a street named after her in Stuttgart, and room named after her in Stuttgart's main public library on Mail\u00e4nder-Platz.\n\nSince 1991, in honor of Lepman's 100th birthday, the International Board on Books for Young People awards the \"Jella-Lepman Medal\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ibby.org/index.php?id=737 | title=Jella Lepman Medal | author= | date= | website= | publisher=International Board on Books for Young People | language= | accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref> to individuals who have made a significant contribution to children's literature.\n\n== Books ==\n* ''Der verschlafene Sonntag'', illus. by [[Hermann Gradl]].

The first game in the [[Super Smash Bros.|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]], it is a crossover between several different Nintendo franchises, including ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Star Fox]]'', ''[[List of Yoshi video games|Yoshi]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong]]'', ''[[Metroid]]'', ''[[F-Zero]]'', ''[[Mother (video game series)|Mother]]'', ''[[Kirby (series)|Kirby]]'', and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|Pok\u00e9mon]]''. It presents a cast of characters and locations from these franchises and allows players to use each character's unique skills and the stage's hazards to inflict damage, recover health, and ultimately knock opponents off the stage.\n\n''Super Smash Bros.'' received mostly positive reviews upon its release.

The game spawned a series of sequels for each successive Nintendo console, starting with ''[[Super Smash Bros.

On a platform, a boy wearing a baseball cap throws a bolt of lightning and in another stand, a round, pink creature wearing red shoes stands still.]]\nThe ''Super Smash Bros.'' series is a departure from the general genre of fighting games; instead of depleting an opponent's life bar, ''Smash Bros.'' players seek to knock opposing characters off a stage. Each player has a damage total, represented by a percentage, which rises as the damage is taken and can reach maximum damage of 999%. As this percentage rises, the character is knocked progressively farther by attacks. To knock out (KO) an opponent, the player must send that character flying off the edge of the stage, which is not an enclosed arena but rather an area with open boundaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/howto/basic/basic01.html|title=The Basic Rules|work=Smash Bros. DOJO!! |publisher=Smashbros.com|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}</ref> When knocked off the stage, a character may use jumping moves in an attempt to return; some characters have longer-ranged jumps and may have an easier time \"recovering\" than others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/howto/basic/basic03.html|title=You Must Recover!|work=Smash Bros. DOJO!! |publisher=Smashbros.com|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}</ref> Additionally, characters have different weights, making it harder for heavier opponents to be knocked off the edge, but harder for them to recover once sent flying.\n\nWhile games such as ''[[Street Fighter]]'' and ''[[Tekken]]'' require players to memorize complicated button-input combinations, ''Super Smash Bros.'' uses the same control combinations to access all moves for all characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/160/160494p1.html|title=Super Smash Bros. review|author=Peer Schneider|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=April 27, 1999|accessdate=April 16, 2008|author-link=Peer Schneider}}</ref> Characters are additionally not limited to only facing opponents, instead being allowed to move freely. The game focuses more on aerial and platforming skills than other fighting games, with larger, more dynamic stages rather than a simple flat platform. ''Smash Bros.'' also implements blocking and dodging mechanics. Grabbing and throwing other characters is also possible.\n\nVarious weapons and power-ups can be used in battle to inflict damage, recover health, or dispense additional items. They fall randomly onto the stage in the form of items from Nintendo franchises, such as Koopa shells, hammers, and Pok\u00e9 Balls.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318161642/http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/index.html|archivedate=March 18, 2008|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/index.html|title=Smash Bros. DOJO!!}}</ref> The nine multiplayer stages are locations taken from or in the style of Nintendo franchises, such as Planet Zebes from ''[[Metroid (series)|Metroid]]'' and Sector Z from ''[[Star Fox (series)|Star Fox]]''. Although stages are rendered in three dimensions, players move within a two-dimensional plane. Stages are dynamic, ranging from simple moving platforms to dramatic alterations of the entire stage. Each stage offers unique gameplay and strategic motives, making the chosen stage an additional factor in the fight.\n \t\nIn the game's [[Single-player video game|single-player]] mode, the player battles a series of [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|computer-controlled]] opponents in a specific order, attempting to defeat them with a limited number of lives in a limited amount of time. While the player can determine the [[Balance (game design)#Difficulty level|difficulty level]] and the number of lives, the series of opponents never changes. If the player loses all of their lives or runs out of time, they can continue at the cost of a loss of overall points. This mode is referred to as Classic Mode in sequels.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various11.html| title=Classic| publisher=Smashbros.com| first=Masahiro| last=Sakurai| date=October 30, 2007| access-date=June 1, 2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430210522/http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various11.html| archive-date=April 30, 2008| df=mdy-all}}</ref> The single-player mode also includes two minigames, \"Break the Targets\" and \"Board the Platforms\", in which the objective is to break each target or board multiple special platforms, respectively. A \"Training Mode\" is also available in which players can manipulate the environment and experiment against computer opponents without the restrictions of a standard match.\n\nUp to four people can play in [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode, which has specific rules predetermined by the players. Stock and timed matches are two of the multiplayer modes of play.<ref name=Spot/> This gives each player a certain number of lives or a selected time limit, before beginning the match. Free for all or team battles are also a choice during matches using stock or time. A winner is declared once time runs out, or if all players except one or a team have lost all of their lives. A multiplayer game may also end in a tie if two or more players have the same score when the timer expires, which causes the round to end in [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]]. During sudden death, all fighters are given 300% damage and the last fighter standing will win the match.\n\n==Characters==\n{{see also|Characters in the Super Smash Bros. series}}\nThe game includes twelve playable characters from popular Nintendo franchises.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/16387/page_3.html |title=Guides: Super Smash Bros.

Each player has a damage total, represented by a percentage, which rises as the damage is taken and can reach maximum damage of 999%.

Stock and timed matches are two of the multiplayer modes of play.<ref name=Spot/> This gives each player a certain number of lives or a selected time limit, before beginning the match. Free for all or team battles are also a choice during matches using stock or time. A winner is declared once time runs out, or if all players except one or a team have lost all of their lives.
