The word {{Lang|mi|poaka}} itself may come from the proto-Polynesian root ''*puaka'', known in every Polynesian language (\"{{Lang|to|puaka}} in [[Tongan language|Tongan]], [[Uvea (Wallis and Futuna)|Uvean]], [[Futunan language|Futunian]], [[Rapa Nui language|Rapa]], [[Marquesas Islands|Marquisian]], [[Niuean language|Niuean]], [[Cook Islands M\u0101ori|Rarotongan]], [[Tokelauan language|Tokelauan]], and [[Tuvaluan language|Tuvaluan]]; it evolved to the later form {{Lang|sm|pua\u02bba|italic=yes}} in [[Samoan language|Samoan]], [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]], some [[Easter Island|Rapa]] dialects, and [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]); or it might be borrowed or mixed with the English \"porker\". It is hard to say, since Polynesian peoples populated their islands bringing pigs with them from [[East Asia]], but no pigs were brought to [[Aotearoa]] by them. The more common M\u0101ori word for flea is {{Lang|mi|puruhi}}. It is also sometimes claimed that {{Lang|mi|p\u0101keh\u0101}} means \"white pig\" or \"unwelcome white stranger\". However, no part of the word signifies \"pig\", \"white\", \"unwelcome\", or \"stranger\".<ref>(1) Williams, H. W. (1971). ''A dictionary of the Maori language'' (7th ed.).

From the 1840s, following the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] and the assumption of British sovereignty, large numbers of Europeans began to settle permanently in New Zealand. Most of these settlers were from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], with a disproportionate number coming from [[Scotland]]. There were also numerous settlers from Ireland and Northern and Central Europe.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century there were some moves towards cultural nationalism, and many {{Lang|mi|P\u0101keh\u0101|italic=no}} began to see themselves as different from people living in Britain. However, there were still strong ties to the \"mother country\" (the United Kingdom, particularly England), which were maintained well into the twentieth century. Until some point in the mid-twentieth century most P\u0101keh\u0101 considered themselves to be both British and New Zealanders. Many {{Lang|mi|P\u0101keh\u0101|italic=no}} intellectuals migrated to Britain in order to pursue their careers as this was not possible in New Zealand. Notable [[expatriate]] {{Lang|mi|P\u0101keh\u0101|italic=no}} from this period include writer [[Katherine Mansfield]] and physicist [[Ernest Rutherford]].\n\n{{Lang|mi|P\u0101keh\u0101|italic=no}} ties with Britain were drastically weakened in the decades after [[World War II]]. Quicker, cheaper international travel allowed more {{Lang|mi|P\u0101keh\u0101|italic=no}} to visit and live in other countries, where they saw that they were different from the British and felt the need for a stronger national identity. In 1973, Britain joined the [[European Economic Community]], cutting New Zealand off from free trade with its biggest market and leaving P\u0101keh\u0101 feeling betrayed by the people they had thought of as their own.{{sfn|Mane-Wheoki|2000|p=11}} Meanwhile, M\u0101ori were becoming more assertive, especially about the value of their culture and their ownership over it. The M\u0101ori cultural renaissance made many P\u0101keh\u0101 feel that they lacked a culture of their own, and from the 1970s numerous P\u0101keh\u0101 writers and artists began to explore issues of P\u0101keh\u0101 identity and culture. It was at this point that the word \"P\u0101keh\u0101\" grew in popularity, although it remained controversial.\n\n==Cultural identity==\nIn general, {{Lang|mi|P\u0101keh\u0101|italic=no}} have developed and continue to develop identities distinct from and complementary to those of their (often) British origins and those of the other [[Anglophone]] nation-states such as [[Australia]], the United States, [[Canada]] and [[Ireland]], as well as M\u0101ori. As with most other settler societies, it can be said descriptively that {{Lang|mi|P\u0101keh\u0101|italic=no}} contemporary culture is an amalgam of cultural practices, tensions, and accommodations: British/European with some M\u0101ori and Polynesian influences and more recently wider cultural inputs, particularly from Chinese and other Far Eastern cultures.\n\nChristianity in New Zealand, despite its foreign origins, has also been shaped by M\u0101ori through movements such as the [[Ratana Church|R\u0101tana Church]], as well as their involvement in churches of European origin such as the [[Anglican Church]]. Where {{Lang|mi|P\u0101keh\u0101|italic=no}} identity is identified, commonly NZ kitsch and symbols from marketing such as the [[Chesdale Cheese]] men are used as signifiers,<ref>{{harvnb|Mane-Wheoki|2000|p=10}} cites Mike Harding, When the Pakeha Sings of Home.

The word {{Lang|mi|poaka}} itself may come from the proto-Polynesian root ''*puaka'', known in every Polynesian language (\"{{Lang|to|puaka}} in [[Tongan language|Tongan]], [[Uvea (Wallis and Futuna)|Uvean]], [[Futunan language|Futunian]], [[Rapa Nui language|Rapa]], [[Marquesas Islands|Marquisian]], [[Niuean language|Niuean]], [[Cook Islands M\u0101ori|Rarotongan]], [[Tokelauan language|Tokelauan]], and [[Tuvaluan language|Tuvaluan]]; it evolved to the later form {{Lang|sm|pua\u02bba|italic=yes}} in [[Samoan language|Samoan]], [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]], some [[Easter Island|Rapa]] dialects, and [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]); or it might be borrowed or mixed with the English \"porker\". It is hard to say, since Polynesian peoples populated their islands bringing pigs with them from [[East Asia]], but no pigs were brought to [[Aotearoa]] by them. The more common M\u0101ori word for flea is {{Lang|mi|puruhi}}. It is also sometimes claimed that {{Lang|mi|p\u0101keh\u0101}} means \"white pig\" or \"unwelcome white stranger\". However, no part of the word signifies \"pig\", \"white\", \"unwelcome\", or \"stranger\".<ref>(1) Williams, H. W. (1971). ''A dictionary of the Maori language'' (7th ed.).

From the 1840s, following the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] and the assumption of British sovereignty, large numbers of Europeans began to settle permanently in New Zealand. Most of these settlers were from [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], with a disproportionate number coming from [[Scotland]]. There were also numerous settlers from Ireland and Northern and Central Europe.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century there were some moves towards cultural nationalism, and many {{Lang|mi|P\u0101keh\u0101|italic=no}} began to see themselves as different from people living in Britain. However, there were still strong ties to the \"mother country\" (the United Kingdom, particularly England), which were maintained well into the twentieth century. Until some point in the mid-twentieth century most P\u0101keh\u0101 considered themselves to be both British and New Zealanders. Many {{Lang|mi|P\u0101keh\u0101|italic=no}} intellectuals migrated to Britain in order to pursue their careers as this was not possible in New Zealand. Notable [[expatriate]] {{Lang|mi|P\u0101keh\u0101|italic=no}} from this period include writer [[Katherine Mansfield]] and physicist [[Ernest Rutherford]].\n\n{{Lang|mi|P\u0101keh\u0101|italic=no}} ties with Britain were drastically weakened in the decades after [[World War II]]. Quicker, cheaper international travel allowed more {{Lang|mi|P\u0101keh\u0101|italic=no}} to visit and live in other countries, where they saw that they were different from the British and felt the need for a stronger national identity. In 1973, Britain joined the [[European Economic Community]], cutting New Zealand off from free trade with its biggest market and leaving P\u0101keh\u0101 feeling betrayed by the people they had thought of as their own.{{sfn|Mane-Wheoki|2000|p=11}} Meanwhile, M\u0101ori were becoming more assertive, especially about the value of their culture and their ownership over it. The M\u0101ori cultural renaissance made many P\u0101keh\u0101 feel that they lacked a culture of their own, and from the 1970s numerous P\u0101keh\u0101 writers and artists began to explore issues of P\u0101keh\u0101 identity and culture. It was at this point that the word \"P\u0101keh\u0101\" grew in popularity, although it remained controversial.\n\n==Cultural identity==\nIn general, {{Lang|mi|P\u0101keh\u0101|italic=no}} have developed and continue to develop identities distinct from and complementary to those of their (often) British origins and those of the other [[Anglophone]] nation-states such as [[Australia]], the United States, [[Canada]] and [[Ireland]], as well as M\u0101ori. As with most other settler societies, it can be said descriptively that {{Lang|mi|P\u0101keh\u0101|italic=no}} contemporary culture is an amalgam of cultural practices, tensions, and accommodations: British/European with some M\u0101ori and Polynesian influences and more recently wider cultural inputs, particularly from Chinese and other Far Eastern cultures.\n\nChristianity in New Zealand, despite its foreign origins, has also been shaped by M\u0101ori through movements such as the [[Ratana Church|R\u0101tana Church]], as well as their involvement in churches of European origin such as the [[Anglican Church]]. Where {{Lang|mi|P\u0101keh\u0101|italic=no}} identity is identified, commonly NZ kitsch and symbols from marketing such as the [[Chesdale Cheese]] men are used as signifiers,<ref>{{harvnb|Mane-Wheoki|2000|p=10}} cites Mike Harding, When the Pakeha Sings of Home.

{"title_page": "Who Killed Lucy Beale?", "text_new": "{{short description|Storyline from the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\"}}\n{{EngvarB|date=June 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2014}}\n[[File:Lucy Beale's jewellery box.JPG|thumb|The jewellery box prop that was the murder weapon in the storyline.]]\n\n\"'''Who Killed Lucy Beale?'''\" is a storyline from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]], ''[[EastEnders]]''. It was announced on 21 February 2014 and began on 18 April 2014, when [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]) was discovered dead on Walford Common from a deliberately inflicted head injury. The storyline reached a peak during [[EastEnders Live Week|''EastEnders'' Live Week]] on 19 February 2015, the show's 30th anniversary episode, during which Lucy's brother [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Eliot Carrington) is revealed to have killed her following a confrontation at home. Bobby's adoptive mother, [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]), had covered for him, moving Lucy's body to Walford Common and convincing Bobby that he was not responsible for his sister's death. The storyline was revived in July 2015, where it showed how the Beales coped with covering the secret and many locals being wrongfully arrested for committing the crime. The storyline reached another peak in December 2015, when Bobby discovers the truth. The storyline was revisited again in May 2016; when Bobby brutally attacks Jane, and reveals in a busy pub that he killed her and Lucy. However, Jane survives the attack \u2013 although facing potential [[paralysis]] \u2013 and Bobby is arrested; he is later charged for Lucy's murder. The storyline culminated in the 16 June 2016 episode when Bobby is sentenced to three years in custody for killing Lucy and causing [[grievous bodily harm]] upon Jane. Although Bobby is jailed for Lucy's murder, the story arc would potentially serve as the catalyst for 2017's central storyline \u2013 which sees fellow suspect [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) seeking revenge on the community, particularly Bobby's father [[Ian Beale]] ([[ Adam Woodyatt]]) and his old enemy [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), for allowing him to go to prison for Lucy's murder. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/a844111/eastenders-full-christmas-2017-storylines-revealed/|title=EastEnders' full Christmas storylines have been revealed for the first time|date=7 December 2017|first=Sophie|last=Dainty|accessdate=2 April 2020|work=[[Digital Spy]]}}</ref> The storyline is revisited again from June 2019 when Bobby is released from the young offenders institution.\n\n==Storyline creation and development==\nThe murder story is in the style of a \"[[whodunit]]\" mystery.

Following the episode that aired on 1 January 2015, the number of official suspects was whittled down to a list of fourteen, when character [[Emma Summerhayes]] ([[Anna Acton]]) sent a text message to the person she believed was the killer, with the fourteen characters all being on screen when the message reached its unspecified recipient's phone.<ref name=\"suspects\" /> By the end of January, [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) no longer appeared as a suspect in promotional material ahead of the anniversary episode, bringing the list of suspects down to thirteen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-01-30/eastenders-spoilers-is-lauren-branning-no-longer-a-murder-suspect|title=EastEnders spoilers: is Lauren Branning no longer a murder suspect?|last=Brown|first=David|date=30 January 2015|publisher=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/eastenders/11380258/All-you-need-to-know-about-EastEnders-30th-anniversary-live-week.html |title= EastEnders: Who killed Lucy Beale?

In the days leading up to [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]]'s death, Ian was troubled by his daughter's behaviour and [[Cindy Williams (EastEnders)|Cindy]], jealous of Ian favouring Lucy over herself, revealed that Lucy had a secret stash of cocaine hidden in her jewellery box. After a heated argument, Ian told Lucy that she was his favourite child as [[Peter Beale|Peter]] overheard, running off as Lucy chased after him. Ian stated in his alibi that he was at the restaurant the night she died, but Cindy mentioned that she went there to look for him and he was not there. He was in fact with [[Rainie Cross]], a prostitute.\n*'''[[Jane Beale]]''', played by [[Laurie Brett]]. Jane had been staying at her friend [[Masood Ahmed|Masood]]'s house over Easter. She claimed not to have left the house, but provided [[Lauren Branning|Lauren]] with an alibi after claiming that she had seen Lauren approach the Beale house and then leave moments later without entering.\n*'''[[Peter Beale]]''', played by [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]]. On the night of [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]]'s death, Peter overheard his father [[Ian Beale|Ian]] tell Lucy that she was his favourite child. He ran out, stating in his alibi that he needed some time alone. Prior to the murder, it was revealed that Lucy had been taking cocaine. [[Jane Beale|Jane]] reads out the texts on Lucy's phone including an unsent message to Peter on the night of her death asking for drugs. He later confesses to being her drug dealer, making sure he can control her addiction.\n*'''[[Abi Branning]]''', played by [[Lorna Fitzgerald]]. [[Max Branning|Max]] received an anonymous email of a picture of him kissing [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]], which was later revealed to have been sent by Abi. She was very unstable during her police interview, and stated in her alibi that she was at home with her father Max all night, but was left alone briefly when Max went out to walk the dog. On Halloween 2014, Abi stalked her sister [[Lauren Branning|Lauren]] wearing a [[Weeping Angel]] mask when she became uncomfortable with Lauren dismissing her problems in favour of her own. During a heated confrontation, Abi tries to drown Lauren. She later denies killing Lucy, but admits that she wishes that she had.\n*'''[[Max Branning]]''', played by [[Jake Wood]]. Prior to [[Good Friday]], it was revealed that Max had been having an affair with [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]]. A few days before her death, the pair had a heated argument, resulting in Lucy falling and hitting her head and he later grabbed her aggressively. Both incidents were captured on CCTV footage and reviewed by [[David Wicks|David]]. David originally blamed Max for the murder, but after the two talk, David decides to keep quiet about the incidents and the laptop containing the evidence is destroyed. Max stated in his alibi that he was at home all night except for when he left for five minutes to walk the dog, which was later confirmed by an anxious [[Abi Branning|Abi]], after her maternal grandmother, [[Cora Cross|Cora]], called the police after noticing Max and Abi cleaning up Lucy's blood from the car lot.\n*'''[[Jay Brown]]''', played by [[Jamie Borthwick]]. Although no given motive has presented itself, CCTV footage revealed that Jay was on the same bus as [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] the night that she was murdered, and was shown to have followed her after she got off. He burned the hat that he was wearing in the footage, and later buried Lucy's purse and phone.\n*'''[[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]]''', played by [[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]. Lee had a fling with [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] in the days running up to her death, upsetting love rival [[Whitney Dean|Whitney]].

Dean was questioned by the police following the murder.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Events leading up to the murder===\n[[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]) decides to set up a letting agency, despite cynicism from her father, [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). Her former colleague [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]) offers to be her business partner but she turns him down in favour of her friend, [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]). It is revealed that Lucy is secretly having a sexual relationship with Lauren's father [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]). She also has sex with [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]), despite being aware that [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]) harbours romantic feelings for Lee. Lucy's behaviour with Lee causes tension between her and Max; during a disagreement in Max's car showroom, Lucy trips and falls, resulting in a minor injury to her head. She then ends her relationship with Max, and continues her relationship with Lee. Max receives an anonymous email that states, \"What have you been doing?\" and contains a photograph of him and Lucy embracing. Lucy's half-sister, [[Cindy Williams (EastEnders)|Cindy Williams]] ([[Mimi Keene]]) becomes jealous of Lucy being Ian's favourite. On Good Friday, Cindy tells Ian and [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) to open Lucy's jewellery box. They find a bag of [[cocaine]] inside. The revelation prompts Ian to cancel a planned trip with his fianc\u00e9e [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) to [[Oxford]] to see her daughter [[Libby Fox|Libby]] ([[Belinda Owusu]]), upsetting Denise. Ian and Jane catch Lee and Lucy having sex in Ian's restaurant. Ian confronts Lucy about the cocaine but she runs off. She goes to the Branning's house to work with Lauren, but leaves after having words with Max. She later returns to speak to Ian, who tells Lucy that she has always been his favourite child. Lucy's twin brother [[Peter Beale]] ([[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]]) overheard this, and storms off. Lucy is furious with Ian and leaves to find Peter. In [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], Whitney is upset when she finds out about Lee and Lucy's relationship. In the Square, Lucy sees her friends going to [[Ronnie Mitchell|Ronnie]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) and [[Roxy Mitchell]]'s ([[Rita Simons]]) house-warming party. Lauren urges her to join them, failing to notice that Lucy is upset, while Whitney shoots angry glares at her. Lucy bumps into Max again rebuffing his advances; he grabs her violently by the wrist. Lucy reads a text and leaves Albert Square for an unknown location.\n\nLucy begins to walk towards the bus stop, texting Peter to ask for [[cocaine]] (he later buys some, but keeps it for himself). On her journey, she passes by her father's chip shop, where she spots Billy stealing fish during his shift. She confronts him and says that she's going to tell Ian. He follows her, grabs her by the wrist and begs her to keep quiet, before suggesting that he fancies her. Disgusted, Lucy heads off towards the bus stop, but is stopped by Lee, who has seen her argument with Billy. He encourages her to join him at the house-warming party, and Lucy agrees to join him later, but must go to show a buyer one of her flats first.\n\nLucy boards the Number 30 bus, and is followed by [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]). Jay meets with [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Harry Reid (actor)|Harry Reid]]), who has just been released from prison following the death of [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Fergison]]). Ben surprises Lucy at the flat, and confronts her about not giving him money that she had originally promised, as he had planned to move to [[Miami]]. An intoxicated [[Jake Stone (EastEnders)|Jake Stone]] ([[Jamie Lomas]]) is revealed to be the potential buyer, but he admits he was only there in hopes of rekindling his romance with Lauren, who he had expected to be showing him the flat. Lucy and Jake take an unlicensed taxi, driven by [[List of EastEnders characters (2014)#Arsim Kelmendi|Arsim Kelmendi]] (Tomasz Aleksander) back to Walford.\n\nWhile out walking his dog, Max spots Lucy struggling to carry Jake back to his flat and reluctantly agrees to help. Max's other daughter [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) watches on, believing they're about to continue their sexual relationship. Once in the flat, Max goads Jake, who attempts to punch him. He misses Max and instead hits Lucy, causing her nose to bleed and her earring to fall out. Lucy goes into the bathroom to clean herself up, and Max tells her that their relationship doesn't have to end but Lucy rebuffs him. She leaves the flat but is robbed of her purse and phone by Ben, who has followed her back to Walford. Lucy begins to walk home and meets Abi, who expresses her disgust at her relationship with her father, and proceeds to slap her.\n\nLucy arrives on the Square, where Jane rushes over to talk to her. Lucy then tells Jane that she has had a terrible night, and asks her to resume living at the Beale house. Jane reminds Lucy about her father's engagement to Denise, but Lucy doesn't believe that they are happy, and asks Jane to be a mother-figure to her once again. Jane says that she doesn't want to return home, but Lucy misinterprets this as Jane rejecting her, and goes home. She then overhears Denise talking to her daughter [[Chelsea Fox]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]) on the phone, and discovers that Denise plans to leave Ian. Lucy confronts Denise, and they engage in a bitter fight which is overheard by Lucy's youngest brother [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby]] (Eliot Carrington). The fight culminates with Lucy slapping Denise and Denise pinning Lucy down on the floor. Elsewhere, Cindy heads to the restaurant looking for Ian, but after not finding him there, leaves a voicemail message for Lucy asking whether she will come home that night. She narrowly misses Lucy and heads to bed with Bobby who feigns being asleep. While jogging, Peter considers returning to the Beale house, but instead returns to Billy's bedsit. Lucy meanwhile sits outside on the street after brawling with Denise, distraught that her life has crumbled around her, as a jealous Whitney looks on. Lee leaves a voicemail for Lucy asking when he will see her, before returning to the party. Ian returns home after sleeping with prostitute [[Rainie Cross]] ([[Tanya Franks]]) and also leaves a message for Lucy, telling her that he's sorry. Lucy goes home and begins writing a letter in the living room. As she does, she is startled by someone when the floorboards creak, and she sees her assailant. Shortly afterwards, Jane receives a panicked phone call, and rushes over to the Beale house, where she sees the door is open. She walks in to find Lucy lying on the living room floor. Jane checks her pulse and is distraught to realise that Lucy is dead. She turns around to find Bobby, who tells her that \"Whatever she [Lucy] says, she started it. She made everyone unhappy\". Jane realises that Bobby is responsible as he is holding Lucy's jewellery box, the one which she stored cocaine in, having used it to hit Lucy with.\n\nJane convinces Bobby that he has done nothing wrong, and reassuring him that Lucy will be fine, sends him to bed. Jane contemplates taking Lucy to the hospital, but when she is unnerved at the devastation it could cause, she instead puts Lucy in the boot of her car, and takes her to Walford Common. Jane says her goodbyes to Lucy and leaves her body.\n\n===Investigation following Lucy's death===\nThe next morning, Lucy's body is discovered by a young girl walking with her grandfather on Walford Common. [[List of EastEnders characters (2014)#DC Emma Summerhayes|DC Emma Summerhayes]] ([[Anna Acton]]) and [[List of EastEnders characters (2014)#DS Bryant|DS Cameron Bryant]] ([[Glen Wallace]]) visit Ian to inform him they have found Lucy's body. Ian is inconsolable as he identifies her body and breaks the news to Jane, Denise, Cindy, Bobby and, later, Peter. It is revealed Lucy died because of a deliberate head injury. The police question the family and search Lucy's bedroom. Cindy tells Ian that Lucy was an habitual user of cocaine. Ian says that he was at his restaurant the previous evening, but Cindy says she went there and did not see him. Ian laments that he did not know his daughter at all and furiously throws Cindy out, forcing her to return to Devon. The police take a DNA sample from Lee before he returns to [[Afghanistan]]. Summerhayes returns to say that there has been a leak at the police station and the press have got hold of some vital information. It is explained that there was very little blood found at the common, meaning that Lucy was not killed in a mugging, but was murdered elsewhere, then dumped on the Common. Her purse and phone are also missing. [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]) discovers Max's sexual relationship with Lucy and accuses him of killing her. Max denies it but David later finds CCTV footage of Max and Lucy arguing on the night of her death. David does not tell the police because he is worried that if Max is questioned it will affect the health of his cancer-stricken fiancee [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsay Coulson]]), who is Max's sister. He says that he does not believe Max killed her and together they burn all computer evidence of the footage.\n\nWhen Lauren reopens LB Lettings for business, she discovers the email intended for her but read by Lucy on the night of her death. The sender is asking that they meet and Lauren suspects it was sent by Lucy's killer. She takes the information to the police but they tell her they are already looking into the matter. Lauren arranges to meet the person herself at a cafe on Walford Common and is stunned to discover it is her former lover, Jake. Jake says that he sent Lauren the email, hoping to reconcile with Lauren and used a false name, guessing she would not reply if she knew it was from him. He arranged to meet her at the cafe, but instead found Lucy there. Jake explains he was very drunk and Lucy accompanied him back to Walford in an unlicensed taxi. He cannot remember any more details. Lauren does not believe him and suspects he made a pass at Lucy, was rejected, he lashed out and killed her. Lauren visits the police again. The police arrest Jake after finding Lucy's blood and one of her earrings in his flat. He is later charged with her murder.\n\nOn the day of Lucy's funeral, Max's youngest daughter, Abi, tells Max that she knew about his sexual relationship with Lucy and that it was she who sent the email and photograph. The relationship is made public and he is ostracised by the residents of Walford. [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Rickman]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) is also concerned when she overhears Cindy talking to Ian about his false alibi. After the funeral, [[Tamwar Masood]] ([[Himesh Patel]]) finds a note in the church to Lucy, \"ROT IN HELL\". He recognises the handwriting as Whitney's and confronts her. Whitney claims that Lucy had been relentlessly cyber-bullying her about her weight and appearance. She admits that she hated Lucy, but denies killing her. Tamwar agrees not to say anything. Following the funeral, Jane decides to take Bobby back to [[Cardiff]] with her, wanting to give him a new start away from the shadow of Lucy's death.\n\nCurious about Ian's false alibi, Sharon and her boyfriend [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) decide to visit Jake in prison and begin to believe that he might be innocent. When they question Ian, he assures them that he is not involved with Lucy's death in any way. Peter discovers that Sharon and Phil are doubting Jake's guilt, so asks Lauren to visit Jake in prison. He tries to find the taxi driver who brought Jake and Lucy back to Walford. Lauren starts to reassess Jake's guilt and joins Peter in the search for the taxi driver, believing that Jake was too drunk to have committed the murder. Max tells Lauren that he saw Jake and Lucy together on [[Good Friday]], and claims that Jake was sober but he has not informed the police. Max also tells Abi about the altercation he had with Lucy in the car showroom and a worried Abi cleans Lucy's blood from the car showroom floor, worried it will implicate Max. Abi claims that Max was at home with her on the night of the killing. When [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]) sees this, she informs the police that Max has new information.\n\nEmma returns to clarify Max and Abi's new statements and Max flirts with her and they have sex. Lauren tracks down Kelmendi, who tells her that Jake was too drunk to stand on the night of Lucy's death, but he refuses to make a statement to the police. Lauren realises that Max lied about Jake being sober. Peter becomes more obsessed than ever about finding Lucy's killer. Ian starts receiving several phone calls and texts from a mysterious \"R\". Becoming more irate, Ian tells the contact not to contact him again. It is later revealed that \"R\" is Rainie, who is blackmailing Ian because he was having sex with her on the night of Lucy's murder, thus confirming that Cindy was telling the truth about Ian having a false alibi.\n\nWhen Lee returns to Walford, he tells his family that he saw Billy arguing with Lucy on the night she was murdered. Lee confronts Billy who confesses to stealing fish from Ian's fish and chip shop, and using a key to enter Jake's flat to steal electricity. He claims that Lucy caught him stealing the fish and threatened to tell Ian. Phil encourages Billy to go to the police and frame Peter, but Billy cannot go through with this. After Billy makes a statement, Jake is released from prison without charge. Billy faces hostility from the Beales and is also confronted by [[Pam Coker]] ([[Lin Blakley]]) who finds photographs of Lucy underneath his fridge. Billy tells her the photographs are Peter's, but later bins them after telling Pam he would return them. The police say that they are still looking for Lucy's purse and mobile phone. The police ask Ian to do a press appeal after the investigation stalls and televise new CCTV footage from the night of Lucy's death, showing her on a bus. It is discovered that on the night of her death, Lucy went to some flats to see a client who has now been eliminated from the police inquiry. Ian struggles to cope when he is hounded by the press and the police do not intervene. Phil believes that the police suspect Ian is hiding something and demands that he tell him what it is. Ian admits to Phil that he was with Rainie. The CCTV footage shows a man wearing a [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]] beanie hat getting off the bus at the same stop as Lucy. Police say they are looking for this person. Jay has the hat and burns it. Jay is questioned by the police but not charged. He and Ian's half-brother, Phil's son Ben were robbing a shop near Walford Common on the night of Lucy's death. It is revealed that Jay buried Lucy's missing purse and phone at the allotments on Ben's instructions.\n\nEmma is removed from the case when her sexual relationship with Max is exposed. Lauren is repeatedly followed by DS Bryant acting under the orders of the head of the investigation [[DI Samantha Keeble]] ([[Alison Newman]]). Denise finds Lucy's phone and purse buried in [[Patrick Trueman]]'s ([[Rudolph Walker]]) allotment. Realising what Denise has found, Jay and Ben panic and unsuccessfully try to steal them back. Denise returns the phone and purse to Ian, and fearing that Ian will turn them over to the police, Ben confesses to Ian that he found a bag containing a phone and purse abandoned on Good Friday, but denies seeing Lucy or realising that they were hers until after learning of her death. Ian phones the police, but Ben pleads his innocence and Ian decides to not report this development, asking Jane to keep the items safe. Ian scrolls through the messages on Lucy's phone and finds a pending text to Peter asking for cocaine. Ian confronts Peter upon his return from a trip to New Zealand, just as he is proposing to Lauren, and Peter admits that he had been supplying Lucy with cocaine before her death in a bid to protect her from dangerous drug dealers. Lauren rejects Peter's proposal and Ian briefly disowns Peter, but they later reconcile.\n\nLee views a video of [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]) taken on the night of the murder and spots Lauren heading to the Beale house, contradicting her alibi. He anonymously turns over the footage to Emma, who questions Lauren. Lauren admits that she went to see Lucy, but left without seeing her. Jane later backs Lauren up, claiming to have seen her leave the Beale house without entering from a window in the Masood house. Shortly before Christmas, Jane and Ian resume their romantic relationship, and Jane proposes to Ian. They plan their wedding for February.\n\nAlthough no longer a policewoman, Emma continues to study her police files. Shortly after Christmas, she seemingly cracks the case, and contacts a mystery person, telling them that she has figured out that they killed Lucy. On New Year's Day, she arranges to meet the person in the park and urges them to go to the police. The unseen person leaves and Emma sends them a text message, saying that she can't keep their secret. Distracted, Emma wanders into the road and is hit by Roxy's car. Although she initially appears to be unharmed, Emma later starts bleeding from her ear and collapses. Max takes her to the hospital, but Emma dies from her injuries.\n\nCarol finds a grief-stricken Max tearing up Emma's file on Lucy. Lauren retrieves the papers from the bin and sets about trying to restore the torn-up pieces. A few weeks later, after proposing to Peter, Lauren finds a missing scrap of paper in her kitchen, and after putting it with the rest of the work, realises some startling information on what happened to Lucy. Deeply disturbed by her discovery, Lauren begins rejecting those around her and breaks her sobriety. Her erratic behaviour is spotted by [[Stacey Slater|Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]), and Lauren admits her concerns that she might be pregnant. She takes a pregnancy test, which turns out to be positive. She later shares her belief that she knows what happened to Lucy. Stacey calls the police but Lauren keeps silent about her theory, handing over Emma's files, but retaining the crucial evidence. She kicks Stacey out of her house, and breaks off her engagement to Peter.\n\nAn emotional Lauren gets a wedding card for Ian and Jane, in which she writes \"I know what happened to Lucy. She died at home.\" She addresses the card to Jane and leaves it in the Beale house on the day of the wedding. Peter finds her, and confronts her about their break-up, but Lauren leaves, refusing to speak to him. Moments before the ceremony is due to begin, Jane finds the card and is visibly shaken. She struggles to recite her vows to Ian, but the pair eventually remarry. Elsewhere, Stacey informs Max of Lauren's discovery and he begins a frantic search across Walford to find her. Lauren returns home and plans to leave Walford, but Max arrives and tries to stop her. Abi interrupts their conversation, allowing Lauren the opportunity to escape. Abi accuses her sister of attention seeking, but Max  informs her that Lauren has figured out who killed Lucy, and accuses Abi of being the killer. Abi admits that she fought with Lucy the night she died, but denies killing her, though admits wishing that she had. After learning of Lauren's pregnancy, Max races to the hospital and attempts to talk her out of having an abortion, but she sends him away. Peter also learns of Lauren's plan, and confronts her. She reveals that she has figured out that Lucy died at home.\n\nAt the wedding reception, a troubled Jane returns home. She contacts Masood, and asks him to take Bobby (now Elliot Carrington) to his house overnight. Masood is confused but noticing how distressed Jane is, agrees to look after Bobby. Ian returns home looking for Jane, while Peter return to The Vic and drags Cindy home. There, he reveals Lauren's discovery and questions the family about their involvement. Realising that Denise was home all night, Ian heads out to find her, but is sidetracked when [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) informs him of the discovery of [[Nick Cotton]]'s ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]) body. Ian speaks to [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]), who confesses that she allowed Nick to die. Ian realises that Lucy may not have been killed out of hate, and tells [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]) that he's putting the final pieces of the puzzle together. Peter spots Denise on the Square and accuses her of killing Lucy, but Ian intervenes and protests Denise's innocence. He then phones home and makes an ambiguous call, instructing the person to get everyone else out of the house because he has figured out what happened. When he returns, Jane is home alone. Ian demands to know what happened, and covering for Bobby, Jane lies and claims to have accidentally killed Lucy during an argument. Ian smashes up the kitchen in rage, attracting the attention of Peter and Cindy. The three confront Jane, but Ian begins to suspect that she is lying, realising that her story makes little sense.\n\nFrom Masood's house, Bobby tries to contact Jane, and Ian realises that Jane is covering for him. Jane crumbles, and admits that on Good Friday, Bobby phoned her in a panic and when she came to the Beale house, she found him standing over Lucy's lifeless body. She reveals that Bobby was frustrated with Lucy for all the trouble she was causing, and after confronting her, lashed out after failing to get through to her. Jane explains that after realising what had happened, she convinced Bobby that he wasn't responsible for Lucy's death and that he is under the belief that Lucy went back out after their argument and was later killed by someone else. Jane also reveals that Emma met her on New Year's Day and was having a hard time deciding whether to reveal the truth. Peter lashes out at Jane and accuses her of betraying Lucy's memory, while Jane protests that Bobby didn't mean to hurt Lucy. They are disturbed when Cindy brings Bobby home, and after seeing his son, Ian decides to keep the circumstances of Lucy's death a secret. He forgives Jane and insists that the family all rally around and keep the secret. Peter refuses, but Cindy empathises with Jane. Hearing the commotion downstairs, Bobby comes down resulting in Peter angrily leaving. Bobby reveals to Cindy that he has kept the letter that Lucy was writing safe since learning about her death. Cindy reveals its contents to the family: Lucy wrote to Ian, telling him that she was sorry for her behaviour and that she wants to change. She tells Ian that she's going to bed, but when he returns home to wake her up so she can tell him that she loves him. An emotional Ian gathers Jane, Cindy and Bobby and the family embrace. Peter leaves the Square and moves to New Zealand with Lauren after telling her that Bobby was the one who killed Lucy and that Jane covered for him. She agrees to keep it a secret.\n\nFive months later, the police arrest Ben on suspicion of the murder. Jane shows Ian that she has kept Lucy's phone and wallet, but they agree to keep them hidden to ensure Ben's release. However, Bobby overhears them talking about Ben, so he takes the items to the police. Phil finds him there and stops him, but later believes that Ben may have killed Lucy, so hands the items to the police himself. The Mitchells hear of this and are angry that Phil did not wipe the fingerprints off the items, and Jay believes he will also be implicated, which he is. As a result, Jay receives a three-month suspended sentence and is [[Electronic tag|tagged]]. However, Abi then tells Phil that she believes Max may have killed Lucy, so Sharon drives her to the police station. Despite being innocent, Max hands himself into the police. Later that day, Max is arrested and charged with Lucy's murder after her blood is found on his shoes (blood from her nosebleed which occurred when Jake hit her), and Ben is released. Ben is furious that Phil handed the items into the police, while Stacey visits Max in prison where he reveals that he believes that Abi killed Lucy. Stacey confronts Abi, which leads to a bitter fight between the pair. Max informs Carol that Abi had attacked Lucy violently on the night of the murder, which is why he thinks she killed her. After confronting Abi, Carol visits the Beales and vows to do all she can to help Max get released from prison and find the real killer.\n\nJane cannot deal with her guilt as she watches Carol fall apart over Max's arrest, and begins helping her by aiding her look for a solicitor and helping her search for Cora, who has been missing for months. Jane tells Carol she knows that Max did not kill Lucy, leading to Carol becoming suspicious. Jane is adamant that she is going to confess to Carol that Bobby killed Lucy, however Ian persuades her not to. After Bobby attempts to throw a brick through Max's car windscreen, Cindy shouts at him at home, leading to him pushing her over; she lands where Jane found Lucy dead on the night of the murder. When Abi and Carol find Cora, Jane decides she will tell Carol that Bobby killed Lucy, but when Cora says she saw Abi and Max cleaning Lucy's blood off the car lot floor after she died, Abi admits that Max and Lucy argued there and that the evidence is stacked strongly against Max. Back at the Beale household, Cindy\u2014believing that Ian and Jane have told Carol and Abi the truth\u2014tells her boyfriend and Carol's grandson [[Liam Butcher]] (James Forde) that Bobby killed Lucy. Cindy learns that Ian and Jane did not tell Carol, and Ian persuades Liam not to reveal the secret, arranging for Cindy and Liam to move to Devon permanently. Cindy and Liam decide not to leave Walford, and Liam attempts to call the police on Bobby, but Ian states that he and Cindy could go to prison for perverting the course of justice. Liam blackmails Ian and Jane into giving him \u00a3100,000 to leave permanently, saying he will go to Germany to live with his father, but Liam eventually agrees to leave without payment. Jane tells Ian that she intends for all the Beales to move away from Walford, but instead, Liam and Cindy leave together without Jane and the others.\n\nCindy sends a video message to Bobby informing him that he killed Lucy and that Jane lied. Sharon watches the message on Bobby's laptop and hides it from Bobby, and later confronts Jane about it. Eventually, Jane confirms to Sharon that Bobby killed Lucy, while Ian deletes the email. Ian pleads with Sharon to keep the information a secret for the sake of his family, but Sharon says she needs time to think about what to do. Sharon decides not to tell Phil the truth about the murder and tells Ian that she will not tell anybody. She later asks Ian and Jane what to expect at Max's trial, after hearing that Ben, Jay, Abi and Lee have all been called to give evidence, so Jane contacts Keeble. Ian, however, visits Dot who says that she wishes she had turned her criminal son, Nick, into the police when he was younger, so Ian takes Bobby away in the middle of the night. The next day, Jane is frantic to discover that Ian and Bobby are nowhere to be seen, so she visits Sharon, who covers for her when Phil starts asking questions. Jane is intent on giving an alibi for Max to his lawyer [[Marcus Christie]] ([[Stephen Churchett]])\u2014who also has history with Phil and Sharon\u2014however Sharon strongly advises Jane against the idea. After a day of worrying, Jane eventually decides to contact Keeble and say that she killed Lucy, however Phil grabs her from behind and stops her from answering the door to Keeble. Keeble eventually leaves, and Phil tells Jane he knows she killed Lucy. She lies that she had an argument with Lucy over drugs. Phil vents his anger over Ben's arrest, and Jane lets slip she is covering for Bobby. Phil is stunned. When Sharon arrives, she tries to convince Phil not to call the police, but when he gets his mobile phone out, Jane punches him out of desperation and expresses how much she loves Bobby. Phil and Sharon convince her to continue protecting Bobby and allow Max to stand trial as Bobby is more important to her than Max is. Jane contacts Ian and Bobby, who are in Kent, and reveals that she will be joining them.\n\n===Max's trial and Kathy's return===\nJane is stunned when Lauren returns and reveals that she knows that Bobby killed Lucy. She pleads with Lauren to stay quiet, however Lauren is determined to have Max released. At court, Lee takes to the stand and Marcus questions his recent sacking from the army due to violent behaviour, leading to Lee breaking down in tears. However, the prosecution, [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Hazel Warren|Hazel Warren]] ([[Clare Higgins]]), points out Marcus's character assassination on Lee. Lauren then decides to tell Jane that she is informing the police of the real killer, but as she leaves the house, her waters break. The following day, Abi is questioned in the docks, and is disgusted when she realises that Max has told Marcus about her fight with Lucy on the night she died. In pure anger, Abi lies that Max revealed to her that he killed Lucy. Abi later feels guilty and confesses to lying, and is shunned by the judge. When Lauren brings her baby [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Louie Beale|Louie]] home, Carol tells her and Abi about how Max has always been a coward, so Lauren visits Max in prison. He reveals that he was planning to write Abi a letter of apology, and swears that Marcus forced him to confess about Abi and Lucy's fight. Lauren, seeing what Carol pointed out, urges Max to stand up for himself if he wants to prove his innocence. Max begins to suspect that Lauren knows more than she is letting on and questions her how she knows he didn't do it if she has a low opinion of him. Lauren does not answer and leaves the prison silently.\n\nAfter Lauren and Abi are horrified when Max once again fails to defend Abi when accusations of her killing Lucy arise in court, Lauren warns Jane not to give evidence as planned, feeling that Max needs to defend himself. After failing to convince Carol to help Max defend himself, Marcus tries to contact Jane, who avoids him because of Lauren's warning. When the prosecution lawyer, Hazel, verbally attacks Max, Carol, who had until this point, lost faith in his innocence, finally agrees to help and encourages Marcus to interrogate him about his abusive childhood that caused his insecurities. Marcus and Jane then secretly come up with a plan to ensure Max will be found innocent. Jane then travels to court the following day and tells the jury that she and Max had sex when Lucy was murdered, though Hazel believes this is just a lie to ensure Max is found not guilty, because Jane had not mentioned this previously. Later, Jane pleads with Phil to help Max and he privately confronts the foreman of the jury in his car. The foreman later states in court that the jury have found Max guilty, which Ian briefly witnesses from outside. As a horrified Carol and Stacey protest, proclaiming his innocence, Max jumps out from his stand, punches Bryant, and quickly escapes the courthouse. Max visits Jane and realises she is covering for Bobby. When Max is rearrested, he shouts that Bobby killed Lucy but it is seen as an act of desperation. Max is sentenced to 20 years for the murder and a further 12 months for escaping lawful custody. Lauren then goes to the police and tells Bryant that it is true that Bobby killed Lucy, but Bryant does not believe her and says that Max deserves what he gets for what happened to Emma.\n\nAfter returning to Walford with Bobby, Ian leaves Jane a suicide note saying he killed Lucy. When Jane finds Ian about to jump off a bridge, he tells her that this is the only way to protect everyone. However, Jane talks him down and he is then surprised to see his supposedly dead mother, [[Kathy Beale|Kathy Sullivan]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]), on the other side of the road. Ian later tells Kathy that Bobby killed Lucy, rebuilding their trust. Jane is horrified that he told Kathy about Bobby, but Ian is confident she will not say anything to the police. Bobby protests over Ian and Jane's decision to move him into Lucy's old bedroom while Kathy moves into his bedroom. After unsuccessfully trying to swap the rooms back, Bobby pushes Jane down the stairs during a scuffle, knocking her unconscious. Jane lies to Kathy that she tripped, but Bobby tells Kathy the truth. Kathy tries to convince Jane that Bobby has anger management problems, and after Bobby later smashes a plate in anger, Jane expresses her concerns to Kathy that Bobby may well have anger issues.\n\nBobby and Sharon's son [[Dennis Rickman Jnr]] ([[Bleu Landau]]) start a feud, leading to Kathy telling Sharon that Bobby pushed Jane down the stairs. Sharon decides to go to the police, so Jane tells Ian of Sharon's plan. Dennis tells Bobby that he killed Lucy, having overheard it from Sharon and Phil. Sharon then has second thoughts after her father and Kathy's husband [[Gavin Sullivan]] ([[Paul Nicholas]]) tells her not to destroy a family. Bobby and Dennis go for a bike ride to Walford Common, so Phil and Ian go looking for them. They find Dennis brutally beaten, while Bobby's return home means Sharon thinks he has harmed Dennis. A distracted and drunk Phil crashes the car, leaving Phil and Ian with cuts and bruises and Dennis in a critical condition. Ian realises Phil was drunk, and when speaking to Jane, also realises Dennis must have told Bobby he killed Lucy. Ian then does a deal with Phil: stop Sharon going to the police about Bobby and Ian will say he drove the car, saving Phil's relationship with Sharon, but ending his own friendship with her. When Bobby throws his television down the stairs, he tells Ian what Dennis told him. Ian confirms that he did kill Lucy but everyone is protecting him out of love. Ian tells Jane, who decides it is time to go to the police. Bobby agrees he should face the police, but Ian decides that a private boarding school will be another way to help him, while keeping the family intact. When Phil confesses to Sharon that he was driving the car, Sharon leaves him and reconciles with Ian. Ian is able to get Bobby into boarding school early, and Bobby sees this as his punishment for killing Lucy, but he is reassured by Kathy.\n\n===Killer confession and Max's revenge===\nIan decides to sell his restaurant to pay for Bobby's schooling, which causes protests when it is revealed he is selling to a supermarket chain. Because of this, Ian changes his mind and decides to take Bobby out of the school. Bobby overhears Jane talking to Sharon about this and is angry, so Bobby smashes Jane's car with his hockey stick. A day later, Jane catches Bobby packing a bag. Stating he overheard Jane's conversation with Sharon and he is going back to boarding school, he attempts to run out the front door; Jane drags him back and as she turns around to call Ian, Bobby strikes her over the head with his hockey stick, then twice more after she falls. Bobby interrupts Ian in a crowded Queen Vic and says that he has killed Jane, just like he killed Lucy. Ian, Sharon, Kathy and Ben rush to Jane's aid, and discover she is alive. The crowd in the pub wonder if Bobby is telling the truth or if he is confused. Ben realises that the family knew for some time and is angry because he was arrested for the murder, but tells Ian to get Bobby away to avoid him going to prison. Ian tells Bobby to change his bloodied shirt and they leave as paramedics arrive. However, Mick stops Ian leaving, as he recalls his earlier conversation with Ian and realises that Ian knew Bobby killed Lucy. Mick convinces Ian to return to Jane, and Ian does not allow Bobby in the ambulance. While being questioned about the attack on Jane, Bobby confesses to killing Lucy. Keeble is reluctant to reopen the case, having put a lot of effort into convicting Max; however, when Bobby reveals where the murder weapon is, Bobby is charged with unlawful killing and remanded into custody. Despite Ian's pleas, Jane decides to end their marriage, believing that the Beale family are better off without her and fearing she may be paralysed following Bobby's attack. Bobby is later sentenced to three years in prison for Lucy's murder.\n\nMax is due to have a hearing to be released from prison following Bobby's confession, so Abi and Lauren write a letter to reconcile with him and to meet in The Queen Vic which they give to Stacey, who goes to the court. However, after being released, he posts it back through the letterbox and gets into a taxi as he is still unwilling to forgive them. Lauren tries to run after the taxi, but Max ignores her. Bobby pleads guilty in court and is sentenced to three years for killing Lucy, and one year for GBH upon Jane, to be served concurrently. He is then sent to a young offenders institute to serve his sentence. Upon hearing Ian saying he should have done more for Bobby when he found out the truth, Keeble asks Ian when he found out. He admits that it was on his wedding night, and Keeble opts not to charge him for perverting the course of justice, feeling that everyone has made mistakes in the murder investigation and that Ian has suffered enough. Bobby feels confident he can be released when Ritchie informs him of potential to appeal, but following Jane's wishes, Ian convinces Bobby to avoid doing so, saying that he needs to accept what he did and carry out his punishment like he deserves. Shortly afterwards, Ian receives a threatening note from Max \u2013 saying that he will never forget what Ian did.\n\nOn Christmas Day 2016, Max returns to Albert Square and makes amends with his family; he also apparently forgive Phil and the Beales as well for what they did to him. In 2017, however, it slowly becomes clear that Max is seeking revenge against the square for his wrongful imprisonment \u2013 with Phil and Ian being his particular targets for causing his conviction. Max's vengeful plot sees him perpetuate the events of his brother [[Jack Branning|Jack]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) losing custody of his stepson [[Matthew Mitchell Cotton]] to the latter's father, [[Charlie Cotton (2014 character)|Charlie Cotton]] ([[Declan Bennett]]); and blackmailing Steven before causing his death whilst attempting to kill Jane, whom Max then coerces into leaving the square. During his revenge campaign, Max is revealed to be working for a nefarious company called \"Weyland & Co\" and its leader; [[James Willmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]), who raped Kathy in 1988. Following the revelation of their conspiracy, Max helps Willmott-Brown put his scheme into fruition before eventually getting betrayed. As Willmott-Brown finalises his development in taking over Walford, Max grows distant from his family when they learn about his revenge plot against the community. The aftermath of Max's betrayal quickly sees him spiral out of control, especially when he tries to kill Ian and Phil when they learn about his plot. By Christmas 2017, Max has lost everyone and decides to commit suicide \u2013 but stands out at the last second before Lauren and Abi fall off the roof while trying to talk Max out of suicide. Lauren survives the fall, while Abi dies later in hospital.\n\n===Bobby's redemption===\n\nSixteen months later, Ian receives a letter saying that Bobby will be released in a matter of months, but he believes that Bobby will be better off with Jane, however, Kathy encourages Ian to tell Peter that Bobby is coming home and to be a father to Bobby and bring him back to Walford. Bobby is later released from prison and greeted by Kathy at home, however he suffered an mental illess which led him to experience hallucinations of his deceased sister. He is not welcomed by other residents due to what he and his family did to Max that cause his revenge towards the residents, Steven death & ruined his relationships with his daughters that cause Abi's death and Lauren refused to return back to Walford. Max soon realises that Bobby is a scared child and remorseful for his actions, so welcomes him to the community. Bobby meets with [[List of EastEnders characters (2019)#Imran|Imran]] (Reda Elazouar), a friend from the Young Offenders Unit, who gifts Bobby a [[Quran]] and a prayer mat because he is converting to [[Islam]]. Bobby begins working at his father's restaurant, where he befriends [[Iqra Ahmed]] (Priya Davdra). After realising that Bobby has converted, she invites him to the [[Eid Mubarak]] celebrations at her house.\n\n==Reception==\nKevin O'Sullivan described the storyline as a \"clapped-out whodunit\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-reviews/eastenders-who-killed-lucy-beale-3433798|title=EastEnders Who Killed Lucy Beale? storyline is already boring \u2013 now we have to wait 10 months to find out whodunnit \u2013 Kevin O'Sullivan \u2013 Mirror Online|date=20 April 2014|work=mirror|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref> but other critics were more positive.

It was announced on 21 February 2014 and began on 18 April 2014, when [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]) was discovered dead on Walford Common from a deliberately inflicted head injury. The storyline reached a peak during [[EastEnders Live Week|''EastEnders'' Live Week]] on 19 February 2015, the show's 30th anniversary episode, during which Lucy's brother [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Eliot Carrington) is revealed to have killed her following a confrontation at home. Bobby's adoptive mother, [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]), had covered for him, moving Lucy's body to Walford Common and convincing Bobby that he was not responsible for his sister's death. The storyline was revived in July 2015, where it showed how the Beales coped with covering the secret and many locals being wrongfully arrested for committing the crime. The storyline reached another peak in December 2015, when Bobby discovers the truth. The storyline was revisited again in May 2016; when Bobby brutally attacks Jane, and reveals in a busy pub that he killed her and Lucy. However, Jane survives the attack \u2013 although facing potential [[paralysis]] \u2013 and Bobby is arrested; he is later charged for Lucy's murder. The storyline culminated in the 16 June 2016 episode when Bobby is sentenced to three years in custody for killing Lucy and causing [[grievous bodily harm]] upon Jane. Although Bobby is jailed for Lucy's murder, the story arc would potentially serve as the catalyst for 2017's central storyline \u2013 which sees fellow suspect [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) seeking revenge on the community, particularly Bobby's father [[Ian Beale]] ([[ Adam Woodyatt]]) and his old enemy [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), for allowing him to go to prison for Lucy's murder. {{Fact|date=March 2018}} The storyline is revisited again from June 2019 when Bobby is released from the young offenders institution.\n\n==Storyline creation and development==\nThe murder story is in the style of a \"[[whodunit]]\" mystery.

On Halloween 2014, Abi stalked her sister [[Lauren Branning|Lauren]] wearing a [[Weeping Angel]] mask when she became uncomfortable with Lauren dismissing her problems in favour of her own. During a heated confrontation, Abi tries to drown Lauren. She later denies killing Lucy, but admits that she wishes that she had.\n*'''[[Max Branning]]''', played by [[Jake Wood]]. Prior to [[Good Friday]], it was revealed that Max had been having an affair with [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]]. A few days before her death, the pair had a heated argument, resulting in Lucy falling and hitting her head and he later grabbed her aggressively. Both incidents were captured on CCTV footage and reviewed by [[David Wicks|David]]. David originally blamed Max for the murder, but after the two talk, David decides to keep quiet about the incidents and the laptop containing the evidence is destroyed. Max stated in his alibi that he was at home all night except for when he left for five minutes to walk the dog, which was later confirmed by an anxious [[Abi Branning|Abi]], after her maternal grandmother, [[Cora Cross|Cora]], called the police after noticing Max and Abi cleaning up Lucy's blood from the car lot.\n*'''[[Jay Brown]]''', played by [[Jamie Borthwick]].

[[Jane Beale|Jane]] provides Lauren with an alibi, revealing that from the Masood house, she saw Lauren arrive and leave the Beale house without entering.\n*'''[[Linda Carter]]''', played by [[Kellie Bright]].

Dean was questioned by the police following the murder.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Events leading up to the murder===\n[[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]) decides to set up a letting agency, despite cynicism from her father, [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). Her former colleague [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]) offers to be her business partner but she turns him down in favour of her friend, [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]). It is revealed that Lucy is secretly having a sexual relationship with Lauren's father [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]). She also has sex with [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]), despite being aware that [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]) harbours romantic feelings for Lee. Lucy's behaviour with Lee causes tension between her and Max; during a disagreement in Max's car showroom, Lucy trips and falls, resulting in a minor injury to her head. She then ends her relationship with Max, and continues her relationship with Lee. Max receives an anonymous email that states, \"What have you been doing?\" and contains a photograph of him and Lucy embracing. Lucy's half-sister, [[Cindy Williams (EastEnders)|Cindy Williams]] ([[Mimi Keene]]) becomes jealous of Lucy being Ian's favourite. On Good Friday, Cindy tells Ian and [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) to open Lucy's jewellery box. They find a bag of [[cocaine]] inside. The revelation prompts Ian to cancel a planned trip with his fianc\u00e9e [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) to [[Oxford]] to see her daughter [[Libby Fox|Libby]] ([[Belinda Owusu]]), upsetting Denise. Ian and Jane catch Lee and Lucy having sex in Ian's restaurant. Ian confronts Lucy about the cocaine but she runs off. She goes to the Branning's house to work with Lauren, but leaves after having words with Max. She later returns to speak to Ian, who tells Lucy that she has always been his favourite child. Lucy's twin brother [[Peter Beale]] ([[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]]) overheard this, and storms off. Lucy is furious with Ian and leaves to find Peter. In [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], Whitney is upset when she finds out about Lee and Lucy's relationship. In the Square, Lucy sees her friends going to [[Ronnie Mitchell|Ronnie]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) and [[Roxy Mitchell]]'s ([[Rita Simons]]) house-warming party. Lauren urges her to join them, failing to notice that Lucy is upset, while Whitney shoots angry glares at her. Lucy bumps into Max again rebuffing his advances; he grabs her violently by the wrist. Lucy reads a text and leaves Albert Square for an unknown location.\n\nLucy begins to walk towards the bus stop, texting Peter to ask for [[cocaine]] (he later buys some, but keeps it for himself). On her journey, she passes by her father's chip shop, where she spots Billy stealing fish during his shift. She confronts him and says that she's going to tell Ian. He follows her, grabs her by the wrist and begs her to keep quiet, before suggesting that he fancies her. Disgusted, Lucy heads off towards the bus stop, but is stopped by Lee, who has seen her argument with Billy. He encourages her to join him at the house-warming party, and Lucy agrees to join him later, but must go to show a buyer one of her flats first.\n\nLucy boards the Number 30 bus, and is followed by [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]). Jay meets with [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Harry Reid (actor)|Harry Reid]]), who has just been released from prison following the death of [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Fergison]]). Ben surprises Lucy at the flat, and confronts her about not giving him money that she had originally promised, as he had planned to move to [[Miami]]. An intoxicated [[Jake Stone (EastEnders)|Jake Stone]] ([[Jamie Lomas]]) is revealed to be the potential buyer, but he admits he was only there in hopes of rekindling his romance with Lauren, who he had expected to be showing him the flat. Lucy and Jake take an unlicensed taxi, driven by [[List of EastEnders characters (2014)#Arsim Kelmendi|Arsim Kelmendi]] (Tomasz Aleksander) back to Walford.\n\nWhile out walking his dog, Max spots Lucy struggling to carry Jake back to his flat and reluctantly agrees to help. Max's other daughter [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) watches on, believing they're about to continue their sexual relationship. Once in the flat, Max goads Jake, who attempts to punch him. He misses Max and instead hits Lucy, causing her nose to bleed and her earring to fall out. Lucy goes into the bathroom to clean herself up, and Max tells her that their relationship doesn't have to end but Lucy rebuffs him. She leaves the flat but is robbed of her purse and phone by Ben, who has followed her back to Walford. Lucy begins to walk home and meets Abi, who expresses her disgust at her relationship with her father, and proceeds to slap her.\n\nLucy arrives on the Square, where Jane rushes over to talk to her. Lucy then tells Jane that she has had a terrible night, and asks her to resume living at the Beale house. Jane reminds Lucy about her father's engagement to Denise, but Lucy doesn't believe that they are happy, and asks Jane to be a mother-figure to her once again. Jane says that she doesn't want to return home, but Lucy misinterprets this as Jane rejecting her, and goes home. She then overhears Denise talking to her daughter [[Chelsea Fox]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]) on the phone, and discovers that Denise plans to leave Ian. Lucy confronts Denise, and they engage in a bitter fight which is overheard by Lucy's youngest brother [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby]] (Eliot Carrington). The fight culminates with Lucy slapping Denise and Denise pinning Lucy down on the floor. Elsewhere, Cindy heads to the restaurant looking for Ian, but after not finding him there, leaves a voicemail message for Lucy asking whether she will come home that night. She narrowly misses Lucy and heads to bed with Bobby who feigns being asleep. While jogging, Peter considers returning to the Beale house, but instead returns to Billy's bedsit. Lucy meanwhile sits outside on the street after brawling with Denise, distraught that her life has crumbled around her, as a jealous Whitney looks on. Lee leaves a voicemail for Lucy asking when he will see her, before returning to the party. Ian returns home after sleeping with prostitute [[Rainie Cross]] ([[Tanya Franks]]) and also leaves a message for Lucy, telling her that he's sorry. Lucy goes home and begins writing a letter in the living room. As she does, she is startled by someone when the floorboards creak, and she sees her assailant. Shortly afterwards, Jane receives a panicked phone call, and rushes over to the Beale house, where she sees the door is open. She walks in to find Lucy lying on the living room floor. Jane checks her pulse and is distraught to realise that Lucy is dead. She turns around to find Bobby, who tells her that \"Whatever she [Lucy] says, she started it. She made everyone unhappy\". Jane realises that Bobby is responsible as he is holding Lucy's jewellery box, the one which she stored cocaine in, having used it to hit Lucy with.\n\nJane convinces Bobby that he has done nothing wrong, and reassuring him that Lucy will be fine, sends him to bed. Jane contemplates taking Lucy to the hospital, but when she is unnerved at the devastation it could cause, she instead puts Lucy in the boot of her car, and takes her to Walford Common. Jane says her goodbyes to Lucy and leaves her body.\n\n===Investigation following Lucy's death===\nThe next morning, Lucy's body is discovered by a young girl walking with her grandfather on Walford Common. [[List of EastEnders characters (2014)#DC Emma Summerhayes|DC Emma Summerhayes]] ([[Anna Acton]]) and [[List of EastEnders characters (2014)#DS Bryant|DS Cameron Bryant]] ([[Glen Wallace]]) visit Ian to inform him they have found Lucy's body. Ian is inconsolable as he identifies her body and breaks the news to Jane, Denise, Cindy, Bobby and, later, Peter. It is revealed Lucy died because of a deliberate head injury. The police question the family and search Lucy's bedroom. Cindy tells Ian that Lucy was an habitual user of cocaine. Ian says that he was at his restaurant the previous evening, but Cindy says she went there and did not see him. Ian laments that he did not know his daughter at all and furiously throws Cindy out, forcing her to return to Devon. The police take a DNA sample from Lee before he returns to [[Afghanistan]]. Summerhayes returns to say that there has been a leak at the police station and the press have got hold of some vital information. It is explained that there was very little blood found at the common, meaning that Lucy was not killed in a mugging, but was murdered elsewhere, then dumped on the Common. Her purse and phone are also missing. [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]) discovers Max's sexual relationship with Lucy and accuses him of killing her. Max denies it but David later finds CCTV footage of Max and Lucy arguing on the night of her death. David does not tell the police because he is worried that if Max is questioned it will affect the health of his cancer-stricken fiancee [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsay Coulson]]), who is Max's sister. He says that he does not believe Max killed her and together they burn all computer evidence of the footage.\n\nWhen Lauren reopens LB Lettings for business, she discovers the email intended for her but read by Lucy on the night of her death. The sender is asking that they meet and Lauren suspects it was sent by Lucy's killer. She takes the information to the police but they tell her they are already looking into the matter. Lauren arranges to meet the person herself at a cafe on Walford Common and is stunned to discover it is her former lover, Jake. Jake says that he sent Lauren the email, hoping to reconcile with Lauren and used a false name, guessing she would not reply if she knew it was from him. He arranged to meet her at the cafe, but instead found Lucy there. Jake explains he was very drunk and Lucy accompanied him back to Walford in an unlicensed taxi. He cannot remember any more details. Lauren does not believe him and suspects he made a pass at Lucy, was rejected, he lashed out and killed her. Lauren visits the police again. The police arrest Jake after finding Lucy's blood and one of her earrings in his flat. He is later charged with her murder.\n\nOn the day of Lucy's funeral, Max's youngest daughter, Abi, tells Max that she knew about his sexual relationship with Lucy and that it was she who sent the email and photograph. The relationship is made public and he is ostracised by the residents of Walford. [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Rickman]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) is also concerned when she overhears Cindy talking to Ian about his false alibi. After the funeral, [[Tamwar Masood]] ([[Himesh Patel]]) finds a note in the church to Lucy, \"ROT IN HELL\". He recognises the handwriting as Whitney's and confronts her. Whitney claims that Lucy had been relentlessly cyber-bullying her about her weight and appearance. She admits that she hated Lucy, but denies killing her. Tamwar agrees not to say anything. Following the funeral, Jane decides to take Bobby back to [[Cardiff]] with her, wanting to give him a new start away from the shadow of Lucy's death.\n\nCurious about Ian's false alibi, Sharon and her boyfriend [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) decide to visit Jake in prison and begin to believe that he might be innocent. When they question Ian, he assures them that he is not involved with Lucy's death in any way. Peter discovers that Sharon and Phil are doubting Jake's guilt, so asks Lauren to visit Jake in prison. He tries to find the taxi driver who brought Jake and Lucy back to Walford. Lauren starts to reassess Jake's guilt and joins Peter in the search for the taxi driver, believing that Jake was too drunk to have committed the murder. Max tells Lauren that he saw Jake and Lucy together on [[Good Friday]], and claims that Jake was sober but he has not informed the police. Max also tells Abi about the altercation he had with Lucy in the car showroom and a worried Abi cleans Lucy's blood from the car showroom floor, worried it will implicate Max. Abi claims that Max was at home with her on the night of the killing. When [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]) sees this, she informs the police that Max has new information.\n\nEmma returns to clarify Max and Abi's new statements and Max flirts with her and they have sex. Lauren tracks down Kelmendi, who tells her that Jake was too drunk to stand on the night of Lucy's death, but he refuses to make a statement to the police. Lauren realises that Max lied about Jake being sober. Peter becomes more obsessed than ever about finding Lucy's killer. Ian starts receiving several phone calls and texts from a mysterious \"R\". Becoming more irate, Ian tells the contact not to contact him again. It is later revealed that \"R\" is Rainie, who is blackmailing Ian because he was having sex with her on the night of Lucy's murder, thus confirming that Cindy was telling the truth about Ian having a false alibi.\n\nWhen Lee returns to Walford, he tells his family that he saw Billy arguing with Lucy on the night she was murdered. Lee confronts Billy who confesses to stealing fish from Ian's fish and chip shop, and using a key to enter Jake's flat to steal electricity. He claims that Lucy caught him stealing the fish and threatened to tell Ian. Phil encourages Billy to go to the police and frame Peter, but Billy cannot go through with this. After Billy makes a statement, Jake is released from prison without charge. Billy faces hostility from the Beales and is also confronted by [[Pam Coker]] ([[Lin Blakley]]) who finds photographs of Lucy underneath his fridge. Billy tells her the photographs are Peter's, but later bins them after telling Pam he would return them. The police say that they are still looking for Lucy's purse and mobile phone. The police ask Ian to do a press appeal after the investigation stalls and televise new CCTV footage from the night of Lucy's death, showing her on a bus. It is discovered that on the night of her death, Lucy went to some flats to see a client who has now been eliminated from the police inquiry. Ian struggles to cope when he is hounded by the press and the police do not intervene. Phil believes that the police suspect Ian is hiding something and demands that he tell him what it is. Ian admits to Phil that he was with Rainie. The CCTV footage shows a man wearing a [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]] beanie hat getting off the bus at the same stop as Lucy. Police say they are looking for this person. Jay has the hat and burns it. Jay is questioned by the police but not charged. He and Ian's half-brother, Phil's son Ben were robbing a shop near Walford Common on the night of Lucy's death. It is revealed that Jay buried Lucy's missing purse and phone at the allotments on Ben's instructions.\n\nEmma is removed from the case when her sexual relationship with Max is exposed. Lauren is repeatedly followed by DS Bryant acting under the orders of the head of the investigation [[DI Samantha Keeble]] ([[Alison Newman]]). Denise finds Lucy's phone and purse buried in [[Patrick Trueman]]'s ([[Rudolph Walker]]) allotment. Realising what Denise has found, Jay and Ben panic and unsuccessfully try to steal them back. Denise returns the phone and purse to Ian, and fearing that Ian will turn them over to the police, Ben confesses to Ian that he found a bag containing a phone and purse abandoned on Good Friday, but denies seeing Lucy or realising that they were hers until after learning of her death. Ian phones the police, but Ben pleads his innocence and Ian decides to not report this development, asking Jane to keep the items safe. Ian scrolls through the messages on Lucy's phone and finds a pending text to Peter asking for cocaine. Ian confronts Peter upon his return from a trip to New Zealand, just as he is proposing to Lauren, and Peter admits that he had been supplying Lucy with cocaine before her death in a bid to protect her from dangerous drug dealers. Lauren rejects Peter's proposal and Ian briefly disowns Peter, but they later reconcile.\n\nLee views a video of [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]) taken on the night of the murder and spots Lauren heading to the Beale house, contradicting her alibi. He anonymously turns over the footage to Emma, who questions Lauren. Lauren admits that she went to see Lucy, but left without seeing her. Jane later backs Lauren up, claiming to have seen her leave the Beale house without entering from a window in the Masood house. Shortly before Christmas, Jane and Ian resume their romantic relationship, and Jane proposes to Ian. They plan their wedding for February.\n\nAlthough no longer a policewoman, Emma continues to study her police files. Shortly after Christmas, she seemingly cracks the case, and contacts a mystery person, telling them that she has figured out that they killed Lucy. On New Year's Day, she arranges to meet the person in the park and urges them to go to the police. The unseen person leaves and Emma sends them a text message, saying that she can't keep their secret. Distracted, Emma wanders into the road and is hit by Roxy's car. Although she initially appears to be unharmed, Emma later starts bleeding from her ear and collapses. Max takes her to the hospital, but Emma dies from her injuries.\n\nCarol finds a grief-stricken Max tearing up Emma's file on Lucy. Lauren retrieves the papers from the bin and sets about trying to restore the torn-up pieces. A few weeks later, after proposing to Peter, Lauren finds a missing scrap of paper in her kitchen, and after putting it with the rest of the work, realises some startling information on what happened to Lucy. Deeply disturbed by her discovery, Lauren begins rejecting those around her and breaks her sobriety. Her erratic behaviour is spotted by [[Stacey Slater|Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]), and Lauren admits her concerns that she might be pregnant. She takes a pregnancy test, which turns out to be positive. She later shares her belief that she knows what happened to Lucy. Stacey calls the police but Lauren keeps silent about her theory, handing over Emma's files, but retaining the crucial evidence. She kicks Stacey out of her house, and breaks off her engagement to Peter.\n\nAn emotional Lauren gets a wedding card for Ian and Jane, in which she writes \"I know what happened to Lucy. She died at home.\" She addresses the card to Jane and leaves it in the Beale house on the day of the wedding. Peter finds her, and confronts her about their break-up, but Lauren leaves, refusing to speak to him. Moments before the ceremony is due to begin, Jane finds the card and is visibly shaken. She struggles to recite her vows to Ian, but the pair eventually remarry. Elsewhere, Stacey informs Max of Lauren's discovery and he begins a frantic search across Walford to find her. Lauren returns home and plans to leave Walford, but Max arrives and tries to stop her. Abi interrupts their conversation, allowing Lauren the opportunity to escape. Abi accuses her sister of attention seeking, but Max  informs her that Lauren has figured out who killed Lucy, and accuses Abi of being the killer. Abi admits that she fought with Lucy the night she died, but denies killing her, though admits wishing that she had. After learning of Lauren's pregnancy, Max races to the hospital and attempts to talk her out of having an abortion, but she sends him away. Peter also learns of Lauren's plan, and confronts her. She reveals that she has figured out that Lucy died at home.\n\nAt the wedding reception, a troubled Jane returns home. She contacts Masood, and asks him to take Bobby (now Elliot Carrington) to his house overnight. Masood is confused but noticing how distressed Jane is, agrees to look after Bobby. Ian returns home looking for Jane, while Peter return to The Vic and drags Cindy home. There, he reveals Lauren's discovery and questions the family about their involvement. Realising that Denise was home all night, Ian heads out to find her, but is sidetracked when [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) informs him of the discovery of [[Nick Cotton]]'s ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]) body. Ian speaks to [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]), who confesses that she allowed Nick to die. Ian realises that Lucy may not have been killed out of hate, and tells [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]) that he's putting the final pieces of the puzzle together. Peter spots Denise on the Square and accuses her of killing Lucy, but Ian intervenes and protests Denise's innocence. He then phones home and makes an ambiguous call, instructing the person to get everyone else out of the house because he has figured out what happened. When he returns, Jane is home alone. Ian demands to know what happened, and covering for Bobby, Jane lies and claims to have accidentally killed Lucy during an argument. Ian smashes up the kitchen in rage, attracting the attention of Peter and Cindy. The three confront Jane, but Ian begins to suspect that she is lying, realising that her story makes little sense.\n\nFrom Masood's house, Bobby tries to contact Jane, and Ian realises that Jane is covering for him. Jane crumbles, and admits that on Good Friday, Bobby phoned her in a panic and when she came to the Beale house, she found him standing over Lucy's lifeless body. She reveals that Bobby was frustrated with Lucy for all the trouble she was causing, and after confronting her, lashed out after failing to get through to her. Jane explains that after realising what had happened, she convinced Bobby that he wasn't responsible for Lucy's death and that he is under the belief that Lucy went back out after their argument and was later killed by someone else. Jane also reveals that Emma met her on New Year's Day and was having a hard time deciding whether to reveal the truth. Peter lashes out at Jane and accuses her of betraying Lucy's memory, while Jane protests that Bobby didn't mean to hurt Lucy. They are disturbed when Cindy brings Bobby home, and after seeing his son, Ian decides to keep the circumstances of Lucy's death a secret. He forgives Jane and insists that the family all rally around and keep the secret. Peter refuses, but Cindy empathises with Jane. Hearing the commotion downstairs, Bobby comes down resulting in Peter angrily leaving. Bobby reveals to Cindy that he has kept the letter that Lucy was writing safe since learning about her death. Cindy reveals its contents to the family: Lucy wrote to Ian, telling him that she was sorry for her behaviour and that she wants to change. She tells Ian that she's going to bed, but when he returns home to wake her up so she can tell him that she loves him. An emotional Ian gathers Jane, Cindy and Bobby and the family embrace. Peter leaves the Square and moves to New Zealand with Lauren after telling her that Bobby was the one who killed Lucy and that Jane covered for him. She agrees to keep it a secret.\n\nFive months later, the police arrest Ben on suspicion of the murder. Jane shows Ian that she has kept Lucy's phone and wallet, but they agree to keep them hidden to ensure Ben's release. However, Bobby overhears them talking about Ben, so he takes the items to the police. Phil finds him there and stops him, but later believes that Ben may have killed Lucy, so hands the items to the police himself. The Mitchells hear of this and are angry that Phil did not wipe the fingerprints off the items, and Jay believes he will also be implicated, which he is. As a result, Jay receives a three-month suspended sentence and is [[Electronic tag|tagged]]. However, Abi then tells Phil that she believes Max may have killed Lucy, so Sharon drives her to the police station. Despite being innocent, Max hands himself into the police. Later that day, Max is arrested and charged with Lucy's murder after her blood is found on his shoes (blood from her nosebleed which occurred when Jake hit her), and Ben is released. Ben is furious that Phil handed the items into the police, while Stacey visits Max in prison where he reveals that he believes that Abi killed Lucy. Stacey confronts Abi, which leads to a bitter fight between the pair. Max informs Carol that Abi had attacked Lucy violently on the night of the murder, which is why he thinks she killed her. After confronting Abi, Carol visits the Beales and vows to do all she can to help Max get released from prison and find the real killer.\n\nJane cannot deal with her guilt as she watches Carol fall apart over Max's arrest, and begins helping her by aiding her look for a solicitor and helping her search for Cora, who has been missing for months. Jane tells Carol she knows that Max did not kill Lucy, leading to Carol becoming suspicious. Jane is adamant that she is going to confess to Carol that Bobby killed Lucy, however Ian persuades her not to. After Bobby attempts to throw a brick through Max's car windscreen, Cindy shouts at him at home, leading to him pushing her over; she lands where Jane found Lucy dead on the night of the murder. When Abi and Carol find Cora, Jane decides she will tell Carol that Bobby killed Lucy, but when Cora says she saw Abi and Max cleaning Lucy's blood off the car lot floor after she died, Abi admits that Max and Lucy argued there and that the evidence is stacked strongly against Max. Back at the Beale household, Cindy\u2014believing that Ian and Jane have told Carol and Abi the truth\u2014tells her boyfriend and Carol's grandson [[Liam Butcher]] (James Forde) that Bobby killed Lucy. Cindy learns that Ian and Jane did not tell Carol, and Ian persuades Liam not to reveal the secret, arranging for Cindy and Liam to move to Devon permanently. Cindy and Liam decide not to leave Walford, and Liam attempts to call the police on Bobby, but Ian states that he and Cindy could go to prison for perverting the course of justice. Liam blackmails Ian and Jane into giving him \u00a3100,000 to leave permanently, saying he will go to Germany to live with his father, but Liam eventually agrees to leave without payment. Jane tells Ian that she intends for all the Beales to move away from Walford, but instead, Liam and Cindy leave together without Jane and the others.\n\nCindy sends a video message to Bobby informing him that he killed Lucy and that Jane lied. Sharon watches the message on Bobby's laptop and hides it from Bobby, and later confronts Jane about it. Eventually, Jane confirms to Sharon that Bobby killed Lucy, while Ian deletes the email. Ian pleads with Sharon to keep the information a secret for the sake of his family, but Sharon says she needs time to think about what to do. Sharon decides not to tell Phil the truth about the murder and tells Ian that she will not tell anybody. She later asks Ian and Jane what to expect at Max's trial, after hearing that Ben, Jay, Abi and Lee have all been called to give evidence, so Jane contacts Keeble. Ian, however, visits Dot who says that she wishes she had turned her criminal son, Nick, into the police when he was younger, so Ian takes Bobby away in the middle of the night. The next day, Jane is frantic to discover that Ian and Bobby are nowhere to be seen, so she visits Sharon, who covers for her when Phil starts asking questions. Jane is intent on giving an alibi for Max to his lawyer [[Marcus Christie]] ([[Stephen Churchett]])\u2014who also has history with Phil and Sharon\u2014however Sharon strongly advises Jane against the idea. After a day of worrying, Jane eventually decides to contact Keeble and say that she killed Lucy, however Phil grabs her from behind and stops her from answering the door to Keeble. Keeble eventually leaves, and Phil tells Jane he knows she killed Lucy. She lies that she had an argument with Lucy over drugs. Phil vents his anger over Ben's arrest, and Jane lets slip she is covering for Bobby. Phil is stunned. When Sharon arrives, she tries to convince Phil not to call the police, but when he gets his mobile phone out, Jane punches him out of desperation and expresses how much she loves Bobby. Phil and Sharon convince her to continue protecting Bobby and allow Max to stand trial as Bobby is more important to her than Max is. Jane contacts Ian and Bobby, who are in Kent, and reveals that she will be joining them.\n\n===Max's trial and Kathy's return===\nJane is stunned when Lauren returns and reveals that she knows that Bobby killed Lucy. She pleads with Lauren to stay quiet, however Lauren is determined to have Max released. At court, Lee takes to the stand and Marcus questions his recent sacking from the army due to violent behaviour, leading to Lee breaking down in tears. However, the prosecution, [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Hazel Warren|Hazel Warren]] ([[Clare Higgins]]), points out Marcus's character assassination on Lee. Lauren then decides to tell Jane that she is informing the police of the real killer, but as she leaves the house, her waters break. The following day, Abi is questioned in the docks, and is disgusted when she realises that Max has told Marcus about her fight with Lucy on the night she died. In pure anger, Abi lies that Max revealed to her that he killed Lucy. Abi later feels guilty and confesses to lying, and is shunned by the judge. When Lauren brings her baby [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Louie Beale|Louie]] home, Carol tells her and Abi about how Max has always been a coward, so Lauren visits Max in prison. He reveals that he was planning to write Abi a letter of apology, and swears that Marcus forced him to confess about Abi and Lucy's fight. Lauren, seeing what Carol pointed out, urges Max to stand up for himself if he wants to prove his innocence. Max begins to suspect that Lauren knows more than she is letting on and questions her how she knows he didn't do it if she has a low opinion of him. Lauren does not answer and leaves the prison silently.\n\nAfter Lauren and Abi are horrified when Max once again fails to defend Abi when accusations of her killing Lucy arise in court, Lauren warns Jane not to give evidence as planned, feeling that Max needs to defend himself. After failing to convince Carol to help Max defend himself, Marcus tries to contact Jane, who avoids him because of Lauren's warning. When the prosecution lawyer, Hazel, verbally attacks Max, Carol, who had until this point, lost faith in his innocence, finally agrees to help and encourages Marcus to interrogate him about his abusive childhood that caused his insecurities. Marcus and Jane then secretly come up with a plan to ensure Max will be found innocent. Jane then travels to court the following day and tells the jury that she and Max had sex when Lucy was murdered, though Hazel believes this is just a lie to ensure Max is found not guilty, because Jane had not mentioned this previously. Later, Jane pleads with Phil to help Max and he privately confronts the foreman of the jury in his car. The foreman later states in court that the jury have found Max guilty, which Ian briefly witnesses from outside. As a horrified Carol and Stacey protest, proclaiming his innocence, Max jumps out from his stand, punches Bryant, and quickly escapes the courthouse. Max visits Jane and realises she is covering for Bobby. When Max is rearrested, he shouts that Bobby killed Lucy but it is seen as an act of desperation. Max is sentenced to 20 years for the murder and a further 12 months for escaping lawful custody. Lauren then goes to the police and tells Bryant that it is true that Bobby killed Lucy, but Bryant does not believe her and says that Max deserves what he gets for what happened to Emma.\n\nAfter returning to Walford with Bobby, Ian leaves Jane a suicide note saying he killed Lucy. When Jane finds Ian about to jump off a bridge, he tells her that this is the only way to protect everyone. However, Jane talks him down and he is then surprised to see his supposedly dead mother, [[Kathy Beale|Kathy Sullivan]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]), on the other side of the road. Ian later tells Kathy that Bobby killed Lucy, rebuilding their trust. Jane is horrified that he told Kathy about Bobby, but Ian is confident she will not say anything to the police. Bobby protests over Ian and Jane's decision to move him into Lucy's old bedroom while Kathy moves into his bedroom. After unsuccessfully trying to swap the rooms back, Bobby pushes Jane down the stairs during a scuffle, knocking her unconscious. Jane lies to Kathy that she tripped, but Bobby tells Kathy the truth. Kathy tries to convince Jane that Bobby has anger management problems, and after Bobby later smashes a plate in anger, Jane expresses her concerns to Kathy that Bobby may well have anger issues.\n\nBobby and Sharon's son [[Dennis Rickman Jnr]] ([[Bleu Landau]]) start a feud, leading to Kathy telling Sharon that Bobby pushed Jane down the stairs. Sharon decides to go to the police, so Jane tells Ian of Sharon's plan. Dennis tells Bobby that he killed Lucy, having overheard it from Sharon and Phil. Sharon then has second thoughts after her father and Kathy's husband [[Gavin Sullivan]] ([[Paul Nicholas]]) tells her not to destroy a family. Bobby and Dennis go for a bike ride to Walford Common, so Phil and Ian go looking for them. They find Dennis brutally beaten, while Bobby's return home means Sharon thinks he has harmed Dennis. A distracted and drunk Phil crashes the car, leaving Phil and Ian with cuts and bruises and Dennis in a critical condition. Ian realises Phil was drunk, and when speaking to Jane, also realises Dennis must have told Bobby he killed Lucy. Ian then does a deal with Phil: stop Sharon going to the police about Bobby and Ian will say he drove the car, saving Phil's relationship with Sharon, but ending his own friendship with her. When Bobby throws his television down the stairs, he tells Ian what Dennis told him. Ian confirms that he did kill Lucy but everyone is protecting him out of love. Ian tells Jane, who decides it is time to go to the police. Bobby agrees he should face the police, but Ian decides that a private boarding school will be another way to help him, while keeping the family intact. When Phil confesses to Sharon that he was driving the car, Sharon leaves him and reconciles with Ian. Ian is able to get Bobby into boarding school early, and Bobby sees this as his punishment for killing Lucy, but he is reassured by Kathy.\n\n===Killer confession and Max's revenge===\nIan decides to sell his restaurant to pay for Bobby's schooling, which causes protests when it is revealed he is selling to a supermarket chain. Because of this, Ian changes his mind and decides to take Bobby out of the school. Bobby overhears Jane talking to Sharon about this and is angry, so Bobby smashes Jane's car with his hockey stick. A day later, Jane catches Bobby packing a bag. Stating he overheard Jane's conversation with Sharon and he is going back to boarding school, he attempts to run out the front door; Jane drags him back and as she turns around to call Ian, Bobby strikes her over the head with his hockey stick, then twice more after she falls. Bobby interrupts Ian in a crowded Queen Vic and says that he has killed Jane, just like he killed Lucy. Ian, Sharon, Kathy and Ben rush to Jane's aid, and discover she is alive. The crowd in the pub wonder if Bobby is telling the truth or if he is confused. Ben realises that the family knew for some time and is angry because he was arrested for the murder, but tells Ian to get Bobby away to avoid him going to prison. Ian tells Bobby to change his bloodied shirt and they leave as paramedics arrive. However, Mick stops Ian leaving, as he recalls his earlier conversation with Ian and realises that Ian knew Bobby killed Lucy. Mick convinces Ian to return to Jane, and Ian does not allow Bobby in the ambulance. While being questioned about the attack on Jane, Bobby confesses to killing Lucy. Keeble is reluctant to reopen the case, having put a lot of effort into convicting Max; however, when Bobby reveals where the murder weapon is, Bobby is charged with unlawful killing and remanded into custody. Despite Ian's pleas, Jane decides to end their marriage, believing that the Beale family are better off without her and fearing she may be paralysed following Bobby's attack. Bobby is later sentenced to three years in prison for Lucy's murder.\n\nMax is due to have a hearing to be released from prison following Bobby's confession, so Abi and Lauren write a letter to reconcile with him and to meet in The Queen Vic which they give to Stacey, who goes to the court. However, after being released, he posts it back through the letterbox and gets into a taxi as he is still unwilling to forgive them. Lauren tries to run after the taxi, but Max ignores her. Bobby pleads guilty in court and is sentenced to three years for killing Lucy, and one year for GBH upon Jane, to be served concurrently. He is then sent to a young offenders institute to serve his sentence. Upon hearing Ian saying he should have done more for Bobby when he found out the truth, Keeble asks Ian when he found out. He admits that it was on his wedding night, and Keeble opts not to charge him for perverting the course of justice, feeling that everyone has made mistakes in the murder investigation and that Ian has suffered enough. Bobby feels confident he can be released when Ritchie informs him of potential to appeal, but following Jane's wishes, Ian convinces Bobby to avoid doing so, saying that he needs to accept what he did and carry out his punishment like he deserves. Shortly afterwards, Ian receives a threatening note from Max \u2013 saying that he will never forget what Ian did.\n\nOn Christmas Day 2016, Max returns to Albert Square and makes amends with his family; he also apparently forgive Phil and the Beales as well for what they did to him. In 2017, however, it slowly becomes clear that Max is seeking revenge against the square for his wrongful imprisonment \u2013 with Phil and Ian being his particular targets for causing his conviction. Max's vengeful plot sees him perpetuate the events of his brother [[Jack Branning|Jack]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) losing custody of his stepson [[Matthew Mitchell Cotton]] to the latter's father, [[Charlie Cotton (2014 character)|Charlie Cotton]] ([[Declan Bennett]]); and blackmailing Steven before causing his death whilst attempting to kill Jane, whom Max then coerces into leaving the square. During his revenge campaign, Max is revealed to be working for a nefarious company called \"Weyland & Co\" and its leader; [[James Willmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]), who raped Kathy in 1988. Following the revelation of their conspiracy, Max helps Willmott-Brown put his scheme into fruition before eventually getting betrayed. As Willmott-Brown finalises his development in taking over Walford, Max grows distant from his family when they learn about his revenge plot against the community. The aftermath of Max's betrayal quickly sees him spiral out of control, especially when he tries to kill Ian and Phil when they learn about his plot. By Christmas 2017, Max has lost everyone and decides to commit suicide \u2013 but stands out at the last second before Lauren and Abi fall off the roof while trying to talk Max out of suicide. Lauren survives the fall, while Abi dies later in hospital.\n\n===Bobby's redemption===\n\nSixteen months later, Ian receives a letter saying that Bobby will be released in a matter of months, but he believes that Bobby will be better off with Jane, however, Kathy encourages Ian to tell Peter that Bobby is coming home and to be a father to Bobby and bring him back to Walford. Bobby is later released from prison and greeted by Kathy at home, however he suffered an mental illess which led him to experience hallucinations of his deceased sister. He is not welcomed by other residents due to what he and his family did to Max that cause his revenge towards the residents, Steven death & ruined his relationships with his daughters that cause Abi's death and Lauren refused to return back to Walford. Max soon realises that Bobby is a scared child and remorseful for his actions, so welcomes him to the community. Bobby meets with [[List of EastEnders characters (2019)#Imran|Imran]] (Reda Elazouar), a friend from the Young Offenders Unit, who gifts Bobby a [[Quran]] and a prayer mat because he is converting to [[Islam]]. Bobby begins working at his father's restaurant, where he befriends [[Iqra Ahmed]] (Priya Davdra). After realising that Bobby has converted, she invites him to the [[Eid Mubarak]] celebrations at her house.\n\n==Reception==\nKevin O'Sullivan described the storyline as a \"clapped-out whodunit\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-reviews/eastenders-who-killed-lucy-beale-3433798|title=EastEnders Who Killed Lucy Beale? storyline is already boring \u2013 now we have to wait 10 months to find out whodunnit \u2013 Kevin O'Sullivan \u2013 Mirror Online|date=20 April 2014|work=mirror|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref> but other critics were more positive.

Players can choose between several brawlers that they have unlocked, each with their unique offensive or defensive kit. As brawlers attack and do damage to enemy brawlers, they build up their special ability, called a \"Super\". Each brawler has their own \"Super\" ability, which can, for example, spawn a damage-dealing turret or a complete heal. Each brawler also has two unlockable (passive) abilities called \"Star Powers\", which can be found in \"Brawl Boxes\" (the game's version of a [[loot box]]), or inside the in-game shop once the brawler reaches the maximum power level. Furthermore each brawler also has a unlockable ability called a \"Gadget\". A brawler's gadget appear in Brawl Boxes and in the shop once that brawler reaches power level 7. These abilities are, once unlocked, usable 3 times per match and are activated by pressing a certain green \"Gadget button\" below the attack button. Additional brawlers can be obtained through Brawl Boxes as well. In addition, it is possible to purchase \"skins\" in the shop with gems, which may alter the appearance, animations or sounds of Brawlers.\n\n''Brawl Stars'' has a variety of different game modes with a lot of different maps for each game mode that players can choose from, each one having a different objective.

players or [[Artificial intelligence in video games|AI opponents]] in multiple game modes. Players can choose between several brawlers that they have unlocked, each with their unique offensive or defensive kit. As brawlers attack and do damage to enemy brawlers, they build up their special ability, called a \"Super\". Each brawler has their own \"Super\" ability, which can, for example, spawn a damage-dealing turret or a complete heal. Each brawler also has two unlockable (passive) abilities called \"Star Powers\", which can be found in \"Brawl Boxes\" (the game's version of a [[loot box]]), or inside the in-game shop once the brawler reaches their maximum power level. Furthermore each brawler also has one unlockable ability called a \"Gadget\". A brawler's gadget appear in Brawl Boxes and in the shop once that brawler reaches power level 7. These abilities are, once unlocked, usable 3 times per match and are activated by pressing a certain \"Gadget button\". Additional brawlers can be obtained through Brawl Boxes as well. In addition, it is possible to purchase \"skins\" in the shop with gems, which may alter the appearance, animations or sounds of Brawlers.\n\n''Brawl Stars'' has a variety of different game modes with a lot of different maps for each game mode that players can choose from, each one having a different objective.

After entering the War, the USA had an immediate and crucial need to produce aluminum for aircraft manufacture. [[Alcoa]] and [[Reynolds Metals Company]] established themselves in Arkansas, which had the largest commercially exploitable [[bauxite]] deposit at that time. In 1941, government agency Defense Plant Corporation opened a plant in [[Jones Mill, Arkansas]], with the intent of operating 24/7 to supply the war effort. The government leased the plant to Alcoa for operations. The Jones Mill Plant alone required 120,000 kilowatts (kW) of electrical power to operate; this exceeded the state's entire generation (100,000 kW at peak, excluding outages). Due to the war effort, there was not enough manpower nor raw materials to build further electrical generation. Executives of Southwest power utilities decided to pool their generation resources together to ensure the region's reliability and dependability during the wartime. The existence of Southwest Power Pool was out of necessity and scarcity. After the war, executives saw the expertise and efficiency that was created and decided to remain a power pool.\n\nSouthwest Power Pool was formed Dec. 14, 1941, with 11 regional utilities entering into an inter-company agreement. The 11 companies were: Arkansas Power & Light, Louisiana Power & Light, and Mississippi Power & Light (subsidiaries of [[Entergy]]), Southwestern Gas and Electric and Public Service Company of Oklahoma (now subsidiaries of [[American Electric Power]]), [[Nebraska Public Power District|Nebraska Power]], [[Energy Future Holdings|Texas Power & Light]], Southern Light and Power, [[Oklahoma Gas & Electric|Oklahoma Gas and Electric]], [[Westar Energy|Kansas Gas and Electric]], and [[Empire District Electric]].\n\nOther notable milestones in SPP\u2019s history<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spp.org/documents/31587/spp101%20-%20an%20introduction%20to%20spp%20-%20all%20slides%20for%20print.pdf|title=SPP 101 slides|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>:\n\n1968 - Became NERC Regional Council\n\n1980 - Implemented telecommunications network\n\n1991 - Implemented operating reserve sharing\n\n1994 - Incorporated as nonprofit 1997 Implemented reliability coordination\n\n1998 - Implemented tariff administration\n\n2004 - Became FERC-approved Regional Transmission Organization\n\n2007 - Launched EIS market\n\n2009 - Integrated Nebraska utilities\n\n2010 - FERC approved Highway/Byway cost allocation methodology and Integrated Transmission Planning Process\n\n2012 - Moved to new Corporate Center\n\n2014 - Launched Integrated Marketplace Became regional Balancing Authority\n\n2015 - Integrated System joins SPP\n\n2019 - Launched western reliability coordination services\n\n==Services==\n'''Reliability Coordination''': SPP monitors power flow throughout its footprint and coordinates regional response in emergency situations or blackouts. \n\n'''Tariff Administration''': SPP provides \"one-stop shopping\" for use of the region's transmission lines and independently administers an Open Access Transmission Tariff with consistent rates and terms.

It is known from manuscripts dating from the 5th to the 8th century AD, which were found in [[oasis]] cities on the northern edge of the [[Tarim Basin]] (now part of [[Xinjiang]] in northwest China) and the [[Lop Desert]]. The discovery of this language family in the early 20th century contradicted the formerly prevalent idea of an east\u2013west division of the Indo-European language family on the [[Centum and satem languages|centum\u2013satem isogloss]], and prompted reinvigorated study of the family. Identifying the authors with the ''Tokharoi'' people of ancient [[Bactria]] (Tokharistan), early authors called these languages \"Tocharian\". Although this identification is now generally considered mistaken, the name has remained.\n\nThe documents record two closely related languages, called Tocharian A (also ''East Tocharian'', ''Agnean,'' or ''Turfanian'') and Tocharian B (''West Tocharian'' or ''Kuchean''). The subject matter of the texts suggests that Tocharian A was more archaic and used as a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] liturgical language, while Tocharian B was more actively spoken in the entire area from [[Turfan]] in the east to [[Tumshuq]] in the west. A body of loanwords and names found in Prakrit documents from the [[Lop Nur|Lop Nor]] basin have been dubbed Tocharian C (''Kror\u00e4nian''). A claimed find of ten Tocharian C texts written in [[Kharosthi|Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b]] script has been discredited.<ref name=\"adams-tocharian-c-again\" >{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Douglas Q. |title='Tocharian C' Again: The Plot Thickens and the Mystery Deepens |url=https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=44503 |website=Language Log |accessdate=25 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe oldest extant manuscripts in Tocharian B are now dated to the 5th or even late 4th century AD, making Tocharian a language of [[Late Antiquity]] contemporary with [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Classical Armenian]] and [[Primitive Irish]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kim |first1=Ronald I. |editor1-last=Rieken |editor1-first=Elisabeth |title=100 Jahre Entzifferung des Hethitischen.

The areas of the squares are proportional to population.]]\n\nThe existence of the Tocharian languages and alphabet was not even suspected until archaeological exploration of the Tarim basin by [[Aurel Stein]] in the early 20th century brought to light fragments of manuscripts in an unknown language, dating from the 6th to 8th centuries AD.<ref>Deuel, Leo. 1970.

In the 19th century, it was thought that the division between [[centum\u2013satem isogloss|centum and satem languages]] was a simple west\u2013east division, with centum languages in the west. The theory was undermined in the early 20th century by the discovery of [[Hittite language|Hittite]], a centum language in a relatively eastern location, and Tocharian, which was a centum language despite being the easternmost branch. The result was a new hypothesis, following the [[wave model]] of [[Johannes Schmidt (linguist)|Johannes Schmidt]], suggesting that the satem isogloss represents a linguistic innovation in the central part of the Proto-Indo-European home range, and the centum languages along the eastern and the western peripheries did not undergo that change.{{sfnp|Renfrew|1990|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\nMost scholars reject [[Walter Bruno Henning]]'s proposed link to [[Gutian language|Gutian]], a language spoken on the [[Iranian plateau]] in the 22nd century BC and known only from personal names.{{sfnp|Mallory|Mair|2000|pp=281\u2013282}}\n\nTocharian probably died out after 840 when the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], expelled from Mongolia by the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], moved into the Tarim Basin.<ref name=\"mallory-expedition\"/> The theory is supported by the discovery of translations of Tocharian texts into Uyghur.\n\nSome modern [[Chinese language|Chinese]] words may ultimately derive from a Tocharian or related source, eg.

Samples of the language have been discovered at sites in [[Kucha]] and [[Karasahr]], including many mural inscriptions.\n\nMost of attested Tocharian was written in the [[Tocharian alphabet]], a derivative of the [[Br\u0101hm\u012b script|Brahmi]] alphabetic syllabary ([[abugida]]) also referred to as North Turkestan Brahmi or slanting Brahmi.

Tocharian B, however, is found throughout the range and in both religious and secular texts.  As a result, it has been suggested that Tocharian A was a [[liturgical language]], no longer spoken natively, while Tocharian B was the spoken language of the entire area.<ref name=\"mallory-expedition\"/> On the other hand, it is possible that the lack of a secular corpus in Tocharian A is simply an accident, due to the smaller distribution of the language and the fragmentary preservation of Tocharian texts in general.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe hypothesized relationship of Tocharian A and B as liturgical and spoken forms, respectively, is sometimes compared with the relationship between Latin and the modern [[Romance languages]], or [[Classical Chinese]] and [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]. However, in both of these latter cases the liturgical language is the linguistic ancestor of the spoken language, whereas no such relationship holds between Tocharian A and B.  In fact, from a phonological perspective Tocharian B is significantly more conservative than Tocharian A, and serves as the primary source for reconstructing Proto-Tocharian. Only Tocharian B preserves the following Proto-Tocharian features: stress distinctions, final vowels, diphthongs, and ''o'' vs. ''e'' distinction. In turn, the loss of final vowels in Tocharian A has led to the loss of certain Proto-Tocharian categories still found in Tocharian B, e.g. the vocative case and some of the noun, verb and adjective declensional classes.\n\nIn their declensional and conjugational endings, the two languages innovated in divergent ways, with neither clearly simpler than the other.  For example, both languages show significant innovations in the present active indicative endings but in radically different ways, so that only the second-person singular ending is directly cognate between the two languages, and in most cases neither variant is directly cognate with the corresponding [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) form.  The agglutinative secondary case endings in the two languages likewise stem from different sources, showing parallel development of the secondary case system after the Proto-Tocharian period.  Likewise, some of the verb classes show independent origins, e.g. the class II preterite, which uses reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly from the reduplicated aorist) but long PIE ''\u0113'' in Tocharian B (possibly from the long-vowel perfect found in Latin ''l\u0113g\u012b'', ''f\u0113c\u012b'', etc.).<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\nTocharian B shows an internal chronological development; three linguistic stages have been detected.<ref>M.

While a full report of what languages these texts represent is not yet available, their conclusions appear to have discredited Schmidt's Tocharian C claims.<ref name=\"adams-tocharian-c-again\"/>\n\n==Phonology==\n\nPhonetically, Tocharian languages are \"[[Centum and satem languages|centum]]\" Indo-European languages, meaning that they merge the [[palatovelar]] consonants {{PIE|(*\u1e31, *\u01f5, *\u01f5\u02b0)}} of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto Indo-European]] with the plain [[velars]] (*k, *g, *g\u02b0) rather than palatalizing them to affricates or sibilants. Centum languages are mostly found in western and southern Europe ([[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italic languages|Italic]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Germanic language|Germanic]]). In that sense, Tocharian (to some extent like the [[Greek language|Greek]] and the [[Anatolian languages]]) seems to have been an isolate in the \"[[Centum-Satem isogloss|satem]]\" (i.e. [[palatovelar]] to [[sibilant]]) phonetic regions of Indo-European-speaking populations. The discovery of Tocharian contributed to doubts that Proto-Indo-European had originally split into western and eastern branches; today, the centum\u2013satem division is not seen as a real familial division.{{sfnp|Renfrew|1990|p=107}}<ref name=\"baldi\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=gWY7-DBWPW4C&pg=PA39 [[Philip Baldi|Baldi, Philip]] ''The Foundations of Latin'' (1999), pg 39]</ref>\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! &nbsp;\n!

It is clearly phonemic because sequences ''nk'' and ''\u00f1k'' also exist (from [[Syncope (phonology)|syncope]] of a former ''\u00e4'' between them).\n\n==Proto-Tocharian==\n\n===Vowels===\nProto-Tocharian shows radical changes in its vowels from [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE). Length distinctions eventually disappeared, but prior to that all pairs of long and short vowels had become distinct in quality, and thus have different outcomes. Many pairs of PIE vowels are distinguished in Tocharian only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of palatalization.  For example, PIE ''o'' and ''\u0113'' both evolved into Proto-Tocharian ''\u00eb'' (possibly {{IPAslink|\u025b}}), but PIE ''\u0113'' palatalized the preceding consonant, and left a ''y'' when no consonant preceded, while neither of these occurs with PIE ''o''.\n\nReconstructing the changes between PIE and Proto-Tocharian vowels is fraught with difficulty, and as a result there are a large number of disagreements among different researchers.  The basic problems are:\n*Tocharian A and B are relatively sparsely attested.\n*The extensive mergers of PIE stop consonants lead to many ambiguities in the potential etymologies underlying particular Tocharian words.\n*The radical restructuring of the vowel system means that few potential sound changes can be rejected as unreasonable, no matter how unlikely they may look on the surface.\n*A large amount of analogical change has occurred in both the nominal and verbal systems, making it difficult to identify which changes are regular.\n\nHistorically, the evolution of the Tocharian vowels was the last part of the diachronic phonology to be understood. In 1938, [[George Sherman Lane|George S. Lane]] remarked of Tocharian that \"the vocalism so far has defied almost every attempt that has been made to bring it to order\",<ref>Lane, George S. \"Problems of Tocharian Phonology\". ''Language'', Vol. 14, No. 1 (Jan. \u2013 Mar., 1938), pp. 20\u201338.</ref> and as late as 1945 still asserted: \"That the subject [of palatalization] is a confused and difficult one is generally recognized\u2014but so are most of the problems of Tocharian phonology.\"<ref>Lane, George S. \"The Tocharian Palatalization (I)\". ''Language'', Vol. 21, No. 1 (Jan. \u2013 Mar., 1945), pp. 18\u201326.</ref> However, rapid progress towards understanding the evolution of the vocalic system, and with it the phonology as a whole, occurred during the period of approximately 1948\u20131960, beginning with Sieg and Siegling (1949).<ref>Sieg, Emil and Wilhelm Siegling (1949), ''Tocharische Sprachreste'', Sprache B. Heft 1. Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht.</ref> By 1960, the system was well-enough understood that Krause and Thomas's seminal work of that year{{sfnp|Krause|Thomas|1960}} is still considered one of the most important Tocharian grammatical handbooks.<ref>Ringe, Donald A, Jr. (1990). Review of ''Tocharian Historical Phonology and Morphology'' by Douglas Q. Adams. ''Language'', Vol. 66, No. 2 (Jun., 1990).</ref>\n\nDespite the apparent equivalence between the Tocharian A and B vowel systems, in fact a number of vowels are not cognate between the two varieties, and Proto-Tocharian had a different vowel system from both.  For example, Tocharian A ''a'' reflects a merger of two Proto-Tocharian vowels that are distinguished in Tocharian B as ''e'' and ''o'', while Tocharian B ''a'' reflects a stress-based variant of either Proto-Tocharian ''\u0101'' or ''\u00e4'', while Tocharian A preserves original ''\u0101'' and ''\u00e4'' regardless of the position of stress.\n\nAs a general rule, Tocharian B reflects the Proto-Tocharian vowel system more faithfully than Tocharian A, which includes a number of changes not found in Tocharian B, e.g. monophthongization of diphthongs, loss of all absolutely final vowels, loss of ''\u00e4'' in open syllables, and epenthesis of ''\u00e4'' to break up difficult clusters (esp. word-finally) that resulted from vowel losses.\n\nThe following table describes a typical minimal reconstruction of Late Proto-Tocharian, which includes all vowels that are generally accepted by Tocharian scholars:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! &nbsp;\n!

However, Ringe reconstructs three vowels ''*\u00eb, *e, *\u1eb9'' in place of the single vowel ''*e'' in the minimal system.  The primary distinction is between ''*\u00eb'' < PIE ''*o'', which is assumed to be a central rather than a front vowel because it does not trigger palatalization, and ''*e'' < PIE ''*\u0113'', which does trigger palatalization.  Other than palatalization effects, both vowels are reflected identically in both Tocharian A and B, and hence a number of researchers project the merger back to Proto-Tocharian.  However, some umlaut processes are thought to have operated differently on the two vowels, and as a result Ringe (as well as Adams<ref>Douglas Adams, \"Ablaut and Umlaut in the Tocharian Vowel System\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 98, No. 4 (Oct. \u2013 Dec., 1978), pp. 446- 450.</ref> and some other scholars) prefer to distinguish the two in Proto-Tocharian.  Ringe's ''*\u1eb9'' vowel, a higher vowel than ''*e'', is fairly rare and appears as ''i'' in Tocharian B but ''e'' in Tocharian A.  This vowel does trigger palatalization, and is thought by Ringe to stem primarily from PIE ''*oy'' and from loanwords.  In general, Ringe's Proto-Tocharian reconstruction reflects an earlier stage than the one described by many researchers.\n\nSome scholars use a different notation from what is given above: e.g. ''\u00e6'' or ''\u00eb'' in place of the ''e'' of the minimal system, ''\u00e5'' or ''\u0254'' in place of the ''o'' of the minimal system, and ''\u01dd'' in place of ''\u00e4''.\n\nThe following table shows the changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Proto-Tocharian (PToch) and on to Tocharian B (TB) and Tocharian A (TA), using the notation of the \"minimal\" system above:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

When following a consonant, that consonant is palatalized; otherwise, a ''y'' appears.  Before PIE ''i'', consonants other than dentals are not necessarily palatalized (researchers differ on what exactly happened); this is indicated as (+).\n#A \u2014 sign indicates no vowel; this results from deletion of ''\u00e4'' in open syllables.\n#Tocharian B reflects Proto-Tocharian central vowels (''\u00e4'', ''\u0101'') differently depending on whether they bore stress or not.  This is indicated in the table above: stressed ''\u00e4 \u0101'' > ''a \u0101'' while unstressed ''\u00e4 \u0101'' > ''\u00e4 a'' (i.e. Tocharian B ''a'' reflects either stressed ''\u00e4'' or unstressed ''\u0101'').  An additional complication is that unstressed ''\u00e4'' is deleted in open syllables.  See below.\n\nProto-Tocharian had phonemic stress, although its position varies depending on the researcher. Many researchers project the Tocharian B stress that is recoverable from ''\u0101''~''a'' and ''a''~''\u00e4'' alternations back to Proto-Tocharian. For the most part, this stress does not reflect PIE stress.  Rather, most bisyllabic words have initial stress, and trisyllabic and longer words usually have stress on the second syllable.  A number of multisyllabic words in Tocharian B appear to indicate that more than one syllable was stressed; it is thought that these reflect clitics or affixes that still behaved phonologically as separate words in Proto-Tocharian.  Ringe,<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/> however, prefers to project the PIE stress unchanged into Proto-Tocharian, and assumes that the radically different system seen in Tocharian B evolved within the separate history of that language.\n\nThe outcome of the PIE sequences ''*iH'' and ''*uH'' when not followed by a vowel is disputed.  It is generally agreed that ''*ih\u2082'' became Proto-Tocharian ''*y\u0101''; a similar change occurred in [[Ancient Greek]].  It is also usually accepted that ''*ih\u2083'' likewise became Proto-Tocharian ''*y\u0101'', although it is unclear whether this reflects a direct change ''*ih\u2083 > *y\u0101 /ya/'' or a change ''*ih\u2083 > *y\u014d /yo:/ > *y\u0101 /ya/'' (echoing a similar change in Ancient Greek), since PIE ''*\u014d'' is generally thought to have become Proto-Tocharian ''*\u0101'' (which was not a long vowel).  The outcomes of all other sequences are much less clear.  A number of etymologies appear to indicate a parallel change ''*uh\u2082 > *w\u0101'', but some also appear to indicate a change ''*uh\u2082 > *\u016b > *u''. Ringe<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/> demonstrates that all the occurrences of ''*w\u0101'' can potentially be explained as due to analogy, and prefers to postulate a general sound change ''*uH > *\u016b > *u'' following the normal outcome of ''*uH'' in other languages, but a number of other researchers (e.g. Krause and Slocum<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>) prefer to see ''*uh\u2082 > *w\u0101'' as the regular sound change.  The outcome of ''*ih\u2081'' is likewise disputed, with Ringe similarly preferring a regular change ''*ih\u2081 > *\u012b > i'' while others postulate a regular change ''*ih\u2081 > *ye > *y\u00e4''. As elsewhere, the main difficulty is that, relative to other Indo-European languages, Tocharian is sparsely attested and was subject to a particularly large number of analogical changes.\n\nA number of umlaut processes occurred in the Proto-Tocharian period, which tended to increase the number of rounded vowels.  Vowel rounding also resulted from the influence of nearby labiovelars, although this occurred after the Proto-Tocharian period, with differing results in Tocharian A and B, generally with more rounding in Tocharian A (e.g. PIE ''*g\u02b7\u1e43-'' \"come\" > PToch ''*k\u02b7\u00e4m-'' > Tocharian A ''kum-'' but Tocharian B ''k\u00e4m-'').\n\n===Vowel deletion and insertion===\nTocharian A deletes all Proto-Tocharian final vowels, as well as all instances of Proto-Tocharian ''\u00e4'' in [[open syllable]]s (which appears to include vowels followed by ''Cr'' and ''Cl'' sequences).  When this produces impossible consonant sequences, these are rectified by vocalizing ''w'' and ''y'' into ''u'' and ''i'', if possible; otherwise, an epenthetic ''\u00e4'' is inserted.  Note that most consonant sequences are tolerated word-initially, including unexpected cases like ''rt-'', ''ys-'' and ''lks-''.  Example: PIE ''h\u2081rudhros'' (Greek ''erythros'') > PToch ''r\u00e4\u0301tre'' > Toch A *''rtr'' > ''rt\u00e4r''.\n\nTocharian B deletes only unstressed ''\u00e4'' in open syllables, and leaves all other vowels alone.  Hence PIE ''h\u2081rudhros'' > PToch ''r\u00e4\u0301tre'' > Toch B ''ratre''.  If necessary, impossible consonant sequences are rectified as in Tocharian A.\n\n===Consonants===\nThe following are the main changes between PIE and Proto-Tocharian:\n*[[Centum]] change: PIE \"palatals\" merge with PIE \"plain velars\".\n*Loss of PIE ''d'' (but not other dentals) in a number of words when not followed by a PIE front vocalic.\n*Loss of contrastive voicing and aspiration, resulting in (e.g.) the merger of PIE ''k, g, gh''.\n*Palatalization of all consonants before PIE ''e, \u0113, y'' and sometimes ''i'', producing a number of new phonemes (''c'', ''\u015b'', ''\u1e63'', ''ts'', ''\u00f1'', ''ly'').\n*Loss of final consonants other than ''r'', including total loss of certain final clusters (e.g. ''nts'').\n\nThe extant Tocharian languages appear to reflect essentially the same consonant system as in Proto-Tocharian, except in a couple of cases:\n*A new phoneme ''\u1e45'' {{IPA|/\u014b/}} eventually developed.  This was originally an allophone of ''n'' before ''k'', but became phonemic when vowel losses resulted in instances of ''nk'' and ''\u00f1k'' contrasting with ''\u1e45k'', and occasional loss of ''k'' between consonants resulted in instances of ''\u1e45'' not before ''k''.\n*The Proto-Tocharian labiovelar ''*k\u02b7'' eventually merged with ''k'' in both Tocharian A and B.  However, this clearly post-dated Proto-Tocharian, because the former ''*k\u02b7'' often rounded adjacent vowels prior to its loss, in a way that differed between A and B (e.g. Proto-Tocharian ''*k\u02b7\u00e4m-'' \"come\" > A ''kum-'' but B ''k\u00e4m-''). In addition, according to Ringe,<ref name=\"ringe-adams\">Donald A. Ringe Jr, \"Review of 'Tocharian Historical Phonology and Morphology' by Douglas Q. Adams\", ''Language'', Vol. 66, No. 2 (Jun., 1990), pp. 400\u2013408.</ref> Proto-Tocharian ''*k\u02b7'' is sometimes retained in Tocharian B when directly preceding a voiceless consonant, particularly in western dialect texts.\n\nUnlike in most ''[[centum]]'' languages, Proto-Tocharian maintained separate outcomes of PIE ''*k\u02b7'' and ''*\u1e31w''.<ref name=\"ringe-adams\"/> The latter is still reflected as ''kw'' in Tocharian B, e.g. ''yakwe'' \"horse\" < PIE ''*e\u1e31wos''.\n\n===Palatalization===\n[[Palatalization (sound change)|Palatalization]] was a very important process operating in Proto-Tocharian.  Palatalization appears to have operated very early, prior to almost all of the vowel changes that took place between PIE and Proto-Tocharian. Palatalization occurred before PIE ''e'', ''\u0113'', ''y'' and sometimes ''i''; specifically, PIE ''i'' triggered palatalization of dentals but generally not of velars or labials. (According to Ringe,<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/> lack of palatalization before PIE ''i'' was actually due to early change of ''i'' > ''w\u01dd'' after certain sounds.) Palatalization, or lack thereof, is the only way to distinguish PIE ''e'' and ''i'' in Tocharian, and the primary way of distinguishing certain other pairs of PIE vowels, e.g. ''e'' vs. ''u'' and ''\u0113'' vs. ''o''. Palatalization appeared to have operated in two stages, an earlier one that affected only the sequences ''ty'' and ''dhy'', and a later more general one \u2014 or at least, the result of palatalization of ''t'' and ''dh'' before ''y'' is different from palatalization before ''e, \u0113'' and ''i'', while other consonants do not show such a dual outcome. (A similar situation occurred in the history of [[Proto-Greek]] and [[Proto-Romance]].) Certain sound changes occurred prior to palatalization:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n#Some changes involving PIE dentals; see below.\n#The development of PIE ''iH'' into ''y'' + vowel.

Palatalization sometimes produces ''c'', sometimes ''ts'', sometimes ''\u015b'', and in some words when a front vocalic does not follow, PIE ''*d'' (but not other dentals) is lost entirely, e.g. e.g. Toch AB ''or'' \"wood\" < PIE ''*doru'' and Toch B ''ime'' \"thought\" < PToch ''*w'\u00e4im\u00eb'' < PIE ''*weid-mo-''.  Many occurrences of ''c'' and ''ts'' can be explained by the differing effects of a following ''y'' vs. a front vowel (see above), but a number of difficult cases remain.\n\nMost researchers agree that some of the PIE dentals are reflected differently from others \u2014 contrary to the situation with all other PIE stops.  This in turn suggests that some sound changes must have operated on particular dentals, but not others, prior to the general loss of contrastive voicing and aspiration.  There is a large amount of disagreement over what exactly the relevant sound changes were, due to the relatively small number of extant forms involved, the operation of analogy, and disagreement over particular etymologies, including both the PIE roots and ablaut forms involved.  Ringe suggests the following changes, in approximate order:<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/>\n#[[Grassmann's Law]], which triggers the change ''dh > d'' when another aspirated consonant occurs later in a word (and which also operated in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]).\n#The change ''d'' > ''dz'', which occurred after Grassmann's Law if it existed.\n#Loss of contrastive voicing and aspiration (which may have occurred after palatalization).\n#Palatalization.  The new sound ''ts'' palatalizes to ''\u015b''; this explains cases like Toch B ''\u015bak'', Toch A ''\u015b\u00e4k'' \"ten\" < PIE ''*dek\u1e43(t)''.\n#Loss of ''ts'' before consonants.\n\nEven with this explanation, a lot of words don't have the expected outcomes and require appeal to analogy.  For example, the assumption of Grassmann's Law helps to explain only two words, both verbs, in which PIE ''*dh'' shows up as ''ts''; and in both of these words, palatalization to ''\u015b'' might have been expected, because the present-tense forms both begin with PIE ''*dhe-''. Ringe needs to appeal to an analogical depalatalization, based on other forms of the verb with different ablaut patterns in which palatalization was not triggered. This assumption is reasonable, because a lot of other verbs also show analogical depalatalization; but nonetheless, it is rather slender evidence, and it is not surprising that other researchers have proposed different assumptions (e.g. that PToch ''*ts\u00e4-'' is the expected outcome of PIE ''*dhe-'', with no operation of Grassmann's Law).\n\nLikewise, the loss of PIE ''*d'' in Toch AB ''or'' \"wood\" < PIE ''*doru'' is not explainable by these rules, because it is lost before a vowel rather than a consonant.  Ringe again assumes analogy: In this case, the PIE conjugation was nominative ''*doru'', genitive ''*dreus'', and Ringe assumes that the normal loss of ''*d'' in the genitive before ''*r'' was carried over into the nominative. Again, not all researchers accept this. For example, Krause and Slocum, while accepting the remainder of Ringe's sound changes involving PIE ''*d'', suggest instead that loss eventually occurred before Proto-Tocharian rounded vowels and before Proto-Tocharian ''\u00eb'' (from PIE ''o''), as well as before nasals and possibly other consonants.<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n==Morphology==\n\n===Nouns===\nTocharian has completely re-worked the [[declension|nominal declension]] system of Proto-Indo-European.{{sfnp|Beekes|1995|p=92}} The only cases inherited from the proto-language are nominative, genitive, [[accusative case|accusative]], and (in Tocharian B only) vocative; in Tocharian the old accusative is known as the ''oblique'' case. In addition to these primary cases, however, each Tocharian language has six cases formed by the addition of an invariant suffix to the oblique case \u2014 although the set of six cases is not the same in each language, and the suffixes are largely non-cognate.

An example is ''{{IAST|e\u1e45kwe}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|o\u1e45k}}'' (Toch A) \"man\", which belongs to the same declension as above, but has oblique singular ''{{IAST|e\u1e45kwe\u1e43}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|o\u1e45ka\u1e43}}'' (Toch A), and corresponding oblique stems ''{{IAST|e\u1e45kwe\u1e43-}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|o\u1e45kn-}}'' (Toch A) for the secondary cases.  This is thought to stem from the generalization of ''n''-stem adjectives as an indication of determinative semantics, seen most prominently in the weak adjective declension in the [[Germanic languages]] (where it cooccurs with definite articles and determiners), but also in Latin and Greek ''n''-stem nouns (especially proper names) formed from adjectives, e.g. Latin ''Cat\u014d'' (genitive ''Cat\u014dnis'') literally \"the sly one\" {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} < ''catus'' \"sly\", Greek ''Pl\u00e1t\u014dn'' literally \"the broad-shouldered one\" < ''plat\u00fas'' \"broad\".<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n===Verbs===\nIn contrast, the verb [[grammatical conjugation|verbal conjugation]] system is quite conservative.{{sfnp|Beekes|1995|p=20}} The majority of Proto-Indo-European verbal classes and categories are represented in some manner in Tocharian, although not necessarily with the same function.<ref>Douglas Q. Adams, \"On the Development of the Tocharian Verbal System\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 98, No. 3 (Jul. \u2013 Sep., 1978), pp. 277- 288.</ref> Some examples: athematic and thematic present tenses, including null-, ''-y-'', ''-s\u1e31-'', ''-s-'', ''-n-'' and ''-nH-'' suffixes as well as ''n''-infixes and various laryngeal-ending stems; ''o''-grade and possibly lengthened-grade perfects (although lacking reduplication or augment); sigmatic, reduplicated, thematic and possibly lengthened-grade aorists; optatives; imperatives; and possibly PIE subjunctives.\n\nIn addition, most PIE sets of endings are found in some form in Tocharian (although with significant innovations), including thematic and athematic endings, primary (non-past) and secondary (past) endings, active and mediopassive endings, and perfect endings.  Dual endings are still found, although they are rarely attested and generally restricted to the third person. The mediopassive still reflects the distinction between primary ''-r'' and secondary ''-i'', effaced in most Indo-European languages.  Both root and suffix ablaut is still well-represented, although again with significant innovations.\n\n====Categories====\nTocharian verbs are conjugated in the following categories:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n*Mood: indicative, subjunctive, optative, imperative.\n*Tense/aspect (in the indicative only): present, preterite, imperfect.\n*Voice: active, mediopassive, deponent.\n*Person: 1st, 2nd, 3rd.\n*Number: singular, dual, plural.\n*Causation: basic, causative.\n*Non-finite: active participle, mediopassive participle, present gerundive, subjunctive gerundive.\n\n====Classes====\nA given verb belongs to one of a large number of classes, according to its conjugation.  As in [[Sanskrit]], [[Ancient Greek]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Latin]], there are independent sets of classes in the indicative present, subjunctive, perfect, imperative, and to a limited extent optative and imperfect, and there is no general correspondence among the different sets of classes, meaning that each verb must be specified using a number of [[principal parts]].\n\n=====Present indicative=====\nThe most complex system is the present indicative, consisting of 12 classes, 8 thematic and 4 athematic, with distinct sets of thematic and athematic endings.  The following classes occur in Tocharian B (some are missing in Tocharian A):\n*I: Athematic without suffix < PIE root athematic.\n*II: Thematic without suffix < PIE root thematic.\n*III: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-\u00eb-''. Mediopassive only.  Apparently reflecting consistent PIE ''o'' theme rather than the normal alternating ''o/e'' theme.\n*IV: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-\u0254-''. Mediopassive only.  Same PIE origin as previous class, but diverging within Proto-Tocharian.\n*V: Athematic with PToch suffix ''*-\u0101-'', likely from either PIE verbs ending in a syllabic laryngeal or PIE derived verbs in ''*-eh\u2082-'' (but extended to other verbs).\n*VI: Athematic with PToch suffix ''*-n\u0101-'', from PIE verbs in ''*-nH-''.\n*VII: Athematic with infixed nasal, from PIE infixed nasal verbs.\n*VIII: Thematic with suffix ''-s-'', possibly from PIE ''-s\u1e31-''?\n*IX: Thematic with suffix ''-sk-'' < PIE ''-s\u1e31-''.\n*X: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-n\u00e4sk/n\u0101sk-'' (evidently a combination of classes VI and IX).\n*XI: Thematic in PToch suffix ''*-s\u00e4sk-'' (evidently a combination of classes VIII and IX).\n*XII: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-(\u00e4)\u00f1\u00f1-'' < either PIE ''*-n-y-'' (denominative to n-stem nouns) or PIE ''*-nH-y-'' (deverbative from PIE ''*-nH-'' verbs).\n\nPalatalization of the final root consonant occurs in the 2nd singular, 3rd singular, 3rd dual and 2nd plural in thematic classes II and VIII-XII as a result of the original PIE thematic vowel ''e''.\n\n=====Subjunctive=====\nThe subjunctive likewise has 12 classes, denoted i through xii.  Most are conjugated identically to the corresponding indicative classes; indicative and subjunctive are distinguished by the fact that a verb in a given indicative class will usually belong to a different subjunctive class.\n\nIn addition, four subjunctive classes differ from the corresponding indicative classes, two \"special subjunctive\" classes with differing suffixes and two \"varying subjunctive\" classes with root ablaut reflecting the PIE perfect.\n\nSpecial subjunctives:\n*iv: Thematic with suffix ''i'' < PIE ''-y-'', with consistent palatalization of final root consonant.  Tocharian B only, rare.\n*vii: Thematic (''not'' athematic, as in indicative class VII) with suffix ''\u00f1'' < PIE ''-n-'' (palatalized by thematic ''e'', with palatalized variant generalized).\n\nVarying subjunctives:\n*i: Athematic without suffix, with root ablaut reflecting PIE ''o''-grade in active singular, zero-grade elsewhere.  Derived from PIE perfect.\n*v: Identical to class i but with PToch suffix ''*-\u0101-'', originally reflecting laryngeal-final roots but generalized.\n\n=====Preterite=====\nThe preterite has 6 classes:\n*I: The most common class, with a suffix ''\u0101'' < PIE ''\u1e24'' (i.e. roots ending in a laryngeal, although widely extended to other roots).  This class shows root ablaut, with original ''e''-grade (and palatalization of the initial root consonant) in the active singular, contrasting with zero-grade (and no palatalization) elsewhere.\n*II: This class has reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly reflecting the PIE reduplicated aorist).  However, Tocharian B has a vowel reflecting long PIE ''\u0113'', along with palatalization of the initial root consonant.  There is no ablaut in this class.\n*III: This class has a suffix ''s'' in the 3rd singular active and throughout the mediopassive, evidently reflecting the PIE sigmatic aorist.  Root ablaut occurs between active and mediopassive.  A few verbs have palatalization in the active along with ''s'' in the 3rd singular, but no palatalization and no ''s'' in the mediopassive, along with no root ablaut (the vowel reflects PToch ''\u00eb'').  This suggests that, for these verbs in particular, the active originates in the PIE sigmatic aorist (with ''s'' suffix and ''\u0113'' vocalism) while the mediopassive stems from the PIE perfect (with ''o'' vocalism).\n*IV: This class has suffix ''\u1e63\u1e63\u0101'', with no ablaut.  Most verbs in this class are causatives.\n*V: This class has suffix ''\u00f1(\u00f1)\u0101'', with no ablaut.  Only a few verbs belong to this class.\n*VI: This class, which has only two verbs, is derived from the PIE thematic aorist.  As in Greek, this class has different endings from all the others, which partly reflect the PIE secondary endings (as expected for the thematic aorist).\n\nAll except preterite class VI have a common set of endings that stem from the PIE perfect endings, although with significant innovations.\n\n=====Imperative=====\nThe imperative likewise shows 6 classes, with a unique set of endings, found only in the second person, and a prefix beginning with ''p-''.  This prefix usually reflects Proto-Tocharian ''*p\u00e4-'' but unexpected connecting vowels occasionally occur, and the prefix combines with vowel-initial and glide-initial roots in unexpected ways.  The prefix is often compared with the Slavic perfective prefix ''po-'', although the phonology is difficult to explain.\n\nClasses i through v tend to co-occur with preterite classes I through V, although there are many exceptions.  Class vi is not so much a coherent class as an \"irregular\" class with all verbs not fitting in other categories.  The imperative classes tend to share the same suffix as the corresponding preterite (if any), but to have root vocalism that matches the vocalism of a verb's subjunctive.  This includes the root ablaut of subjunctive classes i and v, which tend to co-occur with imperative class i.\n\n=====Optative and imperfect=====\nThe optative and imperfect have related formations. The optative is generally built by adding ''i'' onto the subjunctive stem.  Tocharian B likewise forms the imperfect by adding ''i'' onto the present indicative stem, while Tocharian A has 4 separate imperfect formations: usually ''\u0101'' is added to the subjunctive stem, but occasionally to the indicative stem, and sometimes either ''\u0101'' or ''s'' is added directly onto the root.  The endings differ between the two languages: Tocharian A uses present endings for the optative and preterite endings for the imperfect, while Tocharian B uses the same endings for both, which are a combination of preterite and unique endings (the latter used in the singular active).\n\n====Endings====\nAs suggested by the above discussion, there are a large number of sets of endings.  The present-tense endings come in both thematic and athematic variants, although they are related, with the thematic endings generally reflecting a theme vowel (PIE ''e'' or ''o'') plus the athematic endings.  There are different sets for the preterite classes I through V; preterite class VI; the imperative; and in Tocharian B, in the singular active of the optative and imperfect.  Furthermore, each set of endings comes with both active and mediopassive forms.  The mediopassive forms are quite conservative, directly reflecting the PIE variation between ''-r'' in the present and ''-i'' in the past. (Most other languages with the mediopassive have generalized one of the two.)\n\nThe present-tense endings are almost completely divergent between Tocharian A and B.  The following shows the thematic endings, with their origin:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+Thematic present active indicative endings\n! rowspan=2| !! rowspan=2|Original PIE !! colspan=2|Tocharian B !! colspan=2|Tocharian A !! rowspan=2|Notes\n|-\n!

It is known from manuscripts dating from the 5th to the 8th century AD, which were found in [[oasis]] cities on the northern edge of the [[Tarim Basin]] (now part of [[Xinjiang]] in northwest China) and the [[Lop Desert]]. The discovery of this language family in the early 20th century contradicted the formerly prevalent idea of an east\u2013west division of the Indo-European language family on the [[Centum and satem languages|centum\u2013satem isogloss]], and prompted reinvigorated study of the family. Identifying the authors with the ''Tokharoi'' people of ancient [[Bactria]] (Tokharistan), early authors called these languages \"Tocharian\". Although this identification is now generally considered mistaken, the name has remained.\n\nThe documents record two closely related languages, called Tocharian A (also ''East Tocharian'', ''Agnean,'' or ''Turfanian'') and Tocharian B (''West Tocharian'' or ''Kuchean''). The subject matter of the texts suggests that Tocharian A was more archaic and used as a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] liturgical language, while Tocharian B was more actively spoken in the entire area from [[Turfan]] in the east to [[Tumshuq]] in the west. A body of loanwords and names found in Prakrit documents from the [[Lop Nur|Lop Nor]] basin have been dubbed Tocharian C (''Kror\u00e4nian''). A claimed find of ten Tocharian C texts written in [[Kharosthi|Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b]] script has been discredited.<ref name=\"adams-tocharian-c-again\" >{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Douglas Q. |title='Tocharian C' Again: The Plot Thickens and the Mystery Deepens |url=https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=44503 |website=Language Log |accessdate=25 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe oldest extant manuscripts in Tocharian B are now dated to the 5th or even late 4th century AD, making Tocharian a language of [[Late Antiquity]] contemporary with [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Classical Armenian]] and [[Primitive Irish]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kim |first1=Ronald I. |editor1-last=Rieken |editor1-first=Elisabeth |title=100 Jahre Entzifferung des Hethitischen.

In the 19th century, it was thought that the division between [[centum\u2013satem isogloss|centum and satem languages]] was a simple west\u2013east division, with centum languages in the west. The theory was undermined in the early 20th century by the discovery of [[Hittite language|Hittite]], a centum language in a relatively eastern location, and Tocharian, which was a centum language despite being the easternmost branch. The result was a new hypothesis, following the [[wave model]] of [[Johannes Schmidt (linguist)|Johannes Schmidt]], suggesting that the satem isogloss represents a linguistic innovation in the central part of the Proto-Indo-European home range, and the centum languages along the eastern and the western peripheries did not undergo that change.{{sfnp|Renfrew|1990|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\nMost scholars reject [[Walter Bruno Henning]]'s proposed link to [[Gutian language|Gutian]], a language spoken on the [[Iranian plateau]] in the 22nd century BC and known only from personal names.{{sfnp|Mallory|Mair|2000|pp=281\u2013282}}\n\nTocharian probably died out after 840 when the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], expelled from Mongolia by the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], moved into the Tarim Basin.<ref name=\"mallory-expedition\"/> The theory is supported by the discovery of translations of Tocharian texts into Uyghur.\n\nSome modern [[Chinese language|Chinese]] words may ultimately derive from a Tocharian or related source, eg.

In 1907, Emil Sieg and [[Friedrich W. K.

Besides the Buddhist and [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] religious texts, there were also monastery correspondence and accounts, commercial documents, caravan permits, medical and magical texts, and one love poem.\n\nIn 1998, Chinese linguist [[Ji Xianlin]] published a translation and analysis of fragments of a Tocharian ''[[Maitreyasamitin\u0101\u1e6daka|Maitreyasamiti-Nataka]]'' discovered in 1974 in [[Yanqi Hui Autonomous County|Yanqi]].<ref>\"[http://www.salon.com/tech/htww/2008/01/29/fragments_of_the_tocharian/index.html Fragments of the Tocharian]\", Andrew Leonard, ''How the World Works'', [[Salon.com]], January 29, 2008. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201082951/http://www.salon.com/tech/htww/2008/01/29/fragments_of_the_tocharian/index.html |date=2008-02-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Review: ''Fragments of the Tocharian A Maitreyasamiti-N\u0101\u1e6daka of the Xinjiang Museum, China.

Tocharian B, however, is found throughout the range and in both religious and secular texts.  As a result, it has been suggested that Tocharian A was a [[liturgical language]], no longer spoken natively, while Tocharian B was the spoken language of the entire area.<ref name=\"mallory-expedition\"/> On the other hand, it is possible that the lack of a secular corpus in Tocharian A is simply an accident, due to the smaller distribution of the language and the fragmentary preservation of Tocharian texts in general.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe hypothesized relationship of Tocharian A and B as liturgical and spoken forms, respectively, is sometimes compared with the relationship between Latin and the modern [[Romance languages]], or [[Classical Chinese]] and [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]. However, in both of these latter cases the liturgical language is the linguistic ancestor of the spoken language, whereas no such relationship holds between Tocharian A and B.  In fact, from a phonological perspective Tocharian B is significantly more conservative than Tocharian A, and serves as the primary source for reconstructing Proto-Tocharian. Only Tocharian B preserves the following Proto-Tocharian features: stress distinctions, final vowels, diphthongs, and ''o'' vs. ''e'' distinction. In turn, the loss of final vowels in Tocharian A has led to the loss of certain Proto-Tocharian categories still found in Tocharian B, e.g. the vocative case and some of the noun, verb and adjective declensional classes.\n\nIn their declensional and conjugational endings, the two languages innovated in divergent ways, with neither clearly simpler than the other.  For example, both languages show significant innovations in the present active indicative endings but in radically different ways, so that only the second-person singular ending is directly cognate between the two languages, and in most cases neither variant is directly cognate with the corresponding [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) form.  The agglutinative secondary case endings in the two languages likewise stem from different sources, showing parallel development of the secondary case system after the Proto-Tocharian period.  Likewise, some of the verb classes show independent origins, e.g. the class II preterite, which uses reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly from the reduplicated aorist) but long PIE ''\u0113'' in Tocharian B (possibly from the long-vowel perfect found in Latin ''l\u0113g\u012b'', ''f\u0113c\u012b'', etc.).<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\nTocharian B shows an internal chronological development; three linguistic stages have been detected.<ref>M. Peyrot, ''Variation and Change in Tocharian B'', Amsterdam and New York, 2008</ref> The oldest stage is attested only in Kucha. There are also the middle (\u2018classical\u2019), and the late stage.<ref>Micha\u00ebl Peyrot (2015), [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/tocharian-language TOCHARIAN LANGUAGE] iranicaonline.org</ref>\n\n== Tocharian C ==\nBased on 3rd-century Loulan G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b Prakrit documents containing Tocharian loanwords such as ''kilme'' 'district', ''\u1e63o\u1e63tha\u1e43ga'' 'tax collector', and ''\u1e63ilpoga'' 'document', T.

Based on morphology, Tocharian C is more closely related to Tocharian B than to Tocharian A, as shown by the secondary cases in Tocharian C are more closely related to Tocharian B than to A (e.g. ablative A ''\u2013V\u1e63'', B ''\u2013me\u1e43'', C ''\u2013ma\u1e43''; 3rd person singular present suffix A ''\u2013\u1e63'', B ''\u2013\u1e43'', C ''\u2013\u1e43'').

While a full report of what languages these texts represent is not yet available, their conclusions appear to have discredited Schmidt's Tocharian C claims.<ref name=\"adams-tocharian-c-again\"/>\n\n==Phonology==\n\nPhonetically, Tocharian languages are \"[[Centum and satem languages|centum]]\" Indo-European languages, meaning that they merge the [[palatovelar]] consonants {{PIE|(*\u1e31, *\u01f5, *\u01f5\u02b0)}} of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto Indo-European]] with the plain [[velars]] (*k, *g, *g\u02b0) rather than palatalizing them to affricates or sibilants. Centum languages are mostly found in western and southern Europe ([[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italic languages|Italic]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Germanic language|Germanic]]). In that sense, Tocharian (to some extent like the [[Greek language|Greek]] and the [[Anatolian languages]]) seems to have been an isolate in the \"[[Centum-Satem isogloss|satem]]\" (i.e. [[palatovelar]] to [[sibilant]]) phonetic regions of Indo-European-speaking populations. The discovery of Tocharian contributed to doubts that Proto-Indo-European had originally split into western and eastern branches; today, the centum\u2013satem division is not seen as a real familial division.{{sfnp|Renfrew|1990|p=107}}<ref name=\"baldi\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=gWY7-DBWPW4C&pg=PA39 [[Philip Baldi|Baldi, Philip]] ''The Foundations of Latin'' (1999), pg 39]</ref>\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! &nbsp;\n!

For example, the sound ''a'' did not occur in Proto-Tocharian. Tocharian B ''a''  is derived from former stressed ''\u00e4'' or unstressed ''\u0101'' (reflected unchanged in Tocharian A), while Tocharian A ''a'' stems from Proto-Tocharian {{IPA|/\u025b/}} or {{IPA|/\u0254/}} (reflected as {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} in Tocharian B), and Tocharian A ''e'' and ''o'' stem largely from monophthongization of former diphthongs (still present in Tocharian B).\n\n===Diphthongs===\nDiphthongs occur in Tocharian B only.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! &nbsp;\n!

It is clearly phonemic because sequences ''nk'' and ''\u00f1k'' also exist (from [[Syncope (phonology)|syncope]] of a former ''\u00e4'' between them).\n\n==Proto-Tocharian==\n\n===Vowels===\nProto-Tocharian shows radical changes in its vowels from [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE). Length distinctions eventually disappeared, but prior to that all pairs of long and short vowels had become distinct in quality, and thus have different outcomes. Many pairs of PIE vowels are distinguished in Tocharian only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of palatalization.  For example, PIE ''o'' and ''\u0113'' both evolved into Proto-Tocharian ''\u00eb'' (possibly {{IPAslink|\u025b}}), but PIE ''\u0113'' palatalized the preceding consonant, and left a ''y'' when no consonant preceded, while neither of these occurs with PIE ''o''.\n\nReconstructing the changes between PIE and Proto-Tocharian vowels is fraught with difficulty, and as a result there are a large number of disagreements among different researchers.  The basic problems are:\n*Tocharian A and B are relatively sparsely attested.\n*The extensive mergers of PIE stop consonants lead to many ambiguities in the potential etymologies underlying particular Tocharian words.\n*The radical restructuring of the vowel system means that few potential sound changes can be rejected as unreasonable, no matter how unlikely they may look on the surface.\n*A large amount of analogical change has occurred in both the nominal and verbal systems, making it difficult to identify which changes are regular.\n\nHistorically, the evolution of the Tocharian vowels was the last part of the diachronic phonology to be understood. In 1938, [[George Sherman Lane|George S. Lane]] remarked of Tocharian that \"the vocalism so far has defied almost every attempt that has been made to bring it to order\",<ref>Lane, George S. \"Problems of Tocharian Phonology\". ''Language'', Vol. 14, No. 1 (Jan. \u2013 Mar., 1938), pp. 20\u201338.</ref> and as late as 1945 still asserted: \"That the subject [of palatalization] is a confused and difficult one is generally recognized\u2014but so are most of the problems of Tocharian phonology.\"<ref>Lane, George S. \"The Tocharian Palatalization (I)\". ''Language'', Vol. 21, No. 1 (Jan. \u2013 Mar., 1945), pp. 18\u201326.</ref> However, rapid progress towards understanding the evolution of the vocalic system, and with it the phonology as a whole, occurred during the period of approximately 1948\u20131960, beginning with Sieg and Siegling (1949).<ref>Sieg, Emil and Wilhelm Siegling (1949), ''Tocharische Sprachreste'', Sprache B. Heft 1. Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht.</ref> By 1960, the system was well-enough understood that Krause and Thomas's seminal work of that year{{sfnp|Krause|Thomas|1960}} is still considered one of the most important Tocharian grammatical handbooks.<ref>Ringe, Donald A, Jr. (1990). Review of ''Tocharian Historical Phonology and Morphology'' by Douglas Q. Adams. ''Language'', Vol. 66, No. 2 (Jun., 1990).</ref>\n\nDespite the apparent equivalence between the Tocharian A and B vowel systems, in fact a number of vowels are not cognate between the two varieties, and Proto-Tocharian had a different vowel system from both.  For example, Tocharian A ''a'' reflects a merger of two Proto-Tocharian vowels that are distinguished in Tocharian B as ''e'' and ''o'', while Tocharian B ''a'' reflects a stress-based variant of either Proto-Tocharian ''\u0101'' or ''\u00e4'', while Tocharian A preserves original ''\u0101'' and ''\u00e4'' regardless of the position of stress.\n\nAs a general rule, Tocharian B reflects the Proto-Tocharian vowel system more faithfully than Tocharian A, which includes a number of changes not found in Tocharian B, e.g. monophthongization of diphthongs, loss of all absolutely final vowels, loss of ''\u00e4'' in open syllables, and epenthesis of ''\u00e4'' to break up difficult clusters (esp. word-finally) that resulted from vowel losses.\n\nThe following table describes a typical minimal reconstruction of Late Proto-Tocharian, which includes all vowels that are generally accepted by Tocharian scholars:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! &nbsp;\n!

However, Ringe reconstructs three vowels ''*\u00eb, *e, *\u1eb9'' in place of the single vowel ''*e'' in the minimal system.  The primary distinction is between ''*\u00eb'' < PIE ''*o'', which is assumed to be a central rather than a front vowel because it does not trigger palatalization, and ''*e'' < PIE ''*\u0113'', which does trigger palatalization.  Other than palatalization effects, both vowels are reflected identically in both Tocharian A and B, and hence a number of researchers project the merger back to Proto-Tocharian.  However, some umlaut processes are thought to have operated differently on the two vowels, and as a result Ringe (as well as Adams<ref>Douglas Adams, \"Ablaut and Umlaut in the Tocharian Vowel System\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 98, No. 4 (Oct. \u2013 Dec., 1978), pp. 446- 450.</ref> and some other scholars) prefer to distinguish the two in Proto-Tocharian.  Ringe's ''*\u1eb9'' vowel, a higher vowel than ''*e'', is fairly rare and appears as ''i'' in Tocharian B but ''e'' in Tocharian A.  This vowel does trigger palatalization, and is thought by Ringe to stem primarily from PIE ''*oy'' and from loanwords.  In general, Ringe's Proto-Tocharian reconstruction reflects an earlier stage than the one described by many researchers.\n\nSome scholars use a different notation from what is given above: e.g. ''\u00e6'' or ''\u00eb'' in place of the ''e'' of the minimal system, ''\u00e5'' or ''\u0254'' in place of the ''o'' of the minimal system, and ''\u01dd'' in place of ''\u00e4''.\n\nThe following table shows the changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Proto-Tocharian (PToch) and on to Tocharian B (TB) and Tocharian A (TA), using the notation of the \"minimal\" system above:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

When following a consonant, that consonant is palatalized; otherwise, a ''y'' appears.  Before PIE ''i'', consonants other than dentals are not necessarily palatalized (researchers differ on what exactly happened); this is indicated as (+).\n#A \u2014 sign indicates no vowel; this results from deletion of ''\u00e4'' in open syllables.\n#Tocharian B reflects Proto-Tocharian central vowels (''\u00e4'', ''\u0101'') differently depending on whether they bore stress or not.  This is indicated in the table above: stressed ''\u00e4 \u0101'' > ''a \u0101'' while unstressed ''\u00e4 \u0101'' > ''\u00e4 a'' (i.e. Tocharian B ''a'' reflects either stressed ''\u00e4'' or unstressed ''\u0101'').  An additional complication is that unstressed ''\u00e4'' is deleted in open syllables.  See below.\n\nProto-Tocharian had phonemic stress, although its position varies depending on the researcher. Many researchers project the Tocharian B stress that is recoverable from ''\u0101''~''a'' and ''a''~''\u00e4'' alternations back to Proto-Tocharian. For the most part, this stress does not reflect PIE stress.  Rather, most bisyllabic words have initial stress, and trisyllabic and longer words usually have stress on the second syllable.  A number of multisyllabic words in Tocharian B appear to indicate that more than one syllable was stressed; it is thought that these reflect clitics or affixes that still behaved phonologically as separate words in Proto-Tocharian.  Ringe,<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/> however, prefers to project the PIE stress unchanged into Proto-Tocharian, and assumes that the radically different system seen in Tocharian B evolved within the separate history of that language.\n\nThe outcome of the PIE sequences ''*iH'' and ''*uH'' when not followed by a vowel is disputed.  It is generally agreed that ''*ih\u2082'' became Proto-Tocharian ''*y\u0101''; a similar change occurred in [[Ancient Greek]].  It is also usually accepted that ''*ih\u2083'' likewise became Proto-Tocharian ''*y\u0101'', although it is unclear whether this reflects a direct change ''*ih\u2083 > *y\u0101 /ya/'' or a change ''*ih\u2083 > *y\u014d /yo:/ > *y\u0101 /ya/'' (echoing a similar change in Ancient Greek), since PIE ''*\u014d'' is generally thought to have become Proto-Tocharian ''*\u0101'' (which was not a long vowel).  The outcomes of all other sequences are much less clear.  A number of etymologies appear to indicate a parallel change ''*uh\u2082 > *w\u0101'', but some also appear to indicate a change ''*uh\u2082 > *\u016b > *u''. Ringe<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/> demonstrates that all the occurrences of ''*w\u0101'' can potentially be explained as due to analogy, and prefers to postulate a general sound change ''*uH > *\u016b > *u'' following the normal outcome of ''*uH'' in other languages, but a number of other researchers (e.g. Krause and Slocum<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>) prefer to see ''*uh\u2082 > *w\u0101'' as the regular sound change.  The outcome of ''*ih\u2081'' is likewise disputed, with Ringe similarly preferring a regular change ''*ih\u2081 > *\u012b > i'' while others postulate a regular change ''*ih\u2081 > *ye > *y\u00e4''. As elsewhere, the main difficulty is that, relative to other Indo-European languages, Tocharian is sparsely attested and was subject to a particularly large number of analogical changes.\n\nA number of umlaut processes occurred in the Proto-Tocharian period, which tended to increase the number of rounded vowels.  Vowel rounding also resulted from the influence of nearby labiovelars, although this occurred after the Proto-Tocharian period, with differing results in Tocharian A and B, generally with more rounding in Tocharian A (e.g. PIE ''*g\u02b7\u1e43-'' \"come\" > PToch ''*k\u02b7\u00e4m-'' > Tocharian A ''kum-'' but Tocharian B ''k\u00e4m-'').\n\n===Vowel deletion and insertion===\nTocharian A deletes all Proto-Tocharian final vowels, as well as all instances of Proto-Tocharian ''\u00e4'' in [[open syllable]]s (which appears to include vowels followed by ''Cr'' and ''Cl'' sequences).  When this produces impossible consonant sequences, these are rectified by vocalizing ''w'' and ''y'' into ''u'' and ''i'', if possible; otherwise, an epenthetic ''\u00e4'' is inserted.  Note that most consonant sequences are tolerated word-initially, including unexpected cases like ''rt-'', ''ys-'' and ''lks-''.  Example: PIE ''h\u2081rudhros'' (Greek ''erythros'') > PToch ''r\u00e4\u0301tre'' > Toch A *''rtr'' > ''rt\u00e4r''.\n\nTocharian B deletes only unstressed ''\u00e4'' in open syllables, and leaves all other vowels alone.  Hence PIE ''h\u2081rudhros'' > PToch ''r\u00e4\u0301tre'' > Toch B ''ratre''.  If necessary, impossible consonant sequences are rectified as in Tocharian A.\n\n===Consonants===\nThe following are the main changes between PIE and Proto-Tocharian:\n*[[Centum]] change: PIE \"palatals\" merge with PIE \"plain velars\".\n*Loss of PIE ''d'' (but not other dentals) in a number of words when not followed by a PIE front vocalic.\n*Loss of contrastive voicing and aspiration, resulting in (e.g.) the merger of PIE ''k, g, gh''.\n*Palatalization of all consonants before PIE ''e, \u0113, y'' and sometimes ''i'', producing a number of new phonemes (''c'', ''\u015b'', ''\u1e63'', ''ts'', ''\u00f1'', ''ly'').\n*Loss of final consonants other than ''r'', including total loss of certain final clusters (e.g. ''nts'').\n\nThe extant Tocharian languages appear to reflect essentially the same consonant system as in Proto-Tocharian, except in a couple of cases:\n*A new phoneme ''\u1e45'' {{IPA|/\u014b/}} eventually developed.  This was originally an allophone of ''n'' before ''k'', but became phonemic when vowel losses resulted in instances of ''nk'' and ''\u00f1k'' contrasting with ''\u1e45k'', and occasional loss of ''k'' between consonants resulted in instances of ''\u1e45'' not before ''k''.\n*The Proto-Tocharian labiovelar ''*k\u02b7'' eventually merged with ''k'' in both Tocharian A and B.  However, this clearly post-dated Proto-Tocharian, because the former ''*k\u02b7'' often rounded adjacent vowels prior to its loss, in a way that differed between A and B (e.g. Proto-Tocharian ''*k\u02b7\u00e4m-'' \"come\" > A ''kum-'' but B ''k\u00e4m-''). In addition, according to Ringe,<ref name=\"ringe-adams\">Donald A. Ringe Jr, \"Review of 'Tocharian Historical Phonology and Morphology' by Douglas Q. Adams\", ''Language'', Vol. 66, No. 2 (Jun., 1990), pp. 400\u2013408.</ref> Proto-Tocharian ''*k\u02b7'' is sometimes retained in Tocharian B when directly preceding a voiceless consonant, particularly in western dialect texts.\n\nUnlike in most ''[[centum]]'' languages, Proto-Tocharian maintained separate outcomes of PIE ''*k\u02b7'' and ''*\u1e31w''.<ref name=\"ringe-adams\"/> The latter is still reflected as ''kw'' in Tocharian B, e.g. ''yakwe'' \"horse\" < PIE ''*e\u1e31wos''.\n\n===Palatalization===\n[[Palatalization (sound change)|Palatalization]] was a very important process operating in Proto-Tocharian.  Palatalization appears to have operated very early, prior to almost all of the vowel changes that took place between PIE and Proto-Tocharian. Palatalization occurred before PIE ''e'', ''\u0113'', ''y'' and sometimes ''i''; specifically, PIE ''i'' triggered palatalization of dentals but generally not of velars or labials. (According to Ringe,<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/> lack of palatalization before PIE ''i'' was actually due to early change of ''i'' > ''w\u01dd'' after certain sounds.) Palatalization, or lack thereof, is the only way to distinguish PIE ''e'' and ''i'' in Tocharian, and the primary way of distinguishing certain other pairs of PIE vowels, e.g. ''e'' vs. ''u'' and ''\u0113'' vs. ''o''. Palatalization appeared to have operated in two stages, an earlier one that affected only the sequences ''ty'' and ''dhy'', and a later more general one \u2014 or at least, the result of palatalization of ''t'' and ''dh'' before ''y'' is different from palatalization before ''e, \u0113'' and ''i'', while other consonants do not show such a dual outcome. (A similar situation occurred in the history of [[Proto-Greek]] and [[Proto-Romance]].) Certain sound changes occurred prior to palatalization:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n#Some changes involving PIE dentals; see below.\n#The development of PIE ''iH'' into ''y'' + vowel.

Palatalization sometimes produces ''c'', sometimes ''ts'', sometimes ''\u015b'', and in some words when a front vocalic does not follow, PIE ''*d'' (but not other dentals) is lost entirely, e.g. e.g. Toch AB ''or'' \"wood\" < PIE ''*doru'' and Toch B ''ime'' \"thought\" < PToch ''*w'\u00e4im\u00eb'' < PIE ''*weid-mo-''.  Many occurrences of ''c'' and ''ts'' can be explained by the differing effects of a following ''y'' vs. a front vowel (see above), but a number of difficult cases remain.\n\nMost researchers agree that some of the PIE dentals are reflected differently from others \u2014 contrary to the situation with all other PIE stops.  This in turn suggests that some sound changes must have operated on particular dentals, but not others, prior to the general loss of contrastive voicing and aspiration.  There is a large amount of disagreement over what exactly the relevant sound changes were, due to the relatively small number of extant forms involved, the operation of analogy, and disagreement over particular etymologies, including both the PIE roots and ablaut forms involved.  Ringe suggests the following changes, in approximate order:<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/>\n#[[Grassmann's Law]], which triggers the change ''dh > d'' when another aspirated consonant occurs later in a word (and which also operated in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]).\n#The change ''d'' > ''dz'', which occurred after Grassmann's Law if it existed.\n#Loss of contrastive voicing and aspiration (which may have occurred after palatalization).\n#Palatalization.  The new sound ''ts'' palatalizes to ''\u015b''; this explains cases like Toch B ''\u015bak'', Toch A ''\u015b\u00e4k'' \"ten\" < PIE ''*dek\u1e43(t)''.\n#Loss of ''ts'' before consonants.\n\nEven with this explanation, a lot of words don't have the expected outcomes and require appeal to analogy.  For example, the assumption of Grassmann's Law helps to explain only two words, both verbs, in which PIE ''*dh'' shows up as ''ts''; and in both of these words, palatalization to ''\u015b'' might have been expected, because the present-tense forms both begin with PIE ''*dhe-''. Ringe needs to appeal to an analogical depalatalization, based on other forms of the verb with different ablaut patterns in which palatalization was not triggered. This assumption is reasonable, because a lot of other verbs also show analogical depalatalization; but nonetheless, it is rather slender evidence, and it is not surprising that other researchers have proposed different assumptions (e.g. that PToch ''*ts\u00e4-'' is the expected outcome of PIE ''*dhe-'', with no operation of Grassmann's Law).\n\nLikewise, the loss of PIE ''*d'' in Toch AB ''or'' \"wood\" < PIE ''*doru'' is not explainable by these rules, because it is lost before a vowel rather than a consonant.  Ringe again assumes analogy: In this case, the PIE conjugation was nominative ''*doru'', genitive ''*dreus'', and Ringe assumes that the normal loss of ''*d'' in the genitive before ''*r'' was carried over into the nominative. Again, not all researchers accept this. For example, Krause and Slocum, while accepting the remainder of Ringe's sound changes involving PIE ''*d'', suggest instead that loss eventually occurred before Proto-Tocharian rounded vowels and before Proto-Tocharian ''\u00eb'' (from PIE ''o''), as well as before nasals and possibly other consonants.<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n==Morphology==\n\n===Nouns===\nTocharian has completely re-worked the [[declension|nominal declension]] system of Proto-Indo-European.{{sfnp|Beekes|1995|p=92}} The only cases inherited from the proto-language are nominative, genitive, [[accusative case|accusative]], and (in Tocharian B only) vocative; in Tocharian the old accusative is known as the ''oblique'' case. In addition to these primary cases, however, each Tocharian language has six cases formed by the addition of an invariant suffix to the oblique case \u2014 although the set of six cases is not the same in each language, and the suffixes are largely non-cognate.

An example is ''{{IAST|e\u1e45kwe}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|o\u1e45k}}'' (Toch A) \"man\", which belongs to the same declension as above, but has oblique singular ''{{IAST|e\u1e45kwe\u1e43}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|o\u1e45ka\u1e43}}'' (Toch A), and corresponding oblique stems ''{{IAST|e\u1e45kwe\u1e43-}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|o\u1e45kn-}}'' (Toch A) for the secondary cases.  This is thought to stem from the generalization of ''n''-stem adjectives as an indication of determinative semantics, seen most prominently in the weak adjective declension in the [[Germanic languages]] (where it cooccurs with definite articles and determiners), but also in Latin and Greek ''n''-stem nouns (especially proper names) formed from adjectives, e.g. Latin ''Cat\u014d'' (genitive ''Cat\u014dnis'') literally \"the sly one\" {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} < ''catus'' \"sly\", Greek ''Pl\u00e1t\u014dn'' literally \"the broad-shouldered one\" < ''plat\u00fas'' \"broad\".<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n===Verbs===\nIn contrast, the verb [[grammatical conjugation|verbal conjugation]] system is quite conservative.{{sfnp|Beekes|1995|p=20}} The majority of Proto-Indo-European verbal classes and categories are represented in some manner in Tocharian, although not necessarily with the same function.<ref>Douglas Q. Adams, \"On the Development of the Tocharian Verbal System\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 98, No. 3 (Jul. \u2013 Sep., 1978), pp. 277- 288.</ref> Some examples: athematic and thematic present tenses, including null-, ''-y-'', ''-s\u1e31-'', ''-s-'', ''-n-'' and ''-nH-'' suffixes as well as ''n''-infixes and various laryngeal-ending stems; ''o''-grade and possibly lengthened-grade perfects (although lacking reduplication or augment); sigmatic, reduplicated, thematic and possibly lengthened-grade aorists; optatives; imperatives; and possibly PIE subjunctives.\n\nIn addition, most PIE sets of endings are found in some form in Tocharian (although with significant innovations), including thematic and athematic endings, primary (non-past) and secondary (past) endings, active and mediopassive endings, and perfect endings.  Dual endings are still found, although they are rarely attested and generally restricted to the third person. The mediopassive still reflects the distinction between primary ''-r'' and secondary ''-i'', effaced in most Indo-European languages.  Both root and suffix ablaut is still well-represented, although again with significant innovations.\n\n====Categories====\nTocharian verbs are conjugated in the following categories:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n*Mood: indicative, subjunctive, optative, imperative.\n*Tense/aspect (in the indicative only): present, preterite, imperfect.\n*Voice: active, mediopassive, deponent.\n*Person: 1st, 2nd, 3rd.\n*Number: singular, dual, plural.\n*Causation: basic, causative.\n*Non-finite: active participle, mediopassive participle, present gerundive, subjunctive gerundive.\n\n====Classes====\nA given verb belongs to one of a large number of classes, according to its conjugation.  As in [[Sanskrit]], [[Ancient Greek]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Latin]], there are independent sets of classes in the indicative present, subjunctive, perfect, imperative, and to a limited extent optative and imperfect, and there is no general correspondence among the different sets of classes, meaning that each verb must be specified using a number of [[principal parts]].\n\n=====Present indicative=====\nThe most complex system is the present indicative, consisting of 12 classes, 8 thematic and 4 athematic, with distinct sets of thematic and athematic endings.  The following classes occur in Tocharian B (some are missing in Tocharian A):\n*I: Athematic without suffix < PIE root athematic.\n*II: Thematic without suffix < PIE root thematic.\n*III: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-\u00eb-''. Mediopassive only.  Apparently reflecting consistent PIE ''o'' theme rather than the normal alternating ''o/e'' theme.\n*IV: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-\u0254-''. Mediopassive only.  Same PIE origin as previous class, but diverging within Proto-Tocharian.\n*V: Athematic with PToch suffix ''*-\u0101-'', likely from either PIE verbs ending in a syllabic laryngeal or PIE derived verbs in ''*-eh\u2082-'' (but extended to other verbs).\n*VI: Athematic with PToch suffix ''*-n\u0101-'', from PIE verbs in ''*-nH-''.\n*VII: Athematic with infixed nasal, from PIE infixed nasal verbs.\n*VIII: Thematic with suffix ''-s-'', possibly from PIE ''-s\u1e31-''?\n*IX: Thematic with suffix ''-sk-'' < PIE ''-s\u1e31-''.\n*X: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-n\u00e4sk/n\u0101sk-'' (evidently a combination of classes VI and IX).\n*XI: Thematic in PToch suffix ''*-s\u00e4sk-'' (evidently a combination of classes VIII and IX).\n*XII: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-(\u00e4)\u00f1\u00f1-'' < either PIE ''*-n-y-'' (denominative to n-stem nouns) or PIE ''*-nH-y-'' (deverbative from PIE ''*-nH-'' verbs).\n\nPalatalization of the final root consonant occurs in the 2nd singular, 3rd singular, 3rd dual and 2nd plural in thematic classes II and VIII-XII as a result of the original PIE thematic vowel ''e''.\n\n=====Subjunctive=====\nThe subjunctive likewise has 12 classes, denoted i through xii.  Most are conjugated identically to the corresponding indicative classes; indicative and subjunctive are distinguished by the fact that a verb in a given indicative class will usually belong to a different subjunctive class.\n\nIn addition, four subjunctive classes differ from the corresponding indicative classes, two \"special subjunctive\" classes with differing suffixes and two \"varying subjunctive\" classes with root ablaut reflecting the PIE perfect.\n\nSpecial subjunctives:\n*iv: Thematic with suffix ''i'' < PIE ''-y-'', with consistent palatalization of final root consonant.  Tocharian B only, rare.\n*vii: Thematic (''not'' athematic, as in indicative class VII) with suffix ''\u00f1'' < PIE ''-n-'' (palatalized by thematic ''e'', with palatalized variant generalized).\n\nVarying subjunctives:\n*i: Athematic without suffix, with root ablaut reflecting PIE ''o''-grade in active singular, zero-grade elsewhere.  Derived from PIE perfect.\n*v: Identical to class i but with PToch suffix ''*-\u0101-'', originally reflecting laryngeal-final roots but generalized.\n\n=====Preterite=====\nThe preterite has 6 classes:\n*I: The most common class, with a suffix ''\u0101'' < PIE ''\u1e24'' (i.e. roots ending in a laryngeal, although widely extended to other roots).  This class shows root ablaut, with original ''e''-grade (and palatalization of the initial root consonant) in the active singular, contrasting with zero-grade (and no palatalization) elsewhere.\n*II: This class has reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly reflecting the PIE reduplicated aorist).  However, Tocharian B has a vowel reflecting long PIE ''\u0113'', along with palatalization of the initial root consonant.  There is no ablaut in this class.\n*III: This class has a suffix ''s'' in the 3rd singular active and throughout the mediopassive, evidently reflecting the PIE sigmatic aorist.  Root ablaut occurs between active and mediopassive.  A few verbs have palatalization in the active along with ''s'' in the 3rd singular, but no palatalization and no ''s'' in the mediopassive, along with no root ablaut (the vowel reflects PToch ''\u00eb'').  This suggests that, for these verbs in particular, the active originates in the PIE sigmatic aorist (with ''s'' suffix and ''\u0113'' vocalism) while the mediopassive stems from the PIE perfect (with ''o'' vocalism).\n*IV: This class has suffix ''\u1e63\u1e63\u0101'', with no ablaut.  Most verbs in this class are causatives.\n*V: This class has suffix ''\u00f1(\u00f1)\u0101'', with no ablaut.  Only a few verbs belong to this class.\n*VI: This class, which has only two verbs, is derived from the PIE thematic aorist.  As in Greek, this class has different endings from all the others, which partly reflect the PIE secondary endings (as expected for the thematic aorist).\n\nAll except preterite class VI have a common set of endings that stem from the PIE perfect endings, although with significant innovations.\n\n=====Imperative=====\nThe imperative likewise shows 6 classes, with a unique set of endings, found only in the second person, and a prefix beginning with ''p-''.  This prefix usually reflects Proto-Tocharian ''*p\u00e4-'' but unexpected connecting vowels occasionally occur, and the prefix combines with vowel-initial and glide-initial roots in unexpected ways.  The prefix is often compared with the Slavic perfective prefix ''po-'', although the phonology is difficult to explain.\n\nClasses i through v tend to co-occur with preterite classes I through V, although there are many exceptions.  Class vi is not so much a coherent class as an \"irregular\" class with all verbs not fitting in other categories.  The imperative classes tend to share the same suffix as the corresponding preterite (if any), but to have root vocalism that matches the vocalism of a verb's subjunctive.  This includes the root ablaut of subjunctive classes i and v, which tend to co-occur with imperative class i.\n\n=====Optative and imperfect=====\nThe optative and imperfect have related formations. The optative is generally built by adding ''i'' onto the subjunctive stem.  Tocharian B likewise forms the imperfect by adding ''i'' onto the present indicative stem, while Tocharian A has 4 separate imperfect formations: usually ''\u0101'' is added to the subjunctive stem, but occasionally to the indicative stem, and sometimes either ''\u0101'' or ''s'' is added directly onto the root.  The endings differ between the two languages: Tocharian A uses present endings for the optative and preterite endings for the imperfect, while Tocharian B uses the same endings for both, which are a combination of preterite and unique endings (the latter used in the singular active).\n\n====Endings====\nAs suggested by the above discussion, there are a large number of sets of endings.  The present-tense endings come in both thematic and athematic variants, although they are related, with the thematic endings generally reflecting a theme vowel (PIE ''e'' or ''o'') plus the athematic endings.  There are different sets for the preterite classes I through V; preterite class VI; the imperative; and in Tocharian B, in the singular active of the optative and imperfect.  Furthermore, each set of endings comes with both active and mediopassive forms.  The mediopassive forms are quite conservative, directly reflecting the PIE variation between ''-r'' in the present and ''-i'' in the past. (Most other languages with the mediopassive have generalized one of the two.)\n\nThe present-tense endings are almost completely divergent between Tocharian A and B.  The following shows the thematic endings, with their origin:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+Thematic present active indicative endings\n! rowspan=2| !! rowspan=2|Original PIE !! colspan=2|Tocharian B !! colspan=2|Tocharian A !! rowspan=2|Notes\n|-\n!

He preached in the tenth and eleventh centuries [[Islamic calendar|AH]] (sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries AD). His adherents call themselves Qadri Naushahi, Naushahi or just Qadri (Qadiri).\n\n== Birth and names ==\n\nSyed Muhammad Naushah Ganj Bakhsh Qadri was born on the first day of Ramadan in 959 AH (21 August 1552) at Ghogganwali, district Gujrat in Punjab, Pakistan. The name of his father was Ala\u2019uddin, who was respected for being a great Sufi of his own times. Despite all difficulties of undertaking a long journey in his days he had completed his pilgrimage to Mecca Mukarramah and Madinah Munawwarah seven times on foot, which shows how devoted to Islam he was.\n\nAt his birth he was named (Haji) Muhammad. This name was kept in accordance with some divine and supernatural messages. In the first instance he became famous by the name of Haji Muhammad. Later on he also became famous by the names of Haji Nausha, Abul Hashim, Bhoora Wala Pir (the enshrouded one), Mujaddid-i Islam (the great revival of the Islam), Naushah Ganj Bakhsh, Syed Naushah Pir and Naushah Pak. The name Naushah is also spelled and pronounced as Noshah or even Nosho.\n\nAt his birth he was named Muhammad. Later on he also adopted the names Haji Naushah (Nosh\u0101h), Abul Hashim, Hazrat Naush\u0101h Wal\u012b, Bhoora Wala Pir (the enshrouded one), Mujaddid-i Azam (the great reviver of Islam), Naushah Ganj Bakhsh, Sayyid Naushah Pir and Naushah Pak. He claimed to have received the titles \"Ganj Bakhsh\" and \"Naushah\" in the presence of God. Both names are Persian words; Ganj Bakhsh means \"bestower of hidden treasures\" and Naushah means a young king or a bridegroom. He was also known as Maq\u0101m-i Naush\u0101hat.\n\n===Forebearers===\nMuhammad Qadri was a [[Sayyid]] (direct descendant of the family of [[Muhammad]]), a 33nd{{Clarify|date=July 2015|reason=Should this be '32nd', '33rd' or something else?}}-generation scion of [[Ali Ibn Abi Talib]].It has been recorded that the first of the ancestors of Syed Naushah Ganj Bakhsh Qadri, who came to the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent, was Syed Awn ibn Ya\u2018la, well known by the name of Qutb Shah Qadri. This happened by order of Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani in the fifth century AH (about the eleventh century AD). Moreover, he was an uncle of Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani and one of his spiritual successors born in 1028 in Baghdad. He is also the first person who introduced the Qadiria Order in India. Qutb Shah Qadiri was an appointed Qutb (spiritual pole) by Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani for this Indian subcontinent. Due to his great efforts many of the Hindu tribes converted to the Islam. Among them are the tribes of Rajput, Chohan and Khokar. Most of them attained a blessed life in the religion. Qutb Shah Qadiri returned after his mission, that he did for many years, to Baghdad where he died in 1157. In this city you can also find his holy grave.\n\nThe son and the spiritual successor of Qutb Shah Qadiri was Syed Zaman Ali Muhsin. He spread the Islam in the southwest regions of the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent, Kohistan-i Namak and the surroundings of Saunsakesar. Many people converted due to him to the Islam and joined in his circle of Murids (spiritual disciples). His work for the religion even impressed the local ruler \"Rani Bharat\", who later accepted the Islam as the true religion. The holy grave of Syed Zaman Ali Shah is located in Kirana, district Sargodha in Pakistan.\n\nSyed Mahmud Shah, better known as Pir Jalib, is one of the descendants of Syed Zaman Ali Shah. He was an outstanding saint who possessed super natural gifts, called Tasarrufat. He was also called Pir Jalib, because of his numerous benefactions and his spiritual attraction. Like his forefathers he was a spiritual perfected person. His holy burial place is in Ramdiana, district Sargodha. Syed Shamsuddin Shahid was a great saint from the descendants of Pir Jalib. He always took with him his favourite weapon, a javelin. Hence he was called Sangin Shah Shahid. He became a martyr when he died during a battle in the way of Allah. Sangin Shah had two sons: Syed Ala\u2019uddin Husain and Syed Rahimuddin. The holy graves of both the brothers are situated in Ghogganwali, near Qadirabad in the district Gujrat, Pakistan.\n\nSyed Ala\u2019uddin is reckoned among the great spiritual masters of the mystical path. He observed very accurately the Shair\u2018ah, the Islamic laws. He had the Kunyah (a nickname indicating a parental relationship) Abu Isma\u2018il with the extra appellation Pir Ghazi. Among his contemporaries, just as his younger brother, he was an exceptional saint, from whom supernatural powers have been revealed till today. Syed Ala\u2019uddin, whose holy grave is in Ghogganwali, is also the father of Syed Naushah Ganj Bakhsh Qadri <ref>http://www.qadri-naushahi.com/Resource/Nausha_Peer_RA.htm</ref>\n\n===Genealogy===\n\n{{div col | small=yes| colwidth=22em}}\n# [[Ali ibn Abu Talib]]\n# Abul Fadl Abbas\n# Abu Ali Ubaydullah\n# Abul Abbas Hasan\n# Abul Qasim Hamza\n# Jafar\n# Ali\n# Qasim\n# Muhammad al Tayar\n# Abu Yalla Hamza\n# Yalla Qasim\n# Aun Qutb Shah\n# Zaman Ali\n# Abdul Haqq\n# Jamaluddin Ishaq\n# Izzuddin Abdul Aziz\n# Jalaluddin Gohar Ali\n# Burhanuddin Hubaira\n# Saiduddin Iskander\n# Aminuddin Munawar\n# Jallaluddin Sultan\n# Kamaluddin Ahmad\n# Mahmud Shah\n# Abdul Awall Zahid\n# Ataullah\n# Abdul Samad Arif\n# Muizuddin\n# Ghulam Muhammad\n# Sahibuddin Shah\n# Abdullah Zakir e Hu\n# Jalaluddin Muhammad\n# Shamsuddin Ahmad\n# Alauddin Husayn\n# '''Muhammad Qadiri'''\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Ministry and teaching==\nSyed Naushah Ganj Bakhsh Qadri was a saint of Allah by birth. He was highly gifted with the qualities of intelligence and memory. The books of religious history of his times tell us that he memorised the holy Qur'an within a short period of three months only. Among his teachers in this world were Qari Qaimuddin and Shaikh Abdul Haqq.\n\nHe was widely respected and honoured for his knowledge of Tasawwuf (Islamic mysticism), because his inner experience helped him to demonstrate his superiority in his field. Actually the knowledge infinitive mysticism came to him from Allah directly (Ilm-i Ladunni). Mirza Ahmed Beg Lahori records that one night two angels came and placed their fingers into the mouth of Syed Nausha. All of a sudden he became a learned and knowledgeable man in the field of Islamic mysticism. The next morning he told his teacher about this extraordinary spiritual experience. The teacher remarked: \"There is no need for you to get further knowledge from me. Perhaps on the Day of Judgement I shall be rewarded with salvation of my soul for having given a few lessons to you before this glorious spiritual experience.\"\n\nSyed Naushah Pir was an expert in the religious field, like Fiqh (Islamic law), Hadith (the report of the practise and sayings of the Prophet), Tafsir (exegeses of the Qur'an), logics, philosophy and Kalam (theology concerning the tenets of belief). His comprehensive knowledge of the religion is evident from his sayings.\n\nBeside the important languages such as Arabic and Persian he knew Kashmiri, Sanskrit and many another regional languages as well. After having Islamic knowledge, he specialized himself in spiritual exercises.\n\n== Golden Chain ==\nAt the age of twenty-nine years Muhammad accepted Hazrat Sakhi Shah Suleman Noori Hazoori (From Bhalwal Sharif) as his spiritual guide, placing him in a [[silsila]] (spiritual order or chain of saints) that stretched back to Abdul Qadir Jilani. This spiritual lineage ends via Ali Al-Murtaza at the final and Muhammad.<ref>(Tazkerah Naushahi copied 1190 AD Punjab University Library)</ref> {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\n{{div col | small=yes| colwidth=22e}}\n# [[Muhammad]]\n# [[Ali ibn Abu Talib]]\n# [[Hasan al-Basri]]\n# [[Habib al Ajami]]\n# [[Dawud Tai]]\n# [[Maruf Karkhi]]\n# [[Sirri Saqti]]\n# [[Junaid Baghdadi]]\n# [[Abu Bakr Shibli]]\n# [[Abdul Aziz bin Hars bin Asad Yemeni Tamimi|Abdul Aziz al Tamimi]]\n# [[Abu Al Fazal Abdul Wahid Yemeni Tamimi|Abul Fadl al Tamimi]]\n# [[Mohammad Yousaf Abu al-Farah Tartusi|Abul Farah Tartusi]]\n# [[Abul Hasan Hankari]]\n# [[Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi]]\n# [[Abdul Qadir Jilani]]\n# Syed Saifuddin Abdul Wahhab\n# Syed Safiuddin Abdus Sallam\n# Syed Hameeduddin Ahmad\n# Syed Muhiyuddin Mas`ud\n# Syed Ziauddin Ali\n# Syed Jamaluddin Shah Mir\n# Syed Shamsuddin A'zam\n# Syed Amiruddin Muhammad Ghawth\n# Syed Allauddin Mubarik Haqqani\n# Shaykh Maru`f Irfan\n# Sakhi Shah Suleman Noori Hazoori\n# '''Muhammad Qadiri'''\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Personal life ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nHaji Muhammad was married to the daughter of Sayyid Abu Nasr Fateh Muhammad Shah of Qutb Naushehra. His mother, Main J\u012bwn\u012b, arranged this marriage. He had two sons and one daughter. Their names were Sayyid Muhammad Barkhurdar, Sayyid Muhammad Hashim and Sayyida Sairah Khatoon.\n\nHe was noted for his hospitality. Mirza Ahmed Beg Lahori states that he looked after his guests personally and arranged for their food himself. Allama Jam\u0101lullah says that once he and some of his pupils stayed in Sayyid Naushah's mosque. They were highly impressed when he sent food for them from his own house. It is on record that he directed his sons to look after the guests with special care, when he entrusted the work of preaching Islam to them.\n\nHe took part in many battles. It is recorded that once a renowned wrestler named Sher Ali Khan challenged Haji Muhammad to a trial of strength. Muhammad pressed Khan's hand so powerfully that blood came out of the wrestler's fingers. The wrestler fell down at his feet and begged to be forgiven.\n\nHe usually spent his time in the mosque in teaching the holy Qur'an, leading the prayers five times a day and leading additional Nafl prayers by the riverside in the night.\n\nHaji Muhammad attempted to put the [[Sunnah]] in practice as precisely as possible. He said: <blockquote>\"My way of life is the Shar\u012b'ah of the Prophet. My way of the Tar\u012bqah is the Shar\u012b'ah of the Prophet. The way of life of the Prophet implies also my way of life. To walk through the Shar\u012b'ah is like walking on an illuminated way.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}</blockquote>\n\nBy day Muhammad always wore a big woollen sheet, as prescribed by the Sunnah. This piece of cloth is named bhoora in the Punjabi language, hence he was also called Bhoorawala Pir. Today, followers of his order also wear the bhoora.\n\n== Literary works ==\nThere are many works of Sayyid Naush\u0101h Ganj Bakhsh. As time passes they are compiled and published from manuscripts. At present there are five books of poetry and prose:\n*''Kulliy\u0101t-i Naush\u0101h'': ([[Urdu]] poetry) consisting of 76 Risala's and 2400 verses.\n*''Kulliy\u0101t-i Naush\u0101h'': ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] poetry) In this work 126 Risala's of about four thousand verses are alphabetically arranged.\n*''Ma\u2018\u0101rif-i Tasawwuf'': ([[Persian language|Persian]] poetry) dealing with assignments on the spiritual path.\n*''Maw\u0101'iz-i Naush\u0101h P\u012br'': (Punjabi prose) comprises delivered speeches and advices.\n*''Ganj-ul-Asr\u0101r'' (\"the treasure of mysteries\"): a short Risala in prose ascribed to him.\n\nAccording to Professor Ahmed Qureshi the following books are also written by Sayyid Naushah Pir: ''Diwan Urdu'', ''Diwan Punjabi'' (two poems in respectively Urdu and Punjabi) and ''Mathnawi-ye Ganj'' (\"The Mathnawi of Naushah Ganj Bakhsh\").\n\n==Quotations==\n\n\"O friend, withdraw yourself from the world.\"<br />\n\"If you don't, you have once to do that.\"<br />\n\"Don't spoil your time of life.\"<br />\n\"Leave the fame of the world behind you.\"<br />\n\"O my true friend, follow your Murshid (guide).\"<br />\n\"Do this in sincere surrendering in the heart with belief.\"<br />\n\"Commemorate the Kalima, so that you will not lose it.\"<br />\n\"The sufferings of this world and the last moment [death].\"<br />\n\"You can only prevail by this!\"\n\n== Death ==\nHaji Muhammad died of natural causes on Monday, the fifteenth of the Islamic month Rab\u012b 'ul-Awwal 1064 AH, aged one hundred and five. This date corresponds to Monday the eighteenth May 1654 A.D. He was buried in the village named Naushehra in Gujrat. His body was later interred at Ranmal Sharif in [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]]. His grave is open to the public. The part of land on which his grave has been buried, belongs to the territory of Ranmal Sharif. The number of plot was formerly 220 and at the present 84/1.\n\nDue to flooding in 1757 his body was transferred from its original burial site. According to tradition, when his coffin surfaced, his body was entirely intact, even his shroud was unharmed. After being damaged again by the river Chenab his coffin was finally moved to the west of Sahanpal Sharif. In 1950 this new tomb was damaged by rain. Consequently, the supports subsided and cracks appeared in the tomb. His death anniversary ('Urs) is held at this place every year again. Urs starts on 2nd Thursday of Har (Bikrami Calendar), which falls in the last 10 days of June and usually lasts 3 days. Thursday and Friday for men and Saturday for women.\n\n== Successors==\n\nA number of his sons and disciples carried his spiritual succession. In consequence, the Q\u0101dir\u012b Naush\u0101h\u012b Order now includes many sub-branches carrying the name of his successors, such as Barkhurd\u0101r\u012b Naushah\u012b, H\u0101shim\u012b Naush\u0101h\u012b, Suchy\u0101r\u012b Naush\u0101h\u012b and Noushahi PAK REHMANI. For instance, the current head of the Naushahi Hashmi order is Shaykh Sayyid Mahroof Hussain Shah Naushahi Hashmi Qadiri, who founded the Sufi organisation [[Jamiyat Tabligh ul Islam]] in 1962 in the United Kingdom.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*http://www.qadri-naushahi.com/\n*https://archive.org/details/FAYZANENAUSHAHSecondEdition \u2013 Biographies of the spiritual masters and saints of the Q\u0101diriyah Naush\u0101hiyah Order\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20071010081846/http://www.jamiyattablighulislam.org/\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20070929071637/http://www.naushahi.co.uk/Generations/ \u2013 Up-to-date Family Tree of Muhammad Naushah Ganj Bakhsh Qadri\n\n{{Sufism}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Qadiri, Muhammad}}\n[[Category:Phalia]]\n[[Category:1552 births]]\n[[Category:1654 deaths]]\n[[Category:People of Arab descent]]\n[[Category:Mughal Empire Sufis]]\n[[Category:Qadiri order]]\n[[Category:Punjabi Sufi saints]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2011}} \n\n[[Image:Shrine Naushah Pak.jpg|thumb|The shrine of Sayyid Naushah Ganj Bakhsh at Ranmal Sharif,Tehsil Phalia (old district Gujrat) new district Mandi Bahauddin, Pakistan]]\n\n'''Syed Muhammad Nausha Ganj Bakhsh Qadiri''' (also spelled '''Qadri''', 21 August 1552 \u2013 18 May 1654), a scholar, saint and preacher of [[Islam]] in [[South Asia]] (today's [[Gujrat District|Gujrat]], [[Pakistan]]),<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20071010081846/http://www.jamiyattablighulislam.org/</ref><ref>Abu Matlub Qadiri Naushahi ''Fayzan-e Naushah'' 2018 {{ISBN|978-94-92185-80-8}}</ref> was the founder of the [[Qadiriyya#Qadri_Noshahi|Naushahia]] branch of the [[Qadiriyya]] [[Sufi order]]. He preached in the tenth and eleventh centuries [[Islamic calendar|AH]] (sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries AD). His adherents call themselves Qadri Naushahi, Naushahi or just Qadri (Qadiri).\n\n== Birth and names ==\n\nSyed Muhammad Naushah Ganj Bakhsh Qadri was born on the first day of Ramadan in 959 AH (21 August 1552) at Ghogganwali, district Gujrat in Punjab, Pakistan. The name of his father was Ala\u2019uddin, who was respected for being a great Sufi of his own times. Despite all difficulties of undertaking a long journey in his days he had completed his pilgrimage to Mecca Mukarramah and Madinah Munawwarah seven times on foot, which shows how devoted to Islam he was.\n\nAt his birth he was named (Haji) Muhammad. This name was kept in accordance with some divine and supernatural messages. In the first instance he became famous by the name of Haji Muhammad. Later on he also became famous by the names of Haji Nausha, Abul Hashim, Bhoora Wala Pir (the enshrouded one), Mujaddid-i Islam (the great revival of the Islam), Naushah Ganj Bakhsh, Syed Naushah Pir and Naushah Pak. The name Naushah is also spelled and pronounced as Noshah or even Nosho.\n\nAt his birth he was named Muhammad. Later on he also adopted the names Haji Naushah (Nosh\u0101h), Abul Hashim, Hazrat Naush\u0101h Wal\u012b, Bhoora Wala Pir (the enshrouded one), Mujaddid-i Azam (the great reviver of Islam), Naushah Ganj Bakhsh, Sayyid Naushah Pir and Naushah Pak. He claimed to have received the titles \"Ganj Bakhsh\" and \"Naushah\" in the presence of God. Both names are Persian words; Ganj Bakhsh means \"bestower of hidden treasures\" and Naushah means a young king or a bridegroom. He was also known as Maq\u0101m-i Naush\u0101hat.\n\n===Forebearers===\nMuhammad Qadri was a [[Sayyid]] (direct descendant of the family of [[Muhammad]]), a 33nd{{Clarify|date=July 2015|reason=Should this be '32nd', '33rd' or something else?}}-generation scion of [[Ali Ibn Abi Talib]].It has been recorded that the first of the ancestors of Syed Naushah Ganj Bakhsh Qadri, who came to the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent, was Syed Awn ibn Ya\u2018la, well known by the name of Qutb Shah Qadri. This happened by order of Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani in the fifth century AH (about the eleventh century AD). Moreover, he was an uncle of Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani and one of his spiritual successors born in 1028 in Baghdad. He is also the first person who introduced the Qadiria Order in India. Qutb Shah Qadiri was an appointed Qutb (spiritual pole) by Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani for this Indian subcontinent. Due to his great efforts many of the Hindu tribes converted to the Islam. Among them are the tribes of Rajput, Chohan and Khokar. Most of them attained a blessed life in the religion. Qutb Shah Qadiri returned after his mission, that he did for many years, to Baghdad where he died in 1157. In this city you can also find his holy grave.\n\nThe son and the spiritual successor of Qutb Shah Qadiri was Syed Zaman Ali Muhsin. He spread the Islam in the southwest regions of the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent, Kohistan-i Namak and the surroundings of Saunsakesar. Many people converted due to him to the Islam and joined in his circle of Murids (spiritual disciples). His work for the religion even impressed the local ruler \"Rani Bharat\", who later accepted the Islam as the true religion. The holy grave of Syed Zaman Ali Shah is located in Kirana, district Sargodha in Pakistan.\n\nSyed Mahmud Shah, better known as Pir Jalib, is one of the descendants of Syed Zaman Ali Shah. He was an outstanding saint who possessed super natural gifts, called Tasarrufat. He was also called Pir Jalib, because of his numerous benefactions and his spiritual attraction. Like his forefathers he was a spiritual perfected person. His holy burial place is in Ramdiana, district Sargodha. Syed Shamsuddin Shahid was a great saint from the descendants of Pir Jalib. He always took with him his favourite weapon, a javelin. Hence he was called Sangin Shah Shahid. He became a martyr when he died during a battle in the way of Allah. Sangin Shah had two sons: Syed Ala\u2019uddin Husain and Syed Rahimuddin. The holy graves of both the brothers are situated in Ghogganwali, near Qadirabad in the district Gujrat, Pakistan.\n\nSyed Ala\u2019uddin is reckoned among the great spiritual masters of the mystical path. He observed very accurately the Shair\u2018ah, the Islamic laws. He had the Kunyah (a nickname indicating a parental relationship) Abu Isma\u2018il with the extra appellation Pir Ghazi. Among his contemporaries, just as his younger brother, he was an exceptional saint, from whom supernatural powers have been revealed till today. Syed Ala\u2019uddin, whose holy grave is in Ghogganwali, is also the father of Syed Naushah Ganj Bakhsh Qadri <ref>http://www.qadri-naushahi.com/Resource/Nausha_Peer_RA.htm</ref>\n\n===Genealogy===\n\n{{div col | small=yes| colwidth=22em}}\n# [[Ali ibn Abu Talib]]\n# Abul Fadl Abbas\n# Abu Ali Ubaydullah\n# Abul Abbas Hasan\n# Abul Qasim Hamza\n# Jafar\n# Ali\n# Qasim\n# Muhammad al Tayar\n# Abu Yalla Hamza\n# Yalla Qasim\n# Aun Qutb Shah\n# Zaman Ali\n# Abdul Haqq\n# Jamaluddin Ishaq\n# Izzuddin Abdul Aziz\n# Jalaluddin Gohar Ali\n# Burhanuddin Hubaira\n# Saiduddin Iskander\n# Aminuddin Munawar\n# Jallaluddin Sultan\n# Kamaluddin Ahmad\n# Mahmud Shah\n# Abdul Awall Zahid\n# Ataullah\n# Abdul Samad Arif\n# Muizuddin\n# Ghulam Muhammad\n# Sahibuddin Shah\n# Abdullah Zakir e Hu\n# Jalaluddin Muhammad\n# Shamsuddin Ahmad\n# Alauddin Husayn\n# '''Muhammad Qadiri'''\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Ministry and teaching==\nSyed Naushah Ganj Bakhsh Qadri was a saint of Allah by birth. He was highly gifted with the qualities of intelligence and memory. The books of religious history of his times tell us that he memorised the holy Qur'an within a short period of three months only. Among his teachers in this world were Qari Qaimuddin and Shaikh Abdul Haqq.\n\nHe was widely respected and honoured for his knowledge of Tasawwuf (Islamic mysticism), because his inner experience helped him to demonstrate his superiority in his field. Actually the knowledge infinitive mysticism came to him from Allah directly (Ilm-i Ladunni). Mirza Ahmed Beg Lahori records that one night two angels came and placed their fingers into the mouth of Syed Nausha. All of a sudden he became a learned and knowledgeable man in the field of Islamic mysticism. The next morning he told his teacher about this extraordinary spiritual experience. The teacher remarked: \"There is no need for you to get further knowledge from me. Perhaps on the Day of Judgement I shall be rewarded with salvation of my soul for having given a few lessons to you before this glorious spiritual experience.\"\n\nSyed Naushah Pir was an expert in the religious field, like Fiqh (Islamic law), Hadith (the report of the practise and sayings of the Prophet), Tafsir (exegeses of the Qur'an), logics, philosophy and Kalam (theology concerning the tenets of belief). His comprehensive knowledge of the religion is evident from his sayings.\n\nBeside the important languages such as Arabic and Persian he knew Kashmiri, Sanskrit and many another regional languages as well. After having Islamic knowledge, he specialized himself in spiritual exercises.\n\n== Golden Chain ==\nAt the age of twenty-nine years Muhammad accepted Hazrat Sakhi Shah Suleman Noori Hazoori (From Bhalwal Sharif) as his spiritual guide, placing him in a [[silsila]] (spiritual order or chain of saints) that stretched back to Abdul Qadir Jilani. This spiritual lineage ends via Ali Al-Murtaza at the final and Muhammad.<ref>(Tazkerah Naushahi copied 1190 AD Punjab University Library)</ref> {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\n{{div col | small=yes| colwidth=22em}}\n# [[Muhammad]]\n# [[Ali ibn Abu Talib]]\n# [[Hasan al-Basri]]\n# [[Habib al Ajami]]\n# [[Dawud Tai]]\n# [[Maruf Karkhi]]\n# [[Sirri Saqti]]\n# [[Junaid Baghdadi]]\n# [[Abu Bakr Shibli]]\n# [[Abdul Aziz bin Hars bin Asad Yemeni Tamimi|Abdul Aziz al Tamimi]]\n# [[Abu Al Fazal Abdul Wahid Yemeni Tamimi|Abul Fadl al Tamimi]]\n# [[Mohammad Yousaf Abu al-Farah Tartusi|Abul Farah Tartusi]]\n# [[Abul Hasan Hankari]]\n# [[Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi]]\n# [[Abdul Qadir Jilani]]\n# Syed Saifuddin Abdul Wahhab\n# Syed Safiuddin Abdus Sallam\n# Syed Hameeduddin Ahmad\n# Syed Muhiyuddin Mas`ud\n# Syed Ziauddin Ali\n# Syed Jamaluddin Shah Mir\n# Syed Shamsuddin A'zam\n# Syed Amiruddin Muhammad Ghawth\n# Syed Allauddin Mubarik Haqqani\n# Shaykh Maru`f Irfan\n# Shaykh Sulaiman Nuri\n# '''Muhammad Qadiri'''\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Personal life ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nHaji Muhammad was married to the daughter of Sayyid Abu Nasr Fateh Muhammad Shah of Qutb Naushehra. His mother, Main J\u012bwn\u012b, arranged this marriage. He had two sons and one daughter. Their names were Sayyid Muhammad Barkhurdar, Sayyid Muhammad Hashim and Sayyida Sairah Khatoon.\n\nHe was noted for his hospitality. Mirza Ahmed Beg Lahori states that he looked after his guests personally and arranged for their food himself. Allama Jam\u0101lullah says that once he and some of his pupils stayed in Sayyid Naushah's mosque. They were highly impressed when he sent food for them from his own house. It is on record that he directed his sons to look after the guests with special care, when he entrusted the work of preaching Islam to them.\n\nHe took part in many battles. It is recorded that once a renowned wrestler named Sher Ali Khan challenged Haji Muhammad to a trial of strength. Muhammad pressed Khan's hand so powerfully that blood came out of the wrestler's fingers. The wrestler fell down at his feet and begged to be forgiven.\n\nHe usually spent his time in the mosque in teaching the holy Qur'an, leading the prayers five times a day and leading additional Nafl prayers by the riverside in the night.\n\nHaji Muhammad attempted to put the [[Sunnah]] in practice as precisely as possible. He said: <blockquote>\"My way of life is the Shar\u012b'ah of the Prophet. My way of the Tar\u012bqah is the Shar\u012b'ah of the Prophet. The way of life of the Prophet implies also my way of life. To walk through the Shar\u012b'ah is like walking on an illuminated way.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}</blockquote>\n\nBy day Muhammad always wore a big woollen sheet, as prescribed by the Sunnah. This piece of cloth is named bhoora in the Punjabi language, hence he was also called Bhoorawala Pir. Today, followers of his order also wear the bhoora.\n\n== Literary works ==\nThere are many works of Sayyid Naush\u0101h Ganj Bakhsh. As time passes they are compiled and published from manuscripts. At present there are five books of poetry and prose:\n*''Kulliy\u0101t-i Naush\u0101h'': ([[Urdu]] poetry) consisting of 76 Risala's and 2400 verses.\n*''Kulliy\u0101t-i Naush\u0101h'': ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] poetry) In this work 126 Risala's of about four thousand verses are alphabetically arranged.\n*''Ma\u2018\u0101rif-i Tasawwuf'': ([[Persian language|Persian]] poetry) dealing with assignments on the spiritual path.\n*''Maw\u0101'iz-i Naush\u0101h P\u012br'': (Punjabi prose) comprises delivered speeches and advices.\n*''Ganj-ul-Asr\u0101r'' (\"the treasure of mysteries\"): a short Risala in prose ascribed to him.\n\nAccording to Professor Ahmed Qureshi the following books are also written by Sayyid Naushah Pir: ''Diwan Urdu'', ''Diwan Punjabi'' (two poems in respectively Urdu and Punjabi) and ''Mathnawi-ye Ganj'' (\"The Mathnawi of Naushah Ganj Bakhsh\").\n\n==Quotations==\n\n\"O friend, withdraw yourself from the world.\"<br />\n\"If you don't, you have once to do that.\"<br />\n\"Don't spoil your time of life.\"<br />\n\"Leave the fame of the world behind you.\"<br />\n\"O my true friend, follow your Murshid (guide).\"<br />\n\"Do this in sincere surrendering in the heart with belief.\"<br />\n\"Commemorate the Kalima, so that you will not lose it.\"<br />\n\"The sufferings of this world and the last moment [death].\"<br />\n\"You can only prevail by this!\"\n\n== Death ==\nHaji Muhammad died of natural causes on Monday, the fifteenth of the Islamic month Rab\u012b 'ul-Awwal 1064 AH, aged one hundred and five. This date corresponds to Monday the eighteenth May 1654 A.D. He was buried in the village named Naushehra in Gujrat. His body was later interred at Ranmal Sharif in [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]]. His grave is open to the public. The part of land on which his grave has been buried, belongs to the territory of Ranmal Sharif. The number of plot was formerly 220 and at the present 84/1.\n\nDue to flooding in 1757 his body was transferred from its original burial site. According to tradition, when his coffin surfaced, his body was entirely intact, even his shroud was unharmed. After being damaged again by the river Chenab his coffin was finally moved to the west of Sahanpal Sharif. In 1950 this new tomb was damaged by rain. Consequently, the supports subsided and cracks appeared in the tomb. His death anniversary ('Urs) is held at this place every year again. Urs starts on 2nd Thursday of Har (Bikrami Calendar), which falls in the last 10 days of June and usually lasts 3 days. Thursday and Friday for men and Saturday for women.\n\n== Successors==\n\nA number of his sons and disciples carried his spiritual succession. In consequence, the Q\u0101dir\u012b Naush\u0101h\u012b Order now includes many sub-branches carrying the name of his successors, such as Barkhurd\u0101r\u012b Naushah\u012b, H\u0101shim\u012b Naush\u0101h\u012b, Suchy\u0101r\u012b Naush\u0101h\u012b and Noushahi PAK REHMANI. For instance, the current head of the Naushahi Hashmi order is Shaykh Sayyid Mahroof Hussain Shah Naushahi Hashmi Qadiri, who founded the Sufi organisation [[Jamiyat Tabligh ul Islam]] in 1962 in the United Kingdom.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*http://www.qadri-naushahi.com/\n*https://archive.org/details/FAYZANENAUSHAHSecondEdition \u2013 Biographies of the spiritual masters and saints of the Q\u0101diriyah Naush\u0101hiyah Order\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20071010081846/http://www.jamiyattablighulislam.org/\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20070929071637/http://www.naushahi.co.uk/Generations/ \u2013 Up-to-date Family Tree of Muhammad Naushah Ganj Bakhsh Qadri\n\n{{Sufism}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Qadiri, Muhammad}}\n[[Category:Phalia]]\n[[Category:1552 births]]\n[[Category:1654 deaths]]\n[[Category:People of Arab descent]]\n[[Category:Mughal Empire Sufis]]\n[[Category:Qadiri order]]\n[[Category:Punjabi Sufi saints]]\n", "name_user": "Saadulhassan2", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Qadiri"}
