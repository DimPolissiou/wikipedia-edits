Examples include [[Solomon ben Aderet]]'s Responsa (vol. i., No. 395); the Responsa of [[Asher ben Jehiel]] (pp.&nbsp;4, 6); his ''Halakot'' (Berakot i. 12, ed.

It may correspond to a [[Greek language|Greek]] word that may have existed in the Greek dialect of the Jews in [[Syria Palaestina]], or the text is corrupted from \"Germanica\". This view of Berechiah is based on the Talmud (Yoma 10a; Jerusalem Talmud Megillah 71b), where Gomer, the father of Ashkenaz, is translated by ''Germamia'', which evidently stands for Germany, and which was suggested by the similarity of the sound.\n\nIn later times, the word Ashkenaz is used to designate southern and western Germany, the ritual of which sections differs somewhat from that of eastern Germany and Poland.

Laws were passed to integrate Jews into their host countries, forcing Ashkenazi Jews to adopt family names (they had formerly used [[patronymics]]). Newfound inclusion into public life led to cultural growth in the ''[[Haskalah]]'', or Jewish Enlightenment, with its goal of integrating modern European values into Jewish life.<ref>Breuer, 1901</ref> As a reaction to increasing antisemitism and assimilation following the emancipation, [[Zionism]] was developed in central Europe.<ref>\"Jews\", William Bridgwater, ed.

These political parties result from the fact that a portion of the Israeli electorate votes for Jewish religious parties; although the electoral map changes from one election to another, there are generally several small parties associated with the interests of religious Ashkenazi Jews. The role of religious parties, including small religious parties that play important roles as coalition members, results in turn from Israel's composition as a complex society in which competing social, economic, and religious interests stand for election to the [[Knesset]], a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature with 120 seats.<ref>{{cite web |title=Field Listing - Legislative Branch |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2101.html|work=[[World Fact Book]] |publisher=CIA |accessdate=8 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nAshkenazi Jews have played a prominent role in the economy, media, and politics<ref>{{As of|2013}}, every [[President of Israel]] since the country's foundation in 1948 has been an Ashkenazi Jew</ref> of Israel since its founding.

Different groups of religious Jews in different geographic areas historically adopted different customs and interpretations. On certain issues, Orthodox Jews are required to follow the customs of their ancestors, and do not believe they have the option of picking and choosing. For this reason, observant Jews at times find it important for religious reasons to ascertain who their household's religious ancestors are in order to know what customs their household should follow. These times include, for example, when two Jews of different ethnic background marry, when a non-Jew converts to Judaism and determines what customs to follow for the first time, or when a lapsed or less observant Jew returns to traditional Judaism and must determine what was done in his or her family's past. In this sense, \"Ashkenazic\" refers both to a family ancestry and to a body of customs binding on Jews of that ancestry. [[Reform Judaism]], which does not necessarily follow those minhagim, did nonetheless originate among Ashkenazi Jews.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/The_Origins_of_Reform_Judaism.html \"The Origins of Reform Judaism.\"] ''Jewish Virtual Library''. 27 May 2014.</ref>\n\nIn a religious sense, an Ashkenazi Jew is any Jew whose family tradition and ritual follows Ashkenazi practice. Until the Ashkenazi community first began to develop in the [[Early Middle Ages]], the centers of Jewish religious authority were in the Islamic world, at [[Baghdad]] and in [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]]. Ashkenaz (Germany) was so distant geographically that it developed a ''[[minhag]]'' of its own. Ashkenazi Hebrew came to be pronounced in ways distinct from other forms of Hebrew.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/hebpronunciation.html \"Pronunciations of Hebrew.\"] ''Jewish Virtual Library''. 27 May 2014.</ref>\n\nIn this respect, the counterpart of Ashkenazi is [[Sephardic]], since most non-Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews follow Sephardic rabbinical authorities, whether or not they are ethnically Sephardic. By tradition, a Sephardic or [[Mizrahi]] woman who marries into an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] or [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Ashkenazi Jewish family raises her children to be Ashkenazi Jews; conversely an Ashkenazi woman who marries a [[Sephardi]] or Mizrahi man is expected to take on Sephardic practice and the children inherit a Sephardic identity, though in practice many families compromise. A [[Conversion to Judaism|convert]] generally follows the practice of the [[beth din]] that converted him or her. With the integration of Jews from around the world in Israel, North America, and other places, the religious definition of an Ashkenazi Jew is blurring, especially outside [[Orthodox Judaism]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Lieberman |first=Asaf |url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/the-unbearable-lightness-of-being-ashkenazi.premium-1.494628 |title=The unbearable lightness of being Ashkenazi. |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=18 January 2013 |access-date=27 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nNew developments in Judaism often transcend differences in religious practice between Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews.

From the [[Rhineland]] to [[Riga]] to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, ''Yiddishkeit'' now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and [[Hasidism]], but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, ''Yiddishkeit'' can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.\n\nAs Ashkenazi Jews moved away from Europe, mostly in the form of [[aliyah]] to Israel, or immigration to North America, and other English-speaking areas such as [[South Africa]]; and Europe (particularly France) and [[Latin America]], the geographic isolation that gave rise to Ashkenazim has given way to mixing with other cultures, and with non-Ashkenazi Jews who, similarly, are no longer isolated in distinct geographic locales. [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] has replaced Yiddish as the primary [[Jewish language]] for many Ashkenazi Jews, although many [[Hasidic]] and [[Hareidi]] groups continue to use Yiddish in daily life. (There are numerous Ashkenazi Jewish anglophones and Russian-speakers as well, although English and Russian are not originally Jewish languages.)\n\nFrance's blended Jewish community is typical of the cultural recombination that is going on among Jews throughout the world. Although France expelled its original Jewish population in the [[Middle Ages]], by the time of the [[French Revolution]], there were two distinct Jewish populations. One consisted of Sephardic Jews, originally refugees from the [[Inquisition]] and concentrated in the southwest, while the other community was Ashkenazi, concentrated in formerly German [[Alsace]], and mainly speaking a German dialect similar to Yiddish. (A third community of Proven\u00e7al Jews living in [[Comtat Venaissin]] were technically outside France, and were later absorbed into the Sephardim.) The two communities were so separate and different that the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] emancipated them separately in 1790 and 1791.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_06791.html \"French Revolution.\"] ''Jewish Virtual Library''. 2008. 29 May 2014.</ref>\n\nBut after emancipation, a sense of a unified French Jewry emerged, especially when France was wracked by the [[Dreyfus affair]] in the 1890s. In the 1920s and 1930s, Ashkenazi Jews from Europe arrived in large numbers as refugees from [[antisemitism]], the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian revolution]], and the economic turmoil of the [[Great Depression]]. By the 1930s, [[Paris]] had a vibrant Yiddish culture, and many Jews were involved in diverse political movements. After the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] years and the [[Holocaust]], the French Jewish population was augmented once again, first by Ashkenazi refugees from Central Europe, and later by Sephardi immigrants and refugees from [[North Africa]], many of them [[francophone]].\n\nAshkenazi Jews did not record their traditions or achievements by text, instead these traditions were passed down orally from one generation to the next.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Frigyesi|first=Judit|date=September 2014|title=Scholarship on East European Jewish Music after the Holocaust|url=|journal=Hungarian Quarterly|volume=54|pages=150\u2013163|issn=1217-2545|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref> The desire to maintain pre-[[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] traditions relating to Ashkenazi culture has often been met with criticism by Jews in [[Eastern Europe]].<ref name=\":02\" /> Reasoning for this could be related to the development of a new style of Jewish arts and culture developed by the [[Jews of Palestine]] during the 1930s and 1940s, which in conjunction with the decimation of European Ashkenazi Jews and their culture by the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] regime made it easier to assimilate to the new style of ritual rather than try to repair the older traditions.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Schleifer|first=Eliyahu|date=1995|title=Current Trends of Liturgical Music in the Ashkenazi Synagogue|journal=The World of Music|volume=37|issue=1|pages=59\u201372|issn=0043-8774|jstor=43562849}}</ref> This new style of tradition was referred to as the ''Mediterranean Style'', and was noted for its simplicity and metaphorical rejuvenation of Jews abroad.<ref name=\":1\" /> This was intended to replace the [[Galut]] traditions, which were more sorrowful in practice.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThen, in the 1990s, yet another Ashkenazi Jewish wave began to arrive from countries of the former [[Soviet Union]] and Central Europe. The result is a pluralistic Jewish community that still has some distinct elements of both Ashkenazi and Sephardic culture. But in France, it is becoming much more difficult to sort out the two, and a distinctly French Jewishness has emerged.<ref>Wall, Irwin.

For roughly a thousand years, the Ashkenazim were a reproductively isolated population in Europe, despite living in many countries, with little inflow or outflow from migration, conversion, or intermarriage with other groups, including other Jews. Human geneticists have argued that genetic variations have been identified that show high frequencies among Ashkenazi Jews, but not in the general European population, be they for patrilineal markers ([[Y-chromosome]] [[haplotype]]s) and for matrilineal markers ([[mitochondrion|mitotypes]]).<ref name=WadeNYT>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/14/science/14gene.html |title=New Light on Origins of Ashkenazi in Europe |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=14 January 2006 |accessdate=24 May 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081210152054/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/14/science/14gene.html| archivedate=10 December 2008| url-status=live}}</ref> Since the middle of the 20th century, many Ashkenazi Jews have intermarried, both with members of other Jewish communities and with people of other nations and faiths.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/09/science/y-chromosome-bears-witness-to-story-of-the-jewish-diaspora.html |title=Y Chromosome Bears Witness to Story of the Jewish Diaspora |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=9 May 2000 |first=Nicholas |last=Wade}}</ref>\n\nA 2006 study found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup. Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort&nbsp;\u2013 that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease. These Haredi Jews often have extremely large families.<ref name=\"pmid17044734\">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Seldin MF, Shigeta R, Villoslada P |title=European population substructure: clustering of northern and southern populations |journal=PLOS Genet. |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=e143 |date=September 2006 |pmid=17044734 |pmc=1564423 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020143 |display-authors=etal }}</ref>\n\n==Customs, laws and traditions==\nThe ''[[Halakha|Halakhic]]'' practices of ([[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]]) Ashkenazi Jews may differ from those of [[Sephardi Jews]], particularly in matters of custom. Differences are noted in the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' itself, in the gloss of [[Moses Isserles]]. Well known differences in practice include:\n\n[[File:Prager Beerdigungsbruderschaft.jpg|thumb|The example of the ''[[chevra kadisha]]'', the Jewish burial society, Prague, 1772]]\n* Observance of ''[[Passover|Pesach]]'' (Passover): Ashkenazi Jews traditionally refrain from eating [[legumes]], grain, [[millet]], and [[rice]] ([[quinoa]], however, has become accepted as foodgrain in the North American communities), whereas Sephardi Jews typically do not prohibit these foods.\n* Ashkenazi Jews freely mix and eat fish and milk products; some Sephardic Jews refrain from doing so.\n* Ashkenazim are more permissive toward the usage of [[Wig (hair)|wigs]] as a hair covering for married and widowed women.\n* In the case of ''[[kashrut]]'' for meat, conversely, Sephardi Jews have stricter requirements&nbsp;\u2013 this level is commonly referred to as ''[[Beth Yoseph|Beth Yosef]]''. Meat products that are acceptable to Ashkenazi Jews as kosher may therefore be rejected by Sephardi Jews. Notwithstanding stricter requirements for the actual slaughter, Sephardi Jews permit the rear portions of an animal after proper [[Halakha|Halakhic]] removal of the [[sciatic nerve]], while many Ashkenazi Jews do not. This is not because of different interpretations of the law; rather, slaughterhouses could not find adequate skills for correct removal of the sciatic nerve and found it more economical to separate the hindquarters and sell them as non-kosher meat.\n* Ashkenazi Jews often name newborn children after deceased family members, but not after living relatives. Sephardi Jews, in contrast, often name their children after the children's grandparents, even if those grandparents are still living. A notable exception to this generally reliable rule is among [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]], where Ashkenazim for centuries used the naming conventions otherwise attributed exclusively to Sephardim such as [[Chuts]].\n* Ashkenazi [[tefillin]] bear some differences from Sephardic tefillin. In the traditional Ashkenazic rite, the tefillin are wound towards the body, not away from it. Ashkenazim traditionally don tefillin while standing, whereas other Jews generally do so while sitting down.\n* Ashkenazic traditional pronunciations of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] differ from those of other groups. The most prominent consonantal difference from Sephardic and Mizrahic Hebrew dialects is the pronunciation of the Hebrew letter [[Taw (letter)|tav]] in certain Hebrew words (historically, in postvocalic undoubled context) as an /s/ and not a /t/ or /\u03b8/ sound. {{further|Ashkenazi Hebrew}}\n* The prayer shawl, or [[tallit]] (or tallis in Ashkenazi Hebrew), is worn by the majority of Ashkenazi men after marriage, but western European Ashkenazi men wear it from Bar Mitzvah. In Sephardi or Mizrahi Judaism, the prayer shawl is commonly worn from early childhood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/things/tallit.htm |title=''Tallit: Jewish Prayer Shawl'' |publisher=Religionfacts.com |accessdate=2013-07-24}}</ref>\n\n===Ashkenazic liturgy===\n{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|ethnicities}}\nThe term ''Ashkenazi'' also refers to the ''[[nusach Ashkenaz]]'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \"liturgical tradition\", or rite) used by Ashkenazi [[Jew]]s in their ''[[Siddur]]'' (prayer book). A ''nusach'' is defined by a liturgical tradition's choice of prayers, the order of prayers, the text of prayers, and melodies used in the singing of prayers. Two other major forms of nusach among Ashkenazic Jews are [[Nusach Sefard]] (not to be confused with [[Sephardic law and customs|the Sephardic ritual]]), which is the general Polish Hasidic nusach, and [[Nusach Ari]], as used by Lubavitch Hasidim.\n\n===Ashkenazi as a surname===\nSeveral famous people have [[Ashkenazi (surname)|Ashkenazi as a surname]], such as [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]]. However, most people with this surname hail from within Sephardic communities, particularly from the [[Syrian Jew]]ish community. The Sephardic carriers of the surname would have some Ashkenazi ancestors since the surname was adopted by families who were initially of Ashkenazic origins who moved to Sephardi countries and joined those communities. Ashkenazi would be formally adopted as the family surname having started off as a nickname imposed by their adopted communities. Some have shortened the name to Ash.\n\n== Relations with Sephardim ==\n{{Further|Racism in Israel#Intra-Jewish racism: Racism between Jews}}\nRelations between Ashkenazim and Sephardim have at times been tense and clouded by arrogance, snobbery and claims of racial superiority with both sides claiming the inferiority of the other, based upon such features as physical traits and culture.<ref>{{cite book|author1=John M.

Currently, there are three types of genetic origin testing, autosomal DNA (atDNA), [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA), and Y-chromosomal DNA ([[Y-DNA]]). Autosomal DNA is a mixture from an individual's entire ancestry, Y-DNA shows a male's lineage only along his strict paternal line, mtDNA shows any person's lineage only along the strict maternal line. [[Genome-wide association study|Genome-wide association studies]] have also been employed to yield findings relevant to genetic origins.\n\nLike most DNA studies of human migration patterns, the earliest studies on Ashkenazi Jews focused on the Y-DNA and mtDNA segments of the human genome. Both segments are unaffected by [[recombination (biology)|recombination]] (except for the ends of the Y chromosome \u2013 the [[pseudoautosomal region]]s known as PAR1 and PAR2), thus allowing tracing of direct maternal and paternal lineages.\n\nThese studies revealed that Ashkenazi Jews originate from an ancient (2000 BCE \u2013 700 BCE) population of the Middle East who had spread to Europe.<ref name=\"tony-frudakis-book\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Photofitting: Predicting Ancestry and Phenotype Using DNA |author=Tony Nick Frudakis |page=383 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9vXeydpj7VkC&pg=PA383&dq=ashkenazi+jews+middle+eastern+origin+bronze+age#v=onepage&q=ashkenazi%20jews%20middle%20eastern%20origin%20bronze%20age |isbn=978-0080551371 |date=2010-07-19}}</ref>\nAshkenazic Jews display the homogeneity of a [[Population bottleneck|genetic bottleneck]], meaning they descend from a larger population whose numbers were greatly reduced but recovered through a few founding individuals.\nAlthough the Jewish people, in general, were present across a wide geographical area as described, genetic research done by Gil Atzmon of the Longevity Genes Project at [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] suggests \"that Ashkenazim branched off from other Jews around the time of the destruction of the First Temple, 2,500 years ago ... flourished during the Roman Empire but then went through a 'severe bottleneck' as they dispersed, reducing a population of several million to just 400 families who left Northern Italy around the year 1000 for Central and eventually Eastern Europe.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=What Do a Bunch of Old Jews Know About Living Forever? |author=Jesse Green |work=New York Magazine|date=6 November 2011|url=https://nymag.com/news/features/ashkenazi-jews-2011-11/ |accessdate=2013-07-19}}</ref>\n\nVarious studies have arrived at diverging conclusions regarding both the degree and the sources of the non-Levantine [[Miscegenation|admixture]] in Ashkenazim,<ref name=\"Summary of Recent Genetic Studies\"/> particularly with respect to the extent of the non-Levantine genetic origin observed in Ashkenazi maternal lineages, which is in contrast to the predominant Levantine genetic origin observed in Ashkenazi paternal lineages.

Consequently, their higher diversity compared to Middle Easterners stems from the latter's marriage practices, not necessarily from the former's admixture with Europeans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://anthropogenesis.kinshipstudies.org/2012/07/how-to-interpret-patterns-of-genetic-variation-admixture-divergence-inbreeding/ |title=How to Interpret Patterns of Genetic Variation?

Jewish populations have been studied more thoroughly than most other human populations, for a variety of reasons:\n* Jewish populations, and particularly the large Ashkenazi Jewish population, are ideal for such research studies, because they exhibit a high degree of [[endogamy]], yet they are sizable.<ref name=JewsasSubjects>{{cite journal|author=Carmeli, Daphna Birenbaum|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics|year=2004|title=Prevalence of Jews as subjects in genetic research: Figures, explanation, and potential implications |volume=130A|issue=1|pages=76\u201383|doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.20291|pmid=15368499}}</ref>\n* Jewish communities are comparatively well informed about genetics research, and have been supportive of community efforts to study and prevent genetic diseases.<ref name=JewsasSubjects/>\n\nThe result is a form of [[ascertainment bias]].

Different groups of religious Jews in different geographic areas historically adopted different customs and interpretations. On certain issues, Orthodox Jews are required to follow the customs of their ancestors, and do not believe they have the option of picking and choosing. For this reason, observant Jews at times find it important for religious reasons to ascertain who their household's religious ancestors are in order to know what customs their household should follow. These times include, for example, when two Jews of different ethnic background marry, when a non-Jew converts to Judaism and determines what customs to follow for the first time, or when a lapsed or less observant Jew returns to traditional Judaism and must determine what was done in his or her family's past. In this sense, \"Ashkenazic\" refers both to a family ancestry and to a body of customs binding on Jews of that ancestry. [[Reform Judaism]], which does not necessarily follow those minhagim, did nonetheless originate among Ashkenazi Jews.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/The_Origins_of_Reform_Judaism.html \"The Origins of Reform Judaism.\"] ''Jewish Virtual Library''. 27 May 2014.</ref>\n\nIn a religious sense, an Ashkenazi Jew is any Jew whose family tradition and ritual follows Ashkenazi practice. Until the Ashkenazi community first began to develop in the [[Early Middle Ages]], the centers of Jewish religious authority were in the Islamic world, at [[Baghdad]] and in [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]]. Ashkenaz (Germany) was so distant geographically that it developed a ''[[minhag]]'' of its own. Ashkenazi Hebrew came to be pronounced in ways distinct from other forms of Hebrew.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/hebpronunciation.html \"Pronunciations of Hebrew.\"] ''Jewish Virtual Library''. 27 May 2014.</ref>\n\nIn this respect, the counterpart of Ashkenazi is [[Sephardic]], since most non-Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews follow Sephardic rabbinical authorities, whether or not they are ethnically Sephardic. By tradition, a Sephardic or [[Mizrahi]] woman who marries into an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] or [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Ashkenazi Jewish family raises her children to be Ashkenazi Jews; conversely an Ashkenazi woman who marries a [[Sephardi]] or Mizrahi man is expected to take on Sephardic practice and the children inherit a Sephardic identity, though in practice many families compromise. A [[Conversion to Judaism|convert]] generally follows the practice of the [[beth din]] that converted him or her. With the integration of Jews from around the world in Israel, North America, and other places, the religious definition of an Ashkenazi Jew is blurring, especially outside [[Orthodox Judaism]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Lieberman |first=Asaf |url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/the-unbearable-lightness-of-being-ashkenazi.premium-1.494628 |title=The unbearable lightness of being Ashkenazi. |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=18 January 2013 |access-date=27 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nNew developments in Judaism often transcend differences in religious practice between Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews.

From the [[Rhineland]] to [[Riga]] to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, ''Yiddishkeit'' now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and [[Hasidism]], but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, ''Yiddishkeit'' can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.\n\nAs Ashkenazi Jews moved away from Europe, mostly in the form of [[aliyah]] to Israel, or immigration to North America, and other English-speaking areas such as [[South Africa]]; and Europe (particularly France) and [[Latin America]], the geographic isolation that gave rise to Ashkenazim has given way to mixing with other cultures, and with non-Ashkenazi Jews who, similarly, are no longer isolated in distinct geographic locales. [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] has replaced Yiddish as the primary [[Jewish language]] for many Ashkenazi Jews, although many [[Hasidic]] and [[Hareidi]] groups continue to use Yiddish in daily life. (There are numerous Ashkenazi Jewish anglophones and Russian-speakers as well, although English and Russian are not originally Jewish languages.)\n\nFrance's blended Jewish community is typical of the cultural recombination that is going on among Jews throughout the world. Although France expelled its original Jewish population in the [[Middle Ages]], by the time of the [[French Revolution]], there were two distinct Jewish populations. One consisted of Sephardic Jews, originally refugees from the [[Inquisition]] and concentrated in the southwest, while the other community was Ashkenazi, concentrated in formerly German [[Alsace]], and mainly speaking a German dialect similar to Yiddish. (A third community of Proven\u00e7al Jews living in [[Comtat Venaissin]] were technically outside France, and were later absorbed into the Sephardim.) The two communities were so separate and different that the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] emancipated them separately in 1790 and 1791.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_06791.html \"French Revolution.\"] ''Jewish Virtual Library''. 2008. 29 May 2014.</ref>\n\nBut after emancipation, a sense of a unified French Jewry emerged, especially when France was wracked by the [[Dreyfus affair]] in the 1890s. In the 1920s and 1930s, Ashkenazi Jews from Europe arrived in large numbers as refugees from [[antisemitism]], the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian revolution]], and the economic turmoil of the [[Great Depression]]. By the 1930s, [[Paris]] had a vibrant Yiddish culture, and many Jews were involved in diverse political movements. After the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] years and the [[Holocaust]], the French Jewish population was augmented once again, first by Ashkenazi refugees from Central Europe, and later by Sephardi immigrants and refugees from [[North Africa]], many of them [[francophone]].\n\nAshkenazi Jews did not record their traditions or achievements by text, instead these traditions were passed down orally from one generation to the next.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Frigyesi|first=Judit|date=September 2014|title=Scholarship on East European Jewish Music after the Holocaust|url=|journal=Hungarian Quarterly|volume=54|pages=150\u2013163|issn=1217-2545|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref> The desire to maintain pre-[[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] traditions relating to Ashkenazi culture has often been met with criticism by Jews in [[Eastern Europe]].<ref name=\":02\" /> Reasoning for this could be related to the development of a new style of Jewish arts and culture developed by the [[Jews of Palestine]] during the 1930s and 1940s, which in conjunction with the decimation of European Ashkenazi Jews and their culture by the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] regime made it easier to assimilate to the new style of ritual rather than try to repair the older traditions.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Schleifer|first=Eliyahu|date=1995|title=Current Trends of Liturgical Music in the Ashkenazi Synagogue|journal=The World of Music|volume=37|issue=1|pages=59\u201372|issn=0043-8774|jstor=43562849}}</ref> This new style of tradition was referred to as the ''Mediterranean Style'', and was noted for its simplicity and metaphorical rejuvenation of Jews abroad.<ref name=\":1\" /> This was intended to replace the [[Galut]] traditions, which were more sorrowful in practice.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThen, in the 1990s, yet another Ashkenazi Jewish wave began to arrive from countries of the former [[Soviet Union]] and Central Europe. The result is a pluralistic Jewish community that still has some distinct elements of both Ashkenazi and Sephardic culture. But in France, it is becoming much more difficult to sort out the two, and a distinctly French Jewishness has emerged.<ref>Wall, Irwin. (2002) \"Remaking Jewish Identity in France\", in Howard Wettstein, ''Diaspora's and Exiles''. University of California Press, pp. 164\u201390.</ref>\n\n===By ethnicity===\nIn an ethnic sense, an Ashkenazi Jew is one whose ancestry can be traced to the Jews who settled in Central Europe. For roughly a thousand years, the Ashkenazim were a reproductively isolated population in Europe, despite living in many countries, with little inflow or outflow from migration, conversion, or intermarriage with other groups, including other Jews. Human geneticists have argued that genetic variations have been identified that show high frequencies among Ashkenazi Jews, but not in the general European population, be they for patrilineal markers ([[Y-chromosome]] [[haplotype]]s) and for matrilineal markers ([[mitochondrion|mitotypes]]).<ref name=WadeNYT>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/14/science/14gene.html |title=New Light on Origins of Ashkenazi in Europe |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=14 January 2006 |accessdate=24 May 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081210152054/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/14/science/14gene.html| archivedate=10 December 2008| url-status=live}}</ref> Since the middle of the 20th century, many Ashkenazi Jews have intermarried, both with members of other Jewish communities and with people of other nations and faiths.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/09/science/y-chromosome-bears-witness-to-story-of-the-jewish-diaspora.html |title=Y Chromosome Bears Witness to Story of the Jewish Diaspora |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=9 May 2000 |first=Nicholas |last=Wade}}</ref>\n\nA 2006 study found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup. Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort&nbsp;\u2013 that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease. These Haredi Jews often have extremely large families.<ref name=\"pmid17044734\">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Seldin MF, Shigeta R, Villoslada P |title=European population substructure: clustering of northern and southern populations |journal=PLOS Genet. |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=e143 |date=September 2006 |pmid=17044734 |pmc=1564423 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020143 |display-authors=etal }}</ref>\n\n==Customs, laws and traditions==\nThe ''[[Halakha|Halakhic]]'' practices of ([[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]]) Ashkenazi Jews may differ from those of [[Sephardi Jews]], particularly in matters of custom. Differences are noted in the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' itself, in the gloss of [[Moses Isserles]]. Well known differences in practice include:\n\n[[File:Prager Beerdigungsbruderschaft.jpg|thumb|The example of the ''[[chevra kadisha]]'', the Jewish burial society, Prague, 1772]]\n* Observance of ''[[Passover|Pesach]]'' (Passover): Ashkenazi Jews traditionally refrain from eating [[legumes]], grain, [[millet]], and [[rice]] ([[quinoa]], however, has become accepted as foodgrain in the North American communities), whereas Sephardi Jews typically do not prohibit these foods.\n* Ashkenazi Jews freely mix and eat fish and milk products; some Sephardic Jews refrain from doing so.\n* Ashkenazim are more permissive toward the usage of [[Wig (hair)|wigs]] as a hair covering for married and widowed women.\n* In the case of ''[[kashrut]]'' for meat, conversely, Sephardi Jews have stricter requirements&nbsp;\u2013 this level is commonly referred to as ''[[Beth Yoseph|Beth Yosef]]''. Meat products that are acceptable to Ashkenazi Jews as kosher may therefore be rejected by Sephardi Jews. Notwithstanding stricter requirements for the actual slaughter, Sephardi Jews permit the rear portions of an animal after proper [[Halakha|Halakhic]] removal of the [[sciatic nerve]], while many Ashkenazi Jews do not. This is not because of different interpretations of the law; rather, slaughterhouses could not find adequate skills for correct removal of the sciatic nerve and found it more economical to separate the hindquarters and sell them as non-kosher meat.\n* Ashkenazi Jews often name newborn children after deceased family members, but not after living relatives. Sephardi Jews, in contrast, often name their children after the children's grandparents, even if those grandparents are still living. A notable exception to this generally reliable rule is among [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]], where Ashkenazim for centuries used the naming conventions otherwise attributed exclusively to Sephardim such as [[Chuts]].\n* Ashkenazi [[tefillin]] bear some differences from Sephardic tefillin. In the traditional Ashkenazic rite, the tefillin are wound towards the body, not away from it. Ashkenazim traditionally don tefillin while standing, whereas other Jews generally do so while sitting down.\n* Ashkenazic traditional pronunciations of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] differ from those of other groups. The most prominent consonantal difference from Sephardic and Mizrahic Hebrew dialects is the pronunciation of the Hebrew letter [[Taw (letter)|tav]] in certain Hebrew words (historically, in postvocalic undoubled context) as an /s/ and not a /t/ or /\u03b8/ sound. {{further|Ashkenazi Hebrew}}\n* The prayer shawl, or [[tallit]] (or tallis in Ashkenazi Hebrew), is worn by the majority of Ashkenazi men after marriage, but western European Ashkenazi men wear it from Bar Mitzvah. In Sephardi or Mizrahi Judaism, the prayer shawl is commonly worn from early childhood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/things/tallit.htm |title=''Tallit: Jewish Prayer Shawl'' |publisher=Religionfacts.com |accessdate=2013-07-24}}</ref>\n\n===Ashkenazic liturgy===\n{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|ethnicities}}\nThe term ''Ashkenazi'' also refers to the ''[[nusach Ashkenaz]]'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \"liturgical tradition\", or rite) used by Ashkenazi [[Jew]]s in their ''[[Siddur]]'' (prayer book). A ''nusach'' is defined by a liturgical tradition's choice of prayers, the order of prayers, the text of prayers, and melodies used in the singing of prayers. Two other major forms of nusach among Ashkenazic Jews are [[Nusach Sefard]] (not to be confused with [[Sephardic law and customs|the Sephardic ritual]]), which is the general Polish Hasidic nusach, and [[Nusach Ari]], as used by Lubavitch Hasidim.\n\n===Ashkenazi as a surname===\nSeveral famous people have [[Ashkenazi (surname)|Ashkenazi as a surname]], such as [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]]. However, most people with this surname hail from within Sephardic communities, particularly from the [[Syrian Jew]]ish community. The Sephardic carriers of the surname would have some Ashkenazi ancestors since the surname was adopted by families who were initially of Ashkenazic origins who moved to Sephardi countries and joined those communities. Ashkenazi would be formally adopted as the family surname having started off as a nickname imposed by their adopted communities. Some have shortened the name to Ash.\n\n== Relations with Sephardim ==\n{{Further|Racism in Israel#Intra-Jewish racism: Racism between Jews}}\nRelations between Ashkenazim and Sephardim have at times been tense and clouded by arrogance, snobbery and claims of racial superiority with both sides claiming the inferiority of the other, based upon such features as physical traits and culture.<ref>{{cite book|author1=John M.

However, it is possible that the relaxation of marriage prescription in the ancestors of Ashkenazim drove their heterozygosity up, while the maintenance of the [[Cousin marriage in the Middle East|FBD rule]] in native Middle Easterners has been keeping their heterozygosity values in check. Ashkenazim distinctiveness as found in the Bray et al. study, therefore, may come from their ethnic endogamy (ethnic inbreeding), which allowed them to \"mine\" their ancestral gene pool in the context of relative reproductive isolation from European neighbors, and not from clan endogamy (clan inbreeding). Consequently, their higher diversity compared to Middle Easterners stems from the latter's marriage practices, not necessarily from the former's admixture with Europeans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://anthropogenesis.kinshipstudies.org/2012/07/how-to-interpret-patterns-of-genetic-variation-admixture-divergence-inbreeding/ |title=How to Interpret Patterns of Genetic Variation?

The authors explained that \"the most parsimonious explanation for these observations is a common genetic origin, which is consistent with an historical formulation of the Jewish people as descending from ancient [[Hebrew]] and [[Israelite]] residents of the Levant\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://bhusers.upf.edu/dcomas/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Behar2010.pdf |title=The genome-wide structure of the Jewish people |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume= 466|issue=7303 |date=8 July 2010 |pages=238\u201342 |first1=Doron M. |last1=Behar |first2=Bayazit |last2=Yunusbayev |first3=Mait |last3=Metspalu |first4=Ene |last4=Metspalu |first5=Saharon |last5=Rosset |first6=J\u00fcri |last6=Parik |first7=Siiri |last7=Rootsi |first8=Gyaneshwer |last8=Chaubey |first9=Ildus |last9=Kutuev |first10=Guennady |last10=Yudkovsky |first11=Elza K. |last11=Khusnutdinova |first12=Oleg |last12=Balanovsky |first13=Ornella |last13=Semino |first14=Luisa |last14=Pereira |first15=David |last15=Comas |first16=David |last16=Gurwitz |first17=Batsheva |last17=Bonne-Tamir |first18=Tudor |last18=Parfitt |first19=Michael F. |last19=Hammer |first20=Karl |last20=Skorecki |first21=Richard |last21=Villems |doi=10.1038/nature09103 |accessdate=2013-09-04 |pmid=20531471|bibcode = 2010Natur.466..238B }}</ref>\n\nA study by Behar et al. (2013) found evidence in Ashkenazim of mixed European and Levantine origins. The authors found the greatest affinity and shared ancestry of Ashkenazi Jews to be firstly with other Jewish groups from southern Europe, Syria, and North Africa, and secondly with both southern Europeans (such as Italians) and modern Levantines (such as the [[Druze]], Cypriots, Lebanese and [[Samaritans]]). In addition to finding no affinity in Ashkenazim with northern Caucasus populations, the authors found no more affinity in Ashkenazi Jews to modern south Caucasus and eastern Anatolian populations (such as [[Armenians]], [[Azeris]], [[Georgians]], and Turks) than found in non-Ashkenazi Jews or non-Jewish Middle Easterners (such as the [[Kurds]], Iranians, Druze and Lebanese).<ref name = \"WayneState2013\">{{cite journal|last1 = Behar |first1 = Doron M. |last2 = Metspalu |first2 = Mait |last3 = Baran |first3 = Yael |last4 = Kopelman |first4 = Naama M. |last5 = Yunusbayev |first5 = Bayazit |last6 = Gladstein |first6 = Ariella |last7 = Tzur |first7 = Shay |last8 = Sahakyan |first8 = Havhannes |last9 = Bahmanimehr |first9 = Ardeshir |last10 = Yepiskoposyan |first10 = Levon |last11 = Tambets |first11 = Kristiina |last12 = Khusnutdinova |first12 = Elza K. |last13 = Kusniarevich |first13 = Aljona |last14 = Balanovsky |first14 = Oleg |first15 = Elena |last15 = Balanovsky |first16 = Lejla |last16 = Kovacevic |first17 = Damir |last17 = Marjanovic |first18 = Evelin |last18 = Mihailov |first19 = Anastasia |last19 = Kouvatsi |first20 = Costas |last20 = Traintaphyllidis |first21 = Roy J. |last21 = King |first22 = Ornella |last22 = Semino |first23 = Antonio |last23 = Torroni |first24 = Michael F. |last24 = Hammer |first25 = Ene |last25 = Metspalu |first26 = Karl |last26 = Skorecki |first27 = Saharon |last27 = Rosset |first28 = Eran |last28 = Halperin |first29 = Richard |last29 = Villems |first30 = Noah A. |last30 = Rosenberg|year = 2013 |title = No Evidence from Genome-Wide Data of a Khazar Origin for the Ashkenazi Jews|url = http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/humbiol_preprints/41/ |journal = Human Biology Open Access Pre-Prints |publisher = [[Wayne State University]] |issue = 41 |accessdate = 14 October 2014 |quote = Final version at http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/humbiol/vol85/iss6/9/}}</ref>\n\nA 2017 autosomal study by Xue, Shai Carmi et al. found an approximately even mixture of Middle-Eastern (Levantine) and European ancestry in Ashkenazi Jews: with the European component being largely Southern European with a minority being Eastern European, and the Middle Eastern ancestry showing the strongest affinity to Levantine populations such as the Druze and Lebanese.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Xue J, Lencz T, Darvasi A, Pe'er I, Carmi S | title = The time and place of European admixture in Ashkenazi Jewish history | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = e1006644 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28376121 | pmc = 5380316 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006644 }}</ref>\n\n===The Khazar hypothesis===\n{{Main|Khazar hypothesis of Ashkenazi ancestry}}\nIn the late 19th century, it was proposed that the core of today's Ashkenazi Jewry are genetically descended from a [[Khazar hypothesis of Ashkenazi ancestry|hypothetical Khazarian Jewish diaspora]] who had migrated westward from modern Russia and Ukraine into modern France and Germany (as opposed to the currently held theory that Jews migrated from France and Germany into Eastern Europe).

The authors found no affinity in Ashkenazim with north Caucasus populations, as well as no greater affinity in Ashkenazim to south Caucasus or Anatolian populations than that found in non-Ashkenazi Jews and non-Jewish Middle Easterners (such as the Kurds, Iranians, Druze and Lebanese).

Indeed, much awareness of \"Ashkenazi Jews\" as an ethnic group or category stems from the large number of genetic studies of disease, including many that are well reported in the media, that have been conducted among Jews. Jewish populations have been studied more thoroughly than most other human populations, for a variety of reasons:\n* Jewish populations, and particularly the large Ashkenazi Jewish population, are ideal for such research studies, because they exhibit a high degree of [[endogamy]], yet they are sizable.<ref name=JewsasSubjects>{{cite journal|author=Carmeli, Daphna Birenbaum|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics|year=2004|title=Prevalence of Jews as subjects in genetic research: Figures, explanation, and potential implications |volume=130A|issue=1|pages=76\u201383|doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.20291|pmid=15368499}}</ref>\n* Jewish communities are comparatively well informed about genetics research, and have been supportive of community efforts to study and prevent genetic diseases.<ref name=JewsasSubjects/>\n\nThe result is a form of [[ascertainment bias]].

Brewer travels around Europe to source target cars when local examples are either too expensive to buy or too rusty to work on. Aside from being the first to travel outside the UK, several production elements have changed. For example, the segment where Brewer interviews people with similar cars has been dropped, giving the series more focus on the car being restored. In addition, China joins Brewer in the car's final test drive before the sale.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 100%; margin-right: 0;\"\n|- style=\"color:white\"\n! style=\"background:#A69482; \"| <small>No.</small>\n! style=\"background:#A69482; \"| #\n! style=\"background:#A69482; \"| Vehicle\n! style=\"background:#A69482; \"| Budget\n! style=\"background:#A69482; \"| Purchase<br />Price\n! style=\"background:#A69482; \"| Final Cost<br />After Restoration\n! style=\"background:#A69482; \"| Final<br />Selling Price\n! style=\"background:#A69482; \"| Profit/Loss\n! style=\"background:#A69482; \"| Original airdate\n|-\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 25\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1/2\n| RTitle          = [[Mercedes-Benz R107 and C107|1983 Mercedes-Benz 280SL (R107)]]\n| Aux1            = \u00a35,000\n| DirectedBy      = \u20ac6,900 (\u00a35,400)\n| WrittenBy       = \u00a36,920\n| Aux2            = \u00a37,900\n| Aux3            = +\u00a3980\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2008|10|28|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = '''Work Completed:''' Replaced front brake discs and calipers, convertible hood, entire exhaust system, aftermarket wheels and steering wheel for originals, repaired rust patch on front right wing, changed headlamps to UK-spec units.\n----\n'''Notes:''' Purchased in [[Bergen, Upper Bavaria|Bergen]] near [[Munich]], [[Germany]].

Beginning December, he launched an offensive in order to free [[Battle of Teruel|Teruel]], but by February the Republican Army had to retreat after suffering heavy losses and the [[rebel faction]] launched a counter-offensive in [[Aragon Offensive|Aragon]], cutting in half the Republican-held zone. On July 1938 Negr\u00edn launched an offensive in order to cross the [[Battle of Ebro|Ebro River]] and reconnect the two Republican-held zones. The Republican army managed to cross the Ebro, but by November had to retire after it suffered heavy casualties and lost most of its materiel.
