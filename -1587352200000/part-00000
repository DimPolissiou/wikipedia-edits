Albert was responsible for the exterior's [[terra cotta]] ornamentation. The moving company founders, John and William Reebie, are represented by the two statues of [[Ramses II]] that flank the main entrance. William Reebie (1859-1921) founded the company in 1880. The Reebie brothers wanted a building in a distinctive style, and John Reebie had seen another Egyptian Revival storage building in Stockton, California (designed in 1918 by Glenn Allen for the Dawson-Mayflower Moving Company). John Reebie had also visited Egypt at some time before 1921 as well. \n[[File:Reebie Storage building during feb 2 2011 storm.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The entrance to the building during the [[January 31\u2013February 2, 2011 North American winter storm]] ]]\n[[Image:Reebie marker.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A marker on the building in 2008]]\n[[File:Reebie Storage, Chicago September 2, 2013-5022.jpg|thumb|right|200px|building detail, 2013]]\n[[File:Reebie Storage National Register of Historic Places marker, Chicago September 2, 2013-5023.jpg|thumb|right|marker]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Chicago Landmark]]\n*[[Chicago architecture]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{commons category}}\n\n[[Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1922]]\n[[Category:Egyptian Revival architecture in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Warehouses on the National Register of Historic Places]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Chicago]]\n\n\n{{Chicago-struct-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Hmains", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:category refine, sort sequence", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reebie_Storage_Warehouse"}

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: [[Craddock Dufty]], P.

After a series of 3 trial matches on 27 June both the New Zealand team and Auckland teams were selected. Officials had declared that \"give us fine weather and we will get an attendance of 20,000\". Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: [[Craddock Dufty]], P.
