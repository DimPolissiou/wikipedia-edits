In 1891 Sherwood was proclaimed a local government area, being part of the Yeerongpilly Division established by Xlll the Divisional Board Act of 1879, which instituted local government to sparsely populated districts of Queensland. \nThe future Sherwood Shire contained an area of 22 square miles. The most northerly landmark, Oxley Point (Chelmer), was on the Brisbane River, 5 miles southwest of Brisbane. Reaching this point by the Brisbane River, involved a journey of twelve miles. The northern and western boundaries of the shire were the Brisbane River from the mouth of Oxley Creek to Woogaroo Creek in the south-west with Oxley Creek forming the eastern boundary.  The southern boundary was the upper reaches of the Oxley creek proceeding in a south-easterly direction to a point 1 mile above the mouth of Woogaroo Creek to its junction with the Brisbane River.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189286|title=Suburban Conservatism in the Sherwood Shire, 1891-1920|last1=Fones|first1=Ralph|date=1 January 1993|website=UQ eSpace|publisher=The University of Queensland|format=PDF|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref> \n== Early History == \n==== Brisbane River ====\nThree shipwrecked and disoriented ticket of leave convicts, [[Thomas Pamphlett|Pamphlet]], Finnegan and Parsons in June 1823 were walking and were diverted by the river to the mouth of Oxley Creek. The discovery of two native canoes allowed them to cross the river and journey downstream.

From 1842, the river was the regular means of transport between Brisbane and Ipswich. The [[Seventeen Mile Rocks, Queensland|Seventeen Mile Rocks]] caused delays to laden vessels until the tide rose sufficiently to pass. From the 1860s, local selectors transported produce by river to Ipswich and Brisbane with tide times influencing the lifestyle of the early farmers.

Alexander Boyd, a farmer on Oxley Creek between 1864 and 1870, documented the common occurrence of high floods.The 1893 flood peaked 48 feet above the low tide mark at the Oxley Creek mouth, while upstream, the water rose 20 to 30 feet. The flooded Brisbane River destroyed houses, outbuildings along with farm animals destroying the railway bridge at Oxley Point. As a result of the flood, there was created a beach at Oxley Point, known as \u2018The Sands\u2019 becoming a popular swimming area.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brisbanehistory.com/1893_brisbane_flood_intro.html|title=The 1893 flood|accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:StateLibQld 2 183451 Rural scene in Oxley Road, Chelmer, Brisbane, in 1906.jpg|thumb|Chelmer Swamp and Oxley Road]]\n\n==== Land Features ====\nSeveral hills, part of a system of low ridges extending from Spring Mountain sixteen miles to the south-west, ranged from 100 to 200 feet. Two of these hills in the now residential suburbs of Corinda and Oxley, lay close to a bend of the river downstream from [[Seventeen Mile Rocks, Queensland|Seventeen Mile Rocks]]. From these hills, several seasonal steams coursed towards Oxley Creek forming swamps and lagoons. The largest of these swamps was situated south of Oxley Point in present day [[Chelmer, Queensland|Chelmer]]. In the 1940s it was designated a municipal rubbish dump and the swamp was filled in. It lay where the current sporting grounds are now situated on the eastern side of the Chelmer Station. The hills and ridges on the southern boundary fed other streams such as Bullock Head Creek and Sandy Creek which combined to form Wolston Creek.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nExplorers and early selectors in the area recorded descriptions of the original flora. Oxley\u2019s made account of rich brush along the river, and the settlers of the 1860s referred to the dense scrub which clothed the river and creek banks and giant fig trees grew abundantly. The land\u2019s natural features influenced the lifestyle of the local Aborigines being from Jagarra tribe. This tribe\u2019s habitat lay along the Brisbane River, westwards almost to the Great Dividing Range. They referred to the land on either side of Oxley Creek as Bennawarra. The wildlife of swamps and attracted a section of the tribe known as Yerongapan.<ref name=\":0\" />\n  \nOccasionally, white contact with Aborigines led to clashes. In 1828, at Seventeen Mile Rocks, Aborigines attacked a boat from Limestone Hill, (Ipswich), killing a soldier and a convict. ln 1832, there was a massacre of a convict fishing party on the Brisbane River. By the 1860s, hostilities had ceased in the local area with white settlers being permitted to witness a [[corroboree]] near Oxley Creek. Early selectors found evidence of Aboriginal sites, believing a circular floating island in the large Oxley Point (Chelmer) swamp was a [[Bora (Australian)|bora ring]]. There were other reported areas used as borra rings one being between the Anglican Cemetery and Oxley Creek, and on the site of the [[Corinda railway station]]. Seventeen Mile Rocks at low tide provided crossing to [[Fig Tree Pocket, Queensland|Fig Tree Pocket]] for aboriginals, known to local Aborigines as Biami Yumba, \u2018the abode of the good spirits\u2019.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Early Exploration and Settlement ==\nThe white man first exploited the local area during the convict era, extracting pine and other building materials. Between 1825 and 1829, convicts quarried a portion of Corinda Hill for [[sandstone]], which was used in the construction of the [[Commissariat Store, Brisbane|Commissariat]] and [[The Old Windmill, Brisbane|Windmill]] in the penal colony. This quarry is located at the western point of Quarry Street. In 1851, Thomas Boyland leased land of what became the Shire, where he grazed cattle and sheep. The land became to then be known as Boyland\u2019s Pocket. After Queensland became a colony in 1859, Boyland declined and offer to purchase the land.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Corinda_to_Chelmer_Initial_Landowners_1860s.jpg|thumb|Corinda to Chelmer Initial Landowners 1860s]]\nIn May 1860, the land was subdivided into 25 portions. Each portion averaged 60 acres and initially sold for \u00a31 an acre, the area being eventually known as Oxley West. Between 1861 and 1864, 96 portions of land, were offered for sale in the area known as [[Oxley, Queensland|Oxley]]. In 1851, Lands Commissioner, Dr. Stephen Simpson leased 5,500 acres of land in the south-western section and purchased 640 acres where he erected his home [[Wolston House]], near Wolston Creek. After using the property as a horse stud, he returned to England in 1860 after the death of his nephew, James Ommaney, killed when thrown from a horse while riding on the Wolston property. A hill close to where the fatality occurred was named Mt. Ommaney. Grazier, Matthew Goggs senior, purchased Simpsons holding, and enlarged it.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Corinda_Oxley_17_Mile_Rocks_Initial_Landowners.jpg|thumb|Initial Landowners in Corinda Oxley 17 Mile Rocks Area]]\nFollowing the subdivision of Oxley West, the subsequent land sale attracted both speculators and immigrant settlers. There were three categories of land purchasers during the 1860s: the speculators the immigrant; and immigrants arriving after most of the land had been sold. Speculators included Governor Bowen\u2019s secretary, [[John Bramston (Australian politician)|John Bramston]], who purchased land at Oxley Point and [[Charles Blakeney (politician)|Charles Blakeney]], Frank McDougall and [[Arnold Wienholt]], who served in either the upper or lower houses of the colonial legislature during the 1860s, but did not reside locally.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSeveral immigrants paid their fare to Australia from Britain and on arrival received land orders which equaled the cost of their fares. However, the [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/4604131 initial price of land], \u00a31 per acre rose to \u00a33, then to \u00a36, thereby reducing the purchasing power of land orders. Original land purchasers such as Alexander Boyd, William Gray and [[Arthur Francis (politician)|Arthur Francis]] settled on or near elevated land now known as Corinda Hill.\nDespite their farming intentions, Boyd, Gray and Francis lacked experience. Having persevered, their contribution lay outside the local area: Boyd, a school inspector; Gray, a Congregational minister; and Francis, a magistrate. Other original land purchasers being the Strong and Orr families, (Oxley West), and the Lucock and Brodie families, (Oxley), continued to earn their living in the local area as farmers. They instead chose the fertile river and creek flats.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nThe third category of land purchaser acquired their land from either speculators or selectors. The Berry and [[Sinnamon Farm|Sinnamon]] families who financed their trip from Northern Ireland, initially worked for original settlers, William Gray and William Dart. Unmarried migrants, John Donaldson assisted government surveyor John Payne and [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/20762226 John A. Dunlop] labouring for William Gray. They gained an intimate knowledge of the area, and along with the Berry and Sinnamon families and other latecomers like the Nosworthy and Trotter families they farmed the fertile land adjoining the Brisbane River and Oxley Creek.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \n== Farming ==\nA number of selectors intended to [[Cotton|grow cotton]], as the [[American Civil War|American civil war]] disrupted shipments to British cotton manufacturers, but cash crops being bananas, vegetables and citrus fruits provided a reliable income.

Arthur Francis employed male and female [[Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)|kanakas]] with Christianity forming the basis of friendly relations between himself and his plantation workers. Initially Berry and Francis constructed primitive horse driven sugar mills; with Berry\u2019s mill employing up to sixty men.  Thomas Berry Junior also operated a steam driven mill.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nDuring 1872, the Oxley Creek district produced 270 tons of sugar from 244 acres of harvested cane. Only half the acreage under cane was harvested, because of the effect of severe winters and accompanying frosts. By 1874 however, a disease [[Puccinia melanocephala|referred to as rust]], caused problems having devastated cane crops in Southern Queensland and consequently cane farming in the Oxley Creek district waned. Local farmers, like Joseph Tainton depended on reliable cereal crops and by the 1890s, farmers had added [[Dairy|dairying]] to their activities, continuing into the early 1900s. The number of farmers was 58 by 1900.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nThere were summer heatwaves of the 1860s which contrasted with the severe winters of the 1870s which had adversely affected cane farming. New settlers experienced the humid conditions typical of a semi-tropical climate. Thomas Berry senior noted the hot summer of 1863, when the temperature in Fahrenheit averaged 95 degrees in the shade and 135 degrees outside. There was a drought in 1877 and pressure was put on the State Government to build a water reservoir in the Sherwood area. In 1878 a reservoir was built to dam watercourses at the rear of the Oxley West (Sherwood) State School.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article181819614|title=OXLEY.|date=1 June 1878|newspaper=[[The Week]]|access-date=3 March 2020|location=Queensland, Australia|page=22|via=Trove}}</ref> The most severe drought occurred between 1899 and 1902 when many of the Sinnamon family\u2019s stock perished.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nThe characteristics of generosity, stubbornness and self-determination were attributed to William Gray, who settled locally in 1861. This was matched by the reliability and trustworthiness of John Dunlop, an early farmer and bush carpenter. William Dart, a typical agriculturalist rose at 4 am and conscientiously worked until dark, clearing and developing his holding. [[Arthur Francis (politician)|Arthur M.

The tragic and depressing aspect of pioneering life involved the loss of children at birth or in the months following. This was put down to the lack of pre-natal care and the scarcity of milk which contributed to problems after the birth of a child. The loss of children in infancy had a prolonged effect on Angela Francis. She was motivated to establish a mid-wife training scheme for women in isolated areas. On another occasion, to prevent the possibility of naive female migrants succumbing to the adverse influences of urban life, Angela Francis trained several young females as governesses.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1863 the residents presented a petition to government signed by 30 residents, called for the construction of a bridge over Oxley Creek which had the effect of halving the distance to the Brisbane markets. The creek had recently been bridged upstream at Oxley during the construction of a new road from Ipswich to Brisbane. The government responded by building another bridge from Sherwood over Oxley Creek in 1864, one mile from its mouth and in 1865, a road linked this bridge to Rocky Waterholes ([[Rocklea, Queensland|Rocklea]]).  In the mid-1870s, the installation of a vehicular ferry between Oxley Point ([[Chelmer, Queensland|Chelmer]]) and [[Indooroopilly, Queensland|Indooroopilly]] provided another avenue of land transport to Brisbane.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Churches ==\n==== Moral Dilemma ====\nIn 1889, there was another petition concerning the hotel at Oxley. Rather than being a benefit to the local area, the hotel had operated as a change station for horses and a refreshment stop for coaches on [[Ipswich Road, Brisbane|Ipswich Road]]. In 1873, a new hotel was constructed at the intersection of present day Ipswich and Oxley Roads. In 1889, 23 residents, in their petition expressed their objection that the new Oxley hotel, in addition to its Liquor licence, also had a [[Music hall|Music Hall]] licence. There were fears that a music hall would attract the larrikin element.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nIn the absence of a local police station until 1876, a moral influence was required due to the temptation of hotels at Oxley and Rocky Waterholes (Rocklea). Before churches were erected, males of families conducted services in their homes. In 1864, a Baptist church was built but soon closed due to lack of support. In 1863 in a tent close to present day [[Corinda railway station|Corinda Railway Station]], William Gray conducted [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/179957384 Presbyterian services].

Several protestant churches continued to campaign for the prohibition of liquor to all the public. Influenced by the three Sherwood protestant church\u2019s congregations, public opinion within the Shire ensured that hotel ownership remained confined to Oxley, with the result that suburbs from Corinda to Chelmer were free from any establishment which sold alcohol.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \n==== Church Formation ====\nBy the 1890s, due to the presence of three active church congregations, the suburb of Sherwood had become the religious focus of most Protestants living in the Shire.

The Divisional Board Act of 1879 established Yeerongpilly Division, with the future Sherwood Shire designated number two subdivision.

The auditor-general scrutinized the shires finances, and the councils financial statements were regularly published in the Queensland Government Gazette. To facilitate operations, Sherwood was divided into three areas, as divisions. Number one division comprised the southern portion of Oxley, all of Darra, as well as the farming districts of Seventeen Mile Rocks and Wolston. Number two division included Corinda, the northern and eastern portions of Oxley, and the southern part of Sherwood.

On Oxley Road at Corinda there was the Shire's administration building.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nEach division was represented by three elected members or councillors, who usually served three years and were ratepayers. One member retired annually but was eligible for re-election. The representatives of the three divisions formed the nine member shire council and elected the chairman from amongst their number. In 1920, the Local Authorities Acts Amendment Act instituted triennial elections. This required the whole council to retire, with the chairman, and the three councillors in each of the three divisions, elected by the adult residents residing in the shire rather than by the ratepayers.

By the 1860s, hostilities had ceased in the local area with white settlers being permitted to witness a [[corroboree]] near Oxley Creek.

This quarry is located at the western point of Quarry Street. In 1851, Thomas Boyland leased land of what became the Shire, where he grazed cattle and sheep.

Between 1861 and 1864, 96 portions of land, were offered for sale in the area known as [[Oxley, Queensland|Oxley]]. In 1851, Lands Commissioner, Dr. Stephen Simpson leased 5,500 acres of land in the south-western section and purchased 640 acres where he erected his home [[Wolston House]], near Wolston Creek.

Original land purchasers such as Alexander Boyd, William Gray and [[Arthur Francis (politician)|Arthur Francis]] settled on or near elevated land now known as Corinda Hill.\nDespite their farming intentions, Boyd, Gray and Francis lacked experience. Having persevered, their contribution lay outside the local area: Boyd, a school inspector; Gray, a Congregational minister; and Francis, a magistrate.

The tragic and depressing aspect of pioneering life involved the loss of children at birth or in the months following. This was put down to the lack of pre-natal care and the scarcity of milk which contributed to problems after the birth of a child. The loss of children in infancy had a prolonged effect on Angela Francis. She was motivated to establish a mid-wife training scheme for women in isolated areas.

In 2006, the CBA Patroons were joined by the former [[Pennsylvania ValleyDawgs]] of the USBL though their first home game as the USBL Patroons did not take place until 2007. It also became home to the [[New York Buzz]] of [[World TeamTennis]] prior to their 2008 season.\n\nOn December 15, 2007 the Armory had to cancel a concert of the rock band  [[Brand New (band)|Brand New]] because the roof began to cave in.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fightoffyourdemons.com/news.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227090026/http://www.fightoffyourdemons.com/news.html |archivedate=2007-12-27 |title=News |publisher=Fightoffyourdemons.com |date=2007-12-27 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities and management==\n[[Image:WashingtonAvenueArmoryLogo.png|left|200px|thumb|Armory logo]]\nThe Armory has {{convert|38000|sqft}} of floor space, meeting facilities, and two video screens.

This area is fragile, the intestinal walls do not feel pain and for objects pushed too far, surgery may be necessary for removal (even without injury). Unsafe anal masturbation methods cause harm and a potential trip to the hospital emergency room. However, anal masturbation can be carried out in greater safety by ensuring that the bowel is emptied before beginning, the anus and rectum are sufficiently lubricated and relaxed throughout, and the inserted object is not of too great a size.\n\n===Objects===\n[[Image:Buttplug.png|upright|thumb|Butt plugs often have a flared base and are free of seams.]]\n\nSome anal stimulators are purposely ribbed or have a wave pattern in order to enhance pleasure and simulate intercourse. Stimulating the rectum with a rough-edged object or a finger (for the purposes of medically stimulating a bowel movement or other reasons) may lead to rectum wall tearing, especially if the fingernail is left untrimmed. Vegetables have rough edges and most have [[microorganism]]s on the surface, and thus could lead to infection if not sanitized before use.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Risks associated with bleeding===\nMinor injuries that cause some bleeding to the rectum pose measurable risk, and often need treatment. Injury can be contained by cessation of anal stimulation at any sign of injury, bleeding, or pain. While minor bleeding may stop of its own accord, individuals with serious injury, clotting problems, or other medical factors could face serious risk and require medical attention.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nProlonged or heavy bleeding can indicate a life-threatening situation, as the intestinal wall can be damaged, leading to internal injury of the [[peritoneal cavity]] and [[peritonitis]], which can be fatal. Carefully using implements without sharp edges or rough surfaces carries a lower risk of damage to the intestinal wall.\n\nThe treatment for persistent or heavy bleeding will require a visit to an emergency room for a [[sigmoidoscopy]] and [[cauterization]] in order to prevent further loss of blood. Apart from the volume of blood that is lost into the rectum, other easily observable indications that medical intervention is urgently needed as a result of blood loss are an elevated heart rate, a general feeling of faintness or weakness, and a loss of pleasure from the act.\n\n===Rectal foreign bodies===\n{{see also|Rectal foreign body}}\nButt plugs normally have a flared base to prevent complete insertion and should be carefully sanitized before and after use. Sex toys, including objects for rectal insertion, should not be shared in order to minimize the risk of disease. Objects such as lightbulbs, jars or anything breakable such as glass or wax candles cannot safely be used in anal masturbation, as they may break or shatter, causing highly dangerous medical situations.\n\nSome objects can become lodged above the lower colon and could be seriously difficult to remove. Such foreign bodies should not be allowed to remain in place. Medical help should be sought if the object does not emerge on its own. Immediate assistance is recommended if the object is not a proper rectal toy, like a plug or something soft, for example if it is either too hard, too large, has projections, slightly sharp edges, or if any trace of injury happens (bleeding, pain, cramps). Small objects with dimensions similar to small stools are less likely to become lodged than medium-sized or large objects as they can usually be expelled by forcing a bowel movement. It is always safest if a graspable part of the object remains outside the body.\n\n==Hygiene==\nThe biological function of the anus is to expel [[intestinal gas]] and [[feces]] from the body; therefore, when engaging in anal masturbation, hygiene is important. One may wish to cover butt plugs or other objects with a [[condom]] before insertion and then dispose of the condom afterwards. To minimize the potential transfer of germs between sexual partners, there are practices of [[safe sex]] recommended by healthcare professionals. Oral or vaginal infection may occur similarly to penile [[Ass to mouth|anus-to-mouth]] or [[anilingus]] practices.<ref>{{cite book | author = Morin, Jack | title = Anal Pleasure and Health | edition = 3rd | publisher = Down There Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-940208-20-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzRpRcMQjkYC}}</ref>{{Request quotation|date=June 2009}}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Human sexuality}}\n* [[Anal eroticism]]\n* [[Anal sex]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Masturbation}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anal Masturbation}}\n[[Category:Anal eroticism]]\n[[Category:Masturbation]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[Image:Male anatomy en.svg|right|thumb|The male sexual organs]]\n\n'''Anal masturbation''' is an [[masturbation|erotic stimulation]] focusing on the [[anus]] and [[rectum]].

Focus stacking can also be useful in [[landscape photography]].\n\nFocus stacking offers flexibility: since it is a computational technique, images with several different depths of field can be generated in post-processing and compared for best artistic merit or scientific clarity. Focus stacking also allows generation of images physically impossible with normal imaging equipment; images with nonplanar focus regions can be generated. Alternative techniques for generating images with increased or flexible depth of field include [[wavefront coding]] and [[light-field camera]]s.\n\n==Technique==\nThe starting point for focus stacking is a series of images captured at different focus distances; in each image different areas of the sample will be in focus. While none of these images has the sample entirely in focus they collectively contain all the data required to generate an image which has all parts of the sample in focus. In-focus regions of each image may be detected automatically, for example via [[edge detection]] or [[Fourier analysis]], or selected manually. The in-focus patches are then blended together to generate the final image.\n\nThis processing is also called z-stacking, focal plane merging (or zedification in French).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lenaturaliste.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=253&t=3397&p=50691 |title=Afficher le sujet - Proposition d'un terme fran\u00e7ais pour \"focus stacking\" \u2022 Le Naturaliste |website=Lenaturaliste.net |language=French |accessdate=2012-10-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msss.com/science/msl-mahli-instrument-description.php |title=Malin Space Science Systems - Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) Instrument Description |website=Msss.com |accessdate=2012-10-05}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hindesite - Lily - Focus Stacking (by).ogv|thumb|Video example of how focus stacking is applied to images]]\n\n===In photography===\nGetting sufficient [[depth of field]] can be particularly challenging in [[macro photography]], because depth of field is smaller (shallower) for objects nearer the camera, so if a small object fills the frame, it is often so close that its entire depth cannot be in focus at once. Depth of field is normally increased by stopping down [[aperture]] (using a larger [[f-number]]), but beyond a certain point, stopping down causes [[Science of photography#Diffraction limit|blurring due to diffraction]], which counteracts the benefit of being in focus. It also reduces the luminosity of the image. Focus stacking allows the depth of field of images taken at the sharpest aperture to be effectively increased. The images at right illustrate the increase in DOF that can be achieved by combining multiple exposures.\n\n[[File:PIA18609 - First Sampling Hole in Mount Sharp .jpg|thumb|Stacked image of the [[Curiosity Rover]]s first sampling hole in [[Mount Sharp]]. The hole is {{convert|1.6|cm|in}} wide and {{convert|6.7|cm|in}} deep.]]\n\nThe [[Mars Science Laboratory]] mission has a device called [[Mars Hand Lens Imager]] (MAHLI), which can take photos that can later be focus stacked.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://msl-scicorner.jpl.nasa.gov/Instruments/MAHLI/ |title=MSL Science Corner: Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) |website=MSL-SciCorner.JPL.NASA.gov |accessdate=2012-10-05}}</ref>\n\n===In microscopy===\nIn microscopy high [[numerical aperture]]s are desirable to capture as much light as possible from a small sample. A high numerical aperture (equivalent to a low f number) gives a very shallow depth of field. Higher magnification [[objective lens]]es generally have shallower depth of field; a 100\u00d7 objective lens with a numerical aperture of around 1.4 has a depth of field of approximately 1 [[\u03bcm]]. When observing a sample directly the limitations of the shallow depth of field are easy to circumvent by focusing up and down through the sample; to effectively present microscopy data of a complex 3D structure in 2D, focus stacking is a very useful technique.\n\nAtomic resolution [[scanning transmission electron microscopy]] encounters similar difficulties, where specimen features are much larger than the depth of field.

Focus stacking can also be useful in [[landscape photography]].\n\nFocus stacking offers flexibility: since it is a computational technique, images with several different depths of field can be generated in post-processing and compared for best artistic merit or scientific clarity. Focus stacking also allows generation of images physically impossible with normal imaging equipment; images with nonplanar focus regions can be generated. Alternative techniques for generating images with increased or flexible depth of field include [[wavefront coding]] and [[light-field camera]]s.\n\n==Technique==\nThe starting point for focus stacking is a series of images captured at different focus distances; in each image different areas of the sample will be in focus. While none of these images has the sample entirely in focus they collectively contain all the data required to generate an image which has all parts of the sample in focus. In-focus regions of each image may be detected automatically, for example via [[edge detection]] or [[Fourier analysis]], or selected manually. The in-focus patches are then blended together to generate the final image.\n\nThis processing is also called z-stacking, focal plane merging (or zedification in French).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lenaturaliste.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=253&t=3397&p=50691 |title=Afficher le sujet - Proposition d'un terme fran\u00e7ais pour \"focus stacking\" \u2022 Le Naturaliste |website=Lenaturaliste.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msss.com/science/msl-mahli-instrument-description.php |title=Malin Space Science Systems - Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) Instrument Description |website=Msss.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-05}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hindesite - Lily - Focus Stacking (by).ogv|thumb|upright|Video example of how focus stacking is applied to images]]\n\n===In photography===\nGetting sufficient [[depth of field]] can be particularly challenging in [[macro photography]], because depth of field is smaller (shallower) for objects nearer the camera, so if a small object fills the frame, it is often so close that its entire depth cannot be in focus at once. Depth of field is normally increased by stopping down [[aperture]] (using a larger [[f-number]]), but beyond a certain point, stopping down causes [[Science of photography#Diffraction limit|blurring due to diffraction]], which counteracts the benefit of being in focus. It also reduces the luminosity of the image. Focus stacking allows the depth of field of images taken at the sharpest aperture to be effectively increased. The images at right illustrate the increase in DOF that can be achieved by combining multiple exposures.\n\n[[File:PIA18609 - First Sampling Hole in Mount Sharp .jpg|thumb|Stacked image of the [[Curiosity Rover]]s first sampling hole in [[Mount Sharp]]. The hole is {{convert|1.6|cm|in}} wide and {{convert|6.7|cm|in}} deep.]]\n\nThe [[Mars Science Laboratory]] mission has a device called [[Mars Hand Lens Imager]] (MAHLI), which can take photos that can later be focus stacked.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://msl-scicorner.jpl.nasa.gov/Instruments/MAHLI/ |title=MSL Science Corner: Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) |website=Msl-scicorner.jpl.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-10-05}}</ref>\n\n\n===In microscopy===\nIn microscopy high [[numerical aperture]]s are desirable to capture as much light as possible from a small sample. A high numerical aperture (equivalent to a low f number) gives a very shallow depth of field. Higher magnification [[objective lens]]es generally have shallower depth of field; a 100\u00d7 objective lens with a numerical aperture of around 1.4 has a depth of field of approximately 1 [[\u03bcm]]. When observing a sample directly the limitations of the shallow depth of field are easy to circumvent by focusing up and down through the sample; to effectively present microscopy data of a complex 3D structure in 2D, focus stacking is a very useful technique.\n\nAtomic resolution [[scanning transmission electron microscopy]] encounters similar difficulties, where specimen features are much larger than the depth of field.  By taking a [[TSOM|through-focal series]], the depth of focus can be reconstructed to create a single image entirely in focus.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1431927610094171 |title=Extended Depth of Field for High-Resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy |year=2010 |last1=Hovden |first1=Robert |last2=Xin |first2=Huolin L. |last3=Muller |first3=David A. |journal=Microscopy and Microanalysis |volume=17 |pages=75\u201380 |pmid=21122192 |issue=1|arxiv=1010.4500 |bibcode=2011MiMic..17...75H }}</ref>\n\n==Software / Application==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Focus stacking software\n|-\n!
