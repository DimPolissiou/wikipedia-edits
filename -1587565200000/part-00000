The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Gandhi supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi.

The main reason was the perceived bias of the United States and [[China]], rivals of the USSR, towards Pakistan. The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and the casting of a veto at the United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Before the war, Gandhi signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. They were unhappy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Gandhi was unhappy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept her from criticising the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Gandhi years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Gandhi, by the early 1980s, the Soviets had become India's largest trading partner.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short-lived liberalisation programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1969. The government targeted growth at 5.7% while stating as its goals, \"growth with stability and progressive achievement of self-reliance.\"{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}}<ref name=\"Gupta\">{{Cite book| publisher = Deep and Deep Publications| page = 7|url={{Googlebooks|8D0iS_EF8_AC|page=PA7|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|isbn=978-8176295598| last = Gupta| first =  K.

The programme emphasised greater state control of the economy with the understanding that government control assured greater welfare than private control.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Related to this point were a set of policies which were meant to regulate the private sector.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} By the end of the 1960s, the reversal of the liberalisation process was complete, and India's policies were characterised as \"protectionist as ever.\"<ref name=\"Kirk\"/>\n\nTo deal with India's food problems, Gandhi expanded the emphasis on production of inputs to agriculture that had already been initiated by her father, Jawaharlal Nehru.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/> The [[Green Revolution in India]] subsequently culminated under her government in the 1970s. It transformed the country from a nation heavily reliant on imported grains, and prone to famine, to one largely able to feed itself, and becoming successful in achieving its goal of food security. Gandhi had a personal motive in pursuing agricultural self-sufficiency, having found India's dependency on the U.S. for shipments of grains humiliating.<ref>{{cite book|first=Maya|last=Chadda|title=Building Democracy in South Asia|location=London|publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]]|year=2000|page=150|isbn=978-1555878597}}</ref>\n\nThe economic period of 1967\u201375 became significant for its major wave of nationalisation amidst increased regulation of the private sector.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/>\n\nSome other objectives of the economic plan for the period were to provide for the minimum needs of the community through a rural works program and the removal of the privy purses of the nobility.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Both these, and many other goals of the 1967 programme, were accomplished by 1974\u201375.

The main reason was the perceived bias of the United States and [[China]], rivals of the USSR, towards Pakistan. The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and the casting of a veto at the United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Before the war, Gandhi signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. They were unhappy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Gandhi was unhappy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept her from criticising the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Gandhi years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Gandhi, by the early 1980s, the Soviets had become India's largest trading partner.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short-lived liberalisation programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1969. The government targeted growth at 5.7% while stating as its goals, \"growth with stability and progressive achievement of self-reliance.\"{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}}<ref name=\"Gupta\">{{Cite book| publisher = Deep and Deep Publications| page = 7|url={{Googlebooks|8D0iS_EF8_AC|page=PA7|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|isbn=978-8176295598| last = Gupta| first =  K.

This had been her first economic policy formulation, six months after coming to office. The programme emphasised greater state control of the economy with the understanding that government control assured greater welfare than private control.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Related to this point were a set of policies which were meant to regulate the private sector.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} By the end of the 1960s, the reversal of the liberalisation process was complete, and India's policies were characterised as \"protectionist as ever.\"<ref name=\"Kirk\"/>\n\nTo deal with India's food problems, Gandhi expanded the emphasis on production of inputs to agriculture that had already been initiated by her father, Jawaharlal Nehru.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/> The [[Green Revolution in India]] subsequently culminated under her government in the 1970s. It transformed the country from a nation heavily reliant on imported grains, and prone to famine, to one largely able to feed itself, and becoming successful in achieving its goal of food security. Gandhi had a personal motive in pursuing agricultural self-sufficiency, having found India's dependency on the U.S. for shipments of grains humiliating.<ref>{{cite book|first=Maya|last=Chadda|title=Building Democracy in South Asia|location=London|publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]]|year=2000|page=150|isbn=978-1555878597}}</ref>\n\nThe economic period of 1967\u201375 became significant for its major wave of nationalisation amidst increased regulation of the private sector.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/>\n\nSome other objectives of the economic plan for the period were to provide for the minimum needs of the community through a rural works program and the removal of the privy purses of the nobility.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Both these, and many other goals of the 1967 programme, were accomplished by 1974\u201375.

She argued the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The nobility responded by rallying around the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh|Jana Sangh]] and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles, was originally brought before the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] in 1970. It was passed in the [[Lok Sabha]] but felt short of the two-thirds majority in the [[Rajya Sabha]] by a single vote.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} Gandhi responded by having a [[Presidential proclamation]] issued; de-recognizing the princes; with this withdrawal of recognition, their claims to privy purses were also legally lost.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} However, the proclamation was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of India]].{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} In 1971, Gandhi again motioned to abolish the privy purse.

{"title_page": "Relative clause", "text_new": "contains the element whose interpretation is provided by an [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] on which the subordinate clause is grammatically [[dependent (grammar)|dependent]]; that is, there is an [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]] relation between the relativized element in the relative clause and antecedent on which it depends.<ref name=\"HP183\">Rodney D. Huddleston, Geoffrey K. Pullum, ''A Student's Introduction to English Grammar'', CUP 2005, p. 183ff.</ref>\n\nTypically, a relative clause modifies a [[noun]] or [[noun phrase]],<ref name=\"HP183\" /> and uses some grammatical device to indicate that one of the arguments within the relative clause has the same referent as that noun or noun phrase. For example, in the sentence ''I met a man who wasn't there'', the subordinate clause ''who wasn't there'' is a relative clause, since, relative clauses are introduced by a special class of [[pronoun]]s called ''[[relative pronoun]]s'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Kurzov\u00e1 |first=Helena |year=1981 |language=German |title=Der Relativsatz in den indoeurop\u00e4ischen Sprachen |trans-title=Relative Clauses in the Indo-European Languages |series= |location=Hamburg |publisher=Buske |page=117 |isbn=3-87118-458-6 |oclc=63317519}}</ref> such as ''who'' in the example just given. In other languages, relative clauses may be marked in different ways: they may be introduced by a special class of conjunctions called ''[[relativizer]]s''; the main verb of the relative clause may appear in a special morphological variant; or a relative clause may be indicated by word order alone.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lehmann |first=Christian |year=1984 |language=German |title= Der Relativsatz |trans-title=Relative Clauses |series=Language universals series; vol. 3 |location=T\u00fcbingen |publisher=G. Narr |page=438 |isbn=3-87808-982-1 |oclc=14358164}}</ref> In some languages, more than one of these mechanisms may be possible.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Bound and free===\nA '''bound relative clause''', the type most often considered, qualifies an explicit element (usually a [[noun]] or [[noun phrase]]) appearing in the main clause, and refers back to that element by means of some explicit or implicit device within the relative clause.\n\nThe relative clause may also function as an ''embedded clause'' within a main (or higher-level) clause, thereby forming a ''matrix sentence''.<ref name=\"Glossary of Linguistic Terms \">Matrix Sentence, ''http://www.glossary.sil.org/term/matrix-sentencer''</ref> The noun in the main clause that the relative clause modifies is called the ''[[Head (grammar)|head]] noun'', or (particularly when referred back to by a relative pronoun) the ''[[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]]''.\n\nFor example, in the English sentence \"The man whom I saw yesterday went home\", the relative clause \"whom I saw yesterday\" modifies the head noun ''man'', and the relative pronoun ''whom'' refers back to the referent of that noun. The sentence is equivalent to the following two sentences: \"I saw a man yesterday. The man went home.\" The shared argument need not fulfill the same role in both clauses; in this example the same man is referred to by the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the matrix clause, but the [[direct object]] of the relative clause.\n\nA '''free relative clause''', on the other hand, does not have an explicit antecedent external to itself. Instead, the relative clause itself takes the place of an argument in the matrix clause. For example, in the English sentence \"I like what I see\", the clause ''what I see'' is a free relative clause, because it has no antecedent, but itself serves as the [[object (grammar)|object]] of the verb ''like'' in the main clause. (An alternative analysis is that the free relative clause has [[zero (linguistics)|zero]] as its antecedent.)\n\n===Restrictive and non-restrictive===\nBound relative clauses may or may not be [[restrictive]]. Whereas a '''non-restrictive''' or '''non-defining''' relative clause merely provides supplementary information, a '''restrictive''' or '''defining''' relative clause modifies the meaning of its head word (restricts its possible referent).  For example:\n*''The man '''who lives in this house''' has not been seen for days.'' This (''who lives in this house'') is a restrictive relative clause, modifying the meaning of ''man'', and essential to the sentence (if the clause were omitted, it would no longer be known which man is being referred to). If the bold part is deleted the remaining part does not provide the sense.\n*''The mayor, '''who lives in this house''', has not been seen for days.'' This is a non-restrictive relative clause, since it provides supplementary information about the mayor, but is not essential to the sentence \u2013 if the clause were omitted, it would still be known which mayor is meant.  If the bold part is deleted the remaining part provides the sense.\n\nIn speaking it is natural to make slight pauses around non-restrictive clauses, and in English this is shown in writing by [[comma]]s (as in the examples). However many languages do not distinguish the two types of relative clause in this way. Another difference in English is that only restrictive relative clauses may be introduced with ''that'' or use the \"zero\" relative pronoun (see [[English relative clauses]] for details).\n\nIn colloquial speech, a non-restrictive relative clause may have a whole sentence as its antecedent rather than a specific noun phrase; for example:\n*''The cat was allowed on the bed, '''which annoyed the dog'''.''\nHere, the context of the sentence (presumably) indicates that ''which'' refers not to the bed or the cat but to the entire [[proposition]] expressed in the main clause, namely the circumstance that the cat was allowed on the bed. Such constructions are discouraged in formal usage and in texts written for nonnative speakers because of the potential for [[syntactic ambiguity|ambiguity]] in parsing; a construction more accepted in formal usage would be ''The cat's being ''[or ''having been''] ''allowed on the bed annoyed the dog.''\n\n===Finite and non-finite===\nRelative clauses may be either finite clauses (as in the examples above) or [[non-finite clause]]s. An example of a non-finite relative clause in English is the [[infinitive clause]] ''on whom to rely'', in the sentence \"She is the person on whom to rely\".\n\n==Formation methods==\nLanguages differ in many ways in how relative clauses are expressed:\n#How the role of the shared noun phrase is indicated in the embedded clause.\n#How the two clauses are joined together.\n#Where the embedded clause is placed relative to the head noun (in the process indicating which noun phrase in the main clause is modified).\n\nFor example, the English sentence \"The man that I saw yesterday went home\" can be described as follows:\n#The role of the shared noun in the embedded clause is indicated by ''gapping''; that is, a gap is left in the object position after \"saw\", implying that the shared noun phrase (\"the man\") is to be understood to fill that gap and to serve as the object of the verb \"saw\".\n#The clauses are joined by the ''complementizer'' \"that\".\n#The embedded clause is placed ''after'' the head noun \"the man\".\n\nThe following sentences indicate various possibilities (only some of which are grammatical in English):\n*\"The man [that I saw yesterday] went home\". (A ''complementizer'' linking the two clauses with a ''gapping'' strategy indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause. One possibility in English. Very common cross-linguistically.)\n*\"The man [I saw yesterday] went home\". (Gapping strategy, with no word joining the clauses&mdash;also known as a [[reduced relative clause]]. One possibility in English. Used in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] when the head noun is [[definiteness|indefinite]], as in \"a man\" instead of \"the man\".)\n*\"The man [whom I saw yesterday] went home\". (A [[relative pronoun]] indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause\u2014in this case, the direct object. Used in formal English, as in [[Latin]], [[German language|German]] or [[Russian language|Russian]].)\n*\"The man [seen by me yesterday] went home\". (A [[reduced relative clause]], in this case [[passive voice|passivized]]. One possibility in English.)\n*\"The man [that I saw him yesterday] went home\". (A complementizer linking the two sentences with a [[resumptive pronoun]] indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause, as in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Persian language|Persian]].)\n*\"The man [that him I saw yesterday] went home\". (Similar to the previous, but with the resumptive pronoun fronted. This occurs in modern [[Greek language|Greek]] and as one possibility in modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; the combination ''that him'' of complementizer and resumptive pronoun behaves similar to a unitary relative pronoun.)\n*\"The [I saw yesterday]'s man went home\". (Preceding relative clause with gapping and use of a possessive particle\u2014as normally used in a [[genitive construction]]\u2014to link the relative clause to the head noun. This occurs in many Sino-Tibetan languages and possibly developed from \"relative clause + noun\" > \"nominalized clause + noun\" > \"genitive construction\".<ref>http://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files/publication/j2008_4_03_2641.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files/publication/j2008_4_05_5653.pdf</ref>)\n*\"The [I saw yesterday] man went home\". (Preceding relative clause with gapping and no linking word, as in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] or [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]].)\n*\"The man [of my seeing yesterday] went home\". ([[Nominalization|Nominalized]] relative clause, as in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].)\n*\"[Which man I saw yesterday], that man went home\". (A ''correlative'' structure, as in [[Hindi]].)\n*\"[I saw the man yesterday] went home.\" (An ''unreduced, internally headed'' relative clause, as in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] or [[Navajo language|Navajo]].)\n\n===Strategies for indicating the role of the shared noun in the relative clause===\nThere are four main strategies for indicating the role of the shared noun phrase in the embedded clause. These are typically listed in order of the degree to which the noun in the relative clause has been reduced, from most to least:\n\n# Gap strategy or gapped relative clause\n# Relative pronoun\n# Pronoun retention\n# Nonreduction\n\n====Gapped relative clause====\nIn this strategy, there is simply a gap in the relative clause where the shared noun would go. This is normal in English, for example, and also in Chinese and Japanese. This is the most common type of relative clause, especially in [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb|verb-final]] languages with prenominal relative clauses, but is also widespread among languages with postnominal externally headed relative clauses.\n\nThere may or may not be any marker used to join the relative and main clauses. (Languages with a case-marked relative pronoun are technically not considered to employ the gapping strategy even though they do in fact have a gap, since the case of the relative pronoun indicates the role of the shared noun.) Often the form of the verb is different from that in main clauses and is to some degree nominalized, as in Turkish and in English [[reduced relative clause]]s.<ref>{{cite book | last=Carrol | first=David W | edition=5 | title=Psychology of Language | publisher=Thomson & Wadsworth | location=Belmont | year=2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Townsend | first=David J |author2=Thomas G Bever  | title=Sentence Comprehension: The Integration of Habits and Rules | year=2001 | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge | pages=247&ndash;9}}</ref>\n\nIn non-verb-final languages, apart from languages like [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] with very strong politeness distinctions in their grammars{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}, gapped relative clauses tend, however, to be restricted to positions high up in the accessibility hierarchy. With obliques and genitives, non-verb-final languages that do not have politeness restrictions on pronoun use tend to use pronoun retention. English is unusual in that ''all'' roles in the embedded clause can be indicated by gapping: e.g. \"I saw the man who is my friend\", but also (in progressively less accessible positions cross-linguistically, according to the ''[[accessibility hierarchy]]'' described below) \"...&nbsp;who I know\", \"...&nbsp;who I gave a book to\", \"...&nbsp;who I spoke with\", \"...&nbsp;who I run slower than\". Usually, languages with gapping disallow it beyond a certain level in the accessibility hierarchy, and switch to a different strategy at this point. [[Classical Arabic]], for example, only allows gapping in the subject and sometimes the direct object; beyond that, a resumptive pronoun must be used. Some languages have no allowed strategies at all past a certain point\u2014e.g. in many [[Austronesian languages]], such as [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], all relative clauses must have the shared noun serving the subject role in the embedded clause. In these languages, relative clauses with shared nouns serving \"disallowed\" roles can be expressed by [[passive voice|passivizing]] the embedded sentence, thereby moving the noun in the embedded sentence into the subject position. This, for example, would transform \"The man who I gave a book to\" into \"The man who was given a book by me\". Generally, languages such as this \"conspire\" to implement general relativization by allowing passivization from ''all'' positions \u2014 hence a sentence equivalent to \"The man who is run slower than by me\" is grammatical. Gapping is often used in conjunction with case-marked relative pronouns (since the relative pronoun indicates the case role in the embedded clause), but this is not necessary (e.g. Chinese and Japanese both using gapping in conjunction with an indeclinable complementizer).\n\n====Relative pronoun type====\nThis is in fact a type of gapped relative clause, but is distinguished by the fact that the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause is indicated indirectly by the case marking of the marker (the [[relative pronoun]]) used to join the main and embedded clauses. All languages which use relative pronouns have them in clause-initial position: though one could conceivably imagine a clause-final relative pronoun analogous to an adverbial subordinator in that position, they are unknown.\n\nSome languages have what are described as \"relative pronouns\" (in that they agree with some properties of the head noun, such as number and gender) but which do not actually indicate the case role of the shared noun in the embedded clause. [[Classical Arabic]] in fact has \"relative pronouns\" which are case-marked, but which agree in case with the ''head'' noun. Case-marked relative pronouns in the strict sense are almost entirely confined to [[Standard Average European|European languages]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, where they are widespread except among the [[Celtic languages|Celtic family]] and [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan family]]. The influence of Spanish has led to their adaption by a very small number of [[indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]], of which the best-known are the [[Keresan languages]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_aco|title=WALS Online - Language Acoma|author=|date=|website=wals.info|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Pronoun retention type====\nIn this type, the position relativized is indicated by means of a [[personal pronoun]] in the same syntactic position as would ordinarily be occupied by a noun phrase of that type in the main clause\u2014known as a ''[[resumptive pronoun]]''. It is equivalent to saying \"The man who I saw <u>him</u> yesterday went home\". Pronoun retention is very frequently used for relativization of inaccessible positions on the accessibility hierarchy. In [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Classical Arabic]], for example, resumptive pronouns are required when the embedded role is other than the subject or direct object, and optional in the case of the direct object. Resumptive pronouns are common in non-verb-final [[languages of Africa]] and Asia, and also used by the Celtic languages of northwest Europe and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (\"Omul pe care <u>l</u>-am v\u0103zut ieri a mers acas\u0103\"/\"The man who I saw <u>him</u> yesterday went home\"). They also occur in deeply embedded positions in English, as in \"That's the girl that I don't know what <u>she</u> did\",<ref name=\"mckee\">{{citation|title=Resumptive Pronouns in English Relative Clauses|first1=Cecile|last1=McKee|first2=Dana|last2=McDaniel|journal=Language Acquisition|volume=9|number=2|year=2001|pages=113\u2013156|doi=10.1207/s15327817la0902_01}}.</ref> although this is sometimes considered non-standard.\n\nOnly a very small number of languages, of which the best known is [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], have pronoun retention as their sole grammatical type of relative clause.\n\n====Nonreduction type====\nIn the nonreduction type, unlike the other three, the shared noun occurs as a ''full-fledged noun phrase'' in the embedded clause, which has the form of a full independent clause. Typically, it is the head noun in the main clause that is reduced or missing. Some languages use relative clauses of this type with the normal strategy of embedding the relative clause next to the head noun. These languages are said to have ''internally headed'' relative clauses, which would be similar to the (ungrammatical) English structure \"[You see the girl over there] is my friend\" or \"I took [you see the girl over there] out on a date\". This is used, for example, in [[Navajo language|Navajo]], which uses a special relative verb (as with some other Native American languages).\n\nA second strategy is the ''correlative''-clause strategy used by [[Hindi]] and other [[Indo-Aryan languages]], as well as [[Bambara language|Bambara]]. This strategy is equivalent to saying \"Which girl you see over there, she is my daughter\" or \"Which knife I killed my friend with, the police found that knife\". It is \"correlative\" because of the corresponding \"which ... that ...\" demonstratives or \"which ... she/he/it ...\" pronouns, which indicate the respective nouns being equated. The shared noun can either be repeated entirely in the main clause or reduced to a pronoun. There is no need to front the shared noun in such a sentence. For example, in the second example above, Hindi would actually say something equivalent to \"I killed my friend with which knife, the police found that knife\".\n\nDialects of some European languages, such as Italian, do use the nonreduction type in forms that could be glossed in English as \"The man just passed us by, he introduced me to the chancellor here.\"\n\nIn general, however, nonreduction is restricted to verb-final languages, though it is more common among those that are [[head-marking language|head-marking]].\n\n===Strategies for joining the relative clause to the main clause===\nThe following are some of the common strategies for joining the two clauses:\n*Use of an indeclinable particle (specifically, a [[relativizer]]) inserted into the sentence, placed next to the modified noun; the embedded clause is likewise inserted into the appropriate position, typically placed on the other side of the complementizer. This strategy is very common and arguably occurs in English with the word ''that'' (\"the man that I saw\"), though this interpretation of \"that\" as something other than a relative pronoun is controversial (see [[#English|below]]). In the modern [[varieties of Arabic]] (using ''illi'' placed after the modified noun); in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (using ''de'' placed before the modified noun).\n*Use of a [[relative pronoun]]. Prototypically, a relative pronoun agrees with the head noun in gender, number, definiteness, animacy, etc., but adopts the [[grammatical case|case]] that the shared noun assumes in the ''embedded'', not matrix, clause. This is the case in a number of conservative European languages, such as [[Latin]], [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Many languages also have similar linking words commonly termed \"relative pronouns\" that agree in some way with the head noun, but do not adopt the case role of the embedded clause. In English, for example, the use of ''who'' vs. ''which'' agrees with the animacy of the head noun, but there is no case agreement except in the formal English contrast ''who'' vs. ''whom'' (which is often used incorrectly, if at all, in speech). Similarly, in [[Classical Arabic]], there is a relative pronoun that agrees in number, gender, [[definiteness]] ''and'' case with the head noun (rather than taking the case role of the noun in the embedded clause). Languages with prototypical relative pronouns typically use the gapping strategy for indicating the role in the embedded clause, since the relative pronoun itself indicates the role by its case. ([[Classical Arabic]], where the case marking indicates something else, uses a [[resumptive pronoun]].) Some linguists prefer to use the term ''relative pronoun'' only for the prototypical cases (but in this case it's unclear what to call the non-prototypical cases).\n*Directly inserting the embedded clause in the matrix clause at the appropriate position, with no word used to join them. This is common, for example, in English (cf. \"The man I saw yesterday went home\"), and is used in [[Classical Arabic]] in relative clauses that modify indefinite nouns.\n*By [[nominalization|nominalizing]] the relative clause (e.g. converting it to a participial construction). Generally, no relative pronoun or complementizer is used. This occurs, for example, in [[reduced relative clause]]s in English (e.g. \"The man seen by me yesterday went home\" or \"The man planning to go home soon is my friend\"). Formal German makes common use of such participial relative clauses, which can become extremely long. This is also the normal strategy in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], which has sentences equivalent to \"I ate the potato of Hasan's giving to Sina\" (in place of \"I ate the potato that Hasan gave to Sina\"). This can be viewed as a situation in which the \"complementizer\" is attached to the verb of the embedded clause (e.g. in English, \"-ing\" or \"-ed\" can be viewed as a type of complementizer).\n\n===Position of the head noun with respect to the relative clause===\nThe positioning of a relative clause before or after a head noun is related to the more general concept of [[Branching (linguistics)|branching]] in linguistics. Languages that place relative clauses after their head noun (so-called ''head-initial'' or ''VO'' languages) generally also have adjectives and [[genitive construction|genitive modifier]]s following the head noun, as well as verbs preceding their objects. [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are prototypical languages of this sort. Languages that place relative clauses before their head noun (so-called ''head-final'' or ''OV'' languages) generally also have adjectives and [[genitive construction|genitive modifier]]s preceding the head noun, as well as verbs following their objects. [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] are prototypical languages of this sort. Not all languages fit so easily into these categories. English, for example, is generally head-first, but has adjectives preceding their head nouns, and [[genitive construction]]s with both preceding and following modifiers (\"the friend of my father\" vs. \"my father's friend\"). [[Chinese language|Chinese]] has the ''VO'' order, with verb preceding object, but otherwise is generally head-final.\n\nVarious possibilities for ordering are:\n*Relative clause following the head noun, as in English, [[French language|French]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]].\n*Relative clause preceding the head noun, as in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], or [[Chinese language|Chinese]].\n*Head noun ''within'' the relative clause (an ''internally headed'' relative clause). An example of such a language is [[Navajo language|Navajo]]. These languages are said to have [[#Nonreduction type|nonreduced]] relative clauses. These languages have a structure equivalent to \"[I saw the man yesterday] went home\".\n*Adjoined relative clause. These languages have the relative clause completely outside the main clause, and use a correlative structure to link the two. These languages also have [[#Nonreduction type|nonreduced]] relative clauses. [[Hindi]] is the most well known such language, and have a structure similar to \"Which man I saw yesterday, that man went home\" or (with non-fronting of the relativized noun in the relative clause) \"I saw which man yesterday, that man went home\". Another example is [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]], which constructs relative clauses of a form similar to \"I saw the man yesterday, which he was going home\". However, it is sometimes said these languages have no relative clauses at all, since the sentences of this form can equally well translate as  \"I saw the man who was going home yesterday\" or \"I saw the man yesterday when/while he was going home\".\n\n==Accessibility hierarchy==\nThe antecedent of the relative clause (that is, the noun that is modified by it) can in theory be the subject of the main clause, or its object, or any other [[verb argument]]. In many languages, however, especially rigidly [[left-branching]], [[dependent-marking language]]s with prenominal relative clauses,<ref>Lehmann, Christian (1986). On the typology of relative clauses. ''Linguistics'', 24(4), 663-680. {{doi|10.1515/ling.1986.24.4.663}}</ref> there are major restrictions on the role the antecedent may have ''in the relative clause''.\n\n[[Edward Keenan]] and [[Bernard Comrie]] noted that these roles can be ranked cross-linguistically in the following order from most accessible to least accessible:<ref>Keenan, Edward L. & Comrie, Bernard (1977). Noun phrase accessibility and Universal Grammar, [[Linguistic Inquiry]], 8(1), 63-99</ref><ref>Comrie, Bernard; ''Language Universals and Linguistic Typology''; pp. 156-163; {{ISBN|0-226-11434-1}}</ref>\n\n:Subject  > Direct Object  > Indirect Object  > Oblique  > Genitive  > Object of comparative\n\n[[Ergative\u2013absolutive]] languages have a similar hierarchy:\n\n:[[Absolutive case|Absolutive]] > [[Ergative case|Ergative]] > Indirect Object > etc. (same as above)\n\nThis order is called the '''accessibility hierarchy'''. If a language can relativize positions lower in the accessibility hierarchy, it can always relativize positions higher up, but not vice versa. For example, [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] can relativize only subject and [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]] only absolutive arguments, whilst [[Basque language|Basque]] can relativize absolutives, ergatives and indirect objects, but not obliques or genitives or objects of comparatives. Similar hierarchies have been proposed in other circumstances, e.g. for pronominal reflexes.\n\n[[English language|English]] can relativize all positions in the hierarchy. Here are some examples of the NP and relative clause usage from English:\n\n{| align=\"center\"\n!Position !! With explicit relative pronoun !! With omitted relative pronoun !! In formal English\n|-\n|[[subject (grammar)|Subject]] || That's the man [who ran away]. || \u2014 || That's the man [who ran away].\n|-\n|[[Direct object]] || That's the man [who I saw yesterday]. || That's the man [I saw yesterday]. || That's the man [whom I saw yesterday].\n|-\n|[[Indirect object]] || That's the man [who I gave the letter to]. || That's the man [I gave the letter to]. || That's the man [to whom I gave the letter]. \n|-\n|[[oblique case|Oblique]] || That's the man [who I was talking about].  || That's the man [I was talking about]. || That's the man [about whom I was talking]. \n|-\n|[[Genitive]] || That's the man [whose sister I know].\t       || \u2014 ||  That's the man [whose sister I know].\n|-\n|Obj of Comp || That's the man [who I am taller than].\t\t       || That's the man [I am taller than]. || That's the man [than whom I am taller].\n|}\n\nSome other examples:\n\n{| align=\"center\"\n!Position !! Example\n|-\n|[[subject (grammar)|Subject]] || The girl [who came late] is my sister.\n|-\n|[[Direct object]]  || I gave a rose to the girl [that Kate saw].\n|-\n|[[Indirect object]] || John knows the girl [I wrote a letter to].\n|-\n|[[oblique case|Oblique]] || I found the rock [which the robbers had hit John over the head with].\n|-\n|[[Genitive]] || The girl [whose father died] told me she was sad.\n|-\n|Obj of Comp || The first person [I can't run faster than] will win a million dollars.\n|}\n\nLanguages that cannot relativize directly on noun phrases low in the accessibility hierarchy can sometimes use alternative [[grammatical voice|voices]] to \"raise\" the relevant noun phrase so that it can be relativized. The most common example is the use of [[applicative voice]]s to relativize obliques, but in such languages as Chukchi [[antipassive voice|antipassives]] are used to raise ergative arguments to absolutive.\n\nFor example, a language that can relativize only subjects could say this:\n*The girl [who likes me] came to visit.\nBut not:\n*The girl [whom I like] came to visit.\n*The girl [whom I gave a rose to] came to visit.\n*The girl [whom I watched a movie with] came to visit.\n*The girl [whose father I know] came to visit.\n*The girl [whom I know the father of] came to visit. (''equivalent to previous'')\n*The girl [whom I am taller than] came to visit.\nThese languages might form an equivalent sentence by [[passive voice|passivization]]:\n*The girl [who was liked by me] came to visit.\n*The girl [who was given a rose by me] came to visit.\n*The girl [who was watched a movie with by me] came to visit.\n*The girl [who was known the father of by me] came to visit.\n*The girl [who was been taller than by me] came to visit.\nThese passivized sentences get progressively more ungrammatical in English as they move down the accessibility hierarchy; the last two, in particular, are so ungrammatical as to be almost unparsable by English speakers. But languages with severe restrictions on which roles can be relativized are precisely those that can passivize almost any position, and hence the last two sentences would be normal in those languages.\n\nA further example is languages that can relativize only subjects and direct objects. Hence the following would be possible:\n*The girl [who I like] came to visit.\nThe other ungrammatical examples above would still be ungrammatical. These languages often allow an oblique object to be moved to the direct object slot by the use of the so-called ''[[applicative voice]]'', much as the [[passive voice]] moves an oblique object to the subject position. The above examples expressed in an applicative voice might be similar to the following (in not necessarily grammatical English):\n*The girl [who I gave a rose] came to visit.\n*The girl [who I with-watched a movie] came to visit.\n*The girl [who I (of-)know the father] came to visit.\n*The girl [who I out-tall] came to visit.\n\nModern grammars may use the accessibility hierarchy to order productions\u2014e.g. in [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]] the hierarchy corresponds to the order of elements on the ''subcat'' list, and interacts with other principles in explanations of binding facts. The hierarchy also figures in\n[[Lexical Functional Grammar]], where it is known as Syntactic Rank or the Relational Hierarchy.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Indo-European languages===\n\n====English====\n{{main|English relative clauses}}\nIn English, a relative clause follows the noun it modifies. It is generally indicated by a relative pronoun at the start of the clause, although sometimes simply by word order. If the relative pronoun is the object of the verb in the relative clause, it comes at the beginning of the clause even though it would come at the end of an independent clause (\"He is the man ''whom'' I saw\", not \"He is the man I saw ''whom''\").\n\nThe choice of relative pronoun can be affected by whether the clause modifies a human or non-human noun, by whether the clause is restrictive or not,<ref>{{cite book |last=Kordi\u0107 |first=Snje\u017eana |authorlink=Snje\u017eana Kordi\u0107 |editor1-last=Suprun |editor1-first=Adam E |url-status=live |editor2-last=Jachnow |editor2-first=Helmut |title=Slavjano-germanskie jazykovye paralleli/Slawisch-germanische Sprachparallelen |series=Sovmestnyj issledovatel'skij sbornik slavistov universitetov v Minske i Bochume |publisher=Belorusskij gosudarstvennyj universitet |page=165 |language=German |chapter=Pronomina im Antezedenten und Restriktivit\u00e4t/Nicht-Restriktivit\u00e4t von Relativs\u00e4tzen im Kroatoserbischen und Deutschen |trans-chapter=Pronouns in antecedents and restrictive / non-restrictive relative clauses in Serbo-Croatian and German |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/426662.PRONOMINA_IM_ANTEZEDENT.PDF |location=Minsk |year=1996 |oclc=637166830 |ssrn=3434472 |id={{CROSBI|426662}} |archivedate=29 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AHPw0DET |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref> and by the role (subject, direct object, or the like) of the relative pronoun in the relative clause.\n\n*For a human antecedent, \"who\", \"whom\", or \"that\" is usually used (\"He is the person ''who'' saw me\", \"He is the person ''whom'' I saw\", \"He is the person ''that'' I saw\"). For a non-human antecedent, only \"that\" or \"which\" is used.\n*For a non-human antecedent in a non-restrictive clause, only \"which\" is used (\"The tree, ''which'' fell, is over there\"); while either \"which\" or \"that\" may be used in a restrictive clause (\"The tree ''which'' fell is over there\", \"The tree ''that'' fell is over there\"){{mdash}}but some styles and prescriptive grammars require the use of \"that\" in the restrictive context.\n*Of the relative pronoun pair \"who\" and \"whom\", the ''subjective'' case form (\"who\") is used if it is the subject of the relative clause (\"He is the policeman who saw me\"); and, in formal usage, the ''objective'' case form (\"whom\") if it is the object of the verb or preposition in the relative clause (\"He is the policeman whom I saw\", \"He is the policeman whom I talked to\", \"He is the policeman to whom I talked\"); but in informal usage \"whom\" is often replaced by \"who\".\n\nIn English, as in some other languages (such as French; see below), [[restrictiveness|non-restrictive]] relative clauses are set off with commas, but restrictive ones are not:\n\n*\"I met a man and a woman yesterday. The woman, ''who had a thick French accent'', was very pretty.\" (non-restrictive\u2014does not narrow down who is being talked about)\n*\"I met two women yesterday, one with a thick French accent and one with a mild Italian one. The woman ''who had the thick French accent'' was very pretty.\" (restrictive\u2014adds information about who is being referred to)\n\nThe status of \"that\" as a relative pronoun is not universally agreed. Traditional grammars treat \"that\" as a relative pronoun, but not all contemporary grammars do: e.g. the [[Cambridge Grammar of the English Language]] (pp.&nbsp;1056\u20137) makes a case for treating \"that\" as a subordinator instead of a relative pronoun; and the [[British National Corpus]] treats \"that\" as a subordinating conjunction even when it introduces relative clauses. One motivation for the different treatment of \"that\" is that there are differences between \"that\" and \"which\" (e.g., one can say \"in which\" but not \"in that\", etc.).\n\n====French====\nThe system of relative pronouns in [[French language|French]] is as complicated as, but similar in many ways to, the system in English.\n\nWhen the pronoun is to act as the direct object of the relative clause, ''{{lang|fr|que}}'' is generally used, although ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'', which is inflected for grammatical gender and number, is sometimes used in order to give more precision. For example, any of the following is correct and would translate to \"I talked to his/her father and mother, whom I already knew\":\n\n:''{{lang|fr|J'ai parl\u00e9 avec son p\u00e8re et sa m\u00e8re, '''laquelle''' (f. sing.) je connaissais d\u00e9j\u00e0.}}''\n:''{{lang|fr|J'ai parl\u00e9 avec son p\u00e8re et sa m\u00e8re, '''lesquels''' (m. pl.) je connaissais d\u00e9j\u00e0.}}''\n:''{{lang|fr|J'ai parl\u00e9 avec son p\u00e8re et sa m\u00e8re, '''que''' je connaissais d\u00e9j\u00e0.}}''\n\nHowever, in the first sentence, \"whom I already knew\" refers only to the mother; in the second, it refers to both parents; and in the third, as in the English sentence, it could refer either only to the mother, or to both parents.\n\nWhen the pronoun is to act as the subject of the relative clause, ''{{lang|fr|qui}}'' is generally used, though as before, ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' may be used instead for greater precision. (This is less common than the use of ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' with direct objects, however, since verbs in French often reflect the grammatical number of their subjects.)\n\nContrary to English, the relative pronoun can never be omitted in French, not even when the relative clause is embedded in another relative clause.\n:Here is what I think '''\u00d8''' happened.\n:''{{lang|fr|Voil\u00e0 ce que je crois '''qui''' est arriv\u00e9.}}'' (literally: \"Here is what I think '''that''' happened.\")\n\nWhen the pronoun is to act in a possessive sense, where the preposition ''de'' (of/from) would normally be used, the pronoun ''{{lang|fr|dont}}'' (\"whose\") is used, but does not act as a [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]] for the noun \"possessed\":\n\n:''{{lang|fr|J'ai parl\u00e9 avec une femme '''dont''' le fils est mon coll\u00e8gue.}}'' (\"I spoke with a woman whose son I work with.\" - ''lit.'', \"I spoke with a woman ''of whom'' the son is my colleague.\")\n\nThis construction is also used in non-possessive cases where the pronoun replaces an object marked by ''{{lang|fr|de}}'':\n\n:''{{lang|fr|C'est l'homme '''dont''' j'ai parl\u00e9.}}'' (\"That's the man '''of whom''' I spoke.\")\n\nMore generally, in modern French, ''{{lang|fr|dont}}'' can signal the topic of the following clause, without replacing anything in this clause:\n\n:''{{lang|fr|C'est un homme '''dont''' je crois qu'il doit tr\u00e8s bien gagner sa vie.}}'' (\"That's a man '''about whom''' I believe that he must make a lot of money.\")\n\nWhen the pronoun is to act as the object of a preposition (other than when ''{{lang|fr|dont}}'' is used), ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' is generally used, though ''{{lang|fr|qui}}'' can be used if the antecedent is human.\n\n:''{{lang|fr|Ce sont des gens '''sur lesquels''' on peut compter.}}'' (\"These are people '''that''' can be depended '''on'''.\") [literally: \"'''on whom''' one can depend\"]\n:''{{lang|fr|Ce sont des gens '''sur qui''' on peut compter.}}''\n\n:''{{lang|fr|C'est une table '''sur laquelle''' on peut mettre beaucoup de choses.}}'' (\"This is a table '''on which''' you can put a lot of things\")\n:<nowiki>*</nowiki>''C'est une table sur qui on peut mettre beaucoup de choses.''\n\nThere exists a further complication when the antecedent is a non-human indefinite pronoun. In that case, ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' cannot be used because it must agree in gender with its head, and an indefinite pronoun has no gender. Instead, ''{{lang|fr|quoi}}'', which usually means \"what\", is used.\n:''{{lang|fr|C'est manifestement <u>quelque chose</u> '''\u00e0 quoi''' il a beaucoup r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi.}}'' (\"This is obviously <u>something</u> '''that '''he has thought a lot '''about '''.\")\n:<nowiki>*</nowiki>''C'est manifestement quelque chose \u00e0 laquelle il a beaucoup r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi.''\n\nThe same happens when the antecedent is an entire clause, also lacking gender.\n:''{{lang|fr|Il m'a dit d'aller me faire voir, '''\u00e0 quoi''' j'ai r\u00e9pondu que...}}'' (\"He told me to get lost, '''to which''' I replied that ...\")\n\nThe preposition always appears before the pronoun, and the prepositions ''{{lang|fr|de}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|\u00e0}}'' (at/to) contract with ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' to form ''{{lang|fr|duquel}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|auquel}}'', or with ''{{lang|fr|lesquel(le)s}}'' to form ''{{lang|fr|desquel(le)s}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|auxquel(le)s}}''.\n\n====German====\n[[File:Intonation of German restrictive relative clauses.jpg|thumb|350px|right|[[Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation]] of [[German language|German]] [[#Restrictive and non-restrictive|restrictive relative clauses]]]]Aside from their highly inflected forms, [[German language|German]] relative pronouns are less complicated than English. There are two varieties. The more common one is based on the definite article ''der'', ''die'', ''das'', but with distinctive forms in the genitive (''dessen'', ''deren'') and in the dative plural (''denen''). Historically this is related to English ''that''. The second, which is more literary and used for emphasis, is the relative use of ''welcher'', ''welche'', ''welches'', comparable with English ''which''. As in most Germanic languages, including Old English, both of these varieties inflect according to gender, case and number. They take their gender and number from the noun which they modify, but the case from their function in their own clause.\n\n:''Das Haus, in dem ich wohne, ist sehr alt.''\n::The house in which I live is very old.\n\nThe relative pronoun ''dem'' is neuter singular to agree with ''Haus'', but dative because it follows a preposition in its own clause. On the same basis, it would be possible to substitute the pronoun ''welchem''.\n\nHowever, German uses the uninflecting ''was'' ('what') as a relative pronoun when the antecedent is ''alles'', ''etwas'' or ''nichts'' ('everything', 'something', 'nothing'.).\n\n:''Alles, was Jack macht, gelingt ihm.''\n::Everything that Jack does is a success.\n\nIn German, all relative clauses are marked with commas.\n\nAlternatively, particularly in formal registers, participles (both active and passive) can be used to embed relative clauses in adjectival phrases:\n\n:''Die von ihm in jenem Stil gemalten Bilder sind sehr begehrt''\n::The pictures he painted in that style are highly sought after\n:''Die Regierung m\u00f6chte diese im letzten Jahr eher langsam wachsende Industrie weiter f\u00f6rdern''\n::The government would like to further promote this industry, which has grown rather slowly over the last year\n\nUnlike English, which only permits relatively small participle phrases in adjectival positions (typically just the participle and adverbs), and disallows the use of direct objects for active participles, German sentences of this sort can embed clauses of arbitrary complexity.\n\n====Spanish====\nSee [[Spanish pronouns#Relative pronouns|Relative pronouns]] in the Spanish pronouns article.\n\n====Latin====\nIn [[Latin]], relative clauses follow the noun phrases they modify, and are always introduced using relative pronouns. Relative pronouns, like other pronouns in Latin, agree with their antecedents in [[grammatical gender|gender]] and [[grammatical number|number]], but not in [[grammatical case|case]]: a relative pronoun's case reflects its role in the relative clause it introduces, while its antecedent's case reflects the antecedent's role in the clause that contains the relative clause. (Nonetheless, it is possible for the pronoun and antecedent to be in the same case.) For example:\n\n:'''''Urb\u0113s''', '''quae''' sunt magnae, videntur. (''The '''cities''', '''which''' are large, are being seen.'')\n:'''''Urb\u0113s''', '''qu\u0101s''' v\u012bd\u012b, erant magnae.'' (''The '''cities''', '''which''' I saw, were large.'')\n\nIn the former example, ''urb\u0113s'' and ''quae'' both function as [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] in their respective clauses, so both are in the nominative case; and due to gender and [[number agreement]], both are feminine and plural. In the latter example, both are still feminine and plural, and ''urb\u0113s'' is still in the nominative case, but ''quae'' has been replaced by ''qu\u0101s'', its accusative-case counterpart, to reflect its role as the [[direct object]] of ''v\u012bd\u012b''.\n\nFor more information on the forms of Latin relative pronouns, ''see'' [[Latin declension#Relative pronouns|the section on relative pronouns in the article on Latin declension]].\n\n====Ancient Greek====\n[[Ancient Greek]] follows the same rule as Latin.\n\n*\u03b1\u1f31 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, \u1f03\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd, \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c3\u03af\u03bd.\n:hai p\u00f3leis, h\u00e0s e\u00eedon, meg\u00e1lai eisin.\n:The cities that I saw are large.\n\nThe Ancient Greek relative pronoun \u1f45\u03c2, \u1f25, \u1f45 (''h\u00f3s, h\u0113&#769;, h\u00f3'') is unrelated to the Latin word, since it derives from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] {{PIE|*yos}}: in [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]], ''y'' before a vowel usually changed to ''h'' ([[debuccalization]]). [[Cognate]]s include [[Sanskrit]] relative pronouns ''yas, y\u0101, yad'' (where ''o'' changed to short ''a'').<ref>{{LSJ|o(/s1|\u1f45\u03c2|ref}}</ref>\n\nThe Greek definite article \u1f41, \u1f21, \u03c4\u03cc (''ho, h\u0113, t\u00f3'') has a different origin, since it is related to the Sanskrit demonstrative ''sa, s\u0101'' and [[Latin]] ''is-tud''.<ref>{{LSJ|o(1|\u1f41|shortref}}</ref>\n\nInformation that in English would be encoded with relative clauses could be represented with complex participles in Ancient Greek.

A direct relative clause is used where the relativized element is the subject or the direct object of its clause (e.g. \"the man ''who'' saw me\", \"the man ''whom'' I saw\"), while an indirect relative clause is used where the relativized element is a genitival (e.g. \"the man ''whose'' daughter is in the hospital\") or is the object of a preposition (e.g. \"the man ''to whom'' I gave the book\"). Direct relative clauses are formed with a [[relative pronoun]] (unmarked for case) at the beginning; a gap (in terms of syntactic theory, a [[trace (linguistics)|trace]], indicated by (''t)'' in the examples below) is left in the relative clause at the pronoun's expected position.\n\n;Irish\n{|\n| an || fear || a || chonaic || (''t)'' || m\u00e9\n|-\n| the || man || DIR-REL || saw || || me\n|-\n| colspan=6 | \"the man who saw me\"\n|}\n;Welsh\n{|\n| y || dyn || a || welais\n|-\n| the || man || DIR-REL || I saw\n|-\n| colspan=4 | \"the man whom I saw\"\n|}\n\nThe direct relative particle \"a\" is not used with \"mae\" (\"is\") in Welsh; instead the form \"sydd\" or \"sy'\" is used:\n\n{|\n| y || dyn || sy'n || blewog || iawn\n|-\n| the || man || DIR-REL + is || hairy || very \n|-\n| colspan=5 | \"the man who is very hairy\"\n|}\n\nThere is also a defective verb \"piau\" (usually lenited to \"biau\"), corresponding to \"who own(s)\":\n\n{|\n| y || dyn || piau || castell || anferth\n|-\n| the || man || DIR-REL + owns || castle || huge \n|-\n| colspan=5 | \"the man who owns a huge castle\"\n|}\n\nIndirect relative clauses are formed with a [[relativizer]] at the beginning; the relativized element remains ''in situ'' in the relative clause.\n\n;Irish\n{|\n| an || fear || a || bhfuil || a || in\u00edon || san || ospid\u00e9al\n|-\n| the || man || IND-REL || is || his || daughter || in the || hospital\n|-\n| colspan=8 | \"the man whose daughter is in the hospital\"\n|}\n;Welsh\n{|\n| y || dyn || y || rhois || y || llyfr || iddo\n|-\n| the || man || IND-REL || I gave || the || book || to him\n|-\n| colspan=7 | \"the man to whom I gave the book\"\n|}\n\nAlthough both the Irish relative pronoun and the relativizer are 'a', the relative pronoun triggers lenition of a following consonant, while the relativizer triggers eclipsis (see [[Irish initial mutations]]).\n\nBoth direct and indirect relative particles can be used simply for emphasis, often in answer to a question or as a way of disagreeing with a statement. For instance, the Welsh example above, \"y dyn a welais\" means not only \"the man whom I saw\", but also \"it was the man (and not anyone else) I saw\"; and \"y dyn y rhois y llyfr iddo\" can likewise mean \"it was the man (and not anyone else) to whom I gave the book\".\n\n===Semitic languages===\n\n====Hebrew====\nIn [[Biblical Hebrew language|Biblical Hebrew]], relative clauses were headed with the word ''asher'', which could be either a [[relative pronoun]] or a [[relativizer]]. In later times, ''asher'' became interchangeable with the prefix ''she-'' (which is also used as a conjunction, with the sense of English ''that''), and in [[Modern Hebrew language|Modern Hebrew]], this use of ''she-'' is much more common than ''asher'', except in some formal, archaic, or poetic writing. In meaning, the two are interchangeable; they are used regardless of whether the clause is modifying a human, regardless of their grammatical case in the relative clause, and regardless of whether the clause is restrictive.\n\nFurther, because Hebrew does not generally use its word for ''is'', ''she-'' is used to distinguish adjective phrases used in epithet from adjective phrases used in attribution:\n\n:''Ha-kise l'-yad-kha.'' (\"The chair is next to you.\" - ''lit.'', \"The-chair [is] to-hand-your.\")\n:''Ha-kise '''she-'''l'-yad-kha shavur.'' (\"The chair next to you is broken.\"\u2014''lit.'', \"The-chair '''that'''-[is]-to-hand-your [is] broken.\")\n\n(This use of ''she-'' does not occur with simple adjectives, as Hebrew has a different way of making that distinction. For example, ''Ha-kise adom'' means \"The chair [is] red,\" while ''Ha-kis'e ha-adom shavur'' means \"The red chair is broken\"\u2014literally, \"The chair the red [is] broken.\")\n\nSince 1994, the official rules of Modern Hebrew (as determined by the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]) have stated that relative clauses are to be punctuated in Hebrew the same way as in English (described above). That is, non-restrictive clauses are to be set off with commas, while restrictive clauses are not:\n\n:''Ha-kise, '''she-'''ata yoshev alav, shavur.'' (\"The chair, '''which''' you are sitting on, is broken.\")\n:''Ha-kise '''she-'''ata yoshev alav shavur.'' (\"The chair '''that''' you are sitting on is broken.\")\n\nNonetheless, many, perhaps most, speakers of Modern Hebrew still use the pre-1994 rules, which were based on the German rules (described above). Except for the simple adjective-phrase clauses described above, these speakers set off all relative clauses, restrictive or not, with commas:\n\n:''Ha-kise, '''she-'''ata yoshev alav, shavur.'' (\"The chair '''that''' you are sitting on is broken,\" ''or'' \"The chair, '''which''' you are sitting on, is broken.\")\n\nOne major difference between relative clauses in Hebrew and those in (for example) English is that in Hebrew, what might be called the \"regular\" pronoun is not always suppressed in the relative clause. To reuse the prior example:\n\n:''Ha-kise, '''she-'''ata yoshev '''alav''', shavur.'' (''lit.'', \"The chair, '''which''' you are sitting '''on it''', [is] broken.\")\n\nMore specifically, if this pronoun is the subject of the relative clause, it is always suppressed. If it is the direct object, then it is usually suppressed, though it is also correct to leave it in. (If it is suppressed, then the special preposition ''et'', used to mark the direct object, is suppressed as well.) If it is the object of a preposition, it must be left in, because in Hebrew\u2014unlike in English\u2014a preposition cannot appear without its object. When the pronoun is left in, ''she-'' might more properly be called a [[relativizer]] than a relative pronoun.\n\nThe [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[relativizer]] ''she-'' \u2018that\u2019 \"might be a shortened form of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[relativizer]] ''\u2018asher'' \u2018that\u2019, which is related to [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''\u2018ashru'' \u2018place\u2019 (cf. Semitic *''\u2018athar'') Alternatively, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''\u2018asher'' derived from ''she-'', or it was a convergence of Proto-Semitic ''dhu'' (cf. Aramaic ''d\u012b'') and ''\u2018asher'' [...] Whereas [[Israeli Hebrew|Israeli]] ''she-'' functions both as [[complementizer]] and [[relativizer]], ''ash\u00e9r'' can only function as a [[relativizer]].\"<ref>A quote from p. 79 of [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2006), \"Complement Clause Types in Israeli\", ''Complementation: A Cross-Linguistic Typology'', edited by [[R.

Aikhenvald]], [[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 72-92 (Chapter 3).</ref>\n\n====Arabic====\n\n=====Literary Arabic=====\nIn [[Modern Standard Arabic|Modern Standard]] and [[Classical Arabic]] there is a relative pronoun (in Arabic: {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0635\u0648\u0644}} {{transl|ar|DIN|''al-ism al-maw\u1e63\u016bl''}}) ''alla\u1e0f\u012b'' (masculine singular), feminine singular ''allat\u012b'', masculine plural ''alla\u1e0f\u012bna'', feminine plural ''allaw\u0101t\u012b'', masculine dual ''alla\u1e0f\u0101n\u012b'' (nominative) / ''alla\u1e0fayni'' (accusative and genitive), feminine dual ''allat\u0101n\u012b'' (nom.) / ''allatayn\u012b'' (acc. and gen.).\n\nIts usage has two specific rules: it agrees with the antecedent in gender, number and case, and it is used only if the antecedent is definite. If the antecedent is indefinite, no relative pronoun is used. The former is called ''jumlat sila'' (conjunctive sentence) while the latter is called ''jumlat sifa'' (descriptive sentence).\n\n*{{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0631\u0623\u064a\u062a\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641 \u0623\u0645\u0633 \u063a\u0627\u0626\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 }}\n:''al-waladu (a)lladhi ra\u2019aytuhu f\u012b (a)\u1e63-\u1e63affi \u2019amsi \u0121\u0101\u2019ibun al-yawma''\n:\"The boy I saw in class yesterday is missing today\".

(relative pronoun absent)\n\n=====Colloquial Arabic=====\nIn Colloquial Arabic the multiple forms of the relative pronoun have been levelled in favour of a single form, a simple conjunction, which in most dialects is ''illi'', and is never omitted. So in Palestinian Arabic the above sentences would be:\n\n* ''alwalad illi shuft\u014d fi (a)ssaff emb\u0101rih gh\u0101yeb aly\u014dm''\n* ''h\u0101da walad illi shuft\u014d fi (a)ssaff emb\u0101rih''\n\nAs in Hebrew, the regular pronoun referring to the antecedent is repeated in the relative clause - literally, \"the boy whom I saw '''him''' in class...\" (the ''-hu'' in ''ra'aituhu'' and the ''-\u014d'' in ''shuft\u014d''). The rules of suppression in Arabic are identical to those of Hebrew: obligatory suppression in the case that the pronoun is the subject of the relative clause, obligatory retention in the case that the pronoun is the object of a preposition, and at the discretion of the speaker if the pronoun is the direct object. The only difference from Hebrew is that, in the case of the direct object, it is preferable to retain the pronoun rather than suppress it.\n\n===Japonic languages===\n\n====Japanese====\nJapanese does not employ relative pronouns to relate relative clauses to their antecedents. Instead, the relative clause directly modifies the noun phrase as an [[attributive verb]], occupying the same syntactic space as an attributive adjective (before the noun phrase).\n\n:\u3053\u306e\u3000\u304a\u3044\u3057\u3044\u3000\u5929\u3077\u3089\n:''kono oishii tempura''\n:\"this delicious [[tempura]]\"\n\n:\u59c9\u304c\u3000\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u3000\u5929\u3077\u3089\n:''ane-ga tsukutta tempura''\n:''sister-SUBJ make-PAST tempura''\n:\"the tempura [that] my sister made\"\n\n:\u5929\u3077\u3089\u3092\u3000\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3000\u4eba\n:''tempura-o tabeta hito''\n:''tempura-OBJ eat-PAST person''\n:\"the person who ate the tempura\"\n\nIn fact, since so-called ''i-adjectives'' in Japanese are technically intransitive stative verbs, it can be argued that the structure of the first example (with an adjective) is the same as the others. A number of \"adjectival\" meanings, in Japanese, are customarily shown with relative clauses consisting solely of a verb or a verb complex:\n\n:\u5149\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3000\u30d3\u30eb\n:''hikatte-iru biru''\n:''lit-be building''\n:\"an illuminated building\"\n\n:\u6fe1\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3000\u72ac\n:''nurete-iru inu''\n:''get_wet-be dog''\n:\"a wet dog\"\n\nOften confusing to speakers of languages which use relative pronouns are relative clauses which would in their own languages require a preposition with the pronoun to indicate the semantic relationship among the constituent parts of the phrase.\n\n:\u7d05\u8336\u3092\u3000\u6df9\u308c\u308b\u3000\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3000\u304a\u6e6f\u3092\u3000\u6cb8\u304b\u3057\u305f\u3000\u3084\u304b\u3093\n:''k\u014dcha-o ireru tame ni oyu-o wakashita yakan''\n:''tea-OBJ make purpose for hot-water-OBJ boiled kettle''\n:\"the kettle I boiled water '''in''' for tea\"\n\nHere, the preposition \"in\" is missing from the Japanese (\"missing\" in the sense that the corresponding postposition would be used with the main clause verb in Japanese) Common sense indicates what the meaning is in this case, but the \"missing preposition\" can sometimes create ambiguity.\n\n:\u5929\u3077\u3089\u3092\u3000\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u3000\u4eba\n:''tempura-o tsukutta hito''\n:''tempura-OBJ made person''\n:(1) \"the person who made the tempura\"\n:(2) \"the person [someone] made the tempura '''for'''\"\n\nIn this case, (1) is the context-free interpretation of choice, but (2) is possible with the proper context.\n\n:\u50d5\u304c\u3000\u8a18\u4e8b\u3092\u3000\u66f8\u3044\u305f\u3000\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\n:''boku-ga kiji-o kaita resutoran''\n:''I-SUBJ article-OBJ wrote restaurant''\n:(1) \"a restaurant '''about which''' I wrote an article\"\n:(2) \"a restaurant '''in which''' I wrote an article\"\n\nWithout more context, both (1) and (2) are equally viable interpretations of the Japanese.\n\n'''Note:''' Spaces are not ordinarily used in Japanese, but they are supplemented here to facilitate parsing by non-speakers of the language.\n\n===Caucasian languages===\n\n====Georgian====\nIn [[Georgian language|Georgian]], there are two strategies for forming relative clauses. The first is similar to that of English or Latin: the modified noun is followed by a relativizer that inflects for its embedded case and may take a postposition.

In such cases, the modified noun moves into the clause, taking the appropriate declension for its role therein (thus eliminating the need for the third person pronouns in the above examples), and leaves behind the determiner (which now functions as a pronoun) in the matrix clause.\n\n:{|\n| \u10e5\u10d0\u10da\u10e1 || \u10e0\u10dd\u10db || \u10ec\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8\u10da\u10e1 || \u10d3\u10d0\u10d5\u10e3\u10ec\u10d4\u10e0, || \u10d8\u10e1 || \u10d7\u10d1\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10e8\u10d8 || \u10ea\u10ee\u10dd\u10d5\u10e0\u10dd\u10d1\u10e1\n|-\n| ''kal-s'' || ''rom'' || ''c\u0323\u0323eril-s'' || ''davuc\u0323\u0323er,'' || ''is'' || ''tbilis=\u0161i'' || ''cxovrobs''\n|-\n| woman-DAT || REL || letter-DAT || I.will.write.it.to.her || 3S.NOM || Tbilisi-in || she.lives\n|-\n| colspan=7 | \"the woman who I will write a letter to lives in [[Tbilisi]]\"\n|}\n\n===Austronesian languages===\n\n====Tagalog====\n[[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] uses the [[Relative clause#Gapped relative clause|gapping strategy]] to form relative clauses, with the [[complementizer|complementiser]], ''na'' / ''=ng'' 'that', separating the head, which is the noun being modified, from the actual relative clause. In (1a) below, ''lalaki'' 'man' serves as the head, while ''nagbigay ng bigas sa bata'' 'gave rice to the child' is the relative clause.\n\n:{|\n| (1) || a. || '''lalaki''' || =ng || nagbigay || ____ || ng || bigas || sa || bata\n|-\n|  ||  || man || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|act}}.gave ||  || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=8 | \"man that gave rice to the child\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || b. || Nagbigay || ''ang'' || ''lalaki'' || ng || bigas || sa || bata.\n|-\n|  ||  || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|nom}} || man || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=8 | \"The man gave rice to the child.\"\n|}\n\nThe gap inside the relative clause corresponds to the position that the noun acting as the head would have normally taken, had it been in a [[Sentence (linguistics)#By purpose|declarative sentence]]. In (1a), the gap is in subject position within the relative clause. This corresponds to the subject position occupied by ''ang lalaki'' 'the man' in the declarative sentence in (1b).\n\nThere is a constraint in Tagalog on the position from which a noun can be relativised and in which a gap can appear: A noun has to be the subject within the relative clause in order for it to be relativised. The phrases in (2) are ungrammatical because the nouns that have been relativised are not the subjects of their respective relative clauses. In (2a), the gap is in direct object position, while in (2b), the gap is in indirect object position.\n\n:{|\n| (2) || a. || * || '''bigas''' || na || nagbigay || ang || lalaki || ____ || sa || bata\n|-\n|  ||  ||  || rice || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|nom}} || man ||  || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  ||  || colspan=8 | for:  \"rice that the man gave to the child\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || b. || * || '''bata''' || =ng || nagbigay || ang || lalaki || ng || bigas || ____\n|-\n|  ||  ||  || child || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|nom}} || man || {{sc|acc}} || rice ||\n|-\n|  ||  ||  || colspan=8 | for:  \"child that the man gave rice to\"\n|}\n\nThe correct Tagalog translations for the intended meanings in (2) are found in (3), where the verbs have been passivised in order to raise the logical direct object in (3a) and the logical indirect object in (3b) to subject position.  (Tagalog can have more than one [[Tagalog grammar#Trigger .28voice .2F focus.29|passive voice]] form for any given verb.)\n\n:{|\n| (3) || a. || '''bigas''' || na || ibinigay || ng || lalaki || sa || bata\n|-\n|  ||  || rice || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|psv}}.gave || {{sc|gen}} || man || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"rice that the man gave to the child\"\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | (or:  \"rice that was given to the child by the man\")\n|-\n|  || b. || '''bata''' || =ng || binigyan || ng || lalaki || ng || bigas\n|-\n|  ||  || child || {{sc|comp}} || gave.{{sc|psv}} || {{sc|gen}} || man || {{sc|acc}} || rice\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"child that the man gave rice to\"\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | (or:  \"child that was given rice to by the man\")\n|}\n\nTagalog relative clauses can be left-headed, as in (1a) and (3), right-headed, as in (4), or internally headed, as in (5).\n\n:{|\n| (4) || nagbigay || ng || bigas || sa || bata || na || '''lalaki'''\n|-\n|   || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|dat}} || child || {{sc|comp}} || man\n|-\n|  || colspan=7 | \"man that gave rice to the child\"\n|}\n\n:{|\n| (5) || a. || nagbigay || na || '''lalaki''' || ng || bigas || sa || bata\n|-\n|   ||  || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|comp}} || man || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"man that gave rice to the child\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || b. || nagbigay || ng || bigas || na || '''lalaki''' || sa || bata\n|-\n|   ||  || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|comp}} || man || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"man that gave rice to the child\"\n|}\n\nIn (4), the head, ''lalaki'' 'man', is found after or to the right of the relative clause, ''nagbigay ng bigas sa bata'' 'gave rice to the child'. In (5), the head is found in some position inside the relative clause. When the head appears to the right of or internally to the relative clause, the complementiser appears to the left of the head. When the head surfaces to the left of the relative clause, the complementiser surfaces to the right of the head.\n\nThere are exceptions to the subjects-only constraint to relativisation mentioned above. The first involves relativising the [[Possession (linguistics)|possessor]] of a noun phrase within the relative clause.\n\n:{|\n| (6) || '''bata''' || =ng || nasugatan || ang || daliri || ____\n|-\n|   || child || {{sc|comp}} || injured.{{sc|psv}} || {{sc|nom}} || finger ||\n|-\n|  || colspan=6 | \"child whose finger was injured\"\n|}\n\nIn (6), the head, ''bata'' 'child', is the owner of the injured finger. The phrase ''ang daliri'' 'the finger' is the subject of the verb, ''nasugatan'' 'was injured'.\n\nAnother exception involves relativising the [[Oblique case|oblique]] noun phrase.\n\n:{|\n| (7) || a. || '''ospital''' || (na) || kung || saan || ipinanganak || si || Juan\n|-\n|  ||  || hospital || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|q-comp}} || where || {{sc|psv}}.bore || {{sc|nom}} || Juan\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"hospital where Juan was born\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || b. || Nagtanong || siya || kung || saan || ipinanganak || si || Juan.\n|-\n|  ||  || {{sc|act}}.asked || {{sc|3sg.nom}} || {{sc|q-comp}} || where || {{sc|psv}}.bore || {{sc|nom}} || Juan\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"She asked where Juan was born.\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || c. || Ipinanganak || si || Juan || ''sa'' || ''ospital''.\n|-\n|   ||  || {{sc|psv}}.bore || {{sc|nom}} || Juan || {{sc|loc}} || hospital\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"Juan was born at the hospital.\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || d. || Saan || ipinanganak || si || Juan?\n|-\n|   ||  || where || {{sc|psv}}.bore || {{sc|nom}} || Juan\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"Where was Juan born?\"\n|}\n\nWhen an oblique noun phrase is relativised, as in (7a), ''na'' 'that', the complementiser that separates the head from the relative clause, is optional. The relative clause itself is also composed differently. In the examples in (1a), and in (3) to (6), the relative clauses are simple declaratives that contain a gap. However, the relative clause in (7a) looks more like an [[Indirect speech|indirect]] [[Sentence (linguistics)#By purpose|question]], complete with the [[Sentence (linguistics)#By purpose|interrogative]] complementiser, ''kung'' 'if', and a pre-verbally positioned [[Interrogative word|WH-word]] like ''saan'' 'where', as in (7b). The sentence in (7c) is the declarative version of the relative clause in (7a), illustrating where the head, ''ospital'' 'hospital', would have been \"before\" relativisation. The question in (7d) shows the direct question version of the [[Dependent clause|subordinate]] indirect question in (7b).\n\n====Hawaiian====\n\nRelative clauses in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]<ref>Alexander, W. D., ''Introduction to Hawaiian Grammar'', Dover, 2004 (originally 1864): 45-47.</ref>  are avoided unless they are short.\n\nIf in English a relative clause would have a copula and an adjective, in Hawaiian the antecedent is simply modified by the adjective: \"The honest man\" instead of \"the man who is honest\". If the English relative clause would have a copula and a noun, in Hawaiian an appositive is used instead: \"Paul, an apostle\" instead of \"Paul, who was an apostle\".\n\nIf the English relative pronoun would be the subject of an intransitive or passive verb, in Hawaiian a participle is used instead of a full relative clause:  \"the people fallen\" instead of \"the people who fell\"; \"the thing given\" instead of \"the thing that was given\". But when the relative clause's antecedent is a person, the English relative pronoun would be the subject of the relative clause, and the relative clause's verb is active and transitive, a relative clause is used and it begins with the relative pronoun ''nana'': ''The one who me (past) sent'' = \"the one who sent me\".\n\nIf in English a relative pronoun would be the object of a relative clause, in Hawaiian the possessive form is used so as to treat the antecedent as something possessed: ''the things of me to have seen'' = \"the things that I saw\"; ''Here is theirs to have seen'' = This is what they saw\".\n\n===Andean languages===\n\n====Aymara====\n{|\n| thuqu\u00f1ap || punchu\n|-\n| dance-INF-3POSS || poncho\n|-\n| colspan=6 | \"the poncho he is dancing with\"\n|}\n\n===Chinese===\n\n====Mandarin====\n{{further|Chinese grammar}}\nIn [[Mandarin Chinese]], the relative clause is similar to other adjectival phrases in that it precedes the noun that it modifies, and ends with the relative particle ''de''.

''Pidgin Grammar'', Bess Press, 2003: pp. 102ff.</ref> As in English, a relative pronoun that serves as the object of the verb in the relative clause can optionally be omitted: For example,\n\n:''Ai neva si da buk daet Lisa wen bai''\n:I never see the book that Lisa (past) buy\n:I didn't see the book that Lisa bought\n\ncan also be expressed with the relative pronoun omitted, as\n\n:''Ai neva si da buk Lisa wen bai''\n:I never see the book Lisa (past) buy\n:I didn't see the book Lisa bought\n\nHowever, relative pronouns serving as the subject of a relative clause show more flexibility than in English; they can be included, as is mandatory in English, they can be omitted, or they can be replaced by another pronoun. For example, all of the following can occur and all mean the same thing:\n\n:''Get wan nada grl hu no kaen ste stil''\n:There's one other girl who no can stay still\n:There's another girl who cannot stay still\n\n:''Get wan nada grl no kaen ste stil''\n:There's one other girl no can stay still\n\n:''Get wan nada grl shi no kaen ste stil''\n:There's one other girl she no can stay still\n\n====Gullah====\n\nIn [[Gullah language|Gullah]], an English-based creole spoken along the southeastern coast of the United States, no relative pronoun is normally used for the subject of a relative clause. For example:\n\n:''Duh him cry out so''\n:It him cry out so\n:It's he who cries out so\n\n:''Enty duh dem shum dey?''\n:Ain't it them saw_him there?\n:Isn't it they who saw him there?\n\n==See also==\n*[[Long-distance dependencies]]\n*[[Reduced relative clause]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n*[[Rodney Huddleston]] and [[Geoffrey Pullum|Geoffrey K.

Huddleston, Geoffrey K. Pullum, ''A Student's Introduction to English Grammar'', CUP 2005, p. 183ff.</ref>\n\nTypically, a relative clause modifies a [[noun]] or [[noun phrase]],<ref name=\"HP183\" /> and uses some grammatical device to indicate that one of the arguments within the relative clause has the same referent as that noun or noun phrase. For example, in the sentence ''I met a man who wasn't there'', the subordinate clause ''who wasn't there'' is a relative clause, since it modifies the noun ''man'', and uses the pronoun ''who'' to indicate that the same \"man\" is referred to within the subordinate clause (in this case, as its [[subject (grammar)|subject]]).\n\nIn many European languages, relative clauses are introduced by a special class of [[pronoun]]s called ''[[relative pronoun]]s'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Kurzov\u00e1 |first=Helena |year=1981 |language=German |title=Der Relativsatz in den indoeurop\u00e4ischen Sprachen |trans-title=Relative Clauses in the Indo-European Languages |series= |location=Hamburg |publisher=Buske |page=117 |isbn=3-87118-458-6 |oclc=63317519}}</ref> such as ''who'' in the example just given. In other languages, relative clauses may be marked in different ways: they may be introduced by a special class of conjunctions called ''[[relativizer]]s''; the main verb of the relative clause may appear in a special morphological variant; or a relative clause may be indicated by word order alone.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lehmann |first=Christian |year=1984 |language=German |title= Der Relativsatz |trans-title=Relative Clauses |series=Language universals series; vol. 3 |location=T\u00fcbingen |publisher=G. Narr |page=438 |isbn=3-87808-982-1 |oclc=14358164}}</ref> In some languages, more than one of these mechanisms may be possible.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Bound and free===\nA '''bound relative clause''', the type most often considered, qualifies an explicit element (usually a [[noun]] or [[noun phrase]]) appearing in the main clause, and refers back to that element by means of some explicit or implicit device within the relative clause.\n\nThe relative clause may also function as an ''embedded clause'' within a main (or higher-level) clause, thereby forming a ''matrix sentence''.<ref name=\"Glossary of Linguistic Terms \">Matrix Sentence, ''http://www.glossary.sil.org/term/matrix-sentencer''</ref> The noun in the main clause that the relative clause modifies is called the ''[[Head (grammar)|head]] noun'', or (particularly when referred back to by a relative pronoun) the ''[[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]]''.\n\nFor example, in the English sentence \"The man whom I saw yesterday went home\", the relative clause \"whom I saw yesterday\" modifies the head noun ''man'', and the relative pronoun ''whom'' refers back to the referent of that noun. The sentence is equivalent to the following two sentences: \"I saw a man yesterday. The man went home.\" The shared argument need not fulfill the same role in both clauses; in this example the same man is referred to by the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the matrix clause, but the [[direct object]] of the relative clause.\n\nA '''free relative clause''', on the other hand, does not have an explicit antecedent external to itself. Instead, the relative clause itself takes the place of an argument in the matrix clause. For example, in the English sentence \"I like what I see\", the clause ''what I see'' is a free relative clause, because it has no antecedent, but itself serves as the [[object (grammar)|object]] of the verb ''like'' in the main clause. (An alternative analysis is that the free relative clause has [[zero (linguistics)|zero]] as its antecedent.)\n\n===Restrictive and non-restrictive===\nBound relative clauses may or may not be [[restrictive]]. Whereas a '''non-restrictive''' or '''non-defining''' relative clause merely provides supplementary information, a '''restrictive''' or '''defining''' relative clause modifies the meaning of its head word (restricts its possible referent).  For example:\n*''The man '''who lives in this house''' has not been seen for days.'' This (''who lives in this house'') is a restrictive relative clause, modifying the meaning of ''man'', and essential to the sentence (if the clause were omitted, it would no longer be known which man is being referred to). If the bold part is deleted the remaining part does not provide the sense.\n*''The mayor, '''who lives in this house''', has not been seen for days.'' This is a non-restrictive relative clause, since it provides supplementary information about the mayor, but is not essential to the sentence \u2013 if the clause were omitted, it would still be known which mayor is meant.  If the bold part is deleted the remaining part provides the sense.\n\nIn speaking it is natural to make slight pauses around non-restrictive clauses, and in English this is shown in writing by [[comma]]s (as in the examples). However many languages do not distinguish the two types of relative clause in this way. Another difference in English is that only restrictive relative clauses may be introduced with ''that'' or use the \"zero\" relative pronoun (see [[English relative clauses]] for details).\n\nIn colloquial speech, a non-restrictive relative clause may have a whole sentence as its antecedent rather than a specific noun phrase; for example:\n*''The cat was allowed on the bed, '''which annoyed the dog'''.''\nHere, the context of the sentence (presumably) indicates that ''which'' refers not to the bed or the cat but to the entire [[proposition]] expressed in the main clause, namely the circumstance that the cat was allowed on the bed. Such constructions are discouraged in formal usage and in texts written for nonnative speakers because of the potential for [[syntactic ambiguity|ambiguity]] in parsing; a construction more accepted in formal usage would be ''The cat's being ''[or ''having been''] ''allowed on the bed annoyed the dog.''\n\n===Finite and non-finite===\nRelative clauses may be either finite clauses (as in the examples above) or [[non-finite clause]]s. An example of a non-finite relative clause in English is the [[infinitive clause]] ''on whom to rely'', in the sentence \"She is the person on whom to rely\".\n\n==Formation methods==\nLanguages differ in many ways in how relative clauses are expressed:\n#How the role of the shared noun phrase is indicated in the embedded clause.\n#How the two clauses are joined together.\n#Where the embedded clause is placed relative to the head noun (in the process indicating which noun phrase in the main clause is modified).\n\nFor example, the English sentence \"The man that I saw yesterday went home\" can be described as follows:\n#The role of the shared noun in the embedded clause is indicated by ''gapping''; that is, a gap is left in the object position after \"saw\", implying that the shared noun phrase (\"the man\") is to be understood to fill that gap and to serve as the object of the verb \"saw\".\n#The clauses are joined by the ''complementizer'' \"that\".\n#The embedded clause is placed ''after'' the head noun \"the man\".\n\nThe following sentences indicate various possibilities (only some of which are grammatical in English):\n*\"The man [that I saw yesterday] went home\". (A ''complementizer'' linking the two clauses with a ''gapping'' strategy indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause. One possibility in English. Very common cross-linguistically.)\n*\"The man [I saw yesterday] went home\". (Gapping strategy, with no word joining the clauses&mdash;also known as a [[reduced relative clause]]. One possibility in English. Used in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] when the head noun is [[definiteness|indefinite]], as in \"a man\" instead of \"the man\".)\n*\"The man [whom I saw yesterday] went home\". (A [[relative pronoun]] indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause\u2014in this case, the direct object. Used in formal English, as in [[Latin]], [[German language|German]] or [[Russian language|Russian]].)\n*\"The man [seen by me yesterday] went home\". (A [[reduced relative clause]], in this case [[passive voice|passivized]]. One possibility in English.)\n*\"The man [that I saw him yesterday] went home\". (A complementizer linking the two sentences with a [[resumptive pronoun]] indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause, as in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Persian language|Persian]].)\n*\"The man [that him I saw yesterday] went home\". (Similar to the previous, but with the resumptive pronoun fronted. This occurs in modern [[Greek language|Greek]] and as one possibility in modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; the combination ''that him'' of complementizer and resumptive pronoun behaves similar to a unitary relative pronoun.)\n*\"The [I saw yesterday]'s man went home\". (Preceding relative clause with gapping and use of a possessive particle\u2014as normally used in a [[genitive construction]]\u2014to link the relative clause to the head noun. This occurs in many Sino-Tibetan languages and possibly developed from \"relative clause + noun\" > \"nominalized clause + noun\" > \"genitive construction\".<ref>http://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files/publication/j2008_4_03_2641.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files/publication/j2008_4_05_5653.pdf</ref>)\n*\"The [I saw yesterday] man went home\". (Preceding relative clause with gapping and no linking word, as in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] or [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]].)\n*\"The man [of my seeing yesterday] went home\". ([[Nominalization|Nominalized]] relative clause, as in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].)\n*\"[Which man I saw yesterday], that man went home\". (A ''correlative'' structure, as in [[Hindi]].)\n*\"[I saw the man yesterday] went home.\" (An ''unreduced, internally headed'' relative clause, as in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] or [[Navajo language|Navajo]].)\n\n===Strategies for indicating the role of the shared noun in the relative clause===\nThere are four main strategies for indicating the role of the shared noun phrase in the embedded clause. These are typically listed in order of the degree to which the noun in the relative clause has been reduced, from most to least:\n\n# Gap strategy or gapped relative clause\n# Relative pronoun\n# Pronoun retention\n# Nonreduction\n\n====Gapped relative clause====\nIn this strategy, there is simply a gap in the relative clause where the shared noun would go. This is normal in English, for example, and also in Chinese and Japanese. This is the most common type of relative clause, especially in [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb|verb-final]] languages with prenominal relative clauses, but is also widespread among languages with postnominal externally headed relative clauses.\n\nThere may or may not be any marker used to join the relative and main clauses. (Languages with a case-marked relative pronoun are technically not considered to employ the gapping strategy even though they do in fact have a gap, since the case of the relative pronoun indicates the role of the shared noun.) Often the form of the verb is different from that in main clauses and is to some degree nominalized, as in Turkish and in English [[reduced relative clause]]s.<ref>{{cite book | last=Carrol | first=David W | edition=5 | title=Psychology of Language | publisher=Thomson & Wadsworth | location=Belmont | year=2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Townsend | first=David J |author2=Thomas G Bever  | title=Sentence Comprehension: The Integration of Habits and Rules | year=2001 | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge | pages=247&ndash;9}}</ref>\n\nIn non-verb-final languages, apart from languages like [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] with very strong politeness distinctions in their grammars{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}, gapped relative clauses tend, however, to be restricted to positions high up in the accessibility hierarchy. With obliques and genitives, non-verb-final languages that do not have politeness restrictions on pronoun use tend to use pronoun retention. English is unusual in that ''all'' roles in the embedded clause can be indicated by gapping: e.g. \"I saw the man who is my friend\", but also (in progressively less accessible positions cross-linguistically, according to the ''[[accessibility hierarchy]]'' described below) \"...&nbsp;who I know\", \"...&nbsp;who I gave a book to\", \"...&nbsp;who I spoke with\", \"...&nbsp;who I run slower than\". Usually, languages with gapping disallow it beyond a certain level in the accessibility hierarchy, and switch to a different strategy at this point. [[Classical Arabic]], for example, only allows gapping in the subject and sometimes the direct object; beyond that, a resumptive pronoun must be used. Some languages have no allowed strategies at all past a certain point\u2014e.g. in many [[Austronesian languages]], such as [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], all relative clauses must have the shared noun serving the subject role in the embedded clause. In these languages, relative clauses with shared nouns serving \"disallowed\" roles can be expressed by [[passive voice|passivizing]] the embedded sentence, thereby moving the noun in the embedded sentence into the subject position. This, for example, would transform \"The man who I gave a book to\" into \"The man who was given a book by me\". Generally, languages such as this \"conspire\" to implement general relativization by allowing passivization from ''all'' positions \u2014 hence a sentence equivalent to \"The man who is run slower than by me\" is grammatical. Gapping is often used in conjunction with case-marked relative pronouns (since the relative pronoun indicates the case role in the embedded clause), but this is not necessary (e.g. Chinese and Japanese both using gapping in conjunction with an indeclinable complementizer).\n\n====Relative pronoun type====\nThis is in fact a type of gapped relative clause, but is distinguished by the fact that the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause is indicated indirectly by the case marking of the marker (the [[relative pronoun]]) used to join the main and embedded clauses. All languages which use relative pronouns have them in clause-initial position: though one could conceivably imagine a clause-final relative pronoun analogous to an adverbial subordinator in that position, they are unknown.\n\nSome languages have what are described as \"relative pronouns\" (in that they agree with some properties of the head noun, such as number and gender) but which do not actually indicate the case role of the shared noun in the embedded clause. [[Classical Arabic]] in fact has \"relative pronouns\" which are case-marked, but which agree in case with the ''head'' noun. Case-marked relative pronouns in the strict sense are almost entirely confined to [[Standard Average European|European languages]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, where they are widespread except among the [[Celtic languages|Celtic family]] and [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan family]]. The influence of Spanish has led to their adaption by a very small number of [[indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]], of which the best-known are the [[Keresan languages]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_aco|title=WALS Online - Language Acoma|author=|date=|website=wals.info|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Pronoun retention type====\nIn this type, the position relativized is indicated by means of a [[personal pronoun]] in the same syntactic position as would ordinarily be occupied by a noun phrase of that type in the main clause\u2014known as a ''[[resumptive pronoun]]''. It is equivalent to saying \"The man who I saw <u>him</u> yesterday went home\". Pronoun retention is very frequently used for relativization of inaccessible positions on the accessibility hierarchy. In [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Classical Arabic]], for example, resumptive pronouns are required when the embedded role is other than the subject or direct object, and optional in the case of the direct object. Resumptive pronouns are common in non-verb-final [[languages of Africa]] and Asia, and also used by the Celtic languages of northwest Europe and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (\"Omul pe care <u>l</u>-am v\u0103zut ieri a mers acas\u0103\"/\"The man who I saw <u>him</u> yesterday went home\"). They also occur in deeply embedded positions in English, as in \"That's the girl that I don't know what <u>she</u> did\",<ref name=\"mckee\">{{citation|title=Resumptive Pronouns in English Relative Clauses|first1=Cecile|last1=McKee|first2=Dana|last2=McDaniel|journal=Language Acquisition|volume=9|number=2|year=2001|pages=113\u2013156|doi=10.1207/s15327817la0902_01}}.</ref> although this is sometimes considered non-standard.\n\nOnly a very small number of languages, of which the best known is [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], have pronoun retention as their sole grammatical type of relative clause.\n\n====Nonreduction type====\nIn the nonreduction type, unlike the other three, the shared noun occurs as a ''full-fledged noun phrase'' in the embedded clause, which has the form of a full independent clause. Typically, it is the head noun in the main clause that is reduced or missing. Some languages use relative clauses of this type with the normal strategy of embedding the relative clause next to the head noun. These languages are said to have ''internally headed'' relative clauses, which would be similar to the (ungrammatical) English structure \"[You see the girl over there] is my friend\" or \"I took [you see the girl over there] out on a date\". This is used, for example, in [[Navajo language|Navajo]], which uses a special relative verb (as with some other Native American languages).\n\nA second strategy is the ''correlative''-clause strategy used by [[Hindi]] and other [[Indo-Aryan languages]], as well as [[Bambara language|Bambara]]. This strategy is equivalent to saying \"Which girl you see over there, she is my daughter\" or \"Which knife I killed my friend with, the police found that knife\". It is \"correlative\" because of the corresponding \"which ... that ...\" demonstratives or \"which ... she/he/it ...\" pronouns, which indicate the respective nouns being equated. The shared noun can either be repeated entirely in the main clause or reduced to a pronoun. There is no need to front the shared noun in such a sentence. For example, in the second example above, Hindi would actually say something equivalent to \"I killed my friend with which knife, the police found that knife\".\n\nDialects of some European languages, such as Italian, do use the nonreduction type in forms that could be glossed in English as \"The man just passed us by, he introduced me to the chancellor here.\"\n\nIn general, however, nonreduction is restricted to verb-final languages, though it is more common among those that are [[head-marking language|head-marking]].\n\n===Strategies for joining the relative clause to the main clause===\nThe following are some of the common strategies for joining the two clauses:\n*Use of an indeclinable particle (specifically, a [[relativizer]]) inserted into the sentence, placed next to the modified noun; the embedded clause is likewise inserted into the appropriate position, typically placed on the other side of the complementizer. This strategy is very common and arguably occurs in English with the word ''that'' (\"the man that I saw\"), though this interpretation of \"that\" as something other than a relative pronoun is controversial (see [[#English|below]]). In the modern [[varieties of Arabic]] (using ''illi'' placed after the modified noun); in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (using ''de'' placed before the modified noun).\n*Use of a [[relative pronoun]]. Prototypically, a relative pronoun agrees with the head noun in gender, number, definiteness, animacy, etc., but adopts the [[grammatical case|case]] that the shared noun assumes in the ''embedded'', not matrix, clause. This is the case in a number of conservative European languages, such as [[Latin]], [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Many languages also have similar linking words commonly termed \"relative pronouns\" that agree in some way with the head noun, but do not adopt the case role of the embedded clause. In English, for example, the use of ''who'' vs. ''which'' agrees with the animacy of the head noun, but there is no case agreement except in the formal English contrast ''who'' vs. ''whom'' (which is often used incorrectly, if at all, in speech). Similarly, in [[Classical Arabic]], there is a relative pronoun that agrees in number, gender, [[definiteness]] ''and'' case with the head noun (rather than taking the case role of the noun in the embedded clause). Languages with prototypical relative pronouns typically use the gapping strategy for indicating the role in the embedded clause, since the relative pronoun itself indicates the role by its case. ([[Classical Arabic]], where the case marking indicates something else, uses a [[resumptive pronoun]].) Some linguists prefer to use the term ''relative pronoun'' only for the prototypical cases (but in this case it's unclear what to call the non-prototypical cases).\n*Directly inserting the embedded clause in the matrix clause at the appropriate position, with no word used to join them. This is common, for example, in English (cf. \"The man I saw yesterday went home\"), and is used in [[Classical Arabic]] in relative clauses that modify indefinite nouns.\n*By [[nominalization|nominalizing]] the relative clause (e.g. converting it to a participial construction). Generally, no relative pronoun or complementizer is used. This occurs, for example, in [[reduced relative clause]]s in English (e.g. \"The man seen by me yesterday went home\" or \"The man planning to go home soon is my friend\"). Formal German makes common use of such participial relative clauses, which can become extremely long. This is also the normal strategy in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], which has sentences equivalent to \"I ate the potato of Hasan's giving to Sina\" (in place of \"I ate the potato that Hasan gave to Sina\"). This can be viewed as a situation in which the \"complementizer\" is attached to the verb of the embedded clause (e.g. in English, \"-ing\" or \"-ed\" can be viewed as a type of complementizer).\n\n===Position of the head noun with respect to the relative clause===\nThe positioning of a relative clause before or after a head noun is related to the more general concept of [[Branching (linguistics)|branching]] in linguistics. Languages that place relative clauses after their head noun (so-called ''head-initial'' or ''VO'' languages) generally also have adjectives and [[genitive construction|genitive modifier]]s following the head noun, as well as verbs preceding their objects. [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are prototypical languages of this sort. Languages that place relative clauses before their head noun (so-called ''head-final'' or ''OV'' languages) generally also have adjectives and [[genitive construction|genitive modifier]]s preceding the head noun, as well as verbs following their objects. [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] are prototypical languages of this sort. Not all languages fit so easily into these categories. English, for example, is generally head-first, but has adjectives preceding their head nouns, and [[genitive construction]]s with both preceding and following modifiers (\"the friend of my father\" vs. \"my father's friend\"). [[Chinese language|Chinese]] has the ''VO'' order, with verb preceding object, but otherwise is generally head-final.\n\nVarious possibilities for ordering are:\n*Relative clause following the head noun, as in English, [[French language|French]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]].\n*Relative clause preceding the head noun, as in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], or [[Chinese language|Chinese]].\n*Head noun ''within'' the relative clause (an ''internally headed'' relative clause). An example of such a language is [[Navajo language|Navajo]]. These languages are said to have [[#Nonreduction type|nonreduced]] relative clauses. These languages have a structure equivalent to \"[I saw the man yesterday] went home\".\n*Adjoined relative clause. These languages have the relative clause completely outside the main clause, and use a correlative structure to link the two. These languages also have [[#Nonreduction type|nonreduced]] relative clauses. [[Hindi]] is the most well known such language, and have a structure similar to \"Which man I saw yesterday, that man went home\" or (with non-fronting of the relativized noun in the relative clause) \"I saw which man yesterday, that man went home\". Another example is [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]], which constructs relative clauses of a form similar to \"I saw the man yesterday, which he was going home\". However, it is sometimes said these languages have no relative clauses at all, since the sentences of this form can equally well translate as  \"I saw the man who was going home yesterday\" or \"I saw the man yesterday when/while he was going home\".\n\n==Accessibility hierarchy==\nThe antecedent of the relative clause (that is, the noun that is modified by it) can in theory be the subject of the main clause, or its object, or any other [[verb argument]]. In many languages, however, especially rigidly [[left-branching]], [[dependent-marking language]]s with prenominal relative clauses,<ref>Lehmann, Christian (1986). On the typology of relative clauses. ''Linguistics'', 24(4), 663-680. {{doi|10.1515/ling.1986.24.4.663}}</ref> there are major restrictions on the role the antecedent may have ''in the relative clause''.\n\n[[Edward Keenan]] and [[Bernard Comrie]] noted that these roles can be ranked cross-linguistically in the following order from most accessible to least accessible:<ref>Keenan, Edward L. & Comrie, Bernard (1977). Noun phrase accessibility and Universal Grammar, [[Linguistic Inquiry]], 8(1), 63-99</ref><ref>Comrie, Bernard; ''Language Universals and Linguistic Typology''; pp. 156-163; {{ISBN|0-226-11434-1}}</ref>\n\n:Subject  > Direct Object  > Indirect Object  > Oblique  > Genitive  > Object of comparative\n\n[[Ergative\u2013absolutive]] languages have a similar hierarchy:\n\n:[[Absolutive case|Absolutive]] > [[Ergative case|Ergative]] > Indirect Object > etc. (same as above)\n\nThis order is called the '''accessibility hierarchy'''. If a language can relativize positions lower in the accessibility hierarchy, it can always relativize positions higher up, but not vice versa. For example, [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] can relativize only subject and [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]] only absolutive arguments, whilst [[Basque language|Basque]] can relativize absolutives, ergatives and indirect objects, but not obliques or genitives or objects of comparatives. Similar hierarchies have been proposed in other circumstances, e.g. for pronominal reflexes.\n\n[[English language|English]] can relativize all positions in the hierarchy. Here are some examples of the NP and relative clause usage from English:\n\n{| align=\"center\"\n!Position !! With explicit relative pronoun !! With omitted relative pronoun !! In formal English\n|-\n|[[subject (grammar)|Subject]] || That's the man [who ran away]. || \u2014 || That's the man [who ran away].\n|-\n|[[Direct object]] || That's the man [who I saw yesterday]. || That's the man [I saw yesterday]. || That's the man [whom I saw yesterday].\n|-\n|[[Indirect object]] || That's the man [who I gave the letter to]. || That's the man [I gave the letter to]. || That's the man [to whom I gave the letter]. \n|-\n|[[oblique case|Oblique]] || That's the man [who I was talking about].  || That's the man [I was talking about]. || That's the man [about whom I was talking]. \n|-\n|[[Genitive]] || That's the man [whose sister I know].\t       || \u2014 ||  That's the man [whose sister I know].\n|-\n|Obj of Comp || That's the man [who I am taller than].\t\t       || That's the man [I am taller than]. || That's the man [than whom I am taller].\n|}\n\nSome other examples:\n\n{| align=\"center\"\n!Position !! Example\n|-\n|[[subject (grammar)|Subject]] || The girl [who came late] is my sister.\n|-\n|[[Direct object]]  || I gave a rose to the girl [that Kate saw].\n|-\n|[[Indirect object]] || John knows the girl [I wrote a letter to].\n|-\n|[[oblique case|Oblique]] || I found the rock [which the robbers had hit John over the head with].\n|-\n|[[Genitive]] || The girl [whose father died] told me she was sad.\n|-\n|Obj of Comp || The first person [I can't run faster than] will win a million dollars.\n|}\n\nLanguages that cannot relativize directly on noun phrases low in the accessibility hierarchy can sometimes use alternative [[grammatical voice|voices]] to \"raise\" the relevant noun phrase so that it can be relativized. The most common example is the use of [[applicative voice]]s to relativize obliques, but in such languages as Chukchi [[antipassive voice|antipassives]] are used to raise ergative arguments to absolutive.\n\nFor example, a language that can relativize only subjects could say this:\n*The girl [who likes me] came to visit.\nBut not:\n*The girl [whom I like] came to visit.\n*The girl [whom I gave a rose to] came to visit.\n*The girl [whom I watched a movie with] came to visit.\n*The girl [whose father I know] came to visit.\n*The girl [whom I know the father of] came to visit. (''equivalent to previous'')\n*The girl [whom I am taller than] came to visit.\nThese languages might form an equivalent sentence by [[passive voice|passivization]]:\n*The girl [who was liked by me] came to visit.\n*The girl [who was given a rose by me] came to visit.\n*The girl [who was watched a movie with by me] came to visit.\n*The girl [who was known the father of by me] came to visit.\n*The girl [who was been taller than by me] came to visit.\nThese passivized sentences get progressively more ungrammatical in English as they move down the accessibility hierarchy; the last two, in particular, are so ungrammatical as to be almost unparsable by English speakers. But languages with severe restrictions on which roles can be relativized are precisely those that can passivize almost any position, and hence the last two sentences would be normal in those languages.\n\nA further example is languages that can relativize only subjects and direct objects. Hence the following would be possible:\n*The girl [who I like] came to visit.\nThe other ungrammatical examples above would still be ungrammatical. These languages often allow an oblique object to be moved to the direct object slot by the use of the so-called ''[[applicative voice]]'', much as the [[passive voice]] moves an oblique object to the subject position. The above examples expressed in an applicative voice might be similar to the following (in not necessarily grammatical English):\n*The girl [who I gave a rose] came to visit.\n*The girl [who I with-watched a movie] came to visit.\n*The girl [who I (of-)know the father] came to visit.\n*The girl [who I out-tall] came to visit.\n\nModern grammars may use the accessibility hierarchy to order productions\u2014e.g. in [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]] the hierarchy corresponds to the order of elements on the ''subcat'' list, and interacts with other principles in explanations of binding facts. The hierarchy also figures in\n[[Lexical Functional Grammar]], where it is known as Syntactic Rank or the Relational Hierarchy.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Indo-European languages===\n\n====English====\n{{main|English relative clauses}}\nIn English, a relative clause follows the noun it modifies. It is generally indicated by a relative pronoun at the start of the clause, although sometimes simply by word order. If the relative pronoun is the object of the verb in the relative clause, it comes at the beginning of the clause even though it would come at the end of an independent clause (\"He is the man ''whom'' I saw\", not \"He is the man I saw ''whom''\").\n\nThe choice of relative pronoun can be affected by whether the clause modifies a human or non-human noun, by whether the clause is restrictive or not,<ref>{{cite book |last=Kordi\u0107 |first=Snje\u017eana |authorlink=Snje\u017eana Kordi\u0107 |editor1-last=Suprun |editor1-first=Adam E |url-status=live |editor2-last=Jachnow |editor2-first=Helmut |title=Slavjano-germanskie jazykovye paralleli/Slawisch-germanische Sprachparallelen |series=Sovmestnyj issledovatel'skij sbornik slavistov universitetov v Minske i Bochume |publisher=Belorusskij gosudarstvennyj universitet |page=165 |language=German |chapter=Pronomina im Antezedenten und Restriktivit\u00e4t/Nicht-Restriktivit\u00e4t von Relativs\u00e4tzen im Kroatoserbischen und Deutschen |trans-chapter=Pronouns in antecedents and restrictive / non-restrictive relative clauses in Serbo-Croatian and German |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/426662.PRONOMINA_IM_ANTEZEDENT.PDF |location=Minsk |year=1996 |oclc=637166830 |ssrn=3434472 |id={{CROSBI|426662}} |archivedate=29 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AHPw0DET |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref> and by the role (subject, direct object, or the like) of the relative pronoun in the relative clause.\n\n*For a human antecedent, \"who\", \"whom\", or \"that\" is usually used (\"He is the person ''who'' saw me\", \"He is the person ''whom'' I saw\", \"He is the person ''that'' I saw\"). For a non-human antecedent, only \"that\" or \"which\" is used.\n*For a non-human antecedent in a non-restrictive clause, only \"which\" is used (\"The tree, ''which'' fell, is over there\"); while either \"which\" or \"that\" may be used in a restrictive clause (\"The tree ''which'' fell is over there\", \"The tree ''that'' fell is over there\"){{mdash}}but some styles and prescriptive grammars require the use of \"that\" in the restrictive context.\n*Of the relative pronoun pair \"who\" and \"whom\", the ''subjective'' case form (\"who\") is used if it is the subject of the relative clause (\"He is the policeman who saw me\"); and, in formal usage, the ''objective'' case form (\"whom\") if it is the object of the verb or preposition in the relative clause (\"He is the policeman whom I saw\", \"He is the policeman whom I talked to\", \"He is the policeman to whom I talked\"); but in informal usage \"whom\" is often replaced by \"who\".\n\nIn English, as in some other languages (such as French; see below), [[restrictiveness|non-restrictive]] relative clauses are set off with commas, but restrictive ones are not:\n\n*\"I met a man and a woman yesterday. The woman, ''who had a thick French accent'', was very pretty.\" (non-restrictive\u2014does not narrow down who is being talked about)\n*\"I met two women yesterday, one with a thick French accent and one with a mild Italian one. The woman ''who had the thick French accent'' was very pretty.\" (restrictive\u2014adds information about who is being referred to)\n\nThe status of \"that\" as a relative pronoun is not universally agreed. Traditional grammars treat \"that\" as a relative pronoun, but not all contemporary grammars do: e.g. the [[Cambridge Grammar of the English Language]] (pp.&nbsp;1056\u20137) makes a case for treating \"that\" as a subordinator instead of a relative pronoun; and the [[British National Corpus]] treats \"that\" as a subordinating conjunction even when it introduces relative clauses. One motivation for the different treatment of \"that\" is that there are differences between \"that\" and \"which\" (e.g., one can say \"in which\" but not \"in that\", etc.).\n\n====French====\nThe system of relative pronouns in [[French language|French]] is as complicated as, but similar in many ways to, the system in English.\n\nWhen the pronoun is to act as the direct object of the relative clause, ''{{lang|fr|que}}'' is generally used, although ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'', which is inflected for grammatical gender and number, is sometimes used in order to give more precision. For example, any of the following is correct and would translate to \"I talked to his/her father and mother, whom I already knew\":\n\n:''{{lang|fr|J'ai parl\u00e9 avec son p\u00e8re et sa m\u00e8re, '''laquelle''' (f. sing.) je connaissais d\u00e9j\u00e0.}}''\n:''{{lang|fr|J'ai parl\u00e9 avec son p\u00e8re et sa m\u00e8re, '''lesquels''' (m. pl.) je connaissais d\u00e9j\u00e0.}}''\n:''{{lang|fr|J'ai parl\u00e9 avec son p\u00e8re et sa m\u00e8re, '''que''' je connaissais d\u00e9j\u00e0.}}''\n\nHowever, in the first sentence, \"whom I already knew\" refers only to the mother; in the second, it refers to both parents; and in the third, as in the English sentence, it could refer either only to the mother, or to both parents.\n\nWhen the pronoun is to act as the subject of the relative clause, ''{{lang|fr|qui}}'' is generally used, though as before, ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' may be used instead for greater precision. (This is less common than the use of ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' with direct objects, however, since verbs in French often reflect the grammatical number of their subjects.)\n\nContrary to English, the relative pronoun can never be omitted in French, not even when the relative clause is embedded in another relative clause.\n:Here is what I think '''\u00d8''' happened.\n:''{{lang|fr|Voil\u00e0 ce que je crois '''qui''' est arriv\u00e9.}}'' (literally: \"Here is what I think '''that''' happened.\")\n\nWhen the pronoun is to act in a possessive sense, where the preposition ''de'' (of/from) would normally be used, the pronoun ''{{lang|fr|dont}}'' (\"whose\") is used, but does not act as a [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]] for the noun \"possessed\":\n\n:''{{lang|fr|J'ai parl\u00e9 avec une femme '''dont''' le fils est mon coll\u00e8gue.}}'' (\"I spoke with a woman whose son I work with.\" - ''lit.'', \"I spoke with a woman ''of whom'' the son is my colleague.\")\n\nThis construction is also used in non-possessive cases where the pronoun replaces an object marked by ''{{lang|fr|de}}'':\n\n:''{{lang|fr|C'est l'homme '''dont''' j'ai parl\u00e9.}}'' (\"That's the man '''of whom''' I spoke.\")\n\nMore generally, in modern French, ''{{lang|fr|dont}}'' can signal the topic of the following clause, without replacing anything in this clause:\n\n:''{{lang|fr|C'est un homme '''dont''' je crois qu'il doit tr\u00e8s bien gagner sa vie.}}'' (\"That's a man '''about whom''' I believe that he must make a lot of money.\")\n\nWhen the pronoun is to act as the object of a preposition (other than when ''{{lang|fr|dont}}'' is used), ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' is generally used, though ''{{lang|fr|qui}}'' can be used if the antecedent is human.\n\n:''{{lang|fr|Ce sont des gens '''sur lesquels''' on peut compter.}}'' (\"These are people '''that''' can be depended '''on'''.\") [literally: \"'''on whom''' one can depend\"]\n:''{{lang|fr|Ce sont des gens '''sur qui''' on peut compter.}}''\n\n:''{{lang|fr|C'est une table '''sur laquelle''' on peut mettre beaucoup de choses.}}'' (\"This is a table '''on which''' you can put a lot of things\")\n:<nowiki>*</nowiki>''C'est une table sur qui on peut mettre beaucoup de choses.''\n\nThere exists a further complication when the antecedent is a non-human indefinite pronoun. In that case, ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' cannot be used because it must agree in gender with its head, and an indefinite pronoun has no gender. Instead, ''{{lang|fr|quoi}}'', which usually means \"what\", is used.\n:''{{lang|fr|C'est manifestement <u>quelque chose</u> '''\u00e0 quoi''' il a beaucoup r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi.}}'' (\"This is obviously <u>something</u> '''that '''he has thought a lot '''about '''.\")\n:<nowiki>*</nowiki>''C'est manifestement quelque chose \u00e0 laquelle il a beaucoup r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi.''\n\nThe same happens when the antecedent is an entire clause, also lacking gender.\n:''{{lang|fr|Il m'a dit d'aller me faire voir, '''\u00e0 quoi''' j'ai r\u00e9pondu que...}}'' (\"He told me to get lost, '''to which''' I replied that ...\")\n\nThe preposition always appears before the pronoun, and the prepositions ''{{lang|fr|de}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|\u00e0}}'' (at/to) contract with ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' to form ''{{lang|fr|duquel}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|auquel}}'', or with ''{{lang|fr|lesquel(le)s}}'' to form ''{{lang|fr|desquel(le)s}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|auxquel(le)s}}''.\n\n====German====\n[[File:Intonation of German restrictive relative clauses.jpg|thumb|350px|right|[[Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation]] of [[German language|German]] [[#Restrictive and non-restrictive|restrictive relative clauses]]]]Aside from their highly inflected forms, [[German language|German]] relative pronouns are less complicated than English. There are two varieties. The more common one is based on the definite article ''der'', ''die'', ''das'', but with distinctive forms in the genitive (''dessen'', ''deren'') and in the dative plural (''denen''). Historically this is related to English ''that''. The second, which is more literary and used for emphasis, is the relative use of ''welcher'', ''welche'', ''welches'', comparable with English ''which''. As in most Germanic languages, including Old English, both of these varieties inflect according to gender, case and number. They take their gender and number from the noun which they modify, but the case from their function in their own clause.\n\n:''Das Haus, in dem ich wohne, ist sehr alt.''\n::The house in which I live is very old.\n\nThe relative pronoun ''dem'' is neuter singular to agree with ''Haus'', but dative because it follows a preposition in its own clause. On the same basis, it would be possible to substitute the pronoun ''welchem''.\n\nHowever, German uses the uninflecting ''was'' ('what') as a relative pronoun when the antecedent is ''alles'', ''etwas'' or ''nichts'' ('everything', 'something', 'nothing'.).\n\n:''Alles, was Jack macht, gelingt ihm.''\n::Everything that Jack does is a success.\n\nIn German, all relative clauses are marked with commas.\n\nAlternatively, particularly in formal registers, participles (both active and passive) can be used to embed relative clauses in adjectival phrases:\n\n:''Die von ihm in jenem Stil gemalten Bilder sind sehr begehrt''\n::The pictures he painted in that style are highly sought after\n:''Die Regierung m\u00f6chte diese im letzten Jahr eher langsam wachsende Industrie weiter f\u00f6rdern''\n::The government would like to further promote this industry, which has grown rather slowly over the last year\n\nUnlike English, which only permits relatively small participle phrases in adjectival positions (typically just the participle and adverbs), and disallows the use of direct objects for active participles, German sentences of this sort can embed clauses of arbitrary complexity.\n\n====Spanish====\nSee [[Spanish pronouns#Relative pronouns|Relative pronouns]] in the Spanish pronouns article.\n\n====Latin====\nIn [[Latin]], relative clauses follow the noun phrases they modify, and are always introduced using relative pronouns. Relative pronouns, like other pronouns in Latin, agree with their antecedents in [[grammatical gender|gender]] and [[grammatical number|number]], but not in [[grammatical case|case]]: a relative pronoun's case reflects its role in the relative clause it introduces, while its antecedent's case reflects the antecedent's role in the clause that contains the relative clause. (Nonetheless, it is possible for the pronoun and antecedent to be in the same case.) For example:\n\n:'''''Urb\u0113s''', '''quae''' sunt magnae, videntur. (''The '''cities''', '''which''' are large, are being seen.'')\n:'''''Urb\u0113s''', '''qu\u0101s''' v\u012bd\u012b, erant magnae.'' (''The '''cities''', '''which''' I saw, were large.'')\n\nIn the former example, ''urb\u0113s'' and ''quae'' both function as [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] in their respective clauses, so both are in the nominative case; and due to gender and [[number agreement]], both are feminine and plural. In the latter example, both are still feminine and plural, and ''urb\u0113s'' is still in the nominative case, but ''quae'' has been replaced by ''qu\u0101s'', its accusative-case counterpart, to reflect its role as the [[direct object]] of ''v\u012bd\u012b''.\n\nFor more information on the forms of Latin relative pronouns, ''see'' [[Latin declension#Relative pronouns|the section on relative pronouns in the article on Latin declension]].\n\n====Ancient Greek====\n[[Ancient Greek]] follows the same rule as Latin.\n\n*\u03b1\u1f31 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, \u1f03\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd, \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c3\u03af\u03bd.\n:hai p\u00f3leis, h\u00e0s e\u00eedon, meg\u00e1lai eisin.\n:The cities that I saw are large.\n\nThe Ancient Greek relative pronoun \u1f45\u03c2, \u1f25, \u1f45 (''h\u00f3s, h\u0113&#769;, h\u00f3'') is unrelated to the Latin word, since it derives from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] {{PIE|*yos}}: in [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]], ''y'' before a vowel usually changed to ''h'' ([[debuccalization]]). [[Cognate]]s include [[Sanskrit]] relative pronouns ''yas, y\u0101, yad'' (where ''o'' changed to short ''a'').<ref>{{LSJ|o(/s1|\u1f45\u03c2|ref}}</ref>\n\nThe Greek definite article \u1f41, \u1f21, \u03c4\u03cc (''ho, h\u0113, t\u00f3'') has a different origin, since it is related to the Sanskrit demonstrative ''sa, s\u0101'' and [[Latin]] ''is-tud''.<ref>{{LSJ|o(1|\u1f41|shortref}}</ref>\n\nInformation that in English would be encoded with relative clauses could be represented with complex participles in Ancient Greek.

A direct relative clause is used where the relativized element is the subject or the direct object of its clause (e.g. \"the man ''who'' saw me\", \"the man ''whom'' I saw\"), while an indirect relative clause is used where the relativized element is a genitival (e.g. \"the man ''whose'' daughter is in the hospital\") or is the object of a preposition (e.g. \"the man ''to whom'' I gave the book\"). Direct relative clauses are formed with a [[relative pronoun]] (unmarked for case) at the beginning; a gap (in terms of syntactic theory, a [[trace (linguistics)|trace]], indicated by (''t)'' in the examples below) is left in the relative clause at the pronoun's expected position.\n\n;Irish\n{|\n| an || fear || a || chonaic || (''t)'' || m\u00e9\n|-\n| the || man || DIR-REL || saw || || me\n|-\n| colspan=6 | \"the man who saw me\"\n|}\n;Welsh\n{|\n| y || dyn || a || welais\n|-\n| the || man || DIR-REL || I saw\n|-\n| colspan=4 | \"the man whom I saw\"\n|}\n\nThe direct relative particle \"a\" is not used with \"mae\" (\"is\") in Welsh; instead the form \"sydd\" or \"sy'\" is used:\n\n{|\n| y || dyn || sy'n || blewog || iawn\n|-\n| the || man || DIR-REL + is || hairy || very \n|-\n| colspan=5 | \"the man who is very hairy\"\n|}\n\nThere is also a defective verb \"piau\" (usually lenited to \"biau\"), corresponding to \"who own(s)\":\n\n{|\n| y || dyn || piau || castell || anferth\n|-\n| the || man || DIR-REL + owns || castle || huge \n|-\n| colspan=5 | \"the man who owns a huge castle\"\n|}\n\nIndirect relative clauses are formed with a [[relativizer]] at the beginning; the relativized element remains ''in situ'' in the relative clause.\n\n;Irish\n{|\n| an || fear || a || bhfuil || a || in\u00edon || san || ospid\u00e9al\n|-\n| the || man || IND-REL || is || his || daughter || in the || hospital\n|-\n| colspan=8 | \"the man whose daughter is in the hospital\"\n|}\n;Welsh\n{|\n| y || dyn || y || rhois || y || llyfr || iddo\n|-\n| the || man || IND-REL || I gave || the || book || to him\n|-\n| colspan=7 | \"the man to whom I gave the book\"\n|}\n\nAlthough both the Irish relative pronoun and the relativizer are 'a', the relative pronoun triggers lenition of a following consonant, while the relativizer triggers eclipsis (see [[Irish initial mutations]]).\n\nBoth direct and indirect relative particles can be used simply for emphasis, often in answer to a question or as a way of disagreeing with a statement. For instance, the Welsh example above, \"y dyn a welais\" means not only \"the man whom I saw\", but also \"it was the man (and not anyone else) I saw\"; and \"y dyn y rhois y llyfr iddo\" can likewise mean \"it was the man (and not anyone else) to whom I gave the book\".\n\n===Semitic languages===\n\n====Hebrew====\nIn [[Biblical Hebrew language|Biblical Hebrew]], relative clauses were headed with the word ''asher'', which could be either a [[relative pronoun]] or a [[relativizer]]. In later times, ''asher'' became interchangeable with the prefix ''she-'' (which is also used as a conjunction, with the sense of English ''that''), and in [[Modern Hebrew language|Modern Hebrew]], this use of ''she-'' is much more common than ''asher'', except in some formal, archaic, or poetic writing. In meaning, the two are interchangeable; they are used regardless of whether the clause is modifying a human, regardless of their grammatical case in the relative clause, and regardless of whether the clause is restrictive.\n\nFurther, because Hebrew does not generally use its word for ''is'', ''she-'' is used to distinguish adjective phrases used in epithet from adjective phrases used in attribution:\n\n:''Ha-kise l'-yad-kha.'' (\"The chair is next to you.\" - ''lit.'', \"The-chair [is] to-hand-your.\")\n:''Ha-kise '''she-'''l'-yad-kha shavur.'' (\"The chair next to you is broken.\"\u2014''lit.'', \"The-chair '''that'''-[is]-to-hand-your [is] broken.\")\n\n(This use of ''she-'' does not occur with simple adjectives, as Hebrew has a different way of making that distinction. For example, ''Ha-kise adom'' means \"The chair [is] red,\" while ''Ha-kis'e ha-adom shavur'' means \"The red chair is broken\"\u2014literally, \"The chair the red [is] broken.\")\n\nSince 1994, the official rules of Modern Hebrew (as determined by the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]) have stated that relative clauses are to be punctuated in Hebrew the same way as in English (described above). That is, non-restrictive clauses are to be set off with commas, while restrictive clauses are not:\n\n:''Ha-kise, '''she-'''ata yoshev alav, shavur.'' (\"The chair, '''which''' you are sitting on, is broken.\")\n:''Ha-kise '''she-'''ata yoshev alav shavur.'' (\"The chair '''that''' you are sitting on is broken.\")\n\nNonetheless, many, perhaps most, speakers of Modern Hebrew still use the pre-1994 rules, which were based on the German rules (described above). Except for the simple adjective-phrase clauses described above, these speakers set off all relative clauses, restrictive or not, with commas:\n\n:''Ha-kise, '''she-'''ata yoshev alav, shavur.'' (\"The chair '''that''' you are sitting on is broken,\" ''or'' \"The chair, '''which''' you are sitting on, is broken.\")\n\nOne major difference between relative clauses in Hebrew and those in (for example) English is that in Hebrew, what might be called the \"regular\" pronoun is not always suppressed in the relative clause. To reuse the prior example:\n\n:''Ha-kise, '''she-'''ata yoshev '''alav''', shavur.'' (''lit.'', \"The chair, '''which''' you are sitting '''on it''', [is] broken.\")\n\nMore specifically, if this pronoun is the subject of the relative clause, it is always suppressed. If it is the direct object, then it is usually suppressed, though it is also correct to leave it in. (If it is suppressed, then the special preposition ''et'', used to mark the direct object, is suppressed as well.) If it is the object of a preposition, it must be left in, because in Hebrew\u2014unlike in English\u2014a preposition cannot appear without its object. When the pronoun is left in, ''she-'' might more properly be called a [[relativizer]] than a relative pronoun.\n\nThe [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[relativizer]] ''she-'' \u2018that\u2019 \"might be a shortened form of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[relativizer]] ''\u2018asher'' \u2018that\u2019, which is related to [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''\u2018ashru'' \u2018place\u2019 (cf. Semitic *''\u2018athar'') Alternatively, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''\u2018asher'' derived from ''she-'', or it was a convergence of Proto-Semitic ''dhu'' (cf. Aramaic ''d\u012b'') and ''\u2018asher'' [...] Whereas [[Israeli Hebrew|Israeli]] ''she-'' functions both as [[complementizer]] and [[relativizer]], ''ash\u00e9r'' can only function as a [[relativizer]].\"<ref>A quote from p. 79 of [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2006), \"Complement Clause Types in Israeli\", ''Complementation: A Cross-Linguistic Typology'', edited by [[R.

Aikhenvald]], [[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 72-92 (Chapter 3).</ref>\n\n====Arabic====\n\n=====Literary Arabic=====\nIn [[Modern Standard Arabic|Modern Standard]] and [[Classical Arabic]] there is a relative pronoun (in Arabic: {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0635\u0648\u0644}} {{transl|ar|DIN|''al-ism al-maw\u1e63\u016bl''}}) ''alla\u1e0f\u012b'' (masculine singular), feminine singular ''allat\u012b'', masculine plural ''alla\u1e0f\u012bna'', feminine plural ''allaw\u0101t\u012b'', masculine dual ''alla\u1e0f\u0101n\u012b'' (nominative) / ''alla\u1e0fayni'' (accusative and genitive), feminine dual ''allat\u0101n\u012b'' (nom.) / ''allatayn\u012b'' (acc. and gen.).\n\nIts usage has two specific rules: it agrees with the antecedent in gender, number and case, and it is used only if the antecedent is definite. If the antecedent is indefinite, no relative pronoun is used. The former is called ''jumlat sila'' (conjunctive sentence) while the latter is called ''jumlat sifa'' (descriptive sentence).\n\n*{{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0631\u0623\u064a\u062a\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641 \u0623\u0645\u0633 \u063a\u0627\u0626\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 }}\n:''al-waladu (a)lladhi ra\u2019aytuhu f\u012b (a)\u1e63-\u1e63affi \u2019amsi \u0121\u0101\u2019ibun al-yawma''\n:\"The boy I saw in class yesterday is missing today\".

(relative pronoun absent)\n\n=====Colloquial Arabic=====\nIn Colloquial Arabic the multiple forms of the relative pronoun have been levelled in favour of a single form, a simple conjunction, which in most dialects is ''illi'', and is never omitted. So in Palestinian Arabic the above sentences would be:\n\n* ''alwalad illi shuft\u014d fi (a)ssaff emb\u0101rih gh\u0101yeb aly\u014dm''\n* ''h\u0101da walad illi shuft\u014d fi (a)ssaff emb\u0101rih''\n\nAs in Hebrew, the regular pronoun referring to the antecedent is repeated in the relative clause - literally, \"the boy whom I saw '''him''' in class...\" (the ''-hu'' in ''ra'aituhu'' and the ''-\u014d'' in ''shuft\u014d''). The rules of suppression in Arabic are identical to those of Hebrew: obligatory suppression in the case that the pronoun is the subject of the relative clause, obligatory retention in the case that the pronoun is the object of a preposition, and at the discretion of the speaker if the pronoun is the direct object. The only difference from Hebrew is that, in the case of the direct object, it is preferable to retain the pronoun rather than suppress it.\n\n===Japonic languages===\n\n====Japanese====\nJapanese does not employ relative pronouns to relate relative clauses to their antecedents. Instead, the relative clause directly modifies the noun phrase as an [[attributive verb]], occupying the same syntactic space as an attributive adjective (before the noun phrase).\n\n:\u3053\u306e\u3000\u304a\u3044\u3057\u3044\u3000\u5929\u3077\u3089\n:''kono oishii tempura''\n:\"this delicious [[tempura]]\"\n\n:\u59c9\u304c\u3000\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u3000\u5929\u3077\u3089\n:''ane-ga tsukutta tempura''\n:''sister-SUBJ make-PAST tempura''\n:\"the tempura [that] my sister made\"\n\n:\u5929\u3077\u3089\u3092\u3000\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3000\u4eba\n:''tempura-o tabeta hito''\n:''tempura-OBJ eat-PAST person''\n:\"the person who ate the tempura\"\n\nIn fact, since so-called ''i-adjectives'' in Japanese are technically intransitive stative verbs, it can be argued that the structure of the first example (with an adjective) is the same as the others.

In (1a) below, ''lalaki'' 'man' serves as the head, while ''nagbigay ng bigas sa bata'' 'gave rice to the child' is the relative clause.\n\n:{|\n| (1) || a. || '''lalaki''' || =ng || nagbigay || ____ || ng || bigas || sa || bata\n|-\n|  ||  || man || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|act}}.gave ||  || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=8 | \"man that gave rice to the child\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || b. || Nagbigay || ''ang'' || ''lalaki'' || ng || bigas || sa || bata.\n|-\n|  ||  || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|nom}} || man || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=8 | \"The man gave rice to the child.\"\n|}\n\nThe gap inside the relative clause corresponds to the position that the noun acting as the head would have normally taken, had it been in a [[Sentence (linguistics)#By purpose|declarative sentence]]. In (1a), the gap is in subject position within the relative clause. This corresponds to the subject position occupied by ''ang lalaki'' 'the man' in the declarative sentence in (1b).\n\nThere is a constraint in Tagalog on the position from which a noun can be relativised and in which a gap can appear: A noun has to be the subject within the relative clause in order for it to be relativised. The phrases in (2) are ungrammatical because the nouns that have been relativised are not the subjects of their respective relative clauses. In (2a), the gap is in direct object position, while in (2b), the gap is in indirect object position.\n\n:{|\n| (2) || a. || * || '''bigas''' || na || nagbigay || ang || lalaki || ____ || sa || bata\n|-\n|  ||  ||  || rice || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|nom}} || man ||  || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  ||  || colspan=8 | for:  \"rice that the man gave to the child\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || b. || * || '''bata''' || =ng || nagbigay || ang || lalaki || ng || bigas || ____\n|-\n|  ||  ||  || child || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|nom}} || man || {{sc|acc}} || rice ||\n|-\n|  ||  ||  || colspan=8 | for:  \"child that the man gave rice to\"\n|}\n\nThe correct Tagalog translations for the intended meanings in (2) are found in (3), where the verbs have been passivised in order to raise the logical direct object in (3a) and the logical indirect object in (3b) to subject position.  (Tagalog can have more than one [[Tagalog grammar#Trigger .28voice .2F focus.29|passive voice]] form for any given verb.)\n\n:{|\n| (3) || a. || '''bigas''' || na || ibinigay || ng || lalaki || sa || bata\n|-\n|  ||  || rice || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|psv}}.gave || {{sc|gen}} || man || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"rice that the man gave to the child\"\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | (or:  \"rice that was given to the child by the man\")\n|-\n|  || b. || '''bata''' || =ng || binigyan || ng || lalaki || ng || bigas\n|-\n|  ||  || child || {{sc|comp}} || gave.{{sc|psv}} || {{sc|gen}} || man || {{sc|acc}} || rice\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"child that the man gave rice to\"\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | (or:  \"child that was given rice to by the man\")\n|}\n\nTagalog relative clauses can be left-headed, as in (1a) and (3), right-headed, as in (4), or internally headed, as in (5).\n\n:{|\n| (4) || nagbigay || ng || bigas || sa || bata || na || '''lalaki'''\n|-\n|   || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|dat}} || child || {{sc|comp}} || man\n|-\n|  || colspan=7 | \"man that gave rice to the child\"\n|}\n\n:{|\n| (5) || a. || nagbigay || na || '''lalaki''' || ng || bigas || sa || bata\n|-\n|   ||  || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|comp}} || man || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"man that gave rice to the child\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || b. || nagbigay || ng || bigas || na || '''lalaki''' || sa || bata\n|-\n|   ||  || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|comp}} || man || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"man that gave rice to the child\"\n|}\n\nIn (4), the head, ''lalaki'' 'man', is found after or to the right of the relative clause, ''nagbigay ng bigas sa bata'' 'gave rice to the child'. In (5), the head is found in some position inside the relative clause. When the head appears to the right of or internally to the relative clause, the complementiser appears to the left of the head. When the head surfaces to the left of the relative clause, the complementiser surfaces to the right of the head.\n\nThere are exceptions to the subjects-only constraint to relativisation mentioned above. The first involves relativising the [[Possession (linguistics)|possessor]] of a noun phrase within the relative clause.\n\n:{|\n| (6) || '''bata''' || =ng || nasugatan || ang || daliri || ____\n|-\n|   || child || {{sc|comp}} || injured.{{sc|psv}} || {{sc|nom}} || finger ||\n|-\n|  || colspan=6 | \"child whose finger was injured\"\n|}\n\nIn (6), the head, ''bata'' 'child', is the owner of the injured finger. The phrase ''ang daliri'' 'the finger' is the subject of the verb, ''nasugatan'' 'was injured'.\n\nAnother exception involves relativising the [[Oblique case|oblique]] noun phrase.\n\n:{|\n| (7) || a. || '''ospital''' || (na) || kung || saan || ipinanganak || si || Juan\n|-\n|  ||  || hospital || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|q-comp}} || where || {{sc|psv}}.bore || {{sc|nom}} || Juan\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"hospital where Juan was born\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || b. || Nagtanong || siya || kung || saan || ipinanganak || si || Juan.\n|-\n|  ||  || {{sc|act}}.asked || {{sc|3sg.nom}} || {{sc|q-comp}} || where || {{sc|psv}}.bore || {{sc|nom}} || Juan\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"She asked where Juan was born.\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || c. || Ipinanganak || si || Juan || ''sa'' || ''ospital''.\n|-\n|   ||  || {{sc|psv}}.bore || {{sc|nom}} || Juan || {{sc|loc}} || hospital\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"Juan was born at the hospital.\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || d. || Saan || ipinanganak || si || Juan?\n|-\n|   ||  || where || {{sc|psv}}.bore || {{sc|nom}} || Juan\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"Where was Juan born?\"\n|}\n\nWhen an oblique noun phrase is relativised, as in (7a), ''na'' 'that', the complementiser that separates the head from the relative clause, is optional. The relative clause itself is also composed differently. In the examples in (1a), and in (3) to (6), the relative clauses are simple declaratives that contain a gap. However, the relative clause in (7a) looks more like an [[Indirect speech|indirect]] [[Sentence (linguistics)#By purpose|question]], complete with the [[Sentence (linguistics)#By purpose|interrogative]] complementiser, ''kung'' 'if', and a pre-verbally positioned [[Interrogative word|WH-word]] like ''saan'' 'where', as in (7b). The sentence in (7c) is the declarative version of the relative clause in (7a), illustrating where the head, ''ospital'' 'hospital', would have been \"before\" relativisation. The question in (7d) shows the direct question version of the [[Dependent clause|subordinate]] indirect question in (7b).\n\n====Hawaiian====\n\nRelative clauses in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]<ref>Alexander, W. D., ''Introduction to Hawaiian Grammar'', Dover, 2004 (originally 1864): 45-47.</ref>  are avoided unless they are short.\n\nIf in English a relative clause would have a copula and an adjective, in Hawaiian the antecedent is simply modified by the adjective: \"The honest man\" instead of \"the man who is honest\". If the English relative clause would have a copula and a noun, in Hawaiian an appositive is used instead: \"Paul, an apostle\" instead of \"Paul, who was an apostle\".\n\nIf the English relative pronoun would be the subject of an intransitive or passive verb, in Hawaiian a participle is used instead of a full relative clause:  \"the people fallen\" instead of \"the people who fell\"; \"the thing given\" instead of \"the thing that was given\". But when the relative clause's antecedent is a person, the English relative pronoun would be the subject of the relative clause, and the relative clause's verb is active and transitive, a relative clause is used and it begins with the relative pronoun ''nana'': ''The one who me (past) sent'' = \"the one who sent me\".\n\nIf in English a relative pronoun would be the object of a relative clause, in Hawaiian the possessive form is used so as to treat the antecedent as something possessed: ''the things of me to have seen'' = \"the things that I saw\"; ''Here is theirs to have seen'' = This is what they saw\".\n\n===Andean languages===\n\n====Aymara====\n{|\n| thuqu\u00f1ap || punchu\n|-\n| dance-INF-3POSS || poncho\n|-\n| colspan=6 | \"the poncho he is dancing with\"\n|}\n\n===Chinese===\n\n====Mandarin====\n{{further|Chinese grammar}}\nIn [[Mandarin Chinese]], the relative clause is similar to other adjectival phrases in that it precedes the noun that it modifies, and ends with the relative particle ''de''.

''Pidgin Grammar'', Bess Press, 2003: pp. 102ff.</ref> As in English, a relative pronoun that serves as the object of the verb in the relative clause can optionally be omitted: For example,\n\n:''Ai neva si da buk daet Lisa wen bai''\n:I never see the book that Lisa (past) buy\n:I didn't see the book that Lisa bought\n\ncan also be expressed with the relative pronoun omitted, as\n\n:''Ai neva si da buk Lisa wen bai''\n:I never see the book Lisa (past) buy\n:I didn't see the book Lisa bought\n\nHowever, relative pronouns serving as the subject of a relative clause show more flexibility than in English; they can be included, as is mandatory in English, they can be omitted, or they can be replaced by another pronoun. For example, all of the following can occur and all mean the same thing:\n\n:''Get wan nada grl hu no kaen ste stil''\n:There's one other girl who no can stay still\n:There's another girl who cannot stay still\n\n:''Get wan nada grl no kaen ste stil''\n:There's one other girl no can stay still\n\n:''Get wan nada grl shi no kaen ste stil''\n:There's one other girl she no can stay still\n\n====Gullah====\n\nIn [[Gullah language|Gullah]], an English-based creole spoken along the southeastern coast of the United States, no relative pronoun is normally used for the subject of a relative clause. For example:\n\n:''Duh him cry out so''\n:It him cry out so\n:It's he who cries out so\n\n:''Enty duh dem shum dey?''\n:Ain't it them saw_him there?\n:Isn't it they who saw him there?\n\n==See also==\n*[[Long-distance dependencies]]\n*[[Reduced relative clause]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n*[[Rodney Huddleston]] and [[Geoffrey Pullum|Geoffrey K.

Shown here are the Madonna and Child from Kells (folio 7v).]]\n\n===Early history===\nThe first University of Dublin (known as the [[Medieval University of Dublin]] and unrelated to the current university) was created by [[Pope Clement V|the Pope]] in 1311,<ref>London: Newman, Cardinal Henry; The Rise and Progress of Universities, Chapter 17 (The Ancient University of Dublin), 207\u2013212</ref> and had a Chancellor, lecturers and students (granted protection by the Crown) over many years, before coming to an end at the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].\n\nFollowing this, and some debate about a new university at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's Cathedral]], in 1592 a small group of Dublin citizens obtained a charter by way of [[letters patent]] from Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]<ref group=\"Note\" name=letterspatent>\nExtracts from Letters Patent (\"First or Foundation Charter\") of Elizabeth I, 1592: \"...we...found and establish a College, mother of a (the) University, near the town of Dublin for the better education, training and instruction of Anglo-Protestant scholars and students in our realm...and also that provision should be made...for the relief and support of a provost and some fellows and scholars...it shall be called THE COLLEGE OF THE HOLY AND UNDIVIDED TRINITY NEAR DUBLIN FOUNDED BY THE MOST SERENE QUEEN ELIZABETH.

[[Parliament of Ireland|Parliament]], meeting on the other side of College Green, made generous grants for building. The first building of this period was the Old Library building, begun in 1712, followed by the Printing House and the Dining Hall. During the second half of the century, Parliament Square slowly emerged. The great building drive was completed in the early nineteenth century by Botany Bay, the square which derives its name in part from the herb garden it once contained (and which was succeeded by Trinity College's own Botanic Gardens). Following early steps in [[Catholic Emancipation]], Catholics were first allowed to apply for admission in 1793,<ref>Catholic Relief Act, 1793, section 13</ref> prior to the equivalent change at the [[University of Cambridge]] and the [[University of Oxford]]. Certain disabilities remained.   In December 1845 [[Denis Caulfield Heron]] was the subject of a hearing at Trinity College. Heron had previously been examined and, on merit, declared a scholar of the college but had not been allowed to take up his place due to his Catholic religion. Heron appealed to the Courts which issued a [[writ of mandamus]] requiring the case to be adjudicated by the [[Archbishop of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Dublin]] and the [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Primate of Ireland]].<ref>[[The Times]], ''Important Collegiate Question., Denis C. Heron'' 13 December 1845; pg3 col E</ref> The decision of [[Richard Whately]] and [[John George de la Poer Beresford]] was that Heron would remain excluded from Scholarship.<ref>The Times; ''Ireland. Protestant Alliance''; 9 January 1846; pg5 col D</ref> This decision confirmed that the legal position remained that persons who were not Anglicans (Presbyterians were also affected) could not be elected to Scholarship, Fellowship or be made a Professor. However within less than three decades of this, all disabilities imposed on Catholics were repealed as in 1873, all religious tests were abolished, except for entry to the [[divinity school]].  However, the Irish Catholic bishops responding to the increased ease, due to these changes, with which Catholics could attend an Institution which the Bishops saw as thoroughly Protestant in ethos, and in light of the establishment of the Catholic University, in 1871 implemented a general ban on Catholics entering Trinity College, with few exceptions.  \"The ban\" despite its longevity, is associated in the popular mind with [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]] [[John Charles McQuaid]] as he was made responsible for enforcing the ban from 1956 until it was rescinded by the Catholic Bishops of Ireland in 1970, shortly before McQuaid's retirement. Prior to 1956, it was the responsibility of the local Bishop.\n\n[[File:Bram Stoker1.jpg|thumb|[[Bram Stoker]]]]\n\nThe nineteenth century was also marked by important developments in the professional schools. The law school was reorganised after the middle of the century. Medical teaching had been given in the college since 1711, but it was only after the establishment of the school on a firm basis by legislation in 1800, and under the inspiration of one Macartney, that it was in a position to play its full part, with such teachers as Graves and Stokes, in the great age of Dublin medicine. The Engineering School was established in 1842 and was one of the first of its kind in Ireland and Britain.\n\n===20th century===\nIn April 1900, [[Queen Victoria]] visited College Green in Dublin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.qut.edu.au/4115/|title=Queen Victoria's Royal visit to Dublin, Ireland, 4th April - 26th April, 1900|last=L'Estrange|first=Robert Augustus Henry|date=1900|website=digitalcollections.qut.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref>\n\nWomen were admitted to Trinity College as full members for the first time in 1904. For the period from 1904 to 1907, women from Oxford and Cambridge came to Trinity College to receive their [[ad eundem degree]] and were known as [[Steamboat ladies]].\n\nIn 1907, the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]] proposed the reconstitution of the [[University of Dublin]]. A \"Dublin University Defence Committee\" was created and was successful in campaigning against any change to the status quo, while the Catholic bishops' rejection of the idea ensured its failure among the Catholic population. Chief among the concerns of the bishops was the remains of the [[Catholic University of Ireland]], which would become subsumed into a new university, which on account of Trinity College would be part Anglican. Ultimately this episode led to the creation of the [[National University of Ireland]]. Trinity College was one of the targets of the Volunteer and Citizen Army forces during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] but was successfully defended by a small number of unionist students,<ref>\"Soldiers are we\" by Charles Townshend, ''[[History Today]]'', 1 April 2006, p163-164</ref> most of whom were members of the university [[Officers' Training Corps]]. From July 1917 until March 1918 the [[Irish Convention]] met in the college in an attempt to address the political aftermath of the Easter rising. (Subsequently, following the failure of the Convention to reach \"substantial agreement\", the [[Irish Free State]] was set up in 1922.) In the post-independence period Trinity College suffered from a cool relationship with the new state.  On 3 May 1955 the [[Provost (education)|Provost]], Dr A.J. McConnell, pointed out in a piece in the ''[[Irish Times]]'' that certain state-funded County Council scholarships excluded Trinity College from the list of approved institutions.  This, he suggested, amounted to religious discrimination, which was forbidden by the constitution.\n[[File:Trinity College.jpg|thumb|Trinity College Front Square]]\n\nIn September 1908, approximately 3 months after the [[Tunguska event|Tunguska Event]], the college's Academic Registry was founded ostensibly to handle a multitude of administrative services for Trinity students<ref>{{cite web |title=TCD Academic Registry |url=https://www.tcd.ie/academicregistry/about/ |website=TCD |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>. The Academic Registry initially consisted of 3 mysterious beings who spoke only in an oddly-accented form of Russian but has swelled over the years to at least 20 individuals who do not appear to age or feel.\n\nThe School of Commerce was established in 1925, and the School of Social Studies in 1934. Also in 1934, the first female professor was appointed.\n\n1958 saw the first Catholic to reach the Board of Trinity as a Senior Fellow.\n\nIn 1962 the School of Commerce and the School of Social Studies amalgamated to form the School of Business and Social Studies. In 1969 the several schools and departments were grouped into Faculties as follows: Arts (Humanities and Letters); Business, Economic and Social Studies; Engineering and Systems Sciences; Health Sciences (since October 1977 all undergraduate teaching in dental science in the Dublin area has been located in Trinity College); Science.\n\nIn 1970 the [[Catholic Church]] lifted its ban on Catholics attending the college without special dispensation. At the same time, the Trinity College authorities invited the appointment of a Catholic chaplain to be based in the college.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.ie/~duacon/nl19-3.htm |title=IOL.ie |publisher=IOL.ie |date=22 January 2000 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> There are now two such Catholic chaplains.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcd.ie/Chaplaincy/catholic.htm |title=TCD.ie |publisher=TCD.ie |date=12 March 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105181037/http://www.tcd.ie/Chaplaincy/catholic.htm |archivedate=5 January 2010  }}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s, there was a proposal for [[University College, Dublin]], of the National University of Ireland, to become a constituent college of a newly reconstituted University of Dublin. This plan, suggested by [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]] and [[Donogh O'Malley]], was dropped after opposition by Trinity College students.\n\nFrom 1975, the Colleges of Technology that now form the [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] had their degrees conferred by the University of Dublin. This arrangement was discontinued in 1998 when the DIT obtained degree-granting powers of its own.\n\nThe [[School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences (Trinity College, Dublin)|School of Pharmacy]] was established in 1977 and around the same time, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine was transferred to [[University College, Dublin]]. Student numbers increased sharply during the 1980s and 1990s, with total enrolment more than doubling, leading to pressure on resources and subsequent investment programme.\n\nIn 1991, Thomas Noel Mitchell became the first Roman Catholic elected Provost of Trinity College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/provost/history/former-provosts/tn_mitchell.php|title=Thomas Noel Mitchell - Provost & President : Trinity College Dublin|first=Provost & President, Trinity College|last=Dublin|website=Tcd.ie|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nTrinity College is today in the centre of Dublin. At the beginning of the new century, it embarked on a radical overhaul of academic structures to reallocate funds and reduce administration costs, resulting in, for instance, the mentioned reduction from six to five to eventually three faculties under a subsequent restructuring by a later governing authority. The ten-year strategic plan prioritises four research themes with which the college seeks to compete for funding at the global level. Comparative funding statistics reviewing the difference in departmental unit costs and overall costs before and after this restructuring are not however apparent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/about/content/pdf/TCDStrategicPlan2006_English.pdf |title=TCD Strategic Plan 2006|website=Tcd.ie|accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref> The '''Hamilton Mathematics Institute''' in Trinity College, named in honour of William Rowan Hamilton, was launched in 2005 and aims to improve the international profile of Irish mathematics, to raise public awareness of mathematics and to support local mathematical research through workshops, conferences and a visitor programme.\n\n==Buildings and grounds==\n[[File:Parliament Square from the Graduates Memorial Building (GMB) - geograph.org.uk - 1742048.jpg|thumb|Parliament Square]]\nTrinity College retains a tranquil collegiate atmosphere despite its location in the centre of a capital city (and despite its being one of the most significant tourist attractions in Dublin). This is, in large part, due to the compact design of the college, whose main buildings look inwards and are arranged in large quadrangles (called squares), and the existence of only a few public entrances.\n\nThe main college grounds are approximately 190,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> (47 acres), including the Trinity College Enterprise Centre nearby, and buildings account for around 200,000 m\u00b2, ranging from works of older architecture to more modern buildings. The main entrance to the college is on the College Green, and its grounds are bounded by Nassau and Pearse Streets. The college is bisected by [[College Park, Dublin|College Park]], which has a cricket and rugby pitch.\n\n[[File:Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland (Goldsmith Hall).jpg|thumb|left|Interior courtyard of the modern Goldsmith Hall college residence]]\nThe western side of the college is older, featuring the iconic [[Campanile (Trinity College, Dublin)|Campanile]], as well as many fine buildings, including the Chapel and Examination Hall (designed by [[Sir William Chambers]]), [[Graduates Memorial Building]], [[Museum Building (Trinity College, Dublin)|Museum Building]], and the [[The Rubrics|Rubrics]], all spread across College's five squares. The [[Provost's House, Trinity College, Dublin|Provost's House]] sits a little way up from the College Front Gate such that the House is actually on [[Grafton Street]], one of the two principal shopping streets in the city, while its garden faces into the college. The [[Douglas Hyde Gallery]], a contemporary art gallery, is located in the college as is the Samuel Beckett Theatre. It hosts national and international performances and is used by the Dublin International Theatre Festival, the Dublin Dance Festival, and The Fringe Festival, among others. During the academic term it is predominantly used as a teaching and performance space for Drama students and staff.\n\nThe eastern side of the college is occupied by Science buildings, most of which are modern developments, arranged in three rows instead of quadrangles. In 2010, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked the it as one of the 15 most beautiful college grounds in the world.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/08/31/beautiful-campuses-lifestyle-education-colleges-10-university-architecture_slide_7.html | work=Forbes | title=The World's Most Beautiful College Campuses}}</ref>\n\nThe college also incorporates a number of buildings and facilities spread throughout the city, from the Politics and Sociology Departments, located on [[Dame Street]], to the Faculty of Health Sciences buildings, located at [[St. James's Hospital]] and [[Tallaght University Hospital]]. The Trinity Centre at St James's Hospital incorporates additional teaching rooms, as well as the Institute of Molecular Medicine and John Durkan Leukaemia Institute. The college also owns a large set of residences four kilometres to the south of the college on the [[Dartry Road]], in [[Rathmines]], called [[Trinity Hall, Dublin|Trinity Hall]].<ref group=\"Note\">Trinity Hall which houses 1,100 students, of whom the majority are first years.</ref>\n\nIn November 2018, the College announced plans, estimated at \u20ac230 million, to redevelop the campus and a new hub near [[Grand Canal Dock]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/innovation/trinity-college-campus-future-estates-strategy|title=Trinity College Dublin reveals \u20ac230m blueprint for the campus of the future|last=Kennedy|first=John|date=2018-11-22|website=Silicon Republic|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Trinity College Dublin, Parliament Square.jpg|750px|A panorama taken from Parliament Square.

It is no longer compulsory for students to attend these.\n\nThe chapel has been ecumenical since 1970, and is now also used daily in the celebration of Mass for the Roman Catholic members of the college. In addition to the Anglican chaplain, who is known as the Dean of Residence, there are two Roman Catholic chaplains and one Methodist chaplain. Ecumenical events are often held in the chapel, such as the annual carol service and the service of thanksgiving on Trinity Monday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Chaplaincy/|title=Chaplaincy - Trinity College Dublin|website=Tcd.ie|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Library===\n{{Main|Trinity College Library}}\n[[File:Long Room Interior, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg|thumb|The Long Room of the Old Library]]\nThe [[Trinity College Library|Library of Trinity College]] is the largest research library in Ireland. As a result of its historic standing, Trinity College Library Dublin is a [[legal deposit]] library (as per [[Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003]]) for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and has a similar standing in Irish law. The college is therefore legally entitled to a copy of every book published in Great Britain and Ireland and consequently receives over 100,000 new items every year. The library contains about five million books, including 30,000 current serials and significant collections of manuscripts, maps, and printed music. Three million books are held in the book depository, \"Stacks\", in [[Santry]], from which requests are retrieved twice daily.\n\n[[File:Trinity college library.jpg|thumb|left|The Old Library, housing the Book of Kells and other ancient manuscripts.]]\nThe Library proper is composed of several library buildings in college. The original (Old) Library is Thomas Burgh's masterpiece. A huge building, it originally towered over the university and city after its completion. Even today, surrounded by similarly scaled buildings, it is imposing and dominates the view of the university from Nassau Street. It was founded with the college and first endowed by [[James Ussher]] (1625\u201356), Archbishop of Armagh, who endowed his own valuable library, comprising several thousand printed books and manuscripts, to the college. The [[Book of Kells]] is by far the Library's most famous book and is located in the Old Library, along with the [[Book of Durrow]], the Book of Howth and other ancient texts. Also incorporating the Long Room, the Old Library is one of Ireland's biggest tourist attractions and holds thousands of rare, and in many cases very early, volumes. In the 18th century, the college received the [[Trinity College harp|Brian Boru harp]], one of the three surviving medieval Gaelic harps, and a national symbol of Ireland, which is now housed in the library.\n\n[[File:Trinity Pomodoro.jpg|thumb|Arnaldo Pomodoro's ''[[Sphere Within Sphere]]'' sculpture stands outside the Berkeley Library]]\nThe buildings referred to as the college's BLU ('''B'''erkeley '''L'''ecky '''U'''ssher) Arts library complex consist of the [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] Library in Fellow's Square, built in 1956, the Lecky Library, attached to the Arts building, and the James Ussher Library which, opening officially in 2003, overlooks College Park and houses the Glucksman Map Library. The Glucksman Library contains half a million printed maps, the largest collection of cartographic materials in Ireland. This includes the first Ordnance Surveys of Ireland, conducted in the early 19th century.\n\nThe Library also includes the [[William Rowan Hamilton|William Hamilton]] Science and Engineering Library and the [[John Stearne (physician)|John Stearne]] Medical Library, housed at St James's Hospital.\n\n===Business School===\n{{Main|Trinity Business School}}\nThe ''Trinity College Business School building'' is an \u20ac80 million construction for Trinity's Business School. It was opened on May 23, 2019 by Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar.

Patrick Prendergast has been the Provost since 2011.\n\n===Governance===\n[[File:Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland (Sculpture of George Salmon).jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of former provost [[George Salmon]] (by John Hughes) and the [[Campanile (Trinity College, Dublin)|Campanile]], both in Parliament Square]]\nThe [[body corporate]] of the college consists of the provost, [[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|fellows]] and scholars. The college is governed according to its statutes which are, in effect, the College Constitution. Statutes are of two kinds, those which originally could only be amended by Royal Charter or Royal Letters Patent, and which now can only be changed by an Act of the Oireachtas and those which can be changed by the board but only with the consent of the Fellows.  When a change requires parliamentary legislation, the customary procedure is that the Board requests the change by applying for a Private Bill. For this, the consent of the whole Body Corporate is needed, with Scholars voting alongside Fellows. An example of a change that requires parliamentary legislation is an alteration to the composition of the Board. This last happened when the governance of the college and university was revised and restated by an Act of the Oireachtas in 2000.\n\nThe Provost serves a ten-year term and is elected by a body of electors consisting essentially of all full-time academic staff, and a very small number of students. Originally the Provost was appointed for life. While the Provost was elected by the Fellows at the start, the appointment soon became a Crown one, reflecting the growing importance of the college and of the office of provost, which became both prestigious and well paid. However, as time passed it became customary that the appointments were only made after taking soundings of college opinion, which meant mostly the views of the Board. With the establishment of the Free State in 1922, the power of appointment passed to the Government. It was agreed that when a vacancy occurred the college would provide a list of three candidates to the Government, from which the choice would be made. The college was allowed to rank the candidates in order of preference and in practice, the most preferred candidate was always appointed. Now the Provost while still formally appointed by the Government is elected by staff plus student representatives, who gather in an electoral meeting, and vote by exhaustive ballot until a candidate obtains an absolute majority; the process takes a day. The Provost takes precedence over everyone else in the college, acts as the chief executive and accounting officer and chairs the board and council. The provost also enjoys a special status in the University of Dublin.\n\nFellows and scholars are elected by the board. Fellows were once elected for life on the basis of a competitive examination. The number of fellows was fixed and a competition to fill a vacancy would occur on the death or resignation of a fellow. Originally all the teaching was carried out by the Fellows. Fellows are now elected from among current college academics, serve until reaching retirement age, and there is no formal limit on their number. Only a minority of academic staff are fellows.  Election to fellowship is recognition for staff that they have excelled in their field and as such, amounts to a promotion for those receiving it. Any person appointed to a professorship who is not already a fellow, is elected a fellow at the next opportunity.\n\nScholars continue to be selected by competitive examination from the Undergraduate body. The Scholarship examination is now set according to the several undergraduate courses. (So there is a scholarship examination in History, or in Mathematics or Engineering, and so forth).  The Scholarship examination is taken in the second year of a four-year degree course (though, in special circumstances, such as illness, bereavement, or studying abroad during the second year, permission may be given to sit the examination in the third year). In theory, a student can sit the examination in any subject, not just the one they are studying. They hold their Scholarship until they are of \"MA standing\" that is, three years after obtaining the BA degree. (So most are Scholars for a term of five years).\n\nFellows are entitled to residence in the college free of charge; most fellows do not exercise this right in practice, with the legal requirement to provide accommodation to them being fulfilled by providing an office. Scholars are also entitled to residence in the college free of charge, they also receive an allowance, and have the fees paid for courses they are taking within the college. However, due to pressure on college accommodation, Scholars are no longer entitled (as they once were) to free rooms for the full duration of their scholarship should they cease to be students.  Fellows and Scholars are also entitled to one free meal a day, usually in the evening (\"Commons\"). Scholars retain the right to free meals for the full duration of their scholarship even after graduation, and ceasing to be students, should they choose to exercise it.\n\n====The Board====\nAside from the Provost, Fellows and Scholars, Trinity College has a Board (dating from 1637), which carries out general governance. Originally the Board consisted of the Provost and Senior Fellows only. There were seven Senior Fellows, defined as those seven fellows that had served longest, Fellowship at that time being for life, unless resigned. Over the years a representational element was added, for example by having elected representatives of the Junior Fellows and of those Professors who were not Fellows, with the last revision before Irish Independence being made by [[Royal Letters Patent]] in 1911. At that time there were, as well as the Senior Fellows, two elected representatives of those Professors that were not Fellows and elected representatives of the Junior Fellows. Over the years, while formal revision did not take place, partly due to the complexity of the process, a number of additional representatives were added to the Board but as \"observers\" and not full voting members. These included representatives of academic staff who were not Fellows, and representatives of students. In practice all attending Board meetings were treated as equals, with votes while not common, being taken by a show of hands. But it remained the case, that legally only the full members of the Board could have their votes recorded and it was mere convention that they always ratified the decision taken by the show of hands.\n\nThe governance of Trinity College was next formally changed in 2000, by the [[Oireachtas]], in legislation proposed by the Board of the college, and approved by the Body Corporate viz ''The Trinity College, Dublin (Charters and Letters Patent Amendment) Act, 2000''. This was introduced separately from the Universities Act 1997. It states that the Board shall comprise:\n* The Provost, Vice-Provost/Chief Academic Officer, Senior Lecturer, Registrar and Bursar;\n* Six Fellows;\n* Five members of the academic staff who are not Fellows, at least three of whom must be of a rank not higher than senior lecturer;\n* Two members of the academic staff of the rank of professor;\n* Three members of the non-academic staff;\n* Four students of the college, at least one of whom shall be a post-graduate student;\n* One member, not an employee or student of the college, chosen by a Board committee from nominations made by organisations \"representative of such business or professional interest as the Board considers appropriate\";\n* One member nominated by the [[Minister for Education and Skills]] following consultation with the Provost.\n\nThe fellows, non-fellow academic staff as well as non-academic staff are elected to serve for a fixed term. The four student members are the President, Education Officer and Welfare Officer of the Students' Union and the president of the Graduate Students' Union (all ex officio) and are elected annually for one-year terms. The vice-provost/chief academic officer, senior lecturer, registrar and bursar are 'annual officers' appointed for one-year (renewable) terms by the Provost. The two significant changes are that the Senior Fellows are no longer on the Board and that two members of the Board are now drawn from without the college.\n\n====The Council====\nThere is a Council (dating from 1874), which oversees academic matters. All decisions of the Council require the approval of the Board, but if the decision in question does not require a new expenditure, the approval is normally formal, without debate. The Council had a significant number of elected representatives from the start, and was also larger than the Board, which at that time, continued to consist of the Provost and seven Senior Fellows only. The Council is the formal body which makes academic staff appointments, always, in practice on the recommendation of appointments panels, but which have themselves been appointed by the Council. An illustration of the relationship between the Board and the Council, is where a decision is made to create a new professorial chair. As this involves paying a salary, the initial decision to create the chair is made by the Council, but the decision to make provision for the salary is made by the Board, consequently, the Board might overrule, or defer a Council decision on grounds of cost.\n\n====The Senate====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Seal of the University of Dublin.png|Seal of the University Senate|thumb|upright]] -->\nThe University of Dublin was modelled on [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge]] in the form of a [[collegiate university]], Trinity College being named by the Queen as the ''mater universitatis'' (\"mother of the university\"). As no other college was ever established, the college is the sole constituent college of the university and so Trinity College and the University of Dublin are for most practical purposes synonymous. However, the actual statutes of the university and the college<ref name=\"gsu.tcd.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gsu.tcd.ie/files/Statutes-Current.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Statutes-Current.doc |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318181124/http://www.gsu.tcd.ie/files/Statutes-Current.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2009 }}</ref> grant the university separate corporate legal rights to own property and borrow money and employ staff. Moreover, while the board of the college has the sole power to propose amendments to the statutes of the university and college, amendments to the university statutes require the consent of the Senate of the university. Consequently, in theory, the Senate can overrule the Board, but only in very limited and particular circumstances. However, it is also the case that the university cannot act independently of the initiative of the Board of Trinity College. The most common example of when the two bodies must collaborate is when a decision is made to establish a new degree. All matters relating to syllabus, examination and teaching are for the college to determine, but actual clearance for the award of the degree is a matter for the university. In the same way, when an individual is awarded an Honorary Degree, the proposal for the award is made by the Board of Trinity College, but this is subject to agreement by a vote of the Senate of Dublin University. All graduates of the university who have at least a master's degree are eligible to be members of the Senate, but in practice, only a few hundred are, with a large proportion being current members of the staff of Trinity College.\n\n====Visitors====\nThe college also has an oversight structure of two visitors, the chancellor of the university, who is elected by the Senate, and the judicial visitor, who is appointed by the Irish Government from a list of two names submitted by the Senate of the university. The current judicial visitor is the Hon. Dr. Justice Maureen Harding Clark. In the event of a disagreement between the two visitors, the opinion of the chancellor prevails. The visitors act as a final \"court of appeal\" within the college, with their modes of appointment giving them the needed independence from the college administration.\n\n===Academic associations===\n[[File:Trinity-College-Campanile-Front.JPG|thumb|upright|Parliament Square: The [[Campanile (Trinity College, Dublin)|Campanile]]]]\nTrinity College is a [[sister college]] to [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]] of the [[University of Oxford]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] of the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|date=17 June 2005|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article534008.ece|title=Professor A.

Trinity College has also been associated in the past with a number of other teaching institutions. These include [[St Catherine's College of Education for Home Economics]] (now closed), [[Magee College]] and [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]], which is a music conservatoire, as well as The Lir National Academy of Dramatic Art, which is the national conservatoire for theatre training actors, technicians, playwrights and designers to a professional and industry standard \u2013 the Lir is also advised by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in the UK.\n\n===Parliamentary representation===\n{{main|University of Dublin (constituency)}}\nThe university has been linked to parliamentary representation since 1613, when [[James I of England|James I]] granted it the right to elect two members of parliament (MPs) to the [[Irish House of Commons]]. Since the new [[Constitution of Ireland]] in 1937, graduates of the university have formed a constituency which elects three [[Members of the Seanad \u00c9ireann|Senator]]s to [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]]. The current representatives of the university constituency are [[Ivana Bacik]], [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]] and [[Lynn Ruane]]. Notable representatives have included [[Edward Gibson, 1st Baron Ashbourne|Edward Gibson]], [[William Edward Hartpole Lecky|W. E. H. Lecky]], [[Edward Carson]], [[Noel Browne]], [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]] and [[Mary Robinson]]. The franchise was originally restricted to the Provost, Fellows and Scholars of Trinity College. This was expanded in 1832 to include those who had received an M.A. and in 1918 all those who had received a degree from the university.\n\n==Academic profile==\nSince considerable academic restructuring in 2008, the college has three academic faculties:\n* Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences\n* Engineering, Mathematics and Sciences\n* Health Sciences\n\nEach faculty is headed by a dean (there is also a Dean of Postgraduate Studies), and faculties are divided into schools, of which there were 24 as of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/structure/ |title=Faculties and Schools |publisher=Trinity College, Dublin |date=17 February 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Second-level programmes===\nSince 2014, Trinity College's Science Department has established and operated a scheme for second-level students to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The system, similar to [[Dublin City University|DCU's]] [[Centre for the Talented Youth of Ireland|CTYI]] programme, encourages academically gifted secondary students with a high aptitude for the [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] subjects, was named the Walton Club<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/waltonclub/|title=Trinity Walton Club|website=Tcd.ie}}</ref> in honour of [[Ernest Walton]], Ireland's first and only Nobel laureate for Physics.

First-year students at the undergraduate level are called Junior Freshmen; second years, Senior Freshmen; third years, Junior Sophisters; and fourth years, Senior Sophisters. After a proposal in 2017 by the SU Equality Committee, a three-year process changing the titles of first and second years to Junior and Senior Fresh was approved by the Trinity College Board.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Meehan|first1=Sarah|title=Undergraduate name \"Freshman\" to change to gender-neutral \"Fresh\"|url=http://trinitynews.ie/undergraduate-name-freshman-to-change-to-gender-neutral-fresh/|accessdate=28 November 2017|publisher=Trinity News|date=28 November 2017}}</ref> The Freshman Years usually have a set or minimally flexible basic curriculum with the Sophister years allowing for a much greater degree of course variation, as well as taking a year abroad. The passing of two sets of examinations is a prerequisite for a degree. Junior and Senior Freshmen sit preliminary annual exams in Trinity Term of each year which must be passed so that they \"rise\" to the year above. At the end of the Junior Sophister year, undergraduates sit Part I of the Moderatorship exams, subject to attaining an upper-second,{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} allows them to take an Honours degree and sit the Part II (Final) of the Moderatorship exams. Successful candidates receive first-, upper or lower second-, or third-class honours, or simply a \"pass\" without honours if they perform insufficiently in Part I of the Moderatorship.\n\nMost non-professional courses take a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. As a matter of tradition, bachelor's degree graduates are eligible, after nine terms from matriculation and without additional study, to purchase for a fee an upgrade of their bachelor's degree to a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]].\nThe four-year degree structure makes undergraduate teaching at Dublin closer to the North American model than that of other universities in England and Ireland (Scottish universities generally also require four years of study for a bachelor's degree).\n\nDegree titles vary according to the subject of study. The [[Trinity College Dublin Law School|Law School]] awards the [[LL.B.]], the LL.B. (ling. franc.) and the LL.B. (ling. germ.). Other degrees include the BAI (engineering) and BBS (business studies). The BSc degree is not in wide use although it is awarded by the School of Nursing and Midwifery<!-- Removed Pharmacy from this list, new course awards a BPharm and MPharm degree -->; most science and computer science students are awarded a BA.<!-- Most, there is a BSc in Computer Science evening course -->\n\nFrom 2018, Trinity will be offering dual BA programme with Columbia University in New York City. Students of History, English, European Studies or Middle Eastern and European Languages and Culture spend their first two years at Trinity and their last two years at Columbia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gs.columbia.edu/tcd/dual-ba-program|title=Dual BA Program - Trinity College Dublin|website=gs.columbia.edu}}</ref>\n\n===Graduate===\nAt postgraduate level, Trinity offers a range of taught and research degrees in all faculties. About 29% of students are post-graduate level, with 1,440 students reading for a research degree and an additional 3,260 on taught courses (see [[#Research and innovation|Research and Innovation]]).<ref name=\"HigherEducationAuthorityArchiveFullTime\"/><ref name=\"HigherEducationAuthorityArchivePartTime\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Graduate_Studies |title=Graduate Studies \u2013 Trinity College Dublin |publisher=Tcd.ie |date=15 April 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nTrinity College's Strategic Plan sets \"the objective of doubling the number of PhDs across all disciplines by 2013 in order to move towards a knowledge society. In order to achieve this, the college has received some of the largest allocations of Irish Government funding which have become competitively available to date.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/universitydublintrinitycollege |title=Topuniversities.com |publisher=Topuniversities.com |date=12 November 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080527060420/http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/universitydublintrinitycollege |archivedate = 27 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to [[academic degree]]s, the college offers [[Postgraduate Diploma]] (non-degree) qualifications, either directly, or through associated institutions.\n\n===Academic year===\nThe academic year is divided into three [[Academic term|terms]]. [[Michaelmas term]] lasts from October to December; [[Hilary term]] from January to March; and [[Trinity term]] from April to June, with each term separated by a vacation. Whilst teaching takes place across all three terms in postgraduate courses, for undergraduate programmes, teaching is condensed within the first two terms since 2009, with each term consisting of a twelve-week period of teaching known as the Teaching Term. These are followed by three revision weeks and a four-week exam period during the Trinity Term.<ref>{{cite book|title=Trinity College Academic Calendar|quote=(12 weeks each), followed by three revision weeks and a four-week exam period.}}</ref>\n\nInternally at least, the weeks in the term are often referred to by the time elapsed since the start of teaching Term: thus the first week is called \"1st week\" or \"week 1\" and the last is \"Week 12\"/\"12th week\".\n\nThe first week of Trinity Term (which marks conclusion of lecturing for that year) is known as Trinity Week; normally preceded by a string of balls, it consists of a week of sporting and academic events. This includes the Trinity Ball and the Trinity Regatta (a premier social event on the Irish rowing calendar held since 1898),<ref>{{cite web|title=Trinity Regatta \u2013 Dublin University Boat Club|url=http://www.tcdlife.ie/clubs/boat/regatta.php|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090904/http://www.tcdlife.ie/clubs/boat/regatta.php|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> the election of Scholars and Fellows and a college banquet.\n\n===Admissions===\nThe [[Central Applications Office]] processes applications from Irish, British and European Union applicants for undergraduate courses on behalf of Trinity College. Decisions on admissions to undergraduate courses are made by Trinity College who instruct the CAO to make offers to successful candidates.

Furthermore, applicants for certain courses may be required to achieve more specific qualifications than those prescribed for minimum matriculation requirements.<ref>{{cite web|author=Undergraduate Admissions (Email) |url=https://www.tcd.ie/calendar/undergraduate-studies/admission-requirements.pdf |title= Admission Requirements |publisher=Tcd.ie}}</ref>  Eligible applicants must then compete for places based on the results of their [[School leaving qualification|school leaving examinations]], however, applicants can additionally take [[matriculation examination]]s<ref>{{cite web|author=Undergraduate Admissions (Email) |url=https://www.tcd.ie/Admissions/undergraduate/assets/pdf/Matric%20Syllabus.pdf |title= Matriculation Examination Syllabus |publisher=Tcd.ie}}</ref> which are held in the university in April, in which each subject is considered equivalent to that of the [[Leaving Certificate (Ireland)|Irish Leaving Certificate]]. Applications for restricted courses<ref>{{cite web|author=Central Applications Office |url=https://www.cao.ie/index.php?page=restrictedcourses&bb=restrictions |title= Restricted-Application Courses |publisher=cao.ie}}</ref> require further assessment considered in the admissions process, such as the [[Health Professions Admissions Test]] (HPAT) for medicine or [[Educational entrance examination|entrance tests]] for music and drama courses. As applications for most courses far exceeds available places, admission is highly selective, demanding excellent grades in the aforementioned examinations. Through the [[Central Applications Office|CAO]], candidates may list several courses at Trinity College and at other third-level institutions in Ireland in order of preference. Places are awarded in mid-August every year by the [[Central Applications Office|CAO]] after matching the number of places available to the academic attainments of the applicants. Qualifications are measured as \"points\", with specific scales for the Leaving Certificate, UK GCE [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]], the [[International Baccalaureate]] and all other European Union school-leaving examinations.<ref>{{cite web|author=Undergraduate Admissions (Email) |url=http://www.tcd.ie/Admissions/undergraduate/requirements/matriculation/other/ |title=A list of EU exams and conversion ratios |publisher=Tcd.ie |date=26 February 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nFor applicants who are not citizens or residents of the [[European Union]], different application procedures apply.;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/universitydublintrinitycollege|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228220105/http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/universitydublintrinitycollege|url-status=dead|title=Topuniversities.com|archivedate=28 February 2009}}</ref> 16% of students are from outside Ireland, and 40% of these are from outside the European Union.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Disadvantaged, disabled, or mature students can also be admitted through a program that is separate from the [[Central Applications Office|CAO]], the Trinity Access Programme,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Trinity_Access |title=TCD.ie |publisher=TCD.ie |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> which aims to facilitate the entry of sectors of society which would otherwise be under-represented.

On Trinity Monday (the first day of Trinity Term), the Board of the college sits and elects to the Scholarship all those who achieve First in the examination. Election to become a scholar of Trinity Dublin is widely regarded as \u201cthe most prestigious undergraduate award in the country\u201d.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.universitytimes.ie/2019/04/58-scholars-15-fellows-and-two-honorary-fellows-elected/|title=58 Scholars, 15 Fellows and Two Honorary Fellows Elected|last=|first=|date=|work=The University Times|access-date=}}</ref> Those from EU member countries are entitled to free rooms and Commons (the college's [[Formal (university)|Formal]] Hall), an annual stipend and exemption from fees for the duration of their scholarship, which lasts for fifteen terms. Scholars from non-EU member countries have their fees reduced by the current value of EU member fees. Scholars may add the suffix \"'''SCH.'''\" to their names, have the note \"discip. schol.\" appended to their name at Commencements and are entitled to wear Bachelor's Robes and a velvet mortarboard.\n\nCompetition for Scholarship involves a searching examination and successful candidates must be of exceptional ability. The concept of scholarship is a valued tradition of the college, and many of the college's most distinguished members were elected scholars (including Samuel Beckett and Ernest Walton). The Scholars' dinner, to which 'Scholars of the decade' (those elected in the current year, and every year multiple of a decade previous to it, e.g., 2013, 2003,..) are invited, forms one of the major events in Trinity's calendar. A scholarship at Trinity College is a prestigious undergraduate award; a principal aim of the college is the pursuit of excellence, and one of the most tangible demonstrations of this is the institution of scholarship.\n\nUnder the Foundation Charter (of 1592), Scholars were part of the body corporate (three Scholars were named in the charter \"in the name of many\"). Until 1609 there were about 51 Scholars at any one time. A figure of seventy was permanently fixed in the revising Letters Patent of Charles I in 1637. Trinity Monday was appointed as the day when all future elections to Fellowship and Scholarship would be announced (at this time Trinity Monday was always celebrated on the Monday after the feast of the [[Trinity Sunday|Holy Trinity]]). Up to this point, all undergraduates were Scholars, but soon after 1637 the practice of admitting students other than Scholars commenced.\n\nUntil 1856, only the classical subjects were examined. The questions concerned all the classical authors prescribed for the entrance examination and for the undergraduate course up to the middle of the Junior Sophister year. So candidates had no new material to read, 'but they had to submit to a very searching examination on the fairly lengthy list of classical texts which they were supposed by this time to have mastered'. The close link with the undergraduate syllabus is underlined by the refusal until 1856 to admit Scholars to the Library (a request for admission was rejected by the Board in 1842 on the grounds that Scholars should stick to their prescribed books and not indulge in 'those desultory habits' that admission to an extensive library would encourage). During the second half of the nineteenth century, the content of the examination gradually came to include other disciplines.\n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, \"Non-Foundation\" Scholarships were introduced. This initially was a device to permit women to be, in effect, elected Scholars, despite the then commonly accepted legal view that the statute revision of 1637 only permitted males to be elected Foundation Scholars. Clearly, when women were not permitted in the college, this had not caused any difficulties, but with the admission of women as full members of the college, an anomaly was created. Non-Foundation Scholarship granted to the women elected to it all the rights of men, but with the exception of voting rights at a meeting of the Body Corporate, a very rare event in any case. As women are now admitted to Foundation Scholarship on exactly the same basis as men Non-Foundation Scholarships are retained as a device to allow for more than seventy persons to be Scholars at any one time provided sufficient meet the qualifying standards. Foundation Scholarships are given to those whose performance is considered particularly exceptional, with the remaining qualifying persons that year being elected as Non-Foundation Scholars. While the number of Foundation Scholars remains fixed at seventy, there is, in theory, no limit on the number of Non-Foundation scholars. Non-Foundation and Foundation Scholars receive the same benefits and therefore the two groups are regarded in equal esteem and usually refer to themselves collectively as the [[List of Scholars of Trinity College Dublin|Scholars of Trinity College Dublin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tcd.ie/calendar/undergraduate-studies/foundation-and-non-foundation-scholarships.pdf|title=Trinity College Dublin, Calendar, Undergraduate Studies Part II, Part D9, Foundation and Non-Foundation Scholarships|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> It is worth noting that when the college had only a few hundred members the Foundation Scholars could easily amount to ten per cent of the whole undergraduate body; now that the college numbers members in thousands even the addition of current numbers of Non Foundation Scholars means that the proportion of students elected Scholars is still lower than it has even been before, and being elected to Scholarship is more competitive than it was.\n\n===Research===\nTrinity College is the most productive internationally recognised research centre in Ireland.<ref>[http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/universitydublintrinitycollege Topuniversities.com] \"Interdisciplinarity forms a key element in the College strategy in increasing Trinity's international standing as a research-led university.

Student societies operate under the aegis of the Dublin University Central Societies Committee (CSC) which is composed of the Treasurers of each of the Societies within the college. Society size varies enormously, and it is often hard to determine exact figures for most societies \u2013 several claiming to be the largest in the college with thousands of members, while smaller groups may have only 40\u201350 members.\n\nSituated in the [[Graduates Memorial Building]] (GMB) are the two debating societies: [[University Philosophical Society]] (the Phil) and the [[College Historical Society]] (the Hist). The Phil meets each Thursday evening in the [[Graduates Memorial Building#Interior|chamber]] of the GMB, while the Hist meets each Wednesday evening. Both the Phil and the Hist make claims to be the oldest such [[student society]]: the Phil claims to have been founded in 1683, although university records list its foundation as having occurred in 1853,<ref name=\"College Calendar\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tcd.ie/calendar/general-information/students-unions-societies-and-clubs.pdf |title=Calendar 2016-Students' Unions, Societies and Clubs |publisher=Trinity College Dublin |date=5 October 2016 |accessdate=26 January 2017}}</ref> while the Hist was founded in 1770 (which it makes it the oldest society on campus according to the College Calendar).<ref name=\"College Calendar\" /> Among the [[University Philosophical Society#Honorary patrons|Honorary Patrons]] of the Phil are multiple [[Noble Prize]] laureates, Heads of State, notable actors, entertainers, well-known intellectuals, such as [[Al Pacino]], [[Desmond Tutu]], [[Sir Christopher Lee]], [[Stephen Fry]], and [[John Mearsheimer]]. The Hist has been addressed by many notable orators including [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Ted Kennedy]], and counts among its former members many prominent men and women in Ireland's history.\n\nOther societies include [[Vincent de Paul Society (Trinity College, Dublin)|Vincent de Paul Society]] (VDP), which organises a large number of charitable activities in the local community; DU Players, one of the most prolific student-drama societies in Europe which hosts more than 50 shows and events a year in the [[Samuel Beckett]] Theatre; [[The DU Film Society]] (Formerly DU Filmmakers, formerly the DU \"Videographic Society\", founded in 1987) which organises filmmakers and film-lovers in college through workshops, screenings, production funding, etc.; the DU Radio Society, known as [[Trinity FM]], broadcasts a variety of student made productions on a special events licence on FM frequency 107.8FM for six weeks a year; The [[Trinity LGBT]] society, which is the oldest [[LGBT]] society in Ireland and celebrated its 25th anniversary in the 2007/2008 year; The Card and Bridge Society also holds weekly poker and bridge tournaments and was the starting point to many notable alum including [[Andy Black (poker player)|Andy Black]], [[Padraig Parkinson]] and [[Donnacha O'Dea]]; the Dublin University Comedy Society, known as DU Comedy, hosts comedy events for its members and has hosted gigs in college from comedians such as [[Andrew Maxwell]], [[David O'Doherty]], [[Neil Delamere]] and [[Colin Murphy (comedian)|Colin Murphy]]; The Dance Society, known as \"{{proper name|dudance}}\", provides classes in Latin and ballroom dancing, as well as running events around other dance styles such as swing dancing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitysocieties.ie/society/31/dance-society |title=Trinitysocieties.ie |publisher=Trinitysocieties.ie |date=25 March 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029021249/http://www.trinitysocieties.ie/society/31/dance-society |archivedate=29 October 2010 }}</ref> In 2011 the [[Laurentian Society]] was revived.

Most student publications are administered by Trinity Publications, previously called the Dublin University Publications Committee (often known as 'Pubs'), which maintains and administers the Publications office (located in No 6) and all the associated equipment needed to publish newspapers and magazines.\n\nThere are two rival student newspapers in Trinity. [[Trinity College Dublin Students' Union]] funds ''[[The University Times]]''. Since its founding in 2009, the paper has consistently won national and international awards, including the award for best all-around non-daily student newspaper in the world from the US-based [[Society of Professional Journalists]]. Even though it is funded by the union, it is often critical of its activities. In 2019, Provost Patrick Prendergast said that \"The University Times has pursued an independent course in many aspects of College life, and done so fearlessly.\"\n\n''[[Trinity News]]'', meanwhile, is Ireland's oldest student newspaper, having been founded in 1953. Like ''The University Times'', it publishes both an online edition and a print edition every three weeks during the academic year. For the last 10 years the paper has been edited by a full-time student editor, who takes a sabbatical year from their studies, supported by a voluntary part-time staff of 30 student section editors and writers.\n\nStudent magazines currently in publication include the satirical newspaper ''[[The Piranha (newspaper)|The Piranha]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitypublications.info/Our%20Publications.html |title=Trinity Publications |publisher=Trinitypublications.info |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> (formerly ''Piranha!'' magazine but rebranded in 2009), the generalist ''[[T.C.D. Miscellany]]'' (founded in 1895; one of Ireland's oldest magazines), the film journal ''[[Trinity Film Review]]'' (TFR) and the literary ''[[Icarus (magazine)|Icarus]]''. Other publications include the ''Student Economic Review'' and the [[Trinity College Law Review]], produced independently by students of economics and law respectively, the ''Trinity College Journal of Postgraduate Research'', produced by the Graduate Students Union, the ''Social and Political Review'' (SPR),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spr.tcdlife.ie/ |title=Welcome to The Social and Political Review of Trinity College Dublin |publisher=Spr.tcdlife.ie |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> now in its 22nd year, the ''Trinity Student Medical Journal'',<ref>{{cite web |author=Dublin Life (Email) |url=http://www.tsmj.tcd.ie |title=TCD.ie |publisher=Tsmj.tcd.ie |date=26 August 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108195955/http://www.tsmj.tcd.ie/ |archivedate=8 January 2009  }}</ref> ''The Attic'', student writing produced by the ''Dublin University Literary Society'', the ''Afro-Caribbean Journal'' produced by the ''Afro-Caribbean Society,'' and ''grass'' an intermedial magazine based on collaboration between media.

Shown here are the Madonna and Child from Kells (folio 7v).]]\n\n===Early history===\nThe first University of Dublin (known as the [[Medieval University of Dublin]] and unrelated to the current university) was created by [[Pope Clement V|the Pope]] in 1311,<ref>London: Newman, Cardinal Henry; The Rise and Progress of Universities, Chapter 17 (The Ancient University of Dublin), 207\u2013212</ref> and had a Chancellor, lecturers and students (granted protection by the Crown) over many years, before coming to an end at the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].\n\nFollowing this, and some debate about a new university at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's Cathedral]], in 1592 a small group of Dublin citizens obtained a charter by way of [[letters patent]] from Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]<ref group=\"Note\" name=letterspatent>\nExtracts from Letters Patent (\"First or Foundation Charter\") of Elizabeth I, 1592: \"...we...found and establish a College, mother of a (the) University, near the town of Dublin for the better education, training and instruction of Anglo-Protestant scholars and students in our realm...and also that provision should be made...for the relief and support of a provost and some fellows and scholars...it shall be called THE COLLEGE OF THE HOLY AND UNDIVIDED TRINITY NEAR DUBLIN FOUNDED BY THE MOST SERENE QUEEN ELIZABETH.

[[Parliament of Ireland|Parliament]], meeting on the other side of College Green, made generous grants for building. The first building of this period was the Old Library building, begun in 1712, followed by the Printing House and the Dining Hall. During the second half of the century, Parliament Square slowly emerged. The great building drive was completed in the early nineteenth century by Botany Bay, the square which derives its name in part from the herb garden it once contained (and which was succeeded by Trinity College's own Botanic Gardens). Following early steps in [[Catholic Emancipation]], Catholics were first allowed to apply for admission in 1793,<ref>Catholic Relief Act, 1793, section 13</ref> prior to the equivalent change at the [[University of Cambridge]] and the [[University of Oxford]]. Certain disabilities remained.   In December 1845 [[Denis Caulfield Heron]] was the subject of a hearing at Trinity College. Heron had previously been examined and, on merit, declared a scholar of the college but had not been allowed to take up his place due to his Catholic religion. Heron appealed to the Courts which issued a [[writ of mandamus]] requiring the case to be adjudicated by the [[Archbishop of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Dublin]] and the [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Primate of Ireland]].<ref>[[The Times]], ''Important Collegiate Question., Denis C. Heron'' 13 December 1845; pg3 col E</ref> The decision of [[Richard Whately]] and [[John George de la Poer Beresford]] was that Heron would remain excluded from Scholarship.<ref>The Times; ''Ireland. Protestant Alliance''; 9 January 1846; pg5 col D</ref> This decision confirmed that the legal position remained that persons who were not Anglicans (Presbyterians were also affected) could not be elected to Scholarship, Fellowship or be made a Professor. However within less than three decades of this, all disabilities imposed on Catholics were repealed as in 1873, all religious tests were abolished, except for entry to the [[divinity school]].  However, the Irish Catholic bishops responding to the increased ease, due to these changes, with which Catholics could attend an Institution which the Bishops saw as thoroughly Protestant in ethos, and in light of the establishment of the Catholic University, in 1871 implemented a general ban on Catholics entering Trinity College, with few exceptions.  \"The ban\" despite its longevity, is associated in the popular mind with [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]] [[John Charles McQuaid]] as he was made responsible for enforcing the ban from 1956 until it was rescinded by the Catholic Bishops of Ireland in 1970, shortly before McQuaid's retirement. Prior to 1956, it was the responsibility of the local Bishop.\n\n[[File:Bram Stoker1.jpg|thumb|[[Bram Stoker]]]]\n\nThe nineteenth century was also marked by important developments in the professional schools. The law school was reorganised after the middle of the century. Medical teaching had been given in the college since 1711, but it was only after the establishment of the school on a firm basis by legislation in 1800, and under the inspiration of one Macartney, that it was in a position to play its full part, with such teachers as Graves and Stokes, in the great age of Dublin medicine. The Engineering School was established in 1842 and was one of the first of its kind in Ireland and Britain.\n\n===20th century===\nIn April 1900, [[Queen Victoria]] visited College Green in Dublin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.qut.edu.au/4115/|title=Queen Victoria's Royal visit to Dublin, Ireland, 4th April - 26th April, 1900|last=L'Estrange|first=Robert Augustus Henry|date=1900|website=digitalcollections.qut.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref>\n\nWomen were admitted to Trinity College as full members for the first time in 1904. For the period from 1904 to 1907, women from Oxford and Cambridge came to Trinity College to receive their [[ad eundem degree]] and were known as [[Steamboat ladies]].\n\nIn 1907, the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]] proposed the reconstitution of the [[University of Dublin]]. A \"Dublin University Defence Committee\" was created and was successful in campaigning against any change to the status quo, while the Catholic bishops' rejection of the idea ensured its failure among the Catholic population. Chief among the concerns of the bishops was the remains of the [[Catholic University of Ireland]], which would become subsumed into a new university, which on account of Trinity College would be part Anglican. Ultimately this episode led to the creation of the [[National University of Ireland]]. Trinity College was one of the targets of the Volunteer and Citizen Army forces during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] but was successfully defended by a small number of unionist students,<ref>\"Soldiers are we\" by Charles Townshend, ''[[History Today]]'', 1 April 2006, p163-164</ref> most of whom were members of the university [[Officers' Training Corps]]. From July 1917 until March 1918 the [[Irish Convention]] met in the college in an attempt to address the political aftermath of the Easter rising. (Subsequently, following the failure of the Convention to reach \"substantial agreement\", the [[Irish Free State]] was set up in 1922.) In the post-independence period Trinity College suffered from a cool relationship with the new state.  On 3 May 1955 the [[Provost (education)|Provost]], Dr A.J. McConnell, pointed out in a piece in the ''[[Irish Times]]'' that certain state-funded County Council scholarships excluded Trinity College from the list of approved institutions.  This, he suggested, amounted to religious discrimination, which was forbidden by the constitution.\n[[File:Trinity College.jpg|thumb|Trinity College Front Square]]\nThe School of Commerce was established in 1925, and the School of Social Studies in 1934. Also in 1934, the first female professor was appointed.\n\n1958 saw the first Catholic to reach the Board of Trinity as a Senior Fellow.\n\nIn 1962 the School of Commerce and the School of Social Studies amalgamated to form the School of Business and Social Studies. In 1969 the several schools and departments were grouped into Faculties as follows: Arts (Humanities and Letters); Business, Economic and Social Studies; Engineering and Systems Sciences; Health Sciences (since October 1977 all undergraduate teaching in dental science in the Dublin area has been located in Trinity College); Science.\n\nIn 1970 the [[Catholic Church]] lifted its ban on Catholics attending the college without special dispensation. At the same time, the Trinity College authorities invited the appointment of a Catholic chaplain to be based in the college.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.ie/~duacon/nl19-3.htm |title=IOL.ie |publisher=IOL.ie |date=22 January 2000 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> There are now two such Catholic chaplains.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcd.ie/Chaplaincy/catholic.htm |title=TCD.ie |publisher=TCD.ie |date=12 March 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105181037/http://www.tcd.ie/Chaplaincy/catholic.htm |archivedate=5 January 2010  }}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s, there was a proposal for [[University College, Dublin]], of the National University of Ireland, to become a constituent college of a newly reconstituted University of Dublin. This plan, suggested by [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]] and [[Donogh O'Malley]], was dropped after opposition by Trinity College students.\n\nFrom 1975, the Colleges of Technology that now form the [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] had their degrees conferred by the University of Dublin. This arrangement was discontinued in 1998 when the DIT obtained degree-granting powers of its own.\n\nThe [[School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences (Trinity College, Dublin)|School of Pharmacy]] was established in 1977 and around the same time, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine was transferred to [[University College, Dublin]]. Student numbers increased sharply during the 1980s and 1990s, with total enrolment more than doubling, leading to pressure on resources and subsequent investment programme.\n\nIn 1991, Thomas Noel Mitchell became the first Roman Catholic elected Provost of Trinity College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/provost/history/former-provosts/tn_mitchell.php|title=Thomas Noel Mitchell - Provost & President : Trinity College Dublin|first=Provost & President, Trinity College|last=Dublin|website=Tcd.ie|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nTrinity College is today in the centre of Dublin. At the beginning of the new century, it embarked on a radical overhaul of academic structures to reallocate funds and reduce administration costs, resulting in, for instance, the mentioned reduction from six to five to eventually three faculties under a subsequent restructuring by a later governing authority. The ten-year strategic plan prioritises four research themes with which the college seeks to compete for funding at the global level. Comparative funding statistics reviewing the difference in departmental unit costs and overall costs before and after this restructuring are not however apparent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/about/content/pdf/TCDStrategicPlan2006_English.pdf |title=TCD Strategic Plan 2006|website=Tcd.ie|accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref> The '''Hamilton Mathematics Institute''' in Trinity College, named in honour of William Rowan Hamilton, was launched in 2005 and aims to improve the international profile of Irish mathematics, to raise public awareness of mathematics and to support local mathematical research through workshops, conferences and a visitor programme.\n\n==Buildings and grounds==\n[[File:Parliament Square from the Graduates Memorial Building (GMB) - geograph.org.uk - 1742048.jpg|thumb|Parliament Square]]\nTrinity College retains a tranquil collegiate atmosphere despite its location in the centre of a capital city (and despite its being one of the most significant tourist attractions in Dublin). This is, in large part, due to the compact design of the college, whose main buildings look inwards and are arranged in large quadrangles (called squares), and the existence of only a few public entrances.\n\nThe main college grounds are approximately 190,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> (47 acres), including the Trinity College Enterprise Centre nearby, and buildings account for around 200,000 m\u00b2, ranging from works of older architecture to more modern buildings. The main entrance to the college is on the College Green, and its grounds are bounded by Nassau and Pearse Streets. The college is bisected by [[College Park, Dublin|College Park]], which has a cricket and rugby pitch.\n\n[[File:Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland (Goldsmith Hall).jpg|thumb|left|Interior courtyard of the modern Goldsmith Hall college residence]]\nThe western side of the college is older, featuring the iconic [[Campanile (Trinity College, Dublin)|Campanile]], as well as many fine buildings, including the Chapel and Examination Hall (designed by [[Sir William Chambers]]), [[Graduates Memorial Building]], [[Museum Building (Trinity College, Dublin)|Museum Building]], and the [[The Rubrics|Rubrics]], all spread across College's five squares. The [[Provost's House, Trinity College, Dublin|Provost's House]] sits a little way up from the College Front Gate such that the House is actually on [[Grafton Street]], one of the two principal shopping streets in the city, while its garden faces into the college. The [[Douglas Hyde Gallery]], a contemporary art gallery, is located in the college as is the Samuel Beckett Theatre. It hosts national and international performances and is used by the Dublin International Theatre Festival, the Dublin Dance Festival, and The Fringe Festival, among others. During the academic term it is predominantly used as a teaching and performance space for Drama students and staff.\n\nThe eastern side of the college is occupied by Science buildings, most of which are modern developments, arranged in three rows instead of quadrangles. In 2010, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked the it as one of the 15 most beautiful college grounds in the world.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/08/31/beautiful-campuses-lifestyle-education-colleges-10-university-architecture_slide_7.html | work=Forbes | title=The World's Most Beautiful College Campuses}}</ref>\n\nThe college also incorporates a number of buildings and facilities spread throughout the city, from the Politics and Sociology Departments, located on [[Dame Street]], to the Faculty of Health Sciences buildings, located at [[St. James's Hospital]] and [[Tallaght University Hospital]]. The Trinity Centre at St James's Hospital incorporates additional teaching rooms, as well as the Institute of Molecular Medicine and John Durkan Leukaemia Institute. The college also owns a large set of residences four kilometres to the south of the college on the [[Dartry Road]], in [[Rathmines]], called [[Trinity Hall, Dublin|Trinity Hall]].<ref group=\"Note\">Trinity Hall which houses 1,100 students, of whom the majority are first years.</ref>\n\nIn November 2018, the College announced plans, estimated at \u20ac230 million, to redevelop the campus and a new hub near [[Grand Canal Dock]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/innovation/trinity-college-campus-future-estates-strategy|title=Trinity College Dublin reveals \u20ac230m blueprint for the campus of the future|last=Kennedy|first=John|date=2018-11-22|website=Silicon Republic|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Trinity College Dublin, Parliament Square.jpg|750px|A panorama taken from Parliament Square.

As a result of its historic standing, Trinity College Library Dublin is a [[legal deposit]] library (as per [[Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003]]) for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and has a similar standing in Irish law. The college is therefore legally entitled to a copy of every book published in Great Britain and Ireland and consequently receives over 100,000 new items every year. The library contains about five million books, including 30,000 current serials and significant collections of manuscripts, maps, and printed music. Three million books are held in the book depository, \"Stacks\", in [[Santry]], from which requests are retrieved twice daily.\n\n[[File:Trinity college library.jpg|thumb|left|The Old Library, housing the Book of Kells and other ancient manuscripts.]]\nThe Library proper is composed of several library buildings in college. The original (Old) Library is Thomas Burgh's masterpiece. A huge building, it originally towered over the university and city after its completion. Even today, surrounded by similarly scaled buildings, it is imposing and dominates the view of the university from Nassau Street. It was founded with the college and first endowed by [[James Ussher]] (1625\u201356), Archbishop of Armagh, who endowed his own valuable library, comprising several thousand printed books and manuscripts, to the college. The [[Book of Kells]] is by far the Library's most famous book and is located in the Old Library, along with the [[Book of Durrow]], the Book of Howth and other ancient texts. Also incorporating the Long Room, the Old Library is one of Ireland's biggest tourist attractions and holds thousands of rare, and in many cases very early, volumes. In the 18th century, the college received the [[Trinity College harp|Brian Boru harp]], one of the three surviving medieval Gaelic harps, and a national symbol of Ireland, which is now housed in the library.\n\n[[File:Trinity Pomodoro.jpg|thumb|Arnaldo Pomodoro's ''[[Sphere Within Sphere]]'' sculpture stands outside the Berkeley Library]]\nThe buildings referred to as the college's BLU ('''B'''erkeley '''L'''ecky '''U'''ssher) Arts library complex consist of the [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] Library in Fellow's Square, built in 1956, the Lecky Library, attached to the Arts building, and the James Ussher Library which, opening officially in 2003, overlooks College Park and houses the Glucksman Map Library. The Glucksman Library contains half a million printed maps, the largest collection of cartographic materials in Ireland. This includes the first Ordnance Surveys of Ireland, conducted in the early 19th century.\n\nThe Library also includes the [[William Rowan Hamilton|William Hamilton]] Science and Engineering Library and the [[John Stearne (physician)|John Stearne]] Medical Library, housed at St James's Hospital.\n\n===Business School===\n{{Main|Trinity Business School}}\nThe ''Trinity College Business School building'' is an \u20ac80 million construction for Trinity's Business School. It was opened on May 23, 2019 by Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar.

Patrick Prendergast has been the Provost since 2011.\n\n===Governance===\n[[File:Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland (Sculpture of George Salmon).jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of former provost [[George Salmon]] (by John Hughes) and the [[Campanile (Trinity College, Dublin)|Campanile]], both in Parliament Square]]\nThe [[body corporate]] of the college consists of the provost, [[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|fellows]] and scholars. The college is governed according to its statutes which are, in effect, the College Constitution. Statutes are of two kinds, those which originally could only be amended by Royal Charter or Royal Letters Patent, and which now can only be changed by an Act of the Oireachtas and those which can be changed by the board but only with the consent of the Fellows.  When a change requires parliamentary legislation, the customary procedure is that the Board requests the change by applying for a Private Bill. For this, the consent of the whole Body Corporate is needed, with Scholars voting alongside Fellows. An example of a change that requires parliamentary legislation is an alteration to the composition of the Board. This last happened when the governance of the college and university was revised and restated by an Act of the Oireachtas in 2000.\n\nThe Provost serves a ten-year term and is elected by a body of electors consisting essentially of all full-time academic staff, and a very small number of students. Originally the Provost was appointed for life. While the Provost was elected by the Fellows at the start, the appointment soon became a Crown one, reflecting the growing importance of the college and of the office of provost, which became both prestigious and well paid. However, as time passed it became customary that the appointments were only made after taking soundings of college opinion, which meant mostly the views of the Board. With the establishment of the Free State in 1922, the power of appointment passed to the Government. It was agreed that when a vacancy occurred the college would provide a list of three candidates to the Government, from which the choice would be made. The college was allowed to rank the candidates in order of preference and in practice, the most preferred candidate was always appointed. Now the Provost while still formally appointed by the Government is elected by staff plus student representatives, who gather in an electoral meeting, and vote by exhaustive ballot until a candidate obtains an absolute majority; the process takes a day. The Provost takes precedence over everyone else in the college, acts as the chief executive and accounting officer and chairs the board and council. The provost also enjoys a special status in the University of Dublin.\n\nFellows and scholars are elected by the board. Fellows were once elected for life on the basis of a competitive examination. The number of fellows was fixed and a competition to fill a vacancy would occur on the death or resignation of a fellow. Originally all the teaching was carried out by the Fellows. Fellows are now elected from among current college academics, serve until reaching retirement age, and there is no formal limit on their number. Only a minority of academic staff are fellows.  Election to fellowship is recognition for staff that they have excelled in their field and as such, amounts to a promotion for those receiving it. Any person appointed to a professorship who is not already a fellow, is elected a fellow at the next opportunity.\n\nScholars continue to be selected by competitive examination from the Undergraduate body. The Scholarship examination is now set according to the several undergraduate courses. (So there is a scholarship examination in History, or in Mathematics or Engineering, and so forth).  The Scholarship examination is taken in the second year of a four-year degree course (though, in special circumstances, such as illness, bereavement, or studying abroad during the second year, permission may be given to sit the examination in the third year). In theory, a student can sit the examination in any subject, not just the one they are studying. They hold their Scholarship until they are of \"MA standing\" that is, three years after obtaining the BA degree. (So most are Scholars for a term of five years).\n\nFellows are entitled to residence in the college free of charge; most fellows do not exercise this right in practice, with the legal requirement to provide accommodation to them being fulfilled by providing an office. Scholars are also entitled to residence in the college free of charge, they also receive an allowance, and have the fees paid for courses they are taking within the college. However, due to pressure on college accommodation, Scholars are no longer entitled (as they once were) to free rooms for the full duration of their scholarship should they cease to be students.  Fellows and Scholars are also entitled to one free meal a day, usually in the evening (\"Commons\"). Scholars retain the right to free meals for the full duration of their scholarship even after graduation, and ceasing to be students, should they choose to exercise it.\n\n====The Board====\nAside from the Provost, Fellows and Scholars, Trinity College has a Board (dating from 1637), which carries out general governance. Originally the Board consisted of the Provost and Senior Fellows only. There were seven Senior Fellows, defined as those seven fellows that had served longest, Fellowship at that time being for life, unless resigned. Over the years a representational element was added, for example by having elected representatives of the Junior Fellows and of those Professors who were not Fellows, with the last revision before Irish Independence being made by [[Royal Letters Patent]] in 1911. At that time there were, as well as the Senior Fellows, two elected representatives of those Professors that were not Fellows and elected representatives of the Junior Fellows. Over the years, while formal revision did not take place, partly due to the complexity of the process, a number of additional representatives were added to the Board but as \"observers\" and not full voting members. These included representatives of academic staff who were not Fellows, and representatives of students. In practice all attending Board meetings were treated as equals, with votes while not common, being taken by a show of hands. But it remained the case, that legally only the full members of the Board could have their votes recorded and it was mere convention that they always ratified the decision taken by the show of hands.\n\nThe governance of Trinity College was next formally changed in 2000, by the [[Oireachtas]], in legislation proposed by the Board of the college, and approved by the Body Corporate viz ''The Trinity College, Dublin (Charters and Letters Patent Amendment) Act, 2000''. This was introduced separately from the Universities Act 1997. It states that the Board shall comprise:\n* The Provost, Vice-Provost/Chief Academic Officer, Senior Lecturer, Registrar and Bursar;\n* Six Fellows;\n* Five members of the academic staff who are not Fellows, at least three of whom must be of a rank not higher than senior lecturer;\n* Two members of the academic staff of the rank of professor;\n* Three members of the non-academic staff;\n* Four students of the college, at least one of whom shall be a post-graduate student;\n* One member, not an employee or student of the college, chosen by a Board committee from nominations made by organisations \"representative of such business or professional interest as the Board considers appropriate\";\n* One member nominated by the [[Minister for Education and Skills]] following consultation with the Provost.\n\nThe fellows, non-fellow academic staff as well as non-academic staff are elected to serve for a fixed term. The four student members are the President, Education Officer and Welfare Officer of the Students' Union and the president of the Graduate Students' Union (all ex officio) and are elected annually for one-year terms. The vice-provost/chief academic officer, senior lecturer, registrar and bursar are 'annual officers' appointed for one-year (renewable) terms by the Provost. The two significant changes are that the Senior Fellows are no longer on the Board and that two members of the Board are now drawn from without the college.\n\n====The Council====\nThere is a Council (dating from 1874), which oversees academic matters. All decisions of the Council require the approval of the Board, but if the decision in question does not require a new expenditure, the approval is normally formal, without debate. The Council had a significant number of elected representatives from the start, and was also larger than the Board, which at that time, continued to consist of the Provost and seven Senior Fellows only. The Council is the formal body which makes academic staff appointments, always, in practice on the recommendation of appointments panels, but which have themselves been appointed by the Council. An illustration of the relationship between the Board and the Council, is where a decision is made to create a new professorial chair. As this involves paying a salary, the initial decision to create the chair is made by the Council, but the decision to make provision for the salary is made by the Board, consequently, the Board might overrule, or defer a Council decision on grounds of cost.\n\n====The Senate====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Seal of the University of Dublin.png|Seal of the University Senate|thumb|upright]] -->\nThe University of Dublin was modelled on [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge]] in the form of a [[collegiate university]], Trinity College being named by the Queen as the ''mater universitatis'' (\"mother of the university\"). As no other college was ever established, the college is the sole constituent college of the university and so Trinity College and the University of Dublin are for most practical purposes synonymous. However, the actual statutes of the university and the college<ref name=\"gsu.tcd.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gsu.tcd.ie/files/Statutes-Current.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Statutes-Current.doc |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318181124/http://www.gsu.tcd.ie/files/Statutes-Current.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2009 }}</ref> grant the university separate corporate legal rights to own property and borrow money and employ staff. Moreover, while the board of the college has the sole power to propose amendments to the statutes of the university and college, amendments to the university statutes require the consent of the Senate of the university. Consequently, in theory, the Senate can overrule the Board, but only in very limited and particular circumstances. However, it is also the case that the university cannot act independently of the initiative of the Board of Trinity College. The most common example of when the two bodies must collaborate is when a decision is made to establish a new degree. All matters relating to syllabus, examination and teaching are for the college to determine, but actual clearance for the award of the degree is a matter for the university. In the same way, when an individual is awarded an Honorary Degree, the proposal for the award is made by the Board of Trinity College, but this is subject to agreement by a vote of the Senate of Dublin University. All graduates of the university who have at least a master's degree are eligible to be members of the Senate, but in practice, only a few hundred are, with a large proportion being current members of the staff of Trinity College.\n\n====Visitors====\nThe college also has an oversight structure of two visitors, the chancellor of the university, who is elected by the Senate, and the judicial visitor, who is appointed by the Irish Government from a list of two names submitted by the Senate of the university. The current judicial visitor is the Hon. Dr. Justice Maureen Harding Clark. In the event of a disagreement between the two visitors, the opinion of the chancellor prevails. The visitors act as a final \"court of appeal\" within the college, with their modes of appointment giving them the needed independence from the college administration.\n\n===Academic associations===\n[[File:Trinity-College-Campanile-Front.JPG|thumb|upright|Parliament Square: The [[Campanile (Trinity College, Dublin)|Campanile]]]]\nTrinity College is a [[sister college]] to [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]] of the [[University of Oxford]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] of the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|date=17 June 2005|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article534008.ece|title=Professor A.

Trinity College has also been associated in the past with a number of other teaching institutions. These include [[St Catherine's College of Education for Home Economics]] (now closed), [[Magee College]] and [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]], which is a music conservatoire, as well as The Lir National Academy of Dramatic Art, which is the national conservatoire for theatre training actors, technicians, playwrights and designers to a professional and industry standard \u2013 the Lir is also advised by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in the UK.\n\n===Parliamentary representation===\n{{main|University of Dublin (constituency)}}\nThe university has been linked to parliamentary representation since 1613, when [[James I of England|James I]] granted it the right to elect two members of parliament (MPs) to the [[Irish House of Commons]]. Since the new [[Constitution of Ireland]] in 1937, graduates of the university have formed a constituency which elects three [[Members of the Seanad \u00c9ireann|Senator]]s to [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]]. The current representatives of the university constituency are [[Ivana Bacik]], [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]] and [[Lynn Ruane]]. Notable representatives have included [[Edward Gibson, 1st Baron Ashbourne|Edward Gibson]], [[William Edward Hartpole Lecky|W. E. H. Lecky]], [[Edward Carson]], [[Noel Browne]], [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]] and [[Mary Robinson]]. The franchise was originally restricted to the Provost, Fellows and Scholars of Trinity College. This was expanded in 1832 to include those who had received an M.A. and in 1918 all those who had received a degree from the university.\n\n==Academic profile==\nSince considerable academic restructuring in 2008, the college has three academic faculties:\n* Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences\n* Engineering, Mathematics and Sciences\n* Health Sciences\n\nEach faculty is headed by a dean (there is also a Dean of Postgraduate Studies), and faculties are divided into schools, of which there were 24 as of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/structure/ |title=Faculties and Schools |publisher=Trinity College, Dublin |date=17 February 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Second-level programmes===\nSince 2014, Trinity College's Science Department has established and operated a scheme for second-level students to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The system, similar to [[Dublin City University|DCU's]] [[Centre for the Talented Youth of Ireland|CTYI]] programme, encourages academically gifted secondary students with a high aptitude for the [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] subjects, was named the Walton Club<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/waltonclub/|title=Trinity Walton Club|website=Tcd.ie}}</ref> in honour of [[Ernest Walton]], Ireland's first and only Nobel laureate for Physics.

First-year students at the undergraduate level are called Junior Freshmen; second years, Senior Freshmen; third years, Junior Sophisters; and fourth years, Senior Sophisters. After a proposal in 2017 by the SU Equality Committee, a three-year process changing the titles of first and second years to Junior and Senior Fresh was approved by the Trinity College Board.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Meehan|first1=Sarah|title=Undergraduate name \"Freshman\" to change to gender-neutral \"Fresh\"|url=http://trinitynews.ie/undergraduate-name-freshman-to-change-to-gender-neutral-fresh/|accessdate=28 November 2017|publisher=Trinity News|date=28 November 2017}}</ref> The Freshman Years usually have a set or minimally flexible basic curriculum with the Sophister years allowing for a much greater degree of course variation, as well as taking a year abroad. The passing of two sets of examinations is a prerequisite for a degree. Junior and Senior Freshmen sit preliminary annual exams in Trinity Term of each year which must be passed so that they \"rise\" to the year above. At the end of the Junior Sophister year, undergraduates sit Part I of the Moderatorship exams, subject to attaining an upper-second,{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} allows them to take an Honours degree and sit the Part II (Final) of the Moderatorship exams. Successful candidates receive first-, upper or lower second-, or third-class honours, or simply a \"pass\" without honours if they perform insufficiently in Part I of the Moderatorship.\n\nMost non-professional courses take a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. As a matter of tradition, bachelor's degree graduates are eligible, after nine terms from matriculation and without additional study, to purchase for a fee an upgrade of their bachelor's degree to a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]].\nThe four-year degree structure makes undergraduate teaching at Dublin closer to the North American model than that of other universities in England and Ireland (Scottish universities generally also require four years of study for a bachelor's degree).\n\nDegree titles vary according to the subject of study. The [[Trinity College Dublin Law School|Law School]] awards the [[LL.B.]], the LL.B. (ling. franc.) and the LL.B. (ling. germ.). Other degrees include the BAI (engineering) and BBS (business studies). The BSc degree is not in wide use although it is awarded by the School of Nursing and Midwifery<!-- Removed Pharmacy from this list, new course awards a BPharm and MPharm degree -->; most science and computer science students are awarded a BA.<!-- Most, there is a BSc in Computer Science evening course -->\n\nFrom 2018, Trinity will be offering dual BA programme with Columbia University in New York City. Students of History, English, European Studies or Middle Eastern and European Languages and Culture spend their first two years at Trinity and their last two years at Columbia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gs.columbia.edu/tcd/dual-ba-program|title=Dual BA Program - Trinity College Dublin|website=gs.columbia.edu}}</ref>\n\n===Graduate===\nAt postgraduate level, Trinity offers a range of taught and research degrees in all faculties. About 29% of students are post-graduate level, with 1,440 students reading for a research degree and an additional 3,260 on taught courses (see [[#Research and innovation|Research and Innovation]]).<ref name=\"HigherEducationAuthorityArchiveFullTime\"/><ref name=\"HigherEducationAuthorityArchivePartTime\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Graduate_Studies |title=Graduate Studies \u2013 Trinity College Dublin |publisher=Tcd.ie |date=15 April 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nTrinity College's Strategic Plan sets \"the objective of doubling the number of PhDs across all disciplines by 2013 in order to move towards a knowledge society. In order to achieve this, the college has received some of the largest allocations of Irish Government funding which have become competitively available to date.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/universitydublintrinitycollege |title=Topuniversities.com |publisher=Topuniversities.com |date=12 November 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080527060420/http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/universitydublintrinitycollege |archivedate = 27 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to [[academic degree]]s, the college offers [[Postgraduate Diploma]] (non-degree) qualifications, either directly, or through associated institutions.\n\n===Academic year===\nThe academic year is divided into three [[Academic term|terms]]. [[Michaelmas term]] lasts from October to December; [[Hilary term]] from January to March; and [[Trinity term]] from April to June, with each term separated by a vacation. Whilst teaching takes place across all three terms in postgraduate courses, for undergraduate programmes, teaching is condensed within the first two terms since 2009, with each term consisting of a twelve-week period of teaching known as the Teaching Term. These are followed by three revision weeks and a four-week exam period during the Trinity Term.<ref>{{cite book|title=Trinity College Academic Calendar|quote=(12 weeks each), followed by three revision weeks and a four-week exam period.}}</ref>\n\nInternally at least, the weeks in the term are often referred to by the time elapsed since the start of teaching Term: thus the first week is called \"1st week\" or \"week 1\" and the last is \"Week 12\"/\"12th week\".\n\nThe first week of Trinity Term (which marks conclusion of lecturing for that year) is known as Trinity Week; normally preceded by a string of balls, it consists of a week of sporting and academic events. This includes the Trinity Ball and the Trinity Regatta (a premier social event on the Irish rowing calendar held since 1898),<ref>{{cite web|title=Trinity Regatta \u2013 Dublin University Boat Club|url=http://www.tcdlife.ie/clubs/boat/regatta.php|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090904/http://www.tcdlife.ie/clubs/boat/regatta.php|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> the election of Scholars and Fellows and a college banquet.\n\n===Admissions===\nThe [[Central Applications Office]] processes applications from Irish, British and European Union applicants for undergraduate courses on behalf of Trinity College. Decisions on admissions to undergraduate courses are made by Trinity College who instruct the CAO to make offers to successful candidates.

Furthermore, applicants for certain courses may be required to achieve more specific qualifications than those prescribed for minimum matriculation requirements.<ref>{{cite web|author=Undergraduate Admissions (Email) |url=https://www.tcd.ie/calendar/undergraduate-studies/admission-requirements.pdf |title= Admission Requirements |publisher=Tcd.ie}}</ref>  Eligible applicants must then compete for places based on the results of their [[School leaving qualification|school leaving examinations]], however, applicants can additionally take [[matriculation examination]]s<ref>{{cite web|author=Undergraduate Admissions (Email) |url=https://www.tcd.ie/Admissions/undergraduate/assets/pdf/Matric%20Syllabus.pdf |title= Matriculation Examination Syllabus |publisher=Tcd.ie}}</ref> which are held in the university in April, in which each subject is considered equivalent to that of the [[Leaving Certificate (Ireland)|Irish Leaving Certificate]]. Applications for restricted courses<ref>{{cite web|author=Central Applications Office |url=https://www.cao.ie/index.php?page=restrictedcourses&bb=restrictions |title= Restricted-Application Courses |publisher=cao.ie}}</ref> require further assessment considered in the admissions process, such as the [[Health Professions Admissions Test]] (HPAT) for medicine or [[Educational entrance examination|entrance tests]] for music and drama courses. As applications for most courses far exceeds available places, admission is highly selective, demanding excellent grades in the aforementioned examinations. Through the [[Central Applications Office|CAO]], candidates may list several courses at Trinity College and at other third-level institutions in Ireland in order of preference. Places are awarded in mid-August every year by the [[Central Applications Office|CAO]] after matching the number of places available to the academic attainments of the applicants. Qualifications are measured as \"points\", with specific scales for the Leaving Certificate, UK GCE [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]], the [[International Baccalaureate]] and all other European Union school-leaving examinations.<ref>{{cite web|author=Undergraduate Admissions (Email) |url=http://www.tcd.ie/Admissions/undergraduate/requirements/matriculation/other/ |title=A list of EU exams and conversion ratios |publisher=Tcd.ie |date=26 February 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nFor applicants who are not citizens or residents of the [[European Union]], different application procedures apply.;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/universitydublintrinitycollege|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228220105/http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/universitydublintrinitycollege|url-status=dead|title=Topuniversities.com|archivedate=28 February 2009}}</ref> 16% of students are from outside Ireland, and 40% of these are from outside the European Union.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Disadvantaged, disabled, or mature students can also be admitted through a program that is separate from the [[Central Applications Office|CAO]], the Trinity Access Programme,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Trinity_Access |title=TCD.ie |publisher=TCD.ie |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> which aims to facilitate the entry of sectors of society which would otherwise be under-represented.

On Trinity Monday (the first day of Trinity Term), the Board of the college sits and elects to the Scholarship all those who achieve First in the examination. Election to become a scholar of Trinity Dublin is widely regarded as \u201cthe most prestigious undergraduate award in the country\u201d.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.universitytimes.ie/2019/04/58-scholars-15-fellows-and-two-honorary-fellows-elected/|title=58 Scholars, 15 Fellows and Two Honorary Fellows Elected|last=|first=|date=|work=The University Times|access-date=}}</ref> Those from EU member countries are entitled to free rooms and Commons (the college's [[Formal (university)|Formal]] Hall), an annual stipend and exemption from fees for the duration of their scholarship, which lasts for fifteen terms. Scholars from non-EU member countries have their fees reduced by the current value of EU member fees. Scholars may add the suffix \"'''SCH.'''\" to their names, have the note \"discip. schol.\" appended to their name at Commencements and are entitled to wear Bachelor's Robes and a velvet mortarboard.\n\nCompetition for Scholarship involves a searching examination and successful candidates must be of exceptional ability. The concept of scholarship is a valued tradition of the college, and many of the college's most distinguished members were elected scholars (including Samuel Beckett and Ernest Walton). The Scholars' dinner, to which 'Scholars of the decade' (those elected in the current year, and every year multiple of a decade previous to it, e.g., 2013, 2003,..) are invited, forms one of the major events in Trinity's calendar. A scholarship at Trinity College is a prestigious undergraduate award; a principal aim of the college is the pursuit of excellence, and one of the most tangible demonstrations of this is the institution of scholarship.\n\nUnder the Foundation Charter (of 1592), Scholars were part of the body corporate (three Scholars were named in the charter \"in the name of many\"). Until 1609 there were about 51 Scholars at any one time. A figure of seventy was permanently fixed in the revising Letters Patent of Charles I in 1637. Trinity Monday was appointed as the day when all future elections to Fellowship and Scholarship would be announced (at this time Trinity Monday was always celebrated on the Monday after the feast of the [[Trinity Sunday|Holy Trinity]]). Up to this point, all undergraduates were Scholars, but soon after 1637 the practice of admitting students other than Scholars commenced.\n\nUntil 1856, only the classical subjects were examined. The questions concerned all the classical authors prescribed for the entrance examination and for the undergraduate course up to the middle of the Junior Sophister year. So candidates had no new material to read, 'but they had to submit to a very searching examination on the fairly lengthy list of classical texts which they were supposed by this time to have mastered'. The close link with the undergraduate syllabus is underlined by the refusal until 1856 to admit Scholars to the Library (a request for admission was rejected by the Board in 1842 on the grounds that Scholars should stick to their prescribed books and not indulge in 'those desultory habits' that admission to an extensive library would encourage). During the second half of the nineteenth century, the content of the examination gradually came to include other disciplines.\n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, \"Non-Foundation\" Scholarships were introduced. This initially was a device to permit women to be, in effect, elected Scholars, despite the then commonly accepted legal view that the statute revision of 1637 only permitted males to be elected Foundation Scholars. Clearly, when women were not permitted in the college, this had not caused any difficulties, but with the admission of women as full members of the college, an anomaly was created. Non-Foundation Scholarship granted to the women elected to it all the rights of men, but with the exception of voting rights at a meeting of the Body Corporate, a very rare event in any case. As women are now admitted to Foundation Scholarship on exactly the same basis as men Non-Foundation Scholarships are retained as a device to allow for more than seventy persons to be Scholars at any one time provided sufficient meet the qualifying standards. Foundation Scholarships are given to those whose performance is considered particularly exceptional, with the remaining qualifying persons that year being elected as Non-Foundation Scholars. While the number of Foundation Scholars remains fixed at seventy, there is, in theory, no limit on the number of Non-Foundation scholars. Non-Foundation and Foundation Scholars receive the same benefits and therefore the two groups are regarded in equal esteem and usually refer to themselves collectively as the [[List of Scholars of Trinity College Dublin|Scholars of Trinity College Dublin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tcd.ie/calendar/undergraduate-studies/foundation-and-non-foundation-scholarships.pdf|title=Trinity College Dublin, Calendar, Undergraduate Studies Part II, Part D9, Foundation and Non-Foundation Scholarships|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> It is worth noting that when the college had only a few hundred members the Foundation Scholars could easily amount to ten per cent of the whole undergraduate body; now that the college numbers members in thousands even the addition of current numbers of Non Foundation Scholars means that the proportion of students elected Scholars is still lower than it has even been before, and being elected to Scholarship is more competitive than it was.\n\n===Research===\nTrinity College is the most productive internationally recognised research centre in Ireland.<ref>[http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/universitydublintrinitycollege Topuniversities.com] \"Interdisciplinarity forms a key element in the College strategy in increasing Trinity's international standing as a research-led university.

Student societies operate under the aegis of the Dublin University Central Societies Committee (CSC) which is composed of the Treasurers of each of the Societies within the college. Society size varies enormously, and it is often hard to determine exact figures for most societies \u2013 several claiming to be the largest in the college with thousands of members, while smaller groups may have only 40\u201350 members.\n\nSituated in the [[Graduates Memorial Building]] (GMB) are the two debating societies: [[University Philosophical Society]] (the Phil) and the [[College Historical Society]] (the Hist). The Phil meets each Thursday evening in the [[Graduates Memorial Building#Interior|chamber]] of the GMB, while the Hist meets each Wednesday evening. Both the Phil and the Hist make claims to be the oldest such [[student society]]: the Phil claims to have been founded in 1683, although university records list its foundation as having occurred in 1853,<ref name=\"College Calendar\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tcd.ie/calendar/general-information/students-unions-societies-and-clubs.pdf |title=Calendar 2016-Students' Unions, Societies and Clubs |publisher=Trinity College Dublin |date=5 October 2016 |accessdate=26 January 2017}}</ref> while the Hist was founded in 1770 (which it makes it the oldest society on campus according to the College Calendar).<ref name=\"College Calendar\" /> Among the [[University Philosophical Society#Honorary patrons|Honorary Patrons]] of the Phil are multiple [[Noble Prize]] laureates, Heads of State, notable actors, entertainers, well-known intellectuals, such as [[Al Pacino]], [[Desmond Tutu]], [[Sir Christopher Lee]], [[Stephen Fry]], and [[John Mearsheimer]]. The Hist has been addressed by many notable orators including [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Ted Kennedy]], and counts among its former members many prominent men and women in Ireland's history.\n\nOther societies include [[Vincent de Paul Society (Trinity College, Dublin)|Vincent de Paul Society]] (VDP), which organises a large number of charitable activities in the local community; DU Players, one of the most prolific student-drama societies in Europe which hosts more than 50 shows and events a year in the [[Samuel Beckett]] Theatre; [[The DU Film Society]] (Formerly DU Filmmakers, formerly the DU \"Videographic Society\", founded in 1987) which organises filmmakers and film-lovers in college through workshops, screenings, production funding, etc.; the DU Radio Society, known as [[Trinity FM]], broadcasts a variety of student made productions on a special events licence on FM frequency 107.8FM for six weeks a year; The [[Trinity LGBT]] society, which is the oldest [[LGBT]] society in Ireland and celebrated its 25th anniversary in the 2007/2008 year; The Card and Bridge Society also holds weekly poker and bridge tournaments and was the starting point to many notable alum including [[Andy Black (poker player)|Andy Black]], [[Padraig Parkinson]] and [[Donnacha O'Dea]]; the Dublin University Comedy Society, known as DU Comedy, hosts comedy events for its members and has hosted gigs in college from comedians such as [[Andrew Maxwell]], [[David O'Doherty]], [[Neil Delamere]] and [[Colin Murphy (comedian)|Colin Murphy]]; The Dance Society, known as \"{{proper name|dudance}}\", provides classes in Latin and ballroom dancing, as well as running events around other dance styles such as swing dancing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitysocieties.ie/society/31/dance-society |title=Trinitysocieties.ie |publisher=Trinitysocieties.ie |date=25 March 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029021249/http://www.trinitysocieties.ie/society/31/dance-society |archivedate=29 October 2010 }}</ref> In 2011 the [[Laurentian Society]] was revived.

Most student publications are administered by Trinity Publications, previously called the Dublin University Publications Committee (often known as 'Pubs'), which maintains and administers the Publications office (located in No 6) and all the associated equipment needed to publish newspapers and magazines.\n\nThere are two rival student newspapers in Trinity. [[Trinity College Dublin Students' Union]] funds ''[[The University Times]]''. Since its founding in 2009, the paper has consistently won national and international awards, including the award for best all-around non-daily student newspaper in the world from the US-based [[Society of Professional Journalists]]. Even though it is funded by the union, it is often critical of its activities. In 2019, Provost Patrick Prendergast said that \"The University Times has pursued an independent course in many aspects of College life, and done so fearlessly.\"\n\n''[[Trinity News]]'', meanwhile, is Ireland's oldest student newspaper, having been founded in 1953. Like ''The University Times'', it publishes both an online edition and a print edition every three weeks during the academic year. For the last 10 years the paper has been edited by a full-time student editor, who takes a sabbatical year from their studies, supported by a voluntary part-time staff of 30 student section editors and writers.\n\nStudent magazines currently in publication include the satirical newspaper ''[[The Piranha (newspaper)|The Piranha]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitypublications.info/Our%20Publications.html |title=Trinity Publications |publisher=Trinitypublications.info |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> (formerly ''Piranha!'' magazine but rebranded in 2009), the generalist ''[[T.C.D. Miscellany]]'' (founded in 1895; one of Ireland's oldest magazines), the film journal ''[[Trinity Film Review]]'' (TFR) and the literary ''[[Icarus (magazine)|Icarus]]''. Other publications include the ''Student Economic Review'' and the [[Trinity College Law Review]], produced independently by students of economics and law respectively, the ''Trinity College Journal of Postgraduate Research'', produced by the Graduate Students Union, the ''Social and Political Review'' (SPR),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spr.tcdlife.ie/ |title=Welcome to The Social and Political Review of Trinity College Dublin |publisher=Spr.tcdlife.ie |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> now in its 22nd year, the ''Trinity Student Medical Journal'',<ref>{{cite web |author=Dublin Life (Email) |url=http://www.tsmj.tcd.ie |title=TCD.ie |publisher=Tsmj.tcd.ie |date=26 August 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108195955/http://www.tsmj.tcd.ie/ |archivedate=8 January 2009  }}</ref> ''The Attic'', student writing produced by the ''Dublin University Literary Society'', the ''Afro-Caribbean Journal'' produced by the ''Afro-Caribbean Society,'' and ''grass'' an intermedial magazine based on collaboration between media.

His works span the transition from the [[Classical period (music)|classical]] period to the [[Romantic music|romantic]] era in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. The \"early\" period in which he forged his craft, is typically seen to last until 1802. His \"middle\" period, (sometimes characterised as \"heroic\") showing an individual development from the \"classical\" styles of [[Franz Joseph Haydn|Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], covers the years 1802 to 1812, during which he increasingly suffered from deafness. In the \"late\" period from 1812 to his death in 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.\n\nBeethoven was born in [[Bonn]]. His musical talent was obvious at an early age, and he was initially harshly and intensively taught by his father [[Johann van Beethoven]]. He was later taught by the composer and conductor [[Christian Gottlob Neefe]], under whose tuition he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations, in 1783. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of [[Helene von Breuning]], whose children he loved, befriended and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to [[Vienna]], which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and he was soon courted by [[Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky]] for compositions, which resulted in his three [[Piano Trios, Op. 1 (Beethoven)|Opus 1]] [[piano trio]]s (the earliest works to which he accorded an [[opus number]]) in 1795.\n\nHis first major orchestral work, the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First Symphony]], appeared in 1800, and his [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|first set of string quartets]] was published in 1801. During this period, his hearing began to deteriorate, but he continued to conduct, premiering his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth]] [[symphony|Symphonies]] in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]] appeared in 1806. His [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|last piano concerto]] (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the 'Emperor'), dedicated to his frequent patron [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria]], was premiered in 1810, but not with Beethoven as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. He described his problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life in two letters, his \"[[Heiligenstadt Testament]]\" (1802) to his brothers and his unsent love letter to an unknown \"[[Immortal Beloved]]\" (1812).\n\nIn the years from 1810, increasingly less socially involved, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works including his later symphonies and his mature [[chamber music]] and [[piano sonata]]s. His only opera, ''[[Fidelio]]'', which had been first performed in 1805, was revised to its final version in 1814. He composed his ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' in the years 1819\u20131823, and his final, [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth]], Symphony, one of the first examples of a [[choral symphony]], in 1822\u20131824. Written in his last years, his [[Late string quartets (Beethoven)|late string quartets]] of 1825\u201326 are amongst his final achievements. After some months of bedridden illness he [[Death of Ludwig van Beethoven|died in 1827]]. Beethoven's works remain mainstays of the classical music repertoire.\n\n== Life and career ==\n=== Family and early life ===\n[[File:Beethoven house of birth Bonn 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven's birthplace at Bonngasse&nbsp;20, Bonn, now the [[Beethoven House]] museum]]\nBeethoven was the grandson of [[Ludwig van Beethoven (1712\u20131773)|Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1712\u20131773), a musician from the town of [[Mechelen]] in the Austrian [[Duchy of Brabant]] (in what is now the [[Flemish region]] of Belgium) who had moved to [[Bonn]] at the age of 21.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}}{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=407}} Ludwig was employed as a [[bass (voice type)|bass]] singer at the court of [[Clemens August of Bavaria|Clemens August]], [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishop-Elector of Cologne]], eventually rising to become, in 1761, [[Kapellmeister]] (music director) and hence a pre-eminent musician in Bonn. The portrait he commissioned of himself towards the end of his life remained displayed in his grandson's rooms as a talisman of his musical heritage.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=12\u201317}} Ludwig had one son, [[Johann van Beethoven|Johann]] (1740\u20131792), who worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and [[violin]] lessons to supplement his income.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}}\n\nJohann married [[Maria Magdalena Keverich]] in 1767; she was the daughter of Heinrich Keverich (1701\u20131751), who had been the head chef at the court of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|Archbishopric of Trier]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=50}} Beethoven was born of this marriage in Bonn at what is now the [[Beethoven House]] Museum, Bonnstrasse 20.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.beethoven.de/en/about-us#history |title=Beethoven-Haus History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Beethoven-Haus Bonn |publisher= |access-date=16 April 2020 |quote=}}</ref> There is no authentic record of the date of his birth; however, the registry of his [[baptism]], in the Catholic Parish of St. Remigius on 17 December 1770, survives, and the custom in the region at the time was to carry out baptism within 24 hours of birth. There is a consensus, (with which Beethoven himself agreed) that his birth date was 16 December, but no documentary proof of this.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=53}}\n\nOf the seven children born to Johann van Beethoven, only Ludwig, the second-born, and two younger brothers survived infancy.

He later had other local teachers: the court [[organist]] Gilles van den Eeden (d. 1782), Tobias Friedrich Pfeiffer (a family friend, who provided keyboard tuition), and Franz Rovantini (a relative, who instructed him in playing the violin and [[viola]]).{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}} From the outset his tuition regime, which began in his fifth year, was harsh and intensive, often reducing him to tears; with the involvement of the insomniac Pfeiffer there were irregular late-night sessions with the young Beethoven being dragged from his bed to the keyboard.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=22, 32}} His musical talent was obvious at a young age. Johann, aware of [[Leopold Mozart]]'s successes in this area (with his son [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Wolfgang]] and daughter [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]]), attempted to promote his son as a [[child prodigy]], claiming that Beethoven was six (he was seven) on the posters for his first public performance in March 1778.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=57\u20138}}\n\n===1780\u20131792: Bonn ===\n[[File:Christian Gottlob Neefe.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|Christian Gottlob Neefe.

He often visited the cultivated von Breuning family, at whose home he taught piano to some of the children, and where the widowed Frau von Breuning offered him a motherly friendship. Here he also met [[Franz Gerhard Wegeler|Franz Wegeler]], a young medical student, who became a lifelong friend (and was to marry one of the von Breuning daughters). The von Breuning family environment offered an alternative to his home life, which was increasingly dominated by his father's decline. Another frequenter of the von Breunings was [[Count Ferdinand Ernst Gabriel von Waldstein|Count Ferdinand von Waldstein]], who became a friend and financial supporter during Beethoven's Bonn period.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 2}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=55}}{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp= 51\u201352}} Waldstein was to commission in 1791 Beethoven's first work for the stage, the ballet ''Musik zu einem Ritterballett'' (WoO 1).{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p= 121\u2013122}}\n\n[[File:Count von Waldstein.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Count Waldstein: portrait by  [[Anton\u00edn Machek]], c. 1800]]In the period 1785\u201390 there is virtually no record of Beethoven's activity as a composer.

He also studied violin under [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 47, 54}} Early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from [[Antonio Salieri]], primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly as late as 1809.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=149}}\n\nWith Haydn's departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home to Bonn. He chose instead to remain in Vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with [[Johann Georg Albrechtsberger|Johann Albrechtsberger]] and other teachers. In any case, by this time it must have seemed clear to his employer that Bonn would fall to the French, as it did in October 1794, effectively leaving Beethoven without a stipend or the necessity to return.{{sfn|Ronge|2013}} However, a number of Viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them [[Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz|Prince Joseph Franz Lobkowitz]], [[Karl Alois Johann-Nepomuk Vinzenz, F\u00fcrst Lichnowsky|Prince Karl Lichnowsky]], and Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}}\n\nAssisted by his connections with Haydn and Waldstein, Beethoven began to develop a reputation as a performer and improviser in the salons of the Viennese nobility.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=59}} His friend [[Nikolaus Simrock]] began publishing his compositions, starting with a set of keyboard variations on a theme of [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf|Dittersdorf]] (WoO 66).{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 46}} By 1793, he had established a reputation in Vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their eventual appearance would have greater impact.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}}\n\n[[File:\u00d6lenhainz - Franz Joseph Maximilian von Lobkowitz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Prince Lobkowitz: portrait by [[August Friedrich Oelenhainz]]]]His first public performance in Vienna was in March 1795, where he first performed one of his [[piano concerto]]s.{{refn|It is uncertain whether this was the [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] or [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]].

They were published in 1801. He also completed his [[Septet (Beethoven)|Septet]] (Op. 20) in 1799, which was one of his most popular works during his lifetime. With premieres of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]] Symphonies in 1800 and 1803, he became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following Haydn and Mozart. But his melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterisation of emotion all set him apart from his influences, and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first published.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 58}}  For the premiere of his First Symphony, he hired the [[Burgtheater]] on 2 April 1800, and staged an extensive programme, including works by Haydn and Mozart, as well as his Septet, the Symphony, and one of his piano concertos (the latter three works all then unpublished). The concert, which the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' described as \"the most interesting concert in a long time,\" was not without difficulties; among the criticisms was that \"the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 90}} By the end of 1800, Beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 97}}\n\n[[File:Josephine Brunsvik.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Josephine Brunsvik, pencil miniature (unknown artist), before 1804.]]In May 1799, he taught piano to the daughters of Hungarian Countess Anna Brunsvik.

In late 1801, he met a young countess, [[Julie Guicciardi]], through the Brunsvik family; he mentions his love for Julie in a November 1801 letter to a friend, but class difference prevented any consideration of pursuing this.

In addition to the Second Symphony, the concert also featured the First Symphony, the [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Piano Concerto]], and the [[oratorio]] ''[[Christ on the Mount of Olives (Beethoven)|Christ on the Mount of Olives]]''.

In addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works, Kaspar also began selling some of his earlier unpublished compositions, and encouraged him (against Beethoven's preference) to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations.

Some of his early patrons, including Prince Lobkowitz and Prince Lichnowsky, gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published works.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 78\u201379}} Perhaps his most important aristocratic patron was [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria ]], the youngest son of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II]], who in 1803 or 1804 began to study piano and composition with him.  They became friends, and their meetings continued until 1824.{{sfn|Lockwood|2005|pp=300\u201301}} Beethoven was to dedicate 14 compositions to Rudolf, including some of his major works such as the [[Piano Trio No. 7 (Beethoven)|''Archduke'' Trio]] Op. 97 (1811) and ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'' Op. 123 (1823).\n\nHis position at the Theater an der Wien was terminated when the theatre changed management in early 1804, and he was forced to move temporarily to the suburbs of Vienna with his friend Stephan von Breuning. This slowed work on ''Leonore'', (his original title for his opera), his largest work to date, for a time. It was delayed again by the Austrian [[censorship|censor]], and finally premiered, under its present tile of ''Fidelio'' in November 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the [[War of the Third Coalition|French occupation of the city]]. In addition to being a financial failure, this version of ''Fidelio'' was also a critical failure, and Beethoven began revising it.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 150}}\n\nDespite this failure, Beethoven continued to attract recognition. In 1807 the musician and publisher [[Muzio Clementi]] secured the rights for publishing his works in England, and Haydn's former patron [[Nikolaus II, Prince Esterh\u00e1zy|Prince Esterh\u00e1zy]] commissioned a mass (the [[Mass in C major (Beethoven)|Mass in C]], Op. 86) for his wife's name-day. But he could not count on such recognition alone. A colossal benefit concert which he organized in December 1808, and was widely advertised, included the premieres of the Fifth and [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth (''Pastoral'')]] symphonies, the [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]], extracts from the Mass in C, the [[aria|scena and aria]] ''[[Ah! perfido]]'' Op. 65 and the [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy op. 80]]. There was a large audience, (including Czerny and the young [[Ignaz Moscheles]]).

Other works of this period in a similar vein were the F minor [[String Quartet No. 11 (Beethoven)|String Quartet Op. 95]], to which Beethoven gave the subtitle ''Quartetto serioso'', and the Op. 97 [[Piano Trio, Op. 97 (Beethoven)|Piano Trio in B flat major]] known, from its dedication to his patron Rudolph as the ''Archduke Trio''.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 7}}\n\nIn the spring of 1811 Beethoven became seriously ill, suffering headaches and high fever.

These 'conversation books' are a rich written resource for his life from this period onwards.

The first was the announcement of Archduke Rudolf's promotion to [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]]-[[Archbishop]] as Archbishop of [[Olomouc]] (now in Czechia), which triggered the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' Op. 123, intended to be ready for his installation in Olomouc in March 1820. The other was  the invitation by the publisher [[Antonio Diabelli]] to fifty Viennese composers , including Beethoven, [[Franz Schubert]], Czerny and the 8-year old [[Franz Liszt]], to compose a variation each on a theme which he provided. Beethoven was spurred to outdo the competition and by mid-1819 had already completed 20 variations of what were to become the 33 ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'' op. 120. Neither of these works were to be completed for a few years.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 8}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=45}} A significant tribute of 1819, however, was Archduke Rudolf's set of forty piano variations on a theme written for him by Beethoven (WoO 200), and dedicated to the master.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=741, 745}} Beethoven's portrait by Ferdinand Schimon of this year, which was one of the most familiar images of him for the next century, was described by Schindler as, despite its artistic weaknesses, \"in the rendering of that particular look, the majestic forehead [...] the firmly shut mouth and the chin shaped like a shell, [...] truer to nature than any other picture.\"{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=742}}\n\nBeethoven's determination over the following years to write the ''Mass'' for Rudolf was not motivated by any devout [[Roman Catholic church|Catholicism]]. Although born a Catholic, the form of religion as practised at the court in Bonn where he grew up was, in the words of Maynard Solomon, \"a compromise ideology that permitted a relatively peaceful coexistence between the Church and [[rationalism]].\"{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=54}}. Beethoven's ''Tagebuch'' (a diary he kept on an occasional basis between 1812 and 1818) shows his interest in a variety of relgious philosophies, including those of India, Egypt and the Orient and the writings of the [[Rig-Veda]].{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=146-147}} In a letter to Rudolf of July 1821 Beethoven shows his belief in a personal God: \"God [...] sees into my innermost heart and knows that as a man I perform most conscientiously and on all occasions the duties which Humanity, God, and Nature enjoin upon me.\" On one of the sketches for the ''Missa Solemnis'' he wrote  \"Plea for inner and outer peace.\"{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=342}}.  \n\nBeethoven's status was confirmed by the series of ''Concerts sprituels'' given in Vienna by the choirmaster Franz Xaver Gebauer in the 1819/1820 and 1820/1821 seasons, during which all eight of his symphonies to date, plus the oratorio ''Christus'' and the Mass in C, were performed. Beethoven was typically underwhelmed:  when in an April 1820 conversation book a friend mentioned Gebauer,  Beethoven wrote in reply \"Geh!

Despite this he continued work on the remaining piano sonatas he had promised to Schlesinger (the [[Piano Sonata No. 32 (Beethoven)|Sonata in A flat major Op. 110]] was published in December), and on the Mass.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 776-777, 781-782}} In early 1822 Beethoven sought a reconciliation with his brother Johann, whose marriage in 1812 had met with his disapproval, and Johann now became a regular visitor (as witnessed by the conversation books of the period) and began to assist him in his business affairs, including him lending him money against ownership of some of his compositions. He also sought some reconciliation with the mother of his nephew, including supporting her income, although this did not meet with the approval of the contrary Karl.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp= 362 -363}} Two commissions at the end of 1822 improved Beethoven's financial prospects. In November the [[Philharmonic Society]] of London offered a commission for a symphony, which he accepted with delight, as an appropriate home for the Ninth Symphony on which was working.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 833-834}} Also in November Prince [[Nikolai Borisovich Galitzin|Nikolai Galitzin]] of [[Saint Petersburg]] offered to pay Beethoven's asking price for three string quartets.

He was not however in a hurry to get it published or performed as he had formed a notion that he could profitably sell manuscripts of the work to various courts in Germany and Europe at 50 ducats each. One of the few who took up this offer was [[Louis XVIII]] of France, who also sent Beethoven a heavy gold medallion.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=812-829}} The Symphony and the variations took up most of the rest of Beethoven's working year. Diabelli hoped to publish both works, but the potential prize of the Mass excited may other publishers to lobby Beethoven for it, including Schlesinger and [[Carl Friedrich Peters]]. (In the end it was obtained by [[Schott Music|Schotts]]).{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=186}}\n\nBeethoven had become critical of the Viennese reception of his works. He told the visiting [[Johann Friedrich Rochlitz]] in 1822:<blockquote>You will hear nothing of me here [...] ''Fidelio''? They cannot give it, nor do they want to listen to it. The symphonies? They have no time for them. My concertos? Everyone grinds out only the stuff he himself has made. The solo pieces? They went out of fashion long ago, and here fashion is everything. At the most, [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh|Schuppanzigh]] occasionally digs up a quartet.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=801}}</blockquote> He therefore enquired about premiering the ''Missa'' and the Ninth Symphony in Berlin. When his Viennese admirers learnt of this, they pleaded with him to arrange local performances. Beethoven was won over, and the symphony was first performed, along with sections of the ''Missa Solemnis'', on 7 May 1824, to great acclaim at the [[K\u00e4rntnertortheater]].{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 9}}{{refn|The first full performance of the ''Missa Solemnis'' had already been given in St. Petersburg by Golitsin, who had been a subscriber for the manuscript 'preview' that Beethoven had arranged.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}}|group=n}} Beethoven stood by the conductor [[Michael Umlauf]] during the concert beating time (although Umlauf had warned the singers and orchestra to ignore him), and because of his deafness was not even aware of the applause which followed until he was turned to witness it.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=351}} The ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' gushed, \"inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world\", and Carl Czerny wrote that the Symphony \"breathes such a fresh, lively, indeed youthful spirit&nbsp;... so much power, innovation, and beauty as ever [came] from the head of this original man, although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads.\" The concert did not make much money for Beethoven, as the expenses of mounting it were very high.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=317}} A second concert on 24 May, in which the producer guaranteed him a minimum fee, was poorly attended; nephew Karl noted that \"many people [had] already gone into the country\". It was Beethoven's last public concert.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 318}}\n\nBeethoven then turned to writing the string quartets for Galitzin, despite failing health. The first of these, the [[String Quartet No. 12 (Beethoven)|quartet in E\u266d major, Op. 127]] was premiered by the [[Schuppanzigh Quartet]] in March 1825. While writing the next,  the [[String Quartet No. 15 (Beethoven)|quartet in A minor, Op. 132]], in April 1825, he was struck by a sudden illness. Recuperating in [[Baden]], he included in the quartet its slow movement to which he gave the title \"Holy song of thanks ('Heiliger Dankgesang') to the Divinity, from a convalescent, in the [[Lydian mode]].\" {{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} The next quartet to be completed was the [[String Quartet No. 13 (Beethoven)|Thirteenth, op. 130]], in B\u266d major. In six movements, the last, contrapuntal movement proved to be very difficult for both the performers and the audience at its premiere in March 1826 (again by the Schuppanzigh Quartet). Beethoven was persuaded by the publisher [[Artaria]], for an additional fee, to write a new finale, and to issue the last movement as a separate work (the [[Grosse Fugue]], Op. 133).{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 974-975}} Beethoven's favourite was the last of this series, the [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|quartet in C{{music|#}} minor Op. 131]], which he rated as his most perfect single work.{{sfn|Morris|2010|p=213}}\n\nBeethoven's relations with his nephew Karl had continued to be stormy; Beethoven's letters to him were demanding and reproachful. In August, Karl, who had been seeing his mother again against Beethoven's wishes, attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. He survived and after discharge from hospital went to recuperate in the village of [[Gneixendorf]] with Beethoven and his other uncle Johann. Whilst in Gneixendorf Beethoven completed a further quartet,  ([[String Quartet No. 16 (Beethoven)|Op. 135 in F major]]) which he sent to Schlesinger. Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement Beethoven wrote in the manuscript \"Muss es sein?\" (\"Must it be?\");  the response, over the faster main theme of the movement, is \"Es muss sein!\" (\"It must be!\"). The whole movement is headed \"Der schwer gefasste Entschluss\" (\"The Difficult Decision\").{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=977}} Following this in November Beethoven completed his last composition, the new finale for the op. 130 quartet.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} Beethoven at this time was already ill and depressed;{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710 }} he began to quarrel with Johann, insisting that Johann made Karl his heir, in preference to Johann's wife.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p= 1014}}\n\n=== Death ===\n{{Main|Death of Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n[[ File:Beethoven on his deathbed.jpg|thumb|right|Beethoven on his deathbed; sketch by [[Josef Danhauser]]]]On his return to Vienna from Gneixendorf in December 1826, illness struck Beethoven again.

His remains were [[exhume]]d for study in 1863, and moved in 1888 to Vienna's [[Zentralfriedhof]] where they were reinterred in a grave adjacent to that of Schubert.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 318, 349}}{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=1053-1056}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{further|Beethoven's musical style|Beethoven and C minor|List of compositions by Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n\n=== The \"three periods\" ===\nThe historian William Drabkin notes that as early as 1818 a writer had proposed a three-period division of Beethoven's works, and that such a division (albeit often adopting different dates or works to denote changes in period) eventually became a convention adopted by all of Beethoven's biographers, starting with Schindler, [[Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis|F.-J. F\u00e9tis]] and  [[Wilhelm von Lenz]]. Later writers sought to identify sub-periods within this generally accepted structure. Its drawbacks include that it generally omits a fourth period, that is, the early years in Bonn, whose works are less often considered; and that it ignores the differential development of Beethoven's composing styles over the years for different categories of work. The piano sonatas, for example, were written throughout Beethoven's life in a progression that can be interpreted as continuous development; the symphonies do not all demonstrate linear progress; of all of the types of composition, perhaps the quartets, which seem to group themselves in three periods (Op. 18 in 1801-1802, Opp. 59, 74 and 95 in 1806-1814, and the quartets, today known as 'late', from 1824 onwards) fit this categorization most neatly. Drabkin concludes  that \"now that we have lived with them so long [...] as long as there are programme notes, essays written to accompany recordings, and all-Beethoven recitals, it is hard to imagine us ever giving up the notion of discrete stylistic periods.\" {{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=198-200}}{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 11}}\n\n===Bonn===\nSome forty compositions, including ten very early works written by Beethoven up to 1785, survive from the years that Beethoven lived in Bonn. It has been suggested that Beethoven largely abandoned composition between 1785 and 1790, possibly as a result of negative critical reaction to his first published works. A 1784 review in [[Johann Nikolaus Forkel]]'s influential ''Musikalischer Almanack'' compared Beethoven's efforts to those of rank beginners.{{sfn|Solomon|1972|p=169}} Most of Beethoven's surviving works from this period were written after he turned twenty, between 1790 and 1792.  Scholars generally regard these early efforts as bland and uninspired and have concluded that his first efforts at writing in the classical sonata style (with the exception of his Wind Octet) were poorly conceived. [[Gustav Nottebohm]], for example, wrote of Beethoven's Dressler Variations (WoO 63), \"they show not a trace of contrapuntal independent part-writing. They are figural variations of the simplest kind\".<ref>Nottebohm, Gustav (1873) [https://archive.org/details/beethovensstudi01nottgoog ''Beethovens Studien'']. Leipzig & Winterthur. p. 10</ref> [[T\u00e9odor de Wyzewa]] considered his early \"Kurf\u00fcrsten Sonatas\" written in 1783 (WoO 47) as merely \"correct imitations of Haydn.\".<ref>Wyzewa, T\u00e9odor de (1914) ''Beethoven et Wagner''. Paris. p. 44</ref> Considered as a whole, Beethoven's compositional efforts in Bonn demonstrate the importance of his move to Vienna in terms of the development of his musical style and the sophistication of his grasp of classical form and idiom.\n\n===The first period===\nThe conventional \"first period\" begins after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the first few years he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' (best known today from [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a [[scherzo]] rather than a [[minuet and trio]]; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 13}}\n\nHe also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the early period are the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|first]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|second]] symphonies, the set of six string quartets [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|Opus 18]], the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so [[Beethoven's piano sonatas|piano sonatas]], including the famous ''[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Path\u00e9tique]]'' sonata, Op. 13.\n\n===The middle period===\nHis middle (heroic) period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3\u20138), the last two piano concertos, the [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] and [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|violin concerto]], five string quartets (Nos. 7\u201311), several piano sonatas (including the ''[[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|Waldstein]]'' and ''[[Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)|Appassionata]]'' sonatas), the ''[[Violin Sonata No. 9 (Beethoven)|Kreutzer]]'' violin sonata and his only [[opera]], ''[[Fidelio]]''.\n\nThe \"middle period\" is sometimes associated with a \"heroic\" manner of composing,<ref name=\"Solomon1990\">{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Maynard|authorlink=Maynard Solomon|title=Beethoven essays|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2ZH3v2_-4F4C|page=124}}|accessdate=4 August 2011|year=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06379-2|page=124}}</ref> but the use of the term \"heroic\" has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship. The term is more frequently used as an alternative name for the middle period.<ref name=\"Steinberg2006\">{{cite book|last=Steinberg|first=Michael P.|authorlink=Michael P.

He began a renewed study of older music, including works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]], that were then being published in the first attempts at complete editions. The overture ''[[The Consecration of the House (overture)|The Consecration of the House]]'' (1822) was an early work to attempt to incorporate these influences. A new style emerged, now called his \"late period\". He returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade: the works of the late period include the last five piano sonatas and the ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'', the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the late string quartets (see below), and two works for very large forces: the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|String Quartet, Op. 131]] has seven linked movements, and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement.{{sfn|GroveOnline}} Other compositions from this period include the ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'', the last five string quartets (including the massive ''[[Gro\u00dfe Fuge]]'') and the last five piano sonatas.\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Zentralfriedhof Vienna - Beethoven.JPG|thumb|upright|Beethoven's grave at Vienna [[Zentralfriedhof]]]]The [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] in Bonn was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of his birth. It was the first statue of a composer created in Germany, and the music festival that accompanied the unveiling was the impetus for the very hasty construction of the original [[Beethovenhalle]] in Bonn (it was designed and built within less than a month, on the urging of [[Franz Liszt]]). A statue to Mozart had been unveiled in [[Salzburg]], Austria, in 1842. Vienna did not honour Beethoven with a statue until 1880.{{sfn|Comini|2008|p=316}}\n\nThere is a museum, the [[Beethoven House]], the place of his birth, in central Bonn.

His works span the transition from the [[Classical period (music)|classical]] period to the [[Romantic music|romantic]] era in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. The \"early\" period in which he forged his craft, is typically seen to last until 1802. His \"middle\" period, (sometimes characterised as \"heroic\") showing an individual development from the \"classical\" styles of [[Franz Joseph Haydn|Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], covers the years 1802 to 1812, during which he increasingly suffered from deafness. In the \"late\" period from 1812 to his death in 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.\n\nBeethoven was born in [[Bonn]]. His musical talent was obvious at an early age, and he was initially harshly and intensively taught by his father [[Johann van Beethoven]]. He was later taught by the composer and conductor [[Christian Gottlob Neefe]], under whose tuition he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations, in 1783. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of [[Helene von Breuning]], whose children he loved, befriended and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to [[Vienna]], which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and he was soon courted by [[Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky]] for compositions, which resulted in his three [[Piano Trios, Op. 1 (Beethoven)|Opus 1]] [[piano trio]]s (the earliest works to which he accorded an [[opus number]]) in 1795.\n\nHis first major orchestral work, the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First Symphony]], appeared in 1800, and his [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|first set of string quartets]] was published in 1801. During this period, his hearing began to deteriorate, but he continued to conduct, premiering his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth]] [[symphony|Symphonies]] in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]] appeared in 1806. His [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|last piano concerto]] (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the 'Emperor'), dedicated to his frequent patron [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria]], was premiered in 1810, but not with Beethoven as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. He described his problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life in two letters, his \"[[Heiligenstadt Testament]]\" (1802) to his brothers and his unsent love letter to an unknown \"[[Immortal Beloved]]\" (1812).\n\nIn the years from 1810, increasingly less socially involved, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works including his later symphonies and his mature [[chamber music]] and [[piano sonata]]s. His only opera, ''[[Fidelio]]'', which had been first performed in 1805, was revised to its final version in 1814. He composed his ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' in the years 1819\u20131823, and his final, [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth]], Symphony, one of the first examples of a [[choral symphony]], in 1822\u20131824. Written in his last years, his [[Late string quartets (Beethoven)|late string quartets]] of 1825\u201326 are amongst his final achievements. After some months of bedridden illness he [[Death of Ludwig van Beethoven|died in 1827]]. Beethoven's works remain mainstays of the classical music repertoire.\n\n== Life and career ==\n=== Family and early life ===\n[[File:Beethoven house of birth Bonn 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven's birthplace at Bonngasse&nbsp;20, Bonn, now the [[Beethoven House]] museum]]\nBeethoven was the grandson of [[Ludwig van Beethoven (1712\u20131773)|Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1712\u20131773), a musician from the town of [[Mechelen]] in the Austrian [[Duchy of Brabant]] (in what is now the [[Flemish region]] of Belgium) who had moved to [[Bonn]] at the age of 21.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}}{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=407}} Ludwig was employed as a [[bass (voice type)|bass]] singer at the court of [[Clemens August of Bavaria|Clemens August]], [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishop-Elector of Cologne]], eventually rising to become, in 1761, [[Kapellmeister]] (music director) and hence a pre-eminent musician in Bonn. The portrait he commissioned of himself towards the end of his life remained displayed in his grandson's rooms as a talisman of his musical heritage.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=12\u201317}} Ludwig had one son, [[Johann van Beethoven|Johann]] (1740\u20131792), who worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and [[violin]] lessons to supplement his income.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}}\n\nJohann married [[Maria Magdalena Keverich]] in 1767; she was the daughter of Heinrich Keverich (1701\u20131751), who had been the head chef at the court of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|Archbishopric of Trier]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=50}} Beethoven was born of this marriage in Bonn at what is now the [[Beethoven House]] Museum, Bonnstrasse 20.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.beethoven.de/en/about-us#history |title=Beethoven-Haus History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Beethoven-Haus Bonn |publisher= |access-date=16 April 2020 |quote=}}</ref> There is no authentic record of the date of his birth; however, the registry of his [[baptism]], in the Catholic Parish of St. Remigius on 17 December 1770, survives, and the custom in the region at the time was to carry out baptism within 24 hours of birth. There is a consensus, (with which Beethoven himself agreed) that his birth date was 16 December, but no documentary proof of this.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=53}}\n\nOf the seven children born to Johann van Beethoven, only Ludwig, the second-born, and two younger brothers survived infancy. [[Kaspar Anton Karl van Beethoven|Kaspar Anton Karl]] was born on 8 April 1774, and [[Nikolaus Johann van Beethoven|Nikolaus Johann]], (generally known as Johann) the youngest, was born on 2 October 1776.{{sfn|Stanley|2000|p=7}}\n\nBeethoven's first music teacher was his father. He later had other local teachers: the court [[organist]] Gilles van den Eeden (d. 1782), Tobias Friedrich Pfeiffer (a family friend, who provided keyboard tuition), and Franz Rovantini (a relative, who instructed him in playing the violin and [[viola]]).{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 1}} From the outset his tuition regime, which began in his fifth year, was harsh and intensive, often reducing him to tears; with the involvement of the insomniac Pfeiffer there were irregular late-night sessions with the young Beethoven being dragged from his bed to the keyboard.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=22, 32}} His musical talent was obvious at a young age. Johann, aware of [[Leopold Mozart]]'s successes in this area (with his son [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Wolfgang]] and daughter [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]]), attempted to promote his son as a [[child prodigy]], claiming that Beethoven was six (he was seven) on the posters for his first public performance in March 1778.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=57\u20138}}\n\n===1780\u20131792: Bonn ===\n[[File:Christian Gottlob Neefe.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|Christian Gottlob Neefe.

In addition, some minor works not listed with opus numbers or in the WoO list have [[Catalogues of Beethoven compositions#Hess catalogue|Hess catalogue]] numbers.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=210}}|group=n}} Beethoven soon began working with Neefe as assistant organist, at first unpaid (1782), and then as a paid employee (1784) of the court chapel.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=65\u201370}} His [[Three Piano Sonatas, WoO 47 (Beethoven)|first three piano sonatas]], WoO 47, sometimes known as \"{{lang|de|[[Kurf\u00fcrst]]}}\" (\"Elector\") for their dedication to the Elector [[Maximilian Friedrich von K\u00f6nigsegg-Rothenfels|Maximilian Friedrich]] (1708\u20131784), were published in 1783.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=69}} In the same year the first printed reference to Beethoven appeared in the ''Magazin der Musik'' \u2013 \"Louis van Beethoven [sic] ... a boy of 11 years and most promising talent.

He gave some support to Beethoven, appointing him Court Organist and paying towards his visit to Vienna of 1792. {{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=50}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=50}}\n\nHe was introduced in these years to several people who became important in his life. He often visited the cultivated von Breuning family, at whose home he taught piano to some of the children, and where the widowed Frau von Breuning offered him a motherly friendship. Here he also met [[Franz Gerhard Wegeler|Franz Wegeler]], a young medical student, who became a lifelong friend (and was to marry one of the von Breuning daughters). The von Breuning family environment offered an alternative to his home life, which was increasingly dominated by his father's decline. Another frequenter of the von Breunings was [[Count Ferdinand Ernst Gabriel von Waldstein|Count Ferdinand von Waldstein]], who became a friend and financial supporter during Beethoven's Bonn period.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 2}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=55}}{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp= 51\u201352}} Waldstein was to commission in 1791 Beethoven's first work for the stage, the ballet ''Musik zu einem Ritterballett'' (WoO 1).{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p= 121\u2013122}}\n\n[[File:Count von Waldstein.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Count Waldstein: portrait by  [[Anton\u00edn Machek]], c. 1800]]In the period 1785\u201390 there is virtually no record of Beethoven's activity as a composer. This may be attributed to the lukewarm response his initial publications had attracted, and also to ongoing problems in the Beethoven family.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=36\u201337}} His mother died in 1787, shortly after Beethoven\u2019s first visit to Vienna, where he stayed for about two weeks and almost certainly met Mozart.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 2}} In 1789 Beethoven's father was forcibly retired from the service of the Court (as a consequence of his alcoholism) and it was ordered that half of his father's pension be paid directly to Ludwig for support of the family.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=95}} He contributed further to the family's income by teaching (to which Wegeler said he had \"an extraordinary aversion\"{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=51}}) and by playing [[viola]] in the court orchestra. This familiarized him with a variety of operas, including works by Mozart, [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] and [[Giovanni Paisiello|Paisiello]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=95\u201398}} Here he also befriended [[Anton Reicha]], a composer, [[flute|flautist]] and violinist of about his own age who was a nephew of the court orchestra's conductor, [[Josef Reicha]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=96}}\n\nFrom 1790 to 1792, Beethoven composed a number of works (none were published at the time) showing a growing range and maturity. [[Musicologist]]s have identified a theme similar to those of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Symphony]] in a set of variations written in 1791.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 35\u201341}} It was perhaps on Neefe's recommendation that Beethoven received his first commissions; the Literary Society in Bonn commissioned a cantata to mark the occasion of the death in 1790 of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (WoO 87),  and a further cantata, to celebrate the subsequent accession of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (WoO 88), may have been commissioned by the Elector.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=93\u201394}} These two ''Emperor Cantatas'' were never performed at the time and they remained lost until the 1880s, when they were described by [[Johannes Brahms]] as \"Beethoven through and through\" and as such prophetic of the style which would mark his music as distinct from the classical tradition.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=107\u2013111}}\n\nBeethoven was probably first introduced to [[Joseph Haydn]] in late 1790, when the latter was travelling to London and stopped in Bonn around Christmas time.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 35}} A year and a half later, they met in Bonn on Haydn's return trip from London to Vienna in July 1792, when Beethoven played in the orchestra at the [[Redoute, Bad Godesberg|Redoute in Godesberg]]. It is likely that arrangements were made at that time for Beethoven to study with the older master.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 41}} Waldstein wrote to him before his departure: \u201cYou are going to Vienna in fulfilment of your long-frustrated wishes [\u2026] With the help of assiduous labour you shall receive Mozart\u2019s spirit from Haydn\u2019s hands.\u201d{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 2}}\n\n===1792\u20131802: Vienna \u2013 the early years ===\n[[File:Beethoven Riedel 1801.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Beethoven as a young man, c. 1800, by Carl Traugott Riedel (1769\u20131832)]]Beethoven left Bonn for Vienna in November 1792, amid rumours of [[First Coalition|war spilling out of France]]; he learned shortly after his arrival that his father had died.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 42}}  Over the next few years, Beethoven responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased Mozart by studying that master's work and writing works with a distinctly Mozartian flavour.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 43}}\n\nHe did not immediately set out to establish himself as a composer, but rather devoted himself to study and performance. Working under Haydn's direction,{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 3}} he sought to master [[counterpoint]]. He also studied violin under [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 47, 54}} Early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from [[Antonio Salieri]], primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly as late as 1809.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=149}}\n\nWith Haydn's departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home to Bonn. He chose instead to remain in Vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with [[Johann Georg Albrechtsberger|Johann Albrechtsberger]] and other teachers. In any case, by this time it must have seemed clear to his employer that Bonn would fall to the French, as it did in October 1794, effectively leaving Beethoven without a stipend or the necessity to return.{{sfn|Ronge|2013}} However, a number of Viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them [[Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz|Prince Joseph Franz Lobkowitz]], [[Karl Alois Johann-Nepomuk Vinzenz, F\u00fcrst Lichnowsky|Prince Karl Lichnowsky]], and Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}}\n\nAssisted by his connections with Haydn and Waldstein, Beethoven began to develop a reputation as a performer and improviser in the salons of the Viennese nobility.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=59}} His friend [[Nikolaus Simrock]] began publishing his compositions, starting with a set of keyboard variations on a theme of [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf|Dittersdorf]] (WoO 66).{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 46}} By 1793, he had established a reputation in Vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their eventual appearance would have greater impact.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}}\n\n[[File:\u00d6lenhainz - Franz Joseph Maximilian von Lobkowitz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Prince Lobkowitz: portrait by [[August Friedrich Oelenhainz]]]]His first public performance in Vienna was in March 1795, where he first performed one of his [[piano concerto]]s.{{refn|It is uncertain whether this was the [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] or [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]].

They were published in 1801. He also completed his [[Septet (Beethoven)|Septet]] (Op. 20) in 1799, which was one of his most popular works during his lifetime. With premieres of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]] Symphonies in 1800 and 1803, he became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following Haydn and Mozart.

The concert, which the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' described as \"the most interesting concert in a long time,\" was not without difficulties; among the criticisms was that \"the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 90}} By the end of 1800, Beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 97}}\n\n[[File:Josephine Brunsvik.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Josephine Brunsvik, pencil miniature (unknown artist), before 1804.]]In May 1799, he taught piano to the daughters of Hungarian Countess Anna Brunsvik.

The young [[Carl Czerny]], who later became a renowned music teacher himself, studied with Beethoven from 1801 to 1803. In late 1801, he met a young countess, [[Julie Guicciardi]], through the Brunsvik family; he mentions his love for Julie in a November 1801 letter to a friend, but class difference prevented any consideration of pursuing this.

In addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works, Kaspar also began selling some of his earlier unpublished compositions, and encouraged him (against Beethoven's preference) to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations.

Some of his early patrons, including Prince Lobkowitz and Prince Lichnowsky, gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published works.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 78\u201379}} Perhaps his most important aristocratic patron was [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria ]], the youngest son of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II]], who in 1803 or 1804 began to study piano and composition with him.  They became friends, and their meetings continued until 1824.{{sfn|Lockwood|2005|pp=300\u201301}} Beethoven was to dedicate 14 compositions to Rudolf, including some of his major works such as the [[Piano Trio No. 7 (Beethoven)|''Archduke'' Trio]] Op. 97 (1811) and ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'' Op. 123 (1823).\n\nHis position at the Theater an der Wien was terminated when the theatre changed management in early 1804, and he was forced to move temporarily to the suburbs of Vienna with his friend Stephan von Breuning. This slowed work on ''Leonore'', (his original title for his opera), his largest work to date, for a time. It was delayed again by the Austrian [[censorship|censor]], and finally premiered, under its present tile of ''Fidelio'' in November 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the [[War of the Third Coalition|French occupation of the city]]. In addition to being a financial failure, this version of ''Fidelio'' was also a critical failure, and Beethoven began revising it.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 150}}\n\nDespite this failure, Beethoven continued to attract recognition. In 1807 the musician and publisher [[Muzio Clementi]] secured the rights for publishing his works in England, and Haydn's former patron [[Nikolaus II, Prince Esterh\u00e1zy|Prince Esterh\u00e1zy]] commissioned a mass (the [[Mass in C major (Beethoven)|Mass in C]], Op. 86) for his wife's name-day. But he could not count on such recognition alone. A colossal benefit concert which he organized in December 1808, and was widely advertised, included the premieres of the Fifth and [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth (''Pastoral'')]] symphonies, the [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]], extracts from the Mass in C, the [[aria|scena and aria]] ''[[Ah! perfido]]'' Op. 65 and the [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy op. 80]]. There was a large audience, (including Czerny and the young [[Ignaz Moscheles]]). But it was under-rehearsed, involved many stops and starts, and during the Fantasia Beethoven was noted shouting at the musicians \"badly played, wrong, again!\" The financial outcome is unknown.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=445-448}}\n\n[[File:Rudolf-habsburg-olmuetz.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven's patron, [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria (1788\u20131831)|Archduke Rudolf]]; portrait by [[Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder|Johann Baptist von Lampi]]]]In the autumn of 1808, after having been rejected for a position at the Royal Theatre, Beethoven had received an offer from Napoleon's brother [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]], then king of [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]], for a well-paid position as [[Kapellmeister]] at the court in [[Kassel|Cassel]].

[[Egmont (Beethoven)|The result]] (an overture, and nine additional [[entracte]]s and vocal pieces, Op. 84), which appeared in 1810 fitted well with Beethoven's \"heroic\" style and he became interested in Goethe, setting three of his poems as songs (Op. 83) and learning about the poet from a mutual acquaintance, [[Bettina Brentano]] (who also wrote to Goethe at this time about Beethoven). Other works of this period in a similar vein were the F minor [[String Quartet No. 11 (Beethoven)|String Quartet Op. 95]], to which Beethoven gave the subtitle ''Quartetto serioso'', and the Op. 97 [[Piano Trio, Op. 97 (Beethoven)|Piano Trio in B flat major]] known, from its dedication to his patron Rudolph as the ''Archduke Trio''.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 7}}\n\nIn the spring of 1811 Beethoven became seriously ill, suffering headaches and high fever.

Unsympathetic to developments in German romanticism that featured the supernatural (as in operas by Spohr, [[Heinrich Marschner]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber]], he also \"resisted the impending Romantic fragmentation of the [...] cyclic forms of the Classical era into small forms and lyric mood pieces\" and turned towards study of Bach, [[George Frederic Handel|Handel]] and [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]].{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=295}} An old connection was renewed in 1817 when Maelzel sought, and obtained, Beethoven's endorsement for his newly developed [[metronome]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=684-686}} During these years the few major works completed include Beethoven's only [[song cycle]], ''[[An die ferne Geliebte]]'' Op. 98, (1816), and the gigantic [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|''Hammerklavier'' Sonata]] (Sonata No. 29 in B flat major, Op. 106) (1818).{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 659, 717}} It was also in 1818 that he began musical sketches that eventually form part of his final Ninth Symphony.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=322}}\n\nBy early 1818 Beethoven's health had improved, and his nephew Karl, now aged 11, moved in with him in January, (although within a year Karl's mother had won him back in the courts).{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=41}} By now Beethoven's hearing had again seriously deteriorated, necessitating Beethoven and his interlocutors writing in notebooks to carry out conversations. These 'conversation books' are a rich written resource for his life from this period onwards. They contain discussions about music, business and personal life; they are also a valuable source for his contacts and for investigations into how he intended his music should be performed, and of his opinions of the art of music.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=164-167}} {{refn|It was suggested by Beethoven's  biographer [[Alexander Wheelock Thayer]] that, of 400 conversation books, 264 were destroyed (and others were altered) after his death by his secretary  Schindler, who wished only an idealised biography to survive.{{sfn|Clive|2001|p=239}} The music historian [[Theodore Albrecht]] has however demonstrated that Thayer's allegations were over the top. \"[It is now] abundantly clear that Schindler never possessed as many as c. 400 conversation books, and that he never destroyed roughly five-eighths of that number.\"{{sfn|Albrecht|2009|p=181}} Schindler did however insert a number of fraudulent entries that bolstered his own profile and his prejudices.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=52}}{{sfn|Nettl|1994|p=103}} Presently 136 books covering the period 1819-1827 are preserved at the [[Staatsbibliothek Berlin]], with another two at the Beethoven-Haus in Bonn.{{sfn|Hammelmann|1965|p=187}}|group=n}} His household management had also improved somewhat; Nanette Streicher, who had assisted in his care during his illness, continued to provide some support, and he finally found a skilled cook.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 260}} A testimonial to the esteem in which Beethoven was held in England was the presentation to him in this year by Thomas Broadwood, the proprietor of the company, of a [[John Broadwood & Sons|Broadwood piano]], for which Beethoven expressed grateful thanks.

The first was the announcement of Archduke Rudolf's promotion to [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]]-[[Archbishop]] as Archbishop of [[Olomouc]] (now in Czechia), which triggered the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' Op. 123, intended to be ready for his installation in Olomouc in March 1820. The other was  the invitation by the publisher [[Antonio Diabelli]] to fifty Viennese composers , including Beethoven, [[Franz Schubert]], Czerny and the 8-year old [[Franz Liszt]], to compose a variation each on a theme which he provided. Beethoven was spurred to outdo the competition and by mid-1819 had already completed 20 variations of what were to become the 33 ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'' op. 120. Neither of these works were to be completed for a few years.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 8}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=45}} A significant tribute of 1819, however, was Archduke Rudolf's set of forty piano variations on a theme written for him by Beethoven (WoO 200), and dedicated to the master.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=741, 745}} Beethoven's portrait by Ferdinand Schimon of this year, which was one of the most familiar images of him for the next century, was described by Schindler as, despite its artistic weaknesses, \"in the rendering of that particular look, the majestic forehead [...] the firmly shut mouth and the chin shaped like a shell, [...] truer to nature than any other picture.\"{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=742}}\n\nBeethoven's determination over the following years to write the ''Mass'' for Rudolf was not motivated by any devout [[Roman Catholic church|Catholicism]]. Although born a Catholic, the form of religion as practised at the court in Bonn where he grew up was, in the words of Maynard Solomon, \"a compromise ideology that permitted a relatively peaceful coexistence between the Church and [[rationalism]].\"{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=54}}. Beethoven's ''Tagebuch'' (a diary he kept on an occasional basis between 1812 and 1818) shows his interest in a variety of relgious philosophies, including those of India, Egypt and the Orient and the the writings of the [[Rig-Veda]].{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=146-147}} In a letter to Rudolf of July 1821 Beethoven shows his belief in a personal God: \"God [...] sees into my innermost heart and knows that as a man I perform most conscientiously and on all occasions the duties which Humanity, God, and Nature enjoin upon me.\" On one of the sketches for the ''Missa Solemnis'' he wrote  \"Plea for inner and outer peace.\"{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=342}}.  \n\nBeethoven's status was confirmed by the series of ''Concerts sprituels'' given in Vienna by the choirmaster Franz Xaver Gebauer in the 1819/1820 and 1820/1821 seasons, during which all eight of his symphonies to date, plus the oratorio ''Christus'' and the Mass in C, were performed. Beethoven was typically underwhelmed:  when in an April 1820 conversation book a friend mentioned Gebauer,  Beethoven wrote in reply \"Geh!

Despite this he continued work on the remaining piano sonatas he had promised to Schlesinger (the [[Piano Sonata No. 32 (Beethoven)|Sonata in A flat major Op. 110]] was published in December), and on the Mass.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 776-777, 781-782}} In early 1822 Beethoven sought a reconciliation with his brother Johann, whose marriage in 1812 had met with his disapproval, and Johann now became a regular visitor (as witnessed by the conversation books of the period) and began to assist him in his business affairs, including him lending him money against ownership of some of his compositions. He also sought some reconciliation with the mother of his nephew, including supporting her income, although this did not meet with the approval of the contrary Karl.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp= 362 -363}} Two commissions at the end of 1822 improved Beethoven's financial prospects. In November the [[Philharmonic Society]] of London offered a commission for a symphony, which he accepted with delight, as an appropriate home for the Ninth Symphony on which was working.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 833-834}} Also in November Prince [[Nikolai Borisovich Galitzin|Nikolai Galitzin]] of [[Saint Petersburg]] offered to pay Beethoven's asking price for three string quartets. Beethoven set the price at the high level of 50 ducats per quartet in a letter dictated to his nephew Karl, who was then living with him.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=815-816}}\n\n===1823\u20131827: The final years===\n[[File:Beethoven Waldmuller 1823.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Beethoven in 1823 by [[Ferdinand Georg Waldm\u00fcller]]]]The year 1823 saw the completion of three notable works, all of which had occupied Beethoven for some years, namely the ''Missa Solemnis'', the Ninth Symphony and the ''Diabelli Variations''.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p= 879}}\n\nBeethoven at last presented the manuscript of the completed ''Missa'' to Rudolph on 19 March (more than a year after the Archduke's enthronement as Archbishop). He was not however in a hurry to get it published or performed as he had formed a notion that he could profitably sell manuscripts of the work to various courts in Germany and Europe at 50 ducats each. One of the few who took up this offer was [[Louis XVIII]] of France, who also sent Beethoven a heavy gold medallion.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=812-829}} The Symphony and the variations took up most of the rest of Beethoven's working year. Diabelli hoped to publish both works, but the potential prize of the Mass excited may other publishers to lobby Beethoven for it, including Schlesinger and [[Carl Friedrich Peters]]. (In the end it was obtained by [[Schott Music|Schotts]]).{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=186}}\n\nBeethoven had become critical of the Viennese reception of his works. He told the visiting [[Johann Friedrich Rochlitz]] in 1822:<blockquote>You will hear nothing of me here [...] ''Fidelio''? They cannot give it, nor do they want to listen to it. The symphonies? They have no time for them. My concertos? Everyone grinds out only the stuff he himself has made. The solo pieces? They went out of fashion long ago, and here fashion is everything. At the most, [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh|Schuppanzigh]] occasionally digs up a quartet.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=801}}</blockquote> He therefore enquired about premiering the ''Missa'' and the Ninth Symphony in Berlin. When his Viennese admirers learnt of this, they pleaded with him to arrange local performances. Beethoven was won over, and the symphony was first performed, along with sections of the ''Missa Solemnis'', on 7 May 1824, to great acclaim at the [[K\u00e4rntnertortheater]].{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= \u00a7 9}}{{refn|The first full performance of the ''Missa Solemnis'' had already been given in St. Petersburg by Golitsin, who had been a subscriber for the manuscript 'preview' that Beethoven had arranged.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}}|group=n}} Beethoven stood by the conductor [[Michael Umlauf]] during the concert beating time (although Umlauf had warned the singers and orchestra to ignore him), and because of his deafness was not even aware of the applause which followed until he was turned to witness it.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=351}} The ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' gushed, \"inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world\", and Carl Czerny wrote that the Symphony \"breathes such a fresh, lively, indeed youthful spirit&nbsp;... so much power, innovation, and beauty as ever [came] from the head of this original man, although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads.\" The concert did not make much money for Beethoven, as the expenses of mounting it were very high.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=317}} A second concert on 24 May, in which the producer guaranteed him a minimum fee, was poorly attended; nephew Karl noted that \"many people [had] already gone into the country\". It was Beethoven's last public concert.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 318}}\n\nBeethoven then turned to writing the string quartets for Galitzin, despite failing health. The first of these, the [[String Quartet No. 12 (Beethoven)|quartet in E\u266d major, Op. 127]] was premiered by the [[Schuppanzigh Quartet]] in March 1825. While writing the next,  the [[String Quartet No. 15 (Beethoven)|quartet in A minor, Op. 132]], in April 1825, he was struck by a sudden illness. Recuperating in [[Baden]], he included in the quartet its slow movement to which he gave the title \"Holy song of thanks ('Heiliger Dankgesang') to the Divinity, from a convalescent, in the [[Lydian mode]].\" {{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} The next quartet to be completed was the [[String Quartet No. 13 (Beethoven)|Thirteenth, op. 130]], in B\u266d major. In six movements, the last, contrapuntal movement proved to be very difficult for both the performers and the audience at its premiere in March 1826 (again by the Schuppanzigh Quartet). Beethoven was persuaded by the publisher [[Artaria]], for an additional fee, to write a new finale, and to issue the last movement as a separate work (the [[Grosse Fugue]], Op. 133).{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 974-975}} Beethoven's favourite was the last of this series, the [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|quartet in C{{music|#}} minor Op. 131]], which he rated as his most perfect single work.{{sfn|Morris|2010|p=213}}\n\nBeethoven's relations with his nephew Karl had continued to be stormy; Beethoven's letters to him were demanding and reproachful. In August, Karl, who had been seeing his mother again against Beethoven's wishes, attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. He survived and after discharge from hospital went to recuperate in the village of [[Gneixendorf]] with Beethoven and his other uncle Johann. Whilst in Gneixendorf Beethoven completed a further quartet,  ([[String Quartet No. 16 (Beethoven)|Op. 135 in F major]]) which he sent to Schlesinger. Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement Beethoven wrote in the manuscript \"Muss es sein?\" (\"Must it be?\");  the response, over the faster main theme of the movement, is \"Es muss sein!\" (\"It must be!\"). The whole movement is headed \"Der schwer gefasste Entschluss\" (\"The Difficult Decision\").{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=977}} Following this in November Beethoven completed his last composition, the new finale for the op. 130 quartet.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} Beethoven at this time was already ill and depressed;{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710 }} he began to quarrel with Johann, insisting that Johann made Karl his heir, in preference to Johann's wife.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p= 1014}}\n\n=== Death ===\n{{Main|Death of Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n[[ File:Beethoven on his deathbed.jpg|thumb|right|Beethoven on his deathbed; sketch by [[Josef Danhauser]]]]On his return to Vienna from Gneixendorf in December 1826, illness struck Beethoven again.

As news spread of the severity of Beethoven's condition, many friends, both old and new, came to visit, including Diabelli, Schuppanzigh, Lichnowsky, Schindler, the composer [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]] and his pupil [[Ferdinand Hiller]]. Many tributes were also sent, including \u00a3100 from the Philharmonic Society in London and a case of wine from Schotts.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} {{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=378-379}} During this period he was almost completely bedridden despite occasional brave efforts to rouse himself.

F\u00e9tis]] and  [[Wilhelm von Lenz]]. Later writers sought to identify sub-periods within this generally accepted structure. Its drawbacks include that it generally omits a fourth period, that is, the early years in Bonn, whose works are less often considered; and that it ignores the differential development of Beethoven's composing styles over the years for different categories of work. The piano sonatas, for example, were written throughout Beethoven's life in a progression that can be interpreted as continuous development; the symphonies do not all demonstrate linear progress; of all of the types of composition, perhaps the quartets, which seem to group themselves in three periods (Op. 18 in 1801-1802, Opp. 59, 74 and 95 in 1806-1814, and the quartets, today known as 'late', from 1824 onwards) fit this categorization most neatly. Drabkin concludes  that \"now that we have lived with them so long [...] as long as there are programme notes, essays written to accompany recordings, and all-Beethoven recitals, it is hard to imagine us ever giving up the notion of discrete stylistic periods.\" {{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=198-200}}{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 11}}\n\n===Bonn===\nSome forty compositions, including ten very early works written by Beethoven up to 1785, survive from the years that Beethoven lived in Bonn. It has been suggested that Beethoven largely abandoned composition between 1785 and 1790, possibly as a result of negative critical reaction to his first published works. A 1784 review in [[Johann Nikolaus Forkel]]'s influential ''Musikalischer Almanack'' compared Beethoven's efforts to those of rank beginners.{{sfn|Solomon|1972|p=169}} Most of Beethoven's surviving works from this period were written after he turned twenty, between 1790 and 1792.  Scholars generally regard these early efforts as bland and uninspired and have concluded that his first efforts at writing in the classical sonata style (with the exception of his Wind Octet) were poorly conceived. [[Gustav Nottebohm]], for example, wrote of Beethoven's Dressler Variations (WoO 63), \"they show not a trace of contrapuntal independent part-writing. They are figural variations of the simplest kind\".<ref>Nottebohm, Gustav (1873) [https://archive.org/details/beethovensstudi01nottgoog ''Beethovens Studien'']. Leipzig & Winterthur. p. 10</ref> [[T\u00e9odor de Wyzewa]] considered his early \"Kurf\u00fcrsten Sonatas\" written in 1783 (WoO 47) as merely \"correct imitations of Haydn.\".<ref>Wyzewa, T\u00e9odor de (1914) ''Beethoven et Wagner''. Paris. p. 44</ref> Considered as a whole, Beethoven's compositional efforts in Bonn demonstrate the importance of his move to Vienna in terms of the development of his musical style and the sophistication of his grasp of classical form and idiom.\n\n===The first period===\nThe conventional \"first period\" begins after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the first few years he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' (best known today from [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a [[scherzo]] rather than a [[minuet and trio]]; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a7 13}}\n\nHe also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the early period are the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|first]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|second]] symphonies, the set of six string quartets [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|Opus 18]], the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so [[Beethoven's piano sonatas|piano sonatas]], including the famous ''[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Path\u00e9tique]]'' sonata, Op. 13.\n\n===The middle period===\nHis middle (heroic) period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3\u20138), the last two piano concertos, the [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] and [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|violin concerto]], five string quartets (Nos. 7\u201311), several piano sonatas (including the ''[[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|Waldstein]]'' and ''[[Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)|Appassionata]]'' sonatas), the ''[[Violin Sonata No. 9 (Beethoven)|Kreutzer]]'' violin sonata and his only [[opera]], ''[[Fidelio]]''.\n\nThe \"middle period\" is sometimes associated with a \"heroic\" manner of composing,<ref name=\"Solomon1990\">{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Maynard|authorlink=Maynard Solomon|title=Beethoven essays|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2ZH3v2_-4F4C|page=124}}|accessdate=4 August 2011|year=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06379-2|page=124}}</ref> but the use of the term \"heroic\" has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship. The term is more frequently used as an alternative name for the middle period.<ref name=\"Steinberg2006\">{{cite book|last=Steinberg|first=Michael P.|authorlink=Michael P.

He began a renewed study of older music, including works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]], that were then being published in the first attempts at complete editions. The overture ''[[The Consecration of the House (overture)|The Consecration of the House]]'' (1822) was an early work to attempt to incorporate these influences. A new style emerged, now called his \"late period\". He returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade: the works of the late period include the last five piano sonatas and the ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'', the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the late string quartets (see below), and two works for very large forces: the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|String Quartet, Op. 131]] has seven linked movements, and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement.{{sfn|GroveOnline}} Other compositions from this period include the ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'', the last five string quartets (including the massive ''[[Gro\u00dfe Fuge]]'') and the last five piano sonatas.\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Zentralfriedhof Vienna - Beethoven.JPG|thumb|upright|Beethoven's grave at Vienna [[Zentralfriedhof]]]]The [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] in Bonn was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of his birth. It was the first statue of a composer created in Germany, and the music festival that accompanied the unveiling was the impetus for the very hasty construction of the original [[Beethovenhalle]] in Bonn (it was designed and built within less than a month, on the urging of [[Franz Liszt]]). A statue to Mozart had been unveiled in [[Salzburg]], Austria, in 1842. Vienna did not honour Beethoven with a statue until 1880.{{sfn|Comini|2008|p=316}}\n\nThere is a museum, the [[Beethoven House]], the place of his birth, in central Bonn.

The shortlist for the Popjustice prize is announced in September of each year and the winner named the following month, to coincide with the presentation of the Mercury Prize. Popjustice gives a token prize of \u00a320 to the winner of its award, in contrast to the \u00a320,000 given to the winner of the Mercury Prize.\n\n{{awards table}}\n!{{Abbr|Ref.|Reference}}\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2012\n| \"[[Wings (Little Mix song)|Wings]]\"\n|rowspan=\"6\"|Track of the Year\n| {{nom}}\n|rowspan=\"6\"|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.popjustice.com/twentyquidmusicprize/ |title=The 2016 Popjustice Twenty Quid Music Prize |work=PopJustice |accessdate=1 April 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2013\n| \"[[DNA (Little Mix song)|DNA]]\"\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2014\n| \"[[Move (Little Mix song)|Move]]\"\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2015\n| \"[[Black Magic (song)|Black Magic]]\"\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2016\n| \"[[Love Me Like You]]\"\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2017\n| \"[[Touch (Little Mix song)|Touch]]\"\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|}\n\n== Radio Disney Music Awards ==\nThe [[Radio Disney Music Awards]] is an annual awards show by Radio Disney.

The prize was conceived by Popjustice founder Peter Robinson in 2003 as a reaction to what he perceived as the pompous and elitist nature of the existing Mercury Prize, which recognises the best album of the previous year, and in particular its exclusion of pop music acts in favour of those from more esoteric genres. The shortlist for the Popjustice prize is announced in September of each year and the winner named the following month, to coincide with the presentation of the Mercury Prize. Popjustice gives a token prize of \u00a320 to the winner of its award, in contrast to the \u00a320,000 given to the winner of the Mercury Prize.\n\n{{awards table}}\n!{{Abbr|Ref.|Reference}}\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2012\n| \"[[Wings (Little Mix song)|Wings]]\"\n|rowspan=\"6\"|Track of the Year\n| {{nom}}\n|rowspan=\"6\"|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.popjustice.com/twentyquidmusicprize/ |title=The 2016 Popjustice Twenty Quid Music Prize |work=PopJustice |accessdate=1 April 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2013\n| \"[[DNA (Little Mix song)|DNA]]\"\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2014\n| \"[[Move (Little Mix song)|Move]]\"\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2015\n| \"[[Black Magic (song)|Black Magic]]\"\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2016\n| \"[[Love Me Like You]]\"\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2017\n| \"[[Touch (Little Mix song)|Touch]]\"\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|}\n\n== Radio Disney Music Awards ==\nThe [[Radio Disney Music Awards]] is an annual awards show by Radio Disney.

This defeat was a catalyst for the fall and eventual dissolution of the [[Keraites|Keraite]] tribe.\n\nAfter conquering his way steadily through the Alchi Tatars, Keraites, and Uhaz Merkits and acquiring at least one wife each time, Tem\u00fcjin turned to the next threat on the steppe, the Turkic [[Naimans]] under the leadership of [[Tayang khan|Tayang Khan]] with whom Jamukha and his followers took refuge.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Broadbridge|first=Anne F.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RHOFDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|title=Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire|date=2018-07-18|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-63662-9|location=|pages=89|language=en}}</ref> The Naimans did not surrender, although enough sectors again voluntarily sided with Genghis Khan. \n\nIn 1201, a [[kurultai|khuruldai]] elected [[Jamukha]] as [[Khan (title)|G\u00fcr Khan]], \"universal ruler\", a title used by the rulers of the [[Qara Khitai]]. Jamukha's assumption of this title was the final breach with Genghis Khan, and Jamukha formed a coalition of tribes to oppose him. Before the conflict, several generals abandoned Jamukha, including [[Subutai]], [[Jelme]]'s well-known younger brother. After several battles, Jamukha was turned over to Genghis Khan by his own men in 1206.\n\nAccording to the ''Secret History'', Genghis Khan again offered his friendship to [[Jamukha]]. Genghis Khan had killed the men who betrayed Jamukha, stating that he did not want disloyal men in his army. Jamukha refused the offer, saying that there can only be one sun in the sky, and he asked for a noble death. The custom was to die without spilling blood, specifically by having one's back broken. Jamukha requested this form of death, although he was known to have boiled his opponents' generals alive.\n\n=== Sole ruler of the Mongol plains (1206) ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:Genghis Khan's enthronement in 1206.jpg|thumb|250px|Genghis Khan proclaimed Khagan of all Mongols. Illustration from a 15th-century [[Jami' al-tawarikh]] manuscript.]]\n[[File:Mongol Empire c.1207.png|thumb|Mongol Empire c. 1207]]\nThe part of the [[Merkit]] clan that sided with the [[Naimans]] were defeated by [[Subutai]], who was by then a member of Genghis Khan's personal guard and later became one of Genghis Khan's most successful [[commander]]s. The Naimans' defeat left Genghis Khan as the sole ruler of the [[Eurasian Steppe|Mongol steppe]] \u2013 all the prominent confederations fell or united under his Mongol confederation.\n\nAccounts of Genghis Khan's life are marked by claims of a series of betrayals and conspiracies. These include rifts with his early allies such as Jamukha (who also wanted to be a ruler of Mongol tribes) and Wang Khan (his and his father's ally), his son [[Jochi]], and problems with the most important [[shaman]], who allegedly tried to drive a wedge between him and his loyal brother [[Qasar|Khasar]]. His [[military strategy|military strategies]] showed a deep interest in gathering [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and understanding the [[motivation]]s of his rivals, exemplified by his extensive spy network and [[Yam (route)|Yam]] route systems. He seemed to be a quick student, adopting new technologies and ideas that he encountered, such as [[siege warfare]] from the [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|Chinese]]. He was also ruthless, demonstrated by his tactic of [[measuring against the linchpin]], used against the tribes led by Jamukha.\n\nAs a result, by 1206, Genghis Khan had managed to unite or subdue the [[Merkit]]s, [[Naimans]], [[Mongols]], Keraites, [[Tatars]], [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], and other disparate smaller tribes under his rule. This was a monumental feat. It resulted in peace between previously warring tribes, and a single political and military force. The union became known as the Mongols. At a ''[[Kurultai|Khuruldai]]'', a council of Mongol chiefs, Genghis Khan was acknowledged as [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the consolidated tribes and took the new [[#Name and title|title]] \"Genghis Khan\". The title [[Khagan]] was conferred posthumously by his son and successor \u00d6gedei who took the title for himself (as he was also to be posthumously declared the founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]]).\n\n== Religion ==\nGenghis Khan was a [[Tengrist]], but was [[Religious tolerance|religiously tolerant]] and interested in learning philosophical and moral lessons from other religions. He consulted [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monks (including the Zen monk Haiyun), [[Islam|Muslims]], [[Christianity|Christian]] missionaries, and the [[Taoism|Taoist]] monk [[Qiu Chuji]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Teachings and Practices of the Early Quanzhen Taoist Masters |first=Stephen |last=Eskildsen |year=2004 |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |page=17 |isbn=978-0-7914-6045-0}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Fozu Lidai Tongzai'' written by Nian Chang (b. 1282) Genghis Khan's viceroy [[Muqali]] was pacifying Shanxi in 1219, the homeland of Zen Buddhist monk Haiyun (\u6d77\u96f2, 1203-1257), when one of Muqali's Chinese generals, impressed with Haiyun and his master Zhongguan's demeanor, recommended them to Muqali. Muqali then reported on the two to Genghis Khan who issued the following decree on their behalf: \"They truly are men who pray to Heaven. I should like to support them with clothes and food and make them chiefs. I'm planning on gathering many of this kind of people. While praying to Heaven, they should not have difficulties imposed on them. To forbid any mistreatment, they will be authorized to act as ''darqan'' (possessor of immunity).\" Genghis Khan had already met Haiyun in 1214 and been impressed by his reply refusing to grow his hair in the Mongol hairstyle and allowed him to keep his head shaven.<ref>Page 245, Validation by Holiness or Sovereignty: Religious Toleration as Political Theology in the Mongol World Empire of the Thirteenth Century, Christopher P.

He thanked Qiu Chuji for accepting his invitation and asked if Qiu Chuji had brought the medicine of immortality with him. Qiu Chuji said there was no such thing as a medicine of immortality but that life can be extended through abstinence. Genghis Khan appreciated his honest reply and asked Qiu Chuji who it is that calls him eternal heavenly man, he himself or others.<ref>Page 12, The Mongol Khans and Chinese Buddhism and Taoism, Sechin Jagchid, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Vol.2, No.1, 1979, [http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8475/2382 here]</ref>  After Qiu Chuji replied that others call him by that name Genghis Khan decreed that from thenceforth Qiu Chuji should be called \"Immortal\" and appointed him master of all monks in China, noting that heaven had sent Qiu Chuji to him. Qiu Chuji died in Beijing the same year as Genghis Khan and his shrine became the [[White Cloud Temple]]. Following Khans continued appointing Daoist masters of the [[Quanzhen School]] at White Cloud Temple. The Daoists lost their privilege in 1258 after the Great Debate organized by Genghis Khan's grandson [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] when Chinese Buddhists (led by the Mongol-appointed abbot or ''shaolim zhanglao'' of Shaolin monastery), Confucians and Tibetan Buddhists allied against the Daoists. [[Kublai Khan]] was appointed to preside over this debate (in [[Shangdu]]/Xanadu, the third meeting after two debates in Karakorum in 1255 and 1256) in which 700 dignitaries were present. Kublai Khan had already met Haiyun in 1242 and been swayed towards Buddhism.<ref>Page 14-19, The Mongol Khans and Chinese Buddhism and Taoism, Sechin Jagchid, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Vol.2, No.1, 1979, [http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8475/2382 here]</ref>\n\nGenghis Khan's decree exempting Daoists (''xiansheng''), Buddhists (''toyin''), Christians (''erke'\u00fcd'') and Muslims (''dashmad'') from tax duties were continued by his successors until the end of the Yuan dynasty in 1368.

However, Rashid-al-Din states there were occasions when Genghis Khan forbade Halal butchering. Kublai Khan revived the decree in 1280 after Muslims refused to eat at a banquet. He forbade Halal butchering and circumcision. The decree of Kublai Khan was revoked after a decade. Genghis Khan met Wahid-ud-Din in Afghanistan in 1221 and asked him if the prophet Muhammad predicted a Mongol conqueror. He was initially pleased with Wahid-ud-Din but then dismissed him from his service saying \"I used to consider you a wise and prudent man, but from this speech of yours, it has become evident to me that you do not possess complete understanding and that your comprehension is but small\".<ref>Page 246&ndash;248, Validation by Holiness or Sovereignty: Religious Toleration as Political Theology in the Mongol World Empire of the Thirteenth Century, Christopher P.

To the east and south was the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]], founded by the [[Manchu]]rian [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]], who ruled northern China as well as being the traditional overlords of the Mongolian tribes for centuries.\n\n[[File:Bataille entre mongols & chinois (1211).jpeg|thumb|Battle between Mongol warriors and the [[China|Chinese]]]]\n[[File:Si\u00e8ge de Beijing (1213-1214).jpeg|thumb|Genghis Khan entering [[Beijing]].]]\n\nGenghis Khan organized his people, army, and his state to first prepare for war with Western Xia, or Xi Xia, which was close to the Mongolian lands. He correctly believed that the more powerful young ruler of the Jin dynasty would not come to the aid of Xi Xia. When the Tanguts requested help from the Jin dynasty, they were refused.<ref name=\"resurrection\" /> Despite initial difficulties in capturing its well-defended cities, Genghis Khan managed to force the emperor of Xi Xia to submit to vassal status.\n\n=== Jin dynasty ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty}}\n\nIn 1211, after the conquest of Western Xia, Genghis Khan planned again to conquer the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]]. Wanyan Jiujin, the field commander of the Jin army, made a tactical mistake in not attacking the Mongols at the first opportunity. Instead, the Jin commander sent a messenger, [[Shimo Ming'an|Ming'an]], to the Mongol side, who defected and told the Mongols that the Jin army was waiting on the other side of the pass. At [[Battle of Yehuling|this engagement fought at Yehuling]], the Mongols massacred hundreds of thousands of Jin troops. <!--Decades later, when the [[Taoism|Taoist]] sage [[Qiu Chuji]] was passing through this pass to meet Genghis Khan, he was stunned to still see the bones of so many people scattered in the pass. On his way back, he camped close to this pass for three days and prayed for the departed souls. --> In 1215, Genghis besieged, captured, and sacked the Jin capital of Zhongdu (modern-day [[Beijing]]). This forced the Jin ruler, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Jin|Emperor Xuanzong]], to move his capital south to [[Kaifeng]], abandoning the northern half of his empire to the Mongols. Between 1232 and 1233, [[Mongol siege of Kaifeng|Kaifeng fell to the Mongols]] under the reign of Genghis's third son, \u00d6gedei Khan. The Jin dynasty collapsed in 1234, after the [[siege of Caizhou]].\n\n=== Qara Khitai ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Qara Khitai}}\n\n[[Kuchlug]], the deposed [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Naimans|Naiman]] confederation that Tem\u00fcjin defeated and folded into his Mongol Empire, fled west and usurped the [[khanate]] of [[Qara Khitai]] (also known as the Western Liao, as it was originally established as remnants of the [[Liao dynasty]]). Genghis Khan decided to conquer the Qara Khitai and defeat Kuchlug, possibly to take him out of power. By this time the Mongol army was exhausted from ten years of continuous campaigning in China against the Western Xia and Jin dynasty. Therefore, Genghis sent only two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]] (20,000 soldiers) against Kuchlug, under his younger general, [[Jebe]], known as \"The Arrow\".\n\nWith such a small force, the invading Mongols were forced to change strategies and resort to inciting internal revolt among Kuchlug's supporters, leaving the Qara Khitai more vulnerable to Mongol conquest. As a result, Kuchlug's army was defeated west of [[Kashgar]]. Kuchlug fled again, but was soon hunted down by Jebe's army and executed. By 1218, as a result of the defeat of Qara Khitai, the Mongol Empire and its control extended as far west as [[Lake Balkhash]], which bordered  [[Khwarezmia|Khwarazmia]], a Muslim state that reached the [[Caspian Sea]] to the west and [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Arabian Sea]] to the south.\n\n=== Khwarazmian Empire ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia}}\n\nIn the early 13th century, the [[Khwarazmian dynasty]] was governed by [[Shah]] [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Ala ad-Din Muhammad]]. Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarazmia as a commercial trading partner using the [[Silk Road]], and he initially sent a 500-man [[camel train|caravan]] to establish official trade ties with the empire. However, [[Inalchuq]], the governor of the Khwarazmian city of [[Otrar]], attacked the caravan, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarazmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and hand over the perpetrators. Genghis Khan then sent a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself, instead of the governor Inalchuq. The [[Shah]] had all the men shaved and the Muslim [[decapitation|beheaded]] and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. Outraged, Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers (10 [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]]), his most capable generals and some of his sons. He left a commander and number of troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed [[\u00d6gedei]] to be his immediate successor and then went out to Khwarazmia.\n\n[[File:During the battle of Indus.jpg|thumb|left|Genghis Khan watches in amazement as the [[Khwarezm]]i [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu|Jalal ad-Din]] prepares to ford the [[Indus]].]]\n\nThe Mongol army under Genghis Khan, generals and his sons crossed the [[Tian Shan|Tien Shan]] mountains by entering the area controlled by the [[Khwarezmian Empire|Khwarazmian Empire]]. After compiling intelligence from many sources Genghis Khan carefully prepared his army, which was divided into three groups. His son [[Jochi]] led the first division into the northeast of Khwarazmia. The second division under [[Jebe]] marched secretly to the southeast part of Khwarazmia to form, with the first division, a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] on [[Samarkand]]. The third division under Genghis Khan and [[Tolui]] marched to the northwest and attacked Khwarazmia from that direction.\n\nThe Shah's army was split by diverse internecine feuds and by the Shah's decision to divide his army into small groups concentrated in various cities. This fragmentation was decisive in Khwarazmia's defeats, as it allowed the Mongols, although exhausted from the long journey, to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the Khwarazmian forces instead of facing a unified defense. The Mongol army quickly seized the town of [[Otrar]], relying on superior strategy and tactics. Genghis Khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians, enslaved the rest of the population and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, as retribution for his actions. Near the end of the battle the Shah fled rather than surrender. Genghis Khan ordered [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] to hunt him down, giving them  20,000 men and two years to do this. The Shah died under mysterious circumstances on a small island within his empire.\n\nThe Mongols' conquest, even by their own standards, was brutal. After the capital [[Samarkand]] fell, the capital was moved to [[Bukhara]] by the remaining men, while Genghis Khan ordered two of his generals and their forces to completely destroy the remnants of the Khwarazmian Empire, including not only royal buildings, but entire towns, populations, and even vast swaths of farmland.\n\n[[File:Genghis Khan empire-en.svg|400px|thumb|Significant conquests and movements of Genghis Khan and his generals]]\n\nThe Mongols attacked [[Samarkand]] using captured enemies as body shields. After several days only a few remaining soldiers, loyal supporters of the [[Shah]], held out in the citadel. After the fortress fell, Genghis supposedly reneged on his surrender terms and executed every soldier that had taken arms against him at Samarkand. The people of Samarkand were ordered to evacuate and assemble in a plain outside the city, where they were killed and pyramids of severed heads raised as a symbol of victory.<ref name=\"Juvayni\">\"[https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm Central Asian world cities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118121401/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |date=January 18, 2012 }}\", University of Washington.</ref> [[Ata-Malik Juvayni]], a high official in the service of the Mongol empire, wrote that in [[Termez]], on the [[Oxus]], \"all the people, both men and women, were driven out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their usual custom, then they were all slain\".<ref name=\"Juvayni\" />\n\nThe city of Bukhara was not heavily fortified, with a moat and a single wall, and the citadel typical of Khwarazmian cities. The city leaders opened the gates to the Mongols, though a unit of Turkish defenders held the city's citadel for another twelve days. Survivors from the citadel were executed, artisans and craftsmen were sent back to Mongolia, young men who had not fought were drafted into the Mongolian army and the rest of the population was sent into slavery. As the Mongol soldiers looted the city, a fire broke out, razing most of the city to the ground.<ref name=\"Morgan\">{{cite book\n| last       = Morgan\n| first       = David\n| author-link = David Morgan (historian)\n| title       = The Mongols.

The assault on Urgench proved to be the most difficult battle of the Mongol invasion and the city fell only after the defenders put up a stout defense, fighting block for block. Mongolian casualties were higher than normal, due to the unaccustomed difficulty of adapting Mongolian tactics to city fighting.\n\nAs usual, the artisans were sent back to Mongolia, young women and children were given to the Mongol soldiers as slaves, and the rest of the population was massacred. The Persian scholar [[Ata al-Mulk Juvayni|Juvayni]] states that 50,000 Mongol soldiers were given the task of executing twenty-four Urgench citizens each, which would mean that 1.2&nbsp;million people were killed. The sacking of Urgench is considered one of the [[List of wars and disasters by death toll#Individual battles and sieges|bloodiest massacres in human history]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn the meantime, Genghis Khan selected his third son [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]] as his successor before his army set out, and specified that subsequent Khans should be his direct descendants. Genghis Khan had left [[Muqali]], one of his most trusted generals, in command of all Mongol forces in Jin China while he battled the Khwarezmid Empire to the west.\n\n=== Georgia, Crimea, Kievan Rus and Volga Bulgaria ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasions of Georgia and Armenia|Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria}}\n\n[[File:Gold coin of Genghis Khan, struck at the Ghazna (Ghazni) mint.jpg|thumb|Gold ''[[gold dinar|dinar]]'' of Genghis Khan, struck at the [[Ghazni|Ghazna]] (Ghazni) mint, dated 1221/2]]\n\nAfter the defeat of the Khwarazmian Empire in 1220, Genghis Khan gathered his forces in [[Iran|Persia]] and [[Armenia]] to return to the Mongolian steppes. Under the suggestion of [[Subutai]], the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through [[Afghanistan]] and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]]) contingent marched through the [[Caucasus]] and into Russia under generals [[Jebe]] and Subutai. They pushed deep into [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. The Mongols defeated the [[kingdom of Georgia]], sacked the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] trade-fortress of [[Caffa]] in [[Crimea]] and overwintered near the [[Black Sea]]. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the [[Cuman]]\u2013[[Kipchak people|Kipchaks]] and the poorly coordinated 80,000 [[Kievan Rus']] troops led by [[Mstislav the Bold]] of [[Halych]] and [[Mstislav III of Kiev]] who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. [[Subutai]] sent emissaries to the [[Slavs|Slavic]] princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the [[Battle of Kalka River]] in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force. They may have been defeated by the neighbouring [[Volga Bulgars]] at the [[Battle of Samara Bend]]. There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event.<ref name=\"Chambers31\">John Chambers, ''The Devil's Horsemen: The Mongol Invasion of Europe'', Atheneum, 1979. p.&nbsp;31</ref>  Various historical secondary sources \u2013 Morgan, Chambers, Grousset \u2013 state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory.<ref name=\"Chambers31\" /> The Russian princes then sued for peace. [[Subutai]] agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death. Subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals. Six Russian princes, including [[Mstislav III of Kiev]], were put under this platform and crushed to death.\n\nThe Mongols learned from captives of the abundant green pastures beyond the Bulgar territory, allowing for the planning for [[Mongol invasion of Europe|conquest of Hungary and Europe]]. Genghis Khan recalled Subutai back to Mongolia soon afterwards, and Jebe died on the road back to Samarkand. The famous cavalry expedition led by Subutai and Jebe, in which they encircled the entire Caspian Sea defeating all armies in their path, remains unparalleled to this day, and word of the Mongol triumphs began to trickle to other nations, particularly Europe. These two campaigns are generally regarded as reconnaissance campaigns that tried to get the feel of the political and cultural elements of the regions. In 1225 both divisions returned to Mongolia. These invasions added [[Transoxiana]] and [[Iran|Persia]] to an already formidable empire while destroying any resistance along the way. Later under Genghis Khan's grandson [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and the [[Golden Horde]], the Mongols returned to conquer Volga Bulgaria and Kievan Rus' in 1237, concluding the campaign in 1240.\n\n=== Western Xia and Jin Dynasty ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of China}}\n[[File:Map of China 1142.jpg|thumb|[[Western Xia]] dynasty, [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin/Jurchen dynasty]], [[Song dynasty]] and [[Kingdom of Dali]] in 1142]]\nThe vassal emperor of the Tanguts (Western Xia) had earlier refused to take part in the Mongol war against the Khwarezmid Empire. Western Xia and the defeated Jin dynasty formed a coalition to resist the Mongols, counting on the campaign against the Khwarazmians to preclude the Mongols from responding effectively.\n\nIn 1226, immediately after returning from the west, Genghis Khan began a retaliatory attack on the Tanguts. His armies quickly took Heisui, [[Zhangye|Ganzhou]], and Suzhou (not the Suzhou in Jiangsu province), and in the autumn he took [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Xiliang]]-fu. One of the Tangut generals challenged the Mongols to a battle near [[Helan Mountains]] but was defeated. In November, Genghis laid [[siege]] to the Tangut city [[Lingwu|Lingzhou]] and crossed the [[Yellow River]], defeating the Tangut relief army. According to legend, it was here that Genghis Khan reportedly saw a line of five stars arranged in the sky and interpreted it as an omen of his victory.\n\nIn 1227, Genghis Khan's army attacked and destroyed the Tangut capital of Ning Hia and continued to advance, seizing [[Lintiao]]-fu, [[Xining]] province, [[Xindu]]-fu, and [[Deshun]] province in quick succession in the spring. At Deshun, the Tangut general Ma Jianlong put up a fierce resistance for several days and personally led charges against the invaders outside the city gate. Ma Jianlong later died from wounds received from arrows in battle. Genghis Khan, after conquering Deshun, went to [[Liupanshan]] ([[Qingshui County|Qingshui]] County, [[Gansu]] Province) to escape the severe summer. The new Tangut emperor quickly surrendered to the Mongols, and the rest of the Tanguts officially surrendered soon after. Not happy with their betrayal and resistance, Genghis Khan ordered the entire imperial family to be executed, effectively ending the Tangut lineage.\n\n== Succession ==\nThe succession of Genghis Khan was already a significant topic during the later years of his reign, as he reached old age. The long running paternity discussion about Genghis's oldest son Jochi was particularly contentious because of the seniority of Jochi among the brothers. According to traditional historical accounts, the issue over Jochi's paternity was voiced most strongly by Chagatai. In ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'', just before the invasion of the [[Khwarezmid Empire]] by Genghis Khan, Chagatai declared before his father and brothers that he would never accept Jochi as Genghis Khan's successor. In response to this tension,<ref>{{harvnb|Ratchnevsky|1991|p=126}}</ref> and possibly for other reasons, \u00d6gedei was appointed as successor.\n\n=== \u00d6gedei ===\n{{Main|\u00d6gedei Khan}}\n[[File:CoronationOfOgodei1229.jpg|thumb|right|Genghis Khan (center) at the coronation of his son \u00d6gedei, ''[[Rashid al-Din]]'', early 14th century]]\n\u00d6gedei Khan, born \u00d6gedei (c. 1186<ref name=\"Women and the making of the Mongol Empire\">\"Ogedei died at the age of 56 by Chinese historical standards (55 by modern western standards) in 1241, meaning he was born in 1186\"</ref> \u2013 December 11, 1241) was the third son of Genghis Khan and second Great Khan ([[Khagan]]) of the Mongol Empire. He continued the expansion that his father had begun and was a world figure when the Mongol Empire reached its farthest extent west and south during the invasions of Europe and Asia.\n\n=== Jochi ===\n{{Main|Jochi}}\n\nGenghis Khan was aware of the friction between his sons (particularly between Chagatai and Jochi) and worried of possible conflict between them if he died. He therefore decided to divide his empire among his sons and make all of them Khan in their own right, while appointing one of his sons as his successor. Chagatai was considered unstable due to his temper and rash behavior, because of statements he made that he would not follow Jochi if he were to become his father's successor. [[Tolui]], Genghis Khan's youngest son, was not suitable since in Mongol culture, youngest sons were not given much responsibility due to their age. If Jochi were to become successor, it was likely that Chagatai would engage in warfare with him and collapse the empire. Therefore, Genghis Khan decided to give the throne to \u00d6gedei. \u00d6gedei was seen by Genghis Khan as dependable in character and relatively stable and down to earth and would be a neutral candidate that might defuse the situation between his brothers.\n\nJochi died in 1226, during his father's lifetime. Some scholars, notably Ratchnevsky, have commented on the possibility that Jochi was secretly poisoned by an order from Genghis Khan. Rashid al-Din reports that the great Khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223, and while his brothers heeded the order, Jochi remained in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. Juzjani suggests that the disagreement arose from a quarrel between Jochi and his brothers in the siege of [[Konye-Urgench|Urgench]]. Jochi had attempted to protect Urgench from destruction, as it belonged to territory allocated to him as a fief. He concludes his story with the clearly apocryphal statement by Jochi: \"Genghis Khan is mad to have massacred so many people and laid waste so many lands. I would be doing a service if I killed my father when he is hunting, made an alliance with Sultan Muhammad, brought this land to life and gave assistance and support to the Muslims.\" Juzjani claims that it was in response to hearing of these plans that Genghis Khan ordered his son secretly poisoned; however, as Sultan Muhammad was already dead by 1223, the accuracy of this story is questionable.<ref>{{harvnb|Ratchnevsky|1991|pp=136\u20137}}</ref>\n\n== Death and burial ==\n{{Main|Tomb of Genghis Khan}}\n[[File:Genghis khan empire at his death.png|thumb|Mongol Empire in 1227 at Genghis Khan's death]]\nGenghis Khan died in August 1227, during the fall of [[Yinchuan]], which is the capital of [[Western Xia]].

After he died, his body was returned to [[Mongolia]] and presumably to his birthplace in [[Khentii Province|Khentii Aimag]], where many assume he is buried somewhere close to the [[Onon River]] and the [[Burkhan Khaldun]] mountain (part of the Kentii mountain range). According to legend, the funeral escort killed anyone and anything across their path to conceal where he was finally buried. The [[Genghis Khan Mausoleum]], constructed many years after his death, is his memorial, but not his burial site.\n\n[[File:GhinggisKhanMausoleum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mausoleum of Genghis Khan|Genghis Khan Mausoleum]] in the town of [[Ejin Horo Banner]], [[Inner Mongolia]], China]]\n\nIn 1939 [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist]] soldiers took the mausoleum from its position at the 'Lord's Enclosure' (Mongolian: ''Edsen Khoroo'') in Mongolia to protect it from Japanese troops.

Other tales state that his grave was stampeded over by many horses, and that trees were then planted over the site, and the permafrost also did its part in hiding the burial site.\n\nGenghis Khan left behind an army of more than 129,000 men; 28,000 were given to his various brothers and his sons. Tolui, his youngest son, inherited more than 100,000 men. This force contained the bulk of the elite Mongolian [[cavalry]]. By tradition, the youngest son inherits his father's property. [[Jochi]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], and Kulan's son Gelejian received armies of 4,000 men each. His mother and the descendants of his three brothers received 3,000 men each.\n\n== Mongol Empire ==\n{{Main|Mongol Empire}}\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2018}}<!--very few citations here, see [[WP:SUMMARY]]-->\n\n=== Politics and economics ===\n{{Main|Organization of the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan}}\n\n[[File:Mongol Empire map.gif|thumb|300px|Expansion of the [[Mongol Empire]] 1206\u20131294.]]\n\nThe Mongol Empire was governed by a civilian and military [[code (law)|code]], called the [[Yassa]], created by Genghis Khan. The Mongol Empire did not emphasize the importance of [[ethnicity]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] in the administrative realm, instead adopting an approach grounded in [[meritocracy]]. The exception was the role of Genghis Khan and his family. The Mongol Empire was one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse empires in history, as befitted its size. Many of the empire's nomadic inhabitants considered themselves ''Mongols'' in military and civilian life, including [[Mongols]], [[Turkic people|Turks]] and others and included many diverse [[Khan (title)|Khans]] of various ethnicities as part of the Mongol Empire such as [[Muhammad Khan (Ilkhan)|Muhammad Khan]].\n\nThere were tax exemptions for religious figures and, to some extent, teachers and doctors. The Mongol Empire practiced [[religious tolerance]] because Mongol tradition had long held that religion was a personal concept, and not subject to law or interference.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Sometime before the rise of Genghis Khan, Ong Khan, his mentor and eventual rival, had converted to [[Nestorian Christianity]]. Various Mongol tribes were Shamanist, Buddhist or Christian. Religious tolerance was thus a well established concept on the Asian steppe.\n\nModern Mongolian historians say that towards the end of his life, Genghis Khan attempted to create a [[civilian|civil state]] under the Great Yassa that would have established the legal equality of all individuals, including [[women's rights|women]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/05/09/news/mongol.php|title=Mongolia sees Genghis Khan's good side|work=International Herald Tribune|date=May 10, 2005|author=Pocha, Jehangir S.}}</ref> However, there is no evidence of this, or of the lifting of discriminatory policies towards sedentary peoples such as the Chinese. Women played a relatively important role in the Mongol Empire and in the family, for example [[T\u00f6regene Khatun]] was briefly in charge of the Mongol Empire while the next male leader [[Khagan]] was being chosen. Modern scholars refer to the alleged policy of encouraging trade and communication as the [[Pax Mongolica]] ([[Mongol]] Peace).\n\nGenghis Khan realised that he needed people who could govern cities and states conquered by him. He also realised that such administrators could not be found among his Mongol people because they were nomads and thus had no experience governing cities. For this purpose Genghis Khan invited a [[Khitan people|Khitan]] prince, [[Yel\u00fc Chucai|Chu'Tsai]], who worked for the Jin and had been captured by the Mongol army after the Jin dynasty was defeated. Jin had captured power by displacing Khitan. Genghis told Chu'Tsai, who was a lineal descendant of Khitan rulers, that he had avenged Chu'Tsai's forefathers. Chu'Tsai responded that his father served the Jin dynasty honestly and so did he; also he did not consider his own father his enemy, so the question of revenge did not apply. This reply impressed Genghis Khan. Chu'Tsai administered parts of the Mongol Empire and became a confidant of the successive Mongol Khans.\n\n=== Military ===\n{{Main|Mongol military tactics and organization}}\n\n[[File:Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit, Tech Museum San Jose, 2010.jpg|thumb|Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit in San Jose, California, US]]\n[[File:Mock Mongolian battle at Khaan Quest 07.jpg|thumb|Reenactment of Mongol battle]]\n\nGenghis Khan put absolute trust in his generals, such as [[Muqali]], [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]], and regarded them as close advisors, often extending them the same privileges and trust normally reserved for close family members. He allowed them to make decisions on their own when they embarked on campaigns far from the Mongol Empire capital [[Karakorum]]. Muqali, a trusted lieutenant, was given command of the Mongol forces against the Jin dynasty while Genghis Khan was fighting in Central Asia, and [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] were allowed to pursue the Great Raid into the Caucasus and [[Kievan Rus']], an idea they had presented to the Khagan on their own initiative. While granting his generals a great deal of autonomy in making command decisions, Genghis Khan also expected unwavering loyalty from them.\n\nThe Mongol military was also successful in [[siege warfare]], cutting off resources for cities and towns by diverting certain rivers, taking enemy prisoners and driving them in front of the army, <!--Ratchnevsky, Grousset, Hartog, Morgan, will add ref--> and adopting new ideas, techniques and tools from the people they conquered, particularly in employing Muslim and Chinese siege engines and engineers to aid the Mongol cavalry in capturing cities. Another standard [[military tactics|tactic]] of the Mongol military was the commonly practiced [[Withdrawal (military)|feigned retreat]] to break enemy formations and to lure small enemy groups away from the larger group and defended position for [[ambush]] and [[counterattack]].\n\nAnother important aspect of the military organization of Genghis Khan was the [[transport|communications]] and [[Materiel|supply]] route or ''[[Yam (route)|Yam]]'', adapted from previous Chinese models. Genghis Khan dedicated special attention to this in order to speed up the gathering of [[military intelligence]] and official communications. To this end, Yam waystations were established all over the empire.<ref>Jack Weatherford, Genghis Khan: War of the Khans (New York: Random House, Inc., 2004), 58</ref>\n\n=== Khanates ===\nSeveral years before his death, Genghis Khan divided his empire among his sons [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], [[Tolui]], and [[Jochi]] (Jochi's death several months before Genghis Khan's meant that his lands were instead split between his sons, [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and [[Orda Khan|Orda]]) into several Khanates designed as sub-territories: their [[Khan (title)|Khans]] were expected to follow the [[Great Khan]], who was, initially, \u00d6gedei.\n\n[[File:Harhorin.jpg|thumb|300px|Modern-day location of capital [[Kharakhorum]]]]\nFollowing are the [[Khanate]]s as Genghis Khan assigned them:\n*'''[[Yuan dynasty|Empire of the Great Khan]]''': [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], as ''Great Khan'', took most of Eastern Asia, including China; this territory later to comprise the [[Yuan dynasty]] under [[Kublai Khan]].\n*'''[[Mongol]] homeland''' (present day [[Mongolia]], including [[Karakorum]]): [[Tolui]] Khan, being the youngest son, received a small territory near the Mongol homeland, following Mongol custom.\n*'''[[Chagatai Khanate]]''': [[Chagatai Khan]], Genghis Khan's second son, was given Central Asia and northern [[Iran]].\n*'''[[Blue Horde]]''' to Batu Khan, and '''[[White Horde]]''' to Orda Khan, both were later combined into the [[Kipchak Khanate]], or [[Golden Horde|Khanate of the Golden Horde]], under [[Toqtamysh]]. Genghis Khan's eldest son, Jochi, had received most of the distant Russia and [[Ruthenia]]. Because Jochi died before Genghis Khan, his territory was further split up between his sons. Batu Khan launched an invasion of Russia, and later Hungary and Poland, and crushed several armies before being summoned back by the news of \u00d6gedei's death.\n\n=== After Genghis Khan ===\n{{See also|List of Mongol rulers}}\n\nContrary to popular belief, Genghis Khan did not conquer the whole area of the eventual Mongol Empire. At the time of his death in 1227, the empire stretched from the [[Caspian Sea]] to the [[Sea of Japan]]. Its expansion continued for one or more generations. Under Genghis's successor [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] the speed of expansion reached its peak. Mongol armies pushed into Persia, finished off the [[Western Xia]] and the remnants of the Khwarezmids, clashed with the imperial [[Song dynasty]] of China, and eventually took control of all of China in 1279. They also pushed further into Russia and eastern Europe.\n\n== Perceptions ==\nLike other notable conquerors, Genghis Khan is portrayed differently by conquered peoples than those who conquered with him. Negative views persist in histories written by many cultures from different geographical regions. They often cite the systematic slaughter of civilians in conquered regions, cruelties and destruction by Mongol armies. Other authors also cite positive aspects of Genghis Khan's conquests.\n\n=== Positive ===\n[[File:GhingisHan-rev.jpg|thumb|upright|Genghis Khan on the reverse of a [[Kazakhstan]] 100 [[Kazakhstani tenge|Tenge]] coin. The coin was minted as a collectable to honor the warlord, and is not used in common transactions.]]\n\nGenghis Khan is credited with bringing the [[Silk Road]] under one cohesive political environment. This allowed increased communication and trade between the West, Middle East and Asia, thus expanding the horizons of all three cultural areas. Some historians have noted that Genghis Khan instituted certain levels of [[meritocracy]] in his rule, was tolerant of religions and explained his policies clearly to all his soldiers.<ref>Clive Foss, ''The Tyrants'', page 57, Quercus, London, 2007.</ref>\n\n==== In Mongolia ====\nGenghis Khan had been revered for centuries by Mongols and certain other ethnic groups such as [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], largely because of his association with Mongol statehood, political and military organization, and his victories in war. He eventually evolved into a larger-than-life figure chiefly among the Mongols and is still considered the symbol of [[Mongolian culture]].\n\nDuring the communist period in Mongolia, Genghis was often described as a reactionary, and positive statements about him were avoided.<ref>[http://www.chriskaplonski.com/downloads/Disappearing.pdf Christopher Kaplonski: ''The case of the disappearing Chinggis Khaan].</ref> In 1962, the erection of a monument at his birthplace and a conference held in commemoration of his 800th birthday led to criticism from the Soviet Union and the dismissal of secretary T\u00f6m\u00f6r-Ochir of the ruling [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] [[Central Committee]].\n\n[[File:Chinggis Khan hillside portrait.JPG|thumb|left|Portrait on a hillside in Ulaanbaatar, 2006]]\n\nIn the early 1990s, the memory of Genghis Khan underwent a powerful revival, partly in reaction to its suppression during the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] period. Genghis Khan became one of the central figures of the national identity. He is considered positively by Mongolians for his role in uniting warring tribes. For example, Mongolians often refer to their country as \"Genghis Khan's Mongolia\", to themselves as \"Genghis Khan's children\", and to Genghis Khan as the \"father of the Mongols\" especially among the younger generation. However, there is a chasm in the perception of his brutality. Mongolians maintain that the historical records written by non-Mongolians are unfairly biased against Genghis Khan and that his butchery is exaggerated, while his positive role is underrated.<ref>{{cite news |last=Griffiths |first=Daniel |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6252741.stm?lsf |title=Asia-Pacific &#124; Post-communist Mongolia's struggle. |publisher=BBC News   |date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chinggis Khan Statue Complex (22310875634).jpg|thumb|right|Chinggis Khan Statue Complex (22310875634)]]\n\nIn Mongolia today, Genghis Khan's name and likeness appear on products, streets, buildings, and other places.

This was disrespectful in Mongolian culture and led to a war. Toghrul allied with [[Jamukha]], who already opposed Genghis Khan's forces. However, the dispute between Toghrul and Jamukha, plus the desertion of a number of their allies to Genghis Khan, led to Toghrul's defeat. Jamukha escaped during the conflict. This defeat was a catalyst for the fall and eventual dissolution of the [[Keraites|Keraite]] tribe.\n\nAfter conquering his way steadily through the Alchi Tatars, Keraites, and Uhaz Merkits and acquiring at least one wife each time, Tem\u00fcjin turned to the next threat on the steppe, the Turkic [[Naimans]] under the leadership of [[Tayang khan|Tayang Khan]] with whom Jamukha and his followers took refuge.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Broadbridge|first=Anne F.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RHOFDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|title=Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire|date=2018-07-18|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-63662-9|location=|pages=89|language=en}}</ref> The Naimans did not surrender, although enough sectors again voluntarily sided with Genghis Khan. \n\nIn 1201, a [[kurultai|khuruldai]] elected [[Jamukha]] as [[Khan (title)|G\u00fcr Khan]], \"universal ruler\", a title used by the rulers of the [[Qara Khitai]]. Jamukha's assumption of this title was the final breach with Genghis Khan, and Jamukha formed a coalition of tribes to oppose him. Before the conflict, several generals abandoned Jamukha, including [[Subutai]], [[Jelme]]'s well-known younger brother. After several battles, Jamukha was turned over to Genghis Khan by his own men in 1206.\n\nAccording to the ''Secret History'', Genghis Khan again offered his friendship to [[Jamukha]]. Genghis Khan had killed the men who betrayed Jamukha, stating that he did not want disloyal men in his army. Jamukha refused the offer, saying that there can only be one sun in the sky, and he asked for a noble death. The custom was to die without spilling blood, specifically by having one's back broken. Jamukha requested this form of death, although he was known to have boiled his opponents' generals alive.\n\n=== Sole ruler of the Mongol plains (1206) ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:Genghis Khan's enthronement in 1206.jpg|thumb|250px|Genghis Khan proclaimed Khagan of all Mongols.

The Naimans' defeat left Genghis Khan as the sole ruler of the [[Eurasian Steppe|Mongol steppe]] \u2013 all the prominent confederations fell or united under his Mongol confederation.\n\nAccounts of Genghis Khan's life are marked by claims of a series of betrayals and conspiracies. These include rifts with his early allies such as Jamukha (who also wanted to be a ruler of Mongol tribes) and Wang Khan (his and his father's ally), his son [[Jochi]], and problems with the most important [[shaman]], who allegedly tried to drive a wedge between him and his loyal brother [[Qasar|Khasar]]. His [[military strategy|military strategies]] showed a deep interest in gathering [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and understanding the [[motivation]]s of his rivals, exemplified by his extensive spy network and [[Yam (route)|Yam]] route systems. He seemed to be a quick student, adopting new technologies and ideas that he encountered, such as [[siege warfare]] from the [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|Chinese]]. He was also ruthless, demonstrated by his tactic of [[measuring against the linchpin]], used against the tribes led by Jamukha.\n\nAs a result, by 1206, Genghis Khan had managed to unite or subdue the [[Merkit]]s, [[Naimans]], [[Mongols]], Keraites, [[Tatars]], [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], and other disparate smaller tribes under his rule. This was a monumental feat. It resulted in peace between previously warring tribes, and a single political and military force. The union became known as the Mongols. At a ''[[Kurultai|Khuruldai]]'', a council of Mongol chiefs, Genghis Khan was acknowledged as [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the consolidated tribes and took the new [[#Name and title|title]] \"Genghis Khan\". The title [[Khagan]] was conferred posthumously by his son and successor \u00d6gedei who took the title for himself (as he was also to be posthumously declared the founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]]).\n\n== Religion ==\nGenghis Khan was a [[Tengrist]], but was [[Religious tolerance|religiously tolerant]] and interested in learning philosophical and moral lessons from other religions. He consulted [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monks (including the Zen monk Haiyun), [[Islam|Muslims]], [[Christianity|Christian]] missionaries, and the [[Taoism|Taoist]] monk [[Qiu Chuji]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Teachings and Practices of the Early Quanzhen Taoist Masters |first=Stephen |last=Eskildsen |year=2004 |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |page=17 |isbn=978-0-7914-6045-0}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Fozu Lidai Tongzai'' written by Nian Chang (b. 1282) Genghis Khan's viceroy [[Muqali]] was pacifying Shanxi in 1219, the homeland of Zen Buddhist monk Haiyun (\u6d77\u96f2, 1203-1257), when one of Muqali's Chinese generals, impressed with Haiyun and his master Zhongguan's demeanor, recommended them to Muqali. Muqali then reported on the two to Genghis Khan who issued the following decree on their behalf: \"They truly are men who pray to Heaven. I should like to support them with clothes and food and make them chiefs. I'm planning on gathering many of this kind of people. While praying to Heaven, they should not have difficulties imposed on them. To forbid any mistreatment, they will be authorized to act as ''darqan'' (possessor of immunity).\" Genghis Khan had already met Haiyun in 1214 and been impressed by his reply refusing to grow his hair in the Mongol hairstyle and allowed him to keep his head shaven.<ref>Page 245, Validation by Holiness or Sovereignty: Religious Toleration as Political Theology in the Mongol World Empire of the Thirteenth Century, Christopher P.

He thanked Qiu Chuji for accepting his invitation and asked if Qiu Chuji had brought the medicine of immortality with him. Qiu Chuji said there was no such thing as a medicine of immortality but that life can be extended through abstinence. Genghis Khan appreciated his honest reply and asked Qiu Chuji who it is that calls him eternal heavenly man, he himself or others.<ref>Page 12, The Mongol Khans and Chinese Buddhism and Taoism, Sechin Jagchid, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Vol.2, No.1, 1979, [http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8475/2382 here]</ref>  After Qiu Chuji replied that others call him by that name Genghis Khan decreed that from thenceforth Qiu Chuji should be called \"Immortal\" and appointed him master of all monks in China, noting that heaven had sent Qiu Chuji to him. Qiu Chuji died in Beijing the same year as Genghis Khan and his shrine became the [[White Cloud Temple]]. Following Khans continued appointing Daoist masters of the [[Quanzhen School]] at White Cloud Temple. The Daoists lost their privilege in 1258 after the Great Debate organized by Genghis Khan's grandson [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] when Chinese Buddhists (led by the Mongol-appointed abbot or ''shaolim zhanglao'' of Shaolin monastery), Confucians and Tibetan Buddhists allied against the Daoists. [[Kublai Khan]] was appointed to preside over this debate (in [[Shangdu]]/Xanadu, the third meeting after two debates in Karakorum in 1255 and 1256) in which 700 dignitaries were present.

However, Rashid-al-Din states there were occasions when Genghis Khan forbade Halal butchering. Kublai Khan revived the decree in 1280 after Muslims refused to eat at a banquet. He forbade Halal butchering and circumcision. The decree of Kublai Khan was revoked after a decade. Genghis Khan met Wahid-ud-Din in Afghanistan in 1221 and asked him if the prophet Muhammad predicted a Mongol conqueror.

To the east and south was the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]], founded by the [[Manchu]]rian [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]], who ruled northern China as well as being the traditional overlords of the Mongolian tribes for centuries.\n\n[[File:Bataille entre mongols & chinois (1211).jpeg|thumb|Battle between Mongol warriors and the [[China|Chinese]]]]\n[[File:Si\u00e8ge de Beijing (1213-1214).jpeg|thumb|Genghis Khan entering [[Beijing]].]]\n\nGenghis Khan organized his people, army, and his state to first prepare for war with Western Xia, or Xi Xia, which was close to the Mongolian lands. He correctly believed that the more powerful young ruler of the Jin dynasty would not come to the aid of Xi Xia. When the Tanguts requested help from the Jin dynasty, they were refused.<ref name=\"resurrection\" /> Despite initial difficulties in capturing its well-defended cities, Genghis Khan managed to force the emperor of Xi Xia to submit to vassal status.\n\n=== Jin dynasty ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty}}\n\nIn 1211, after the conquest of Western Xia, Genghis Khan planned again to conquer the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]]. Wanyan Jiujin, the field commander of the Jin army, made a tactical mistake in not attacking the Mongols at the first opportunity. Instead, the Jin commander sent a messenger, [[Shimo Ming'an|Ming'an]], to the Mongol side, who defected and told the Mongols that the Jin army was waiting on the other side of the pass. At [[Battle of Yehuling|this engagement fought at Yehuling]], the Mongols massacred hundreds of thousands of Jin troops. <!--Decades later, when the [[Taoism|Taoist]] sage [[Qiu Chuji]] was passing through this pass to meet Genghis Khan, he was stunned to still see the bones of so many people scattered in the pass. On his way back, he camped close to this pass for three days and prayed for the departed souls. --> In 1215, Genghis besieged, captured, and sacked the Jin capital of Zhongdu (modern-day [[Beijing]]). This forced the Jin ruler, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Jin|Emperor Xuanzong]], to move his capital south to [[Kaifeng]], abandoning the northern half of his empire to the Mongols. Between 1232 and 1233, [[Mongol siege of Kaifeng|Kaifeng fell to the Mongols]] under the reign of Genghis's third son, \u00d6gedei Khan. The Jin dynasty collapsed in 1234, after the [[siege of Caizhou]].\n\n=== Qara Khitai ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Qara Khitai}}\n\n[[Kuchlug]], the deposed [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Naimans|Naiman]] confederation that Tem\u00fcjin defeated and folded into his Mongol Empire, fled west and usurped the [[khanate]] of [[Qara Khitai]] (also known as the Western Liao, as it was originally established as remnants of the [[Liao dynasty]]). Genghis Khan decided to conquer the Qara Khitai and defeat Kuchlug, possibly to take him out of power. By this time the Mongol army was exhausted from ten years of continuous campaigning in China against the Western Xia and Jin dynasty. Therefore, Genghis sent only two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]] (20,000 soldiers) against Kuchlug, under his younger general, [[Jebe]], known as \"The Arrow\".\n\nWith such a small force, the invading Mongols were forced to change strategies and resort to inciting internal revolt among Kuchlug's supporters, leaving the Qara Khitai more vulnerable to Mongol conquest. As a result, Kuchlug's army was defeated west of [[Kashgar]]. Kuchlug fled again, but was soon hunted down by Jebe's army and executed. By 1218, as a result of the defeat of Qara Khitai, the Mongol Empire and its control extended as far west as [[Lake Balkhash]], which bordered  [[Khwarezmia|Khwarazmia]], a Muslim state that reached the [[Caspian Sea]] to the west and [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Arabian Sea]] to the south.\n\n=== Khwarazmian Empire ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia}}\n\nIn the early 13th century, the [[Khwarazmian dynasty]] was governed by [[Shah]] [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Ala ad-Din Muhammad]]. Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarazmia as a commercial trading partner using the [[Silk Road]], and he initially sent a 500-man [[camel train|caravan]] to establish official trade ties with the empire. However, [[Inalchuq]], the governor of the Khwarazmian city of [[Otrar]], attacked the caravan, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarazmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and hand over the perpetrators. Genghis Khan then sent a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself, instead of the governor Inalchuq. The [[Shah]] had all the men shaved and the Muslim [[decapitation|beheaded]] and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. Outraged, Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers (10 [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]]), his most capable generals and some of his sons. He left a commander and number of troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed [[\u00d6gedei]] to be his immediate successor and then went out to Khwarazmia.\n\n[[File:During the battle of Indus.jpg|thumb|left|Genghis Khan watches in amazement as the [[Khwarezm]]i [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu|Jalal ad-Din]] prepares to ford the [[Indus]].]]\n\nThe Mongol army under Genghis Khan, generals and his sons crossed the [[Tian Shan|Tien Shan]] mountains by entering the area controlled by the [[Khwarezmian Empire|Khwarazmian Empire]]. After compiling intelligence from many sources Genghis Khan carefully prepared his army, which was divided into three groups. His son [[Jochi]] led the first division into the northeast of Khwarazmia. The second division under [[Jebe]] marched secretly to the southeast part of Khwarazmia to form, with the first division, a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] on [[Samarkand]]. The third division under Genghis Khan and [[Tolui]] marched to the northwest and attacked Khwarazmia from that direction.\n\nThe Shah's army was split by diverse internecine feuds and by the Shah's decision to divide his army into small groups concentrated in various cities. This fragmentation was decisive in Khwarazmia's defeats, as it allowed the Mongols, although exhausted from the long journey, to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the Khwarazmian forces instead of facing a unified defense. The Mongol army quickly seized the town of [[Otrar]], relying on superior strategy and tactics. Genghis Khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians, enslaved the rest of the population and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, as retribution for his actions. Near the end of the battle the Shah fled rather than surrender. Genghis Khan ordered [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] to hunt him down, giving them  20,000 men and two years to do this. The Shah died under mysterious circumstances on a small island within his empire.\n\nThe Mongols' conquest, even by their own standards, was brutal. After the capital [[Samarkand]] fell, the capital was moved to [[Bukhara]] by the remaining men, while Genghis Khan ordered two of his generals and their forces to completely destroy the remnants of the Khwarazmian Empire, including not only royal buildings, but entire towns, populations, and even vast swaths of farmland.\n\n[[File:Genghis Khan empire-en.svg|400px|thumb|Significant conquests and movements of Genghis Khan and his generals]]\n\nThe Mongols attacked [[Samarkand]] using captured enemies as body shields. After several days only a few remaining soldiers, loyal supporters of the [[Shah]], held out in the citadel. After the fortress fell, Genghis supposedly reneged on his surrender terms and executed every soldier that had taken arms against him at Samarkand. The people of Samarkand were ordered to evacuate and assemble in a plain outside the city, where they were killed and pyramids of severed heads raised as a symbol of victory.<ref name=\"Juvayni\">\"[https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm Central Asian world cities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118121401/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |date=January 18, 2012 }}\", University of Washington.</ref> [[Ata-Malik Juvayni]], a high official in the service of the Mongol empire, wrote that in [[Termez]], on the [[Oxus]], \"all the people, both men and women, were driven out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their usual custom, then they were all slain\".<ref name=\"Juvayni\" />\n\nThe city of Bukhara was not heavily fortified, with a moat and a single wall, and the citadel typical of Khwarazmian cities. The city leaders opened the gates to the Mongols, though a unit of Turkish defenders held the city's citadel for another twelve days. Survivors from the citadel were executed, artisans and craftsmen were sent back to Mongolia, young men who had not fought were drafted into the Mongolian army and the rest of the population was sent into slavery.

The assault on Urgench proved to be the most difficult battle of the Mongol invasion and the city fell only after the defenders put up a stout defense, fighting block for block. Mongolian casualties were higher than normal, due to the unaccustomed difficulty of adapting Mongolian tactics to city fighting.\n\nAs usual, the artisans were sent back to Mongolia, young women and children were given to the Mongol soldiers as slaves, and the rest of the population was massacred. The Persian scholar [[Ata al-Mulk Juvayni|Juvayni]] states that 50,000 Mongol soldiers were given the task of executing twenty-four Urgench citizens each, which would mean that 1.2&nbsp;million people were killed. The sacking of Urgench is considered one of the [[List of wars and disasters by death toll#Individual battles and sieges|bloodiest massacres in human history]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn the meantime, Genghis Khan selected his third son [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]] as his successor before his army set out, and specified that subsequent Khans should be his direct descendants.

Under the suggestion of [[Subutai]], the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through [[Afghanistan]] and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]]) contingent marched through the [[Caucasus]] and into Russia under generals [[Jebe]] and Subutai. They pushed deep into [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. The Mongols defeated the [[kingdom of Georgia]], sacked the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] trade-fortress of [[Caffa]] in [[Crimea]] and overwintered near the [[Black Sea]]. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the [[Cuman]]\u2013[[Kipchak people|Kipchaks]] and the poorly coordinated 80,000 [[Kievan Rus']] troops led by [[Mstislav the Bold]] of [[Halych]] and [[Mstislav III of Kiev]] who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. [[Subutai]] sent emissaries to the [[Slavs|Slavic]] princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the [[Battle of Kalka River]] in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force. They may have been defeated by the neighbouring [[Volga Bulgars]] at the [[Battle of Samara Bend]]. There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event.<ref name=\"Chambers31\">John Chambers, ''The Devil's Horsemen: The Mongol Invasion of Europe'', Atheneum, 1979. p.&nbsp;31</ref>  Various historical secondary sources \u2013 Morgan, Chambers, Grousset \u2013 state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory.<ref name=\"Chambers31\" /> The Russian princes then sued for peace. [[Subutai]] agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death. Subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals. Six Russian princes, including [[Mstislav III of Kiev]], were put under this platform and crushed to death.\n\nThe Mongols learned from captives of the abundant green pastures beyond the Bulgar territory, allowing for the planning for [[Mongol invasion of Europe|conquest of Hungary and Europe]]. Genghis Khan recalled Subutai back to Mongolia soon afterwards, and Jebe died on the road back to Samarkand. The famous cavalry expedition led by Subutai and Jebe, in which they encircled the entire Caspian Sea defeating all armies in their path, remains unparalleled to this day, and word of the Mongol triumphs began to trickle to other nations, particularly Europe. These two campaigns are generally regarded as reconnaissance campaigns that tried to get the feel of the political and cultural elements of the regions. In 1225 both divisions returned to Mongolia. These invasions added [[Transoxiana]] and [[Iran|Persia]] to an already formidable empire while destroying any resistance along the way. Later under Genghis Khan's grandson [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and the [[Golden Horde]], the Mongols returned to conquer Volga Bulgaria and Kievan Rus' in 1237, concluding the campaign in 1240.\n\n=== Western Xia and Jin Dynasty ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of China}}\n[[File:Map of China 1142.jpg|thumb|[[Western Xia]] dynasty, [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin/Jurchen dynasty]], [[Song dynasty]] and [[Kingdom of Dali]] in 1142]]\nThe vassal emperor of the Tanguts (Western Xia) had earlier refused to take part in the Mongol war against the Khwarezmid Empire. Western Xia and the defeated Jin dynasty formed a coalition to resist the Mongols, counting on the campaign against the Khwarazmians to preclude the Mongols from responding effectively.\n\nIn 1226, immediately after returning from the west, Genghis Khan began a retaliatory attack on the Tanguts. His armies quickly took Heisui, [[Zhangye|Ganzhou]], and Suzhou (not the Suzhou in Jiangsu province), and in the autumn he took [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Xiliang]]-fu. One of the Tangut generals challenged the Mongols to a battle near [[Helan Mountains]] but was defeated. In November, Genghis laid [[siege]] to the Tangut city [[Lingwu|Lingzhou]] and crossed the [[Yellow River]], defeating the Tangut relief army. According to legend, it was here that Genghis Khan reportedly saw a line of five stars arranged in the sky and interpreted it as an omen of his victory.\n\nIn 1227, Genghis Khan's army attacked and destroyed the Tangut capital of Ning Hia and continued to advance, seizing [[Lintiao]]-fu, [[Xining]] province, [[Xindu]]-fu, and [[Deshun]] province in quick succession in the spring. At Deshun, the Tangut general Ma Jianlong put up a fierce resistance for several days and personally led charges against the invaders outside the city gate. Ma Jianlong later died from wounds received from arrows in battle. Genghis Khan, after conquering Deshun, went to [[Liupanshan]] ([[Qingshui County|Qingshui]] County, [[Gansu]] Province) to escape the severe summer. The new Tangut emperor quickly surrendered to the Mongols, and the rest of the Tanguts officially surrendered soon after. Not happy with their betrayal and resistance, Genghis Khan ordered the entire imperial family to be executed, effectively ending the Tangut lineage.\n\n== Succession ==\nThe succession of Genghis Khan was already a significant topic during the later years of his reign, as he reached old age. The long running paternity discussion about Genghis's oldest son Jochi was particularly contentious because of the seniority of Jochi among the brothers. According to traditional historical accounts, the issue over Jochi's paternity was voiced most strongly by Chagatai. In ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'', just before the invasion of the [[Khwarezmid Empire]] by Genghis Khan, Chagatai declared before his father and brothers that he would never accept Jochi as Genghis Khan's successor. In response to this tension,<ref>{{harvnb|Ratchnevsky|1991|p=126}}</ref> and possibly for other reasons, \u00d6gedei was appointed as successor.\n\n=== \u00d6gedei ===\n{{Main|\u00d6gedei Khan}}\n[[File:CoronationOfOgodei1229.jpg|thumb|right|Genghis Khan (center) at the coronation of his son \u00d6gedei, ''[[Rashid al-Din]]'', early 14th century]]\n\u00d6gedei Khan, born \u00d6gedei (c. 1186<ref name=\"Women and the making of the Mongol Empire\">\"Ogedei died at the age of 56 by Chinese historical standards (55 by modern western standards) in 1241, meaning he was born in 1186\"</ref> \u2013 December 11, 1241) was the third son of Genghis Khan and second Great Khan ([[Khagan]]) of the Mongol Empire. He continued the expansion that his father had begun and was a world figure when the Mongol Empire reached its farthest extent west and south during the invasions of Europe and Asia.\n\n=== Jochi ===\n{{Main|Jochi}}\n\nGenghis Khan was aware of the friction between his sons (particularly between Chagatai and Jochi) and worried of possible conflict between them if he died. He therefore decided to divide his empire among his sons and make all of them Khan in their own right, while appointing one of his sons as his successor. Chagatai was considered unstable due to his temper and rash behavior, because of statements he made that he would not follow Jochi if he were to become his father's successor. [[Tolui]], Genghis Khan's youngest son, was not suitable since in Mongol culture, youngest sons were not given much responsibility due to their age. If Jochi were to become successor, it was likely that Chagatai would engage in warfare with him and collapse the empire. Therefore, Genghis Khan decided to give the throne to \u00d6gedei. \u00d6gedei was seen by Genghis Khan as dependable in character and relatively stable and down to earth and would be a neutral candidate that might defuse the situation between his brothers.\n\nJochi died in 1226, during his father's lifetime. Some scholars, notably Ratchnevsky, have commented on the possibility that Jochi was secretly poisoned by an order from Genghis Khan. Rashid al-Din reports that the great Khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223, and while his brothers heeded the order, Jochi remained in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. Juzjani suggests that the disagreement arose from a quarrel between Jochi and his brothers in the siege of [[Konye-Urgench|Urgench]]. Jochi had attempted to protect Urgench from destruction, as it belonged to territory allocated to him as a fief. He concludes his story with the clearly apocryphal statement by Jochi: \"Genghis Khan is mad to have massacred so many people and laid waste so many lands. I would be doing a service if I killed my father when he is hunting, made an alliance with Sultan Muhammad, brought this land to life and gave assistance and support to the Muslims.\" Juzjani claims that it was in response to hearing of these plans that Genghis Khan ordered his son secretly poisoned; however, as Sultan Muhammad was already dead by 1223, the accuracy of this story is questionable.<ref>{{harvnb|Ratchnevsky|1991|pp=136\u20137}}</ref>\n\n== Death and burial ==\n{{Main|Tomb of Genghis Khan}}\n[[File:Genghis khan empire at his death.png|thumb|Mongol Empire in 1227 at Genghis Khan's death]]\nGenghis Khan died in August 1227, during the fall of [[Yinchuan]], which is the capital of [[Western Xia]].

After he died, his body was returned to [[Mongolia]] and presumably to his birthplace in [[Khentii Province|Khentii Aimag]], where many assume he is buried somewhere close to the [[Onon River]] and the [[Burkhan Khaldun]] mountain (part of the Kentii mountain range). According to legend, the funeral escort killed anyone and anything across their path to conceal where he was finally buried. The [[Genghis Khan Mausoleum]], constructed many years after his death, is his memorial, but not his burial site.\n\n[[File:GhinggisKhanMausoleum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mausoleum of Genghis Khan|Genghis Khan Mausoleum]] in the town of [[Ejin Horo Banner]], [[Inner Mongolia]], China]]\n\nIn 1939 [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist]] soldiers took the mausoleum from its position at the 'Lord's Enclosure' (Mongolian: ''Edsen Khoroo'') in Mongolia to protect it from Japanese troops. It was taken through Communist-held territory in [[Yan'an]] some {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on}} on carts to safety at a Buddhist monastery, the Dongshan Dafo Dian, where it remained for ten years. In 1949, as Communist troops advanced, the Nationalist soldiers moved it another {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} farther west to the famous Tibetan monastery of [[Kumbum Monastery]] or Ta'er Shi near [[Xining]], which soon fell under Communist control.

Other tales state that his grave was stampeded over by many horses, and that trees were then planted over the site, and the permafrost also did its part in hiding the burial site.\n\nGenghis Khan left behind an army of more than 129,000 men; 28,000 were given to his various brothers and his sons. Tolui, his youngest son, inherited more than 100,000 men. This force contained the bulk of the elite Mongolian [[cavalry]]. By tradition, the youngest son inherits his father's property. [[Jochi]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], and Kulan's son Gelejian received armies of 4,000 men each. His mother and the descendants of his three brothers received 3,000 men each.\n\n== Mongol Empire ==\n{{Main|Mongol Empire}}\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2018}}<!--very few citations here, see [[WP:SUMMARY]]-->\n\n=== Politics and economics ===\n{{Main|Organization of the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan}}\n\n[[File:Mongol Empire map.gif|thumb|300px|Expansion of the [[Mongol Empire]] 1206\u20131294.]]\n\nThe Mongol Empire was governed by a civilian and military [[code (law)|code]], called the [[Yassa]], created by Genghis Khan. The Mongol Empire did not emphasize the importance of [[ethnicity]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] in the administrative realm, instead adopting an approach grounded in [[meritocracy]]. The exception was the role of Genghis Khan and his family. The Mongol Empire was one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse empires in history, as befitted its size. Many of the empire's nomadic inhabitants considered themselves ''Mongols'' in military and civilian life, including [[Mongols]], [[Turkic people|Turks]] and others and included many diverse [[Khan (title)|Khans]] of various ethnicities as part of the Mongol Empire such as [[Muhammad Khan (Ilkhan)|Muhammad Khan]].\n\nThere were tax exemptions for religious figures and, to some extent, teachers and doctors. The Mongol Empire practiced [[religious tolerance]] because Mongol tradition had long held that religion was a personal concept, and not subject to law or interference.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Sometime before the rise of Genghis Khan, Ong Khan, his mentor and eventual rival, had converted to [[Nestorian Christianity]]. Various Mongol tribes were Shamanist, Buddhist or Christian. Religious tolerance was thus a well established concept on the Asian steppe.\n\nModern Mongolian historians say that towards the end of his life, Genghis Khan attempted to create a [[civilian|civil state]] under the Great Yassa that would have established the legal equality of all individuals, including [[women's rights|women]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/05/09/news/mongol.php|title=Mongolia sees Genghis Khan's good side|work=International Herald Tribune|date=May 10, 2005|author=Pocha, Jehangir S.}}</ref> However, there is no evidence of this, or of the lifting of discriminatory policies towards sedentary peoples such as the Chinese. Women played a relatively important role in the Mongol Empire and in the family, for example [[T\u00f6regene Khatun]] was briefly in charge of the Mongol Empire while the next male leader [[Khagan]] was being chosen. Modern scholars refer to the alleged policy of encouraging trade and communication as the [[Pax Mongolica]] ([[Mongol]] Peace).\n\nGenghis Khan realised that he needed people who could govern cities and states conquered by him. He also realised that such administrators could not be found among his Mongol people because they were nomads and thus had no experience governing cities. For this purpose Genghis Khan invited a [[Khitan people|Khitan]] prince, [[Yel\u00fc Chucai|Chu'Tsai]], who worked for the Jin and had been captured by the Mongol army after the Jin dynasty was defeated. Jin had captured power by displacing Khitan. Genghis told Chu'Tsai, who was a lineal descendant of Khitan rulers, that he had avenged Chu'Tsai's forefathers. Chu'Tsai responded that his father served the Jin dynasty honestly and so did he; also he did not consider his own father his enemy, so the question of revenge did not apply. This reply impressed Genghis Khan. Chu'Tsai administered parts of the Mongol Empire and became a confidant of the successive Mongol Khans.\n\n=== Military ===\n{{Main|Mongol military tactics and organization}}\n\n[[File:Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit, Tech Museum San Jose, 2010.jpg|thumb|Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit in San Jose, California, US]]\n[[File:Mock Mongolian battle at Khaan Quest 07.jpg|thumb|Reenactment of Mongol battle]]\n\nGenghis Khan put absolute trust in his generals, such as [[Muqali]], [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]], and regarded them as close advisors, often extending them the same privileges and trust normally reserved for close family members. He allowed them to make decisions on their own when they embarked on campaigns far from the Mongol Empire capital [[Karakorum]]. Muqali, a trusted lieutenant, was given command of the Mongol forces against the Jin dynasty while Genghis Khan was fighting in Central Asia, and [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] were allowed to pursue the Great Raid into the Caucasus and [[Kievan Rus']], an idea they had presented to the Khagan on their own initiative. While granting his generals a great deal of autonomy in making command decisions, Genghis Khan also expected unwavering loyalty from them.\n\nThe Mongol military was also successful in [[siege warfare]], cutting off resources for cities and towns by diverting certain rivers, taking enemy prisoners and driving them in front of the army, <!--Ratchnevsky, Grousset, Hartog, Morgan, will add ref--> and adopting new ideas, techniques and tools from the people they conquered, particularly in employing Muslim and Chinese siege engines and engineers to aid the Mongol cavalry in capturing cities. Another standard [[military tactics|tactic]] of the Mongol military was the commonly practiced [[Withdrawal (military)|feigned retreat]] to break enemy formations and to lure small enemy groups away from the larger group and defended position for [[ambush]] and [[counterattack]].\n\nAnother important aspect of the military organization of Genghis Khan was the [[transport|communications]] and [[Materiel|supply]] route or ''[[Yam (route)|Yam]]'', adapted from previous Chinese models. Genghis Khan dedicated special attention to this in order to speed up the gathering of [[military intelligence]] and official communications. To this end, Yam waystations were established all over the empire.<ref>Jack Weatherford, Genghis Khan: War of the Khans (New York: Random House, Inc., 2004), 58</ref>\n\n=== Khanates ===\nSeveral years before his death, Genghis Khan divided his empire among his sons [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], [[Tolui]], and [[Jochi]] (Jochi's death several months before Genghis Khan's meant that his lands were instead split between his sons, [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and [[Orda Khan|Orda]]) into several Khanates designed as sub-territories: their [[Khan (title)|Khans]] were expected to follow the [[Great Khan]], who was, initially, \u00d6gedei.\n\n[[File:Harhorin.jpg|thumb|300px|Modern-day location of capital [[Kharakhorum]]]]\nFollowing are the [[Khanate]]s as Genghis Khan assigned them:\n*'''[[Yuan dynasty|Empire of the Great Khan]]''': [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], as ''Great Khan'', took most of Eastern Asia, including China; this territory later to comprise the [[Yuan dynasty]] under [[Kublai Khan]].\n*'''[[Mongol]] homeland''' (present day [[Mongolia]], including [[Karakorum]]): [[Tolui]] Khan, being the youngest son, received a small territory near the Mongol homeland, following Mongol custom.\n*'''[[Chagatai Khanate]]''': [[Chagatai Khan]], Genghis Khan's second son, was given Central Asia and northern [[Iran]].\n*'''[[Blue Horde]]''' to Batu Khan, and '''[[White Horde]]''' to Orda Khan, both were later combined into the [[Kipchak Khanate]], or [[Golden Horde|Khanate of the Golden Horde]], under [[Toqtamysh]]. Genghis Khan's eldest son, Jochi, had received most of the distant Russia and [[Ruthenia]]. Because Jochi died before Genghis Khan, his territory was further split up between his sons. Batu Khan launched an invasion of Russia, and later Hungary and Poland, and crushed several armies before being summoned back by the news of \u00d6gedei's death.\n\n=== After Genghis Khan ===\n{{See also|List of Mongol rulers}}\n\nContrary to popular belief, Genghis Khan did not conquer the whole area of the eventual Mongol Empire. At the time of his death in 1227, the empire stretched from the [[Caspian Sea]] to the [[Sea of Japan]]. Its expansion continued for one or more generations. Under Genghis's successor [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] the speed of expansion reached its peak. Mongol armies pushed into Persia, finished off the [[Western Xia]] and the remnants of the Khwarezmids, clashed with the imperial [[Song dynasty]] of China, and eventually took control of all of China in 1279. They also pushed further into Russia and eastern Europe.\n\n== Perceptions ==\nLike other notable conquerors, Genghis Khan is portrayed differently by conquered peoples than those who conquered with him. Negative views persist in histories written by many cultures from different geographical regions. They often cite the systematic slaughter of civilians in conquered regions, cruelties and destruction by Mongol armies. Other authors also cite positive aspects of Genghis Khan's conquests.\n\n=== Positive ===\n[[File:GhingisHan-rev.jpg|thumb|upright|Genghis Khan on the reverse of a [[Kazakhstan]] 100 [[Kazakhstani tenge|Tenge]] coin. The coin was minted as a collectable to honor the warlord, and is not used in common transactions.]]\n\nGenghis Khan is credited with bringing the [[Silk Road]] under one cohesive political environment. This allowed increased communication and trade between the West, Middle East and Asia, thus expanding the horizons of all three cultural areas. Some historians have noted that Genghis Khan instituted certain levels of [[meritocracy]] in his rule, was tolerant of religions and explained his policies clearly to all his soldiers.<ref>Clive Foss, ''The Tyrants'', page 57, Quercus, London, 2007.</ref>\n\n==== In Mongolia ====\nGenghis Khan had been revered for centuries by Mongols and certain other ethnic groups such as [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], largely because of his association with Mongol statehood, political and military organization, and his victories in war. He eventually evolved into a larger-than-life figure chiefly among the Mongols and is still considered the symbol of [[Mongolian culture]].\n\nDuring the communist period in Mongolia, Genghis was often described as a reactionary, and positive statements about him were avoided.<ref>[http://www.chriskaplonski.com/downloads/Disappearing.pdf Christopher Kaplonski: ''The case of the disappearing Chinggis Khaan].</ref> In 1962, the erection of a monument at his birthplace and a conference held in commemoration of his 800th birthday led to criticism from the Soviet Union and the dismissal of secretary T\u00f6m\u00f6r-Ochir of the ruling [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] [[Central Committee]].\n\n[[File:Chinggis Khan hillside portrait.JPG|thumb|left|Portrait on a hillside in Ulaanbaatar, 2006]]\n\nIn the early 1990s, the memory of Genghis Khan underwent a powerful revival, partly in reaction to its suppression during the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] period. Genghis Khan became one of the central figures of the national identity. He is considered positively by Mongolians for his role in uniting warring tribes. For example, Mongolians often refer to their country as \"Genghis Khan's Mongolia\", to themselves as \"Genghis Khan's children\", and to Genghis Khan as the \"father of the Mongols\" especially among the younger generation. However, there is a chasm in the perception of his brutality. Mongolians maintain that the historical records written by non-Mongolians are unfairly biased against Genghis Khan and that his butchery is exaggerated, while his positive role is underrated.<ref>{{cite news |last=Griffiths |first=Daniel |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6252741.stm?lsf |title=Asia-Pacific &#124; Post-communist Mongolia's struggle. |publisher=BBC News   |date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chinggis Khan Statue Complex (22310875634).jpg|thumb|right|Chinggis Khan Statue Complex (22310875634)]]\n\nIn Mongolia today, Genghis Khan's name and likeness appear on products, streets, buildings, and other places.

The name \"Tem\u00fcjin\" is believed to derive from the word ''tem\u00fcr'', Turkic for iron (modern Mongolian: {{lang|mn|\u0442\u04e9\u043c\u04e9\u0440}}, ''t\u00f6m\u00f6r''). The name would imply a blacksmith or a man strong like iron.\n\nNo evidence has survived to indicate that Genghis Khan had any exceptional training or reputation as a blacksmith. But the latter interpretation (a man strong like iron) is supported by the names of Genghis Khan's siblings, Tem\u00fclin and Tem\u00fcge, which are derived from the same root word.\n\n=== Name and spelling variations ===\n<!-- This section is linked from 'Genghis Khan' -->\nGenghis Khan is spelled in a variety of ways in different languages such as [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] Chinggis Khaan, English ''Chinghiz'', ''Chinghis'', and ''Chingiz'', {{zh|c=\u6210\u5409\u601d\u6c57|p=Ch\u00e9ngj\u00eds\u012b H\u00e1n}}, [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]: ''Cengiz Han'', ''\u00c7ingiz Xan'', ''Chingizxon'', ''Sh\u0131n'g'\u0131sxan'', ''\u00c7ingiz Han'' ''\u00c7\u0131\u00f1\u011f\u0131z Xan'', ''\u015e\u0131\u00f1\u011f\u0131s xan'', ''\u00c7i\u00f1\u011fiz Xaan'', ''\u00c7i\u00f1\u011fizhan'', [[Russian languages|Russian]]: \u0427\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0445\u0430\u043d (''\u010cingiskhan'') or \u0427\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0438\u0437-\u0445\u0430\u043d (''\u010cingiz-khan''), etc. Tem\u00fcjin is written in Chinese as {{zh|s=\u94c1\u6728\u771f|t=\u9435\u6728\u771e|p=Ti\u011bm\u00f9zh\u0113n}}.\n\nWhen [[Kublai Khan]] established the [[Yuan dynasty]] in 1271, he had his grandfather Genghis Khan placed on the official record as the founder of the dynasty or ''Taizu'' ({{zh|\u592a\u7956|T\u00e0iz\u01d4}}).

It was a highly organised campaign, mostly fought in the marketplace between logging companies, timber traders and their retail customers in Europe and North America. It also involved pushing the industry as a whole to accept [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC) certified products that guaranteed legal and sustainable products, now widely recognised in both the timber and paper sectors as the mark of sustainability.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nSauven actively campaigns to halt the [[deforestation]] of the [[tropical rainforests]] of the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], by companies planting soya beans, having coordinated the international campaign to secure a moratorium on further destruction of the Amazon. This was achieved through bringing together a huge alliance of US and European multinationals along with Brazilian counterparts involved in the soya producing, commodity trading and food retailing sectors. It was one of Greenpeace's most successful campaigns to protect large areas of the world's last intact rainforests providing both climate and biodiversity protection.

As director, Sauven has helped to shape Greenpeace UK's commitment to defend the natural world and promote peace by investigating, exposing himself and confronting environmental abuse, and championing environmentally responsible solutions.<ref name=\"Greenpeace UK: What we do\">{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/what-we-do|title=Greenpeace: What we do}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n\nJohn Sauven was educated at [[St Benedict's School, Ealing|St Benedict's School]], Ealing and trained as an economist at [[University of Cardiff]] graduating with a BSc (Econ).<ref name=\"John Sauven: 'I want to claim the arctic region for all of mankind'\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/john-sauven-i-want-to-claim-the-arctic-region-for-all-of-mankind-2353171.html|title=John Sauven: 'I want to claim the arctic region for all of mankind'|publisher=The Independent|date=12 September 2011|accessdate=28 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\nSauven actively campaigns to ban underground [[nuclear testing]] in the Pacific and campaigns against the [[UK Trident programme]], the United Kingdom's missile-based nuclear weapons programme.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nHe campaigns to protect the temperate [[rainforests]] on the west coast of Canada, helping to save the [[Great Bear Rainforest]] in northwest Canada from commercial logging. It was a highly organised campaign, mostly fought in the marketplace between logging companies, timber traders and their retail customers in Europe and North America. It also involved pushing the industry as a whole to accept [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC) certified products that guaranteed legal and sustainable products, now widely recognised in both the timber and paper sectors as the mark of sustainability.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nSauven actively campaigns to halt the [[deforestation]] of the [[tropical rainforests]] of the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], by companies planting soya beans, having coordinated the international campaign to secure a moratorium on further destruction of the Amazon. This was achieved through bringing together a huge alliance of US and European multinationals along with Brazilian counterparts involved in the soya producing, commodity trading and food retailing sectors. It was one of Greenpeace's most successful campaigns to protect large areas of the world's last intact rainforests providing both climate and biodiversity protection. Similar tactics were used to direct campaigns to halt the deforestation of the forests of [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] and [[Indonesia]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nSauven helped to develop Greenpeace's \"Greenfreeze\" campaign (greenfreeze technology is now a global refrigeration industry standard utilising [[isobutane]] and [[propane]] as [[refrigerant]]s and [[cyclopentane]] for producing the insulating foam<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acr-news.com/are-our-fridges-safe |title=Are our fridges safe? |publisher=Acr-news.com |date=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2017-02-18}}</ref>) to protect the ozone layer from disappearing because of our use of CFCs and other ozone layer destroying chemicals.

Sauven advocates urgent action to protect the area of sea ice around the North Pole, which is currently not national territory, by designating the area a 'global commons', collectively owned by humanity under the auspices of the United Nations.\"<ref name=\"John Sauven: 'I want to claim the arctic region for all of mankind'\"/>\n\nIn specialising on solutions and working with business, Sauven is conscious that Greenpeace's ongoing work may win fewer headlines, but the effort to evolve new, more sustainable business models is where the future will be won or lost. This is particularly the case with climate change where cleaner, more efficient products, processes and ways of producing energy need to be brought to market by government regulation and company innovation.<ref name=\"Discussion Point, John Sauven\"/>\n\nAs well as his work with Greenpeace, Sauven has edited ''Sanity'', the magazine of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, [[CND]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nSauven has collaborated on several award winning films with film director [[Julian Temple]] and film producer Eski Thomas, commissioning ''The Ancient Forests'' to which [[David Attenborough|Sir David Attenborough]], [[Ewan McGregor]] and [[Andy Serkis]] lent their talents.<ref name=\"Greenpeace's The Ancient Forests\">{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/forests/the-ancient-forests|title=Greenpeace's The Ancient Forests|access-date=29 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404075345/http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/forests/the-ancient-forests|archive-date=4 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, John became a board member of ''Videre Est Credere'' (Latin for \"to see is to believe\") a UK Human Rights Charity.<ref>UK Charity Commission, [http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1130375&SubsidiaryNumber=0 UK Charity Commission Report on Videre], UK Charity Commission, 20 August 2013</ref> Videre describes itself as \"give[ing] local activists the equipment, training and support needed to safely capture compelling video evidence of human rights violations.
