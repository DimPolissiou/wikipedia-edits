In turn, there are a few factors that are likely to have an influence over the type of watchdog performance in the journalism.\n\n*''[[Democracy]]'': Watchdog journalism can work effectively in well-established democratic countries. This is because in such countries, there is high level of the freedom of the press and journalistic autonomy and independence.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hallin, Daniel C.

To be specific, according to what Mellado et al. (2017) found in five Latin American countries, the media that serves the interests of the right or of the moderation is less likely to work as the watchdog journalism than the media serving interests of left party do.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mellado|first=Claudia|last2=Hellmueller|first2=Lea|last3=M\u00e1rquez-Ram\u00edrez|first3=Mireya|last4=Humanes|first4=Maria Luisa|last5=Sparks|first5=Colin|last6=Stepinska|first6=Agnieszka|last7=Pasti|first7=Svetlana|last8=Schielicke|first8=Anna-Maria|last9=Tandoc|first9=Edson|last10=Wang|first10=Haiyan|date=2017-11-02|title=The Hybridization of Journalistic Cultures: A Comparative Study of Journalistic Role Performance|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=67|issue=6|pages=944\u2013967|doi=10.1111/jcom.12339|issn=0021-9916}}</ref> In addition, biased tendency of the media has a great impact on the coverage of the political issues or scandals.\n*''News beats'': The performance of the watchdog journalism is influenced by journalistic specialization.

The detached watchdog journalism is predominant especially in the western countries such as Germany, the United States, Austria, and Switzerland.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIn the detached approach, the most predominant form of watchdog journalism, criticism and question which are done by sources are the least intense levels of scrutiny.

It involved [[Richard Nixon]], the 37th president of the United States and led him to resignation. This scandal stemmed from the attempts of 5 former [[FBI]] and [[CIA]] agents broke in the Democratic National Committee headquarters which is located at the [[Watergate Office Building]], Washington D.C.

As a result, the impeachment against Richard Nixon was approved by the House judiciary committee.<ref name=\":2\" /> He resigned from all of offices on August 9, 1974.\n\n[[File:Carl bernstein 2007.jpg|thumb|233x233px|Carl Bernstein, the investigative journalist of The Washington Post]]\n\n=== The role of Washington Post as watchdog journalism in the case of Watergate scandal ===\nThe case of Watergate scandal is the most famous example showing the role of watchdog journalism, how it works and even further, its impact. The media, especially, The Washington Post, significantly contributed to highlight the fact that there\u2019s the rotten connection between the breaking in the Watergate Office and Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election committee.<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition, its coverage led to an explosion of publicity and public attention. To cover the scandal, anonymous sources became the main material that The Washington Post heavily relied on. Specifically, the Washington Post\u2019s investigative journalists named [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] played a really important role. <ref name=\":2\" /> They uncovered information and evidence that proved the agents' break-in to plant a bug and attempts to conceal it which result in the intervention of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], and the [[White House]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition, they conducted interviews with a witness named [[Judy Hoback Miller]]. He was the book keep who worked at the Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election committee and had an evidence showing how Richard Nixon and his committee mishandled the funds and destroyed the records, the evidence of conspiracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The most valuable and reliable anonymous sources came from person who didn\u2019t reveal his identity at the time. He was called Deep Throat by Woodward and Bernstein.<ref name=\":2\" /> Every meeting between investigative journalists of The Washington Post and Deep Throat was held secretly.<ref name=\":2\" /> And through these meetings, involvement of the Richard Nixon, his committee and the White House was revealed. Later, it was also revealed that Deep Throat, the anonymous informant, is the deputy director of the FBI during 1970s named William Mark Felt, Sr.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nEven though watchdog journalism plays an really important role for democracy in a society, it cannot avoid of being criticized and disappearing.<ref name=\":10\" /> Since several years ago, watchdog journalism tends to decrease. As a result, watchdog reporting is rarely to be handled by media no matter the types of the channel.<ref name=\":10\" /> This tendency is because what journalists pursue is different from the past. specifically, most journalists these day prefer simply reflecting the status quo to scrutinizing and challenging it.<ref name=\":10\" /> However, the problem is that there are still issues, corruptions, and scandals that have to be covered by journalist. For example, even the situation in the United States, the country where watchdog journalists forced the president out of the White House also shows this tendency.<ref name=\":10\" /> In 2003, the U.S media reported widely on Iraq War and in the process, it was revealed that most media don't function as the critical and skeptical watchdog journalism. <ref name=\":10\" /> In addition, there is also a voice saying that watchdog journalism does not work for a democracy and a healthy society anymore, rather it works to serve journalists' own interests.<ref name=\":10\" /><br />\n\n=== Crisis in watchdog journalism  ===\n[[File:University of Illinois at Chicago circle logo.svg|thumb|131x131px|University of Illinois at Chiage circle logo]]Journalism\u2019s role as a watchdog is in danger of disappearing in a lot of societies and countries across the world. Basically, watchdog journalism has to force people in power, for instance government officials, to take a responsibility of their actions that affect public's way of living.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, since local news media and newspaper have faced closing or consolidation, it is hard to see journalism that watches those in power.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/816b31f8571d4b759227e58c6252e99d|title=Loss of local news hinders ability to watchdog government|date=2019-03-11|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> To be specific, in the case of the United States, the phenomenon of disappearing a local newspaper has happened in more than 1,400 cities since 15 years ago according to an [[Associated Press]]'s research which was conducted through data gathered by the [[University of North Carolina]].<ref name=\":3\" /> And those cities are where watchdog journalism that reports issues and problems caused by actions of a corrupt people in power is necessarily needed. As a result, several negative outcomes for the community has been brought. Foremost, rotten actions of people in power such as politicians are unable to be criticized and watched. This is because there is no transparency that can solve problems and achieve a healthy democracy. <ref name=\":3\" />[[File:University of Notre Dame seal (2).svg|thumb|132x132px|University of Notre Dame seal]]\n\n\n\nIn addition, disappearing of a local newspaper that plays a role as a watchdog journalism is related to putting a financial problem directly on members in a community.<ref name=\":3\" /> Based on the research conducted by the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] and the [[University of Notre Dame]], it is found that increasing in borrowing costs after a local newspaper is closed has a close connection with municipal government. <ref name=\":3\" /> It indicates that the absence of a watchdog journalism leaves public out of a discussion and helps people in power such as government officials to refuse to increase working people\u2019s wages and in payrolls.<ref name=\":3\" /> People in power is highly likely to engage in wasteful spending because there is no journalism that watches and criticizes their actions, decisions, and policies. To simply put, if there is no investigative journalism, important issues that public must know are not covered. So instead of reporting on fraud, abuse, and waste, useless and meaningless topics will be handled as if they are the only a problem that a community faces.<ref name=\":3\" /> For instance, a corruption which is related to various public infrastructures such as hospital that require more resource with a high quality to provide better service to public will be less likely to be told.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\n<br />\n== See also ==\n* [[Muckraking]]\n* [[Whistleblowing]]\n* [[Guardian Project (software)]]\n* [[Investigative journalism]]\n* [[Fake News]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* ''[http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/ Nieman Watchdog: Questions the Press Should Ask]'' \u2013 Official site ([[Nieman Foundation for Journalism]] at [[Harvard University]]).\n* ''[https://www.newsmediawatchdog.com/ News Media Watchdog]''\n\n{{Journalism footer}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Watchdog Journalism}}\n[[Category:Watchdog journalism| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Journalism that plays an oversight role towards government, industry and society}}\n{{Use American English|date = February 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date = February 2019}}\n{{Cleanup|date=April 2020|reason=Unencyclopedic tone and grammar mistakes}}\n\n'''Watchdog journalism''' informs the public about goings-on in institutions and society, especially in circumstances where a significant portion of the public would demand changes in response.

In turn, there are a few factors that are likely to have an influence over the type of watchdog performance in the journalism.\n\n*''[[Democracy]]'': Watchdog journalism can work effectively in well-established democratic countries. This is because in such countries, there is high level of the freedom of the press and journalistic autonomy and independence.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hallin, Daniel C.

To be specific, according to what Mellado et al. (2017) found in five Latin American countries, the media that serves the interests of the right or of the moderation is less likely to work as the watchdog journalism than the media serving interests of left party do.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mellado|first=Claudia|last2=Hellmueller|first2=Lea|last3=M\u00e1rquez-Ram\u00edrez|first3=Mireya|last4=Humanes|first4=Maria Luisa|last5=Sparks|first5=Colin|last6=Stepinska|first6=Agnieszka|last7=Pasti|first7=Svetlana|last8=Schielicke|first8=Anna-Maria|last9=Tandoc|first9=Edson|last10=Wang|first10=Haiyan|date=2017-11-02|title=The Hybridization of Journalistic Cultures: A Comparative Study of Journalistic Role Performance|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=67|issue=6|pages=944\u2013967|doi=10.1111/jcom.12339|issn=0021-9916}}</ref> In addition, biased tendency of the media has a great impact on the coverage of the political issues or scandals.\n*''News beats'': The performance of the watchdog journalism is influenced by journalistic specialization. For instance, based on what Reich (2012) found, journalists who deal with political issues are highly likely to act as watchdogs than ones who cover business issues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reich|first=Zvi|date=2011-09-20|title=Different Practices, Similar Logic|journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics|volume=17|issue=1|pages=76\u201399|doi=10.1177/1940161211420868|issn=1940-1612}}</ref> Similar tendency appears in other countries including China, Chile, and Spain.

The detached watchdog journalism is predominant especially in the western countries such as Germany, the United States, Austria, and Switzerland.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIn the detached approach, the most predominant form of watchdog journalism, criticism and question which are done by sources are the least intense levels of scrutiny.

It involved [[Richard Nixon]], the 37th president of the United States and led him to resignation. This scandal stemmed from the attempts of 5 former [[FBI]] and [[CIA]] agents broke in the Democratic National Committee headquarters which is located at the [[Watergate Office Building]], Washington D.C.

As a result, the impeachment against Richard Nixon was approved by the House judiciary committee.<ref name=\":2\" /> He resigned from all of offices on August 9, 1974.\n\n[[File:Carl bernstein 2007.jpg|thumb|233x233px|Carl Bernstein, the investigative journalist of The Washington Post]]\n\n=== The role of Washington Post as watchdog journalism in the case of Watergate scandal ===\nThe case of Watergate scandal is the most famous example showing the role of watchdog journalism, how it works and even further, its impact. The media, especially, The Washington Post, significantly contributed to highlight the fact that there\u2019s the rotten connection between the breaking in the Watergate Office and Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election committee.<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition, its coverage led to an explosion of publicity and public attention. To cover the scandal, anonymous sources became the main material that The Washington Post heavily relied on. Specifically, the Washington Post\u2019s investigative journalists named [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] played a really important role. <ref name=\":2\" /> They uncovered information and evidence that proved the agents' break-in to plant a bug and attempts to conceal it which result in the intervention of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], and the [[White House]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition, they conducted interviews with a witness named [[Judy Hoback Miller]]. He was the book keep who worked at the Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election committee and had an evidence showing how Richard Nixon and his committee mishandled the funds and destroyed the records, the evidence of conspiracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The most valuable and reliable anonymous sources came from person who didn\u2019t reveal his identity at the time. He was called Deep Throat by Woodward and Bernstein.<ref name=\":2\" /> Every meeting between investigative journalists of The Washington Post and Deep Throat was held secretly.<ref name=\":2\" /> And through these meetings, involvement of the Richard Nixon, his committee and the White House was revealed. Later, it was also revealed that Deep Throat, the anonymous informant, is the deputy director of the FBI during 1970s named William Mark Felt, Sr.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nEven though watchdog journalism plays an really important role for democracy in a society, it cannot avoid of being criticized and disappearing.<ref name=\":10\" /> Since several years ago, watchdog journalism tends to decrease. As a result, watchdog reporting is rarely to be handled by media no matter the types of the channel.<ref name=\":10\" /> This tendency is because what journalists pursue is different from the past. specifically, most journalists these day prefer simply reflecting the status quo to scrutinizing and challenging it.<ref name=\":10\" /> However, the problem is that there are still issues, corruptions, and scandals that have to be covered by journalist. For example, even the situation in the United States, the country where watchdog journalists forced the president out of the White House also shows this tendency.<ref name=\":10\" /> In 2003, the U.S media reported widely on Iraq War and in the process, it was revealed that most media don't function as the critical and skeptical watchdog journalism. <ref name=\":10\" /> In addition, there is also a voice saying that watchdog journalism does not work for a democracy and a healthy society anymore, rather it works to serve journalists' own interests.<ref name=\":10\" /><br />\n\n=== Crisis in watchdog journalism  ===\n[[File:University of Illinois at Chicago circle logo.svg|thumb|131x131px|University of Illinois at Chiage circle logo]]Journalism\u2019s role as a watchdog is in danger of disappearing in a lot of societies and countries across the world. Basically, watchdog journalism has to force people in power, for instance government officials, to take a responsibility of their actions that affect public's way of living.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, since local news media and newspaper have faced closing or consolidation, it is hard to see journalism that watches those in power.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/816b31f8571d4b759227e58c6252e99d|title=Loss of local news hinders ability to watchdog government|date=2019-03-11|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> To be specific, in the case of the United States, the phenomenon of disappearing a local newspaper has happened in more than 1,400 cities since 15 years ago according to an [[Associated Press]]'s research which was conducted through data gathered by the [[University of North Carolina]].<ref name=\":3\" /> And those cities are where watchdog journalism that reports issues and problems caused by actions of a corrupt people in power is necessarily needed. As a result, several negative outcomes for the community has been brought. Foremost, rotten actions of people in power such as politicians are unable to be criticized and watched. This is because there is no transparency that can solve problems and achieve a healthy democracy. <ref name=\":3\" />[[File:University of Notre Dame seal (2).svg|thumb|132x132px|University of Notre Dame seal]]\n\n\n\nIn addition, disappearing of a local newspaper that plays a role as a watchdog journalism is related to putting a financial problem directly on members in a community.<ref name=\":3\" /> Based on the research conducted by the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] and the [[University of Notre Dame]], it is found that increasing in borrowing costs after a local newspaper is closed has a close connection with municipal government. <ref name=\":3\" /> It indicates that the absence of a watchdog journalism leaves public out of a discussion and helps people in power such as government officials to refuse to increase working people\u2019s wages and in payrolls.<ref name=\":3\" /> People in power is highly likely to engage in wasteful spending because there is no journalism that watches and criticizes their actions, decisions, and policies. To simply put, if there is no investigative journalism, important issues that public must know are not covered. So instead of reporting on fraud, abuse, and waste, useless and meaningless topics will be handled as if they are the only a problem that a community faces.<ref name=\":3\" /> For instance, a corruption which is related to various public infrastructures such as hospital that require more resource with a high quality to provide better service to public will be less likely to be told.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\n<br />\n== See also ==\n* [[Muckraking]]\n* [[Whistleblowing]]\n* [[Guardian Project (software)]]\n* [[Investigative journalism]]\n* [[Fake News]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* ''[http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/ Nieman Watchdog: Questions the Press Should Ask]'' \u2013 Official site ([[Nieman Foundation for Journalism]] at [[Harvard University]]).\n* ''[https://www.newsmediawatchdog.com/ News Media Watchdog]''\n\n{{Journalism footer}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Watchdog Journalism}}\n[[Category:Watchdog journalism| ]]\n", "name_user": "108.202.116.6", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added that fave book was using its adds to try and brain wash me and the cheif of police tod Patterson gave my name to these government agencies to be gangstalked)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_journalism"}

''Inuyashiki'' debuted in the January 2014 issue of [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Seinen manga|seinen]]'' manga magazine, ''[[Evening (magazine)|Evening]]'' and ended in July 2017. Ten compilation volumes have been published.\n\nAn [[anime]] television series adaptation produced by [[MAPPA (studio)|MAPPA]] aired on [[Fuji TV]]'s late night programming block [[Noitamina]] from October to December 2017. A [[Inuyashiki (film)|live-action film adaptation]] premiered in Japan in April 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nInuyashiki Ichiro is an older, friendless man with an uncaring family. One fateful evening in a nearly empty public park, he is struck by an explosion of extraterrestrial origin, and his body is replaced by an incredibly powerful, but still outwardly human, mechanical body. He quickly realizes the extent of his body's powers, and after saving a homeless man being beaten by a pack of teenagers, he decides to dedicate himself to doing good, using his powers to heal those with incurable diseases and fight crime.\n\nHowever, a teenager who was with him at the time of the explosion, Shishigami Hiro, had the same fate as Ichiro, but unlike Inuyashiki, Shishigami becomes a psychopath who goes about using his newfound abilities to murder various people, from classmates that annoy him to innocent families, including young children, just for amusement. His acts of merciless cruelty bring him the attention of the police, who can do nothing to stop him. Hiro becomes the most wanted criminal in the country.\n\nThe series follows these two different individuals who once shared the same bizarre experience, as their paths are destined to clash.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Ichir\u014d Inuyashiki|\u72ac\u5c4b\u6577 \u58f1\u90ce|Inuyashiki Ichir\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Fumiyo Kohinata]]<ref name=\"Main-Cast\">{{cite web|title=Inuyashiki Anime's Promo Video Reveals Cast, Man With a Mission Theme Song|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-08-24/inuyashiki-anime-promo-video-reveals-cast-man-with-a-mission-theme-song/.120512|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=August 24, 2017|date=August 24, 2017}}</ref>}}\n:Played by: [[Noritake Kinashi]]\n:The head of the Inuyashiki family who looks older than his age, being 58 years old.

He also became a cyborg, but instead he takes pleasure in killing people which, according to him, keeps him human. The only people he cares about are his mother, And\u014d, and later Shion and her grandmother. His standard method of killing someone is making a [[finger gun]] and saying 'Bang!', which has the same effect as shooting someone with an actual gun. This will work on anyone who witnesses it, even if played on a television screen. He can also imitate a machine gun by shouting \"da-da-da\" while pretending to hold one, which will have the same effect. This is an ability he shares with Ichir\u014d.\n;{{Nihongo|Naoyuki And\u014d|\u5b89\u5802 \u76f4\u884c|And\u014d Naoyuki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kanata Hong\u014d]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-09-01/inuyashiki-anime-adds-kanata-hongou-to-cast/.120811|title=Inuyashiki Anime Adds Kanata Hongou to Cast|website=Anime News Network|date=September 1, 2017|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}</ref>}}\n:Played by: [[Kanata Hong\u014d]]\n:Hiro's childhood friend who initially shut himself in at home after being bullied at school.

When he takes his wife and children to their new modest home, the children are unimpressed. After a visit to the doctor where he is diagnosed with stomach cancer and given 3 months to live, he is unable to tell his self-absorbed family. One evening, while walking his dog in a park on a hill, he breaks down and cries. Suddenly he and a youth standing nearby are struck by a mysterious explosion apparently of extraterrestrial origin. His body is replaced by an incredibly powerful, but still outwardly human, mechanical body. He realizes some of his body's powers after saving a homeless man being beaten by a pack of teenagers. The electronics within his body also manage to identify and expose the teenagers. He then realizes that even though his body is now an [[electromechanical]] [[cyborg]], he still thinks and feels like a human.\n| LineColor           = 4B0082\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = Hiro Shishigami\n| TranslitTitle       = Shishigami Hiro\n| NativeTitle         = \u7345\u5b50\u795e\u7693\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| DirectedBy          = Hirokazu Yamada\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2017|10|19}}\n| ShortSummary        = Student Hiro Shishigami remarks that one of his friends, Naoyuki Andou,&nbsp;has been absent from school and goes to visit him.

Naoyuki is impressed until Hiro causes cars to start crashing in the street and realizes they are not just tricks. Hiro reveals his cyborg body and convinces Naoyuki to return to school, calmly offering to kill the student who beat him up. Naoyuki however is fearful about Hiro's mental state and powers. After leaving, Hiro picks a house at random and casually kills the occupants by shooting an invisible beam while making a [[finger gun]] gesture. He remarks that he feels 'alive'. When the daughter comes home, he threatens to kill her, and Inuyashiki hears her screams of fear. He drives, following the voice he hears in his head, until, while stopped in traffic, hears her die. He finally arrives at the house, finding the bodies, but is confronted by Hiro who shoots him in the head.

Meanwhile, Inuyashiki sees some thugs take a young man into an alley. He follows them and beats them up using only his physical strength. He then hears the voices of people trapped in a building on fire, and tries to invoke the flying mechanism he saw Hiro use. Desperately trying he sings the [[Astro Boy]] theme song and takes off but has difficulty controlling the jets. He eventually reaches the scene, rescuing those trapped inside. He remarks that he feels 'so happy'. Hiro finally convinces Naoyuki to return to school, but when the bullies threaten him, Hiro intervenes and forces them to back off. Later that afternoon he kills four of the boys at a distance as Naoyuki watches. Hiro describes his many powers, including control over electronic devices, including [[Gaming the system|milking]] an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]. Naoyuki then says he can no longer be friends with someone who kills and steals, and Hiro walks off. That evening Inuyashiki discovers his healing power when he revives a cat that had been run over and thanks God.

Ten compilation volumes have been published.\n\nAn [[anime]] television series adaptation produced by [[MAPPA (studio)|MAPPA]] aired on [[Fuji TV]]'s late night programming block [[Noitamina]] from October to December 2017. A [[Inuyashiki (film)|live-action film adaptation]] premiered in Japan in April 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nInuyashiki Ichiro is an older, friendless man with an uncaring family. One fateful evening in a nearly empty public park, he is struck by an explosion of extraterrestrial origin, and his body is replaced by an incredibly powerful, but still outwardly human, mechanical body. He quickly realizes the extent of his body's powers, and after saving a homeless man being beaten by a pack of teenagers, he decides to dedicate himself to doing good, using his powers to heal those with incurable diseases and fight crime.\n\nHowever, a teenager who was with him at the time of the explosion, Shishigami Hiro, had the same fate as Ichiro, but unlike Inuyashiki, Shishigami becomes a psychopath who goes about using his newfound abilities to murder various people, from classmates that annoy him to innocent families, including young children, just for amusement. His acts of merciless cruelty bring him the attention of the police, who can do nothing to stop him. Hiro becomes the most wanted criminal in the country.\n\nThe series follows these two different individuals who once shared the same bizarre experience, as their paths are destined to clash.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Ichir\u014d Inuyashiki|\u72ac\u5c4b\u6577 \u58f1\u90ce|Inuyashiki Ichir\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Fumiyo Kohinata]]<ref name=\"Main-Cast\">{{cite web|title=Inuyashiki Anime's Promo Video Reveals Cast, Man With a Mission Theme Song|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-08-24/inuyashiki-anime-promo-video-reveals-cast-man-with-a-mission-theme-song/.120512|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=August 24, 2017|date=August 24, 2017}}</ref>}}\n:Played by: [[Noritake Kinashi]]\n:The head of the Inuyashiki family who looks older than his age, being 58 years old.

His standard method of killing someone is making a [[finger gun]] and saying 'Bang!', which has the same effect as shooting someone with an actual gun. This will work on anyone who witnesses it, even if played on a television screen. He can also imitate a machine gun by shouting \"da-da-da\" while pretending to hold one, which will have the same effect.

After reading about miraculous cures, Andou suspects Shishigami, but dismisses it, thinking there may be others like him with similar powers. In desperation he screams out that he is going to be killed, and Inuyashiki arrives at his door. When Inuyashiki admits who he is, Andou vows to help him stop Shishigami even if it means killing him.
