He staged massive [[Rosary]] rallies in key cities of the world and extensively utilized mass communication, helped by world-recognized celebrities of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] at that time, promoting his ministry of binding families through prayer under the Family Rosary. Peyton was a popular and charismatic figure in [[Latin America]] and the [[Philippines]], where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and was known for his strong [[Irish people|Irish]] accent.\n\nPeyton popularized the phrases \"[[The family that prays together stays together]]\" and \"A world at prayer is a world at peace\".\n\n[[Pope Francis]] furthered Peyton towards sainthood by confirming his [[heroic virtue]] and naming him as [[Venerable]] on December 18, 2017.\n\n==Early life==\nPeyton was born Patrick Joseph Peyton in [[Attymass]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]],<ref name=chc>[http://holycrosscongregation.org/holy-ones/servant-of-god-patrick-peyton/ \"Venerable Patrick Peyton\", Congregation of Holy Cross]</ref> to subsistence-farmers John and Mary Gillard Peyton. Peyton was the sixth in a deeply religious family of four girls and five boys living in a small cottage at a 14-acre (5.66&nbsp;hectares) stony farmland near the foot of the Ox Mountains. Later on, some members of the family migrated to the United States.\n\nPeyton was sent to his mother's relatives in [[Bonniconlon]] to study at a school run by Tadhg O\u2019Leary in Bofield. As a young man, Peyton was rebellious and had moments of defying authority, resulting in dropping out of school. Despite the youthful rebellion, he remained close to his family, and deeply religious.\n\nBy his teen years, he was contemplating a vocation to become a priest. Although religious recruiters such as the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] and the [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer|Redemptorist]] fathers visited Carracastle in search of young men wanting to pursue the priesthood, Peyton concentrated on helping his family earn a living when their father became too ill to work the farm. Some of his elder sisters were already in America and were sending remittances to help the family left in Ireland. In 1927, his sisters sent word that Patrick and his older brother Thomas could sail to the United States and join them in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. On May 13, 1928, the Peyton brothers set sail.\n\n==America==\nThe brothers arrived in [[New York City|New York]] after a 10-day trip, traveling by steerage. The two took the train from New York to [[Pennsylvania]] and lived at the home of their already married sister Beatrice, who was working as a housekeeper for [[Thomas J. Baldrige]], the state Attorney General. Peyton's sister Nellie had already spoken to [[Monsignor]] Paul Kelly of [[St. Peter's Cathedral (Scranton, Pennsylvania)|Saint Peter's Cathedral]] and mentioned Peyton's interest in pursuing a [[Seminary|priestly vocation]]. Monsignor Kelly told Nellie to bring her younger brother Patrick to the cathedral as soon as he arrived. By June 1928, with hard luck in finding a job, Peyton finally met Monsignor Kelly and was offered a job of becoming the cathedral's [[Sexton (office)|sexton]]. In the words of Peyton at that time, \"a sexton was just another name for a janitor''.\"''\n\nPeyton took the job with initial hesitation but his daily presence at the cathedral brought back the calling for a vocation and he finally decided to pursue the priesthood. Monsignor Kelly insisted that Peyton should complete his high school education prior to admission to the [[novitiate]].  He and his older brother Thomas both pursued their religious vocations while working at the cathedral. During the spring of 1929, Father Pat Dolan of the [[Congregation of Holy Cross]] came to the cathedral in Scranton in search of new seminarians. Peyton and his brother Thomas entered the minor seminary of the Congregation of Holy Cross in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]].<ref name=chc/>\n\nAfter completing their high school studies at the Holy Cross School in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]], Peyton was admitted to the Moreau Seminary within the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1932, where he pursued a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, and excelled in [[Philosophy]]. He credited Cornelius Hagerty, a professor of ethics, as the one who provided him with counseling. As a young seminarian, Peyton was attracted to become a Holy Cross Father, for the order's focus on the Holy Family and towards obedience and conscience.\n\n==Marian devotion==\n[[File:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo - Virgin and Child with a Rosary - WGA16360.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Peyton hosted a number of televised shows abroad promoting the [[Rosary]], where an image of [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]]'s painting of the [[Our Lady of the Rosary]] was always present in the background. Oil on canvas. [[Museo del Prado]].]]\n\nIn October 1938, during Peyton's second year of theology at [[Catholic University of America]], he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He was transferred back to Notre Dame to the Infirmary. Father Cornelius Hagerty was influential in this stage of Peyton's life, encouraging the young seminarian to seek the help of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The doctors discovered that the patches in his lungs disappeared.<ref name=chc/>\n\nHe immediately packed his bags and left for Washington, D.C., to complete his theology studies and take his final vows. On June 15, 1941, Peyton and his brother Thomas were ordained at the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Notre Dame|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] at the University of Notre Dame as members of the Congregation of Holy Cross.<ref>[http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/the-enduring-legacy-of-now-venerable-father-patrick-peyton Pronechen, Joseph. \"The Enduring Legacy of Now-\u2018Venerable\u2019 Father Patrick Peyton\", ''National Catholic Register'', January 4, 2018]</ref>\n\n==Lifetime crusade==\n{{Main|Family Rosary Crusade|Family Theater}}\nPeyton was given very light duties following the completion of his theological studies. His first assignment was in [[Albany, New York]], as the chaplain of the [[Holy Cross Brothers]] of the Vincentian Institute. Peyton started sending letters to bishops, Catholic laity, and other groups promoting the importance of families praying the Rosary as the war raged on.\n\nUtilizing radio, [[films]], [[outdoor advertising]] and later television, with the help of celebrities, artists and advertising practitioners, Peyton was one of the first pioneers of evangelism using [[mass media]]. He would also pioneer in conducting public rallies to bring families to pledge to pray the Rosary as a unit. These Rosary rallies attended by millions would become the most significant event where Peyton could be best remembered.  According to historian Hugh Wilford, \"Peyton himself was deeply conscious of the political dimension of his mission, proudly proclaiming in a 1946 radio broadcast, 'The rosary is the offensive weapon that will destroy Communism\u2014the great evil that seeks to destroy the faith'\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=GRIBBLE |first1=RICHARD  |date=2003 |title=Anti-Communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A. |journal=Journal of Church and State |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=535\u2013558 |doi= 10.1093/jcs/45.3.535|jstor=23920511 }}</ref>\n\nThese Rosary Crusades were duplicated in different dioceses with attendees growing in numbers, taking Peyton across the globe from [[Brussels, Belgium]], to [[Madrid, Spain]], across Asia to [[Manila, Philippines]], down south of the [[equator]] to New Zealand and [[Papua New Guinea]] and into several South American cities like [[Lima, Peru]], to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in [[Brazil]]. With the help of a non-Catholic advertising practitioner, Peyton would popularize the slogan, \"The family that prays together stays together.\"\n\n==Death and legacy==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:father patrick peyton rosary rally philippines.gif|left|thumb|350px|Peyton shaking hands with [[Filipinos]] who gathered for the Rosary Rally in [[Archdiocese of Manila|Manila]]. 1953]] -->\n\nWith the [[Cold War]] threatening a new world peace, Peyton's work in promoting prayer was recognized by the Holy See. His efforts earned him the title \"The Rosary Priest\".\n\nControversy hounded Peyton throughout his ministry as some accused him of being a front for American intelligence during his missions in Latin America. Peyton's Rosary Crusades in Latin America were funded and, to some extent, directed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], which was interested in combating leftist political movements in Latin America.  This came about through Peyton's connection to [[J. Peter Grace]], the great-grandson of the founder of [[W.R. Grace and Company]], a multinational corporation with interests in transport, [[sugar]], and mining in South America, whom Peyton had met in 1946 on a trans-Atlantic voyage.  Grace, who was involved with other [[CIA]] front operations as well, wrote to John Moore, the chair of the Business Advisory Council, and the two men approached [[Allen Dulles]].  Dulles later met with Grace in the White House office of Vice President [[Richard Nixon]], who expressed enthusiasm.  The CIA decided for several years where the crusades would take place, and CIA funds were expended in [[Chile]], [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Colombia]], until Peyton's provincial superior, Richard H. Sullivan, learned of the secret funding from [[Theodore Hesburgh]], the chair of the board of trustees of the [[University of Notre Dame]], in October 1964.  It took the [[Holy See|Vatican]] more than a year and a half to oblige Peyton to give up his CIA financing.<ref>Hugh Wilford, ''The Mighty Wurlitzer: How the CIA Played America'' [Cambridge and London: Harvard University Press, 2008], pp.&nbsp;182\u201396 .</ref> While the CIA determined the locations of the Crusades, it did not influence the content or Peyton's goal of promoting family prayer \u2013 the Rosary and devotion to the Blessed Mother.\n\nOthers accused Peyton of living an ostentatious lifestyle, living a life with Hollywood artists who volunteered their efforts in helping promote his mission. But Peyton maintained that he never solicited funds for his ministry, and the well-off were more than generous to voluntarily donate a portion of their wealth all in the name of the Blessed Mother.\n\nPeyton died peacefully on June 3, 1992, holding a rosary, in a small room at the Little Sisters of the Poor Jeanne Jugan Residence in [[San Pedro, California]]. His remains were brought to the Holy Cross Cemetery on the grounds of [[Stonehill College]] in [[Easton, Massachusetts]].\n\nBefore Peyton died, he continued to work on what was to be the last major Rosary Rally. On December 8, 1992, at the [[Rizal Park]] in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], Manila Archbishop [[Jaime Cardinal Sin]] led the celebrations for the Golden Jubilee Celebration of the [[Family Rosary Crusade]]; the Archbishop of Los Angeles, [[Roger Cardinal Mahony]] was sent as [[Papal Legate]] on behalf of [[Pope John Paul II]]. Among [[Filipino people|Filipino]] Catholics, Peyton is remembered for his Sunday televised shows, where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and [[Marian devotion]] along with his famous slogan. Peyton also encouraged many businesses to start making and selling large amounts of Rosaries for distribution, which he gave freely to impoverished Filipinos living in the slums.\n\nPeyton's work continues today in his original ministries \u2013 Family Rosary, Family Theater and Family Rosary International \u2013 and in the Father Patrick Peyton Family Institute.\n\n==Sainthood==\nCardinal [[Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley|Sean Patrick O\u2019Malley]] announced a formal declaration opening the cause for [[sainthood]] of Father Peyton on June 1, 2001, a few days after receiving approval from the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Causes of the Saints]]. The declaration paved the way for the process of determining Peyton's holiness, and in the process earning the revered title of \"[[Servant of God]]\".\n\nThe [[Positio]] was sent to the C.C.S. in 2015 for assessment and theologians approved his cause on June 1, 2017. [[Pope Francis]] named him as [[Venerable]] on December 18, 2017.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Citation\n|last=Peyton, CSC\n|first=Patrick\n|title=All For Her: An Autobiography of Father Patrick Peyton, CSC\n|publisher=Family Theater Publications, Hollywood California\n|origyear=1967|year=1996\n|asin= B0006CCAGY\n|url=http://www.christian-pages.com/si/2353.html}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Shiel\n|first=Tom\n|title=Cardinal urges Christians to twitter\n|publisher=Irish Times\n|date=April 27, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0427/1224245444798.html\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n |last        = Matilla\n |first       = Dexter R.\n |title       = 'Rosary priest' to be honored with sculpture\n |publisher   = Philippines Daily Inquirer\n |date        = March 31, 2009\n |url         = http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090430075846/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |archivedate = April 30, 2009\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Bourke\n|first=Toni\n|title=Fr Peyton remembered at 100th anniversary celebrations\n|publisher=Mayo Advertiser\n|date=April 17, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/mayo/article/11149\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Schworm\n|first=Peter\n|title=Dozens in Easton pray for canonization of the 'Rosary Priest'\n|work=Boston Globe\n|date=June 8, 2008\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/06/08/dozens_in_easton_pray_for_canonization_of_the_rosary_priest/\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Gribble\n|first=Richard\n|title=Anti-communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A.(Congregation of Holy Cross)\n|publisher=Journal of Church and State/J.M.

Oil on canvas. [[Museo del Prado]].]]\n\nIn October 1938, during Peyton's second year of theology at [[Catholic University of America]], he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He was transferred back to Notre Dame to the Infirmary. Father Cornelius Hagerty was influential in this stage of Peyton's life, encouraging the young seminarian to seek the help of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The doctors discovered that the patches in his lungs disappeared.<ref name=chc/>\n\nHe immediately packed his bags and left for Washington, D.C., to complete his theology studies and take his final vows. On June 15, 1941, Peyton and his brother Thomas were ordained at the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Notre Dame|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] at the University of Notre Dame as members of the Congregation of Holy Cross.<ref>[http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/the-enduring-legacy-of-now-venerable-father-patrick-peyton Pronechen, Joseph. \"The Enduring Legacy of Now-\u2018Venerable\u2019 Father Patrick Peyton\", ''National Catholic Register'', January 4, 2018]</ref>\n\n==Lifetime crusade==\n{{Main|Family Rosary Crusade|Family Theater}}\nPeyton was given very light duties following the completion of his theological studies. His first assignment was in [[Albany, New York]], as the chaplain of the [[Holy Cross Brothers]] of the Vincentian Institute. Peyton started sending letters to bishops, Catholic laity, and other groups promoting the importance of families praying the Rosary as the war raged on.\n\nUtilizing radio, [[films]], [[outdoor advertising]] and later television, with the help of celebrities, artists and advertising practitioners, Peyton was one of the first pioneers of evangelism using [[mass media]]. He would also pioneer in conducting public rallies to bring families to pledge to pray the Rosary as a unit. These Rosary rallies attended by millions would become the most significant event where Peyton could be best remembered.  According to historian Hugh Wilford, \"Peyton himself was deeply conscious of the political dimension of his mission, proudly proclaiming in a 1946 radio broadcast, 'The rosary is the offensive weapon that will destroy Communism\u2014the great evil that seeks to destroy the faith'\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=GRIBBLE |first1=RICHARD  |date=2003 |title=Anti-Communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A. |journal=Journal of Church and State |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=535\u2013558 |doi= 10.1093/jcs/45.3.535|jstor=23920511 }}</ref>\n\nThese Rosary Crusades were duplicated in different dioceses with attendees growing in numbers, taking Peyton across the globe from [[Brussels, Belgium]], to [[Madrid, Spain]], across Asia to [[Manila, Philippines]], down south of the [[equator]] to New Zealand and [[Papua New Guinea]] and into several South American cities like [[Lima, Peru]], to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in [[Brazil]]. With the help of a non-Catholic advertising practitioner, Peyton would popularize the slogan, \"The family that prays together stays together.\"\n\n==Death and legacy==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:father patrick peyton rosary rally philippines.gif|left|thumb|350px|Peyton shaking hands with [[Filipinos]] who gathered for the Rosary Rally in [[Archdiocese of Manila|Manila]]. 1953]] -->\n\nWith the [[Cold War]] threatening a new world peace, Peyton's work in promoting prayer was recognized by the Holy See. His efforts earned him the title \"The Rosary Priest\".\n\nControversy hounded Peyton throughout his ministry as some accused him of being a front for American intelligence during his missions in Latin America. Peyton's Rosary Crusades in Latin America were funded and, to some extent, directed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], which was interested in combating leftist political movements in Latin America.  This came about through Peyton's connection to [[J. Peter Grace]], the great-grandson of the founder of [[W.R. Grace and Company]], a multinational corporation with interests in transport, [[sugar]], and mining in South America, whom Peyton had met in 1946 on a trans-Atlantic voyage.  Grace, who was involved with other [[CIA]] front operations as well, wrote to John Moore, the chair of the Business Advisory Council, and the two men approached [[Allen Dulles]].  Dulles later met with Grace in the White House office of Vice President [[Richard Nixon]], who expressed enthusiasm.  The CIA decided for several years where the crusades would take place, and CIA funds were expended in [[Chile]], [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Colombia]], until Peyton's provincial superior, Richard H. Sullivan, learned of the secret funding from [[Theodore Hesburgh]], the chair of the board of trustees of the [[University of Notre Dame]], in October 1964.  It took the [[Holy See|Vatican]] more than a year and a half to oblige Peyton to give up his CIA financing.<ref>Hugh Wilford, ''The Mighty Wurlitzer: How the CIA Played America'' [Cambridge and London: Harvard University Press, 2008], pp.&nbsp;182\u201396 .</ref> While the CIA determined the locations of the Crusades, it did not influence the content or Peyton's goal of promoting family prayer \u2013 the Rosary and devotion to the Blessed Mother.\n\nOthers accused Peyton of living an ostentatious lifestyle, living a life with Hollywood artists who volunteered their efforts in helping promote his mission. But Peyton maintained that he never solicited funds for his ministry, and the well-off were more than generous to voluntarily donate a portion of their wealth all in the name of the Blessed Mother.\n\nPeyton died peacefully on June 3, 1992, holding a rosary, in a small room at the Little Sisters of the Poor Jeanne Jugan Residence in [[San Pedro, California]]. His remains were brought to the Holy Cross Cemetery on the grounds of [[Stonehill College]] in [[Easton, Massachusetts]].\n\nBefore Peyton died, he continued to work on what was to be the last major Rosary Rally. On December 8, 1992, at the [[Rizal Park]] in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], Manila Archbishop [[Jaime Cardinal Sin]] led the celebrations for the Golden Jubilee Celebration of the [[Family Rosary Crusade]]; the Archbishop of Los Angeles, [[Roger Cardinal Mahony]] was sent as [[Papal Legate]] on behalf of [[Pope John Paul II]]. Among [[Filipino people|Filipino]] Catholics, Peyton is remembered for his Sunday televised shows, where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and [[Marian devotion]] along with his famous slogan. Peyton also encouraged many businesses to start making and selling large amounts of Rosaries for distribution, which he gave freely to impoverished Filipinos living in the slums.\n\nPeyton's work continues today in his original ministries \u2013 Family Rosary, Family Theater and Family Rosary International \u2013 and in the Father Patrick Peyton Family Institute.\n\n==Sainthood==\nCardinal [[Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley|Sean Patrick O\u2019Malley]] announced a formal declaration opening the cause for [[sainthood]] of Father Peyton on June 1, 2001, a few days after receiving approval from the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Causes of the Saints]]. The declaration paved the way for the process of determining Peyton's holiness and in the process earning the revered title of \"[[Servant of God]]\".\n\nThe [[Positio]] was sent to the C.C.S. in 2015 for assessment and theologians approved his cause on 1 June 2017. [[Pope Francis]] named him as [[Venerable]] on 18 December 2017.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Citation\n|last=Peyton, CSC\n|first=Patrick\n|title=All For Her: An Autobiography of Father Patrick Peyton, CSC\n|publisher=Family Theater Publications, Hollywood California\n|origyear=1967|year=1996\n|asin= B0006CCAGY\n|url=http://www.christian-pages.com/si/2353.html}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Shiel\n|first=Tom\n|title=Cardinal urges Christians to twitter\n|publisher=Irish Times\n|date=April 27, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0427/1224245444798.html\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n |last        = Matilla\n |first       = Dexter R.\n |title       = 'Rosary priest' to be honored with sculpture\n |publisher   = Philippines Daily Inquirer\n |date        = March 31, 2009\n |url         = http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090430075846/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |archivedate = April 30, 2009\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Bourke\n|first=Toni\n|title=Fr Peyton remembered at 100th anniversary celebrations\n|publisher=Mayo Advertiser\n|date=April 17, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/mayo/article/11149\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Schworm\n|first=Peter\n|title=Dozens in Easton pray for canonization of the 'Rosary Priest'\n|work=Boston Globe\n|date=June 8, 2008\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/06/08/dozens_in_easton_pray_for_canonization_of_the_rosary_priest/\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Gribble\n|first=Richard\n|title=Anti-communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A.(Congregation of Holy Cross)\n|publisher=Journal of Church and State/J.M.

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech are also signaled by special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in addition to quotative markers. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the conjugated verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || \u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the syntax of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n'''English:'''\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n  She '''said''' \u201cWill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d<ref name=\"frederica\"> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n\nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in colloquial speech.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in English spoken in places like Glasgow, Scotland as well.<ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117-128}}</ref><ref name=\"frederica\"/> Though not semantically considered a verb of saying, they are used as verbs of saying.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use prosodic shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and tense to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n==== Spanish ====\n===== Quotative Verb =====\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe ''told'' us ''that'' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are grammatical markers equivalent to full lexical verbs with meanings of ''\"say, mention, tell, etc.\"'' In many languages, they are [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to different extremes from their previously lexical form. Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Languages indicate this in various ways such as through additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or required endings of verbs. For example, English can express evidentials with an optional adverb, \"''Allegedly'', Annie pulled the trigger.\" The interlocutor then knows where the source of the quotation is from. <ref name=\"SRL Ev>{{cite journal |last1=San Roque |first1=Lila |title=Evidentiality |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |date=2019 |volume=48 |issue= |pages=353\u2013370 |doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-102218-011243 }}</ref> Similar to quotative particles, quotative evidentials are usually [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] from full lexical verbs. <ref name=\"Chojnicka Latvian\">{{cite journal |last1=Chojnicka |first1=Joanna |title=Latvian verbs of speaking and their relations to evidentiality |journal=Kalbotyra |issue=69 |page=59-81}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Wikisource portal|Quotations}}\n{{div col}}\n*[[Adage]]\n*[[Aphorism]]\n*[[Block quotation]]\n*[[Epigram]]\n*[[Fallacy of quoting out of context]]\n*[[Saying|Maxim (saying)]]\n*[[Musical quotation]]\n*[[Nested quotation]]\n*[[Proverb]]\n*[[Scare quotes]]\n*[[Sic]]\n*[[Use\u2013mention distinction]]\n*[[Quotation mark]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the conjugated verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || \u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the syntax of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n'''English:'''\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n  She '''said''' \u201cWill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d<ref name=\"frederica\"> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n\nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in colloquial speech.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in English spoken in places like Glasgow, Scotland as well.<ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117-128}}</ref><ref name=\"frederica\"/> Though not semantically considered a verb of saying, they are used as verbs of saying.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use prosodic shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and tense to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n==== Spanish ====\n===== Quotative Verb =====\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe ''told'' us ''that'' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are grammatical markers equivalent to full lexical verbs with meanings of ''\"say, mention, tell, etc.\"'' In many languages, they are [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to different extremes from their previously lexical form. Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Languages indicate this in various ways such as through additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or required endings of verbs. For example, English can express evidentials with an optional adverb, \"''Allegedly'', Annie pulled the trigger.\" The interlocutor then knows where the source of the quotation is from. <ref name=\"SRL Ev>{{cite journal |last1=San Roque |first1=Lila |title=Evidentiality |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |date=2019 |volume=48 |issue= |pages=353\u2013370 |doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-102218-011243 }}</ref> Similar to quotative particles, quotative evidentials are usually [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] from full lexical verbs. <ref name=\"Chojnicka Latvian\">{{cite journal |last1=Chojnicka |first1=Joanna |title=Latvian verbs of speaking and their relations to evidentiality |journal=Kalbotyra |issue=69 |page=59-81}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Wikisource portal|Quotations}}\n{{div col}}\n*[[Adage]]\n*[[Aphorism]]\n*[[Block quotation]]\n*[[Epigram]]\n*[[Fallacy of quoting out of context]]\n*[[Saying|Maxim (saying)]]\n*[[Musical quotation]]\n*[[Nested quotation]]\n*[[Proverb]]\n*[[Scare quotes]]\n*[[Sic]]\n*[[Use\u2013mention distinction]]\n*[[Quotation mark]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988]] and in [[Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign|2008]]. \n\nBiden was raised in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], and [[New Castle County, Delaware]]. He studied at the [[University of Delaware]] before receiving his law degree from [[Syracuse University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joe-Biden|title=Joe Biden &#124; Biography & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> He became a lawyer in 1969 and was elected to the [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]] [[County Council]] in 1970. He was [[1972 United States Senate election in Delaware|elected]] to the [[List of United States senators from Delaware|U.S. Senate from Delaware]] in 1972 when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history. Biden was reelected six times and was the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|fourth-most senior senator]] when he resigned to assume the vice presidency in 2009.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was a longtime member and eventually chairman of the [[Foreign Relations Committee]]. He opposed the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 but advocated for U.S. and [[NATO]] intervention in the [[Bosnian War]] in 1994 and 1995, expanding NATO in the 1990s, and the 1999 bombing of [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. He argued and voted for the [[Iraq War Resolution|resolution authorizing the Iraq War]] in 2002 but opposed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. troops]] in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, as well as the contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominations of [[Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]. Biden led the efforts to pass the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]].\n\nIn [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], Biden was the [[running mate]] of Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]]. As vice president, he oversaw [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009#Infrastructure Investment|infrastructure spending]] to counteract the [[Great Recession]] and helped formulate U.S. policy toward [[Iraq]] through the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)#Full withdrawal (2011)|withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011]]. His negotiations with congressional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] helped the Obama administration pass legislation including the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]], which resolved a taxation deadlock; the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], which resolved that year's [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|debt ceiling crisis]]; and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]], which addressed the impending [[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]]. Obama and Biden were [[2012 United States presidential election|reelected in 2012]].\n\nIn October 2015, after months of speculation, Biden announced he would not seek the presidency in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]].

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Biden is the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|presumptive Democratic nominee]] for [[President of the United States|president]] in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]]. He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988]] and in [[Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign|2008]]. \n\nBiden was raised in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], and [[New Castle County, Delaware]]. He studied at the [[University of Delaware]] before receiving his law degree from [[Syracuse University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joe-Biden|title=Joe Biden &#124; Biography & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> He became a lawyer in 1969 and was elected to the [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]] [[County Council]] in 1970. He was [[1972 United States Senate election in Delaware|elected]] to the [[List of United States senators from Delaware|U.S. Senate from Delaware]] in 1972 when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history. Biden was reelected six times and was the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|fourth-most senior senator]] when he resigned to assume the vice presidency in 2009.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was a longtime member and eventually chairman of the [[Foreign Relations Committee]]. He opposed the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 but advocated for U.S. and [[NATO]] intervention in the [[Bosnian War]] in 1994 and 1995, expanding NATO in the 1990s, and the 1999 bombing of [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. He argued and voted for the [[Iraq War Resolution|resolution authorizing the Iraq War]] in 2002 but opposed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. troops]] in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, as well as the contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominations of [[Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]. Biden led the efforts to pass the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]].\n\nIn [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], Biden was the [[running mate]] of Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]]. As vice president, he oversaw [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009#Infrastructure Investment|infrastructure spending]] to counteract the [[Great Recession]] and helped formulate U.S. policy toward [[Iraq]] through the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)#Full withdrawal (2011)|withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011]]. His negotiations with congressional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] helped the Obama administration pass legislation including the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]], which resolved a taxation deadlock; the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], which resolved that year's [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|debt ceiling crisis]]; and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]], which addressed the impending [[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]]. Obama and Biden were [[2012 United States presidential election|reelected in 2012]].\n\nIn October 2015, after months of speculation, Biden announced he would not seek the presidency in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]]. In January 2017, Obama awarded Biden the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] with distinction.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/joe-biden-presidential-medal-freedom.html|title=Obama Surprises Joe Biden With Presidential Medal of Freedom|last=Shear|first=Michael D.|date=January 12, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 24, 2018|language=en}}</ref> After completing his second term as vice president, Biden joined the faculty of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he was named the [[Benjamin Franklin]] Professor of Presidential Practice.<ref name=\"BidenUPenn\">{{cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-has-a-new-job-2017-2 |title=Here's what Joe Biden will do after 8 years as vice president |last=Berke |first=Jeremy |date=February 7, 2017 |website=Business Insider |access-date=February 8, 2017 |quote=}}</ref> He announced his [[Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign|2020 candidacy for president]] on April 25, 2019, joining a large [[2020 Democratic Party presidential candidates|field of Democratic candidates]] pursuing the party nomination.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/us/politics/biden-2020.html|title=Joe Biden's 2020 Plan Is Almost Complete.

Booth struggles to find stunt work in Hollywood because of rumors he murdered his wife. Actress [[Sharon Tate]] (Robbie) and her husband, director [[Roman Polanski]] (Zawierucha), have moved [[10050 Cielo Drive|next door to Dalton]]. He dreams of befriending them to revive his declining acting career. That night, Tate and Polanski attend a celebrity-filled party at the [[Playboy Mansion]].\n\nThe next day, while repairing Dalton's TV antenna, Booth reminisces about a [[sparring]] contest he had with [[Bruce Lee]] on the set of ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'' which resulted in Booth being fired. Meanwhile, [[Charles Manson]] (Herriman) stops by the Polanski residence looking for [[Record producer|music producer]] [[Terry Melcher]], who used to live there, but is turned away by [[Jay Sebring]] (Hirsch). Tate goes out for errands and stops at a movie theater to watch herself in the film ''[[The Wrecking Crew (1968 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]''.\n\nDalton is cast to play the villain in the pilot of ''[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]'', and strikes up a conversation with his eight-year-old co-star, Trudi Fraser. Dalton struggles to remember his lines and later suffers a breakdown in his trailer. He subsequently delivers a performance that impresses Fraser and the director, [[Sam Wanamaker]], bolstering his confidence. \n\nWhile driving Dalton's car, Booth picks up a female hitchhiker named Pussycat, whom he takes to [[Spahn Ranch]], where Booth once worked on the set of ''Bounty Law.'' He takes notice of the many [[hippie]]s living there (the [[Manson Family]]). Suspecting they may be taking advantage of the ranch's owner, [[George Spahn]] (Dern), Booth insists on checking on him despite [[Lynette Fromme|\"Squeaky\" Fromme]]'s (Fanning) objections. Booth finally speaks with Spahn, who dismisses his concerns. Upon leaving, Booth discovers that [[Steve \"Clem\" Grogan]] has slashed a tire on Dalton's car; Booth beats him and forces him to change the tire. [[Tex Watson]] is summoned to deal with the situation but he arrives as Booth is driving away.\n\nAfter watching Dalton's guest performance on an episode of ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', Schwarz books him as the lead in [[Sergio Corbucci]]'s next Spaghetti Western, ''Nebraska Jim''. Dalton takes Booth with him for a six-month stint in Italy, during which he appears in two additional Westerns and a [[Eurospy film|Eurospy]] comedy, and marries Italian starlet Francesca Capucci. With a new wife, Dalton informs Booth he can no longer afford his services.\n\nOn the evening of August 8, 1969, their first day back in Los Angeles, Dalton and Booth go out for drinks to commemorate their time working together and then return to Dalton's house. Tate and Sebring go out for dinner with friends and then return to Tate's house. Booth smokes an [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]]-laced cigarette given to him by Pussycat and takes Brandy for a walk while Dalton prepares drinks. Manson Family members Tex, [[Susan Atkins|Sadie]], [[Linda Kasabian|Flower Child]], and [[Patricia Krenwinkel|Katie]] arrive outside in preparation to [[Tate\u2013LaBianca murders|murder everyone in Tate's house]]. Dalton hears the car and orders them to get off his street. [[Alternate history|Changing their plans]], the Manson Family members decide to instead kill Dalton after Sadie reasons that Hollywood has \"taught them to murder.\" Flower Child deserts the group, speeding off with their car. They break into Dalton's house and confront Capucci and Booth, who recognizes them from his visit to Spahn Ranch. Booth orders Brandy to attack, and together they kill Katie and Tex and injure Sadie, though Booth is stabbed and knocked unconscious in the altercation. Sadie stumbles outside, alarming Dalton, who is in his pool listening to music on headphones, oblivious to the mayhem. Dalton retrieves a flamethrower that he had previously used in a movie and incinerates Sadie. After Booth is taken to the hospital to treat his injuries, Sebring engages Dalton in conversation outside and Dalton receives an invitation to have a drink with Tate and her friends at her house, which he accepts.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Rick Dalton\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Cliff Booth\n* [[Margot Robbie]] as [[Sharon Tate]]\n* [[Emile Hirsch]] as [[Jay Sebring]]\n* [[Margaret Qualley]] as \"Pussycat\"\n* [[Timothy Olyphant]] as [[James Stacy]]\n* [[Julia Butters]] as Trudi Fraser\n* [[Austin Butler]] as \"[[Tex Watson|Tex]]\"\n* [[Dakota Fanning]] as \"[[Lynette Fromme|Squeaky]]\"\n* [[Bruce Dern]] as [[George Spahn]]\n* [[Mike Moh]] as [[Bruce Lee]]\n* [[Luke Perry]] as [[Wayne Maunder]]\n* [[Damian Lewis]] as [[Steve McQueen]]\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Marvin Schwarz\n* [[Nicholas Hammond]] as [[Sam Wanamaker]]\n* [[Samantha Robinson (American actress)|Samantha Robinson]] as [[Abigail Folger]]\n* [[Rafa\u0142 Zawierucha]] as [[Roman Polanski]]\n* [[Lorenza Izzo]] as Francesca Capucci\n* [[Costa Ronin]] as [[Wojciech Frykowski]]\n* [[Damon Herriman]] as [[Charles Manson|Charlie]]\n* [[Lena Dunham]] as \"[[Catherine Share|Gypsy]]\"\n* [[Madisen Beaty]] as \"[[Patricia Krenwinkel|Katie]]\"\n* [[Mikey Madison]] as \"[[Susan Atkins|Sadie]]\"\n* James Landry H\u00e9bert as \"[[Steve \"Clem\" Grogan|Clem]]\"\n* [[Maya Hawke]] as \"[[Linda Kasabian|Flower Child]]\"\n* [[Victoria Pedretti]] as \"[[Leslie Van Houten|Lulu]]\"\n* [[Sydney Sweeney]] as \"[[:de:Diane Lake|Snake]]\"\n* [[Harley Quinn Smith]] as \"Froggie\"\n* Dallas Jay Hunter as \"Delilah\"\n* [[Kansas Bowling]] as \"[[Sandra Good|Blue]]\"\n* Parker Love Bowling as \"Tadpole\"\n* Cassidy Vick Hice as \"Sundance\"\n* Ruby Rose Skotchdopole as \"Butterfly\"\n* [[Danielle Harris]] as \"Angel\"\n* Josephine Valentina Clark as \"Happy Cappy\"\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as \"Business\" Bob Gilbert on ''[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]''\n* [[Clifton Collins Jr.]] as Ernesto \"The Mexican\" Vaquero on ''Lancer''\n* [[Marco Rodr\u00edguez (actor)|Marco Rodr\u00edguez]] as the [[bartender]] on ''Lancer''\n* [[Ram\u00f3n Franco (actor)|Ram\u00f3n Franco]] as a Land Pirate on ''Lancer'' and Rub\u00e9n, the [[Bruin Theater]] manager\n* Raul Cardona as \"Bad Guy\" Delgado on ''Lancer''\n* Courtney Hoffman as Rebekka\n* [[Dreama Walker]] as [[Connie Stevens]]\n* Rachel Redleaf as [[Cass Elliot|Mama Cass]]\n* [[Rebecca Rittenhouse]] as [[Michelle Phillips]]\n* [[Rumer Willis]] as [[Joanna Pettet]]\n* [[Spencer Garrett]] as Allen Kincade\n* [[Clu Gulager]] as the Larry Edmunds Bookshop owner\n* [[Martin Kove]] as a ''Bounty Law'' Sheriff\n* [[Rebecca Gayheart]] as Billie Booth\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as Randy Miller and the narrator\n* [[Zo\u00eb Bell]] as Janet Miller\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Sheriff Hackett on ''Bounty Law''\n* [[Perla Haney-Jardine]] as a hippie drug dealer\n* [[James Remar]] as \"Ugly Owl\" Hoot on ''Bounty Law''\n* [[Monica Staggs]] as Connie\n* [[Omar Doom]] as Donnie\n* [[Kate Berlant]] as the Bruin Theater ticket booth attendant\n* [[Brenda Vaccaro]] as Mary Alice Schwarz\n* [[Daniella Pick]] as Daphna Ben-Cobo\n* Tom Hartig as [[Altamont Free Concert|Bill \"Sweet William\" Fritsch]]\n* [[David Steen (actor)|David Steen]] as Straight Satan David\n* [[Corey Burton]] as the ''Bounty Law'' promo announcer\n* [[Toni Basil]] as a dancer on the plane during the opening credits sequence<ref name=toni-basil>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/arts/dance/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-tarantino-toni-basil.html |title=Quentin Tarantino's Goddess of Go-Go |first=Debra |last=Levine |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 6, 2019 |accessdate=August 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806163003/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/arts/dance/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-tarantino-toni-basil.html |archive-date=August 6, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n* Rage Stewart as [[KHJ (AM)|Harvey \"Humble Harve\" Miller]]\n* [[Quentin Tarantino]] as the offscreen director of the Red Apple cigarettes TV commercial.

While he knew he wanted the work to be titled ''Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'', evoking the idea of a fairy tale set in 1960s Hollywood, he publicly referred to the project as ''Magnum Opus''.<ref name=\"esquire may2019\">{{cite magazine | url = https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a27458589/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-leonardo-dicaprio-brad-pitt-quentin-tarantino-interview/ | title = Quentin Tarantino, Brad Pitt, and Leonardo DiCaprio Take You Inside 'Once Upon a Time...In Hollywood' | first = Michael | last = Hainey | date = May 21, 2019 | accessdate = January 19, 2020 | magazine = [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] }}</ref> The life of the work for the first five years was as a novel,<ref name=\"esquire may2019\"/> which Tarantino considered to be an exploratory approach to the story he wanted to tell, not yet having decided if it would be a screenplay. Tarantino tried other writing approaches: the early scene between DiCaprio's Dalton and Pacino's Marvin Schwarz was originally written as a one-act play as part of this exploratory work.<ref name=\"gamespot inspiration\"/>\n\nTarantino discovered the centerpiece for the work in 2009 while filming a movie with an actor that had the same stunt double for 20 years. Even though there was nothing but a small bit for the stuntman to do, Tarantino was asked to use him, and he agreed. The relationship fascinated Tarantino and inspired him to make a film about Hollywood.<ref name=recut/> Tarantino said that while the stuntman may have been a perfect double for the actor years earlier, at the time he had come to meet them, \"this was maybe the last or second-to-last thing they'd be doing together\".<ref name=\"gamespot inspiration\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/quentin-tarantino-reveals-inspiration-behind-once-/1100-6472880/ | title =Quentin Tarantino Reveals Inspiration Behind Once Upon A Time In Hollywood | first = James | last = O'Conner | date = January 19, 2020 | accessdate = January 19, 2020 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref>\n\nTarantino first created Cliff Booth, giving him a massive backstory. Then, the actor Booth was the stunt double for Rick Dalton. Tarantino decided to have them be [[Sharon Tate]]'s next-door neighbors in 1969. The first plot point he developed was the ending, then moved backwards from there, this being the first time Tarantino had worked this way. He thought of doing an [[Elmore Leonard]]-type story, but realized he was confident enough in his characters to let them drive the film and let it be a day in the life of Booth, Dalton, and Tate. He would use sequences from Dalton's films for the action, inspired by [[Richard Rush (director)|Richard Rush]]'s ''[[The Stunt Man]]'', which used the scenes from the [[WWI]] movie they were making within the film as the action.<ref>{{cite podcast |last=Lattanzio |first=Ryan |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/08/quentin-tarantino-paul-thomas-anderson-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-podcast-1202168301 |title=Listen to Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson Talk 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' |website=[[IndieWire]] |access-date=September 5, 2019 |date=August 24, 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829013436/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/08/quentin-tarantino-paul-thomas-anderson-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-podcast-1202168301/ |archivedate=August 29, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Further, to get his mind into the Dalton character, Tarantino wrote out five hypothetical episodes of the fictional television show ''Bounty Law'', in which Dalton had starred, having become fascinated with the amount of story crammed into half-hour episodes of 1950s western shows. Tarantino has expressed interest in turning these five scripts, as well as ideas for three more, into an actual ''Bounty Law'' television series in the future.<ref name=Tarantino-Deadline-Interview/>\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nOn July 11, 2017, it was announced that [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s next film would be about the [[Manson Family]] murders.

To prepare for her audition, [[Maya Hawke]] practiced with her father, [[Ethan Hawke]]. She said the process was unlike any other except maybe auditioning for drama school, and during it they worked on the scene in many different ways, with different combinations of people.

He also brought first-time collaborators production designer Barbara Ling based on her work in recreating historical settings in ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', and costume designer [[Arianne Phillips]], who had a strong client list to her name including [[Tom Ford]], [[James Mangold]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].<ref name=\"variety making 60s\">{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2020/artisans/production/quentin-tarantino-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-2-1203484354/ | title = Quentin Tarantino on Re-Creating 1960s L.A. for 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' | first = Jazz | last = Tangcay | date = January 29, 2020 | accessdate = January 29, 2020 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref> Production and filming required months of collaboration with city planners, business owners, set decorators, and construction crews. While filming at [[Musso & Frank Grill]], the owners brought out the original plates.\n\nTo film at the Pussycat Theater, production designer Barbara Ling and her team covered the building's [[LED]] signage and reattached the theater's iconic logo, rebuilding the letters and neon. Ling said the lettering on every marquee in the film is historically accurate. To restore Larry Edmund's Bookshop, she reproduced the original storefront sign and tracked down period-appropriate merchandise, even recreating book covers. For the Bruin and Fox Village theaters Ling's team restored the theaters, their marquees, and the storefronts around them. Stan's Donuts, across the street from the Bruin, got a complete makeover.<ref name=\"afar\">{{cite news |last=Wakim |first=Marielle |url=https://www.afar.com/magazine/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-filming-locations-you-can-visit-in-los-angeles |title='Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood' Filming Locations You Can Visit in Los Angeles |website=[[Afar (magazine)|Afar]] |access-date=September 2, 2019 |date=July 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903051130/https://www.afar.com/magazine/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-filming-locations-you-can-visit-in-los-angeles |archive-date=September 3, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> \n\nThe [[Playboy Mansion]] scene was shot at the actual mansion.<ref name=recreating-hollywood/><ref>{{cite web |last=Combemale |first=Leslie |url=https://www.mpaa.org/2019/08/artist-steve-chorney-on-crafting-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywoods-poster-more/ |title=Artist Steve Chorney on Crafting ''Once Upon a Time in Hollywood''{{'}}s Poster & More |website=[[Motion Picture Association of America]]| access-date=September 8, 2019 |date=August 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Minow |first=Nell |url=https://www.mpaa.org/2019/08/meet-the-caricaturist-who-created-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywoods-classic-mad-magazine-cover/ |title=Meet the Caricaturist who Created 'Once Upon a Time in...

Tarantino and Ling met with the new owner to discuss the parts of the property which they wanted to use, but he was reluctant since the property was in the middle of a renovation. After long negotiations he agreed, and Ling was able to dress the vacant mansion, front courtyard, and backyard for the party scene, evoking as much of the 1960s appearance of the mansion as possible.<ref name=recreating-Hollywood/>\n\nThe scenes involving the Tate-Polanski house were not filmed at Cielo Drive, the winding street where the 3,200 square-foot house once stood. The original house was razed in 1994 and replaced with a mansion nearly six-times the size. Scenes involving the Tate-Polanski house were filmed at three different locations around Los Angeles: one for the interior scenes, one for the scenes showing the exterior of the old house, and a Universal City location for the many scenes depicting the iconic cul-de-sac driveway.<ref>https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/recreate-sharon-tate-s-benedict-canyon-house-quentin-tarantino-turned-a-la-tour-guide-1227436</ref>\n\nFor ''Bounty Law'', Ling went for a dusty, dirty, early ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' look. Ling's team found one of the last great living Italian artists to do two of the film's posters. Other posters used and the mugs, are part of Tarantino's personal collection. Movie poster artist [[Steven Chorney]] created the poster for the film, as a reference to ''[[The Mod Squad]]''. He also created the posters for ''Nebraska Jim'', ''Operation Dyn-O-Mite'', ''Uccidimi Subito Ringo Disse il Gringo'', ''Hell-Fire Texas'', and ''Comanche Uprising'', which was reprinted for Dalton's home parking spot. [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'']] magazine caricaturist [[Tom Richmond (illustrator)|Tom Richmond]] created the covers of ''Mad'' and ''[[TV Guide]]'' featuring Dalton's Jake Cahill. Spahn Ranch was recreated in detail over about a three-month period. \n\nTarantino told cinematographer [[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]], \"I want it to feel retro but I want it to be contemporary.\" Richardson shot in [[Kodak]] [[35 mm movie film|35mm]] with [[Panavision]] cameras and lenses, in order to weave time periods. For ''Bounty Law'' they shot in black and white, and brief sequences in [[Super 8 film|Super 8]] and [[16mm]] [[Ektachrome]]. In the film, ''[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]'' was shot on a retrofitted Western Street backlot at [[Universal Studios]], designed by Ling. Richardson crossed ''Lancer'' with ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]]'' for the retro-future look Tarantino wanted. The way they filmed ''Lancer'' was not possible in 1969, but Tarantino wanted his personal touch on it. Richardson said that filming the movie touched him personally, \"The film speaks to all of us... We are all fragile beings with a limited time to achieve whatever it is we desire... that at any moment that place will shift... So take stock in life and have the courage to believe in yourself.\"<ref name=recreating-hollywood>{{cite web |last=Han |first=Karen |url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/28/8932339/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-quentin-tarantino-playboy-mansion |title=What it took to get the Playboy Mansion for Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |access-date=September 3, 2019 |date=July 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906142247/https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/28/8932339/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-quentin-tarantino-playboy-mansion |archive-date=September 6, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Desowitz |first=Bill |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-cinematographer-robert-richardson-quentin-tarantino-1969-1202159937/ |title=\"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\": How Cinematographer Robert Richardson captured 1969 in 2019 |website=[[IndieWire]] |access-date=September 3, 2019 |date=July 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723131120/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-cinematographer-robert-richardson-quentin-tarantino-1969-1202159937/ |archive-date=July 23, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe exterior of the Van Nuys drive-in scene was filmed at the Paramount Theater since the Van Nuys Theater no longer exists.

Booth struggles to find stunt work in Hollywood because of rumors he murdered his wife. Actress [[Sharon Tate]] (Robbie) and her husband, director [[Roman Polanski]] (Zawierucha), have moved [[10050 Cielo Drive|next door to Dalton]]. He dreams of befriending them to revive his declining acting career. That night, Tate and Polanski attend a celebrity-filled party at the [[Playboy Mansion]].\n\nThe next day, while repairing Dalton's TV antenna, Booth reminisces about a [[sparring]] contest he had with [[Bruce Lee]] on the set of ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'' which resulted in Booth being fired. Meanwhile, [[Charles Manson]] (Herriman) stops by the Polanski residence looking for [[Record producer|music producer]] [[Terry Melcher]], who used to live there, but is turned away by [[Jay Sebring]] (Hirsch). Tate goes out for errands and stops at a movie theater to watch herself in the film ''[[The Wrecking Crew (1968 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]''.\n\nDalton is cast to play the villain in the pilot of ''[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]'', and strikes up a conversation with his eight-year-old co-star, Trudi Fraser. Dalton struggles to remember his lines and later suffers a breakdown in his trailer. He subsequently delivers a performance that impresses Fraser and the director, [[Sam Wanamaker]], bolstering his confidence. \n\nWhile driving Dalton's car, Booth picks up a female hitchhiker named Pussycat, whom he takes to [[Spahn Ranch]], where Booth once worked on the set of ''Bounty Law.'' He takes notice of the many [[hippie]]s living there (the [[Manson Family]]). Suspecting they may be taking advantage of the ranch's owner, [[George Spahn]] (Dern), Booth insists on checking on him despite [[Lynette Fromme|\"Squeaky\" Fromme]]'s (Fanning) objections. Booth finally speaks with Spahn, who dismisses his concerns. Upon leaving, Booth discovers that [[Steve \"Clem\" Grogan]] has slashed a tire on Dalton's car; Booth beats him and forces him to change the tire. [[Tex Watson]] is summoned to deal with the situation but he arrives as Booth is driving away.\n\nAfter watching Dalton's guest performance on an episode of ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', Schwarz books him as the lead in [[Sergio Corbucci]]'s next Spaghetti Western, ''Nebraska Jim''. Dalton takes Booth with him for a six-month stint in Italy, during which he appears in two additional Westerns and a [[Eurospy film|Eurospy]] comedy, and marries Italian starlet Francesca Capucci. With a new wife, Dalton informs Booth he can no longer afford his services.\n\nOn the evening of August 8, 1969, their first day back in Los Angeles, Dalton and Booth go out for drinks to commemorate their time working together and then return to Dalton's house. Tate and Sebring go out for dinner with friends and then return to Tate's house. Booth smokes an [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]]-laced cigarette given to him by Pussycat and takes Brandy for a walk while Dalton prepares drinks. Manson Family members Tex, [[Susan Atkins|Sadie]], [[Linda Kasabian|Flower Child]], and [[Patricia Krenwinkel|Katie]] arrive outside in preparation to [[Tate\u2013LaBianca murders|murder everyone in Tate's house]]. Dalton hears the car and orders them to get off his street. [[Alternate history|Changing their plans]], the Manson Family members decide to instead kill Dalton after Sadie reasons that Hollywood has \"taught them to murder.\" Flower Child deserts the group, speeding off with their car. They break into Dalton's house and confront Capucci and Booth, who recognizes them from his visit to Spahn Ranch. Booth orders Brandy to attack, and together they kill Katie and Tex and injure Sadie, though Booth is stabbed and knocked unconscious in the altercation.

Tarantino tried other writing approaches: the early scene between DiCaprio's Dalton and Pacino's Marvin Schwarz was originally written as a one-act play as part of this exploratory work.<ref name=\"gamespot inspiration\"/>\n\nTarantino discovered the centerpiece for the work in 2009 while filming a movie with an actor that had the same stunt double for 20 years. Even though there was nothing but a small bit for the stuntman to do, Tarantino was asked to use him, and he agreed. The relationship fascinated Tarantino and inspired him to make a film about Hollywood.<ref name=recut/> Tarantino said that while the stuntman may have been a perfect double for the actor years earlier, at the time he had come to meet them, \"this was maybe the last or second-to-last thing they'd be doing together\".<ref name=\"gamespot inspiration\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/quentin-tarantino-reveals-inspiration-behind-once-/1100-6472880/ | title =Quentin Tarantino Reveals Inspiration Behind Once Upon A Time In Hollywood | first = James | last = O'Conner | date = January 19, 2020 | accessdate = January 19, 2020 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref>\n\nTarantino first created Cliff Booth, giving him a massive backstory. Then, the actor Booth was the stunt double for Rick Dalton. Tarantino decided to have them be [[Sharon Tate]]'s next-door neighbors in 1969. The first plot point he developed was the ending, then moved backwards from there, this being the first time Tarantino had worked this way. He thought of doing an [[Elmore Leonard]]-type story, but realized he was confident enough in his characters to let them drive the film and let it be a day in the life of Booth, Dalton, and Tate. He would use sequences from Dalton's films for the action, inspired by [[Richard Rush (director)|Richard Rush]]'s ''[[The Stunt Man]]'', which used the scenes from the [[WWI]] movie they were making within the film as the action.<ref>{{cite podcast |last=Lattanzio |first=Ryan |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/08/quentin-tarantino-paul-thomas-anderson-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-podcast-1202168301 |title=Listen to Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson Talk 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' |website=[[IndieWire]] |access-date=September 5, 2019 |date=August 24, 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829013436/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/08/quentin-tarantino-paul-thomas-anderson-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-podcast-1202168301/ |archivedate=August 29, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Further, to get his mind into the Dalton character, Tarantino wrote out five hypothetical episodes of the fictional television show ''Bounty Law'', in which Dalton had starred, having become fascinated with the amount of story crammed into half-hour episodes of 1950s western shows.

[[Sydney Sweeney]] said everyone she auditioned with did so for the same character, then were told they could do extra credit. Some did artwork, and she wrote a letter in character.

While filming at [[Musso & Frank Grill]], the owners brought out the original plates.\n\nTo film at the Pussycat Theater, production designer Barbara Ling and her team covered the building's [[LED]] signage and reattached the theater's iconic logo, rebuilding the letters and neon. Ling said the lettering on every marquee in the film is historically accurate. To restore Larry Edmund's Bookshop, she reproduced the original storefront sign and tracked down period-appropriate merchandise, even recreating book covers. For the Bruin and Fox Village theaters Ling's team restored the theaters, their marquees, and the storefronts around them. Stan's Donuts, across the street from the Bruin got a complete makeover.<ref name=\"afar\">{{cite news |last=Wakim |first=Marielle |url=https://www.afar.com/magazine/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-filming-locations-you-can-visit-in-los-angeles |title='Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood' Filming Locations You Can Visit in Los Angeles |website=[[Afar (magazine)|Afar]] |access-date=September 2, 2019 |date=July 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903051130/https://www.afar.com/magazine/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-filming-locations-you-can-visit-in-los-angeles |archive-date=September 3, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> \n\nThe [[Playboy Mansion]] scene was shot at the actual mansion.<ref name=recreating-hollywood/><ref>{{cite web |last=Combemale |first=Leslie |url=https://www.mpaa.org/2019/08/artist-steve-chorney-on-crafting-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywoods-poster-more/ |title=Artist Steve Chorney on Crafting ''Once Upon a Time in Hollywood''{{'}}s Poster & More |website=[[Motion Picture Association of America]]| access-date=September 8, 2019 |date=August 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Minow |first=Nell |url=https://www.mpaa.org/2019/08/meet-the-caricaturist-who-created-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywoods-classic-mad-magazine-cover/ |title=Meet the Caricaturist who Created 'Once Upon a Time in...

Tarantino and Ling met with the new owner to discuss the parts of the property which they wanted to use, but he was reluctant since the property was in the middle of a renovation. After long negotiations he agreed, and Ling was able to dress the vacant mansion, front courtyard, and backyard for the party scene, evoking as much of the 1960s appearance of the mansion as possible.<ref name=recreating-Hollywood/>\n\nThe scenes involving the Tate-Polanski house were not filmed at Cielo Drive, the winding street where the 3,200 square-foot house once stood. The original house was razed in 1994 and replaced with a mansion nearly six-times the size. Scenes involving the Tate-Polanski house were filmed at three different locations around Los Angeles: one for the interior scenes, one for the scenes showing the exterior of the old house, and a Universal City location for the many scenes depicting the iconic cul-de-sac driveway.<ref>https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/recreate-sharon-tate-s-benedict-canyon-house-quentin-tarantino-turned-a-la-tour-guide-1227436</ref>\n\nFor ''Bounty Law'', Ling went for a dusty, dirty, early ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' look. Ling's team found one of the last great living Italian artists to do two of the film's posters. Other posters used and the mugs, are part of Tarantino's personal collection. Movie poster artist [[Steven Chorney]] created the poster for the film, as a reference to ''[[The Mod Squad]]''. He also created the posters for ''Nebraska Jim'', ''Operation Dyn-O-Mite'', ''Uccidimi Subito Ringo Disse il Gringo'', ''Hell-Fire Texas'', and ''Comanche Uprising'', which was reprinted for Dalton's home parking spot. [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'']] magazine caricaturist [[Tom Richmond (illustrator)|Tom Richmond]] created the covers of ''Mad'' and ''[[TV Guide]]'' featuring Dalton's Jake Cahill. Spahn Ranch was recreated in detail over about a three-month period. \n\nTarantino told cinematographer [[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]], \"I want it to feel retro but I want it to be contemporary.\" Richardson shot in [[Kodak]] [[35 mm movie film|35mm]] with [[Panavision]] cameras and lenses, in order to weave time periods. For ''Bounty Law'' they shot in black and white, and brief sequences in [[Super 8 film|Super 8]] and [[16mm]] [[Ektachrome]]. In the film, ''[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]'' was shot on a retrofitted Western Street backlot at [[Universal Studios]], designed by Ling. Richardson crossed ''Lancer'' with ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]]'' for the retro-future look Tarantino wanted. The way they filmed ''Lancer'' was not possible in 1969, but Tarantino wanted his personal touch on it. Richardson said that filming the movie touched him personally, \"The film speaks to all of us... We are all fragile beings with a limited time to achieve whatever it is we desire... that at any moment that place will shift...

Nomad is armed with various futuristic weapons and equipment, most notably a \"[[Powered exoskeleton|Nanosuit]]\" which was inspired by the real-life military concept of [[Future Force Warrior]].<ref name=\"Inside Crysis: The Attack of The Lag\">{{cite web | url = http://www.atomicmpc.com.au/article.asp?SCID=27&CIID=60160 | title = Inside Crysis: The Attack of The Lag | accessdate = September 24, 2007 | date = September 2007 | author = Logan Booker | publisher = Atomicpc | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011060247/http://www.atomicmpc.com.au/article.asp?SCID=27&CIID=60160 | archivedate = October 11, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> In ''Crysis'', the player fights both North Korean and [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] enemies in various environments on and around the island.\n\n==Gameplay==\nAs with Crytek's previous game ''[[Far Cry (video game)|Far Cry]]'', ''Crysis'' is a first-person shooter game with many ways to meet objectives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/crysis/news.html?sid=6175656|title=Crysis Q&A - Development Updates and Open-Ended Gameplay|date=July 26, 2007|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=September 26, 2008}}</ref> The player controls a special forces soldier codenamed Nomad. The player's weapons can be customized without pausing the flow of time, for example changing firing modes, changing scopes or adding sound suppressors. \n\nThe player is also capable of selecting various modes in Nomad's military \"[[Powered exoskeleton|Nanosuit]]\" which draw power from the suit's energy. When the suit's energy is depleted, no modes can be used and the player is more vulnerable to damage before the suit recharges. One of four modes can be selected: Armor deflects damage and recharges the suit's energy faster; Strength allows stronger hand-to-hand combat, the ability to throw objects and enemies with deadly force, higher jumps, steadier aiming and reduced weapon recoil; Speed increases running and swimming speed, as well as other forms of motion such as reloading weapons; and [[Cloaking device|Cloak]], which renders Nomad almost completely invisible and suppresses movement noise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6182906/p-2.html|title=Crysis game guide (NanoSuit)|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=September 26, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe suit's integral facemask has its own [[HUD (computer gaming)|HUD]], displaying typical data including a tactical map, health, current energy levels, and weapons information. The view is electronic in nature, shown in-game through things such as a [[booting]] readout and visual distortion during abnormal operation. A particularly useful utility is the binocular function, which allows the player to zoom in and electronically tag enemies and vehicles from afar, thereby tracking their movement on the tactical display.\n\nThe player can engage enemies in a variety of ways; using stealth or aggression, bullets or non-lethal tranquilizers, ranged rifles or short-range weaponry, and so on. Enemy soldiers employ tactical maneuvers and work as squads. All soldiers will respond to noise caused by the player, including using [[flare gun|signal flares]] to call for reinforcements. If the player has not been detected in the area, enemies will exhibit relaxed behaviour, but if aware of the player they will draw weapons and become combative.<ref name=\"Five most innovative games of 2007\">{{cite web | url = http://my.mmoabc.com/article/Michael/1748.html?login=no | title = Crysis most innovative game of 2007 | accessdate = September 21, 2007 | date = September 21, 2007 | publisher = MMOABC |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071224024050/http://my.mmoabc.com/article/Michael/1748.html?login=no |archivedate = December 24, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Weapons===\nThe game features assault rifles, sub-machine guns, pistols, missile launchers, shotguns, [[minigun]]s, sniper rifles, gauss rifles ([[coilgun|coilguns]]), the MOAC (a machine gun style alien weapon which fires high-velocity ice shards), and the TAC gun (a hand-held nuclear grenade launcher). Most weapons can be modified with attachments; these attachments may be given to the player by default, acquired from picked-up weapons, or purchased in multiplayer. Attachment options are given a fair amount of leeway even if the end result may seem strange. For instance, a 4x/10x sniper [[Telescopic sight|scope]] can be attached to the [[Lead shot|buckshot]]-firing shotgun, though there might no practical use for such a particular combination. Additionally, most weapons have multiple firing modes (single/automatic fire) and different ammo types; for example, the KPA's FY-71 can fire both conventional bullets as well as incendiary bullets, which increase damage. Crysis also incorporates some features that have appeared in other recent shooters such as accounting for already-chambered rounds when a reload occurs.\n\n===Vehicles===\nA large selection of vehicles are present, most of which are usable by the player. Available ground vehicles range from pickup trucks to tanks, while naval vessels range from motorboats to light military hovercraft. A larger patrol boat is available in custom-made multiplayer maps using the [[Sandbox (video game editor)|sandbox editor]]. All vehicles, including [[Humvee]]s, pickup trucks, even tanks, have a [[turbo]] mode that can be activated via the Shift key (by default). The aircraft selection is limited to the North Korean attack helicopter and a fictional American [[VTOL]] (each of which can transport six passengers and two crew). Crytek also included an amphibious armored personnel carrier, its wheeled version  that can travel on water and land, although this vehicle was only available for those who pre-ordered the game.\n\nDamage modeling, although limited in vehicles, is most noticeable in the ability to burst tires, although wheeled vehicles can still move even if all the tires are gone, slowly rolling along on the rims. Tracked vehicles such as tanks or APCs can lose their tracks as a result of damage, but may continue moving even though there is no way for the drive sprockets to propel the vehicle. Exposed gas cans on Humvees can be shot in order to detonate their contents, which usually results in the explosion of the vehicle. While burning, destroyed vehicles will cause proximity heat damage to objects and characters. Unavailable vehicles shown in-game include jet aircraft, excavator, forklift and for reasons of scale, destroyers. None of the alien machines can be commandeered by players. The wheeled carts which would presumably be used to move aircraft or heavy vehicles, can also be moved by the player, but movement is very slow and useful for little more than entertainment and novelty.\n\n===Multiplayer===\nUp to 32 players are supported in each multiplayer match in ''Crysis'' multiplayer, which used the [[GameSpy]] Network and required the user to have an existing user ID or otherwise create a new one. There are two different modes, each with six available maps: Instant Action, a [[Deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] type mode; and Power Struggle, which is played by two opposing teams, each trying to destroy the other's headquarters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=172123|title=Huge Crysis multiplayer update from Crytek|last=Bishop|first=Stuart |date=September 14, 2007|publisher=Computer and Video Games|accessdate=September 26, 2008}}</ref>\n\n''Power Struggle'' features the American soldiers fighting the North Koreans; both sides, however, have nanosuits.<ref name=\"Crysis multiplayer\">{{cite web | url = http://www.incrysis.com/wiki/index.php/Crysis_Multiplayer | title = Multiplayer | accessdate = September 23, 2007 | publisher = inCrysis | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070917105308/http://www.incrysis.com/wiki/index.php/Crysis_Multiplayer | archivedate = September 17, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> All players begin armed with only a pistol and a nanosuit.<ref name=\"Crysis multiplayer\" /><ref name=\"Power Struggle summary\">{{cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2006/08/22/crysis-multiplayer-to-feature-10-hour-matches-multiple-day-nigh/ | title = Power Struggle summary | accessdate =September 23, 2007 | date = August 22, 2007 | publisher = [[Joystiq]]}}</ref> Weapons and vehicles can be found throughout the map, but generally must be bought by using \"Prestige Points,\" which are earned by killing enemies or capturing buildings.\n\nThe aim of Power Struggle is to destroy the enemy headquarters, a task which is achieved using [[nuclear weapon]]s in the form of a TAC Tank, a TAC launcher, or by using a Singularity Tank, which generates a temporary black hole in the target area. To gain access to nuclear or singularity weapons, the player must first capture the \"prototype facility\" which is used to make them, and then use the alien crash sites which feed the facility with energy necessary to build up enough energy to build [[weapons of mass destruction]].\n\nOne must earn Prestige Points, attained by killing enemies and taking over Bunkers, Power Stations, and Factories, to buy weapons and vehicles, including any of the aforementioned superweapons. Some of the weapons available in the game are machine guns, pistols, a shotgun, a precision rifle, ammo, a rocket launcher, explosives, and a gauss rifle (a sniper-type weapon able to kill another player in one shot).\n\nThe advanced weapons available for purchase from the Prototype Factory (aside from nuclear and singularity weapons) require 50% energy. Weapons the player can buy are the handheld minigun, the MOAC which has infinite ammo and fires ice shards, and the MOAR, which is an upgrade that can be attached to the MOAC causing it to fire a beam that will instantly freeze all enemies and some vehicles.\n\n''Capture The Flag'', originally planned to be included in the game, is no longer part of the game mode line up, due to its similarity to Power Struggle.<ref name=\"Crysis multiplayer\" /> Even so, Jack Mamais, lead designer, stated that Crytek hopes that this mode will be developed by the modding community.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=224&page=3|title=Crytek's Jack Mamais on Crysis|date=January 16, 2007|accessdate=August 17, 2007|publisher=Shacknews|author=Chris Remo|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604175747/http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=224&page=3|archivedate=June 4, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Crytek CEO Cevat Yerli also said that Team Action would not be included as a multiplayer mode, because players would gravitate towards either Instant Action, or Power Struggle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=81656|title=Interview with Cevat Yerli on Crysis Multiplayer|date=August 20, 2007|accessdate=August 21, 2007|publisher=Eurogamer|author=Ellie Gibson}}</ref>\n\nOn April 14, 2014, Crytek announced that the multiplayer mode will be unplayable after GameSpy switches off its servers on May 30, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-04-04-gamespy-servers-to-shut-down-next-month|title=GameSpy servers to shut down next month|last=Phillips|first=Tom|date=April 14, 2014|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe game begins on August 7, 2020 when [[Korean People's Army|North Korean forces]] led by General Ri-Chan Kyong take control of the Lingshan Islands. A team of American civilian archaeologists, led by Dr. Rosenthal, send out a [[Distress signal|distress call]] indicating that they have discovered something that could change the world. A week later, [[Delta Force]]'s Raptor Team is dispatched to the islands, with the core mission of evacuating them and securing any valuable information that they have. The team consists of Nomad, Psycho, Aztec, Jester and team leader Prophet (all under [[code name]]s); they are outfitted with technologically advanced [[Powered exoskeleton|Nanosuits]], which help protect them from gunfire and explosions, as well as giving them superhuman strength and abilities. As they perform a [[HALO jump|high-altitude jump]] onto one of the islands, an unknown flying entity disrupts the jump by smashing into Nomad, and the team is separated. The crash deactivates Nomad's Nanosuit and destroys his parachute, but he is saved because he lands on water and his suit absorbs the impact of the landing. After he makes his way to shore, Prophet is able to reset Nomad's suit remotely, restoring its normal function.\n\nAs Raptor Team regroups after the jump, Aztec is killed by an unknown entity. When the team finds him, they discover that whatever killed him also killed and dismembered a nearby squad of [[Korean People's Army|KPA]] soldiers. The remaining members of Raptor Team proceed with the mission. Along the way they discover the hostages' boat frozen on a hill near the coast of the island. They also get their first look at the aliens who have been attacking their team when a flying alien machine sneaks up on them and snatches Jester, killing him shortly thereafter. The first hostage the team rescues turns out to be a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent who was sent to monitor Dr. Rosenthal's work. In the jungle, Nomad finds another hostage named Badowski dead with ice shards in his back as the KPA battle an alien machine nearby. After Nomad regroups with Prophet, Prophet is suddenly snatched by another flying machine, which flies away with him in its grasp. Shortly after, Nomad is contacted over the radio by Major Clarence Strickland of the American military asking if he wishes to abort the mission since most of his team has been killed or missing; Nomad refuses, saying that he can still complete the mission.\n[[File:Crysis Engine.png|thumb|250px|right|A day/night cycle operates during the course of the single-player campaign.]]\n\nNomad makes his way to Dr. Rosenthal's research complex, where he has found a rare [[fossil]]ized artifact predating humanity by two&nbsp;million years. The partially excavated artifact resembles one of the flying machines (designated \"exosuits\") that has been attacking the team. Rosenthal also references other discoveries of similar artifacts in Afghanistan and Siberia, suggesting that the aliens have a global presence, and are not just confined to the island. While Rosenthal is running a scan on the artifact, it emits a powerful energy pulse that [[Flash freeze|freezes]] him solid. Nomad's Nanosuit is able to maintain his internal temperature, saving his life. Nomad then rendezvous with a [[VTOL]], after eliminating a Nanosuit-equipped four-man KPA special forces team near the landing site. He notifies his superiors about this, because the U.S. military had hoped to prevent the Koreans from acquiring Nanosuit technology.\n\nThe U.S. military then begins a full-scale invasion of the island, led by Major Strickland. As the U.S. forces continue to the main excavation site, the central mountain on the island begins to fall apart, revealing a huge alien structure inside, which is nearly the size of the mountain itself. Nomad enters the excavation site at the mountain's base, but is captured by Kyong's men. Kyong deactivates Nomad's Nanosuit, and Nomad watches, helpless, as Kyong shoots one of the hostages in the head and then detonates explosive charges to open the structure. An energy pulse emanates from the structure and kills Kyong's men; the pulse also reactivates Nomad's Nanosuit. Kyong, also wearing a Nanosuit, attacks Nomad, but Nomad is able to kill him. As the mountain continues to collapse, a VTOL evacuates the last hostage, Dr. Rosenthal's daughter Helena, but is unable to rescue Nomad.\n\nNomad gets trapped and decides to continue into the alien structure. It soon turns into a [[Weightlessness|zero gravity]] environment. Nomad uses his hydro-thrusters to maneuver and encounters hostile, intelligent aliens. He also sees a possible invasion force consisting of many alien [[robot|machines]]. Nomad manages to escape, but the structure creates a massive sphere of energy that freezes everything inside its structure to -200&nbsp;\u00b0F (-129&nbsp;\u00b0C). Once outside, Nomad is attacked by various Alien machines before finding Prophet. Prophet was able to engineer a weapon using the aliens' technology, the Molecular Accelerator (MOAC). Prophet's Nanosuit malfunctions, requiring him to frequently stop and recharge using heat sources, such as the burning wrecks of military vehicles. The two leave the ice sphere and rescue Helena, whose VTOL has crashed. Prophet leaves with Helena on another VTOL. At the U.S. evacuation point, one of the last VTOLs rescues Nomad from an unstoppable [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] alien exosuit. Just as the exosuit is about to destroy the VTOL, Major Strickland draws its attention by firing at it using a mounted machine gun and the exosuit kills Strickland instead. As they leave the island, the pilot is killed and the engines are damaged. Nomad flies the crippled VTOL back to the [[USS Enterprise (CVN-80)|USS ''Constitution'' (CVN-80)]] [[Carrier strike group|Carrier Strike Group]] while fighting off aliens along the way.\n\nOnce there, he meets up again with Psycho and is then debriefed by Admiral Richard Morrison who explains that a nuclear strike has been ordered against the ice sphere. Helena warns him that the aliens might absorb the energy, but the Admiral ignores her. Prophet flies a VTOL back to the island against orders. Despite Prophet's departure, the nuclear missile is launched at the ice sphere. The explosion causes the ice sphere to expand and prompts a massive alien counterattack.\n\nNomad is ordered to repair one of the carrier's damaged nuclear reactors. The Nanosuit is resistant to high levels of radiation, although prolonged exposure proves deadly. While Nomad is in the reactor room, Helena sends an experimental signal through Nomad's suit that causes several alien machines to absorb too much power and overload, destroying them. As Nomad returns to the carrier's flight deck, Admiral Morrison is killed and Nomad takes the prototype TAC-Cannon. On the flight deck, Nomad fights an alien exosuit similar to the one that killed Strickland. A massive alien warship then emerges from the sea, and Helena manages to deactivate its shields by sending a signal through Nomad's Nanosuit. Nomad then uses the TAC-Cannon to destroy the alien warship, which crashes down onto the carrier and begins to sink it. Nomad runs across the flight deck and jumps off the carrier into the waiting VTOL, which is piloted by Psycho. As they fly away, Helena is nearly pulled out of the aircraft by the energy field created by the destroyed alien warship. The ship drags the ''Constitution'' beneath the surface and vaporizes, creating a massive vortex that engulfs and destroys the entire carrier fleet. Psycho then receives a transmission that there is another carrier strike group en route to the island and suggests meeting them. Nomad protests, claiming that since they now know how to defeat the aliens, they need to continue fighting. A transmission from Prophet, who is inside the energy field on the island, is then received. The VTOL is then seen turning around and heading back to the island.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Game engine===\n{{main|CryEngine 2}}\n[[File:Crysis lighting.jpg|thumb|An in-game screenshot of ''Crysis'', showing the game's [[volumetric lighting]] effects.

The phrase was applied jokingly to non-gaming computers (such as [[NASA]] mainframes) or historical computing hardware (such as [[ENIAC]]). Later ''Crysis'' games, which were co-developed for both personal computers and consoles, were more focused on good performance on all platforms, and had dropped some of the demanding rendering aspects of the game engine, thus making the \"But can it run ''Crysis''?\" question moot.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/but-can-it-run-crysis10-years-of-a-pc-gaming-meme/ | title = 'But can it run Crysis?'\u201410 years of a PC gaming meme | first = James | last = Davenport | date = November 13, 2017 | accessdate = November 13, 2017 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\n==Sequels==\n{{main|Crysis 2|Crysis 3|}}\nOn May 30, 2009, Crytek announced the second chapter in the ''Crysis'' trilogy, which continued where the first game ended.

Nomad is armed with various futuristic weapons and equipment, most notably a \"[[Powered exoskeleton|Nanosuit]]\" which was inspired by the real-life military concept of [[Future Force Warrior]].<ref name=\"Inside Crysis: The Attack of The Lag\">{{cite web | url = http://www.atomicmpc.com.au/article.asp?SCID=27&CIID=60160 | title = Inside Crysis: The Attack of The Lag | accessdate = September 24, 2007 | date = September 2007 | author = Logan Booker | publisher = Atomicpc | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011060247/http://www.atomicmpc.com.au/article.asp?SCID=27&CIID=60160 | archivedate = October 11, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> In ''Crysis'', the player fights both North Korean and [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] enemies in various environments on and around the island.\n\n==Gameplay==\nAs with Crytek's previous game ''[[Far Cry (video game)|Far Cry]]'', ''Crysis'' is a first-person shooter game with many ways to meet objectives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/crysis/news.html?sid=6175656|title=Crysis Q&A - Development Updates and Open-Ended Gameplay|date=July 26, 2007|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=September 26, 2008}}</ref> The player controls a special forces soldier codenamed Nomad. The player's weapons can be customized without pausing the flow of time, for example changing firing modes, changing scopes or adding sound suppressors. \n\nThe player is also capable of selecting various modes in Nomad's military \"[[Powered exoskeleton|Nanosuit]]\" which draw power from the suit's energy. When the suit's energy is depleted, no modes can be used and the player is more vulnerable to damage before the suit recharges. One of four modes can be selected: Armor deflects damage and recharges the suit's energy faster; Strength allows stronger hand-to-hand combat, the ability to throw objects and enemies with deadly force, higher jumps, steadier aiming and reduced weapon recoil; Speed increases running and swimming speed, as well as other forms of motion such as reloading weapons; and [[Cloaking device|Cloak]], which renders Nomad almost completely invisible and suppresses movement noise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6182906/p-2.html|title=Crysis game guide (NanoSuit)|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=September 26, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe suit's integral facemask has its own [[HUD (computer gaming)|HUD]], displaying typical data including a tactical map, health, current energy levels, and weapons information. The view is electronic in nature, shown in-game through things such as a [[booting]] readout and visual distortion during abnormal operation. A particularly useful utility is the binocular function, which allows the player to zoom in and electronically tag enemies and vehicles from afar, thereby tracking their movement on the tactical display.\n\nThe player can engage enemies in a variety of ways; using stealth or aggression, bullets or non-lethal tranquilizers, ranged rifles or short-range weaponry, and so on. Enemy soldiers employ tactical maneuvers and work as squads. All soldiers will respond to noise caused by the player, including using [[flare gun|signal flares]] to call for reinforcements. If the player has not been detected in the area, enemies will exhibit relaxed behaviour, but if aware of the player they will draw weapons and become combative.<ref name=\"Five most innovative games of 2007\">{{cite web | url = http://my.mmoabc.com/article/Michael/1748.html?login=no | title = Crysis most innovative game of 2007 | accessdate = September 21, 2007 | date = September 21, 2007 | publisher = MMOABC |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071224024050/http://my.mmoabc.com/article/Michael/1748.html?login=no |archivedate = December 24, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Weapons===\nThe game features assault rifles, sub-machine guns, pistols, missile launchers, shotguns, [[minigun]]s, sniper rifles, gauss rifles ([[coilgun|coilguns]]), the MOAC (a machine gun style alien weapon which fires high-velocity ice shards), and the TAC gun (a hand-held nuclear grenade launcher). Most weapons can be modified with attachments; these attachments may be given to the player by default, acquired from picked-up weapons, or purchased in multiplayer. Attachment options are given a fair amount of leeway even if the end result may seem strange. For instance, a 4x/10x sniper [[Telescopic sight|scope]] can be attached to the [[Lead shot|buckshot]]-firing shotgun, though there might no practical use for such a particular combination. Additionally, most weapons have multiple firing modes (single/automatic fire) and different ammo types; for example, the KPA's FY-71 can fire both conventional bullets as well as incendiary bullets, which increase damage. Crysis also incorporates some features that have appeared in other recent shooters such as accounting for already-chambered rounds when a reload occurs.\n\n===Vehicles===\nA large selection of vehicles are present, most of which are usable by the player. Available ground vehicles range from pickup trucks to tanks, while naval vessels range from motorboats to light military hovercraft. A larger patrol boat is available in custom-made multiplayer maps using the [[Sandbox (video game editor)|sandbox editor]]. All vehicles, including [[Humvee]]s, pickup trucks, even tanks, have a [[turbo]] mode that can be activated via the Shift key (by default). The aircraft selection is limited to the North Korean attack helicopter and a fictional American [[VTOL]] (each of which can transport six passengers and two crew). Crytek also included an amphibious armored personnel carrier, its wheeled version  that can travel on water and land, although this vehicle was only available for those who pre-ordered the game.\n\nDamage modeling, although limited in vehicles, is most noticeable in the ability to burst tires, although wheeled vehicles can still move even if all the tires are gone, slowly rolling along on the rims. Tracked vehicles such as tanks or APCs can lose their tracks as a result of damage, but may continue moving even though there is no way for the drive sprockets to propel the vehicle. Exposed gas cans on Humvees can be shot in order to detonate their contents, which usually results in the explosion of the vehicle. While burning, destroyed vehicles will cause proximity heat damage to objects and characters. Unavailable vehicles shown in-game include jet aircraft, excavator, forklift and for reasons of scale, destroyers. None of the alien machines can be commandeered by players. The wheeled carts which would presumably be used to move aircraft or heavy vehicles, can also be moved by the player, but movement is very slow and useful for little more than entertainment and novelty.\n\n===Multiplayer===\nUp to 32 players are supported in each multiplayer match in ''Crysis'' multiplayer, which used the [[GameSpy]] Network and required the user to have an existing user ID or otherwise create a new one. There are two different modes, each with six available maps: Instant Action, a [[Deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] type mode; and Power Struggle, which is played by two opposing teams, each trying to destroy the other's headquarters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=172123|title=Huge Crysis multiplayer update from Crytek|last=Bishop|first=Stuart |date=September 14, 2007|publisher=Computer and Video Games|accessdate=September 26, 2008}}</ref>\n\n''Power Struggle'' features the American soldiers fighting the North Koreans; both sides, however, have nanosuits.<ref name=\"Crysis multiplayer\">{{cite web | url = http://www.incrysis.com/wiki/index.php/Crysis_Multiplayer | title = Multiplayer | accessdate = September 23, 2007 | publisher = inCrysis | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070917105308/http://www.incrysis.com/wiki/index.php/Crysis_Multiplayer | archivedate = September 17, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> All players begin armed with only a pistol and a nanosuit.<ref name=\"Crysis multiplayer\" /><ref name=\"Power Struggle summary\">{{cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2006/08/22/crysis-multiplayer-to-feature-10-hour-matches-multiple-day-nigh/ | title = Power Struggle summary | accessdate =September 23, 2007 | date = August 22, 2007 | publisher = [[Joystiq]]}}</ref> Weapons and vehicles can be found throughout the map, but generally must be bought by using \"Prestige Points,\" which are earned by killing enemies or capturing buildings.\n\nThe aim of Power Struggle is to destroy the enemy headquarters, a task which is achieved using [[nuclear weapon]]s in the form of a TAC Tank, a TAC launcher, or by using a Singularity Tank, which generates a temporary black hole in the target area. To gain access to nuclear or singularity weapons, the player must first capture the \"prototype facility\" which is used to make them, and then use the alien crash sites which feed the facility with energy necessary to build up enough energy to build [[weapons of mass destruction]].\n\nOne must earn Prestige Points, attained by killing enemies and taking over Bunkers, Power Stations, and Factories, to buy weapons and vehicles, including any of the aforementioned superweapons. Some of the weapons available in the game are machine guns, pistols, a shotgun, a precision rifle, ammo, a rocket launcher, explosives, and a gauss rifle (a sniper-type weapon able to kill another player in one shot).\n\nThe advanced weapons available for purchase from the Prototype Factory (aside from nuclear and singularity weapons) require 50% energy. Weapons the player can buy are the handheld minigun, the MOAC which has infinite ammo and fires ice shards, and the MOAR, which is an upgrade that can be attached to the MOAC causing it to fire a beam that will instantly freeze all enemies and some vehicles.\n\n''Capture The Flag'', originally planned to be included in the game, is no longer part of the game mode line up, due to its similarity to Power Struggle.<ref name=\"Crysis multiplayer\" /> Even so, Jack Mamais, lead designer, stated that Crytek hopes that this mode will be developed by the modding community.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=224&page=3|title=Crytek's Jack Mamais on Crysis|date=January 16, 2007|accessdate=August 17, 2007|publisher=Shacknews|author=Chris Remo|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604175747/http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=224&page=3|archivedate=June 4, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Crytek CEO Cevat Yerli also said that Team Action would not be included as a multiplayer mode, because players would gravitate towards either Instant Action, or Power Struggle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=81656|title=Interview with Cevat Yerli on Crysis Multiplayer|date=August 20, 2007|accessdate=August 21, 2007|publisher=Eurogamer|author=Ellie Gibson}}</ref>\n\nOn April 14, 2014, Crytek announced that the multiplayer mode will be unplayable after GameSpy switches off its servers on May 30, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-04-04-gamespy-servers-to-shut-down-next-month|title=GameSpy servers to shut down next month|last=Phillips|first=Tom|date=April 14, 2014|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe game begins on August 7, 2020 when [[Korean People's Army|North Korean forces]] led by General Ri-Chan Kyong take control of the Lingshan Islands. A team of American civilian archaeologists, led by Dr. Rosenthal, send out a [[Distress signal|distress call]] indicating that they have discovered something that could change the world. A week later, [[Delta Force]]'s Raptor Team is dispatched to the islands, with the core mission of evacuating them and securing any valuable information that they have. The team consists of Nomad, Psycho, Aztec, Jester and team leader Prophet (all under [[code name]]s); they are outfitted with technologically advanced [[Powered exoskeleton|Nanosuits]], which help protect them from gunfire and explosions, as well as giving them superhuman strength and abilities. As they perform a [[HALO jump|high-altitude jump]] onto one of the islands, an unknown flying entity disrupts the jump by smashing into Nomad, and the team is separated. The crash deactivates Nomad's Nanosuit and destroys his parachute, but he is saved because he lands on water and his suit absorbs the impact of the landing. After he makes his way to shore, Prophet is able to reset Nomad's suit remotely, restoring its normal function.\n\nAs Raptor Team regroups after the jump, Aztec is killed by an unknown entity. When the team finds him, they discover that whatever killed him also killed and dismembered a nearby squad of [[Korean People's Army|KPA]] soldiers. The remaining members of Raptor Team proceed with the mission. Along the way they discover the hostages' boat frozen on a hill near the coast of the island. They also get their first look at the aliens who have been attacking their team when a flying alien machine sneaks up on them and snatches Jester, killing him shortly thereafter. The first hostage the team rescues turns out to be a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent who was sent to monitor Dr. Rosenthal's work. In the jungle, Nomad finds another hostage named Badowski dead with ice shards in his back as the KPA battle an alien machine nearby. After Nomad regroups with Prophet, Prophet is suddenly snatched by another flying machine, which flies away with him in its grasp. Shortly after, Nomad is contacted over the radio by Major Clarence Strickland of the American military asking if he wishes to abort the mission since most of his team has been killed or missing; Nomad refuses, saying that he can still complete the mission.\n[[File:Crysis Engine.png|thumb|250px|right|A day/night cycle operates during the course of the single-player campaign.]]\n\nNomad makes his way to Dr. Rosenthal's research complex, where he has found a rare [[fossil]]ized artifact predating humanity by two&nbsp;million years. The partially excavated artifact resembles one of the flying machines (designated \"exosuits\") that has been attacking the team. Rosenthal also references other discoveries of similar artifacts in Afghanistan and Siberia, suggesting that the aliens have a global presence, and are not just confined to the island. While Rosenthal is running a scan on the artifact, it emits a powerful energy pulse that [[Flash freeze|freezes]] him solid. Nomad's Nanosuit is able to maintain his internal temperature, saving his life. Nomad then rendezvous with a [[VTOL]], after eliminating a Nanosuit-equipped four-man KPA special forces team near the landing site. He notifies his superiors about this, because the U.S. military had hoped to prevent the Koreans from acquiring Nanosuit technology.\n\nThe U.S. military then begins a full-scale invasion of the island, led by Major Strickland. As the U.S. forces continue to the main excavation site, the central mountain on the island begins to fall apart, revealing a huge alien structure inside, which is nearly the size of the mountain itself. Nomad enters the excavation site at the mountain's base, but is captured by Kyong's men. Kyong deactivates Nomad's Nanosuit, and Nomad watches, helpless, as Kyong shoots one of the hostages in the head and then detonates explosive charges to open the structure. An energy pulse emanates from the structure and kills Kyong's men; the pulse also reactivates Nomad's Nanosuit. Kyong, also wearing a Nanosuit, attacks Nomad, but Nomad is able to kill him. As the mountain continues to collapse, a VTOL evacuates the last hostage, Dr. Rosenthal's daughter Helena, but is unable to rescue Nomad.\n\nNomad gets trapped and decides to continue into the alien structure. It soon turns into a [[Weightlessness|zero gravity]] environment. Nomad uses his hydro-thrusters to maneuver and encounters hostile, intelligent aliens. He also sees a possible invasion force consisting of many alien [[robot|machines]]. Nomad manages to escape, but the structure creates a massive sphere of energy that freezes everything inside its structure to -200&nbsp;\u00b0F (-129&nbsp;\u00b0C). Once outside, Nomad is attacked by various Alien machines before finding Prophet. Prophet was able to engineer a weapon using the aliens' technology, the Molecular Accelerator (MOAC). Prophet's Nanosuit malfunctions, requiring him to frequently stop and recharge using heat sources, such as the burning wrecks of military vehicles. The two leave the ice sphere and rescue Helena, whose VTOL has crashed. Prophet leaves with Helena on another VTOL. At the U.S. evacuation point, one of the last VTOLs rescues Nomad from an unstoppable [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] alien exosuit. Just as the exosuit is about to destroy the VTOL, Major Strickland draws its attention by firing at it using a mounted machine gun and the exosuit kills Strickland instead. As they leave the island, the pilot is killed and the engines are damaged. Nomad flies the crippled VTOL back to the [[USS Enterprise (CVN-80)|USS ''Constitution'' (CVN-80)]] [[Carrier strike group|Carrier Strike Group]] while fighting off aliens along the way.\n\nOnce there, he meets up again with Psycho and is then debriefed by Admiral Richard Morrison who explains that a nuclear strike has been ordered against the ice sphere. Helena warns him that the aliens might absorb the energy, but the Admiral ignores her. Prophet flies a VTOL back to the island against orders. Despite Prophet's departure, the nuclear missile is launched at the ice sphere. The explosion causes the ice sphere to expand and prompts a massive alien counterattack.\n\nNomad is ordered to repair one of the carrier's damaged nuclear reactors. The Nanosuit is resistant to high levels of radiation, although prolonged exposure proves deadly. While Nomad is in the reactor room, Helena sends an experimental signal through Nomad's suit that causes several alien machines to absorb too much power and overload, destroying them. As Nomad returns to the carrier's flight deck, Admiral Morrison is killed and Nomad takes the prototype TAC-Cannon. On the flight deck, Nomad fights an alien exosuit similar to the one that killed Strickland. A massive alien warship then emerges from the sea, and Helena manages to deactivate its shields by sending a signal through Nomad's Nanosuit. Nomad then uses the TAC-Cannon to destroy the alien warship, which crashes down onto the carrier and begins to sink it. Nomad runs across the flight deck and jumps off the carrier into the waiting VTOL, which is piloted by Psycho. As they fly away, Helena is nearly pulled out of the aircraft by the energy field created by the destroyed alien warship. The ship drags the ''Constitution'' beneath the surface and vaporizes, creating a massive vortex that engulfs and destroys the entire carrier fleet. Psycho then receives a transmission that there is another carrier strike group en route to the island and suggests meeting them. Nomad protests, claiming that since they now know how to defeat the aliens, they need to continue fighting. A transmission from Prophet, who is inside the energy field on the island, is then received. The VTOL is then seen turning around and heading back to the island.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Game engine===\n{{main|CryEngine 2}}\n[[File:Crysis lighting.jpg|thumb|An in-game screenshot of ''Crysis'', showing the game's [[volumetric lighting]] effects.

Later ''Crysis'' games, which were co-developed for both personal computers and consoles, were more focused on good performance on all platforms, and had dropped some of the demanding rendering aspects of the game engine, thus making the \"But can it run ''Crysis''?\" question moot.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/but-can-it-run-crysis10-years-of-a-pc-gaming-meme/ | title = 'But can it run Crysis?'\u201410 years of a PC gaming meme | first = James | last = Davenport | date = November 13, 2017 | accessdate = November 13, 2017 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\n==Sequels==\n{{main|Crysis 2|Crysis 3|}}\nOn May 30, 2009, Crytek announced the second chapter in the ''Crysis'' trilogy, which continued where the first game ended.

The disease can cause bleeding (haemorrhage), fever and other symptoms similar to [[Ebola]]. However, Marburg virus is not the same as Ebola, although similar. Actual treatment of the virus after infection is not possible but early, professional treatment of symptoms like dehydration considerably increases survival chances.<ref>Marburg virus disease Fact sheet Updated October 2017 http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs_marburg/en/</ref>\n\nIn 2009, expanded [[clinical trial]]s of an [[Ebola]] and Marburg [[vaccine]] began in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]].<ref>Beth Skwarecki [http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/831858 Ebola, Marburg DNA Vaccines Prove Safe in Phase 1 Trial] Medscape Medical News, September 17, 2014</ref><ref>[http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00997607 Evaluating an Ebola and a Marburg Vaccine in Uganda] [[U.S. Department of Health & Human Services]]</ref>\n\n==Discovery==\nMarburg virus was first described in 1967.<ref name=Siegert1967>{{Cite journal\n | last1 = Siegert | first1 = R.\n | last2 = Shu | first2 = H.

Associated with the ribonucleoprotein is the [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] (L) with the polymerase cofactor (VP35) and a transcription activator (VP30). The ribonucleoprotein is embedded in a matrix, formed by the major (VP40) and minor (VP24) matrix proteins. These particles are surrounded by a [[lipid bilayer|lipid membrane]] derived from the host cell membrane. The membrane anchors a glycoprotein (GP<sub>1,2</sub>) that projects 7 to 10&nbsp;nm spikes away from its surface.

The virus RdRp partially uncoats the nucleocapsid and [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribes]] the [[genes]] into positive-stranded [[mRNA]]s, which are then [[translation (biology)|translated]] into structural and nonstructural [[proteins]]. Marburgvirus L binds to a single [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] located at the 3' end of the genome. Transcription either terminates after a gene or continues to the next gene downstream. This means that genes close to the 3' end of the genome are transcribed in the greatest abundance, whereas those toward the 5' end are least likely to be transcribed. The gene order is therefore a simple but effective form of transcriptional regulation. The most abundant protein produced is the [[nucleoprotein]], whose [[concentration]] in the cell determines when L switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication results in full-length, positive-stranded antigenomes that are in turn transcribed into negative-stranded virus progeny genome copies. Newly synthesized structural proteins and genomes self-assemble and accumulate near the inside of the [[cell membrane]]. Virions [[Budding|bud]] off from the cell, gaining their envelopes from the cellular membrane they bud from. The mature progeny particles then infect other cells to repeat the cycle.<ref name=Feldmann2005/>\n\n==Ecology==\nIn 2009, the successful isolation of infectious MARV was reported from caught healthy [[Rousettus aegyptiacus|Egyptian fruit bats (''Rousettus aegyptiacus'')]].<ref name=\"Towner2009\"/> This isolation, together with the isolation of infectious [[RAVV]],<ref name=Towner2009/> strongly suggests that [[Old World]] fruit [[bat]]s are involved in the natural maintenance of marburgviruses.

The most probable location of the Marburg virus ancestor was Uganda whereas that of the RAVV ancestor was Kenya.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Biological weapon==\nThe [[Soviet Union]] had an extensive offensive and defensive [[Biological warfare|biological weapon]]s program that included MARV.<ref name=Alibek1999>{{Cite book|last1=Alibek|first1=Steven|last2=Handelman|title=Biohazard: The Chilling True Story of the Largest Covert Biological Weapons Program in the World\u2014Told from Inside by the Man Who Ran It|publisher=Random House|location=New York |isbn=978-0-385-33496-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eDTaCwAAQBAJ|year=1999}}</ref> At least three Soviet research institutes had MARV research programs during the [[Cold War]]: the Virology Center of the Scientific-Research Institute for Microbiology in Zagorsk (today [[Sergiev Posad]]), the Scientific-Production Association \"Vektor\" (today the [[State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR|State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology \"Vektor\"]]) in [[Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Oblast|Koltsovo]], and the Irkutsk Scientific-Research Anti-Plague Institute of Siberia and the Far East in [[Irkutsk]]. As most performed research was highly [[classified information|classified]], it remains unclear how successful the MARV program was.

At the center is the [[Helix|helical]] [[ribonucleoprotein|ribonucleocapsid]], which consists of the genomic RNA wrapped around a [[polymer]] of [[nucleoprotein]]s (NP). Associated with the ribonucleoprotein is the [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] (L) with the polymerase cofactor (VP35) and a transcription activator (VP30). The ribonucleoprotein is embedded in a matrix, formed by the major (VP40) and minor (VP24) matrix proteins. These particles are surrounded by a [[lipid bilayer|lipid membrane]] derived from the host cell membrane. The membrane anchors a glycoprotein (GP<sub>1,2</sub>) that projects 7 to 10&nbsp;nm spikes away from its surface.

Marburgvirus L binds to a single [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] located at the 3' end of the genome. Transcription either terminates after a gene or continues to the next gene downstream. This means that genes close to the 3' end of the genome are transcribed in the greatest abundance, whereas those toward the 5' end are least likely to be transcribed. The gene order is therefore a simple but effective form of transcriptional regulation. The most abundant protein produced is the [[nucleoprotein]], whose [[concentration]] in the cell determines when L switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication results in full-length, positive-stranded antigenomes that are in turn transcribed into negative-stranded virus progeny genome copies. Newly synthesized structural proteins and genomes self-assemble and accumulate near the inside of the [[cell membrane]]. Virions [[Budding|bud]] off from the cell, gaining their envelopes from the cellular membrane they bud from. The mature progeny particles then infect other cells to repeat the cycle.<ref name=Feldmann2005/>\n\n==Ecology==\nIn 2009, the successful isolation of infectious MARV was reported from caught healthy [[Rousettus aegyptiacus|Egyptian fruit bats (''Rousettus aegyptiacus'')]].<ref name=\"Towner2009\"/> This isolation, together with the isolation of infectious [[RAVV]],<ref name=Towner2009/> strongly suggests that [[Old World]] fruit [[bat]]s are involved in the natural maintenance of marburgviruses. Further studies are necessary to establish whether Egyptian rousettes are the actual hosts of MARV and RAVV or whether they get infected via contact with another animal and therefore serve only as intermediate hosts. In 2012 the first experimental infection study of ''Rousettus aegyptiacus'' with MARV provided further insight into the possible involvement of these bats in MARV ecology.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0045479\n| pmid = 23029039\n| title = Virological and Serological Findings in Rousettus aegyptiacus Experimentally Inoculated with Vero Cells-Adapted Hogan Strain of Marburg Virus\n| journal = PLOS ONE\n| volume = 7\n| issue = 9\n| pages = e45479\n| year = 2012\n| last1 = Paweska | first1 = J.

The virus also replicated to high titers in major organs (liver and spleen), and organs that might possibly be involved in virus transmission (lung, intestine, reproductive organs, salivary gland, kidney, bladder and mammary gland). The relatively long period of viremia noted in this experiment could possibly also facilitate mechanical transmission by blood sucking arthropods in addition to infection of susceptible vertebrate hosts by direct contact with infected blood.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Evolution==\nThe viral strains fall into two clades\u2014Ravn virus and Marburg virus.<ref name=Zehender2016>{{cite journal |vauthors=Zehender G, Sorrentino C, Veo C, Fiaschi L, Gioffr\u00e8 S, Ebranati E, Tanzi E, Ciccozzi M, Lai A, Galli M |title=Distribution of Marburg virus in Africa: An evolutionary approach |journal=Infect.

Orbital predictions several days earlier indicated that the two satellites were expected to occupy the same point in space within 30 milliseconds of each other. On 3 April, telescope operators decided to stow the satellite's high-gain parabolic antenna, rotate the solar panels out of the way and to fire Fermi's rocket thrusters for one second to move it out of the way. Even though the thrusters had been idle since the telescope had been placed in orbit nearly five years earlier, they worked correctly and potential disaster was thus avoided.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/bullet-dodge.html |title=The Day NASA's Fermi Dodged a 1.5-ton Bullet |publisher=NASA |date=30 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Extended mission 2013-2018 ===\nIn August 2013 Fermi started its 5-year mission extension.<ref name=fme2013>{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasas-fermi-celebrates-five-years-in-space-enters-extended-mission/ |title=NASA's Fermi Celebrates Five Years in Space, Enters Extended Mission |publisher=NASA |first=Francis |last=Reddy |date=21 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Pass 8 software upgrade ===\n[[File:Fermi Carina Text.png|thumb|Comparison of two Fermi LAT views of the same region in the constellation Carina.

Significant improvements to Pass 6 were included in Pass 7 which debuted in August 2011.\n\nEvery detection by the Fermi LAT since its launch, was reexamined with the latest tools to learn how the LAT detector responded to both each [[Event (particle physics)|event]] and to the [[Background radiation|background]].

The entire mission dataset was reprocessed.\n\nThese improvements have the greatest impact on both the low and high ends of the range of energy Fermi LAT can detect - in effect expanding the energy range within which LAT can make useful observations. The improvement in the performance of Fermi LAT due to Pass 8 is so dramatic that this software update is sometimes called the cheapest satellite upgrade in history.

[[Photons]] hit thin metal sheets, converting to [[electron]]-[[positron]] pairs, via a process termed [[pair production]]. These charged particles pass through interleaved layers of silicon [[microstrip detector]]s, causing [[ionization]] which produce detectable tiny pulses of electric charge. Researchers can combine information from several layers of this tracker to determine the path of the particles. After passing through the tracker, the particles enter the [[calorimeter]], which consists of a stack of [[caesium iodide]] [[scintillator]] crystals to measure the total energy of the particles. The LAT's field of view is large, about 20% of the sky. The resolution of its images is modest by astronomical standards, a few [[arc minute]]s for the highest-energy photons and about 3 degrees at 100 [[MeV]]. It is sensitive from {{val|20|ul=MeV}} to {{val|300|ul=GeV}} (from medium up to some [[very-high-energy gamma ray]]s). The LAT is a bigger and better successor to the [[EGRET (telescope)|EGRET]] instrument on [[NASA]]'s [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] satellite in the 1990s. Several countries produced the components of the LAT, who then sent the components for assembly at [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]]. SLAC also hosts the LAT Instrument Science Operations Center, which supports the operation of the LAT during the Fermi mission for the LAT scientific collaboration and for NASA.\n\n== Education and public outreach ==\nEducation and public outreach are important components of the Fermi project.

[[Photons]] hit thin metal sheets, converting to [[electron]]-[[positron]] pairs, via a process termed [[pair production]]. These charged particles pass through interleaved layers of silicon [[microstrip detector]]s, causing [[ionization]] which produce detectable tiny pulses of electric charge. Researchers can combine information from several layers of this tracker to determine the path of the particles. After passing through the tracker, the particles enter the [[calorimeter]], which consists of a stack of [[caesium iodide]] [[scintillator]] crystals to measure the total energy of the particles. The LAT's field of view is large, about 20% of the sky. The resolution of its images is modest by astronomical standards, a few [[arc minute]]s for the highest-energy photons and about 3 degrees at 100 [[MeV]]. It is sensitive from {{val|20|ul=MeV}} to {{val|300|ul=GeV}} (from medium up to some [[very-high-energy gamma ray]]s). The LAT is a bigger and better successor to the [[EGRET (telescope)|EGRET]] instrument on [[NASA]]'s [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] satellite in the 1990s. Several countries produced the components of the LAT, who then sent the components for assembly at [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]].
