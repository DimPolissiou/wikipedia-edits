There are two main beliefs associated with the name of this district. The first is that Panchargarh was named after an area called Pancha Nagari in the kingdom of Pundu Nagar.{{cn}} The second is that it was named for the five forts (or ''garhs'') in the region. The forts were  Bhitargarh, Hosaingarh, Mirgarh, Rajangarh and Devengarh. Hence, the name Panchagarh, meaning 'five forts'.{{cn}}\n\n==History==\nAfter the Partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, Panchagarh was a ''thana'' under the Thakurgaon ''mahakuma''. On 1 January 1980, it was established as a ''mahakuma'' consisting of 5 ''thanas'' named Tetulia, Panchagarh Sadar, Atwari, Boda and Debiganj.

The forts were  Bhitargarh, Hosaingarh, Mirgarh, Rajangarh and Devengarh. Hence, the name Panchagarh, meaning 'five forts'.{{cn}}\n\n==History==\nAfter the Partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, Panchagarh was a ''thana'' under the Thakurgaon ''mahakuma''. On 1 January 1980, it was established as a ''mahakuma'' consisting of 5 ''thanas'' named Tetulia, Panchagarh Sadar, Atwari, Boda and Debiganj.

When he refuses, she reveals her identity. As punishment for the prince's lack of compassion, the enchantress transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects, then erases the castle, himself and his servants from the memories of their loved ones and everyone else in the town. She casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that the spell will only be broken if he learns to love another, and earn their love in return before the last petal falls, or he will remain a beast forever.\n\nSome years later, in the small town of Villeneuve, Belle, the book-loving daughter of an inventor named Maurice, dreams of adventure. She constantly brushes off advances from Gaston, an arrogant former soldier, as he is not the type of man Belle wishes to marry. On Maurice's way to a convention and lost in the forest, he seeks refuge in the Beast's castle, but the Beast imprisons him for stealing a rose from his garden as a gift to Belle. When Maurice's horse returns without him, Belle ventures out in search for him, and finds him locked in the castle dungeon. Belle tricks both her father and the Beast by asking for a simple hug goodbye from her father, she pushes him out and locks herself in the dungeon. The Beast agrees to let her take her father's place and forces Maurice to leave immediately.\n\nBelle befriends the castle's servants, who invite her to a spectacular dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the Beast scares her into the woods. She is ambushed by a pack of wolves, but the Beast rescues her, becoming injured in the process. As Belle nurses his wounds, a spark develops between them. The Beast shows Belle a gift from the enchantress, a book that transports readers wherever they want. Belle uses the book to visit her childhood home in Paris, where she discovers a [[Plague doctor costume|plague doctor mask]] and realizes that she and her father were forced to leave when her mother succumbed to the [[Bubonic plague|plague]].\n\nIn Villeneuve, Maurice fails to convince the other villagers of the Beast and Belle's imprisonment. Gaston, seeing rescuing Belle as an opportunity to win her hand in marriage, agrees to help Maurice. When Maurice learns of his ulterior motive and rejects him, Gaston abandons him to be eaten by the wolves. Maurice is rescued by the town hermit Agathe, but when he tells the townsfolk of Gaston's crime and is unable to provide solid evidence, Gaston convinces them to send Maurice to an insane asylum.\n\nAfter sharing a romantic dance with the Beast, Belle discovers her father's predicament using a magic mirror. The Beast releases her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror to remember him with. At Villeneuve, Belle reveals the Beast in the mirror to the townsfolk, proving her father's sanity. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, a jealous Gaston claims she has been charmed by dark magic, and has her thrown into the asylum carriage with her father. He rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to slay the Beast before he curses the whole village. Inside the asylum carriage, Belle tells her father that she knows what happened to her mother and showed him the rose rattle she took from her magical visit to their old, abandoned home. Maurice and Belle escape, and Belle rushes back to the castle.\n\nDuring the battle, Gaston abandons his companion LeFou, who then sides with the servants to fend off the villagers. Gaston attacks the Beast in his tower, who is too depressed to fight back, but regains his spirit upon seeing Belle return. He defeats Gaston, but spares his life before reuniting with Belle. However, Gaston fatally shoots the Beast from a bridge, which then collapsed as the castle began to crumble, leading Gaston to fall to his death. The Beast then dies as the last petal falls, and the servants become inanimate. \n\nAs Belle tearfully professes her love to the Beast, Agathe reveals herself as the enchantress and undoes the curse, repairing the crumbling castle, and restoring the Beast and servants to their human forms and to the villagers' memories. The Prince and Belle host a ball for the kingdom, where they dance happily.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Emma Watson]] as [[Belle (Beauty and the Beast)|Belle]], a young benevolent [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]] who develops feelings for the Beast and begins to see the humanity within him.\n** Daisy Duczmal portrays an infant Belle. \n* [[Dan Stevens]] as [[Beast (Beauty and the Beast)|Beast]], a cold-hearted, selfish, unkind prince who is transformed into a beast and forced to earn back his humanity by learning to truly love and be loved in return, as well as to give rather than take.

on stilts for much of the film\". The facial capture for the Beast was done separately in order to \"communicate the subtleties of the human face\" and \"[capture the] thought that occurs to him\" which gets \"through [to] the eyes, which are the last human element in the Beast.\" The castle servants who are transformed into household objects were created with [[computer animation|CGI animation]].<ref name=\"Penske Business Media\"/>\n\nBefore the release of the film, Bill Condon refilmed one certain sequence in the \"Days of the Sun\" number, due to confusion among test audiences caused by actress Harriet Jones, who looked similar to [[Hattie Morahan]], who portrayed Agathe. In the original version of the scene, it was Jones's character, the Prince's mother, who sings the first verse of the song, with Rudi Goodman playing the young Prince and [[Henry Garrett (actor)|Henry Garrett]] playing his father; but in the re shot version of the scene, the singing part is given to the Prince (now played by Adam Mitchell). The King was also recast to Tom Turner, although Harriet Jones was still the Queen, albeit with dark hair.

In [[Bill Condon]]'s opinion, that original score was the key reason he agreed to direct a live-action version of the movie. \"That score had more to reveal\", he says, \"You look at the songs and there's not a clunker in the group. In fact, [[Frank Rich]] described it as the best Broadway musical of 1991. The animated version was already darker and more modern than the previous Disney fairy-tales. Take that vision, put it into a new medium, make it a radical reinvention, something not just for the stage because it's not just being literal, now other elements come into play.

She casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that the spell will only be broken if he learns to love another, and earn their love in return before the last petal falls, or he will remain a beast forever.\n\nSome years later, in the small town of Villeneuve, Belle, the book-loving daughter of an inventor named Maurice, dreams of adventure. She constantly brushes off advances from Gaston, an arrogant former soldier, as he is not the type of man Belle wishes to marry. On Maurice's way to a convention and lost in the forest, he seeks refuge in the Beast's castle, but the Beast imprisons him for stealing a rose from his garden as a gift to Belle. When Maurice's horse returns without him, Belle ventures out in search for him, and finds him locked in the castle dungeon. Belle tricks both her father and the Beast by asking for a simple hug goodbye from her father, she pushes him out and locks herself in the dungeon. The Beast agrees to let her take her father's place and forces Maurice to leave immediately.\n\nBelle befriends the castle's servants, who invite her to a spectacular dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the Beast scares her into the woods. She is ambushed by a pack of wolves, but the Beast rescues her, becoming injured in the process. As Belle nurses his wounds, a spark develops between them. The Beast shows Belle a gift from the enchantress, a book that transports readers wherever they want. Belle uses the book to visit her childhood home in Paris, where she discovers a [[Plague doctor costume|plague doctor mask]] and realizes that she and her father were forced to leave when her mother succumbed to the [[Bubonic plague|plague]].\n\nIn Villeneuve, Maurice fails to convince the other villagers of the Beast and Belle's imprisonment. Gaston, seeing rescuing Belle as an opportunity to win her hand in marriage, agrees to help Maurice. When Maurice learns of his ulterior motive and rejects him, Gaston abandons him to be eaten by the wolves. Maurice is rescued by the town hermit Agathe, but when he tells the townsfolk of Gaston's crime and is unable to provide solid evidence, Gaston convinces them to send Maurice to an insane asylum.\n\nAfter sharing a romantic dance with the Beast, Belle discovers her father's predicament using a magic mirror. The Beast releases her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror to remember him with. At Villeneuve, Belle reveals the Beast in the mirror to the townsfolk, proving her father's sanity. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, a jealous Gaston claims she has been charmed by dark magic, and has her thrown into the asylum carriage with her father. He rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to slay the Beast before he curses the whole village. Inside the asylum carriage, Belle tells her father that she knows what happened to her mother and showed him the rose rattle she took from her magical visit to their old, abandoned home. Maurice and Belle escape, and Belle rushes back to the castle.\n\nDuring the battle, Gaston abandons his companion LeFou, who then sides with the servants to fend off the villagers. Gaston attacks the Beast in his tower, who is too depressed to fight back, but regains his spirit upon seeing Belle return. He defeats Gaston, but spares his life before reuniting with Belle. However, Gaston fatally shoots the Beast from a bridge, which then collapsed as the castle began to crumble, leading Gaston to fall to his death. The Beast then dies as the last petal falls, and the servants become inanimate. \n\nAs Belle tearfully professes her love to the Beast, Agathe reveals herself as the enchantress and undoes the curse, repairing the crumbling castle, and restoring the Beast and servants to their human forms and to the villagers' memories. The Prince and Belle host a ball for the kingdom, where they dance happily.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Emma Watson]] as [[Belle (Beauty and the Beast)|Belle]], a young benevolent [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]] who develops feelings for the Beast and begins to see the humanity within him.\n** Daisy Duczmal portrays an infant Belle. \n* [[Dan Stevens]] as [[Beast (Beauty and the Beast)|Beast]], a cold-hearted, selfish, unkind prince who is transformed into a beast and forced to earn back his humanity by learning to truly love and be loved in return, as well as to give rather than take.

on stilts for much of the film\". The facial capture for the Beast was done separately in order to \"communicate the subtleties of the human face\" and \"[capture the] thought that occurs to him\" which gets \"through [to] the eyes, which are the last human element in the Beast.\" The castle servants who are transformed into household objects were created with [[computer animation|CGI animation]].<ref name=\"Penske Business Media\"/>\n\nBefore the release of the film, Bill Condon refilmed one certain sequence in the \"Days of the Sun\" number, due to confusion among test audiences caused by actress Harriet Jones, who looked similar to [[Hattie Morahan]], who portrayed Agathe. In the original version of the scene, it was Jones's character, the Prince's mother, who sings the first verse of the song, with Rudi Goodman playing the young Prince and [[Henry Garrett (actor)|Henry Garrett]] playing his father; but in the reshot version of the scene, the singing part is given to the Prince (now played by Adam Mitchell). The King was also recast to Tom Turner, although Harriet Jones was still the Queen, albeit with dark hair.

In [[Bill Condon]]'s opinion, that original score was the key reason he agreed to direct a live-action version of the movie. \"That score had more to reveal\", he says, \"You look at the songs and there's not a clunker in the group. In fact, [[Frank Rich]] described it as the best Broadway musical of 1991. The animated version was already darker and more modern than the previous Disney fairy-tales. Take that vision, put it into a new medium, make it a radical reinvention, something not just for the stage because it's not just being literal, now other elements come into play.

One analysis, that of {{Harvcoltxt|Thompson|1965}} has them as being phonemes {{IPA|/c, \u0272/}}, where {{IPA|/c/}} contrasts with both syllable-final ''t'' {{IPA|/t/}} and ''c'' {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0272/}} contrasts with syllable-final ''n'' {{IPA|/n/}} and ''ng'' {{IPA|/\u014b/}}. Final {{IPA|/c, \u0272/}} is, then, identified with syllable-initial {{IPA|/c, \u0272/}}.\n\nAnother analysis has final {{angbr|ch}} and {{angbr|nh}} as representing predictable [[allophonic]] variants of the velar phonemes {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b/}} that occur after upper front vowels {{IPA|/i/}} (orthographic {{angbr|i}}) and {{IPA|/e/}} (orthographic {{angbr|\u00ea}}). This analysis interprets orthographic \u27e8ach\u27e9 and \u27e8anh\u27e9 as an underlying {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, which becomes phonetically open and diphthongized: {{IPA|/\u025bk/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0103jk\u031f\u031a]}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u014b/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0103j\u014b\u031f]}}.<ref>Although there are some words where orthographic {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|ng}} occur after {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, these words are few and are mostly loanwords or [[onomatopoeia]]</ref> This diphthongization also affects \u27e8\u00each\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00eanh\u27e9: {{IPA|/ek/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306jk\u031f\u031a]}}, {{IPA|/e\u014b/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306j\u014b\u031f]}}.\n\nArguments for the second analysis include the limited distribution of final {{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[\u0272]}}, the gap in the distribution of {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[\u014b]}} which do not occur after {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[e]}}, the pronunciation of \u27e8ach\u27e9 and \u27e8anh\u27e9 as {{IPA|[\u025bc]}} and {{IPA|[\u025b\u0272]}} in certain conservative central dialects,<ref name=\"rhyme\"/> and the patterning of {{IPA|[k]}}~{{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[\u014b]}}~{{IPA|[\u0272]}} in certain reduplicated words. Additionally, final {{IPA|[c]}} is not articulated as far forward as the initial {{IPA|[c]}}: {{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[\u0272]}} are pre-velar {{IPA|[k\u031f, \u014b\u031f]}} with no alveolar contact.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Kirby|2011|p=383}}</ref>\n\nThe first analysis closely follows the surface pronunciation of a slightly different Hanoi dialect than the second. In this dialect, the {{IPA|/a/}} in {{IPA|/ac/}} and {{IPA|/a\u0272/}} is not diphthongized but is actually articulated more forward, approaching a front vowel {{IPA|[\u00e6]}}.

Tones differ in\n\n* pitch\n* length\n* contour melody\n* intensity\n* [[phonation]] (with or without accompanying constricted vocal cords)\n\nUnlike many Native American, African, and Chinese languages, Vietnamese tones do not rely solely on [[pitch contour]]. Vietnamese often uses instead a [[register complex]] (which is a combination of phonation type, pitch, length, vowel quality, etc.). So perhaps a better description would be that Vietnamese is a register language and not a \"pure\" tonal language.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ph\u1ea1m|2003|p=93}}</ref>\n\nIn Vietnamese orthography, tone is indicated by diacritics written above or below the vowel.\n\n===Six-tone analysis===\n\nThere is much variation among speakers concerning how tone is realized phonetically. There are differences between varieties of Vietnamese spoken in the major geographic areas (northern, central, southern) and smaller differences within the major areas (e.g. Hanoi vs. other northern varieties). In addition, there seems to be variation among individuals. More research is needed to determine the remaining details of tone realization and the variation among speakers.\n\n====Northern varieties====\n\nThe six tones in the Hanoi and other northern varieties are:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"level\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"high (or mid) level\".\n\n'''Huy\u1ec1n tone:'''\n\n*The ''huy\u1ec1n'' tone starts low-mid and falls (21). Some Hanoi speakers start at a somewhat higher point (31). It is sometimes accompanied by [[breathy voice]] (or lax) phonation in some speakers, but this is lacking in other speakers: ''b\u00e0'' = {{IPA|[\u0253a\u02e8\u02e9]}}.<ref>For example, {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|Edmondson|1998}} show a male speaker from [[Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh Province|Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh]] with [[lax voice]] and a female speaker from Hanoi with breathy voice for the ''huy\u1ec1n'' tone while another male speaker from Hanoi has modal voice for the ''huy\u1ec1n''.</ref> Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"grave-lowering\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"low falling\".\n\n'''H\u1ecfi tone:'''\n\n* The ''h\u1ecfi'' tone starts a mid level and falls. It starts with modal voice phonation, which moves increasingly toward [[tense voice]] with accompanying [[harsh voice]] (although the harsh voice seems to vary according to speaker). In Hanoi, the tone is mid falling (31). In other northern speakers, the tone is mid falling and then rises back to the mid level (313 or 323). This characteristic gives this tone its traditional description as \"dipping\". However, the falling-rising contour is most obvious in citation forms or when syllable-final; in other positions and when in fast speech, the rising contour is negligible. The ''h\u1ecfi'' also is relatively short compared with the other tones, but not as short as the ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"smooth-rising\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"dipping-rising\".\n\n'''Ng\u00e3 tone:'''\n\n* The ''ng\u00e3'' tone is mid rising (35). Many speakers begin the vowel with modal voice, followed by strong [[creaky voice]] starting toward the middle of the vowel, which is then lessening as the end of the syllable is approached. Some speakers with more dramatic glottalization have a [[glottal stop]] closure in the middle of the vowel (i.e. as {{IPA|[V\u0294V]}}). In Hanoi Vietnamese, the tone starts at a higher pitch (45) than other northern speakers. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"chesty-raised\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"creaking-rising\".\n\n'''S\u1eafc tone:'''\n\n*The ''s\u1eafc'' tone starts as mid and then rises (35) in much the same way as the ''ng\u00e3'' tone. It is accompanied by [[tense voice]] phonation throughout the duration of the vowel. In some Hanoi speakers, the ''ng\u00e3'' tone is noticeably higher than the ''s\u1eafc'' tone, for example: ''s\u1eafc'' = {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e6}} (34); ''ng\u00e3'' = {{IPA|\u02e6\u02c0\u02e5}} (45). Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"acute-angry\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"high (or mid) rising\".\n\n'''N\u1eb7ng tone:'''\n\n* The ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone starts mid or low-mid and rapidly falls in pitch (32 or 21). It starts with tense voice that becomes increasingly tense until the vowel ends in a glottal stop closure. This tone is noticeably shorter than the other tones. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"chesty-heavy\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"constricted\".\n\n====Southern varieties====\n{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n![[Tone name]]\n!

In [[Middle Chinese]], syllables ending in a vowel or nasal allowed for three tonal distinctions, but syllables ending with {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/k/}} had no tonal distinctions.  Rather, they were consistently pronounced with a short high tone, which was called the [[entering tone]] and considered a fourth tone. Similar considerations lead to the identification of two additional tones in Vietnamese for syllables ending in {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/c/}} and {{IPA|/k/}}.  These are not [[phoneme|phonemically]] distinct from the ''s\u1eafc'' and ''n\u1eb7ng'' tones, however, and hence not considered as separate tones by modern linguists and are not distinguished in the orthography.\n\n==Syllables and phonotactics==\nAccording to {{Harvcoltxt|Hannas|1997}}, there are 4,500 to 4,800 possible spoken syllables (depending on dialect), and the standard national orthography (''[[Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef]]'') can represent 6,200 syllables (''Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef'' orthography represents more phonemic distinctions than are made by any one dialect).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hannas|1997|p=88}}</ref> A description of syllable structure and exploration of its patterning according to the Prosodic Analysis approach of J.R.

His vowels above are only the basic vowel phonemes. Thompson gives a very detailed description of each vowel's various allophonic realizations.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Han|1966}} uses acoustic analysis, including [[spectrogram]]s and [[formant]] measuring and plotting, to describe the vowels. She states that the primary difference between orthographic ''\u01a1'' & ''\u00e2'' and ''a'' & ''\u0103'' is a difference of length (a ratio of 2:1).

He says that his work is not a \"complete grammar\" but rather a \"descriptive introduction.\"  So, his chart above is more a phonological vowel chart rather than a phonetic one.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*Alves, Mark J. 2007. \"A Look At North-Central Vietnamese.\" In ''SEALS XII Papers from the 12th Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society 2002'', edited by Ratree Wayland et al..

One analysis, that of {{Harvcoltxt|Thompson|1965}} has them as being phonemes {{IPA|/c, \u0272/}}, where {{IPA|/c/}} contrasts with both syllable-final ''t'' {{IPA|/t/}} and ''c'' {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0272/}} contrasts with syllable-final ''n'' {{IPA|/n/}} and ''ng'' {{IPA|/\u014b/}}. Final {{IPA|/c, \u0272/}} is, then, identified with syllable-initial {{IPA|/c, \u0272/}}.\n\nAnother analysis has final {{angbr|ch}} and {{angbr|nh}} as representing predictable [[allophonic]] variants of the velar phonemes {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b/}} that occur after upper front vowels {{IPA|/i/}} (orthographic {{angbr|i}}) and {{IPA|/e/}} (orthographic {{angbr|\u00ea}}). This analysis interprets orthographic \u27e8ach\u27e9 and \u27e8anh\u27e9 as an underlying {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, which becomes phonetically open and diphthongized: {{IPA|/\u025bk/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0103jk\u031f\u031a]}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u014b/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0103j\u014b\u031f]}}.<ref>Although there are some words where orthographic {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|ng}} occur after {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, these words are few and are mostly loanwords or [[onomatopoeia]]</ref> This diphthongization also affects \u27e8\u00each\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00eanh\u27e9: {{IPA|/ek/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306jk\u031f\u031a]}}, {{IPA|/e\u014b/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306j\u014b\u031f]}}.\n\nArguments for the second analysis include the limited distribution of final {{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[\u0272]}}, the gap in the distribution of {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[\u014b]}} which do not occur after {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[e]}}, the pronunciation of \u27e8ach\u27e9 and \u27e8anh\u27e9 as {{IPA|[\u025bc]}} and {{IPA|[\u025b\u0272]}} in certain conservative central dialects,<ref name=\"rhyme\"/> and the patterning of {{IPA|[k]}}~{{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[\u014b]}}~{{IPA|[\u0272]}} in certain reduplicated words. Additionally, final {{IPA|[c]}} is not articulated as far forward as the initial {{IPA|[c]}}: {{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[\u0272]}} are pre-velar {{IPA|[k\u031f, \u014b\u031f]}} with no alveolar contact.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Kirby|2011|p=383}}</ref>\n\nThe first analysis closely follows the surface pronunciation of a slightly different Hanoi dialect than the second. In this dialect, the {{IPA|/a/}} in {{IPA|/ac/}} and {{IPA|/a\u0272/}} is not diphthongized but is actually articulated more forward, approaching a front vowel {{IPA|[\u00e6]}}.

Tones differ in\n\n* pitch\n* length\n* contour melody\n* intensity\n* [[phonation]] (with or without accompanying constricted vocal cords)\n\nUnlike many Native American, African, and Chinese languages, Vietnamese tones do not rely solely on [[pitch contour]]. Vietnamese often uses instead a [[register complex]] (which is a combination of phonation type, pitch, length, vowel quality, etc.). So perhaps a better description would be that Vietnamese is a register language and not a \"pure\" tonal language.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ph\u1ea1m|2003|p=93}}</ref>\n\nIn Vietnamese orthography, tone is indicated by diacritics written above or below the vowel.\n\n===Six-tone analysis===\n\nThere is much variation among speakers concerning how tone is realized phonetically. There are differences between varieties of Vietnamese spoken in the major geographic areas (northern, central, southern) and smaller differences within the major areas (e.g. Hanoi vs. other northern varieties). In addition, there seems to be variation among individuals. More research is needed to determine the remaining details of tone realization and the variation among speakers.\n\n====Northern varieties====\n\nThe six tones in the Hanoi and other northern varieties are:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"level\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"high (or mid) level\".\n\n'''Huy\u1ec1n tone:'''\n\n*The ''huy\u1ec1n'' tone starts low-mid and falls (21). Some Hanoi speakers start at a somewhat higher point (31). It is sometimes accompanied by [[breathy voice]] (or lax) phonation in some speakers, but this is lacking in other speakers: ''b\u00e0'' = {{IPA|[\u0253a\u02e8\u02e9]}}.<ref>For example, {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|Edmondson|1998}} show a male speaker from [[Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh Province|Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh]] with [[lax voice]] and a female speaker from Hanoi with breathy voice for the ''huy\u1ec1n'' tone while another male speaker from Hanoi has modal voice for the ''huy\u1ec1n''.</ref> Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"grave-lowering\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"low falling\".\n\n'''H\u1ecfi tone:'''\n\n* The ''h\u1ecfi'' tone starts a mid level and falls. It starts with modal voice phonation, which moves increasingly toward [[tense voice]] with accompanying [[harsh voice]] (although the harsh voice seems to vary according to speaker). In Hanoi, the tone is mid falling (31). In other northern speakers, the tone is mid falling and then rises back to the mid level (313 or 323). This characteristic gives this tone its traditional description as \"dipping\". However, the falling-rising contour is most obvious in citation forms or when syllable-final; in other positions and when in fast speech, the rising contour is negligible. The ''h\u1ecfi'' also is relatively short compared with the other tones, but not as short as the ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"smooth-rising\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"dipping-rising\".\n\n'''Ng\u00e3 tone:'''\n\n* The ''ng\u00e3'' tone is mid rising (35). Many speakers begin the vowel with modal voice, followed by strong [[creaky voice]] starting toward the middle of the vowel, which is then lessening as the end of the syllable is approached. Some speakers with more dramatic glottalization have a [[glottal stop]] closure in the middle of the vowel (i.e. as {{IPA|[V\u0294V]}}). In Hanoi Vietnamese, the tone starts at a higher pitch (45) than other northern speakers. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"chesty-raised\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"creaking-rising\".\n\n'''S\u1eafc tone:'''\n\n*The ''s\u1eafc'' tone starts as mid and then rises (35) in much the same way as the ''ng\u00e3'' tone. It is accompanied by [[tense voice]] phonation throughout the duration of the vowel. In some Hanoi speakers, the ''ng\u00e3'' tone is noticeably higher than the ''s\u1eafc'' tone, for example: ''s\u1eafc'' = {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e6}} (34); ''ng\u00e3'' = {{IPA|\u02e6\u02c0\u02e5}} (45). Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"acute-angry\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"high (or mid) rising\".\n\n'''N\u1eb7ng tone:'''\n\n* The ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone starts mid or low-mid and rapidly falls in pitch (32 or 21). It starts with tense voice that becomes increasingly tense until the vowel ends in a glottal stop closure. This tone is noticeably shorter than the other tones. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"chesty-heavy\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"constricted\".\n\n====Southern varieties====\n{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n![[Tone name]]\n!

In [[Middle Chinese]], syllables ending in a vowel or nasal allowed for three tonal distinctions, but syllables ending with {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/k/}} had no tonal distinctions.  Rather, they were consistently pronounced with a short high tone, which was called the [[entering tone]] and considered a fourth tone. Similar considerations lead to the identification of two additional tones in Vietnamese for syllables ending in {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/c/}} and {{IPA|/k/}}.  These are not [[phoneme|phonemically]] distinct from the ''s\u1eafc'' and ''n\u1eb7ng'' tones, however, and hence not considered as separate tones by modern linguists and are not distinguished in the orthography.\n\n==Syllables and phonotactics==\nAccording to {{Harvcoltxt|Hannas|1997}}, there are 4,500 to 4,800 possible spoken syllables (depending on dialect), and the standard national orthography (''[[Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef]]'') can represent 6,200 syllables (''Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef'' orthography represents more phonemic distinctions than are made by any one dialect).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hannas|1997|p=88}}</ref> A description of syllable structure and exploration of its patterning according to the Prosodic Analysis approach of J.R.

His vowels above are only the basic vowel phonemes. Thompson gives a very detailed description of each vowel's various allophonic realizations.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Han|1966}} uses acoustic analysis, including [[spectrogram]]s and [[formant]] measuring and plotting, to describe the vowels. She states that the primary difference between orthographic ''\u01a1'' & ''\u00e2'' and ''a'' & ''\u0103'' is a difference of length (a ratio of 2:1).

It is named after the [[Russian language|Russian]] term for the [[Dnieper]] river islet of today's [[Khortytsia|Seredny Stih]], [[Ukraine]], where it was first located. \n\n==Distribution==\nThe Sredny Stog culture was situated across the Dnieper river on both its shores, with sporadic settlements to the west and east.<ref>J. P. Mallory, ''In the search of Indo-Europeans'', 1989 p. 198, Distribution of the Sredny Stog and Novodanilovka sites</ref> \n\nThe Sredny Stog culture seems to have had contact with the agricultural [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]] in the west and was a contemporary of the [[Khvalynsk culture]]. \n\n==Sites==\nOne of the best known sites associated with this culture is [[Dereivka]], located on the right bank of the Omelnik, a tributary of the Dnieper, and is the most impressive site within the Sredny Stog culture complex, being about 2,000 square meters in area.\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe Sredny Stog culture is known for initiating the domestication of horses.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Ancestral DNA, Human Origins, and Migrations|last=Herrera|first=Rene J.|last2=Garcia-Bertrand|first2=Ralph|date=2018|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780128041246|location=London|pages=518}}</ref>\n\nThe Sredny Stog people are distinguished from the other cultures found in the Balkans by the way they lived more mobile lives. This was seen in their temporary settlements, particularly their dwellings, which were simple rectilinear structures.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Balkan Prehistory: Exclusion, Incorporation and Identity|last=Bailey|first=Douglass|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415215978|location=London|pages=258|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe expert [[Dmytro Telegin]] has divided the chronology of Sredny Stog into two distinct phases. Phase II (ca. 4000\u20133500 BC) used [[Corded Ware culture|corded ware pottery]] which may have originated there, and stone battle-axes of the type later associated with expanding Indo-European cultures to the West. Most notably, it has perhaps the earliest evidence of [[horse domestication]] (in phase II), with finds suggestive of cheek-pieces ([[psalia]]). Evidence revealed that around 6,000ya, the culture has domesticated the wild Przewalski's horse.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, there is no conclusive proof that that horses were used for riding since they were mainly employed for gathering food.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction, Second Edition|last=Fortson IV|first=Benjamin|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781405188951|location=Malden, MA|pages=48}}</ref>\n\n==Burials==\nIn its three largest cemeteries, Alexandria (39 individuals), Igren (17) and Dereivka (14), evidence of [[inhumation]] in flat graves (ground level pits) has been found.<ref>''The Journal of Indo-European studies'', Vol 18, p. 18</ref> This parallels the practise of the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture, and is in contrast with the later [[Yamna culture]], which practiced [[Tumulus|tumuli]] burials, according to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]]. \n\nIn Sredny Stog culture, the deceased were laid to rest on their backs with the legs flexed. The use of [[ochre]] in the burial was practiced, as with the kurgan cultures.

Phase II (ca. 4000\u20133500 BC) used [[Corded Ware culture|corded ware pottery]] which may have originated there, and stone battle-axes of the type later associated with expanding Indo-European cultures to the West. Most notably, it has perhaps the earliest evidence of [[horse domestication]] (in phase II), with finds suggestive of cheek-pieces ([[psalia]]).

The use of [[ochre]] in the burial was practiced, as with the kurgan cultures.

The alphanumeric marks (or \"registration numbers\") themselves are issued by the [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] in which a vehicle is first registered.\n\n==Format and specifications==\n[[File:Revised format Republic of Ireland numberplate (2013-).svg|thumb|250px|Example of Irish number plate since 2013. Port L\u00e1irge indicates the vehicle is registered to Waterford City, County Waterford]]\n[[File:Irish plate specification.png|thumb|250px|Illustration of Irish number plate specifications (1987\u20132012)]]\nThe current specification for number plates is the format YYY\u2013CC\u2013SSSSSS. Those issued from 1987 to 2012 had the format YY\u2013CC\u2013SSSSSS. The components are:\n\n* YYY \u2013 a three-digit year (e.g. 131 for January to June 2013; 132 for July to December 2013) based on date of first registration and not necessarily agreeing with the official model year of the car as referenced by the eleventh VIN digit<ref name=II_2013_number_plates>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/2013-number-plates-to-be-changed-to-avoid-unlucky-13-3208978.html|title=2013 number plates to be changed to avoid 'unlucky 13'|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=24 August 2012|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref>\n** YY from 1987\u20132012 \u2013 a two-digit year (e.g. 87 for 1987; 05 for 2005)\n* CC \u2013 a one- or two-character [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|county/city]] identifier (e.g. L for [[Limerick City and County Council|Limerick City and County]]; SO for [[County Sligo]]).\n* SSSSSS \u2013 a one- to six-digit sequence number, starting with the first vehicle registered in the county/city that year/period.\n\nSince 1991, the design of the standard Irish number plate has been based on [[Vehicle registration plates of Europe|European standard]] guidelines, with a blue vertical band to the left of the plate containing the twelve stars of the [[Flag of Europe]], below which is the [[List of international vehicle registration codes|country identifier]] for Ireland: IRL. The rest of the plate has a white background with black characters. There are usually two hyphens; between the year and county code, and between the county code and sequence number. Also required on vehicles registered is the full [[Irish language]] name of the county/city which must be positioned above the identifier.<ref name=si_1999/>\n\nThe current regulations are set out in the Vehicle Registration and Taxation (Amendment) Regulations, 1999,<ref name=si_1999>http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1999/en/si/0432.html</ref> as amended by the Vehicle Registration and Taxation (Amendment) Regulations 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/si/0542.html|title=S.I. No. 542/2012 - Vehicle Registration and Taxation (Amendment) Regulations 2012.|date=20 December 2012|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref> These prescribe the format, dimensions and technical specifications of registration plates to be displayed on vehicles. They substitute the First Schedule of the Vehicle Registration and Taxation Regulations, 1992<ref>http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/si/0318.html</ref> to allow additional characters to be displayed on the registration plate and to ensure that these are displayed in the correct position and proportion. The changes were necessary to cater for increases in the number of car registrations.\n\nUnlike legal requirements in all other European countries, a standard uniform character font is not required. The rules simply require legible black [[sans serif]] characters, no more than 70&nbsp;mm high and 36&nbsp;mm wide with a stroke width of 10&nbsp;mm, on a white reflective background. The result is that a large variety of perfectly legal font styles may be seen, on either pressed aluminium or acrylic plates, both of which are allowed.<ref name=si_1999/> Despite the rather relaxed lack of a specified font, the hyphen between the lettering must lie between the minimum dimensions of 13mm x 10mm or the maximum dimension of 22mm x 10mm. Vehicle owners may be fined if the plate's format does not meet the requirements, and the vehicle will fail the mandatory periodic [[National Car Test]].<ref>{{cite book|chapterurl=http://www.ncts.ie/NCT%20Manual%20Revise%20May%202012.pdf#page=8|chapter=Registration Plates|isbn=9781406424911|title=National Car Test Manual|date=May 2012|author=[[Road Safety Authority]]|page=8|accessdate=26 September 2013|publisher=Government Publications Office|url-status=dead|url=http://www.ncts.ie/NCT%20Manual%20Revise%20May%202012.pdf#page=8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928063435/http://www.ncts.ie/NCT%20Manual%20Revise%20May%202012.pdf#page=8|archivedate=28 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA vehicle's number plate is determined when it is first registered, the county/city code being taken from the first owner's postal address. Registration remains fixed on the one vehicle until it is de-registered (exported, destroyed, etc.), and cannot be transferred to other vehicles.\n\n==Current implementation==\n[[File:Irish Vehicle Registration Plate.svg|thumb|250px|Example of Dublin number plate from 1999 (1987\u20132012)]]\n[[File:Mansion House with car.jpg|thumb|The [[Mansion House, Dublin]] with the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]]'s official car, with 191-D-1 plate.]]\nSequence numbers may be reserved on completion of form VRT15A and payment of \u20ac1,000.\n\n* Most registration numbers can be reserved, with the exception of the first number of each year issued in Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford as these are reserved for the respective mayor/lord mayor of these cities.<ref>{{cite web |title=How to Reserve a Registration Number |url=http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/leaflets/reserve-reg-number.html |publisher=[[Revenue Commissioners]] }}</ref>\nThus, for example, in the year 2008, Lord Mayor Cllr. Paddy Bourke, the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]], was entitled to receive the registration plate <kbd>08-D-1</kbd> on his official vehicle.\n* Luxury cars with numeric names are often registered with a matching, usually pre-reserved sequence number: for example <kbd>06-D-911</kbd> on a [[Porsche 911]] or <kbd>06-D-750</kbd> [[BMW 7 Series|BMW 750]] and <kbd>08-D-89</kbd> for an [[Aston Martin DB9]].\n* Dublin radio station [[FM104]] tend to register their vehicles with reserved number sequences ending with \"104\", e.g. <kbd>05-D-38104</kbd>.\n\nThere are only two pre-1987 codes still issued in Ireland.\n* \"ZZ\", administered by the [[AA Ireland]] as agents for the Revenue Commissioners, is given to registrants who are based outside the state and who only intend keeping the vehicle within the [[Republic of Ireland]] for a period not exceeding one month. This form of temporary registration is usually used for vehicles that are purchased within the Republic of Ireland but exported by its new owner to another [[sovereign state]] directly after purchase. The format of the code is ZZ followed by a five digit number.\n* \"ZV\", which can be selected as an alternative to the current scheme when registering a vehicle older than 30 years for the first time in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n==Special formats==\nImported [[used car]]s are registered based on year of first registration in their country of original registration rather than year of import.  Each county had continuous sequence numbers for vehicles so if a new car registered on 31 December 2010 was 10 D 37456, then the next registered car from 2010 registered in 2011 would be 10 D 37457.  This changed in late 2011 when each county (prior to 2010) had their next available sequence number increased dramatically for no particular reason other than being easily identified as an \"import\".  For example, 10-D-120006 would be the 6th import in Dublin of a car from 2010, as Dublin's re-registration band starts at 120000.  Meath's starts at 15000.\n\nVehicles registered to the [[Irish Defence Forces]] have plates with silver letters on black background.  These do not feature the Irish-language county name.\n\nTrade plates have plates with white letters on dark green background.\n\nDiplomatic plates are very similar to civilian format, except the small \"CD\" between index mark code and serial number.\n\n==Index mark codes==\n[[File:Irish car reg map.jpg|thumb|Map of Ireland showing the area codes used on vehicle registration plates]]\nThe city codes are a single letter, the initial letter of its English-language name. Most county codes use the first and last letters of the name [[Counties of Ireland|county]]. For example, '''S'''lig'''o''' is SO. The exception to this is the \"D\" code which is used for [[County Dublin]] which is co-extensive with and is in use for the counties of [[Fingal]], [[South Dublin]] and [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]] and [[Dublin]] city. Other exceptions are:\n* Where the county shares its registration function with the city of the same name, in which case both use the single-letter code. An example of this is [[County Cork]], which shares the same name with [[Cork (city)|Cork City]], and takes the code \"C\".\n* Where a conflict exists, i.e. '''K'''err'''y''' is KY, so '''K'''il'''k'''enny is KK; and County '''W'''aterfor'''d''' was (until 2014) WD, so '''W'''e'''x'''ford is WX.\n*County '''T'''ipperary is T. This is because the county was, until 2014, divided into North (TN) and South (TS).\nThe codes are similar to the [[ISO 3166-2:IE|ISO 3166-2 codes for Irish counties]].

This was superseded in the Republic of Ireland on 1 January 1987.\n\nA two-letter code containing the letter I was allocated to each administrative county in alphabetical order (the full list appears below), with the initial registration format being the code followed by a sequence number from 1 to 9999, as in Great Britain. The codes allocated ran from <kbd>IA</kbd> to <kbd>IZ</kbd>, then from <kbd>AI</kbd> to <kbd>WI</kbd>, with the letters G, S, and V skipped as these were intended for [[Scotland]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fleetdata.co.uk/allocations.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420032442/http://www.fleetdata.co.uk/allocations.html |archivedate=20 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 1921, shortly before the creation of the [[Irish Free State]], [[Belfast]] and [[Dublin|Dublin City]] completed their original marks and thus took the next available codes, <kbd>XI</kbd> and <kbd>YI</kbd> respectively, with Dublin City then taking <kbd>ZI</kbd> in 1927. After this, most other codes with Z as the first letter (again skipping those containing G, S and V) were allocated in alphabetical order, starting with single-letter <kbd>Z</kbd> \u2013 the only one-letter code used in Ireland \u2013 for [[County Dublin]]. (This does not include the <kbd>ZZ</kbd> code for temporary imports, introduced in 1925.)\n\nIn February 1952, a joint motor taxation authority was set up for Dublin City and county, and their codes were merged. Two years later, with all possible codes (at the time) allocated, a new format was introduced with a serial letter added before the code, and the sequence number running only to 999 (thus limiting the number of characters on a number plate to six). The Dublin joint authority was the first to adopt this format when it issued <kbd>ARI&nbsp;1</kbd> in May 1954, and each county followed suit once all its two-letter combinations had been issued. In the case of counties with more than one code, all the three-letter marks for the first allocated code would be issued, then all such marks for the second code, and so on (see the lists of series per county below).\n\nG, S and V were not used as serial letters at first, while Z was not used before a code starting with that letter, so as to prevent any clashing with <kbd>ZZ</kbd> temporary registrations. Several other three-letter marks were not issued through oversight or because they were deemed offensive, and the single-letter Z code was left out of this format as a serial letter would have created a duplicate of an existing two-letter code, particularly one used in [[Northern Ireland]].\n\nInitially, all number plates had been black with white or silver characters, but in 1969 the option of black-on-white at the front and black-on-red at the rear was introduced.\n\n[[File:780_FZL_(license_plate).png|thumb|250px|Graphic example of pre-1987 standard rear Irish number plate for [[County Dublin]]]]\nIn February 1970, the Dublin joint authority exhausted all its three-letter combinations and thus began issuing \"reversed\" registrations, starting with the original two-letter codes (plus single-letter Z) in order of allocation. These were followed from July 1974 onwards by the three-letter marks (<kbd>1&nbsp;ARI</kbd> etc.), issued in the same manner as for the forward versions. Again, other counties followed this example over time. Also in 1974, Cork followed Dublin's example of setting up a joint motor taxation authority for [[Cork (city)|city]] and [[County Cork|county]], though their codes were not merged until August 1985.\n\nIn 1982, with Dublin and several other counties having exhausted all possible combinations of their original codes, it was decided to allocate the skipped codes containing G, S and V to these counties. In the cases of these codes, the forward three-letter combinations were issued first in the same manner as before, followed by the forward two-letter combinations.\n\nUnder this system, Irish vehicle registration marks could be transferred to Britain for re-registration on other vehicles, even after Irish independence, and even though they could not be re-used within Ireland.  The letter I in many combinations made these attractive for collectors, and indeed the [[Kilkenny]] issue <kbd>VIP&nbsp;1</kbd> has fetched a record price at auction.  Since the introduction of the current system in 1987, such exports have been impossible, even for old-format registrations, although those already exported may still be re-transferred. \n\nThe 1987 system allocated single-letter codes to the [[county borough]]s (including those shared with counties) and two-letter codes to the other counties.  Normally these are the initial and final letter of the English-language name of the county (except where duplicates would result). Until 1991, all plates under this system consisted solely of black characters on white, on both front and rear. However, in that year, the blue EU identifier and the official [[Irish language]] name of the county were added, the latter as a result of the controversy arising from using English as the basis, described by [[Conradh na Gaeilge]], an  organisation which promotes the Irish language in Ireland and worldwide, as \"a fiasco\".<ref>[https://cnag.ie/en/news/290-irish-postcodes-should-be-irish-based.html Irish Postcodes Should Be Irish-Based], [[Conradh na Gaeilge]], 11 November 2008</ref> \n\nVehicles first registered outside the state before 1987 are allowed to be re-registered using only the current system, with a year number preceding 87 \u2013 for instance, a vehicle from 1964 re-registered in [[County Meath|Meath]] would have <kbd>64-MH</kbd> at the start of its registration.\n\nIn 2013, the year was changed to a 3-digit year with the third digit being 1 for January to June and 2 for July to December, for example, 131 for January\u2013June 2013 and 132 for July\u2013December 2013.<ref name=II_2013_number_plates/> The decision to change the year was based partly on superstition about an unlucky '13' registration, but also to boost sales in the second half of the year.<ref>[http://www.thejournal.ie/number-13-licence-plates-michael-healy-rae-571256-Aug2012/ Healy-Rae vindicated as 2013 licence plates to avoid 'unlucky 13'], ''[[TheJournal.ie]]'', August 25th 2012</ref>\n\n==Pre-1987 mark codes==\n\nThe first codes were allocated in 1903, when all of [[Ireland]] was still part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The codes were based on the alphabetical order of counties and county boroughs (cities) as they were named at the time. [[County Offaly|King's County]] and [[County Laois|Queen's County]] were renamed Offaly and Laois respectively following the independence of most of Ireland as the [[Irish Free State]]. Counties and county boroughs in italics are in [[Northern Ireland]] and still use the 1903 system.\n\nCodes with the letters G, S and V were reserved until the 1980s, when they were taken by counties that had exhausted all the combinations for their original codes.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!letter!!code (I'''x''')!!County or city!!code('''x'''I)!!County or city!!code (Z'''x''')!!County

Other examples would include that 1977 cars that have 77 number plates, 1978 with 78 number plates, 1979 with 79 number plates or 1980 with 80 number plates and so on. [[Volkswagen Beetle]] cars that were imported as [[knock-down kit]]s from Mexico and assembled up to the mid-2000s were registered in Ireland on original Irish reg chassis having pre-1978 number plates.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Motor Tax in the Republic of Ireland]]\n*[[Vehicle registration plates of the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Vehicle registration plate]]\n*[[List of international license plate codes]]\n*[[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|License plates of Ireland}}\n* [http://www.wolfbane.com/vreg.htm U.K. and R.O.I.

The components are:\n\n* YYY \u2013 a three-digit year (e.g. 131 for January to June 2013; 132 for July to December 2013) based on date of first registration and not necessarily agreeing with the official model year of the car as referenced by the eleventh VIN digit<ref name=II_2013_number_plates>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/2013-number-plates-to-be-changed-to-avoid-unlucky-13-3208978.html|title=2013 number plates to be changed to avoid 'unlucky 13'|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=24 August 2012|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref>\n** YY from 1987\u20132012 \u2013 a two-digit year (e.g. 87 for 1987; 05 for 2005)\n* CC \u2013 a one- or two-character [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|county/city]] identifier (e.g. L for [[Limerick City and County Council|Limerick City and County]]; SO for [[County Sligo]]).\n* SSSSSS \u2013 a one- to six-digit sequence number, starting with the first vehicle registered in the county/city that year/period.\n\nSince 1991, the design of the standard Irish number plate has been based on [[Vehicle registration plates of Europe|European standard]] guidelines, with a blue vertical band to the left of the plate containing the twelve stars of the [[Flag of Europe]], below which is the [[List of international vehicle registration codes|country identifier]] for Ireland: IRL. The rest of the plate has a white background with black characters. There are usually two hyphens; between the year and county code, and between the county code and sequence number. Also required on vehicles registered is the full [[Irish language]] name of the county/city which must be positioned above the identifier.<ref name=si_1999/>\n\nThe current regulations are set out in the Vehicle Registration and Taxation (Amendment) Regulations, 1999,<ref name=si_1999>http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1999/en/si/0432.html</ref> as amended by the Vehicle Registration and Taxation (Amendment) Regulations 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/si/0542.html|title=S.I.

They substitute the First Schedule of the Vehicle Registration and Taxation Regulations, 1992<ref>http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/si/0318.html</ref> to allow additional characters to be displayed on the registration plate and to ensure that these are displayed in the correct position and proportion. The changes were necessary to cater for increases in the number of car registrations.\n\nUnlike legal requirements in all other European countries, a standard uniform character font is not required. The rules simply require legible black [[sans serif]] characters, no more than 70&nbsp;mm high and 36&nbsp;mm wide with a stroke width of 10&nbsp;mm, on a white reflective background. The result is that a large variety of perfectly legal font styles may be seen, on either pressed aluminium or acrylic plates, both of which are allowed.<ref name=si_1999/> Despite the rather relaxed lack of a specified font, the hyphen between the lettering must lie between the minimum dimensions of 13mm x 10mm or the maximum dimension of 22mm x 10mm. Vehicle owners may be fined if the plate's format does not meet the requirements, and the vehicle will fail the mandatory periodic [[National Car Test]].<ref>{{cite book|chapterurl=http://www.ncts.ie/NCT%20Manual%20Revise%20May%202012.pdf#page=8|chapter=Registration Plates|isbn=9781406424911|title=National Car Test Manual|date=May 2012|author=[[Road Safety Authority]]|page=8|accessdate=26 September 2013|publisher=Government Publications Office|url-status=dead|url=http://www.ncts.ie/NCT%20Manual%20Revise%20May%202012.pdf#page=8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928063435/http://www.ncts.ie/NCT%20Manual%20Revise%20May%202012.pdf#page=8|archivedate=28 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA vehicle's number plate is determined when it is first registered, the county/city code being taken from the first owner's postal address. Registration remains fixed on the one vehicle until it is de-registered (exported, destroyed, etc.), and cannot be transferred to other vehicles.\n\n==Current implementation==\n[[File:Irish Vehicle Registration Plate.svg|thumb|250px|Example of Dublin number plate from 1999 (1987\u20132012)]]\n[[File:Mansion House with car.jpg|thumb|The [[Mansion House, Dublin]] with the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]]'s official car, with 191-D-1 plate.]]\nSequence numbers may be reserved on completion of form VRT15A and payment of \u20ac1,000.\n\n* Most registration numbers can be reserved, with the exception of the first number of each year issued in Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford as these are reserved for the respective mayor/lord mayor of these cities.<ref>{{cite web |title=How to Reserve a Registration Number |url=http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/leaflets/reserve-reg-number.html |publisher=[[Revenue Commissioners]] }}</ref>\nThus, for example, in the year 2008, Lord Mayor Cllr. Paddy Bourke, the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]], was entitled to receive the registration plate <kbd>08-D-1</kbd> on his official vehicle.\n* Luxury cars with numeric names are often registered with a matching, usually pre-reserved sequence number: for example <kbd>06-D-911</kbd> on a [[Porsche 911]] or <kbd>06-D-750</kbd> [[BMW 7 Series|BMW 750]] and <kbd>08-D-89</kbd> for an [[Aston Martin DB9]].\n* Dublin radio station [[FM104]] tend to register their vehicles with reserved number sequences ending with \"104\", e.g. <kbd>05-D-38104</kbd>.\n\nThere are only two pre-1987 codes still issued in Ireland.\n* \"ZZ\", administered by the [[AA Ireland]] as agents for the Revenue Commissioners, is given to registrants who are based outside the state and who only intend keeping the vehicle within the [[Republic of Ireland]] for a period not exceeding one month. This form of temporary registration is usually used for vehicles that are purchased within the Republic of Ireland but exported by its new owner to another [[sovereign state]] directly after purchase. The format of the code is ZZ followed by a five digit number.\n* \"ZV\", which can be selected as an alternative to the current scheme when registering a vehicle older than 30 years for the first time in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n==Special formats==\nImported [[used car]]s are registered based on year of first registration in their country of original registration rather than year of import.  Each county had continuous sequence numbers for vehicles so if a new car registered on 31 December 2010 was 10 D 37456, then the next registered car from 2010 registered in 2011 would be 10 D 37457.  This changed in late 2011 when each county (prior to 2010) had their next available sequence number increased dramatically for no particular reason other than being easily identified as an \"import\".  For example, 10-D-120006 would be the 6th import in Dublin of a car from 2010, as Dublin's re-registration band starts at 120000.  Meath's starts at 15000.\n\nVehicles registered to the [[Irish Defence Forces]] have plates with silver letters on black background.  These do not feature the Irish-language county name.\n\nTrade plates have plates with white letters on dark green background.\n\nDiplomatic plates are very similar to civilian format, except the small \"CD\" between index mark code and serial number.\n\n==Index mark codes==\n[[File:Irish car reg map.jpg|thumb|Map of Ireland showing the area codes used on vehicle registration plates]]\nThe city codes are a single letter, the initial letter of its English-language name. Most county codes use the first and last letters of the name [[Counties of Ireland|county]]. For example, '''S'''lig'''o''' is SO. The exception to this is the \"D\" code which is used for [[County Dublin]] which is co-extensive with and is in use for the counties of [[Fingal]], [[South Dublin]] and [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]] and [[Dublin]] city. Other exceptions are:\n* Where the county shares its registration function with the city of the same name, in which case both use the single-letter code. An example of this is [[County Cork]], which shares the same name with [[Cork (city)|Cork City]], and takes the the code \"C\".\n* Where a conflict exists, i.e. '''K'''err'''y''' is KY, so '''K'''il'''k'''enny is KK; and County '''W'''aterfor'''d''' was (until 2014) WD, so '''W'''e'''x'''ford is WX.\n*County '''T'''ipperary is T. This is because the county was, until 2014, divided into North (TN) and South (TS).\nThe codes are similar to the [[ISO 3166-2:IE|ISO 3166-2 codes for Irish counties]]. An exception is that the ISO code for Cork is IE-CO, since IE-C is used for the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of {{lang|ga|[[Connacht]]}}, and the ISO code for Tipperary is IE-TA (from the Irish name ''Tiobraid \u00c1rann'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_3166-2_newsletter_ii-3_2011-12-13.pdf |format=PDF |title=ISO 3166-2 Newsletter II-3 |date=13 December 2011 |publisher=ISO }}</ref>\n\n===Current index mark codes===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

After this, most other codes with Z as the first letter (again skipping those containing G, S and V) were allocated in alphabetical order, starting with single-letter <kbd>Z</kbd> \u2013 the only one-letter code used in Ireland \u2013 for [[County Dublin]]. (This does not include the <kbd>ZZ</kbd> code for temporary imports, introduced in 1925.)\n\nIn February 1952, a joint motor taxation authority was set up for Dublin City and county, and their codes were merged. Two years later, with all possible codes (at the time) allocated, a new format was introduced with a serial letter added before the code, and the sequence number running only to 999 (thus limiting the number of characters on a number plate to six). The Dublin joint authority was the first to adopt this format when it issued <kbd>ARI&nbsp;1</kbd> in May 1954, and each county followed suit once all its two-letter combinations had been issued. In the case of counties with more than one code, all the three-letter marks for the first allocated code would be issued, then all such marks for the second code, and so on (see the lists of series per county below).\n\nG, S and V were not used as serial letters at first, while Z was not used before a code starting with that letter, so as to prevent any clashing with <kbd>ZZ</kbd> temporary registrations. Several other three-letter marks were not issued through oversight or because they were deemed offensive, and the single-letter Z code was left out of this format as a serial letter would have created a duplicate of an existing two-letter code, particularly one used in [[Northern Ireland]].\n\nInitially, all number plates had been black with white or silver characters, but in 1969 the option of black-on-white at the front and black-on-red at the rear was introduced.\n\n[[File:780_FZL_(license_plate).png|thumb|250px|Graphic example of pre-1987 standard rear Irish number plate for [[County Dublin]]]]\nIn February 1970, the Dublin joint authority exhausted all its three-letter combinations and thus began issuing \"reversed\" registrations, starting with the original two-letter codes (plus single-letter Z) in order of allocation. These were followed from July 1974 onwards by the three-letter marks (<kbd>1&nbsp;ARI</kbd> etc.), issued in the same manner as for the forward versions. Again, other counties followed this example over time. Also in 1974, Cork followed Dublin's example of setting up a joint motor taxation authority for [[Cork (city)|city]] and [[County Cork|county]], though their codes were not merged until August 1985.\n\nIn 1982, with Dublin and several other counties having exhausted all possible combinations of their original codes, it was decided to allocate the skipped codes containing G, S and V to these counties. In the cases of these codes, the forward three-letter combinations were issued first in the same manner as before, followed by the forward two-letter combinations.\n\nUnder this system, Irish vehicle registration marks could be transferred to Britain for re-registration on other vehicles, even after Irish independence, and even though they could not be re-used within Ireland.  The letter I in many combinations made these attractive for collectors, and indeed the [[Kilkenny]] issue <kbd>VIP&nbsp;1</kbd> has fetched a record price at auction.  Since the introduction of the current system in 1987, such exports have been impossible, even for old-format registrations, although those already exported may still be re-transferred. \n\nThe 1987 system allocated single-letter codes to the [[county borough]]s (including those shared with counties) and two-letter codes to the other counties.  Normally these are the initial and final letter of the English-language name of the county (except where duplicates would result). Until 1991, all plates under this system consisted solely of black characters on white, on both front and rear. However, in that year, the blue EU identifier and the official [[Irish language]] name of the county were added, the latter as a result of the controversy arising from using English as the basis, described by [[Conradh na Gaeilge]], an  organisation which promotes the Irish language in Ireland and worldwide, as \"a fiasco\".<ref>[https://cnag.ie/en/news/290-irish-postcodes-should-be-irish-based.html Irish Postcodes Should Be Irish-Based], [[Conradh na Gaeilge]], 11 November 2008</ref> \n\nVehicles first registered outside the state before 1987 are allowed to be re-registered using only the current system, with a year number preceding 87 \u2013 for instance, a vehicle from 1964 re-registered in [[County Meath|Meath]] would have <kbd>64-MH</kbd> at the start of its registration.\n\nIn 2013, the year was changed to a 3-digit year with the third digit being 1 for January to June and 2 for July to December, for example, 131 for January\u2013June 2013 and 132 for July\u2013December 2013.<ref name=II_2013_number_plates/> The decision to change the year was based partly on superstition about an unlucky '13' registration, but also to boost sales in the second half of the year.<ref>[http://www.thejournal.ie/number-13-licence-plates-michael-healy-rae-571256-Aug2012/ Healy-Rae vindicated as 2013 licence plates to avoid 'unlucky 13'], ''[[TheJournal.ie]]'', August 25th 2012</ref>\n\n==Pre-1987 mark codes==\n\nThe first codes were allocated in 1903, when all of [[Ireland]] was still part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The codes were based on the alphabetical order of counties and county boroughs (cities) as they were named at the time. [[County Offaly|King's County]] and [[County Laois|Queen's County]] were renamed Offaly and Laois respectively following the independence of most of Ireland as the [[Irish Free State]]. Counties and county boroughs in italics are in [[Northern Ireland]] and still use the 1903 system.\n\nCodes with the letters G, S and V were reserved until the 1980s, when they were taken by counties that had exhausted all the combinations for their original codes.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!letter!!code (I'''x''')!!County or city!!code('''x'''I)!!County or city!!code (Z'''x''')!!County
