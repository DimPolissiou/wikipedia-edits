As an author, he is known principally for his popular nonsense collections of poems, songs, short stories, botanical drawings, recipes and alphabets. He also composed and published twelve musical settings of Tennyson's poetry.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Edward Lear drawing.jpg|thumb|upright|Lear by [[Wilhelm Marstrand]]]]\nLear was born into a middle-class family at [[Holloway, London|Holloway]], North London, the penultimate of 21 children (and youngest to survive) of Ann Clark Skerrett and Jeremiah Lear, a stockbroker formerly working for the family sugar refining business.<ref>{{cite web|author=James Williams (University of Cambridge) |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=2659 |title=Literary Encyclopedia &#124; Edward Lear |publisher=Litencyc.com |date=2004-07-20 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}</ref><ref>Edward Lear, Ina Rae Hark, Twayne Publishers, 1982, pg 2</ref> He was raised by his eldest sister, also named Ann, 21 years his senior.

Andrea Gilroy and Tessa Dalley, Routledge, 1989, pg 66</ref> owing to the family's now more limited finances, Lear and his sister were required to leave the family home, Bowmans Lodge, and live together when he was aged four.

Dover Publications, 1951. Page xii.</ref>\n\nLear suffered from lifelong health afflictions. From the age of six he suffered frequent ''grand mal'' [[epileptic seizure]]s, and [[bronchitis]], [[asthma]], and during later life, partial blindness. Lear experienced his first seizure at a fair near Highgate with his father. The event scared and embarrassed him. Lear felt lifelong guilt and shame for his epileptic condition. His adult diaries indicate that he always sensed the onset of a seizure in time to remove himself from public view. When Lear was about seven years old he began to show signs of depression, possibly due to the instability of his childhood. He suffered from periods of severe [[melancholia]] which he referred to as \"the Morbids.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Complete Verse and Other Nonsense |last=Lear |first=Edward |year=2002 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |isbn=0-14-200227-5 |pages=19\u201320}}</ref>\n\n===Artist===\n[[File:Masada (or Sebbeh) on the Dead Sea, Edward Lear, 1858.jpg|thumb|left|[[Masada]] on the [[Dead Sea]], Edward Lear, 1858]]\nLear was already drawing \"for bread and cheese\" by the time he was aged 16 and soon developed into a serious \"ornithological draughtsman\" employed by the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]] and then from 1832 to 1836 by the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]], who kept a private menagerie at his estate, [[Knowsley Hall]]. He was the first major bird artist to draw birds from real live birds, instead of skins. Lear's first publication, publiregergyhrtushed when he was 19 years old, was ''[[Illustrtyry5ygddations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots]]'' in 1830.<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Lear, Edward |first=Charles William|last=Sutton|volume=32}}</ref> One of the greatest ornithological artists of his era, he taught [[Elizabeth Gould (illustrator)|Elizabeth Gould]] whilst also contributing to [[John Gould]]'s works and was compared by some to the naturalist [[John James Audubon]]. His eyesight deteriorated too much to work with such precision on the fine drawings and etchings of plates used in lithography, thus he turned to landscape painting and travel.<ref>Roger F.

He had a lifelong ambition to illustrate [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s poems; near the end of his life, a volume with a small number of illustrations was published.\n\n=== ''Illustrated Excursions in Italy'' (1842\u201346) ===\n[[File:Edward Lear - Temple of Venus and Rome, Rome - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Temple of Venus and Roma]], Rome]]\n[[File:Castello di Celano 02.jpg|thumb|Painting of [[Celano]]]]\nIn 1842 Lear began a journey into the [[Italian peninsula]], travelling through the [[Lazio]], [[Rome]], [[Abruzzo]], [[Molise]], [[Apulia]], [[Basilicata]], [[Calabria]], and [[Sicily]]. In personal notes, together with drawings, Lear gathered his impressions on the Italian way of life, folk traditions, and the beauty of the ancient monuments. Of particular interest to Lear was the [[Abruzzo]], which he visited in 1843, through the [[Marsica]] (Celano, Avezzano, [[Alba Fucens]], Trasacco) and the plateau of Cinque Miglia ([[Castel di Sangro]] and Alfedena), by an old sheep track of the shepherds.\n\nLear drew a sketch of the medieval village of Albe with Mount Sirente, and described the medieval village of Celano, with the castle of Piccolomini dominating the vast plain of Lago Fucino, which was drained a few years later to promote agricultural development. At Castel di Sangro, Lear described the winter stillness of the mountains and the beautiful basilica.\n\n===Composer and musician===\n[[File:Lear 1887.jpg|thumb|250px|upright|Lear in 1887, a year before his death.]]\nLear primarily played the piano, but he also played the accordion, flute, and small guitar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lodge |first1=Sara |title=Inventing Edward Lear |date=2019 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-98905-4 |page=22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6yuBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22 |language=en}}</ref> He composed music for many Romantic and Victorian poems, but was known mostly for his many musical settings of Tennyson's poetry. He published four settings in 1853, five in 1859, and three in 1860. Lear's were the only musical settings that Tennyson approved of. Lear also composed music for many of his nonsense songs, including \"The Owl and the Pussy-cat,\" but only two of the scores have survived, the music for \"The Courtship of the Yonghy-Bonghy-B\u00f2\" and \"The Pelican Chorus\". While he never played professionally, he did perform his own nonsense songs and his settings of others' poetry at countless social gatherings, sometimes adding his own lyrics (as with the song \"The Nervous Family\"), and sometimes replacing serious lyrics with nursery rhymes.<ref>Noakes, Vivien. ''Edward Lear: The Life of a Wanderer'', Revised Edition, pp. 99\u2013100, 2004, {{ISBN|9780750937443}}</ref>\n\n===Relationships===\nLear's most fervent and painful friendship was with Franklin Lushington. He met the young barrister in Malta in 1849 and then toured southern Greece with him. Lear developed an infatuation for him that Lushington did not wholly reciprocate. Although they remained friends for almost forty years, until Lear's death, the disparity of their feelings constantly tormented Lear. Indeed, Lear's attempts at male companionship were not always successful; the very intensity of Lear's affections may have doomed these relationships.<ref>Susan Chitty, That Singular Person Called Lear, Atheneum, 1989</ref>\n\nThe closest he came to marriage was two proposals, both to the same woman 46 years his junior, which were not accepted. For companions, he relied instead on friends and correspondents, and especially, during later life, on his Albanian [[Souliotes|Souliote]] chef, Giorgis, a faithful friend and, as Lear complained, a thoroughly unsatisfactory chef.<ref>Levi, Peter.

Many other works followed.\n\nLear's nonsense books were quite popular during his lifetime, but a rumour developed that \"Edward Lear\" was merely a pseudonym, and the books' true author was the man to whom Lear had dedicated the works, his patron the Earl of Derby.

Lear's limericks, however, were published in a variety of formats; it appears that Lear wrote them in manuscript in as many lines as there was room for beneath the picture.

From the age of six he suffered frequent ''grand mal'' [[epileptic seizure]]s, and [[bronchitis]], [[asthma]], and during later life, partial blindness. Lear experienced his first seizure at a fair near Highgate with his father. The event scared and embarrassed him. Lear felt lifelong guilt and shame for his epileptic condition. His adult diaries indicate that he always sensed the onset of a seizure in time to remove himself from public view. When Lear was about seven years old he began to show signs of depression, possibly due to the instability of his childhood. He suffered from periods of severe [[melancholia]] which he referred to as \"the Morbids.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Complete Verse and Other Nonsense |last=Lear |first=Edward |year=2002 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |isbn=0-14-200227-5 |pages=19\u201320}}</ref>\n\n===Artist===\n[[File:Masada (or Sebbeh) on the Dead Sea, Edward Lear, 1858.jpg|thumb|left|[[Masada]] on the [[Dead Sea]], Edward Lear, 1858]]\nLear was already drawing \"for bread and cheese\" by the time he was aged 16 and soon developed into a serious \"ornithological draughtsman\" employed by the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]] and then from 1832 to 1836 by the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]], who kept a private menagerie at his estate, [[Knowsley Hall]].

He had a lifelong ambition to illustrate [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s poems; near the end of his life, a volume with a small number of illustrations was published.\n\n=== ''Illustrated Excursions in Italy'' (1842\u201346) ===\n[[File:Edward Lear - Temple of Venus and Rome, Rome - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Temple of Venus and Roma]], Rome]]\n[[File:Castello di Celano 02.jpg|thumb|Painting of [[Celano]]]]\nIn 1842 Lear began a journey into the [[Italian peninsula]], travelling through the [[Lazio]], [[Rome]], [[Abruzzo]], [[Molise]], [[Apulia]], [[Basilicata]], [[Calabria]], and [[Sicily]]. In personal notes, together with drawings, Lear gathered his impressions on the Italian way of life, folk traditions, and the beauty of the ancient monuments. Of particular interest to Lear was the [[Abruzzo]], which he visited in 1843, through the [[Marsica]] (Celano, Avezzano, [[Alba Fucens]], Trasacco) and the plateau of Cinque Miglia ([[Castel di Sangro]] and Alfedena), by an old sheep track of the shepherds.\n\nLear drew a sketch of the medieval village of Albe with Mount Sirente, and described the medieval village of Celano, with the castle of Piccolomini dominating the vast plain of Lago Fucino, which was drained a few years later to promote agricultural development. At Castel di Sangro, Lear described the winter stillness of the mountains and the beautiful basilica.\n\n===Composer and musician===\n[[File:Lear 1887.jpg|thumb|250px|upright|Lear in 1887, a year before his death.]]\nLear primarily played the piano, but he also played the accordion, flute, and small guitar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lodge |first1=Sara |title=Inventing Edward Lear |date=2019 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-98905-4 |page=22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6yuBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22 |language=en}}</ref> He composed music for many Romantic and Victorian poems, but was known mostly for his many musical settings of Tennyson's poetry. He published four settings in 1853, five in 1859, and three in 1860. Lear's were the only musical settings that Tennyson approved of. Lear also composed music for many of his nonsense songs, including \"The Owl and the Pussy-cat,\" but only two of the scores have survived, the music for \"The Courtship of the Yonghy-Bonghy-B\u00f2\" and \"The Pelican Chorus\". While he never played professionally, he did perform his own nonsense songs and his settings of others' poetry at countless social gatherings, sometimes adding his own lyrics (as with the song \"The Nervous Family\"), and sometimes replacing serious lyrics with nursery rhymes.<ref>Noakes, Vivien.

He met the young barrister in Malta in 1849 and then toured southern Greece with him. Lear developed an infatuation for him that Lushington did not wholly reciprocate. Although they remained friends for almost forty years, until Lear's death, the disparity of their feelings constantly tormented Lear. Indeed, Lear's attempts at male companionship were not always successful; the very intensity of Lear's affections may have doomed these relationships.<ref>Susan Chitty, That Singular Person Called Lear, Atheneum, 1989</ref>\n\nThe closest he came to marriage was two proposals, both to the same woman 46 years his junior, which were not accepted. For companions, he relied instead on friends and correspondents, and especially, during later life, on his Albanian [[Souliotes|Souliote]] chef, Giorgis, a faithful friend and, as Lear complained, a thoroughly unsatisfactory chef.<ref>Levi, Peter.

Lear's birthplace area is now marked with a plaque at Bowman's Mews, Islington, in London, and his bicentenary during 2012 was celebrated with a variety of events, exhibitions and lectures in venues across the world including an International Owl and Pussycat Day on his birth anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://teachingnonsenseinschools.wordpress.com |title=International Owl & Pussycat Day, 12 May &#124; Just another WordPress.com site |publisher=Teachingnonsenseinschools.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-16}}</ref>\n\n==Author==\n[[File:Edward Lear sketches dated 15 May 1864, from Paddy Leigh Fermor collection.jpg|thumbnail|Edward Lear sketches dated 15 May 1864, from [[Paddy Leigh Fermor]]'s collection.]]\n[[File:Howatke by Edward Lear 1867.jpg|thumb|left|''Howatke'', by Edward Lear, 1867]]\nIn 1846 Lear published ''[[:s:A Book of Nonsense|A Book of Nonsense]],'' a volume of limericks which went through three editions and helped popularize the form and the genre of [[literary nonsense]]. In 1871 he published ''Nonsense Songs, Stories, Botany and Alphabets'', which included his most famous nonsense song, ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat]],'' which he wrote for the children of his patron [[Edward Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby]]. Many other works followed.\n\nLear's nonsense books were quite popular during his lifetime, but a rumour developed that \"Edward Lear\" was merely a pseudonym, and the books' true author was the man to whom Lear had dedicated the works, his patron the Earl of Derby. Promoters of this rumour offered as evidence that both men were named Edward, and that \"Lear\" is an [[anagram]] of \"Earl.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Lear|first=Edward|title=More Nonsense Pictures, Rhymes, Botany, etc.|year=1894|chapter=Introduction|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13650/13650-h/13650-h.htm#introduction3}}</ref>\n[[File:The falls of the Kalama Albania 1851 by Edward Lear 1812-1888.jpg|thumb|''The falls of the Kalama, [[Albania]] 1851]]\nLear's nonsense works are distinguished by a facility of verbal invention and a poet's delight in the sounds of words, both real and imaginary. A stuffed [[rhinoceros]] becomes a \"diaphanous doorscraper.\" A \"blue Boss-Woss\" plunges into \"a perpendicular, spicular, orbicular, quadrangular, circular depth of soft mud.\" His heroes are Quangle-Wangles, Pobbles, and Jumblies. One of his most famous verbal inventions, the phrase \"[[runcible]] spoon,\" occurs in the closing lines of ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat]],'' and is now found in many English dictionaries:\n{{poemquote|\nThey dined on [[Ground meat|mince]] and slices of [[quince]],\n    Which they ate with a [[runcible]] spoon;\nAnd hand in hand, on the edge of the sand\n    They danced by the light of the moon,\n                The moon,\n                The moon,\n    They danced by the light of the moon.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lear |first=Edward |author-link=Edward Lear |editor-last=Strachey |editor-first=Constance Braham, Lady |title=The Complete Nonsense Book |date=1912 |publisher=Duffield & Company |location=New York |oclc=1042550888 |url=https://archive.org/details/completenonsense01lear |pages=[https://archive.org/details/completenonsense01lear/page/125 125]-127}}</ref>\n|source=lines 27-33}}\n\nThough famous for his [[neologisms]], Lear used a number of other devices in his works in order to defy [[Schema (psychology)|reader expectations]]. For example, \"Cold Are the Crabs\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ingeb.org/songs/coldaret.html |title=Cold Are the Crabs |publisher=Ingeb.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-16}}</ref> conforms to the [[sonnet]] tradition until its dramatically foreshortened last line.\n\n[[Image:1862ca-a-book-of-nonsense--edward-lear-001.jpg|thumb|''A Book of Nonsense'' (c. 1875 James Miller edition) by Edward Lear]]\nToday, limericks are invariably typeset as four plus one lines. Lear's limericks, however, were published in a variety of formats; it appears that Lear wrote them in manuscript in as many lines as there was room for beneath the picture. For the first three editions, most are typeset as, respectively, two, five, and three lines. The cover of one edition<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nonsenselit.org/Lear/BoN/index.html |title=Edward Lear, A Book of Nonsense |publisher=Nonsenselit.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-16}}</ref> bears an entire limerick typeset in two lines:\n{{poemquote|\nThere was an Old Derry down Derry, who loved to see little folks merry;\nSo he made them a Book, and with laughter they shook, at the fun of that Derry down Derry!}}\n\nIn Lear's limericks, the first and last lines usually end with the same word rather than rhyming. For the most part they are truly nonsensical and devoid of any punch line or point. They are completely free of the [[off-color humor|bawdiness]] with which the verse form is now associated. A typical thematic element is the presence of a callous and critical \"they.\" An example of a typical Lear limerick:\n{{poemquote|\nThere was an Old Man of [[Aosta|A\u00f4sta]]\nWho possessed a large Cow, but he lost her;\nBut they said, \"Don't you see she has run up a tree,\nYou invidious Old Man of A\u00f4sta?\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Lear |first=Edward |author-link=Edward Lear |editor-last=Strachey |editor-first=Constance Braham, Lady |title=The Complete Nonsense Book |date=1912 |publisher=Duffield & Company |location=New York |oclc=1042550888 |url=https://archive.org/details/completenonsense01lear |page=[https://archive.org/details/completenonsense01lear/page/108 108]}}</ref>}}\n\nLear's self-description in verse, ''How Pleasant to know Mr. Lear,'' ends with this [[stanza]], a reference to his own mortality:\n{{poemquote|\nHe reads, but he cannot speak, Spanish,\n    He cannot abide ginger-beer:\nEre the days of his pilgrimage vanish,\n    How pleasant to know Mr. Lear!<ref>{{cite book |last=Lear |first=Edward |author-link=Edward Lear |editor-last=Strachey |editor-first=Constance Braham, Lady |title=The Complete Nonsense Book |date=1912 |publisher=Duffield & Company |location=New York |oclc=1042550888 |url=https://archive.org/details/completenonsense01lear |pages=[https://archive.org/details/completenonsense01lear/page/420 420]-421}}</ref>\n|source=Stanza 8 (lines 29-32)}}\n\nFive of Lear's limericks from the Book of Nonsense, in the 1946 Italian translation by [[Carlo Izzo]], were set to music for choir a cappella by [[Goffredo Petrassi]] in 1952.\n\n==Portrayals==\nEdward Lear has been played in radio dramas by [[Andrew Sachs]] in ''The Need for Nonsense'' by [[Julia Blackburn]] ([[BBC Radio 4]], 9 February 2009)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00hc407|title=BBC Radio 4 Extra - Drama, The Need for Nonsense|website=BBC|accessdate=25 June 2019}}</ref> and by [[Derek Jacobi]] in ''By the Coast of Coromandel'' by Lavinia Murray ([[BBC Radio 4]], 21 December 2011).\n\n==Works==\n* ''[[Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots]]'' (1832)\n* ''Views in Rome and its Environs'' (1841)\n* ''Gleanings from the Menagerie at Knowsley Hall'' (1846)\n* ''Book of Nonsense'' (1846)\n* ''Illustrated Excursions in Italy'' (1846)\n* ''[[Mount Timohorit, Albania]]'' (1848)\n* ''Journal of a Landscape Painter in Greece and Albania'' (1851)\n* ''The falls of the Kalama Albania (1851)\n* ''Journal of a Landscape Painter in Southern Calabria'' (1852)\n* ''Poems and Songs by Alfred Tennyson'' (1853, 1859, 1860) Twelve total musical settings published, each being for a Tennyson poem.\n* ''Journal of a Landscape Painter in Corsica'' (1870)\n* ''Nonsense Songs and Stories'' (1870, dated 1871)<ref>{{cite book|editor=Cox, Michael|title=The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-19-860634-6|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/conciseoxfordchr00coxm}}</ref>\n* ''Tortoises, Terrapins, and Turtles'' (1872), introduction by [[John Edward Gray|J.E.

On the job experience is conducted at various camps, ships and bases within the NZDF. This is a total of two-and-a-half years of intensive training. After their training, medics are then posted to their respective camps and bases.

Unlike the Mangusta, which employed a [[steel]] backbone chassis, the Pantera's chassis was of a steel [[monocoque]] design, the first instance of De Tomaso using this construction technique. The Pantera logo included a T-shaped symbol that was the brand used by De Tomaso's Argentinian cattle ranching ancestors,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.hemmings.com/hsx/stories/2010/04/01/hmn_feature16.html |title=De Tomaso: The Italian automaker's South American heritage is in its emblem|journal=Hemmings Sports & Exotic Car|date=April 2010 |first=Craig |last=Fitzgerals|accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> as well as a version of the Argentinean flag turned on its side, inspired by the company's founder, Alejandro De Tomaso, having been born and raised in Argentina.\n\n[[File:Detomaso Pantera Interior.JPG|thumb|left|Interior (1972 model)]]\nThe car debuted in Modena in March 1970 and was presented at the 1970 [[New York International Auto Show|New York Motor Show]] a few weeks later.<ref name=Motor197107/> Approximately a year later the first production cars were sold, and production was increased to three per day.<ref name=Motor197107/>\n\nThe slat-backed seats which had attracted criticism at the New York Auto Show were replaced by more conventional body-hugging sports seats in the production cars: leg-room was generous but the pedals were off-set and headroom was insufficient for drivers above approximately {{cvt|6|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} tall.<ref name=Motor197107/> Reflecting its makers' transatlantic ambitions, the Pantera came with an abundance of standard features which appeared exotic in Europe, such as electric windows, air conditioning and even \"doors that buzz when ... open\".<ref name=Motor197107/> By the time the Pantera reached production stage, the interior was in most respects well sorted, although resting an arm on the central console could lead to inadvertently activating the poorly located cigarette lighter.<ref name=Motor197107/>\n\nThe first 1971 Pantera models were powered by a {{convert|351|CID|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Ford 335 engine#351 Cleveland|''Ford Cleveland'' V8 engine]] having a power output of {{convert|335|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The high torque provided by the Ford engine reduced the need for excessive gear changing at low speeds: this made the car much less demanding to drive in urban conditions than many of the locally built offerings.<ref name=Motor197107/>\n\nThe [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] [[transaxle]] used in the Mangusta was also used for the Pantera: a passenger in an early Pantera recorded that the mechanical noises emanating from the transaxle were more intrusive than the well restrained engine noise.<ref name=Motor197107/> Another Italian car that shares the ZF transaxle is the [[Maserati Bora]], also launched in 1971 although not yet available for sale.<ref name=Motor19710710>{{cite journal| first=Paul |last=Fr\u00e8re |title=Continental Diary....Up to now only two Bora have been built| journal =The Motor| volume = | pages=30\u201331|date =10 July 1971}}</ref> Power-assisted four-wheel [[disc brake]]s and [[rack and pinion]] steering were all standard equipment on the Pantera.

The first 75 cars were simply European imports and are known for their \"push-button\" door handles and hand-built [[Carrozzeria Vignale]] bodies. A total of 1,007 cars reached the United States that year. As with most Italian cars of the day, rust-proofing was minimal and the quality of fit and finish on these early models was poor with large amounts of [[body solder]] being used to cover body panel flaws. Subsequently, Ford increased their involvement in the production of the later cars with the introduction of precision stampings for body panels which resulted in improved overall quality.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pantera International |url=http://panterainternational.org/detomaso_history/fords_pantera.html}}</ref> \n \nSeveral modifications were made to the Pantera for the 1972 model year. A new {{cvt|351|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[4 Bolt Main]] [[Cleveland Engine]], was used with lower [[compression ratio]] (from 11:1 to 8.6:1, chiefly to meet US emissions standards and run on lower octane standard fuel) but with the more aggressive \"Cobra Jet\" camshaft (featuring the same lift and duration as the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|428 Cobra Jet]]'s factory performance cam) in an effort to reclaim some of the power lost through the reduction in compression ratio along with a dual point distributor. Many other engine changes were made, including the use of a factory [[Exhaust manifold|exhaust header]].\n\nThe \"Lusso\" (luxury) '''Pantera L''' was also introduced in August 1972 as a 1972\u00bd model. For the US market, it featured a large black single front bumper that incorporated a built-in airfoil to reduce front end lift at high speeds, rather than the separate bumperettes still used abroad, as well as the Cleveland engine now having a power output of {{cvt|266|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The \"L\" model featured many factory upgrades and updates that fixed most of the problems and issues the earlier cars experienced. It was so improved that the 1973 DeTomaso Pantera was Road Test Magazine's Import car of the year beating offerings from Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini, and Porsche. During 1973 the dashboard was changed, deviating from two separate pods for the gauges to a unified unit with the dials angled towards the driver. The U.S. version of the 1974 '''Pantera GTS''' featured optional GTS badging but not the higher compression, solid lifter engine of its European GTS \"cousin\".\n\n=== Disengagement of Ford ===\n[[File:De Tomaso Pantera GT5.jpg|thumb|right|De Tomaso Pantera GT5]]\nFord stopped importing the Pantera to the US in 1975, having sold around 5,500 cars. De Tomaso continued to build the car in ever-escalating forms of performance and luxury for almost two decades for sale in the rest of the world. A small number of cars were imported to the US by [[Grey import vehicles|gray market]] importers in the 1980s, notably Panteramerica and AmeriSport. After 1974, Ford discontinued the Cleveland 351 engine, but production continued in Australia until 1982. De Tomaso started sourcing their engines from Australia once the American supplies stopped. These engines were tuned in Switzerland and were available with a range of outputs up to {{convert|360|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"AK87\">{{cite book|title=Auto Katalog 1987|publisher=[[:de:Motor Presse Stuttgart|Vereinigte Motor-Verlage GmbH & Co.

Production of the wide body GT5 (and similarly equipped narrow body GTS models) continued until 1985, when the GT5-S replaced the GT5. Although the factory has not made its records available, an analysis based on [[Vehicle Identification Number]]s by the Pantera Owners Club of America (POCA) late model (9000 series) registrar has shown that fewer than 252 GT5 Pantera models were likely to have been built. The GT5-S featured single piece flared steel fenders instead of the GT5's bolted-on fiberglass flares, and a smaller steel front air dam. The 'S' in the GT5-S name stood for \"steel\". Otherwise the GT5-S was largely identical to the GT5. The POCA 9000 series registrar's VIN analysis indicates that fewer than 183 GT5-S Panteras were built. Concurrent GTS production continued, on a custom order and very limited basis, until the late 1980s.\n\nThe car continued to use a Ford V8 engine, although in 1988, when the supply of Ford 351 Cleveland engines from Australia ran out, De Tomaso began installing [[Ford small block engine#351W|Ford 351 Windsor engines]] in the Pantera instead. In all, about 7,200 cars in total were built.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Pantera Si==\n[[File:1990 De Tomaso Pantera Si.jpg|thumb|DeTomaso Pantera Si]]\nFor 1990 the 351 engine was replaced by the Ford 302 engine {{cvt|302|cuin|L|abbr=on}} engine and the Pantera received new styling penned by [[Marcello Gandini]], suspension redesign and a partial chassis redesign. The new model was called the Pantera 90 Si and it was introduced in 1990. Only 38 90 Si models were sold before the Pantera was finally phased out in 1993 to make way for the radical [[De Tomaso Guar\u00e0|Guar\u00e0]]. Some sources state that 41 were built (with the last one not finished until 1996), of which four were targa models. The targas were converted by Pavesi directly off the production lines. In the UK, the model was sold as Pantera 90.\n\n==Specifications==\n[[File:De Tomaso Pantera Series II Front.jpg|thumb|right|A one-off second generation Pantera prototype made by [[Ghia]].<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com/2008\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2008/cars/others/de_tomaso/05/villa_deste/0205.html|date=2008-03-05 |title=Long Forgotten Pantera Prototype Resurfaces at Villa d'Este|accessdate=2008-07-18|work=italiaspeed.com/2008}}</ref>]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+[[Model year]]\n!Specification data\n!1971 L<ref name=\"1971L\">{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1971/695495/de_tomaso_pantera.html\n|title=1971 De Tomaso Pantera L\n|website=automobile-catalog.com\n|editor=Pawel Zal\n|accessdate=September 23, 2018}}</ref>\n!1988 GT5 S <ref name=\"GT5S\">{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1988/695810/de_tomaso_pantera_gt5s.html|title=1988 De Tomaso Pantera GT5 S (man. 5) specifications|website=automobile-catalog.com|language=en-us|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Engine configuration]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" |{{convert|351|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Naturally aspirated]] [[Ford 335 engine#351 Cleveland|Ford Cleveland V8]]\n|-\n|Fuel system\n|[[Autolite]] 4-barrel [[carburetor]]\n|[[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] 4-barrel carburetor\n|-\n|[[Curb weight]]\n|{{convert|3123|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|3250|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|[[Wheelbase]]\n|{{convert|98.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|98.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Front track\n|{{convert|57.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|59.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Rear track\n|{{convert|58.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|62.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Length\n|{{convert|158.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|168.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Width\n|{{convert|67.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|77.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Height\n|{{convert|43.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|43.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|[[Brake]]s\n|Front: 332 x 32 [[ventilated disc brake|ventilated discs]] and cross-drilled;<br/>Rear: 314 x 28 ventilated<br/>(1971 models had 15-inch wheels and brake rotors were smaller than {{convert|300|mm|in|1|abbr=on}})\n|Front: {{convert|284|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} ventilated;<br/>Rear: {{convert|297|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} ventilated<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1985-detomaso-pantera-gt5-s/\n|website=Supercars.net\n|title=1985 De Tomaso Pantera GT5-S}}</ref>\n|-\n|Power\n|{{convert|326|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,400 rpm\n|{{convert|350|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000 rpm\n|-\n|Torque\n|{{convert|466|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 3,500 rpm\n|{{convert|451|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 3,800 rpm\n|-\n|Fuel economy\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" |Highway (Extra-urban): {{convert|14.6|mpgus|1|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"1971L\"/><ref name=\"GT5S\"/><ref name=\"Willson2\">{{cite book|title=The Ultimate Classic Car Book|last=Willson|first=Quentin|publisher=DK Publishing, Inc.|year=1995|isbn=0-7894-0159-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ultimateclassicc00quen}}</ref>\n|-\n|Compression ratio\n|11.0:1\n|9.5:1\n|-\n|Gearbox\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" |5-speed [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] [[manual transmission]]\n|-\n|Maximum speed\n|{{convert|159|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Willson2\" />\n|{{convert|174|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"GT5S\"/>\n|}\n\n==Motorsports==\n===Group 3===\n[[File:Paris - Bonhams 2014 - De Tomaso Pantera Group 3 - 1972 - 001.jpg|thumb|left|A De Tomaso Pantera GTS Group 3 prototype]]\n\nDe Tomaso offered a Pantera competition car built to special order according to the Group 3 class racing rules between 1972 and 1984 based on the Pantera GTS. 30 cars were built for private customer teams. Group 3 rules were very strict and allowed little modifications to the original road going production cars. Earlier Group 3 cars are infamously called \"push button\" chassis cars as they were built by hand because De Tomaso didn't have a proper assembly line when the Pantera began production. Special equipment of the Group 3 cars included Campagnolo wheels (15 x 8 inches at the front and 15 x 10 inches at the rear), adjustable Koni shocks, racing brakes and special safety equipment required at the time: plexi-glass windows with cutouts, a roll bar, fire extinguisher and racing bucket seats. The engine modifications included a reinforced camshaft, a 10-litre oil pan and a Holley racing 4 barrel carburetor. Displacement of the engine was also enlarged to 5.8-litres. The engine had a power output of {{cvt|336|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The engine was mated to a 5-speed close ratio gearbox with a heavy duty single plate clutch and a limited slip differential. It was reported that with the long ratio gears, the Group 3 cars could achieve a top speed up to {{cvt|280|kph|mph|0|abbr=on}}. The Group 3 cars were so competitive that this prompted Porsche to speed up development of the more powerful 911 Carrera RS and Carrera RSR race cars. The use of racing brakes for the Pantera Group 3 was not allowed until 1975 and the car competed with the brakes of the road legal Pantera which proved to be its weak point. Due to an accident in 1973 at the Charade circuit, reinforced hubs developed by De Tomaso for the Group 3 car were approved in Group 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/17043/lot/136/?category=list|title=1973 DE TOMASO PANTERA GP3, 1973 De Tomaso Pantera Group 3 Coup\u00e9 Chassis no. 2006|date=2009-02-07|publisher=[[Bonhams]]|accessdate=2019-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://detomasodc.co.uk/pantera-gts|title=Pantera GTS|work=De Tomaso Driver's Club|accessdate=2019-07-05}}</ref>\n\n===Group 4===\n[[File:De Tomaso Pantera GTS Group 4 Gen1 000 1972 frontleft 2013-03-17 U.jpg|thumb|left|A De Tomaso Pantera GTS Group 4 competition car]]\n\nAfter the Pantera had begun production, De Tomaso introduced a motorsport oriented Group 3 version of the car. This was followed by a modified Group 4 version in 1972. British engineer and driver Mike Parkes, who had previously developed racing cars for Ferrari was tasked with the development of the new car.\n\nAs per the regulations, the Group 4 car was based around the road car's steel monocoque chassis. The double wishbone suspension was substantially modified and Koni adjustable shocks were used in order to improve handling at the track and make room for wider Campagnolo wheels and tyres. Bigger ventilated brakes supplied by Girling and a quick ratio steering rack were used to refine handling and stopping power. The standard steel body shell of the Pantera also received modifications such as aluminium doors, front lid and engine cover along with flared fibre glass wheel arches in order to accommodate the wide wheels and tyres. Plexi glass windows were used throughout and holes were cut into the chassis where possible in order to reduce weight. The car had no front or rear bumpers and a front deep chin spoiler. It also didn't had any rustproofing and interior amenities. The interior was fitted with a cut-off switch instead of a radio, light weight cloth bucket racing seats, a vinyl trim, a roll-cage and drilled aluminium pedals. The final car had a weight of {{cvt|1100|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nFord, providing a good amount of financial backing in the development of the road going Pantera had little interest in the motorsport version of the car and refused to supply engines for the Group 4 Pantera. De Tomaso engaged a private US based engine builder Bud Moore to supply engines for the car.\n\nBased on the same Ford 351 Cleveland V8 engine used in the road going Pantera, the engine in the Group 4 Pantera was fitted with bespoke aluminium heads, TRW forged pistons, large capacity oil pans and titanium valves. Initially, a single Holley Racing 1150 CFM four barrel carburetor was fitted but this was replaced by four Weber carburetors and a revised intake. The engine had a higher compression ratio of 12.0:1. Displacement of the racing engine was unchanged from road going Pantera's engine. The \"spaghetti\" styled exhaust system similar to the one used in the [[Ford GT40]] was used. The engine had a claimed power output of {{cvt|507|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. Although the cars ran at a power output of {{cvt|446|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000 rpm which was increased to {{cvt|477|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} when the Weber 850 CFM carburetors were used. The engine was mated to a ZF 5-speed close ratio manual transmission with a heavy duty single clutch plate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.janluehn.com/cars/1974-de-tomaso-pantera-group-4|title=De Tomaso Pantera Group 4|publisher=Jan B Leuhn|accessdate=2019-07-05}}</ref>\n\nThe first Group 4 Panteras were entered into the 1972 24 Hours of LeMans. The problems of the car then began to become apparent. The engine proved to be unreliable and the car was also subject to a weight penalty, increasing the weight to {{cvt|1250|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. This was set reportedly high due to [[Porsche]]'s influence over the governing body of the race. Another problem of the car was the rigidity of its chassis. Nevertheless, the car continued to compete in Group 4 and the engine problem was addressed by sourcing replacement engines with a lower compression ratio. A total of 14 Group 4 cars were made. Some Group 3 cars were modified to Group 4 specifications by privateers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimatecarpage.com/txt/6263/2/DeTomaso-Pantera-Group-4.html|title=De Tomaso Pantera Group 4|date=2015-06-17|first=Wouter|last=Melissen|publisher=Ultimate Car Page|accessdate=2019-07-05}}</ref>\n\n===Group 5===\n[[File:De Tomaso Pantera Mallory Park.JPG|thumb|right|De Tomaso Pantera Group 5 competition car]]\n\nThe Group 5 Pantera race cars were converted by private racing teams from Group 4 and Group 3 cars and competed in Group 5 class racing from 1976 to 1981. The Group 5 cars only had wider body panels and no significant design, mechanical and chassis modifications.\n\nHowever, two cars were extensively modified to compete in the IMSA GTX and Group 5 class respectively. The first car having chassis number #001 was constructed from a new chassis by Italian racing team Sala and Marveti. The second car, having chassis number #1603 was a Group 4 car campaigned by Hugh Kleinpeter in the US and then underwent modification. Afterwards, the former was converted to Group C class specifications in 1983 and the latter was converted to IMSA GTP class specifications respectively. Both cars were uncompetitive in their categories.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gr5pantera.com/gr-5-panteras|title=Gr 5 Panteras, 1976 - 1981|accessdate=2019-07-05}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[AMC AMX#AMX/3]] - first shown a month earlier, and sometimes confused with.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|De Tomaso Pantera}}\n* (August, 1971) ''[[Car and Driver]]''\n* [http://www.poca.com Pantera Owners Club of America]\n* [http://www.DeTomasoRegistry.org The DeTomaso Registry]\n* [http://carplusautoblog.com/de-tomaso-pantera-the-top-speed-car/ Tomaso Pantera Review]\n\n{{De Tomaso}}\n\n[[Category:De Tomaso vehicles|Pantera]]\n[[Category:Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Group 4 cars]]\n[[Category:1980s cars]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1970]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|mid-engine sports car produced by Italian automobile manufacturer De Tomaso from 1971 to 1992}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = De Tomaso Pantera\n| image = De Tomaso Pantera GT5-S (7160836758).jpg\n| caption = De Tomaso Pantera GT5-S\n| manufacturer = [[De Tomaso|De Tomaso Automobili]]\n| assembly = Italy: [[Modena]]<ref name=\"danjedlicka.com\">1971-74 DeTomaso Pantera History by Dan Jedlicka: [http://www.danjedlicka.com/classic_cars/1971_74_detomaso_pantera.html 1971-74 DeTomaso Pantera History by Dan Jedlicka], accessdate: 8.

Unlike the Mangusta, which employed a [[steel]] backbone chassis, the Pantera's chassis was of a steel [[monocoque]] design, the first instance of De Tomaso using this construction technique. The Pantera logo included a T-shaped symbol that was the brand used by De Tomaso's Argentinian cattle ranching ancestors,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.hemmings.com/hsx/stories/2010/04/01/hmn_feature16.html |title=De Tomaso: The Italian automaker's South American heritage is in its emblem|journal=Hemmings Sports & Exotic Car|date=April 2010 |first=Craig |last=Fitzgerals|accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> as well as a version of the Argentinean flag turned on its side, inspired by the company's founder, Alejandro De Tomaso, having been born and raised in Argentina.\n\n[[File:Detomaso Pantera Interior.JPG|thumb|left|Interior (1972 model)]]\nThe car debuted in Modena in March 1970 and was presented at the 1970 [[New York International Auto Show|New York Motor Show]] a few weeks later.<ref name=Motor197107/> Approximately a year later the first production cars were sold, and production was increased to three per day.<ref name=Motor197107/>\n\nThe slat-backed seats which had attracted criticism at the New York Auto Show were replaced by more conventional body-hugging sports seats in the production cars: leg-room was generous but the pedals were off-set and headroom was insufficient for drivers above approximately {{cvt|6|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} tall.<ref name=Motor197107/> Reflecting its makers' transatlantic ambitions, the Pantera came with an abundance of standard features which appeared exotic in Europe, such as electric windows, air conditioning and even \"doors that buzz when ... open\".<ref name=Motor197107/> By the time the Pantera reached production stage, the interior was in most respects well sorted, although resting an arm on the central console could lead to inadvertently activating the poorly located cigarette lighter.<ref name=Motor197107/>\n\nThe first 1971 Pantera models were powered by a {{convert|351|CID|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Ford 335 engine#351 Cleveland|''Ford Cleveland'' V8 engine]] having a power output of {{convert|335|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The high torque provided by the Ford engine reduced the need for excessive gear changing at low speeds: this made the car much less demanding to drive in urban conditions than many of the locally built offerings.<ref name=Motor197107/>\n\nThe [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] [[transaxle]] used in the Mangusta was also used for the Pantera: a passenger in an early Pantera recorded that the mechanical noises emanating from the transaxle were more intrusive than the well restrained engine noise.<ref name=Motor197107/> Another Italian car that shares the ZF transaxle is the [[Maserati Bora]], also launched in 1971 although not yet available for sale.<ref name=Motor19710710>{{cite journal| first=Paul |last=Fr\u00e8re |title=Continental Diary....Up to now only two Bora have been built| journal =The Motor| volume = | pages=30\u201331|date =10 July 1971}}</ref> Power-assisted four-wheel [[disc brake]]s and [[rack and pinion]] steering were all standard equipment on the Pantera.

The first 75 cars were simply European imports and are known for their \"push-button\" door handles and hand-built [[Carrozzeria Vignale]] bodies. A total of 1,007 cars reached the United States that year. As with most Italian cars of the day, rust-proofing was minimal and the quality of fit and finish on these early models was poor with large amounts of [[body solder]] being used to cover body panel flaws. Subsequently, Ford increased their involvement in the production of the later cars with the introduction of precision stampings for body panels which resulted in improved overall quality.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pantera International |url=http://panterainternational.org/detomaso_history/fords_pantera.html}}</ref> \n \nSeveral modifications were made to the Pantera for the 1972 model year. A new {{cvt|351|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[4 Bolt Main]] [[Cleveland Engine]], was used with lower [[compression ratio]] (from 11:1 to 8.6:1, chiefly to meet US emissions standards and run on lower octane standard fuel) but with the more aggressive \"Cobra Jet\" camshaft (featuring the same lift and duration as the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|428 Cobra Jet]]'s factory performance cam) in an effort to reclaim some of the power lost through the reduction in compression ratio along with a dual point distributor. Many other engine changes were made, including the use of a factory [[Exhaust manifold|exhaust header]].\n\nThe \"Lusso\" (luxury) '''Pantera L''' was also introduced in August 1972 as a 1972\u00bd model. For the US market, it featured a large black single front bumper that incorporated a built-in airfoil to reduce front end lift at high speeds, rather than the separate bumperettes still used abroad, as well as the Cleveland engine now having a power output of {{cvt|266|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The \"L\" model featured many factory upgrades and updates that fixed most of the problems and issues the earlier cars experienced. It was so improved that the 1973 DeTomaso Pantera was Road Test Magazine's Import car of the year beating offerings from Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini, and Porsche. During 1973 the dashboard was changed, deviating from two separate pods for the gauges to a unified unit with the dials angled towards the driver. The U.S. version of the 1974 '''Pantera GTS''' featured optional GTS badging but not the higher compression, solid lifter engine of its European GTS \"cousin\".\n\n=== Disengagement of Ford ===\n[[File:De Tomaso Pantera GT5.jpg|thumb|right|De Tomaso Pantera GT5]]\nFord stopped importing the Pantera to the US in 1975, having sold around 5,500 cars. De Tomaso continued to build the car in ever-escalating forms of performance and luxury for almost two decades for sale in the rest of the world. A small number of cars were imported to the US by [[Grey import vehicles|gray market]] importers in the 1980s, notably Panteramerica and AmeriSport. After 1974, Ford discontinued the Cleveland 351 engine, but production continued in Australia until 1982. De Tomaso started sourcing their engines from Australia once the American supplies stopped. These engines were tuned in Switzerland and were available with a range of outputs up to {{convert|360|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"AK87\">{{cite book|title=Auto Katalog 1987|publisher=[[:de:Motor Presse Stuttgart|Vereinigte Motor-Verlage GmbH & Co.

Production of the wide body GT5 (and similarly equipped narrow body GTS models) continued until 1985, when the GT5-S replaced the GT5. Although the factory has not made its records available, an analysis based on [[Vehicle Identification Number]]s by the Pantera Owners Club of America (POCA) late model (9000 series) registrar has shown that fewer than 252 GT5 Pantera models were likely to have been built. The GT5-S featured single piece flared steel fenders instead of the GT5's bolted-on fiberglass flares, and a smaller steel front air dam. The 'S' in the GT5-S name stood for \"steel\". Otherwise the GT5-S was largely identical to the GT5. The POCA 9000 series registrar's VIN analysis indicates that fewer than 183 GT5-S Panteras were built. Concurrent GTS production continued, on a custom order and very limited basis, until the late 1980s.\n\nThe car continued to use a Ford V8 engine, although in 1988, when the supply of Ford 351 Cleveland engines from Australia ran out, De Tomaso began installing [[Ford small block engine#351W|Ford 351 Windsor engines]] in the Pantera instead. In all, about 7,200 cars in total were built.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Pantera Si==\n[[File:1990 De Tomaso Pantera Si.jpg|thumb|DeTomaso Pantera Si]]\nFor 1990 the 351 engine was replaced by the Ford 302 engine {{cvt|302|cuin|L|abbr=on}} engine and the Pantera received new styling penned by [[Marcello Gandini]], suspension redesign and a partial chassis redesign. The new model was called the Pantera 90 Si and it was introduced in 1990. Only 38 90 Si models were sold before the Pantera was finally phased out in 1993 to make way for the radical [[De Tomaso Guar\u00e0|Guar\u00e0]]. Some sources state that 41 were built (with the last one not finished until 1996), of which four were targa models. The targas were converted by Pavesi directly off the production lines. In the UK, the model was sold as Pantera 90.\n\n==Specifications==\n[[File:De Tomaso Pantera Series II Front.jpg|thumb|right|A one-off second generation Pantera prototype made by [[Ghia]].<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com/2008\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2008/cars/others/de_tomaso/05/villa_deste/0205.html|date=2008-03-05 |title=Long Forgotten Pantera Prototype Resurfaces at Villa d'Este|accessdate=2008-07-18|work=italiaspeed.com/2008}}</ref>]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+[[Model year]]\n!Specification data\n!1971 L<ref name=\"1971L\">{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1971/695495/de_tomaso_pantera.html\n|title=1971 De Tomaso Pantera L\n|website=automobile-catalog.com\n|editor=Pawel Zal\n|accessdate=September 23, 2018}}</ref>\n!1988 GT5 S <ref name=\"GT5S\">{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1988/695810/de_tomaso_pantera_gt5s.html|title=1988 De Tomaso Pantera GT5 S (man. 5) specifications|website=automobile-catalog.com|language=en-us|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Engine configuration]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" |{{convert|351|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Naturally aspirated]] [[Ford 335 engine#351 Cleveland|Ford Cleveland V8]]\n|-\n|Fuel system\n|[[Autolite]] 4-barrel [[carburetor]]\n|[[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] 4-barrel carburetor\n|-\n|[[Curb weight]]\n|{{convert|3123|lb|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|3250|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|-\n|[[Wheelbase]]\n|{{convert|98.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|98.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|-\n|Front track\n|{{convert|57.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|59.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|-\n|Rear track\n|{{convert|58.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|62.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|-\n|Length\n|{{convert|158.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|168.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|-\n|Width\n|{{convert|67.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|77.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|-\n|Height\n|{{convert|43.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|43.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|-\n|[[Brake]]s\n|Front: 332 x 32 [[ventilated disc brake|ventilated discs]] and cross-drilled;<br/>Rear: 314 x 28 ventilated<br/>(1971 models had 15-inch wheels and brake rotors were smaller than {{convert|300|mm|in|1|abbr=on}})\n|Front: {{convert|284|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} ventilated;<br/>Rear: {{convert|297|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} ventilated<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1985-detomaso-pantera-gt5-s/\n|website=Supercars.net\n|title=1985 De Tomaso Pantera GT5-S}}</ref>\n|-\n|Power\n|{{convert|326|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,400 rpm\n|{{convert|350|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000 rpm\n|-\n|Torque\n|{{convert|466|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 3,500 rpm\n|{{convert|451|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 3,800 rpm\n|-\n|Fuel economy\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" |Highway (Extra-urban): {{convert|14.6|mpgus|1|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"1971L\"/><ref name=\"GT5S\"/><ref name=\"Willson2\">{{cite book|title=The Ultimate Classic Car Book|last=Willson|first=Quentin|publisher=DK Publishing, Inc.|year=1995|isbn=0-7894-0159-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ultimateclassicc00quen}}</ref>\n|-\n|Compression ratio\n|11.0:1\n|9.5:1\n|-\n|Gearbox\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" |5-speed [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] [[manual transmission]]\n|-\n|Maximum speed\n|{{convert|159|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Willson2\" />\n|{{convert|174|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}}<ref name=\"GT5S\"/>\n|}\n\n==Motorsports==\n===Group 3===\n[[File:Paris - Bonhams 2014 - De Tomaso Pantera Group 3 - 1972 - 001.jpg|thumb|left|A De Tomaso Pantera GTS Group 3 prototype]]\n\nDe Tomaso offered a Pantera competition car built to special order according to the Group 3 class racing rules between 1972 and 1984 based on the Pantera GTS. 30 cars were built for private customer teams. Group 3 rules were very strict and allowed little modifications to the original road going production cars. Earlier Group 3 cars are infamously called \"push button\" chassis cars as they were built by hand because De Tomaso didn't have a proper assembly line when the Pantera began production. Special equipment of the Group 3 cars included Campagnolo wheels (15 x 8 inches at the front and 15 x 10 inches at the rear), adjustable Koni shocks, racing brakes and special safety equipment required at the time: plexi-glass windows with cutouts, a roll bar, fire extinguisher and racing bucket seats. The engine modifications included a reinforced camshaft, a 10-litre oil pan and a Holley racing 4 barrel carburetor. Displacement of the engine was also enlarged to 5.8-litres. The engine had a power output of {{cvt|336|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The engine was mated to a 5-speed close ratio gearbox with a heavy duty single plate clutch and a limited slip differential. It was reported that with the long ratio gears, the Group 3 cars could achieve a top speed up to {{cvt|280|kph|mph|0|abbr=on}}. The Group 3 cars were so competitive that this prompted Porsche to speed up development of the more powerful 911 Carrera RS and Carrera RSR race cars. The use of racing brakes for the Pantera Group 3 was not allowed until 1975 and the car competed with the brakes of the road legal Pantera which proved to be its weak point. Due to an accident in 1973 at the Charade circuit, reinforced hubs developed by De Tomaso for the Group 3 car were approved in Group 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/17043/lot/136/?category=list|title=1973 DE TOMASO PANTERA GP3, 1973 De Tomaso Pantera Group 3 Coup\u00e9 Chassis no. 2006|date=2009-02-07|publisher=[[Bonhams]]|accessdate=2019-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://detomasodc.co.uk/pantera-gts|title=Pantera GTS|work=De Tomaso Driver's Club|accessdate=2019-07-05}}</ref>\n\n===Group 4===\n[[File:De Tomaso Pantera GTS Group 4 Gen1 000 1972 frontleft 2013-03-17 U.jpg|thumb|left|A De Tomaso Pantera GTS Group 4 competition car]]\n\nAfter the Pantera had begun production, De Tomaso introduced a motorsport oriented Group 3 version of the car. This was followed by a modified Group 4 version in 1972. British engineer and driver Mike Parkes, who had previously developed racing cars for Ferrari was tasked with the development of the new car.\n\nAs per the regulations, the Group 4 car was based around the road car's steel monocoque chassis. The double wishbone suspension was substantially modified and Koni adjustable shocks were used in order to improve handling at the track and make room for wider Campagnolo wheels and tyres. Bigger ventilated brakes supplied by Girling and a quick ratio steering rack were used to refine handling and stopping power. The standard steel body shell of the Pantera also received modifications such as aluminium doors, front lid and engine cover along with flared fibre glass wheel arches in order to accommodate the wide wheels and tyres. Plexi glass windows were used throughout and holes were cut into the chassis where possible in order to reduce weight. The car had no front or rear bumpers and a front deep chin spoiler. It also didn't had any rustproofing and interior amenities. The interior was fitted with a cut-off switch instead of a radio, light weight cloth bucket racing seats, a vinyl trim, a roll-cage and drilled aluminium pedals. The final car had a weight of {{cvt|1100|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nFord, providing a good amount of financial backing in the development of the road going Pantera had little interest in the motorsport version of the car and refused to supply engines for the Group 4 Pantera. De Tomaso engaged a private US based engine builder Bud Moore to supply engines for the car.\n\nBased on the same Ford 351 Cleveland V8 engine used in the road going Pantera, the engine in the Group 4 Pantera was fitted with bespoke aluminium heads, TRW forged pistons, large capacity oil pans and titanium valves. Initially, a single Holley Racing 1150 CFM four barrel carburetor was fitted but this was replaced by four Weber carburetors and a revised intake. The engine had a higher compression ratio of 12.0:1. Displacement of the racing engine was unchanged from road going Pantera's engine. The \"spaghetti\" styled exhaust system similar to the one used in the [[Ford GT40]] was used. The engine had a claimed power output of {{cvt|507|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. Although the cars ran at a power output of {{cvt|446|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000 rpm which was increased to {{cvt|477|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} when the Weber 850 CFM carburetors were used. The engine was mated to a ZF 5-speed close ratio manual transmission with a heavy duty single clutch plate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.janluehn.com/cars/1974-de-tomaso-pantera-group-4|title=De Tomaso Pantera Group 4|publisher=Jan B Leuhn|accessdate=2019-07-05}}</ref>\n\nThe first Group 4 Panteras were entered into the 1972 24 Hours of LeMans. The problems of the car then began to become apparent. The engine proved to be unreliable and the car was also subject to a weight penalty, increasing the weight to {{cvt|1250|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. This was set reportedly high due to [[Porsche]]'s influence over the governing body of the race. Another problem of the car was the rigidity of its chassis. Nevertheless, the car continued to compete in Group 4 and the engine problem was addressed by sourcing replacement engines with a lower compression ratio. A total of 14 Group 4 cars were made. Some Group 3 cars were modified to Group 4 specifications by privateers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimatecarpage.com/txt/6263/2/DeTomaso-Pantera-Group-4.html|title=De Tomaso Pantera Group 4|date=2015-06-17|first=Wouter|last=Melissen|publisher=Ultimate Car Page|accessdate=2019-07-05}}</ref>\n\n===Group 5===\n[[File:De Tomaso Pantera Mallory Park.JPG|thumb|right|De Tomaso Pantera Group 5 competition car]]\n\nThe Group 5 Pantera race cars were converted by private racing teams from Group 4 and Group 3 cars and competed in Group 5 class racing from 1976 to 1981. The Group 5 cars only had wider body panels and no significant design, mechanical and chassis modifications.\n\nHowever, two cars were extensively modified to compete in the IMSA GTX and Group 5 class respectively. The first car having chassis number #001 was constructed from a new chassis by Italian racing team Sala and Marveti. The second car, having chassis number #1603 was a Group 4 car campaigned by Hugh Kleinpeter in the US and then underwent modification. Afterwards, the former was converted to Group C class specifications in 1983 and the latter was converted to IMSA GTP class specifications respectively. Both cars were uncompetitive in their categories.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gr5pantera.com/gr-5-panteras|title=Gr 5 Panteras, 1976 - 1981|accessdate=2019-07-05}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[AMC AMX#AMX/3]] - first shown a month earlier, and sometimes confused with.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|De Tomaso Pantera}}\n* (August, 1971) ''[[Car and Driver]]''\n* [http://www.poca.com Pantera Owners Club of America]\n* [http://www.DeTomasoRegistry.org The DeTomaso Registry]\n* [http://carplusautoblog.com/de-tomaso-pantera-the-top-speed-car/ Tomaso Pantera Review]\n\n{{De Tomaso}}\n\n[[Category:De Tomaso vehicles|Pantera]]\n[[Category:Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Group 4 cars]]\n[[Category:1980s cars]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1970]]\n", "name_user": "Amagi82", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reorder specifications so they're consistent on both sides and easier to compare", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Tomaso_Pantera"}
