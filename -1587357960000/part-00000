Breen Jr.''' (September 5, 1928 &ndash; April 27, 1993) was an American [[numismatics|numismatist]], writer, [[LGBT rights activist]] and convicted [[Child sexual abuse|child sex offender]], and the husband of author [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]. He is known among [[Coin collecting|coin collectors]] for writing ''Walter Breen's Complete Encyclopedia of U.S. and Colonial Coins''. \"Breen numbers\", from his encyclopedia, are widely used to attribute varieties of coins. He is also known for activity in the [[science fiction]] [[science fiction fandom|fan community]] and for his writings in defense of [[pederasty]].\n\n==Early life==\nBreen was born in [[San Antonio, Texas]], the son of Walter Henry Breen Sr. and Mary Helena (Nellie) Brown Mehl.<ref>State of Texas, Texas Department of Health, Birth Certificate #68982</ref> He spent the first several years of his life in Texas with his parents.<ref>US Census 1930: Precinct 1, Brooks, Texas; Enumeration District 2, Page 10B</ref>\n\nAt the time they met, both of Walter's parents were married to other people and living next door to each other in [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]]. Walter's father changed his own name from Walter H. Green to Breen after abandoning his wife and children to run away with Walter's mother. Later in life, Breen sometimes denied they were his birth parents and claimed to have been adopted by them as a [[Child abandonment|foundling]] child. In reminiscences he spoke of being raised in a variety of \"institutional and foster settings.\"<ref name=\"williamapercy.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/images/Walter_h._breen.pdf|title=Walter H.

Walter's father was by that time living with another woman in Chicago; for a while after their separation his mother resumed her maiden name and young Walter went by the name William Brown.\n\nBreen strove to distinguish himself academically from a young age, attending a Catholic high school in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and continued excelling academically throughout his postsecondary education. After being declared unfit for service by the [[Army Air Force]] in April 1946, Breen was accepted that October with a recorded [[IQ]] of 144;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coinbooks.org/esylum_v13n42a08.html|title=On Mensa And Walter Breens IQ|publisher=Coinbooks.org|accessdate=2014-04-09}}</ref> following a severe beating,<ref name=\"web.archive.org\">{{cite web|url=http://coins.ha.com/common/features/numisarticles.php?id=225|title=Numismatic Articles|publisher=Web.archive.org|date=2008-01-05|accessdate=2014-04-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105012350/http://coins.ha.com/common/features/numisarticles.php?id=225|archivedate=January 5, 2008}}</ref> he was honorably discharged that December.\n\nDuring his recovery, he read voluminously about rare coins and initiated correspondence with various members of the [[numismatics]] community, renewing his involvement in a hobby in which he had been actively engaged a few years earlier.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/> Alternatively, Breen claimed that a severe head injury suffered in a World War II plane crash led to the development of his [[photographic memory]].<ref name=\"scvhistory.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/signal/coins/soltaylor071908.html|title=Walter Breen: Enigmatic Numismatist|publisher=Scvhistory.com|date=2008-07-19|accessdate=2014-04-09}}</ref>\n\nHe received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[mathematics]] from [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1952.

After graduating [[Phi Beta Kappa]], he took a position as an auction cataloger for the New Netherland Coin Company while concurrently enrolled in pre-med courses at [[Columbia University]], where he became a protege of the controversial psychologist and numismatist [[William Herbert Sheldon]].\n\nDuring this period, physicist [[Jack Sarfatti]] (who later sponsored guest workshops by Breen at meetings of the Physics/Consciousness Research Group at the [[Esalen Institute]] in 1976) alleges that Breen coordinated [[Sandia National Laboratories]]-funded [[parapsychological]] research studies of New York City [[gifted]] children (so-called \"superkids,\" including Sarfatti and Robert Bashlow) in Sheldon's Constitutional Laboratory at [[Columbia Medical School]] from 1953-56.<ref name=\"praxisforlife.org\">{{cite web|url=http://praxisforlife.org/?p=446|title=Coming Soon|publisher=Praxisforlife.org|accessdate=2014-04-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226135736/http://praxisforlife.org/?p=446|archivedate=2013-12-26}}</ref>\n\nSarfatti's tales are not corroborated by any reliable source, but they do mirror a longtime interest Breen had in studying high-IQ youth, which included taking out advertisements in the early 1960s for a projected private school for gifted children which Breen hoped to launch in New York City, a project which came to nothing in the end. William Sheldon worked closely with Breen on a number of coin-related projects in the 1950s, including the book ''Penny Whimsy'', and although Sheldon encouraged Breen to attend medical school, he eventually distanced himself from the scientist, allegedly, per Breen in an interview, in part due to Sheldon's professed [[anti-Semitism]].<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/>\n\nBreen eventually enrolled in the [[sociology]] graduate program at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he claimed to have researched \"the [[Beat Generation]] groups on both coasts but also some of the very earliest hippies, finding out incidentally that some ideas that the bunch of us had developed in science fiction fandom had gotten into the hippie subculture and were being paraded around as their own inventions.\"<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/> He received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in the sociology of music from the institution in 1966.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Writings==\nIn 1951, the journal ''[[Numismatist (magazine)|Numismatist]]'' published his earliest numismatics writings.

This may be done either before (''ante hoc'') or after (''post hoc'') the text has been published or otherwise disseminated.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fellmeth |first1=Aaron X. |last2=Horwitz |first2=Maurice |chapter=Ante hoc |chapterurl=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195369380.001.0001/acref-9780195369380-e-221 |title=Guide to Latin in International Law |doi=10.1093/acref/9780195369380.001.0001 |isbn=978-0-19-536938-0 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 }}</ref> Fact-checking may be done privately, such as when a magazine editor wants to verify the contents of a news article, either before or after publication. This is called '''internal fact-checking'''. Alternatively, the fact-checking analysis may be published, in which case it is called '''external fact-checking'''.<ref name=OxfordUniversity>{{Citation|last=Graves|first=Lucas|title=Fact-Checking as Idea and Practice in Journalism|date=25 February 2019|encyclopedia=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Communication|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.013.808|isbn=9780190228613|last2=Amazeen|first2=Michelle A.}}</ref>\n\n'''Ante hoc fact-checking''' (fact-checking before dissemination) aims to remove errors and allow text to proceed to dissemination (or to rejection if it fails confirmations or other criteria). '''Post hoc fact-checking''' is most often followed by a written report of inaccuracies, sometimes with a visual metric from the checking organization (e.g., [[#Organizations and individuals|Pinocchios]] from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' ''Fact Checker,'' or ''TRUTH-O-METER'' ratings from [[PolitiFact]]). Several organizations are devoted to ''post hoc'' fact-checking, such as [[FactCheck.org]] and [[PolitiFact.com|PolitiFact]].\n\nExternal ''post hoc'' fact-checking organizations first arose in the US in the early 2000s,<ref name=OxfordUniversity/> though the concept first grew in relevance and spread to multiple countries during the 2010s.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/module_5.pdf|title=Fact-Checking 101 - Unesco|last=Alexios Mantzarlis|first=|date=2018|website=en.unesco.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301190556/https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/module_5.pdf|archive-date=1 March 2020|access-date=19 January 2020}}</ref> The US remains the largest market for fact-checking.<ref name=\":2\" /> Research on the impact of fact-checking is relatively recent, but the existing research suggests that fact-checking does indeed correct perceptions among citizens as well as discourage politicians from spreading false or misleading claims. {{citation needed|April 2020}}\n\n== ''Post hoc'' fact-checking ==\nExternal ''post hoc'' fact-checking by independent organizations began in the United States in the early 2000s.<ref name=OxfordUniversity/> In the 2010s, particularly following the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election of Donald Trump as US President]], fact-checking gained a rise in popularity and spread to multiple countries mostly in Europe and Latin America.

These problems can include lawsuits for mistakes that damage people or businesses, but even small mistakes can cause a loss of reputation for the publication. The loss of reputation is often the more significant motivating factor for journalists.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nFact checkers verify that the names, dates, and facts in an article or book are correct.<ref name=\":6\" /> For example, they may contact a person who is quoted in a proposed news article and ask the person whether this quotation is correct, or how to spell the person's name. Fact-checkers are primarily useful in catching accidental mistakes; they are not guaranteed safeguards against those who wish to commit [[journalistic fraud]]s.\n\n=== As a career ===\nProfessional fact checkers have generally been hired by newspapers, magazines, and book publishers, probably starting in the early 1920s with the creation of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine in the United States,<ref name=OxfordUniversity/><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=The Fact Checker's Bible: A Guide to Getting it Right|last=Harrison Smith|first=Sarah|date=2004|publisher=Anchor Books|isbn=0385721064|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/factcheckersbibl00smit/page/8 8\u201312]|oclc=53919260|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/factcheckersbibl00smit/page/8}}</ref> though they were not originally called \"fact-checkers\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/4858683/fact-checking-history/|title=The Story Behind the First-Ever Fact-Checkers|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2020-01-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200116003117/https://time.com/4858683/fact-checking-history/|archive-date=16 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Fact checkers may be aspiring writers, future editors, or [[freelancer]]s engaged other projects; others are career professionals.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nHistorically, the field was considered [[women's work]], and from the time of the first professional American fact checker through at least the 1970s, the fact checkers at a media company might be entirely female or primarily so.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nThe number of people employed in fact-checking varies by publication.

Fact-checkers are primarily useful in catching accidental mistakes; they are not guaranteed safeguards against those who wish to commit [[journalistic fraud]]s.\n\n=== As a career ===\nProfessional fact checkers have generally been hired by newspapers, magazines, and book publishers, probably starting in the early 1920s with the creation of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine in the United States,<ref name=OxfordUniversity/><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=The Fact Checker's Bible: A Guide to Getting it Right|last=Harrison Smith|first=Sarah|date=2004|publisher=Anchor Books|isbn=0385721064|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/factcheckersbibl00smit/page/8 8\u201312]|oclc=53919260|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/factcheckersbibl00smit/page/8}}</ref> though they were not originally called \"fact-checkers\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/4858683/fact-checking-history/|title=The Story Behind the First-Ever Fact-Checkers|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2020-01-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200116003117/https://time.com/4858683/fact-checking-history/|archive-date=16 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Fact checkers may be aspiring writers, future editors, or [[freelancer]]s engaged other projects; others are career professionals.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nHistorically, the field was considered [[women's work]], and from the time of the first professional American fact checker through at least the 1970s, the fact checkers at a media company might be entirely female or primarily so.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nThe number of people employed in fact-checking varies by publication. Some organizations have substantial fact-checking departments. For example, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine had 16 fact checkers in 2003.<ref name=\":6\"/> Others may hire freelancers per piece, or may combine fact-checking with other duties. Magazines are more likely to use fact checkers than newspapers.<ref name=OxfordUniversity/> Television and radio programs rarely employ dedicated fact checkers, and instead expect others, including senior staff, to engage in fact-checking in addition to their other duties.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\n===Checking original reportage===\n[[Stephen Glass (reporter)|Stephen Glass]] began his journalism career as a fact-checker. He went on to invent fictitious stories, which he submitted as [[reportage]], and which fact-checkers at ''[[The New Republic]]'' (and other weeklies for which he worked) never flagged. [[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]], who edited some of Glass's concocted stories, blamed himself, rather than the fact-checkers, saying: \"Any fact-checking system is built on trust ... If a reporter is willing to fake notes, it defeats the system. Anyway, the real vetting system is not fact-checking but the editor.\"<ref>{{cite web |author=John Watson |url=https://factchecksrilanka.com/2017/04/02/what-is-fact-checking/ |title=What is Fact Checking? \u2013 FactCheck Sri Lanka |publisher=Factchecksrilanka.com |date=2 April 2017 |accessdate=7 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107015349/https://factchecksrilanka.com/2017/04/02/what-is-fact-checking/ |archive-date=7 November 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Education on fact-checking ===\nWith the circulation of fake news on the internet, many organizations have dedicated time to create guidelines to help read to verify the information they are consuming. Many universities across America provide university students resources and tools to help them verify their sources. Universities provide access to research guides that help students conduct thorough research with reputable sources within academia. Organizations like [[FactCheck.org]], OntheMedia.org, and [[PolitiFact|PolitiFact.com]] provide procedural guidelines that help individuals navigate the process to fact-check a source.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Books on professional fact-checking===\n* Sarah Harrison Smith spent some time and also headed the fact-checking department for ''[[The New York Times]]''.

From 1983 until 2001, Sega also developed [[video game console]]s.\n\nSega was founded by Martin Bromley and Richard Stewart as {{nihongo foot|Nihon Goraku Bussan|\u65e5\u672c\u5a2f\u697d\u7269\u7523\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha|Nihon goraku bussan kabushiki gaisha|extra=Japanese Amusement Products Co., Ltd.}} on June 3, 1960; shortly after, the company acquired the assets of its predecessor, Service Games of Japan. Five years later, the company became known as Sega Enterprises, Ltd. after acquiring Rosen Enterprises, an importer of [[Arcade game|coin-operated games]]. Sega developed its first coin-operated game, ''[[Periscope (arcade game)|Periscope]]'', in the late 1960s. In an effort to become a [[Public company|publicly traded company]], Sega was sold to [[Gulf and Western Industries]] in 1969. Following a downturn in the arcade business in the early 1980s, Sega began to develop video game consoles, starting with the [[SG-1000]] and [[Master System]], but struggled against competitors such as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].  In 1984, Sega executives [[David Rosen (businessman)|David Rosen]] and [[Hayao Nakayama]] led a management buyout of the company with backing from [[SCSK|CSK Corporation]].\n\nSega released its next console, the [[Sega Genesis]] (known as the Mega Drive outside North America), in 1988. Although it was a distant third in Japan, the Genesis found major success after the release of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' in 1991 and briefly outsold its main competitor, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], in the U.S. However, later in the decade, Sega suffered [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failures]] such as the [[32X]], [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]], and [[Dreamcast]] consoles. In 2001, Sega stopped manufacturing consoles to become a [[third-party developer]] and publisher, and was acquired by [[Sammy Corporation]] in 2004. In the years since the acquisition, Sega has been more profitable.  Sega Holdings Co. Ltd. was established in 2015, with Sega Corporation being renamed Sega Games Co., Ltd. and its arcade, entertainment, and toy divisions separated into other companies.  Sega Games and Sega Interactive were merged in 2020 and renamed to Sega Corporation.\n\nSega produces [[List of best-selling video game franchises|multi-million-selling game franchises]] including ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', ''[[Total War (video game series)|Total War]]'', and ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]],'' and is the world's most prolific arcade game producer. It also operates [[amusement arcade]]s and produces other entertainment products, including [[Sega Toys]]. As a company, Sega is retrospectively remembered for its time supporting its own video game consoles, its creativity, and its innovations.

Its international branches, Sega of America and Sega Europe, are respectively headquartered in [[Irvine, California]], and London.  Sega's arcade division existed as '''Sega Interactive Co., Ltd.''' from 2015 to 2020.  Sega is a subsidiary of '''Sega Group Corporation''', which is in turn a part of [[Sega Sammy Holdings]].  From 1983 until 2001, Sega also developed [[video game console]]s.\n\nSega was founded by Martin Bromley and Richard Stewart as {{nihongo foot|Nihon Goraku Bussan|\u65e5\u672c\u5a2f\u697d\u7269\u7523\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha|Nihon goraku bussan kabushiki gaisha|extra=Japanese Amusement Products Co., Ltd.}} on June 3, 1960; shortly after, the company acquired the assets of its predecessor, Service Games of Japan. Five years later, the company became known as Sega Enterprises, Ltd. after acquiring Rosen Enterprises, an importer of [[Arcade game|coin-operated games]]. Sega developed its first coin-operated game, ''[[Periscope (arcade game)|Periscope]]'', in the late 1960s. In an effort to become a [[Public company|publicly traded company]], Sega was sold to [[Gulf and Western Industries]] in 1969. Following a downturn in the arcade business in the early 1980s, Sega began to develop video game consoles, starting with the [[SG-1000]] and [[Master System]], but struggled against competitors such as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].  In 1984, Sega executives [[David Rosen (businessman)|David Rosen]] and [[Hayao Nakayama]] led a management buyout of the company with backing from [[SCSK|CSK Corporation]].\n\nSega released its next console, the [[Sega Genesis]] (known as the Mega Drive outside North America), in 1988. Although it was a distant third in Japan, the Genesis found major success after the release of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' in 1991 and briefly outsold its main competitor, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], in the U.S. However, later in the decade, Sega suffered [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failures]] such as the [[32X]], [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]], and [[Dreamcast]] consoles. In 2001, Sega stopped manufacturing consoles to become a [[third-party developer]] and publisher, and was acquired by [[Sammy Corporation]] in 2004. In the years since the acquisition, Sega has been more profitable.  Sega Holdings Co. Ltd. was established in 2015, with Sega Corporation being renamed Sega Games Co., Ltd. and its arcade, entertainment, and toy divisions separated into other companies.  Sega Games and Sega Interactive were merged in 2020 and renamed to Sega Corporation.\n\nSega produces [[List of best-selling video game franchises|multi-million-selling game franchises]] including ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', ''[[Total War (video game series)|Total War]]'', and ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]],'' and is the world's most prolific arcade game producer. It also operates [[amusement arcade]]s and produces other entertainment products, including [[Sega Toys]]. As a company, Sega is retrospectively remembered for its time supporting its own video game consoles, its creativity, and its innovations. In more recent years, it has been criticized for its business decisions and changes in research and development creativity.\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Sega}}\n\n===Origins and arcade success (1940\u20131982)===\n[[File:Slot machines at Wookey Hole Caves.JPG|thumb|The Diamond 3 Star, a model of coin-operated slot machines produced by Sega in the 1950s|left|alt=Diamond 3 Star slot machines]]\nIn 1940, American businessmen Martin Bromley, Irving Bromberg, and James Humpert formed Standard Games in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii.
