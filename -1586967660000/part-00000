The U.S. and a coalition of six Caribbean nations attacked the island nation of [[Grenada]], {{convert|100|mi}} north of [[Venezuela]]. Codenamed '''Operation Urgent Fury''', the multinational intervention resulted in an allied victory within a matter of days. It was triggered by the strife within the [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Government]] which resulted in the house arrest and execution of the previous leader and second Prime Minister of Grenada [[Maurice Bishop]], and the establishment of the Revolutionary Military Council with [[Hudson Austin]] as Chairman. The invasion resulted in the appointment of an interim government, followed by democratic elections in 1984. The country has remained a democratic nation since then.\n\nGrenada had gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1974. The Communist [[New Jewel Movement]] seized power in a coup in 1979 under [[Maurice Bishop]], suspending the constitution and detaining several political prisoners. In September, 1983, an internal power struggle began over Bishop's leadership performance.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/grenadapapers00ssou|title=The Grenada papers|date=1984|publisher=Institute for Contemporary Studies|others=Seabury, Paul., McDougall, Walter A., 1946-|isbn=0-917616-68-5|location=San Francisco, Calif.|oclc=11233840|url-access=registration}}</ref> Bishop was pressured at a party meeting to share power with Deputy Prime Minister Bernard Coard. Bishop initially agreed, but later balked. He was put under house arrest by his own party's Central Committee until he relented. When his secret detention became widely known, Bishop was freed by an aroused crowd of his supporters. A confrontation then ensued at military headquarters between Grenadian soldiers loyal to Coard and civilians supporting Bishop. Shooting started under still-disputed circumstances. At least 19 soldiers and civilians were killed on 19 October 1983 including Bishop, his partner [[Jacqueline Creft]], two other cabinet ministers and two union leaders. \n\nThe [[Reagan Administration]] in the U.S. launched a military intervention following receipt of a formal appeal for help from the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]]. In addition, Grenada's Governor General [[Paul Scoon]] secretly signaled he would also support outside intervention, but he put off signing a letter of invitation until 26 October.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Survival for service : my experiences as Governor General of Grenada|last=Scoon, Paul, Sir, 1935-2013.|date=2003|publisher=Macmillan Caribbean|isbn=0-333-97064-0|location=Oxford, England|pages=136 and 145|oclc=54489557}}</ref> Reagan also acted due to \"concerns over the 600 U.S. medical students on the island\" and fears of a repeat of the [[Iran hostage crisis]].\n\nThe invasion began on the morning of 25 October 1983, just two days after the bombing of the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut]].

Austin's military government was deposed and replaced, with Scoon as Governor-General, by an interim advisory council until the 1984 elections.\n\nThe invasion was criticized by many countries including Canada. British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] privately disapproved of the mission and the lack of notice that she received, but she publicly supported it.<ref>Charles Moore, ''Margaret Thatcher: At her Zenith'' (2016) p. 130.</ref> The United Nations General Assembly condemned it as \"a flagrant violation of international law\" on 2 November 1983 with a vote of 108 to 9.<ref name=UN_GA_Resolution_38_7>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/38/7|title=United Nations General Assembly resolution 38/7 |publisher=United Nations |date= 2 November 1983 | access-date =5 March 2016}}</ref> Conversely, there was broad public support in the United States,<ref name=Magnuson>{{cite news| last=Magnuson |first=Ed |title=Getting Back to Normal |newspaper=Time |date=21 November 1983 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926318-1,00.html}}</ref> and the Grenadian population approved of American intervention, appreciating the fact that there had been relatively few civilian casualties, as well as the return to democratic elections in 1984.<ref name=\"AP 2012\">[http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/06/08/grenada-trying-to-find-remains-slain-marxist-pm.html Associated Press report in 2012, printed in Fox News]</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Age of Reagan: The Conservative Counterrevolution: 1980\u20131989|publisher=Crown Forum|isbn=978-1-4000-5357-5|author=Steven F.

The British government proposed the airport in 1954 when Grenada was still a British colony. Canadians designed it, the British government underwrote it, and a London firm built it. The American government accused Grenada of constructing facilities to aid a Soviet-Cuban military buildup in the Caribbean based on the {{convert|9000|ft|m|adj=on}} runway which could accommodate the largest Soviet aircraft, such as the [[An-12]], [[An-22]], and the [[An-124]]. Such a facility would enhance the Soviet and Cuban transportation of weapons to Central American insurgents and expand Soviet regional influence. Bishop's government claimed that the airport was built to accommodate commercial aircraft carrying tourists, pointing out that such jets could not land at Pearls Airport on the island's north end (5,200 feet), and that Pearls could not be expanded because its runway abutted a mountain at one end and the ocean at the other.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/grenadarevolutio0000payn/page/31|title=Grenada : revolution and invasion|last=Payne, Anthony, 1952-|date=1984|publisher=St. Martin's Press|others=Sutton, Paul K., Thorndike, Tony.|isbn=0-312-35042-2|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/grenadarevolutio0000payn/page/31 31]|oclc=10548141}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Point Salinas International Airport, Grenada.jpg|thumb|Point Salines International Airport, Grenada]]\n\nIn 1983, Representative [[Ron Dellums]] (D, California) traveled to Grenada on a fact-finding mission, having been invited by the country's prime minister. He described his findings before Congress:\n\n<blockquote>Based on my personal observations, discussion, and analysis of the new international airport under construction in Grenada, it is my conclusion that this project is specifically now and has always been for the purpose of economic development and is not for military use\u2026.

He said that the runway and the numerous fuel storage tanks were unnecessary for commercial flights, and that evidence indicated that the airport was to become a Cuban-Soviet forward military airbase.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30C12F6385D0C758EDDAA0894DB484D81&scp=20&sq=grenada&st=nyt|title=Grenada|last=Gailey|first=Phil|date=26 March 1983|work=New York Times|author2=Warren Weaver Jr.|accessdate=11 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn 29 May 2009, the Grenadian government changed the name of Point Salines International Airport to [[Maurice Bishop International Airport]].<ref name=\"airport_rename1\">\n{{cite web\n | title= St. Vincent's Prime Minister to officiate at renaming of Grenada international airport\n | date= 26 May 2009\n | publisher= Caribbean Net News newspaper\n | url= http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-16694--32-32--.html\n}}\n{{dead link|date=November 2016}}\n</ref><ref name=\"airport_rename2\">\n{{cite web\n | title= Bishop's Honour: Grenada airport renamed after ex-PM\n | date= 30 May 2009\n | publisher= [[Caribbean News Agency]] (CANA)\n | url= http://www.cananews.net/news/131/ARTICLE/38264/2009-05-30.html\n | url-status= dead\n | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090612200521/http://www.cananews.net/news/131/ARTICLE/38264/2009-05-30.html\n | archive-date= 12 June 2009\n | df= dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\n=== October 1983 ===\nOn 16 October 1983, Deputy Prime Minister [[Bernard Coard]] seized power and placed Bishop under house arrest.

But the Rangers had to switch abruptly to a parachute landing when they learned mid-flight that the runway was obstructed. The air drop began at 05:30 on 25 October in the face of moderate resistance from [[ZU-23]] anti-aircraft guns and several BTR-60 APCs, which were knocked out by [[M67 recoilless rifle]] fire. [[AC-130]] gunships provided support for the landing. Cuban construction vehicles were commandeered to help clear the airfield, and one was even used to provide mobile cover for the Rangers as they moved to seize the heights surrounding the airfield.<ref name=Stuart>{{cite book|last1=Stuart|first1=Richard W.|title=Operation Urgent Fury: The Invasion of Grenada, October 1983|date=2008|publisher=U.S. Army|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/grenada/urgent_fury.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThey cleared the airstrip of obstructions by 10 AM, and transport planes were able to land and unload additional reinforcements, including [[M151]] Jeeps and members of the [[Caribbean Peace Force]] who were assigned to guard the perimeter and detainees. Starting at 14:00, units began landing at Point Salines from the [[82nd Airborne Division]] under [[Edward Trobaugh]], including battalions of the [[325th Infantry Regiment]]. At 15:30, three BTR-60s of the Grenadian Army Motorized Company counter-attacked, but the Americans repelled them with recoilless rifles and an AC-130.<ref name=CombatReform>{{cite web|title=Turning the Tide: Operation Urgent Fury|url=http://www.combatreform.org/grenada.htm|website=Combat Reform|accessdate=6 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Rangers fanned out and secured the surrounding area, including negotiating the surrender of more than 100 Cubans in an aviation hangar. However, a Jeep-mounted Ranger patrol became lost searching for [[Saint George's University|True Blue Campus]] and was ambushed, with four killed. The Rangers eventually secured True Blue campus and its students, where they found only 140 students and were told that more were at another campus in Grand Anse. In all, the Rangers lost five men on the first day, but succeeded in securing Point Salines and the surrounding area.<ref name=Stuart />\n\n===Capture of Pearls Airport===\nA platoon of Navy SEALs from SEAL Team 4 under Lieutenant Mike Walsh approached the beach near [[Pearls Airport]] around midnight on 24 October after evading patrol boats and overcoming stormy weather. They found that the beach was undefended but unsuitable for an amphibious landing. The 2nd Battalion of the [[8th Marine Regiment]] then landed south of Pearls Airport using [[Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight|CH-46 Sea Knight]] and [[CH-53 Sea Stallion]] helicopters at 05:30 on 25 October; they captured Pearls Airport, encountering only light resistance, including a [[DShK]] machine gun which a Marine [[AH-1 Cobra]] destroyed.<ref name=Kreisher>{{cite web|last1=Kreisher|first1=Otto|title=Operation URGENT FURY \u2013 Grenada|url=https://www.mca-marines.org/leatherneck/operation-urgent-fury-grenada|publisher=Marine Corps Association & Foundation}}</ref>\n\n===Raid on Radio Free Grenada===\n[[UH-60 Blackhawk]] helicopters delivered [[SEAL Team 6]] operators in the early morning of 25 October to Radio Free Grenada with the purpose of using the radio station for [[PsyOps|psychological operations]]. They captured the station unopposed and destroyed the radio transmitter. However, they were attacked by Grenadian forces in cars and an armored personnel carrier (APC), which forced the lightly armed SEALs to cut a fence and retreat into the ocean as they received fire from the APC. The SEALs swam to the [[USS Caron]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://public2.nhhcaws.local/content/history/nhhc/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/c/caron--dd-970-.html|title=Caron (DD-970)|website=public2.nhhcaws.local|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-26}}</ref> At least two were seriously wounded and bleeding, one with a shoulder injury and the other with a calf injury.

The raid on Richmond Hill Prison lacked vital intelligence, including the fact that several anti-aircraft guns defended it, and that the prison was on a steep hill without room for a helicopter to land. Anti-aircraft fire wounded passengers and crew and forced one MH-60 helicopter to crash land, causing another helicopter to land next to it to protect the survivors. One pilot was killed, and the Delta Force operators had to be relieved by a Navy Sea King helicopter.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The U.S. Invasion of Grenada : legacy of a flawed victory|last=Kukielski|first=Philip|publisher=McFarland & Company|year=2019|isbn=978-1-4766-7879-5|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=66\u201368|oclc=1123182247}}</ref> The raid on Fort Rupert, however, was successful in capturing several leaders of the People's Revolutionary Government.<ref name=\"CombatReform\"/>\n\n===Mission to rescue Governor General Scoon===\n[[File:AH-1S firing cannon Grenada 1983.JPEG|thumb|A U.S. Army AH-1S Cobra attack helicopter opens fire on an enemy position]]\n\nThe last major special operation was a mission to rescue Governor General Scoon from his mansion in [[Saint George, Grenada]]. The mission departed late at 05:30 on 25 October from Barbados, resulting in the Grenadian forces being already aware of the invasion and they guarded Scoon closely. The SEAL team entered the mansion without opposition, but [[BTR-60]] armored personnel carriers counter-attacked and trapped the SEALs and the governor inside. [[AC-130]] gunships, [[A-7 Corsair]] strike planes, and [[AH-1 Cobra]] attack helicopters were called in to support the besieged SEALs, but the SEALs remained trapped for the next 24 hours.\n\nAt 19:00 on 25 October, 250 Marines from G Company of the [[22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit|22nd Marine Assault Unit]] landed at Grand Mal Bay equipped with [[Assault Amphibious Vehicle|amphibious assault vehicles]] and four [[M60 Patton]] tanks; they relieved the Navy SEALs the following morning, allowing Governor Scoon, his wife, and nine aides to be safely evacuated at 10:00 that day. The Marine tank crews continued advancing in the face of sporadic resistance, knocking out a BRDM-2 armored car.<ref name=\"Russell\" /> G Company subsequently defeated and overwhelmed the Grenadian defenders at Fort Frederick.<ref name=\"Kreisher\" />\n\n=== Airstrikes ===\nNavy [[A-7 Corsair]]s and Marine [[AH-1 Cobra]] attack helicopters made airstrikes against Fort Rupert and Fort Frederick. An A-7 raid on Fort Frederick targeting anti-aircraft guns hit a nearby mental hospital, killing 18 civilians.<ref name=\"dtic\" />{{rp|62}} Two Marine AH-1T Cobras and a UH-60 Blackhawk were shot down in a raid against Fort Frederick, resulting in five casualties.<ref name=\"Kreisher\" />\n\n==Second day of the invasion==\n[[File:Op Urgent Fury Invasion Map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Initial troop invasion areas]]\n\nGeneral Trobaugh of the 82nd Airborne Division had two goals on the second day: securing the perimeter around Salines Airport, and rescuing American students held in Grand Anse. The Army lacked undamaged helicopters after the losses on the first day and consequently had to delay the student rescue until they made contact with Marine forces.\n\n===Attack on the Cuban compound===\nEarly on the morning of 26 October, Cuban forces ambushed a patrol from the 2nd Battalion of the 325th Infantry Regiment near the village of Calliste. The American patrol suffered six wounded and two killed, including the commander of Company B. Navy airstrikes and an artillery bombardment by [[M102 howitzer|105mm howitzers]] targeting the main Cuban encampment eventually led to their surrender at 08:30. American forces pushed on to the village of Frequente, where they discovered a Cuban weapons cache reportedly sufficient to equip six battalions. Cuban forces ambushed a reconnaissance platoon who were mounted on gun-jeeps, but the jeeps returned fire, and a nearby infantry unit added mortar fire; the Cubans suffered four casualties with no American losses. Cuban resistance largely ended after these engagements.<ref name=\"Stuart\" />\n\n===Rescue at Grand Anse===\nOn the afternoon of 26 October, Rangers of the 2nd Battalion of the Ranger Regiment mounted Marine [[CH-46 Sea Knight]] helicopters to launch an air assault on the Grand Anse campus. The campus guards offered light resistance before fleeing, wounding one Ranger, and one of the helicopters crashed on the approach after its blade hit a palm tree. The Rangers evacuated the 233 American students by [[CH-53 Sea Stallion]] helicopters, but the students informed them that there was a third campus with Americans at Prickly Bay.<ref name=\"Kreisher\" /> A squad of 11 Rangers was accidentally left behind; they departed on a rubber raft which was picked up by {{USS|Caron}} at 23:00.<ref name=\"CombatReform\" />\n\n==Third day of the invasion and after==\n[[File:Explosion2 during Grenada invasion 1983.JPEG|thumb|Bombardment of Point Calivigny]]\n\nBy 27 October, organized resistance was rapidly diminishing, but the American forces did not yet realize this. The Marine 22nd MAU and 8th Regiment continued advancing along the coast and capturing additional towns, meeting little resistance, although one patrol did encounter a single [[BTR-60]] during the night and dispatched it with a [[M72 LAW]]. The 325th Infantry Regiment advanced toward Saint George, capturing Grand Anse and discovering 200 American students whom they had missed the first day. They continued to the town of Ruth Howard and the capital of Saint George, meeting only scattered resistance. An air-naval gunfire liaison team called in an A-7 airstrike and accidentally hit the command post of the 2nd Brigade, wounding 17 troops, one of whom died.<ref name=\"Stuart\" />\n\nThe Army had reports that PRA forces were amassing at the Calivigny Barracks, only five kilometers from the Point Salines airfield. They organized an air assault by the 2nd Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment preceded by a preparatory bombardment by field howitzers (which mostly missed, their shells falling into the ocean), [[A-7 Corsair]]s, [[AC-130]]s, and USS ''Caron''. However, the [[UH-60 Blackhawk|Blackhawk]] helicopters began dropping off troops near the barracks but they approached too fast. One of them crash-landed and the two behind it collided with it, killing three and wounding four. The barracks were deserted.<ref name=\"CombatReform\" />\n\nIn the following days, resistance ended entirely and the Army and Marines spread across the island, arresting PRA officials, seizing caches of weapons, and seeing to the repatriation of Cuban engineers. On 1 November, two companies from the 22nd Marine Amphibious Unit made a combined sea and helicopter landing on the island of [[Carriacou]] {{convert|17|mi}} northeast of Grenada. The 19 Grenadian soldiers defending the island surrendered without a fight. This was the last military action of the campaign.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.mca-marines.org/leatherneck/operation-urgent-fury-grenada |title=Operation URGENT FURY \u2013 Grenada |last=Kreisher |first=Otto |date=October 2003 |website=Marine Corps Association and Foundation | accessdate=28 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Outcome==\n[[File:CH46SeaKnight Grenada 1983.JPG|thumb|A Marine Corps [[Sea Knight]] helicopter sits on the beach after being disabled during the Grand Anse rescue on 26 October 1983]]\nOfficial U.S. sources state that some of the opponents were well prepared and well positioned and put up stubborn resistance, to the extent that the Americans called in two battalions of reinforcements on the evening of 26 October. The total naval and air superiority of the American forces had overwhelmed the defenders. Nearly 8,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines had participated in Operation Urgent Fury along with 353 Caribbean allies of the [[Caribbean Peace Force]]s. American forces sustained 19 killed and 116 wounded; Cuban forces sustained 25 killed, 59 wounded, and 638 combatants captured.

The invasion resulted in the appointment of an interim government, followed by democratic elections in 1984. The country has remained a democratic nation since then.\n\nGrenada had gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1974. The Communist [[New Jewel Movement]] seized power in a coup in 1979 under [[Maurice Bishop]], suspending the constitution and detaining several political prisoners. In September, 1983, an internal power struggle began over Bishop's leadership performance.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/grenadapapers00ssou|title=The Grenada papers|date=1984|publisher=Institute for Contemporary Studies|others=Seabury, Paul., McDougall, Walter A., 1946-|isbn=0-917616-68-5|location=San Francisco, Calif.|oclc=11233840|url-access=registration}}</ref> Bishop was pressured at a party meeting to share power with Deputy Prime Minister Bernard Coard. Bishop initially agreed, but later balked. He was put under house arrest by his own party's Central Committee until he relented. When his secret detention became widely known, Bishop was freed by an aroused crowd of his supporters. A confrontation then ensued at military headquarters between Grenadian soldiers loyal to Coard and civilians supporting Bishop. Shooting started under still-disputed circumstances. At least 19 soldiers and civilians were killed on 19 October 1983 including Bishop, his partner [[Jacqueline Creft]], two other cabinet ministers and two union leaders. \n\nThe [[Reagan Administration]] in the U.S. launched a military intervention following receipt of a formal appeal for help from the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]].

The British government proposed the airport in 1954 when Grenada was still a British colony. Canadians designed it, the British government underwrote it, and a London firm built it. The American government accused Grenada of constructing facilities to aid a Soviet-Cuban military buildup in the Caribbean based on the {{convert|9000|ft|m|adj=on}} runway which could accommodate the largest Soviet aircraft, such as the [[An-12]], [[An-22]], and the [[An-124]]. Such a facility would enhance the Soviet and Cuban transportation of weapons to Central American insurgents and expand Soviet regional influence. Bishop's government claimed that the airport was built to accommodate commercial aircraft carrying tourists, pointing out that such jets could not land at Pearls Airport on the island's north end (5,200 feet), and that Pearls could not be expanded because its runway abutted a mountain at one end and the ocean at the other.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/grenadarevolutio0000payn/page/31|title=Grenada : revolution and invasion|last=Payne, Anthony, 1952-|date=1984|publisher=St. Martin's Press|others=Sutton, Paul K., Thorndike, Tony.|isbn=0-312-35042-2|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/grenadarevolutio0000payn/page/31 31]|oclc=10548141}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Point Salinas International Airport, Grenada.jpg|thumb|Point Salines International Airport, Grenada]]\n\nIn 1983, Representative [[Ron Dellums]] (D, California) traveled to Grenada on a fact-finding mission, having been invited by the country's prime minister.

[[AC-130]] gunships, [[A-7 Corsair]] strike planes, and [[AH-1 Cobra]] attack helicopters were called in to support the besieged SEALs, but the SEALs remained trapped for the next 24 hours.\n\nAt 19:00 on 25 October, 250 Marines from G Company of the [[22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit|22nd Marine Assault Unit]] landed at Grand Mal Bay equipped with [[Assault Amphibious Vehicle|amphibious assault vehicles]] and four [[M60 Patton]] tanks; they relieved the Navy SEALs the following morning, allowing Governor Scoon, his wife, and nine aides to be safely evacuated at 10:00 that day. The Marine tank crews continued advancing in the face of sporadic resistance, knocking out a BRDM-2 armored car.<ref name=\"Russell\" /> G Company subsequently defeated and overwhelmed the Grenadian defenders at Fort Frederick.<ref name=\"Kreisher\" />\n\n=== Airstrikes ===\nNavy [[A-7 Corsair]]s and Marine [[AH-1 Cobra]] attack helicopters made airstrikes against Fort Rupert and Fort Frederick. An A-7 raid on Fort Frederick targeting anti-aircraft guns hit a nearby mental hospital, killing 18 civilians.<ref name=\"dtic\" />{{rp|62}} Two Marine AH-1T Cobras and a UH-60 Blackhawk were shot down in a raid against Fort Frederick, resulting in five casualties.<ref name=\"Kreisher\" />\n\n==Second day of the invasion==\n[[File:Op Urgent Fury Invasion Map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Initial troop invasion areas]]\n\nGeneral Trobaugh of the 82nd Airborne Division had two goals on the second day: securing the perimeter around Salines Airport, and rescuing American students held in Grand Anse. The Army lacked undamaged helicopters after the losses on the first day and consequently had to delay the student rescue until they made contact with Marine forces.\n\n===Attack on the Cuban compound===\nEarly on the morning of 26 October, Cuban forces ambushed a patrol from the 2nd Battalion of the 325th Infantry Regiment near the village of Calliste. The American patrol suffered six wounded and two killed, including the commander of Company B. Navy airstrikes and an artillery bombardment by [[M102 howitzer|105mm howitzers]] targeting the main Cuban encampment eventually led to their surrender at 08:30. American forces pushed on to the village of Frequente, where they discovered a Cuban weapons cache reportedly sufficient to equip six battalions. Cuban forces ambushed a reconnaissance platoon who were mounted on gun-jeeps, but the jeeps returned fire, and a nearby infantry unit added mortar fire; the Cubans suffered four casualties with no American losses. Cuban resistance largely ended after these engagements.<ref name=\"Stuart\" />\n\n===Rescue at Grand Anse===\nOn the afternoon of 26 October, Rangers of the 2nd Battalion of the Ranger Regiment mounted Marine [[CH-46 Sea Knight]] helicopters to launch an air assault on the Grand Anse campus. The campus guards offered light resistance before fleeing, wounding one Ranger, and one of the helicopters crashed on the approach after its blade hit a palm tree. The Rangers evacuated the 233 American students by [[CH-53 Sea Stallion]] helicopters, but the students informed them that there was a third campus with Americans at Prickly Bay.<ref name=\"Kreisher\" /> A squad of 11 Rangers was accidentally left behind; they departed on a rubber raft which was picked up by {{USS|Caron}} at 23:00.<ref name=\"CombatReform\" />\n\n==Third day of the invasion and after==\n[[File:Explosion2 during Grenada invasion 1983.JPEG|thumb|Bombardment of Point Calivigny]]\n\nBy 27 October, organized resistance was rapidly diminishing, but the American forces did not yet realize this. The Marine 22nd MAU and 8th Regiment continued advancing along the coast and capturing additional towns, meeting little resistance, although one patrol did encounter a single [[BTR-60]] during the night and dispatched it with a [[M72 LAW]]. The 325th Infantry Regiment advanced toward Saint George, capturing Grand Anse and discovering 200 American students whom they had missed the first day. They continued to the town of Ruth Howard and the capital of Saint George, meeting only scattered resistance. An air-naval gunfire liaison team called in an A-7 airstrike and accidentally hit the command post of the 2nd Brigade, wounding 17 troops, one of whom died.<ref name=\"Stuart\" />\n\nThe Army had reports that PRA forces were amassing at the Calivigny Barracks, only five kilometers from the Point Salines airfield. They organized an air assault by the 2nd Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment preceded by a preparatory bombardment by field howitzers (which mostly missed, their shells falling into the ocean), [[A-7 Corsair]]s, [[AC-130]]s, and USS ''Caron''. However, the [[UH-60 Blackhawk|Blackhawk]] helicopters began dropping off troops near the barracks but they approached too fast. One of them crash-landed and the two behind it collided with it, killing three and wounding four. The barracks were deserted.<ref name=\"CombatReform\" />\n\nIn the following days, resistance ended entirely and the Army and Marines spread across the island, arresting PRA officials, seizing caches of weapons, and seeing to the repatriation of Cuban engineers. On 1 November, two companies from the 22nd Marine Amphibious Unit made a combined sea and helicopter landing on the island of [[Carriacou]] {{convert|17|mi}} northeast of Grenada. The 19 Grenadian soldiers defending the island surrendered without a fight. This was the last military action of the campaign.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.mca-marines.org/leatherneck/operation-urgent-fury-grenada |title=Operation URGENT FURY \u2013 Grenada |last=Kreisher |first=Otto |date=October 2003 |website=Marine Corps Association and Foundation | accessdate=28 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Outcome==\n[[File:CH46SeaKnight Grenada 1983.JPG|thumb|A Marine Corps [[Sea Knight]] helicopter sits on the beach after being disabled during the Grand Anse rescue on 26 October 1983]]\nOfficial U.S. sources state that some of the opponents were well prepared and well positioned and put up stubborn resistance, to the extent that the Americans called in two battalions of reinforcements on the evening of 26 October.

The Soviet Union said that Grenada had been the object of United States threats, that the invasion violated international law, and that no small nation would find itself safe if the aggression were not rebuffed.
