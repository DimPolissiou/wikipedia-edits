The city was divided into 14 ''colaciones'', and numerous new church buildings were added. The centre of the mosque was converted into a large Catholic cathedral.\n\nThe city declined, especially after [[Renaissance]] times. In the 18th century it was reduced to just 20,000 inhabitants. The population and economy started to increase again only in the early 20th century.\n\nC\u00f3rdoba was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] on 17 December 1984, but the city has a number of modern areas, including the district of Zoco and the area surrounding the railway station.\n\nThe regional government (the [[Junta de Andaluc\u00eda]]) has for some time{{When||date=August 2017}} been studying the creation of a ''C\u00f3rdoba Metropolitan Area'' that would comprise, in addition to the capital itself, the towns of [[Villafranca de C\u00f3rdoba]], [[Obejo]], [[La Carlota, C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|La Carlota]], [[Villaharta]], [[Villaviciosa, C\u00f3rdoba|Villaviciosa]], [[Almod\u00f3var del R\u00edo]] and [[Guadalc\u00e1zar (C\u00f3rdoba)|Guadalc\u00e1zar]].

The so-called \"Siren of Canosa\"\u2014[[Canosa di Puglia]] is a site in [[Apulia]] that was part of [[Magna Graecia]]\u2014was said to accompany the dead among [[grave goods]] in a burial.

The sculpture is conserved in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]], in Madrid.\n\nThe Sirens were called the Muses of the lower world, classical scholar [[Walter Copland Perry]] (1814\u20131911) observed: \"Their song, though irresistibly sweet, was no less sad than sweet, and lapped both body and soul in a fatal lethargy, the forerunner of death and corruption.\"<ref>Perry, \"The sirens in ancient literature and art\", in ''The Nineteenth Century'', reprinted in ''Choice Literature: a monthly magazine'' (New York) '''2''' (September\u2013December 1883:163).</ref> Their song is continually calling on Persephone. The term \"[[wikt:siren song|siren song]]\" refers to an appeal that is hard to resist but that, if heeded, will lead to a bad conclusion.

A modern literary appropriation of the myth is to be seen in [[Clemens Brentano]]'s ''Lore Lay'' ballad, published in his novel ''Godwi oder Das steinerne Bild der Mutter'' (1801).\n\nIn the folklore of some modern cultures, the concept of the siren has been assimilated to that of the [[mermaid]].

Throughout the work, Kranish and Fisher discuss Trump's motivation to increase his financial standing and gain more fame.<ref name=kirkus /><ref name=booklist /> [[Roy Cohn]] meets Trump in 1973, and Trump is allowed entry into the Manhattan facility \"Le Club\" after assuring its owners he will not pursue married women in the establishment. Trump first encounters Cohn at the club, and informs him of his troubles being sued for [[racial discrimination]]. Cohn instructs Trump on his style to [[countersue]] rather than settle a case. Cohn taught Trump to always attack, as a public relations and litigation tactic. Cohn subsequently became Trump's attorney and [[Cleaner (crime)|fixer]] for his New York operations.<ref name=evanthomas /><ref name=gq>{{citation|access-date=June 23, 2017|work=[[GQ (magazine)|GQ magazine]]|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/angels-in-america-donald-trump|title=Angels in America: the inspiration behind Trump's brutal style leadership|date=June 2, 2017|first=Matthew|last=D'Ancona|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705010030/https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/angels-in-america-donald-trump|archivedate=July 5, 2017}}</ref><ref name=people />\n\nKranish and Fisher recount that Trump greatly derived pleasure from being featured in the gossip column of the ''[[New York Post]]'' called \"Page Six\".<ref name=evanthomas /> The book discusses [[Donald Trump pseudonyms|Trump's usage of pseudonyms John Barron and John Miller]] as an attempt to appear more often in the newspaper.<ref name=evanthomas /><ref name=guardian /> The authors point out, \"Some reporters found the calls from Miller or Barron merely playful, if a bit weird. Others thought the calls were disturbing or even creepy, as Barron seems to take pleasure in describing how prominent women were drawn to Trump sexually.\"<ref name=evanthomas />\n\n''Trump Revealed'' provides case studies of Trump's financial hits and misses, providing depth and background on each over time. More detail over and above a simple historical overview is provided by supplementing discussion of the subject's life with direct interviews with Trump himself. The book discusses Trump's role in the beauty pageant [[Miss Universe]], and his practice of inspecting the attractiveness of potential candidates himself.

They ask him about his friends and social relationships. Trump reflects on the question and finds difficulty providing an answer, finally saying his business life did not provide sufficient time to develop lasting social friendships; instead he relies upon financial ties and acquaintances met during public fundraising events. He confidentially gave Kranish and Fisher names of three close male friends, with whom he had not spoken in years. The authors conclude Trump did not keep meaningful friendships aside from his close relatives.<ref name=evanthomas /><ref name=mikeallen>{{citation|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/washington-post-trump-book-best-parts-227259|work=[[Politico]]|access-date=June 23, 2017|title='No time to read&nbsp;...

The election was important for the bitterness of the contest between the [[Coalition Government 1916-1922|Coalition]] and [[H H Asquith|Independent]] factions within the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and the deepening of this division within the party as a factor in the long term decline of Liberalism in [[Wales]].\n\n==Vacancy==\n\nThe by-election was caused by the desire of [[Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]] to find a Parliamentary seat for his private secretary Captain [[Ernest Evans (politician)|Ernest Evans]].<ref>Michael Kinnear, ''The Fall of Lloyd George: The Political Crisis of 1922''; University of Toronto Press, 1973 pp. 190\u2013191</ref> Lloyd George persuaded the sitting Coalition Liberal [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]], [[Matthew Vaughan-Davies, 1st Baron Ystwyth|Matthew Vaughan-Davies]], who had represented the constituency for more than twenty-five years,<ref>The Times, 1 January 1921 p. 10</ref> to accept a peerage so creating an opportunity for Evans to enter Parliament.<ref>[[Ffion Hague]], ''The Pain and the Privilege''; Harper Press, 2008 p.384</ref>\n\n==Candidates==\n===Coalition Liberals and Unionists===\nUnsurprisingly the Coalition Liberals chose Ernest Evans as their candidate. Evans was a lawyer. He had been [[called to the Bar]] in 1910 and after the First World War he became private secretary to Lloyd George. He held that post until 1920.<ref>''The Times House of Commons 1935''; Politico\u2019s Publishing 2003 p.154</ref> Evans was supported by Lloyd George's [[Conservative Party (UK)|Unionist]] partners in the [[Coalition Government 1916-1922|Coalition government]].<ref name=\"a1\" >The Times, 28 January 1921 p.10</ref>\n\n===Liberal split===\nAt first it was reported that Evans might not be opposed as he was a Cardiganshire man; his father was Clerk to the County Council.<ref>The Times, 3 January 1921 p.12</ref> However, the local Liberal Association was representative of both Coalition and Independent Liberal wings of the party and neither group had a permanent advantage over the other. Attempts by those opposed to the Coalition had earlier tried to ensure that any replacement for Vaughan-Davies would not be another Coalition Liberal but although this resolution passed the executive committee, it was never ratified by the membership.<ref>Kinnear, ''The Fall of Lloyd George'' p.191</ref> Once Vaughan\u2013Davies' peerage was announced, a number of other possible by-election candidates put their names forward.  First it was announced that Sir Lewes Loveden Pryse, a local land owner, would stand in the by-election as a Liberal Anti-Waste candidate.<ref>The Times, 4 January 1921 p. 10</ref> A number of by-elections at this time were contested by members of the [[Anti-Waste League]] a [[political party]] founded in 1921 by [[Lord Rothermere]]. The party campaigned against what they saw as excessive government spending. It is not clear if Loveden Pryse was formally connected to the Anti-waste League or if he just taking advantage of a well-known political position close to his own views.\n\nTo resolve the issue of its choice of candidate, the Cardiganshire Liberal Association invited five potential candidates to address a meeting of the Association and to invite them to accept the outcome of the democratic decision, to use the secretary of the Association as their election agent, and to state if they were Coalitionists or 'free and independent Liberals'.<ref name=\"a2\" >The Times, 24 January 1921 p.10</ref> These men were Evans, Loveden Pryse, [[W. Llewelyn Williams]], [[Queen's Counsel|KC]] the former [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]] for [[Carmarthen (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen]] and [[Recorder (law)|Recorder]] of [[Cardiff]] and two local [[Aldermen]], [[John Morgan Howell|J M Howell]] and D C Roberts.<ref>The Times, 7 January 1921 p. 11</ref> Howell refused to attend the meeting and announced that he supported Lloyd George.{{sfn|Morgan|1967|pp=332-3}} In the meantime at a meeting in London of the newly formed Welsh Independent Liberal Association, attended by Llewelyn Williams, it was decided that if Cardiganshire Liberals chose a Coalition Liberal candidate, they would oppose him.<ref>The Times, 8 January 1921 p. 14</ref> As the other possible candidates dropped out of contention, the choice for Cardiganshire Liberals crystallised between Evans and Llewelyn Williams. Evans declared that if the Association selected a candidate who would not support the Coalition, he would stand anyway.<ref>The Times, 24 January p.10</ref>\n \nIn the event, at a rowdy meeting, Cardiganshire Liberals voted to adopt Llewelyn Williams. Of the 350 delegates invited to the selection meeting on 26 January 1921, 347 attended and voted by a majority of 206 to 127 in favour of Llewelyn Williams.<ref>The Times, 26 January 1921 p.10</ref>\n\nThe election which followed led to the re-emergence of tensions within Cardiganshire Liberalism, which had lain dormant for years, between the rural areas of the hinterland and the middle-class seaside towns. It was in the rural areas that Williams found the greatest levels of support.{{sfn|Morgan|1967|pp=333-4}}\n\n===Labour===\nThe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] stated they had a candidate ready to stand if the outcome of the Liberal selection process produced a candidate who was unacceptable to them. It was assumed, that given Labour's opposition to the Coalition, that if Evans was chosen therefore Labour would contest the election.<ref name=\"a2\" /> In the end however they chose not to do so and Llewelyn Williams claimed he had secured Labour's wholehearted support in the by-election.<ref>The Times, 29 January 1921 p. 10</ref> He later received the public support of William Harris the organiser of the [[South Wales Miners' Federation]] who declared it was the duty of Labour to vote against the present government which, he said, was the enemy of the working man.<ref name=\"a3\" >The Times, 8 February 1921 p. 10</ref>\n\n==Issues==\n===Agriculture===\nAgricultural policy was an early issue raised in the election. This was because the Cardiganshire Farmers' Union, a generally pro-Conservative organisation, held a meeting to question Captain Evans and decided to ask all candidates the same series of questions. They wanted to know if the candidates approved of farmers having to give up land to ex-soldiers, if they would support a reduction in the number of government inspectors supervising farmers and their work, particularly those operating under the Wages Boards. Although Loveden Pryse decided not to put himself up as a candidate, the issue of waste and government expenditure was raised in the election. The farmers wanted to know if the candidates would oppose increased spending on education, public health, land settlement and housing.<ref name=\"a1\" /> Despite the conservatism of the country people it was reported that Llewelyn Williams was receiving a good reception in the rural areas.<ref name=\"a4\" >The Times, 2 February 1921 p. 7</ref>\n\n===Waste===\nLlewelyn Williams picked up the Anti-Waste theme and declared that it was not by returning a tame official of the government that the Coalition could be held to account for its extravagance and its loss of control over the nation's finances.<ref>The Times, 3 February 1921 p. 10</ref>\n\n===The record of the Coalition and the position of Lloyd George===\nLlewelyn Williams tried to rally traditional Liberal support by emphasising the influence in Lloyd George's government of the Conservatives (who were in the majority in the Coalition). He would be happy to support the Prime Minister he said, when he got rid of the [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzons]], [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Carsons]], [[Arthur Balfour|Balfours]] and [[Bonar Law]]s who only a few years before had been trying to cut his political throat over the [[Marconi scandal|Marconi case]].<ref>The Times, 31 January 1921 p. 11</ref>\n\nLlewelyn Williams was fiercely opposed to Lloyd George, his one-time friend,<ref>[[Kenneth O Morgan]], ''Wales in British Politics: 1868-1922''; University of Wales Press, 1963 pp. 295\u2013296</ref> whom he had broken with over the issue of [[conscription]] in 1916. According to one historian, Llewelyn Williams was paranoid about Lloyd George calling him a 'dictator' and a 'little devil who plagues us so.'<ref>Kenneth O Morgan, ''Consensus and Disunity: The Lloyd George Coalition Government 1918-1922''; OUP 1979 pp. 198\u2013199</ref> He also disliked intensely the government action against nationalist forces in Ireland and the use of the so-called [[Black and Tans]]. \n \nLlewelyn Williams sought to counter Evans' credentials as a Cardiganshire man by getting his wife to make an appeal to women voters as a native of the county.<ref name=\"a4\" /> This appeal was however decisively trumped by the appearance in the constituency of the wife of the Prime Minister. [[Margaret Lloyd George|Mrs Lloyd George]] made a visit lasting four days in support of Captain Evans when she was received enthusiastically with bouquets and brass bands according to one source<ref>P J Madgwick, N Griffiths & V Walker, ''The Politics of Rural Wales: A Study of Cardiganshire; Hutchison, 1973 p46''</ref> and addressed a special meeting of women at [[Aberystwyth]].<ref name=\"a3\" /> Her campaigning concluded only on election day itself with a tour of polling stations and a last minute plea for votes published in the ''[[Cambrian News]]''.<ref>Hague, ''The Pain and the Privilege''; Harper Press, 2008 p. 389</ref>\n\nEvans based his appeal on the reasons for maintaining the Coalition after 1918 and appealed for loyalty to Lloyd George as a great Welshman and war hero. There was an unashamed appeal to patriotism. Mrs Lloyd George told electors that the Germans were anxiously watching the result of the contest and the ''Cambrian News'' published a cartoon showing Prussian Militarism trying in vain to woo Miss Cardiganshire away from Lloyd George.<ref>Madgwick, Griffiths & Walker, ''The Politics of Rural Wales'', p 47</ref> Evans associated himself with the points made by Lloyd George at the executive meeting of the Welsh National Liberals on 8 February 1921. These were chiefly, the recognition that the emergency extended into the post-war phase; the need for national unity to face the challenges of the economy and demobilization after the war; the need for unity to enforce the post-war international settlement agreed at [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|the Paris Peace Conference]] and the moves to find a solution to the question of [[Irish home rule|Home Rule for Ireland]].<ref>The Times, 9 February 1921 p. 12</ref> In a letter of support to Evans, Conservative leader Bonar Law also made similar points about the need for national unity and government o be carried on in a non-partisan way.<ref>The Times, 10 February 1921 p. 10</ref> Loyalty to the Prime Minister as a great Welsh figure was also reported to have been a factor in swaying the voters.<ref name=\"a5\" >The Times, 21 February 1921 p. 11</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nOne topic which was reported to have been a dead issue in the election was the Church question, a policy which for a generation was the central and burning issue of Welsh politics. [[Violet Bonham Carter]] tried to raise the issue in a speech at Aberystwyth, attacking Lloyd George for re-endowing the [[Anglican Church]] with taxpayers' money. But it seemed to leave the audience cold. The many sects in the Welsh [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformism]] found themselves divided between the different candidates, a dilemma with which they were highly unfamiliar<ref>The Times, 16 February 1921 p. 12</ref> and perhaps this lack of unity served to lessen the profile and importance of the [[Church in Wales|disestablishment]] tradition.  However, Evans was a [[Methodist]], which was the dominant denomination in the area,<ref>Kenneth O Morgan, ''Consensus and Disunity: The Lloyd George Coalition Government 1918-1922''; OUP 1979 p. 199</ref> as was Mrs Lloyd George<ref>Hague, ''The Pain and the Privilege''; p. 385</ref> while most supporters of Llewelyn Williams were [[Congregationalists]]. Ministers of religion frequently appeared on political platforms and political factionalism within the Liberal tradition spilled over into the politics of the chapels both between the demoninantions and within.<ref>Madgwick, Griffiths & Walker, ''The Politics of Rural Wales'' p. 48</ref> So religion certainly seems to have been, after all, more of factor than was believed by commentators at the time.\n\n===Polling day===\nIn this respect the Coalition had an advantage. In particular they were able to make use of many more motor vehicles to get their supporters to the poll which was important in a constituency like Cardiganshire which was full of outlying villages and farms. On election day it was said that 250 motor cars, mostly owned by Conservative backers of the Coalition, were brought out for the purpose of ferrying voters to the polling stations and this was a significant factor<ref>Jenny Rees, ''Looking for Mr Nobody: The Secret Life of Goronwy Rees''; Transaction Books, 2000 p. 25</ref> whereas Independent Liberals could muster only 50 cars in response.<ref>Hague, ''The Pain and the Privilege''; p. 389</ref>\n\n==Result==\nIn what was reported to have been an unexpectedly heavy poll of 80%, Captain Evans won the seat for the Coalition by a majority of 3,590 votes.<ref name=\"Craig, F.

The election was important for the bitterness of the contest between the [[Coalition Government 1916-1922|Coalition]] and [[H H Asquith|Independent]] factions within the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and the deepening of this division within the party as a factor in the long term decline of Liberalism in [[Wales]].\n\n==Vacancy==\n\nThe by-election was caused by the desire of [[Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]] to find a Parliamentary seat for his private secretary Captain [[Ernest Evans (politician)|Ernest Evans]].<ref>Michael Kinnear, ''The Fall of Lloyd George: The Political Crisis of 1922''; University of Toronto Press, 1973 pp. 190\u2013191</ref> Lloyd George persuaded the sitting Coalition Liberal [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]], [[Matthew Vaughan-Davies, 1st Baron Ystwyth|Matthew Vaughan-Davies]], who had represented the constituency for more than twenty-five years,<ref>The Times, 1 January 1921 p. 10</ref> to accept a peerage so creating an opportunity for Evans to enter Parliament.<ref>[[Ffion Hague]], ''The Pain and the Privilege''; Harper Press, 2008 p.384</ref>\n\n==Candidates==\n===Coalition Liberals and Unionists===\nUnsurprisingly the Coalition Liberals chose Ernest Evans as their candidate. Evans was a lawyer. He had been [[called to the Bar]] in 1910 and after the First World War he became private secretary to Lloyd George. He held that post until 1920.<ref>''The Times House of Commons 1935''; Politico\u2019s Publishing 2003 p.154</ref> Evans was supported by Lloyd George's [[Conservative Party (UK)|Unionist]] partners in the [[Coalition Government 1916-1922|Coalition government]].<ref name=\"a1\" >The Times, 28 January 1921 p.10</ref>\n\n===Liberal split===\nAt first it was reported that Evans might not be opposed as he was a Cardiganshire man; his father was Clerk to the County Council.<ref>The Times, 3 January 1921 p.12</ref> However, the local Liberal Association was representative of both Coalition and Independent Liberal wings of the party and neither group had a permanent advantage over the other. Attempts by those opposed to the Coalition had earlier tried to ensure that any replacement for Vaughan-Davies would not be another Coalition Liberal but although this resolution passed the executive committee, it was never ratified by the membership.<ref>Kinnear, ''The Fall of Lloyd George'' p.191</ref> Once Vaughan\u2013Davies' peerage was announced, a number of other possible by-election candidates put their names forward.  First it was announced that Sir Lewes Loveden Pryse, a local land owner, would stand in the by-election as a Liberal Anti-Waste candidate.<ref>The Times, 4 January 1921 p. 10</ref> A number of by-elections at this time were contested by members of the [[Anti-Waste League]] a [[political party]] founded in 1921 by [[Lord Rothermere]]. The party campaigned against what they saw as excessive government spending. It is not clear if Loveden Pryse was formally connected to the Anti-waste League or if he just taking advantage of a well-known political position close to his own views.\n\nTo resolve the issue of its choice of candidate, the Cardiganshire Liberal Association invited five potential candidates to address a meeting of the Association and to invite them to accept the outcome of the democratic decision, to use the secretary of the Association as their election agent, and to state if they were Coalitionists or 'free and independent Liberals'.<ref name=\"a2\" >The Times, 24 January 1921 p.10</ref> These men were Evans, Loveden Pryse, [[W. Llewelyn Williams]], [[Queen's Counsel|KC]] the former [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]] for [[Carmarthen (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen]] and [[Recorder (law)|Recorder]] of [[Cardiff]] and two local [[Aldermen]], [[John Morgan Howell|J M Howell]] and D C Roberts.<ref>The Times, 7 January 1921 p. 11</ref> Howell refused to attend the meeting and announced that he supported Lloyd George.{{sfn|Morgan|1967|pp=332-3}} In the meantime at a meeting in London of the newly formed Welsh Independent Liberal Association, attended by Llewelyn Williams, it was decided that if Cardiganshire Liberals chose a Coalition Liberal candidate, they would oppose him.<ref>The Times, 8 January 1921 p. 14</ref> As the other possible candidates dropped out of contention, the choice for Cardiganshire Liberals crystallised between Evans and Llewelyn Williams. Evans declared that if the Association selected a candidate who would not support the Coalition, he would stand anyway.<ref>The Times, 24 January p.10</ref>\n \nIn the event, at a rowdy meeting, Cardiganshire Liberals voted to adopt Llewelyn Williams. Of the 350 delegates invited to the selection meeting on 26 January 1921, 347 attended and voted by a majority of 206 to 127 in favour of Llewelyn Williams.<ref>The Times, 26 January 1921 p.10</ref>\n\nThe election which followed led to the re-emergence of tensions within Cardiganshire Liberalism, which had lain dormant for years, between the rural areas of the hinterland and the middle-class seaside towns. It was in the rural areas that Williams found the greatest levels of support.{{sfn|Morgan|1967|pp=333-4}}\n\n===Labour===\nThe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] stated they had a candidate ready to stand if the outcome of the Liberal selection process produced a candidate who was unacceptable to them. It was assumed, that given Labour's opposition to the Coalition, that if Evans was chosen therefore Labour would contest the election.<ref name=\"a2\" /> In the end however they chose not to do so and Llewelyn Williams claimed he had secured Labour's wholehearted support in the by-election.<ref>The Times, 29 January 1921 p. 10</ref> He later received the public support of William Harris the organiser of the [[South Wales Miners' Federation]] who declared it was the duty of Labour to vote against the present government which, he said, was the enemy of the working man.<ref name=\"a3\" >The Times, 8 February 1921 p. 10</ref>\n\n==Issues==\n===Agriculture===\nAgricultural policy was an early issue raised in the election. This was because the Cardiganshire Farmers' Union, a generally pro-Conservative organisation, held a meeting to question Captain Evans and decided to ask all candidates the same series of questions. They wanted to know if the candidates approved of farmers having to give up land to ex-soldiers, if they would support a reduction in the number of government inspectors supervising farmers and their work, particularly those operating under the Wages Boards. Although Loveden Pryse decided not to put himself up as a candidate, the issue of waste and government expenditure was raised in the election. The farmers wanted to know if the candidates would oppose increased spending on education, public health, land settlement and housing.<ref name=\"a1\" /> Despite the conservatism of the country people it was reported that Llewelyn Williams was receiving a good reception in the rural areas.<ref name=\"a4\" >The Times, 2 February 1921 p. 7</ref>\n\n===Waste===\nLlewelyn Williams picked up the Anti-Waste theme and declared that it was not by returning a tame official of the government that the Coalition could be held to account for its extravagance and its loss of control over the nation's finances.<ref>The Times, 3 February 1921 p. 10</ref>\n\n===The record of the Coalition and the position of Lloyd George===\nLlewelyn Williams tried to rally traditional Liberal support by emphasising the influence in Lloyd George's government of the Conservatives (who were in the majority in the Coalition). He would be happy to support the Prime Minister he said, when he got rid of the [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzons]], [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Carsons]], [[Arthur Balfour|Balfours]] and [[Bonar Law]]s who only a few years before had been trying to cut his political throat over the [[Marconi scandal|Marconi case]].<ref>The Times, 31 January 1921 p. 11</ref>\n\nLlewelyn Williams was fiercely opposed to Lloyd George, his one-time friend,<ref>[[Kenneth O Morgan]], ''Wales in British Politics: 1868-1922''; University of Wales Press, 1963 pp. 295\u2013296</ref> whom he had broken with over the issue of [[conscription]] in 1916. According to one historian, Llewelyn Williams was paranoid about Lloyd George calling him a 'dictator' and a 'little devil who plagues us so.'<ref>Kenneth O Morgan, ''Consensus and Disunity: The Lloyd George Coalition Government 1918-1922''; OUP 1979 pp. 198\u2013199</ref> He also disliked intensely the government action against nationalist forces in Ireland and the use of the so-called [[Black and Tans]]. \n \nLlewelyn Williams sought to counter Evans' credentials as a Cardiganshire man by getting his wife to make an appeal to women voters as a native of the county.<ref name=\"a4\" /> This appeal was however decisively trumped by the appearance in the constituency of the wife of the Prime Minister. [[Margaret Lloyd George|Mrs Lloyd George]] made a visit lasting four days in support of Captain Evans when she was received enthusiastically with bouquets and brass bands according to one source<ref>P J Madgwick, N Griffiths & V Walker, ''The Politics of Rural Wales: A Study of Cardiganshire; Hutchison, 1973 p46''</ref> and addressed a special meeting of women at [[Aberystwyth]].<ref name=\"a3\" /> Her campaigning concluded only on election day itself with a tour of polling stations and a last minute plea for votes published in the ''[[Cambrian News]]''.<ref>Hague, ''The Pain and the Privilege''; Harper Press, 2008 p. 389</ref>\n\nEvans based his appeal on the reasons for maintaining the Coalition after 1918 and appealed for loyalty to Lloyd George as a great Welshman and war hero. There was an unashamed appeal to patriotism. Mrs Lloyd George told electors that the Germans were anxiously watching the result of the contest and the ''Cambrian News'' published a cartoon showing Prussian Militarism trying in vain to woo Miss Cardiganshire away from Lloyd George.<ref>Madgwick, Griffiths & Walker, ''The Politics of Rural Wales'', p 47</ref> Evans associated himself with the points made by Lloyd George at the executive meeting of the Welsh National Liberals on 8 February 1921. These were chiefly, the recognition that the emergency extended into the post-war phase; the need for national unity to face the challenges of the economy and demobilization after the war; the need for unity to enforce the post-war international settlement agreed at [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|the Paris Peace Conference]] and the moves to find a solution to the question of [[Irish home rule|Home Rule for Ireland]].<ref>The Times, 9 February 1921 p. 12</ref> In a letter of support to Evans, Conservative leader Bonar Law also made similar points about the need for national unity and government o be carried on in a non-partisan way.<ref>The Times, 10 February 1921 p. 10</ref> Loyalty to the Prime Minister as a great Welsh figure was also reported to have been a factor in swaying the voters.<ref name=\"a5\" >The Times, 21 February 1921 p. 11</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nOne topic which was reported to have been a dead issue in the election was the Church question, a policy which for a generation was the central and burning issue of Welsh politics. [[Violet Bonham Carter]] tried to raise the issue in a speech at Aberystwyth, attacking Lloyd George for re-endowing the [[Anglican Church]] with taxpayers' money.
