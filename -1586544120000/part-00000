The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions, and those qualified by virtue of finishing 2nd\u20134th in their national championship.\n\nThe number of teams that each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the [[UEFA coefficients#League coefficient|UEFA coefficients]] of the member associations. These coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five Champions League and [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup/Europa League]] seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in.\n\nFour of the remaining six qualifying places are granted to the winners of a six-round qualifying tournament between the remaining 43 or 44 national champions, within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds. The other two are granted to the winners of a three-round qualifying tournament between the 11 clubs from the associations ranked 5 through 15, which have qualified based upon finishing second, or third in their respective national league.\n\nIn addition to sporting criteria, any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the Champions League. To obtain a license, the club must meet certain stadium, infrastructure, and finance requirements.\n\nIn [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|2005\u201306 season]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[FC Petr\u017ealka akad\u00e9mia|Artmedia Bratislava]] became the first teams to reach the Champions League group stage after playing in all three qualifying rounds.

A referee is initially placed into Category 4 with the exception of referees from France, Germany, England, Italy, or Spain. Referees from these five countries are typically comfortable with top professional matches and are therefore directly placed into Category 3. Each referee's performance is observed and evaluated after every match; his category may be revised twice per season, but a referee cannot be promoted directly from Category 3 to the Elite Category.<ref name=\"referees\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/trainingground/referees/index.html|title=UEFA Referee|publisher=Uefa.com|date=7 July 2010|accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Appointment===\nIn co-operation with the UEFA Refereeing Unit, the UEFA Referee Committee is responsible for appointing referees to matches. Referees are appointed based on previous matches, marks, performances, and fitness levels. To discourage bias, the Champions League takes nationality into account. No referee may be of the same origins as any club in his or her respecting groups. Referee appointments, suggested by the UEFA Refereeing Unit, are sent to the UEFA Referee Committee to be discussed or revised. After a consensus is made, the name of the appointed referee remains confidential up to two days before the match for the purpose of minimising public influence.<ref name=\"referees\"/>\n\n===Limitations===\nSince 1990, a UEFA international referee cannot exceed the age of 45 years. After turning 45, a referee must step down at the end of his season. The age limit was established to ensure an elite level of fitness. Today, UEFA Champions League referees are required to pass a fitness test even to be considered at the international level.<ref name=\"referees\"/>\n\n==Prizes==\n===Trophy and medals===\n{{main|European Champion Clubs' Cup}}\n[[File:Trofeo UEFA Champions League.jpg|thumb|Official trophy]]\nEach year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the current version of which has been awarded since 1967.

The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions, and those qualified by virtue of finishing 2nd\u20134th in their national championship.\n\nThe number of teams that each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the [[UEFA coefficients#League coefficient|UEFA coefficients]] of the member associations. These coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five Champions League and [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup/Europa League]] seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in.\n\nFour of the remaining six qualifying places are granted to the winners of a six-round qualifying tournament between the remaining 43 or 44 national champions, within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds. The other two are granted to the winners of a three-round qualifying tournament between the 11 clubs from the associations ranked 5 through 15, which have qualified based upon finishing second, or third in their respective national league.\n\nIn addition to sporting criteria, any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the Champions League. To obtain a license, the club must meet certain stadium, infrastructure, and finance requirements.\n\nIn [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|2005\u201306 season]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[FC Petr\u017ealka akad\u00e9mia|Artmedia Bratislava]] became the first teams to reach the Champions League group stage after playing in all three qualifying rounds.

Real Madrid holds the record for the most consecutive appearances in the group stage, having qualified 22 times in a row (1997\u2013present).

The 16 top ranked teams spread across the biggest domestic leagues qualified directly for the tournament group stage. Prior to this, three preliminary knockout qualifying rounds whittled down the remaining teams, with teams starting in different rounds.\n\nAn [[Liverpool F.C. 2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League qualification|exception to the usual European qualification system]] happened in 2005, after [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season.

However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that, if the Champions League winner fell outside of its domestic league's top four, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league.

A referee is initially placed into Category 4 with the exception of referees from France, Germany, England, Italy, or Spain. Referees from these five countries are typically comfortable with top professional matches and are therefore directly placed into Category 3. Each referee's performance is observed and evaluated after every match; his category may be revised twice per season, but a referee cannot be promoted directly from Category 3 to the Elite Category.<ref name=\"referees\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/trainingground/referees/index.html|title=UEFA Referee|publisher=Uefa.com|date=7 July 2010|accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Appointment===\nIn co-operation with the UEFA Refereeing Unit, the UEFA Referee Committee is responsible for appointing referees to matches. Referees are appointed based on previous matches, marks, performances, and fitness levels. To discourage bias, the Champions League takes nationality into account. No referee may be of the same origins as any club in his or her respecting groups. Referee appointments, suggested by the UEFA Refereeing Unit, are sent to the UEFA Referee Committee to be discussed or revised. After a consensus is made, the name of the appointed referee remains confidential up to two days before the match for the purpose of minimising public influence.<ref name=\"referees\"/>\n\n===Limitations===\nSince 1990, a UEFA international referee cannot exceed the age of 45 years. After turning 45, a referee must step down at the end of his season. The age limit was established to ensure an elite level of fitness. Today, UEFA Champions League referees are required to pass a fitness test even to be considered at the international level.<ref name=\"referees\"/>\n\n==Prizes==\n===Trophy and medals===\n{{main|European Champion Clubs' Cup}}\n[[File:Trofeo UEFA Champions League.jpg|thumb|Official trophy]]\nEach year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the current version of which has been awarded since 1967.

This, combined with a deal to ensure tournament sponsors were given priority on television advertisements during matches, ensured that each of the tournament's main sponsors was given maximum exposure.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Craig|last2=Magnus|first2=Ems|date=February 2003|title=The Uefa Champions League Marketing|journal=Fiba Assist Magazine|pages=49\u201350|url=http://www.ekospor.com/Sports-Marketing/Sport%20Marketing%20uefa.pdf|accessdate=19 May 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528155330/http://www.ekospor.com/Sports-Marketing/Sport%20Marketing%20uefa.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFrom the [[2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|2012\u201313 knockout phase]], UEFA used LED advertising hoardings installed in knock-out participant stadiums, including the final stage.

It was the location of the [[London Cage]], the British government [[MI19]] centre used during the [[Second World War]] and the [[Cold War]].\n\nA tree-lined avenue half a mile long in the heart of embassy land, Kensington Palace Gardens is often cited as the \"most exclusive address\" in London, according to real estate agency [[Knight Frank]]. It is one of the most expensive residential streets in the world, and has long been known as \"Billionaires Row\", due to the huge wealth of its private residents, although in fact the majority of its current occupants are either national embassies or ambassadorial residences. As of mid-2012, current market prices for a property in the street average over \u00a322 million.<ref>[http://money.aol.co.uk/2012/06/21/where-are-britains-most-expensive-houses-and-why/ \"Where are Britain's most expensive houses? And why?\"] money.aol.co.uk. 6 September 2012.</ref>\n\nIt is immediately to the west of [[Kensington Gardens]] and connects [[Notting Hill Gate]] with [[Kensington High Street]]. The southern section of Kensington Palace Gardens is called Palace Green.\n\n==Background==\nThe road was originally called The Queen's Road and was renamed Kensington Palace Gardens around 1870 when [[Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia|plane trees]] were planted in the avenue. It was built from the 1840s onward on part of the grounds of [[Kensington Palace]]; the [[Freehold (English law)|freehold]] still belongs to the [[Crown Estate]]. The palace, which is the residence of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, Duke and Duchess of Kent, and Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, fronts the southern part of the street on the eastern side. The houses at the northern end are mostly Italianate, while those at the southern end are mostly in the [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]]. For much of the 20th century a large proportion of the houses were occupied by embassies and ambassadors' residences. Some still are, but others have been renovated by the [[Crown Estate]] and sold to private buyers on long [[Leasehold estate|leases]]. One of these was bought in 2004 by the Indian steel tycoon [[Lakshmi Mittal]], who in 2008 was listed by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine as the fourth richest man in the world. The sale was widely misreported at \u00a370 million,<ref>{{cite news |title=$128M Spend for London House |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4722789 |publisher=NBC News |date=12 April 2004}}</ref> before accurate figures were available from [[HM Land Registry]], where records state that on 30 June 2004, 18\u201319 Kensington Palace Gardens, along with three [[mews]] houses at the rear of the property, sold for \u00a357,145,967.<ref>{{cite news |title=Super rich |url=http://money.guardian.co.uk/tax/story/0,,1755287,00.html |work=The Guardian |first=James |last=Meek |date=17 April 2006 |location=London |accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe mansion at 18 Kensington Palace Gardens, historically belonging to the [[Rothschild family]], was sold in 2001.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/propertyadvice/propertymarket/3291728/If-you-have-to-ask-the-price....html If you have to ask the price] The Daily Telegraph, By Ross Clark, 1 August 2001</ref>\n\nNo. 8 was used as an interrogation centre for German [[Prisoner of war|POW]]s during and after the [[Second World War]] and was known as the [[London Cage]]. The house was demolished in 1961 and replaced by a glass-and-steel block of four apartments designed by [[Richard Seifert]] and completed in 1964. Flat 3 was on the market in 2006 as a three-bedroom apartment designed by international architect [[David Chipperfield]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcinerneyarchitects.com/selected-projects/kensington/ |title=McInerney Architects \u00bb Kensington}}</ref> valued at a minimum of \u00a313.25 million through Knight Frank,<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/main.jhtml?xml=/property/2006/06/28/pkensington28.xml Where \u00a310m is 'a snip'], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 28 June 2006</ref><ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200607/ai_n16598066 The modernist ideal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210083647/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200607/ai_n16598066 |date=10 December 2008}}, ''[[The Spectator]]'', 22 July 2006</ref> which sold in March 2007 for \u00a310.29m.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.zoopla.co.uk/house-prices/london/kensington-palace-gardens/w8-4qp/ |title=House prices in Kensington Palace Gardens, London W8 4QP stand at \u00a335,458,669 on average |website=Zoopla |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:RussianEmbassyChancery05 (London).JPG|thumb|right|200px|Chancery of the Russian Federation]]\n\nDue to the presence of likely terrorist targets &mdash; embassies etc., including those of Russia and Israel &mdash; both ends of the street have armed police checkpoints ([[Diplomatic Protection Group]] officers) with [[crash barrier]]s as well as the original wrought-iron gates. Entry of pedestrians is not normally controlled, only vehicles. This has the side effect of leading to extremely low traffic volumes for a central London street. Some of the buildings sometimes also have barriers to keep vehicles at a distance.

Chelsea|Kensington]], west [[central London]], home to some of the most expensive properties in the world. It was the location of the [[London Cage]], the British government [[MI19]] centre used during the [[Second World War]] and the [[Cold War]].\n\nA tree-lined avenue half a mile long in the heart of embassy land, Kensington Palace Gardens is often cited as the \"most exclusive address\" in London, according to real estate agency [[Knight Frank]]. It is one of the most expensive residential streets in the world, and has long been known as \"Billionaires Row\", due to the huge wealth of its private residents, although in fact the majority of its current occupants are either national embassies or ambassadorial residences. As of mid-2012, current market prices for a property in the street average over \u00a322 million.<ref>[http://money.aol.co.uk/2012/06/21/where-are-britains-most-expensive-houses-and-why/ \"Where are Britain's most expensive houses?

The southern section of Kensington Palace Gardens is called Palace Green.\n\n==Background==\nThe road was originally called The Queen's Road and was renamed Kensington Palace Gardens around 1870 when [[Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia|plane trees]] were planted in the avenue. It was built from the 1840s onward on part of the grounds of [[Kensington Palace]]; the [[Freehold (English law)|freehold]] still belongs to the [[Crown Estate]]. The palace, which is the residence of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, Duke and Duchess of Kent, and Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, fronts the southern part of the street on the eastern side. The houses at the northern end are mostly Italianate, while those at the southern end are mostly in the [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]]. For much of the 20th century a large proportion of the houses were occupied by embassies and ambassadors' residences. Some still are, but others have been renovated by the [[Crown Estate]] and sold to private buyers on long [[Leasehold estate|leases]]. One of these was bought in 2004 by the Indian steel tycoon [[Lakshmi Mittal]], who in 2008 was listed by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine as the fourth richest man in the world. The sale was widely misreported at \u00a370 million,<ref>{{cite news |title=$128M Spend for London House |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4722789 |publisher=NBC News |date=12 April 2004}}</ref> before accurate figures were available from [[HM Land Registry]], where records state that on 30 June 2004, 18-19 Kensington Palace Gardens, along with three [[mews]] houses at the rear of the property, sold for \u00a357,145,967.<ref>{{cite news |title=Super rich |url=http://money.guardian.co.uk/tax/story/0,,1755287,00.html |work=The Guardian |first=James |last=Meek |date=17 April 2006 |location=London |accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe mansion at 18 Kensington Palace Gardens, historically belonging to the [[Rothschild family]], was sold in 2001.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/propertyadvice/propertymarket/3291728/If-you-have-to-ask-the-price....html If you have to ask the price] The Daily Telegraph, By Ross Clark, 1 Aug 2001</ref>\n\nNo. 8 was used as an interrogation centre for German [[Prisoner of war|POW]]s during and after the [[Second World War]] and was known as the [[London Cage]].

George Talbot was appointed Surveyor-General of Maryland in 1683. In the aftermath of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, James Talbot's estate in Ballyconnell was confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 because he was a Catholic and he was granted an estate in 1655 at Castle Rubey, County Roscommon instead. He died in 1687. The Talbot lands in Killycluggin were distributed as follows-\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as belonging to ''Captain Gwilliams'' (i.e. the landlord of Ballyconnell, Captain Thomas Gwyllym) and the tenants as ''Edward Rely & Others''. \n\nIn the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663<ref>''The Hearth Money Rolls for the Baronies of Tullyhunco and Tullyhaw, County Cavan'', edited by Rev.

He became a merchant in Dorchester, Dorset but fled to France in 1633 when facing a warrant from the Exchequer for not paying customs. He married Mary Renald from Devon and died at Lissanover, County Cavan in 1661 and was buried at St. Orvins in Dublin (probably [[St. Audoen's Church, Dublin (Church of Ireland)]]),  despite wishing to be buried back in Dorchester. His will was published on 9 January 1665 leaving his son John Blachford as his sole heir. An Inquisition held in Cavan on 21 May 1667 found that his widow Mary Blachford and his heir John were seized of, inter alia, the land of Killeclogine alias Killecragan. He had sons John, Thomas, Ambrose and William (who became a Major) and daughters Mary and Frances. Major William Blachford was born in 1658 and died at Lissanover on 28 March 1727.

At that time the stone was in the same broken state in which it now appears and was situated some 10m SE of a stone circle (CV013-026002-). Macalister recorded local traditions which alleged that the damage to the stone had been carried out in living memory by local farmers in order to remove an obstruction to agricultural activities. Macalister also stated that people of the vicinity had dug around the stone in a vain search for buried treasure and in so doing had apparently destroyed a 'cist burial'. He did not, however, actually see this 'cist burial'. Some thirty years later a second decorated stone fragment, probably a portion of the same monolith, was discovered a short distance down-slope from the main piece. In the early summer of 1974 it was decided to remove the weathered and overgrown fragments to the National Museum of Ireland. A limited excavation was undertaken in its immediate vicinity which revealed that 'the stone stood in a flat-bottomed pit which had been deliberately sunk 80cm into the subsoil to receive it' (Raftery 1978, 51-2). Immediately E of the stone were two pits one of which may be identified as the remains of the cist burial identified by Macalister as it contained tiny fragments of burnt bone (CV013-026003-). The two fragments of the Killycluggin Stone are on display in the Cavan County Museum, Ballyjamesduff, while a replica stands at the cross-roads c. 250m NW of the original site. The following description of the stone is derived from Raftery (1978, 49-51). The main fragment has been worked to more-or-less cylindrical form on its surviving upper portion. That part which was intended to be below ground level is rough and irregular and projects awkwardly in one direction so that the stone as a whole is crudely L-shaped. The base of the stone slopes obliquely to its vertical axis. The entire upper surface of this stone had been smashed by deliberate and systematic hammering. This destruction continued along one side, whereby the ornament, down to the base of the stone was totally obliterated. The surviving ornament, which comprises combinations of sweeping curves and tight, hair-spring spirals \u2013 classic La T\u00e8ne motifs \u2013 is chiseled deeply and crisply into the prepared surface of the stone. The curvilinear patterns have been divided into rectangular panels by straight vertical lines and by horizontal lines at right angles to them which define the basal extremity of the ornamented area. The precise original width of only one such panel can now be ascertained (c. 0.9m wide and 0.75m high) but it may be estimated that four such panels of decoration once existed on the stone giving an original circumference of 3.6m. The smaller decorated fragment appears to represent a portion of the dome-shaped top of the original monolith and, in this regard, would have resembled that of the best known of the Irish aniconic stones, the stele from Turoe, Co. Galway (GA097-152----). The decoration on this fragment is of two types. Along one edge slight remains of curvilinear patterns, similar to those on the portion just described, survive. Sufficient remains to show that the upper limits of this decoration are defined by a straight line as is the case at the base of the stone, and traces of one of the lines which divide the ornament into vertical, rectangular panels are present here too. The convex upper surface of this fragment is decorated by a series of deeply chiseled, parallel lines which extend across the surface of the stone. The surviving edges of this panel of ornament are defined by a straight line which is incised at an oblique angle to the line which forms the boundary to the zones of curvilinear ornament. Thus there occurs what is now a triangular area, devoid of ornament between the ornament on the apex of the stone and the ornament on the surviving cylindrical part. The two decorated fragments do not join so that neither the original height of the stone nor the precise overall disposition of its ornamentation can now be ascertained.

George Talbot was appointed Surveyor-General of Maryland in 1683. In the aftermath of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, James Talbot's estate in Ballyconnell was confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 because he was a Catholic and he was granted an estate in 1655 at Castle Rubey, County Roscommon instead. He died in 1687. The Talbot lands in Killycluggin were distributed as follows-\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as belonging to ''Captain Gwilliams'' (i.e. the landlord of Ballyconnell, Captain Thomas Gwyllym) and the tenants as ''Edward Rely & Others''. \n\nIn the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663<ref>''The Hearth Money Rolls for the Baronies of Tullyhunco and Tullyhaw, County Cavan'', edited by Rev.

He became a merchant in Dorchester, Dorset but fled to France in 1633 when facing a warrant from the Exchequer for not paying customs. He married Mary Renald from Devon and died at Lissanover, County Cavan in 1661 and was buried at St. Orvins in Dublin (probably [[St. Audoen's Church, Dublin (Church of Ireland)]]),  despite wishing to be buried back in Dorchester. His will was published on 9 January 1665 leaving his son John Blachford as his sole heir. An Inquisition held in Cavan on 21 May 1667 found that his widow Mary Blachford and his heir John were seized of, inter alia, the land of Killeclogine alias Killecragan. He had sons John, Thomas, Ambrose and William (who became a Major) and daughters Mary and Frances. Major William Blachford was born in 1658 and died at Lissanover on 28 March 1727.

At that time the stone was in the same broken state in which it now appears and was situated some 10m SE of a stone circle (CV013-026002-). Macalister recorded local traditions which alleged that the damage to the stone had been carried out in living memory by local farmers in order to remove an obstruction to agricultural activities. Macalister also stated that people of the vicinity had dug around the stone in a vain search for buried treasure and in so doing had apparently destroyed a 'cist burial'. He did not, however, actually see this 'cist burial'. Some thirty years later a second decorated stone fragment, probably a portion of the same monolith, was discovered a short distance down-slope from the main piece. In the early summer of 1974 it was decided to remove the weathered and overgrown fragments to the National Museum of Ireland. A limited excavation was undertaken in its immediate vicinity which revealed that 'the stone stood in a flat-bottomed pit which had been deliberately sunk 80cm into the subsoil to receive it' (Raftery 1978, 51-2). Immediately E of the stone were two pits one of which may be identified as the remains of the cist burial identified by Macalister as it contained tiny fragments of burnt bone (CV013-026003-). The two fragments of the Killycluggin Stone are on display in the Cavan County Museum, Ballyjamesduff, while a replica stands at the cross-roads c. 250m NW of the original site. The following description of the stone is derived from Raftery (1978, 49-51). The main fragment has been worked to more-or-less cylindrical form on its surviving upper portion. That part which was intended to be below ground level is rough and irregular and projects awkwardly in one direction so that the stone as a whole is crudely L-shaped. The base of the stone slopes obliquely to its vertical axis. The entire upper surface of this stone had been smashed by deliberate and systematic hammering. This destruction continued along one side, whereby the ornament, down to the base of the stone was totally obliterated. The surviving ornament, which comprises combinations of sweeping curves and tight, hair-spring spirals \u2013 classic La T\u00e8ne motifs \u2013 is chiseled deeply and crisply into the prepared surface of the stone. The curvilinear patterns have been divided into rectangular panels by straight vertical lines and by horizontal lines at right angles to them which define the basal extremity of the ornamented area. The precise original width of only one such panel can now be ascertained (c. 0.9m wide and 0.75m high) but it may be estimated that four such panels of decoration once existed on the stone giving an original circumference of 3.6m. The smaller decorated fragment appears to represent a portion of the dome-shaped top of the original monolith and, in this regard, would have resembled that of the best known of the Irish aniconic stones, the stele from Turoe, Co. Galway (GA097-152----). The decoration on this fragment is of two types. Along one edge slight remains of curvilinear patterns, similar to those on the portion just described, survive. Sufficient remains to show that the upper limits of this decoration are defined by a straight line as is the case at the base of the stone, and traces of one of the lines which divide the ornament into vertical, rectangular panels are present here too. The convex upper surface of this fragment is decorated by a series of deeply chiseled, parallel lines which extend across the surface of the stone. The surviving edges of this panel of ornament are defined by a straight line which is incised at an oblique angle to the line which forms the boundary to the zones of curvilinear ornament.

Then it shifts back several months before when Joyeeta, ([[Payel Sarkar]]) an educated and beautiful  young girl from the City of [[Balurghat]](a municipal area, not a village as wrongly perceived by people of Southern part of West Bengal) comes to [[Kolkata]] to give an interview for her work. But her sister who was supposed to guide her around the city could not come due to the stroke of her father-in-law. She takes help from a stranger boy named Abhik ([[Abir Chatterjee]]) who bunks his job in order to help her but ends up the entire day with her. The next day Joyeeta returns to her village and soon realizes her love for Abhik. Meanwhile, in the city Abhik also realizes the same and started planning to go to Balurghat to meet her.\n\nThen a parallel story takes place where Noor Islam ([[Soham Chakraborty]]), a poor guy from the village of [[Murshidabad]] comes to [[English Bazar|Malda]] to find a suitable work. Noor falls for the heavenly beauty and charm of a gorgeous young girl Rhea ([[Mimi Chakraborty]]), who is an educated nurse by profession. Rhea happens to be Noor's neighbour and he watches her every morning for the last six months. One day Noor meets Rhea, and expresses his love for her. Rhea, however, is bold and independent, agrees to his love and commences to command him mercilessly. She puts him through several tests such as getting him to agree to organ donation, HIV testing, talking him to a police commissioner who is her father, fixing meeting with her former one-sided lover and so on. She wants him to decide on the basis of all that she's put him through as to whether he wants to marry her and spend the rest of his life with her. Noor responds affirmatively and the two grow to love each other unconditionally with the consent of their families.\n\nThen the story flashes back to the present where Noor takes Rhea to meet his parents. They ride the same bus which is boarded by Abhik too who went to meet Joyeeta albeit he is returning as he could not find her address. Then another bus shows Joyeeta who is returning to Balurghat from Kolkata, where she went again to meet Abhik. Besides, it also shows a glimpse of a mother and her child, a girls' hockey team, a newly married couple, two college students who are attracted to each other and a man returning from Dubai to see his five-year-old daughter for the first time. As they are about to reach their destination, the buses collide head-on, creating a devastating accident. People rush to their aid. Noor ends up with a severe head injury and Rhea forces him to go to the hospital by an ambulance which was leaving. She stays back to help others as being a nurse, it was her job. Abhik also starts helping others. Finally he sees Joyeeta injured in another bus. At the hospital, Abhik confesses his love to Joyeeta at her bedside, and she manages to regain consciousness. The film ends with a tragic part as showing Noor and Joyeeta dead. The concluding scene shows Noor's body being taken away by a hysteric Rhea and his grieving parents while Abhik affectionately caresses the palm of a lifeless Joyeeta inside the ICU only to leave the hospital later, in grief. The site of the crash is declared an accident prone-area, and the film ends with few messages on road safety. One can never understand the reason behind what life has in store for him/her. Hence, the name:  'Bojhena Shey Bojhena'.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Soham Chakraborty]] as Noor Islam\n* [[Mimi Chakraborty]] as Riya\n* [[Abir Chatterjee]] as Abheek\n* [[Payel Sarkar]] as Jayeeta\n* [[Ena Saha]] as Priyanka\n* [[Raj Chakraborty]] as cameo appearance<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gomolo.com/bojhe-na-se-bojhe-na-movie-cast-crew/45113|title=Bojhena Shey Bojhena (2012) cast & crew|work=Gomolo|accessdate=2015-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924045208/http://www.gomolo.com/bojhe-na-se-bojhe-na-movie-cast-crew/45113|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bhalobasa.in/articles/159738/Bojhena-Se-Bojhena--Bengali-Movie ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812212501/http://www.bhalobasa.in/articles/159738/Bojhena-Se-Bojhena--Bengali-Movie |date=12 August 2014 }}</ref>\n* [[Sancharee Mukherjee]] as taxi passenger\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe film's original soundtrack is composed by debutante [[Arindom Chatterjee]] whilst the background score and the title track is by [[Indraadip Dasgupta]], and the lyrics have been penned by [[Prasen]].

Meanwhile, in the city Abhik also realizes the same and started planning to go to Balurghat to meet her.\n\nThen a parallel story takes place where Noor Islam ([[Soham Chakraborty]]), a poor guy from the village of [[Murshidabad]] comes to [[English Bazar|Malda]] to find a suitable work. Noor falls for the heavenly beauty and charm of a gorgeous young girl Rhea ([[Mimi Chakraborty]]), who is an educated nurse by profession. Rhea happens to be Noor's neighbour and he watches her every morning for the last six months. One day Noor meets Rhea, and expresses his love for her. Rhea, however, is bold and independent, agrees to his love and commences to command him mercilessly. She puts him through several tests such as getting him to agree to organ donation, HIV testing, talking him to a police commissioner who is her father, fixing meeting with her former one-sided lover and so on. She wants him to decide on the basis of all that she's put him through as to whether he wants to marry her and spend the rest of his life with her. Noor responds affirmatively and the two grow to love each other unconditionally with the consent of their families.\n\nThen the story flashes back to the present where Noor takes Rhea to meet his parents. They ride the same bus which is boarded by Abhik too who went to meet Joyeeta albeit he is returning as he could not find her address. Then another bus shows Joyeeta who is returning to Balurghat from Kolkata, where she went again to meet Abhik. Besides, it also shows a glimpse of a mother and her child, a girls' hockey team, a newly married couple, two college students who are attracted to each other and a man returning from Dubai to see his five-year-old daughter for the first time. As they are about to reach their destination, the buses collide head-on, creating a devastating accident. People rush to their aid. Noor ends up with a severe head injury and Rhea forces him to go to the hospital by an ambulance which was leaving. She stays back to help others as being a nurse, it was her job. Abhik also starts helping others. Finally he sees Joyeeta injured in another bus. At the hospital, Abhik confesses his love to Joyeeta at her bedside, and she manages to regain consciousness. The film ends with a tragic part as showing Noor and Joyeeta dead. The concluding scene shows Noor's body being taken away by a hysteric Rhea and his grieving parents while Abhik affectionately caresses the palm of a lifeless Joyeeta inside the ICU only to leave the hospital later, in grief. The site of the crash is declared an accident prone-area, and the film ends with few messages on road safety. One can never understand the reason behind what life has in store for him/her. Hence, the name:  'Bojhena Shey Bojhena'.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Soham Chakraborty]] as Noor Islam\n* [[Mimi Chakraborty]] as Riya\n* [[Abir Chatterjee]] as Abheek\n* [[Payel Sarkar]] as Jayeeta\n* [[Ena Saha]] as Priyanka\n* [[Raj Chakraborty]] as cameo appearance<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gomolo.com/bojhe-na-se-bojhe-na-movie-cast-crew/45113|title=Bojhena Shey Bojhena (2012) cast & crew|work=Gomolo|accessdate=2015-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924045208/http://www.gomolo.com/bojhe-na-se-bojhe-na-movie-cast-crew/45113|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bhalobasa.in/articles/159738/Bojhena-Se-Bojhena--Bengali-Movie ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812212501/http://www.bhalobasa.in/articles/159738/Bojhena-Se-Bojhena--Bengali-Movie |date=12 August 2014 }}</ref>\n* [[Sancharee Mukherjee]] as taxi passenger\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe film's original soundtrack is composed by debutante [[Arindom Chatterjee]] whilst the background score and the title track is by [[Indraadip Dasgupta]], and the lyrics have been penned by [[Prasen]].
