That year, Smith took home second team [[All Star]] honors as the Atoms ran to the NASL championship title.  They set a record that season for allowing only 14 goals.  Smith returned each of the next two seasons, but the Atoms were unable to replicate their first year success.  Smith, on the other hand, continued to be recognized as one of the league's top defenders.  In 1974, he was an All Star honorable mention (third team) and in 1975, he became the first native born U.S. player in the NASL to earn first team All Star recognition.  Part of the reason for his success in 1975 came from a loan spell with [[League of Ireland First Division]] club, [[Dundalk F.C.|Dundalk]] during the 1974-1975 NASL off season.<ref>[http://www.philadelphiaatoms.com/history4.htm Philadelphia Atoms History]</ref>\n\nIn 1976, the Atoms sold Smith, and team mate [[Bob Rigby]], to the [[New York Cosmos (1970\u201385)|New York Cosmos]] for $100,000.

However, by his third season with the team, the influx of big name international players saw Smith's playing time drop to an all-time low of nine games.  At the end of the 1978 season, the Cosmos sent Smith to the [[San Diego Sockers (1978\u201396)|San Diego Sockers]].  In 1979, he was named an honorable mention All Star, his fifth time on an All Star list.  However, at the end of the season, the Sockers sent him to the [[Philadelphia Fury (1978\u201380)|Philadelphia Fury]] for the 1980 season.  The Atoms had folded while Smith was with the Cosmos and the Fury was a new expansion franchise in Philadelphia.\n\nSmith spent only one season with the Fury, but his time with the team led to his also playing for the [[Philadelphia Fever]] of [[Major Soccer League|Major Indoor Soccer League]] (MISL) during the 1980-1981 indoor season.  The Fever had already played a season, but coach [[George O'Neill]]\u2014hoping to draw on seasoned pros the way defending champions [[New York Arrows]] had\u2014remade the team with NASL veterans and drew on several Fury players, including Smith and teammate [[Bob Rigby]].  Despite the presence of Smith and other Fury players, the Fever performed poorly and soon vanished from the American soccer scene.  Smith then moved to the [[Montreal Manic]] of one last season in the NASL.  He retired at the end of 1981 season.\n\n==National team==\nSmith earned 18 [[cap (sports)|caps]] with the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. national team]].<ref>[http://www.soccerhall.org/Registry/MensNationalTeam_P-T.htm#S Soccer Hall of Fame: Player Registry]</ref>  His first appearance came in an August 12, 1973 victory over [[Poland national football team|Poland]].

In 1976, he saw time in several games, the last being a 3-0 loss to [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] in a playoff in [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]], which eliminated the U.S. from qualification for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesu/usa-intres-det70.html USA - Details of International Matches 1970-1979] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205054634/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesu/usa-intres-det70.html |date=February 5, 2010 }}</ref>  Smith would not play for the national team until 1980 when he played in his last game, a 1-1 tie with [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] on October 7.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesu/usa-intres-det80.html USA - Details of International Matches 1980-1989] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120909000829/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesu/usa-intres-det80.html |date=September 9, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Post-playing career==\nAfter retiring from playing professionally, Smith returned to New Jersey where he has coached youth soccer.

Controversially, Atari marketed the Jaguar as being the first 64-bit video game console,<ref name=\"Jaguar_NA_RD\"/> while competing with the existing [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|16-bit]] consoles ([[Sega Genesis]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]) and the 32-bit [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] platform (which launched the same year). Development on the Atari Jaguar started in the early 1990s by [[Flare Technology]]. The Jaguar shipped with ''[[Cybermorph]]'' as the [[pack-in game|pack-in]] game.<ref name=\"atariage.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.atariage.com/Jaguar/history.html|title=AtariAge - Atari Jaguar History|website=www.atariage.com}}</ref>\n\nThe multi-chip architecture, hardware bugs, and lacking developer support tools made game development difficult. Underwhelming sales further contributed to the console's lack of third-party support.<ref name=\"atariage.com\"/> This, in addition to the lack of internal development at Atari, led to a games library comprising only [[List of Atari Jaguar games|50 licensed titles]], plus another [[Atari Jaguar CD#Game library|13 games on the Jaguar CD]].\n\nAtari attempted to extend the lifespan of the system with the [[Atari Jaguar CD]] [[Video game accessory|add-on]] and marketing the Jaguar as the low-cost next generation console, with a price tag over $100 less than any of its competitors.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Once and Future Kings|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=80|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1995|pages=28\u201330}}</ref> With the release of the [[Sega Saturn]] and [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] in 1995, sales of the Jaguar continued to fall, ultimately selling no more than 250,000 units before it was discontinued in 1996. The [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]] of the Jaguar prompted Atari to leave the video game console market.\n\nAfter [[Hasbro Interactive]] acquired all Atari properties in 1998,<ref name=\"atarigoestohasbro\"/> the patents to the Jaguar were released into the [[public domain]], with the console being declared an open platform.<ref name=\"hasbro\"/> Since then, the Jaguar has gained a cult following, with a developer base that produces [[homebrew (video games)|homebrew games]] for the console.<ref name=\"redundant\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Development===\nThe Jaguar was developed by the members of [[Flare Technology]], a company formed by [[Martin Brennan (engineer)|Martin Brennan]] and [[John Mathieson (computer scientist)|John Mathieson]]. The team had claimed that they could not only make a console superior to the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] or the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], but they could also be cost-effective.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Impressed by their work on the [[Konix Multisystem]], Atari persuaded them to close Flare and form a new company called [[Flare Technology|Flare II]], with Atari providing the funding.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Flare II initially set to work designing two consoles for Atari. One was a 32-bit architecture (codenamed \"[[Atari Panther|Panther]]\"), and the other was a 64-bit system (codenamed \"Jaguar\"); however, work on the Jaguar design progressed faster than expected, so Atari canceled the Panther project to focus on the more promising Jaguar.\n\nThe Jaguar was unveiled in August 1993 at the Chicago Consumer Entertainment Show.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Atari: From Boom to Bust and Back Again |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=4|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=April 1995|page=39}}</ref>\n\n===Launch===\nThe Jaguar was launched on November 23, 1993, at a price of $249.99,<ref name=\"gamepro\"/> under a $500 million manufacturing deal with [[IBM]]. The system was initially available only in the [[Test market|test markets]] of [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco]], under the slogan \"Do the Math\",<ref name=\"gamepro\"/> claiming superiority over competing 16-bit and 32-bit systems.

The company \"ventured late into third party software support\" while competing console [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]]'s \"18 month public relations blitz\" would result in \"an avalanche of software support\", the magazine reported.<ref name=\"cgw199401\">{{Cite magazine |last=Miller |first=Chuck |last2=Dille |first2=H.

Atari even ran [[infomercial|early morning infomercials]], with enthusiastic salesmen touting the powerful game system, in order to gain even more attention. These infomercials would run for most of 1995, but would not significantly increase sales even further.<ref name=\"NGen24\">{{cite magazine|last=Thomas|first=Don |title=Atari's Historic Road to Nowhere|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=24 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=December 1996|pages=97\u2013104}}</ref>\n\nSam Tramiel, Atari's President, was a little worried about the upcoming [[Sega Saturn]] and [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] consoles. In a 1995 interview with ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'', he declared that the Jaguar was as powerful, if not more powerful, than the Sega Saturn, and slightly weaker than the PlayStation.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Atari's President Talks Back |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=7 |date=July 1995|pages=6\u201312}}</ref> ''Next Generation'' received a deluge of letters in response to Tramiel's comments, particularly his threat to bring Sony to court for [[dumping (pricing policy)|price dumping]] if the PlayStation entered the U.S. market at a retail price below $300{{refn|group=aj|Many readers found this threat hollow and hypocritical, since Tramiel noted in the same interview that Atari were themselves selling the Jaguar at a loss. However, as noted by the editor in response to the letters, price dumping does not have to do with a product being priced below cost, but its being priced much lower in one country than another (which, as Tramiel said, is illegal). Tramiel and ''Next Generation'' agreed that the PlayStation's Japanese price converts to approximately $500.}} and his remark that the small number of third party Jaguar games was good for Atari's profitability, which angered Jaguar owners who were already frustrated at how few games were coming out for the system.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Letters|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=10|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=October 1995|page=140}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, Atari had severely limited financial resources, and so could not create the level of marketing which has historically backed successful gaming consoles.<ref name=\"NGen24\"/>\n\nIn May and September of 1995, [[Sega]] and [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony]] came out with the Saturn and PlayStation, respectively, and both those consoles began to outsell the Jaguar rapidly. In Atari's 1995 annual report, it noted: {{quote|''Jaguar sales were substantially below Atari's expectations, and Atari's business and financial results were materially adversely affected in 1995 as Atari continued to invest heavily in Jaguar game development, entered into arrangements to publish certain licensed titles and reduced the retail price for its Jaguar console unit. Atari attributes the poor performance of Jaguar to a number of factors including (i) extensive delays in development of software for the Jaguar which resulted in reduced orders due to consumer concern as to when titles for the platform would be released and how many titles would ultimately be available, and (ii) the introduction of competing products by Sega and Sony in May 1995 and September 1995, respectively.''<ref>[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/802019/0000891618-96-000213.txt Atari Corporation Annual Report, 1993]. pp 3.</ref>}} Sales of the 3DO system, if not high, even placed the Jaguar into the rear-view mirror. The ability of bringing select Sega games to the Jaguar, as part of a settlement on Atari's lawsuit in August 1994 that Sega had infringed its patents, didn't even get to see the light of day as well.\n\n===Decline===\nAfter a Board of Directors' meeting on October 31, 1995, a series of mass layoffs and insider statements fueled journalistic speculation that Atari had ceased development for the Jaguar and was simply trying to liquidate all remaining consoles, by slashing its price to the liquidation value of $99, before going into PC software development.<ref name=\"NGen13\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Atari Drops Jaguar?|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=13|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1996|page=21|quote=Then in November, UK newspaper ''The Sunday Times'' ... put forward that Atari plans to give up on the Jaguar in favor of PC development ...

Unfortunately, in January 1996, with production of the Jaguar now halted, and with no new products to sell at all, the Tramiel family decided to sell themselves out of the video game industry.\n\nIn its [[Form 10-K405|10-K405 SEC Filing]], filed April 12, 1996,<ref name=\"10-K405 SEC Filing, filed by ATARI CORP on 4/12/1996\"/> Atari informed their stockholders that its revenues had declined by more than half, from $38.7 million in 1994 to $14.6 million in 1995, then gave them the news on the truly dire nature of the Jaguar: {{quote|''From the introduction of Jaguar in late 1993 through the end of 1995, Atari sold approximately 125,000 units of Jaguar.

As a result, [[Atari|the Atari name]] all but vanished from the consumer market for good.\n\n==Technical issues==\n===Hardware Bugs===\nThe Jaguar's underlying hardware was crippled by a flaw in the CPU's [[memory controller]], which prevented code execution out of system [[Random-access memory|RAM]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Less severe defects included a buggy [[Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter|UART]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The memory controller flaw could have been mitigated by a mature code-development environment, to unburden the programmer from having to micromanage small chunks of code.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Jaguar's development tools left much to the programmer's own implementation, as documentation was incomplete.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nDesign specs for the console allude to the GPU or DSP being capable of acting as a CPU, leaving the Motorola 68000 to read controller inputs. Atari's Leonard Tramiel also specifically suggested that the 68000 not be used by developers.<ref name=\"Owl\">{{cite web|url=http://atariowlproject.blogspot.com/2009/10/atari-jaguar-homebrew-whats-this-lay.html |title=What's this \"Lay off the 68k\" and \"GPU in Main\" Malarkey? (TECHNICAL) |author=Joe Venor |publisher=The Owl Project |date=2009 |accessdate=18 February 2018}}</ref> In practice, however, many developers used the Motorola 68000 to drive gameplay logic due to the greater developer familiarity with the 68000, bugs that made using the custom chips difficult, lacking developer support tools (particularly early on), and the adequacy of the 68000 for certain types of games.<ref name=\"Owl\"/>\n\n===Bit count controversy===\nAtari tried to play down competing consoles by proclaiming the Jaguar was the only \"64-bit\" system. This claim is questioned by some, because the ([[Motorola 68000]]) [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and the \"Tom\" [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] executes a 32-bit instruction-set, but sends control signals to the 64-bit graphics co-processors. Atari's reasoning that the 32-bit \"Tom\" and \"Jerry\" chips work in tandem to add up to a 64-bit system was ridiculed in a mini-editorial by ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'', which commented that \"If Sega did the math for the Sega Saturn the way Atari did the math for their 64-bit Jaguar system, the Sega Saturn would be a 112-bit monster of a machine.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Hot Number: 112|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=71|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=June 1995|page=30}}</ref> ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'', while giving a mostly negative review of the Jaguar, maintained that it is a true 64-bit system, since the data path from the [[DRAM]] to the CPU and Tom and Jerry chips is 64 bits wide.<ref name=\"NGen12\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Which Game System is the Best!?|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=12|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=December 1995|pages=36\u201385}}</ref>\n\n==Technical specifications==\n[[File:Atari-Jaguar-Motherboard-L.jpg|thumb|The Jaguar utilized a multi-chip architecture that was difficult for most developers to use.]]\n\nFrom the Jaguar Software Reference manual, page 1:<ref name=atarimanual>{{cite book | author = Atari Corp. | title = Jaguar Software Reference Manual - Version 2.4 | publisher = Atari Corp. | year = 1995 | url = http://www.hillsoftware.com/files/atari/jaguar/jag_v8.pdf | access-date = November 26, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130315005843/http://www.hillsoftware.com/files/atari/jaguar/jag_v8.pdf | archive-date = March 15, 2013 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Jaguar is a custom chip set primarily intended to be the heart of a very high-performance games/leisure computer.

Jaguar provides these blocks with a 64-bit data path to external memory devices, and is capable of a very high data transfer rate into external dynamic RAM.</blockquote>\n\n===Processors===\n* \"Tom\" Chip, 26.59 [[Hertz|MHz]]\n** [[Graphics processing unit]] (GPU) \u2013 32-[[bit]] [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] architecture, 4 [[kilobyte|KB]] internal RAM, all graphical effects are software-based.\n*** Core has some additional instructions intended for 3D operations\n** Object Processor \u2013 64-bit non-programmable; provides all video output from system.\n** [[Blitter]] \u2013 64-bit high speed logic operations, [[z-buffering]] and [[Gouraud shading]], with 64-bit internal registers.\n** [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]] controller, 8, 16, 32 and 64-bit memory management\n* \"Jerry\" Chip, 26.59 [[Hertz|MHz]]\n** Digital Signal Processor \u2013 32-[[bit]] [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] architecture, 8&nbsp;KB internal RAM\n*** Similar [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] core as the [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]], additional instructions intended for audio operations\n** CD-quality sound (16-bit stereo)\n*** Number of sound channels limited by software\n*** Two DACs (stereo) convert digital data to analog sound signals\n*** Full [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] capabilities\n** [[Sample-based synthesis|Wavetable synthesis]] and AM synthesis\n** A clock control block, incorporating timers, and a [[Universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter|UART]]\n** Joystick control\n* [[Motorola 68000]] \"used as a manager\".<ref>Atari Jaguar Software Reference Manual, Atari Corp. 1995, Pg 2</ref>\n** General purpose 16/32-bit control processor, 13.295&nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]]\n\n===Other Jaguar features===\n[[File:Atari-Jaguar-Console-Back.jpg|thumb|250px|The inputs and outputs of an [[NTSC]] Atari Jaguar]]\n* [[Random-access memory|RAM]]: 2&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] on a 64-bit bus using 4 16-bit fast page mode DRAMs (80&nbsp;[[Nanosecond|ns]])<ref>[ftp://untergrund.net/users/ggn/Atari%20HQ/Documents/Atari/Jaguar/Eco1686.pdf Atari Jaguar Order], [[Atari]], 1994</ref>\n* Storage: [[ROM cartridge]]s \u2013 up to 6&nbsp;MB\n* DSP-port (JagLink)\n* Monitor-port (Composite/S-Video/RGB)\n* Antenna-port (UHF/VHF) Fixed at 591&nbsp;MHz in Europe\n** Not present on French model\n* Support for ComLynx [[Input/output|I/O]]\n* NTSC/PAL machines can be identified by their power LED colour, Red = NTSC, Green = PAL\n\n===COJAG arcade games===\n[[Atari Games]] licensed the Atari Jaguar's chipset for use in its arcade games.

It ran the lightgun games ''[[Area 51 (1995 video game)|Area 51]]'' and ''[[Maximum Force]]'', which were released by Atari as dedicated cabinets or as the Area 51/Maximum Force combo machine. Other games (''3 On 3 Basketball''; ''Fishin' Frenzy''; ''Freeze''; ''Vicious Circle'') were developed but never released.\n\n===Atari Jaguar Duo===\nThe '''Atari Jaguar Duo''' was a proposed console similar to the [[TurboDuo]] and [[Sega Genesis#Variations|Genesis CDX]]. It was an attempt by [[Atari]] to combine the Atari Jaguar and [[Atari Jaguar CD]] to make a new console. A prototype model, described by journalists as resembling a [[bathroom scale]], was unveiled at the 1995 Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]],<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=WCES: The Calm Before the Storm |journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=3|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1995|page=19}}</ref> but the console was cancelled before production could begin.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Edwards |first=Benj |url=https://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/story/264435/10-unreleased-video-game-consoles/3 |title=10 Unreleased Video Game Consoles - Atari Jaguar Duo (1995) - Slideshow from |magazine=PCMag.com |date=May 14, 2011 |accessdate=November 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Peripherals==\n{{multiple image\n| footer   = The redesigned controller, dubbed the \"ProController\", included additional action buttons, and the JagLink peripheral added network styled play to compatible games.\n| image1   = Atari-Jaguar-Pro-Controller-Flat.jpg\n| width1   = 260\n| image2   = Atari Jag Link connectors.jpg\n| width2   = 160\n}}\n\nPrior to the launch of the console in November 1993, Atari had announced a variety of peripherals and add-ons for the Jaguar to be released over the console's lifespan.

The Jaglink was compatible with three games: ''[[AirCars]]'', ''[[BattleSphere]]'' and ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]''.\n\nIn 1994 at the CES, Atari announced that it had partnered with Phylon, Inc. to create the Jaguar Voice/Data Communicator. The unit was delayed and eventually in 1995 mass production was canceled, but not before an estimated 100 units were produced. The Jaguar Voice Modem or JVM, as it became known, utilized a 19.9kbit/s dial up modem and had the ability to answer incoming phone calls and store up to 18 phone numbers. Players were required to directly dial each other for online game play. The only Jaguar game that supports the JVM is ''[[Ultra Vortek]]''; the modem is initialized in the ''Ultra Vortek'' start up screen by entering 911 on the key pad.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vinciguerra|first=Robert|title=A Complete History of Online Console Gaming in the United States|url=http://www.revrob.com/sci-a-tech-topmenu-52/38-a-complete-history-of-online-console-gaming-in-the-united-states|work=The Rev.

It was released in September 1995, two years after the Jaguar's launch. Twelve games were released for the system during its manufacturing lifetime, with more being made later by [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] developers. Each Jaguar CD unit came with a [[Virtual Light Machine]], which displayed light patterns corresponding to music, if the user inserts an audio CD into the console. It was developed by [[Jeff Minter]], who had created the program after experimenting with graphics during the development of ''[[Tempest 2000]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Minter|first1=Jeff|title=VLM - History|url=http://www.minotaurproject.co.uk/vlm.php|publisher=[[Jeff Minter|Llamasoft]]|accessdate=June 11, 2015}}</ref> The program was deemed a spiritual successor to the [[Atari Video Music]], a system which served a similar purpose, released in 1976.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wolf|first1=Mark J.

Controversially, Atari marketed the Jaguar as being the first 64-bit video game console,<ref name=\"Jaguar_NA_RD\"/> while competing with the existing [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|16-bit]] consoles ([[Sega Genesis]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]) and the 32-bit [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] platform (which launched the same year). Development on the Atari Jaguar started in the early 1990s by [[Flare Technology]]. The Jaguar shipped with ''[[Cybermorph]]'' as the [[pack-in game|pack-in]] game.<ref name=\"atariage.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.atariage.com/Jaguar/history.html|title=AtariAge - Atari Jaguar History|website=www.atariage.com}}</ref>\n\nThe multi-chip architecture, hardware bugs, and lacking developer support tools made game development difficult. Underwhelming sales further contributed to the console's lack of third-party support.<ref name=\"atariage.com\"/> This, in addition to the lack of internal development at Atari, led to a games library comprising only [[List of Atari Jaguar games|50 licensed titles]], plus another [[Atari Jaguar CD#Game library|13 games on the Jaguar CD]].\n\nAtari attempted to extend the lifespan of the system with the [[Atari Jaguar CD]] [[Video game accessory|add-on]] and marketing the Jaguar as the low-cost next generation console, with a price tag over $100 less than any of its competitors.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Once and Future Kings|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=80|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1995|pages=28\u201330}}</ref> With the release of the [[Sega Saturn]] and [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] in 1995, sales of the Jaguar continued to fall, ultimately selling no more than 250,000 units before it was discontinued in 1996. The [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]] of the Jaguar prompted Atari to leave the video game console market.\n\nAfter [[Hasbro Interactive]] acquired all Atari properties in 1998,<ref name=\"atarigoestohasbro\"/> the patents to the Jaguar were released into the [[public domain]], with the console being declared an open platform.<ref name=\"hasbro\"/> Since then, the Jaguar has gained a cult following, with a developer base that produces [[homebrew (video games)|homebrew games]] for the console.<ref name=\"redundant\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Development===\nThe Jaguar was developed by the members of [[Flare Technology]], a company formed by [[Martin Brennan (engineer)|Martin Brennan]] and [[John Mathieson (computer scientist)|John Mathieson]]. The team had claimed that they could not only make a console superior to the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] or the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], but they could also be cost-effective.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Impressed by their work on the [[Konix Multisystem]], Atari persuaded them to close Flare and form a new company called [[Flare Technology|Flare II]], with Atari providing the funding.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Flare II initially set to work designing two consoles for Atari. One was a 32-bit architecture (codenamed \"[[Atari Panther|Panther]]\"), and the other was a 64-bit system (codenamed \"Jaguar\"); however, work on the Jaguar design progressed faster than expected, so Atari canceled the Panther project to focus on the more promising Jaguar.\n\nThe Jaguar was unveiled in August 1993 at the Chicago Consumer Entertainment Show.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Atari: From Boom to Bust and Back Again |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=4|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=April 1995|page=39}}</ref>\n\n===Launch===\nThe Jaguar was launched on November 23, 1993, at a price of $249.99,<ref name=\"gamepro\"/> under a $500 million manufacturing deal with [[IBM]]. The system was initially available only in the [[Test market|test markets]] of [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco]], under the slogan \"Do the Math\",<ref name=\"gamepro\"/> claiming superiority over competing 16-bit and 32-bit systems.

Atari even ran [[infomercial|early morning infomercials]], with enthusiastic salesmen touting the powerful game system, in order to gain even more attention.

In a 1995 interview with ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'', he declared that the Jaguar was as powerful, if not more powerful, than the Sega Saturn, and slightly weaker than the PlayStation.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Atari's President Talks Back |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=7 |date=July 1995|pages=6\u201312}}</ref> ''Next Generation'' received a deluge of letters in response to Tramiel's comments, particularly his threat to bring Sony to court for [[dumping (pricing policy)|price dumping]] if the PlayStation entered the U.S. market at a retail price below $300{{refn|group=aj|Many readers found this threat hollow and hypocritical, since Tramiel noted in the same interview that Atari were themselves selling the Jaguar at a loss. However, as noted by the editor in response to the letters, price dumping does not have to do with a product being priced below cost, but its being priced much lower in one country than another (which, as Tramiel said, is illegal). Tramiel and ''Next Generation'' agreed that the PlayStation's Japanese price converts to approximately $500.}} and his remark that the small number of third party Jaguar games was good for Atari's profitability, which angered Jaguar owners who were already frustrated at how few games were coming out for the system.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Letters|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=10|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=October 1995|page=140}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, Atari had severely limited financial resources, and so could not create the level of marketing which has historically backed successful gaming consoles.<ref name=\"NGen24\"/>\n\nIn May and September of 1995, [[Sega]] and [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony]] came out with the Saturn and PlayStation, respectively, and both those consoles began to outsell the Jaguar rapidly. In Atari's 1995 annual report, it noted: {{quote|''Jaguar sales were substantially below Atari's expectations, and Atari's business and financial results were materially adversely affected in 1995 as Atari continued to invest heavily in Jaguar game development, entered into arrangements to publish certain licensed titles and reduced the retail price for its Jaguar console unit. Atari attributes the poor performance of Jaguar to a number of factors including (i) extensive delays in development of software for the Jaguar which resulted in reduced orders due to consumer concern as to when titles for the platform would be released and how many titles would ultimately be available, and (ii) the introduction of competing products by Sega and Sony in May 1995 and September 1995, respectively.''<ref>[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/802019/0000891618-96-000213.txt Atari Corporation Annual Report, 1993]. pp 3.</ref>}} Sales of the 3DO system, if not high, even placed the Jaguar into the rear-view mirror. The ability of bringing select Sega games to the Jaguar, as part of a settlement on Atari's lawsuit in August 1994 that Sega had infringed its patents, didn't even get to see the light of day as well.\n\n===Decline===\nAfter a Board of Directors' meeting on October 31, 1995, a series of mass layoffs and insider statements fueled journalistic speculation that Atari had ceased development for the Jaguar and was simply trying to liquidate all remaining consoles, by slashing its price to the liquidation value of $99, before going into PC software development.<ref name=\"NGen13\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Atari Drops Jaguar?|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=13|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1996|page=21|quote=Then in November, UK newspaper ''The Sunday Times'' ... put forward that Atari plans to give up on the Jaguar in favor of PC development ...

Unfortunately, in January 1996, with production of the Jaguar now halted, and with no new products to sell at all, the Tramiel family decided to sell themselves out of the video game industry.\n\nIn its [[Form 10-K405|10-K405 SEC Filing]], filed April 12, 1996,<ref name=\"10-K405 SEC Filing, filed by ATARI CORP on 4/12/1996\"/> Atari informed their stockholders that its revenues had declined by more than half, from $38.7 million in 1994 to $14.6 million in 1995, then gave them the news on the truly dire nature of the Jaguar: {{quote|''From the introduction of Jaguar in late 1993 through the end of 1995, Atari sold approximately 125,000 units of Jaguar.

As a result, [[Atari|the Atari name]] all but vanished from the consumer market for good.\n\n==Technical issues==\n===Hardware Bugs===\nThe Jaguar's underlying hardware was crippled by a flaw in the CPU's [[memory controller]], which prevented code execution out of system [[Random-access memory|RAM]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Less severe defects included a buggy [[Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter|UART]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The memory controller flaw could have been mitigated by a mature code-development environment, to unburden the programmer from having to micromanage small chunks of code.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Jaguar's development tools left much to the programmer's own implementation, as documentation was incomplete.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nDesign specs for the console allude to the GPU or DSP being capable of acting as a CPU, leaving the Motorola 68000 to read controller inputs. Atari's Leonard Tramiel also specifically suggested that the 68000 not be used by developers.<ref name=\"Owl\">{{cite web|url=http://atariowlproject.blogspot.com/2009/10/atari-jaguar-homebrew-whats-this-lay.html |title=What's this \"Lay off the 68k\" and \"GPU in Main\" Malarkey?

Atari's reasoning that the 32-bit \"Tom\" and \"Jerry\" chips work in tandem to add up to a 64-bit system was ridiculed in a mini-editorial by ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'', which commented that \"If Sega did the math for the Sega Saturn the way Atari did the math for their 64-bit Jaguar system, the Sega Saturn would be a 112-bit monster of a machine.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Hot Number: 112|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=71|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=June 1995|page=30}}</ref> ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'', while giving a mostly negative review of the Jaguar, maintained that it is a true 64-bit system, since the data path from the [[DRAM]] to the CPU and Tom and Jerry chips is 64 bits wide.<ref name=\"NGen12\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Which Game System is the Best!?|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=12|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=December 1995|pages=36\u201385}}</ref>\n\n==Technical specifications==\n[[File:Atari-Jaguar-Motherboard-L.jpg|thumb|The Jaguar utilized a multi-chip architecture that was difficult for most developers to use.]]\n\nFrom the Jaguar Software Reference manual, page 1:<ref name=atarimanual>{{cite book | author = Atari Corp. | title = Jaguar Software Reference Manual - Version 2.4 | publisher = Atari Corp. | year = 1995 | url = http://www.hillsoftware.com/files/atari/jaguar/jag_v8.pdf | access-date = November 26, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130315005843/http://www.hillsoftware.com/files/atari/jaguar/jag_v8.pdf | archive-date = March 15, 2013 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Jaguar is a custom chip set primarily intended to be the heart of a very high-performance games/leisure computer.

It ran the lightgun games ''[[Area 51 (1995 video game)|Area 51]]'' and ''[[Maximum Force]]'', which were released by Atari as dedicated cabinets or as the Area 51/Maximum Force combo machine. Other games (''3 On 3 Basketball''; ''Fishin' Frenzy''; ''Freeze''; ''Vicious Circle'') were developed but never released.\n\n===Atari Jaguar Duo===\nThe '''Atari Jaguar Duo''' was a proposed console similar to the [[TurboDuo]] and [[Sega Genesis#Variations|Genesis CDX]]. It was an attempt by [[Atari]] to combine the Atari Jaguar and [[Atari Jaguar CD]] to make a new console. A prototype model, described by journalists as resembling a [[bathroom scale]], was unveiled at the 1995 Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]],<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=WCES: The Calm Before the Storm |journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=3|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1995|page=19}}</ref> but the console was cancelled before production could begin.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Edwards |first=Benj |url=https://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/story/264435/10-unreleased-video-game-consoles/3 |title=10 Unreleased Video Game Consoles - Atari Jaguar Duo (1995) - Slideshow from |magazine=PCMag.com |date=May 14, 2011 |accessdate=November 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Peripherals==\n{{multiple image\n| footer   = The redesigned controller, dubbed the \"ProController\", included additional action buttons, and the JagLink peripheral added network styled play to compatible games.\n| image1   = Atari-Jaguar-Pro-Controller-Flat.jpg\n| width1   = 260\n| image2   = Atari Jag Link connectors.jpg\n| width2   = 160\n}}\n\nPrior to the launch of the console in November 1993, Atari had announced a variety of peripherals and add-ons for the Jaguar to be released over the console's lifespan. This included a [[CD-ROM]]-based add-on console, a [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up internet link]] with support for online gaming, a [[virtual reality]] headset, and an [[MPEG-2]] video card.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Atari's 64-bit Jaguar Stalks the Competition|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=51|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=October 1993|pages=16\u201317}}</ref><ref name=\"cgw199311\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=112 | title=Atari Jaguar Unveiled\u2014Stalks 3DO | work=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1993 | accessdate=28 March 2016 | pages=10\u201311 }}</ref> However, due to the poor sales and eventual commercial failure of the Jaguar, most of the peripherals in development were scrapped. The only peripherals and add-ons released by Atari for the Jaguar were a redesigned controller, an adapter for [[Multiplayer video game|four players]], a CD console add-on, and a link cable for [[local area network]] (LAN) gaming.\n\nThe redesigned second controller for the Jaguar, the ProController by Atari, added three more face buttons and two triggers.<ref name=\"GPro89\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Feline Friends |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=89 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=February 1996|page=22}}</ref> The controller was created in response to the criticism of the original controller that the console came with, which was said to not possess enough buttons for fighting games in particular.

The Jaglink was compatible with three games: ''[[AirCars]]'', ''[[BattleSphere]]'' and ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]''.\n\nIn 1994 at the CES, Atari announced that it had partnered with Phylon, Inc. to create the Jaguar Voice/Data Communicator. The unit was delayed and eventually in 1995 mass production was canceled, but not before an estimated 100 units were produced. The Jaguar Voice Modem or JVM, as it became known, utilized a 19.9kbit/s dial up modem and had the ability to answer incoming phone calls and store up to 18 phone numbers. Players were required to directly dial each other for online game play. The only Jaguar game that supports the JVM is ''[[Ultra Vortek]]''; the modem is initialized in the ''Ultra Vortek'' start up screen by entering 911 on the key pad.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vinciguerra|first=Robert|title=A Complete History of Online Console Gaming in the United States|url=http://www.revrob.com/sci-a-tech-topmenu-52/38-a-complete-history-of-online-console-gaming-in-the-united-states|work=The Rev.

Twelve games were released for the system during its manufacturing lifetime, with more being made later by [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] developers. Each Jaguar CD unit came with a [[Virtual Light Machine]], which displayed light patterns corresponding to music, if the user inserts an audio CD into the console.

They praised the power of the hardware but criticized the controller, and were dubious of how the software lineup would turn out, commenting that Atari's failure to secure support from key third party publishers such as [[Capcom]] was a bad sign. They concluded that \"Like the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]], the Jaguar is a risky investment \u2013 just not quite as expensive.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=System Shopper|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=63|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=December 1993|pages=46\u201349}}</ref>\n\nThe Jaguar won ''[[GameFan]]'''s \"Best New System\" award for 1993.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=GameFan's 2nd Annual Megawards|url=https://archive.org/stream/GamefanVolume2Issue02/GamefanVolume2Issue02February1994#page/n57/mode/2up|magazine=[[GameFan]]|issue=Volume 2, Issue 2|publisher=Shinno Media|date=January 1994|page=58|quote=Best New System: Winner: The Atari Jaguar}}</ref>\n\nThe small size and poor quality of the Jaguar's game library became the most commonly cited reason for its failure in the marketplace. The pack-in game ''[[Cybermorph]]'', despite being an impressive polygonal game for its time, was criticized for design flaws and a weak color palette, and compared unfavorably with the SNES's ''[[Star Fox (1993 video game)|Star Fox]]''. Other early releases like ''[[Trevor McFur in the Crescent Galaxy]]'', ''[[Raiden (video game)|Raiden]]'', and ''[[Evolution: Dino Dudes]]'' also received poor reviews, the latter two for failing to take full advantage of the Jaguar's hardware.  Jaguar did eventually earn praise with titles such as ''[[Tempest 2000]]'', ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', and ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]''.<ref>''[http://www.atariage.com/Jaguar/history.html Atari Jaguar History]''.

It was established by [[William Ewart Gladstone]] in 1882 to provide club facilities for [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] campaigners among the newly enlarged electorate following the [[Third Reform Act]] in 1884. The club's [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] building on the Embankment of the river [[Thames]] is the second-largest club-house ever built. Designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]], it was completed in 1887.<ref name=\"autogenerated1979\">Lejeune, Anthony, with Malcolm Lewis, ''The Gentlemen's Clubs of London'' (Bracken Books, 1979 reprinted 1984 and 1987) chapter on National Liberal Club.</ref> Its facilities include a dining room, a bar, function rooms, a billiards room, a [[smoking room]], a library and an outdoor riverside terrace. It is located at [[Whitehall Court|Whitehall Place]], close to the [[Houses of Parliament]], the [[Thames Embankment]] and [[Trafalgar Square]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nThe genesis of the club lay with Liberal party activist (and later MP) [[Arthur John Williams]], who proposed the creation of such a club at a Special General Meeting of the short-lived Century Club on 14 May 1882, so as to provide \"a home for democracy, void of the class distinction associated with the [[Devonshire Club|Devonshire]] and [[Reform Club]]s\". The first full meeting of the new club was held on 16 November 1882, at the Westminster Palace Hotel on Victoria Street. The Century Club itself then merged into the NLC at the end of the year.<ref>''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'', Volume 88, Smith, Elder and Co. (1903), pp. 314, 319, states that the Century Club merged into the NLC \"'''more than''' twenty years ago.\"</ref> In its early years, the club declared its objects to be: \n::1. The provision of an inexpensive meeting place for Liberals and their friends from all over the country.\n::2. The furtherance of the Liberal cause.\n::3. The foundation of a political and historical library as a memorial to Gladstone and his work.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\">Peter Harris, \"A Meeting Place for Liberals\", ''Journal of Liberal History'', No. 51, Summer 2006, pp. 18\u201323.</ref>\nAn initial circular for subscribers meant that by the end of 1882, 2,500 men from over 500 towns and districts had already signed up for the new club, and membership would reach 6,500 by the time the clubhouse opened in 1887.<ref name=\"autogenerated1925\">Robert Steven, ''The National Liberal Club: Politics and Persons'' (Robert Holden, London, 1925), 91pp.</ref>\n\n[[File:Elliott & Fry10a.jpg|thumb|left|Former Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] was the club's first President. A keen feller of trees in his spare time, his axe is still on display in the club smoking room today, along with a chest made from an oak tree cut down by Gladstone.]]\nThe club's foundation stone was laid by Gladstone on 9 November 1884, when he declared \"Speaking generally, I should say there could not be a less interesting occasion than the laying of the foundation-stone of a Club in London. For, after all, what are the Clubs of London? I am afraid little else than temples of luxury and ease. This, however, is a club of a very different character\", and envisioned the club as a popular institution for the mass electorate.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">G. W. E. Russell, ''Fifteen Chapters of Autobiography''(Thomas Nelson, London, undated), Chapter XXII.</ref> However, another of the club's founders, [[George W. E. Russell|G. W. E. Russell]], noted \"We certainly never foresaw the palatial pile of terra-cotta and glazed tiles which now bears that name. Our modest object was to provide a central meeting-place for Metropolitan and provincial Liberals, where all the comforts of life should be attainable at what are called 'popular prices'\", but added \"at the least, we meant our Club to be a place of \"ease\" to the Radical toiler. But Gladstone insisted that it was to be a workshop dedicated to strenuous labour.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> Funds for the clubhouse were raised by selling 40,000 shares of \u00a35 each, in a Limited Liability Company, with the unusual stipulation that \"No shareholder should have more than ''ten'' votes\", so as to prevent a few wealthy men from dominating the club.<ref name=\"autogenerated1925\"/> However, this only raised \u00a370,000,<ref name=\"autogenerated2012\"/> and so an additional \u00a352,400 was raised for the construction of the clubhouse by the Liberal Central Association.<ref>Roy Douglas, ''The History of the Liberal Party, 1895\u20131970'' (Sidgwick & Jackson, London, 1971), p. 17.</ref> The remaining \u00a330,000 necessary was raised by mortgage debentures.<ref name=\"autogenerated2012\"/>\n\nIn the five years between the club's establishment and completion of the building in 1887, it occupied temporary premises on the corner of [[Northumberland Avenue]] and Trafalgar Square. During this time, a [[parliamentary question]] was asked in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] about the [[White Ensign]] being raised on the club's flagpole as part of a prank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1883/may/04/the-national-liberal-club |title=THE NATIONAL LIBERAL CLUB.

Indeed, Chamberlain had been one of the NLC's most enthusiastic promoters upon its launch. At the 1884 ceremony of Gladstone's foundation-stone-laying for the club, Hartington had argued that the club would be the future home of Chamberlain's Radical [[Birmingham Caucus]], and Chamberlain pointedly refused to contradict him.<ref>Sir Alexander Mackintosh, ''Joseph Chamberlain: An Honest Biography'' (Hodder and Stoughton, London, 1914), p. 327.</ref> Chamberlain himself resigned in 1886, shortly after the Home Rule split, Hartington and other prominent Liberal Unionists followed early in 1887,<ref name=\"autogenerated1891\">Hamilton Fyfe and [[Joseph Irving]] (eds.), ''The Annals of Our Time ...: pt. 1. 20 June 1887 \u2013 December 1890'' (Macmillan, London, 1891).</ref> and when a further 130 Unionists simultaneously seceded from the club in 1889, the ''[[Scots Observer]]'' called it \"one of the most important events that has recently occurred in home politics\", due to its ramifications for the Liberal Party breaking in two.<ref>''The Scots Observer'', Vol. 1 (1889), p. 58.</ref>\n\nThe club enjoyed a reputation for radicalism, and H. V. Emy records that Radicals secured \n{{quote|a distinct success when the Radical wing of the National Liberal Club (NLC) captured the club's organisation in the summer of 1897 and elected a new political committee with [[Henry Labouch\u00e8re|[Henry] Labouchere]] as the chairman and [[Harold Reckitt|H.

The Committee itself included [[Robert Reid, 1st Earl Loreburn|Sir Robert Reid]], [[Philip Stanhope, 1st Baron Weardale|[Philip] Stanhope]], [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]], [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Rufus Isaacs]] and W. F. Thompson, the editor of ''[[Reynold's News]]''. The Committee wrote an open letter to the constituencies, asking them for their opinions on policy, designating several areas where opinion would be welcome. By November, the replies indicated that the weight of opinion lay with the democratisation of Parliament, involving the abolition of the Lords' veto, reform of registration and electoral law, and devolution. Amongst \"other prominent reforms\" were included all the major issues of the day (except nationalisation).

On [[Armistice Day]] 1924, over one hundred defeated Liberal candidates met at the club to express their anger at Lloyd George's failure to use his infamous \"[[Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925|Lloyd George fund]]\" to help the Liberals in [[1924 United Kingdom general election|the disastrous general election campaign one month earlier]].<ref>[[Frank Owen (politician)|Frank Owen]], ''Tempestuous Journey: Lloyd George, His Life and Times'' (Hutchinson, London, 1954), p. 684.</ref> After the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]], the first meeting of the newly expanded Parliamentary Liberal Party was held at the club, with all MPs except one (the independently minded [[Rhys Hopkin Morris]]) re-electing Lloyd George as Liberal Party Leader.<ref>J. Graham Jones, ''David Lloyd George and Welsh Liberalism'' (National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, 2010), p. 271.</ref>\n\nIn 1932, the club first introduced non-political membership (now called Ordinary Membership). [[Michael Meadowcroft]] explains that this was done to provide, \"membership for Liberals who, by reason of their employment, such as judges, military officers or senior civil servants, were not permitted to divulge their politics\", and so who had been previously debarred by the club's insistence on all members signing a declaration of Liberal politics.<ref name=\"autogenerated2012\"/> This continues to this day, with Ordinary Members signing a pledge that they will \"not use the club or...membership thereof for political activities adverse to Liberalism\", and not having full voting rights at Annual General Meetings, but otherwise enjoying the full benefits of club membership.<ref>National Liberal Club application form, 2011.</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nOn 11 May 1941 the club suffered a direct hit by a [[Luftwaffe]] bomb during [[the Blitz]], which utterly destroyed the central staircase and caused considerable damage elsewhere. The \u00a3150,000 cost of reconstructing the staircase in 1950 placed a considerable strain on the club's finances, although generous support from the [[War Damage Commission]] helped to fund the new staircase.<ref>Short cinema documentary, ''[[Look at Life (British cinema series)|Look at Life: Members Only]]'' (1965).</ref> In the nine-year interim between the bomb blast and the rebuilding of the staircase, members had to use the stairs of the club's turret tower, often taking highly circuitous routes around the vast clubhouse.\n\nOne of the items damaged in the blast was the 1915 portrait of [[Winston Churchill]] (a member of the club), by [[Ernest Townsend]]. Ironically, after 25 years of being hidden from sight, it had only just been put on display the year before. Painted in the year of the [[Dardanelles Campaign]], Churchill was soon unavailable for unveiling the portrait as he went into exile in the trenches. After his return, his strong support for the [[United Kingdom coalition government (1916\u20131922)|Lloyd George coalition]] meant that from 1916 he proved to be ''persona non-grata'' at the club, and this only increased after he left the Liberal Party in 1924. Thus from 1915 to 1940, the painting was held by the club in storage. When Churchill became Prime Minister in May 1940, the club rushed out the painting and put it on display in the main lobby (where it still hangs today). It was bombed after one year, suffering a diagonal gash down the middle. The painting was then painstakingly restored, and Churchill re-unveiled it himself on 22 July 1943, at a ceremony also attended by [[Clementine Churchill, Baroness Spencer-Churchill|his wife]] (a lifelong Liberal), Liberal Leader [[Sir Archibald Sinclair]] (a friend and colleague of over 30 years, then serving in Churchill's cabinet), lifelong friend [[Violet Bonham Carter|Lady Violet Bonham Carter]], Club chairman [[James Meston, 1st Baron Meston|Lord Meston]] and cartoonist [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]].<ref name=\"autogenerated133\"/>\n\n===Post-war era===\nThe fortunes of the NLC have mirrored those of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] \u2013 as the Liberals declined as a national force in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, so did the NLC. However, despite the Liberals' national decline, the NLC remained a focus for debate.\n\nIn the early 1950s, it was a centre of anti-ID card sentiment, and [[Harry Willcock]], a member who successfully campaigned for the abolition of ID cards, tore his up in front of the club as a publicity stunt in 1951. He also died in the club during a debate held there{{dub|ODNB has \"at a meeting of the Eighty Club at the Reform Club\"|date=June 2018}} on 12 December 1952, with his last word being \"Freedom.\"<ref>Plaque in the NLC smoking room.</ref>\n\nIt was at a debate at the club in 1971 that [[Yale]] professor [[James Tobin]] first publicly voiced his proposal for a ''[[Tobin tax]]'' on financial transactions.<ref>Shirreff, David.

Thorpe later credited this system with giving him more time to think of answers to questions, and it helped to keep the Liberal campaign both distinctive and modern.<ref>[[Jeremy Thorpe]], ''In My Own Time: Reminiscences of a Liberal Leader'' (Politico's, London, 1999), p. 107.</ref> Further Liberal election campaigns of the 1970s and 1980s would retain the idea of a daily press conference at the NLC, but with live participants rather than a TV link-up to the party leader.<ref>Ivor Crewe and Anthony King, ''SDP: The Birth, Life and Death of the Social Democratic Party'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1995), p. 200.</ref>\n\n[[File:The National Liberal Club interior (4843463497).jpg|thumb|left|The interior]]\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, all London clubs were in serious decline,<ref name=\"autogenerated1979\"/> and the NLC was no exception. By the 1970s the club was in a serious state of disrepair, its membership dwindling, and its finances losing almost a thousand pounds a week. In 1976 Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe handed over the club to Canadian businessman George Marks, styling himself [[George de Chabris]] (and, more improbably,  \"His Serene Holiness the Prince de Chabris\", which he claimed was \"a Catholic title\"), who, unknown to Thorpe, was a [[confidence trick]]ster. \"De Chabris\" claimed to be a multi-millionaire willing to funnel money into the club (although both his wealth and his willingness to finance the club turned out to be untrue), and he spent nine months running the club, relaxing membership rules and bringing in more income, but also moving his family in rent-free, running several fraudulent businesses from its premises, paying for a sports car and his children's private school fees from the club's accounts, and he eventually left in a hurry owing the club \u00a360,000, even emptying out the cash till of the day's takings as he went. He eventually agreed to pay back half of that sum in instalments. In his time at the club he also sold it a painting for \u00a310,000, when it was valued at less than \u00a31,000.<ref>Lewis Chester, [[Magnus Linklater]] and David May, ''Jeremy Thorpe: A Secret Life'' (Fontana, 1979), pp. 190\u2013194, for a detailed description of de Chabris' involvement in the club in the 1970s.

The pretext given was that the club could no longer afford to pay the Librarian's wages, and that it did not want to leave such valuable material unguarded.<ref>The Times, Wednesday, 10 November 1976; pg. 1; Issue 59857; col G; The Times, Friday, 19 November 1976; pg. 4; Issue 59865; col G.</ref> [[Ian Bradley]] described it as \"a derisory sum\" for the sale, particularly in light of the unique collection of accumulated candidates' manifestos from 19th-century general elections.<ref>The Times, Thursday, 21 October 1982; pg. 8; Issue 61368; col B.</ref> Until its sale, it had been, as Peter Harris observed, \"The most extensive of the Club libraries of London.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/> The collection is still housed at Bristol today. However, the papers referring to the history of the club itself were returned to the NLC in the 1990s, as they had not been included in the sale, and had been sent to Bristol by accident.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nAfter the 1977 dismissal of de Chabris, a 1978 rescue package by [[Lawrence Robson|Sir Lawrence Robson]] (a former Liberal Party President and parliamentary candidate, co-founder and partner of [[Robson Rhodes]], and husband of Liberal peer [[Inga-Stina Robson|Baroness Robson]]) did much to stabilise the club and secure its future \u2013 to this day the club honours Sir Lawrence with a portrait in the Smoking Room, and one of its function rooms has been renamed the Lawrence Robson Room.\n\nAs the Liberal Party's lease on its headquarters expired in 1977, the party organisation moved to the upper floors of the NLC, the negotiations being arranged by \"de Chabris\". The Liberals occupied a suite of rooms on the second floor, and a series of offices converted from bedrooms on the upper floors. The party continued to operate from the NLC until 1988, when it merged with the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] to form the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], and moved to occupy the SDP's old headquarters in Cowley Street. During this time, party workers were known to avail themselves of the club downstairs, and the NLC bar became known as the \"Liberal Party's 'local'\" and a Liberal Party song \"Down at the Old NLC\" was written in response to this:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nCome, come, roll up your trouser leg\nDown at the old NLC.\nCome, come, stuff your coat on the peg,\nDown at the old NLC.\nThere to get your apron on:\nLearn the secret organ song;\nBend your thumb when you shake hands.\nCome, come, drinking till the dinner gong,\nDown at the old NLC.</poem>|1985.

K. Chesterton]], [[Jerome K. Jerome]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Leonard Woolf]]; several of whom featured the club in some of their works of literature.\n\nAdditionally, the [[Authors' Club]], founded in 1891 in neighbouring [[Whitehall Court]], lodged with the National Liberal Club between 1966 and 1976, and has done so again since 2014.\n\n*[[G. K. Chesterton]], who was a member, mentions it as a setting in the short story \"The Notable Conduct of Professor Chadd\" in his collection ''[[The Club of Queer Trades]]'' (1905), with the narrator having a one-hour conversation on politics and God with a judge he meets on the club's balcony.<ref>[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1696/1696-h/1696-h.htm G.

Wells also gave a lengthy description of the NLC in his novel ''[[The New Machiavelli]]'' (1911), discussing the narrator's experience of visiting the club during the 1906 general election:\n\n[[File:H. G. Wells, c.1890.jpg|thumb|NLC member [[H. G. Wells]] painted a vivid, detailed portrait of the club at the time of the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|Liberal landslide of 1906]].]]\n{{cquote|I engaged myself to speak at one or two London meetings, and lunched at the [[Reform Club|Reform]], which was fairly tepid, and dined and spent one or two tumultuous evenings at the National Liberal Club, which was in active eruption. The National Liberal became feverishly congested towards midnight as the results of the counting came dropping in. A big green-baize screen had been fixed up at one end of the large smoking-room with the names of the constituencies that were voting that day, and directly the figures came to hand, up they went, amidst cheers that at last lost their energy through sheer repetition, whenever there was record of a Liberal gain. I don't remember what happened when there was a Liberal loss; I don't think that any were announced while I was there.\n\nHow packed and noisy the place was, and what a reek of tobacco and [[whisky]] [[vapor|fumes]] we made! Everybody was excited and talking, making waves of harsh confused sound that beat upon one's ears, and every now and then hoarse voices would shout for someone to speak. Our little set was much in evidence. Both the Cramptons were in, Lewis, Bunting Harblow. We gave brief addresses attuned to this excitement and the late hour, amidst much enthusiasm.\n\n\"Now we can DO things!\" I said amidst a rapture of applause. Men I did not know from Adam held up glasses and nodded to me in solemn fuddled approval as I came down past them into the crowd again.\n\nMen were betting whether the Unionists would lose more or less than two hundred seats.\n\n\"I wonder just what we shall do with it all\", I heard one sceptic speculating....}}\n:Wells later described the State Opening of the new 1906 parliament:\n\n{{cquote|It is one of my vivid memories from this period, the sudden outbreak of [[top hat|silk hats]] in the [[smoking room|smoking-room]] of the National Liberal Club. At first I thought there must have been a funeral. Familiar faces that one had grown to know under [[trilby|soft felt hats]], under [[bowler hat|bowlers]], under [[fedora (hat)|liberal-minded wide brims]], and above artistic [[necktie|ties]] and [[tweed jacket]]s, suddenly met one, staring with the stern gaze of self-consciousness, from under silk hats of incredible glossiness. There was a disposition to wear the hat much too forward, I thought, for a good Parliamentary style.}}\n:About the club more broadly, Wells' narrator reflected:\n\n{{cquote|My discontents with the Liberal party and my mental exploration of the quality of party generally is curiously mixed up with certain impressions of things and people in the National Liberal Club. The National Liberal Club is Liberalism made visible in the flesh\u2014and [[salt glaze pottery|Doultonware]]. It is an extraordinary big club done in a bold, wholesale, shiny, marbled style, richly furnished with numerous paintings, steel engravings, busts, and full-length statues of the late Mr. Gladstone; and its spacious dining-rooms, its long, hazy, crowded smoking-room with innumerable little tables and groups of men in armchairs, its magazine room and library upstairs, have just that undistinguished and unconcentrated diversity which is for me the Liberal note. The pensive member sits and hears perplexing dialects and even fragments of foreign speech, and among the clustering masses of less insistent whites his roving eye catches profiles and complexions that send his mind afield to [[Calcutta]] or [[Rangoon]] or the [[West Indies]] or [[Sierra Leone]] or [[Cape of Good Hope|the Cape]]....\n\nI was not infrequently that pensive member. I used to go to the Club to doubt about Liberalism. About two o'clock in the day the great smoking-room is crowded with countless little groups. They sit about small round tables, or in circles of chairs, and the haze of tobacco seems to prolong the great narrow place, with its pillars and bays, to infinity. Some of the groups are big, as many as a dozen men talk in loud tones; some are [[duologue]]s, and there is always a sprinkling of lonely, dissociated men. At first one gets an impression of men going from group to group and as it were linking them, but as one watches closely one finds that these men just visit three or four groups at the outside, and know nothing of the others. One begins to perceive more and more distinctly that one is dealing with a sort of human [[mosaic]]; that each patch in that great place is of a different quality and colour from the next and never to be mixed with it. Most clubs have a common link, a lowest common denominator in the Club Bore, who spares no one, but even the National Liberal bores are specialised and sectional. As one looks round one sees here a clump of men from the [[North of England|North Country]] or the [[Staffordshire Potteries|Potteries]], here an island of [[South London]] politicians, here a couple of young [[Jews]] ascendant from [[Whitechapel]], here a circle of journalists and writers, here a group of Irish politicians, here two [[East India]]ns, here a priest or so, here a clump of old-fashioned Protestants, here a little knot of eminent [[rationalism|Rationalists]] indulging in a [[blasphemous]] story '''sotto voce'''. Next to them are a group of [[anglicise]]d [[Germans]] and highly specialised [[chess (game)|chess-players]], and then two of the oddest-looking persons\u2014bulging with documents and intent upon extraordinary business transactions over long cigars ...\n\nI would listen to a stormy sea of babblement, and try to extract some constructive intimations. Every now and then I got a whiff of politics. It was clear they were against [[House of Lords|the Lords]]\u2014against [[plutocrats]]\u2014against [[press baron|Cossington's]] newspapers\u2014against the [[brewery|brewers]].... It was tremendously clear what they were against. The trouble was to find out what on earth they were for!...\n\nAs I sat and thought, the streaked and mottled pillars and wall, the various views, aspects, and portraits of [[William Ewart Gladstone|Mr. and]] [[Catherine Gladstone|Mrs. Gladstone]], the partitions of polished [[mahogany]], the yellow-[[waistcoat|vested]] waiters, would dissolve and vanish, and I would have a vision of this sample of miscellaneous men of limited, diverse interests and a universal littleness of imagination enlarged, unlimited, no longer a sample but a community, spreading, stretching out to infinity\u2014all in little groups and duologues and circles, all with their special and narrow concerns, all with their backs to most of the others.\n\nWhat but a common antagonism would ever keep these multitudes together? I understood why modern [[electioneering]] is more than half of it [[denunciation]]. Let us condemn, if possible, let us obstruct and deprive, but not let us do. There is no real appeal to the commonplace mind in \"Let us do.\" That calls for the creative imagination, and few have been accustomed to respond to that call. The other merely needs jealousy and bate, of which there are great and easily accessible reservoirs in every human heart.<ref>H. G.

The night porter will hunt out a pair of pyjamas and escort you up the lift. Oh, he's used to it. He gets politicians from [[Bradford]] and such places dropping in at all hours.

Members are in one of two categories: either Members, who sign a declaration that they shall not use the club's facilities or their membership for 'political activities adverse to Liberalism', or Political Members, who sign the same declaration, plus an additional declaration that they are a Liberal in their politics, in exchange for additional voting rights within the club. Non-political Membership was first introduced in 1932, to allow Liberals to join when they had been barred up until that point, as several occupations such as judges, army officers and senior civil servants specifically forbade political declarations.<ref>Michael Meadowcroft, \"Celebrating 130 Years of High Victorian Style and Elegance\", ''NLC News'', Issue 63, pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nIt is one of the few London clubs to contain another club within\u2014since 1990, the NLC has also been home to the [[Savage Club]], which lodges in some rooms on the ground floor.\n\nIn return for a collective subscription, members of the [[Mill Hill School|Old Millhillian's Club]] (OMC) have also been allowed to use the NLC clubhouse since 1968, when their own neighbouring [[Whitehall Court]] clubhouse closed down.\n\n===Ethnic minority members since the 1880s===\nIn keeping with its liberal roots, it was one of the first gentlemen's club to allow ethnic minorities as members (a handful of other clubs did so as well, including the [[East India Club]] whose members included Sir [[Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy]]). The first recorded ethnic minority member of the NLC, [[Dadabhai Naoroji]] was admitted in 1885, when the club was less than three years old, and spurred on by Club Secretary [[William Digby (writer)|William Digby]], by the late 1880s, the club had a large overseas membership, particularly concentrated in India and among Indian nationals resident in London.<ref>Mira Matikkala, \u2018Anti-Imperialism, Englishness, andEmpire in late-Victorian Britain\u2019 (Cambridge, PhD, 2006).</ref> Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the first Governor General of Pakistan, and a successful barrister, was a member of the National Liberal Club.\n\n[[File:Alan Beith MP Liverpool.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Long-standing Liberal and Lib Dem MP [[Alan Beith|Sir Alan Beith]] has been the club's President since 2008.]]\n\n===Women members since the 1960s===\nSince the club's 1882 foundation, women had always been allowed to use the club as visitors, but remained barred from membership until the 1960s, when it became one of the first \"gentlemen's clubs\" to admit women members.

The club's first full women members in 1976 were Christina Baron and Joyce Arram.\n\n===Dress code===\nWhen the club was originally launched in 1882, like every other London club of the era it had no prescriptive dress code. In 1888, a simple requirement was introduced that \"No member shall appear in any public rooms of the Club in a dressing gown, slippers, or other ''deshabille''.\" Beyond that, the club's only dress code was a request in the Regulations that members \"dress and conduct themselves in a manner consistent with civilised standards\", but precisely how members chose to observe that remained a matter of considerable personal interpretation.<ref name=\"meadowcroftdresscode2017\">Michael Meadowcroft, \"Breaking the Code\", ''NLC News'', Issue 72, April 2017, pp. 22-23.</ref> Indeed, the club's first official history, in 1925, noted that an unusual feature of the NLC was the way in which it enjoyed far more casual dress than other London clubs, with members turning up in their working clothes, and it singled out, \"the practical tabooing of evening dress, which assisted in securing the attendance of the House of Commons and Press Gallery men for at least part of the social evening.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1925\"/>  This absence of any prescriptive dress code remained the club's ''modus operandi'' from 1882 until 1979, when the Club's flurry of recent scandals led the General Committee to impose a strict jacket-and-tie dress code for men, emulating the jacket-and-tie dress codes introduced in other London clubs in the 1950s, which the NLC had previously held out against. No vote of the membership was held on the new dress code.<ref name=\"meadowcroftdresscode2017\"/>\n\nThis strict jacket-and-tie dress code remained in place for 40 years after the General Committee's 1979 decision, although a 2005 review led the club to permit men to remove their jackets on the club's terrace.<ref name=\"meadowcroftdresscode2017\"/>\n\nIn May 2018, the Club's Annual General Meeting voted by 49 to 36 in favour of a trial relaxation of the dress code in July and August of that year, removing the jacket-and-tie requirement from every part of the club except the Dining Room.<ref name=\"berridge2018\">Janet Berridge, \"National Liberal Club to trial relaxation of the dress code\", ''Lib Dem Voice'', 19 May 2018, https://www.libdemvoice.org/national-liberal-club-to-trial-relaxation-of-dress-code-57555.html</ref> It was the first time in 39 years that members had been permitted a formal vote on the dress code.

It was established by [[William Ewart Gladstone]] in 1882 to provide club facilities for [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] campaigners among the newly enlarged electorate following the [[Third Reform Act]] in 1884. The club's [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] building on the Embankment of the river [[Thames]] is the second-largest club-house ever built. Designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]], it was completed in 1887.<ref name=\"autogenerated1979\">Lejeune, Anthony, with Malcolm Lewis, ''The Gentlemen's Clubs of London'' (Bracken Books, 1979 reprinted 1984 and 1987) chapter on National Liberal Club.</ref> Its facilities include a dining room, a bar, function rooms, a billiards room, a [[smoking room]], a library and an outdoor riverside terrace. It is located at [[Whitehall Court|Whitehall Place]], close to the [[Houses of Parliament]], the [[Thames Embankment]] and [[Trafalgar Square]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nThe genesis of the club lay with Liberal party activist (and later MP) [[Arthur John Williams]], who proposed the creation of such a club at a Special General Meeting of the short-lived Century Club on 14 May 1882, so as to provide \"a home for democracy, void of the class distinction associated with the [[Devonshire Club|Devonshire]] and [[Reform Club]]s\". The first full meeting of the new club was held on 16 November 1882, at the Westminster Palace Hotel on Victoria Street. The Century Club itself then merged into the NLC at the end of the year.<ref>''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'', Volume 88, Smith, Elder and Co. (1903), pp. 314, 319, states that the Century Club merged into the NLC \"'''more than''' twenty years ago.\"</ref> In its early years, the club declared its objects to be: \n::1. The provision of an inexpensive meeting place for Liberals and their friends from all over the country.\n::2. The furtherance of the Liberal cause.\n::3. The foundation of a political and historical library as a memorial to Gladstone and his work.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\">Peter Harris, \"A Meeting Place for Liberals\", ''Journal of Liberal History'', No. 51, Summer 2006, pp. 18\u201323.</ref>\nAn initial circular for subscribers meant that by the end of 1882, 2,500 men from over 500 towns and districts had already signed up for the new club, and membership would reach 6,500 by the time the clubhouse opened in 1887.<ref name=\"autogenerated1925\">Robert Steven, ''The National Liberal Club: Politics and Persons'' (Robert Holden, London, 1925), 91pp.</ref>\n\n[[File:Elliott & Fry10a.jpg|thumb|left|Former Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] was the club's first President. A keen feller of trees in his spare time, his axe is still on display in the club smoking room today, along with a chest made from an oak tree cut down by Gladstone.]]\nThe club's foundation stone was laid by Gladstone on 9 November 1884, when he declared \"Speaking generally, I should say there could not be a less interesting occasion than the laying of the foundation-stone of a Club in London. For, after all, what are the Clubs of London? I am afraid little else than temples of luxury and ease. This, however, is a club of a very different character\", and envisioned the club as a popular institution for the mass electorate.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">G. W. E. Russell, ''Fifteen Chapters of Autobiography''(Thomas Nelson, London, undated), Chapter XXII.</ref> However, another of the club's founders, [[George W. E. Russell|G. W. E. Russell]], noted \"We certainly never foresaw the palatial pile of terra-cotta and glazed tiles which now bears that name. Our modest object was to provide a central meeting-place for Metropolitan and provincial Liberals, where all the comforts of life should be attainable at what are called 'popular prices'\", but added \"at the least, we meant our Club to be a place of \"ease\" to the Radical toiler. But Gladstone insisted that it was to be a workshop dedicated to strenuous labour.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> Funds for the clubhouse were raised by selling 40,000 shares of \u00a35 each, in a Limited Liability Company, with the unusual stipulation that \"No shareholder should have more than ''ten'' votes\", so as to prevent a few wealthy men from dominating the club.<ref name=\"autogenerated1925\"/> However, this only raised \u00a370,000,<ref name=\"autogenerated2012\"/> and so an additional \u00a352,400 was raised for the construction of the clubhouse by the Liberal Central Association.<ref>Roy Douglas, ''The History of the Liberal Party, 1895\u20131970'' (Sidgwick & Jackson, London, 1971), p. 17.</ref> The remaining \u00a330,000 necessary was raised by mortgage debentures.<ref name=\"autogenerated2012\"/>\n\nIn the five years between the club's establishment and completion of the building in 1887, it occupied temporary premises on the corner of [[Northumberland Avenue]] and Trafalgar Square. During this time, a [[parliamentary question]] was asked in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] about the [[White Ensign]] being raised on the club's flagpole as part of a prank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1883/may/04/the-national-liberal-club |title=THE NATIONAL LIBERAL CLUB.

NLC members flocked to the windows to watch [[George Bernard Shaw]] (a member of the club) address the demonstration, and later in the day, witnessed the bloodshed which ensued.<ref>[http://www1.webng.com/timesofshaw/articles/1925.html 'Portrait of George Bernard Shaw'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625025358/http://www1.webng.com/timesofshaw/articles/1925.html |date=25 June 2011 }}, ''The Times'', 1 November 1925.</ref>\n\nIn its late-19th-century heyday, its membership was primarily political, but had a strong journalistic and even bohemian character. Members were known to finish an evening's dining by diving into the Thames.<ref name=\"autogenerated1925\"/> Of the club's political character, George Bernard Shaw remarked at a debate in the club, \"I have never yet met a member of the National Liberal Club who did not intend to get into Parliament at some time, except those who, like our chairman [[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]], are there already.\"<ref>George Bernard Shaw, 'The Case for Equality: speech at a National Liberal Club debate of 1913', in ed. James Fuchs, ''The Socialism of Shaw'' (New York, 1926), p. 58.</ref>\n\nOn the club's launch, it represented all factions of liberalism, but within four years it was rocked by the [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Home Rule Crisis of 1886]], which saw the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] led by [[Joseph Chamberlain]] and the [[Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Marquess of Hartington]] (both of whom had been founder members of the NLC) secede from the party and eventually go into alliance with the Conservatives. Indeed, Chamberlain had been one of the NLC's most enthusiastic promoters upon its launch. At the 1884 ceremony of Gladstone's foundation-stone-laying for the club, Hartington had argued that the club would be the future home of Chamberlain's Radical [[Birmingham Caucus]], and Chamberlain pointedly refused to contradict him.<ref>Sir Alexander Mackintosh, ''Joseph Chamberlain: An Honest Biography'' (Hodder and Stoughton, London, 1914), p. 327.</ref> Chamberlain himself resigned in 1886, shortly after the Home Rule split, Hartington and other prominent Liberal Unionists followed early in 1887,<ref name=\"autogenerated1891\">Hamilton Fyfe and [[Joseph Irving]] (eds.), ''The Annals of Our Time ...: pt. 1. 20 June 1887 \u2013 December 1890'' (Macmillan, London, 1891).</ref> and when a further 130 Unionists simultaneously seceded from the club in 1889, the ''[[Scots Observer]]'' called it \"one of the most important events that has recently occurred in home politics\", due to its ramifications for the Liberal Party breaking in two.<ref>''The Scots Observer'', Vol. 1 (1889), p. 58.</ref>\n\nThe club enjoyed a reputation for radicalism, and H. V. Emy records that Radicals secured \n{{quote|a distinct success when the Radical wing of the National Liberal Club (NLC) captured the club's organisation in the summer of 1897 and elected a new political committee with [[Henry Labouch\u00e8re|[Henry] Labouchere]] as the chairman and [[Harold Reckitt|H. J. Reckitt]] as secretary. The Committee itself included [[Robert Reid, 1st Earl Loreburn|Sir Robert Reid]], [[Philip Stanhope, 1st Baron Weardale|[Philip] Stanhope]], [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]], [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Rufus Isaacs]] and W. F. Thompson, the editor of ''[[Reynold's News]]''. The Committee wrote an open letter to the constituencies, asking them for their opinions on policy, designating several areas where opinion would be welcome. By November, the replies indicated that the weight of opinion lay with the democratisation of Parliament, involving the abolition of the Lords' veto, reform of registration and electoral law, and devolution. Amongst \"other prominent reforms\" were included all the major issues of the day (except nationalisation).

On [[Armistice Day]] 1924, over one hundred defeated Liberal candidates met at the club to express their anger at Lloyd George's failure to use his infamous \"[[Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925|Lloyd George fund]]\" to help the Liberals in [[1924 United Kingdom general election|the disastrous general election campaign one month earlier]].<ref>[[Frank Owen (politician)|Frank Owen]], ''Tempestuous Journey: Lloyd George, His Life and Times'' (Hutchinson, London, 1954), p. 684.</ref> After the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]], the first meeting of the newly expanded Parliamentary Liberal Party was held at the club, with all MPs except one (the independently minded [[Rhys Hopkin Morris]]) re-electing Lloyd George as Liberal Party Leader.<ref>J. Graham Jones, ''David Lloyd George and Welsh Liberalism'' (National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, 2010), p. 271.</ref>\n\nIn 1932, the club first introduced non-political membership (now called Ordinary Membership). [[Michael Meadowcroft]] explains that this was done to provide, \"membership for Liberals who, by reason of their employment, such as judges, military officers or senior civil servants, were not permitted to divulge their politics\", and so who had been previously debarred by the club's insistence on all members signing a declaration of Liberal politics.<ref name=\"autogenerated2012\"/> This continues to this day, with Ordinary Members signing a pledge that they will \"not use the club or...membership thereof for political activities adverse to Liberalism\", and not having full voting rights at Annual General Meetings, but otherwise enjoying the full benefits of club membership.<ref>National Liberal Club application form, 2011.</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nOn 11 May 1941 the club suffered a direct hit by a [[Luftwaffe]] bomb during [[the Blitz]], which utterly destroyed the central staircase and caused considerable damage elsewhere. The \u00a3150,000 cost of reconstructing the staircase in 1950 placed a considerable strain on the club's finances, although generous support from the [[War Damage Commission]] helped to fund the new staircase.<ref>Short cinema documentary, ''[[Look at Life (British cinema series)|Look at Life: Members Only]]'' (1965).</ref> In the nine-year interim between the bomb blast and the rebuilding of the staircase, members had to use the stairs of the club's turret tower, often taking highly circuitous routes around the vast clubhouse.\n\nOne of the items damaged in the blast was the 1915 portrait of [[Winston Churchill]] (a member of the club), by [[Ernest Townsend]]. Ironically, after 25 years of being hidden from sight, it had only just been put on display the year before. Painted in the year of the [[Dardanelles Campaign]], Churchill was soon unavailable for unveiling the portrait as he went into exile in the trenches. After his return, his strong support for the [[United Kingdom coalition government (1916\u20131922)|Lloyd George coalition]] meant that from 1916 he proved to be ''persona non-grata'' at the club, and this only increased after he left the Liberal Party in 1924. Thus from 1915 to 1940, the painting was held by the club in storage. When Churchill became Prime Minister in May 1940, the club rushed out the painting and put it on display in the main lobby (where it still hangs today). It was bombed after one year, suffering a diagonal gash down the middle. The painting was then painstakingly restored, and Churchill re-unveiled it himself on 22 July 1943, at a ceremony also attended by [[Clementine Churchill, Baroness Spencer-Churchill|his wife]] (a lifelong Liberal), Liberal Leader [[Sir Archibald Sinclair]] (a friend and colleague of over 30 years, then serving in Churchill's cabinet), lifelong friend [[Violet Bonham Carter|Lady Violet Bonham Carter]], Club chairman [[James Meston, 1st Baron Meston|Lord Meston]] and cartoonist [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]].<ref name=\"autogenerated133\"/>\n\n===Post-war era===\nThe fortunes of the NLC have mirrored those of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] \u2013 as the Liberals declined as a national force in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, so did the NLC. However, despite the Liberals' national decline, the NLC remained a focus for debate.\n\nIn the early 1950s, it was a centre of anti-ID card sentiment, and [[Harry Willcock]], a member who successfully campaigned for the abolition of ID cards, tore his up in front of the club as a publicity stunt in 1951. He also died in the club during a debate held there{{dub|ODNB has \"at a meeting of the Eighty Club at the Reform Club\"|date=June 2018}} on 12 December 1952, with his last word being \"Freedom.\"<ref>Plaque in the NLC smoking room.</ref>\n\nIt was at a debate at the club in 1971 that [[Yale]] professor [[James Tobin]] first publicly voiced his proposal for a ''[[Tobin tax]]'' on financial transactions.<ref>Shirreff, David.

Thorpe later credited this system with giving him more time to think of answers to questions, and it helped to keep the Liberal campaign both distinctive and modern.<ref>[[Jeremy Thorpe]], ''In My Own Time: Reminiscences of a Liberal Leader'' (Politico's, London, 1999), p. 107.</ref> Further Liberal election campaigns of the 1970s and 1980s would retain the idea of a daily press conference at the NLC, but with live participants rather than a TV link-up to the party leader.<ref>Ivor Crewe and Anthony King, ''SDP: The Birth, Life and Death of the Social Democratic Party'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1995), p. 200.</ref>\n\n[[File:The National Liberal Club interior (4843463497).jpg|thumb|left|The interior]]\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, all London clubs were in serious decline,<ref name=\"autogenerated1979\"/> and the NLC was no exception. By the 1970s the club was in a serious state of disrepair, its membership dwindling, and its finances losing almost a thousand pounds a week. In 1976 Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe handed over the club to Canadian businessman George Marks, styling himself [[George de Chabris]] (and, more improbably,  \"His Serene Holiness the Prince de Chabris\", which he claimed was \"a Catholic title\"), who, unknown to Thorpe, was a [[confidence trick]]ster. \"De Chabris\" claimed to be a multi-millionaire willing to funnel money into the club (although both his wealth and his willingness to finance the club turned out to be untrue), and he spent nine months running the club, relaxing membership rules and bringing in more income, but also moving his family in rent-free, running several fraudulent businesses from its premises, paying for a sports car and his children's private school fees from the club's accounts, and he eventually left in a hurry owing the club \u00a360,000, even emptying out the cash till of the day's takings as he went. He eventually agreed to pay back half of that sum in instalments. In his time at the club he also sold it a painting for \u00a310,000, when it was valued at less than \u00a31,000.<ref>Lewis Chester, [[Magnus Linklater]] and David May, ''Jeremy Thorpe: A Secret Life'' (Fontana, 1979), pp. 190\u2013194, for a detailed description of de Chabris' involvement in the club in the 1970s.

The pretext given was that the club could no longer afford to pay the Librarian's wages, and that it did not want to leave such valuable material unguarded.<ref>The Times, Wednesday, 10 November 1976; pg. 1; Issue 59857; col G; The Times, Friday, 19 November 1976; pg. 4; Issue 59865; col G.</ref> [[Ian Bradley]] described it as \"a derisory sum\" for the sale, particularly in light of the unique collection of accumulated candidates' manifestos from 19th-century general elections.<ref>The Times, Thursday, 21 October 1982; pg. 8; Issue 61368; col B.</ref> Until its sale, it had been, as Peter Harris observed, \"The most extensive of the Club libraries of London.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/> The collection is still housed at Bristol today. However, the papers referring to the history of the club itself were returned to the NLC in the 1990s, as they had not been included in the sale, and had been sent to Bristol by accident.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nAfter the 1977 dismissal of de Chabris, a 1978 rescue package by [[Lawrence Robson|Sir Lawrence Robson]] (a former Liberal Party President and parliamentary candidate, co-founder and partner of [[Robson Rhodes]], and husband of Liberal peer [[Inga-Stina Robson|Baroness Robson]]) did much to stabilise the club and secure its future \u2013 to this day the club honours Sir Lawrence with a portrait in the Smoking Room, and one of its function rooms has been renamed the Lawrence Robson Room.\n\nAs the Liberal Party's lease on its headquarters expired in 1977, the party organisation moved to the upper floors of the NLC, the negotiations being arranged by \"de Chabris\". The Liberals occupied a suite of rooms on the second floor, and a series of offices converted from bedrooms on the upper floors. The party continued to operate from the NLC until 1988, when it merged with the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] to form the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], and moved to occupy the SDP's old headquarters in Cowley Street. During this time, party workers were known to avail themselves of the club downstairs, and the NLC bar became known as the \"Liberal Party's 'local'\" and a Liberal Party song \"Down at the Old NLC\" was written in response to this:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nCome, come, roll up your trouser leg\nDown at the old NLC.\nCome, come, stuff your coat on the peg,\nDown at the old NLC.\nThere to get your apron on:\nLearn the secret organ song;\nBend your thumb when you shake hands.\nCome, come, drinking till the dinner gong,\nDown at the old NLC.</poem>|1985.

K. Chesterton]], [[Jerome K. Jerome]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Leonard Woolf]]; several of whom featured the club in some of their works of literature.\n\nAdditionally, the [[Authors' Club]], founded in 1891 in neighbouring [[Whitehall Court]], lodged with the National Liberal Club between 1966 and 1976, and has done so again since 2014.\n\n*[[G. K. Chesterton]], who was a member, mentions it as a setting in the short story \"The Notable Conduct of Professor Chadd\" in his collection ''[[The Club of Queer Trades]]'' (1905), with the narrator having a one-hour conversation on politics and God with a judge he meets on the club's balcony.<ref>[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1696/1696-h/1696-h.htm G.

Wells also gave a lengthy description of the NLC in his novel ''[[The New Machiavelli]]'' (1911), discussing the narrator's experience of visiting the club during the 1906 general election:\n\n[[File:H. G. Wells, c.1890.jpg|thumb|NLC member [[H. G. Wells]] painted a vivid, detailed portrait of the club at the time of the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|Liberal landslide of 1906]].]]\n{{cquote|I engaged myself to speak at one or two London meetings, and lunched at the [[Reform Club|Reform]], which was fairly tepid, and dined and spent one or two tumultuous evenings at the National Liberal Club, which was in active eruption. The National Liberal became feverishly congested towards midnight as the results of the counting came dropping in. A big green-baize screen had been fixed up at one end of the large smoking-room with the names of the constituencies that were voting that day, and directly the figures came to hand, up they went, amidst cheers that at last lost their energy through sheer repetition, whenever there was record of a Liberal gain. I don't remember what happened when there was a Liberal loss; I don't think that any were announced while I was there.\n\nHow packed and noisy the place was, and what a reek of tobacco and [[whisky]] [[vapor|fumes]] we made! Everybody was excited and talking, making waves of harsh confused sound that beat upon one's ears, and every now and then hoarse voices would shout for someone to speak. Our little set was much in evidence. Both the Cramptons were in, Lewis, Bunting Harblow. We gave brief addresses attuned to this excitement and the late hour, amidst much enthusiasm.\n\n\"Now we can DO things!\" I said amidst a rapture of applause. Men I did not know from Adam held up glasses and nodded to me in solemn fuddled approval as I came down past them into the crowd again.\n\nMen were betting whether the Unionists would lose more or less than two hundred seats.\n\n\"I wonder just what we shall do with it all\", I heard one sceptic speculating....}}\n:Wells later described the State Opening of the new 1906 parliament:\n\n{{cquote|It is one of my vivid memories from this period, the sudden outbreak of [[top hat|silk hats]] in the [[smoking room|smoking-room]] of the National Liberal Club. At first I thought there must have been a funeral. Familiar faces that one had grown to know under [[trilby|soft felt hats]], under [[bowler hat|bowlers]], under [[fedora (hat)|liberal-minded wide brims]], and above artistic [[necktie|ties]] and [[tweed jacket]]s, suddenly met one, staring with the stern gaze of self-consciousness, from under silk hats of incredible glossiness. There was a disposition to wear the hat much too forward, I thought, for a good Parliamentary style.}}\n:About the club more broadly, Wells' narrator reflected:\n\n{{cquote|My discontents with the Liberal party and my mental exploration of the quality of party generally is curiously mixed up with certain impressions of things and people in the National Liberal Club. The National Liberal Club is Liberalism made visible in the flesh\u2014and [[salt glaze pottery|Doultonware]]. It is an extraordinary big club done in a bold, wholesale, shiny, marbled style, richly furnished with numerous paintings, steel engravings, busts, and full-length statues of the late Mr. Gladstone; and its spacious dining-rooms, its long, hazy, crowded smoking-room with innumerable little tables and groups of men in armchairs, its magazine room and library upstairs, have just that undistinguished and unconcentrated diversity which is for me the Liberal note. The pensive member sits and hears perplexing dialects and even fragments of foreign speech, and among the clustering masses of less insistent whites his roving eye catches profiles and complexions that send his mind afield to [[Calcutta]] or [[Rangoon]] or the [[West Indies]] or [[Sierra Leone]] or [[Cape of Good Hope|the Cape]]....\n\nI was not infrequently that pensive member. I used to go to the Club to doubt about Liberalism. About two o'clock in the day the great smoking-room is crowded with countless little groups. They sit about small round tables, or in circles of chairs, and the haze of tobacco seems to prolong the great narrow place, with its pillars and bays, to infinity. Some of the groups are big, as many as a dozen men talk in loud tones; some are [[duologue]]s, and there is always a sprinkling of lonely, dissociated men. At first one gets an impression of men going from group to group and as it were linking them, but as one watches closely one finds that these men just visit three or four groups at the outside, and know nothing of the others. One begins to perceive more and more distinctly that one is dealing with a sort of human [[mosaic]]; that each patch in that great place is of a different quality and colour from the next and never to be mixed with it. Most clubs have a common link, a lowest common denominator in the Club Bore, who spares no one, but even the National Liberal bores are specialised and sectional. As one looks round one sees here a clump of men from the [[North of England|North Country]] or the [[Staffordshire Potteries|Potteries]], here an island of [[South London]] politicians, here a couple of young [[Jews]] ascendant from [[Whitechapel]], here a circle of journalists and writers, here a group of Irish politicians, here two [[East India]]ns, here a priest or so, here a clump of old-fashioned Protestants, here a little knot of eminent [[rationalism|Rationalists]] indulging in a [[blasphemous]] story '''sotto voce'''. Next to them are a group of [[anglicise]]d [[Germans]] and highly specialised [[chess (game)|chess-players]], and then two of the oddest-looking persons\u2014bulging with documents and intent upon extraordinary business transactions over long cigars ...\n\nI would listen to a stormy sea of babblement, and try to extract some constructive intimations. Every now and then I got a whiff of politics. It was clear they were against [[House of Lords|the Lords]]\u2014against [[plutocrats]]\u2014against [[press baron|Cossington's]] newspapers\u2014against the [[brewery|brewers]].... It was tremendously clear what they were against. The trouble was to find out what on earth they were for!...\n\nAs I sat and thought, the streaked and mottled pillars and wall, the various views, aspects, and portraits of [[William Ewart Gladstone|Mr. and]] [[Catherine Gladstone|Mrs. Gladstone]], the partitions of polished [[mahogany]], the yellow-[[waistcoat|vested]] waiters, would dissolve and vanish, and I would have a vision of this sample of miscellaneous men of limited, diverse interests and a universal littleness of imagination enlarged, unlimited, no longer a sample but a community, spreading, stretching out to infinity\u2014all in little groups and duologues and circles, all with their special and narrow concerns, all with their backs to most of the others.\n\nWhat but a common antagonism would ever keep these multitudes together? I understood why modern [[electioneering]] is more than half of it [[denunciation]]. Let us condemn, if possible, let us obstruct and deprive, but not let us do. There is no real appeal to the commonplace mind in \"Let us do.\" That calls for the creative imagination, and few have been accustomed to respond to that call. The other merely needs jealousy and bate, of which there are great and easily accessible reservoirs in every human heart.<ref>H. G.

The night porter will hunt out a pair of pyjamas and escort you up the lift. Oh, he's used to it. He gets politicians from [[Bradford]] and such places dropping in at all hours.

Members are in one of two categories: either Members, who sign a declaration that they shall not use the club's facilities or their membership for 'political activities adverse to Liberalism', or Political Members, who sign the same declaration, plus an additional declaration that they are a Liberal in their politics, in exchange for additional voting rights within the club. Non-political Membership was first introduced in 1932, to allow Liberals to join when they had been barred up until that point, as several occupations such as judges, army officers and senior civil servants specifically forbade political declarations.<ref>Michael Meadowcroft, \"Celebrating 130 Years of High Victorian Style and Elegance\", ''NLC News'', Issue 63, pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nIt is one of the few London clubs to contain another club within\u2014since 1990, the NLC has also been home to the [[Savage Club]], which lodges in some rooms on the ground floor.\n\nIn return for a collective subscription, members of the [[Mill Hill School|Old Millhillian's Club]] (OMC) have also been allowed to use the NLC clubhouse since 1968, when their own neighbouring [[Whitehall Court]] clubhouse closed down.\n\n===Ethnic minority members since the 1880s===\nIn keeping with its liberal roots, it was one of the first gentlemen's club to allow ethnic minorities as members (a handful of other clubs did so as well, including the [[East India Club]] whose members included Sir [[Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy]]). The first recorded ethnic minority member of the NLC, [[Dadabhai Naoroji]] was admitted in 1885, when the club was less than three years old, and spurred on by Club Secretary [[William Digby (writer)|William Digby]], by the late 1880s, the club had a large overseas membership, particularly concentrated in India and among Indian nationals resident in London.<ref>Mira Matikkala, \u2018Anti-Imperialism, Englishness, andEmpire in late-Victorian Britain\u2019 (Cambridge, PhD, 2006).</ref> Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the first Governor General of Pakistan, and a successful barrister, was a member of the National Liberal Club.\n\n[[File:Alan Beith MP Liverpool.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Long-standing Liberal and Lib Dem MP [[Alan Beith|Sir Alan Beith]] has been the club's President since 2008.]]\n\n===Women members since the 1960s===\nSince the club's 1882 foundation, women had always been allowed to use the club as visitors, but remained barred from membership until the 1960s, when it became one of the first \"gentlemen's clubs\" to admit women members.

The club's first full women members in 1976 were Christina Baron and Joyce Arram.\n\n===Dress code===\nWhen the club was originally launched in 1882, like every other London club of the era it had no prescriptive dress code. In 1888, a simple requirement was introduced that \"No member shall appear in any public rooms of the Club in a dressing gown, slippers, or other ''deshabille''.\" Beyond that, the club's only dress code was a request in the Regulations that members \"dress and conduct themselves in a manner consistent with civilised standards\", but precisely how members chose to observe that remained a matter of considerable personal interpretation.<ref name=\"meadowcroftdresscode2017\">Michael Meadowcroft, \"Breaking the Code\", ''NLC News'', Issue 72, April 2017, pp. 22-23.</ref> Indeed, the club's first official history, in 1925, noted that an unusual feature of the NLC was the way in which it enjoyed far more casual dress than other London clubs, with members turning up in their working clothes, and it singled out, \"the practical tabooing of evening dress, which assisted in securing the attendance of the House of Commons and Press Gallery men for at least part of the social evening.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1925\"/>  This absence of any prescriptive dress code remained the club's ''modus operandi'' from 1882 until 1979, when the Club's flurry of recent scandals led the General Committee to impose a strict jacket-and-tie dress code for men, emulating the jacket-and-tie dress codes introduced in other London clubs in the 1950s, which the NLC had previously held out against. No vote of the membership was held on the new dress code.<ref name=\"meadowcroftdresscode2017\"/>\n\nThis strict jacket-and-tie dress code remained in place for 40 years after the General Committee's 1979 decision, although a 2005 review led the club to permit men to remove their jackets on the club's terrace.<ref name=\"meadowcroftdresscode2017\"/>\n\nIn May 2018, the Club's Annual General Meeting voted by 49 to 36 in favour of a trial relaxation of the dress code in July and August of that year, removing the jacket-and-tie requirement from every part of the club except the Dining Room.<ref name=\"berridge2018\">Janet Berridge, \"National Liberal Club to trial relaxation of the dress code\", ''Lib Dem Voice'', 19 May 2018, https://www.libdemvoice.org/national-liberal-club-to-trial-relaxation-of-dress-code-57555.html</ref> It was the first time in 39 years that members had been permitted a formal vote on the dress code.

{"title_page": "Music of Croatia", "text_new": "{{Culture of Croatia}}\n\n'''The music of [[Croatia]]''', like the divisions of the country itself, has two major influences: [[Central Europe]]an, present in central and northern parts of the country including [[Slavonia]], and [[Mediterranean]], present in coastal regions of [[Dalmatia]] and [[Istria]].\n\nIn Croatia both [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]] are popular, as well as pop music influenced by [[Dalmatia]]n or [[Slavonia]]n folk elements.\n\nSince the mid-20th century, [[schlager]] and [[chanson]]-inspired music have formed the backbone of the [[Croatian popular music]].\n\n==History of music in Croatia==\n===Medieval===\nThe oldest preserved relics of musical culture in Croatia are sacral in nature and represented by ''Latin medieval liturgical chant manuscripts'' (approximately one hundred musical codices and fragments dating from the 11th to the 15th centuries have been preserved to date). They reveal a wealth of various influences and liturgical traditions that converged in this region ([[Dalmatia]]n liturgy in ''Benevento script'', Northern [[Gregorian chant]], and original ''Glagolitic chant'').\n\n===Renaissance and baroque===\n[[File:Kip P.Hektorovic starigrad hvar.jpg|left|thumb|180px|[[Petar Hektorovi\u0107]] (1487\u20131572)]]\nEarly in the 15th century, the ideas of [[Humanism]] in Croatia brought about changes to the world of music. Interest in music began to spread outside of monastic and church walls with growing influence of new spiritual tendencies from Central European and particularly Italian cities. Humanists and philosophers promulgated new musical theories and aesthetic ideas: Federik Grisogono, [[Pavao Skali\u0107]], [[Frane Petri\u0107]]. The writing down of folk and popular music began in mid-sixteenth century: in the poem ''[[Fishing and Fishermen's Talk]]'' from 1558, [[Petar Hektorovi\u0107]] ingrained [[Neoplatonic]] ideals in popular music; and transcripts of Croatian musical folklore were printed in Venetian anthologies (''Giulio Cesare Barbetta'' 1569, [[Marco Facoli]] 1588). ''Julije Skjaveti\u0107'' from [[\u0160ibenik]] published his [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s (''Li madrigali a quattro, et a cinque voci'' 1562), while his ''Motetti a cinque et a sei voci'', (1564) are characterised by a lavish polyphonic structure under the influence of the [[Dutch School (painting)|Dutch school]]. Music and dance were a component part of theatrical expression ([[Mavro Vetranovi\u0107]], ''Nikola Nalje\u0161kovi\u0107'', [[Marin Dr\u017ei\u0107]], ''Marin Benetovi\u0107''), while the function of music and sound effects was under the influence of ''Italian pastorals''.\n\nThe most prominent Croatian composers of this period include [[Ivan Luka\u010di\u0107]], [[Vinko Jeli\u0107]] and [[Atanazije Jurjevi\u0107]].\n\nNew tendencies of early [[Baroque]] monody soon found their way into the domestic musical tradition, both sacral and secular. ''Tomaso Cecchini'', from [[Verona]], who spent his entire working life (1603\u201344) as a choirmaster, organist and composer in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] and [[Hvar]], published his madrigals ''Armonici concetti, libro primo'' (1612) as the oldest Baroque collection written for the Croatian milieu. The collection ''Sacrae cantiones'' ([[Venice]] 1620) by [[Ivan Luka\u010di\u0107]] from \u0160ibenik is valuable testimony of sacral music that was performed in Split, and is generally speaking, one of the most significant monuments of old Croatian music altogether. The [[Franciscans]] and [[Paulists]] cultivated sacral chants, mostly monophonic and without [[organ (music)|organ]] accompaniment (the manuscript cantos of Frane Divni\u0107, Bone Razmilovi\u0107, Filip Vlahovi\u0107-Kapu\u0161varac, Franjo Vukovarac and Petar Kne\u017eevi\u0107). Also, worth mentioning is Ragusino [[Vincenzo Comnen]], the only representative of the music of the Dubrovnik nobility.\n\nThe tradition of the [[Baroque]] was more lasting in church/sacral music, which was the musical form that was systematically nurtured in numerous monasteries (especially Franciscan ones) as well as in parish and cathedral churches. The preservation of music manuscripts and prints became a widespread practice in the mid-18th century. Simple vocal-instrumental music for two voices with organ continuo was the form most frequently performed in churches; more prominent individuals active in the sphere of music could be found only in larger urban centres. They were mostly [[organist]]s and ''maestri di cappella'', skilful composers who had small vocal and/or instrumental ensembles and who frequently acted as music teachers (private or in church schools). The gradual development of the middle class had as one of its consequences the corresponding secular organisation of musical life, particularly in the first decades of the 19th century, a period that saw the establishment of music ensembles, music societies (1827 in [[Zagreb]], then in [[Vara\u017edin]], [[Rijeka]], [[Osijek]] etc.) and music schools.\n\nIn addition, public balls and other events were organised (music academies, theatre performances) with the participation of local and foreign musicians (from [[Italy]], [[Austria]], [[Bohemia]] etc.) including the private collection of music materials for playing music at home. Music became a component part of various festivities, such as the arrival of important political personalities (the new governor or the Habsburg king Frances I, etc.), the feasts of patron saints (''St. Blaise'' in [[Dubrovnik]], ''St. Domnius'' in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], ''St. Stephen'' in [[Hvar]] and [[Zagreb]] etc.), for which so called art music was specifically composed, with the inclusion of popular elements (bourgeois dances, folk music of the peasantry).\n\n===Romanticism===\nMany Italian and domestic musicians worked in Dubrovnik: in the cathedral choir and orchestra, in the Duke's orchestra, at private and public festivities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmd-music.hr |title=The editions of the Croatian musicological society |publisher=Hmd-music.hr |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref> An excellent early example of pre-classical symphony and chamber music was given by [[Luka Sorko\u010devi\u0107]], a nobleman educated in Rome, as well as his son Antun, a historian and diplomat.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:HNK.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''Croatian National Theatre'']] -->\n[[Ferdo Livadi\u0107]] (1799\u20131879) wrote ''Notturno in F-sharp minor'' for piano as early as 1822, which is, along with [[John Field (composer)|John Field]]'s compositions under the same name, one of the earliest examples of that type of piano miniatures in general.<ref name=\"culturenet\"/>\n\nIn the course of the 1830s, as a reflection of such tendencies in Europe, the [[Illyrian Movement]] emerged in Croatia which assigned not only to literature but to music as well a particular socio-political role: the forming and guarding of national awareness including the struggle against [[Hungarization]] and [[Germanization]]. Accordingly, in 1846 [[Josip Runjanin]] (1821\u20131878) put to music [[Antun Mihanovi\u0107]]'s 1835 poem \"Horvatska domovina\" (Croatian Homeland), which later became the [[Lijepa na\u0161a domovino|Croatian national anthem]].<ref name=\"culturenet\">{{cite web | url=http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?id=23191 | title=19. stolje\u0107e | last=Majer-Bobetko | first=Sanja | work=culturenet.hr | publisher=Culturenet Croatia | language=Croatian | accessdate=2010-03-27}}</ref> In such a setting [[Vatroslav Lisinski]] (1819\u20131954) composed the first Croatian national opera ''Ljubav i zloba'' (Love and Malice), which premi\u00e8red in [[Zagreb]] in 1846.<ref name=\"culturenet\"/>\n\nTaking into consideration the presence of folk music, the aspirations of the Illyrians went far beyond the results achieved, something that is also continued in the work of [[Ivan Zajc]] (1832\u20131914) in the second half of the century. His masterpiece, the opera [[Nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinjski]], ever since its opening night in Zagreb in 1876, had not lost in popularity, partly because its heroic patriotism functions as a symbol of Croatia's victory. Finally, owing to the founder of Croatian ethno-musicology and musical historiography, [[Franjo Kuha\u010d]] (1834\u20131911), the systematic research of folklore evolved simultaneously with Zajc's endeavours. Finally it should be added that in Zajc's and Kuha\u010d's era, major halls for musical performances and concerts were built: in Zagreb the building of the ''Croatian Music Institute'' (1876, 1895) with a concert hall, and the building of the [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb|Croatian National Theatre]] (1895), including the theatre buildings in [[Rijeka]] (1885), [[Split, Croatia|Split]] (1893) and [[Osijek]] (1907) where, along with the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb, drama, opera and ballet performances are still played today.\n\nDuring the 19th century, other instrumentalists and singers won international recognition, for example, the violinist [[Franjo Kre\u017ema]] (1862\u20131881), singers, among which Ilma Murska (1834\u20131889), Matilda Mallinger (1847\u20131920) who sang at the opening night of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg]]'' in 1868, [[Milka Trnina]] (1863\u20131941) and [[Josip Ka\u0161man]] (1850\u20131925), the first Croatian singer to appear at the [[New York Metropolitan Opera]].<ref name=\"culturenet\"/>\n\n==Folk music==\n[[File:Traditional Croatian Musicians.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Traditional Croatian musicians play for Mrs. [[Laura Bush]] on April 7, 2008 in [[Zagreb]].]]\nThe traditional [[folk music]] of [[Croatia]] is mostly associated with the following:\n\n===Ganga===\nGanga is a type of singing which is characterized by a lone singer singing one line of lyrics and then others joining in for what can be best described as a wail. It is a very passionate form of singing, which is one of the reasons it has been limited in popularity to small towns. Even though it is a unique and autochthonous form of singing by Croats, it is very rare to hear this music on Croatian airwaves. However, several popular Croatian musicians have incorporated some ganga into their work. It can also be heard in concert music: the American composer [[Craig Walsh]] incorporates a ganga-inspired wailing, sighing, pitch-bending, micro-tonal vocal style in his 'String Quartet No. 1' (2010), a work commissioned for the [[Sarajevo Chamber Music Festival]] and the [[Manhattan String Quartet]], the second movement of which is clearly paying homage to [[Ganga (music)|ganga]] style.\n\nOnly recently has ganga begun to address political issues, frequently adopting overtly nationalistic overtones and incorporating themes from the Croatian Homeland War. Although both men and women regularly perform ganga, it is extremely unusual for them to perform songs together. It is not unusual at all for both Catholic and Muslim men to perform ganga together.\n\n===Klapa===\n[[File:Klapa Sagena koncert Kri\u017e nek ti sa\u010duva ime Vatroslav Lisinski 7 rujna 2008.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A Klapa group at a concert in Zagreb]]\nThe [[klapa]] music is a form of [[a cappella]] singing that first appeared in littoral Croatia during the middle of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naklapskinacin.hr/english-version.html|title=naklapskinacin.com - English version|first=Na klapski|last=nacin|date=|website=www.naklapskinacin.hr|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> The word ''klapa'' is derived from a word in slang Italian spoken in Trieste at the time. It refers to \"a group of people\" and the singing style traces its roots to liturgical church singing. The motifs, in general, celebrate love, wine (grapes), country (homeland) and sea. The main elements of the music are harmony and melody, with rhythm very rarely being very important.\n\nA klapa group consists of a first [[tenor]], a second tenor, a [[baritone]], and a [[basso|bass]]. It is possible to double all the voices apart from the first [[tenor]].  Although [[klapa]] is a cappella music, on occasion, it is possible to add a gentle [[guitar]] and a [[mandolin]].\n\nKlapa singing has become increasingly popular in littoral Croatia.  Many young people from [[Dalmatia]] treasure [[klapa]] and sing it regularly when going out eating/drinking. This music has gained popularity among mainstream audiences in coastal regions of Croatia, with newer klapas formed by younger generations fusing klapa vocals with other music styles, such as klapa Libar's metal cover of \"Pusti da ti leut svira\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKrihW-XVs|title=Klapa Libar - Pusti Da Ti Leut Svira (metal izdanje)|first=|last=bots2|date=19 December 2009|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> and the pop/klapa song \"Kako \u0107u joj re\u0107' da varin\" by klapa DVD-a \u017drnovnica Sv.

It became increasingly popular in the 1800s, and small bands began to form, paralleling similar developments in [[Russia]], [[Italy]] and the [[Ukraine]].\n\nThe main themes of tamburitza songs are the common themes of love and happy village life. Tamburitza music is primarily associated with the northern, [[Pannonian plain|Pannonian]] part of the country. It is sometimes said that the first sextet of tambura players was formed by [[Pajo Kolari\u0107]] of [[Osijek]] in 1847. In 1971 one of the most famous and long lasting tamburitza ensembles [[Slavonski Be\u0107ari]] was formed led by the legend of tamburitza music [[Antun Nikoli\u0107 Tuca]].\n\nTraditional tamburitza ensembles are still commonplace, but more professional groups have formed in the last few decades. These include [[Zlatni dukati]] and [[Ex Panonia]], the first such groups, [[Zdenac]], Slavonske Lole, [[Berde Band]] and the modernized [[rock and roll]]-influenced [[Gazde]].\n\nThe style of Tambura music played most often in the United States during the latter half of the 20th Century was not significantly different from the style played at the turn of the 19th Century.  Free of the influences of pop music in Jugoslavia and the nascent, independent republics, and without large quantities of immigrants bringing new methods and styles, American-style Tambura music, and to a lesser extent, Canadian-style Tambura music stayed true to its roots.\n\nToday, the most prevalent forms of Tambura music are folk-pop combinations.\n\n{{See also|Be\u0107arac}}\n\n===Gusle===\n[[File:Gusle Dalmacija MG\u0160 360109.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A traditional gusle instrument from [[Dalmatia]] ]]\nThe [[gusle]] music is played on this traditional string instrument. It is primarily rooted in [[epic poetry]] with emphasis on important historical or patriotic events.  It is the traditional instrument of inland [[Dalmatia]] and of [[Herzegovina]], the part of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] with predominant Croatian population.\n\nGusle players are known for glorifying outlaws such as [[hajduk]]s or [[uskok]]s of the long gone [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish reign]] or exalting the recent heroes of the [[History of Croatia#Modern Croatia|Croatian War of Independence]]. [[Andrija Kacic Miosic|Andrija Ka\u010di\u0107 Mio\u0161i\u0107]], a famous 18th-century author, had also composed verses in form of the traditional folk poetry (''[[deseterac]]'', ten verses). His book ''Razgovor ugodni naroda slovinskog'' became Croatian folk Bible which inspired numerous gusle players ever since.\n\nAs for contemporary gusle players in Croatia, one person that particularly stands out is [[Mile Krajina]]. Krajina is a prolific folk poet and gusle player who gained cult status among some [[conservatism|conservative]] groups. There are also several other prominent Croatian gusle players who often perform at various folk-festivals throughout Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\n===Diple===\n\nDiple is a traditional woodwind musical instrument in Croatian music. Sometimes called \"Mih\", \"mjeh\", \"mjesina\" or only \"diple\", it is played from Istria, Lika, over Dalmatia Islands and Coast to Herzegovina. \"Mih\" is made of tanned goat or sheep skin and consists of a \"dulac\" or \"kanela\" through which the air is blown and \"diple\" (chanter) on which it is played. Inside the \"mih\" on the chanter, two single-blade reeds are situated. Unlike bagpipes, \"Mih\" doesn't have a \"trubanj\" or \"bordun\" (drone). Although they are very similar, the \"mih\" from different parts of Croatia still differ in type of chanter, in the position of holes or in some tiny details (for example ornaments).\n\n===Other folk traditions===\n[[File:Harmonika Mozirje EMZ 300109.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An accordion on display in Zagreb.]]\nThe folk music of [[Zagorje]], an area north of [[Zagreb]], is known for small orchestras consisting of [[Violin]]s, [[Cimbalom|Cimbule]], [[Tamburitza|Tamburice]] and [[Accordion|Harmonike]]. The Tamburica (also known as tambura) is the Croatian national string instrument. Although there is a rich pool of folk songs in this region, traditions are not being cherished and most Zagorian folk music available is performed by amateur groups. This is also reflected in the quality of the music, which is mostly reduced to happy upbeat songs.\n[[File:Sopile.JPG|thumb|right|120px|Several [[sopila]] instruments.]]\nThe folk music of [[Medjimurje|Me\u0111imurje]], a small but distinct region in northernmost Croatia, with its melancholic and soothing tunes became the most popular form of folk to be used in the modern ''ethno'' pop-rock songs. Beside [[Cimbalom|Cimbule]] and [[Violin]]s, there is also a tradition of [[Brass]] orchestras which used to play an important role in cultural everyday life. On one hand, they were the foundation of every regional celebration or wedding but on the other hand they were also known for playing at funerals or funeral feasts.\n\nIn [[Istria]] and [[Kvarner]], native instruments like [[sopila]], [[curla]] and [[diple]] make a distinctive regional sound.  It is partially diatonic in nature following the unique [[Istrian scale]].\n\n===Events===\n\nThe [[Slavonia]]n town [[Po\u017eega, Croatia|Po\u017eega]] hosts a known folk [[music festival]], [[Zlatne \u017eice Slavonije]] (''Golden strings of Slavonia''), which has prompted musicians to compose new songs with far-reaching influences, recently including American [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]].\n\nThe towns of [[Vinkovci]] and [[\u0110akovo]], also in Slavonia, host yearly folklore festivals (''Vinkova\u010dke jeseni'' and ''\u0110akova\u010dki vezovi'') where folk music is also listened to as part of the tradition.\n\nThe town of Slavonski Brod holds an annual festival called Brodfest, where many of the great tamburica bands come together to play.\n\nThe Dubrovnik Summer Festival puts on dramatic music and ballet. It was founded in 1950.\n\nThe Osor Musical Evenings was founded in 1976 and takes place in July and August. It plays classical Croatian masters.\n\nThe Musical Evenings in Donat takes place during the summer in Zadar. It was founded in 1961, and plays old music.\n\n==Popular music==\n{{Main|Croatian popular music}}\n\n===Pop===\nThe [[pop music]] of Croatia generally resembles the ''canzone'' [[music of Italy]], while including elements of the native traditional music. Croatian record companies produce a lot of material each year, if only to populate the numerous [[music festivals]]. Of special note is the [[Split Festival]] which usually produces the most popular [[summer hit]]s.\n\nSeasoned pop singers in Croatia include: [[Meri Cetini\u0107]], [[Mi\u0161o Kova\u010d]], [[Ivo Robi\u0107]], [[Vice Vukov]], [[Milan Ba\u010di\u0107]], [[Arsen Dedi\u0107]], [[Vinko Coce]], [[Zdenka Vu\u010dkovi\u0107]], [[Darko Domjan]], [[Tereza Kesovija]], [[Gabi Novak]], [[Ivica \u0160erfezi]], [[Oliver Dragojevi\u0107]], [[Tomislav Iv\u010di\u0107]], [[Doris Dragovi\u0107]], [[Radojka \u0160verko]], [[Maja Blagdan]], and many others. Also, the groups [[Magazin]] and Grupa 777 have had sustained careers.\n\nIn more recent times, younger performers such as [[Nina Badri\u0107]], [[Severina Vu\u010dkovi\u0107|Severina]], [[Zlatan Stipi\u0161i\u0107 Gibonni|Gibonni]], [[Marko Perkovi\u0107 Thompson]], [[Toni Cetinski]], [[Jelena Rozga]], [[Danijela Martinovi\u0107|Danijela]], [[Lidija Ba\u010di\u0107]], [[Antonija \u0160ola]], [[Lana Jur\u010devi\u0107]] and many others have captured the attention of the pop audience. Each of them have successfully blended various influences into their distinct music style. For example, Thompson's songs include traditional epic themes from the [[Dinaric Alps|Dinaric regions]]; Severina threads between Croatian pop and a folk sound.\n\nCroatian pop music is fairly often listened to in [[Slovenia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[North Macedonia]] due to the union of Yugoslavia that existed until the 1990s. Conversely, Bosnian singers like [[Dino Merlin]] and Serbian [[\u0110or\u0111e Bala\u0161evi\u0107]] have an audience in Croatia, as well as some others. More recently the [[Turbo folk]]&nbsp;\u2013 frowned upon by the establishment some music critics and social commentators&nbsp;\u2013 has been popular amongst some sections of Croatian youth. A general resentment to Turbo folk remains as it is not broadcast on state radio and TV. Where on private outlets it may be transmitted, it normally triggers a strong negative reaction from those not liking it. Croatian singers that are using elements of Turbo folk are [[Severina Vu\u010dkovi\u0107|Severina]] and [[Jelena Rozga]].\n\nCroatia is a regular contestant on the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. Back in Yugoslavia, Croatian pop group [[Riva (music group)|Riva]] won the contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1989|1989]]. Some of the other Croatians who performed on the ESC include [[Daniel (Montenegrin singer)|Danijel Popovi\u0107]], [[Put (band)|Put]], [[Boris Novkovi\u0107]] and [[Claudia Beni]].\n\n===Rock===\nThe most popular rock bands active during the former Yugoslavia included [[Haustor]], [[Psihomodo Pop]], [[Azra]], [[Prljavo Kazali\u0161te]] and [[Parni Valjak]].\n\nThere are several rather popular and long-lasting mainstream rock acts like [[Parni Valjak]], [[Prljavo Kazali\u0161te]], [[Crvena Jabuka]], [[Atomsko Skloni\u0161te]], [[Aerodrom (band)|Aerodrom]], Tutti Frutti Band, Daleka Obala, \u0110avoli, Stijene, More, Osmi putnik, Metak, etc. They originated in the 1970s and 1980s, and for the better part of their career resorted to a more mellow, mainstream pop-rock sound. Of some note is also the [[Sarajevo school of pop rock]] which influenced many of these bands, and which also included singers like [[\u017deljko Bebek]] who later worked in Croatia.\n\nHowever, [[New wave music in Yugoslavia|Croatian new wave]] (''Novi val'') movement, which exploded in 1979/80 and lasted throughout the 1980s, is considered by many to be the high-water mark of Croatian rock music, both in terms of quality and commercial success. The most influential and popular bands of ''Novi val'' were [[Azra]], [[Haustor]], [[Film]], even early [[Prljavo Kazali\u0161te]]. Other notable acts were [[Animatori]], [[Buldo\u017eer]], [[Paraf]], [[Patrola]] etc.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the region of [[Istria]] became home to a kind of called [[\u010ca-val]], which often used the [[\u010cakavian dialect]] and elements of traditional music from the regions of Istria and [[Kvarner]].\n\nThe new wave scene has collapsed by the end of the eighties, to be replaced by the newcomers like; Tutti Frutti band, [[Daleka Obala]], [[Majke]] and [[Laufer (band)|Laufer]]. While Daleka Obala sported a pop-rock sound influenced by Novi val, Croatian pop and even Dalmatian folk, Majke were a back-to-basics, garage-rock act stylistically influenced by bands like the [[Black Crowes]], [[Led Zeppelin]] or [[Black Sabbath]], as well as their Serbian counterparts [[Partibrejkers]]. Laufer, led by [[Damir Urban]] (who later went on to form [[Damir Urban|Urban &amp; 4]]), were an early nineties alternative rock band taking their cue from the grunge movement.\n\n[[Let 3]] and [[KUD Idijoti]] are also prominent rock acts, popular both for their music and their interesting, often controversial, performances and stunts.\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, folk-rock groups also sprouted across Croatia.  The first is said to be [[Vjestice|Vje\u0161tice]], who combined [[Medjimurje|Me\u0111imurje]] folk music with rock and set the stage for artists like [[Legen]], [[Lidija Bajuk]] and [[Dunja Knebl]]. At the same time on the other side of Croatia, in Istria, a band called [[Gustafi]] started playing their own strange amalgamate of rock and Istrian folk, but it took them more than a decade to reach the nationwide audience.\n\nThe Split [[heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Osmi Putnik]] has also been a success in Croatia and still are today and are also popular in other ex-Yugoslav republics\n\nThe Sisak [[surf rock]] band [[The Bambi Molesters]] has in the past years gained sizeable international fame and are often touted as one of the best surf-rock acts in the world today.\n\nAlternative rock/metal band [[Father (band)|Father]] have had success with their first album [[inspirita]] in countries like the [[UK]], and have toured with bands like [[Korn]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] and [[Apocalyptica]].\n\nThere is also a number of Croatian bands who play modern music in English, most prominent being [[My Buddy Moose]], [[The orange strips]], [[In-the-go]], [[Kimiko]], [[Cold Snap (band)|Cold Snap]] and [[Snovi]]\n\n===Dance===\n\n[[Dance music]] in Croatia was an offspring of the local pop music and more Western influences. It developed during the late 1980s and early 1990s, picking up on the trends such as [[euro disco]] and [[eurodance]]. It also spawned a wave of [[electronic music]] artists, mostly [[house music|house]], [[techno music|techno]] and [[trance music|trance]].\n\n[[Dino Dvornik]] is one of the pioneers of [[electronic music]] in Croatian.\n\nThe singer [[Vanna (singer)|Vanna]] rose to prominence through the dance trio ''E.T.'', and the music of [[Vesna Pisarovi\u0107]] has a fair bit of dance beat.\n\nAlthough E.T. still operates, they've changed singers several times and lost in popularity. The band [[Colonia (music group)|Colonia]] is perhaps the only one that rode the dance wave of the '90s and today is one of the most popular performers in Croatia.\n\n===Rap===\n\nThe 1990s were marked by the emergence of Croatian [[rap music]].  The Ugly Leaders released the first ever Croatian Hip-Hop album, and gained a strong following in and around Rijeka.  In 1991, the Croatian Liberation Front released two widely popular protest singles.   The first rap band to gain widespread and lasting acclaim was [[The Beat Fleet]] (TBF) from [[Split, Croatia|Split]], whose members took inspiration from harsh economic and social conditions of war-torn [[Dalmatia]], not that different from American inner cities. Their act was followed by a multitude of artists and groups in [[Zagreb]], taking inspiration from American [[gangsta rap]]. The Zagreb rappers [[Bolesna Bra\u0107a]] (also called ''Sick Rhyme Sayazz'') and [[Tram 11]] became particularly popular, and to an extent also the duo [[Nered]] & [[Stoka]].\n\nThe Croatian rap gained much from the fact [[Edo Maajka]], a [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] rapper, signed on to a label in Zagreb. Recently a rapper known as [[Shorty (rapper)|Shorty]] gained a lot of popularity by having songs with strong regional flavour of his native [[Vinkovci]]. The Zagreb band [[Elemental (music group)|Elemental]] also burst into the scene featuring one of the few Croatian female rappers.\n\n===Other===\n\nThe tendency to combine different elements also has a long presence in more [[european classical music|classical music]]: the opera [[Ero s onoga svijeta]], written by [[Jakov Gotovac]] in the 1930s, blended the traditional music of the [[Dinaric Alps|Dinaric]] peoples into a scholarly form and achieved great success.\n\n==Classical==\n\nClassical musicians and compositions by Croatian composers are generally not well known worldwide despite having produced a huge and interesting contribution over many centuries. Influences of style were often taken from neighbouring influences ([[Italy]], [[Austria]]) or settlers (in the Mediterranean Croatia from Italy, and in Panonia (north Croatia) from Germany and [[Bohemia]]).\n\nCroatian composers by current relevance in a global framework: (Maybe the order will change in the future, given that 95% of the composition exists as a single copy \u2013 the original manuscript, and yet need to be saved from oblivion, and then be performed and recorded on CD, and then presented to the international public)\n\n* [[Vatroslav Lisinski]] (born as Ignaz Fuchs) considered as the founder of the Croatian nationalist music composed the first Croatian national opera ''Ljubav i Zloba'' (''Love and Malice'') and national opera ''Porin''. Was a composer of great potential, but lived in a wrong time in a wrong place, and was a victim of politically-based intrigues.\n* [[Ivan Zajc]] (born as Giovanni von Zaytz) composed a series of operas in Italian, German and Croatian language. The music bears the features of authentic Italian melodics, since he grew up in a Croatian-Italian town Fiume (present-day Rijeka). His instrumental compositions \u2013 and there are a lot of them \u2013 are unknown to the public, and yet need to be explored by musicologists and than published.\n* [[Josip Hatze]] is the author of the first Croatian mass (ca. 1895) and the first Croatian cantata (''Night on Una'', 1902).\n* [[Dora Peja\u010devi\u0107]] (born as Theodora Pejacsevich) \u2013 one of the composers to introduce the orchestral song to Croatian music. Her Symphony in F-sharp minor is considered by scholars to be the first modern symphony in Croatian Music. \n* [[Blagoje Bersa]] (born as Benito Bersa) is a typical figure of late Romantic stylistic crisis, the author of 'futurustic' opera Der Eisenhammer / Oganj (Zagreb, 1911).\n* [[Fran Lhotka]] (alternative spelling: Franz Lhotka) \u2013 ballet The Devil in the Village; Violin Concerto; \n* [[Rudolf Matz]] (alternative spelling: Rudolph Matz) \u2013 School for the Violoncello; Concerto for Flute and Strings; Concertino in Modo Antico for Violoncello and Strings; \n* [[Bo\u017eidar Kunc]] \u2013 Piano Concerto; piano sonatas; songs for voice and piano; \n* [[Franjo Dugan]] \u2013 works for organ; Violin Sonata; \n* dr. [[Bo\u017eidar \u0160irola]] \u2013 wrote numerous high-quality compositions, some of which were performed just once and then fell into oblivion, probably because of political reasons. The majority \u2013 if not all of them \u2013 were never given a modern-day performance \n* [[Boris Papandopulo]]\n* [[Stjepan \u0160ulek]] - the symphonies; Sonata for Trombone and Piano 'Vox Gabrieli'; \n* [[Josip \u0160tolcer Slavenski]] Sonata for Violin and Piano; Slavonic Dances for Piano; \n* [[Drago Kocakov]] - composed the only Croatian sonata for a classy ensemble made up of two violins - the violin duo \n* [[Julije Bajamonti]]  \n* [[Julije Skjaveti\u0107]] \n* [[Ivan Luka\u010di\u0107]]  \n* [[Luka Sorko\u010devi\u0107]]\n\nModern composers: \n* [[Ivo Josipovi\u0107]] \n* [[Milko Kelemen]] \n* [[Pavle De\u0161palj|Pavel De\u0161palj]] \n* [[Ivo Malec]] \n* [[Stanko Horvat]] \n* [[Marko Ru\u017edjak]] \n* [[Dubravko Detoni]] \n* [[Igor Kuljeri\u0107]]\n* [[Darko Hajsek]]\n\nCroatian society of composers ([http://www.hds.hr Hrvatsko drustvo skladatelja - HDS]) is the main organization promoting modern classical music in Croatia.\n\n==Jazz==\n\nJazz appeared in Croatia in the 1920s, and flourished in Zagreb by the late 2000s, making it a regional center for jazz. In 1947, the jazz orchestra of Radio Zagreb was founded, which lives on today as the \"[[Croatian Radiotelevision|HRT]] Big Band.\" In 1959, [[vibraphone]] player [[Bo\u0161ko Petrovi\u0107]], who was likely the most famous Croatian jazz musician, founded the ''Zagreb Jazz Quartet''. Today, there is a fair number of active jazz groups in Croatia, and various cities host jazz festivals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?id=23411|title=Culturenet.hr - Jazz|author=|date=|website=culturenet.hr|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> Jazz has left its mark on the Croatian pop scene throughout the years, most notably in the works of Drago Dikli\u0107 and occasionally Josipa Lisac.\n\n== Christian music ==\nCroatian Catholic priests of [[Dalmatia]], [[Istria]] and [[Kotor]] sang in [[Church Slavonic language]] during the 9th and 10th centuries, from which formed different forms of individual or choral spiritual music.

They reveal a wealth of various influences and liturgical traditions that converged in this region ([[Dalmatia]]n liturgy in ''Benevento script'', Northern [[Gregorian chant]], and original ''Glagolitic chant'').\n\n===Renaissance and baroque===\n[[File:Kip P.Hektorovic starigrad hvar.jpg|left|thumb|180px|[[Petar Hektorovi\u0107]] (1487\u20131572)]]\nEarly in the 15th century, the ideas of [[Humanism]] in Croatia brought about changes to the world of music. Interest in music began to spread outside of monastic and church walls with growing influence of new spiritual tendencies from Central European and particularly Italian cities. Humanists and philosophers promulgated new musical theories and aesthetic ideas: Federik Grisogono, [[Pavao Skali\u0107]], [[Frane Petri\u0107]]. The writing down of folk and popular music began in mid-sixteenth century: in the poem ''[[Fishing and Fishermen's Talk]]'' from 1558, [[Petar Hektorovi\u0107]] ingrained [[Neoplatonic]] ideals in popular music; and transcripts of Croatian musical folklore were printed in Venetian anthologies (''Giulio Cesare Barbetta'' 1569, [[Marco Facoli]] 1588). ''Julije Skjaveti\u0107'' from [[\u0160ibenik]] published his [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s (''Li madrigali a quattro, et a cinque voci'' 1562), while his ''Motetti a cinque et a sei voci'', (1564) are characterised by a lavish polyphonic structure under the influence of the [[Dutch School (painting)|Dutch school]]. Music and dance were a component part of theatrical expression ([[Mavro Vetranovi\u0107]], ''Nikola Nalje\u0161kovi\u0107'', [[Marin Dr\u017ei\u0107]], ''Marin Benetovi\u0107''), while the function of music and sound effects was under the influence of ''Italian pastorals''.\n\nThe most prominent Croatian composers of this period include [[Ivan Luka\u010di\u0107]], [[Vinko Jeli\u0107]] and [[Atanazije Jurjevi\u0107]].\n\nNew tendencies of early [[Baroque]] monody soon found their way into the domestic musical tradition, both sacral and secular. ''Tomaso Cecchini'', from [[Verona]], who spent his entire working life (1603\u201344) as a choirmaster, organist and composer in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] and [[Hvar]], published his madrigals ''Armonici concetti, libro primo'' (1612) as the oldest Baroque collection written for the Croatian milieu. The collection ''Sacrae cantiones'' ([[Venice]] 1620) by [[Ivan Luka\u010di\u0107]] from \u0160ibenik is valuable testimony of sacral music that was performed in Split, and is generally speaking, one of the most significant monuments of old Croatian music altogether. The [[Franciscans]] and [[Paulists]] cultivated sacral chants, mostly monophonic and without [[organ (music)|organ]] accompaniment (the manuscript cantos of Frane Divni\u0107, Bone Razmilovi\u0107, Filip Vlahovi\u0107-Kapu\u0161varac, Franjo Vukovarac and Petar Kne\u017eevi\u0107). Also, worth mentioning is Ragusino [[Vincenzo Comnen]], the only representative of the music of the Dubrovnik nobility.\n\nThe tradition of the [[Baroque]] was more lasting in church/sacral music, which was the musical form that was systematically nurtured in numerous monasteries (especially Franciscan ones) as well as in parish and cathedral churches. The preservation of music manuscripts and prints became a widespread practice in the mid-18th century. Simple vocal-instrumental music for two voices with organ continuo was the form most frequently performed in churches; more prominent individuals active in the sphere of music could be found only in larger urban centres. They were mostly [[organist]]s and ''maestri di cappella'', skilful composers who had small vocal and/or instrumental ensembles and who frequently acted as music teachers (private or in church schools). The gradual development of the middle class had as one of its consequences the corresponding secular organisation of musical life, particularly in the first decades of the 19th century, a period that saw the establishment of music ensembles, music societies (1827 in [[Zagreb]], then in [[Vara\u017edin]], [[Rijeka]], [[Osijek]] etc.) and music schools.\n\nIn addition, public balls and other events were organised (music academies, theatre performances) with the participation of local and foreign musicians (from [[Italy]], [[Austria]], [[Bohemia]] etc.) including the private collection of music materials for playing music at home. Music became a component part of various festivities, such as the arrival of important political personalities (the new governor or the Habsburg king Frances I, etc.), the feasts of patron saints (''St. Blaise'' in [[Dubrovnik]], ''St. Domnius'' in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], ''St. Stephen'' in [[Hvar]] and [[Zagreb]] etc.), for which so called art music was specifically composed, with the inclusion of popular elements (bourgeois dances, folk music of the peasantry).\n\n===Romanticism===\nMany Italian and domestic musicians worked in Dubrovnik: in the cathedral choir and orchestra, in the Duke's orchestra, at private and public festivities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmd-music.hr |title=The editions of the Croatian musicological society |publisher=Hmd-music.hr |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref> An excellent early example of pre-classical symphony and chamber music was given by [[Luka Sorko\u010devi\u0107]], a nobleman educated in Rome, as well as his son Antun, a historian and diplomat.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:HNK.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''Croatian National Theatre'']] -->\n[[Ferdo Livadi\u0107]] (1799\u20131879) wrote ''Notturno in F-sharp minor'' for piano as early as 1822, which is, along with [[John Field (composer)|John Field]]'s compositions under the same name, one of the earliest examples of that type of piano miniatures in general.<ref name=\"culturenet\"/>\n\nIn the course of the 1830s, as a reflection of such tendencies in Europe, the [[Illyrian Movement]] emerged in Croatia which assigned not only to literature but to music as well a particular socio-political role: the forming and guarding of national awareness including the struggle against [[Hungarization]] and [[Germanization]]. Accordingly, in 1846 [[Josip Runjanin]] (1821\u20131878) put to music [[Antun Mihanovi\u0107]]'s 1835 poem \"Horvatska domovina\" (Croatian Homeland), which later became the [[Lijepa na\u0161a domovino|Croatian national anthem]].<ref name=\"culturenet\">{{cite web | url=http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?id=23191 | title=19. stolje\u0107e | last=Majer-Bobetko | first=Sanja | work=culturenet.hr | publisher=Culturenet Croatia | language=Croatian | accessdate=2010-03-27}}</ref> In such a setting [[Vatroslav Lisinski]] (1819\u20131954) composed the first Croatian national opera ''Ljubav i zloba'' (Love and Malice), which premi\u00e8red in [[Zagreb]] in 1846.<ref name=\"culturenet\"/>\n\nTaking into consideration the presence of folk music, the aspirations of the Illyrians went far beyond the results achieved, something that is also continued in the work of [[Ivan Zajc]] (1832\u20131914) in the second half of the century. His masterpiece, the opera [[Nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinjski]], ever since its opening night in Zagreb in 1876, had not lost in popularity, partly because its heroic patriotism functions as a symbol of Croatia's victory. Finally, owing to the founder of Croatian ethno-musicology and musical historiography, [[Franjo Kuha\u010d]] (1834\u20131911), the systematic research of folklore evolved simultaneously with Zajc's endeavours. Finally it should be added that in Zajc's and Kuha\u010d's era, major halls for musical performances and concerts were built: in Zagreb the building of the ''Croatian Music Institute'' (1876, 1895) with a concert hall, and the building of the [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb|Croatian National Theatre]] (1895), including the theatre buildings in [[Rijeka]] (1885), [[Split, Croatia|Split]] (1893) and [[Osijek]] (1907) where, along with the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb, drama, opera and ballet performances are still played today.\n\nDuring the 19th century, other instrumentalists and singers won international recognition, for example, the violinist [[Franjo Kre\u017ema]] (1862\u20131881), singers, among which Ilma Murska (1834\u20131889), Matilda Mallinger (1847\u20131920) who sang at the opening night of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg]]'' in 1868, [[Milka Trnina]] (1863\u20131941) and [[Josip Ka\u0161man]] (1850\u20131925), the first Croatian singer to appear at the [[New York Metropolitan Opera]].<ref name=\"culturenet\"/>\n\n==Folk music==\n[[File:Traditional Croatian Musicians.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Traditional Croatian musicians play for Mrs. [[Laura Bush]] on April 7, 2008 in [[Zagreb]].]]\nThe traditional [[folk music]] of [[Croatia]] is mostly associated with the following:\n\n===Ganga===\nGanga is a type of singing which is characterized by a lone singer singing one line of lyrics and then others joining in for what can be best described as a wail. It is a very passionate form of singing, which is one of the reasons it has been limited in popularity to small towns. Even though it is a unique and autochthonous form of singing by Croats, it is very rare to hear this music on Croatian airwaves. However, several popular Croatian musicians have incorporated some ganga into their work. It can also be heard in concert music: the American composer [[Craig Walsh]] incorporates a ganga-inspired wailing, sighing, pitch-bending, micro-tonal vocal style in his 'String Quartet No. 1' (2010), a work commissioned for the [[Sarajevo Chamber Music Festival]] and the [[Manhattan String Quartet]], the second movement of which is clearly paying homage to [[Ganga (music)|ganga]] style.\n\nOnly recently has ganga begun to address political issues, frequently adopting overtly nationalistic overtones and incorporating themes from the Croatian Homeland War. Although both men and women regularly perform ganga, it is extremely unusual for them to perform songs together. It is not unusual at all for both Catholic and Muslim men to perform ganga together.\n\n===Klapa===\n[[File:Klapa Sagena koncert Kri\u017e nek ti sa\u010duva ime Vatroslav Lisinski 7 rujna 2008.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A Klapa group at a concert in Zagreb]]\nThe [[klapa]] music is a form of [[a cappella]] singing that first appeared in littoral Croatia during the middle of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naklapskinacin.hr/english-version.html|title=naklapskinacin.com - English version|first=Na klapski|last=nacin|date=|website=www.naklapskinacin.hr|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> The word ''klapa'' is derived from a word in slang Italian spoken in Trieste at the time. It refers to \"a group of people\" and the singing style traces its roots to liturgical church singing. The motifs, in general, celebrate love, wine (grapes), country (homeland) and sea. The main elements of the music are harmony and melody, with rhythm very rarely being very important.\n\nA klapa group consists of a first [[tenor]], a second tenor, a [[baritone]], and a [[basso|bass]]. It is possible to double all the voices apart from the first [[tenor]].  Although [[klapa]] is a cappella music, on occasion, it is possible to add a gentle [[guitar]] and a [[mandolin]].\n\nKlapa singing has become increasingly popular in littoral Croatia.  Many young people from [[Dalmatia]] treasure [[klapa]] and sing it regularly when going out eating/drinking. This music has gained popularity among mainstream audiences in coastal regions of Croatia, with newer klapas formed by younger generations fusing klapa vocals with other music styles, such as klapa Libar's metal cover of \"Pusti da ti leut svira\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbKrihW-XVs|title=Klapa Libar - Pusti Da Ti Leut Svira (metal izdanje)|first=|last=bots2|date=19 December 2009|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> and the pop/klapa song \"Kako \u0107u joj re\u0107' da varin\" by klapa DVD-a \u017drnovnica Sv.

It became increasingly popular in the 1800s, and small bands began to form, paralleling similar developments in [[Russia]], [[Italy]] and the [[Ukraine]].\n\nThe main themes of tamburitza songs are the common themes of love and happy village life. Tamburitza music is primarily associated with the northern, [[Pannonian plain|Pannonian]] part of the country. It is sometimes said that the first sextet of tambura players was formed by [[Pajo Kolari\u0107]] of [[Osijek]] in 1847. In 1971 one of the most famous and long lasting tamburitza ensembles [[Slavonski Be\u0107ari]] was formed led by the legend of tamburitza music [[Antun Nikoli\u0107 Tuca]].\n\nTraditional tamburitza ensembles are still commonplace, but more professional groups have formed in the last few decades. These include [[Zlatni dukati]] and [[Ex Panonia]], the first such groups, [[Zdenac]], Slavonske Lole, [[Berde Band]] and the modernized [[rock and roll]]-influenced [[Gazde]].\n\nThe style of Tambura music played most often in the United States during the latter half of the 20th Century was not significantly different from the style played at the turn of the 19th Century.  Free of the influences of pop music in Jugoslavia and the nascent, independent republics, and without large quantities of immigrants bringing new methods and styles, American-style Tambura music, and to a lesser extent, Canadian-style Tambura music stayed true to its roots.\n\nToday, the most prevalent forms of Tambura music are folk-pop combinations.\n\n{{See also|Be\u0107arac}}\n\n===Gusle===\n[[File:Gusle Dalmacija MG\u0160 360109.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A traditional gusle instrument from [[Dalmatia]] ]]\nThe [[gusle]] music is played on this traditional string instrument. It is primarily rooted in [[epic poetry]] with emphasis on important historical or patriotic events.  It is the traditional instrument of inland [[Dalmatia]] and of [[Herzegovina]], the part of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] with predominant Croatian population.\n\nGusle players are known for glorifying outlaws such as [[hajduk]]s or [[uskok]]s of the long gone [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish reign]] or exalting the recent heroes of the [[History of Croatia#Modern Croatia|Croatian War of Independence]]. [[Andrija Kacic Miosic|Andrija Ka\u010di\u0107 Mio\u0161i\u0107]], a famous 18th-century author, had also composed verses in form of the traditional folk poetry (''[[deseterac]]'', ten verses). His book ''Razgovor ugodni naroda slovinskog'' became Croatian folk Bible which inspired numerous gusle players ever since.\n\nAs for contemporary gusle players in Croatia, one person that particularly stands out is [[Mile Krajina]]. Krajina is a prolific folk poet and gusle player who gained cult status among some [[conservatism|conservative]] groups. There are also several other prominent Croatian gusle players who often perform at various folk-festivals throughout Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\n===Diple===\n\nDiple is a traditional woodwind musical instrument in Croatian music. Sometimes called \"Mih\", \"mjeh\", \"mjesina\" or only \"diple\", it is played from Istria, Lika, over Dalmatia Islands and Coast to Herzegovina. \"Mih\" is made of tanned goat or sheep skin and consists of a \"dulac\" or \"kanela\" through which the air is blown and \"diple\" (chanter) on which it is played. Inside the \"mih\" on the chanter, two single-blade reeds are situated. Unlike bagpipes, \"Mih\" doesn't have a \"trubanj\" or \"bordun\" (drone). Although they are very similar, the \"mih\" from different parts of Croatia still differ in type of chanter, in the position of holes or in some tiny details (for example ornaments).\n\n===Other folk traditions===\n[[File:Harmonika Mozirje EMZ 300109.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An accordion on display in Zagreb.]]\nThe folk music of [[Zagorje]], an area north of [[Zagreb]], is known for small orchestras consisting of [[Violin]]s, [[Cimbalom|Cimbule]], [[Tamburitza|Tamburice]] and [[Accordion|Harmonike]]. The Tamburica (also known as tambura) is the Croatian national string instrument. Although there is a rich pool of folk songs in this region, traditions are not being cherished and most Zagorian folk music available is performed by amateur groups. This is also reflected in the quality of the music, which is mostly reduced to happy upbeat songs.\n[[File:Sopile.JPG|thumb|right|120px|Several [[sopila]] instruments.]]\nThe folk music of [[Medjimurje|Me\u0111imurje]], a small but distinct region in northernmost Croatia, with its melancholic and soothing tunes became the most popular form of folk to be used in the modern ''ethno'' pop-rock songs. Beside [[Cimbalom|Cimbule]] and [[Violin]]s, there is also a tradition of [[Brass]] orchestras which used to play an important role in cultural everyday life. On one hand, they were the foundation of every regional celebration or wedding but on the other hand they were also known for playing at funerals or funeral feasts.\n\nIn [[Istria]] and [[Kvarner]], native instruments like [[sopila]], [[curla]] and [[diple]] make a distinctive regional sound.  It is partially diatonic in nature following the unique [[Istrian scale]].\n\n===Events===\n\nThe [[Slavonia]]n town [[Po\u017eega, Croatia|Po\u017eega]] hosts a known folk [[music festival]], [[Zlatne \u017eice Slavonije]] (''Golden strings of Slavonia''), which has prompted musicians to compose new songs with far-reaching influences, recently including American [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]].\n\nThe towns of [[Vinkovci]] and [[\u0110akovo]], also in Slavonia, host yearly folklore festivals (''Vinkova\u010dke jeseni'' and ''\u0110akova\u010dki vezovi'') where folk music is also listened to as part of the tradition.\n\nThe town of Slavonski Brod holds an annual festival called Brodfest, where many of the great tamburica bands come together to play.\n\nThe Dubrovnik Summer Festival puts on dramatic music and ballet. It was founded in 1950.\n\nThe Osor Musical Evenings was founded in 1976 and takes place in July and August. It plays classical Croatian masters.\n\nThe Musical Evenings in Donat takes place during the summer in Zadar. It was founded in 1961, and plays old music.\n\n==Popular music==\n{{Main|Croatian popular music}}\n\n===Pop===\nThe [[pop music]] of Croatia generally resembles the ''canzone'' [[music of Italy]], while including elements of the native traditional music. Croatian record companies produce a lot of material each year, if only to populate the numerous [[music festivals]]. Of special note is the [[Split Festival]] which usually produces the most popular [[summer hit]]s.\n\nSeasoned pop singers in Croatia include: [[Meri Cetini\u0107]], [[Mi\u0161o Kova\u010d]], [[Ivo Robi\u0107]], [[Vice Vukov]], [[Milan Ba\u010di\u0107]], [[Arsen Dedi\u0107]], [[Vinko Coce]], [[Zdenka Vu\u010dkovi\u0107]], [[Darko Domjan]], [[Tereza Kesovija]], [[Gabi Novak]], [[Ivica \u0160erfezi]], [[Oliver Dragojevi\u0107]], [[Tomislav Iv\u010di\u0107]], [[Doris Dragovi\u0107]], [[Radojka \u0160verko]], [[Maja Blagdan]], and many others. Also, the groups [[Magazin]] and Grupa 777 have had sustained careers.\n\nIn more recent times, younger performers such as [[Nina Badri\u0107]], [[Severina Vu\u010dkovi\u0107|Severina]], [[Zlatan Stipi\u0161i\u0107 Gibonni|Gibonni]], [[Marko Perkovi\u0107 Thompson]], [[Toni Cetinski]], [[Jelena Rozga]], [[Danijela Martinovi\u0107|Danijela]], [[Lidija Ba\u010di\u0107]], [[Antonija \u0160ola]], [[Lana Jur\u010devi\u0107]] and many others have captured the attention of the pop audience. Each of them have successfully blended various influences into their distinct music style. For example, Thompson's songs include traditional epic themes from the [[Dinaric Alps|Dinaric regions]]; Severina threads between Croatian pop and a folk sound.\n\nCroatian pop music is fairly often listened to in [[Slovenia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[North Macedonia]] due to the union of Yugoslavia that existed until the 1990s. Conversely, Bosnian singers like [[Dino Merlin]] and Serbian [[\u0110or\u0111e Bala\u0161evi\u0107]] have an audience in Croatia, as well as some others. More recently the [[Turbo folk]]&nbsp;\u2013 frowned upon by the establishment some music critics and social commentators&nbsp;\u2013 has been popular amongst some sections of Croatian youth. A general resentment to Turbo folk remains as it is not broadcast on state radio and TV. Where on private outlets it may be transmitted, it normally triggers a strong negative reaction from those not liking it. Croatian singers that are using elements of Turbo folk are [[Severina Vu\u010dkovi\u0107|Severina]] and [[Jelena Rozga]].\n\nCroatia is a regular contestant on the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. Back in Yugoslavia, Croatian pop group [[Riva (music group)|Riva]] won the contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1989|1989]]. Some of the other Croatians who performed on the ESC include [[Daniel (Montenegrin singer)|Danijel Popovi\u0107]], [[Put (band)|Put]], [[Boris Novkovi\u0107]] and [[Claudia Beni]].\n\n===Rock===\nThe most popular rock bands active during the former Yugoslavia included [[Haustor]], [[Riva (band)|Riva]], [[Azra]], [[Prljavo Kazali\u0161te]] and [[Parni Valjak]].\n\nThere are several rather popular and long-lasting mainstream rock acts like [[Parni Valjak]], [[Prljavo Kazali\u0161te]], [[Crvena Jabuka]], [[Atomsko Skloni\u0161te]], [[Aerodrom (band)|Aerodrom]], Tutti Frutti Band, Daleka Obala, \u0110avoli, Stijene, More, Osmi putnik, Metak, etc. They originated in the 1970s and 1980s, and for the better part of their career resorted to a more mellow, mainstream pop-rock sound. Of some note is also the [[Sarajevo school of pop rock]] which influenced many of these bands, and which also included singers like [[\u017deljko Bebek]] who later worked in Croatia.\n\nHowever, [[New wave music in Yugoslavia|Croatian new wave]] (''Novi val'') movement, which exploded in 1979/80 and lasted throughout the 1980s, is considered by many to be the high-water mark of Croatian rock music, both in terms of quality and commercial success. The most influential and popular bands of ''Novi val'' were [[Azra]], [[Haustor]], [[Film]], even early [[Prljavo Kazali\u0161te]]. Other notable acts were [[Animatori]], [[Buldo\u017eer]], [[Paraf]], [[Patrola]] etc.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the region of [[Istria]] became home to a kind of called [[\u010ca-val]], which often used the [[\u010cakavian dialect]] and elements of traditional music from the regions of Istria and [[Kvarner]].\n\nThe new wave scene has collapsed by the end of the eighties, to be replaced by the newcomers like; Tutti Frutti band, [[Daleka Obala]], [[Majke]] and [[Laufer (band)|Laufer]]. While Daleka Obala sported a pop-rock sound influenced by Novi val, Croatian pop and even Dalmatian folk, Majke were a back-to-basics, garage-rock act stylistically influenced by bands like the [[Black Crowes]], [[Led Zeppelin]] or [[Black Sabbath]], as well as their Serbian counterparts [[Partibrejkers]]. Laufer, led by [[Damir Urban]] (who later went on to form [[Damir Urban|Urban &amp; 4]]), were an early nineties alternative rock band taking their cue from the grunge movement.\n\n[[Let 3]] and [[KUD Idijoti]] are also prominent rock acts, popular both for their music and their interesting, often controversial, performances and stunts.\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, folk-rock groups also sprouted across Croatia.  The first is said to be [[Vjestice|Vje\u0161tice]], who combined [[Medjimurje|Me\u0111imurje]] folk music with rock and set the stage for artists like [[Legen]], [[Lidija Bajuk]] and [[Dunja Knebl]]. At the same time on the other side of Croatia, in Istria, a band called [[Gustafi]] started playing their own strange amalgamate of rock and Istrian folk, but it took them more than a decade to reach the nationwide audience.\n\nThe Split [[heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Osmi Putnik]] has also been a success in Croatia and still are today and are also popular in other ex-Yugoslav republics\n\nThe Sisak [[surf rock]] band [[The Bambi Molesters]] has in the past years gained sizeable international fame and are often touted as one of the best surf-rock acts in the world today.\n\nAlternative rock/metal band [[Father (band)|Father]] have had success with their first album [[inspirita]] in countries like the [[UK]], and have toured with bands like [[Korn]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] and [[Apocalyptica]].\n\nThere is also a number of Croatian bands who play modern music in English, most prominent being [[My Buddy Moose]], [[The orange strips]], [[In-the-go]], [[Kimiko]], [[Cold Snap (band)|Cold Snap]] and [[Snovi]]\n\n===Dance===\n\n[[Dance music]] in Croatia was an offspring of the local pop music and more Western influences. It developed during the late 1980s and early 1990s, picking up on the trends such as [[euro disco]] and [[eurodance]]. It also spawned a wave of [[electronic music]] artists, mostly [[house music|house]], [[techno music|techno]] and [[trance music|trance]].\n\n[[Dino Dvornik]] is one of the pioneers of [[electronic music]] in Croatian.\n\nThe singer [[Vanna (singer)|Vanna]] rose to prominence through the dance trio ''E.T.'', and the music of [[Vesna Pisarovi\u0107]] has a fair bit of dance beat.\n\nAlthough E.T. still operates, they've changed singers several times and lost in popularity. The band [[Colonia (music group)|Colonia]] is perhaps the only one that rode the dance wave of the '90s and today is one of the most popular performers in Croatia.\n\n===Rap===\n\nThe 1990s were marked by the emergence of Croatian [[rap music]].  The Ugly Leaders released the first ever Croatian Hip-Hop album, and gained a strong following in and around Rijeka.  In 1991, the Croatian Liberation Front released two widely popular protest singles.   The first rap band to gain widespread and lasting acclaim was [[The Beat Fleet]] (TBF) from [[Split, Croatia|Split]], whose members took inspiration from harsh economic and social conditions of war-torn [[Dalmatia]], not that different from American inner cities. Their act was followed by a multitude of artists and groups in [[Zagreb]], taking inspiration from American [[gangsta rap]]. The Zagreb rappers [[Bolesna Bra\u0107a]] (also called ''Sick Rhyme Sayazz'') and [[Tram 11]] became particularly popular, and to an extent also the duo [[Nered]] & [[Stoka]].\n\nThe Croatian rap gained much from the fact [[Edo Maajka]], a [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] rapper, signed on to a label in Zagreb. Recently a rapper known as [[Shorty (rapper)|Shorty]] gained a lot of popularity by having songs with strong regional flavour of his native [[Vinkovci]]. The Zagreb band [[Elemental (music group)|Elemental]] also burst into the scene featuring one of the few Croatian female rappers.\n\n===Other===\n\nThe tendency to combine different elements also has a long presence in more [[european classical music|classical music]]: the opera [[Ero s onoga svijeta]], written by [[Jakov Gotovac]] in the 1930s, blended the traditional music of the [[Dinaric Alps|Dinaric]] peoples into a scholarly form and achieved great success.\n\n==Classical==\n\nClassical musicians and compositions by Croatian composers are generally not well known worldwide despite having produced a huge and interesting contribution over many centuries. Influences of style were often taken from neighbouring influences ([[Italy]], [[Austria]]) or settlers (in the Mediterranean Croatia from Italy, and in Panonia (north Croatia) from Germany and [[Bohemia]]).\n\nCroatian composers by current relevance in a global framework: (Maybe the order will change in the future, given that 95% of the composition exists as a single copy \u2013 the original manuscript, and yet need to be saved from oblivion, and then be performed and recorded on CD, and then presented to the international public)\n\n* [[Vatroslav Lisinski]] (born as Ignaz Fuchs) considered as the founder of the Croatian nationalist music composed the first Croatian national opera ''Ljubav i Zloba'' (''Love and Malice'') and national opera ''Porin''. Was a composer of great potential, but lived in a wrong time in a wrong place, and was a victim of politically-based intrigues.\n* [[Ivan Zajc]] (born as Giovanni von Zaytz) composed a series of operas in Italian, German and Croatian language. The music bears the features of authentic Italian melodics, since he grew up in a Croatian-Italian town Fiume (present-day Rijeka). His instrumental compositions \u2013 and there are a lot of them \u2013 are unknown to the public, and yet need to be explored by musicologists and than published.\n* [[Josip Hatze]] is the author of the first Croatian mass (ca. 1895) and the first Croatian cantata (''Night on Una'', 1902).\n* [[Dora Peja\u010devi\u0107]] (born as Theodora Pejacsevich) \u2013 one of the composers to introduce the orchestral song to Croatian music. Her Symphony in F-sharp minor is considered by scholars to be the first modern symphony in Croatian Music. \n* [[Blagoje Bersa]] (born as Benito Bersa) is a typical figure of late Romantic stylistic crisis, the author of 'futurustic' opera Der Eisenhammer / Oganj (Zagreb, 1911).\n* [[Fran Lhotka]] (alternative spelling: Franz Lhotka) \u2013 ballet The Devil in the Village; Violin Concerto; \n* [[Rudolf Matz]] (alternative spelling: Rudolph Matz) \u2013 School for the Violoncello; Concerto for Flute and Strings; Concertino in Modo Antico for Violoncello and Strings; \n* [[Bo\u017eidar Kunc]] \u2013 Piano Concerto; piano sonatas; songs for voice and piano; \n* [[Franjo Dugan]] \u2013 works for organ; Violin Sonata; \n* dr.

In 1947, the jazz orchestra of Radio Zagreb was founded, which lives on today as the \"[[Croatian Radiotelevision|HRT]] Big Band.\" In 1959, [[vibraphone]] player [[Bo\u0161ko Petrovi\u0107]], who was likely the most famous Croatian jazz musician, founded the ''Zagreb Jazz Quartet''. Today, there is a fair number of active jazz groups in Croatia, and various cities host jazz festivals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?id=23411|title=Culturenet.hr - Jazz|author=|date=|website=culturenet.hr|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> Jazz has left its mark on the Croatian pop scene throughout the years, most notably in the works of Drago Dikli\u0107 and occasionally Josipa Lisac.\n\n== Christian music ==\nCroatian Catholic priests of [[Dalmatia]], [[Istria]] and [[Kotor]] sang in [[Church Slavonic language]] during the 9th and 10th centuries, from which formed different forms of individual or choral spiritual music.
