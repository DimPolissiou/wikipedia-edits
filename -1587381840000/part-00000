Salters was playing keys for various artists in Paris ([[Femi Kuti]], [[-M-]], Vercoquin, [[DJ Mehdi]], etc.) before he moved to San Francisco in 1999. He started working on what would become General Elektriks as he was moving to the US, using his keyboards, a computer and a microphone. There, he hooked up with the [[Quannum Projects|Quannum Crew]] ([[Blackalicious]], [[Lyrics Born]], etc.) and started sessioning for them. He invited Quannum's own [[Lateef the Truthspeaker|Lateef The Truthspeaker]] and [[Chief Xcel]] on a few tracks, then completed the 1st General Elektriks album, ''Cliquety Kliqk'' (2003).\n\nAfter touring behind the album, Salters joined [[Blackalicious]] in the studio to work on ''The Craft'' and toured with them for over a year. Concurrently, he formed San Francisco trio [[Honeycut]] with singer Bart Davenport and drummer/programmer Tony Sevener. [[Quannum Projects]] released their critically acclaimed 1st album, [[The Day I Turned To Glass]], in 2006. As he was touring with [[Honeycut]] and laying keys down for more artists (hip hop group [[Lifesavas]], Brazilian artist [[Curumin]], beat maker [[Jel]], hip hop group [[the Mighty Underdogs]], etc....), Salters started working on a second General Elektriks effort. ''Good City For Dreamers'' was completed in the fall of 2008. This album showcased a more organic sound than its predecessor, blending sampled/programmed drums, live keyboards, horns and strings in a more seamless fashion; it also featured more of Salters' singing. Released in 2009, the record was spearheaded by the single \u2018Raid The Radio\u2019 and led to an 18 months tour.\n\nSalters then co-produced L.A rapper [[Pigeon John]]\u2019s album ''Dragon Slayer'' and got back together with his [[Honeycut]] counterparts to work on a second effort, \u2018Comedians.\u2019 He also wrote and produced the soundtrack to a gangster TV miniseries for French network France 2, \u2018Les Beaux Mecs,\u2019 and did a string of remixes for the likes of [[Femi Kuti]] and [[Mayer Hawthorne]]. Salters started working on a follow up to ''Good City For Dreamers'' during the winter of 2011. Written, arranged and produced in 4 months, ''Parker Street'' came out in the fall of 2011 and digs deeper into the organic blend of Funk, Pop and Jazz of its predecessor. \n\nSalters moved back to Europe during the Parker Street tour and settled in Berlin in 2012. The same year he teamed up with Blackalicious producer Chief Xcel to form Burning House. Showcasing a mix of Xcel's programming artistry and Salters' keyboards, their album ''Walking into A Burning House'' came out on French label Na\u00efve in 2013. After co-producing [[Pigeon John]]'s 4th studio album 'Encino Man' (2014), Salters started working on a follow up to ''Parker Street''. He concurrently wrote the music for a TV miniseries on Franco-German network Arte, 'Paris' (2015), and the same year co-wrote the soundtrack for French movie 'Arr\u00eatez-moi l\u00e0.' Salters' 4th studio album as General Elektriks, ''To Be A Stranger'', came out in the winter of 2016. It brings forth a darker lyrical approach focusing on the theme of identity (inspired by Salters' own gradual loss of roots, a result of having left France for the US and Germany). Brazilian singer C\u00e9u's ''Tropix'' album, which Salters had co-produced with Brazilian drummer Pupillo, came out later that year and went on to win 2 Latin Grammy Awards (Best Portuguese Language Contemporary Pop Album and Best Engineered Album). \n\nSalters and his live band recorded various shows from the 'To Be A Stranger' tour, which resulted in the live album ''Punk Funk City'' (Fall 2016). As much as the albums were Salters' own creation, General Elektriks had developed a strong live reputation that owed as much to each band member's talent and showmanship as to Salters'.

Salters was playing keys for various artists in Paris ([[Femi Kuti]], [[-M-]], Vercoquin, [[DJ Mehdi]], etc.) before he moved to San Francisco in 1999. He started working on what would become General Elektriks as he was moving to the US, using his keyboards, a computer and a microphone. There, he hooked up with the [[Quannum Projects|Quannum Crew]] ([[Blackalicious]], [[Lyrics Born]], etc.) and started sessioning for them. He invited Quannum's own [[Lateef the Truthspeaker|Lateef The Truthspeaker]] and [[Chief Xcel]] on a few tracks, then completed the 1st General Elektriks album, ''Cliquety Kliqk'' (2003).\n\nAfter touring behind the album, Salters joined [[Blackalicious]] in the studio to work on ''The Craft'' and toured with them for over a year. Concurrently, he formed San Francisco trio [[Honeycut]] with singer Bart Davenport and drummer/programmer Tony Sevener. [[Quannum Projects]] released their critically acclaimed 1st album, [[The Day I Turned To Glass]], in 2006. As he was touring with [[Honeycut]] and laying keys down for more artists (hip hop group [[Lifesavas]], Brazilian artist [[Curumin]], beat maker [[Jel]], hip hop group [[the Mighty Underdogs]], etc....), Salters started working on a second General Elektriks effort. ''Good City For Dreamers'' was completed in the fall of 2008. This album showcased a more organic sound than its predecessor, blending sampled/programmed drums, live keyboards, horns and strings in a more seamless fashion; it also featured more of Salters' singing. Released in 2009, the record was spearheaded by the single \u2018Raid The Radio\u2019 and led to an 18 months tour.\n\nSalters then co-produced L.A rapper [[Pigeon John]]\u2019s album ''Dragon Slayer'' and got back together with his [[Honeycut]] counterparts to work on a second effort, \u2018Comedians.\u2019 He also wrote and produced the soundtrack to a gangster TV miniseries for French network France 2, \u2018Les Beaux Mecs,\u2019 and did a string of remixes for the likes of [[Femi Kuti]] and [[Mayer Hawthorne]]. Salters started working on a follow up to ''Good City For Dreamers'' during the winter of 2011. Written, arranged and produced in 4 months, ''Parker Street'' came out in the fall of 2011 and digs deeper into the organic blend of Funk, Pop and Jazz of its predecessor. \n\nSalters moved back to Europe during the Parker Street tour and settled in Berlin in 2012. The same year he teamed up with Blackalicious producer Chief Xcel to form Burning House. Showcasing a mix of Xcel's programming artistry and Salters' keyboards, their album ''Walking into A Burning House'' came out on French label Na\u00efve in 2013. After co-producing [[Pigeon John]]'s 4th studio album 'Encino Man' (2014), Salters started working on a follow up to ''Parker Street''. He concurrently wrote the music for a TV miniseries on Franco-German network Arte, 'Paris' (2015), and the same year co-wrote the soundtrack for French movie 'Arr\u00eatez-moi l\u00e0.' Salters' 4th studio album as General Elektriks, ''To Be A Stranger'', came out in the winter of 2016. It brings forth a darker lyrical approach focusing on the theme of identity (inspired by Salters' own gradual loss of roots, a result of having left France for the US and Germany). Brazilian singer C\u00e9u's ''Tropix'' album, which Salters had co-produced with Brazilian drummer Pupillo, came out later that year and went on to win 2 Latin Grammy Awards (Best Portuguese Language Contemporary Pop Album and Best Engineered Album). \n\nSalters and his live band recorded various shows from the 'To Be A Stranger' tour, which resulted in the live album ''Punk Funk City'' (Fall 2016). As much as the albums were Salters' own creation, General Elektriks had developed a strong live reputation that owed as much to each band member's talent and showmanship as to Salters'. The line up on ''Punk Funk City'' was still the one that Salters had assembled in 2009 at the time of ''Good City For Dreamers'': Jessie Chaton on electric bass and synth bass, Jordan Dalrymple on drums and MPC, Eric Starczan on guitar, Touski on vibraphone and drums, and Salters on Clavinet/Fender Rhodes/synth.

She departed for a training cruise to drill new navy officers. <ref name=cunat33 />  From that time till the beginning of the [[War of American Independence]] he commanded vessels in the squadron of evolution which the French government had established for the purpose of training its officers. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} \n\n=== War of American independence ===\n{{Main|Franco-American alliance|Anglo-French War (1778\u20131783)|Naval battles of the American Revolutionary War}}\nTensions mounted between France and England in early 1778 in the context of the [[American Revolutionary War]], with the [[Action of 17 June 1778]] constituting a step up announcing the [[Anglo-French War (1778\u20131783)|Anglo-French War]].

Failing to do so, he sailed to Batticaloa, where he arrived on 8 August to find ''Consolante'', arrived from Isle de France three days earlier. From ''Consolante'', Suffren learnt that two French ships of the line escorting 8 transports were anchored at [[Galle]], waiting to join up with him. Suffren had sent a light ship to Trincomalee, which returned announcing that the British ship were not there. Suffren then decided to lay siege to Trincomalee.<ref name=Hennequin311 />\n\nOn 21 August, the two ships of the convoy arrived. Suffren had ammunition from the convoy distributed among his warships to replenish their magazines, and explained his intentions to the captains. <ref name=Hennequin311 /> The same day, the cutter ''L\u00e9zard'' arrived from France, bringing despatches. The letter notably carried official approval of Suffren's conduct at the Battle of Porto Praya, and granted the requests he had made to appoint his officers. Furthermore, a letter from [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]], [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller]], informed him that he was promoted to Bailiff of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].<ref name=Hennequin312>Hennequin, p.312</ref>\n\nOn 25 August, the fleet set sail and formed a battle line, soon arriving in view of the forts of Trincomalee. 2,000 men quickly landed, with siege artillery, ammunition and three days worth of rations. By 29, the French had completed their siege battery emplacements, and they started bombarding the fort. On 30, at 0900, Suffren sent a message to [[Fort Ostenburg]] to negotiate its capitulation.

Meanwhile, Suffren received news that Hyder Ali had left Cuddalore with his army to fight in the North, leaving the city vulnerable to a British attack fom Madras. As Cuddalore was a crucial supply depot, it was imperative for Suffren to protect it. Suffren departed Trincomalee on 1 October to reinforce Cuddalore, <ref name=Hennequin317 /> arriving on 4 October. The expected British attack did not happen, and on 12 October, the change in monsoon forced both fleets to shelter in harbour. Hughes anchored at Bombay, <ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref> while Suffren chose to sail to [[Aceh]].

On 12 january 1783, the frigate [[HMS Coventry (1757)|HMS ''Coventry'']], unaware of the presence of the French fleet and mistaking its ships of East Indiamen, approached and had to surrender. From the prisoners, Suffren learnt of  Hyder Ali's death. The fleet continued to Cuddalore, arriving there on 1 February.<ref name=Hennequin320 /> Peynier's squadron of 3 ships and 1 frigate arrived shortly afterwards with 30 transports, survivors of a much larger convoy that had lost a number of ships to the elements and to the British. <ref name=Hennequin321>Hennequin, p.321</ref>\n\n\n\nStill, when Suffren met Hughes at the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] (20 April 1783), with fifteen ships to eighteen, Suffren forced Hughes to retire to Madras, leaving the army then besieging C\u00fcddalore in a very dangerous position. The arrival of the news that peace had been made in Europe put a stop to hostilities, and Suffren returned to France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Death===\nWhile refitting at the Cape on his way home, several of the vessels also returning put in, and the captains waited on him. Suffren said in one of his letters that their praise gave him more pleasure than any other compliment paid him. In France he was received with enthusiasm, and in 1781 he succeeded Comte d'Aubigny unopposed to the office of vice-[[admiral of France]] (Ponant or the Atlantic). He had been promoted bailli in the Order of Malta during his absence. His death occurred very suddenly, when he was about to take command of a fleet collected in Brest. He died of apoplexy, due to a \"gout travelling upwards added to a putrid abscess\"<ref>Letter of Suffren's valet, quote in Glachant, p.377; quoted in Taillemite, p.323</ref><ref group=Note>\"''Goutte remont\u00e9e jointe \u00e0 un abc\u00e8s putride</ref>\n\nA legend has it that many years afterwards his body servant told M. Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\nSeven ships of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez.

Suffren gave permission but, unwilling to scatter his forces, ordered his entire squadron to move into [[Praia Harbor|Praia Harbour]]. Arriving there at 0830 the morning of 16 April, ''Art\u00e9sien'' spotted five British warship at anchor; she turned, signalling \"enemy ships in sight\". Understanding that random chance had put him in contact with [[George Johnstone (royal navy)|George Johnstone]]'s squadron,<ref name=hennequin294>Hennequin, p.294</ref> Suffren ordered an immediate attack.<ref name=cunat50>Cunat, p.50</ref> At 1000, Suffren's squadron attacked, precipitating the [[Battle of Porto Praya]].

''Charmante'' returned to Lorient to bring the news of the engagement, while the other survivors sailed on to Isle de France. By 1780, Tronjoly was recalled to France, leaving d'Orves in command with a total of six ships of the line at his disposal.<ref name=cunat83 />\n\nSuffren arrived at Isle de France on 25 October 1781.<ref name=cunat94>Cunat, p.94</ref><ref name=hennequin297>Hennequin, p.297</ref> The island had been selected as the base for French operations in the Indian Ocean, falling under the overall command of [[Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau]].<ref name=cunat95>Cunat, p.95</ref>\n\nOn 7 December 1781, d'Orves led a 27-ship fleet to Ceylon, with his flag on ''Orient''. He had 11 ships of the line, 3 frigates and 3 corvettes at his disposal. En route, d'Orves changed his objectif from [[Trincomalee]] to [[Madras]].<ref name=cunat97>Cunat, p.97</ref><ref group=Note>Present-day [[Chennai]]</ref> On 19 January, ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' detected a strange sail, and d'Orves detached ''H\u00e9ros'' and ''Art\u00e9sien'' to investigate. Suffren closed in, making signals according to tables captured at Porto Praya on the East Indiaman [[Hinchinbrooke (1780 ship)|''Hinchinbrooke'']], until the ship made signals that he was unable to answer. A chase ensued, and with the night Suffren abandonned the pursuit to rejoin the fleet. On 21, the fleet encountered the same ship again, and again detached ''H\u00e9ros'', ''Art\u00e9sien'' and ''Vengeur'', but this time with other ships deploying as to ensure communication between the pursuers and the main body of the fleet, allowing Suffren to press on his chase. Suffren caught up with his quarry on 22 around noon and forced her to surrender.

The fleet arrived North of Madras on 5 February 1782, and its light units started praying on coastal merchantmen and capturing cargo of rice.<ref name=cunat101>Cunat, p.101</ref> However, the [[monsoon]] caused strong winds from the South which trapped the French North of Madras, while at the same time favouring the return of Hughes' squadron from Ceylon to Madras.<ref name=cunat102>Cunat, p.102</ref> Upon Hughes' arrival, [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|Lord Macartney]] warned him of the presence of the French squadron, and Hughes anchored his ships under the protection of [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]] and [[George Town, Chennai|Black Town]]. On 9 February 1782, Hughes received reinforcements with the arrival of a squadron comprising the 64-gun [[HMS Monmouth (1772)|HMS ''Monmouth'']], the [[74-gun]] [[HMS Hero (1759)|''Hero'']], the 50-gun [[HMS Isis (1774)|''Isis'']] and the armed transport ''Manilla'', under [[James Alms]]. \n\nD'Orves died the same day at 1600. Suffren re-appointed his captains to the ships of the squadon: Captain de Lapalli\u00e8re{{refn|Sometimes spelt \"la Palli\u00e8re\"<ref name=cunat104 />|group=Note}} took command of ''Orient'' and Cillart that of ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re''; Captain [[Justin Bonaventure Morard de Galles|Morard de Galles]], of ''Pourvoyeuse'', and Lieutenant de Ruyter, in temporary command of ''Petit Annibal'', exchanged their positions; Beaulieu went on ''Bellone'';<ref name=cunat103>Cunat, p.103</ref>  Tromelin (the Younger) took on ''Subtile''; and Galifet took ''Sylphide''.

In the evening, [[French frigate Fine (1779)|''Fine'']], under Perrier de Salvert, came in view of Madras harbour and Hughes' squadron. Seeing Hugues anchored in a very strong defensive position, Suffren decided to sail off the coast, <ref name=cunat105>Cunat, p.105</ref> but to his surprise, Hugues left the safety of the forts and gave chase.<ref name=cunat106>Cunat, p.106</ref> Suffren deployed a frigate screen to warn his squadron of Hugues' moves, but during the night ''Pourvoyeuse'' drifted away from the fleet due to a navigation error, while  ''Fine'' lost sight of the British ships, and both thus failed to keep Suffren appraised of Hughes's position.<ref name=cunat108>Cunat, p.108</ref> In the morning, signals from ''Fine'' informed Suffren that HMS ''Montmouth'', ''Hero'', ''Isis'', ''Aigle'' and ''Burford'' where approaching the French transports.

After consulting [[Hyder Ali]], he decided not to land his troops in Pondich\u00e9ry, and rather to head for [[Parangipettai|Porto Nove]], where he arrived on 23 February. <ref name=hennequin299>Hennequin, p.299</ref> Hyder Ali despatched [[Andr\u00e9 Piveron de Morlat]], the French ambassador, to act as an intermediary between Suffren and himself, along with two of his officiers. Suffren negotiated an agreement that French troops would retain their own command; that a 4,000-man cavalry and 6,000-man infantry force would reinforce them; and that they be paid 24 [[Lakh]] rupee a year.<ref name=hennequin302>Hennequin, p.302</ref> Suffren landed his troops at Porto Nove, and departed on 23 March to search for the British fleet.\n\nOn 10 April, the two fleet came into view, and they spent two days in manoeuvers, trying to gain an advantage on the other. On 12, the [[Battle of Providien]] broke out, leaving both squadrons damaged. Suffren retreated to the safety of the Dutch forts of [[Batticaloa|Batacalo]] to repair, and tend to those members of his crews who were wounded or suffered from scurvy.<ref name=hennequin302 />\n\n==== Battle of Negapatam ====\n{{Main|Battle of Negapatam (1782)}}\nOn 3 June, Suffren departed Batacalo and sailed to [[Cuddalore]], where he received letters from Hyder Ali requesting that he lay siege to [[Nagapattinam]]. The French troops reembarked on their transports, when ''Bellone'', which had been left to patrol, came with news that Hughes' squadron was at Nagapattinam.

He also informed Hyder Ali that a French frigate had intercepted a British schooner carrying Colonal Horn to Nagapattinam. Hyder Ali responded with luxurious gifts to Suffren and his officers, or with gifts represented by their equivalent value in rupees.

Hyder Ali was especially concerned by British advance on the [[Malabar Coast]] and the risk that the [[Maratha Empire]] would switch sides, ally with the British and start a war with Mysore.{{refn|The [[Maratha\u2013Mysore War]] was to start three years later.|group=Note}}\n\nMeanwhile, the French squadron was effecting repairs, especially to its rigging, and ''Pourvoyeuse'' sailed to [[Malacca]] to pick up [[Spar (sailing)|spars]].<ref name=Hennequin311>Hennequin, p.311</ref> In early August, Suffren learnt that the British fleet had departed Nagapattinam and was embarking troops in Madras, bound for an unknown destination. Suffren departed at once for [[Tharangambadi]] in the hope of undercovering the British plans. Failing to do so, he sailed to Batticaloa, where he arrived on 8 August to find ''Consolante'', arrived from Isle de France three days earlier. From ''Consolante'', Suffren learnt that two French ships of the line escorting 8 transports were anchored at [[Galle]], waiting to join up with him. Suffren had sent a light ship to Trincomalee, which returned announcing that the British ship were not there. Suffren then decided to lay siege to Trincomalee.<ref name=Hennequin311 />\n\nOn 21 August, the two ships of the convoy arrived. Suffren had ammunition from the convoy distributed among his warships to replenish their magazines, and explained his intentions to the captains. <ref name=Hennequin311 /> The same day, the cutter ''L\u00e9zard'' arrived from France, bringing despatches. The letter notably carried official approval of Suffren's conduct at the Battle of Porto Praya, and granted the requests he had made to appoint his officers. Furthermore, a letter from [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]], [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller]], informed him that he was promoted to Bailiff of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].<ref name=Hennequin312>Hennequin, p.312</ref>\n\nOn 25 August, the fleet set sail and formed a battle line, soon arriving in view of the forts of Trincomalee. 2,000 men quickly landed, with siege artillery, ammunition and three days worth of rations. By 29, the French had completed their siege battery emplacements, and they started bombarding the fort. On 30, at 0900, Suffren sent a message to [[Fort Ostenburg]] to negotiate its capitulation. The British surrendered the fort in exchange for its 1,000-man garrison to be sent to Madras.<ref name=Hennequin312 />\n\nOn 3 September, the British fleet arrived. Suffren reembarked his troops and moved to intercept, leading to the [[Battle of Trincomalee]].<ref name=Hennequin314>Hennequin, p.314</ref> The French line fought desorganised, especially after ''Vengeur'' caught fire and have to distance herself from other ships. The flag of ''H\u00e9ros'' was shot away by British fire and Suffren had new French ensigns hoisted to continue the fight. After one hour and a half, night fell and the battle ended. Suffren was furious at the conduct of his captains, whom he accused of abandonning him.<ref name=Hennequin316>Hennequin, p.316</ref> The next day, the British fleet had disappeared, and Suffren returned to Trincomalee, where he arrived in the evening of 7 September 1782.<ref name=Hennequin317>Hennequin, p.317</ref> \n\n==== Battle of Cuddalore ====\n{{Main|Battle of Cuddalore (1783)}}\nWhen the French squadron arrived at Trincomalee in the evening of 7 September 1782 after the Battle of Trincomalee, its ships were seriously damaged. ''H\u00e9ros'', in particular, was leaking and had lost her foremast and mainmast. The ships anchored to effect repairs, which the crew completed in two weeks. Meanwhile, Suffren received news that Hyder Ali had left Cuddalore with his army to fight in the North, leaving the city vulnerable to a British attack fom Madras. As Cuddalore was a crucial supply depot, it was imperative for Suffren to protect it. Suffren departed Trincomalee on 1 October to reinforce Cuddalore, <ref name=Hennequin317 /> arriving on 4 October. The expected British attack did not happen, and on 12 October, the change in monsoon forced both fleets to shelter in harbour. Hughes anchored at Bombay, <ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref> while Suffren chose to sail to [[Aceh]]. By choosing Aceh, Suffren avoided both being driven away from the battlefield as he would have by chosing Isle de France, and the climate of Trincomalee which he feared would be detrimental to his crew.<ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref>\n\nThe French squadron left Cuddalore on 15 October 1782 and arrived at Aceh on 1 November. ''Pourvoyeuse'' and ''Bellone'' arrived shortly after with spare parts, and the fleet spent the following weeks tending to the sick and effecting repairs.<ref name=Hennequin319>Hennequin, p.319</ref> After a while, a corvette arrived from Isle de France, bringing news that a 3-ship squadron under [[Antoine de Thomassin de Peynier]] was about to arrive, escorting a convoy ferrying troops and ammunitions, as well as Bussy-Castelnau.<ref name=Hennequin320>Hennequin, p.320</ref>\n\nSuffren's fleet set sail on 20 December to return to Coromandel. On the way, it raided the British colony of [[Ganjam]], destroying a number of merchantmen. On 12 january 1783, the frigate [[HMS Coventry (1757)|HMS ''Coventry'']], unaware of the presence of the French fleet and mistaking its ships of East Indiamen, approached and had to surrender. From the prisoners, Suffren learnt of  Hyder Ali's death. The fleet continued to Cuddalore, arriving there on 1 February.<ref name=Hennequin320 /> Peynier's squadron of 3 ships and 1 frigate arrived shortly afterwards with 30 transports, survivors of a much larger convoy that had lost a number of ships to the elements and to the British. <ref name=Hennequin321>Hennequin, p.321</ref>\n\n\n\nStill, when Suffren met Hughes at the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] (20 April 1783), with fifteen ships to eighteen, Suffren forced Hughes to retire to Madras, leaving the army then besieging C\u00fcddalore in a very dangerous position. The arrival of the news that peace had been made in Europe put a stop to hostilities, and Suffren returned to France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Death===\nWhile refitting at the Cape on his way home, several of the vessels also returning put in, and the captains waited on him. Suffren said in one of his letters that their praise gave him more pleasure than any other compliment paid him. In France he was received with enthusiasm, and in 1781 he succeeded Comte d'Aubigny unopposed to the office of vice-[[admiral of France]] (Ponant or the Atlantic). He had been promoted bailli in the Order of Malta during his absence. His death occurred very suddenly, when he was about to take command of a fleet collected in Brest. He died of apoplexy, due to a \"gout travelling upwards added to a putrid abscess\"<ref>Letter of Suffren's valet, quote in Glachant, p.377; quoted in Taillemite, p.323</ref><ref group=Note>\"''Goutte remont\u00e9e jointe \u00e0 un abc\u00e8s putride</ref>\n\nA legend has it that many years afterwards his body servant told M. Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports.

A grouping of [[Central England]] based on UK EU parliamentary constituency boundaries combines [[the Midlands]] and [[East Anglia]].\n\nIn political terms, the South, and particularly the South-East (outside [[Greater London]]) and [[East Anglia]], is largely centre-right, and supportive of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], while [[Northern England]] (particularly the towns and cities) is generally more supportive of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].\n\nAn article in ''[[The Economist]]'' (15\u201321 September 2012) argued that the gap between the north and south in life expectancy, political inclinations and economics trends was growing to the extent that they were almost separate countries.<ref name=\"Economist\"/>\n\n==Existence==\nThe North\u2013South divide is not an exact line, but one that can involve many stereotypes, presumptions and other impressions of the surrounding region relative to other regions. The existence of the North\u2013South divide is fiercely contested. Some sources claim that not only does it exist, but that it is expanding. For example, a Cambridge Econometrics report of March 2006 found that economic growth above the UK average was occurring only in the South and [[South East England]], whilst [[North East England]] showed the slowest growth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.camecon.com/whatsnew/releases/pdffiles/UK%20Regional%20Report%20Press%20Release%20March%202006_No%20tables.pdf | title = The North-South Divide Widened in the Last Economic Cycle | accessdate = 16 July 2006 | date = 27 March 2006 | publisher = Cambridge Econometrics |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060725160233/http://www.camecon.com/whatsnew/releases/pdffiles/UK%20Regional%20Report%20Press%20Release%20March%202006_No%20tables.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 25 July 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/328/7447/1043?ijkey=76a2ead76e6828d38e96cd46ded8f235930215ca&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha | title=Is there a north-south divide in social class inequalities in health in Great Britain?

On the other hand, geographically southern areas such as the [[Isle of Thanet]] in [[Kent]] have struggled with the same [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]] as parts of the north. [[Cornwall]], many London boroughs such as [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]] and southern towns like [[Luton]] are other anomalies to the North-South divide with poor health and education.\n\nThis has led some commentators to suggest that other divisions, such as class<ref>{{cite news | first = Kamal | last = Ahmed | url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/education/story/0,12554,837171,00.html | title = Britain's class divide starts even before nursery school | newspaper = The Observer | date = 10 November 2002 | accessdate = 16 July 2006 | location=London}}</ref> or ethnicity might be more important.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dwp.gov.uk/publications/dwp/2006/poverty/tackling-poverty.pdf | title = Making a difference: Tackling poverty \u2013 a progress report | accessdate = 16 July 2006 | date = March 2006 | publisher = Department for Work and Pensions | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060725160232/http://www.dwp.gov.uk/publications/dwp/2006/poverty/tackling-poverty.pdf | archivedate = 25 July 2006 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Economist claims that one of the main causes of the divide was the migration of young professionals from the north to work in London, whereas it is much less common for young professionals from the south to move to a northern city.<ref name=\"Economist\">[http://www.economist.com/node/21562938 The north of England: the great divide], The Economist, 15\u201321 September 2012, volume 404, number 8802</ref>\n\nThe IPPR published the \"State of the North 2019\" report, from IPPR North, which blames regional inequality on power centralisation and the lack of devolution.

Exclusive shopping destinations such as Leeds' [[Victoria Quarter]] have led to the city being dubbed 'The Knightsbridge of the North'.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/4575275.stm |title=City is 'Knightsbridge of North' |publisher=BBC |work = BBC News Online |date=24 May 2005 |accessdate=14 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[Bradford]] based supermarket [[Morrisons]], which mainly operated in the North of England acquired 479 stores when it bought [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]] in 2004, the majority of these new supermarkets were in the south of England.<ref>{{cite news|title=Morrisons seals Safeway takeover|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3542291.stm|publisher=BBC NEWS|accessdate=25 January 2012|date=8 March 2004}}</ref> Other Northern founded supermarkets such as [[Asda]], [[Co-op Food]] and [[Marks & Spencer]] are also popular in the south of England.\n\nWriter and journalist [[Stuart Maconie]] argues that \"there is no south of England... There's a bottom half of England... but there isn't a south in the same way that there's a north\".<ref>[[#Maconie|Maconie (2007)]], p. 1.</ref> He goes on to state that \"there's no conception of the south comparable to the north. Good or bad, 'the north' means something to all [[English people]] wherever they hail from... [to southerns] it means desolation, arctic temperatures, [[mushy peas]], a cultural wasteland with limited shopping opportunities and populated by aggressive trolls. To northerners it means home, [[truth]], [[beauty]], [[valour]], [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], warm and characterful people, [[Ale|real beer]] and decent chip shops. And in this we are undoubtedly biased, of course\". This suggests that all people in England have biased views regarding the North-South divide.<ref>[[#Maconie|Maconie (2007)]], p. 2.</ref> Maconie says regarding on where the North starts that \"[[Crewe]] is surely the gateway to the North\", suggesting that Crewe is the most southern part of the north of England.<ref>[[#Maconie|Maconie (2007)]], p. 35.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|England|Society}}\n*[[Danelaw]]\n*[[Geography and identity in Wales]]\n*[[Lloegyr]]\n*[[M53 motorway|M53 divide]]\n*[[North Britain]] and [[South Britain]]\n*[[North\u2013South divide]]\n*[[North\u2013South divide in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[River Trent]]\n*[[Stereotype]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |first=Helen M. |last=Jewell |title=The North-South Divide: the origins of Northern consciousness in England |place=Manchester |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1994 |isbn=0-7190-3803-0 }}\n*{{Cite book |last=Maconie |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart Maconie |title=Pies and Prejudice: In Search of the North |publisher=Ebury Press/ Ebury Publishing |location=[[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-09-191023-5 |ref=Maconie}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Cite journal |first=John |last=Griffin |title='Rivalling the Metropolis': Cultural conflict between London and the regions c. 1967\u20131973 |journal=[[Contemporary British History]] |volume=33 |issue=4 |year=2019 |pages=524\u2013547 |doi=10.1080/13619462.2018.1519434}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:North-South divide (England)}}\n[[Category:Geography of England]]\n[[Category:Northern England|.]]\n[[Category:Southern England|.]]\n[[Category:Economic geography]]\n[[Category:English society]]\n", "name_user": "109.146.121.60", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North%E2%80%93South_divide_(England)"}
