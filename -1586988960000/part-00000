In the middle of the investigation, Walt learns that his son-in-law, Officer Michael Moretti, was killed in the line of duty in Philadelphia; although he desperately wants to fly east and assist in the investigation, he remains stuck in Durant to complete his own case (however, he does allow Vic, Michael's sister, to take a leave of absence).<ref name=\"Dry Bones\">{{cite book |last= Johnson|first= Craig|date= May 12, 2015|title= Dry Bones|url= |location= |publisher= Penguin Books|page= |isbn= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nDuring his career, he becomes well-respected by not only his county, but also by the [[Wyoming Attorney General|Wyoming State Attorney General's Office]] (including the Attorney General, Joe Meyer, himself), the DCI, and even the [[List of Governors of Wyoming|governor of Wyoming]].<ref name=\"Kindness Goes Unpunished\"/> Later mentioned, somewhat jokingly, if a police officer is murdered in Wyoming, Walt Longmire is on the case.\n\nAs sheriff, Walt carries a [[M1911 pistol|M1911A1]] in .45 ACP (the same one he used in the Marine Corps) as his primary weapon, and drives a pickup truck that he calls the Silver Bullet (or just Bullet).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Craig|title=The Cold Dish|page=4}}</ref>\n\n===Relationships===\nWalt is a widower; Martha, his wife, was murdered in Denver, Colorado, while suffering from cancer (in the TV series; in the books she dies of cancer). With Martha, he had a daughter, Cady, who is now an attorney in Philadelphia. In ''As the Crow Flies'', Walt mentions that he dated Martha before he was drafted, and that their relationship resumed after he came home from the war. The two eloped and were married by a justice of the peace in [[Miles City, Montana]], when her father refused to pay for a big church wedding. In the same book, Cady marries Philadelphia Police Officer Michael Moretti, the brother of Walt's undersheriff, Vic Moretti, on the Rez; Michael and she had been seeing each other since ''Kindness Goes Unpunished'' and engaged since ''The Dark Horse''. In ''Any Other Name'', Cady guves birth to a daughter, Lola Longmire Moretti. In ''The Western Star'', it is revealed that Walt and Martha first got pregnant in 1972, but they lost the baby in a first-trimester miscarriage.<ref name=\"Western Star\"/>\n\nWalt's closest friend and confidant is Henry Standing Bear. They have been friends since they were 12 years old, and both went to Vietnam (although Henry was a member of the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|United States Army Special Forces]], while Walt was a Marine MP), where they were both highly decorated. When Cady was born, Walt appointed Henry her godfather.\n\nAfter Cady is assaulted in Philadelphia, Vic (who was assisting the police in the investigation) and Walt have sex. In the aftermath, Walt mentions that he has had sex with only six women in his life.<ref name=\"Kindness Goes Unpunished\"/> The two continue their relationship after returning to Durant; in ''A Serpent's Tooth'', Walt learns from the doctor that Vic was pregnant, but lost the baby after being stabbed during the confrontation with Tom\u00e1s Bidarte.

He is an able detective, who has a knack for finding the truth behind the various crimes that have been committed in his county.\n\nAs the series starts in 2012, Walt is slowly coming out of a deep grieving period where he delegated most of the day-to-day police duties to Deputies Branch Connally ([[Bailey Chase]]), Archie \"The Ferg\" Ferguson (Adam Bartley), and Victoria \"Vic\" Moretti ([[Katee Sackhoff]]).

Martha was diagnosed with cancer in the late 2000s/early 2010s, and died in 2011. Although Walt let everybody (including Cady) assume it was the cancer that took her life, Martha was murdered in an apparent mugging in [[Denver]], Colorado, by a man named Miller Beck. During his own investigation into his wife's death, Walt learned that Beck was hired to kill Martha, and then he was killed shortly thereafter to prevent him from talking to Walt. In \"High Noon\", Walt got a drunken confession out of Barlow Connally admitting to killing his own son and having Martha murdered; in the ensuing confrontation, Walt fatally shot Barlow and avenged his deputy and his wife.<ref name=\"High Noon\"/>\n\nIn \"Highway Robbery\", Walt asks out Dr. Donna Sue Monaghan ([[Ally Walker]]), a psychiatrist who works for the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]] in [[Sheridan, Wyoming]].<ref name=\"Highway Robber\">{{Cite episode|title=Highway Robbery|series=[[Longmire (TV series)|Longmire]]|airdate=September 10, 2015|season=4|number=7}}</ref>\n\nWalt's closest friend and confidant is Henry Standing Bear. They have been friends since they were 12 years old. When Cady was born, Walt appointed Henry her godfather.\n\nRecently prior to the date when the show starts, Walt hired Vic Moretti, a former Philadelphia PD homicide detective, as a Deputy Sheriff. The two are believed by many to be having an affair, including at one point Vic's husband, Sean Keegan ([[Michael Mosley (actor)|Michael Mosley]]). In the Season{{nbsp}}6 finale Walt and Vic finally realise and admit their feelings for one another and begin a relationship.\n\nWalt's relationship with the Cheyenne Nation is strained, but Walt is still liked by many members of its community.\n\n===Deputies===\nOn the series, Walt is assisted with his duties by three deputy sheriffs. After Branch's death, Walt hires Zachary Heflin, but fires him after he assaults a rejected deputy applicant who was stalking him.\n\n* Deputy Sheriff Branch Connally, ACSD (2008\u20132014, suspended; killed by Barlow Connally)\n* Deputy Sheriff Archie \"The Ferg\" Ferguson, ACSD (2011\u2013present)\n* Deputy Sheriff Victoria \"Vic\" Moretti, ACSD (2011\u2013present)\n* Deputy Sheriff Zachary \"Zack\" Heflin, ACSD (2015, fired; rehired, 2017)\n\nIn addition, Deputy Sheriff Eamonn O'Neill was on loan from Cumberland County to assist the office when both Walt and Branch were otherwise occupied, leaving Vic to run day to day affairs.\n\nAlso, Ruby (no last name specified) runs the sheriff's office and serves as dispatcher.\n\n==Differences between the books and TV series==\nAmong the key differences between the books and the TV series are the character's age and backstory. In the books, it is established that Walt is a college graduate and [[Vietnam War]] veteran, and has been the Absaroka County Sheriff since the early 1980s. However, on the TV show, no mention have been made or alluded to of a college or a military career (although those haven't been ruled out, either), and Walt's age has been established multiple times, via his having graduated from high school in 1981 and having been friends with Henry since they were 12 years old, 38 years earlier.\n\nIn a significant departure from the books, on the show, Walt's wife Martha did not die from cancer. Although she was diagnosed with the disease, in the TV series she was murdered, and the associated details are slowly revealed over several seasons, significantly affecting Walt's relationships with his deputy Branch and the Connally family.\n\nWhile the TV series portrays Vic as being interested in Walt, her feelings aren't reciprocated like they are in the books. Instead, the TV series has Walt slowly recovering from losing his wife, unable or unwilling to maintain a relationship with a woman called Lizzie Ambrose, before finally showing enough interest in a member of the opposite sex to actively court Dr. Donna Sue Monaghan. Only as the show draws to a close does Walt start a relationship with Vic.\n\nIn the books, Absaroka County sees five murders in 24 years. The TV series sees 27 confirmed murders in the two first seasons alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/the-body-count-is-longmires-absaroka-county-the-most-murder-plagued-place-on-tv/ |title=The Body Count: Is [https://moviesjackets.com/Long-Coat-Men-Coats-and-Jackets-Sheriff-Walt-Longmire-Robert-Taylor Longmire] Absaroka County the Most Murder-Plagued Place on TV? \u00ab |publisher=Grantland.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-15}}</ref>\n\n\n===Longmire Days===\nIn 2012, the first Annual \"Longmire Days\" was held in the city of [[Buffalo, Wyoming]], celebrating the series and local community.<ref name=\"Longmire Days\">{{cite web|title=Longmire Days A Success For Durant...Well, Buffalo|url=https://www.sheridanmedia.com/news/longmire-days-success-durantwell-buffalo66319 |access-date=2019-02-10}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Longmire, Walt}}\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 2004]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2012]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Wyoming]]\n[[Category:Fictional sheriffs]]\n[[Category:Fictional United States Marine Corps personnel]]\n[[Category:Fictional Vietnam War veterans]]\n", "text_old": "'''Walter Longmire''' is the [[title character]] of ''Walt Longmire Mysteries'', a series of [[mystery fiction|mystery novels]] written by best-selling author [[Craig Johnson (author)|Craig Johnson]], and of its televised adaptation &ndash; ''[[Longmire (TV series)|Longmire]]'', a [[crime drama]] series developed by John Coveny and Hunt Baldwin.

In the middle of the investigation, Walt learns that his son-in-law, Officer Michael Moretti, was killed in the line of duty in Philadelphia; although he desperately wants to fly east and assist in the investigation, he remains stuck in Durant to complete his own case (however, he does allow Vic, Michael's sister, to take a leave of absence).<ref name=\"Dry Bones\">{{cite book |last= Johnson|first= Craig|date= May 12, 2015|title= Dry Bones|url= |location= |publisher= Penguin Books|page= |isbn= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nDuring his career, he has become well-respected by not only his county, but also by the [[Wyoming Attorney General|Wyoming State Attorney General's Office]] (including the Attorney General, Joe Meyer, himself), the DCI, and even the [[List of Governors of Wyoming|governor of Wyoming]].<ref name=\"Kindness Goes Unpunished\"/> Later mentioned, somewhat jokingly, if a police officer is murdered in Wyoming, Walt Longmire is on the case.\n\nAs sheriff, Walt carries a [[M1911 pistol|M1911A1]] in .45 ACP (the same one he used in the Marine Corps) as his primary weapon, and drives a pickup truck that he calls the Silver Bullet (or just Bullet).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Craig|title=The Cold Dish|page=4}}</ref>\n\n===Relationships===\nWalt is a widower; Martha, his wife, was murdered in Denver, Co, while suffering from cancer (in the TV series; in the books she died of cancer). With Martha, he had a daughter, Cady, who is now an attorney in Philadelphia. In \"As the Crow Flies\", Walt mentions that he dated Martha before he was drafted, and that their relationship resumed after he came home from the war. The two eloped and were married by a justice of the peace in [[Miles City, Montana]], when her father refused to pay for a big church wedding. In the same book, Cady married Philadelphia Police Officer Michael Moretti, the brother of Walt's undersheriff, Vic Moretti, on the Rez; Michael and she had been seeing each other since \"Kindness Goes Unpunished\" and engaged since \"The Dark Horse\". In \"Any Other Name\", Cady gave birth to a daughter, Lola Longmire Moretti. In \"The Western Star\", Walt and Martha first got pregnant in 1972, but they lost the baby in a first-trimester miscarriage.<ref name=\"Western Star\"/>\n\nWalt's closest friend and confidant is Henry Standing Bear. They have been friends since they were 12 years old, and both went to Vietnam (although Henry was a member of the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|United States Army Special Forces]], while Walt was a Marine MP), where they were both highly decorated. When Cady was born, Walt appointed Henry her godfather.\n\nAfter Cady was assaulted in Philadelphia, Vic (who was assisting the police in the investigation) and Walt had sex. In the aftermath, Walt mentions that he has had sex with only six women in his life.<ref name=\"Kindness Goes Unpunished\"/> The two continued their relationship after returning to Durant; in \"A Serpent's Tooth\", Walt learns from the doctor that Vic was pregnant, but lost the baby after being stabbed during the confrontation with Tom\u00e1s Bidarte. As of \"Any Other Name\", neither Walt nor Vic knows that the other is aware of the pregnancy, but in \"Dry Bones\", Vic reveals that she knows Walt had been told.\n\n===Deputies===\nIn the books, Walt is assisted in his duties by a number of deputy sheriffs.\n\n* [[Undersheriff]] Victoria \"Vic\" Moretti, ACSD \u2013 Walt's second-in-command and named successor, she moved to Wyoming two years before \"The Cold Dish\" with her husband (whom she has since divorced) from [[South Philadelphia]]; she has a degree in law enforcement from [[Temple University]] and is slowly-but-surely working on her [[master's degree]], and spent over four years as a patrol officer on the Philadelphia Police Department.\n* Deputy Sheriff Jim Ferguson, ACSD \u2013 part-time deputy/head of search and rescue/volunteer fireman; Ferg has been on the job since at least 1988. \n* Deputy Sheriff Turk Connally, ACSD \u2013 Lucian's nephew who Walt hired as a favor to his old boss; he transferred from the Powder Junction Substation to the [[Wyoming Highway Patrol]] at the end of \"The Cold Dish\"\n* Deputy Sheriff Santiago \"Sancho\" Saizarbitoria, ACSD \u2013 A former corrections officer hired in \"Death Without Company\".

He is an able detective, who has a knack for finding the truth behind the various crimes that have been committed in his county.\n\nAs the series starts in 2012, Walt is slowly coming out of a deep grieving period where he delegated most of the day-to-day police duties to Deputies Branch Connally ([[Bailey Chase]]), Archie \"The Ferg\" Ferguson (Adam Bartley), and Victoria \"Vic\" Moretti ([[Katee Sackhoff]]).

Martha was diagnosed with cancer in the late 2000s/early 2010s, and died in 2011. Although Walt let everybody (including Cady) assume it was the cancer that took her life, Martha was murdered in an apparent mugging in [[Denver]], Colorado, by a man named Miller Beck. During his own investigation into his wife's death, Walt learned that Beck was hired to kill Martha, and then he was killed shortly thereafter to prevent him from talking to Walt. In \"High Noon\", Walt got a drunken confession out of Barlow Connally admitting to killing his own son and having Martha murdered; in the ensuing confrontation, Walt fatally shot Barlow and avenged his deputy and his wife.<ref name=\"High Noon\"/>\n\nIn \"Highway Robbery\", Walt asks out Dr. Donna Sue Monaghan ([[Ally Walker]]), a psychiatrist who works for the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]] in [[Sheridan, Wyoming]].<ref name=\"Highway Robber\">{{Cite episode|title=Highway Robbery|series=[[Longmire (TV series)|Longmire]]|airdate=September 10, 2015|season=4|number=7}}</ref>\n\nWalt's closest friend and confidant is Henry Standing Bear. They have been friends since they were 12 years old. When Cady was born, Walt appointed Henry her godfather.\n\nRecently prior to the date when the show starts, Walt hired Vic Moretti, a former Philadelphia PD homicide detective, as a Deputy Sheriff. The two are believed by many to be having an affair, including at one point Vic's husband, Sean Keegan ([[Michael Mosley (actor)|Michael Mosley]]). In the Season{{nbsp}}6 finale Walt and Vic finally realise and admit their feelings for one another and begin a relationship.\n\nWalt's relationship with the Cheyenne Nation is strained, but Walt is still liked by many members of its community.\n\n===Deputies===\nOn the series, Walt is assisted with his duties by three deputy sheriffs. After Branch's death, Walt hires Zachary Heflin, but fires him after he assaults a rejected deputy applicant who was stalking him.\n\n* Deputy Sheriff Branch Connally, ACSD (2008\u20132014, suspended; killed by Barlow Connally)\n* Deputy Sheriff Archie \"The Ferg\" Ferguson, ACSD (2011\u2013present)\n* Deputy Sheriff Victoria \"Vic\" Moretti, ACSD (2011\u2013present)\n* Deputy Sheriff Zachary \"Zack\" Heflin, ACSD (2015, fired; rehired, 2017)\n\nIn addition, Deputy Sheriff Eamonn O'Neill was on loan from Cumberland County to assist the office when both Walt and Branch were otherwise occupied, leaving Vic to run day to day affairs.\n\nAlso, Ruby (no last name specified) runs the sheriff's office and serves as dispatcher.\n\n==Differences between the books and TV series==\nAmong the key differences between the books and the TV series are the character's age and backstory. In the books, it is established that Walt is a college graduate and [[Vietnam War]] veteran, and has been the Absaroka County Sheriff since the early 1980s. However, on the TV show, no mention have been made or alluded to of a college or a military career (although those haven't been ruled out, either), and Walt's age has been established multiple times, via his having graduated from high school in 1981 and having been friends with Henry since they were 12 years old, 38 years earlier.\n\nIn a significant departure from the books, on the show, Walt's wife Martha did not die from cancer. Although she was diagnosed with the disease, in the TV series she was murdered, and the associated details are slowly revealed over several seasons, significantly affecting Walt's relationships with his deputy Branch and the Connally family.\n\nWhile the TV series portrays Vic as being interested in Walt, her feelings aren't reciprocated like they are in the books. Instead, the TV series has Walt slowly recovering from losing his wife, unable or unwilling to maintain a relationship with a woman called Lizzie Ambrose, before finally showing enough interest in a member of the opposite sex to actively court Dr. Donna Sue Monaghan. Only as the show draws to a close does Walt start a relationship with Vic.\n\nIn the books, Absaroka County sees five murders in 24 years.
