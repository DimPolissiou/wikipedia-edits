Located at 59th Street and Fourth Avenue in the [[Brooklyn]] neighborhood of [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]], it is served by the [[N (New York City Subway service)|N]] and [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] trains at all times, as well as some [[W (New York City Subway service)|W]] trains during rush hours.\n\nThe 59th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, which was approved in 1905 and subsequently modified. Construction on the segment of the line that includes 59th Street started on March 15, 1913, and was completed in 1915. The station opened on June 22, 1915 as the terminal of the initial portion of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1925, and again in the 1960s. The station was also renovated to be [[ADA-accessible]] between 2018 and 2020.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe 59th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line. The plan for the line was initially adopted on June 1, 1905, before being approved by the [[Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York]] on June 18, 1906 after the Rapid Transit Commission was unable to get the necessary consents of property owners along the planned route.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Rogoff|first=David|date=May 1961|title=The Fourth Ave. Subway|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzKvSWhrQBW4d3pvOGZaSERiZEhpQ24xT19DTktkQUVlLW5j/view|journal=New York Division Bulletin|publisher=Electric Railroaders' Association|volume=|pages=2\u201310|access-date=May 8, 2017|via=}}</ref> The Rapid Transit Commission was succeeded by the [[New York Public Service Commission|New York State Public Service Commission]] (PSC) on July 1, 1907, and the PSC approved the plan for the line in October and November 1907.<ref name=\":102\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XoxBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA18&dq=4th+Avenue+line#v=onepage&q=4th%20Avenue%20line&f=false|title=Fourth Avenue Subway, Brooklyn's New Transportation Line: A Part of the Dual System of Rapid Transit of the City of New York|date=June 19, 1915|publisher=Public Service Commission|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":11\">{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://bklyn.newspapers.com/image/53875480|title=Fourth Avenue Subway Is Sent To A Committee|date=March 20, 1908|work=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle|access-date=May 4, 2017|pages=1\u20132|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs part of negotiations between New York City and the [[Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company]] (BRT) and the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company]] for the expansion of the city's transit network, the line was leased to a subsidiary of the BRT.

She won the Kentucky Oaks and Black-Eyed Susan Stakes, and also won both races proposed for the New York leg (Acorn Stakes and Mother Goose Stakes).\n\nA prime reason for favouring the National Triple Tiara is that the Kentucky Oaks is the most popular races for fillies and draws one of the biggest crowds of any stakes races throughout the year (behind only the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes).<ref>{{cite web|title=Oaks Day Crowd of 116,046 Sets Record |url=http://www.churchilldownsincorporated.com/our_company/company_news/2010/04/30/oaks_day_crowd_of_116046_sets_record |website=www.churchilldownsincorporated.com|accessdate=7 November 2017|language=en}}</ref> The Kentucky Oaks consistently outdraws the Belmont Stakes, the Travers Stakes and the [[Breeders' Cup]] series. On the other hand, the Black-Eyed Susan is currently only a Grade II race as few modern trainers are willing to race their fillies with only two weeks rest after the Kentucky Oaks.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://helloracefans.com/races/triple-tiara/ A look at the Triple Tiara at Hello Race Fans]\n\n{{Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:American Triple Tiara Of Thoroughbred Racing}}\n[[Category:Racing series for horses]]\n[[Category:Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing]]\n[[Category:Churchill Downs]]\n[[Category:Pimlico Race Course]]\n[[Category:Belmont Park]]\n[[Category:Saratoga Race Course]]\n", "name_user": "KJTS77", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNational Triple Tiara Proposals", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Triple_Tiara_of_Thoroughbred_Racing"}
