The first lineup of the band also featured Lazar Male\u0161evi\u0107 (bass guitar) and Sini\u0161a Lu\u010di\u0107 (drums). In the beginning, the band had several lineup changes, before the first consistent lineup was formed. It featured Mumin, Medan, Vladimir Jovanov (also known as Menadner Protector, a former Necrophobic member, bass guitar), Mario Kalin (guitar), and Robert Radi\u0107 (a former [[Kontraritam]], [[La Strada (band)|La Strada]] and [[Obojeni Program]] member, drums).\n\nInitially, the band was [[punk blues]]-oriented. As the band's songs featured [[English language]] lyrics, and as their first releases were released through [[independent record label]]s, the band initially did not manage to break through mainstream media. They released their debut [[audio cassette]] entitled ''There no Centuries'' in 1988 through Mr Montenegro Records. In 1993, they released their second album ''Everclassic'' through Music Yuser,<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Love-Hunters-Everclassic/release/1185055 ''Everclassic'' at Discogs]</ref> and, in 1995, ''Oh, Evolution'' through the same record label. After these three releases the band gained a cult status in Novi Sad.\n\nDuring the spring of 1996 the band released the album ''Donau'' (through Music Yuser) which featured almost all songs from the previous two albums.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Love-Hunters-Donau/release/1083619 ''Donau'' at Discogs]</ref> At the same time, the album ''Total Rickvertzzo'', which featured demo recordings made during the 1987-1991 period, was released.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Love-Hunters-Total-Rickverzzo/release/1033859 ''Total Rickvertzzo'' at Discogs]</ref> The various artists live album ''\u010cetiri godine na Golom otoku'' (trans. ''Four Years at [[Goli otok]]'') featured recordings of their songs \"Kamikaze\" and \"There's Something in the Dark\", recorded at the concert in Klub Studenata Tehnike on December 9, 1995.

The conference was fairly stable for the first decade but began to grow in the mid 1990s. In 1998 four teams left to become [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] programs in the new [[Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference|MAAC]] conference. A year later, nine more teams split off to join their primary athletic conference, [[New England Small College Athletic Conference|NESCAC]], followed by the women's programs in 2001. Membership numbers held steady over the succeeding 15 years, though several teams came and went. In 2015 the conference rebranded itself as the New England Hockey Conference, but no internal changes occurred. Two years later 6 women's and 2 men's programs left to join a variety of conferences, dropping league membership to 11 schools, the lowest number in conference history.\n\n===Standings===\nFrom the time it formally split from ECAC 2 until 1992 all games played between members of ECAC East and [[ECAC West]] counted for conference standings. In 1992, after the ECAC West split into two conferences, ECAC East only counted games within their conference for the standings, but because a formal schedule was not yet in place all games between members were still counted. for the [[1993\u201394 NCAA Division III men's ice hockey season|1993-94 season]] ECAC East had its first official conference schedule with all 18 teams playing each other once. Teams could schedule additional inter-conference games but only one would count in the standings. In 1999, when 9 teams left to form the ice hockey division of the [[New England Small College Athletic Conference|NESCAC]], the two conferences continued to count games between one another in their respective standings. This arrangement continued even after the addition of more programs.\n\n==NEHC Tournaments==\n{{main|NEHC Men's Tournament}}\n\n==Current members==\nThere are 12 member schools; the men's division has ten members, while the women's division has nine members. <small>(as of November 2018)</small>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

operates in the [[Northeastern United States|northeastern]] [[United States]]. It participates in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] as a [[college ice hockey|hockey]]-only conference.<ref>{{cite web|title=Men's and women's ECAC East leagues now the New England Hockey Conference|url=http://www.uscho.com/2015/10/31/mens-and-womens-ecac-east-leagues-now-the-new-england-hockey-conference/|publisher=U.S. College Hockey Online |accessdate=October 31, 2015}}</ref>\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==History==\nThe New England Hockey Conference began as '''ECAC East''' in 1984 when [[ECAC 2]] was split in two and both new conferences dropped down to [[NCAA Division III|Division III]]. The conference was fairly stable for the first decade but began to grow in the mid 90's. In 1998 four teams left to become [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] programs in the new [[Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference|MAAC]] conference. A year later, nine more teams split off to join their primary athletic conference, [[New England Small College Athletic Conference|NESCAC]], followed by the women's programs in 2001. Membership numbers held steady over the succeeding 15 years, though several teams came and went. In 2015 the conference rebranded itself as the New England Hockey Conference, but no internal changes occurred. Two years later 6 women's and 2 men's programs left to join a variety of conferences, dropping league membership to 11 schools, the lowest number in conference history.\n\n===Standings===\nFrom the time it formally split from ECAC 2 until 1992 all games played between members of ECAC East and [[ECAC West]] counted for conference standings. In 1992, after the ECAC West split into two conferences, ECAC East only counted games within their conference for the standings, but because a formal schedule was not yet in place all games between members were still counted. for the [[1993\u201394 NCAA Division III men's ice hockey season|1993-94 season]] ECAC East had its first official conference schedule with all 18 teams playing each other once. Teams could schedule additional inter-conference games but only one would count in the standings. In 1999, when 9 teams left to form the ice hockey division of the [[New England Small College Athletic Conference|NESCAC]], the two conferences continued to count games between one another in their respective standings. This arrangement continued even after the addition of more programs.\n\n==NEHC Tournaments==\n{{main|NEHC Men's Tournament}}\n\n==Current members==\nThere are 12 member schools; the men's division has ten members, while the women's division has nine members. <small>(as of November 2018)</small>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"
